Andrew and you know what we had our we had a baby coming and I thought it was going to come that weekend and it didn't so it wasn't my fault blaming my wife and the baby so it's their fault but we are here tonight so thankful for the grace of the Lord amen Exodus 19 and 3 and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called out unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine can we Bob our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord God you look beyond all of our faults father and sin you've seen us in a condition Lord that we couldn't bring ourselves out of but you've seen the seed that you placed there before the foundation of the World Lord we want to thank you for that Grace Lord For The Love You bestowed to us tonight God lord as we come into this part of the service God I ask that you would anoint me father as I lay myself aside I ask that you would anoint this little thought that you placed upon My Heart Lord as the word comes forth father May there be a heart to receive it tonight father Lord I don't know the needs that are in this building father but you know the need father and the word has the authority father to meet the need and I ask that the needs would be met tonight Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated if I had a simple subject tonight it would be carried by the message and this just stood out to me whenever I was reading this here and I like how the Bible puts that and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him it was Moses then it uh Moses said we know the story how it goes he went up to the mountain and he did it the body his literal body didn't leave the Earth but he was still on Earth but there was a voice in the Lord started to speak to him and that this struck me we had a messenger on our last day that he he wasn't caught up he wasn't he didn't go to heaven or so to speak but there was a message that come to him and he brought us a message for this day and I love about this scripture is God is relaying his thoughts to Moses it ain't God speaking lip to ear to the children of Israel but God had a prophet on the scene and that Prophet had become the voice to the people and it wasn't that his voice was the literal voice but it was a voice behind the voice it wasn't the literal voice of Moses that was God but the message behind it was the voice of God for that day and I like how the Bible puts that now therefore if you obey my voice he was saying that there's a prophet on the scene there's a voice on the scene that is going to have my words that's going to have my thoughts that's going to have my my my my my ideas and if you want to succeed you got to come under that voice and you see just hearing thou voice wasn't good enough but they had to receive their voice and act upon him and I believe that voice was to be that direction and I believe God has given us a voice in this last day it wasn't the voice of a man wasn't a voice of a kentunkian but it was a voice to the church to the bride and gave them a direction you see that it didn't matter what the Nathans and the chorus were saying their focus had to be the voice their focus had to be the message and I believe that message had a destination before they was ever caught out of Egypt that message had a destination you look at Exodus 3 and 8 and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and I like how he's making a personal he says I ain't sending an angel I ain't sending uh this I ain't sending a man but I'm coming down through that man with a message and it's going to be me myself coming to that man with the same power with the same Authority there's a there's a quote I heard brother Branham say he says with the restoration of the word is the restoration of the power and I believe when that message come forth to Egypt to that people have brought an anointing and brought a power to the camp of the Israelites that they didn't have before but once that message come to the Earth come to that people there was a power that could break the the bands of the the Egyptians over their lives and I believe there's been a message in this last day that has released an authority it's released a power to the bride that it can break the bands have ideas break the bands of opinions break the bands and psychology and theology there's been a message in this last day that it's equipped us to come out of Lego to see you and take us into a Rapture I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land and unto a good land so before there was ever out they already had a destination come on now and we've been called out of Lego to see you and before we was ever called out we've got a destination God didn't call us I'll just to leave us but there's a Rapture the goddess called you for come on somebody God hasn't left you here by yourself but God has equipped you to see the Rapture to see the future home to see that body change God has given us a voice in this last day to carry us all the way to a her destination who am I to bring them up out of the land into her good land and I believe that our future is based upon the focus what we focus on what we focus on it influences us for our Direction you see if you go to a college and you want to be a scientist you're not going to major in history because the influence of that history ain't going to give you the direction to be a scientist so what you're going to do is you're going to major in something that's going to influence want you to meet your destination and I believe God has given us a message that can influence us and give us a Direction all the way to our destination hey I don't believe you're going to see a Rapture because of Dr adoption you're not going to see a Rapture because of all of these man's ideas and opinions but God has given us a direction it says under the influence of this a message you will meet your destination and I believe if you get into this message it will produce such a faith for the impossible where we can't help but believe a rapture we can't help but believe there's going to be a body change there's an influence in this message that has equipped us with the word with the faith to believe it oh come on somebody in this a message there's a faith to believe that God can still heal God still raises the dead God still fills with the Holy Ghost God still sets free the captives this a message just restored it to us that we can know it's no longer in the book of Acts it's no longer just in the prophet days but it's right here in the middle of Hardy Arkansas on a Wednesday night there's a power that can set free illnesses there's a power Hallelujah there's a power that's been restored to the camp of Israel Hallelujah it wasn't that the Israelites was doing it in their own ability but there was a message that equips him to produce an overcoming life and this message has released the power that's equipped you to produce an overcoming life oh my it's not just for the preachers but it's for anybody that's under the voice come on now I think well we I might have said this here before but Miriam was looking at Moses and and Aaron they was put they were acting Under The Voice they was acting under the word they were calling lives here to existence there was calling frogs into existence but Miriam will look and see him high that's all great and fine but what about me that's great for Moses that's great for Aaron but what about me I'm still getting beaten I'm still being scored I'm still working under the hand of the task Masters this the message is fine but I'm still in bondage but there come a time where the authority of the message wasn't just working from Moses and Heron but there come a time where Miriam was on the other side of the Red Sea and she turned around and seen the same message that was working for Aaron that was working for for the prophet was now working for her the Egyptians that was beating her day after day the message in action for her destroyed the chains of the task Masters and the same Authority that William Branham had is the shame Authority that is in the camp of the Bride Hallelujah this third pool wasn't just for the prophet but there's a bride on Earth that's operating under the spoken word you can speak to your Mountain you can speak to the sickness that it's in your life there's a power that this a message has released to the bride Miriam didn't have nothing to do with it she just had to operate under the voice that God had given in that night and that in that day and we've got nothing to do with it there's an authority that we can come under when we when we come under the influence of the voice you see our future is based upon what we focus on brother Branham talks about Abraham Lincoln he says Honest Abe was moted by the things he read and by the things he dwelled on he says he had the Bible he has Pilgrim's Progress and he says the influences of those books produced on this day come on now and he says what's your focus on what you dwell on it influences you emote your character and I believe if there's ever a time to get away from the influence of the world it's now God's given us an influence in this day brother Branham says influence one Minister's Wife let down and did this one Minister started so and so and the rest just started he says oh my just like Josiah here he says let's let nothing influence us but the word of God let that be our influence so the word has an influence the word of the message ain't Just Books it ain't just tapes it ain't just quotes but the message is an influence come on now it's your influence but the only way it can be your influence is when you acknowledge it as your influence you look up Proverbs three and five trust in the Lord with all thy heart and lean not into thy own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy path so in other words if you want him to be your direction you got to acknowledge Him in all your ways and that definition of acknowledge is to recognize the rights or the authority of so in order for him to be your direction you gotta recognize him as your Authority come on now you want this a message to lead you to a Rapture it's got to be your Authority come on somebody it's gonna be your hand it's got to be your motive it's got to be you your objectives you see I don't believe that that anything outside of this message is going to produce a Rapture and nothing happens by accident there's a message ain't going to influence you by accident but it's got to be a choice you see you don't become a bodybuilder by accident it takes some sweat it takes some tears it takes some dedication it takes some time setting aside and saying I'm going to be a bodybuilder I'm going to work for it at a rapturing faith ain't going to happen by accident it takes somebody that's dedicated to the voice and let the message start to influence you you see I don't believe that our Direction it's going to happen by accident but the Branham says and that's what the church ought to do today is look at one thing that's the voice look at one thing focus on one thing and that's the voice we've got too many people expecting to be going in One Direction but they're focusing on another Voice come on now you can't be you I can't expect to be going to Oklahoma if we're driving to Virginia come on now I can't expect whenever we left uh we left Virginia uh what was a Monday evening we couldn't be going to South Carolina and expect to be going here we needed the direction we needed something to let us know the direction we needed to go in order for us to get here we have that we have the address we had a truck we had we had gas in the truck it had a battery the thing started up fine but we needed a guide to show us how to get here come on now we you may have the Holy Ghost you may be a good Christian person but you need a guide to give you a direction to see their Rapture come on now we needed somebody to instruct us and let us know the way we're going is the wrong direction but this way is the right direction if Caleb wanted to see the promised land he needed to come under the direction of the voice and I believe that there's a direction that God has given in this day you look at Ecclesiastes hello 11-3 if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the Earth if the tree falls toward the South or toward the North in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be in other words if it's leaning this way it's not going to fall this direction come on now if it's leaning this way we're at false that's the direction it was leaning and I don't believe many people don't backslide by accidents they come under an influence brother Branham says the actor uh it fell way before the ACT took place is whenever she started to accept reasoning and I believe that many people backslide before they ever leave the church because they're under another influence but I believe there can be a bride that's Rapture Ready way before the Rapture takes place how come they're under a direction they're under and influence and that influence is pointing them to a direction we're being carried by something the Bible says where there's no vision the people perish so in other words there's people that stumbling around they're in chaos they're in confusion but at the same time but he that keepeth the law happy is here and I believe there's a bride in the midst of Chaos in the midst of confusion there's a bride that's got Vision they've got a direction they're not in the Gloom they're not they're not sad and depressed but they're happy they can rejoice in the things of God because they've got a Direction but to see in order to get a direction you need to know where to look you need to know where to look and so in order for there to be something to bring us from Virginia to here I couldn't look at my wallet and say give me a direction come on now I needed to look at the right Tank come on now I couldn't look I couldn't look at the water bottle and say give me the direction of Virginia there's nothing in this water bottle that can give me a direction and there's too many oh I hope this is okay there's too many people looking at their own ideas trying to get a direction to a Rapture there's no direction in man's ideas there's no there's no direction in man's opinions but God has given us a voice that has a direction you want to see a body change get in this message you want to see a Rapture get in this message it is the direction that God has given the bride but the brainum says that's the way it is with God's word God's word is not supposed to be learned like a newspaper story it's not supposed to be tried to be figured out it's the good down and look up to it saying God being merciful to me Give Me Faith to believe your word I like how we push that get down and look up in order to get paid you gotta look at the right place hope this is okay tonight in order to get faith in this message you gotta look at it the right way and I believe I believe that this a message is more than just ideas but it's the absolute that God has given the pride and in order for it to produce faith it needs to be looked at as the absolute come on now you can't sit there and argue with it and expect to see a rapture you can't step there and argue with it and expect it to produce Faith but in order for it to produce the right thing it's got to be operated the right way you see I was a landscaper for years and in order for me to to operate the push mower the right way I couldn't sit on it if I would on the mower and say my why aren't this thing working I can kick it I can throw it in the trash but it ain't the mower's fault it's got the ability to operate like it's supposed to but it's my fault for not operate come on somebody and in order for this message to work like it's supposed to you're going to operate it like it's meant to be operated listen message it meant to be operated like a Crete like a tradition like an idea but it is the absolute it is the direction to the pride and once it's operated like the absolute watch it starts to affect your life watch it start to affect you your home in the church you want to see a Revival in your home get into this message and let it be your absolute you want to see a Revival inside of this building get into the message get into the direction get into the absolute now watch your Revival strike like never before hey you see the devil likes the divide and conquer but once our church comes together in one Direction in one unity in one influence watch God come like never before come on now if this said this sit this side of the church has this idea and this side of the church has that idea and this right here has another idea it's not going to be going in One Direction this one's going in that direction that one's going in this direction this one's going in that direction but in order to move as a body they gotta come under One Direction come on now you want to see a church on fire come together in one direction it's not brother Ben's ideas it's not brother Ben's opinions but it's the voice that God has given that is the direction come on somebody what's the Bible say the 120 what's in the upper room in one Accord there were any Unity they had One Direction they had one go they had one purpose and once a church comes together hey it ain't the pastor don't bring the Revival come on now the church brings the Revival and he's not the church you make up the church and if you want to see Revival come under One Direction come under one influence and whenever this family is under the influence of the message this family is under the influence of the message this family is under the influence of the message they all come together and an explosion happens how come they wonder what an influence no wonder One Go they're wonder One absolute that's the message of the hour come on somebody you want a Revival come together in One Direction but you need to know where to look you want a direction you got to look into the message of the hour brother Branham says this now the hunt worldwide I've been in the wilderness and sometimes one of the best he says if you can look up and know the direction of the North Star he guides you out he says if you look up and know the direction the North Star can be there it can be Pride it can be the guide but in order but before it can guide you you've got to know the direction he says in a manner of Shame when he's lost if he can only find the North Star he can direct himself the way he's going that's when he's lost he looks for the North Star he says no other star shift but the North Star sets right in the center of the earth no matter where the Earth is turning the North Star Remains the Same he says it don't matter if the Earth is turning if it's rotating you see the courage he is constantly changing the stock market is constantly changing property value is constantly changing so we can't expect Earthly things to be our Direction but if we can get our Focus off of the things of the Earth get our influence off of Earthly things and let the left the North Star which is Christ be your influence then none of none of the other things will deteriorate but the Branham continues to say it points toward the north it's the only true star I understand though we have it's extremely the North Star it gives you your direction and he says that's what Christ is to you if you want to go to heaven if you want to be saved if you want to be filled with the spirit if you want to be christ-like so he's saying if you want a destination you got to know the direction he says Christ is your North Star if you're lost don't take a Creed he's your star he's your way he's your direction he's making a personal he the person Jesus Christ he's your direction and I believe that this message has brought Christ back into Focus come on somebody Christ has been brought back into Focus because of this message and has opened our eyes and let us know that we see Christ you see it's not that this message brought anything new it turned the way we looked at him it turned away we looked at this word you remember the story brother Branham tells of John spro he was overseas I believe in a garden and he was walking through this garden and he seen a statue and he looked up and it was Christ it was Christ on the cross on the cross he looks and he started to criticize it it says my there's no suffering it don't show the realities of the Cross but then there was a guide beside him that guide wasn't there to talk about himself that guide wasn't there to talk about his opinions that guide was in fair to point back to what he had for supper what he had for lunch but that guide was there for one purpose and that was to show the people how to look come on now and our guide our Prophet that we had in this day was here for one purpose and that was to point you to Christ and showed you how to look at this word come on now he says look there's Christ look and live look and be saved Hallelujah and that guy that God would come up to brother brow I came up to John spro and says you're looking at it the wrong way he says you need to come to this Altar and he says you need to kneel down and look up come on now you notice how he's saying that you got to come reverently you gotta push your pride aside and you gotta kneel down I think that's the way we need to look up this message come on somebody we need to we need to look at him in a way other than an opinion but it is our head and your brother Branham says once he got down and looked up he seen so much suffering that has started to break his heart he started to cry and weep he seen so much suffering that he didn't see it before because he was looking at it the wrong way but there was a guide there that showed him how to look at him and by a guide in this day has showed us how to look at the word and it has given us an Insight that we can see the realities of the Bible ain't just from the book of Acts but it's from this state God's still filling with the Holy Ghost but we needed to look at it the right way um I am so thankful we have somebody to show us how to look you remember the story of Philip in the and the eunuch the game the Bible says the angel of the Lord come to fill up and he says you need to go to is that I believe and there you're going you're going to meet somebody and the Bible says he come to Geisha and there was a eunuch the eunuch was reading the scriptures and the Bible says that Philip come up to the eunuch and says do you understand what you read and this just struck me the Bible says the eunuch looked to Philip and says how can I unless a man guides me come on he was reading scripture but could not understand him because there wasn't a guide oh but the Bible says he desired Philip to instruct him in scripture oh there was a response to the voice and I'm so glad that God placed the seed on the inside of this Pride that could respond to the voice as the God as the guide come to instruct the pride there was something responding to that instruction and the Bible says that either that Philip brought the scriptures and he was reading Isaiah 53 he took the same scriptures that the eunuch was reading before but started to instruct him he started to reveal it to him and what I love about it is the eunuch stop and he looks to Philip and says is he talking about himself is he talking about a prophet is he talking about another man and Philip says he's talking of Jesus Christ and right there Revelation struck he was reading the same scriptures but he needed a guide to teach him and instruct him how to look at him come on somebody brother praying him to bring a new Bible it was the same Bible we was reading the same scriptures but we needed a guide to instruct us and give us an understanding come on now what a baptism was in the Bible the godhead was in the Bible serpent sheet was in the Bible but we was reading it the wrong way we was looking at it the wrong way but in this last day the revelations has been opened up and we can go with an understanding the serpent seat us right what a baptism is right not just these things but we know our position now come on now your name was in the book but you couldn't see it but because of the guy because of this voice because of this direction you can know that you're not Serpentine you're not a part of the tribulation Saints but sure the pride of Jesus of Jesus Christ the guide told us how to look at it come on now he told us how to look at it and say you're not a wannabe you're not a Castaway you're not just a church but you're the pride of Jesus Christ and I Proclaim tonight you're not some passed away but sure the pride of Jesus Christ that he has called and elected for this last day come on somebody I think it's time to start acting like it come on brother Branham says he's afraid that we're living below our god-given privileges God has given us a message he's giving us an open book He's giving us our inheritance but we live behold we live beyond below our privileges because we don't get into it for ourselves you see if I was in a desert somewhere and I was dying of dehydration and there was a big old jug of water sitting there in an order for me so to to get life back in my body I had to pick it up and put it into action come on now worse than that there wasn't no water there there was something there to bring back bring back life in my body and there's a message that has brought life back to the body but in order for it to produce life you gotta operate it come on now I have to pick up that chunk of water and drink it then once I put it into action it starts to bring life back to the body come on now you want a Revival you want life in your home get into the message and drink it get into the message and eat it get into the message be nosy in the message then you have plenty to talk about you'll have plenty to gossip about we can gossip about the devil all day long come on somebody we've got something to say now we got something to say with an authority we're no longer just guessing that the devil's defeated but we know it come on somebody we know it there's an authority in the bride we know it yes sir and what I love about this is the story of this uh Philip and the eunuch he stops and he says here's some water what hinderests me to be baptized and what I love about it is the Bible says there was a search in water it wasn't just an ordinary water but it was a certain place a certain time that a revelation struck in the eunuch says there's some water what hindrance me to be baptized he heard the voice he recognized it he received it now he's acting upon him come on now and this pride has heard the voice she's she's recognized that she's received it now she's acting upon him I believe every devil can be put under your feet every sickness can be put under your foot every Spirit can be put under your foot look Warmness formal Spirits lay on a sea of spirits can be put under your foot you've recognized the voice you've received the now you're acting upon it and saying there's an authority in my home there's an authority in my life there's an authority that is in the pride once again oh mama what I love about the scripture was the Bible says he opened his mouth so it was a human mouthpiece that opened his mouth but once the words come forth it was in a human voice any longer it was a human mouth but the voice that come forth wasn't human words but it was the Revelation that was equipping the eunuch to march on and we had a prophet with the human voice he opened his human mouth but once that voice come out once though the word come out it was something to equip the bride oh my so now it changed the way we looked up the word but now we have to receive it we have to act upon it brother Branham says there's a vast difference in looking at God's word and receiving God's word so we need to look at it we need to find it but once we find it we got to move on to receiving it come on somebody but the brand of continues on to say them but receive the word not them that examined it them that received their God added to the church such as be saved three thousand Souls received the word he's talking about the ones that come to Peter and says what must we do to be baptized he says repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and you notice they didn't stop and says that's the saith the Lord worship indication is that just your opinion is that just your idea I think I think this is just his opinion oh they realize that there was something inside of this man that was transforming lives come on now once they realize that brother Branham says they received it and once they received it their shows were added come on now you want to see a Victorious Life you gotta receive it he continues on the same he says now you can hear the word preach you can look at it and admit that attract Cain did all others did it but just where did the word fall and brought forth he says them that received it gladly was baptized he says she receiving the word and the Bible says in Acts 2 and 41 then they gladly received his words and were baptized so once they received it they put his words into action and at the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine the words steadfast means firm and unwavering so once they receive the word they become firm and unwavering you want to be you want to be a brick house you want to be firm and unwavering receive the message you know what the word receive it means to permit to enter so once you allow it to enter and make changes then you become firm and unwavering you see they had to look past all of the discouragement they had to look past all of the other ideas and opinions because they were the preachers of that day was saying he was Beelzebub Christ must be elzabeth he was a fortune teller he was this he was that they had to get past all of the other voices and received the voice that God had and I think it's time we ignore all of the other voices and receive the voice that God has you look at Romans 1 and 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power unto God power of God unto salvation and I believe we can say that about this message I am not ashamed of this message for it is the power unto a Rapture it's the power for a body change you may say where was the power to save the Apostle Paul from stonings and from beatings where was this power that that could keep him from the shipwrecks where was that power and this struck me the other day date because I was thinking on these things too where was that power at and it struck me it wasn't a human power that brought him through the beatings come on now at the end of the day he was peaked he was scorched he was Shipwrecked but he still said I have kept my faith that wasn't a human ability that kept the faith he realized there's a power in this gospel that has kept me through the beatings it's kept me through the stonings and I believe there's a pride that's been through some hard times you've been through some hard times you've been through some trials you've been through heartbreaks you've been through some things but you realized that I wasn't keeping this message this a message was keeping me I've been through hard times but I've got my faith I've got my faith is there a witness tonight you've been through hard times you've been through heartbreaks you've been through trials you've been through circumstances but you still got the faith that's not your ability it's the power of this a message that's been released to you it's not you keeping a hold of the message is she answered a message carrying you it's carrying you through the Red Sea it's carrying you through the Wilderness it's carrying you through the famine it's carrying you stick with the message Hallelujah stick with the message it's carrying us all the way to our destination Hallelujah we're being carried by something but in order to be carried by something you got to give up and rely come on now you got to give up and rely on what's carrying him if you're fighting against it you're not going to go anywhere come on somebody how many knows how to swim a few of you how many's ever tried to save somebody that was drowning and if they're fighting against you you're never getting anywhere you're staying in one place and you're both about to drown so in order to save the person that is drowning they got to give up and rely on your strength come on somebody you want to get somewhere with this message you gotta give up and rely on the strength of it this ain't the strength of a man this is the arm of the Lord the strength of the Lord that has been released to the bride come on somebody it's the strength of the Lord that's been released to the bride we're being carried against her remain we're being carried we're not we're not fighting against him but we're being carried by him but the Branham says When God says the Holy Ghost and knocks out a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he's going to turn it down for the last time and then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in a church listen to The Gospel agree with the gospel you might do as much to say I know what's right but never put a finger on it to helping yourself see you listen to it and believe it try that's just sympathizing with it come on he says that's just sympathizing with it but we gotta go beyond them he continues on to say I could believe that's ten thousand dollars that that don't mean I've got it see I could say this is good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what I mean and this is eternal life and to refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy and you won't have the privilege to come and receive it come on now if there's something talking at your heart it's the message you're privilege not everybody has got a heart to receive it but God has given you something to receive it hey we gotta stop sympathizing with it and say it's great it's wonderful it's got It's great ideas we need to go beyond that and receiving it you know but the Bible says that the disciples come to Jesus and they say how come you speak to them in Parables and he says it's not given them to know the Mysteries but it's been given you to know there was something on the inside of the disciples that was different than the Ordinary People come on now there's something on the inside of you that is different than the Ordinary People the Baptists can't receive this the Methodist can't receive this but God has given you something to receive this word hey that was looking at Jesus and saying a parable they couldn't look past the mystery and see the Revelation the only thing they saw was a mystery the only thing they saw was a parable but the ones that had a heart to receive looked past the parable come on somebody they look past the mystery and saw the Revelation oh my the denominations is seeing a mystery you know the the High episode Gordon Lindsay would say he had the gift of Prophecy he could he could lay hands or he would touch the right hand and there'd be evaporations he says he could lay hands on the sick and God would heal them but when it come to his Doctrine he was off oh they didn't look past the mystery the only thing they saw was the parable but there was some chosen come on now the dinner just see the mystery but they looked beyond the mystery and saw my name I look beyond the mystery you've looked beyond the mystery and it's see the future home come on now you can see it with the revelation hey you can't see it if you're looking at a closed book still come on somebody John couldn't see his name as long as the book was closed but once the seals was loosed the book was open he started to shout he realized I'm no longer guessing that my name is there but I know we're no longer guessing the day of guessing is over with but a revelation has been given to you I know that I know that I know I'm not guessing any longer I know it do you know it this evening can you see it with the revelation I know it so receiving the word brings an understanding and an understanding opens your eyes to see what God is doing in this day you remember the two that walked on the road to Emmaus they was talking about Christ they were talking about a day gone by and Jesus appears in their midst it says who are you talking about and these two looked at the one they're talking about it says are you a stranger in these parts so without understanding Christ is a stranger come on somebody without this a message Christ is a stranger and so the Bible says Christ Started From The Book of Genesis the beginning of the Bible and went through all of the Bible teaching them about himself and brother Branham says he was preaching it but they couldn't understand it he says preaching don't bring understanding receiving it brings understanding they were sitting there with Christ in their midst but in order for them to seek him they had to receive it come on now Christ is Sandra Mitch the message has brought Christ back in the churches but in order to see him you've got to receive it come on somebody the Bible says that it was the evening time and Christ acted as if he was going to walk by their house and the Bible says they stop and says no come in with us and brother Branham says right there they received the word and when they received the word the pride and understanding come on now thou brought an understanding and what did understanding produce It produced a revelation you know the Bible says when Christ broke the bread their eyes was open and they saw Christ their realized that the same things that he done before he was crucified he is still doing and that's what a revelation does it opens our eyes to Noah the god of the New Testament is the god of the new and the god of the new it's the god of today it's brought an understanding that I'm not here by myself there's an anchor only in China that is holding me the ship may be tattered the bow might be about to break but there's a revelation that is holding me through every trial hallelujah we're being carried by something oh my but once their eyes was open they understood the word not just serving a God in the Tomb but our God is alive come on now our God is alive this ain't something of two thousand years ago but God is the reality this message has brought the realities of Jesus Christ to the bride oh my we're no longer guessing but it is a revelation you see receiving brings an understanding you look at Proverbs two and one my son if that will receive my words and hide my Commandments with thee so that thou can incline thy ear unto wisdom and apply their hearts to understanding so before you can hide the Commandments and kind thou we thine ear to a wisdom and apply the heart to understanding you've got to receive it come on now so before you can put it into action you have to receive it you look at Revelations 3 and 20. behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice hear my message and open the door allow me to enter I will sup with him and he with me I will Fellowship I will bring an understanding come on now this message has brought us back on talking terms with Jesus Christ once we receive it something slips out to an Unseen World brother brand of says now we can preach the word explain the word but you have to receive the word he says oh Hallelujah that's what sets in a fire brother when you receive it the Revelation slips out into an Unseen World Yonder so once you receive it the producers of Revelation what's the Bible say we walk by faith not by sight so a revelation is something that we can see we might not see with our natural eyes but a revelation it says it's there come on now Faith is the substance and the evidence of Things Not Seen it's the substance of revelation we can grab a holder and say God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God fills with the Holy Ghost even though I'm still sick her Revelation says God can heal come on somebody it slips out into an Unseen World you know brother Branham says in this building it's radio waves it's pictures either there's voices but he says you can't see it because it's in another dimension but it says you need an instrument to tap in that other dimension and bring it down to reality so right now we're just guessing that it's here we can't see the pictures we can't hear the voices but once we get an instrument that Taps into that other dimension we're no longer guessing the colors we're no longer guessing the voices but it's coming to reality and this message has produced of Faith where the brand of says in the building is your healing it's your deliverance it's the Holy Ghost but you need an instrument to tap into the other dimension and bring it into reality and that's what your faith is this message has produced such a faith that it's tapping into the Unseen World hallelujah it's tapping into the Unseen World I'm bringing healing into reality bringing the Holy Ghost into reality is bringing the Rapture into reality I might not see it with my natural eyes but a revelation says it's there a revelation says the future home is around the corner hang on to that Revelation you see who Abraham was walking by a revelation he couldn't see Jehovah Jireh with his eyes yet he was walking by Revelation he was being received the words of the Lord the words of the Lord says go and sacrifice your son he received the words and now he was acting upon him and the Bible says that he looked to his servants and says the latinine will go up and worship and we will return he was acting upon Revelation but there come a time that that Revelation becomes substance come on now he was walking up the mountain Isaac will look around and say father we've got that we've got the word we've got the fire we've got the rope and the knife but where's the sacrifice and by Revelation Abraham would say the Lord will prepare himself a sacrifice he was walking by Revelation but there come a time that that Revelation was made sight he was right there about sacrifice Isaac and he turned and looked and he seen Jehovah Jireh he seen a ram in the bull rushes his Revelation was made sight come on now right now we're hanging on to revelation of a body change better hang on to that Revelation one day it's going to be made sight something to slip into an Unseen World and we can now see it a revelation Has Lifted us up where we can see what the prophet sees you know brother Branham says the eagle swings that that Moses was talking about he says that was Moses message come on now that was Moses message that was carrying them it lifted them up and you notice that message gave Caleb a glimpse of his future Caleb was still right there in Egypt but the Bible says I'm going to bring you into a land flowing with milk and honey he wasn't there yet but that message had lifted him up where he can see a glimpse of his future Hallelujah this message Has Lifted us up where we can see a glimpse of our future a revelation says the Rapture is true Hallelujah and what I love about the story of Caleb is Caleb was so convinced of that message that it had become his own words he'd have become his own idea because the Bible says once the spies come back from the land that was giving an evil report hey the Bible says Caleb stop and he's still the people and he says he is more than able to give us the land that is Flowing with milk and honey he he's reports how to become the same report as the message come on now his report his words have become the same words that the voice was speaking years before that and our report has become the same report of this message our ideas has become the same ideas or opinions has become the same opinions we've received it let's become our Direction hallelujah it's become our Direction oh my see that's what Revelation does I was up at brother Craig Brewers last year and he's a missionary at heart you all know about the Craig here he's the missionary he's been to all of these other countries and he loves going and blazing trails and he has testimony after testimony but when we was there he wasn't the one telling us these testimonies it was his children and I was standing there as boys and his little girl was saying hey this happened one time that happened they were these kind of clothes in this country they act a certain way in that country and I started thinking and I'm sitting there and if I wouldn't have known any better I would have thought they had been there but they had never been there they was just trusting their reports of their father come on now they have so much confidence in God's report that his report had become their report his testimonies had become their testimonies we might not see the Rapture yet but we had a voice that come back with the report and I've got so much confidence that his report has become my report [Applause] his words has become my words and his authority is my authority it's something we can anchor our life upon and believe it without a shadow of doubt that it is true and brother Craig was sather just smiling he's smiling at you tell him this story tell him this one he was sitting there so proud and I'm sure God gets proud whenever he sees you in a trial but you're still speaking the message he sees you in the fiery furnace but you're still quoting the message he sees you in the Lion's Den and you're still quoting the message he gets a little happy and says oh yeah that's my children that's the chip off the old block trials gonna take it away the fiery furnace could have taken away Hard Times couldn't take it away come on now God gets a little happy whenever he sees somebody believing his report it ain't a man's report it's God's report oh my it's produced to Faith brother Branham says now don't forget to get this now Faith is designed to see what God wills and wants he says there's no knowledge I can do that faith alone is designed and give to the human race to find out what the will of God is faith is designed to see what God wants where does faith come by hearing the word hearing the word not parts of the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word and that's what the message brought to us was the word and that's produced of Revelation oh my you believe it tonight has brought an understanding brother Branham says now God Likens his prophecy Eagles because they go they go so high and they can see farther than any other brother Branham says that Jeremiah Isaiah and Jonathan went so high that they could see into the Millennium way before it took place even though we couldn't see it we're believing their reports thank God I'm so high that they could see into the future but then they have come back and has given us her report and because of Faith that's producing a revelation you look at Hebrews 11 and 3 through faith we understand through faith we understand not by your head knowledge not not by man's opinions but through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear you notice that the writers of the Old Testament wasn't there whenever God spoke the world into existence they wasn't there when he said let there be light they wasn't there when he said let there be trees let there be this but God lifted them up where they could see it to us and now when they bring the report back through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God it's only through faith and through faith we understand that the Rapture is a reality Hallelujah the Bible says in John they accept the man be aborted again he cannot see the kingdom of God and brother Brandon says the word see is to understand so in order to understand you have to have a faith that produces an understanding hope this is okay tonight the Bible says in Ephesians 3 and 12 in whom we have boldness and access and boldness and access with the confidence by the faith of him you look at Romans 8 and 28 and we know that all things work together for the good how do we know faith has produced and understanding come on now if you can ever catch that revelation we know that all things even though when the bottom of the bottom of the fiery furnace we know with an understanding that we're not by yourself we're being carried by something brother praying them says when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of a thing there's nothing in the world that is going to defeat you in it what are you in you're in a revelation you're being carried by something come on now the word of God can't be defeated and if you're being carried by it that means you can't be defeated come on heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail so if you're anchored on the word you're an overcomer with him come on somebody if you're anchored on this message you an overcomer with it this message can't be defeated oh mine because because we know our future the things that we go through don't bother us is this okay brother being when you know your future you know it reminds me of the story that Mark loudly told one time he says that he he was on a so he was on a boat a houseboat and he says a tornado came by and his boat started to rock back and forth and he thought he was going to die he was scared he was scared to death but after it was over he comes walking out and there's boats upside down there they're they're on their side and he looks over there's some guys there says well who we made it through another one and he walks up to him and he says what's going on on guys he says well this is Tornado Alley he says this happens all the time and Mark Lowry says my if I knew I was going to make it it would be fun for me too he didn't know if he was going to make it or not but once you know the future you know you're an overcomer come on now if you know you're an overcomer the things around you won't discourage you this message has showed us our future if you know you're gonna make a Rapture the tribulation don't bother you come on somebody if you know you're the pride of Christ the sleeping virgins these other things ain't meant for you this message Has Lifted You Up On Eagle's Wings where you can see the future you can see the future the the tribulations around us it ain't bothering me we know what's so aggravating is whenever you're planning to scare somebody you're standing behind the wall over there you're just waiting for somebody to walk by and you're going to say and you're going to scare him but they're not smarter like says hey somebody's standing right there so now you jump out but that you're not startled because you know they're there come on now you know that's God of aggravate the devil when he's showing everything he's got out yet but we know we've got insights but the message of the hour knowing we're gonna make it the devil's throwing trials he's throwing circumstances he's doing hard times at you but nothing startling you because we've read the back of the book Hallelujah we've read the back of the book and we're not defeated but we're Overcomers come on now we're not in hell but we're in a rapture we know the future and when you know the future present things don't bother you president things don't bother you but it's hard to rely sometimes you know I like I'm a crazy driver I drive pretty crazy but I feel safe and secure when I'm driving but I find when the passenger seat relying on somebody else things get a little they it gets uncomfortable because you're not in control any longer yeah come on now that's why we don't like being carried by the message it's because we like to be in control I'm preaching now but once we give up and rely we're no longer in control it's not us trying to make a Rapture it's the master it's the message producing the Rapture come on now we're not trying to make a body change it's the message carrying us to the body change I'll bring this down to a close here in a minute just just bear with me a few more minutes brother Branham says faith knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought Faith creates Faith creates Faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes positive he says oh how beautiful so Faith brings things when there is no thanks Faith creates and so Faith brings a substance whenever you're sitting there in discouragement and you're like my I don't see a way out Faith creates a way out it brings a revelation it brings Christ into reality brother Branham says now look what is faith faith is a sixth sense five senses control this man God put man in five senses to contact this Earthly home you don't contact god with your five senses you know God by faith that struck me when I read that you know God it's a personal it's a personal relationship you know God by faith which is the Sixth Sense there was two senses of the Soul Faith unbelief and your possessment of faith faith is just as much of a reality as your sight is so my son will argue with you saying this is white you may say it's purple it's blue it's pink it's red it's orange but my sight says no it's a reality this is white and brother Branham says that's why faith is to the believer it brings God into reality the devil can can whisper and lie and say God don't heal God don't save God God don't set free but faith says it's a reality I don't care what you say nothing's going to detour me we're packing something that is that is produced a revelation but the Branham says and God says what was it Moses was his messenger Moses and the eagle they were carried on because he was packing God's message he was packing God's message and here's the brother Branham says here a true voice of God only brings back the real living Supernatural god with their Supernatural word the supernatural manifestation of the true word so the message that Moses had was equipping Caleb to manifest the supernatural word for that day see Caleb when he got to the promised land Caleb started to manifest what the voice said years ago he he wasn't there by his own ability his own power but there was something that brought him that far you notice Caleb didn't have to worry about speaking why speaking Manna Out of Heaven he didn't have to worry about bringing water out of the rock he didn't have to worry about having shoes on his feet it was the message that equipped the water it was the message that brought Mana it was the message that kept shoes on their feet the only thing he had to do was rely he had a spiritual insight and you see that inside brought him to a reality look at numbers 14 or 24 but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and has followed me fully that struck me followed me fully this is God speaking he wasn't following a man but the message that he brought God gave was God what if he was pounding he went and his seed shall possess it his seed wasn't Overcomer because he followed the message fully you want to see your children and people follow the message fully you see the children's children could sit at home that night and say my this is wonderful we're on our Promised Land the Giants are being defeated and they can look back into a father and say thank you you follow this message Fuller will you put me in an atmosphere where the Giants had to fall you put me in an environment where I could possess that I could possess the promised land and I'm so grateful that they're still parents in this day that is following God fully and is equipping their children as the musicians come we're being carried by something and that's my last point I hope this is okay tonight brother Branham tells the story about uh Paul Rader I believe he was the preacher of Divine Healing and brother Branham says he got sick and he got a fever and he went into a coma and in this coma he had a dream and in the Stream he was a logger and brother Branham says he they were way up in the mountains and his boss says go up to the mountain cut down that log and bring it down here and brother Branham says he goes up there he cuts down the log and he tries to pick it up he tries to pick it up but he can't do it and brother Branham says rap there he spelled down and he starts to cry he says mile why would my boss tell me to do this he turns around to see they ain't his boss but a truck he says brother Brandon into the water he jumps on him and he rides it all the way to the camp saying I'm riding on it I'm writing on it I'm writing going brother Brandon says he wakes up saying I'm riding on it I'm right ain't gonna rap there God heals him and brother Branham says the log represents the gospel he says we can't do it by yourself but he says just write on it brother random says this that's what the church denomination has done today wore themselves out tugging up this tugging at them trying to do this trying to do that he says turn loose and let God do it that's the thing let God do it it's too much for you anyhow it's too much for you anyhow you see it's not us trying to make a Rapture but it's us riding on we can't produce this trying to make they've tried making this and making that but God has equipped you to jump aboard this message and it will produce it brother Branham says brother sister Jesus Christ these things have happened in the last day believe that we're living here I don't know how it's happened but I'm riding on but it's the truth because that's the gospel he says I believe it is hiding with me why don't
