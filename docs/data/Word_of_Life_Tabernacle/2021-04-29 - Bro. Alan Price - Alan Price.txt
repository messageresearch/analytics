those that have lost loved ones lord the requests that were turned in y'all we pray just send a special touch their way lord for the people that made a special effort tonight to come out god i pray just give them a blessing as well but i pray just move me aside and just speak to your children this evening lord that my ideas and my thoughts or my feelings on anything wouldn't have anything to do with it lord it would just be your word coming forth tonight pray just bless the service lord that everything be done and use for your service lord that we would we would just yield ourselves to you in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you love the lord this evening amen if you would just turn turn with me to mark chapter 10 and verse 17. i'll begin reading here this evening i'd like to speak if i could just for a little thought tonight i i know preachers say it all the time i'm not going to hold you along but i'm i mean it tonight so amen so lord will and it's not that we don't want to stay long and it's not that we want it to be shorter we don't want time in the word but amen sometimes god just lays a little thought on our hearts and i mean we just want to kind of come as a little sunday school lesson tonight and just present that just for the benefit of the people and see what god can do with it amen amen little as much when god is in is that right amen we'll begin reading at verse 17 and we'll go on down to the 22nd verse and and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life and you know one thing i've never really realized in reading this story is that that it was what would be called the rich young ruler but he came running to christ he had an urgent request is that right and jesus said unto him why call us thou me good there is none good but one and that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered him and said to him master all these i observe have observed for my youth then jesus behold in him and love loved him and said unto him one thing thou lack is go thy way and sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions amen in that you can be seated this evening amen just pray that lord just bless the reading of his word and and so tonight i i came with two computers and notes and i'm gonna be preaching off my cell phone and my my bible a little bit tonight i couldn't get anything to work but i'd like to speak if i could just for a little bit on determination this evening and i was determined not to give up and and the lord finally blessed it and and saw fit amen but i think that's the thing of you i'd like to just kind of start off just just asking you know have you ever met somebody that's been determined about something you know no matter what what you wanted to do what you try to do you couldn't stop them you know you ever get your your child gets something on his mind and they're very determined to get that exact thing done and you can't stop it until they're done is that right you know tonight when i got home from work their grandma had bought the boys some little cars and they didn't have the right size screwdriver to fit it so from the second i walked into the house so the second we left daddy wears a screwdriver can we go look here can we go look here and i'm like leave me alone we'll get it maybe after church if not tomorrow but they were determined to get that screwdriver and so we see that in our in our in our life in our christian walk and in just in our lives in general what we are determined what we're determined to do is what's going to be the outcome of our actions is that right so if you're determined to be a good christian god will grant that to you if you're determined to be an average christian and you put in an average effort then god's going to allow you to be an average christian the odds not going to come down and and miraculously just give you what you want just because you say well i want this but you've got to actually do something uh in in this battle in this fight and you notice here the rich young ruler he came running and many times we see people they come into the message they come into uh maybe into uh christianity and they just run a hundred miles an hour and they're kind of like the the parable of the tortoise and the hare and you see that rabbit's just running as fast as he can but the but the tortoise has determination he's focused he doesn't either the rabbit gets distracted he looks at this he looks this way looks that way but the turtle has a termination and stays on track is that rhyme now we see brother branham says in a court trial in birmingham he says in 1964 he says so joshua said i stealed the people and said i don't care how great they seem to be and how much opposition he said how much fanatical it seems remember god said when we're in egypt i have given you this land i've given it to you so even before they had possession of that land joshua had to come and remind them that this land that they were looking at they were going to be fighting for was their land because god had promised it and now he wasn't just going in there sweep it out and plaster on the walls until you come in and get you a get mom's chair and sit down and say well we'll have the maids fix the bed for you he don't do it that way joshua wasn't told by god everywhere or joshua was told by god everywhere the soles of your feet steps i've given to you he said foot footprints means possessions he says and every promise in the book to the is to the believers and you've got to make footprints through it you've got to fight every inch of the way you haven't got no fight in you he says if you haven't got no fight in you then get out of the game and and i love how brother branham says that right there he says you know not going in there and just sweep it out and bring in mama's chair and sit down if you want something you have to go and earn it is that right and we know that in our in our physical lives if we want you know unfortunately as much as the government is trying to hand out money there's no way that you can just sit around and not if you want to better your life you have to go better your life is that right if you want to go and get something done or if you want a new house or you want a new car you have to go and work for that is that right and so we see in christianity if you want things it's not that we have to go and do works as in the catholic church does works but god does put a level of responsibility upon the believer that we've got to trust in him that when he says it's ours we've got to walk towards that is that right but i love how brother bram says right there if you haven't got no fight in you then get out of the game and you know this year i've i've done a new thing and i didn't want to do it but i was asked to do it and so i'm coaching a little league team for eight-year-old boys and you know three kids is too many for me already but now 11 additional ones is way too much and and you can see kids who have determination and then you have some kids who just give up they miss the ball they are done they are destroyed the world has ended no hope and you see a kid who will miss the ball and he will try until you just your hands are blistered from throwing it to him and and you can see that's a natural thing and sometimes that's the way maybe parents bring their kids up and maybe the way that maybe the way that the kids just nature just the way that kids nature are but but we come to a point a point as adults and as young adults and teenagers and and we come to a point to where we can no longer really blame our parents we can't really blame society anymore we've we've got to come to a point where he says you know what if i still can't catch the ball it's because i'm not practicing i'm not putting in the time i'm not trying enough and and as christians you can only blame the pastor so long you can only blame lay members other lay members so long until finally you got to just come to the point and say you know what maybe the reason my christian walk is not where i want it to be is because of me is that right and so we see as christians you know i could blame brother ben and say well you're not doing this you're not doing that but my prayer life is not in his control is that right that's in my control and so we we see here that as christians it's not that god's just come in and made a flower but at ease and just as brother graham said plaster the walls moved in mama's chair and have the maid bring something in for you but we've got something to do is that right we've got to be determined to get to see that what god has given us the promises that god has given us we've got to have the determination to see it through now tonight i would just like to focus just a little bit on determination if we could and and the definition for determine means to resolve to conclude or to come to a decision now in in um in our lives especially in my life one of my least favorite things to do is make a decision me and my wife going out to eat i just want her to pick you know what she just wants me to pick and for some odd reason we both picked the last time so it's it's always this year your turn it's my turn and and again and i've one thing i've noticed in life is is maybe you know the more uh maybe the more physical labor that you do or uh or one thing i've known in the financial industries the the the higher ups make the bigger decisions they have to make that determination and be exact and absolute on that determination and and we see that the the determination means the act of determining or deciding and so we hear many times you know the song i have decided to follow jesus but when you see someone that's fully determined you see someone that's steadfast and it doesn't mean they're moving faster than everybody but they've been moving continuously in the same direction for a very extended a long period of time and in that word it means firm resolution a settled purpose and i believe as as i've looked back on my christian life i can definitely say i've i've wondered and strayed and not been perfect by no means and i think anybody in here could have tested that and my christian walk has been that it's been a walk it's been a journey you can ask my wife and and she's obviously our 10-year anniversary is like in a week and so she's obviously determined to stay married to to me after all the things that i've put her through and and so we see that you know you've got to be determined but you look at your christian walk and and one thing i can say is that i have always stayed focused on christ amen so i can look back and say you know i haven't been perfect i haven't always done this or i haven't done that but i can i can tell you that i am determined to serve him amen i may not see everything the same way you see it or you may not see everything the same way i see it but i do have one common goal and that's for me to make it to heaven and everyone else that i know to make it to heaven i don't ever want to kick anybody out and i think if you ever get the attitude that that that somebody is not good enough for heaven then you've got the the wrong mental idea you've got the wrong idea anytime you start trying to scripturalize or messagize people out of heaven you've got the wrong motive and objective amen jesus said he'd come to seek those that were lost he came and he made his home with the drunkards and with the harlots and and we see today that sometimes it seems like as message people we've got this conception not us here but maybe other message people or other christians or other denominations that we're a higher up and i know we've got a higher calling but we should never try to push people out of the message is that right or push people out of salvation and i believe if you look back through the times and and the message and and i was kind of thinking the other day as i was driving and and i was actually thinking about toys and and and my little boy and i i cannot stand it but at school pokemon is coming back and man that was so demonic when i was a kid and i remember like certain cartoons were so demonic like transformers was demonic and this is demonic and now it's okay in some places but things that we used to definitely not accept i remember when southern gospel was you know if the base was too loud it was rocky and now contemporary music's in and man i would have gotten in so much trouble for listening to my praise and worship back and then but now praise and worship but it's okay to listen to and so you look at all these things that have rolled down i'm not telling you how to live your lives or anything you you talk to your pastor and the holy ghost will lead you and guide you where you need to be but but we see that we know you can listen to things and and i remember i was i was i was sitting in the uh the bathroom with paxton and and i was watching um a youtube video of a church playing a song and it was a great song we sing it here and i can't remember the name of it but he looks at me goes daddy said rock and roll and i was like oh you know but i mean they were they were jamming out they were getting in the spirit of that but it was more of the spirit of the music not the spirit of words and and so you know obviously we can take uh we could take music as musicians and we could take amazing grace and we could make it rockish you know we could we could do anything that we want to and it's the spirit that you worship in and and you could take a good service and you could make it a bad service with a spirit that you worship in or choose not to worship in is that right but as christians you've got to come to church you've got to be determined that what you ask for it will be given and i know this is really different from my style it's more of a little teaching but that's what this way i feel led tonight so that's the way we're going to go and if i try to do anything that wasn't me then we'd fall flat on our face which usually usually how it goes anyways but we'll get through it amen but determination is a firm resolution a settled purpose now you're going to get a specific thing done no matter what and you know as you look in the scriptures daniel had purpose in his heart not to eat the king's meat he followed that through to the end and we see that it was blessed and and we see today the thing that that is so bad for for our culture and our group of people in our age is is today we have so many choices is that right and that's why in today's age people seem to give up so easy the media has portrayed a picture that if something doesn't work the first time then try something new is that right and so we see that today there's over about 310 religions and denominations in the united states and the phrase under god can mean something different to members of approximately 313 religions or denominations in the united states and for monotheists who believe god is one to the judeo-christian traditions and the polytheists and those believe in many gods to others who believe and know god and or as god is represented by animal spirits and alien groups and uh and other things and and so we look and we see that that whenever we say under god people can have a different description of that and and they've determined in their hearts what god is is that right now we look here and as we go through and and what people don't like is is is figuring out one thing and um and following it through is that right and so we see that people come down today and if if um you know if if one restaurant doesn't suffice you you can go to the next restaurant if that one doesn't suffice you can go to the next restaurant and if this minister doesn't suffice you go to this minister and if this pastor doesn't suffice you go to that pastor and so we see that people have a lot more options today is that right you know back when it was a it was a horse and buggy times and and doing these things you know and going different places it was a lot harder to go somewhere else is that right once you went to town it wasn't that you you know maybe well i don't like this town so i'm going to go to the next town well that was a lot of extra work is that right and so what people do is when they just don't like something they just go to the next is that right people seem to have no determinations to six to stick through a situation now you look and you you look um and i look as as i used to work in the funeral home as joe does now and i was in denominational churches quite often and you look at the ministerial boards or the pastor boards or that and it's changing all the time you know they may have a pastor for a year too then have another pastor for a year or two or have another pastor for year two because when they get upset with a pastor they just complain to the board the board moves him to another church and then moves and it's just kind of like rotation you know and nobody's really determined to give someone enough time is that right that's why i believe you know as brother ben coming in being our new pastor we ought to as respectful as christians ought to allow that to take time and of course i love brother ben and definitely a big supporter of brother ben but we definitely should look at that and say you know i'm not going to jump ship just because he preached one sermon that i don't like we've got to determine in our hearts that we're going to follow through to the end is that right so you see if you if you look at this you know it's the opposite of everything that god taught in the scriptures just moving to this one moving to that one moving to this one and moving to that one if you didn't like this then go over here and so we see that that's the opposite of everything that god has ever showed us in the bible and and today one thing that i've noticed you know we have so many choices and and one of my examples i know i i always talk about my kids but man used to when i was going into the gas station with my grandma to pick out a snack there was like four or five options now there's like four or five options of each individual item you know it's like cheetos with doritos cheetos with pretzels cheetos with fiery flames and cheetos jalapeno flavored and so it's like 18 different options for one item is that right and it's like well we're gonna please this one please this one please this one and marketing has now developed a way to please everybody is that right amen do you love the lord tonight are you gonna stick with me just for a little bit longer i don't have my watch so i've been going about 15 minutes so halfway there hey man man i really thought i'd get some amens on that one but we see that that's how that's what's happened today is we just have too many choices to pick from and and i remember when i was a when i was a young kid in north carolina you know as us straight from arkansas over just straight through the bible belt you know on the way to church we drove through like past eight other message churches you know and you kind of just had your pick and there were some people who did that they would one month be in this one one month being that one one month being this one and so it's just kind of just a roundabout and and you kind of wonder and you kind of feel sorry for those people you know they're they just can't find anything that would please them and so as christians i don't think we ought to look for the pastor to please us although we ought to understand and have compassion upon the pastor but we ought to be looking for christ and be led by the holy spirit is that right because i believe this i believe brother branham says the spirit of god will never lead you where the grace of god can't keep you is that right so we see that when we're led by christ he's going to positionally place us in the bride in the body of christ where we need to be and then we've got to be determined as christians to stay steadfast in that position now now they they have churches for specific groups of people that they've even come out with now and i remember you know i love seeing cowboy churches and it's just a church not a denomination but just centralized around cowboys and they drive their cowboys to church or drive their horses drive their horses see that's the age that i live in they ride their horses to church and and so you see they ride the horse and buggies and they instead of saying amen they say yeehaw and i'm seeing this serious this is not a joke this actually happens and there's several around here actually and i've been to funerals instead of saying amen they say yee ha and it's just different but they've you know they've itemized and and changed church to where you know it can be you know whatever you want it to be and they've marketed church for a specific group or specific uh specification of people and what it's doing is is instead of changing the people to fit god they're changing the word and changing god and the scripture to fit the people and that's where if you ever try to change the word to fit you you're automatically wrong amen you've got to change yourself to fit him now we see this word adversity it means an event or series of events which which oppose success or desire it's misfortune calamity or affliction or distress it's a state of unhappiness now satan is the master of confusion is that right he has no truth in him there's no sure foundation so anything that he speaks is going to cause chaos and confusion now an adversity causes confusion now adversity you hear a lot in the church is when someone's in adversity a church is an adversity it means that the people are crying out against one another the people are against one another and i believe brother branham talks about that and says you know a fellowship is two people in the same boat row in the same direction is that right now you can have adversity in your work life you can have adversity in your home life you can have adversity in your church life it's all depending upon you and so tonight i know i talk about this a lot and but everything comes back to you now i i love and i know i'm i'm not doing away with the atonement or anything with what jesus christ did because i know everything he did at calvary settled it when he rose again and our names have been put on the book of life i know none of that changes but the life you live as a christian is determined specifically on how you focus your life you can actually brother branham says you can be a weak christian if you want to be a weak christian or you can be a person of strong faith if you want to be a person of strong faith now and just just to look here at some adversity and some different things and different options there's about 150 000 different medications that are in use currently and the number of prescriptions americans feel is about three and a half billion yearly so that's not including over-the-counter those are just prescribed drugs and these these facts are just a few years old and and so we see that there's so many many different medications today there's there's hundreds of medications now for headaches you know do you have a a frontal lobe headache is it behind the eye is it a tension headache is it a migraine headache and it seems like there's so many different options for headaches now and there's so many different options for this well we're gonna give you this medicine for heartburn but if it causes headaches and we're going to give you this medicine but this may cause stomach aches well then we got another one if it causes stomach aches and and so the things just go on and on and on and on and we see that there's hundreds of cough medicines and and there's medic there's medications with worse side effects than there actually is if you actually had the sickness and and so we see that life is all about decisions and life is about choices and and options and and the thing that options do is they get you distracted is that right now we see that people have lost their determination because they have lost their focus now you know it seems like people down to days they need sleep aids then they also need something to pick them up in the morning then they need common agents and they need something to raise their blood pressure they need something to get them excited and so you know i actually did that the other night i i don't take medicine very often i don't like to and you know i i don't like it now i do like caffeine i'm not going to lie about that i have recently switched to coffee and black coffee just just straight and and then but i don't like medication i like to take tylenol but i took these uh these zeke will melatonin tab tablets the other night and i don't dream but i had some vivid crazy dreams and it was just it was just weird and i i don't like being under the influence of that stuff and and i was telling my wife i was like well i slept really really good but i was busy all night you know i had this dream that we were in this airbnb and the owner kept coming in and waking us up and i was furious and that was all night eight and a half hours of that all night and and so it's like it didn't really help me much but but we see we have so many options and you can get just the melatonin gummies the melatonin drops and and it seems like well if you're not sleeping good take this well then i'm drugging in the morning we'll we'll take caffeine you got got caffeine pills we got energy drinks we got coffee and so it's constantly well like i need something to put me down i need something to pick me up and and we see in today's age you know i believe if people just had the determination just to push through just a little bit we can form our lives i believe it says it takes 21 days to create a habit in your life is that right and so we see that we've got we've got all different kinds of options but what we really need is god's help is that right now married married adults now divorced two and a half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago now in 40 and between 40 and 60 of new marriages will eventually end in divorce the the probability within the first five years is 20 and the probability of it ending within the first 10 years is 30 33 perhaps 25 percent of children ages 16 and under live with a step parent now this is a 2012 29 of those married in the united states are divorced before 10 years of marriage now it says here one thing that i that i found was was was neat to me and not that anything about divorce is need but the enrichment journal says that the divorce rate in america for the first marriage is 41 the second marriage is 60 and the third marriage is 73 percent so it shows you that a person that's been married one time has a 41 percent of divorce a second marriage is 60 and a third marriage is 73 and what this shows you is that once you start giving up it gets easier to give up so we see that with people who hop around from church to church it gets easier to move from church to church the more that you do it it gets easier to backslide the more that you do it it gets easier to lay out a church the more that you do it so we see that as christians the more that we step aside the more that we lose our focus and determination the easier it becomes to be distracted is that right so we see here that i'm just going to keep going on and and we see that the more that you doubt god the next time the easier it is to doubt god now there's a reverse effect to this too the more you believe god the easier it is the next time to trust god amen so i don't want to just focus on the bad tonight i always want to focus on the good but the more faith that you build in your life the easier it is to believe next time is that right you know the more that my family's healed the more that i'm healed the more the easier it is next time i go to ask god to know that he's able to heal us amen we see the rich young ruler he kid the sad thing about the rich young rulers he ran to christ he was urgently running to him to find exactly what he needed and maybe not what he wanted but exactly what he needed but you notice the thing about the rich young ruler is he went away sad but he continued on as he was he still went to church still did all these different things still did everything but he could not do the one thing that christ asked him that was to lay down everything he had and give to the poor take up his cross and follow him now we see that jesus stands at the door and knocks he is very determined to get to you but you've got to be determined once jesus gets a hold of you and i'm talking about the christian the saved holy ghost-filled christian tonight not not not we're not talking about new new christians coming in or or people that aren't filled with the holy ghost we're talking about the christian tonight that sits in this church that needs to be determined and focused on god so i'm not talking about anything else i'm talking about the christian life that you and i live it can be as good as you and i want it to be right your marriage will be as good as you determine it to be your work life will be as good as you determine it to be if you go in with a bad attitude bad things are going to happen if you wake up with a bad attitude and get an argument with your wife and purposely try to argue things are going to happen if you come to church matt at the minister matt at the preacher matthew deakins matt at the trustees mad at the la members bad things are going to happen you determine your christian walk you can't blame it on the pastor you can't blame it on the minister you can't do those things you've got to take responsibility for your life is that right i don't know who this is for maybe it's for me but you've got to start taking responsibility for your actions and not saying well i don't know why i don't know why i don't know why why is this happening why is this happening instead of saying that why don't you stand up and believe god and say this is what god promised me and this is what's going to happen amen now we see in matthew 24 and verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold and so that iniquity which we see is great in this age that iniquity that is abounding is distractions to you and i is that right so we see that because iniquity abounded because distractions abounded the love of many will wax cold he says but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved so he that will endure to the end he who will stay focused he will who is determined to make it to the end will be saved is that right he says i want to give you a warning right here he says it it says concerning the last days because of the abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold and laodicean or last age self-love or love of material things will take the place of the true love of god he says we need to guard against the power of sin in the last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effects of this last day spirit he said it's time to draw an eye and to god and let him fill our lives with his love or we will fill the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of god which is alone able to help us so he's saying here this is it the truth of god his word is the only thing that can help us is that right so we've got us we've got to be determined christians tonight we've got to be determined to see it through to the end now what keeps us what knocks us off of our determination or what knocks our focus away and that would be distractions is that right and there's so many distractions today and especially um you look in family life and you look in church life and and you look at work life and there's so many things to distract you you know you look at the apps on your phone and you see how many apps you have now as to where used to you know i remember the old which i know i say old and i'm only 33 but i still remember the the dial up phones it had the cord on it and and then i remember the first cell phone and i remember it it could almost vibrate your house down but but you see and you know you could maybe text maybe one sentence on it took you like four or five minutes to text out one thing you know you had to hit the one two three or the one three times to get to the c and then you if you wanted to go to the e you had to go to the three and hit it three times and or maybe hit it one time i can't remember but but you had to do all those things it was so much harder to be distracted you know if you wanted to be distracted you had to go somewhere but now you can pick up your phone and you can be distracted within seconds you can be on the other side of the world within seconds and and distractions are things that hinder determination and and we see in today's today's society that most of the people are distracted you know i remember the other day i forgot my phone and man it was so weird just walking around and looking at actual people in the face you know and and actually walking around and being like you know hey how you doing you know but everybody's looking down and everybody's doing this or doing that or they're on their phone or they're talking and and so you know we see that those things will will hinder us or those there's a distractions and and the world wants us to be distracted is that right and so we see that you know you can go to work and and you know it's it's so hard to hire people right now there's a lot of people who don't want jobs and there's plenty of jobs out there for people to give but but you look people are distracted and and you know i i have the i have the firm belief that if you if you're able to show up on time and you can breathe and and do a few odd things you can get a job right now is that right i mean it's it's a pretty evil easy playing field you know and i i kind of was thinking the other day if you know if i ever get fired i really think it's if i just show up on time that's that's better than 90 of the people you know and so it seems like but everybody's distracted well i was late because of this i was late because of this well i was up late because of this and i was doing this and everybody's distracted now there's some quotes i have for on distraction it says you can always find a distraction if you're looking for one and so you know i really try to do that when i come home with the with the kids from work and and jen's been with the kids all day and i really try not to be distracted but it's hard for me not to be distracted because i've tried not to be distracted at work so i'm like well i'll catch up on social media i'll do this i've got to do this i want to get on facebook marketplace and find the next thing that i want to buy and try to sell and lose money on and and so you know i want to do all those things but then i want to stay focused on the kids but there's all these distractions but it says you can always find a distraction if you're looking for one now christopher columbus said by prevailing over all obstacles and distractions one may unfillingly arrive at his chosen goal or destination so i believe when we can get past the distractions and and pass the obstacles in our life we can look and we can get to where we want to be as christians is that right and i think as christians we ought not to be happy with where we are we ought to always want to be a better christian you know maybe you say well you know i i do things good and this is not me talking because i struggle every day and and definitely need to be better than i am and want to attain to be more like christ and but maybe you know your your prayer life is good your family life is good you you know you you've got things in order your house is in order all these things are going good and the god has been good to you but you shouldn't just want to stay there amen you should want to be a better christian amen so it says uh the beverly hills says be aware when distractions come your way you'll know it's a distraction when you stop doing what you're supposed to be doing and you find yourself doing things that have no value so i think as christians we ought to really look and begin to say what has value what is what does god want me to be doing and many times you know we can have discussions and and there's discussions that you can have that have no value and what that means is no matter how which way the conversation goes it means nothing right just like if i wanted to talk to caleb about fishing tonight that has no value really added to our lives as far as value added to our families now you know i may say that i'm going to go catch us some fish you know and i'm like jen i'm going to go get us some some river you know some catfish from the river and i'm gonna trotline and jug it's gonna be you know fresh catfish and then i show up empty-handed you know i didn't do anything i may have been determined but i didn't stay until i caught a fish all right so if some of you were wondering why i wasn't here sunday it's because i was trying to fish in the rain all day saturday and sunday got a head cold that brought no value to my life because it caused me to miss church all right some of you are like oh i can't believe you're telling that but hey it happened i did it it takes brother ben i'm like it's my own fault but i fished all day saturday got wet cold fished through the night and did me no good i'm still kind of running have a runny nose and stuff from it but it did no value to my family they really got no fish from it but i was determined to catch a fish but i put out the trot line friday night after work and then the next day it rained all night and then the trotline at the river come up and so i had to go out there and get the trotline and get the limb lines and and and do all this stuff and no fish on it of course and you know then go and jug fish and well then i get out there and i'm like oh man you know it's been a long day i was out all you know out out at night and it's like well i'll go back home and rest then come back out and sure enough still no fish and caught a few small fish on the rod and reel but nothing that was substantial in my family it brought no value to my family all that work now it was good for me to get away from people probably and and and just enjoy it you know um but we see that there's things you can do that have no value right you know i was away from my family i was doing this or doing that and maybe i could have been at home and and doing more things with them and and maybe added value to their day but you look at your life and you can say you know this conversation or talking about this person does it add value you know are you just talking bad about someone to be talking about about someone are you actually praying for someone or or fervently trying to to to be there for someone or you just want to find out gossip we need to as christians to look at our lives and say does this add value to the church you know does this add value to my christian walk does this add value to the to the church body or to the bride body as a whole what am i what i'm doing does it add value to my life and as a christian and i believe as christians once we begin to look at that and we begin to say and and start to say you know is this christ like is it and you know the old saying what would jesus do remember the bracelets wwjd and you begin to look and and you begin to say you know if this adds value to my life then that's something that i want to focus on and that's something i want to do now in 2012 the average attention span was eight seconds and so we've seen that it's drastically gone down now you look at advertisements and if they don't flash something new within a few seconds you lose focus and you swipe right you just keep on going because that advertisement did not did not did not suit you but you look at the average attention span in 2012 was eight seconds it's much lower now um from the time that i actually did that study so we see that this age is so unfocused that that that one day people persons are vegetarian then they're not then they're back to vegetarian then they only eat meat they're carnivores and then they're back to just eating whatever and then you see people who are in church and they're hardcore they want to do everything for the church and then they're out and they're gone nobody can find them and then they're back in and we see that people are so wishy-washy they can't stay focused on one thing is that right and so we know that as christians our purpose is to fulfill god's worst word for first and foremost is that right as christians our goal in this age is to fulfill his word everything that he wrote in there about you and i it's our job it's our duty as christians it should be our desire to fulfill the word of god is that right first corinthians 15 and 58 and i'll just close up just here in a few minutes and he says therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast and unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord so i think that's one thing as christians we ought to remember as the bride of jesus christ what we do when we serve the lord when we raise our hands when we don't feel like it when we sing when we don't feel like it that is not done in vain god sees everything every tear you've cried god sees that tonight is that right hebrews 3 4 3 and verse 14 for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end so i love that scripture there for we are made partakers of christ if there's that little big word if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end have you ever started a project and i know i have many projects started it and i've been so steadfast the beginning but i slowly wither out going through it especially if it's a honeydew list and and jen wants me to build something i start out and i'm like yes i can do it and about you know day two i'm like this is the worst thing ever i would rather go be run over by a horse or something than have to do this and so but as as christians we cannot do that our confidence has to be just as steadfast at the end as it was at the beginning do you believe that we must be steadfast we can't be looking to the left we can't be looking to the right we have to stay focused on christ so brother abraham says and look in 1963 he says you know what's the matter with the church is today he says we we give up too quick and that's what he says that's what's the matter with the church is today and i believe in 63 that's the same in 2021 we give up too quick when something doesn't go our way or something doesn't turn out the way we think it ought to turn out we give up and i cannot stand that's one of my worst things is is when people leave the message or they leave the scripture or they or they they leave they leave god all together and they blame it on somebody else all i say to those people is you were looking at the wrong thing right if you leave because someone else you were looking at someone else if you don't if you if you if you leave and you can you can leave clean it was never in you is that right but if you're looking at christ if you're looking at christ and what and that deep's calling to the deep there's a seed on the inside of you you can't leave no matter what anybody does amen but when somebody tells you they left church because somebody did this you just ignore them because they didn't have it in the first place they weren't looking at the right thing they didn't have the seed of god in or they may have the seed of god in them we're not going to give up on them but they've got to come to fruition that seeds got to have that deep calling to the deep is that right amen but sorry that just gets me real bad when somebody says well i just just because what this one person did i just can't believe what you believed because of what they did i'm like you're absolutely right you cannot believe it because you were looking at the wrong thing and as christians we've got to say steadfast we give up too quick elijah stayed there and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed until something happened and when he felt that little trinkle come down in his heart he said i hear the sound of an abundance of rain he said if men and women in here who wants christ or the holy ghost who wants to be healed if they would just stay there and say lord you promised it he said and then they fill that little trickle say here it is lord i accept it something is going to happen man do you believe that you can't just ask god for something to happen expect it to happen in the in the snap of a finger but you've got to stay there you've got to wait on the lord is that right and that's the thing in today's age we are being trained to give up we're being trained to try something new but we cannot let that into our spiritual life is that right now we cannot give up too quick if we're fighting a battle if we're fighting we want to fight to the end amen romans 8 and 37 just a few more minutes nay in all things we are more than conquerors in him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power nor things present or things to come nor hide or death or any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord and that's saying right there no one can talk you out of it because nobody talked you into it is that right you had a spiritual revelation you had a spiritual relationship with jesus christ when the holy ghost come on the inside of you there was no one who could tell you that it was not true is that right you will be unmovable and that's what satan hates he wants us to be confused he wants us to be troubled he wants us to be distracted but whenever god gets someone so focused on him satan don't know what to do with him is that right but in christ there's no confusion there's only peace that's why the scripture says it's the peace that passes understanding when everything around you when everything in the world is going wrong we as christians we have that peace that passes understanding maybe you and i don't even understand it but it's that peace that christ puts on the inside of us when we're sealed under the day of our redemption but we have to be determined is that right so we look here and it says finally ephesians 6 and 10 finally my brethren be strong in the lord in the power of his might it says put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for you we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and against the rulers of darkness of this world and against spiritual wickedness in high places it says wherefore taken to you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand in that evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about you with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and i love that it's a gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance of the supplication for all saints so we see here that we must put on the whole armor of god and in the power of his might and we must stay steadfast until the end is that right now the marriage of the lamb brother brahman says in 1962 the same way it is about divine healing god has got the power to heal you if you've got the courage to accept it he says but you'll fight every inch of the way so we know that the the courage doesn't lie within god he has the power to heal you but you've got to have the courage to accept it and you'll fight every inch of the way he says god has an amazing grace to save you and he will do it but you'll fight every inch of your way he said i've been behind the pulpit going on 31 years and every inch of that has been a fight constantly he said certainly it has but we must fight if we must reign he says so when we find out the bride has to make herself ready we've got to be willing to lay aside every sin that does so easily beset us that we might run this race with patience that is set before us we must lay aside our self and i'll focus on that we must lay aside our self and i think that's the hardest thing to get out of the way is ourself is that right many times you know before i come to the pulpit i begin to look at everything that i have done everything that i've done wrong and everything that i've done this or i've done that and that's the way i guess i i get before i preach and and i begin to look at all the faults in me but i begin to remember that i've got to get myself out of the way and it's christ that's going to come down and speak to his people is that right we can't say god you come lay them aside for us we've got to do that ourselves is that right god's not going to come down and lay this aside and lay that aside you've got to be determined in your life to lay that sin aside and let god take full control in your life is that right amen do you love the lord this evening amen we must be determined people amen i think that's the worst thing to see is someone that's really wishy-washy you know and that's that's that's one thing i love about my wife is she's she's been constant throughout her life you know i've i've probably been on every diet fad and workout fad that's been here i i change i move around a little bit now i'm steadfast on certain things but that's one thing i love about my wife is she's been the same from day one until till now and i love meeting people that are that way and some of you are that way i've met you and i've seen you maybe for for 20 years since i've been here and some of you have been the same from day one not that you haven't grown your christian wong but you've been the same you've been steadfast you've been constant you've been determined that you're not going to let the world change you you're not going to let the world move you from the way that you ought to be as a christian you're not going to let things that happen in the church things that happen in the pulpit you're not going to let any of that move you and that says a lot about your determination and your spiritual walk with christ i would rather see somebody that's determined and that stayed on the front line for year after year than somebody that's shouting somebody that's singing somebody that's running around the church i'd rather see somebody that's been steadfast day in and day out day in and day out that's stood through the test of time is that right not that anything of that is wrong running around the church or shouting and screaming we love those moments we love those times and they are needed and it's the way we can share our victory and and prove to satan that we have the victory and i definitely don't want to say anything against those but i want to see christians that come back to church after the shouting's over amen when the evangelists that can they can that can fire us up and the spirit of god come and you feel so good and you just feel like you're invincible but you want to see those christians that can last when they don't feel anything is that right because we don't go based off of feelings we go based off of the holy spirit in our life we go based off of the promise that christ has given us is that right so we see that to be determined in your life it means that you're going to be determined and nothing else is going to move you nothing's going to shake you you're not going to be defeated you're not going to let satan come in you're going to be determined and steadfast to the end is that right now brother branham says in god perfecting his church he says be determined don't be defeated he says you can't be defeated you're the children of god god promised the holy spirit to every believer he wants to give it to you tonight more than you want to receive it now he goes on and says and now son of david he says he says he's talking about brother branham was talking about a little bit of his testimony here and he says remember the lord healed my stomach trouble and the devil said you haven't been healed and i said just stick around and listen to me testify then he says if you want he said if you want to hear god be praised just stick around and listen to me a while and he got tired and he went on his way he said so he will do it the other day he tried to give me a bad cold he handed it to me and i give it back to him he handed it to me again i give it back to him and we just fought on it for three or four days and finally it went away he said so there you are just keep handing it back to him just don't receive it give it back to him and give it back to him and that's the way you do it just be determined hold on so we see it as christians if satan tries to give you something as the famous analogy brother joel 40 does he tries to give you a box of rattlesnakes you don't want it give it back amen is that right brother brahman says and i'm just coming to a close here just in a second 64 in shalom and arizona brother brown or in in sierra vista arizona brother braham says so for the new year be determined to stay with his word and what's what it's promised he said like others elected he said did in other days if you feel that you've seen the light that's broke through upon you and jesus christ his manifestation of the great holy spirit in these last days and remember stay with it just as he did he said you are the one he elected and what he he said he elected in other days like abraham when he saw it when he was against all scientific proof and noah saw it and it was against all scientific proof and moses saw it and it was against all scientific proof he said these smart ages that's gone by but the elected who saw it stood firm amen amen do you love the lord this evening matthew 9 20 behold or excuse me no i went to the wrong one and these people they were determined no matter what it looked like they were not backing down they were not giving up and so as christians when we begin to become steadfast on the word of god you know satan's not going to recognize anything but your faith in the word of god is that right he's going to know when you're bluffing when you don't have faith if i was up here and you know i was gonna say something and i didn't have faith behind it satan would know that the enemy would know that when you pray satan would know if you were praying from faith or praying out of fear or praying out of maybe self-motive or self-righteousness or doing this or that but satan's going to know him and when the rubber meets the road you know you won't want to be standing there without faith in what you what you're saying is that right so we must be determined as christians and as believers of jesus christ we've got to be determined to say steadfast and to the end until we make that rapture is that right i mean as the musicians come we'll just kind of wind down with this and and as christians there's so many things that can get us distracted and so many things that can pull us from the to the left and pull us to the right and and i think the greatest testimony that we can have is that we stand true to the word of god is that right as a christian you know i i know many times i've i've failed and and failed over and over again and maybe i've done things that the that you shouldn't do or but remember god is bringing you into that perfect bride that you're you're coming into perfection is that right and i think many times this age has taught us that if we don't get perfected or we don't have everything figured out in the first few minutes then we're not good enough you know if you're not this or you're not that when everything's minute everything's really fast everything happens at light speed now and and and you look at that and and and christ doesn't move at the speed of people at what we think christ ought to move at god moves in his own time and that's something you and i will never be able to explain we can't put a timeline on and say well this is what god said this is exactly when it's going to happen or this is when my life's going to be perfect this is what god's going to do brother brahma says it would be a fight every inch of the way but if you're determined and you're steadfast god will see you through to the end do you believe that amen we definitely love the lord and just thankful for all that he's done for us and and just so happy we could come out to the house of the lord tonight and and and just worship with believers of like precious faith and uh you know we we we really appreciate our pastor my brother ben's done and that's one thing you know i you you never want to do is when a new pastor comes in is just jump up and leave ship amen we want to give we want to give the will of god we want to give the will of the lord time to come and show that it's fruitful and and see that god has blessed it i believe that as a church we've done a really good job of that and and god has blessed us for that and blessed our pastor and and and done great things for the church here and and we're really thankful for what god has done for us is that right amen but i believe that's because we've been determined we weren't going to give up we weren't going to be distracted we weren't going to be swayed but we're going to stick through to the end because we weren't looking at this one we weren't looking at that one but we're focused on christ is that right and i believe god will you know a lot of people like to see rewards given right now you know you get somebody uh you hire somebody new and they want to be the ceo within a week you know and that's just not the way it works and i've had to figure that out the hard way because i was that way you know i wanted to go straight to the top until i seen what the top had to deal with and and so you know you you look and you can't just become this overnight god is working he's trying he's purifying his gold it comes service after service god's going to take this this minister and he's going to purify us this way and he's going to bring this ministry and he's going to purify us this way and i think as christians we couldn't get distracted and say well my christian life's not where his is or hers is and i don't do the things that they do but just stay focused on him and he'll see you through to the end do you believe that amen let's just sing that song if we could he set me free i believe it's in the key of g brother dave if you want to come and i'll sing a verse or two and then you can close out the service if you don't mind amen once like a bird in prison i dwell no freedom from my sorrow then jesus came and listened to me glory to god he set me free yes he set me free glory to god you know he said we forgot to stand together now i am climbing higher each day darkness of night has drifted away my feet are planted on higher [Music] he set me free yes he set me free he broke the bonds of prison for me well i'm glory bound by jesus singing glory to god he set [Music] not of this world will turn me around daily i'm working i'm praying too and amen he carried his plan out in this church it's a glorious church i didn't join know i was born i've had a new birth some glorious day gonna sail away it's by his grace amen do that verse again now when jesus came he was left out there was no place where he was welcome here on earth nobody had a plan for a house that shall forever stand he spoke these words upon this rock build my church i'm in this church it's a glorious church i didn't join no i was born i've had a new birth some glorious day amen you can be dismissed tonight amen thankful for the word this evening take it home with you tonight amen keep brother being in prayers they travel home tomorrow in this church it's a glorious church didn't joy know i was born i've had a new birth some glorious day gonna sail away it's by his grace not
