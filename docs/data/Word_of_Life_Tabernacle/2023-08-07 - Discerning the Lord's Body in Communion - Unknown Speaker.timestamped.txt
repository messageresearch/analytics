[35:18] the way life used to be

[35:30] I'd spend my day
[35:35] without measure into a little
[35:39] treasure box I thought I'd found
[35:47] until the day when Jesus came to me and

[38:41] I'm thankful when he looks at me he
[38:43] looks at the blood and see something

[43:50] thank you for it tonight we love you We
[43:53] Worship You O Lord
[43:55] thank you
[44:03] Lord Jesus
[44:05] oh isn't he good to his church
[44:08] is more than we could ever ask or think
[44:11] and blessed abundantly thank you for
[44:13] being here tonight First Corinthians 11
[44:15] 28
[44:17] it's going to take about 20 or 30
[44:19] minutes and we'll go into the communion
[44:21] service
[44:24] Corinthians 11 28.
[44:27] we'll read the rest of this when the
[44:29] time comes for communion but just these
[44:31] two verses let a man examine himself and
[44:35] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[44:36] of that cup
[44:38] for he that eateth and drinketh
[44:40] unworthily Edith and drinketh
[44:43] damnation to himself
[44:45] not discerning
[44:47] the Lord's body
[44:49] amen I want to speak on that Discerning
[44:52] the Lord's body if you have your seats
[44:58] each one of us must discern the body of
[45:02] the Lord
[45:03] and our place in it
[45:06] by examining ourselves in the mirror of
[45:09] God's word when we're talking about
[45:11] Discerning the Lord's body think of it
[45:14] like this if the room was dark you
[45:17] couldn't see the bodies of the people
[45:20] that were in the room but once light has
[45:23] come begin to be able to see that the
[45:27] people there are there are people in the
[45:28] room and as the light comes stronger you
[45:32] begin to see who they are and and what
[45:34] they do and what they mean to you and so
[45:37] we discern the Lord's body we're
[45:39] Discerning what the body of Christ did
[45:42] for us we're also Discerning who the
[45:44] body of Christ is and our place in it
[45:47] and and so it's very needful what we're
[45:50] doing tonight is an order of God for the
[45:53] church that it causes us to come
[45:56] together and and sit in the presence of
[45:58] God and examine ourselves brother Bill
[46:01] am I in the faith dude do am I a
[46:04] Believer am I am I just a pretender or
[46:08] am I a real Christian and and so we
[46:11] examine ourselves each one of us not I'm
[46:13] not me Examining you or you examining me
[46:16] but each one of us individually we
[46:18] examine ourselves and see what our place
[46:21] is in the party brother Brandon teaches
[46:23] us he said our Eternal destination is
[46:26] not altogether determined by what we see
[46:29] or what we hear but it's determined on
[46:32] what discernment we have of what we see
[46:35] and what we hear
[46:37] right now that's important it's not what
[46:39] we see or what we even hear but it's our
[46:42] discernment of what we see and what we
[46:45] hear
[46:45] so he said Paul was not disputing with
[46:48] them for taking the communion their act
[46:51] was right but their discernment was
[46:54] wrong yeah
[46:55] active communion was right but the
[46:57] discernment that they had was wrong for
[46:59] taking the Lord's Supper is the
[47:01] Commandment of the Lord but to take it
[47:04] unworthily not Discerning the Lord's
[47:06] body is we're the wrong lane
[47:09] excuse me these Christians were taking
[47:11] the communion and not living the life
[47:14] yeah Christianity is an experience and
[47:17] the life how many believe that tonight
[47:19] it's an experience and a life and these
[47:22] Christians were living any kind of a
[47:24] life making a poor example of their
[47:27] profession
[47:28] and so we need to be careful what
[47:30] example that we've set maybe something
[47:32] wouldn't be wrong for us personally we
[47:34] don't feel any condemnation but we know
[47:37] the church teaches against it or brother
[47:39] Brandon said something about it and for
[47:41] ourselves you say well I I don't see
[47:43] anything wrong with it but we should
[47:44] discern the Lord's body in staying away
[47:47] from even the the thing that would hurt
[47:49] somebody else or or stumble someone else
[47:52] we would not put a stumbling block in
[47:54] somebody else's way
[47:56] so the Christians were taking communion
[47:58] but not living the life and he said
[48:00] making a poor example of their
[48:02] profession and Paul said that this
[48:04] caused many are sick and weak weak among
[48:06] you and many are asleep which means
[48:08] they're dead because they haven't
[48:09] discerned the body of the Lord so it's
[48:12] important that we discern the body of
[48:15] the Lord
[48:16] we read this last week but it fits here
[48:18] it's very important
[48:20] the Branham said the discernment of
[48:21] knowing that you are the Lord's body
[48:24] he said you can't discern it in
[48:26] wickedness and sin we've got to be above
[48:29] that yeah we discern
[48:31] that the Lord is righteous
[48:34] we discern he's our propitiation how
[48:37] many have discerned the body of the Lord
[48:38] tonight
[48:39] that all of our sins we've confessed and
[48:42] we believe in him of waiting upon his
[48:45] atonement to cleanse us from all our
[48:48] iniquity he said then we're Discerning
[48:50] the Lord's body to what it is and
[48:52] discernment of what it's for he said and
[48:55] then Discerning again that in among us
[48:58] as the Lord's bride body he said let's
[49:01] discern if there's anything wrong with
[49:03] us and hear that would hinder the gospel
[49:06] from growing or the Lord from presenting
[49:08] us before God as a chaste virgin he said
[49:12] let's discern that out right now
[49:15] what was it it was communion night yeah
[49:17] yeah let's discern it out right now oh
[49:20] why can't we do that tonight let's just
[49:21] discern it out right now he said who
[49:23] should I deserve yourself
[49:25] discern that out am I am I a hindrance
[49:28] to the body of God if so Lord let me
[49:30] repent of that it doesn't mean I
[49:32] shouldn't take communion it means I
[49:33] should repent and then take communion
[49:35] and then go make it right wherever I
[49:37] need to make it right
[49:39] hey man if you really repent you'll
[49:42] you'll make it right
[49:45] so notice he said if there's anything
[49:47] wrong that would hinder the gospel from
[49:50] growing let's discern that out right now
[49:52] and find if it's wrong let's confess it
[49:54] if it's wrong and let's say Lord I'm
[49:56] sorry about that
[49:59] see we have to discern the Lord's body
[50:03] in order to care for it
[50:06] you've got to discern the Lord's body to
[50:08] care for it
[50:11] so he says this he said the Lord's body
[50:14] is the church
[50:15] we do not have spiritual discernment
[50:18] enough to care for one another
[50:20] he said how can we care then if we can't
[50:23] care for each other so it's a problem he
[50:26] says how are we going to care for the
[50:28] outsider how can we care for the lost
[50:30] and dying what hospital can we take them
[50:33] to he said cast our cares upon Him for
[50:36] he cares for you but how can we do that
[50:38] how can we care for those outside if we
[50:41] cannot care for one another so he Ties
[50:43] That to Discerning the Lord's body when
[50:46] you discern the people that are in the
[50:48] room then you begin to care for those
[50:50] people yeah
[50:52] right if you if you heard that somebody
[50:55] was in a car wreck
[50:56] and you have a certain amount of concern
[50:59] for that but if you could discern uh if
[51:02] you found a name or saw a picture and
[51:05] you discerned that that was somebody you
[51:06] knew
[51:07] there's a different level of care yeah
[51:10] that is attributed to that and that's
[51:12] why we should we should Fellowship
[51:14] together we should know one another
[51:15] because there's a Discerning of the
[51:18] Lord's body that goes along with that in
[51:20] carrying one for the other we discern
[51:22] the Lord's body for Fellowship
[51:25] yeah right in in First Corinthians 10 16
[51:27] he said the cup of blessing which we
[51:29] bless is it not the communion and what
[51:32] does the word communion mean Fellowship
[51:34] yeah that's how it's translated actually
[51:35] most times in the scripture the same
[51:37] word Koinonia we've talked about it
[51:39] before Koinonia is the word for
[51:41] fellowship or communion or sharing or
[51:43] participation
[51:45] solidarity commonality shared
[51:47] responsibility
[51:49] right so communion is more than just
[51:52] just wine and bread but communion is
[51:55] fellowship
[51:56] he said the bread which we break is it
[51:57] not the communion of the body of Christ
[52:01] in Acts 2 42 the Bible tells us they
[52:03] continue to steadfastly in the apostles
[52:05] Doctrine and communion that's the same
[52:08] word
[52:08] in first John 1 6 if we say that we have
[52:11] communion with him fellowship with him
[52:13] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[52:15] the truth
[52:16] but if we walk in the light as he are
[52:19] you glad to be walking in the light
[52:20] tonight if we walk in the light as he is
[52:23] in the light we have communion one with
[52:25] another
[52:26] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[52:28] cleanses us from all sin
[52:32] so communion then is a revelation of the
[52:35] Lord's body
[52:36] did you say it that way communion if
[52:39] it's properly done is a revelation of
[52:41] the Lord's body it's going to reveal to
[52:44] me the benefits of that body and what it
[52:46] meant to me when it was broken when it
[52:49] was wounded
[52:50] right but it's also a revelation of the
[52:52] Lord's body on the earth that it reveals
[52:54] to me who the Lord's body is
[52:57] because when we gather together we take
[52:59] communion Christians take communion what
[53:03] you're saying when you walk up here
[53:04] before the table and you walk in front
[53:06] of the pastor and we're taking communion
[53:08] publicly we do that because what we're
[53:11] saying is I'm a Christian I'm I've
[53:14] tested myself
[53:16] because brother random Thomas we have
[53:17] open communion not closed communion so
[53:19] it's not me telling you you're a
[53:21] Christian but it's you telling yourself
[53:24] you say I'm a Christian I can take
[53:26] communion yes
[53:27] yes and if we're not a Christian we
[53:29] shouldn't take communion right
[53:31] right but if we are a Christian you say
[53:32] well how can I become a Christian repent
[53:34] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[53:36] for the remission of sin you receive the
[53:38] gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:40] so if you are a Christian you take
[53:42] communion and you are stating you're
[53:44] making a statement I'm a Christian I
[53:46] belong in this body yeah
[53:49] right oh my it's a big statement but by
[53:53] doing that when I see you come and take
[53:55] communion it helps me discern who the
[53:57] Lord's body is
[54:01] all right it helps you discern who the
[54:03] Lord's body is because they're taking
[54:05] communion with us we take we don't have
[54:07] membership we don't have anything like
[54:09] that but the communion is away so we can
[54:11] identify the Lord's body
[54:14] but the brown said is this communion
[54:15] just something I go up for it and Order
[54:17] say well the rest of them take this I
[54:19] will too that's not the way to take it
[54:21] he said it's a revelation
[54:24] that I am part of him
[54:28] I'm not just saying these things but
[54:29] random taught us this
[54:31] he said it's a revelation that I am part
[54:33] of him
[54:34] and I'm part of you
[54:37] so communion oh we maybe you didn't
[54:40] realize this but communion when you take
[54:42] it it's a revelation to me that you are
[54:45] a Christian
[54:46] it's a revelation that you're a part of
[54:48] the body
[54:49] are you with me now it's a revelation
[54:52] I'm part of him and I'm part of you
[54:55] so he said and I love you
[54:57] and I love him
[54:59] he said and we're taking this together
[55:01] as a symbol of our love to God and our
[55:04] love and fellowship with one another
[55:06] so it means I love you and I love him so
[55:09] when I take communion I don't carry
[55:11] grudges
[55:15] I don't carry a bad temper
[55:18] I don't care we shouldn't carry uh uh
[55:20] kind of a say well I got I got kind of
[55:22] upset at that brother we don't carry
[55:24] that to the communion table
[55:26] why because communion says whatever you
[55:29] did it's under the blood
[55:31] I'm under the blood you're under the
[55:33] blood and together we're going to take
[55:34] communion
[55:35] you see it tonight it's a revelation
[55:39] I'm a Child of God
[55:41] see and then when we discern the Lord's
[55:42] body we no longer fellowship with sin
[55:45] this is what second Corinthians 6 14
[55:47] tells us he said be not unequally yoked
[55:49] together with unbelievers for what
[55:50] Fellowship communion righteousness with
[55:52] unrighteousness what communion light
[55:55] with Darkness
[55:56] so now he's saying that if you're if
[55:58] you're in communion with God this is
[56:01] just a type but if you're in communion
[56:03] with God if you're a Christian what it
[56:06] means is that as you fellowship with
[56:09] Christ you have fellowship with him
[56:11] because you agree with him
[56:13] your life agrees with his word you have
[56:16] fellowship with those of like Precious
[56:18] Faith because you have agreement you're
[56:20] not unequally yoked with a church that
[56:23] you say well that church is is all right
[56:25] but they teach the Trinity they teach
[56:26] all these things Isn't it nice to take
[56:28] communion with people that believe the
[56:30] same message we do they may not see
[56:32] everything just exactly like every
[56:34] little thing like we see it but yet
[56:35] we're taking communion together we ought
[56:37] to take communion if we can with other
[56:40] believers
[56:42] because then we have agreement how can
[56:44] two walk together unless they agree
[56:45] Fellowship is based on agreement he said
[56:48] our agreement with God now what is our
[56:51] agreement with God
[56:53] now think about it
[56:55] God cannot come in agreement with us
[56:58] The Way We Were
[57:00] he could not walk with us the life we
[57:04] lived he could not walk with that we
[57:06] were Sinners without hope so what does
[57:09] he do he shed his own blood
[57:11] now there's the gospel Christ shed his
[57:14] own blood so he could have agreement
[57:16] with us
[57:17] so he could have communion with us
[57:19] so when we discern the body and blood of
[57:22] the Lord discern what communion is for
[57:23] it shows us that it's for Fellowship we
[57:26] now have agreement
[57:27] the blood brings us to agreement amen he
[57:31] said now when God made man in the
[57:32] beginning to fellowship with him he said
[57:34] then this man was in perfect Fellowship
[57:36] in the Garden of Eden he was in perfect
[57:37] fellowship with God and how it must have
[57:40] been on that day when God would come
[57:41] down to the cool of the evening and call
[57:43] Adam he and Eve would come up they would
[57:45] worship God they would fellowship and
[57:47] commune one with the other he said
[57:48] that's the very thing that calls us
[57:50] together like this
[57:52] Oh my he said sitting together in
[57:54] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[57:56] fellowshipping in the Holy Spirit no
[57:58] difference in US
[58:00] oh I wish I could preach that I just
[58:03] about don't have any voice at all
[58:04] tonight church but there's no difference
[58:06] in US
[58:08] no difference We Are All One in Christ
[58:11] with a communion table this level yeah
[58:13] right we come up here we're all the same
[58:17] no matter what our pastor's been no
[58:19] matter what yesterday was no matter what
[58:21] you're coming to the community you say
[58:22] I'm a Christian you're a Christian no
[58:24] big eyes and little youth but we're
[58:25] coming together
[58:27] we're a body all right
[58:29] oh do you love him tonight
[58:31] he's provided this for us as a visible
[58:33] way we can discern the Lord's body
[58:36] so we're sitting in Heavenly places no
[58:38] difference in us nothing like it he said
[58:40] I've ever found on the earth is to come
[58:42] together in Heavenly places and have
[58:44] communion fellowship with god with each
[58:47] other
[58:48] he said that's what God intended in the
[58:49] Garden of Eden
[58:52] and that Fellowship from God and man was
[58:54] broken by sin now God made a basis in
[58:56] the ground upon which man could remain
[58:58] and retain his Fellowship it wasn't
[59:00] through a get-together organization or
[59:01] an education it was on the basis of the
[59:04] shed blood that's the only place a
[59:06] fellowship we have with God today the
[59:07] only meaning place is through the blood
[59:09] of Jesus Christ
[59:11] he said now we've tried organizing the
[59:12] fellowship you break off with another
[59:14] group when you do that he said all right
[59:16] we try to educate them Fellowship what
[59:17] do we get we get a bunch of educated
[59:19] idiots
[59:20] uh Prophet said it wasn't me yeah
[59:22] it's quote
[59:25] men just educate themselves so they
[59:28] educate themselves away from one another
[59:30] they get complexes he said you don't get
[59:32] no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:34] you get love
[59:36] yeah you get love not a complex and I'm
[59:38] a little bigger than somebody else a
[59:39] little better than somebody else you
[59:41] know a little more than somebody else
[59:42] you just got your arms around everybody
[59:43] it's a basis of Love through the blood
[59:45] he said the blood cleanses yeah
[59:48] Fellowship comes by love love requires
[59:50] Fellowship he said if you love your wife
[59:52] you just got to get with her and talk
[59:53] with her if you love your friend you've
[59:55] got to get with him and talk with him
[59:57] if you love God there's got to be a
[59:59] basis for Fellowship you cannot have
[1:00:01] complete fellowship and livelihood he
[1:00:03] said without these agreements you cannot
[1:00:05] have fellowship with god without coming
[1:00:07] to God's agreement there's a basic thing
[1:00:09] for fellowship and that's the blood but
[1:00:11] only it's been God's way from the
[1:00:13] beginning it will be till the end the
[1:00:15] only place that Fellowship is through
[1:00:16] the blood
[1:00:17] you could not meet with us an
[1:00:19] organization he could not meet with us
[1:00:20] as an intellectual group he can only
[1:00:22] meet with us as we have Fellowship as we
[1:00:24] come under the shed blood of his son
[1:00:26] Jesus Christ that's the only basic place
[1:00:29] that we can meet
[1:00:30] all right then that makes us we don't we
[1:00:32] don't war with our brothers and sisters
[1:00:34] we're just a part of those who have
[1:00:35] Fellowship under the blood
[1:00:37] are you with me now I'm almost done
[1:00:42] that God dwells with Fellowship
[1:00:44] under the shed blood of his son and that
[1:00:47] alone someone say that alone
[1:00:49] not Upon Our denomination or affiliation
[1:00:52] but upon the shed blood we meet God face
[1:00:55] to face
[1:00:56] think of job and his friends remember
[1:00:58] his friends kept coming to him it wasn't
[1:01:00] very good communion was it had a
[1:01:03] communion service now come around and
[1:01:04] said job's a sinner
[1:01:08] oh job he's done something bad
[1:01:10] you see job man he wasn't at church
[1:01:12] Wednesday night boy
[1:01:14] tell you what you've been doing
[1:01:15] something wrong God judged him
[1:01:21] that's not what we do to one another
[1:01:24] that's right we have communion when we
[1:01:25] have communion we're all in the same
[1:01:27] level why and job knew he hadn't done
[1:01:29] anything wrong why brother Brown says
[1:01:31] because he knew he did what God required
[1:01:35] he offered a lamb
[1:01:37] and and you know if you've come to God
[1:01:39] you know that you asked God to forgive
[1:01:42] you
[1:01:43] right and so I can't sit there on
[1:01:45] communion time at Communion time and be
[1:01:47] a job's friend and tell you well you it
[1:01:49] must be that's happening to you because
[1:01:51] of something you did no you say I come
[1:01:53] into the shed blood
[1:01:55] and so Brothers said for job to admit or
[1:01:57] say that he was a sinner would be to
[1:01:59] deny his sacrifice
[1:02:01] so he couldn't do that he said our
[1:02:02] fellowship now listen listen to this our
[1:02:05] fellowship is not upon the basis of how
[1:02:07] much God prospers us
[1:02:09] but on the basis of coming under the
[1:02:11] shed blood and fellowship with one
[1:02:13] another that's why a person who makes
[1:02:15] half a million dollars a year can
[1:02:16] follows you with somebody who makes five
[1:02:18] thousand dollars a year
[1:02:21] a person who's got a nice truck can
[1:02:23] fellowship with somebody who's got a not
[1:02:25] nice truck
[1:02:26] or no truck at all why because you come
[1:02:29] together under communion everything's
[1:02:31] level you're one with one another
[1:02:34] not your denomination or affiliation not
[1:02:37] how much money you have not on the basis
[1:02:38] of how much God prospers you but on the
[1:02:40] basis of coming under the shed blood and
[1:02:42] fellowship with one another here's where
[1:02:44] the real part of Christianity Lays he
[1:02:46] said that's what makes these meetings so
[1:02:48] real that when people come into those
[1:02:49] basis of the shed blood we have things
[1:02:51] in common we sit in Heavenly places
[1:02:55] think about this for a moment when Jesus
[1:02:57] disciples were at the Last Supper
[1:02:59] they come from all different backgrounds
[1:03:01] occupation some majority of them were
[1:03:03] fishermen but some were tax collectors
[1:03:05] and other things farmers
[1:03:08] different things that they were
[1:03:10] but they were all there
[1:03:12] even Judas was there
[1:03:16] now watch now brother Brandon taught us
[1:03:18] every Christian has a duty to take
[1:03:19] communion
[1:03:21] do you know he taught that he said I
[1:03:23] truly think it's the duty of every
[1:03:24] Christian to take communion
[1:03:25] the Bible said if you take this note you
[1:03:27] have no part with me and I'm not I'm not
[1:03:28] going to make you feel bad tonight if
[1:03:30] you're gone you couldn't take it I know
[1:03:31] some of some folks got sick and uh
[1:03:34] brother Allen's wife wasn't feeling good
[1:03:36] we need to pray for her tonight and I
[1:03:38] believe there's healing in this service
[1:03:40] there's a feeling in the blood of Jesus
[1:03:42] she wasn't feeling well tonight they had
[1:03:44] to go home and there's some other things
[1:03:45] that happen things happen people aren't
[1:03:47] able to be here but if you can be a
[1:03:48] communion service you need to go
[1:03:50] because it's our duty to take communion
[1:03:53] right you say well I did something that
[1:03:55] was wrong with Ben confess it get rid of
[1:03:57] it
[1:03:59] that's all it takes
[1:04:02] he already knew you did it yeah
[1:04:06] yeah you don't have to well Lord when I
[1:04:08] get this all out when you find out you
[1:04:10] may or may not forgive me no
[1:04:13] God I'm sorry
[1:04:16] I confess my sin I I I'm not been what I
[1:04:19] should have been and he forgives you in
[1:04:20] that instant
[1:04:22] amen
[1:04:24] and each one of them were there he said
[1:04:25] it's the duty of a Christian take
[1:04:27] communion he said I believe it's a
[1:04:28] showdown time for Christians if we do
[1:04:30] not take it we have no part with him if
[1:04:31] we take it unworthily then we're guilty
[1:04:33] of the body and death of Christ he said
[1:04:35] so it gets to a place where it keeps the
[1:04:36] Christian prayed up when he comes to
[1:04:38] communion it should come reverently
[1:04:40] solemnly sacredly walking up confessing
[1:04:42] all of our wrongs praying one for the
[1:04:44] other
[1:04:45] listen to this if there's a brother or
[1:04:47] sister among us we feel just a little
[1:04:49] bit out of line somewhere our hearts
[1:04:52] ought to be burdened for that person on
[1:04:55] communion night
[1:04:56] especially to see them that they'll be
[1:04:59] able to walk up and take communion
[1:05:02] not be condemned with the world because
[1:05:03] they are our brothers and sisters you
[1:05:05] don't know what it does to me to see
[1:05:08] some of some of you take communion
[1:05:09] because I know what you've been through
[1:05:11] and I know the struggles and to take it
[1:05:14] together with one another I know what
[1:05:16] you've been through but I know we serve
[1:05:17] a god it heals all the Brokenness and
[1:05:19] and he heals all the stuff and you go
[1:05:22] through things that are hard
[1:05:24] yeah you come to the communion table
[1:05:26] together what does that mean
[1:05:28] God it means God is doing a supernatural
[1:05:31] work
[1:05:32] something that you couldn't do but he
[1:05:34] did it
[1:05:35] we watch every time our little kids
[1:05:37] sometimes I'll stand up here and cry at
[1:05:39] the communion table and I just just
[1:05:41] being honest with you tonight because I
[1:05:43] watch people come through I know what
[1:05:44] they were I know what God saved them
[1:05:46] from and yet I watch them take communion
[1:05:48] recognizing saying themselves I'm a
[1:05:51] Child of God watch our children as they
[1:05:53] grow up there's nothing we want more and
[1:05:55] to see our children grow up and get
[1:05:56] baptized and get filled with the Holy
[1:05:58] Ghost and take communion and when they
[1:06:00] take communion it always blesses my
[1:06:02] heart to see my my son and my daughter
[1:06:03] go through it and now my third child
[1:06:06] Melody's starting to go through and it's
[1:06:08] like it's just a wonderful thing to me
[1:06:10] I'm thinking they think enough of the
[1:06:12] blood of Jesus they they're sure enough
[1:06:14] of their experience with God that
[1:06:16] they'll come up before the communion
[1:06:18] table and tell the church I'm a
[1:06:19] Christian
[1:06:22] that blesses me you say well maybe they
[1:06:24] don't do everything right maybe they
[1:06:25] don't
[1:06:26] but somehow I think they've made it
[1:06:29] right with God I want them to come
[1:06:31] to come and then God will deal with them
[1:06:35] the time comes to make things right
[1:06:38] ought to deal with them
[1:06:40] you say well I know what brother
[1:06:41] so-and-so did he shouldn't come to
[1:06:42] communion you don't know if he's
[1:06:43] repented or not
[1:06:47] well I think I know no you don't
[1:06:50] you didn't know when the thief on the
[1:06:52] cross repented
[1:06:54] you had not been privy to that
[1:06:57] conversation between him and the Lord
[1:07:01] can you imagine if you hadn't heard it
[1:07:04] you would have never expected to be in
[1:07:06] heaven he never expected to be in heaven
[1:07:09] I was he there I heard a preacher say it
[1:07:11] this way he said the man on the middle
[1:07:12] cross said I could come
[1:07:15] that's the only reason any of us are
[1:07:16] going to make it
[1:07:21] yes Mother Brown said if you see your
[1:07:23] brother or sister like that and you see
[1:07:24] that they've not been able to take it
[1:07:25] and then they start being able to take
[1:07:26] it he said you pray for them but they
[1:07:28] won't be condemned with the world
[1:07:29] because they are brothers and sisters
[1:07:32] now watch this
[1:07:35] and we'll close
[1:07:37] to betray Christ Judas left the
[1:07:41] communion table have you ever noticed
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:43] left communion
[1:07:45] he flipped out
[1:07:47] he broke his fellowship with the
[1:07:49] disciples and with Jesus
[1:07:51] Don said this he said they went out from
[1:07:53] us but they were not of us or if they
[1:07:55] had been of us they would no doubt have
[1:07:56] continued with us but they went out that
[1:07:58] they might be made manifest that they
[1:08:00] were not all of us
[1:08:01] he said the old unbeliever will walk out
[1:08:03] on the first thing that Sandy don't like
[1:08:06] uh brother he's going to throw his
[1:08:07] colors right then he's an unbeliever
[1:08:08] Paul said they went out from us because
[1:08:10] there wasn't of us in the beginning he
[1:08:11] started with us or you did run well what
[1:08:13] hindered you
[1:08:14] he said they went out because he wasn't
[1:08:16] of us when they see the word perfectly
[1:08:17] moving on they want to get some kind of
[1:08:19] a gimmick they could work he said but
[1:08:21] the real Believers don't question
[1:08:22] nothing yeah
[1:08:24] yeah amen
[1:08:26] do you realize let's look at it you look
[1:08:28] at Judas he left that shows he wasn't of
[1:08:30] us but what does that mean if you look
[1:08:32] at it the other way it means the fact
[1:08:34] that you're here means you are a part of
[1:08:36] the body
[1:08:38] Hallelujah I discerned the Lord's body
[1:08:41] and I'm in it
[1:08:43] I deserved the Lord's body and you're in
[1:08:45] it you're a part of it
[1:08:47] real Believers don't question nothing
[1:08:49] that's the way I want to be
[1:08:50] written in the word and they believe and
[1:08:52] they just go on that's it always is
[1:08:53] written if it isn't written he said well
[1:08:55] you just stay away from it matter what
[1:08:57] happens it's got to be written how do we
[1:09:00] do communion like we do because it's
[1:09:01] written in the word
[1:09:03] Prophet said it
[1:09:04] the prophet shed light Paul shed light
[1:09:07] on communion on what Jesus said brother
[1:09:08] Branham said light on what Paul said
[1:09:10] that's why we do what we do
[1:09:13] it's got to be written he said they see
[1:09:14] that written word and they believe it
[1:09:16] and they see God moving in his word you
[1:09:18] see him moving today
[1:09:20] see the hour of the message the time
[1:09:22] and they just walk with it musicians I
[1:09:24] need a piano player actually an organ
[1:09:26] player if you would come
[1:09:28] piano and organ
[1:09:32] I want us to Bow our heads for just a
[1:09:34] moment the brothers would come and
[1:09:37] communion ready
[1:09:39] you would play something Softly
[1:09:44] and then we're going to read the
[1:09:46] the scripture as well in First
[1:09:48] Corinthians 11 but I want us to just
[1:09:50] take a moment we don't always do this
[1:09:52] but brother Branham did it at times
[1:09:54] that when you have communion you tarry
[1:09:56] one for the other you said that
[1:09:59] in his church he implemented that as a
[1:10:01] moment of Silent prayer
[1:10:04] where you pray for me and I pray for you
[1:10:07] and that's what we want we want to pray
[1:10:09] one for the other he said you pray for
[1:10:11] my secret sin
[1:10:13] and I pray for yours if I got it if I
[1:10:15] have anything I don't know it but I sure
[1:10:18] if I if I've done something in some way
[1:10:19] I sure want you to be praying for me
[1:10:22] to help me
[1:10:23] would you do that let's just take up
[1:10:25] just a moment just do that

[1:24:54] chapter 13.
[1:24:57] to read this
[1:25:00] he said now before the Feast of the
[1:25:01] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:25:03] was come that he should depart out of
[1:25:04] this world to the father having loved
[1:25:07] his own which were in the world he loved
[1:25:09] them until the end
[1:25:10] and supper being into the devil having
[1:25:12] now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot
[1:25:14] Simon's son to betray him
[1:25:17] Jesus knowing that the father had given
[1:25:19] all things into his hands it was come
[1:25:21] from God and went to God he Rise Up from
[1:25:24] supper and laid aside his garments took
[1:25:25] a towel and girded himself after that he
[1:25:28] poured water into a base and began to
[1:25:30] watch the disciples feet wipe them with
[1:25:33] the towel with you with girded
[1:25:35] came to Simon Peter and Peter said the
[1:25:36] name of the Lord thus thou wash my feet
[1:25:38] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:25:40] what I do thou knowest not now but no
[1:25:43] Hereafter Peter saith in him Thou shalt
[1:25:45] never wash my feet
[1:25:47] Jesus answered him if I watched you not
[1:25:49] though that's no part with me
[1:25:51] Simon Peter saith in him Lord not my
[1:25:53] feet only but also my hands in my head
[1:25:55] and Jesus said to him he's in his wash
[1:25:57] needeth not safe to wash his feet but
[1:26:00] it's clean every wit you're clean but
[1:26:02] not all for he knew who should betray
[1:26:04] him therefore said he you're not all
[1:26:06] clean so after he had washed her feet
[1:26:08] and taken his garments was set down
[1:26:10] again he said unto them know you what
[1:26:12] I've done to you
[1:26:13] call me master and Lord you say well for
[1:26:15] so I am if I then your Lord and Master
[1:26:18] have washed your feet you also ought to
[1:26:20] wash one another's feet for I have given
[1:26:23] you an example that you should do as
[1:26:24] I've done to you verily verily I say
[1:26:27] unto you the servant is not greater than
[1:26:28] his Lord neither he that sent greater
[1:26:30] than he that sent him if you know these
[1:26:33] things happy or ye if you do them God
