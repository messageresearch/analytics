TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 33 and verse 12 my goodness if you had that as a prophecy about your life you know that's not very much is it it says you'll raven as a wolf and and devour the prey and and at night he shall divide the spoil but then there's another prophecy and this is moses prophesying over the children of israel and he said of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders what a difference in prophecies talking about the same tribe the same family of people but there's a complete difference from genesis to deuteronomy and so i want to look at that and maybe we'll take more than one service let's bow our heads together heavenly father we're so thankful to be here tonight on a wednesday night lord i pray that you just come and meet us here lord how we need your help we can't do it on our own we can't make it on our own we need you lord and so we pray that you would come and that you would just take over this service lord the thoughts that i had lord and i know maybe the people look at it and think where is he going but lord i i pray that you just help me lord to say the things you would have me to say and walk lord right right in the places i need to walk in and lord to stay away from the places i need to stay away from i pray lord that you'd help us we we want to be more like you we didn't come to church just to hear a man we come to hear the word of god and so we ask you to come express yourself by your word here tonight lord and we thank you for your presence that we've already felt you're in the service lord during the songs we pray you continue to be with us we pray and we ask it we pray especially for nathanael tonight lord that you heal his body lord when we think of these other needs i know there's many other needs and requests that have been made over the last few weeks i pray you bless them heal them lord bless them in every way we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you you may be seated this evening whatever you are naturally today as a result of two things it's the nature passed to you from your parents and the environment or nurture that you were raised in but the random tells the story of a family that had five sons and their sons excuse me for speaking slowly i've got a little a bit of a problem with my voice tonight but he had five sons and they had five sons and there was a picture on their wall of a ship a sailing ship on a smooth sea and they found out that every one of these sons had a desire to go to the navy every one of them went into the navy or the marines and so they investigated and they found that that was the only thing in the family the only reason why was that they went to bed every night and woke up every morning looking at this picture of a navy ship and so it wasn't their genes necessarily their father their grandfather no one in their family had been a sailor but it was the environment that they were raised in that actually caused them to uh to want to sail a ship and so those things matter you know and if it matters just as an example just how a room is or what pictures are there then the things we see and especially the way we present ourselves in front of our children matters to our children and yet much of what we uh what we are also comes from our parents and and so if your parents are here tonight or or your parents are alive you can look back and you can say well i'm i'm a result of you guys and and so you can kind of blame some of that on them and yet it goes back even further than that because it goes back to your grandparents and your great-grandparents and your great-great-grandparents and goes all the way back to adam because ultimately the nature the sin nature that we have comes from adam all the way back right right and so now it's been passed on to us since the blood has been mixed up and all those things have happened and so now so now we're born into this world now it matters everything matters the place you were born the environment you were born in even the sign in the heavens that you were born under all of those things matter as to what you're going to be in life you're going to become something in life and danny ward becoming what he is today is a result of all the genes that have passed on the nature that he has and then also the way that he's been raised that's why you find such a difference many times in between siblings in between people because that gene will express itself in a different way and then many times they go different paths and so you find out later on in life that they took a very different road but maybe even had the same basic genes the same basic set of wants and desires but yet they took a completely different road why because something happened that they they took the narrow road as as the poet said and that made all the difference so the nature that we have comes from adam and in adam all die how many know that today there's no exceptions in adam all die right but in christ all are made alive the bible says but in adam all die and there's no remedy for this body of death outside of the blood of jesus christ which we know is the life of the blood the holy ghost the token that comes in and changes our lives first peter 1 23 says being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever so now that is what it takes to change our lives right we don't treat sin with psychology right that's not a treatment for sin although psychologists can do many things as far as making someone feel better about themselves can talk them through things but that's not how we treat sin we don't treat sin by counseling it out of people right we treat sin with the new birth right and that takes care of the sin problem and yet you still have a body that has to be sanctified right and that's going to be going on for the rest of your life so now we do we do retain a sticky nature on the on the outside that we must constantly keep under guard and yield our members to christ in first corinthians 9 27 paul says i keep under my body the idea the picture that he's painting is of a boxer with his fist cocked and he's waiting he's waiting and standing over a another boxer that's gone down but he's wanting to make sure he's down for good and so he stands there and watches over it he's vigilant he doesn't leave so that he makes sure that he wins that's the way you and i have to be we've got to keep under our body bring it into subjection by any means he said when i preach to others myself should be a castaway that doesn't mean that he would lose his salvation it means he would be disapproved by god that he would not oh my i tell you what i don't want to be in and i'll get over there and realize that all my all my life's work had been thrown away and so so i you want to keep yourself right you want to keep under your body it's not just about making it into heaven but it's about bringing as many others in as we can as well so in second corinthians 10 and 5 he tells us how to do that he said cast down imaginations and we've talked about this many times but every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bring into captivity every thought oh what a people we could be but caleb if we could take every thought that we think every thought of disappointment every thought of denial every thought of of unbelief and we could bring that into captivity and say the word says something different my thoughts may tell me that i'm not going to make it but the word says i am my thoughts may tell me that everything's going wrong but the word says that there's a bride without spot or wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb so you bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of christ now brother branham taught us i'm laying a wide foundation here because i'm not going to finish this tonight and we'll get we'll get into it at a different date but brother branham taught that we're an outward man which is controlled by five senses and an inward man controlled by one sense which is faith and so there's actually five senses of the of the outside man and then there's five senses of the spirit the inside of that is a soul and so inside of that is is a sense that his faith branham teaches us that one is contrary to the other he said and as long as the five senses agree with faith wonderful but when the five senses disagree we should leave the five senses alone right and so that that nature that nurture that we are we should always agree with that inside man so and here he puts it this way he said now for instance jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true what promise did he make to you he said your children would make it right and the inside man said it's true right it's just one example but many examples he said he said you can claim your children the inside man says that's true that's nothing but the truth but the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you yes sir right he said then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man he said now that's the same thing that paul is speaking of he was sold under under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same he said that's the reason we have the troubles we do married four or five times and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else so long in our lives is because of those things that's because of the outside man we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we hear a spirit man see your spirit man never did anything wrong as far as the soul is concerned you understand that that inner man he never did sin and he never will sin but you could mess up out here that inner man was born it would come from god it's going back to god yeah that's right hallelujah because we've been born again by the spirit of god he said we are carnal he said and that part must perish but then inside we're a spirit man soul inside he said that's faith in god's word he said then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith by accepting what god said right god said i'm going to make it god said my children are going to make it going to be there you don't say how they'd be there you said that you could claim them right god said that god said i have my healing yes amen he said i'm saved i come by his provided way he said it and so no matter what the outside man says i agree with the inner man because the inner man agrees with god's word so now he said how can i take a cuckleber and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it he said the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cockle bird to a germ called wheat life now notice on the inside it's been transmitted in the inside it's been changed you said then you bury that cocoa bird and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there's been a life of wheat put in the kuckleberg amen amen and the life of the kuckleberg has been taken out but the nature of the kuckleberg is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again so there will come a day but joe no more sticky nature there will come a day we don't have to worry about hurting nobody's feelings or our feelings being heard there will praise god i'm so looking forward to that day aren't you brother joel aren't you looking forward to the day when nobody can hurt your feelings and you can't hurt nobody else's feelings aren't you looking forward to the day with everything you say will be true are you with me now you can't lie you can't steal you can't do anything not that you would do that now because the inside man controls the outside man but yet you say things sometimes that maybe you go back and say oh that i didn't realize that wasn't the whole truth and and you say and you may you make promises sometimes you can't keep but there's coming a day you won't do that no more because when you leave this life then that inside man takes over right but now as long as we're in this life that inside that outside man is still sticking he said it's going to bother you he said as long as you live he said but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you so just again to lay this foundation tonight there's there is a reason for our behavior but not an excuse right so there is a reason why we do the things that we do but it's not an excuse we've got to commit ourselves to the word in such a way and surrender ourselves to the word in such a way that lord if it's something that's written in the bible if it's something i shouldn't be doing i know i shouldn't be doing it it may be my nature to hold things against people but you said if i wouldn't forgive you wouldn't forgive me so i'm gonna forgive anyway it may be my nature to to be angry and and to walk around all the time with a temper like a buzz saw that may be my nature but that's not what the word says to do the word says to be live like peaceably with all men as much as you can and so i'm going to follow the word now you can't do that just because you decide to do it but you've got an inside man yes sir and if you'll let him he'll take control of the outside man that's being born again so again there's a reason for our behavior it's not an excuse the bible says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body don't let it rain you can't do nothing about it being there right as far as this body being sin it is it is that's why you get distracted in church that's why you get when you get worried you realize worry isn't of god that's not of god at all god has nothing to do with that you didn't get that from god you didn't get that that's not because you're spiritual just because you're you're natural you're carnal but you don't have to let it rain yeah right right they don't have to have a scepter over you holding it over you and keeping you down listen what we come we'll come through our genes does not have to keep us down we're not bound to repeat the mistakes of past generations but we can press forward we can move on we can go on into something better aren't you glad for that tonight doesn't that give you a freedom you can say lord i know i can i can be better than that yes sir i can do better than that not by my own merit but because the word allows me to do it right and the life that is in me it's not the life of benjamin fruit anymore but the life that's in me is the life of christ so i can go from the ravening wolf nature to someone who's a protector of the throne of god so now brother branham likens it to the new heavens and new earth he said heavens and earth have met god and man is reconciled restored eden has begun all the curse is gone he said just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you he said see you don't accept it excuse me it accepts you because it's god's attribute if it's the holy ghost it means god's spirit are you with me tonight if it's the holy ghost it means god's spirit it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose yet she was born in sin but god had that attribute amen and here you express yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you i love it oh i just think it wasn't me at all looking i thought it was me looking i thought it was me struggling to get it but it was him coming down to get me i would hey man i was just attributed come down to get me he said see you're back here here's where you belong sin has lost its power what power did it lose the power to keep you back here you belong over here amen he said that's right the desire of sin is done gone from your heart when the holy ghost comes in you are a restored person and that doesn't mean you'll ever you'll never want to sin but what it means when the desire of sin as far as i can understand it when the desire of sin is gone from your life it means you never have to sin are you with me now the excuses are gone you don't have to sin because there's a desire there that's put there by god that wants to be right then if you sin it's just because you let the devil in right and and we are capable of doing that but we don't have to what a freedom there is in them the desire is gone we don't want to live like that right amen and but it's from the inside because many people say what but but my flesh wants to look at something that's wrong my flesh wants to of course it does it's still un unregenerated right but the where's the desire coming from what what's your strong desire brother brown said by your desire you can see who's on the throne of your heart what is your strong desire is it to go to heaven amen i believe it is tonight you wouldn't be here on a wednesday night i believe you're in the house of god tonight because you got a desire a strong desire inside of you that was stronger than your weaknesses stronger than your desire to stay home stronger than your desire to sit back in your easy chair and go to sleep but it was stronger than that there's a desire inside of you that wants god and because you there's something inside of you that wants that you don't ever have to give in to the flesh again you might but you don't have to right now brother branham says you're a restored person he said that's where the outside can reason you take a man and say well you know i know i'm not supposed to commit adultery but you know in the spirit then the spirit tells me i shouldn't commit adultery but you see way down in there is still that thing in there he said see it'll kind of govern around right so it'll govern around what you know to do is right and do something wrong anyway even though you know it's wrong it'll govern around that because the inside man's not been changed he said but when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together he said that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside the soul controls the spirit the spirit controls the body aren't you glad there's something that you've got the controls yes hey man you're not you're not being controlled but you are actually in control even of your body now look and that goes to healing as well we're not controlled by our sicknesses we don't have to give in amen to the condition of our body because we know we have a healer we're already healed right we were healed on calvary the stripes were there for our healing and so because we know that we don't have to give in to that anymore and again you'll have sickness but you don't have to give into it you'll make mistakes but you don't have to give in to those mistakes now so that he said when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together he said look when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to god he said he that's born of god does not commit sin he cannot sin he said he references romans 8 1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus that walk not after the flesh after the spirit he said there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking if i could just just get in christ it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit there's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they're dead your sins are buried in baptism you are a new creation in christ and your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of a life yeah right and that's not again it's not by constantly reminding yourself today i'm not gonna do it today i'm not gonna rob a bank all right today i'm not gonna write bank i don't have to do that right the desire's gone does that mean i'll never slip up on my taxes or be tempted to put something there that's not there right boy it got quiet but the desire of sin is gone i'm gonna go rob a bank all right i'm not gonna purposely go even mislead the government much as i would like to right but but in a moment of weakness might i be caught up in something sure i'll make it right yeah i'm sure why i'm a christian i'm a restored person amen i'm a new creature in christ hallelujah and so he says you're a new creation he said your sins are buried in baptism your new creation in christ in your body becoming subject to the spirit try to live a right kind of life but now in that and again trying to keep the balance of this of this foundation so we can begin to look into the scripture you still have to overcome right how many know that tonight i got class participation because you spread out kind of tonight all over the place so i can't really see you without my glasses on but but you know we know uh that that we have to overcome and brother brown said he can't just push you through a pipe and pull you out the other end you've got to overcome yes sir right right right and so paul puts it this way he said this i say then walk in the spirit you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so that's what we have to do so here we have this nature and nurture that's pulling us down but here we have a new nature on the inside we're a new creature in christ and that creates that war before there was no war because it was just whenever you wanted to do something bad you just did it now there's an awakening of that seed now you have a desire to do the right thing and the holy ghost when it comes in there becomes a control tower that controls you and keeps you doing the right thing yes amen and so now now you have that but they didn't have that in the old testament yeah you realize all even the greatest men in the old testament did not have the holy spirit on the inside right it could only anoint their spirit but they could not have the life of christ because christ hadn't come and died yet sure right so they did not have the holy ghost or the token as we know it today though they were influenced under the holy ghost and though they walked in faith and though they did great deeds and mighty miracles and things like that yet you see a fluctuation in in and out a backsiding constantly and and it's it's instructive for us to look back at what went on with them because we see how these two realms on the outside actually work right because you could look at a man like joseph or jacob or or a man like abraham and think my there's a man who should have never done anything wrong but look what how they backslid how they lied how they did the things that they did a man like david how could david ever do that well that's because there's just there's no control tower on the inside are you with me now but yet you see god still loved him god they were still a man after god's own heart but but you see they were walking in the flesh yes sir and then they walk in the spirit for a while but then they'd walk in the flesh because there was nothing there to hold them to keep them and hebrews deals with that we could go look at it he said there was no sacrifice that could make the one coming to it perfect right right there was nothing there that they could come back and once for all but we do have that sacrifice we have a high priestess greater than aaron aren't you glad for that we have a high priest after the order of melchizedek had no beginning of days or ending of days our high priesthood is always there and he said john said if any man sin he has an advocate with the father you you can't sin in the eyes of god yes that's right are you with me tonight so now as we look at this i want to look at the tribe of benjamin and and this family the broader family of israel of jacob but especially it's the tribe of benjamin because it's an interesting study in extremes there were famous benjamites in the old testament just a few hood was one of them he was the left-handed assassin in the book of judges you boys are going to go find that now the left-handed assassin went and killed the king and that was that was bringing reigning over the israelites or or causing bringing the israelites into bondage and there was saul saul was a very interesting case and we'll get to him at some point saul is a fascinating man because of all the things he did right and all the things he did wrong right and brother brown said he still made it sure right and but he's a fascinating man mordecai and esther were benjamites and then paul the apostle in the new testament was a benjaminite and those are the major benjamites in the bible now the prophecy we know had to come true that jacob when he prophesied and actually these mothers would would cry out but it's interesting benjamin's name is not what jacob prophesies over him but benjamin's name is actually a son of my right hand i know that because that's my first name and it's not personal at all tonight but it is interesting to me because my name is benjamin my son's name is benjamin but but yet there's a there there's a prophecy that jacob gives after his mother names him benjamin son of my right hand and the second prophecy seems to go more with that that first prophecy just calls him a ravening wolf he's uncontrollable well there's a reason for that and it has to do with how he was raised and the kind of family he was born in and the environment and things that he was around and and this is important and i don't want to bring any kind of guilt tonight because some of you have raised your children and and some turned out better than others and it just seems like you just we live in a fallen world and any child is capable without the holy ghost if they don't receive the holy ghost they're capable of doing almost anything and that's just the truth and we've got to learn that and it doesn't it doesn't bring your any less love for them it's just the way that the human flesh is but we need to get them in an atmosphere where they can get the holy ghost we need to have them in an atmosphere where they can hear the word yes sir and we've been like that is something we can do yeah and we can set the right kind of example before them now benjamin was born of godly parents but there was trouble in the home jacob and rachel were sweethearts but because polygamy was legal at the time and his payment for jacob's shyster ways because he had he deceived people so many times he got deceived and laban his father-in-law deceived him into marrying leah first that's that's a fascinating story isn't it that he actually gets the wrong life yeah and you can imagine the resentment that he must have had because he still loves rachel so much he's not just going to quit but then he's got to he gets to marry rachel right after he marries leah but then he's got to work seven more years right for her you can imagine the resentment that that you know you come in every you know it's hard sometimes to go to work and you go to work and you sit there and think well all i'm doing is paying bills you know i should have never got married should have never had a family i know none of you men have ever thought like that but i have you get that hard at work and you're all stressed out said man i can't believe i did this you know i'd have been better off by myself you know and and you forget about the joys of it and i can imagine sometime during that seven years that that he was really bummed out because now it had been almost 14 years he couldn't go make his own life he couldn't get away from his in-laws he's stuck there finally he sneaks away from him in the dead of night runs away because he and and he pulls another con and ends up leaving town jacob was quite a fellow but now here he must have been such frustration and when you have that kind of frustration towards the mom it goes towards the children yes that's right right and and on the other side you've got another step thank god we don't believe in polygamy anymore are these guys that want to restart that my goodness what in the world have you never read the bible every time there was fights in the home we got enough trouble without more than one wife and here there was there was all kinds of trouble in the home and and just an extra set of resentment that he has because listen he never picked her her father his father-in-law picked her for him and and so the bible tells us that laban had two daughters the name of the elder was liam the name of the younger was rachel it said leo was tenderized in other words in in that old testament parliament her eyes were dull she didn't have a a good expression in her eyes she was just kind of a plain person but rachel was beautiful and well favored it meant she was she was beautiful in face and body she was a beautiful woman but leah was not you think leah didn't know that leah's leah that's probably why laban got her married off the way he did you know you got a pretty bad case of it if if your father is trying to get you married off secretly without the man knowing but now come on this is real life church without the holy ghost right remember that we're talking about families without the holy ghost right and so there there's a constant fuss going on in the home and there's a there's a feeling jacob even though he loves all of his children i really believe that based on what we see in the scripture but he doesn't love leah's children like he does rachel's children and so the bible tells us that he went in also into rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah i mean that's a pretty plain statement he loved her more and served with him yet seven other years that was now he served for 14 years when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren now by showing favoritism in the home jacob is repeating a family mistake that goes back to his father isaac and he should have known better because his dad did the same thing to him right but isn't it strange how we seem to pass on we can't do the same things again without the holy ghost looking just at the flesh the outside man right the holy ghost on the inside but sometimes we still make mistakes and many times we do but here he makes a mistake of showing favoritism towards his towards his other children towards rachel's children and it caused them no end of trouble and we'll get into more of this as we go along and i'll show you how even joseph was caused trouble because that he had that favoritism showed towards him and it's how he ends up in a pit because the other brothers know that right and and so now these family genes are so strong that he is actually doing the same thing his father did even though he saw his father's mistake the bible tells us isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison that's a strange reason to love one child more than the other but rebecca loved jacob yeah see it's difficult for fathers not to show favoritism towards talented children especially if they're talented in the same way the father is right because you're going to do more things with them well you didn't think this was going to go this way did you but we had to be careful with that because we could scar generations of children right that's right because we're responsible for every one of our children not just the ones we like i say well i like all my children well you say but brother ben we we like that part about the we're a restored creature and all that yeah but you're also an outside man you understand and this is instructive to us to understand how we should do and and and how we could should continue to watch for these things in our in our outer man we're responsible for our children now the bible says train up a child in the way he should go and when he's old he will not depart from it train means to dedicate to dedicate it's the idea of setting aside narrowing or hedging in now if i wanted one of these children to go a certain down a certain aisle in the church what i would do is i would i would stand in front of them block their path in some way so that they would go down the other aisle go down the aisle i wanted them to and that's the idea is by by looking at your children by watching your child by paying attention to your children and you actually corral them or or move them in the right direction in the way that they should go their way is their custom or their manner or behavior the idea is according to their bent and i've talked to you about that before it's like going out in the forest and you see a tree that's been a certain way they would make a bow maybe for arrows out of a of course you would have make a bow for arrows but a bow to shoot arrows with they would make it out of a piece of wood that was already bent that way and the reason for that is because you don't fight the bend of the wood but yet you have to make the child live according to the scripture right and when i say make the child when they're very young that's exactly what you have to do because they're not going to do it on their own right news flash right your children are not going to live right on their own without the holy ghost they're just not going to do it most of the time there may be outliers in that there's exceptions to every rule most of the time they're just going to they're just going to be little brats because they got all boy i can't make you laugh tonight they got all your genes in them right they're little unconverted versions of yourself that's why excuse me for saying this that's why we we love it when they do something good right we just love it when they do something good because most of the time they don't right now so the idea is to bring the child up according to its bent or tie the tree to a stake to make it go straight you see a tree some trees are almost straight but you still correct it so you corrected a certain amount right and some grow up like this and it takes a lot more correction and polling and you're just constantly pulling you're tying it and but you've got to do it in such a way that'll acknowledge the way that the child is already bent and make sure that you bring it back to the word so now uh paul puts it this way in the new testament he said you fathers provoke not your children to wrath in other words don't grab a hold of them and pull them back so severely that they they all you do is make them mad but random says sometimes all we do is beat the devil into our children right and the bible says to use a rod it does say that i could get in trouble for saying that on the internet today they call that child abuse but the bible says spare the rod and spoil the child but yet you could do that so much that you actually just beat the devil into a child right because maybe it doesn't need that maybe it needs some some spiritual help and some prayer and so you've got to bring them up the bible says in the nurture and admonition of the lord so a more sensitive child the mother will tend to tend to look towards that one or maybe a child with special needs because that's the nature of a mother a father will look more towards that one who's able to do things and able to hunt and able to fish and able to do the things like that that's just natural but you got to be careful with that and i believe the holy ghost can make us better at raising our kids you believe that i believe it'll do that now he brother brown says oh he said your family is what you are now that's a scary thought he said you raise your child in a certain environment it's got a 98 percent better chance now he didn't say 100 because sometimes like i said the tree is just bit so severely because maybe genes that pass through you pass through your generation express themselves in that child and it just it becomes a wild a child that's gone crazy it seems like but yet you have a promise god will bring it back you still you don't just give up on it you still try to bring it back and raise it in the right kind of a of an environment as long as you have control over that so now he said it's got a 98 better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way bring up a child in the way it should go when it's old it will not depart from it be brought up right he said teach your children to do right to be honest to be square and fair even when they're in school you know god would motivate a a prophet to take time in the message that we have when he told us about the deity of christ and all these wonderful things and then he would motivate that same prophet to say make sure your kids don't cheat in school right motivate them in what he tells you to do if you go on in that quote he said pray for them if they've got a test at school or something coming up pray with them that's right oh my and having a homeschool doesn't give you an excuse to not pray for your children either right homeschool doesn't cure everything right and and you know that you all know that and many of our kids go to public school but whether they go to public school or homeschool they're gonna have to fight battles and we still need to pray for our children and pray with our children now brother branham says look at this little story right here now he's reading the story of elisha and he comes to the part about the bear you remember the story where elisha comes out it's a scary story there's another one for you to look up it's kind of a scary story because elisha goes out and and some children come out and mock him say go up that bald head go up that bald head and elisha comes out and rebukes him he gets in the flesh the brain said it was not the spirit of christ but he gets in the flesh remember again even prophets in the old testament did not have the holy ghost of token the way we do right so now he gets in the flesh and he and he speaks that and then he uh then the she bear god honors the prophet and a she-bear comes out of the wilderness and eats those children yeah well there's a scary thing don't don't laugh at the preacher now i'm getting some some big eyes here on the front row huh a bear literally come out of the wilderness and ate these kids but look they've been raised wrong aren't you glad you're raised right i said dad i'm so thankful for all those weapons i got because mom i'm so thankful for all the times you corrected me because i've never been eaten by a bear it's true so now brother brahman said he said look between the lines he said look at these little children going out making fun of this preacher that was bald-headed my goodness i could stop and stay there for a while he said look what they said to him go up now bald head like elijah but look what they were making fun of it wasn't just his bald head they were making fun of the supernatural that's a dangerous thing to do he said won't you he said they didn't believe that elijah went up they doubted it their priest and them had told them perhaps or he didn't go up it's just some fanaticism and that guy is supposed to be anointed with the same anointing that he was anointed oh it's nonsense tell him to go up and here with the little kids little innocent children but they've been brought up wrong he said bring up a child in the way that it should go and here they went down because the parents didn't believe it and how can you expect your children to go to sunday school and serve the lord when you yourself don't even go how can you expect your children to be something when you're nothing that's right that's a harsh statement he said but that's a little sassy about he said i don't mean it that way he said but he had me say it he said all right he said but i didn't mean you wasn't nothing i mean when you knew when you know that you make no profession how can you expect your children to be righteous when you're putting such an example before them that's right how can they do it how can you do it he said you're the best example that they have they're going to look to you when they won't look for no one else because your nature is in them that's right oh if we can only realize that they're going to look to you and they won't look for no one else because your nature is in them now he takes this now to satan he said like satan he knows a whole lot about human beings he said to god to job he said what would a man give for his skin sure he knows something about human nature he helped pervert it he knows he had a hand in it he knows a whole lot about it he still knows what to do to cause people to fall he knows human nature he knows human nature he knows how to catch you and you can look around all you want to and say well somebody else so and so they fell they did this or that but he knows how to get you and that's just the truth of it thank god for the holy ghost because the devil knows how to get you right he knows all about you he knows human nature he knows he's been he's been studying for thousands of years he knows how to catch you in it too and he's awake day and night he's he's going about like a roaring lion devouring what he will certainly he is so there he knows just how to do that but god turned around in elisha he cursed those children and 42 of them was killed by bears that ran out of the woods killed 42 of the children because they were disobedient and had been raised in the wrong kind of a home aren't you glad for the right kind of a home had been raised in the wrong kind of a home hey man he said in the wrong schooling to make fun of god's prophet instead of respecting god's prophet listen if the only thing my parents taught me was to respect this message that was something right they did teach me that yeah right and so i was never eaten by a bear and you teach them disrespect and they'll have the opposite problem try they'll they'll they'll get eaten as we would say maybe not in a natural sense today but they'll be eaten up by the world when they're taught to disrespect ministry and they're taught to disrespect especially the supernatural now he said isaac was raised as a now let me go back there he said to make fun of god's prophet instead of respecting god's prophet he said i tell you as you respect god's servants you respect god as you respect christ you respect god so and then he goes into the supernatural how that you respect what god does now isaac was raised as an only child and and i say that because the others were born later ishmael was expelled isaac was abraham's favorite obviously he was the promised son right if you go around and if you went around that home you knew who the promised son was right and and he made sure sarah made sure that everybody knew and everybody who thought any different was kicked out so now and he was a good child but he was raised up that way and jacob was his mother's favorite benjamin and joseph were jacob's favorites look how it goes on down through the channel and and then you can go even back further and go back to abraham and see how the good and the bad from abraham come right down through the family line right he taught them the bible says shall i hide from abraham the thing that which i do seeing that abraham should surely become a great and mighty nation all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him he will command his children his household after him that it shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him god speaks out about abraham and it comes out and isaac comes out and jacob they all serve the lord that's right right they don't go after other gods they serve the lord but at the same time they make some of the same mistakes that he did isaac makes the literal same mistake after his daddy made it twice yeah that's right going down and lying about his wife what a strange mistake to make but it run in the family right he lies about his wife because now watch here and are you still with me tonight i just got a few more minutes see there's a gene in abraham that was weak fearful so let's say that was a feared gene in abraham just in his flesh he was afraid now he wasn't afraid in faith he wasn't fearful in faith but there was something inside of him something in his body rather that that would make him afraid and so he went up into egypt and he went to the king of abimelech and he went up there and he thought well my goodness these people are going to kill me to get her because sarah's beautiful he thought a lot of his wife didn't he but it actually happened or pretty near happened like he thought sometimes what you fear will come upon you but that gene of fear come down in his own in his family he couldn't get away from it and and yet now he does it and and god punishes the the household there and causes them problems he was backslid he goes back and guess what happens later he does the same thing again he's done it twice i'm sure he told isaac the story don't do that and isaac comes back later gets in the same situation and that gene expresses itself right in that same situation you you know that in a lesser way right because maybe you're a person that talks a lot when you get in the corner right you get you get stressed out and you start talking or maybe you're a person that clams up when you talk a lot or when you rather when you get in the corner if you're a person maybe your dad may have done that you watch it you said i won't be like that but you get in that same situation you do the same thing all right them jeans pass themselves on along with what you're taught i can talk about brother harvey and his water bottles now but we won't those genes pass along from generation to generation right now but it's something that we carry with us so you got to watch that right if you know that it's in your family you got to watch that so now uh abraham backs in egypt isaac did the same thing now benjamin is born and i just wanted to lay a great big foundation for this and we'll get it maybe the week after next when i get back the lord willing but benjamin is born when jacob is backslid and but he's had a great experience with god he's wrestled with an angel he's been to bethel he's been face to face with god he's seen angels coming down out of the heavens he's wrestled with the with god in in a incarnate body form i mean jacob's seen some supernatural things but here he is he backslides and you see that's the pattern of his life jacob never breaks the family curse right he just keeps backsliding he journeys away from bethel and he comes after this great experience with god and and and you realize now it's never they always had a reason for leaving canaan if you go to abraham's family they were always leaving canaan and they always had a reason there was always a famine or there was something going on in the church are you with me now there's always a reason to leave but every time they left they back sin see when it comes to spiritual things the end never justifies the means you do the right thing in the right way so that your children know what the right way is and you'll find that even in even in ruth later on in naomi you'll find that they did the same thing they let naomi's family left now look every time abraham left canaan he had a good excuse every time jacob left bethlehem he had a good excuse naomi's husband left israel he had a good excuse but it still resulted in the loss of his sons jacob was constantly backsliding and you'll find it it says he journeyed from bethel he journeyed from bethel he'd have an experience with god and he'd journey away oh how many times have we done that in the flesh right but there's something that keeps holding me amen what is that the holy ghost the life of christ he was always backsiding but i want you to notice tonight before we close there had to come someone who would break that cycle and here you find that favoritism run down through the family until finally it got down into joseph benjamin doesn't break the cycle until literally thousands of years later oh my god amen because paul finally breaks it think about it every one of them acted the same way and paul finally breaks it but now here there would be a in this in this abraham isaac and jacob in this family line there would be someone who would break that and it wouldn't be jacob but it was joseph joseph broke it he was a favorite he was raised that way amen but he goes down to egypt hallelujah jacob was always backsliding but but here joseph served the lord in egypt it took joseph who was a type of christ because jacob kept trusting the arm of flesh in his own ability to get things done but joseph a type of christ breaks the cycle he becomes the prince of egypt which is a type of sin and overcome sin in egypt don't you see that's who we have inside of us no wonder he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world joseph breaks the top the type yes or he breaks rather the cycle and becomes the type of christ to where he's almost perfect brother said the only reason he wasn't is because to show it wasn't him amen because finally christ is the one who breaks it amen in the line of judah but now watch we have to overcome sin in egypt that's our type too he come to be the firstborn among many brethren how many believe that tonight among many brethren and so romans 7 21 paul says i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members all wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and that body was a body like a the illusionist to a dead body they would strap to a living man with chains that couldn't be broken until the rottenness from the body actually crept into the life of the living man oh my he said i want to do right but i can't do right because i'm a regimen who should deliver me from the body of this death it doesn't stop there though i'm so glad that the next verse is there i'm so glad for romans 7 25 he said who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord joseph breaks the cycle amen hallelujah he breaks the cycle jesus broke the cycle i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin and it doesn't stop there either but it goes on into romans chapter eight and you remember the way the letter was written it was a letter that wasn't broken up into chapters like we have it today just to make it easier to find but romans chapter 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now because he broke the cycle because amen because jesus christ our lord live without sin in egypt are you with me now there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit when you follow that example when you walk according to the spirit you walk in freedom and you break the cycle that has a hold over your family right hallelujah i believe i'm looking at some people that have broken that tonight yes i told some people here in hong kong i said you're going to have a difference because it's generation sometimes the cycle was broken and generations ago for some of you for some of us it was our generation but somebody's got to do it because the previous generation didn't break it doesn't mean it gives you an excuse to not break it that's right break the cycle make it better for your kids if the lord gives you kids make it better in your own life amen he said well i can't do that i thank god through jesus christ our lord who will deliver me from the body of this death oh it's still there you'll always carry it but you can have control over it instead of it having control over you yes sir i love this he said for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh it tried to do it by fleshly means it tried to do it by self-help by psychology it couldn't do it but god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and forth sin condemned sin in the flesh in egypt hallelujah in a body just like yours and mine are you with me now he condemned sin in the flesh and the body built like ours where he could have sinned but yet he was christ he you realized he he was not going to god wasn't going to let him he wasn't going to do it because of who he was but he had the po he had the all the potential but the reynolds said he was tempted with uh the bible says he's tempted in all light points like we are but the reynolds said he was tempted with women but he didn't sin never gave in to the thought oh i thank god for a savior like that but listen we don't have to either sorry but if a man sinned he has an advocate a perfect advocate with the father yes hallelujah but he condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us walk not after the flesh but after the spirit yes musicians go ahead and come sorry i had a little problem with my voice tonight and i maybe couldn't preach this the way i wanted to but i hope you hope you understood it i that old man pops up every now and then doesn't it i yesterday tell my story y'all can tell years later cause i got the pulpit yesterday i uh went to get or i was at home and i thought well i'm going to save money on gas i'm going to study from home which i do a lot more now and we got the ability to do that i got a little office set up there so i was going to study from home and we have two dogs my daughter has two dogs and and i got up in a little bit of a bad mood anyway you know and because that's just something my family does and we just do that joel's got that in him too may not have expressed itself yet but but she just you know sometimes you just wake up in a bad mood and i know that's not just in my family but but you know and i was in a certain mood and i walked in there and to study and those that dog that younger dog man he just barked outside my door bark bark bark you wouldn't quit she couldn't she spanked she tried she couldn't get him to quit and i finally just got up and i said i'm leaving i'm gonna go to church and i stomped out of the house and i got in my truck and i headed to ash flat because i had that marriage license so i said well i gotta take that marriage license anyway so i took it to ash flat and recorded the marriage license for the for them so now they're married if they're would for some reason be watching tonight or watch it later they uh i'm assuming that they're not but but if they gabe if you watch this later you are legal now we uh took the marriage license up there and i got so convicted because i began to think that's something my dad would have done just leave the house stomp off i can't do that i'm about to study on this i'd had these thoughts running through my mind and things i thought my goodness i can't do that i walked back i thought what can i do and i saw a coffee place i hate buying expensive drinks but i went up there and bought my wife a drink i knew she would like and drove all the way back to my house and honked at the door and she come out and got it i just want to know y'all let you know i wasn't mad at you i don't want to be like my dad in that way you understand but that's in us that's that body of death but just the holy spirit i thank god for the holy spirit because that's the thing inside of you that tells you don't do that see and as we yield ourselves to that still small voice of the holy spirit in our lives we begin to act like christ we begin to break disciples we begin to live in egypt but not of egypt we become the king of it amen aren't you glad for that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father i i don't know how to say it in a way that maybe the people would understand but lord i want them to know that every one of them have the potential to break a cycle maybe it's already been done in their families but yet they have to be like paul broke that cycle of benjamin that cycle of of a wolf a ravening wolf even though earlier in his life he it had been expressed in his life in his his walk but he broke it one day no wonder he could write about who should deliver me from the body of this death he knew who he was named after and how solid failed but he broke that cycle and yet he said i keep under my body bring it in subjection even after i have the holy ghost i i keep working on it i keep sanctification in my life i keep listening to the right things and going to church and giving in to the voice of the holy spirit in my life oh god would you help us to be the same way tonight lord we don't want to ever sit back into what we used to be we don't want to become lord just a juxtaposition of our families just a a strange brew of of our mothers and our fathers expressed in genes in our life but lord may we be more than that may the genes that are expressed lord be love and joy and peace the fruits of the spirit lord which don't come from a natural genealogy but from a spiritual gene seed on the inside awakened by the holy spirit may it be so in our lives today lord i pray you would forgive us where we've expressed the wrong things lord help us to express the right thing and to do the right thing to walk with you all the rest of our life i pray that you grant that now we love you and thank you for doing it we thank you for this church lord where we see or so many cycles that have been broken that you continue to do that lord you continue to work in a mighty way we pray and we ask you in jesus name let's stand together [Music] look back and say well i didn't do that right but i'm glad i have an advocate with the father i'm so glad that joseph my friends my king overcome sin in egypt for me amen so i can be an overcomer thank you lord jesus give him all the love [Music] hold on let the world overtake you [Music] hold on give him all the love he gave you hope on turn away from sin and hold on falling in love in love with jesus [Music] falling in love with jesus falling in love with jesus was the best thing i've ever done in his arms [Music] in his arms i feel protected [Music] in his arms never disconnected [Music] oh in his arms i feel protected there's no place i'd rather be fall in love oh falling in love with jesus fallen in love with jesus falling in love with jesus is the best thing let's just sing this just before we go start with the verse greater is he there's satan's like a roaring lion roaming to and fro seeking whom he may devour the bible tells the soul many souls have been as prey to fall in some weak hour but god has promised us today is overcoming power greater is he that is in me the greater is he that is in me greater is he that isn't me [Music] amen you're free to go in the name of the lord and on the day of pentecost a rushing mighty wind it blew into the upper room and baptized all of them with the power greater than [Music] in me [Music] you
