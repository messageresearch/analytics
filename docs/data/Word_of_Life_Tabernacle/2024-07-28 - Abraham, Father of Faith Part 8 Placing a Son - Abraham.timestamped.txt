[47:55] And1 enjoy that song brother Timothy
[47:58] that was wonderful and also sister
[48:00] Allison what a what a
[48:03] reminder what a reminder Genesis chapter
[48:07] 17 verse one good to have you all with
[48:08] us today and
[48:11] uh it's always good to see smiling faces
[48:14] on Sunday morning isn't it I know it's a
[48:16] hassle sometimes to get to church and
[48:20] and it's a hassle to uh uh you know to
[48:23] just get yourself prepared for the
[48:24] service but once we get in here and see
[48:26] one another and and look at how
[48:28] wonderful God has been to us I think
[48:29] it's just a blessing it's just a
[48:31] blessing to us Genesis
[48:33] 17:1 and when Abram was 90 years old and
[48:38] nine the Lord appeared to Abram said
[48:42] unto him I am the almighty God walk
[48:47] before me and be thou
[48:50] perfect I love that brother brand said
[48:52] he just telling him Abram you're a baby
[48:55] in my sight draw string from
[48:57] me and I will make my Covenant between
[49:00] me and thee and will multiply thee
[49:04] exceedingly and Abram fell on his face
[49:07] and God talked with him saying as for me
[49:12] behold my Covenant is with thee and thou
[49:15] shalt be a father of many
[49:19] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[49:23] be called
[49:25] Abram but thy name shall be
[49:28] Abraham for a father of many nations
[49:32] have I made thee pray Lord would that
[49:34] his Blessing to the word you may be
[49:36] seated we want to continue to talk about
[49:38] Abraham our father of
[49:40] Faith speak to you this morning on the
[49:42] placing of a
[49:43] son one of the most difficult things
[49:46] that brother brandham had to make the
[49:48] Pentecostal Church understand is that
[49:51] there was more to God than what they had
[49:55] and the reason it was difficult because
[49:57] what they had was so great it was not
[49:59] because what they had was something that
[50:01] was false initially although there was
[50:03] much false followed it but it was
[50:06] actually a real move of God that they
[50:08] had on isusa street and in Pentecost and
[50:12] they they had something real and it was
[50:14] something that uh that really uh uh God
[50:18] moved through and because they felt it
[50:20] they knew it they lived it it would be
[50:22] very hard to tell them well there's more
[50:24] than that because it experienced the
[50:26] blessings of God they'd experienc the
[50:29] the power of God they'd seen him open
[50:31] blind eyes they they'd seen him heal the
[50:34] sick they'd seen him make the crippled
[50:36] walk they'd seen Revival and and because
[50:38] of that they they they it was hard for
[50:41] them to understand because leoda was
[50:44] deceptive not because there was so much
[50:46] error in it but because there was so
[50:48] much truth in it and and because there
[50:50] was so much wealth in it because there
[50:52] was so much prosperity in it and And So
[50:55] It produced a satis isfaction as as you
[50:58] would if you went into the wheat field
[51:00] and you would walk into the wheat field
[51:02] and you'd see that there were uh almost
[51:05] mature wheat plants or even to the eye
[51:08] completely mature wheat you would see it
[51:10] out there and think oh my don't we have
[51:13] a wonderful crop there would be a
[51:14] satisfaction in that but yet that
[51:17] wouldn't be the fullness of it because
[51:19] it was yet another season to come there
[51:21] was the season of the growth of the word
[51:24] there was the season we call the bride a
[51:26] at the end time that that that seed
[51:29] would have to come to its maturity and
[51:31] so we don't want to be satisfied with
[51:32] yesterday we don't want to be satisfied
[51:35] with some other uh some other uh uh age
[51:38] or or the attributes of another age we
[51:39] don't want to look back and say well the
[51:41] message even used to be wonderful maybe
[51:43] we found out God sent a prophet but
[51:45] there's more to it than that maybe we
[51:48] found out God blessed this age with a
[51:50] with a prophetic Ministry but there's
[51:52] more to it than that God wants us as
[51:54] individuals to grow into the the
[51:56] powerhouses of his word he wants us to
[51:59] become the word of God to be to be
[52:01] living examples of his word to manifest
[52:05] his word and so in order to do that
[52:07] we've got to have a an understanding
[52:10] that there was more than just Pentecost
[52:13] there was more there was more and then
[52:15] when Abraham goes through his life he
[52:17] realized there's more than what I had
[52:19] I've got a calling I've been elected by
[52:21] God I've been justified by faith my
[52:23] life's cleaned up I'm I'm in a good
[52:25] place but there there's more than that
[52:27] and I'll say to you today if you've been
[52:29] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[52:31] and you believed on the word of God yet
[52:33] there's more than that today for you you
[52:35] say well brother Ben when is there not
[52:37] more well when we leave here there won't
[52:39] be anymore but that's why Ephesians 4
[52:42] tells us that the ministry is called the
[52:44] the five-fold ministry as we call it is
[52:46] called until it says until we all come
[52:49] in the unity of the faith when will that
[52:51] be well it'll be when we go home God's
[52:54] going to make that statement when we go
[52:56] home yeah it's when the bride is fully
[52:58] mature until that time we are still
[53:01] waiting on the fullness of our
[53:03] Redemption now and yet what we have we
[53:05] can be satisfied with right yet we don't
[53:08] put a period on what we believe right
[53:10] how many times have we heard brother
[53:11] brandom say that we don't put a period
[53:13] on what we believe we want to learn we
[53:15] want to grow every one of us can learn
[53:17] something every one of us can grow up
[53:18] and become a little bit more mature and
[53:20] handle things a little bit better and
[53:22] and deal with people a little bit better
[53:24] he wants us to reach that place
[53:28] so it
[53:29] produces uh this age even can produce a
[53:32] satisfaction but yet we need to cry out
[53:34] to God and say Lord I want more we just
[53:37] come through wonderful meetings but Lord
[53:39] I want more of your presence I want more
[53:42] of you in my life I want more of your
[53:44] reality living in my everyday life I
[53:48] want more peace I want more
[53:50] joy that's good as the man said that was
[53:53] eating watermelon he said that was good
[53:54] but there's more of it
[53:57] right as long as there's more watermelon
[53:59] to eat let's eat the watermelon right
[54:01] sir so now the Pentecostal age and I
[54:05] don't want to minimize what it was
[54:06] because it was a great age God was
[54:09] displaying his attributes in a great way
[54:12] they had something real but it wasn't
[54:15] all there
[54:16] was so they produced the word or the
[54:19] seed the fruit of their age but they
[54:22] weren't the last
[54:24] age John 15 and five says I'm the vine
[54:27] you're the branches he that abideth in
[54:30] me and I in him the same bringeth forth
[54:31] much fruit for without me you can do
[54:33] nothing the Pentecostal age had fruit
[54:36] they fulfilled the word of God for their
[54:39] day but yet they didn't fulfill all the
[54:41] word of God because there was another
[54:44] age yet to come so there was something
[54:47] for us to fulfill now brother Brandon
[54:49] puts it this way he said the world is
[54:51] wanting to see Christ yeah the world is
[54:55] wanting to see Christ Jesus said I'm the
[54:57] vine ye are the branches and the branch
[55:00] Bears record of the vine because it
[55:02] draws its energy and life from the vine
[55:06] he said well the first Vine first branch
[55:08] that come from this Vine he said they
[55:09] wrote a book of Acts behind that Branch
[55:12] we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in
[55:14] that first church that church of
[55:16] Pentecost that original Pentecostal and
[55:19] he said then when we believe that if
[55:20] this original vine ever puts forth
[55:22] another Branch so he's talking about
[55:24] what happened on the day of Pentecost he
[55:26] said if that original vine ever puts
[55:28] forth another Branch they'll write
[55:29] another book of Acts behind it because
[55:32] it's the same life that's in the vine
[55:35] right if the first Branch put forth a
[55:37] bunch of grapes right right so whatever
[55:40] we have now is going to look like what
[55:43] they had then right right that's why we
[55:46] don't just accept forms of worship that
[55:48] people impose on us right because
[55:51] whatever we have now has got to mimic
[55:54] what they had then just mimic it but
[55:57] reproduce it in our lives so he said if
[56:00] I'm getting just a little bit of
[56:01] feedback brother Gabe and he said if the
[56:04] first Branch put forth a bunch of grapes
[56:06] we find a bunch out here that's got
[56:08] watermelons growing on it or pumpkins or
[56:11] cucumbers we know that it isn't the life
[56:14] that's in the vine yes right so if
[56:17] you've got grapes over here you should
[56:20] have grapes over here if you've got
[56:22] grapes on the day of Pentecost you
[56:24] should have grapes in the bright age
[56:26] right
[56:26] right so if you got grapes over here and
[56:29] over here we got watermelons something
[56:31] happened he said we know that it isn't
[56:33] the life that's in the vine therefore I
[56:35] think he said even where we would call
[56:36] ourselves Pentecostals he said has
[56:38] failed to represent the real thing that
[56:40] Christ set us forth forth for us to
[56:42] represent the Holy Spirit and and the
[56:44] life of the spirit he said see we
[56:46] represent sometimes Sensations and we
[56:49] represent joy and that's good now watch
[56:52] it's going to it was close it was
[56:55] deceptive because it was
[56:56] close so our services will be
[56:59] Pentecostal
[57:00] Services if they're right right we know
[57:03] a dead Church isn't right it doesn't
[57:06] look like acts right right a dead Church
[57:08] doesn't look like acts a Pentecostal
[57:11] Church look like a if there's a
[57:14] deception in that that we've got to stay
[57:16] true to the word when the Pentecostal
[57:18] Church didn't so he said he said that
[57:21] that's good but there's more to it than
[57:23] that there's a fruit that goes with it
[57:25] that the hungry man oh my how many are
[57:28] hungry this morning that the hungry man
[57:30] is looking for a fruit of the spirit and
[57:33] this is the quality that was in Jesus oh
[57:36] that's a quality that I want this
[57:38] morning it's the quality that was in
[57:41] Jesus so we we found out that Abraham's
[57:45] Royal seed goes through the same stages
[57:49] that Abraham did brother brandom says we
[57:52] passed the first Junction justification
[57:55] sanctification he said now remember that
[57:57] was things that God promised and did to
[57:59] Abraham but here he said I am the
[58:02] breasted God right we talked about that
[58:05] Wednesday night
[58:07] Eli excuse me now you're old Abraham
[58:10] you're a hundred years old but to me
[58:12] you're no more than a baby so I give you
[58:15] a promise I am the breasted God I am the
[58:18] strong one lean upon my bosom now and
[58:21] nurse for me my strength into your weak
[58:23] body getting him ready for the miracle
[58:26] you might say brother Ben I don't know
[58:28] how I can come from this place where I
[58:30] am to a place of rapturing faith I don't
[58:33] know how I can come from this place of
[58:36] doubt and to Healing how can I come from
[58:38] this place of of being a sinner to being
[58:41] a Christian lean on him nurse from him
[58:46] amen draw from him draw strength from
[58:48] him and you can become what God called
[58:51] you to be yes Abraham you want to have
[58:54] your Miracle are we looking for miracle
[58:56] in this day we what are we looking for a
[58:58] change of the body we want to have a
[59:00] miracle what are we going to do draw
[59:02] from him and you realize every service
[59:05] that we have where we feel the presence
[59:07] of God it's just a down payment on one
[59:08] to come every time we get together and
[59:11] see a Unity among the Brethren it's a
[59:13] down payment on a time to come every
[59:15] time we feel the presence of God Among
[59:17] Us every time we hear the word preach
[59:19] it's just a little bitty Shadow brother
[59:21] B it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
[59:23] of something to come but we're feeling
[59:26] effects of another land I say there's
[59:28] more for us today there's more for us
[59:31] don't be satisfied with yesterday's
[59:32] gospel there's
[59:36] more we can't let anything stop us yeah
[59:40] there's more let's be big picture
[59:44] Christians right let's look at the big
[59:46] picture yeah I could stop here and fight
[59:48] with this one or stop here and fuss with
[59:49] this one but there's more for me I I
[59:53] could I could raise a a fuss about this
[59:55] or I could go around here and I can pick
[59:57] at this or criticize this but there's
[59:58] more for me oh how many believe it this
[1:00:01] morning there's more for me I'm I'm weak
[1:00:04] now but I know there's strength I I may
[1:00:06] be sick now but I know that there's
[1:00:08] healing I may be in an old body now but
[1:00:10] I know that there's a new body
[1:00:13] coming
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:16] hallelujah nurse from me my strength
[1:00:19] into your weak body getting him ready
[1:00:21] for the miracle he said that's what he
[1:00:24] done to the Pentecostals after Wesley
[1:00:26] age he let the Pentecostals nurse his
[1:00:29] own strength his own Holy Spirit as a
[1:00:32] baptism back into their weak bodies to
[1:00:34] give them faith for the Rapture to give
[1:00:37] them faith for
[1:00:38] miracles I'm El
[1:00:41] Shai oh my so we still need that now
[1:00:45] remember there are people in all these
[1:00:47] stages in the church body so you you
[1:00:49] can't it's like well we only need the
[1:00:51] word because well some of us still need
[1:00:53] Pentecost I dare say we all do
[1:00:56] but we need the word
[1:00:58] too right without the word we can't
[1:01:00] mature but some of us still need
[1:01:02] Pentecost we still need gifts we still
[1:01:04] need men we still need people who pray
[1:01:07] we still need a prayer life yeah right
[1:01:09] we still need a home life we still the
[1:01:12] word has not replaced those things right
[1:01:15] right but it draws us to those things
[1:01:16] and calls us to those things so there
[1:01:19] are but we have people in all those
[1:01:21] stages our young people need a their own
[1:01:24] Revival every generation has to have
[1:01:25] their their own Revival we don't need to
[1:01:28] get in the way of them having their
[1:01:30] Revival right our our elders sometime we
[1:01:32] need a we need a rebaptism of the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost we need that all right we need to
[1:01:36] draw strength from
[1:01:38] Eli but yet we know there's more there's
[1:01:41] coming a placing of a church are you
[1:01:44] with me now we're being placed in this
[1:01:47] age in the land that God give us
[1:01:50] now now he said he gave the church he
[1:01:53] said like the like the I don't know
[1:01:55] where I'm at
[1:01:57] now he said now in the 17th chapter he
[1:02:00] gave the Holy Spirit he said notice I am
[1:02:03] El should I remember he's going to
[1:02:05] receive something into him now from God
[1:02:08] strength like the Baby draws the
[1:02:10] mother's own strength from the body of
[1:02:12] the mother through nursing the church
[1:02:15] was given the holy ghost drawing the
[1:02:17] strength of the spirit into them nursing
[1:02:20] it back right so if you're trying to do
[1:02:23] away with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:24] say well that was Pentecostal we need
[1:02:26] that anymore you're not getting any
[1:02:27] strength all right that's why the church
[1:02:29] is weak that's why the young people are
[1:02:31] leaving that's why there's no power in
[1:02:33] the house of God anymore is because
[1:02:35] you're not drawing from El Shi come on
[1:02:38] yes you with me now he gave the church
[1:02:42] the Holy Ghost to do that with the
[1:02:45] strength Giver his own strength God
[1:02:47] giving an outlet to his weak child
[1:02:49] that's confessed his faith to give him
[1:02:51] strength for something he's ready to do
[1:02:53] something for him now see you've got to
[1:02:55] draw strength before you can receive
[1:02:57] Revelation before you can be placed
[1:02:59] where God wants you to be you got to be
[1:03:01] strong enough to take it you got to be
[1:03:04] strong enough to fight the fight that's
[1:03:05] coming yeah how do you do that El Shai
[1:03:09] oh draw from him this morning draw from
[1:03:11] don't let anything stop you say Lord
[1:03:13] today I need strength let me draw from
[1:03:16] you let anything keep you from drawing
[1:03:19] from the body of God yeah the power and
[1:03:22] strength that you need we know we know
[1:03:24] that's a person Bram gets into that it's
[1:03:26] a person the Holy Ghost is a person we
[1:03:28] draw from him yeah the strength that we
[1:03:31] need so brother brandham taught us that
[1:03:34] justification was Genesis 12
[1:03:37] sanctification Genesis 15 the baptism of
[1:03:40] the Holy Ghost in Genesis
[1:03:41] 17 but there were different things that
[1:03:44] happened in Genesis 17 to
[1:03:47] Abraham NOW Watch God's Own Strength
[1:03:50] brother R said nurse through a promise
[1:03:52] give it to the Pentecostals the holy
[1:03:53] ghost drawing God's own life right out
[1:03:56] into them he said as he did it natural
[1:03:59] there he does the spiritual here see to
[1:04:01] Abraham and his seed after him he said
[1:04:03] you get what I mean now and I remember
[1:04:05] the church is still advancing still
[1:04:07] advancing now each one of those organ
[1:04:09] those ages organized and
[1:04:12] died we don't want to organize and die
[1:04:15] right we're we're in we're in something
[1:04:17] that's moving we've got to be he said
[1:04:19] now I want you to look he said you who's
[1:04:21] putting down the scripture the fourth
[1:04:22] and fifth verse he said after he had
[1:04:24] called him by justification
[1:04:26] Sanctified him through the blood of the
[1:04:28] Covenant give him his own life in the
[1:04:30] 17th chapter of the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:32] Ghost what comes next in Israel some of
[1:04:35] you Bible scholars he said the placing
[1:04:37] of a son so brother brandom identifies
[1:04:40] what we call adoption in Abraham's
[1:04:43] journey and adoption it's a word that
[1:04:45] when we think adoption we think bringing
[1:04:47] someone into the family making them a
[1:04:49] son or a daughter that's not what
[1:04:51] adoption is
[1:04:53] scripturally right that's what it is now
[1:04:55] today in our modern vernacular but
[1:04:57] adoption in the scriptures is not making
[1:04:59] someone a son but it's setting someone
[1:05:02] into
[1:05:03] sunship or or into headship position to
[1:05:07] where that person can begin to do the
[1:05:10] work of the family sir begin to do
[1:05:13] everything that the father could do
[1:05:16] right all the responsibilities that the
[1:05:18] father had he wants to pass on to his
[1:05:20] son when the baby when when the boy's a
[1:05:22] baby he doesn't give that responsibility
[1:05:25] to him he w Waits until the appointed
[1:05:27] time and at the appointed time he's
[1:05:30] deemed ready by tutors and governors
[1:05:33] right by the BR taught us that was the
[1:05:34] Holy Spirit until the appointed time
[1:05:36] that he's ready to receive the adoption
[1:05:38] so he identifies adoption now in the Old
[1:05:41] Testament brother BR said when a son was
[1:05:43] born in the family he was a son but he
[1:05:45] was not air yet he said see the father
[1:05:47] didn't know what the boy would be so he
[1:05:50] had a tutor I'm about a natural father
[1:05:52] he had a tutor over him to raise him to
[1:05:53] a certain age he said then the placing
[1:05:56] of a son let's look at it in the
[1:05:58] scripture Galatians chapter 4 and verse
[1:06:00] one this was something that I was going
[1:06:04] through Abraham anyway and the brothers
[1:06:06] dealt with adoption this last weekend if
[1:06:08] you were listening you know that they
[1:06:10] dealt with that extensively and so I was
[1:06:12] very pleased with that I believe it was
[1:06:14] the Lord because we were just coming
[1:06:16] into this teaching so Galatians 4 And1
[1:06:19] it says now I say that the heir as long
[1:06:20] as he's a child differeth nothing from a
[1:06:23] servant and brother Shawn especially
[1:06:25] mentioned
[1:06:26] this on Saturday morning The Heir though
[1:06:30] he is a child differ nothing from a
[1:06:32] servant though he be Lord of all so he
[1:06:35] has the right to all of it but he's not
[1:06:38] yet given the
[1:06:39] inheritance because he is not ready for
[1:06:42] it yet right and so he differs nothing
[1:06:44] from a servant he's provided for but he
[1:06:47] doesn't have authority right yeah so
[1:06:49] verse two but is under tutors and
[1:06:51] governors until the time appointed of
[1:06:52] the father yeah if you write in your
[1:06:55] underline that until the time appointed
[1:06:57] of the father yeah and I want to give
[1:07:00] you a sneak preview right here right so
[1:07:02] we don't get too far thinking well maybe
[1:07:04] that time will come we're in that time
[1:07:07] right as an age we're in that time
[1:07:10] individuals God deals with every
[1:07:12] individual differently but when it comes
[1:07:14] to the age we're in that time not just
[1:07:17] the age of being a son but the age of
[1:07:20] adoption all right it's just the time we
[1:07:22] live in so even so he said when we were
[1:07:25] children were in bondage under the
[1:07:27] elements of the world but when the
[1:07:29] fullness of the time was come so in
[1:07:31] other words there was a prophecy that
[1:07:33] was made there were all kinds of types
[1:07:35] all kinds of Shadows all kinds of things
[1:07:38] that were done are you with me this
[1:07:39] morning all kinds of uh form and
[1:07:43] ceremony that they went through but they
[1:07:45] were all speaking of something coming so
[1:07:48] Paul looks back at the law and he says
[1:07:49] that was the time of tutors and
[1:07:51] governors he said but when the fullness
[1:07:53] of the time was come and when the word
[1:07:55] become flesh are you with me now in a
[1:07:59] man called Jesus Christ when the word
[1:08:01] become flesh in God's son what was it
[1:08:04] that was the fullness of the time God
[1:08:05] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[1:08:08] under the law to redeem them that were
[1:08:10] under the law that we might receive the
[1:08:12] adoption of
[1:08:15] sons so brother Ron teaches that God did
[1:08:17] the same thing in Matthew the 17th
[1:08:19] chapter yeah he took Peter James and
[1:08:22] John went up on a high mountain upon a
[1:08:23] mountain was transfigured before them
[1:08:25] what was he doing he was showing the
[1:08:26] placing of a son brother bam deals with
[1:08:29] that in a message called to hear ye him
[1:08:30] in the message you can go listen to it
[1:08:32] yes but I'll read verse four Matthew
[1:08:34] 17:4 then answered Peter remember they
[1:08:35] all went up on the mountain and and
[1:08:37] here's Moses and Elijah Peter's just
[1:08:39] having a grand old time time to build a
[1:08:41] church you know in fact time to build
[1:08:44] three
[1:08:45] churches right let's build three
[1:08:47] Tabernacles and Peter said I'll build
[1:08:49] one here for Moses and one here for for
[1:08:53] Elijah and one here for Jesus I just I
[1:08:56] just make three persons in the godhead
[1:08:59] right Why Oh my he hadn't come he hadn't
[1:09:02] come to the full revelation of God yet
[1:09:05] right there's a there church there's a
[1:09:08] powerful teaching in here look he hadn't
[1:09:10] come to the full revelation of who God
[1:09:12] was and so he looked said well let let's
[1:09:15] just make three Tabernacles and while he
[1:09:18] yet spake Behold a bright Cloud
[1:09:20] overshadowed them Behold a voice out of
[1:09:22] the cloud which said this is my beloved
[1:09:25] Son yes in whom I am well pleased hear
[1:09:29] ye
[1:09:30] him so it was God adopting his son not
[1:09:33] making him part of the family he was
[1:09:35] already part of the family he was
[1:09:36] already God in flesh but acknowledging
[1:09:39] that he had the same Authority as his
[1:09:41] father yeah so again there's a example
[1:09:45] in Jacob and Esau the Bible teaches that
[1:09:47] Jacob had the blessing and the
[1:09:48] birthright but he still needed to
[1:09:50] wrestle with the angel yes right and
[1:09:53] this is where when I say there's
[1:09:54] something more and I'm just comfortable
[1:09:55] to this morning preaching to you but
[1:09:58] there's there's something more for us we
[1:10:00] we don't want to stop because we have
[1:10:02] the blessing all right we don't want to
[1:10:04] stop when we just know that we're
[1:10:05] elected right right we don't want to
[1:10:06] just stop even with the baptism of the
[1:10:08] Holy Ghost we want that but we want more
[1:10:10] yeah we want more and so there's got to
[1:10:12] be something in your life that that that
[1:10:15] keeps crying out for God God I want more
[1:10:17] I want to I want to be more dedicated I
[1:10:19] want to be more sincere what did the
[1:10:21] angel tell brother brandom he said if
[1:10:23] you want to see these things you got to
[1:10:25] be more more sincere if you want to see
[1:10:27] healing you got to be more sincere you
[1:10:29] want to see Deliverance you got to be
[1:10:30] more sincere so we're we're firm in our
[1:10:32] election we know where we come from
[1:10:34] Abraham knew he was called by God he
[1:10:36] didn't doubt God he didn't stagger at
[1:10:38] the promise and yet he said I know that
[1:10:39] there's more for me and I would say to
[1:10:42] every one of us this morning that's
[1:10:43] still the case with us there's more for
[1:10:46] us so here comes we don't want to stop
[1:10:49] short of that here comes Jesus uh into
[1:10:51] the same place and brother random tied
[1:10:53] that to Abraham received his new name
[1:10:57] becoming Abraham when he had been when
[1:11:00] he had been Abram now pom talks about
[1:11:04] Jacob and Esau and Jacob and the
[1:11:06] birthright and how he needed to wrestle
[1:11:08] with the angel listen what he said he
[1:11:09] said Pentecost there is where you failed
[1:11:13] you thought because you were born of the
[1:11:14] spirit born of the spirit of God the
[1:11:16] birth right that settled it but only
[1:11:18] starts it yeah sir see and brother M
[1:11:21] goes on to say that the child would not
[1:11:23] become an air it's a fascinating
[1:11:24] statement he said unless he was
[1:11:26] interested in his father's
[1:11:29] work come on Church we're not it's not
[1:11:31] just we we're teaching Grace but we're
[1:11:33] teaching Grace that comes with
[1:11:35] responsibility and Grace that comes with
[1:11:38] with dedication and Grace that comes by
[1:11:40] because of his grace not because we
[1:11:42] could work our way into it but because
[1:11:44] of his grace there's a reality of of
[1:11:46] what we must do and who we are so it
[1:11:49] brings a it brings a you
[1:11:51] know there are religions that are easy
[1:11:56] and there's those that are hard you know
[1:11:57] I've always looked at the cath
[1:11:58] Catholicism is a hard religion but for
[1:12:01] someone who's a legalist it becomes easy
[1:12:04] because what happens is they feel they
[1:12:06] can never compensate so if I do these
[1:12:08] things I'll be okay right if I go say my
[1:12:12] novenas if I do say my certain prayers
[1:12:14] and the church is going to tell me what
[1:12:16] to say what to pray and when to have
[1:12:19] church and I knew Catholics that went
[1:12:22] every day I knew a man he was a good
[1:12:24] he's passed away now in our hometown uh
[1:12:26] he went every every day he went to
[1:12:28] church Mr Peterman he went to church
[1:12:30] every single day Smoked
[1:12:33] Cigarettes he uh he was a uh he would
[1:12:37] talk about getting drunk at the Nights
[1:12:39] of Columbus
[1:12:40] rallies and laugh about it but he he was
[1:12:43] otherwise a moral man but he had these
[1:12:45] things in his life but he went every day
[1:12:47] because he thought well if I do those
[1:12:48] things but there's no maturity in
[1:12:51] that right there there's no
[1:12:53] responsibility in that right it's like
[1:12:55] you telling your kid every little thing
[1:12:57] to do but you don't want to do that when
[1:12:58] they're
[1:13:00] 40 come on some of y'all know cuz say
[1:13:03] Amen to that you don't want to have to
[1:13:04] do that when they're
[1:13:06] 40 right you want them to have lived you
[1:13:09] don't teach them how to ride a bik no
[1:13:10] more not teach them how to walk every
[1:13:13] little step but no more you want them to
[1:13:15] take that step on their
[1:13:17] own oh I hope you're hearing me now and
[1:13:19] God will still help us when we're weak
[1:13:21] and when we're needy and but he wants us
[1:13:23] to start taking those steps right he
[1:13:26] wants us to become an heir that's until
[1:13:29] we know that we can speak and things
[1:13:30] will
[1:13:32] happen amen yes he said now he said so
[1:13:36] when the Holy Ghost fell upon the
[1:13:37] Pentecostal people and they begin to
[1:13:38] restore back the gifts and things within
[1:13:39] the church they thought because they
[1:13:41] were born of the spirit that settled it
[1:13:43] but you see there is a placing of a son
[1:13:45] right and after this son proved to be a
[1:13:47] real son and he was taken in a public
[1:13:50] place and then was set up and changed
[1:13:52] robes and set up there and then there
[1:13:53] was a placing of the Sun he had heir of
[1:13:56] everything someone say everything the
[1:13:58] father had and he said God did the same
[1:14:01] thing by his son on Mount
[1:14:04] Transfiguration so he's doing that for
[1:14:05] Abraham in chapter 17 now he said how
[1:14:08] many understands that when he was El
[1:14:10] Shai that he gave his own strengthened
[1:14:11] Abraham he never done nothing but made
[1:14:13] him promises promises but here he's
[1:14:15] emptying himself out into Abraham
[1:14:18] literally he said well that was the Holy
[1:14:20] Ghost justification is what you believe
[1:14:22] sanctification is what the blood did for
[1:14:24] you you're sanctified by believing but
[1:14:25] when you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:27] it's the person of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] himself oh the person not imagination
[1:14:31] not some kind of psychology but the
[1:14:33] person of the Holy Ghost yes so he said
[1:14:36] he nursed not from the Articles and from
[1:14:38] the promises but he had now the literal
[1:14:41] life of God flowing into him right it's
[1:14:44] more than just knowing the
[1:14:46] message and some of you could testify of
[1:14:48] this some of you are like encyclopedias
[1:14:50] you know the
[1:14:51] message but you can so know the message
[1:14:54] in such a way way the devil can use that
[1:14:56] against you right sir I'm saying you
[1:14:59] should know it but he can also use that
[1:15:01] against you if you're strong in that way
[1:15:03] he'll take that very strength and he'll
[1:15:04] use the word against you because he's a
[1:15:07] master of it he knows it better than any
[1:15:08] of us right right he'll use it against
[1:15:11] your mind you use it against your it'll
[1:15:13] make you feel like that the message is
[1:15:15] something other than what it is right
[1:15:17] and so You' got to have the life of the
[1:15:19] Holy Ghost Inside of You the literal
[1:15:21] Life of Christ to make it
[1:15:23] live not just the articles and the
[1:15:25] promises but now the literal life of God
[1:15:27] flowing into him that's what the
[1:15:29] Pentecostal age done he said now what
[1:15:31] did he become then a son yes what did he
[1:15:34] do again he said he placed the law his
[1:15:36] own law of adoption upon his son I know
[1:15:38] I'm reading a lot but I got to get
[1:15:40] through this because we're going to get
[1:15:40] to something wonderful after a while if
[1:15:43] I have time he said there there's Moses
[1:15:46] I talked to Moses there's the law
[1:15:47] there's the prophets but this is my son
[1:15:49] the law of adoption he said well that's
[1:15:52] exactly what God did to Abraham his son
[1:15:53] before that after Abraham had been ified
[1:15:55] by faith he said the next thing was then
[1:15:57] what did he do next thing was
[1:15:58] sanctification by the blood the
[1:16:00] sanctification by the blood to the seed
[1:16:02] next thing was nursing God's Own
[1:16:03] Strength In him taking God's Own
[1:16:04] Strength into his church what he did to
[1:16:06] Abraham he did to his seed after him he
[1:16:09] said what a word of encouragement to an
[1:16:10] old man 100 years old tell him he was El
[1:16:13] Shi now I give you the strength I'm
[1:16:14] going to place you with me now I'm the
[1:16:17] father of all creation my name is
[1:16:20] Elohim this is important my name is
[1:16:24] Elohim
[1:16:25] anyone knows that the word Elohim means
[1:16:27] the alls sufficient one the great
[1:16:29] self-existing one Elohim my name is
[1:16:33] Elohim and your name is Abram and you'll
[1:16:37] not no longer be called Abram but you
[1:16:40] shall be called
[1:16:42] Abraham Abraham watch from Elohim to
[1:16:45] Abraham he give him part of his own name
[1:16:49] sir oh Hallelujah when he placed it he
[1:16:54] said notice Abraham in his seat he said
[1:16:57] now when God get got the Pentecostal
[1:16:59] Church raised he began to place them
[1:17:02] giving them gifts and so forth placing
[1:17:04] them into the kingdom but everybody
[1:17:06] wanted to have the same
[1:17:08] gift he said oh my there we went all
[1:17:12] right right yes he says so that don't
[1:17:15] stop God's seed Hallelujah that don't
[1:17:19] stop Abraham seed it goes on just the
[1:17:22] same he said notice Elohim Abra give him
[1:17:25] part of his own name because why I made
[1:17:28] you the father of Nations a father I've
[1:17:30] made you a father of many nations and
[1:17:32] I'll put part of my name with your name
[1:17:36] Oh my he said oh how I could squeeze
[1:17:38] something right here now he said give
[1:17:40] him part of that name Abraham changed
[1:17:42] Sarah's name because she was a part of
[1:17:45] Abraham oh my it wasn't just Abraham got
[1:17:47] his name changed it was Sarah
[1:17:49] also but watch what he did with Abraham
[1:17:51] Abraham was the messenger of that time
[1:17:53] brother brandham in fact if you don't
[1:17:56] really understand this if you if you
[1:17:58] just look at it casually you might
[1:18:00] wonder why does brother Brown make such
[1:18:02] a big deal about the messenger and how
[1:18:03] many letters were in his name now if
[1:18:05] you've heard the message you know that
[1:18:06] brother Braham dwells on that right he
[1:18:09] said we've had a Graham Billy Graham a
[1:18:11] messenger to the church g r a h a m six
[1:18:16] letters right but he said
[1:18:18] Abraham amen once he had a part of God's
[1:18:21] name wasn't six letters but it was seven
[1:18:24] letters
[1:18:26] right a b r a h a m brother bandam
[1:18:29] dwells on that he tells it over and over
[1:18:31] again
[1:18:33] well I mean you just look at brother
[1:18:35] brandom's name right b r a n h a m now
[1:18:38] God was showing us something he's
[1:18:41] showing us something brother B taught
[1:18:43] that all through especially towards the
[1:18:45] end of of the message he says this he
[1:18:48] said it's exactly with Luther Wesley on
[1:18:50] down to here just exactly how he's dealt
[1:18:52] with the churches like he did with
[1:18:53] Abraham how he appeared how that there
[1:18:55] when he confirmed the Covenant to him
[1:18:56] under the shed blood he said it was the
[1:18:58] Philadelphian age remember that was back
[1:19:00] in chapter 15 he said but then watch the
[1:19:03] Pentecostal age after he come to there
[1:19:04] he made the promise of elai nurse for me
[1:19:07] but now oh Church see if the Pentecostal
[1:19:11] age had nursed they would be us yeah
[1:19:14] right if they had
[1:19:15] kept oh god brother Bram says that he he
[1:19:19] talked about how the wans had kept on
[1:19:21] the way they were going if they kept
[1:19:23] right and not denominated they would
[1:19:25] have become the
[1:19:26] Pentecostals and the ones that did move
[1:19:28] on
[1:19:29] did right if the Pentecostals oh my had
[1:19:33] just continued to nurse from elai the
[1:19:36] thing is they would have become the
[1:19:38] bride yes but they didn't do it right Oh
[1:19:42] my he said the question is can you nurse
[1:19:45] that's still the question this morning
[1:19:47] right oh church can you draw strength
[1:19:50] from the Holy Ghost for the hour that
[1:19:53] you're living in not yesterday's
[1:19:55] promises but today's promises not
[1:19:58] somebody else's word but the word of God
[1:20:00] for you can you draw strength and become
[1:20:02] a mature son or daughter of
[1:20:05] God hallelujah he said can you draw
[1:20:08] strength can you nurse oh my oh my
[1:20:13] that's still the question can you nurse
[1:20:15] yes he said but they didn't do it they
[1:20:17] grabbed them a breast from the
[1:20:18] denomination where they come out of but
[1:20:19] then the seed real seed come on to nurse
[1:20:22] that breast oh that's that's us
[1:20:25] church he said Abraham you're a
[1:20:28] son but I'm going to give you part of my
[1:20:31] name I'm going to place you in my family
[1:20:34] amen oh my it's one who has Authority
[1:20:37] yeah oh my brother brandom says after
[1:20:41] the appearing in this name of almighty
[1:20:43] God we talked about that Wednesday night
[1:20:45] what was the name brother Brandon said
[1:20:47] El Shai he appeared to Abraham as El
[1:20:49] should I what he appear to us as Jesus
[1:20:52] the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name he
[1:20:55] said do all in that name he appeared to
[1:20:57] Abraham in the name of el Shai or the
[1:21:00] almighty God also it's translated Elohim
[1:21:04] right the god the almighty God the
[1:21:06] breasted God the the breasted Elohim the
[1:21:09] almighty
[1:21:10] Elohim oh my come on now watch he said

[1:21:15] all sufficient one sir he had no helpers
[1:21:18] yeah God didn't he didn't need any right
[1:21:22] any secretaries he was alone he was God
[1:21:25] alone and he appeared to Abraham in this
[1:21:28] name and while he appeared to him in
[1:21:30] this name and Abraham recognized who he
[1:21:32] was all right oh I love this he changed
[1:21:35] Abraham's
[1:21:37] name he said now he's come to the
[1:21:39] fullness of believing now yes what's so
[1:21:41] important Abraham coming to the fullness
[1:21:43] of believing that's where you and I have
[1:21:45] to come to brother Caleb is the fullness
[1:21:47] of believing right what do we lack faith
[1:21:49] we lack the the believing part because
[1:21:53] we can't do it on our own we need to do
[1:21:55] it so we got to believe him and Abraham
[1:21:57] believed God it was imputed for
[1:21:59] righteousness because Abraham believed
[1:22:01] God he did the works of God now watch
[1:22:05] Abraham recognized who he was he changed
[1:22:06] Abraham's name now he's come to the
[1:22:08] fullness of believing now see where the
[1:22:10] church has come he said I hope you can
[1:22:11] read between the lines come up to the
[1:22:14] place where he's revealed to him who he
[1:22:16] was and then he changed Abraham's name
[1:22:19] so that the promise could be fulfilled
[1:22:22] right notice he changed his name here
[1:22:24] now for from Abram to Abraham which
[1:22:26] means father of Nations added the h m
[1:22:28] Abraham so he did this so that the oh
[1:22:32] church he did this so that the complete
[1:22:35] promise could be
[1:22:38] fulfilled and the sun now that had been
[1:22:41] promised so long could be seen or
[1:22:44] otherwise be revealed when he changed
[1:22:47] his name and after he
[1:22:50] recognized who he was
[1:22:54] now we know that adoption is it all
[1:22:58] right if we just lay something in here
[1:22:59] for a minute and then we'll move on we
[1:23:01] know adoption is not a fourth work of
[1:23:04] Grace right it's justification
[1:23:06] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:08] Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:10] in This
[1:23:11] age but the message we've received is an
[1:23:13] adoption
[1:23:15] message so if you're born again in this
[1:23:18] word
[1:23:19] age right those who were born again in
[1:23:22] Luther's day believe Luther's message
[1:23:24] those who are born again in Wesley's
[1:23:26] they believe Wesley's message if you're
[1:23:28] born again in the word in this age yes
[1:23:31] that's the age you live in then this is
[1:23:34] the age of
[1:23:35] adoption so now you've received an
[1:23:38] adoption in this age so this age calls
[1:23:41] us to a a higher calling than any other
[1:23:43] age a higher state of maturity than any
[1:23:46] other age and that's why it gets
[1:23:48] narrower towards the top because many
[1:23:50] can't take it right the regular the
[1:23:52] world can't take it but we're the Bri
[1:23:54] we're called to something better called
[1:23:56] something more and I realize we struggle
[1:23:57] with what everybody else struggles with
[1:23:59] I realize we're human beings I realize
[1:24:01] we we're just like everybody else when
[1:24:03] it comes to what we struggle with but
[1:24:05] God's not looking at your struggles he's
[1:24:06] looking at the seed right and we are not
[1:24:09] called to stop short of the promises of
[1:24:11] God we are not an age that lays back and
[1:24:13] rests on our Laurels we're not looking
[1:24:15] back at what yesterday was and saying
[1:24:17] we're only going to make it in by the
[1:24:18] skin of our teeth but we're pressing
[1:24:20] forward into something what are we
[1:24:22] reaching
[1:24:23] for
[1:24:24] maturity adoption full adop full
[1:24:28] Redemption Hallelujah brother Sean put
[1:24:30] it so well Saturday morning what is that
[1:24:32] the change of the body the Rapture all
[1:24:34] right
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:38] hallelujah message we've received is an
[1:24:40] adoption message if you're born again
[1:24:41] now and you see the person of the Christ
[1:24:44] Living in you you've been adopted in the
[1:24:46] family your name is good on the
[1:24:47] checkbook I think it's about time when
[1:24:49] we started acting like it don't you this
[1:24:51] is manifesting time this is again not
[1:24:54] every everybody's in the same place but
[1:24:56] but we ought to be reaching a place of
[1:24:57] of of of where and I'll say it this way
[1:25:00] we ought to be reaching a place where
[1:25:01] we're not being bossed around by our
[1:25:04] circumstances but we're the boss of our
[1:25:06] circumstances we're not being bossed
[1:25:08] around by by by everything that's
[1:25:10] happening to us but we become the Bo he
[1:25:12] said how can I do that I can't help
[1:25:13] what's happening to me but you also you
[1:25:15] have a conduit a channel you got
[1:25:17] Authority from the father I may I may
[1:25:20] feel depression but I won't let
[1:25:22] depression get me down
[1:25:25] I may feel sick but I won't let sickness
[1:25:27] get me down I may oh church I may feel
[1:25:31] confusion but I won't let confusion stop
[1:25:33] me come on are you with me now I feel
[1:25:36] anxiety it's for real I feel it but I
[1:25:38] won't let it stop me why I've coming to
[1:25:40] an age of maturity yes sir yes yes
[1:25:45] Hallelujah that's what Pentecost missed
[1:25:47] because they had gifts they had
[1:25:48] anointing and they had power but they
[1:25:50] didn't know what to do with it and it
[1:25:53] didn't just didn't manifest in their
[1:25:54] lives but it's
[1:25:58] time brother Brandon said God's only
[1:26:00] provided planned for his
[1:26:02] age Hallelujah his sons in the word age
[1:26:06] quickened by the spirit like a spark lit
[1:26:09] off of something to make it alive and
[1:26:11] seated now in Heavenly places in present
[1:26:14] tense already alive already alive
[1:26:18] subject to every promise someone say
[1:26:20] every promise that's the age you live in
[1:26:23] sir right the promises lay in the land
[1:26:26] we preached on many times we are in the
[1:26:30] land our adoption we can say it this way
[1:26:32] is an open book yes right the Bible was
[1:26:36] closed the opening of the seals opened
[1:26:39] mysteries in the Bible and what does
[1:26:41] that make it makes an open book so now
[1:26:45] you know the difference in a closed book
[1:26:47] test and open book test right right you
[1:26:50] have the
[1:26:52] answers all right that's a big deal when
[1:26:57] you're taking a test that's hard and
[1:26:59] every one of us are being tested right
[1:27:01] when you're taking it it's a big deal to
[1:27:03] have the answers and the answers are not
[1:27:06] in a person the answers are not in a
[1:27:08] church the answers are not in a minister
[1:27:11] come on Church the answer is Christ the
[1:27:14] word it's the message of the hour that's
[1:27:17] our answer oh Church we're not talking
[1:27:20] we're talking about the message we're
[1:27:21] not talking about some form or some well
[1:27:23] I listen to some tapes or I heard I
[1:27:25] heard brother brandom I met brother
[1:27:26] Brandon one time or something like that
[1:27:28] that's wonderful but that's not what
[1:27:29] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:27:30] the word that he brought that's the
[1:27:32] maturity that we've come to where it's
[1:27:34] an open book to
[1:27:35] us he said brother brand talk speaking
[1:27:38] of the token we're going to get into the
[1:27:39] token maybe a little bit later if the
[1:27:40] Lord allows us to he said now we have a
[1:27:42] token in this day we've been given a
[1:27:44] token which is an antitype of that type
[1:27:46] that natural token that's back there in
[1:27:48] Egypt he said we've been given the
[1:27:49] supernatural Supreme token he said all
[1:27:52] that that foreshadowed is been given to
[1:27:54] this
[1:27:56] generation glory to God has been given
[1:27:58] this the token amen hallelujah the
[1:28:02] brother brandom taught us the token
[1:28:03] couldn't come in existence until the
[1:28:04] evening time because it's the age of the
[1:28:06] fullness of the word yeah he said now we
[1:28:09] have the Holy Ghost is our token it's
[1:28:10] our identification we've accepted the
[1:28:12] death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus
[1:28:14] just a human life to come back on us but
[1:28:16] it was God himself manifested in flesh
[1:28:18] it brought back upon us the adoption of
[1:28:20] sons and now we are Sons and Daughters
[1:28:22] of God that is the
[1:28:25] token glory to God it's our
[1:28:27] identification of the Passover it's our
[1:28:29] identification we have believed God and
[1:28:30] God has accepted so it's not a fourth
[1:28:33] work of Grace but in this hour are you
[1:28:36] with me now when you receive the the the
[1:28:38] true baptism of the Holy Ghost God's
[1:28:41] moving you up
[1:28:42] higher you're not just remaining in a
[1:28:45] Pentecostal age now watch back there
[1:28:48] they didn't have the gospel as we have
[1:28:49] it today was taught in forms it went
[1:28:51] through rituals because the Holy Spirit
[1:28:53] wasn't given but today we have the
[1:28:54] substance right we don't just have the
[1:28:56] form or just the chemicals you could not
[1:28:57] take the blood of Jesus Christ and apply
[1:28:59] it to every heart but God sent back the
[1:29:01] holy ghost that the token was upon the
[1:29:03] human in the human's heart and that is
[1:29:06] your identification you've accepted
[1:29:07] God's plan met Jehovah's requirements he
[1:29:10] met them for you at Calvary and you have
[1:29:12] met them on your knees and God has given
[1:29:15] you the token sign the return of the
[1:29:17] spirit was upon Christ is in you and a
[1:29:19] guarantee identification of his life D
[1:29:22] death burial and resurrection and a life
[1:29:24] more now in the believing
[1:29:27] church are you with me so
[1:29:29] far so the token could not come into
[1:29:31] existence till the evening time the B
[1:29:33] said it's been the lamb all the way
[1:29:34] through was the lamb in Luther's time
[1:29:35] was the lamb in Wesley's time now it's
[1:29:37] token time each house must be covered by
[1:29:40] the
[1:29:41] token so Abraham was given the
[1:29:43] revelation of God's name before his
[1:29:45] placing as a son he was shown God's name
[1:29:49] and then God put his name in Abraham's
[1:29:50] name now I want to dwell on something
[1:29:52] for a moment
[1:29:54] B that we know we realize that in this
[1:29:56] he was called
[1:29:57] Elohim Elohim the word in the
[1:30:00] translation means Elohim just looked up
[1:30:01] Elohim he's talking about El Shai the
[1:30:04] almighty God Elohim he said Elohim is
[1:30:07] the all sufficient one he is El Shai
[1:30:09] Elohim the breasted God all sufficient
[1:30:11] one he needs nothing from nobody else he
[1:30:14] is your all sufficiency sir now if we
[1:30:19] back up to
[1:30:21] adoption before you can be placed in in
[1:30:24] uh as a son or a daughter of God you got
[1:30:26] to go through
[1:30:28] trials
[1:30:30] tests that's that's what we go through
[1:30:33] that's life and in this age maybe you
[1:30:37] could say it like this well there's more
[1:30:38] pressure than any other age because this
[1:30:41] is the age of full maturity so it's like
[1:30:42] a son you know he comes to a certain age
[1:30:44] when you're he's a baby you expect him
[1:30:45] to be a baby but Paul says when I become
[1:30:47] a man I put away childish things right
[1:30:50] that's what he's trying to tell the
[1:30:50] Corinthian Church so this is an age of
[1:30:53] adoption
[1:30:54] it's an age of rapture right so we've
[1:30:57] been required to go through many trials
[1:31:00] yes I believe this is an age where he
[1:31:01] won't rest until we come to where we
[1:31:03] ought to be right and that's why
[1:31:05] sometimes it seems like he deals so
[1:31:07] severely with us but it's not that he's
[1:31:09] dealing severely with us but he's
[1:31:10] getting us ready the harder the trial
[1:31:13] gets the closer you're getting to the
[1:31:14] finish right right you don't give a mini
[1:31:17] trial to a to a an adult you give a mini
[1:31:20] trial to the baby right but you give a
[1:31:23] full-blown trial to the adult the ones
[1:31:25] that that's about to be adopted in the
[1:31:27] family hallelujah look how you say
[1:31:32] brother Ben I don't how much training
[1:31:34] will there be
[1:31:38] enough right and and I can't say how
[1:31:40] much that is in anyone's life how much
[1:31:42] will there be in
[1:31:44] enough right whatever it takes to get
[1:31:47] you where God wants you to be he does
[1:31:49] not waste a
[1:31:52] trial he does not waste listen he does
[1:31:55] not waste a bad decision you
[1:31:59] make God don't waste it all they made a
[1:32:02] bad decision what am I going to do now
[1:32:03] he knew you'd make
[1:32:05] it but what did he do he corrects
[1:32:08] you right he come make brings you out
[1:32:10] stronger than you were before because he
[1:32:12] don't have the luxury as we preach long
[1:32:14] AG go of letting you fail you're more
[1:32:17] than just a servant you're a son you're
[1:32:19] a daughter Hallelujah so he lets you go
[1:32:22] through the trial and when you get to
[1:32:24] the end you come out smelling like a
[1:32:25] rose and you say how what happened to me
[1:32:27] but you say well where is the end well
[1:32:30] when it's
[1:32:31] over but during the test oh Church you
[1:32:35] just realized this today during the test
[1:32:38] what's he telling Abraham Elohim is
[1:32:43] sufficient he is oh church he is
[1:32:46] sufficient during the
[1:32:48] trial until we come to the fullness of
[1:32:51] our Redemption he is sufficient during l
[1:32:53] a to see you
[1:32:56] Hallelujah Paul's telling the Hebrews in
[1:32:58] Hebrews 12 run the race with patience
[1:33:00] and all those things he tells them this
[1:33:02] he said you've forgotten the exhortation
[1:33:04] which speaketh unto you as unto children
[1:33:06] my son despise not thou the chastening
[1:33:08] of the Lord nor faint when thou are
[1:33:10] rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth
[1:33:13] he chasteneth and scourgeth every son
[1:33:15] whom he receiveth I think we passed by
[1:33:17] that scripture too quickly let's let's
[1:33:19] stop right here for a minute let's pull
[1:33:22] over and look at this word scourges for
[1:33:24] a minute it's the same Greek word they
[1:33:26] use when pilate took
[1:33:29] Jesus we passed by scourgeth too
[1:33:32] quickly he scourged him that's the next
[1:33:35] scripture there in John chapter 19 and
[1:33:38] verse one pilate took him and scourged
[1:33:41] him what did he do to him he took a cat
[1:33:43] of Ninetails right right that had glass
[1:33:46] and
[1:33:48] and metal and wood tied bone tied into
[1:33:52] it and
[1:33:54] and they beat him with it till he was
[1:33:55] within an inch of his life until you
[1:33:58] could they they Stripped Away the the
[1:34:01] the flesh until you could see the
[1:34:02] internal
[1:34:04] organs beat him until it wasn't legal to
[1:34:07] beat him no
[1:34:09] more and then Paul takes that word and
[1:34:12] uses it he said when a when you're a
[1:34:16] son God pushes you to the
[1:34:21] Limit but not past it
[1:34:26] right on he takes you all the way until
[1:34:29] you think you can't take it no more I
[1:34:31] know some of you get tested in your
[1:34:32] offices you get tested as a deacon you
[1:34:34] get tested as a trustee you get tested
[1:34:36] in The Sound Room you get tested just in
[1:34:40] life right we put you through test and
[1:34:43] say well why why why is this pressure on
[1:34:45] me Well's because you're doing something
[1:34:46] for
[1:34:47] God but if he wants you to do it he will
[1:34:50] not push you past what you're able right
[1:34:52] right are you with me now you get tested
[1:34:55] as a preacher but he won't he won't test
[1:34:57] you you may think you're not able but
[1:34:59] there's still an ability there or you
[1:35:00] still wouldn't be letting the pressure
[1:35:02] come
[1:35:03] on the same thing in sickness in our
[1:35:05] bodies we get sick and we think oh I
[1:35:07] just can't take it I can't take it but
[1:35:09] he knew you could take it or he wouldn't
[1:35:10] have allowed you to have it because your
[1:35:12] healing is already paid for but every
[1:35:15] son who he loves he chasen and he
[1:35:22] scourgeth the the the limit that a human
[1:35:24] body can take
[1:35:27] sometimes put you through
[1:35:31] that the limit that a human mind can
[1:35:34] take sometimes and put you through
[1:35:37] that right to the
[1:35:40] Limit you say if he loved me he wouldn't
[1:35:42] do that no he does it because he loves
[1:35:45] you and it won't be easy but you'll make
[1:35:47] it right yes you say how can you say
[1:35:51] that the same way brother Brandon when
[1:35:52] they pass through the line remember what
[1:35:54] he would say you're healed if you can
[1:35:55] believe
[1:35:56] it and they come back and say brother
[1:35:58] Brown there was something that wasn't
[1:35:59] healed did you did you lie about that he
[1:36:00] said no I'm just telling him what the
[1:36:01] promis to say yeah he said I can't heal
[1:36:04] nobody you're already healed on Calvary
[1:36:07] but if you can believe it you're
[1:36:09] healed Hallelujah if you oh church if
[1:36:12] you can believe it you already made it
[1:36:14] if you can believe it the trial's
[1:36:15] already over if you can believe
[1:36:17] it youve already made it through all
[1:36:21] right it won't be easy but you'll make
[1:36:23] it
[1:36:24] see verse S says if you endure
[1:36:26] chastening God dealth with you as with
[1:36:28] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:36:31] chasteneth not words if you're not
[1:36:34] chastened if you don't endure that
[1:36:36] you're not even a
[1:36:38] son right but God knows what you can
[1:36:41] take now who is Elohim let's get into
[1:36:44] this for just a minute and then we'll we
[1:36:45] won't hold you all day Elohim is the
[1:36:48] self-existing one he's the one in
[1:36:49] Genesis 1 in the beginning God that's
[1:36:52] Elohim right that's brother brandom said
[1:36:54] before God was God he was Elohim
[1:36:57] self-sufficient right he created out of
[1:37:00] nothing yes he is church so before there
[1:37:05] was matter this is before now we know
[1:37:06] the Earth was without void and all that
[1:37:08] in verse two this before
[1:37:10] that right before whatever state the
[1:37:13] world was in before hope I'm not boring
[1:37:16] you today but the world was in a in a
[1:37:18] condition the world was in in a
[1:37:20] condition in Genesis 2 when there was no
[1:37:23] condition
[1:37:24] right right this God the concept of
[1:37:27] Elohim in Jewish thought is that not
[1:37:30] that Elohim because the Greeks believed
[1:37:32] that there was always matter and the
[1:37:33] gods arranged the matter but that's not
[1:37:36] what that's not what God did right
[1:37:38] that's not what Elohim did there was
[1:37:41] nothing but Elohim yeah
[1:37:45] right oh church and he created
[1:37:49] everything you realize every ingredient
[1:37:52] of your trial was created by
[1:37:56] Elohim every ingredient of your
[1:37:59] test everything that's went into your
[1:38:02] life was created by Elohim now he didn't
[1:38:05] he didn't make our decisions for us we
[1:38:06] did that the devil got into a lot of
[1:38:09] things right but ultimately it was
[1:38:12] created by Him the devil can only work
[1:38:14] with what God created Lucifer was a

[1:40:24] you'll find
[1:40:25] this uh in a sermon titled Jehovah Gyra
[1:40:28] number one in 1964 I believe is where he
[1:40:30] he ties This Together Job chapter 1
[1:40:35] verse
[1:40:36] one there was a man in the land of us
[1:40:39] whose name was
[1:40:40] job there's job's
[1:40:42] name that man was perfect and upright
[1:40:45] and one that feared
[1:40:50] Elohim Elohim
[1:40:53] brother randam ties that together he
[1:40:54] said it's the same word what he told
[1:40:57] Abraham job made it through the test
[1:41:00] because he trusted
[1:41:02] Elohim and brother Bram gets into that
[1:41:04] it's actually Jehovah Gyra number two in
[1:41:06] 1964 he gets into that he said notice

[1:45:33] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[1:45:36] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:45:38] waited for the manifestation of the sons
[1:45:40] of God for the creature was made subject
[1:45:42] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:45:44] him who has subjected the same in Hope
[1:45:47] because the creature itself also shall
[1:45:49] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:45:50] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:45:52] the children of God oh church this is
[1:45:55] just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
[1:45:57] the Liberty that we have here the joy
[1:45:59] that we have here the power The
[1:46:01] Authority that God gives us is only a
[1:46:03] shadow of a shadow of a shadow of one to

[1:46:52] spirit
[1:46:54] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:46:56] waiting for the adoption with the
[1:46:58] Redemption of our body listen the
[1:46:59] groaning of the soul is over but the
[1:47:02] groaning of the body and the spirit
[1:47:06] continues
[1:47:08] waiting for the
[1:47:10] adoption
[1:47:12] Hallelujah as long as we're in this body
[1:47:14] we'll
[1:47:16] Gran I find myself groaning more as I

[1:47:21] you try to get up CU J She haven't
[1:47:23] experienced that yet
[1:47:25] but go
[1:47:27] oh my wife will say what is wrong with
[1:47:31] you years ago I got done preaching one
[1:47:34] time and I went to Josh swim' house
[1:47:35] after church and his uh
[1:47:37] grandmother-in-law I think was there and
[1:47:39] and I walked into the house and she's
[1:47:41] about 90 years old at the time and I
[1:47:43] walked in there and I kind of groaned
[1:47:44] you know because I'd been preaching and
[1:47:46] she said what's the matter with you you
[1:47:48] act like an old
[1:47:51] man we gran
[1:47:56] you know what the word groan means means
[1:47:59] to complain
[1:48:03] audibly I don't want to complain too
[1:48:05] much but sometimes we
[1:48:08] complain sure we do we want people to
[1:48:11] know what we're going through so we Gran
[1:48:15] it's okay it's part of our condition in
[1:48:17] this
[1:48:18] life it's to sigh under a heavy load
[1:48:23] you know what it also means to
[1:48:26] Grudge to

[1:48:30] James 59 it's the same word go look it
[1:48:32] up same Greek word for Grudge is the
[1:48:33] same Greek word for groan and James says
