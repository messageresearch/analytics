anchor tonight let's stand together we invite brother ben to come amen drop that anchor of faith amen into christ jesus and that anchor will always hold amen so we're thankful he's got a hold let's sing this little course of brother man come i thought pretty fitting song amen as jonah was coming along jesus got a hold of his life wouldn't let him go away well jesus got a hold of my life and he won't let it go now jesus got into my heart he got into my soul oh i used to be oh so sad and now i'm just free and glad because jesus got a hold of my life maybe he won't like go away man you're thankful for that tonight sing it to him i know that jesus got a hold of my life and he won't let it go oh jesus got into my [Music] but now i'm just free and glad cause jesus amen sing it out tonight i know that jesus god jesus got into my heart got into my soul oh yes i used to be oh so sad but now i'm [Applause] [Music] and he won't let it go oh yes jesus got into my heart got into my soul oh i used to be [Applause] [Music] amen aren't you glad he got a hold of your life one day he won't let go amen we're going to talk about that tonight let's go back to jonah jonah chapter 1 and verse 10. jonah chapter 1 and verse 10 it says then were the man or the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them i want to pull that phrase or that sentence as a title tonight why hast thou done this and we'll talk about that and maybe we'll get jonah in the well next time but uh just stood out to me and i pray the lord would without his blessing to that heavenly father we're so thankful to be in your presence tonight so thankful that you come into our hearts into our souls lord you made us oh so glad as the words of the song lord reflect the the reality of our hearts and we were all so sad but you made us all so glad and we think we're thankful for that we're thankful for that happiness that we find as being christians lord i i pray that you would help us to overlook the storms of life and realize you've got it all in your hands lord that the anchor holds in spite of the world's worst tragedies in spite of the storms in spite of everything that happens you've still got a hold of us i'm so thankful for that lord we thank you for this service these that have come out those that are watching i pray you bless each and every one we pray in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated the men in jonah's ship were looking for answers i read a story just a few minutes ago about a man who one late one night he'd gotten drunk and he was uh out on the street he was on his hands and knees under a street light looking for his wallet and a policeman come up to him and he saw him there and he got down there with him and he looked he said what are you looking for he said well i'm looking for my wallet he said well where did you drop it he said all about two blocks down that way the policeman was perplexed and he said he said why are you looking here he said well there wasn't no street light down there he was looking for answers in the wrong places that's why so many people have gotten in trouble their lives got messed up and and they found themselves in a condition they were drunk on the things of the world and they went looking on the internet for answers when answers are found in god's word right amen but jonah didn't have the answers to that difficult question it was difficult the most difficult question he would ever be asked why have you done this and i think every one of us can identify with that at some point in our lives you don't have to you you don't have to have done something like jonah did to uh to identify with that that feeling why did why why am i here what am i doing here and and why did i do what i did and why did i react the way that i did why did i act like that and and you can come up with all kinds of excuses but really there was no excuses the hebrew prophets were were not often seen in the cargo holds of the ships of tarshish it wasn't where they belonged he belonged on the battlefield he belonged in the pulpit he he belonged as a prophet of god standing there and preaching the word of god doing what god told him to do and there's no excuse for what he did and yet god providentially worked in his life and actually made that work out for the better in his life and in his own perfect will and and yet it was the lowest moment of jonah's life the lowest moment of his life and so he didn't have any answers why he did what he did no excuse for it and and yet we know that god's providential work in one person's life to turn an awful decision into a testimony it's no excuse for the next person to try and do the same thing if you try to run from god you may not have the same outcome as jonah god has called us to do his perfect will and so we're to learn from these things not to not to make the same mistakes but to keep from making those mistakes in first corinthians chapter 10 paul lists a a list of things that we shouldn't do that the children of israel did he he said we shouldn't lust or unless there is not sensual lust but it is desire something that you don't need he says we shouldn't committed idolatry we shouldn't commit fornication we shouldn't tempt christ and they tempted christ by continually continually rebelling and and we shouldn't murmur he says and and so he said these things happen unto them for examples and they're written for our admonition that admonition we've went over that when it comes to parental discipline it's warning it's correction it's turning around these things are are done so that we can turn from what they're doing and what they did and do something different and so paul goes on to say wherefore let him that thinketh he stand to take heed lest he fall and brother aaron mcgeary years ago stood in this pulpit and he said something that stuck with me ever since and it's been probably 10 or 15 years ago and he stood in this pulpit and he said that he said you say well they just think they stand he said you can't fall unless you're standing up and that really stuck with me because there were people that were that were standing up he was a prophet of god a real prophet these that went out of the wilderness were god's people but they fell so he said if you think you're standing if you think you're sure about your standing don't take heed because you're going to end up falling but then he goes on to say there has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man and what this verse tells us is that there are no excuses well brother ben you don't know my particular situation but he said there's no temptation taking you but such as is common to man other men deal with it other women deal with it other christians deal with it but he said but god is faithful aren't you glad that he's faithful even when we're not but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it amen so you're able to do it today you're an overcomer you're able to overcome and so that's the that's the attitude that we should take towards that and we know that there is a perfect will and a permissive will in god that there is things and a great example of that is is history itself and the early human beings that they stood there adam and eve in the garden and god's perfect will was for them to remain in the garden and yet if it had not been for their sin we would never have a redeemer his attributes that he had in him would never have been expressed and so that but it is his permissive will but we we have to be careful with that because the redeemer was his perfect will now watch amen it was his perfect attribute to be a redeemer and yet in his perfect will because he's a god who can't make you sin who will not abide sin right he couldn't do that and be god and yet his his attribute his perfect attribute clashed in that instance with his perfect will but then his permissive will worked to allow his perfect attribute to be expressed did you follow me on that so sometimes god wants to express his attribute in your life and so it the sickness that we have that's the permissive will of god all these things it's god allowed it so he can express his attribute in your life oh we ought to just surrender to that will of god today but we should want his perfect will and very early in brother branham's ministry he recognized the difference if you go all the way back to 1947 brother branham says now look he said there is a perfect will of god and there's a permissive will of god and god permitted his prophet to go on he's speaking about balaam in this instance he said yet it wasn't his perfect will it was his permissive will he said and i feel this afternoon is the same thing he said working for this miracle line now if you'll remember the branham's miracle line was when he would have people come and he would pray with that individual until they were healed he wouldn't stop until they were healed sometimes for hours he would pray for one individual and that's how he ended up having a nervous breakdown and leaving the field because he just couldn't bear the strain of it but he he early on knew that wasn't god's perfect will he said it's god's maybe permissive will but it's not his perfect will because brother branham goes on to explain that sometimes he would try to take something off that god had put on the person the person that never repented never done anything to to change it and so he had been better off not to pray that way but just to pray that god's will would be done now now he said now this is just his permissive will this way now this is in 1952 after he started to use the visions more in in the prayer lines he said this is just his permissive will this way he said it's just when i come here and pray and cry and begged him before coming he said until that is laying so close it forces me into it he said you see the vision it'll cut off he said but when it comes upon god's perfect will it just moves down he said and sometimes i'm out for about two hours then he sends in different parts of the country in different places he said that's just every time perfect now brother brandon talk about that how he would get weak when the people would pull on he said that's your faith that's used operating the gift so he looked at that as god's permissive will but god's perfect will was what he would show him and when he would show him like that he didn't get weak because he could see visions all during the day he wouldn't get weak but when he was standing in the platform he could only pray for about 15 people so i'm going somewhere tonight so just hang with me so at the very end of brother banner's ministry you don't see him addressing it in the middle really but at the end he picks up the same theme and he preaches a message that does god ever change his mind about his word and so he goes into the perfect and permissive will once again he said but and if the people won't walk in his perfect will he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in he said notice he permits it all right but he will make it work out for his glory in his perfect will now watch he said it's best to have god's will he said that's what he taught us thy will be done and we can say amen to that tonight that's the prayer that we're taught to pray thy will be done that's his perfect will right he said we he said thy will be done thy kingdom come we must submit ourselves to his will and his word don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it just take it the way it is hey man if you want the answers go back to where the answers are if you want the answers go back to the source i feel like i'm just a little bit loud up top i'm not sure brother gabe my brother peter whoever's running that but you know we must submit ourselves to his will brother branham said it's best to have god's will how many want god's will in their life he said that's what he taught us thy will be done thy kingdom come he said don't question it believe it don't try to find a way around it take it the way it is he said so many wants to go around get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on you find god blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not in his perfect divine will now watch he's blessing you in it he's blessing you in it but it's his permissive will he said he permits it as i said but he will not let it be his perfect will his permissive will is never his perfect will right he will not let it be his perfect will but he'll make it work to honor and bless his perfect will right oh my and see that's where god he knows what we would choose before right he knows who we'll be but when you find somebody who's always trying and attempting to live in the permissive will of god what you find out is that person there's something wrong on the inside and you'll find that there's a person maybe that just doesn't have what it takes to be the bride at the end time i'm just going to be blunt with you tonight because the bride wants the perfect will of god that's why we live the way that we do it would be all right to go to the baptist church or the methodist church or some other church in the permissive will of god but we're here tonight you're here tonight because you want the perfect will of god because you're not just some other church you're his wife you're his wife and there's a place for those in the permissive will of god there's a place for people who are who are in other parts of the economy of god but for us tonight we want his perfect will how many could say amen to that tonight we want everything that he has for us and why do we want that because we love him we're his bride we want his perfect will in our lives i believe there will be a bride like that now watch it was moses who stood there at the rock and brother brown uses the example moses how he smote the rock twice god told him speak to the rock but god said come here moses come here come up here on top you've been a faithful servant he said like the woman with the high heels you climbed talked about that woman the dream that his mother had of a woman in high heels and she climbed up three steps justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and she gets on a pathway but she can't walk with high-heeled shoes on so she can't walk down that pathway he's not talking about legalism in that story that's not what it's about what he's talking about is a person who could come up through luther and wesley and pentecost and yet not be able to walk in the word because they wouldn't stay with god's perfect will he said like the woman with the high heels you climbed moses climb up here look over yonder see the promised land oh lord he said but you're not going over you took my permissive will down here at the rock you've glorified yourself seeing not me you sanctified yourself you didn't sanctify me you didn't keep my original word what i told you to do he said yet the waters did come see a lot of times we think that we're in god's perfect will because we won the argument oh i won i i got what i wanted i'm in god's perfect will that's not how we find out what the perfect will of god is because if you want something bad enough god will give it to you he'll let you have the desire of your heart you don't find out god's perfect will by how blessed you are or how big of a church you go to or don't go to you don't find out god's perfect will by having a big church or by having a good job or by making lots of money that's not how you find out he said brother ben how do we find out is it with the word god's perfect will is always the word he may allow you to do something that's outside of his perfect will that's his permissive will and he may even work to glorify his perfect will but his permissive will will never be his perfect will and i believe there will be a bride at the end time who want to do just what he wants us her to do don't you want to be part of that now he said you can lay hands on the sick and they recover you can prophesy speak with tongues but the thing is keep his original word he said god don't change his mind friend you've got to keep his commission his will you say oh well that was for the disciples he doesn't change if he's still got a disciple how many disciples does he have here tonight if he's still got a disciple that's the same commission go into all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe he said it never changed he can't change he said now you can say well i tell you it ain't for this day he said oh you balaamic you see god don't change he's the same yesterday today and forever but you see my my prejudices are or you know i don't like that because i'm a i'm a sane sensible person he didn't ask you to make sense of it he didn't ask you to reason it out he just asked you to believe it hey man he wants you to take his perfect will yet he grants you permission permission to permit your will permissive will knowing what's in your heart he knows it you say well brother branham i do so and so it don't bother me this is good food on a wednesday night not because i'm saying it but because it's the truth he said it don't bother me god blesses me every day i sing in the spirit i dance in the spirit he'll permit it i've had people tell me that well i'm living in this sin but i i i can raise my hands i feel the presence of god i've had people tell me that very thing he said i wear shorts and i do this it don't bother me i know my faith is in christ not in what i wear if i had a dollar for every time i've heard that in my life my faith is in christ not on what i wear but the bible said there's something to it what do you do you'll make a stumbling block like balaam did before every one of the other women what do you do to your young girls you'll have a bunch of raquettas that's exactly right much a little painted up jezebel's you might be able to say brother ben i can get by with it you might get by with it you could get by i could get by with being late to every service i'm not preaching about being in church late but i could get by with i could get by with uh with giving half-hearted sermons i could get by these song leaders could get by with half-heartedly leading the thing and the people you could get by with just sitting back and and just sitting there like a bump on a pickle you can get by with that said brother ben am i going to go to hell if i don't say amen no am i if the church isn't on fire am i going to am i gonna go to hell to no you're not well okay then bless god i can do what i want but his bride loves him there's something about the bride they love him they wanna be there they to they they want to live for god they want to give it everything that they've got are you with me tonight there's something about you as the bride of christ that you want to give it or your all why because that's what's inside of you you're in love with him and if you don't feel that way tonight but maybe you are the bride but you just let other things get in the way you need to get back your spiritual love life you need to fall back in love with the word until you love to hear the messages again until you love to come to church again until you love to read your bible again amen hallelujah he said he said he blessed israel he said god will prosper you he blesses me i don't doubt that he blessed balaam too certainly will you're walking in his permissive will not his perfect will god doesn't change his mind because he blesses you he blessed israel right out there for 40 years what did they do married wives raised families kiss the children paid their tithes lived right out there oh church i don't want to be a people that's in his permissive will i don't want to just be another church or you hear me death reading today about how that the glory of the lord filled the temple there in solomon's day and in acts 2 it says that the the spirit come down and filled the house that they were sitting in and acts 4 it happened again it filled the house they were sitting in i want to strive for that i want to strive for that i want i don't want to sit in his permissive will and say well we can come to church and read a few quotes and we'll be okay we can come and sing a few songs and we'll be okay and raise our hand once in a while but i want to be in his perfect will if his perfect will is to have a church that's on fire a church that loves the lord a church that the atmosphere is right then that's what i want to be i don't want to be anything less than what his perfect will is are you with me tonight he said but it's wednesday night i want his perfect will on a wednesday night i want his perfect will on a sunday morning a sunday night every service may not be shouting and running and everything else because that's not always his perfect will but it is his perfect will for his people to love him are you with me now amen he said god blessed him in the wilderness them fed them with the man on and on every one of them perished because they never kept his original will his word they took his permissive way go ahead but you remember when they left kadesh they never journeyed any farther they just went around and around in the wilderness where they could have been out in two days after that they could could have been on the promised land they journeyed 40 years every one of them died but joshua and caleb the ones that stayed on the original word now brother branham said any move from the original plan of god throws the whole thing out of cater this is the next day that he preached another sermon he said any move out of the original plan of god throws the whole thing out of cater we can't move from that original word he said we talked on it last evening evening before last on balaam he got god's answer straight and clear don't go but he has a permissive will you can work in that if you wish to and god will make it honor him but it's still not god's perfect will and that's what we should strive for his perfect will not his permissive will he said the kingdom of god i love this the kingdom of god which is in the earth today can never be set up justly on permissive will the millennium won't be permissive will. are you with me now neither will the kingdom of god on the earth neither will his end time bride it won't be permissive will and those that live in that permissive will will end up back in denominationalism right because they they live in that realm but we don't live in that realm we live in his perfect world he did brother ben does that mean i do everything right no it doesn't it means you strive for that it means you want that your desire is that sure you're going to mess up but your desire is right your heart is right and i think that's where brother branham is going with jonah as we look here that really maybe we give jonah a little bit of a hard time about being a backsider brother branham did too but there come a time when brother branham realized well maybe he wasn't really a backsider but he just couldn't decide what to do and and he ended up out on in a place where he didn't even know how he got there what are you doing here they said why did you do this i don't even know somehow it was in the plan of god oh my now brother branham said it's got to come back to his perfect will you think of abraham and hagar that was god's permissive will polygamy was god's permissive will not his perfect will how do you know that because in the beginning he created one man and one woman right he created one uh a male deal with a bunch of female deer there was one uh one male of almost every uh every kind that could have have many but not with man it's one and one so again you see somebody trying to live in polygamy they're living in god's permissive will trying to and he don't allow that today because the bible tells us at the times of this ignorance god winked at but now he commandeth all men everywhere to repent it's just an excuse because the man wants to fulfill lust i'm just being honest with you tonight so you find somebody that that'll constantly i've had people try to constantly give me their revelation on marriage and divorce that oh god allows polygamy god allows polygamy not anymore we're not living in permissive will anymore we're living in his perfect will and there's some things that he's allowed even between a man and a woman that one day won't be there anymore jesus said in the in heaven they don't marry or give in marriage but while we're here but see we don't fully go into his perfect will until we leave here you understand but we've strived for it everything we can do mark twain had a good uh rejoinder to that a mormon man asked him he said he said don't you believe in polygamy he said no he said the scripture's against it he said well show me the scripture he said the bible says no man can serve two masters brother branham said so we really believe that god never changes his mind about what he said he always keeps it true do you believe that tonight but he has a permissive will he said now there's where the trouble lays we try to work on god's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right i love this he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will there's nothing i've read this to you before but it just fits here there's nothing will go wrong with god now we're going to pull out and see the big picture you understand in the in the micro when you're looking at in your own life you want to do the perfect will of god strive for the perfect will of god but yet you know you've messed up you know you've done things that weren't in the perfect will of god but what's god going to do because you're his bride you're his elect you want to be in his perfect will i believe even jonah wanted to be in his perfect will his flesh his mind whatever it was just didn't allow him to do it so god made a way god prepared a fish amen amen maybe you come into this earth weak in some way maybe you come in and you find yourself you found yourself in trouble in sin or in some kind of an issue where you just can't seem to believe like you want to but god has made a way for you to overcome that to be in his perfect will you can't look around say well i don't know why i'm where i'm at and i don't understand no just keep going forward commit yourself to the lord amen amen he said we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this even the world's supposed to be like this right but again looking at it from our own individual responsibility lord i want to be in your perfect will yet i know you've got all things working according to your plan romans 8 28 we know that all things work together for good to them love god i believe we read this last week as well to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son to be conformed so you wouldn't always be in the image of his son but you're going to be made in the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren aren't you glad he's still working on you i'm so glad he's still working on me he hasn't given up on me yet he's still working on me i want him to be proud of me you want him to be proud of you brother branham talked about the holy ghost going the tudor you know i'm going back and he's given the drama of it telling the father he said well he he he just he just won't do what you tell him to do he won't follow directions but then you come to that place of adoption where you're willing to stand there and he said he's just like you doesn't that make you proud i want to be as i want god to be as proud of me as alan was of matinee this week that right it makes you proud doesn't when your kids do something i'm always asking people about my kids at school hey how they doing i asked their friends how are they in school because you don't get sealed much in school what do they do they pray over their foods you know and and i'm always proud when they tell me good things about my kids why because i want them to reflect the work that god's done in my life i don't want them to reflect me in the natural but i got you've got to come to a point in your life where you could say son or daughter you follow me do what i do you'll be okay do what i did because i accepted christ as a savior for my sins i was baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and i have been forgiven and i've received the baptism of the holy ghost so you can follow me walk in my footsteps do the same things and you'll have the same results but he wanted to be the firstborn among many brethren the bible reveals that god knows every detail of the past present and future do you believe that and he actively works in the present to bring about his future plan he's not just sitting back letting things happen that's why we don't have to worry you don't have to fix it it's not up to us to to fix oh we got to get all the doctrine right figure everything out no it's not up to us to fix it god knows what he's doing he just said have you ever been good at something and watched somebody else just mess it up and mess it up and usually i worked in the title industry the realtors were usually the ones that did it they'd come in there and just constantly on my case and why don't you do it this way why don't you do it this way why don't you do it that way well you know i have the license all right i've been trained i spent 15 years in the industry i know what i'm doing it frustrates you don't it or maybe you had a boss that didn't know what they were doing we had a guy buy us out one time in the title industry and he bought our industry come from the another insurance industry wasn't land title at all and he decided he was going to buy out a title industry and when he did he knew nothing about it but he was constantly making improvements walking in there telling you why don't you do this why don't you do that and uh and finally uh i guess you know you just get tired of it you say why don't you go away and i can do my job you think god ever feels like that i'm just trying to bring it down on a human level now why don't you just go away so i can do my job you're constantly worrying about tomorrow you're constantly meddling with everything that's going on you're constantly trying to fix stuff and figure stuff out and i've already got it done the whale's already in the ocean he's been growing for years the fish has gotten big everything's already laid out but here you are worrying about what's going to happen tomorrow it's time you committed that to god let him do it god says let me do it i'm i'm qualified to do it i'm trained to do it i i i'm the one who created you amen i i know my thoughts concerning you thoughts of peace and not of evil bringing expected in god says i know you i i birthed you i brought you where you were at don't don't speak to me like i don't know what i'm doing oh god no brother branham if you'll bear with me for just a few more minutes tonight we'll get through this brother branham preaches for years that jonah was backslid for years brother branham preached that jonah was backstage sometime around 1958 when he changed i think actually in 1959 i think this was the sermon when brother branham begins to make it clear and it was in the queen of sheba because he's dealing with what jesus said about jonah being a sign the sign of the prophet jonas and he's beginning to realize also in his own ministry this parallels with what we said at the beginning brother branham even the visions he said well this isn't the perfect will of god but he come to find out later was the sign of the son of man now think about it huh he he's he's growing in his own understanding of that so he comes to the sign of son of man this is linked to that because when he begins to go preaching he preaches it over and over again the queen of sheba the queen of the south all those sermons he preaches about the queen of sheba and in those sermons he deals with the son of man ministry and so in dealing with that he begins to defend jonah right he's defending himself i think too he said let's stop just for a minute to straighten my expression that i made about jonah i don't know what people do with that who believe that everything brother random ever said was thus saith the lord i believe brother bran was a prophet whenever he said anything he said but if you believe everything he ever said was thus death lord you don't allow him to grow as a prophet right he said let's just stop just for a minute to straighten my expression i made about joan he said i do not believe he was backslid he said he did what god told him not to do he said but god knew all the time he was going to do it for god's infinite and he knows all things he said and we are told or i have read that the people of nineveh were worshipers of idols and their sins had got great and one of their gods especially the god of the sea was a whale and it was the god of the sea because it was the largest specie in the sea he said in the people their occupation was fishing and as all of them at their tasks that morning drawing in the nets of fishes all of a sudden up comes the god of the sea opens up his mouth and the prophet walks out sure they repented it was all in order now watch brother branham's looking at the big picture now a prophet was a sign and and really both are true if you think about it as we said brother comes back later and preaches a man running from the presence of the lord and so it really donate again there's no excuse for what jonah did and yet a prophet is a sign watch out brother branham always keeps coming back to the fact he was a prophet now we got to be careful with this again because you say well i'll just i'll just do like joan i'll just go do everything against the word of god and then god will just bring it out the way he wants it we can't do it like that you remember brother branham couldn't smoke or drink some of us did right brother branham tried to smoke couldn't smoke why he was a prophet you're not less of a christian than he was he still had to be saved but god was saving him for a special purpose right he had to have a clean vessel for that purpose and so god would save him from things maybe he wouldn't save me from right some of us he tried to commit suicide and everything else and and and that don't mean that you should right it's like that's the danger of using a prophet's life as an example christ is our example but see here was a prophet who was going out and he was a sign but not necessarily an example does that make sense it doesn't mean you should do what he did or we'd all go out and say well ezekiel laid out there naked on his side for so many days we'll just all go do that and and one of the prophets adam ate a scroll let's just all go eat the scroll but it's a sign right and jonah is a sign it's a sign of the son of man sign of the resurrection god's going to use him for a special purpose and brother brown said now again and behold a greater than solomon is here which is the same sermon just a different title in 1962 he comes on a little stronger he said the prophet when he got down to the sea coast instead of going to nineveh he took a ship that was selling out to tarshish he said now we've always thought that was a shortcut or dodging the duty he said but i'm going to try to take up for that preacher tonight i'm going to say that i believe he was a prophet and was exactly in the will of god he said i believe he was following the leading of the spirit i believe he was led to go that way he said he didn't understand it after god had commissioned him one place and here he found himself going another way again brother brandon said jonah was a prophet he said many people condemn jonah and say well he was an old backslider he wasn't backslid a man of god the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the lord he said you believe that he said i don't care what the man of god does if he's ordained of god he might do things he thinks is crazy to himself but if you'll only watch it works out right out exactly right if he just goes the way he's led now watch i hope you realize this it doesn't make it right for jonah to do it and god will deal with him later but he had to do it for a reason sometimes god will allow a pastor brother branham said even the ones in one place he said he lets him go out with the sheep it let him go a certain direction with the sheep and and you wonder why was he allowed to do that well it's god's gonna deal with him later right you should always stay with the word but yet god may allow that just so that the sheep can be corrected and brought back to a certain place we don't understand god's work we just let him do it so again if you find yourself saying and people are asking you why did you do what you did that's not the question you have to answer the question is what are you going to do now see god is perfect the men he uses are not but he's backs them up right brother branham talked about the seven spirits of god he had the seven spirits of god in the seven stars revelation three and one he said this same lord identified himself with man that identified himself with man in the incarnation is again identifying himself with man by his spirit within man now remember the seven messengers the seven stars was his spirit within man this christ was the incarnation of god this is spirit within man he said these are mine saith the lord they're still his oh my oh my the seven spirit-filled messengers are the lords that's why i'd hate to spend all my time criticizing them he said they may be repudiated they may be questioned you realize the prophet's telling us what would happen today people say well they don't know what they're talking about that's what they're doing i've gotten i didn't bring it out to you but i threw it in the trash but i got a book the other day and some of you may get it in the mail if you do bring it to me and i'll throw it in the same trash can but i got a a book just just these claims they put on the internet they put them into a book paid a lot of money put them in a book about that thick trying to prove brother branham influenced the assassination of john f kennedy and all kinds of conspiracy theories like that it's not even worth giving your time to i got to looking at that i thought he told us that was going to happen they may be repudiated they may be questioned but they're gods he said indeed the human minds they may not even seem to qualify he said nevertheless they are the messengers for their age he said well brother branham did this and this and this if you put brother branham's life up next to any preacher you're going to feel sorry for the other preacher in signs and wonders in the way that he lived and the way he lived according to his conscience god allowed us to have a prophet who did a lot of things right but he was human allowed that too sure god allowed him to say some things that people would use to try to bring him down god allowed it that's same thing he did with abraham he said god you said abraham he lied he was the moses he rebelled to jonah he disobeyed a samson he sinned to david he murdered he also used the joshua and a joseph and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose histories seem to be perfect again god will deal with them god dealt with david he dealt with joshua he dealt with joseph he said all were and are his none dare deny that he used in bind through the holy spirit that he put within them to their own master they stood or failed and in them all was accomplished the sovereign will of god let external history attempt to refute this let them write the books it still stands the eternal god still walks amongst the golden lamp stands and sends his messengers by his spirit with the word to the people of every age now brother brown wasn't justifying sin a christian minister has a higher calling than even an israelite king you know that brother branham angel told brother branham he said you have a higher calling than an old testament prophet god wouldn't let brother branham get by some of the things they got by with but brother brandon put it this way said don't put your confidence in a man when that man leaves the word of god you leave the man but it doesn't mean he's not god's man if he's god's man god will correct him i'll spend all your time well was i deceived but i go through all this oh god will correct him if he was god's man huh don't don't don't let that shake your faith you just stay with the word what's jonah going to do that's where i wanted to come to in this service that's why i couldn't get jonah in the well and the fish the sailors said why did you do this he didn't know he never answers the question you don't have to be able to explain your past to trust god with your future you don't have to be able to explain why you're where you're at in order to trust god with your future yes aren't you glad you serve a god like that jonah 1-11 said they said unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be common to us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous the storm was going on he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you now the bible tells us that they didn't want to do it so they attempted to row and couldn't do it remember but remember you you can't get by you've got to do what god wants you to do he told paul he said it's hard to kick against the pricks right so they're rolling they're trying to trying to get it to shore and they couldn't do it and finally they just gave up and verse 15 says they took up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging where did he get this from you think about it why the ocean why why if it was me i'd say lord have mercy till we get to shore row boys row where can i get find a ore where can i get to a place where i can help why didn't you guys some of us would be walking around why didn't you guys build this better didn't you know this was storm season what you doing offering passage to tarsus during storm season we like to blame other people don't we what's the point of giving me safe passage to tarshish when you're gonna get out in the middle and the storm blows up how come you didn't build the boat better why didn't you do that but jonah knew oh god he knew he had disobeyed god and he knew he was in a place he couldn't explain why he was there but he knew what he had to do about it you see the way back into the perfect will of god is by committing yourself to god every time that i have a funeral we do what's called a committal at the end joe knows what that is at the very end when you have a graveside service at the end of the graveside service and i have a little thing that i read or recite from memory and it's and it's something like ashes to ashes and dust to dust we commit our brother to the ground or our sister to the ground so the imperishable spirit may be with the lord it's called a committal that's what it used to be called at the end of a service brother branham calls at the end of a service when he prays for everybody when the prayer line's done he calls it a committal prayer a committal prayer what is that it's lord we're giving the rest of this to you we can't do any more right right we're committing them to the ground i think it's an important part of a christian burial because you're committing that body to the ground you can't do nothing for it maybe doctors have done all that they can and family has done all that they can they've loved and nurtured and protected and here's this person they're being committed to the ground and you stand there and say ashes to ashes and dust to dust you commit them to the ground and then when they there's nothing you can do but god can and i love to take first thessalonians 4 and read it at the end of the service or at the graveside because especially when it's a christian and you know where they're going because you believe that the body you commit to the earth will be raised up again you can't do it you can't put it back together it might be completely decomposed you can't do it but god can and don't you see when you get out of the will of god when you've done so you find yourself in a place you can't explain even when you're sick or in need and you find yourself in a situation that a storm that you can't get out of it's time to commit yourself to the water commit yourself to the will of god say lord i can't do nothing more about it i'm tired of manhandling it tired of putting my hands on it that's why we talked about sunday brother ram said the man put his hand on it when he put his hand on he put his hands on the word and only the holy ghost has a right to the word we don't put our hands on the word of god we can't we can't tell god what to do jonah realized that he was out of his hands now he tried to get out of it he wasn't going any farther oh god don't you realize that's where your kids have to get that's where you have to get that's the condition they have to get in and where they can't go any farther and god has such a storm going on that there's nowhere to go but into the ocean yes and again if it was me if they tried to throw me in i'd been saying hey wait a minute stop don't don't throw me in the water that's the worst place at least in the boat i might make it in the water i'm not gonna make it but jonah had enough confidence in the god that he served he had that kind of confidence tonight he had that kind of a confidence that if he went in the water if he committed himself to the water amen he said commit me to the sea lord i'm yours i can't change the past but i can commit myself to your mercy and when i commit myself to the mercy of god what happens god has something prepared a way out for me because i'm not relying on my own instinct i'm not relying on my own abilities i'm not relying i've done everything i can do i committed to you lord i commit my family to you i commit this church to you i commit everything i have to you not relying on my own abilities anymore let me fall into the arms of god and jonah they pick him up crosses his arms and they lay him in the sea like a dead man he said god i can't control my life anymore that's what they do to dead men toss them overboard he just goes overboard you don't fight it he don't try to swim he just falls into the ocean are you hearing me tonight that's the place we have to get with god it just falls into the ocean look brother branham said there's a perfect way in a permissive way he says if i feel that if god here on the platform can show me things it has been in my room so so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me what he wants me to do but i feel as long as i've got it all hooked up or i feel like then he won't put his hands on it as long as i'm doing it yeah he said and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them god can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself you're grabbing a hold of things trying to keep them from dragging you out of the boat i hope you can see it tonight just let go he said you're finding it yourself just let loose and let him do it just commit it to him he said the greatest weapon that i know of of a christian today is a committal to god when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and god will take care of it jonah committed himself to the sea like we commit a dead man a dead body lord we believe in the resurrection you see how was the sign of the resurrection he was dead he can't live in the ocean oh god you may be facing a situation you know you can't get through you can't live like that commit yourself to the will of god commit yourself to the sea and at that moment jonah fell into the perfect will of god oh god the bible said commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass you're worried about it we worry so much some of you older people that are married you look back and see all the people you worried about that you didn't end up married to you know what i'm talking about but god worked it out the way he wanted it now some of you may question that now but god did that you got to commit yourself to the marriage i'm committed or maybe you should be but just trying to but you know what i'm saying you got to let yourself let it go i've committed to this why argue about things that happened years ago that i can't change why suffer over things that i have no ability and this jonah finally realizes this if god wants me to go to nineveh i'm gonna go to nineveh or i'm gonna die one of the two is gonna happen i can't i can't fight god see jesus did the same thing he committed himself to the cross and then he committed his spirit into the hands of god into thine hand i commit my spirit amen he quoted psalms 31 5 into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth oh my listen the bible tells us that when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously and he committed himself to the grave believing what god said when he said i will not suffer leave my my soul in hell or suffer from my holy one to see corruption he believed one word preach spoken by baxten king but he believed it right because he was under inspiration when he said it oh god he believed it maybe you could grab a hold of something tonight and believe it it's not so much about what's said or who's saying it can you believe it he committed himself to the grave but on the third day he come out of the grave just like jonah come out of the whale the belly of the well let that be our example as the musicians come tonight let that be our example so we can be in the perfect will of god you can't do it fighting the waves or fighting the wind or fighting the sailors who are throwing you in as a dead man you just got to commit yourself to the lord he'll bring it to pass he knows what he's doing he's bigger than me bigger than you aren't you glad that he is i can't even get myself to do everything i know to do i'm not talking about big things i'm talking about just i want to pray more i want to read more are you with me how am i supposed to rule the affairs of the world if i can't even get myself we spend so much time worrying about everything else we can't even get ourselves in order god help me to commit commit my children to you commit my marriage to you commit my my way my life my life the way that i walk i can't help what's happened in the past but today lord i'm falling into the perfect will of god i'm not going to go on like i was [Music] i'm done i give myself to you lord i surrender everything that i have maybe you could just pray that way as we close tonight as we commit these things to god oh god lord you you rule my life you've known me since before i was even born i was in your mind before the foundation of the earth lord and if you're so big and i'm so little surely lord yet you cared enough about me to know me and to lead me and to guide me surely i can let you handle the big stuff and even the little things god the worries and the fears lord i don't understand i don't know why some lose so many loved ones it breaks my heart i i don't know but we committed to you lord i don't understand why some people die so young but we commit them to you lord you know what's best i don't understand why some things have to happen why some families split up and some stay together and people leave and people come i want every person that's ever been in this church to be right here but lord we committed to you [Music] we fall into your perfect will today we believe we trust in your mercy lord we believe that you're able to do it lord you're exceedingly abundantly more than we could ask or think if you prepared a world that we we try to prepare a house sword we try to fix it up just right but it's not ever perfect but lord you've prepared a place that we'll love the moment we step into it a body we will have no issues with you know us so well lord if you can do that i pray you'd help us to commit our way to you tonight lord everything that we are everything that we everything all our talents all our gifts or lack thereof lord we give it to you tonight and we pray lord that you would accept it lord like a love gift something that was dedicated it was called it was committed to the to the temple once it was committed it was reckoned as dead oh god may it be so with us lord let us be dead in ourselves and found in you in your perfect will i pray you granted today lord we commit ourselves to the ocean to whatever might come whatever people say whatever might happen we commit ourselves we're going to follow you from here on out we're going to live for you moment we can control things again the moment we have any decision to make lord we're going to make the right ones we can't change the past but from now on lord help us to do what we can and yet if we fail again we know that you'll be there to catch us when we fall lord i pray that you'd help us each one we commit ourselves to you tonight in jesus name amen hallelujah why don't we just stand and worship him for a minute tonight if you need prayer the altar is open let's just worship him a
