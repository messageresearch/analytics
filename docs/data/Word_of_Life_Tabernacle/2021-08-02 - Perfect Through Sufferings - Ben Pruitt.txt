========================================

you would not be who you are today unless you've been through what you've been through and some people do suffer more than others i wish i had an answer for that but there's a character he's working in your life and he'll do what it takes to bring that character out if he has to embarrass you if he has to if he has to make everything fall apart and it won't be because you're doing anything wrong look at job job was the best man on the earth god's best man and god removed the head drowning about him and suffering began to come he wanted to perfect his character wasn't because he was a bad person he was the best amen god does this for the best oh my he said according to paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this james 1 2-4 my brother encountered all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing why does he stand by look he said the reason is in romans 8 17 to 18 if children than heirs heirs of god and joining us with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us you realize job had to go through that and trust god and all he had was a bible written in stars didn't have a church age book i'm so thankful that we do he didn't have a message i'm so thankful that we do but all he had was a bible written in stars no old testament no new testament all he had was a bible written in stars and somehow he saw in those stars and that ox and those things that were there somehow he saw the purpose of god and in god revealing to him and showing him a redeemer amen oh god and think about it god never did tell him why he never did there's no inclination in the book of job that he ever told him why he suffered but he said there's a redeemer he did not show him why he suffered but he showed him my i know my redeemer lives in the last days he'll stand on the earth hallelujah so what you've got to know today know that he knows know that your redeemer is there and it'll hold you you see brother branham said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you've heard this all before but listen to it now in this context he says you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic it's a powerful statement and you say well the person has to have experience then experience is not the same thing as character because you learn from experience but you can learn good things or bad things it's true it's how you respond to the suffering right if job had said okay i give up it's all over i'm giving up it would have proved who he was but god allowed him to suffer like that because he knew that he wouldn't give up amen he may have felt like it but he knew i'm so glad he knew that the smyrna church age could take it look at the confidence he puts in here today oh i feel his presence here this afternoon don't you love him listen he said since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's throne that we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering amen i believe it was paul that called it your light affliction which is about for a moment very bad the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy but the jt to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation see we're not too careful we baby things so much that we want everything to come easy everybody to be able to and i do i want so bad as a pastor to make the way easy for you but listen if you're gonna rain if you're ever gonna reign you're gonna have to overcome and i can't overcome for you i can help you but i can't overcome for you listen thinking not strange concerning amen the fiery trials that are to try you this is what peter said is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir we all have trials we are all tried and chastened to sons not one but goes through that i've read this over and over again in my life but i got a revelation of this one day i was sitting right back here brother brayden savage come and preach for us i think it was on a wednesday night and he'd come and preach this and read this quote and it just hit me it just really hit me he says the church that is not suffering is not being tried hasn't got it that's not necessarily how we would identify the church to go to is it think about it the church that isn't suffering and it's not being tried you see look at the message people what they're going through right now but look if we weren't suffering we wouldn't have it it isn't of god i'm sitting back there and well he's preaching probably been a year ago now i'm sitting back there and it just hit me i thought thank you god you're telling me that i'm yours you're telling me that we're a church that should exist that should be here because if we weren't suffering we haven't got it see we think in our carnal mindset that if you're not suffering if everything's going good and everything works right and every and there's a big bunch of people and everything's right that's the church that's got it but he said the church that is not suffering it's not being tried hasn't got it but i'll tell you this some of them big churches suffer too you just don't realize it huh many of them suffer many of the pastors suffer you don't know what some of the pastors have been through who have great ministries today who put in their time and been through it preaching to small groups of people working with people over and over being rejected over and over you don't understand what some people have been through it if you want to gain a ministry that reflects christ there's got to be you've got to enter into that through suffering you want to be a church that's of god you've got to enter into that through suffering hebrews 12 6 and 8 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement we're of all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons now look this special condition in smyrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there is no true believer free from it this is of god this is the will of god it is needful he said we need the lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be christ-like in doing it say lord teach me the truth about the millennium lord teach me the truth about the oneness of god and we can say amen to all of that i want to know it but here he said we need god to teach us the truth that we can suffer and be christ-like in doing it love suffereth long and his kind blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you shall say oh manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted today the prophets which were before you i love this the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of god's disapproval well if i was right maybe this wouldn't have happened to me maybe this wouldn't have happened in my home in my relationship in in my church if i was right maybe it wouldn't happen no the cloudy skies are no signs of his disapproval neither are bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us ask yourself that question today does he love me does he love me oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us hallelujah for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit placing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him david in psalms he said what shall i offer to the lord who's given so much to me what can i ever give him back he's forgiven me excuse me for being a baby but it's the truth today he's forgiven me over and over and over again he led me in green pastures by still waters prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies what can i return to him i can't do for him what he did for me he said but i'll pay my vows in the midst of the congregation he said i will take the cup and the cup is the cup that you're giving of suffering it's the compass in type it be communion as well i will take it i'll be identified with him but i will take the cup i will i will partake of his suffering or whatever whatever he has ordained for my life whatever he's called for me to be i'll do that maybe you're a mother that suffers and worries about your kids and wonders what's going to happen but that's your cup that's what he that's what he allowed you to be in life then he said i will take that cup and i'll pay my vows in the midst of the congregation i'll raise my hands i'll worship i'll do i'll i'll do that's nothing like what he did i can't repay what he did but i can pay my vows how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he and his wisdom allow us to come to pass very bad oh god help me sometimes we misidentify what's wrong with us we think that the problem is what what's happening in our lives and we want that taken away but we misidentify it many times god wants to teach us how to suffer patiently he wants to teach us how to react in a bad situation he wants to teach us how to love the unlovable we think the problem we say lord take this away take this away take this away and we don't realize we're praying against the will of god we should say lord if it be possible take this away we should always pray that way by the way start your prayer that way if it's possible take this away nevertheless how did the three hebrew children stand there they said we believe our god's able to deliver us but if he chooses not to hallelujah we will still not bow we will not serve your your gods we will not bow to the world why because even if you choose not to rescue me from my situation you're still god and so not rescuing me would be the best thing you can do because god never does less than his best thing tell you what you're gonna stop giving me sunday nights to preach but oh god listen he said well you don't understand my child brother ben the bible tells us so what does the word say so you have to bring your mind back to the word counseling many times is listening and then reminding people of what the word says let's come back to the word i know what's going on in your life but let's come back to the word let's come back to the word what does the word say there are no temptation taking you but such as is common to man somebody else suffers like that and usually you can find somebody in worse shape but god is faithful hallelujah who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able so your feelings will lie to you they'll tell you you can't go through this you can't make it but god said i already promised i will not suffer you to be tempted above what you're able but we're with the temptation also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear years ago but jt when i was at bransville i studied that word and i found out that he's painting a word picture in the original greek he's talking about someone that's been shipwrecked in the middle of the ocean but yet they're close enough they can see land and if they'll swim they can make it it might be hard they might have they might get to take the last ounce of their strength but he said with the temptation he will be able to make a way of escape hallelujah it may be difficult you might have to struggle you might have to prop your eyelids open in church you might have to worry you know there might be times where you fail but you know there is a way of escape there is a way of escape he didn't say there might be or there sometimes would be he said there is a way of escape he will make a way to escape that you may be able to bury it jesus suffering he was made perfect look he was suffering in the garden and it drew him into close communion with the father think about that it drew him into close community what did it do for him and it struck me lately how we want other people to participate in our suffering don't we we're human beings on some level we want people to participate people cry out on social media they want people to participate they want you know but jesus was human too look what he did in the garden he was the god man but in the garden his disciples stopped and the bible says jesus went a little further a little further than they could go aren't you glad he did but he went a little further he goes and prays and he goes back he says watch and pray won't you watch and pray but it wasn't their burden it wasn't their passion it wasn't theirs they could not do it he said can't you even watch with me one hour the human side of him he wanted them to at least acknowledge his suffering and they just fell asleep it didn't bother them enough to keep them awake and many times as humans we we want that we want somebody to participate in our sufferings we want somebody that can reach out to us and participate and empathize with us but you know where you'll find that you'll only find that in those who've suffered themselves you'll never find that somebody who's always been handed everything but he had to bear it alone but what did he do he got down on his knees and he came in close communion with his father when it was him and his father alone amen that's what you and i have to do he was our example in these things that when we suffer when we're wrongfully accused when no one else will bear our burdens with us we sit we kneel down and we cry out to god and say lord you're my father if it's possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine we find an angel came and strengthened him i believe angels will strengthen you during that time musicians go ahead and come i'm you know in the afternoon you always want to preach a happy sermon so people will stay awake but i believe there's happiness to be found here and finding god's will for our lives even in suffering in 1895 andrew murray the great great preacher of the past he was in england suffering from a terrible back painful back he'd had an injury years before one morning he's eating breakfast in his room his host just told him of a woman downstairs who was in great trouble and wanted to know if you had any advice for and andrew murray handed her a paper he'd been writing on and said give her this advice i'm writing down for myself maybe that she'll find it helpful he wrote this he says in time of trouble say first he brought me here it is by his will i am in this straight place or this hard place in that i will rest next he will keep me here in his love and give me grace in this trial to behave as his child then say he will make the trial a blessing teaching me lessons he intends me to learn amen teaching me lessons he intends me to learn and working in me the grace he means to bestow and last in his good time he can bring me out again because i am here by god's appointment in his keeping under his training for his time andrew murray didn't write that for her he wrote it for himself i've been told that brother donny's church we looked at that and some 90 people something like that i noticed a name with a jim babb there that had covert and different ones some of the brothers been around there for years and meant so much to his ministry we've been blessed church we've been blessed we haven't suffered more than we have and yet i know some of you have and we've been through a lot but when it comes to this covet thing you think of sister karen pruitt and what what did that family do to deserve and she's in that position right now i think a brother robert i know he's probably watching this afternoon sitting at home and sister gene you know what do you what do you do to go through those things god's doing something see it's god's appointment that you're here you're in his care under his training for his time i found out today that the entire church at claremore oklahoma brother bryce and them our entire church has got coveted people that are sick and even dying i had a assist a dear sister who helped me early in my ministry by encouraging me and and doing things and she was in a church i was preaching in in the mountain home area sister sheila stoner found out she passed away the other day she was always a bright spot in my day even to this day she kept she'd keep me updated and things that i'm gonna miss that by the way a lot of people have to go through what they go through but you see god lets you go through some things so you can feel for them maybe in a time when this church was filled up all the time i don't know if it was but perhaps at one time years ago it was always filled up but now you can you can identify with the church it struggles i know that's plain speaking but it's the truth you've been through it you can identify with that but see we're not just a body here we're a body all around the world when one member suffers we all suffer with it i wonder today if we could if they'll play something softly i wonder if we could just bow our heads and just talk to god for a moment i believe in your prayers today saints i believe in them i believe in them i i believe that it's important that you pray but also believe in what you pray and who you are i guess i just not to put myself in the place of christ but to be a little bit like jesus today would you pray for with me for one hour i believe we do have something that the disciples didn't have and i'm not asking you to pray for an hour but just just to turn our thoughts and our mind toward others who are suffering today i know there's there's things that need to happen i'm so god i'm so glad god's been gracious to us but if we could just look at others who are suffering maybe not think of yourself today but maybe there's somebody that you can think of or you've been praying for that's suffering that's going through it would you just talk to god about them now and and and and then we'll pay our vows we'll worship god what else can we do he's brought us through so much but let's just talk to him for a moment should we can we do that heavenly father lord jesus we love you today so grateful for your presence here on a sunday afternoon or that you took time to be with us lord to just come down among us sit through your word and just show us you had to suffer so you know what it's like when we suffered lord we've suffered we some here suffer with covet and different things in the past lord they can feel for other people i pray you'd help them today i pray you'd reach down lord that church in claremore oh god i pray you'd rid the sickness of that place lord i know there's people pray in other places i'm sure there's many other churches suffering lord struggling right now oh god that come in my heart today because i heard about it these are brother donny sometimes it just becomes nameless faithless people but lord some people that we've known and others that that maybe we've heard of lord that just need a special touch today i pray god that you'd reach down where they're at lord we know their church is praying others are praying won't you watch with me one hour we see the desire of your heart lord lord i pray that that would be us today maybe there's some in this church lord that suffer maybe they have suffered in life but they can enter in for somebody else who's going through a similar situation and i pray for that person today think of brother robert sitting there and his mother and different ones lord if they hear this today and i pray god that you'd help them to understand that they are in your time and your perfect will lord and we don't always understand why but we know you're we're in your hands oh god i pray for them today i pray with whatever empathy that i have whatever whatever i can i can't identify with everybody but you can lord you went through so much while you were here that you're able to suffer with each one and able to be a high priest to every every person i'm so thankful of that lord lord with whatever empathy we have whatever sympathy we could show oh god i pray he would help us to suffer one with another realizing that one day there will be glory revealed in us and the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared to the glory revealed in us on that day i pray you'd grant it lord lord one day i'm going to sit down with some of these people lord in that day i'm going to sit down with them and now we'll be in his throne with him judging lord those who have come before us those who have given a cup of cold water those who have come in our path oh god would you develop a character in us here so that we can judge righteously on that day we don't want to ever react on out of the things of the world or a desire for retribution but lord may we be like you in all things or we know we don't become that overnight but there's something about yielding ourselves we have to be taught to yield ourselves even in that body that was created the body for god you still had to suffer and learn obedience by the things you suffered teach us obedience today teach us through your word and through our lives what it means to obey the word i pray you would do it today i thank you for these people coming lord as we now turn our thoughts towards you and thank you for what you've done and thank you for your goodness and worship you just a moment oh lord i pray that there'd be a true worship would come from our hearts that you would recognize it as being from you lord is something that is worth not just an emotion or something that's worked out but god something that comes from the inside of the inside lord of returning a paying of our vows lord like the leper that was cleansed one came back and said thank you and was delivered of all his sins i pray it would be so with us lord we thank you for all that you've done what you will do lord what you're doing right now in your bride thank you for it in jesus name
