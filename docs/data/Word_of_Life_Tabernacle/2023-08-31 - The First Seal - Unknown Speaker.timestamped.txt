[44:33] at the end time and so we know where
[44:35] we're at and you can go and and find all
[44:38] of those scriptures I'm sure that you're
[44:40] familiar with them now in in in
[44:42] Revelation when this uh when John sees
[44:46] the seal when the seal opens he sees it
[44:49] in symbol form and that's the way it was
[44:51] revealed to that early church was in
[44:54] symbol form because because it had to be
[44:56] in a form it wasn't time yet for it to
[45:00] be in its reality form it had to be in
[45:02] symbol and so he sees a white horse
[45:05] riding and he sees one that set on him
[45:08] he didn't know who he was he had a bow
[45:10] and he had a crown or crown was given to
[45:12] him and he went forth conquering and to
[45:15] conquer so but this had to be known in
[45:19] reality before the end so we know he
[45:22] said I saw when the lamb opened one of
[45:24] the seals I heard as it work
[45:26] the noise of Thunder we know that the
[45:28] Thunder was the voice of God when the
[45:31] seal opened I you know if people would
[45:33] really listen to the seals and
[45:35] especially this and I encourage you to
[45:37] do that we're going through this if you
[45:39] have the time I would encourage you to
[45:41] listen to the seals that uh we know that
[45:44] the Thunder shouldn't be a mystery to us
[45:46] because the Thunder is just God speaking
[45:49] in a form that people can't understand
[45:51] but once he it is understood it's no
[45:54] longer a thunder it's a voice
[45:57] right it's God speaking in a way that we
[45:59] could not understand but by the message
[46:01] of the hour we understand it so brother
[46:03] Bram told us that the seven thunders of
[46:05] Revelation 10 he said are the Mysteries
[46:08] contained in the seals Revelation 62 uh
[46:11] he said I I Behold a white horse and he
[46:13] that set on him had a bow a crown was
[46:15] given unto him he went forth conquering
[46:17] and to conquer now brother brandom tells
[46:19] us what that white horse means he said
[46:21] what does the white horse mean he said
[46:23] here's where the Revelation come because
[46:25] this this is where all the different
[46:27] theories were on what that was it it
[46:30] represented something and so everybody
[46:33] had a different idea now people
[46:35] understood down Through the Ages that
[46:37] white means
[46:38] righteous so so they thought that this
[46:41] would be the church or that it would be
[46:44] God and in fact one and I've actually
[46:47] read the commentary and evidently
[46:48] brother brandham did too because he
[46:49] references it he said there was a
[46:51] commentary uh that said that it was like
[46:54] cupid shooting his bow of love and so
[46:57] that was the bow that the one had and
[47:00] but you know all no one knew right so
[47:03] but Gabe you had to you had to guess at
[47:05] what it was right but now we we've been
[47:10] and listen to me you've got to believe
[47:11] in a in a in a Vindicated prophet in our
[47:14] day or you could still be guessing about
[47:16] that but if you do believe in a
[47:18] Vindicated prophet and trusting that you
[47:20] do tonight we believe this has been
[47:22] revealed in our day and we believe it
[47:24] fits with the rest of the scripture sir
[47:26] so white means righteous so brother
[47:29] brandham says the teachers taught it
[47:31] that it was the Holy Spirit conquering
[47:33] in the first age but my Revelation by
[47:35] the holy spirit is not that way and so
[47:37] brother brandom taught us and and I'm
[47:39] doing this for a reason going through
[47:41] quickly because there's a lot to get to
[47:43] and I'm going to do it in one night and
[47:45] I'm not going to keep you long so we'll
[47:47] just we'll just that praise God I I kept
[47:50] my word Sunday night and I'm going to
[47:51] try to keep my word
[47:52] tonight so the someone said Hallelujah
[47:57] so brother bandam said here's the lamb
[48:01] and there's the white horse rider now
[48:02] think how simple this
[48:04] is right look at a prophet standing
[48:06] there he said here's the lamb opening
[48:08] the seals and there's the white horse
[48:11] rider now there's only one God right one
[48:15] God three manifestations or three
[48:17] attributes of that God and so this the
[48:19] godhead is key to understanding the
[48:22] first seal because you understand that
[48:24] he couldn't be the right rer that was
[48:26] riding if he was standing there opening
[48:28] the
[48:29] seal that's what brother brandham said
[48:31] now so and I would say this that
[48:34] understanding the godhead is crucial to
[48:36] understanding the message in its
[48:37] entirety you need to know that's that's
[48:40] the the very first commandment here o
[48:42] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[48:45] right so that's the very first thing we
[48:47] have to understand so he said here's the
[48:50] lamb there's the white horse rider so
[48:52] it's one God and so we know that how
[48:55] could Christ to be out there the White
[48:57] Horse conquering and standing here with
[48:59] a book in his hand he said it isn't
[49:01] though it isn't Christ because we find
[49:04] Christ not seen until the 19th Chapter
[49:07] but it must be something mimicking
[49:09] Christ because it is writing a white
[49:12] horse or it appears to be a righteous
[49:15] thing so it's not like the other horses
[49:17] that come after it the red horse the
[49:19] black horse but this appears to be
[49:21] righteous and so we find that Christ
[49:23] does ride a white horse he does ride one
[49:26] but not till Revelation 19 let's go
[49:29] there Revelation 1911 I saw heaven open
[49:32] Behold a white horse and he that set
[49:34] upon him was called faithful aren't you
[49:36] glad he's faithful tonight and true and
[49:39] in righteousness he does judge and make
[49:42] war his eyes were as a flame of fire on
[49:45] his head were many crowns he had a name
[49:48] written no man knew but he himself and
[49:51] there's something very important there
[49:52] and I don't have time to get to it
[49:53] tonight but there's a great significance
[49:55] in a name name change brother BR said he
[49:57] was Redeemer while he was on the Earth
[49:59] but when he become the mighty conqueror
[50:01] he had a name
[50:03] change right he's still Jesus the Lord
[50:05] Jesus Christ but he he changes his what
[50:08] he's doing he becomes the mighty oh my
[50:11] listen church we have a change in this
[50:14] hour there's been a change come there's
[50:16] been an identification given to us in
[50:19] the opening of the word if we could just
[50:21] grab a hold of that tonight it means
[50:23] that we can overcome we don't have to we
[50:25] don't have to be confused we don't have
[50:27] to be muddled we don't have to be like
[50:29] all other ages have been but this is the
[50:31] age of the
[50:33] Overcomer this is the age when our name
[50:35] has been changed we're not a victim
[50:37] anymore we're a Victor
[50:39] now so I'll just leave that there but
[50:42] Revelation 19:13 he was clothed with a
[50:44] vesture dipped in blood his name is
[50:46] called the word of God that's where our
[50:48] Victory is faith in the word as we
[50:51] preached Sunday faith is the victory
[50:54] that overcomes the world but it's faith
[50:56] in something faith in the word that's
[50:58] what his name is called the word of God
[51:00] verse 14 and the armies which were in
[51:02] heaven followed him upon white horses
[51:04] clothed in fine linen white and clean oh
[51:08] I love this it's not just him on a white
[51:10] horse but it's the armies in heaven who
[51:12] is that that's us right we went up in
[51:15] the Rapture can you identify yourself
[51:18] there tonight it's easy to identify
[51:20] yourself as sick or or or hurt or or or
[51:23] depressed or something like that but can
[51:25] you identify yourself on a white horse
[51:28] riding back you said brother been
[51:30] explain that white horse I don't know I
[51:32] don't know I may be a literal literal
[51:34] White Horse it may be a it may be a
[51:36] spiritual White Horse I don't know what
[51:38] it is but I know I'll be on one I can
[51:41] identify myself with that
[51:43] statement are you with me now the armies
[51:47] which were in heaven you got to be able
[51:48] to see yourself in the word and that
[51:51] requires looking up above these
[51:52] circumstances of life and saying I'm on
[51:54] one of those those white horses yes so
[51:58] and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword
[52:01] that with it he should Smite the Nations
[52:03] notice the differences between him and
[52:05] the writer of Revelation five sir
[52:08] Revelation six he shall rule them with a
[52:10] rod of iron he treadeth The Wine Press
[52:12] of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty
[52:15] God and he hath on his vesture and on
[52:17] his thy a name written king of kings and
[52:20] Lord of lords oh my he's coming back
[52:23] he's not coming this time to be cruci
[52:25] IFI again but he's coming this time to
[52:27] be Lord over the Earth Amen to be to
[52:31] reign as son of
[52:33] David so he said there comes the Messiah
[52:36] there he is not this fellow on this
[52:38] horse back here he said and notice
[52:40] Christ has not seen anymore from this
[52:42] time there but he's on a white horse so
[52:44] if this guy's riding a white horse he's
[52:46] an impersonator of
[52:48] Christ right so he's an
[52:50] impersonator I think even our our little
[52:52] ones our children should be able to
[52:54] understand that he said notice the rider
[52:56] on the White Horse doesn't have any name
[52:58] he might use two or three titles see but
[53:00] he doesn't got any
[53:01] name right but Christ has a name what
[53:04] was it the word of God that's what it is
[53:06] in the beginning was the word the word
[53:08] was with God and the Word was God and
[53:10] the word made flesh he said now he's got
[53:12] a name that no man knows but he's called
[53:14] the word of God this guy isn't called
[53:15] nothing but he's on a White Horse He
[53:18] said the rider has no arrows for his bow
[53:21] now watch how brother brandom under that
[53:24] prophetic revelation it was revealed to
[53:26] him that day and he goes and preaches it
[53:28] that night he said the rider has no
[53:30] arrows for his bow did you notice he had
[53:33] a bow but there's nothing said about
[53:35] having any arrows so he must be a
[53:38] bluffer he says he he's a bluff oh that
[53:41] ought to give us conviction and courage
[53:43] tonight he's a
[53:45] bluff as the old saying is how do you
[53:48] know he's lying when he whenever he says
[53:49] he's lying CU he's a liar when he opens
[53:52] his mouth he's lying I always get those
[53:56] those things turned around but when he
[53:58] when he opens his mouth just like a
[54:00] lawyer whenever he opens his mouth he
[54:02] lies right but but just remember that
[54:06] he's a bluff that's all he is he said
[54:09] maybe he's got a lot of thunder and no
[54:12] lightning like the Indian chief said
[54:14] about the about the preacher got done
[54:17] preaching they said how'd he do chief he
[54:19] said well I had lots of Thunder but no
[54:21] lightning said but you find out Christ
[54:24] had both lightning and Thunder for out
[54:26] of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged
[54:28] sword and he smites the nations with it
[54:31] he said this guy can't Smite
[54:34] nothing now think about it we give him
[54:36] too much credit sometimes oh he's a good
[54:38] devil but he's just a love he's been DET
[54:41] toothed if I could say it that way he
[54:43] the devil looks like a meth addict he's
[54:45] out there he got no teeth man he he just
[54:48] can't he can't do nothing he can't can't
[54:50] bite down on you he can't why because he
[54:52] he got kicked in the teeth by the that's
[54:54] terrible illustration he got forgive me
[54:58] for that strike that from the record he
[55:00] got kicked in the teeth by by Jesus at
[55:02] Calvary do you believe that huh he had
[55:05] the keys to his own house taken away
[55:07] from him there's a better
[55:08] one am man kick Satan back in the back
[55:12] in the pits of hell where he came
[55:14] from right so so here this guy's a bluff
[55:18] he can't Smite anything who is this
[55:21] mysterious writer that starts forth in
[55:24] the first church and rides Plum out on
[55:26] out into eternity and goes to the end
[55:29] the second seal he said comes forth and
[55:31] goes right out into the end now this is
[55:32] important especially for us older ones
[55:34] so we'll understand now the seals are
[55:36] not like the church ages Church ages so
[55:40] much time it's in age when it's over it
[55:42] bleeds into the other age but but
[55:44] there's there's a time you can put a
[55:46] date on it more or less right you can't
[55:49] do that with the seals because even each
[55:52] one of these four horse riders Blends on
[55:54] out
[55:55] goes all the way out so you'll find that
[55:58] his he is identified he's still riding
[56:00] his White Horse he's still riding his
[56:02] red horse he's still riding his black
[56:05] horse he's still riding his Pale Horse
[56:08] and you can see that in the world today
[56:10] so the second seal comes forth goes
[56:12] right out into the end the third seal
[56:14] comes forth and goes right out into the
[56:15] end so when you have somebody ask you
[56:18] and say something like this well what
[56:19] which seal are we in well they don't
[56:21] understand the
[56:22] seals right because that's not how the
[56:24] seals work right but but there is a
[56:27] there is a truth that there's certain
[56:29] ones that relate to the time that we
[56:31] live in I'll just go ahead and say it
[56:33] here because this where I want to go
[56:34] when we get to the end of all of this is
[56:36] the seventh seal is the seal brother BR
[56:38] said that was the mystery of going
[56:40] that's the one I really relate to right
[56:43] because because we're going home that's
[56:46] the Rapture now now he he talks about
[56:49] that and he said at the end time these
[56:51] books that's been rolled up all this
[56:53] time because it would be a scroll not a
[56:55] book like this it's a scroll and it's
[56:57] sealed with a
[56:59] seal and then when the seal is broke you
[57:02] can read what's in the scroll he said
[57:03] what's been rolled up all this time with
[57:06] these mysteries in them it's broken he
[57:08] said then out comes the Mysteries to see
[57:10] what it is he said but actually they
[57:12] started forth at the first church age so
[57:14] even the if you could say it this way
[57:16] the seals began to be revealed at the
[57:19] first church age so this is not
[57:20] happening in in 60 minutes right the
[57:25] you're watching a a drama over time the
[57:29] lamb taking the book The Bloody lamb
[57:31] standing there you're not you're
[57:32] watching a representation of something
[57:35] so it's not happening just in somebody
[57:37] say Well it happened on a certain day
[57:38] well he said here that uh it started
[57:41] forth at the first church age because
[57:42] the church the first church age received
[57:44] the message like this he said a white
[57:46] horse rider went out so who is he they
[57:49] saw it in symbol form he is mighty in
[57:51] his conquering power he's a great fellow
[57:53] in his conquering power
[57:55] you want me to tell you who he is he is
[57:57] the
[57:59] Antichrist you say well I thought the
[58:01] Antichrist was coming and he was going
[58:02] to be uh like that guy on Left Behind
[58:05] you know some kind of Superman well he
[58:07] is a superman but the Antichrist has
[58:09] been here since since Jesus
[58:12] left right Judas was with Jesus brother
[58:15] they come about the same time leave
[58:16] about the same time when the Holy Ghost
[58:18] came down the Antichrist Spirit came
[58:21] down right so that that's what we're
[58:23] dealing with right now world what we've
[58:25] been dealing with yes sir for a long
[58:27] time I'll show you that in just a moment
[58:29] but one day the Antichrist will come
[58:30] incarnate in a
[58:31] person right but but right now it's the
[58:34] spirit now he said he's the Antichrist
[58:37] exactly what it is now because you see
[58:39] if in Antichrist Jesus said the two
[58:40] would be so close together it would
[58:42] deceive the very elected the bride if it
[58:45] was possible I'm glad that if is there
[58:47] he said it's the Antichrist Spirit which
[58:49] he also identified as a nickan spirit
[58:53] right that Antichrist Spirit Pres
[58:54] presented itself as a nician spirit in
[58:57] the church nician was to conquer the Ley
[59:00] in other words to make it where it was
[59:02] just the preacher just the priest just
[59:05] just the pope and the people had nothing
[59:07] to do with it they didn't have to live
[59:09] it they didn't have to worship they
[59:10] weren't a part of anything listen that
[59:12] Spirit still exists today yes sir right
[59:15] and so it put everything in the
[59:16] denomination or put everything in one
[59:18] man instead of it being a body move but
[59:21] we are the body of Jesus Christ so it
[59:24] was a Nichol in the spirit and then
[59:26] later on that Spirit was crowned he was
[59:28] given a crown he said later he was given
[59:30] a crown he said three of them three on
[59:32] one and that was the crown that the pope
[59:35] had he said that was 300 years later at
[59:36] the NAA Council he said when he started
[59:39] out a spirit of nickan to form an
[59:41] organization among the people and then
[59:43] it kept on going on going on became a
[59:46] saying it become a Doctrine but look but
[59:49] look at this nicolan spirit in in
[59:51] Revelation 2:6 here he he speaks in
[59:55] Revelation 2:6 and he he says but this
[59:57] thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of
[1:00:00] the nicians so in other words a deed is
[1:00:03] is a work or a Duty or a task it refers
[1:00:06] to a task that is accomplished by
[1:00:08] someone so he says you hate the Deeds of
[1:00:12] the nicians you hate the works that's
[1:00:13] all it was they didn't even say it yet
[1:00:16] they just did it right now you look at
[1:00:19] any type of of false doctrine that comes
[1:00:21] in the church it comes in this way first
[1:00:23] it becomes Deeds it just becomes uh you
[1:00:26] know before people say they don't
[1:00:28] believe in church anymore they start
[1:00:29] hanging out of
[1:00:31] church and then it becomes a Doctrine
[1:00:33] they don't even believe in it anymore
[1:00:35] pretty soon we don't need preachers we
[1:00:36] don't need anything else and I'll be
[1:00:38] honest with you I'll be glad when we
[1:00:39] don't need
[1:00:40] preachers but that day is not yet CU as
[1:00:44] long as we got sick people we still need
[1:00:45] somebody to pray for them as long as we
[1:00:47] and we can pray for one another but as
[1:00:49] long as we still got as long as we still
[1:00:51] got people that need instruction in the
[1:00:52] house of God there's still a preacher to
[1:00:54] to give that instruction until we all
[1:00:57] come in the unity of the faith and I
[1:00:58] believe that's the moment that we're
[1:00:59] getting ready to go home amen that's the
[1:01:01] time that'll happen now so the the Deeds
[1:01:05] of the nickan is just the way that it
[1:01:06] acts but the doctrine of the nicians is
[1:01:11] uh the doctrine of the nicians is
[1:01:13] actually when it comes becomes a
[1:01:15] Doctrine and they begin to tell what it
[1:01:17] is so in one Church age it's deeds in
[1:01:19] another church age it's a Doctrine he
[1:01:22] said which thing I hate Doctrine is the
[1:01:23] actor content of teaching it's
[1:01:26] instruction so brother bam says this he
[1:01:28] said he was trying to conquer take the
[1:01:30] Holy Spirit to just only one holy man he
[1:01:33] could forgive all the sins and
[1:01:35] everything do you see why the devil
[1:01:36] would try to take the message right back
[1:01:38] to
[1:01:40] that right and he'll he'll try to take
[1:01:42] you back to that as an individual where
[1:01:45] you have so much confidence in one man
[1:01:48] and it becomes a nickan spirit because
[1:01:51] you you think well if I could get to
[1:01:53] that man he he could could tell me what
[1:01:54] was wrong if I could get that man he
[1:01:56] could forgive all my sins but even a
[1:01:58] gift like brother brandom's God didn't
[1:02:00] leave him on the earth he took him home
[1:02:02] and his work was finished I just read
[1:02:05] where he said that today in this first
[1:02:06] seal he said when my work when I'm done
[1:02:09] he said that means my when I when I pass
[1:02:11] away that means my work is
[1:02:12] finished amen so now he said he's today
[1:02:17] he said where is he today he said today
[1:02:19] he's under the disguising of a white
[1:02:22] horse he said watch how he changes from
[1:02:25] that white horse in a few minutes he
[1:02:27] don't only become a white horse he
[1:02:29] becomes a beast with many heads and
[1:02:30] horns he had no Crown to start with but
[1:02:33] he got a crown later when that Spirit
[1:02:35] became incarnate he become a man Nic and
[1:02:38] Doctrine become a man then they could
[1:02:39] crown him he said they couldn't do it
[1:02:41] because he was just a Doctrine he said
[1:02:43] and when I love this and when this Holy
[1:02:46] Spirit now listen that we have how many
[1:02:49] have the Holy Spirit tonight one day
[1:02:52] that holy spirit that you have will be
[1:02:55] crowned right it'll be a
[1:02:58] person the one that's in our midst now
[1:03:01] in the form of the Holy Ghost becomes
[1:03:03] incarnate to us in the person of Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ we'll crown him King of Kings
[1:03:08] brother Joe you can't tell me I'm not
[1:03:10] going to see him I believe with all of
[1:03:13] my heart I'm going to see him I'm going
[1:03:14] to see him in the flesh why because the
[1:03:16] Holy Spirit that's in me becomes a
[1:03:20] person amen and so brother random taught
[1:03:23] us he said there is a and there is a
[1:03:24] literal Jesus Christ that'll come in a
[1:03:26] body form and catch his but Bri away he
[1:03:29] said that's what Believers
[1:03:31] believe so in in the early church this
[1:03:35] Antichrist Spirit began to creep in are
[1:03:37] you still with me tonight sir so John in
[1:03:41] 1 John 218 said little children it is
[1:03:43] the last time and as you have heard that
[1:03:45] Antichrist shall come even now there are
[1:03:47] many
[1:03:48] Antichrist right many and everybody's
[1:03:51] worried about the Antichrist coming but
[1:03:53] they don't understand there there's many
[1:03:55] antichrists he said whereby we know that
[1:03:57] it is the last time so he come in he
[1:04:01] doesn't come in as an antichrist as like
[1:04:03] a warrior come in uh trying to take over
[1:04:06] but he comes in peaceably and then he is
[1:04:09] crowned and he tries to do the same
[1:04:11] thing in our
[1:04:13] life right he presents himself as a
[1:04:15] white horse now here's a way you can
[1:04:18] apply this to your life he presents
[1:04:21] himself as a white horse every every
[1:04:23] idea Satan gives you to try to take you
[1:04:26] away from God looks like a good
[1:04:29] thing it always looks good that's what
[1:04:32] his job is to make it look good he even
[1:04:34] presents himself as an angel of Light
[1:04:37] but we have to judge it by the word
[1:04:39] that's right so he comes in peaceably
[1:04:42] and then he's crowned so and then he
[1:04:45] tries to do the same thing he'll come in
[1:04:46] peaceably try to make you think you
[1:04:47] don't oh you don't need that there's no
[1:04:49] reason to do that but then later on he
[1:04:51] crowns himself and then you say how did
[1:04:53] I end up with all this depression and
[1:04:55] fear and anxiet all these things well he
[1:04:57] come in
[1:04:58] peaceably and then he was crowned amen
[1:05:01] Daniel 11:21 in his estate now he's
[1:05:04] talking about this Antichrist that would
[1:05:05] come in his estate shall stand up a vile
[1:05:07] person to whom they shall not give the
[1:05:09] honor of the Kingdom but he shall come
[1:05:11] in what peaceably obtain the kingdom by
[1:05:16] flatteries trying to make you feel good
[1:05:18] about
[1:05:19] yourself right and that's the religion
[1:05:21] we the world has today that's what
[1:05:23] Daniel said this Antichrist would do he
[1:05:25] will fit the people's Place it'll fit
[1:05:28] their menu for this day I'm glad I'm an
[1:05:31] eagle I'm glad I'm an eagle I'm glad I
[1:05:34] don't want a Leo to see and menu every
[1:05:36] time I go to the go to church I'm not
[1:05:38] sitting down waiting aan menu is is is
[1:05:42] make me happy uh make me happy make me
[1:05:45] satisfied tell me I'm okay but that's
[1:05:47] not what the bride of Christ wants we
[1:05:49] want the word the bride feeds on the
[1:05:52] word of God Amen so now he this
[1:05:56] Antichrist system fits a lean menu but
[1:05:59] God has promised that when the word is
[1:06:03] refused that then people will be given
[1:06:06] over to their desires and then
[1:06:08] Antichrist to become incarnate and be
[1:06:10] Crown so now look he said he'll fit in
[1:06:13] the people's place they in this church
[1:06:15] age they don't want the word Christ but
[1:06:18] they want
[1:06:21] Church 1 Thessalonians 2:9 he said even
[1:06:24] him Who coming is after the working of
[1:06:25] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[1:06:28] wonders with all deceivableness of
[1:06:31] unrighteousness and them that perish
[1:06:34] because oh church if I could get you to
[1:06:38] understand how important it is for you
[1:06:40] to love the
[1:06:41] message I don't mean to love brother
[1:06:43] brandom I don't mean that at all
[1:06:45] although I believe you should love
[1:06:46] brother brandham but I don't that's not
[1:06:48] what I mean I don't mean to love uh to
[1:06:51] love where brother Bram lived and and
[1:06:52] love what he did and and the story of
[1:06:54] his life I mean for you to love the
[1:06:56] message because the message is Christ
[1:06:58] love the
[1:07:00] word sir love the word they receive not
[1:07:04] the love of the truth and so they flow
[1:07:06] into an antichrist system but we receive
[1:07:08] the love of the truth and we will not be
[1:07:10] deceived by the Antichrist
[1:07:12] system are you with me now yes for this
[1:07:16] cause God shall send them strong
[1:07:18] delusion that they should believe a
[1:07:22] lie brother says that God said if they
[1:07:25] want it I'll just let them have it and
[1:07:28] I'll actually make them believe that
[1:07:30] that's the truth cuz I'll give them a
[1:07:32] reprobate mind concerning the truth like
[1:07:35] Janice and jambus who whed Moses so do
[1:07:38] these also resist the truth men of
[1:07:40] corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the
[1:07:42] faith if he said they want it they want
[1:07:44] it so they'll get leaders that'll lead
[1:07:46] them that direction he said now you see
[1:07:49] where it's at not only Catholic but
[1:07:50] Protestant it's the whole thing he said
[1:07:53] it's all the whole organized world we
[1:07:57] get hung up on Catholic but that is a
[1:08:00] that is such a strong but it's such an
[1:08:01] obvious Spirit but it's the whole
[1:08:04] organized world the whole Cosmos it's
[1:08:07] all one now right it's all come together
[1:08:10] so it's it's a one world religion if we
[1:08:13] can say it that way and it'll become
[1:08:15] even more and more that as we go along
[1:08:18] uh as as as we get closer and closer to
[1:08:21] the end which I believe we're right
[1:08:22] there he said that's that white horse
[1:08:24] rider he said under the way of white
[1:08:27] Righteousness Church but an antichrist
[1:08:30] he started riding in the first church
[1:08:32] age now he rides on down on down through
[1:08:34] every age look how he got started swell
[1:08:37] celebrity people fine dress Highly
[1:08:39] Educated polish didn't want all that
[1:08:41] carrying on in the
[1:08:42] church no they don't want all that holy
[1:08:45] ghost stuff and he said he gave them
[1:08:47] their
[1:08:49] desire God will never force you to
[1:08:51] worship him that's something brother bam
[1:08:53] teach teaches us in this first seal God
[1:08:55] will not force you to worship him if you
[1:08:58] don't want to tally up to God's way of
[1:08:59] living in things and worship you don't
[1:09:02] have to do it we are never going to meet
[1:09:04] you at the door and make sure you
[1:09:05] worship God Don't force you to worship
[1:09:08] him but but listen to what he says he
[1:09:11] says let me tell you something if your
[1:09:13] name was placed on the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:15] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:09:17] he said you'll be so happy to do it you
[1:09:19] can't wait for the minute to do
[1:09:22] it God Don't Make nobody do
[1:09:25] it so this Antichrist and I'm hurrying
[1:09:29] along here but I hope you catch it as
[1:09:31] I'm hurrying he's the prince that was to
[1:09:33] destroy Daniel's
[1:09:35] people Daniel 9:26 after three score in
[1:09:38] two weeks shami be cut off not for
[1:09:41] himself and the people of the prince
[1:09:43] that shall come shall destroy the city
[1:09:45] and the sanctuary and the end thereof
[1:09:48] shall be with a flood and unto the end
[1:09:50] of the war desolations are determined
[1:09:52] the people of the prince that shall come
[1:09:54] the brandom said was the Romans Rome
[1:09:56] destroyed Jerusalem right that happened
[1:09:59] in 70 AD with Titus so that's the people
[1:10:02] of the prin that shall come verse 27 he
[1:10:04] shall confirm the Covenant with many for
[1:10:07] one week in the midst of the week so
[1:10:09] this is what he's going to do the same
[1:10:12] Roman Spirit right the same thing this
[1:10:15] is Antichrist now at the end time he's
[1:10:17] going to confirm the Covenant with many
[1:10:18] for one week and in the midst of the
[1:10:20] week he shall cause the sacrifice and
[1:10:22] the oblation to cease and for the
[1:10:25] overspreading of Abominations he shall
[1:10:27] make it desolate even until the
[1:10:29] consummation and that determin shall be
[1:10:32] poured upon the desolate you might say
[1:10:34] brother Ben aren't you worried about the
[1:10:36] about the division and thing in things
[1:10:38] in politics today uh well that is a
[1:10:41] concern but it's more a concern when
[1:10:44] they come
[1:10:45] together the things they agree on is
[1:10:48] what I'm really worried
[1:10:50] about when you begin to see the
[1:10:52] political parties becoming one
[1:10:54] when you begin to see the churches
[1:10:55] becoming one but also behind the scenes
[1:10:58] there's a bride uniting with the word
[1:11:01] we're becoming one with Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ so now he said we got our picture
[1:11:07] and know that he is Rome he says and we
[1:11:10] know that he's a white horse rider we
[1:11:12] know he went forth as a Doctrine he said
[1:11:14] then what was Pagan Rome converted into
[1:11:16] Papa Rome and Crown he said now watch in
[1:11:18] the end time not in the early days when
[1:11:20] Christ was preaching but in the end time
[1:11:21] in the last part of the week we just
[1:11:23] took the 70 weeks of Daniel and Christ
[1:11:25] just prophesied for the three and 1/2
[1:11:27] years three and one2 years are yet
[1:11:29] determined and this prince in that time
[1:11:31] is to make a covenant with Daniel's
[1:11:32] people which is the Jews he said that's
[1:11:35] when the bride is taken out now she
[1:11:37] won't see it so if you're looking for
[1:11:40] that I'm sorry to tell you you're going
[1:11:42] to miss that
[1:11:43] event right there's not going to be an
[1:11:46] event that you can see to get you ready
[1:11:48] for the
[1:11:50] Rapture I hate to disabuse you of that
[1:11:52] notion but it's the truth
[1:11:54] in a moment in a twinkling of an eye in
[1:11:56] an hour that you think not when everyone
[1:11:59] says peace and safety when everything
[1:12:01] seems to be going good when life seems
[1:12:03] to be going like normal that's the hour
[1:12:05] it takes place in right and that's why
[1:12:08] we plant our potatoes brother Allen was
[1:12:10] talking about finances why would you do
[1:12:12] a finances class when the world looks
[1:12:13] like it does because we don't know what
[1:12:16] hour it might be everything might go
[1:12:19] good now that's just the
[1:12:21] scripture there's not necessarily going
[1:12:23] to be a difficult time there may be and
[1:12:26] there may not be you say well brother
[1:12:27] Ben there'll come a day we have to
[1:12:29] struggle for our food that might be the
[1:12:31] case that is the case in most nations in
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:34] world we just forget how privileged we
[1:12:37] are but that's not the
[1:12:40] tribulation right it's going to be much
[1:12:42] worse than that much much worse you
[1:12:44] don't want to be here for that time he
[1:12:46] said she won't see it so he makes a
[1:12:48] money Covenant I don't have time to get
[1:12:50] into this tonight maybe we will be able
[1:12:52] to later but he talks about the gold and
[1:12:54] the currency from Rome and from Wall
[1:12:56] Street and how he would make a money
[1:12:59] Covenant and and once he got a hold of
[1:13:01] the money he would break the Covenant so
[1:13:03] in Daniel 8:23 it says in the latter
[1:13:05] time of their Kingdom when the
[1:13:07] transgressors are come to the
[1:13:10] fold look
[1:13:12] around that's where you're living a king
[1:13:15] of fierce
[1:13:17] countenance understanding dark sentences
[1:13:20] he'll seem like a
[1:13:21] genius shall stand stand up and his
[1:13:25] power shall be Mighty but not by his own
[1:13:28] power he shall destroy
[1:13:31] wonderfully and shall prosper and
[1:13:34] practice and shall destroy the mighty
[1:13:36] and the holy people and through his
[1:13:39] policy also he shall cause craft brother
[1:13:42] brand said that's manufacturing he'll be
[1:13:45] good for the
[1:13:47] economy right man manufacturing will
[1:13:50] prosper in his hand he shall magnify
[1:13:52] himself in his his heart listen and by
[1:13:56] peace so he's not a Vladimir
[1:13:59] Putin right who kills his
[1:14:01] enemies right not some guy with some
[1:14:04] kind of weird Star Wars powers that he
[1:14:06] can grab a hold of his enemies by the
[1:14:08] neck and and throttle them something
[1:14:10] like that yall know what I'm talking
[1:14:12] about huh except for Joel he don't know
[1:14:15] but the rest of you know huh but he's
[1:14:19] not some guy that that can just just
[1:14:21] telepathically destroy that be how he
[1:14:24] comes in right he does kill people later
[1:14:27] on but in the first half of that three
[1:14:30] and a half years he comes in peaceably
[1:14:33] he's doing it right
[1:14:35] now right right now that Spirit I'm not
[1:14:39] saying the man as he may be but that
[1:14:41] spirit is
[1:14:42] here he's doing it right now by peace
[1:14:46] shall destroy many he shall also stand
[1:14:49] up against the prince of princes I love
[1:14:51] this but he shall be broken without hand
[1:14:54] that means without the hands of a man
[1:14:56] remember the vision that Daniel had of
[1:14:58] the Gentile World kingdoms that
[1:15:00] Nebuchadnezzar had rather the dream
[1:15:02] Nebuchadnezzar had and Daniel sees it by
[1:15:03] vision and he tells him the H the
[1:15:05] meaning of his dream and he said there
[1:15:07] was a stone cut out of the mountain
[1:15:09] without hands and it come and he said it
[1:15:11] turned it into powder it destroyed it
[1:15:14] what is it that same thing destroys that
[1:15:16] Antichrist system he will stand up
[1:15:18] against the prince of princes but he
[1:15:19] shall be broken without the hands of a
[1:15:21] man yes sir now he's going to hold the
[1:15:24] money the brand said that's where I
[1:15:26] think it'll come in he said when he gets
[1:15:29] all the money all under control he'll
[1:15:30] break this Covenant with the
[1:15:33] Jews and in the midst of the last half
[1:15:35] of the 70 weeks of Daniel you'll have
[1:15:36] all the world trade and the Commerce are
[1:15:38] packed with the world he hold the wealth
[1:15:39] of the world completely and that's when
[1:15:41] the two prophets come they begin to
[1:15:43] prophesy and they dance in the streets
[1:15:45] CU they die and everybody sees them
[1:15:46] which is only possible in this age
[1:15:50] because of social media where everybody
[1:15:52] rejoices at two people dying wasn't even
[1:15:55] possible a few years
[1:15:57] ago right but everybody's going to watch
[1:15:59] it and everybody's going to everybody's
[1:16:00] going to Rejoice over it but we'll be
[1:16:04] gone church it's not
[1:16:06] fiction this is truth I can't tell you
[1:16:09] exactly how it's going to happen but
[1:16:10] this is coming we can see it
[1:16:13] coming now and the Great Dragon was cast
[1:16:16] out now brother Brown said thank God the
[1:16:18] church will be enjoying a great three
[1:16:20] and a half years in glory and we won't
[1:16:22] have to go through that amen he said the
[1:16:24] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[1:16:26] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[1:16:28] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:16:29] out on the earth his angels were cast
[1:16:30] out with you brother BR said the church
[1:16:32] is taken up and Satan is cast out when
[1:16:35] the church goes up Satan comes down then
[1:16:39] Satan incarnates himself in the
[1:16:40] Antichrist he's called the beast then in
[1:16:42] Revelation 13 He sets the mark down you
[1:16:45] don't have to worry about taking the
[1:16:46] mark of the beast the mark of the beast
[1:16:49] is already here right to do the will
[1:16:52] right of that Antichrist system and to
[1:16:55] and to have the market in the head and
[1:16:57] in the hand it's already here but yet
[1:16:59] it'll come in a literal form one day
[1:17:01] where people won't be able to buy or
[1:17:02] sell but again how do I escape that what
[1:17:05] what what plan should I use to get over
[1:17:07] that where should I hide where should I
[1:17:09] live so that I can I can make a living
[1:17:12] in in spite of the mark of the beast
[1:17:13] I'll tell you where you need to live
[1:17:15] I'll tell you what you need to eat you
[1:17:16] need to live in heaven and eat at the
[1:17:19] marriage supper of the Lamb that's the
[1:17:21] way to overcome it because no amount of
[1:17:23] preparation is going to overcome this
[1:17:25] beat
[1:17:28] system the truth is if you're here
[1:17:31] somehow you missed
[1:17:34] it I wonder if you won't be deceived by
[1:17:38] it think about it it won't you won't
[1:17:40] think it's what it
[1:17:44] is there will be some we know there will
[1:17:46] be some that'll be in fact there'll be
[1:17:49] quite a few fool what we call foolish
[1:17:51] virgin waited to too late but they'll
[1:17:53] recognize it's
[1:17:55] wrong I question I don't know if that's
[1:17:57] message people or not i' I've always
[1:17:59] battled that in my mind I don't know I I
[1:18:01] don't know I I question sometimes
[1:18:02] whether we know too much I want to
[1:18:05] believe that we're all a bride don't you
[1:18:07] I want to believe that everybody I
[1:18:09] preached to his bride we'll just let it
[1:18:11] go with that go to the wedding
[1:18:13] supper I'd rather eat that than rations
[1:18:19] anyway
[1:18:21] now so the church has taken up Satan is
[1:18:24] cast down the mystery but but that
[1:18:25] mystery of iniquity already works but
[1:18:28] the Bible says only he who now lth will
[1:18:30] let other words the one that's hindering
[1:18:33] the Antichrist from taking over is the
[1:18:35] holy
[1:18:36] spirit oh my until he be taken out of
[1:18:40] the way when the Holy Spirit lifts off
[1:18:41] the Earth that's when we're taken off of
[1:18:43] the earth when he that led it he said
[1:18:45] the only Christianity is left on the
[1:18:47] Earth the only Christianity that's left
[1:18:49] on the earth in its Purity is because
[1:18:51] him that lth by the holy Spirit that's
[1:18:53] the only way we can we can have pure
[1:18:55] Christianity so this Antichrist system
[1:18:57] comes I'm closing in just a moment he
[1:19:00] comes with the Antichrist with the false
[1:19:02] prophet with the Beast he comes in three
[1:19:04] stages first stage he's Antichrist
[1:19:06] second stage he's the false prophet
[1:19:08] third stage he's called the beast and
[1:19:10] this writer is nothing but Satan's
[1:19:12] Superman the Incarnate Devil he's an
[1:19:14] educated
[1:19:16] genius so not any of the politicians we
[1:19:18] have out there today I wouldn't
[1:19:21] think amen
[1:19:24] yeah but if you listen to our current
[1:19:26] pope he's pretty
[1:19:28] educated I don't know I wonder sometimes
[1:19:31] well the Brandon pointed to the Kennedy
[1:19:33] debate you know that he pointed to
[1:19:34] politics he said there's one of his
[1:19:36] sons he pointed to that debate how well
[1:19:39] Kennedy did in that debate and he said
[1:19:41] that he's an educated genius like
[1:19:43] Kennedy right he said we wanted a
[1:19:45] Superman we got one he said the whole
[1:19:47] world is wanting a Superman they're
[1:19:48] going to get it he said just wait till
[1:19:50] the church goes up and Satan is cast out
[1:19:52] he'll incarnate and he will conquer
[1:19:54] every religion of the world every one of
[1:19:57] them cuz they're all they've all g into
[1:20:00] the confederation of churches and the
[1:20:02] world Confederation of churches they
[1:20:03] already got their buildings built
[1:20:04] everything setting right in line there
[1:20:06] ain't one thing
[1:20:08] left every denomination is stuck right
[1:20:11] into it the Federation of churches
[1:20:12] what's backing it Rome and the pope is
[1:20:15] now crying we're all one let's come
[1:20:16] together and walk together what do we
[1:20:18] have now that brother bam didn't have in
[1:20:19] his day inter denominational churches
[1:20:23] there were very few of them in brother
[1:20:25] Brand's time some of you are old enough
[1:20:26] to remember there weren't near as many
[1:20:28] but today they don't call themselves
[1:20:29] Baptists or Methodist what do they call
[1:20:31] themselves what what what Blasphemous
[1:20:33] name I get myself in trouble the people
[1:20:36] give themselves today well they give
[1:20:39] themselves a name but it's like I I saw
[1:20:41] one that was like The Happening
[1:20:43] Church there's one we passed on the way
[1:20:46] to Springfield courageous Church they
[1:20:48] may be fine people but it's but they
[1:20:50] give themselves another name they they
[1:20:52] hide their identity why because they
[1:20:54] want everybody to come in and if you go
[1:20:56] in the music's all the same the
[1:20:57] preaching's all the same everything's
[1:20:59] all the same you can't tell B Baptist
[1:21:02] from Methodist from calvinist from
[1:21:04] Armenian you can't tell the difference
[1:21:07] in most denomination you can go to a
[1:21:09] Methodist Church and listen to praise
[1:21:10] and worship
[1:21:12] music why why why why is that coming in
[1:21:15] our time well they all got to become one
[1:21:18] religion right he said these people even
[1:21:20] some of you Full Gospel people deny have
[1:21:23] to deny your Evangelical teaching to
[1:21:25] take such a step as that he said what
[1:21:27] have you done so blind to that
[1:21:29] denominational thing you've rejected the
[1:21:30] truth and truth was set before them and
[1:21:33] they walked away from it and left it now
[1:21:36] they've been given over to a strong
[1:21:37] delusion to believe a lie and be D with
[1:21:39] that's exactly what it is we talked
[1:21:41] about that with Deus sharan and them he
[1:21:42] said Deus has forsaken me Deus sharan
[1:21:45] Finance William brandham and Joel ost's
[1:21:49] father and and the direct connection
[1:21:51] between that move movement brother brand
[1:21:53] was preaching to those men and there's a
[1:21:55] direct connection between that and the
[1:21:57] modern movement of Kenneth Copeland and
[1:21:58] those who went to Rome I think I put a
[1:22:00] picture of that on there it went to Rome
[1:22:02] and prayed in tongues over the
[1:22:06] pope what was it it's a sign of judgment
[1:22:09] they thought it was a great spiritual
[1:22:10] time and they couldn't understand that
[1:22:12] it was a sign of judgment this happened
[1:22:15] just a a couple years ago Church where
[1:22:17] are we at where we've seen an actual
[1:22:20] fulfillment of Prophecy brother Brown
[1:22:23] said the Antichrist takes it all someone
[1:22:25] say all and the Bible said he deceived
[1:22:27] all a upon the face of the Earth whose
[1:22:30] names were not written under those seals
[1:22:32] from the foundation of the world now
[1:22:34] notice he'll conquer and almost has in
[1:22:36] his grip right now while he is still
[1:22:39] Antichrist before he becomes a beast you
[1:22:41] talk about cruel punishment you just
[1:22:42] wait watch what them that's left here on
[1:22:44] Earth will have to go through with and
[1:22:46] the real Church would go through that if
[1:22:49] it was possible but you see they are
[1:22:51] done under this Blood by the grace of
[1:22:53] Christ oh I love it and cannot go
[1:22:55] through any
[1:22:56] tribulation they have no tribulation
[1:23:00] period the Jews have a Jacob's trouble
[1:23:03] the the the foolish virgin have a
[1:23:05] tribulation period the world has a
[1:23:06] tribulation period but the bride has no
[1:23:09] tribulation period amen the next thing
[1:23:12] for the church is Rapture yes sir he
[1:23:15] said amen and amen praise to God oh how
[1:23:17] I love this while the Antichrist spirit
[1:23:20] is becoming incarnate God is also doing
[1:23:22] something he said just before this takes
[1:23:25] place God promised he would send us a
[1:23:27] true prophet of the true word with a
[1:23:28] message to return to the original word
[1:23:31] of God and the faith of the fathers to
[1:23:33] bring down the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:35] among the people where are we living at
[1:23:36] church that you say well I'm waiting on
[1:23:39] that to happen somewhere where's it
[1:23:40] going to happen it already happened the
[1:23:43] power of the Holy Ghost is here the
[1:23:44] bride Revival is here we just need to
[1:23:46] participate in
[1:23:48] it we just need to sign up for it I say
[1:23:51] sign me up I don't want to be signed up
[1:23:53] for death and destruction I don't want
[1:23:54] to be signed up for tribulation I want
[1:23:56] to be signed up brother Danny for the
[1:23:58] for the power of the Holy Ghost how am I
[1:24:01] going to do that not by being a member
[1:24:02] of some church not by being a part of a
[1:24:04] certain group but I do that by believing
[1:24:06] the message of the
[1:24:08] hour by receiving what God has said in
[1:24:11] my day amen with a message to return of
[1:24:14] the original word to bring down the
[1:24:15] power of the Holy Ghost among the people
[1:24:17] with a power that will raise her above
[1:24:19] these things and take her in at the same
[1:24:21] time oh I love let a power to overcome
[1:24:23] and a power to be changed at the same
[1:24:25] time not that you'll be left here where
[1:24:27] you get in by the skin of your teeth but
[1:24:29] you're you'll actually be raised above
[1:24:31] these things and go home at the same
[1:24:34] time and at the same time I love this
[1:24:39] musicians go ahead and
[1:24:42] come at the same time you didn't believe
[1:24:45] I could get done did you that's the
[1:24:47] first seal now the brother BR says many
[1:24:50] other things in the first seal but this
[1:24:52] is how he explains his revelation of
[1:24:54] what the first seal actually was at the
[1:24:56] same time that this devil falls out of
[1:24:59] Heaven becomes incarnate in a man
[1:25:02] brother the Brandon makes a play on
[1:25:03] words here he says the Holy Spirit goes
[1:25:05] up and comes down incarnate
[1:25:09] men I love that he said oh my what a
[1:25:12] time what a time to be living in he said
[1:25:15] brother Ben I I'm worried about that I
[1:25:16] don't know I'm not sure that I'm where
[1:25:19] I'm supposed to be not sure that I'm
[1:25:21] going to make it what do the Bible tell
[1:25:22] us to do when these things begin to come
[1:25:24] to pass look
[1:25:27] up look up I heard a preacher the other
[1:25:30] day he said don't he said that means
[1:25:31] more than just lift up your head and
[1:25:32] lift up your mind lift up your eyes lift
[1:25:35] up your understanding yes look up lift
[1:25:39] up your heads for your Redemption

[1:25:50] number how about that let's bow our
[1:25:52] heads
[1:26:01] together this is your
[1:26:05] message I'm glad it wasn't incumbent on
[1:26:08] me to bring it it wasn't even brother
[1:26:11] brandom that opened the seals it was the
[1:26:14] lamb who opened the seals and he handed
[1:26:17] it to the seventh angel
[1:26:19] messenger and he showed us what it was
[1:26:23] you say that's not important brother Ben
[1:26:25] how what could be more
[1:26:28] important we know where we're at and the
[1:26:31] knowledge doesn't make us arrogant the
[1:26:33] knowledge simply tells us simply tells
[1:26:36] us I'm gives us Assurance I know that
[1:26:39] I'm a Child of God I know what group
[1:26:42] that I'm going to be a part of somehow I
[1:26:44] know in spite of my failures and my
[1:26:46] circumstances he never said you'd miss
[1:26:48] the tribulation CU you were a good
[1:26:49] person he never said you'd miss the
[1:26:51] tribulation because you were born in a
[1:26:53] message family but he said you'd miss it
[1:26:56] because you were a Believer you received
[1:26:59] the word of the hour and you were born
[1:27:01] again one day you realize you were not
[1:27:03] the son I was not the son of John and
[1:27:06] Sharon puit but I was a Son of God if
[1:27:10] you've never had that realization now is
[1:27:11] the time to give your heart to him and
[1:27:13] your life everything that you have and
[1:27:15] everything that you are just give that
[1:27:17] to
[1:27:18] him but rest assured little
