[57:16] blood
[57:17] of someone that died long ago
[57:19] lord the blood of god
[57:21] that had the power in it to forgive sin
[57:25] and then when that blood cell was broken
[57:27] the spirit came back
[57:29] lord on us that we could be filled with
[57:31] the holy ghost
[57:32] or we could have the token in our day
[57:34] and
[57:35] walk with you every step of the way
[57:37] we're so grateful for that lord you give
[57:39] us

[57:43] we're so grateful for that today lord we
[57:45] can't do it without you we pray
[57:47] for healing today we claim healing over

[58:09] a deep knee lord on the inside and i
[58:12] pray god you would meet that need this
[58:13] morning i pray you bless each and every
[58:15] one under the sound of my voice lord may
[58:18] they may they hear more than a man today
[58:20] move me out of the way and speak
[58:22] directly to your people we pray
[58:24] in jesus name
[58:26] amen
[58:28] amen
[58:29] amen do you love the lord this morning
[58:32] let's go to hebrews chapter 11 again
[58:34] hebrews chapter 11. we'll read verses 1
[58:37] and 2 and then verse 31.
[58:40] it's good to have all of our visitors
[58:41] today and
[58:42] we got several of the home folks gone on
[58:44] vacation
[58:46] i trust they're having a good time but
[58:47] maybe some of them are watching and so
[58:49] we miss you today and then
[58:52] there's several
[58:53] out sick as well we'll be praying for
[58:55] them and believing that they'll receive
[58:57] their healing as the word goes forth
[58:59] this morning and of the presence of the
[59:01] lord
[59:02] uh hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1
[59:04] tonight i will have our communion
[59:06] service and brother stewart's going to
[59:08] be speaking uh for us in that service we
[59:10] haven't heard him in a little while so
[59:12] we're looking forward to that
[59:14] but the joel's going to walnut ridge
[59:15] after the service tonight and their
[59:17] service starts at 6. i probably won't
[59:20] make it down there but if some of you
[59:21] want to and can handle three services in
[59:24] a day then you're more than welcome to
[59:26] go hear him down there as well we're
[59:28] proud of all of our young ministers and
[59:30] and i believe the lord is raising up he
[59:32] would not leave us without ministry in
[59:34] this day uh he doesn't god doesn't do
[59:36] that he doesn't leave his work
[59:38] incomplete at the end time but he has
[59:40] somebody who will stand for the message
[59:43] of the hour amen hebrews chapter 11 and
[59:45] verse 1
[59:46] it says now faith is the substance of
[59:48] things
[59:49] hoped for the evidence of things not
[59:52] seen
[59:54] for by it the elders obtained a good
[59:57] report
[59:59] and then i want to go down to verse 31
[1:00:03] by faith the harlot rahab
[1:00:06] perished not
[1:00:08] with them that believed not
[1:00:11] when she had received the spies
[1:00:14] with peace
[1:00:15] amen i pray the lord would add his
[1:00:16] blessing to the word you may be seated
[1:00:19] this morning
[1:00:22] as we've been preaching about faith and
[1:00:24] the sixth sense and how to
[1:00:27] have the faith to uh to overrule these
[1:00:30] five senses of the
[1:00:31] of the flesh and the five senses of the
[1:00:34] spirit
[1:00:35] and we we want to be uh ruled by that
[1:00:38] inner man don't we we want we want the
[1:00:40] word to rule in our lives and yet we all
[1:00:43] live in these bodies and we have to
[1:00:45] learn how to yield ourself to
[1:00:48] that influence that comes from the
[1:00:50] inside now when paul begins to list
[1:00:53] these heroes of faith
[1:00:55] these ones who are able to ignore that's
[1:00:57] what a hero of faith is it's someone
[1:00:59] who's able to ignore the the things that
[1:01:02] are coming from the five senses of the
[1:01:04] body able to ignore the things coming
[1:01:07] from the five senses of the spirit and
[1:01:09] able to just look at the word and say
[1:01:11] lord the word is true it doesn't matter
[1:01:14] how i feel it doesn't matter what i see
[1:01:16] it doesn't even matter what i'm hearing
[1:01:18] if i hear the word i believe it but if
[1:01:20] what i hear is not the word i don't have
[1:01:22] to believe it i don't have to stand for
[1:01:24] it but if what i hear is the word i
[1:01:26] believe the word above all else
[1:01:28] i believe that the word is true and my
[1:01:31] body's not telling me the truth my mind
[1:01:33] won't tell me the truth my even my own
[1:01:36] heart the bible said very deceitful but
[1:01:38] if i hear the word i believe the word
[1:01:40] above everything else can you say amen
[1:01:42] to that today
[1:01:44] i believe the word and so paul lifts
[1:01:47] these heroes of faith who are able to do
[1:01:49] that and he finishes with rahab
[1:01:52] and it's interesting that he does that
[1:01:54] and and also that he doesn't just say
[1:01:57] rahab and he doesn't put her in her
[1:01:59] lineage if we know that she become the
[1:02:02] the mother of boaz but he
[1:02:05] actually and ends up in the lineage the
[1:02:07] natural lineage of christ but he calls
[1:02:09] her the harlot rahab yes
[1:02:11] the harlot rahab and
[1:02:13] and i want to lay this little foundation
[1:02:15] before we move on
[1:02:17] this morning that we want to deal with
[1:02:20] condemnation today because that's one of
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:22] six senses of the inner realm is
[1:02:25] conscience
[1:02:26] conscience
[1:02:28] and so that conscience is what brings
[1:02:30] condemnation
[1:02:32] right you have a conscience there's
[1:02:33] something there that tells you you've
[1:02:35] you're bad you've been bad and you have
[1:02:37] a memory
[1:02:39] right and there's very little you can do
[1:02:41] to forget
[1:02:44] in fact it's not in human capacity to
[1:02:47] forget
[1:02:48] and so paul knew when he was writing to
[1:02:50] the hebrews they would still know her as
[1:02:53] the harlot
[1:02:54] rahab yes they would still know about
[1:02:57] what she did
[1:02:59] they would still know about her story
[1:03:01] and how she had done these things the
[1:03:03] bible doesn't cover anything up
[1:03:05] it doesn't try to put anything in and
[1:03:07] say well they didn't do it anything like
[1:03:09] that but what it does is it actually
[1:03:11] highlights the testimony
[1:03:15] and so but it's not within human
[1:03:17] capacity to forgive and forget
[1:03:21] but it is to forgive because we're
[1:03:23] commanded to forgive
[1:03:25] right we can forgive
[1:03:27] we must forgive
[1:03:29] jesus says when you stand praying
[1:03:31] forgive me if you don't forgive you
[1:03:34] won't be forgiven
[1:03:35] you know how serious that is you cannot
[1:03:38] enter heaven with unforgiveness in your
[1:03:40] heart
[1:03:41] you've got to let go you've got to
[1:03:43] forgive
[1:03:44] no matter what somebody did
[1:03:46] you've got to forgive and yet yet we
[1:03:49] can't forget on our own you can't say
[1:03:51] i'm going to forget that
[1:03:54] you just remind yourself of it no you
[1:03:57] can quit thinking about it
[1:03:59] you can you can every time that thought
[1:04:00] comes you can you can reject it you can
[1:04:02] throw it aside but it's still there and
[1:04:05] someday there'll be a memory will spark
[1:04:07] and that conscience will spark and
[1:04:09] you'll feel guilty all over again you
[1:04:12] might be the best christian in the world
[1:04:15] you might have lived an exemplary life
[1:04:18] from that time that you got saved but
[1:04:20] when that that thing that happened you
[1:04:23] can't get that out of your memory
[1:04:25] so you've got to learn to ignore it
[1:04:29] i hope you're hearing me today
[1:04:31] you got to learn to let go of it
[1:04:33] let the past be the past paul says
[1:04:36] forgetting those things which are in the
[1:04:37] past and it doesn't mean that but but
[1:04:39] it's an active forgetting it's a it's
[1:04:41] choosing to forget
[1:04:44] and it'll come back up because that's
[1:04:46] memory that's conscious you still live
[1:04:48] but i choose to let those things go and
[1:04:51] press toward the mark of the high
[1:04:53] calling in jesus christ i choose to let
[1:04:56] today be today
[1:04:58] and not let to not yet not let yesterday
[1:05:00] mar today's experience
[1:05:04] are you with me now
[1:05:07] so now
[1:05:08] brother branham tells us the word
[1:05:10] justified as though you've never done it
[1:05:12] at all
[1:05:14] when you say i've been justified i've
[1:05:16] been saved how many of you have been
[1:05:18] saved this morning you believe you're
[1:05:19] saved
[1:05:20] that means that you're justified
[1:05:23] right i've been justified
[1:05:26] as though i've never done it all at all
[1:05:28] i've accepted the blood of christ as my
[1:05:31] substitute
[1:05:32] so now he said justify he said and then
[1:05:35] the blood of jesus christ cleanses us so
[1:05:38] from sin
[1:05:40] oh my till it's put in the book of god's
[1:05:43] forgetfulness
[1:05:45] he's the now watch
[1:05:47] he can do it
[1:05:49] he's the only one
[1:05:52] who can do it
[1:05:55] sometimes we
[1:05:56] we have condemnation because we can't
[1:05:59] forget
[1:06:00] and we feel bad about ourselves if i was
[1:06:02] really a christian i could let that go
[1:06:04] but the truth is you live in a body of
[1:06:06] flesh
[1:06:07] but you've got to learn to move on in
[1:06:09] spite of that yes
[1:06:11] there will be memories there'll be times
[1:06:12] and that's why i tell
[1:06:14] our young people you don't want to go
[1:06:16] out and get a testimony by leaving and
[1:06:18] going to the world
[1:06:20] no stay with god
[1:06:22] while you're young if i could just tell
[1:06:24] these young people sitting on the front
[1:06:26] and over here
[1:06:27] stay with god
[1:06:29] what a benefit it is to be able to stay
[1:06:31] with god and have that life that you
[1:06:33] know yes i didn't go into the world but
[1:06:35] i still know i was a sinner that needed
[1:06:37] a savior
[1:06:38] and when i needed a savior there was one
[1:06:40] there for me
[1:06:42] and then i don't have to worry so much
[1:06:44] about that condemnation coming over me
[1:06:46] because i know i've lived for god but
[1:06:48] yet even the best christian can feel
[1:06:50] condemnation
[1:06:53] and we have to learn to
[1:06:55] go to
[1:06:56] go past that
[1:06:58] so now
[1:06:59] brother branham said he's the only one
[1:07:00] that can do it we can't
[1:07:03] we can forgive but not forget
[1:07:07] i could forgive you
[1:07:09] but i'll always remember you done those
[1:07:11] evil things
[1:07:12] he said oh that's terrible brother ben
[1:07:14] you shouldn't be like that it's a human
[1:07:16] being
[1:07:19] men knew
[1:07:21] rahab had been a harlot yes
[1:07:23] they knew her life's story
[1:07:27] but oh my
[1:07:29] when you reach a point
[1:07:31] where you say i i can't forget it people
[1:07:34] can't forget it no one has been able to
[1:07:36] let my past go
[1:07:38] when you reach that point remember you
[1:07:40] have to trust in someone who can
[1:07:42] forget yes
[1:07:45] think about the greatness of god who
[1:07:47] knows everything yes
[1:07:50] he knows every time every flea and how
[1:07:52] many times it batted its high he knows
[1:07:54] every sparrow that ever fell to the
[1:07:56] ground he knows everything levi about
[1:07:58] your life everything that's ever
[1:07:59] happened and yet if you've repented of
[1:08:01] your sin he does not know it
[1:08:06] now that's the scripture he does not
[1:08:07] know it that thing that you're beating
[1:08:09] yourself up about that thing that you
[1:08:11] live under every day he does not know it
[1:08:15] he knows everything but he does not know
[1:08:18] what's under the blood
[1:08:20] or we could we could just end the
[1:08:21] service right there
[1:08:23] he does not know what's under the blood
[1:08:24] he does not know what's in the past
[1:08:27] other people know it the preacher knows
[1:08:28] it the deacons know it the people know
[1:08:30] it but he does not know it so i got to
[1:08:33] put my confidence in him i got to put my
[1:08:35] faith in him i got to give my life to
[1:08:37] him
[1:08:38] he does not know my sin
[1:08:44] i wish i could preach it
[1:08:46] he doesn't know it
[1:08:49] oh i know it
[1:08:51] but he doesn't so i trust him yes
[1:08:56] oh my
[1:08:58] now
[1:08:59] men knew she'd been a harlot
[1:09:02] god knew she was the mother of boaz
[1:09:07] he doesn't know your past
[1:09:10] but he does know your future
[1:09:16] now there are times and i've got to lay
[1:09:18] this foundation before we move on
[1:09:20] there's times when a good report or
[1:09:24] what the people know is it's necessary
[1:09:26] and this is why again to tell the
[1:09:28] children you want to serve the lord you
[1:09:30] want to serve the lord god can keep you
[1:09:31] from certain things so you can do that
[1:09:34] because there's times when a good report
[1:09:35] is necessary to do certain things
[1:09:38] like preach
[1:09:40] or be a deacon
[1:09:42] there's times it's necessary
[1:09:44] the bible tells us that speaking of a
[1:09:46] pastor or a bishop he must have a good
[1:09:47] report
[1:09:48] of them which are without i like the
[1:09:50] amplified version of that he said
[1:09:51] furthermore he must have a good
[1:09:53] reputation be well thought of by those
[1:09:55] outside the church
[1:09:56] why is that important because we deal in
[1:09:59] trust
[1:10:01] that's that's the currency of of
[1:10:03] ministry is trust
[1:10:05] people don't trust you they won't listen
[1:10:06] to you
[1:10:08] and and i will say that
[1:10:10] if you let a man preach that would split
[1:10:12] the church beca if you preach because
[1:10:15] his reputation is so bad to be pastoral
[1:10:17] malpractice but the man may be
[1:10:19] completely forgiven
[1:10:22] because a man who has truly returned to
[1:10:24] christ or a woman who's truly returned
[1:10:25] to christ
[1:10:26] is justified so they never did it in the
[1:10:28] first place but we deal in trust that's
[1:10:31] it we have a duty a fiduciary duty to
[1:10:33] the church you understand what that is
[1:10:35] we've been placed in something that it's
[1:10:36] bigger than us
[1:10:38] right we've been putting trust of
[1:10:40] something let's hold that with our lives
[1:10:42] let's hold on to our morality let's hold
[1:10:44] on to our standards
[1:10:47] as ministers and officers of the church
[1:10:49] brother brandon put it this way he said
[1:10:50] the preacher's called to preach is his
[1:10:52] sermon and to live it too if you can't
[1:10:55] live it stop preaching it you say well
[1:10:57] he's justified he never did in the first
[1:10:58] place he needs to stop preaching if he
[1:11:00] can't live it
[1:11:01] but you're supposed to live your sermons
[1:11:04] that's all of us
[1:11:07] hey man you can't change the past right
[1:11:10] sometimes even if you do your best to
[1:11:12] live a life above reproach when you go
[1:11:14] to do a work for god or even try to be a
[1:11:16] christian you feel condemnation
[1:11:18] some of you feel condemnation even when
[1:11:20] you testify to somebody
[1:11:22] because you know you were worse than
[1:11:23] them one day yeah sure
[1:11:27] but that ought to highlight the grace of
[1:11:28] god in your life
[1:11:30] that ought to just express yes i was i
[1:11:32] was a fraud i was i was outside the
[1:11:35] grace of god i was an unbeliever but i'm
[1:11:37] where i am today by the grace of
[1:11:39] almighty god
[1:11:42] but you feel this condemnation because
[1:11:44] you know how important the work is and
[1:11:46] so you might say even preachers
[1:11:47] sometimes what if i fail what if i'm not
[1:11:50] really as good a christian as the people
[1:11:51] think i am what about the mistakes that
[1:11:53] i've made
[1:11:55] we all make mistakes
[1:11:57] man he's going to be baptized today but
[1:11:59] many will make mistakes these young
[1:12:01] people sometimes they get baptized boy
[1:12:02] i'm a christian now
[1:12:04] i'm going to live for god now but they
[1:12:06] live in the flesh they're going to make
[1:12:08] mistakes
[1:12:10] but remember greater is he that is in
[1:12:12] you
[1:12:13] than he that is in the world
[1:12:15] he's still bigger than your mistakes
[1:12:17] don't ever no matter how big the mistake
[1:12:20] is don't ever neglect to turn right
[1:12:22] around and say god i know that you are
[1:12:24] bigger than that i know you can forgive
[1:12:26] me i know you will
[1:12:28] oh my
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:31] but your conscience will continue to
[1:12:33] chirp at you
[1:12:35] to chirp at you you remember pinocchio
[1:12:39] the story of pinocchio didn't start with
[1:12:41] walt disney it's an old story an old
[1:12:43] fable story pinocchio what did they make
[1:12:46] the conscience of pinocchio
[1:12:48] a cricket
[1:12:50] boy i don't have anybody to watch that
[1:12:52] when they were kids praise god you know
[1:12:56] jiminy cricket
[1:12:58] remember jiminy cricket
[1:13:00] he's always chirping at pinocchio
[1:13:02] he wasn't a very good conscience
[1:13:05] he was a conscience
[1:13:07] he made some mistakes
[1:13:09] but see that's your conscience but your
[1:13:11] conscience sometimes is wrong
[1:13:14] now in that movie they tell you let your
[1:13:15] conscience be your guide but that's
[1:13:16] sometimes wrong but you know it's that
[1:13:18] cricket that keeps you up at night
[1:13:22] when we were in egypt brother wilson
[1:13:24] woke up one morning and i mean he's dead
[1:13:26] to the world he just he didn't sleep and
[1:13:28] he walks out he's grumpy and excuse me
[1:13:31] brother wilson if you watch this but he
[1:13:32] was he was upset he was grumpy and what
[1:13:35] in the world happened to brother wilson
[1:13:36] well
[1:13:37] all night long there had been a cricket
[1:13:38] in his room
[1:13:41] and that thing every time he tried to
[1:13:43] sleep that thing chirped
[1:13:45] it talked to him every time he tried to
[1:13:47] sleep here he is in in a foreign land
[1:13:49] trying to do mission work and it's quick
[1:13:51] it's crickets peter's gotten used to
[1:13:53] that peter my son he lives in our
[1:13:55] basement so peter's gotten used to that
[1:13:58] peter's only 15 i hope you don't live in
[1:14:00] the basement very much longer
[1:14:02] but
[1:14:04] but he's gotten used to them crickets
[1:14:05] brother wilson couldn't handle it all
[1:14:07] night long that thing kept him up
[1:14:10] i wonder how many times we let crickets
[1:14:13] that's your conscience
[1:14:15] it keeps you up at night
[1:14:18] but see there's things that are under
[1:14:19] the blood yes
[1:14:21] that our conscience still bothers about
[1:14:23] us about see your conscience lies to you
[1:14:25] yes it sure
[1:14:27] it tells you you're still guilty of that
[1:14:31] you you haven't really repented you're
[1:14:33] not a real christian but if you've
[1:14:36] confessed your sin
[1:14:38] and you cl your heart is clean as we
[1:14:41] used to say your conscience is clear but
[1:14:42] remember your conscience it'll still
[1:14:44] come back because you have memory yes
[1:14:47] you remember it
[1:14:49] but god doesn't right yes sir
[1:14:53] you know brother wilson should have done
[1:14:54] to that cricket
[1:14:56] stomp it
[1:14:58] walk over there put your heel on it
[1:15:01] now you can't do that to your conscience
[1:15:02] but you can rule it by the word
[1:15:05] when the cricket gets to chirping you
[1:15:06] can say lord you're the god who gives
[1:15:09] your children sleep you're the god who
[1:15:11] who's forgave me you're the god who put
[1:15:14] my sin in the sea of your forgetfulness
[1:15:16] i'm not gonna let jiminy cricket keep me
[1:15:18] up at night
[1:15:19] are you with me now
[1:15:21] and so many good christians are afraid
[1:15:24] to do what they should do
[1:15:27] because their conscience chirps yes
[1:15:30] now watch
[1:15:31] but that's one of the senses of the
[1:15:33] spirit realm
[1:15:35] now you have to let the word be your
[1:15:36] guide not your conscience the bible says
[1:15:39] if our heart condemn us god is greater
[1:15:41] than our heart
[1:15:42] and knoweth all things
[1:15:45] rahab
[1:15:46] how did the heart at ray have who never
[1:15:48] could get over that reputation you think
[1:15:50] about it there's no way it was too
[1:15:52] public
[1:15:53] it was too much
[1:15:55] how could she believe
[1:15:58] in that instance that's what fascinates
[1:16:00] me about this story that she'd have so
[1:16:02] much faith
[1:16:03] because she wasn't believing in herself
[1:16:06] oh god
[1:16:08] she had confidence in the cord that was
[1:16:11] out the window
[1:16:13] she had confidence in that scarlet cord
[1:16:15] that token and the word of joshua's
[1:16:17] messengers that come to her and said
[1:16:20] we will not destroy you
[1:16:22] if you this token is on display we will
[1:16:25] not destroy you yes
[1:16:28] oh god
[1:16:29] and she had confidence in that so by
[1:16:31] faith rahab
[1:16:33] became
[1:16:34] the mother of boaz now listen to what
[1:16:37] she says joshua 2 and 9 she said to the
[1:16:40] men i know that the lord hath given you
[1:16:42] the land and that your terror is fallen
[1:16:44] upon us that all the inhabitants of the
[1:16:47] land faint
[1:16:48] because of you now it's interesting what
[1:16:50] she says i know
[1:16:53] she didn't just say i've heard
[1:16:55] she didn't just say i what she had heard
[1:16:57] that's how the faith came
[1:16:59] but she didn't say i've just heard they
[1:17:02] had she had her that's the next verse
[1:17:04] but she had not go back to that previous
[1:17:06] verse first nine
[1:17:08] it says and she said unto men i know
[1:17:12] how did she know it was revealed to her
[1:17:14] yes right see for you to really believe
[1:17:17] for you to really have faith it's got to
[1:17:19] be a revelation
[1:17:21] brother madam deals with that in a
[1:17:22] message called perfect faith it also
[1:17:24] deals with it in works this faith
[1:17:25] expressed how that you have to have a
[1:17:27] revelation faith is a revelation by
[1:17:30] faith by faith abel offered a more
[1:17:32] excellent sacrifice than cain how did he
[1:17:34] do that it was revealed to him it was
[1:17:36] blood yes and it wasn't your blood or my
[1:17:39] blood it was the blood of a lamb a
[1:17:41] substitute amen the blood of thee lamb
[1:17:44] do you believe that today
[1:17:46] i know she says
[1:17:48] i wonder how many of us could cry out i
[1:17:50] know the lord has given you the land
[1:17:53] i know that the message of the hour is
[1:17:55] true no matter how many books i get in
[1:17:57] the mail no matter how much internet
[1:17:58] tries to take it away from me no matter
[1:18:00] how many people fail around me it
[1:18:02] doesn't matter i know
[1:18:04] that the lord has given you the land we
[1:18:06] can say that this morning i know there
[1:18:07] will be a rapture i know there will be a
[1:18:10] there will be a coming of christ i know
[1:18:12] that there will be a time when my body's
[1:18:14] going to be changed i know how do you
[1:18:15] know about revelation i know
[1:18:18] not because i've been a good person
[1:18:21] she could not rest
[1:18:23] in being a good person
[1:18:25] i hope you hear it today she could not
[1:18:28] rest in having done everything right and
[1:18:30] kept the commandments oh have you kept
[1:18:32] the commandments of the lord she could
[1:18:33] not say that she had the rich young
[1:18:35] ruler could and he denied christ
[1:18:38] walked away from him but here was the
[1:18:40] woman who had done everything wrong
[1:18:42] who'd been in the worst places you could
[1:18:44] possibly be and she said i know yes sir
[1:18:48] i know that the lord has given you the
[1:18:50] land
[1:18:51] glory
[1:18:52] why did you know for we have heard verse
[1:18:55] 10 of the lord dried up the water of the
[1:18:57] red sea for you faith comes by hearing
[1:19:00] the word of god
[1:19:02] amen faith come by here in joshua 2 11.
[1:19:04] he said and i'm trying not to
[1:19:06] keep you very long so we'll just move
[1:19:08] through these things quickly i'm trying
[1:19:10] not to hold you very long so we've got
[1:19:11] the baptism and then communion tonight
[1:19:14] now
[1:19:15] she said as soon as we had heard these
[1:19:17] things
[1:19:18] our hearts didn't melt neither did there
[1:19:20] remain any more courage in any
[1:19:22] man verse 12
[1:19:24] says now therefore i pray you
[1:19:26] swear unto me by the lord since i have
[1:19:29] showed you kindness that you will also
[1:19:31] show kindness unto my father's house
[1:19:33] give me a true token not based on how i
[1:19:37] made my living in the past
[1:19:39] but i heard the message
[1:19:43] how many have heard a message today
[1:19:45] i've heard the message not my message a
[1:19:47] message god sent by prophet but it
[1:19:50] wasn't the prophet's message the message
[1:19:52] is christ
[1:19:54] amen we heard a message we heard a voice
[1:19:57] yes
[1:19:58] and she said i've heard a message i
[1:20:00] believe the message give me a true token
[1:20:03] yes
[1:20:04] i want something that'll keep me i want
[1:20:06] something that'll make my house stand
[1:20:08] when others fall
[1:20:10] oh that's what you need today
[1:20:12] when you see the world going going down
[1:20:14] when you see public schools becoming
[1:20:16] what they are and my kids are out there
[1:20:18] among that i see that and i see how they
[1:20:20] become more and more worldly less and
[1:20:22] less like like christ the world is
[1:20:24] they're just becoming more and more
[1:20:25] worldly because they don't have no bible
[1:20:27] no more they don't have no teaching
[1:20:28] anymore and i've told you stories about
[1:20:31] my kids some of them didn't even know
[1:20:32] what a bible was the kids they go to
[1:20:34] school with they didn't know anything
[1:20:35] about it my kids try to talk to them
[1:20:37] about the word they don't even have a
[1:20:38] basis for it because they don't believe
[1:20:40] anything that's the world we live in
[1:20:42] today but in a time like that you need
[1:20:44] something that's going to keep your
[1:20:45] children in a in a world like that in a
[1:20:48] culture like jericho's you need
[1:20:50] something that's going to make your
[1:20:51] house sin when the world is shaking
[1:20:53] around you there's got to be something
[1:20:55] what's going to do it it's not going to
[1:20:56] be a preacher or because you go to a
[1:20:58] certain church or how many tapes you
[1:21:00] listen to but it's because there's a
[1:21:02] scarlet cord hanging out the window sir
[1:21:05] amen you have a true token the holy
[1:21:07] spirit in your life yeah
[1:21:09] you know you're gonna make it
[1:21:11] hallelujah
[1:21:13] hallelujah
[1:21:15] amen
[1:21:16] now let's look how do you deal with
[1:21:17] condemnation in your spirit number one
[1:21:19] you turn from every action which is
[1:21:21] condemned by the word if you're doing
[1:21:23] something that's wrong stop yeah
[1:21:25] oh but i can't brother ben stop
[1:21:29] if you can't you need to pray to the one
[1:21:32] who has the power
[1:21:34] ask him to help you
[1:21:36] i know you can't do it in the flesh
[1:21:38] but then with the spirit of god we can
[1:21:40] do all things yes
[1:21:42] first john 3 21 he goes on to say
[1:21:45] beloved if our heart condemn us not then
[1:21:47] have we confidence toward god
[1:21:50] so if you're doing things
[1:21:52] no and here's the problem you can't
[1:21:53] overcome that condemnation when you're
[1:21:55] doing something you know is wrong
[1:21:58] and it afflicts your conscience and then
[1:22:01] you can't overcome that condemnation
[1:22:02] because the word won't back you up
[1:22:05] right now the memories of past sins
[1:22:07] that's been forgiven you can overcome
[1:22:09] that by the word
[1:22:11] but when you're doing something you know
[1:22:13] it's wrong that's why people are so
[1:22:14] miserable when they're backslid
[1:22:17] because they're doing things they know
[1:22:18] is wrong yes i know i'm supposed to be
[1:22:21] in this place or do this thing and i'm
[1:22:22] just not doing it and so they get so
[1:22:24] miserable because they can't overcome
[1:22:26] that by the word because the word is
[1:22:27] constantly preaching at them
[1:22:30] right it's not the preacher or the tape
[1:22:32] they listen to or the stream that
[1:22:34] they're watching it's the word that does
[1:22:35] it
[1:22:36] but see the word oh my the word doesn't
[1:22:39] have to condemn you
[1:22:42] the word offers forgiveness
[1:22:44] the word offers grace
[1:22:46] but you've got to be willing to let go
[1:22:48] of the things that you're doing that's
[1:22:49] repentance
[1:22:51] turn around not just say i'm sorry but
[1:22:53] turn around walk a different direction
[1:22:55] stop trying to worship under
[1:22:57] condemnation
[1:22:59] it's just a show
[1:23:01] you're trying to worship god and you
[1:23:02] can't seem like it and sometimes people
[1:23:04] can't move in church and can't seem like
[1:23:06] they can ever put their hands up can't
[1:23:08] seem like they can ever worship why
[1:23:09] because they got such condemnation stop
[1:23:12] trying to worship under condemnation if
[1:23:14] the condemnation is coming and you have
[1:23:16] word to back you up get rid of it
[1:23:18] and if there's no word to back you up
[1:23:20] get rid of the sin
[1:23:23] you say how can you do that there's a
[1:23:25] place you can leave it
[1:23:27] oh my you can leave it at the foot of
[1:23:29] the cross today it takes a moment to
[1:23:31] repent of it
[1:23:32] but don't try to worship under
[1:23:33] condemnation
[1:23:35] it's impossible
[1:23:37] you'll never get what you need under
[1:23:39] condemnation you've got to come out of
[1:23:41] that and embrace the scripture it says
[1:23:44] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:23:47] you've got to embrace the cross grab
[1:23:49] hold of it
[1:23:51] it's mine
[1:23:55] but if there's things in your life i
[1:23:57] obviously need to be made right and
[1:23:58] everybody knows it make it right
[1:24:02] not harsh that's just the truth
[1:24:05] make it right do the right thing yes
[1:24:07] young people do the right thing
[1:24:09] oh but you don't understand my past do
[1:24:11] the right thing you know what's right
[1:24:13] do justly love mercy
[1:24:15] walk humbly before god
[1:24:17] do the right thing
[1:24:19] jesus tells us if you bring a gift to
[1:24:21] the altar and remember that your brother
[1:24:23] hath ought against thee
[1:24:25] leave your gift before the altar and go
[1:24:27] your way first be reconciled to thy
[1:24:29] brother and then come and offer the gift
[1:24:31] because if you offer the gift under
[1:24:32] condemnation it doesn't do you any good
[1:24:34] right
[1:24:35] you can't have a clear conscience
[1:24:37] brother branham
[1:24:39] in the message perfect faith deals with
[1:24:40] the disciples and the epileptic child
[1:24:44] and deals with this in matthew 17 and 19
[1:24:46] is where it is in the scripture
[1:24:48] and and they had failed to cast out this
[1:24:50] demon that was in the child of epilepsy
[1:24:53] and the child jesus came and he rebuked
[1:24:55] them oh you have little faith and he
[1:24:57] cast the devil out and they come to him
[1:24:59] afterwards and said master why could we
[1:25:01] not cast him out
[1:25:03] and jesus said unto them because of your
[1:25:05] unbelief yeah
[1:25:07] i said wait a minute now watch these men
[1:25:09] had been given power they'd been given
[1:25:12] the ability to cast out devils by the
[1:25:14] word
[1:25:16] but they couldn't have the faith to do
[1:25:18] it in this case
[1:25:20] he said because of your unbelief he said
[1:25:22] verily i say unto you if you have faith
[1:25:23] as a grain of a mustard seed he said if
[1:25:25] you even have the slightest bit of real
[1:25:27] faith
[1:25:28] you could move a mountain with it
[1:25:31] oh you said brother ben i need more
[1:25:32] faith what you need is faith
[1:25:38] it's a grain of a mustard seed
[1:25:40] it'll move a mountain
[1:25:42] but what you need is pure faith mustard
[1:25:44] seed is pure it's not mixed yes
[1:25:47] right you have faith as a grain of a
[1:25:49] mustard seed you should say to this
[1:25:50] mountain remove hence to yonder place
[1:25:51] that shall remove and nothing should be
[1:25:52] impossible nothing let me say nothing
[1:25:54] this morning
[1:25:56] nothing howbeit this kind goeth not out
[1:25:58] by but by prayer and fasting now watch
[1:26:00] how he ties it to their lives yes
[1:26:03] now he says you've been given power but
[1:26:06] now here you don't have faith
[1:26:08] and it's because this kind don't go out
[1:26:10] but by prayer and fasting he said now
[1:26:12] remember they had the power jesus had
[1:26:14] given them power to heal the sick to
[1:26:16] raise the dead to cast out devils just a
[1:26:18] few days before that they had the power
[1:26:20] but not the faith to use the power he
[1:26:22] said now there's the branham tabernacle
[1:26:25] there's the church the bride today
[1:26:28] how many believe you're the bride
[1:26:30] well brother branham's identifying why
[1:26:32] sometimes we can't cast these things out
[1:26:34] he's saying it's because we have the
[1:26:36] power we're not looking for the power
[1:26:38] we're not waiting on a tent meeting
[1:26:40] we're not waiting on another time we're
[1:26:41] not waiting on some big preacher we're
[1:26:43] not waiting on something else what do we
[1:26:45] have we have the power
[1:26:47] who has it
[1:26:48] you have it yes right right melody has
[1:26:52] it
[1:26:53] right by the word
[1:26:55] joel has it by the word
[1:26:57] brother bill has it by the word
[1:26:59] you have it you have the power the
[1:27:01] power's not in the preacher you have the
[1:27:03] power
[1:27:04] the word gave you the power how many
[1:27:06] believers do we have in here today raise
[1:27:08] your hand be proud if you're a believer
[1:27:09] if you're a believer you have the power
[1:27:12] your belief gives you the power to cast
[1:27:15] out devils
[1:27:17] the fact that you're a believer that
[1:27:18] places you in the class where that word
[1:27:20] goes to work for you now watch but if
[1:27:22] you're a believer but you've got to have
[1:27:24] that perfect faith to be able to use
[1:27:26] that power yes
[1:27:28] are you with me now
[1:27:29] but the man said that there's the church
[1:27:31] the bride today the holy spirit is here
[1:27:33] with the power but you haven't got that
[1:27:34] faith to move it see what i mean it
[1:27:36] takes faith to move it he said here i
[1:27:38] got a shell that i hand loaded he said i
[1:27:41] know what it'll do by ballistics like
[1:27:42] the word but i've got to fire the gun
[1:27:46] you hunters all understand that better
[1:27:47] than i do
[1:27:49] but he said i've got to fire the gun
[1:27:51] the fire has to get to the powder
[1:27:54] i know this i used to be with brother
[1:27:56] nolan
[1:27:57] noley's totally was named after brother
[1:27:58] nolan you may not want me to say that
[1:28:00] publicly but
[1:28:02] i believe that's the case
[1:28:04] and brother nolan he used to pack his
[1:28:06] own shells and we would go out and shoot
[1:28:08] his shells were never as good as the
[1:28:10] original
[1:28:11] out of the box you always get a lot more
[1:28:14] hate say that about a good brother but
[1:28:15] there's a lot more uh blanks
[1:28:18] a lot more problems
[1:28:20] now but he could make them even more
[1:28:21] powerful
[1:28:24] if you put enough powder in them
[1:28:26] and that's all i know about shells just
[1:28:28] watching him do that right never done it
[1:28:30] myself but the powder's got the power
[1:28:33] it's got to have fire yeah
[1:28:36] oh god
[1:28:37] oh that's what we need today we've got
[1:28:39] the power
[1:28:41] what we need is the fire
[1:28:44] the fire of faith
[1:28:46] we need the fire we've got the power but
[1:28:48] we need the fire he said the powder's
[1:28:50] got the power but it's got to have the
[1:28:52] fire to light it off and the same thing
[1:28:54] the powder's in the shell but it needs
[1:28:56] faith to charge it and throw it out
[1:28:57] that's what it takes see perfect faith
[1:28:59] are you with me this morning perfect
[1:29:01] faith to ignite the power of the holy
[1:29:03] spirit which we have now
[1:29:06] he didn't say we're waiting on it we're
[1:29:08] oh arms and limbs will be spoken on one
[1:29:09] day right now you have the power
[1:29:13] if you can believe all things
[1:29:16] how many things are limited when you say
[1:29:18] all
[1:29:19] none of them
[1:29:21] that's right
[1:29:22] all things
[1:29:24] are possible
[1:29:26] see he said perfect faith that's what it
[1:29:28] takes perfect faith to ignite the power
[1:29:30] of the holy spirit which we have now
[1:29:32] since he's come upon us faith to ignite
[1:29:34] to see great things again he said the
[1:29:36] disciples had power jesus gave them
[1:29:38] power to heal all manner of sickness to
[1:29:40] cast out devils to cleanse the lepers to
[1:29:42] raise the dead he gave them power but
[1:29:43] they didn't have faith to operate the
[1:29:45] power that they had
[1:29:47] and then they questioned jesus and said
[1:29:48] well now why couldn't we do it he said
[1:29:50] now remember they had the word and the
[1:29:52] word was flesh then and the word told
[1:29:54] them i give you power they had the power
[1:29:56] but they didn't have faith to operate
[1:29:58] the word that was in them yes
[1:30:00] i hope you hear me today
[1:30:02] jesus had he was the word he had faith
[1:30:04] that what he said would happen he said
[1:30:06] oh bring him here how long will i suffer
[1:30:09] you he had faith with his power he said
[1:30:10] how did he he said i can do nothing in
[1:30:12] myself
[1:30:14] well he was virgin born
[1:30:16] and he still had to ignore the flesh
[1:30:20] are you hearing me his five senses
[1:30:22] didn't want to go to the cross
[1:30:24] his five senses told him he was hungry
[1:30:26] his five senses told him he couldn't
[1:30:28] make it his senses told him that just
[1:30:30] like yours does
[1:30:32] he had the same outlet
[1:30:34] he had five senses of the flesh five
[1:30:36] senses of the spirit he was human
[1:30:37] like we are
[1:30:39] but he was virgin born but he was made
[1:30:41] in a manner like us
[1:30:43] he was god's creation but he was a man
[1:30:45] yes i hope you hear me today he had the
[1:30:48] power but he said i do nothing in myself
[1:30:52] he said he relied upon what he was yeah
[1:30:55] i love this
[1:30:56] he relied and not on how he felt right
[1:31:00] but he relied o god he relied in knowing
[1:31:03] that he was the word
[1:31:05] right glory he had faith in god who made
[1:31:08] him the word he was god i'm fixing to
[1:31:10] shout for all of you
[1:31:12] he was god the word and they was in him
[1:31:14] and that gave him faith now watch he's
[1:31:16] talking about they he's listed some
[1:31:17] scriptures that was in him and he said
[1:31:19] he was god the word and those scriptures
[1:31:21] was in him yes
[1:31:22] gloria's got to come more than just off
[1:31:24] the page it's got to come in us
[1:31:26] i got to calm down i'm going to get in
[1:31:28] trouble look
[1:31:31] he was god the word and they was in him
[1:31:33] and that gave him faith because he
[1:31:34] understood his position
[1:31:36] he knew what he was
[1:31:38] not what the people say him that's what
[1:31:40] rahab knew i'm not what the men say that
[1:31:42] i am i'm not what the king of jericho
[1:31:44] says i am i'm not what the people say i
[1:31:46] am i'm who god says i am sir
[1:31:49] glory can you hear that today
[1:31:52] i'm who god says i am i belong to him
[1:31:55] not to these others
[1:31:57] and jesus knew who he was
[1:31:59] he knew what he was
[1:32:01] amen he said he relied upon what god had
[1:32:02] made him and if he did that can't we
[1:32:05] rely upon what god made us as believers
[1:32:08] these signs shall follow them that
[1:32:09] believe he said he had faith in what he
[1:32:11] was
[1:32:12] and if you are a believer you have faith
[1:32:14] in what you are
[1:32:15] you are a believer and if you've got
[1:32:17] faith in god the bible says if our
[1:32:19] hearts condemn us we can't have faith
[1:32:20] but if our hearts don't condemn us and
[1:32:21] we have faith we have confidence towards
[1:32:23] god
[1:32:24] he said but as long as you're doing
[1:32:25] things that's wrong you can't have
[1:32:27] confidence towards god
[1:32:29] that's it
[1:32:31] you realize once you're saved doing
[1:32:32] something wrong doesn't make you a
[1:32:34] sinner
[1:32:35] right
[1:32:36] you can't sin
[1:32:40] what it does is it tries to eat at your
[1:32:41] confidence
[1:32:42] yeah sure
[1:32:45] and knowing that who wouldn't want to do
[1:32:46] the right things
[1:32:48] he said but brother ben i can't again
[1:32:50] you're a believer
[1:32:51] you have the power you just have to have
[1:32:53] the faith to operate it yes
[1:32:55] so but if you're doing these things that
[1:32:57] are wrong you can't have confidence
[1:32:58] towards god
[1:32:59] you automatically
[1:33:02] that's why people are so condemned
[1:33:05] oh god help us today
[1:33:07] and again you got to be able to separate
[1:33:09] that
[1:33:10] because there's some people i watch some
[1:33:12] of the most condemned people
[1:33:14] that i deal with some of the most are
[1:33:16] the best saints
[1:33:18] the ones who pray the most and they're
[1:33:20] under such conviction all the time am i
[1:33:22] doing wrong
[1:33:24] you'll see them at the altar praying
[1:33:26] you'll see they'll come and talk to me
[1:33:27] am i doing wrong is there something
[1:33:29] wrong with me
[1:33:30] but but it's satan he comes into that
[1:33:32] memory and that conscience and he comes
[1:33:34] down and tries to destroy that
[1:33:35] confidence
[1:33:37] you've got to be able to separate that
[1:33:38] but if you are doing things that are
[1:33:39] wrong
[1:33:41] yes
[1:33:42] you can't have any confidence that's
[1:33:44] right
[1:33:45] because you got no word to back you up
[1:33:47] he said you'll automatically know that
[1:33:49] you're wrong you automatically put now
[1:33:51] watch
[1:33:52] you're not a sinner
[1:33:53] but you put yourself as a sinner yes
[1:33:57] yeah
[1:33:59] boy
[1:34:00] i hope this helps you it doesn't mean
[1:34:04] because i'm a preacher i'm a pastor
[1:34:06] sometimes i feel like a sinner
[1:34:09] let's be honest with you and it's not
[1:34:11] because of anything that necessarily
[1:34:12] that i've done is conscious
[1:34:15] memories
[1:34:17] right
[1:34:19] now you either are a christian or you're
[1:34:20] not right you take communion tonight
[1:34:22] some people refuse to take communion
[1:34:24] they just won't take communion because
[1:34:25] they feel like well i'm not worthy of it
[1:34:27] well have you repented
[1:34:30] well you say well no no well why don't
[1:34:31] you
[1:34:34] well wherever right now
[1:34:36] yes sir
[1:34:39] you don't have to tell somebody else
[1:34:40] about it unless it's something you've
[1:34:42] done to somebody it needs to be made
[1:34:43] right
[1:34:44] there's a place for that but if it's
[1:34:46] something that you've done and it's
[1:34:48] between you and god you got to make that
[1:34:49] right with god how long does that take
[1:34:52] you can do it in the song service you
[1:34:54] can do it right now you can be ready for
[1:34:55] communion tonight
[1:34:57] why because you believe god you believe
[1:35:00] god over yourself
[1:35:02] my mind tells me that i'm not right my
[1:35:05] body tells me but my faith tells me i'm
[1:35:08] a believer
[1:35:10] hallelujah
[1:35:12] my faith tells me i'm eligible to be
[1:35:14] married to christ
[1:35:16] oh god
[1:35:18] oh i'm telling you what your reputation
[1:35:19] might make you ineligible for some
[1:35:21] things but it'll never make you
[1:35:22] ineligible to to marry christ
[1:35:26] oh god because what he he can forgive
[1:35:29] and forget
[1:35:31] and you could be just as much the bride
[1:35:33] as anybody else ever was
[1:35:35] get away from that old legalist to think
[1:35:37] well i don't know if i can be the bride
[1:35:38] or not you need to let go of that you
[1:35:40] need to believe that god called a harlot
[1:35:42] rahab and put it right in the lineage of
[1:35:44] god you need to believe that god called
[1:35:46] tamar and put her right in the limits of
[1:35:47] the lineage of god you need to believe
[1:35:50] that god called women there in the new
[1:35:52] testament and a woman who was accused of
[1:35:54] committing adultery was caught in the
[1:35:55] very act and jesus said i don't condemn
[1:35:57] you
[1:35:58] that's right
[1:36:01] you need to believe that
[1:36:03] but then i do believe that then let the
[1:36:04] condemnation go yes and you how do you
[1:36:07] do that we'll show that in a minute i'm
[1:36:09] getting way ahead of myself maybe that's
[1:36:10] a good thing because i'm almost out of
[1:36:12] time
[1:36:14] hey man i might just get past some of
[1:36:15] this
[1:36:17] brother robert you're gonna have to try
[1:36:18] to find me
[1:36:20] jesus knew who he was without a shadow
[1:36:22] of a doubt he knew he was the son of god
[1:36:25] he knew it for the word identified the
[1:36:26] word of god identified who he was
[1:36:29] he said if i do not the works of my
[1:36:31] father don't believe me but if i do then
[1:36:33] believe the works for they are the
[1:36:34] manifested word promised he said oh if
[1:36:36] you could just wake up to that a minute
[1:36:38] you see the word itself identified him
[1:36:40] who he was
[1:36:42] and he said who can condemn me of sin
[1:36:45] well i love it in other words who can
[1:36:46] show me that my life and my works don't
[1:36:49] fulfill exactly what messiah should do
[1:36:51] nobody could say nothing for he was
[1:36:55] glory that's the kind of life he wants
[1:36:57] us to live you can't do that on your own
[1:36:59] that takes the holy ghost
[1:37:01] he said then he had faith to believe
[1:37:03] then of whatever he said it would happen
[1:37:04] then he turned around and said the works
[1:37:06] that i do show you also a little while
[1:37:08] the world says no more yet you shall
[1:37:10] because i'll be with you even in you
[1:37:13] take no thought what you shall say for
[1:37:14] it's not you that speak it's the father
[1:37:16] that dwelleth in you he's the one who
[1:37:17] does the speaking
[1:37:18] amen rehab had been a heart of but
[1:37:21] something changed in her house
[1:37:23] her faith caused her to perform the
[1:37:25] works of a believer she didn't keep
[1:37:26] living that way
[1:37:28] but she believed
[1:37:30] and james 2 25 tells us that rahab was
[1:37:32] justified by works
[1:37:34] do you know that now he's presenting the
[1:37:36] other side of it brother branham said
[1:37:37] brother brown said paul saw what god
[1:37:39] sees yes
[1:37:41] amen james saw what man sees
[1:37:44] and so now he says likewise also was not
[1:37:46] ray have the harlot justified by works
[1:37:48] when she had received the messengers and
[1:37:49] then sent them out another way
[1:37:51] as the body without the spirit is dead
[1:37:53] so faith without works is dead also
[1:37:55] works for the brandon said is faith
[1:37:56] expressed
[1:37:58] you ever thought about that title works
[1:37:59] is faith expressed when the word is
[1:38:02] revealed to you that moment you act on
[1:38:04] it and your own action of faith gives
[1:38:06] you confidence in god's word brother
[1:38:08] said the actions that they took shows us
[1:38:10] that they believed
[1:38:11] that they had a revelation of faith the
[1:38:14] fact that she hid the messengers shows
[1:38:16] us she had a revelation of faith
[1:38:19] amen now notice
[1:38:21] so you you if you're doing something
[1:38:22] wrong quit yeah
[1:38:25] stop making excuses
[1:38:27] but secondly when you know you have
[1:38:29] believed the message of the hour
[1:38:31] and the token is on display
[1:38:34] take every condemning thought and put it
[1:38:37] under arrest
[1:38:39] right bind it yes
[1:38:42] you can't help but have it but you can
[1:38:43] bind it
[1:38:45] the scripture says cast down
[1:38:46] imaginations and everything that
[1:38:48] exhausts itself against the knowledge of
[1:38:50] god and brings into captivity every
[1:38:52] thought
[1:38:54] we don't guard our thought life enough
[1:38:56] right
[1:38:59] the problem is unguarded moments you
[1:39:01] realize some people trying to be
[1:39:03] spiritual leave their mind unguarded
[1:39:07] because they want to be spiritual they
[1:39:08] want to they want to have all this uh
[1:39:10] these great spiritual happenings and i
[1:39:12] believe in those things but sometimes in
[1:39:14] doing that you leave your mind and heart
[1:39:15] unguarded
[1:39:17] and so you end up under condemnation
[1:39:19] because satan brings thoughts in those
[1:39:21] quiet moments
[1:39:22] if you're in a quiet moment make sure
[1:39:23] you're meditating on the word otherwise
[1:39:24] you'd be better off working
[1:39:27] because if you leave yourself open
[1:39:29] that's why there's always got to be a
[1:39:30] balance in our lives
[1:39:32] if you leave yourself open to those
[1:39:33] things especially young people if
[1:39:35] they're idle these things come into
[1:39:37] their mind and begin to work on them
[1:39:38] begin to don't be idle
[1:39:41] find something to do
[1:39:43] i'm glad i grew up when i left home i
[1:39:45] was poor mostly self-imposed but i was
[1:39:47] poor
[1:39:49] and i had to work i thought such a
[1:39:51] terrible thing to have to work and to
[1:39:53] have to preach and and to have to get
[1:39:55] ready to get married and working three
[1:39:57] jobs and trying to get ready to get
[1:39:59] married and
[1:40:00] and then get engaged and plan for a
[1:40:02] wedding which i didn't really have any
[1:40:03] part of anyhow and all those except to
[1:40:05] be there and all those things that we
[1:40:07] had to do you know and and i thought oh
[1:40:09] that's so terrible i can't wait for a
[1:40:11] day but you know when you have more time
[1:40:13] you have more thoughts
[1:40:18] so i believe in keeping kids busy
[1:40:20] i told somebody if my kids show up in my
[1:40:23] house and i'm there i feel like it's my
[1:40:24] job to give them something to do
[1:40:28] that's why they like going to school
[1:40:33] but now look we got to bring into
[1:40:35] captivity those thoughts you're going to
[1:40:36] have them
[1:40:40] how many brother ben every thought
[1:40:43] but it feels good to have that thought
[1:40:45] take the thought
[1:40:47] bind it
[1:40:48] listen you men are going to deal with
[1:40:50] lustful thoughts that's part of being a
[1:40:51] man
[1:40:52] bind it
[1:40:56] oh i'm under condemnation i had a
[1:40:57] lustful thought find it
[1:41:00] cast it out yes
[1:41:02] get rid of it
[1:41:05] well that was what rahab had to do she
[1:41:07] had to
[1:41:08] because she lived that way yeah she'd
[1:41:10] been there those memories would come
[1:41:13] but she bound them
[1:41:15] i'm not who i was
[1:41:17] are you with me now
[1:41:19] yes
[1:41:20] oh god
[1:41:21] why could she do that
[1:41:23] because she knew joshua had honored the
[1:41:25] token right
[1:41:27] now watch there's got to come a
[1:41:29] confidence in your life in a time this
[1:41:31] is growing up in christ
[1:41:33] there's a moment when you display the
[1:41:34] token
[1:41:35] and then you have to have confidence
[1:41:37] that god honored that
[1:41:39] you've grown up you've seen the bill and
[1:41:41] sister karen know that you've seen that
[1:41:43] down through your life that token was on
[1:41:44] display god honored it
[1:41:46] and no matter what other people say god
[1:41:48] honored my token
[1:41:51] are you with me now but jt knows that
[1:41:52] you elderly elderly people i don't want
[1:41:54] to call all of you out that but you know
[1:41:56] that sister betty you know that god
[1:41:58] there's to come a point in your life god
[1:41:59] honored that token
[1:42:01] you put it on display and when you did
[1:42:03] you you got rid of the things that were
[1:42:05] wrong and
[1:42:06] and your life changed you cleaned up and
[1:42:08] the holy spirit come in your life and
[1:42:09] then one day something happened and
[1:42:11] seemed like everything shook around you
[1:42:13] but you didn't shake
[1:42:15] seemed like everybody else left
[1:42:16] everybody else gave up maybe a church
[1:42:18] full of people that you went to church
[1:42:20] with you knew you were young but now you
[1:42:21] look back and you're old and hardly any
[1:42:23] of them in church but you still are why
[1:42:25] are you still in the house of god why
[1:42:26] are you still standing after extreme
[1:42:28] difficulty why did you come back after
[1:42:30] making mistakes because there was a
[1:42:32] token
[1:42:34] and god is honoring that token
[1:42:37] oh god you are not destroyed
[1:42:43] oh god
[1:42:45] he honors that applied token in my life
[1:42:48] see he honored it yes i don't really
[1:42:50] care if you do or not
[1:42:53] all
[1:42:54] right when it comes to this you
[1:42:56] understand
[1:42:58] there's positions in the church things
[1:42:59] where you have to watch what you do and
[1:43:01] all of this but when it comes to the
[1:43:03] word who i am in christ yes i don't care
[1:43:06] who else honors me yeah
[1:43:10] the token honors me yeah
[1:43:12] god honored the token
[1:43:17] you could say you can believe anything
[1:43:18] you want to believe say what you want
[1:43:19] but has has god honored the token in
[1:43:21] your life
[1:43:25] look she perished not with them that
[1:43:27] believed not
[1:43:28] now brother branham said
[1:43:29] anyone knows anything about the bible

[1:43:34] oh glory to god
[1:43:35] she sure was
[1:43:37] she perished not with them and believed

[1:43:40] hour
[1:43:41] no he said the same oath is today
[1:43:44] the same oath i promised brother andrew

[1:43:49] branham said the mighty angel said stood
[1:43:52] up there i'm going to put his foot on
[1:43:54] land and see and he stood up there and
[1:43:55] he raised his hand toward heaven and
[1:43:57] brother brown said he presented a sworn
[1:43:58] affidavit to the church yes
[1:44:02] he made an oath the bible says he swore
[1:44:04] by himself
[1:44:07] glory
[1:44:08] he did predestinate to be conformed to
[1:44:10] the image of his son amen that's why
[1:44:12] that was his sworn affidavit i will not
[1:44:14] let you perish that's my oath he says
[1:44:18] amen romans 8 let's read it before we go

[1:44:23] there's a revelation we know that all
[1:44:25] things work you might think it you might
[1:44:27] hear it but you got to know it we know
[1:44:29] that all things work together for good
[1:44:31] to them that love god to them who are
[1:44:33] called according to his purpose for whom
[1:44:35] he did for know he also did predestinate
[1:44:38] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:44:39] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:44:41] many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:44:43] predestinate then he also called whom he
[1:44:45] called then he also justified whom he
[1:44:47] justified them he also glorified he
[1:44:49] didn't leave one
[1:44:51] who shall what shall we then say to
[1:44:53] these things if god before us who can be
[1:44:56] against us
[1:44:58] are you hearing me today who can be
[1:45:00] against rahab

[1:45:04] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:45:06] not with him also freely give us all
[1:45:08] things who shall lay anything to the
[1:45:10] charge of god's elect it is god that
[1:45:12] justify it yes
[1:45:14] oh glory who is he that condemneth it is
[1:45:17] christ that died they say well you did
[1:45:18] this prove it
[1:45:20] you can't prove it by the judge
[1:45:25] amen because he come down as a wig to
[1:45:27] judge a judge in this hour
[1:45:30] showed himself
[1:45:32] he went through a prophet's ministry and
[1:45:34] showed that he would he would separate
[1:45:36] the right from the wrong
[1:45:37] what is it
[1:45:38] it's god that justifies who is he that
[1:45:40] condemneth it's christ that died
[1:45:43] hey rather that has risen again it was
[1:45:44] even at the right hand of god who also
[1:45:46] maketh intercession for us
[1:45:49] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:45:51] christ
[1:45:52] tribulation i've heard this before hear
[1:45:55] it again
[1:45:56] and know it
[1:45:59] get a revelation of it
[1:46:01] oh let it sink down into your heart who
[1:46:03] shall separate us from the love of
[1:46:05] christ show tribulation or distress or
[1:46:07] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:46:09] peril or sword as it is written for thy
[1:46:11] sake we are killed all the day long we
[1:46:13] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:46:15] nay and all these things we are more
[1:46:17] than conquerors someone say more than
[1:46:19] conquerors
[1:46:20] more than conquerors to him that loved
[1:46:22] us amen i'm one more than overcome
[1:46:24] hallelujah we are more than conquerors
[1:46:26] to him that loved us i am persuaded that
[1:46:29] neither death nor life nor angels no
[1:46:31] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:46:33] present nor things to come nor height
[1:46:35] nor death nor any other creature shall
[1:46:37] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:46:38] god which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:46:42] hallelujah do you believe that today
[1:46:45] amen
[1:46:47] now listen god didn't just save rahab
[1:46:51] can we get to this before we close
[1:46:53] he gave her a home
[1:46:57] brother brandon said through a
[1:46:58] conversion and through her unfailing
[1:47:00] faith
[1:47:01] in god
[1:47:03] it brought her from a prostitute house
[1:47:05] to a beautiful home
[1:47:07] in bethlehem
[1:47:09] that's the way it does all of us
[1:47:11] from a house of unbelief
[1:47:13] and frustrations
[1:47:15] and immoral acts
[1:47:17] and everything
[1:47:18] to a place position in christ which is
[1:47:21] most
[1:47:23] beautiful
[1:47:25] and we find out they had a lovely home
[1:47:27] in bethlehem a salmon had established it
[1:47:30] and it would become a great place
[1:47:32] and the fertile lands
[1:47:34] now watch can you imagine
[1:47:37] someone coming to bethlehem
[1:47:40] years after
[1:47:42] rahab has set up her house
[1:47:46] she's living as a housewife she don't
[1:47:48] look like she used to yeah let me tell
[1:47:50] you find a home in bethlehem you won't
[1:47:52] look like you used to
[1:47:56] she didn't look like that no more she
[1:47:57] didn't look like a harlot
[1:48:00] she didn't have a reputation in that
[1:48:01] area but say someone would come and they
[1:48:04] would come down and they would come
[1:48:06] knock on the door looking for
[1:48:08] hospitality
[1:48:09] rahab opens the door
[1:48:12] she
[1:48:13] looked at her and said i think i've seen
[1:48:15] you before
[1:48:18] wait a minute
[1:48:20] didn't you used to
[1:48:21] have a house in jericho
[1:48:25] many years ago didn't you used to be a
[1:48:27] harlot
[1:48:30] oh god could you imagine how it must
[1:48:33] make her heart feel
[1:48:35] the condemnation that she might have
[1:48:36] felt
[1:48:40] and then my teller said whoa
[1:48:42] what did you do to deserve all of this
[1:48:47] did you tell your husband the truth
[1:48:50] does he know
[1:48:52] what if he found out
[1:48:54] and she might have said he already knows
[1:48:58] he knew me before i did it
[1:49:02] but joshua honored my token joshua means
[1:49:04] jehovah's savior
[1:49:06] it's a it's a hebrew form of jesus
[1:49:10] amen
[1:49:11] he honored my token i don't live in a
[1:49:14] house of prostitution anymore but i want
[1:49:16] to tell you
[1:49:18] though that is quite a story if you
[1:49:20] think about it
[1:49:21] it would never happen
[1:49:23] do you know why
[1:49:26] it would never happen in her home in
[1:49:27] bethlehem
[1:49:29] turn to joshua 6 21.
[1:49:34] you see
[1:49:37] oh god
[1:49:39] she lived in a city that had been
[1:49:42] destroyed
[1:49:47] everything she ever did was in her old
[1:49:49] home
[1:49:52] you're a new creature in christ
[1:49:55] everything you ever did was in your old
[1:49:57] home

[1:50:01] i'm just going to take off running
[1:50:02] around the church and y'all
[1:50:05] yes
[1:50:07] everything she did was in jericho
[1:50:11] and jericho was utterly destroyed see if
[1:50:14] you if you if you have a probably think
[1:50:16] well maybe i'm not really saved but just
[1:50:17] make sure that the fire of god has gone
[1:50:20] down to the old home and destroyed all
[1:50:22] the evil habits destroyed the atmosphere
[1:50:24] destroy the don't you realize that's
[1:50:26] going to happen one day to this earth
[1:50:28] that all the atmospheres of remembrance
[1:50:30] all the things that would come you won't
[1:50:33] even
[1:50:33] they won't be able to come in heaven and
[1:50:35] say didn't i know you weren't you the
[1:50:37] one who did that weren't you the one oh
[1:50:39] my that stepped out of the grace of god
[1:50:41] they won't know because you're in your
[1:50:43] new home
[1:50:45] all right
[1:50:46] come on they were utterly destroyed
[1:50:49] every person that could have stood an
[1:50:51] accused term
[1:50:53] right glory to god
[1:50:59] i saw this yesterday my wife was
[1:51:00] cleaning the church she'd come in there
[1:51:01] she said what's wrong with you i
[1:51:03] couldn't tell her
[1:51:08] i did it in my old home
[1:51:10] yes
[1:51:11] but i got a new home
[1:51:13] and if this earthly tabernacle be
[1:51:15] dissolved
[1:51:17] i have another one waiting already
[1:51:20] waiting in the heavens
[1:51:23] oh wait do you see
[1:51:25] my new home
[1:51:28] hey bad
[1:51:29] but joshua said to the two men that
[1:51:31] despite out the country going into the
[1:51:33] harlot's house
[1:51:34] bring out vince the woman and all that
[1:51:36] she has
[1:51:37] is he swearing to her it was just her
[1:51:39] and her family
[1:51:40] all of her accusers
[1:51:42] were dead yes
[1:51:47] i never thought about that before
[1:51:49] all of her accusers were dead
[1:51:52] what did
[1:51:53] what did the bible say would happen to
[1:51:55] you you have to read the book of
[1:51:56] revelation you say well there's going to
[1:51:57] be this plague in this plague let's see
[1:51:59] what the bible says at the end of all of
[1:52:00] that oh when all these things are over
[1:52:04] remember
[1:52:05] he said i heard a loud voice in
[1:52:06] revelation 12 10 saying in heaven now
[1:52:09] has come salvation and strength and the
[1:52:11] kingdom of our god and the power of his
[1:52:13] christ
[1:52:14] for the accuser
[1:52:17] that accusing city yes that city full of
[1:52:21] accusations
[1:52:22] has been brought down
[1:52:24] oh my the city has been brought down the
[1:52:27] accuser of my brethren is cast down
[1:52:29] which accused him before our god day and
[1:52:31] night as long as she lived in jericho
[1:52:33] there was always accusation there was
[1:52:35] always condemnation but when she made
[1:52:37] her home in bethlehem then there can
[1:52:39] therefore now be no condemnation anymore
[1:52:42] for those who walk in the not after the
[1:52:44] flesh but after the spirit that's the
[1:52:46] one who lives in bethlehem
[1:52:48] hallelujah
[1:52:50] what did they overcome him by he accused
[1:52:52] him before our god day and night but
[1:52:54] they overcame him by the blood of the
[1:52:56] lamb and by the word of their testimony
[1:52:58] they believed
[1:53:00] amen and the blood of the lamb becomes
[1:53:02] effective when you put your faith in it
[1:53:05] amen
[1:53:07] the only thing in bethlehem yes that
[1:53:09] could condemn rahab was her own memory
[1:53:13] yes
[1:53:14] and one day that won't even be a problem
[1:53:19] wipes away all memory of sin
[1:53:25] as we said the woman caught in adultery
[1:53:27] she come jesus stood there and here she
[1:53:29] was and all the men had drifted away
[1:53:31] because he said the one without sin let
[1:53:33] him cast the first stone in their
[1:53:34] conscience
[1:53:36] convicted all of them
[1:53:38] he said woman where are the accusers and
[1:53:40] she said does any man accuse he said no
[1:53:42] man lord
[1:53:44] and jesus said to her neither do i
[1:53:45] condemn me
[1:53:47] the only one who could condemn you there
[1:53:49] won't
[1:53:54] go and sin
[1:53:57] no more there is therefore now musicians
[1:53:59] go ahead and come no condemnation
[1:54:02] no condemnation
[1:54:05] doesn't that sound pleasant
[1:54:07] sound like a good place to live
[1:54:10] build your home in bethlehem
[1:54:12] live for god
[1:54:14] go to church be a christian a real
[1:54:16] christian
[1:54:18] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:54:20] to them which are in christ jesus who
[1:54:22] walked not after the flesh
[1:54:25] but after the spirit
[1:54:27] would you bow your heads with me
[1:54:30] maybe you find yourself this morning in
[1:54:31] that class of people who
[1:54:34] have condemnation because
[1:54:37] of things they're doing right now if
[1:54:38] that's the case why don't you just
[1:54:39] repent of those things right now
[1:54:41] there's something that needs to be made
[1:54:42] right go make it right
[1:54:44] do the right thing
[1:54:46] as much as is in your power to do it
[1:54:48] when you don't have power to do it
[1:54:50] anymore
[1:54:51] you ask god to give you the strength
[1:54:54] do everything you can to roll away the
[1:54:56] stone but only god can raise the dead
