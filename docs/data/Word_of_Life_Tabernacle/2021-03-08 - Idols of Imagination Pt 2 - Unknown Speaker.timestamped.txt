[39:35] the shame was with us and every one of
[39:37] you you regular folk
[39:39] bless my heart coming to church really
[39:42] does mean something to be in the house
[39:44] of god when so many forsake the
[39:46] assembling of themselves together today
[39:48] but it means something to be in the
[39:50] house of the lord amen jeremiah chapter
[39:53] 7 and verse 16.
[39:56] and this is the scripture that brother
[39:58] branham used in christianity versus
[40:00] idolatry in fact he read this portion
[40:02] twice
[40:04] he said therefore pray not thou for this
[40:06] people
[40:08] god didn't mess with idolaters he said
[40:11] pray not thou for this people it reminds
[40:13] me of what brother branham said about
[40:14] this country that i don't pray for it
[40:16] anymore
[40:17] pray not thou for this people neither
[40:19] lift up cry nor prayer for them
[40:22] neither make intercession to me for i
[40:24] will not hear thee
[40:26] see us thou not what they do in the
[40:28] cities of judah and in the streets of
[40:29] jerusalem
[40:31] the children gather wood and the fathers
[40:33] kindle the fire
[40:34] and the women need their dough to make
[40:36] cakes to the queen of heaven
[40:39] to pour out drink offerings unto other
[40:41] gods
[40:42] that they may provoke me to anger my
[40:46] it was a serious thing idolater idolatry
[40:49] is a serious thing and it is yet today i
[40:52] pray the lord without his blessing to
[40:53] the word you may be seated
[40:57] but stuart i saw you slip into tonight
[40:59] and
[41:00] i was this was your service so

[41:06] doesn't go well

[41:10] appreciate you coming back buddy this
[41:12] afternoon i know that's quite a drive
[41:14] where he was preaching away as we said
[41:17] this morning the term imagination comes
[41:19] from the latin verb imaginary
[41:22] it means to picture oneself to make an
[41:24] image
[41:26] and that's what idolatry is it's not
[41:28] that imagination itself is wrong but
[41:30] when we exalt
[41:31] imagination over the word it's wrong
[41:35] and it doesn't matter what the
[41:37] imagination is
[41:40] if it's not the word it's not right and
[41:42] that's what makes it so hard for people
[41:44] because
[41:45] we tend to love to tear down other
[41:47] people's idols
[41:51] it's one thing to tear down other
[41:52] people's idols but it's the idols in our
[41:54] own heart
[41:56] in our own imagination the things that
[41:58] we hold to but howard that are not right
[42:00] those are the things that are hardest to
[42:01] tear down
[42:03] huh it's hard because
[42:06] it's good to see it too tonight brother
[42:07] howard i didn't mean to single brother
[42:09] david out not you but
[42:10] but that's it's hard to we hold these
[42:13] things
[42:13] as as something that we should hold on
[42:16] to and not realizing that
[42:17] it's tearing us it's keeping us from god
[42:21] even we may have got it from our father
[42:22] i think of of
[42:24] the man in the bible who was told gideon
[42:26] who was told to go
[42:27] tear down the idols in his father's
[42:29] house
[42:32] and sometimes that has to be done it's
[42:36] the imagination that creates itself an
[42:38] image
[42:39] i'm just going to preach to you for a
[42:41] few minutes tonight so just listen
[42:42] quickly but
[42:43] it's the imagination of self that
[42:45] creates an image of what i want god to
[42:47] be
[42:48] but god is who he says he was and that
[42:52] should not be
[42:52] just a bad thing but it should be a
[42:54] comfort to us because if he's not who he
[42:56] says he is
[42:56] how can we trust him to be a healer how
[42:59] can we trust him to be a savior
[43:00] how can we trust him to be a deliverer
[43:03] but he is who he says he is in the word
[43:05] and because he reveals himself to us in
[43:07] the word brother sam we can have hope we
[43:09] can have confidence
[43:10] that he is god and he's the same
[43:13] yesterday today and forever
[43:16] i want to identify tonight some idols of
[43:18] imagination
[43:20] that folks have made and
[43:23] these are just ones i've seen you know
[43:25] when paul
[43:27] walks over in mars hill and he begins to
[43:29] look around he sees idols to jupiter and
[43:32] and idols to apollo and all the
[43:34] different idols
[43:35] he says you're too superstitious and
[43:38] it's not that you're trying to treat
[43:40] people badly but it's just
[43:41] you see idols and and they shouldn't be
[43:44] there and
[43:45] these are things that we all struggle
[43:47] with i think at some on some level
[43:49] the things we see today in 2020
[43:52] one i think it is in 2021 things that we
[43:56] see
[43:56] i see idols of yesterday
[44:00] people make a god out of history
[44:03] or a god that only does things in
[44:05] history
[44:07] this happens too with people who've
[44:09] maybe been exposed to something that's
[44:11] very bad and
[44:12] very wrong and they make that something
[44:13] that controls their life
[44:16] maybe it's something that you did
[44:17] yourself and you just can't ever get
[44:19] away from that
[44:20] you've got to let history be history
[44:23] because as we said this morning
[44:24] he didn't reveal himself as the great i
[44:26] was he revealed himself as the great i
[44:28] am
[44:32] so they imagine that god has stopped
[44:34] being what he always was i've always
[44:36] been struck by the story and you can
[44:38] find it in the book of haggai i believe
[44:40] where here is jerubal he's built the
[44:42] temple and
[44:43] all these wonderful things that have
[44:45] come and the people have worshiped again
[44:46] in the land
[44:47] but it says that the old men cried when
[44:50] they saw the temple that had been built
[44:52] because there was nothing in their eyes
[44:53] compared to what it used to be
[44:56] because they could remember what it was
[44:58] in solomon's day but
[45:00] the prophet tells them he says don't
[45:02] despise the day of small things
[45:05] because god's doing something today he
[45:07] has to be
[45:08] because that's the kind of god he is he
[45:11] doesn't just do things yesterday he's
[45:13] doing something today
[45:14] and what is god doing today whatever
[45:16] that is i want to be a part of that
[45:18] i want to find out what god's will is
[45:20] and say lord whatever you're doing today
[45:22] let me be right there in the middle of
[45:23] your will
[45:25] amen i appreciate what you did yesterday
[45:27] like blind bartimaeus consent could sit
[45:29] there by the wall
[45:30] and he could remember what god did
[45:32] yesterday he could remember
[45:34] that there was a man who stood there by
[45:36] that same wall one day and it was a
[45:38] it was the angel of the covenant stood
[45:39] there with a drawn sword
[45:42] he would recognize the history of the
[45:44] place but he also
[45:46] believed that the same angel of the
[45:49] covenant if he stood there once by the
[45:51] wall of jericho he could stand there
[45:53] again
[45:54] and if he could deliver jericho and the
[45:56] walls would be walls could be shaken
[45:58] down and
[45:58] and rahab and her family could come out
[46:00] if he could do that then
[46:01] he can do that today do you believe that
[46:04] he's still the same yesterday today and
[46:06] forever
[46:08] amen i didn't eat too much
[46:12] so we're okay
[46:15] [Laughter]
[46:17] see they imagine that god stopped being
[46:19] what he always was
[46:20] i don't i don't need a god that isn't
[46:22] what he was
[46:24] i need a god who's the same as jesus
[46:26] christ hebrews 13
[46:27] 8 the same yesterday today and forever
[46:30] malachi 3 and 6 says for i am the lord
[46:32] i change not and because of this fact
[46:36] therefore because i am the lord and i
[46:39] change
[46:40] not you sons of jacob are not consumed
[46:43] amen see an idol you can make it into
[46:46] whatever you want it to be
[46:48] you can take that wood if you carved it
[46:50] you made it you can also change it
[46:54] if you made it out of uh the calf out of
[46:57] the gold or whatever you you can change
[46:59] it into something else
[47:00] it was an earring and then it become a
[47:02] calf but that's not you know it's one
[47:04] denomination it becomes another but my
[47:06] god never changes
[47:08] and he said because i changed not
[47:10] therefore you sons of jacob are not
[47:12] consumed
[47:13] because i don't change not only in a way
[47:15] that
[47:16] i keep my word but i keep my word for
[47:18] you
[47:20] amen he chose you and he doesn't change
[47:22] that choosing
[47:24] i want to look at a specific area we'll
[47:26] move right along
[47:28] to another one here this afternoon and
[47:31] it's
[47:31] by no means we don't have time to go
[47:33] through everything but just to
[47:34] kind of give us an idea what these idols
[47:36] might be an
[47:38] idol of yesterday god is not the same he
[47:41] doesn't
[47:42] brother branham would preach about it
[47:44] that how that in that day they would say
[47:45] the days of miracles are past
[47:48] and today people think that god doesn't
[47:50] work in the church the way he always did
[47:53] but that's not what god said
[47:58] this is what a prophet of god told us he
[48:00] said he said some in the church teachers
[48:01] apostles prophets
[48:03] gifts of healing working of miracles
[48:06] all those things are set in the church
[48:11] now if i set something in the church and
[48:14] i put it there
[48:17] and i don't take it out and it's not
[48:19] there
[48:21] what happened to it somebody else took
[48:24] it out
[48:27] right there's some elementary doctrine
[48:30] for you
[48:31] if i put it in the church and it's not
[48:33] there anymore somebody else took it out
[48:36] if god said it in the church and he
[48:39] didn't take it out
[48:41] who made that idol
[48:46] who crafted it who made it god don't do
[48:49] that anymore
[48:51] you better be careful of that
[48:54] huh said do you believe that he said i
[48:56] never did say where
[48:57] he said i never did say where they'd be
[48:59] set out of the church
[49:01] then who said it it wasn't a prophet of
[49:05] god
[49:06] he set them in the church for the
[49:07] perfecting of the church and to be in
[49:08] the church
[49:09] until he comes again
[49:13] that just ought to be enough for us we
[49:16] just believe the word
[49:18] all right but because people have
[49:19] worshiped a god of yesterday
[49:22] they can't see that he still has
[49:25] preachers
[49:26] he still has teachers he still has
[49:28] evangelists he still has gifts
[49:30] because that's the part and parcel of it
[49:32] you understand
[49:33] it all has to come together now
[49:36] he said they say oh he's still got
[49:39] teachers and evangelists and pastors he
[49:40] said but what about prophets and so
[49:42] forth
[49:44] now let me let me back up i missed that
[49:46] one he said now the bible said that god
[49:48] set in the church apostles prophets
[49:49] teachers evangelists and pastors
[49:51] he never did say where he set out of the
[49:52] church he never said it
[49:54] where he set out of the church apostles
[49:56] and prophets now
[49:58] remember in that day they were teaching
[49:59] a doctrine that there was no such thing
[50:00] as
[50:01] apostles and prophets anymore but they
[50:04] had pastors evangelists and teachers
[50:06] right and so brother branham says okay
[50:08] if you say there's pastors evangelists
[50:09] and teachers but there's no
[50:10] apostles and prophets number one if you
[50:13] have the authority to say there's
[50:15] pastors evangelists and teachers
[50:17] and then you have to also say there's
[50:19] apostles and prophets you can't take
[50:20] this part of it
[50:22] right because if you're if there's no
[50:25] apostles and prophets
[50:26] there's no pastors evangelists and
[50:27] teachers right he never said it out of
[50:30] the church
[50:31] and so he says they say oh he's still
[50:34] got teachers and evangelists and pastors
[50:35] what about prophets and so forth it's
[50:37] still just the same
[50:38] god doesn't change it all goes together
[50:42] right they say oh he's still got um
[50:45] he said god doesn't change i'm the
[50:46] future home of the heavenly bridegroom
[50:48] excuse me i'm
[50:49] a little nervous i know i'm in a hurry
[50:51] but i just want to get this to you
[50:53] this evening i'm thankful that many of
[50:54] you came back this afternoon because
[50:57] i want you to understand this you won't
[50:59] understand what i said this morning
[51:00] unless you understand this
[51:03] now he said in malachi 3 i am god and i
[51:05] change not the way he does it therefore
[51:07] if he's saved
[51:08] listen if he the first man he ever saved
[51:10] by the shed blood of an innocent one
[51:12] he'll have to save the next one and
[51:14] everyone he saves will have to be the
[51:16] same way
[51:18] amen he said if you healed a man at any
[51:22] time through the journey of life
[51:25] if he healed a man at any time through
[51:27] the journey of life let it be in the
[51:28] days of jesus the apostles
[51:30] the prophets whenever it was when the
[51:32] same conditions is met
[51:34] he's got to do it again see if you just
[51:38] believe in a god and god that changes or
[51:40] god that stops or god of yesterday
[51:42] then you're saying that god may not do
[51:44] it for me
[51:46] but if you believe in a god it's the
[51:47] same yesterday today and forever then if
[51:49] he did it for them
[51:50] and i meet those same conditions he will
[51:52] do it for me
[51:55] if god provided isaac with a wife if
[51:57] you're single need a wife god will
[51:58] provide a wife for you
[52:02] if god provided uh if god provided
[52:06] healing for bartimaeus's eyes if you're
[52:09] blind
[52:10] and you need sight then god will do it
[52:12] for you if you meet the same conditions
[52:15] whatever god did he still does we can't
[52:18] even look at the message of the hour and
[52:19] see all the people that were healed and
[52:20] all the wonderful miracles
[52:21] if he ever did it he still doesn't we
[52:24] just have to meet the same conditions
[52:29] now brother brown says now the first
[52:31] stage that he brings to us he said his
[52:33] plan of redemption is exactly
[52:34] exactly the same i think we already went
[52:36] through that i'm sorry
[52:39] i'm i'm nervous about the time and i'm
[52:42] taking more time because of it
[52:48] listen he says he don't change
[52:52] man changes time changes
[52:56] age changes dispensation changes
[53:00] but god remains the same he is
[53:04] perfect amen what a hope he said that
[53:07] ought to give the sick people
[53:09] if he ever healed a sick person if he
[53:12] ever healed a person he has to do it
[53:14] again when the same conditions is met if
[53:16] he ever saved a man he's got to do it on
[53:18] the same grounds he did it the first
[53:20] time
[53:21] if he ever filled a man with the holy
[53:22] ghost has he ever filled a man with the
[53:24] holy ghost he filled me
[53:26] then if he's ever filled a man with the
[53:27] holy ghost he is going he's got to do it
[53:29] again
[53:31] if if he comes on the same grounds if
[53:34] ever
[53:35] if he ever raised a man up from the
[53:36] grave he's got to do it the second time
[53:38] and every other time on the same
[53:41] principle
[53:43] hallelujah he doesn't change
[53:47] he said oh what i hope that gives me
[53:50] what is it not in some man-made theory
[53:53] something that groups of men have come
[53:54] together but his unchangeable word
[53:59] i'll read this one more and we'll go on
[54:01] to the next one
[54:02] he said now god is set in the church god
[54:05] not the organization
[54:07] of the achievement of man to make
[54:09] bishops and so forth presbyters
[54:12] he didn't say he'd have presbyters and
[54:14] bishops
[54:15] but god is set in the church first
[54:18] apostles that's missionaries secondarily
[54:20] prophets teachers pastors evangelists
[54:22] god set them in the church and every
[54:23] bugle will blow
[54:25] the same gospel
[54:30] another idol that i see today is the
[54:33] idol of cheap grace
[54:37] just hang with me for a moment i don't
[54:38] want to be harsh
[54:40] but it's an imagination today that
[54:42] people believe that god will not judge
[54:44] their actions by the word
[54:46] that somehow because jesus died for the
[54:49] sins of the world that i don't have to
[54:50] answer for my sins and
[54:52] i just get off scot-free and i can do
[54:54] what i want
[54:56] that's not what god did for us
[55:00] he didn't take those beatings so that
[55:01] you could just go on being who you were
[55:04] he shed that blood just so we could just
[55:06] continue in sin
[55:10] it prospers shall we continue in sin
[55:11] that grace may abound god forbid
[55:14] he didn't do that so we could just
[55:15] continue being who we are but he did it
[55:18] so that we could be changed we could be
[55:19] healed
[55:20] we could be whole amen
[55:24] it's not a god of cheap grace but the
[55:27] manifestation of god that people have
[55:28] created in their minds the idol
[55:30] that they've created as a god that just
[55:32] lets them do whatever they want to do
[55:39] the bible says love not the world
[55:40] neither the things that are in the world
[55:41] if any man love the world the love of
[55:42] the father is not in him
[55:45] that's pretty strict didn't it
[55:48] but it's true for all of us
[55:51] god said be born again i remember some
[55:54] years ago
[55:56] being born again means to change when
[55:58] you were born the first time you changed
[56:02] you changed and then you grew being born
[56:04] again is not about just being born by
[56:05] the way you grow
[56:08] brother branham deals with that and you
[56:09] must be born again he talks about that
[56:11] it's not just an isolated event
[56:14] but it's something that as you go
[56:16] through life you grow you grow you grow
[56:17] you
[56:18] fed the word of god you keep growing you
[56:19] don't stay a baby
[56:22] and so as you grow when you when god
[56:24] said be born again
[56:25] he said he meant born again
[56:28] that's me but that don't mean you stay
[56:30] the same there's got to be a marked
[56:33] difference and i know we struggle with
[56:35] that especially as young people in the
[56:36] message i grew up in the message and
[56:38] growing up
[56:39] it's hard to tell what that difference
[56:40] is but there's got to be a difference
[56:44] in what you were and what you are when
[56:47] you're born again
[56:49] there's something that changes he said
[56:52] you don't mean a handshake or repeat of
[56:54] creed
[56:55] he said but everybody is scared of that
[56:56] new birth i'll use
[56:58] brother jt for example because and i've
[57:00] used it before but
[57:01] i remember years ago with steve and
[57:05] and his son was helping me move his
[57:08] stepson was helping me move he said you
[57:10] know
[57:11] he said dad he said dad always
[57:15] he said he said when he got saved i was
[57:18] talking to
[57:19] him about not coming to church and
[57:22] encouraging him to come back
[57:24] he said when dad got saved he changed
[57:27] well there's simple enough for you
[57:30] he said i don't want to be a hypocrite
[57:33] and i told him i said on some level
[57:34] we're all hypocrites in that in that
[57:36] sense because you can always talk
[57:37] yourself out of being saved
[57:39] right you're always going to do
[57:40] something that people are going to say
[57:42] is not right
[57:43] but he said i remember he was old enough
[57:45] to remember when he said when dad got
[57:46] saved he changed
[57:48] see he didn't drink no more he didn't
[57:49] carry on in lord like he used to he was
[57:51] a different man the day he got saved
[57:54] that's the kind of new birth we believe
[57:55] in god still does that if he ever did
[57:58] that he still does
[57:59] that when god said born again he meant
[58:02] born again he don't mean a handshake
[58:03] repeat of a creed he said everybody is
[58:05] scared of that new birth
[58:08] scared of that new birth but when god
[58:09] says born again he means born again
[58:12] the devil substituted a handshake for it
[58:14] or some kind of a psychic affair that
[58:15] would make you acknowledge
[58:16] yes i'm born again but your life tells
[58:19] what you are the life that's in you
[58:22] another place brother brandon said jesus
[58:24] said all the fathers give me will come
[58:25] to me
[58:26] no man can come except my father draws
[58:28] him all that comes to me i'll give him
[58:30] eternal life
[58:31] raise him up at the last day there's
[58:33] none of them lost
[58:35] he said i lose nothing because no man
[58:37] can pluck them out of my father's hand
[58:39] who gave them to me he said oh my
[58:43] look what this experience of a new birth
[58:45] this is what god wants
[58:46] it's not a cheap grace it's not an idol
[58:48] of a cheap grace but the god of the
[58:49] bible
[58:50] reveals himself as a god that doesn't
[58:52] lose what he saves
[58:56] do you believe that today the god who
[58:58] doesn't lose what he saves
[59:00] and he don't just let him do whatever
[59:02] they want to do but what does he do he
[59:03] changes the want to
[59:07] amen he said he that heareth my words
[59:10] and believeth on him this time he has
[59:11] eternal life and shall never come to the
[59:12] judgment
[59:13] but it's passed from death into life he
[59:16] said that's why this church believes in
[59:17] the security of
[59:19] the perseverance of the saints he said
[59:21] not in the baptist form not in the
[59:23] presbyterian form but in the bible form
[59:26] amen not according to a baptist
[59:28] imagination or a presbyterian
[59:30] imagination
[59:31] but in the bible form you say now
[59:33] brother branham i guess once in grace
[59:35] always in grace that brings a lot of dis
[59:38] inner woman listen to this has been born
[59:40] of the spirit of god
[59:41] old things have passed away all things
[59:44] have become new amen and he's been
[59:46] birthed and blessed by the eternal god
[59:49] they can no more perish than god himself
[59:50] can perish
[59:52] that's why i'm able to take communion
[59:53] not because i'm perfect but i change
[59:55] from death and to life hallelujah you
[59:58] have two if you've been born
[1:00:00] again
[1:00:03] but it's a god of cheap grace that
[1:00:04] doesn't change anybody that's
[1:00:06] it's an idol of imagination
[1:00:09] we have today this is the last one i'll
[1:00:12] deal with
[1:00:12] this evening but we have an idol of
[1:00:15] personal preference
[1:00:18] where we imagine whatever our personal
[1:00:22] preference
[1:00:22] is to be god's word or to be just as
[1:00:26] good as god's word
[1:00:28] and you see that in an extreme example
[1:00:30] with you know i'm made to be a man or a
[1:00:32] woman and then they just change it
[1:00:35] my personal preference
[1:00:38] god made you a man or woman he didn't
[1:00:40] make you to have a decision
[1:00:43] on that you understand and and we don't
[1:00:45] get to just change it
[1:00:47] but people bow at the idol of personal
[1:00:49] preference i can be what i want to be
[1:00:51] but that don't just that's not just in
[1:00:53] the world think about that in a
[1:00:55] spiritual sense
[1:00:57] god's word is true whether i like it or
[1:00:58] not
[1:01:01] we could come back down a little farther
[1:01:02] and say god's word is true whether i can
[1:01:04] live it or not
[1:01:07] it's not up to me anyway it's up to him
[1:01:11] but but the word is true now all of us
[1:01:13] have
[1:01:14] opinions that like noses everybody's got
[1:01:16] one
[1:01:17] all of us have preferences we all have
[1:01:19] prejudices
[1:01:21] now see here you thought i was going to
[1:01:22] name somebody tonight i told you i was
[1:01:24] going to be specific
[1:01:26] but when we really get to looking at
[1:01:28] these idols you know who they look like
[1:01:31] us
[1:01:35] that's the imagination we imagine we're
[1:01:37] okay
[1:01:39] oh god help us today but we're only okay
[1:01:42] if the word says we're okay
[1:01:45] we're not saved by feeling we're saved
[1:01:46] by the word of god we're born again by
[1:01:49] the word of god
[1:01:50] everybody has an opinion but that
[1:01:52] opinion becomes an idol when it begins
[1:01:54] to separate you from fellowship from
[1:01:55] believers
[1:01:58] when you worship that opinion so much
[1:02:00] that it will keep you from doing things
[1:02:02] you know god said to do
[1:02:06] you know he said to do it but you don't
[1:02:08] do it because
[1:02:10] well i got my feelings hurt
[1:02:13] huh that you made your feelings an idol
[1:02:16] over the word of god
[1:02:19] somebody will come with some doctrine or
[1:02:20] some opinion of man and
[1:02:22] i just talking to you tonight and then
[1:02:24] we'll go to communion but
[1:02:26] they'll come with something and some man
[1:02:27] will come out and say i believe you
[1:02:28] should have church 12 times on sunday
[1:02:31] bless god thus saith the lord you should
[1:02:35] have church 12 times on sunday
[1:02:36] well god bless you the word doesn't say
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:42] you say well bless god i believe that i
[1:02:45] believe that you've got to preach
[1:02:46] exactly 45 minutes you've got to do this
[1:02:48] that or the other and maybe they've got
[1:02:50] something they'll draw it from
[1:02:52] god's word doesn't say it
[1:02:56] are you with me now you know if you get
[1:02:59] to study and look and you realize most
[1:03:01] of those things are just personal
[1:03:02] preferences
[1:03:04] and people break fellowship over it
[1:03:08] and they separate from believers and
[1:03:10] they snipe at each other from church to
[1:03:12] church and place to place
[1:03:14] god didn't call us to do that
[1:03:17] we should all be able to take communion
[1:03:19] in essence together we're
[1:03:20] we're part of the body of christ not not
[1:03:22] just this church or
[1:03:24] some other church because i have a
[1:03:26] preference how i like to do things yeah
[1:03:27] there's things that
[1:03:28] i'd like to do and there's things that i
[1:03:30] have a preference you realize as a
[1:03:31] pastor i got to lay down my preferences
[1:03:33] all the time
[1:03:35] for the good of the church you know that
[1:03:37] if you're married you've got to lay down
[1:03:38] your personal preferences all the time
[1:03:41] there's things you'd rather be doing huh
[1:03:45] most of us men would hardly ever want to
[1:03:46] go shopping
[1:03:50] but she wants to go shopping so you lay
[1:03:51] down your preferences but if it becomes
[1:03:53] an
[1:03:53] idol it separates you from other
[1:03:57] believers what did they do
[1:03:58] you go back and look at it go back to
[1:04:00] judges chapter 17
[1:04:02] find out when there's a man named micah
[1:04:04] who set up an idol in his house
[1:04:06] and then he has a priest who he pays ten
[1:04:08] shekels and a shirt
[1:04:10] go back and look it up he pays him 10
[1:04:12] shekels in his shirt to tell him
[1:04:14] what he wants to hear and the bible said
[1:04:17] the priest was happy
[1:04:18] to get his ten shekels in a shirt
[1:04:20] because in that day everybody did what
[1:04:22] they thought was right in their own eyes
[1:04:25] so they
[1:04:26] he then set up an idol in his own house
[1:04:28] and they began to worship and they had
[1:04:30] these things and god and there was a
[1:04:31] blessing there in that house
[1:04:32] and some other people found out about it
[1:04:34] and they come and paid the priests more
[1:04:36] to come in their their camp and the very
[1:04:40] first thing that they did of course he
[1:04:41] was glad to go with them had a bigger
[1:04:42] congregation
[1:04:43] paid more and so he went with them and
[1:04:45] then after he went with them
[1:04:47] you'll find out in the next chapter the
[1:04:48] first thing they did was find an
[1:04:50] innocent city and destroy it
[1:04:54] the very first thing they did was try to
[1:04:56] destroy another church
[1:05:00] why i don't even know why this isn't in
[1:05:03] my notes i don't even know why i'm going
[1:05:04] here
[1:05:06] because it's an idol that a man has set
[1:05:09] up and
[1:05:10] made this to be truth and you find out
[1:05:12] it's not in the bible
[1:05:14] it's not don't come from the message of
[1:05:15] the hour
[1:05:17] oh they may twist some things around try
[1:05:19] to make it look but you can't it can't
[1:05:20] be supported by that
[1:05:22] so they support it by earnestness
[1:05:25] or by the fact well it it makes me feel
[1:05:27] good it works
[1:05:29] denomination works brother brandon told
[1:05:32] us that in the church age book it works
[1:05:34] it's not a good defense because the
[1:05:37] bride sometimes don't look like it works
[1:05:39] but god's word always works
[1:05:42] amen didn't look like israel had the
[1:05:44] best system of governance but god said
[1:05:46] it's mine
[1:05:47] that's the way i want it amen hey man
[1:05:51] he's still with me tonight
[1:05:54] we find out in mark chapter seven we'll
[1:05:55] read this and we'll
[1:05:58] get ready for communion mark chapter
[1:06:01] seven
[1:06:01] verse five there's a group called the
[1:06:03] pharisees and scribes and they asked
[1:06:04] jesus why walk
[1:06:06] not thy disciples according to the
[1:06:07] tradition of the elders
[1:06:09] eat bread with unwashing hands
[1:06:12] why did they not do our traditions
[1:06:17] you know the pharisees were better off
[1:06:19] to wash their hands it's always good to
[1:06:21] wash your hands
[1:06:22] but it's not the word
[1:06:26] right i'd rather go to the church that
[1:06:28] washed your hands and didn't
[1:06:32] right much rather
[1:06:37] but it's not in the word
[1:06:41] right it's not a commandment and so the
[1:06:43] disciples just grabbed corn and ate it
[1:06:44] didn't wash their hands and
[1:06:46] and he answered and said to them you
[1:06:48] know it's just a question but there's
[1:06:50] something about it he knows the secret
[1:06:51] of the heart he knows why you asked the
[1:06:53] question
[1:06:54] and jesus come on really strong he
[1:06:55] answered and said to them well
[1:06:57] is that well isaiah prophesied of you
[1:07:00] hypocrites
[1:07:01] and since written this people honoreth
[1:07:02] me with their lips but their heart is
[1:07:04] far from me
[1:07:05] i'll be it in vain do they worship me
[1:07:07] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:07:09] of men
[1:07:11] idol worship idolatry
[1:07:15] in the form of religion but they made it
[1:07:17] out of the message
[1:07:19] they made it out of moses message so it
[1:07:20] must be true
[1:07:22] but that's where exactly where it is
[1:07:24] it's out of the message
[1:07:26] because it's not even what moses said
[1:07:29] now look he said for laying aside the
[1:07:32] commandment of god you hold the
[1:07:33] tradition of men
[1:07:35] it's the washing of pots and cups and
[1:07:37] many other such like things you do
[1:07:39] he said unto them full well you reject
[1:07:41] the commandment of god that you may keep
[1:07:42] your own tradition
[1:07:44] and they'll fight you over their
[1:07:45] tradition something you can't back up
[1:07:49] on the word at all but a man will
[1:07:52] separate from fellowship
[1:07:53] fight people over it have a bitter
[1:07:56] spirit about it
[1:08:00] and it's a tradition something that
[1:08:02] doesn't matter
[1:08:04] be good to wash your hands but it's a
[1:08:06] tradition when it comes to the word for
[1:08:08] moses said
[1:08:10] he gives them an example he said moses
[1:08:11] said honor your father and your mother
[1:08:12] who so curses father mother let him die
[1:08:14] of the death
[1:08:15] but you say if a man shall say to his
[1:08:16] father and mother it is corbyn let us
[1:08:18] say a gift
[1:08:19] so in other words it's dedicated to god
[1:08:22] and so they say we
[1:08:23] it's a gift by whatsoever that might
[1:08:25] just be prophetess by me he should be
[1:08:26] free
[1:08:26] so what they would do is say mom and dad
[1:08:28] i'm tired of taking care of you
[1:08:31] i think a brother uh that's there
[1:08:34] tonight with his mother and
[1:08:35] and brother robert smith and i know it's
[1:08:37] hard sometimes to take care of your
[1:08:39] parents
[1:08:40] it's hard to care for your parents but
[1:08:41] we have responsibilities and
[1:08:43] here he would say it's a gift he said
[1:08:46] whatever you you want of mine i'll give
[1:08:48] it to you but then we're done
[1:08:50] huh what whatsoever thou might just be
[1:08:53] prophetess by me you can you can have
[1:08:54] the car you can have the house i'll buy
[1:08:55] you a house
[1:08:56] but no more
[1:09:00] and he said what they would do is you
[1:09:02] suffer him no more to do ought for his
[1:09:04] father his mother he's done that's it
[1:09:05] that's all he has to do
[1:09:07] he said you made the word of god of none
[1:09:08] effect through your tradition
[1:09:11] because the the purpose of moses saying
[1:09:14] on your father and mother was not so you
[1:09:15] could
[1:09:16] set them up financially and then leave
[1:09:18] them
[1:09:20] it was all through life
[1:09:24] god forbid that we would take this
[1:09:27] glorious message that we have
[1:09:31] and reduce it down to a set of
[1:09:32] traditions
[1:09:35] if you don't like it the way if you
[1:09:37] don't like how we do it then we just
[1:09:38] won't have no fellowship with you at all
[1:09:42] unless you do this and hear this
[1:09:44] preacher
[1:09:45] or follow this man or or have your
[1:09:47] service in a certain way
[1:09:49] you aren't in the message it doesn't
[1:09:51] come from the word
[1:09:56] does it come from the word you see god
[1:09:58] wants you for an image
[1:10:01] god don't want you to make an idol he
[1:10:03] wants you
[1:10:04] he wants me you're god's letter a
[1:10:07] written epistle god is in you
[1:10:09] manifesting himself through he don't
[1:10:12] want all your
[1:10:13] all your stuff but he said heaven is my
[1:10:15] throne earth is my footstool what house
[1:10:16] will you build me saith the lord what is
[1:10:18] the place on my wrist brother branham
[1:10:19] says
[1:10:20] you're god's letter he said if you can
[1:10:22] prostrate yourself before god and say
[1:10:24] god i'm a sinner come into me
[1:10:26] and then the holy spirit comes in and
[1:10:28] then you're a living idol of god
[1:10:30] a living representative of god walking
[1:10:32] around with god speaking through your
[1:10:34] lips
[1:10:35] to others that's what god wants
[1:10:39] paul speaks to the thessalonians he said
[1:10:40] for from you sounded out
[1:10:42] word of the lord not only in macedonia
[1:10:44] nakaya but also in every place your
[1:10:46] faith to god were to spread abroad
[1:10:48] so that we need not to speak anything he
[1:10:51] said we don't even have to
[1:10:52] tell the people about the gospel he said
[1:10:54] for they themselves show of us what
[1:10:56] manner of entering in we had unto you
[1:10:57] how you turn
[1:10:58] to god from idols to serve the living
[1:11:01] and true god
[1:11:03] it ought to be the testimony of your
[1:11:04] life you become the idol
[1:11:07] you become the image not an image you
[1:11:10] made
[1:11:11] but an image you live out how can you do
[1:11:14] that prostrate yourself before god
[1:11:17] not an idol but before god you lay
[1:11:19] before god
[1:11:20] you say god whatever you want to speak i
[1:11:22] want you to speak it
[1:11:24] whatever you have for me whatever part
[1:11:26] of the word i don't want tradition
[1:11:28] lord help me not to let this spirit of
[1:11:30] tradition come on me to the point where
[1:11:31] i dis-fellowship somebody
[1:11:33] because they don't do it my way
[1:11:38] we could talk about idols all over the
[1:11:39] place but i think this one hits close to
[1:11:41] home
[1:11:42] i know it does for me god help me
[1:11:45] that i can stay true to the word
[1:11:50] if god if god says it let me say it
[1:11:54] and then i know if i get in trouble
[1:11:56] he'll back me up on it
[1:11:59] i can take such a sure stand on god's
[1:12:01] word that if they say i'm going to throw
[1:12:03] you in the fire
[1:12:04] i'll say whatever you do god is able to
[1:12:06] deliver me but if he doesn't i'm not
[1:12:08] going to bow to your image
[1:12:10] i can take that strong stand on the word
[1:12:12] why because it is the word
[1:12:17] i can't take those stands on my own
[1:12:19] thoughts
[1:12:20] what i've imagined to be true
[1:12:24] would you bow your heads with me
[1:12:26] brothers if you come and
[1:12:27] prepare for communion
[1:12:30] if i could have a piano and organ player
[1:12:36] let's just talk to the lord for a minute
[1:12:38] i i know it's been cut up and i was
[1:12:40] nervous
[1:12:42] i don't like to make drag out these
[1:12:44] communion services
[1:12:47] i don't want to sound harsh ever god
[1:12:50] help me if i do that
[1:12:52] but we got to reach a point where we're
[1:12:55] just surrendered to the word
[1:12:57] i don't i do what i do because
[1:13:01] i know god said do it and i love to do
[1:13:03] what god says
[1:13:05] it just means so much to me to make him
[1:13:07] happy to please him
[1:13:10] i know it would please him some people
[1:13:12] don't get baptized because they got some
[1:13:14] hang up or something but
[1:13:15] if it would please him
[1:13:19] for me to go under the water
[1:13:22] be baptized in the name of the lord
[1:13:24] jesus christ i'll do it lord
[1:13:27] if that's what you said if that's
[1:13:28] what'll make you happy
[1:13:32] if that's according to your word i'll do
[1:13:34] it
[1:13:35] if you can show me in the word
[1:13:39] i'm willing to be shown in the word if
[1:13:41] you can show me in the word where
[1:13:42] something that i preach something that i
[1:13:44] believe something i've taught is wrong
[1:13:46] show it to me i want to know i really do
[1:13:48] church i want to know if it's right
[1:13:52] we examine ourselves by the word not by
[1:13:54] what we think
[1:13:56] not by what we imagine
[1:13:59] not by our feelings whether we get our
[1:14:02] feelings hurt or not
[1:14:03] we don't go by that examine yourself by
[1:14:05] the word tonight
[1:14:07] lord you want me to take communion i'll
[1:14:10] do it lord
[1:14:12] may not make much sense to me but i'll
[1:14:14] do it you want me to wash someone's feet
[1:14:17] you said do it lord the church world
[1:14:19] don't do it today
[1:14:21] we still do why because god said you'll
[1:14:24] be happy if you do this
[1:14:27] we're bound to the word love slaves to
[1:14:29] god's word
[1:14:33] let's just examine ourselves for a
[1:14:34] moment and speak to the
[1:14:36] author of the word the word himself
[1:14:39] and just ask him to come and
[1:14:42] make any idol that we've set up anything
[1:14:46] that we've started to
[1:14:48] give more prominence than we give to the
[1:14:50] word let it be torn down in our lives
[1:14:53] heavenly father lord jesus we ask you to
[1:14:57] come and
[1:14:59] we thank you for the presence lord your
[1:15:01] presence that we feel here
[1:15:03] in this place i pray god
[1:15:07] as we examine ourselves tonight
[1:15:10] or it's we know we don't smoke and drink
[1:15:14] and steal and lie and run around with
[1:15:15] women we know better than that
[1:15:19] so many times just in the actions and
[1:15:21] the attitudes of our lives
[1:15:24] we make everything else so important

[1:17:00] but they had a pillar of fire they had a
[1:17:04] brass serpent they had healing in the
[1:17:05] camp the shadow of the king was there

[1:17:24] [Music]

[1:17:27] communion may it be just a time
[1:17:29] renewal in our lives something that just
[1:17:32] just rejuvenates us father and
[1:17:34] brings us closer to you we pray in jesus
[1:17:37] name
[1:17:38] amen let's sing this together oh
[1:17:43] how he loves you
[1:17:46] and me thank you lord
[1:17:51] singing he
[1:17:54] loves you and me
[1:18:02] oh he gave his life
[1:18:07] what more could he
[1:18:10] give oh
[1:18:26] loves you and me
[1:18:31] let's read first corinthians chapter 11
[1:18:34] and verse 23
[1:18:36] for i have received of the lord that
[1:18:38] which also i delivered unto you
[1:18:40] and the lord jesus the same night in
[1:18:42] which he was betrayed took bread
[1:18:44] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:18:46] said take eat this is my body
[1:18:48] which is broken for you this is due in
[1:18:51] remembrance of me
[1:18:53] after the same manner also he took the
[1:18:55] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:18:56] is the new testament in my blood this do
[1:18:58] ye
[1:18:59] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:19:01] of me for as
[1:19:02] often as you eat this bread and drink
[1:19:04] this cup you do show the lord's death
[1:19:06] till he come
[1:19:07] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:19:09] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:19:10] unworthily
[1:19:11] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:19:13] the lord let a man examine himself and
[1:19:15] so let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:19:17] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:19:18] drinketh unworthily
[1:19:20] he hath the drink of damnation to
[1:19:21] himself not discerning the lord's body
[1:19:24] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:19:25] among you and many sleep
[1:19:27] for if we would judge ourselves we
[1:19:29] should not be judged
[1:19:30] when we are judged we are chastened of
[1:19:32] the lord that we should not be condemned
[1:19:34] with the world
[1:19:35] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:19:36] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:19:39] and if any man hunger let him eat at
[1:19:40] home that you come not together into
[1:19:42] condemnation
[1:19:44] and the rest will i set an order when i
[1:19:48] come
[1:19:58] lord jesus i hold in my hands the bread
[1:20:01] father which represents your broken body
[1:20:03] i pray god that you would bless it
[1:20:06] lord and as this church lord partakes of
[1:20:09] the bread
[1:20:10] i pray god that in the spiritual realm
[1:20:13] that you'd cause us to come that much
[1:20:14] more closely together
[1:20:16] you were broken so that we could be
[1:20:18] whole and we thank you for that
[1:20:20] in jesus name amen
[1:20:24] lord jesus for the wine i pray lord that
[1:20:27] you would come and that you would take
[1:20:28] us
[1:20:29] lord as the elements pass through our
[1:20:31] bodies lord we know there's nothing in
[1:20:33] the element itself
[1:20:34] but in the act of taking in this act of
[1:20:36] obedience to your word
[1:20:38] lord and we know that there's healing
[1:20:39] lord as the elements pass through the
[1:20:41] body may there be a
[1:20:42] healing take place if there's one sick
[1:20:44] person here today that there would not
[1:20:46] be one when we leave
[1:20:47] i pray that you would grant it today we
[1:20:49] believe your word
[1:20:50] lord and we do it according to your word
[1:20:52] in jesus name
