[5:42] being faithful let's have a word of
[5:43] Prayer I know that there's several needs
[5:45] that have been represented and we've
[5:48] know about those and we want to continue
[5:51] to pray for the ministry brother Ron
[5:52] Spencer brother Joel Forney different
[5:56] ones that are dealing with physical
[5:57] problems and their bodies and let's be
[6:00] praying for them and for each one in our

[6:03] spiritual needs I I'm just praying that
[6:05] God will meet those needs tonight let's
[6:07] bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank
[6:09] you Lord for allowing us to come here
[6:11] together one more time again father and
[6:15] even though together and in this case is
[6:17] online I thank you for allowing us to do
[6:20] this we wouldn't have been able to do it
[6:22] before and so we're grateful for what we
[6:24] have and and looking forward to the time
[6:26] when we can be physically present with
[6:28] one another again thank you for this
[6:30] church I pray you bless them Lord heal
[6:32] them Father and touch their bodies where
[6:34] they have needs tonight maybe if they're
[6:36] listening just to the Word of God
[6:37] tonight and and reading along and
[6:39] marking their Bibles God just as that
[6:41] happens may your word just sink down
[6:43] into their hearts and and somehow bring
[6:46] healing and and faith in their heart we
[6:48] pray I pray father that you would help
[6:50] me tonight to say the things that I need
[6:52] to say clearly and nothing else as we go
[6:55] through this teaching I pray father that
[6:57] you would bless brother Ron Spencer
[6:59] brother Joel Forney and these ministers
[7:01] Lord that have labored and for the bride
[7:03] I pray that you would just bring healing
[7:05] to their bodies completely if we know
[7:07] many have prayed and father I pray that
[7:09] you just continue to heal them and bless
[7:11] them thank you for all that you do we
[7:14] ask you to bless this time we have
[7:15] together in Jesus name Amen
[7:18] all right we're reading from 1st
[7:21] Corinthians chapter 1 I wanted to go
[7:25] over a little bit what we talked about
[7:27] last time
[7:28] I'll try to go slowly enough and and not
[7:32] get too excited so that we can treat
[7:36] this as a Bible study last time we
[7:40] reviewed verses 10 through 16 of chapter
[7:42] one we found that Paul begged the church
[7:46] to speak the same thing to speak with
[7:50] one voice and to have one one spoken
[7:55] word about what they believed and that's
[7:58] important for us as well when we may
[8:00] have different opinions he never asked
[8:02] for that they would all be or all have
[8:06] the same private opinions but that they
[8:08] would all be the same mind and speak the
[8:09] same thing and that's what's important
[8:12] when it comes to the big things we need
[8:13] to speak the same thing he asked there
[8:16] would be no systems schisms rather in
[8:18] the body and the schism as we found was
[8:20] a medical term that means that there's
[8:23] not a part of the body that's not
[8:25] working so we want to make sure that all
[8:28] of the body is working well because if
[8:31] there's a part that's messed up if
[8:32] there's a part that doesn't work well
[8:33] with the rest of the body then that part
[8:36] will actually be a schism and it'll
[8:39] it'll totally separate itself from the
[8:41] body so that's what he was talking about
[8:43] here with all of these different ideas
[8:44] and doctrines that they had we found
[8:48] that the parties of Paul apalla speeder
[8:52] and Christ were equally wrong and that's
[8:55] an amazing statement in itself to think
[8:59] that someone could call themselves by
[9:01] the name of Christ
[9:02] it could call themselves by the name of
[9:05] Paul or Apollo's and Peter all of them
[9:08] being truth are preaching the truth but
[9:12] yet the people that followed the parties
[9:14] that formed around their names were
[9:16] equally wrong because they used it for
[9:18] division instead of to bring unity to
[9:21] the to the believers and we also found
[9:24] out that messengers are not infallible
[9:26] but God is now on the the parties of
[9:31] Paula Paula speeder in Christ I want you
[9:33] to kind of follow that because you'll
[9:34] find out as we go through the book of
[9:36] first Corinthians that Paul deals with
[9:38] each of these problems the party of Paul
[9:41] though
[9:42] would elevate his ministry above
[9:45] everything else he talks about how that
[9:46] we shouldn't baptize he was glad he
[9:49] didn't baptize more we deal he deals
[9:53] with the party of a Polish those who
[9:55] elevated wisdom and the ability to speak
[9:58] above everything else the ability to be
[10:01] an orator and Paul hammers that as
[10:04] that's not what we look at but we look
[10:06] at the word that's broad the preaching
[10:08] of the Cross we'll deal with that
[10:09] tonight and then the party of Peter who
[10:12] was Judaizers who took that opportunity
[10:15] to try to bring the law back in and and
[10:18] the party that said they were of Christ
[10:20] who may be separated themselves from the
[10:21] body and said well we just won't deal
[10:23] with any of it and but they were equally
[10:25] wrong but he deals with all of those as
[10:28] we go down through the book of 1st
[10:29] Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1:17 I'll
[10:33] start there for Christ sent me not to
[10:36] baptize but to preach the gospel what a
[10:39] striking statement he says not with
[10:42] wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ
[10:45] should be made of none effect so he
[10:50] tells us very clearly we are not saved
[10:52] by baptism alone
[10:55] that's that next slide Esther we are not
[10:56] saved by baptism alone 1st Peter 3:21
[11:00] tells us that the like figure we're in -
[11:02] even baptism doth also now save us not
[11:06] the putting away of the filth of the
[11:07] flesh but the answer of a good
[11:09] conscience toward God so we if we are
[11:12] obedient we have a right to the promises
[11:14] of God and being saved and receiving the
[11:17] Holy Ghost
[11:17] you know baptism is obedience that's the
[11:20] answer of a good conscience but it's not
[11:21] the baptism itself that saves us or
[11:23] regenerates us he says it's the answer
[11:26] of a good conscience toward God and on
[11:28] the wings of a snow-white does but the
[11:29] Branum deals with that and you'll find
[11:31] many other places and the message where
[11:33] he deals with this as well this is a
[11:36] 1965 he said like I could go up here
[11:38] take each one of you and baptize you in
[11:41] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:42] that won't remit your sins no no no I
[11:47] don't believe in water baptism in the
[11:49] name of Jesus Christ unto regeneration
[11:51] and that's where he was very different
[11:53] from the UPC church
[11:55] who taught water baptism under
[11:57] regeneration he said I believe the blood
[12:00] is regeneration see not the water but
[12:02] see I could baptize and baptize but you
[12:05] only go down to dry sinner and come up a
[12:07] wet one see until you have thoroughly
[12:10] repented repent and then be baptized in
[12:14] the name of Jesus Christ so Paul says
[12:17] Christ sent me not to baptize and he
[12:20] says but he did send me for this
[12:22] he sent me to preach the gospel to
[12:26] preach the gospel what does it mean to
[12:30] preach the gospel mark chapter 16 and
[12:33] verse 15 Jesus speaks to the disciples
[12:37] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[12:39] world and preach the gospel to every
[12:42] creature preached the gospel that word
[12:46] preaches to bring good news this is on
[12:48] the next slide to bring good news to
[12:50] announce glad tidings it's used in the
[12:54] Old Testament of any kind of good news
[12:56] is the joyful tidings of God's kindness
[12:59] particular the Messianic blessings so
[13:02] they would have already understood that
[13:04] what this word meant even before Christ
[13:07] come there was a Greek word but it was
[13:09] spoke of the Messiah
[13:11] it was glad tidings to proclaim glad
[13:15] tidings a preacher would be a herald it
[13:18] would be somebody who speaks and which
[13:20] makes sense but it's somebody who
[13:21] carries a message and also to instruct
[13:24] men concerning the things that pertain
[13:26] to Christian salvation and brother
[13:29] branham differentiates that from just
[13:31] lecturing or teaching which was what
[13:35] we're doing tonight there's a place for
[13:36] teaching there's a place for going
[13:40] through the things of God slowly and and
[13:42] sanely and making sure that we have
[13:44] everything the way that it should be but
[13:47] yeah that's not preaching the gospel not
[13:48] in the way that brother Branham saw it
[13:50] he said are you lecturing but jesus
[13:54] never said go into all the world and
[13:56] teach this or teach that and you'll find
[13:58] again but the rhythm says it's over and
[13:59] over again so it's not an isolated quote
[14:02] he said go into all the world and preach
[14:05] the gospel preach is to demonstrate the
[14:08] power of the
[14:08] holy spirit' these signs shall follow
[14:11] them now there are teachers again on the
[14:13] fivefold ministry and there are part of
[14:15] a pastors job is to teach part of a
[14:17] apostles job is to teach obviously a
[14:20] teacher's job is to teach but it's not
[14:23] just lecturing even even when a pastor
[14:25] teaches or or an apostle would teach a
[14:30] prophet would teach it's not just
[14:31] lecturing but it's inspired Jesus never
[14:34] said go into all the world and teach
[14:35] this or teach that he said go into all
[14:37] the world and preach the gospel he says
[14:39] this and again over and over he said
[14:41] preach is to demonstrate the power of
[14:44] the Holy Spirit these signs shall follow
[14:47] them don't come by lecture that's right
[14:50] he said see that believe it doesn't come
[14:53] by lectures it comes by the presence of
[14:56] the Living God
[14:57] notice this moving among in human flesh
[15:01] proving himself that he's the same
[15:04] yesterday today and forever did you
[15:07] catch that the presence of the Living
[15:09] God moving among in human flesh proving
[15:12] himself that he's the same yesterday
[15:13] today and forever that's why we have to
[15:16] have live preaching today he said he
[15:18] never fails to be the same it comes so
[15:21] simple the simplicity of it is what
[15:24] drives the intellectual mind away from
[15:26] it so preaching and on the next slide
[15:30] preaching is number one declaring the
[15:33] good news contained in the scriptures
[15:35] number two demonstrating the power of
[15:38] that good news well I'm so grateful that
[15:41] God still does that today first Peter
[15:46] 4:11 tells us and we've read this
[15:48] several times lately but just to bring
[15:50] it back to our memory and dealing with
[15:51] preaching the word said if any man speak
[15:54] let him speak as the Oracles of God as
[15:56] if God came into his body spoke through
[15:59] him because that's what the Word of God
[16:01] is if any man minister let him do it as
[16:04] of the ability which God giveth that God
[16:06] in all things may be glorified through
[16:08] Jesus Christ to whom he praise and
[16:10] Dominion for ever and ever amen so he
[16:14] says I came to preach but not just to
[16:17] preach anyway and here he's dealing with
[16:19] the party of a Paulist that elevated or
[16:22] taury and the ability to speak or the
[16:24] ability to teach above everything else
[16:28] and he said not with wisdom of words not
[16:34] with wisdom of words Christ did not send
[16:36] me to baptize but to preach and this is
[16:38] how I preach not with the wisdom of
[16:40] words and Matthew Henry I believe this
[16:44] says says it this way he says the
[16:45] flourish of oratory or the accuracies a
[16:48] philosophical language upon which the
[16:51] Greek so much prided themselves and
[16:53] which seemed to have been the peculiar
[16:55] recommendations of some of the heads of
[16:56] the faction in this church that most
[16:58] opposed this apostle he said he did not
[17:01] preach the gospel in this manner so he
[17:04] said I did not come with wisdom of words
[17:05] and I did that on purpose not because I
[17:08] couldn't but because I didn't want to
[17:11] take away from the cross of Christ so he
[17:13] said lest the cross of Christ should be
[17:15] of no effect lest a success should be
[17:17] ascribed to the force of art and not of
[17:21] truth and people can do that with a
[17:23] person who's a very good speaker a very
[17:26] good teacher if they attribute the
[17:28] success of the ministry to that that's a
[17:31] problem also they can do it on the other
[17:34] side where someone is very emotional
[17:36] they can attribute the success of the
[17:37] ministry to that that's not what it is
[17:39] it's what's preached what is being
[17:42] preached and Paul says I didn't come
[17:44] with wisdom of words so that you can be
[17:46] elevated in your mind but I preached
[17:48] Christ well he says not this Matthew
[17:52] Henry again not to the plain doctrine of
[17:54] a crucified Jesus but to the powerful
[17:55] oratory of those who spread it and here
[17:58] by the honor of the Cross be diminished
[18:00] or eclipsed and I like the way you put
[18:04] this he said this truth needed no
[18:06] artificial dress it shone out with the
[18:10] greatest Majesty in its own light and
[18:13] prevailed in the world by its divine
[18:15] authority and the demonstration of the
[18:18] Spirit without any human helps the plain
[18:21] preaching of a crucified Jesus was more
[18:25] powerful than all the oratory and
[18:26] philosophy of the heathen world
[18:29] well I still believe that today 1st
[18:32] Corinthians 1:18 Paul continues his
[18:34] thought he says for the preaching
[18:36] the Cross is to them that perish
[18:38] foolishness but unto us which are saved
[18:42] it is the power of God so Paul sets up
[18:45] this difference between those who are
[18:48] saved and how that we react to the
[18:50] preaching of the Cross if we are saved
[18:52] it is the power of God to those who
[18:56] perish it is foolishness couldn't be
[18:59] more of a stark contrast than that it's
[19:03] foolishness or the power of God it
[19:05] depends on how you look at the preaching
[19:07] of the Cross brother Branham in the
[19:11] paradox illustrate says he says it was a
[19:13] real paradox when God shows the
[19:15] foolishness of inspired preaching notice
[19:19] that the foolishness of inspired
[19:21] preaching that's not lecturing that's
[19:24] not playing someone else's sermon but
[19:26] inspired preaching he said instead of
[19:29] high-polished theology a man that don't
[19:32] know hardly use hid ain't tote fetch
[19:35] carry all such words and sad and say all
[19:38] kinds of things out of his grammar and
[19:40] ungrazed and everything else like that
[19:42] God chose that instead of taking the
[19:45] great scholarly polished who could
[19:48] really pronounce the words and say it
[19:50] just right but it pleased God to take
[19:53] the foolishness again of inspired
[19:56] preaching some little old plough boy
[19:59] don't know his ABCs take that man and
[20:02] win souls by him when deceivers all
[20:05] polished up just leading the blind
[20:08] leading the blind he said it's the real
[20:10] paradox deceived Church by the world but
[20:14] the Branham talks about how that we
[20:16] can't take the things from the world and
[20:17] just necessarily make the success of
[20:19] that in the church just because they're
[20:22] successful in the world and I'll just
[20:24] read it the way he said it he said men
[20:26] want to be like they compare or to copy
[20:29] after go like the world does say the
[20:32] things that they do make a success the
[20:34] way they were a success he says we can
[20:37] never be a success doing anything the
[20:42] world does we can only be a success as
[20:45] we follow after God's statutes and his
[20:47] way of doing things oh don't you want to
[20:50] do
[20:50] the way God wants to do them that should
[20:53] be all of our desires we should never
[20:55] want to do anything like the world does
[20:57] it but to do it like God does it that
[21:00] should be every one of our desires today
[21:06] excuse me I checked them the streams to
[21:10] make sure it was working so we want to
[21:13] do things like God does he says we can
[21:18] never be by patterning after the world
[21:20] if the cigarette company has met their
[21:21] greatest success by television the beer
[21:23] and the whiskey crowds has made their
[21:25] great success through the contribution
[21:26] of television that's no sign that the
[21:28] church will make it success by
[21:29] television what a night for me to be
[21:31] talking about this because we're
[21:34] exclusively on the internet tonight but
[21:36] you know the internet is not where the
[21:39] success is just because it is for the
[21:41] world but the success is in the inspired
[21:43] preaching of the Cross I hope you're
[21:46] following along but the random says the
[21:49] success of the church lies within the
[21:52] preaching of the gospel of the power of
[21:55] God and the demonstration of the Spirit
[21:57] we cannot say because that television
[22:00] done such-and-such for the cigarette
[22:02] company other companies said we do not
[22:04] have any scripture to try to compare
[22:05] with them people as long as we do make
[22:08] we may draw great numbers of people but
[22:10] that's not what God ordained us to do
[22:13] and the truth is we have to make sure
[22:16] that we're not just doing it because the
[22:18] world does it and and that's what they
[22:21] were doing with with Paul that's what
[22:23] they did with the Pala say said with
[22:25] Apollo's we have as great a speaker as
[22:27] they ask the Greeks have surely we could
[22:31] attract more people with that kind of
[22:32] oratory and Paul said I purposely come
[22:35] to you and did not preach that way
[22:36] because I didn't want to take away from
[22:38] the cross of Christ so brother Brown
[22:41] says we think that because we're all
[22:43] colours flying high great organizations
[22:45] causing great colorful things to take
[22:47] place that it's a success he said we are
[22:51] dying daily on our feet spiritually
[22:53] speaking if we stood 10 million strong
[22:56] this morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't
[22:58] with us we do well to stand 10 strong
[23:01] with the Holy Spirit with us we
[23:03] cannot compare with the world and I
[23:07] trust that we know that tonight first
[23:09] Corinthians
[23:10] 1:19 he says for it is written I will
[23:14] destroy the wisdom of the wise and will
[23:17] bring to nothing the understanding of
[23:20] the prudent I say a 2914 is the
[23:25] scripture that Paul is quoting when he
[23:27] says it is written I'll just read it
[23:29] from there as well kind of give us a
[23:31] better background of it he said
[23:33] therefore behold I will proceed to do a
[23:35] marvellous work among this people even a
[23:38] marvelous work and a wonder for the
[23:40] wisdom of their wise men shall perish
[23:41] the understanding of their prudent men
[23:44] shall be hid he's talking about those
[23:47] who would prepare a battle and would set
[23:48] everything up and they would know that
[23:50] they would win they could look at this
[23:51] battle and say these Israelites are not
[23:53] worth much and they don't have a very
[23:55] big army and they would never win this
[23:57] battle he said but I'm gonna set their
[23:59] wisdom to naught I'm going to make the
[24:02] wisdom of their wise men perish and hide
[24:05] the understanding of the prudent men 1st
[24:09] Corinthians 1:20 Paul says where is the
[24:11] wise where is the scribe where is the
[24:14] disputer of this world hath not God made
[24:17] foolish the wisdom of this world
[24:20] I'd say he's done that with the message
[24:22] of the hour wouldn't you has God not
[24:25] that's not God made foolish the wisdom
[24:26] of this world so he speaks of three
[24:29] groups of people or three classes of of
[24:33] people who would have been thought of as
[24:34] smart if we could say it that way in
[24:36] that day in time wise would be the
[24:39] philosophers of that day both the Jews
[24:41] and the Greeks they would also have the
[24:43] scribes or the lawyers those who could
[24:46] go down and quote every little bit of
[24:48] the law or or they could write well or
[24:51] they could they could parcel it out you
[24:53] wouldn't you wouldn't lose them in the
[24:55] law whether that's the the pagan laws or
[24:57] the
[24:57] Jewish law also he spoke speaks of the
[25:02] disputer which would be the mystics the
[25:04] person who can look at it and divine a
[25:07] meaning behind the word so we could look
[25:09] at the look at the scriptures and he
[25:12] could he could think up a conspiracy
[25:14] theory or some reason why
[25:17] that it would be that way and there were
[25:18] more mystics then now it seems like
[25:21] people lean more on science but I think
[25:24] of when I thought of this I thought of a
[25:26] man by the name of jordan peterson who i
[25:28] like to listen to he's a very very good
[25:31] psychologist and he is a great speaker
[25:33] and he's able to deal with young men and
[25:36] help him in their lives and things like
[25:37] that but jordan Peterson has has had
[25:41] some problems in his life and in his own
[25:43] mind mentally and and he's had to deal
[25:46] with in his in his philosophy and these
[25:48] things try to deal with and explain what
[25:50] the Bible means and I feel sorry for him
[25:53] because he understands it's a great book
[25:54] but he doesn't see in atonement he just
[25:56] can't accept that a blood sacrifice was
[25:59] actually made so he tries to see the
[26:02] Bible in this mystical light in this
[26:04] philosopher philosophical light he
[26:07] doesn't understand the atonement I pray
[26:09] that we would never get that way but
[26:11] that we would understand the Bible the
[26:12] way that it was written and meant to be
[26:14] understood and that we would preach the
[26:16] Bible that way and we would preach it
[26:18] with the force of its truth it's
[26:21] actually the truth it's not just a story
[26:25] 1st Corinthians 1:21 for after that he
[26:30] said in the wisdom of God the world by
[26:32] wisdom knew not God so he's saying they
[26:35] had plenty of wisdom down to the ages
[26:37] plenty of smart people much more wisdom
[26:40] in the ancients than theirs today he
[26:43] said but the world by wisdom didn't know
[26:45] God but it pleased God by the
[26:49] foolishness of preaching to save them
[26:52] that belief it pleased God this is the
[26:55] way God wanted it done in perfect faith
[27:00] brother Branham says God uses men and
[27:01] men only you can see they used the word
[27:04] man they're one brother and says man
[27:05] many times he's saying he's meaning men
[27:07] the plural pronounces it man God uses
[27:10] man man only God doesn't use a machinery
[27:13] God doesn't use groups of men God
[27:15] doesn't use organization God uses
[27:18] individuals always so he doesn't even
[27:20] deal with multiple me and he deals with
[27:22] a man God uses man and man only God
[27:28] hiding himself in simplicity than
[27:29] revealing himself in the same
[27:31] he says God won't leave his program it
[27:34] ought to be simple enough for us to
[27:36] understand and this is what Paul's
[27:37] saying Paul saying this is the program
[27:39] of Christ it pleased God by the
[27:42] foolishness of preaching to save them
[27:44] who believe and so brother Branham says
[27:46] God won't leave his program that's the
[27:49] reason we know that this day it's got to
[27:50] be simple see why because he's always
[27:53] been simple before he's always done it
[27:55] simple and so he would be simple today
[27:57] said see now he always works in
[27:59] simplicity but God in the beginning that
[28:02] could have made the son preach the
[28:04] gospel or the wins preached the gospel
[28:05] or an angel preached the gospel but he
[28:09] ordained men for that purpose and he
[28:13] never changes it let that sink down in
[28:16] your heart because people will tell you
[28:17] differently especially as we go through
[28:20] this time when we're not able to be
[28:22] together and people say well it's just
[28:23] as good to be a part and it's not it's
[28:25] not it's not the same and but God still
[28:28] uses men even when we're apart like this
[28:31] God still uses men today he'd knit your
[28:34] name in for that purpose he never
[28:36] changes it he said he never ordained
[28:38] denominations
[28:39] he never ordained groups of men he
[28:42] ordained men to preach the gospel not
[28:44] machinery mechanical devices or any
[28:48] angelic being it was man I'm grateful
[28:53] that he still uses man
[28:54] 1st Corinthians 1:22 so the Jews require
[28:58] a sign the Greeks seek after wisdom the
[29:03] Jews require a sign the Greeks seek
[29:06] after wisdom but we preach Christ
[29:09] crucified unto the Jews a
[29:12] stumbling-block and unto the Greeks
[29:15] foolishness
[29:17] the Jews required a signer brother
[29:19] branham taught us and you go back in the
[29:20] message and look it up but but the
[29:22] random taught us that they did that
[29:24] because they actually had been taught to
[29:29] receive a sign and so he said they
[29:31] received their prophets and they
[29:32] received a sign it was to the Jews
[29:35] though a stumbling block because it
[29:36] wasn't a sign they were looking for
[29:38] they've been taught to receive a sign
[29:41] and still didn't receive the sign of the
[29:44] seiyya he said when they ought to have
[29:47] but to the Greeks he said foolishness
[29:49] the Greeks seek after wisdom the Greeks
[29:52] say AHS nothing to it so the Jews
[29:55] seeking a sign it becomes a stumbling
[29:56] block to the Greeks seeking wisdom it
[29:59] become a foolishness and brother branham
[30:05] speaks of this and again speaking of the
[30:07] difference between the world and the
[30:08] church and there is a difference but the
[30:12] Braun says let's give them something
[30:13] that they haven't got well there's a
[30:16] novel idea isn't it let's give them
[30:20] something they haven't got this is in
[30:21] the greatest newsflash in history in
[30:23] 1961 he said the one thing they don't
[30:26] have is Jesus you think about it today
[30:31] that's the one thing that the world
[30:33] doesn't have they have everything else
[30:35] the world that we live in we have
[30:37] everything we've gone through kind of a
[30:39] hard time lately here in America it
[30:42] seems like that people have just now
[30:45] realized how much we had I know I have
[30:47] we've realized how well-off we are and
[30:51] we've got everything at our fingertips
[30:53] we've got entertainment we've got we've
[30:55] got everything that we could ever ask
[30:57] for and now we had to pull back from
[30:59] some of that and it hurts people to have
[31:02] to pull back why because they have so
[31:04] much but one thing the world doesn't
[31:07] have is Jesus he said don't try to
[31:10] entertain with them you're meeting them
[31:11] on their ground preach Christ let them
[31:15] come on this ground and find out what
[31:16] they got he said if they want to stay in
[31:19] the Garlic land let them stay were we
[31:22] ain't to meet them there he says we're
[31:25] not mimics we're apostles what a
[31:28] powerful statement we're not mimics
[31:31] we're not to come and just because the
[31:33] Greeks do things a certain way that
[31:35] we're going to do things a certain way
[31:36] we're not mimics we're apostles
[31:39] hallelujah he said we're not Apes as
[31:41] they say we are we're sons of God
[31:43] created in His image he said nonsense to
[31:46] that bunch come away from it there's a
[31:49] living Christ he goes on and he says oh
[31:52] they got plenty of psychology
[31:54] philosophical religions and everything
[31:56] oh my
[31:58] they're loaded with that they don't need
[32:01] more philosophy they don't need a
[32:02] message philosophy he said but there's
[32:05] one thing they don't have it's Jesus
[32:08] that's right oh they have entertainment
[32:11] they can make a bigger basketball fuss
[32:14] than you can sure they can they can put
[32:16] men up on the movie screens out there
[32:17] that he said could outs know anything
[32:20] you can do that's right their genius at
[32:23] it their genius at it don't try to
[32:27] compare with them he said didn't Jesus
[32:30] say the children of the world what they
[32:32] are that's right there's one thing they
[32:34] don't have is Jesus that's what we have
[32:40] that's the one thing we have that the
[32:42] world needs so Paul says what I had that
[32:44] you needed was not my education what I
[32:47] had that you needed was not was not my
[32:51] natural force of nature what I had that
[32:55] you needed was Christ
[32:56] so I preached Christ and nothing else
[33:00] first Corinthians 124 so he says he told
[33:04] us that to the Greeks to the Greeks
[33:08] there was there were there was
[33:13] foolishness the gospel was foolishness
[33:15] to the to the Jews they didn't
[33:20] understand it it was a stumbling block
[33:22] but to us I love this but unto them
[33:27] which are called both Jews and Greeks
[33:31] Christ the power of God and the wisdom
[33:37] of God verse 25 because the foolishness
[33:44] of God is wiser than men the weakness of
[33:49] God is stronger than men I'm grateful
[33:51] for that everything's still okay back
[33:55] there
[33:57] I've got Peter and Esther with me again
[34:00] tonight so we're thankful I'm thankful
[34:02] to have them and they're just getting
[34:03] old enough where they're able to help me
[34:05] out and they're running the video and
[34:07] we're just learning how to do some
[34:08] things so
[34:09] I'm closing with this a preacher from
[34:17] the 19th century from around the time of
[34:19] the Civil War said this he said it is
[34:23] not to be thought that this function of
[34:25] the Christian Church has ceased speaking
[34:27] of preaching inspired preaching he said
[34:30] even liberally educated and cultivated
[34:32] sections of society let us look closely
[34:36] and ask is the function of the preacher
[34:40] temporary think about this will it ever
[34:44] pass away he said there is one element
[34:48] belonging distinctively to the preacher
[34:50] which will forever give him a place and
[34:52] function which can never change
[34:54] the bringing of the truth home to men in
[34:59] a living form nothing else can do that
[35:02] but the inspired preaching of the word
[35:05] of God preached Christ he said well I'm
[35:09] not a preacher I don't can't do that
[35:11] well wait a minute but the Branham tells
[35:14] us if you're a preacher preacher sermons
[35:17] but if you're not a preacher he said
[35:18] don't try to preach it live your sermon
[35:21] oh my isn't that something we all should
[35:24] try to do to live our sermon every day
[35:26] and then he said if you're a preacher he
[35:29] said you should preach your sermon and
[35:31] live it too it's a powerful thing to be
[35:35] the truth in a living form and that's
[35:37] something that should challenge us
[35:39] especially as ministers we cannot live
[35:42] something different than we preach
[35:43] because if we live something different
[35:46] than we preach we are no longer a living
[35:48] form and we are replaceable by just a
[35:52] recording or something else when we live
[35:56] what we preach and we are what we say
[35:59] then we are irreplaceable because God
[36:03] wants to do things this way this is the
[36:06] way God shows it pleased God by the
[36:08] foolishness of preaching to save them
[36:10] that belief Benjamin Franklin said this
[36:14] he said the learned fool writes his
[36:18] nonsense in better language than the
[36:20] unlearned
[36:21] but it's still nonsense you know I pray
[36:27] that we would begin to look at the what
[36:29] the people are saying look at what men
[36:32] are saying not what not how they look or
[36:34] how they say it but what did they say
[36:37] did they preach Christ did they preach
[36:41] the word to us or was it just said in a
[36:44] pleasing fashion the learned fool writes
[36:47] his nonsense in better language than the
[36:49] unlearned but it's still nonsense the
[36:52] serpent had a better seemingly better
[36:54] argument than God in the garden but it
[36:57] was nonsense we don't want to follow
[36:59] something like that we'll pick up next
[37:02] time right about then and and we'll have
[37:05] I think probably wanted one more of
[37:07] these hopefully the Lord willing and the
[37:10] state lets us come back together here in
[37:13] a couple weeks we'll be able to be back
[37:15] in the church and I may continue with
[37:16] this or we may pick up something else
[37:18] and then do this at a different time
[37:21] kind of like we're doing now so but I
[37:23] trusted it's been a blessing to you
[37:25] let's bow our heads together for a word
[37:26] of Prayer once again Heavenly Father
[37:29] what an honor to stand behind the desk
[37:32] today and even though I'm teaching
[37:34] tonight and and it's meant to be low-key
[37:37] and and something that we could study in
[37:40] our homes but father I believe that
[37:43] still preaching the Word of God thank
[37:46] you for that honor may I live up to that
[37:48] God and each one that would hear me
[37:49] ministers laypeople alike father may we
[37:54] live up to what we say we may not preach
[37:59] a sermon I may never preach another
[38:01] sermon but let me live a sermon Oh God
[38:05] grant that it would be so I pray once
[38:07] again for every every need as we go to
[38:11] our homes and lay our head on our pillow
[38:14] tonight may we think about these needs
[38:16] that others have not about ourselves but
[38:19] about others and just ask you to come
[38:22] and meet those needs and believe that
[38:23] you will when we wake up in the morning
[38:26] all of these needs will be met
[38:28] pray you grant it now thank you for your
[38:31] word we ask it in Jesus
