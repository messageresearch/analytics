pray you grant it tonight we love you and we thank you for all that you've done ask in Jesus name amen amen thank the Lord if you'll uh turn with me to Genesis chapter 24 Genesis chap 24: 10 I'll try not to hold you real long tonight uh but you young people pay attention I know for some of you this is going to be a little B bit above your uh your age right now but you'll be coming into it soon enough and I want to speak especially to the parents today uh as well because you know we we don't always understand what we should do with our children and to be honest with you I can't tell you everything to do with your children and I don't have all the answers brother the brand said if you find somebody's got all the answers that's a gimmick but we do have the word that we can look to and just Fellowship around these things tonight and I believe that you're all Christians and you wouldn't be here and and uh most we got several of our young people helping with the audio and video tonight so you all uh thank you for doing that and and y'all listen though back here okay but Landon's back there and I see him praise the Lord Buton and uh Esther and Peter so God bless you guys thank you all for being here tonight and U we'll go to Genesis 24:10 it says and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia un the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the City come out to draw water let it come to pass that the damsel to I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master verse 15 it came to pass before he had done speaking you believe God answers prayer before he had done speaking that behold Rebecca came out who was born to bethu son of milka the wife of n or Abraham's brother with her picture upon her shoulder for the Lord would that his Blessing the reading of the word you may be seated over the years our customs and traditions regarding courtship and dating and marriage have changed and uh you're going to find all kinds of different Customs from all kinds of different places I read about a few that in India uh they prohibit a younger brother from marrying before an elder brother so why they wouldn't let you get married before Jason so what they do though if you can't find a bride for the older brother you let the young uh the older brother marry a tree their custom that makes the younger brother free to take a wife the Anglo-Saxons back in the old days they uh in their weddings they that's the Anglo-Saxons were the English people back in the day and and uh what they would do is instead of exchanging Rings they actually passed shoes so the the bride would give her shoes to her to the groom and he took it and hit her on the head with it so that's a strange custom I heard of a Boston sea captain had been gone for three years at Sea and he come back in and and kissed his wife in public on a Sunday and ended up spent two hours in the stalks for that offence that's not the case today is it a uh there's an old Kentucky law it states that a wife can't move Furniture in the house without her husband's permission well I wish that was still the law but a man has restrictions too in Kentucky they say he can't legally marry his wife's grandmother so he's restricted as well just trying to loosen you up a little bit before we get into this in Maryland there's a city ordinance that says that a kiss can't last any longer than one second you know what they do in Siberia when they want to show interest in somebody you know how you do that now I think you younger kids uh Chase each other literally that's not good but when you're going to show interest in somebody in Siberia what they do is they take lice come like in your hair they gather lice and they throw it at them so that shows them they're interested so we won't be doing that in ancient Rome the custom was to break the wedding cake over the head of the bride and you could not be in government office unless that had been done at your wedding law so you know in the message we have our own Customs we do we come up with all kinds of things and and uh uh you know many of them are good and and and I want to say beginning in the beginning that I I I'm I will always uh I will always defer to parents when it comes to their children and what age they allow them to date or or not to date I know we don't call it that but courtship whatever that it is and uh I will say that what age you allow that to happen and things like that that's up to you and you can have certain customs in your home and you should but Customs can change but the word of God abides forever amen and and we look in the scriptures and and begin to see that the Bible doesn't really talk about dating as we would call it today or courting courtship it does give us a few examples of people who got married rebeccca and as but you know not many of us are going to be able to do exactly like uh exactly like was done with Isaac and Rebecca I I would not have trusted my dad to send somebody to find me a wife I'm just come being out there with you uh tonight but maybe some of you would that would be good brother Peter if you just let me do that we'll we'll do it that way uh and then uh uh Esther you have the story of Esther of course she married a a king uh that was not not a what we call a Christian but God did that for such a time as that you know it was for a purpose a reason and then Ruth you find the story of Ruth and and and the way that things were done there of course she had to be redeemed a great type of the Bride uh and I know some of you thinking well maybe the Song of Solomon but let me let me just say this up front The Song of Solomon is for married people so if you if you start using that you know when it comes to when you're just going with somebody or you begin to like somebody you start referring to the Song of Solomon don't do that put that off till you get married there's a lot in there and um anyway that's uh something that you don't want to do now uh so you look at the scriptures and but there's guidelines that are there how we should act and what's appropriate and what we should do I think what's more important than than how is who right and and I find in the message brother Brandon spends a lot more time talking about who we marry not not how we get to that point and it's so it's much more important so I will say this dating or courtship even the way we do it is a modern invention it's not the way it was done in the scripture uh it was more of an arranged thing or it's done very very differently than what the way we do it today yet I believe God works in Us in in the way we do things and I believe God allows that and and works in that and I'm so glad God led me to my wife and led my you married people you say praise God you know that that God puts you together and there there was not another person on the earth that could have put up with Jo way but Joanna way but God put you together and uh and so you and you look back and think well there are others that could have this could have happened or that could have happened but God puts you together and and so it it's so important that he did that and we thank God for that so we we say there's somebody brother Cale put it so eloquently earlier he said there's a I think he said there's a lid for every poch you know and there there's just a there's a place for you some somewhere where you fit there's a there's a husband for you a wife for you but you need to wait on the Lord and and let the Lord take charge of your life you just fall in love with Jesus as much as you can and and God will make sure the right one shows up so but we had a did have a prophit and day gives us some guidelines as well especially on the relationships which is what I want to dwell on more today between unmarried young men and women and and here in the church and uh some guidelines for scriptural relationships number one I'll say this when you begin to like somebody you need to respect the family Rules you need to respect her dad he's invested a lot of time a lot of effort in that gr it's pride and joy it's the apple of his eye respect the dad that's so important and the mom as well respect that couple and their family Rules and uh and I will say this there needs to be rules yes and I want talk to parents for a minute because the Bible tells us to train up a child in the way he should go when he's old he won't depart from it the training part is ours to do nobody else is going to do it we were given children for that purpose we're the ones that set the rules so a lot of trouble in teenage years or later years could be avoided if we had corrected our children when they were young someone said amen so we we don't the Bible tells us don't withhold correction from the child that if you beat him with the rod he shall not die cover your ears kids you know that's what the Bible says if you beat him with they're literally doing that thank you you can uncover them now for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die now look a young man or woman should completely obey the rules parents set but the parents got to set the rules and you need to teach your children to do that I will say this if you can't obey a parent's rule stay away oh you you need to obey the rules especially in a child a girl or boy that's underage you guys need to abide by the rules and but it's a parent's responsibility to set those rules and provide consequences if they're broken so brother brandom says this he said to face up to responsibility sometimes it takes the hide off of us to do that as a father to face up responsibility give your child a whiping little fellas you don't want to do that but as a father or mother you've got to face the responsibility of raising that child cu the Bible said spare the rod you'll spoil your son he said that still stands good in the sight of every psychologist there is in the world he said that Still Remains God's truth it's still the truth no matter what message mama says and some you know what I'm talking about if there had been more of that practice he said we wouldn't have had so much juvenile delinquency and stuff and the rot we got in the world today amen brand talked about the ignorance of Kentucky and about those people that he said what does this have to do with dating we have have a lot less trouble with dating if we take care of the kids now begin to establish boundaries in their lives um he said sometimes they talk about ignorance in Kentucky he said let one of their daughters come in the morning with her hair all twisted up manicure over her face he said makeup on her face all night long some little Ricky with a flat top haircut he said I tell you she'll she'll know the next time she goes out a barrel slat or limb off a hickory that just skin her down I said I tell you you're talking about juvenile delinquency so many papers talking about I think it's parent delinquency said if you were to have the old Golden Rule hanging a wall with them Ten Commandments hanging on it take a young out there and Shu him down a little bit you wouldn't have so much and saying poor little Ricky you're nice he didn't mean to do bad Martha he said she needs a good beating is what she needs that's a prophet said that not me Bible say spare the rod you spoil your child that's exactly right you'll never find anything any better now I'll say this how many of you didn't understand the rules maybe I won't take a show hands I did not understand all the rules that we had and they didn't make any sense they changed from person to person child to child I got some agreement back there it's like we just did not understand what the rules were and I think it's respons we're responsible as parents to make sure the rules are few and clear right because we don't want to overburden our children and make them feel like they're in a jail and it's not what we want to but we want them to have freedom we want them to know that we trust them and yet we recognize they're kids and they could get in trouble so don't make rules that make no sense or that change from person to person or day to day or unfair arbitrary impossible to carry out or that you wouldn't do yourself right we don't want to be Pharisees to our children our children know us don't they right they know who we are and what we are how we live so we don't want to be a Pharisee brother the Bible says that the Pharisees I think this is going out on me the Bible said the Pharisees bind heavy burdens and Grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they won't touch won't move one of them with their fingers we don't want to be like that so you have to know then and I want to on the other side of this discipline thing you got to set rules but you got to know when to commit your children to God and I know adult you know adult children their parents have never figured out that they need to commit their children to God and leave them alone let them be adults let them be a married couple don't intervene in their private life don't need to do that wrong so you have to know when to commit them to God uh brother talked about Rebecca now at this time she was 18 years old so she's older but he said she was 18 years old he he talked about how that she went out and played that music Boogie wogie music he called it and and all of those things and you talking about how it just killed him you know and she went sass her mother and almost knocked the things off the wall went to school he said no I ought to have seemingly just taken my belt off and followed her out in the yard brought her back with a few warps around her he said but I thought wait a minute I got to think 18-year-old thoughts you were a kid once too right I was a kid once so I said mother I know she started crying me just said I know you've done all you can do I've done all I can do now it's out of our hands we have to take the next step they talked for a while and I said to take your hands off she said that's my kid I said isn't it mine too all right if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to God for her Eternal destination why can't we commit her to God now for her Earthly Journey if she was laying there on her deathbed you'd have to commit her to God right you'd have to trust that whatever's been done is enough that you've exposed her to the to the presence of God and put them in church all that you could and that would be enough so if that was the case now they've gotten older they're going to leave home they're going to do if they're 18 they could just leave right so we don't we don't want to kick them out the door we want to keep them under Godly Fellowship as long as we can and I appreciate some of you doing that you parents may maybe your kids don't understand everything but they're and maybe they're adults now but let them be comfortable coming back to home and coming back to the house of God sir we don't want to kick them out and yet there has to be rules so he said he said you can take her he said well that's you're my kid he said it's mine too he said me not say nothing to her I said I never said that we'll quit scolding her and just advise her so your role changes as a parent she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and I were her parents he said these kids today needs a buddy if they had a mother and father would stay home and take care of them instead of out here in a barroom running around all night and things like that wouldn't have juvenile delinquency do we believe that he said if they if they'd spank them when they're little we wouldn't have Junior juvenile delinquency and if they'd stay home and be a buddy to them when they get older we wouldn't have juvenile delinquency okay so moving on what does the message tell us about dating and relationships now look uh brother they asked brother BR what activities should our pre-teen children participate in now these kids up here on the front I think are pre-teens we could call them that but they're not teenagers yet but they want to be that's what a pre-teen is they want to be teenager so it says what activi should we allow them to participate in also how should we go about helping them select their Associates keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can that's our job parents he said if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with a boy and he said see that she keeps with the right kind of a boy discourage her to any boy otherwise or boy to a girl if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa make your home nice make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother into their house right so sometimes you got to make allowances for your children make your home nice well I could live anywhere and I could live out in the woods and with all the junk piled up you might be able to but your kids might be ashamed to bring their company that's right right so make your home nice and make home so happy they'll be pleased in their home to stay there so Mom and Dad aren't fussing all the time right make get someplace where the they feel like their friends are welcome cuz they're safer at your house than somewhere else and and we need to make sure that we don't make so many rules I said that home feels like a jail that's right and their bedroom is the cell that we put them in every night right it's their home too you need to we need to recognize that the Bible tells us again talking to parents it talks to us dad says fathers provoke not your children to anger here's a reason L they be discouraged CU you could discourage your children and I I pray that I haven't done that you know I've I've thought a lot about that there's a couple of things uh that I would do differently and I'm just being open and honest with you tonight there's a couple of things I would do differently uh with my kids and as they've gotten older uh the one thing I would be more encouraging especially to to Peter I'd be more encouraging to to my son I just being honest with you than what I have been and and I've tried to just make him the line and do all those things but I'd be more encouraging if I could do raise him to 16 again he's a fine young man I'd be more encouraging to him if I could and I so I say encourage your kids tell them you love them because it's easy for them to get discouraged that's right and uh the other thing is I wouldn't have given them phones till they were 18 that's not a law or gospel that's just what I would have done Ephesians 6:4 said you father speaking to us dads again provoke not your children to wrath don't pick on them but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord that's the two legs that they have to stand on nurture on one side teaching and admonition correction on the other that I have both don't treat your kids worse than your business associates right your kids shouldn't be shouldn't feel like they've treated worse than people that just random person that comes to the house now talk to as kids again now you getting older some of you guys trip and and Peter and Esther and land and uh Emma I don't want to forget Emma whatever Emma is there's Emma back here I don't mean to call you out but we got a little group and they're all going to camp this year and I'm so happy about that all them kids going to camp and Riley's a little bit older he's kind of kind of stepped up a little bit in that group but but there's a little group of you guys and I'm so happy that you got each other because when we came here my kids didn't have it seemed like anybody and and now you've gotten older and more folks have come and I appreciate that and and you're a little group but you need to know how to treat treat one another you treat your friends honorably if if it's a girl or a boy and opposite sex you need to treat them as they could be someone else's future spouse treat them like you would want someone to treat your future spouse you remember that don't don't get too friendly or too handsy because you need to you need to recognize that uh someday you're you're going to get older and you're going to get married to somebody and it may not be that person treat them right so that when you 20 years when you sit down across a table from them and you see them at Walmart you don't have to run and hide and I'm thankful for that I did have enough teaching in my life that when I went out as a young man I was a preacher and I went out and started liking girls and stuff I never dated anyone but my wife but I I like different ones and stuff and and I think I can honestly say that I acted in a way with them that I I don't have to be uh upset or I don't have to be embarrassed to be around them today I think that's the way it ought to be we ought to keep everything above board now uh when you're you know you're too young you're just too young and that's up to parents as far as ages it's just you can't get married when you're 12 that's just not going to happen and uh and I'll say this you you you never don't ever be alone with and it should shouldn't have to be said but it does never be alone with a person of the opposite sex in a private setting that's not your brother sister mom and Dad right that's just you say well that's too strict that's too strict it every time if you don't set that rule almost every time people get messed up and it's not because you intend to do anything bad or you would even do anything bad this goes for older people too and in my office if I'm going to counsel with you I'm not going to counsel with a husband alone I mean a wife alone without her husband or without my wife being present right that's what we have to do or if I can't if for some reason my wife can't be there I call a deacon I need somebody to be there because it's just not appropriate and most of you know that and some of you don't know you're new but most of you know that I want you to be able to contact me if you're sick or it's an emergency or something like that most of the time we're just having a conversation I'll have a lady in the church that'll they'll tag my wife in the conversation and I'll say this if you ever send me a text she gets it because and and I do that because because I want to I want to be honorable before God and I have to answer for God for the things that I do so it's not just you kids I don't want you to think we're picking on you right because it's it's us too I have to make sure that I hold myself honorably because I could fail too just like anybody else the flesh is still flesh it always will be we need to remember that so brother brandom talked about that he said many times I go to houses and there are women standing out there he said I go to the house knock on the door a sister would come to the door door say come in brother brandom if her husband's not there unless it's a a case of sickness and somebody with me he said I don't go he said and then they call me to a hospital or to a room and say brother brandom come over here I'm sister so and so from so and so here at the hotel I brought my mother along so two women he said she's sick I take my wife if I don't I take some other brother right so he wouldn't even go into a room with two women present by himself he said I think it would be all right for me to go in there but what do some seen me go in there what if somebody seen me do it he said then the first thing you know they would say he went in there where that woman was he's chasing after women see that that would be a thing I shouldn't do see you should never do anything like that he said because you put a stumbling block in somebody else's way he said see I don't believe that I would do anything wrong in there he said I I would and trust God to go in there no matter what the thing was I would trust God he said but yet see I love the Lord well enough till I wouldn't do it that's what it comes down to young people you need to hold yourself accountable because you love God and you don't want to you don't want to bring any kind of a bad accusation against yourself as a Christian or against the church and so you just don't and so that's why we sometimes have chaperon and and people with with kids with uh young teenagers that are dating or going out or courting or whatever you want to call it uh you know when they're going out and we have chaperon for that now I don't say a chaperon is a law right I don't say that's a law that's up to you as a parent but I say it's not good for you to be alone in a private setting you need to have somebody there that can verify especially in this day and age when anybody can say anything about anybody that's right you need to protect yourself and I worry about that with my son I I worry about that with my daughter I I do not want them to get because all it would take is one false accusation ruin their life right and so we want to make sure we do things right as a church and so you do that that's protection for you that's not hard that's protection and so we want to be around people I say be in groups as much as you can be and there will come a time you you have to talk alone but but that'll be down the road but the brandom said see it's a love you have you'll not do it because it's a duty to do it you do it because you love the Lord you don't have to do it but you do it anyhow this is cutting out I'm going to switch but you do it anyway now Paul says this he said are you still with me tonight are we okay he said all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient so in other words there's things that I could do and get by with it but it's it's it's just not expedient it's going to make trouble down the road he said all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any again 1 Corinthians 10:23 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me all things edify not so I need to do the things that edify and and make sure that we stay in that way now I I'll say this slow down slow down and marry the right one I'm aren't again aren't you glad you married the right one you married people slow down and marry the right one you you young kids you don't need to chase boys or chase girls no you're not chasing girls are you Jason no okay just checking you don't need to chase boys you don't need to chase girls you don't need to be jealous of somebody else you know somebody else in the church Allan told me to tell you all this you know so y'all y'all y'all just need to be careful you know uh God will lead you to the right one it'll come probably won't be anybody you know today so just throwing that out there I met my wife because darl Ward preached a service I think I've told you that before up here in Alton Missouri and I went to church so it's a good thing to go to church go to church as often as you can I went to church and met my wife and and I'm so glad that I did but slow down marry the right one God will lead you to the right one don't be influenced by Hollywood don't let a preacher arrange your marriage you got to know that it's right the pastor's not going to know for you I can give you advice but most of the time I don't know I'll just be honest with you I'm always surprised when it works out right so most of the time I don't know but I'm glad I'm happy to give you advice but God will lead you to the right one don't don't let a preacher arrange your marriage you've got a responsibility yourself to find the mind of the Lord and I'll say to those of you just in you know you're just friends and you want to call call yourself a boyfriend or girlfriend jealousy has no place in a friendly relationship just don't let that even even come around or get in your mind today we have virtual relationships and some of you older people don't even know what that is but that's a thing now you know they say you're not you're not really a couple until you uh put it on Facebook and I'll say that doesn't mean anything amen right when you change your relationship status on Facebook it means nothing it has has no level of commitment to it but people watch for that and and I'll say this before you enter a virtual relationship with someone in other words you start texting a lot you need to remember to talk to the parents right and and here's brother Brown talks about that now back in his days is way different okay but back in his day a boy would pull outside the house pull upside the house and blow the horn right and so he said so I I knew better than to stop outside and blow the horn for her to come out cuz her Dad wouldn't have been happy with that right well back then that was the way you know they didn't have text or whatever but he'd blow the horn why he said oh my any Boy hasn't got nerve enough to walk up to the house and knock on the door and ask for the girl ain't got no business being out with her anyhow right I'll say that if you're going to get somebody's number at Youth Camp and you're really interested in that girl you want to talk to her talk to her father and her mother and if you don't you need to be taught better right he said that's exactly right that's so silly really that's cheap now how much of that is my opinion a little bit of it I'll just be honest with you but I think it's pretty much the same thing what you're doing is you're bypassing respect you need to respect believe me if that's going to become your in-laws you really need to respect that person and and so talk to her father if there's no father in the in the situation talk to her mother talk to her pastor if you need to and that'd be a good source to go to the pastor can't put you together but he could he could tell you if there's some red flag something some reason why you shouldn't be doing that so before messaging one another on a regular basis that again that's just a guideline that's not law that's just something that was my thoughts as a dad and a pastor I'll say this far as I'm concerned my kids have no business on social media it's I can't control it how how am I expecting my kids to control it you real I delete my social media accounts like once a week and then I end up having to put a picture on there or something for the church you know and you get back on there and put it on there but you you you scroll too much you look too much on there and just being real and honest with you tonight if I do that I know look at the kids and I know when I was that age I couldn't have controlled it so my kids they have not been underprivileged by not having social media you can do what you want with yours but I it's a trap I I think and we have to remember how to control that little children shouldn't have an Internet connected phone it's just it's a trap and I'll say this if your if your child goes to someone's house they won't obey the rules at someone else's house don't be surprised if they don't ever get invited back because at my house if you have a phone it goes up put up at night so we don't allow our CH even our older children to have their phone at night and U thank the Lord right so they make sure they put those up and that long as they live there I guess that's the way it'll be so you know be careful who they hang out with not everybody calls themselves a a Christian is a Christian right right just because they go to youth camp don't mean they're saved right so we need to be careful who they hang out with that's why I like our children to go as a group because we know at least that they've got people they know and and that we know are not nuts because there's some there's some crazy people out there slow down emotionally I know I'm boring some of you to death but this important if you go to tell somebody say tell somebody you love them you know that's a that's a bigger deal than you think it is when you're a kid go tell somebody you love them you better mean it that's tell my daughter you love her you I've been expecting a ring soon you know don't get too close to someone you aren't serious about because it might have trouble down the road Paul says this he said I he said to the unmarried and widows it's good for them if they abide even aside in other words don't get remarried don't lose hope all you widows and widowers out there said but if they cannot contain let them marry is better to marry than to burn brother brandom said don't live a dirty little life he said it's not right he said that's your sister in one sense where if you're a Christian he said now if it's the world it's the world dog eat dog that's the way it is isn't it but this girl that you're going with that's your sister too that will be the mother of your children that will come don't live a dirty little life around her show her that you're a real Christian gentleman live like a Christian gentleman ought to treat her like your sister and when you get married still treat her that way amen we got to remember that we're Sons and Daughters of the King I'll say this I'm just going to get real plain for a minute we'll close I'm going to skip through some of this if you had a if you've got a problem with pornography or had one marriage won't cure that it warps your sense of right and wrong and I'll say this almost all television today would be Taboo in any other culture at any other time but people just watch it today and the commercials are are x-rated you know you you need to get get your mind right get your thought right get get the Holy Ghost before you get married amen so we need to understand that I'm going to skip past some of this of course brother brandom taught us we should never allow you girls should never allow a boy to kiss you before you raise the veil okay so that's the time to do that so slow down You' got time and but I a couple questions I've been asked I want to get to is it okay for me to have a boyfriend or a girlfriend all right I have no word from the Lord on this is me as a pastor and as a dad that's up to you parents but I'm okay I don't care if you call each other turnips he's my turnip okay I'm okay with that but that what that don't mean what it means today you understand a boyfriend today just means anything goes that's wrong you're not married right and you can't live together it doesn't give you a license for fornication just what the Bible calls it if you want to get to know someone in a public place when parents are or responsible adults are there that's fine that's the time of life you're in we shouldn't criminalize that our kids are going to have to learn to get along and and they should get to know one another church is a great place to find a wife youth Camp's a great place well it just becomes a dating game well I'd rather them date there than somewhere out in the world so I I it's just the time of life that they're in I'm glad I don't have to go back to that aren't you you but let them find the mind of the Lord for themselves then this one is it okay to date someone who's not a Believer I say this I think you need to examine your heart why would you why would you date someone that's not a Believer what's the purpose and I know the scripture and you know the scripture I've read it to you many times don't be unequally yolked together with unbelievers brand says no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry Believers you say well we're not married we're dating why would you date someone who's not a Believer if you can't marry someone who's not a Believer so he said what's an unbeliever an unbeliever is someone who doesn't believe like you do I'm just just being honest with you someone who doesn't believe the message of the hour now they may believe it one day your future wife or future husband may be stocking shells at the grocery store right they may be out there let them come in first and then then you you're welcome to get to know him but I wouldn't do that you know if you do brother BR tells us this he said don't mix Mary he said marry a boy that believes just exactly like you do he said for after all God is the main important thing that we're in the earth to do is to serve him do you believe that you want to serve God with all your heart it's the most important thing he said and if you do marry or anything contrary that you'll pay for it in the days that lays ahead of you so let them come in let them get baptized receive the Holy Ghost watch them their life for a while you say well I'm going to convert them once we're married well if you're not strong enough a Christian now if you're not a strong enough Christian now to refuse to date an unbeliever you won't be strong enough Christian to bring make them bring them to church and get them saved once you're married right they'll I think they'll appreciate that strength that you have to do the right thing if you're not careful you end up like Ahab with a jezebel it's completely unfair to a girl or a boy to get their hopes up when you know you can't marry them it's just not fair to them you you pray for that person you know that again they may be out there but let them come in let them come in because down the road Prophet tells us you're going to have trouble if you do that and yet God can work out any situation do you believe that and some of you that made that mistake and God worked it out and praise God for that but we want to teach our children the truth Customs change but remember there's someone that God has for you you I'm so glad that when you you say well I don't have a husband or a wife and no prospects but you have him and he said he's better than a husband or wife father or mother aren't you glad you have him today there's somebody for you if if you're someone that's meant to be married and you're eligible to be married it's it's okay to have friends get to know people I don't want us to become a church that's known for rules that's not what we are but we want to make sure that we that we keep our children just give them the boundaries so they can be free so they can they can love God with all their heart and and meet someone and be happy God wants us to be happy he don't want us he's not assigned us to all be miserable he wants us to be happy brother brandom taught us that and you say what what should I do brother Ben I I just can't seem to find the right one just love God with all your heart love him with all your heart your soul and your mind and that one is waiting for you you just have to forget about it sometimes before you can meet them that's just the truth of it of it amen let's bow our heads together for just a moment I musicians go ahead and come I hope I haven't bored you this afternoon but we'll have more to say about it in the future and I'm learning too and I want you to know that as a pastor my kids are just now getting to an age and I'm sure there'll be things that happen and I hope you don't judge me too harshly for my children and uh they're they're human beings and I'll say this that I just want to see them love the Lord with all their heart and I want to see them have what I have I have a good marriage and and a wife that loves the Lord and I love the Lord I want to see them have that I realize sometimes things get broken things get hurt people get hurt but there's a God here who can put it all back together aren't you glad for that you can always go back to him kids you're sitting here today you can always go back to him if you get hurt if if you things get broken up you make a mistake don't don't just make make it worse just come back to the Lord it don't mean the end of it it don't mean because you did something wrong that you got to leave the message and run out in the world no you you love God with all your heart just just come back today's a new day it it's a new time don't don't leave and go out just just keep coming back to the word you say what should I do I I'm in this situation I don't know how to get out of just love God with all your heart keep coming to church God will open up a way for you I really believe that he will could we sing I want to live the way he wants me to live if you'll play that and and uh let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I I pray that you'd help us today help me as a pastor Lord I I want to do right so much for the kids and for my children and these young people
