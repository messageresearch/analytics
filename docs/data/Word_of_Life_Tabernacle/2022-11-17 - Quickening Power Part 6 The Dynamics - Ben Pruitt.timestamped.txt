[41:49] things and boy it's my time of year I'll

[41:58] fellowship I enjoy being around uh being

[42:13] planned for that week you're welcome to
[42:15] eat with us here at the church in
[42:16] between services and I think some of

[42:20] some ham and some different things for
[42:23] the season so you're welcome to do that
[42:24] that'll be our our our gift to you if

[42:32] spot but but you're welcome to come and
[42:35] be a part of that or bring your food and
[42:37] and we'll we'll have two services this
[42:39] weekend and I'm going to preach in the
[42:41] morning and then I'm going to eat and
[42:43] then brother Joel's going to take the
[42:44] afternoon service so he can't eat see
[42:47] before he preaches so but that's all
[42:50] right
[42:51] we'll bear each other's burdens on that
[42:54] day
[42:56] amen do you love the Lord tonight
[42:58] so good to be in church on a Wednesday
[43:00] night
[43:01] beginning to feel a little bit more
[43:03] human so
[43:04] so I'm thankful for that and I trust
[43:06] that you all are doing good and you're
[43:08] here tonight and Trust it'll be a
[43:10] blessing to You Luke 24 44 he said unto
[43:14] them these are the words which I've
[43:15] spoken to you while I was yet with you
[43:18] that all things must be fulfilled which
[43:21] were written in the law of Moses and in
[43:23] the prophets and in the Psalms
[43:25] concerning me
[43:27] then he opened either understanding that
[43:31] they might understand the scriptures
[43:33] and said unto them thus it is written
[43:35] and thus it behooves Christ to suffer
[43:37] and to rise from the dead the third day
[43:39] and that repentance and remission of sin
[43:42] should be preached in his name among all
[43:44] nations beginning at Jerusalem your
[43:48] Witnesses of these things
[43:49] behold I send the promise of my father
[43:52] upon you but Terri ye in the city of
[43:55] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[43:58] from on high I pray the Lord would add
[44:00] his Blessing to the word you may be
[44:02] seated
[44:04] mm-hmm
[44:06] what a wonderful thing it must have been
[44:08] to sit in a room with Jesus and have him
[44:11] open the scriptures
[44:13] can you imagine what that must have been
[44:15] like
[44:16] they're sitting with a resurrected
[44:18] Christ yes
[44:20] and him with no limitations on maybe
[44:24] I'll say the wrong thing or do the wrong
[44:26] thing I think about that and I think how
[44:29] many times do I use the wrong
[44:30] illustration or or talk about the wrong
[44:33] thing but Jesus would have had a perfect
[44:36] understanding of the scriptures yes and
[44:39] being the word himself and he was
[44:41] sitting there with them and he was
[44:43] telling them perfectly what was in the
[44:45] scriptures what a what a wonderful time
[44:47] that must have been a a real a real
[44:51] pleasure to sit there and listen to him
[44:53] and all their questions were answered
[44:55] and and yet there was something they
[44:58] needed you'll have to restart that
[45:00] computer to get that to work
[45:03] there was something that they needed
[45:04] before they could begin to do the work
[45:07] that he had for them to do
[45:09] because anytime we are chosen by God how
[45:12] many believe you're chosen tonight by
[45:14] God you're chosen by God if you're
[45:16] chosen by God then there must be a work
[45:19] for you to do there's something that God
[45:21] wants for you to do and and you can be
[45:24] he can train you he can teach you even
[45:27] the greatest Ministries on the earth
[45:29] could teach you and you could sit under
[45:31] them you could even do Miracles and and
[45:33] be under the influence of a mighty
[45:36] anointing and yet you need something to
[45:38] be able to perform the work the specific
[45:41] work that he wants you to do and what's
[45:44] going to do that it takes the Holy Ghost
[45:46] and that's what they yet needed and so
[45:49] he said I don't want you to go out
[45:50] immediately and begin to tell the people
[45:52] about my resurrection I I don't want you
[45:55] to uh to to to uh go out and begin to
[45:58] teach others he said I want you to go up
[46:01] and sit in a room yes until you're
[46:03] endured with power from on high
[46:06] and then when you're endued with power
[46:07] from on high I'm going to give you the
[46:09] ability to do exactly what I want you to
[46:12] do aren't you glad he has that same
[46:14] ability today
[46:16] amen they were our Lord's chosen men
[46:18] they had been chosen for this specific
[46:21] purpose and for this specific time and
[46:24] yet they could not without his power
[46:27] manifest the word of their day yes and
[46:30] so he said I want you to go up he said
[46:33] until you're endued with power from on
[46:35] high now that word endued with power is
[46:38] literally to be clothed in Dynamics
[46:41] Dynamics is the Greek word that means
[46:43] the power or the ability to perform an
[46:46] activity so it's more than just a
[46:49] feeling but it's actually an ability to
[46:52] do what you're supposed to do amen and
[46:55] that's what we need tonight we need the
[46:57] ability to live the word and that is
[47:00] what the dynamic says brother Branham
[47:02] talks about it comes from that word
[47:03] dynamis it is the ability to do what God
[47:07] wants us to do so when you begin to talk
[47:10] from it is the rising of the Sun and
[47:11] begins to uh preached this Easter Sermon
[47:15] as we're studying this tonight he begins
[47:18] to talk about the Dynamics and listen
[47:20] how he describes it
[47:22] he said but now for instance what if we
[47:24] were going to go back to Tucson this
[47:26] afternoon and each of us was going to go
[47:28] in a big Cadillac well that sounds good
[47:31] doesn't it brother Joe I like a Cadillac
[47:34] and and especially back in the day the
[47:36] Cadillac was a great big roomy car a
[47:39] beautiful car and he said it was brand
[47:42] new and all of the seats were made out
[47:44] of dough skin softest leather soft and
[47:48] easy to sit in all the floorboards were
[47:51] plush the steering wheel was nickel
[47:53] plated and had diamond studs all over it
[47:57] and the engine was mechanically tested
[47:59] to be exactly the right engine and the
[48:03] wheels all had the bearings greased up
[48:05] and the tires were all puncture proof
[48:08] and blow out free and I'd all been
[48:11] tested scientifically
[48:14] now I'll just be honest with you I've
[48:16] got a vehicle I've got two nice Vehicles
[48:18] right now and they're both in the shop
[48:22] I got both of them and then they're both
[48:24] they're uh both forbs actually so maybe
[48:27] that's the problem but they're both in
[48:29] the shop and so we're driving Peter's
[48:31] little Saturn and and I've driven it up
[48:33] here today I'm kind of humbled by that
[48:35] I'll be honest with you and it hurts
[48:37] your back to get in and out of it but
[48:39] but it runs
[48:41] hahaha
[48:43] and both the other two were in the shop
[48:45] right now and and so it don't matter how
[48:48] good it looks or how pretty it is how
[48:50] nice the leather is and and how how
[48:52] comfortable the seats are if it don't
[48:54] run it's not going to get anywhere it
[48:57] won't take you anywhere it won't do the
[48:59] work that it was intended to do
[49:01] right but say these these Cadillacs have
[49:03] been pushed off the assembly line both
[49:05] of them and both of them filled up with
[49:07] gasoline yeah that's the running power
[49:10] the gasoline because it is the octane
[49:12] but now when you're going to start them
[49:15] although both of them look just alike
[49:17] now listen church this is so important
[49:19] to us this is so important because we
[49:22] can have everything set just the way we
[49:25] want it to be set in the church we can
[49:27] have everything running smoothly and
[49:29] everything be just right but if he said
[49:31] that the running power is there both of
[49:34] them look just alike but if there's one
[49:35] of them that don't have any Spark
[49:37] yeah any firing power yes now an engine
[49:42] an internal combustion engine is is
[49:44] engineered it's made to run off spark
[49:46] yeah and without spark it'll never go
[49:49] anywhere
[49:51] no matter how much of the other is there
[49:53] the spark has got to be there listen to
[49:56] me church we were not made to run off
[49:59] just the word only
[50:01] right are you hearing me we were not
[50:03] made just to run off the knowledge of
[50:05] the Son of God we were not made just to
[50:07] run off knowledge of the scriptures or
[50:09] knowledge of the message or knowledge of
[50:11] one another but we were made to run off
[50:14] spark yeah
[50:15] right right and you've got to have the
[50:17] other two yeah yeah but you're made to
[50:20] run off spark a church runs on spark
[50:25] right there's got to be a spark of the
[50:27] Holy Ghost
[50:29] or things begin to start falling apart
[50:31] it will not operate the way it's
[50:34] supposed to without the spark yes yes
[50:37] without the empowerment of the Holy
[50:40] Ghost without that Supernatural element
[50:42] Brother game we are unable to be his
[50:45] body on the Earth
[50:47] foreign
[50:48] it will not work otherwise it wasn't
[50:50] engineered that way
[50:52] well you say the power is in the
[50:55] gasoline he said but I don't care how
[50:57] much power is in the gasoline unless
[50:59] there's a spark there to manifest that
[51:02] power are you hearing me tonight unless
[51:04] there's a power there to confirm that
[51:07] that's gasoline it just might as well be
[51:09] water yeah how are you going to prove
[51:11] that it's gasoline because it makes the
[51:13] car run how's it going to make the car
[51:15] run it's got to go through the
[51:16] combustion process and a spark has got
[51:19] to meet with the air and the gasoline
[51:21] yeah oh you hear me now the spark has
[51:24] got to be there in order for it to
[51:26] produce the power to run to the wheels
[51:29] right now we don't need power just to
[51:31] shout with we don't need power to run
[51:33] the aisles with we don't need power that
[51:35] that'd be wonderful but that's not what
[51:37] we need power for that's just the
[51:39] effects of having power but while we
[51:41] need power for is actually to live with
[51:43] yeah yeah it's to perform the works of a
[51:47] bride to be the Bride of Jesus Christ at
[51:49] the end time we need power to be able to
[51:51] do that yes
[51:53] right
[51:55] to love one another right yeah
[51:58] yeah that's right to treat one another
[52:01] right yes
[52:04] just to be Christians yeah
[52:07] yeah
[52:09] you could I can tell you all day how to
[52:11] be a Christian
[52:12] and explain it to you from the Bible but
[52:14] unless there's a spark there of Life
[52:17] it'll never make sense to you you'll
[52:20] never be able to reproduce it
[52:23] see
[52:24] there's a spark there has to be a spark
[52:27] to manifest the power yeah
[52:29] now you could say well the power is on
[52:31] the tapes sure if there's a spark to set
[52:33] it off
[52:35] the power is in the preaching yes if
[52:37] there's a spark to set it off
[52:39] the powers is in the Bible yes
[52:43] right the power's in the gasoline but
[52:45] there's got to be a spark a life to set
[52:48] that off yeah
[52:49] the gasoline represents the word
[52:52] and so no matter how much theologians
[52:54] claim how well you got your church set
[52:56] how much education you got how much like
[52:59] the Bible yeah until that wave sheath
[53:02] remember we talked about that two weeks
[53:03] ago until the Holy Spirit comes upon
[53:06] that person to Quicken that word
[53:10] the gasoline represents the word it's
[53:12] the truth but without the spirit it
[53:13] won't move now let me give you an
[53:15] example of that you could maybe
[53:17] something's been done to you and and
[53:19] there's a problem between you and
[53:21] somebody else now you know that the word
[53:24] says to forgive that person
[53:26] right we know that the Bible says when
[53:29] you stand praying forgive yes right you
[53:32] know it says to do that
[53:35] huh and some of us carry things for
[53:37] years yeah knowing what the word says
[53:40] yes and we'll hear a sermon about
[53:42] forgiveness and it'll eat us up because
[53:45] we know we haven't done it yeah
[53:48] I'm just using that as an example
[53:50] but we'll sit there and not do it anyhow
[53:53] and and and it'll remain that way yeah
[53:55] that word needs to meet a spark yes
[53:58] of the Holy Ghost that'll make us
[54:00] forgive
[54:02] that'll make us because that's what
[54:04] Christians do
[54:07] well I hope you hear me now that's why
[54:09] we need the presence of God Among Us we
[54:11] need the power of God in our services we
[54:14] need God manifesting himself we need not
[54:16] just in our services we need it at home
[54:18] we need to reach a place where we can
[54:20] pray through or we can talk to God and
[54:23] we know he's listening where where we
[54:25] have that that feeling of his presence
[54:27] why we've got to have that spark
[54:30] right in order to forgive like we should
[54:34] that's good how are we going to treat
[54:36] people right now we're going to have
[54:37] brotherly love yes
[54:39] yes unless we have a spark right
[54:41] right and that's what's lacking in so
[54:43] many places
[54:45] but whenever you see any fruit of the
[54:47] spirit lacking in your life Joy yeah
[54:49] right you know the Bible says count it
[54:51] all joy
[54:53] but that's just difficult isn't it yes
[54:55] yes when you're just living your
[54:56] everyday life and and you find yourself
[54:59] going through trial after trial after
[55:01] trial and the kids just keep getting
[55:03] sick and and the people just keep
[55:05] getting sick and and the job keeps
[55:07] getting harder and the world keeps
[55:09] getting worse and everything keeps
[55:11] getting darker and darker and darker and
[55:14] politics is messed up and and the church
[55:16] seems messed up everything seems like
[55:18] it's going down and we begin to look at
[55:20] it and think where or where do I find
[55:22] where can I find joy you need a spark to
[55:25] make that word live in your life you can
[55:27] say I know I'm going through a trial but
[55:29] there's joy in my heart yes
[55:32] in spite of the trial I can have joy
[55:36] are you with me tonight yeah
[55:38] yeah I know it's hard to be joyful when
[55:40] you don't feel good
[55:43] I know what that feels like I don't feel
[55:45] as bad as some of y'all do because I'm
[55:47] not that old
[55:51] but I know what it's like to feel bad
[55:53] and stand up here in the pulpit and feel
[55:55] bad
[55:56] but he said count it all joy yeah and
[55:59] again what do I need a spark to make
[56:01] that live
[56:03] a spark to make that word ignite and
[56:06] begin to work
[56:08] see but the band says the gasoline
[56:10] represents the word it's the truth but
[56:11] without the spirit it won't move we have
[56:13] put too much stress on the mechanics and
[56:16] nothing on the dynamic yeah it needs the
[56:19] dynamic power of God the resurrection
[56:22] power of Jesus Christ upon the church to
[56:26] manifest and to bring to pass that this
[56:29] is gasoline we can go out and we can
[56:31] tell the world and say well you know we
[56:33] have we have the Bible Well other
[56:36] religions say they have a book
[56:38] right and they'll tell you it's true the
[56:40] muhammadans will tell you the Muslims
[56:42] will tell you all my our book is true
[56:44] the Quran is right it comes directly
[56:46] from God to Muhammad and he wrote it
[56:48] down they say that their Bible is true
[56:51] well how can you prove that this is
[56:53] gasoline
[56:55] right are you with me now yeah how can
[56:57] you prove that this is the truth how can
[57:00] you prove this message is true it's when
[57:02] it works yes when it does what it says
[57:05] it would do
[57:07] we've got to prove that to our
[57:09] generation brother Brandon proved that
[57:11] to his generation but somebody has got
[57:13] to prove it in this generation it's not
[57:16] enough to live on what somebody did 40
[57:18] years ago but somebody did 50 years ago
[57:20] but somebody's got to prove in spite of
[57:22] difficulty in spite of it somebody's
[57:25] going to live right somebody's going to
[57:27] be Godly somebody's going to be holy
[57:29] somebody's going to have families that
[57:31] love one another somebody's going to
[57:33] have a church are you with me now where
[57:35] the power of God is there where healing
[57:37] is there we're signs and wonders are
[57:39] present somebody's gonna do that this
[57:41] might as well be us
[57:43] how somebody's got to do it somebody's
[57:45] got to prove that this is gasoline
[57:47] somebody's got to prove and that's what
[57:50] they needed they needed to go into the
[57:51] upper room until they could begin to
[57:53] prove God began to manifest through them
[57:55] yes until there was a spark
[57:59] oh my
[58:02] he said it might be in a gasoline can
[58:04] it could still be water
[58:06] but the only proof of it is put this
[58:08] life on it
[58:09] and it'll prove whether it's gasoline or
[58:11] not
[58:12] and again the reverse is also true it's
[58:15] got to be real gasoline yeah yeah right
[58:17] it's got to be the word when you try to
[58:19] put the holy spirit in a denomination
[58:20] you're you get a splutter
[58:23] you ruin your engine by getting it full
[58:25] of carbon
[58:26] but oh I'm so glad there's a ten
[58:28] thousand octane power
[58:30] of the word of God now notice he said
[58:32] there is a 10 000 octane power
[58:35] the word of God and the Holy Ghost to
[58:37] light it up and to resurrect the power
[58:39] of God into a man's life or a woman's
[58:42] life or into a church yes
[58:44] how to resurrect the power of God into a
[58:47] church to shoved that Cadillac down the
[58:49] road Yonder under the dynamic power of
[58:52] the Holy Ghost which came back and was
[58:53] waved over the people of the day of
[58:55] Pentecost making him the same yesterday
[58:57] today and forever you say well how do
[58:59] you know that it's possible how do you
[59:01] know that a church can be under that
[59:03] situation and how do you know that a
[59:05] church can do the works of Jesus Christ
[59:07] and we know it because they did it yes
[59:10] right right we know it because they did
[59:13] it we've seen it done we know what this
[59:15] car can do
[59:17] given the right Spark
[59:19] right we know what it can do go read the
[59:21] book of Acts we know exactly what the
[59:24] word does when it's forgiven the proper
[59:27] spark and it doesn't create a
[59:29] denomination it doesn't create a cult of
[59:31] some kind it doesn't create a bunch of
[59:33] people that can't get along although
[59:35] that's that's in the human part but it
[59:37] does create a church that's full of the
[59:39] Holy Ghost it does create a people that
[59:40] love one another it does create somebody
[59:43] that the world can look at them and say
[59:45] you're Christians yes I may not agree
[59:48] with you but you're a Christian
[59:50] yeah right that's the way we ought to be
[59:53] our message ought to be unimpeachable to
[59:55] the world
[59:56] when it comes to our personal conduct
[59:59] how can we do that
[1:00:01] a spark
[1:00:02] yes
[1:00:06] brother Branham
[1:00:08] begins to make a the argument
[1:00:11] that there must be a bride
[1:00:14] at the end time that has these Dynamics
[1:00:17] right so he doesn't just leave it
[1:00:20] in a previous age and say this is the
[1:00:23] way it was yeah but he's saying this is
[1:00:25] how it is yes
[1:00:27] this is the principle of the wave Chief
[1:00:30] it's saying if it was waived it must be
[1:00:32] waved back if it come in in Grain form
[1:00:35] it's got to come in loaf form as we
[1:00:37] talked about the wave offering in Israel
[1:00:40] he said there was the first Chief come
[1:00:41] up from all the prophets which was the
[1:00:43] Son of God the king of all prophets we
[1:00:45] know when Jesus came he was the
[1:00:47] anti-type he was the he was the end
[1:00:50] result of all the what the prophets had
[1:00:52] foreshadowed there was David that come
[1:00:54] and there was there was Joseph and there
[1:00:56] was Abraham and Isaac and and Jacob and
[1:00:59] there was all the different prophets
[1:01:00] that come in Jeremiah and Isaiah and
[1:01:03] each one of them Ezekiel but they only
[1:01:05] foreshadowed who he was and they only
[1:01:08] had a portion of and each one of them
[1:01:09] failed in in some way some of them
[1:01:12] spectacularly
[1:01:14] if I can say get the word out
[1:01:16] some of them failed spectacularly they
[1:01:18] they just they seemed like they had it
[1:01:20] all right David was a man after God's
[1:01:22] Own Heart and a man after God's Own
[1:01:24] Heart and then all of a sudden he goes
[1:01:26] out and does what he did and had a man
[1:01:27] killed and committed adultery and say
[1:01:29] how in the world could that possibly
[1:01:31] happen he was only a type looking
[1:01:33] forward but there was one that come that
[1:01:36] did no sin yes
[1:01:38] yes right there was one that come that
[1:01:40] that was king of all the prophets
[1:01:42] that was the son of God yes are you with
[1:01:46] me now yes there was one who come and
[1:01:48] was that perfect one and his name is
[1:01:50] Jesus Christ
[1:01:51] no other man can fill that place right
[1:01:54] there was one lamb who was worthy to
[1:01:56] take the book and open the seals one man
[1:01:58] who could come for our Redemption yes
[1:02:01] one man the Son of God the king of all
[1:02:03] the prophets and every Prophet leading
[1:02:05] up to that time foreshadowed him but
[1:02:08] just as there had to be one oh I'm we're
[1:02:11] about to say something church just as
[1:02:13] there had to be one son of God who was
[1:02:15] the Fulfillment of all that had been
[1:02:16] written about the groom come on there
[1:02:19] also has to be a bride
[1:02:21] for the game are you hear me this is a
[1:02:23] great truth I want you to understand
[1:02:24] this there has to be a bride yes don't
[1:02:27] let Satan come and tell you whether it's
[1:02:29] nobody nobody's doing it right and the
[1:02:32] message is going downhill no there's got
[1:02:34] to be a bride somewhere
[1:02:37] there's got to be a people somewhere
[1:02:39] because just as there had to be a son
[1:02:41] there has to be a bride
[1:02:44] oh my every Prophet foreshadowed him but
[1:02:48] there has been churches
[1:02:50] I remember there were prophets there
[1:02:53] were prophets he's told Moses he said
[1:02:55] I'll raise him up a prophet like you
[1:02:57] I told David David said they pierced my
[1:03:00] hands and my feet there was prophets
[1:03:01] prophets prophets but finally there came
[1:03:04] the prophet
[1:03:05] there was churches
[1:03:08] churches churches Brides brides churches
[1:03:13] Brides brides what was it people in
[1:03:16] every age who come on and had a portion
[1:03:19] and had a good thing that they had had
[1:03:22] justification and sanctification and and
[1:03:24] the holy ghosts and different things
[1:03:26] that they had but there's got to come
[1:03:28] one
[1:03:29] yes there's got to come one who's a real
[1:03:32] bride
[1:03:33] there has to come a real bride just like
[1:03:35] there had to be a real group there has
[1:03:38] to be a real bride there must come one
[1:03:40] aren't you glad to be one of them
[1:03:43] we've got to be part of that one this is
[1:03:46] the end time this is it
[1:03:47] this is this is the end of all things
[1:03:49] there must come one that's not only got
[1:03:52] the mechanics but the Dynamics of it
[1:03:54] there's got to be a people that are come
[1:03:56] that come along that are actually able
[1:03:58] to put it in motion again and the car
[1:04:01] run like it should not sputter around on
[1:04:04] some denominational system but run like
[1:04:06] it was supposed to love like they're
[1:04:09] supposed to walk like they're supposed
[1:04:11] to live like they're supposed to there's
[1:04:13] got to be coming one I don't care what
[1:04:16] they do out in the world
[1:04:18] come on
[1:04:22] well there will come a maybe a political
[1:04:25] Revival politics is gone yeah
[1:04:30] you realize that just a few years ago
[1:04:32] gay marriage was illegal yeah
[1:04:34] yeah and just use one example there's
[1:04:35] many things
[1:04:36] but just a few years ago gay marriage
[1:04:38] was illegal
[1:04:40] and not only this state but in every
[1:04:41] state in the Union
[1:04:43] now it's legal and just today they did a
[1:04:46] test vote in the Senate to write it into
[1:04:48] the law yeah
[1:04:49] and enough Republicans voted for it
[1:04:53] so that they could pass through the
[1:04:55] Senate and it'll it's going to pass
[1:04:59] and that's Republicans
[1:05:01] voted for it
[1:05:02] we're not going to find Salvation in
[1:05:04] politics
[1:05:06] yeah that's not where our help comes
[1:05:07] from but David said I will lift my eyes
[1:05:10] to the hills from whence cometh my help
[1:05:13] my Help Cometh From The Lord the Lord of
[1:05:16] heavens and earth I'm not going to look
[1:05:17] at politics for my salvation I'm not
[1:05:19] going to look at these things but
[1:05:20] there's coming a bride the word said
[1:05:23] that there would be a people who would
[1:05:25] live right no matter what the schools do
[1:05:26] no matter what the churches do no matter
[1:05:29] what the what politics does
[1:05:31] there's got to be somebody who
[1:05:33] represents God on the earth at the end
[1:05:36] time
[1:05:37] there must come one
[1:05:39] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:05:41] the Dynamics of it do you believe that
[1:05:43] tonight there must come one that makes
[1:05:46] that shirt but the Dynamics that makes
[1:05:48] that church live moving the power of his
[1:05:50] resurrection
[1:05:51] he said until we come to that place
[1:05:53] until we find that place what good does
[1:05:55] it do to polish the hubs what good does
[1:05:58] it do to give her a facelift or a
[1:05:59] simonized job how many remember what a
[1:06:02] simonize is
[1:06:03] Simon has the wax I had to look it up
[1:06:08] simonizes wax and it's a certain brand
[1:06:12] of wax and that'd become a uh what you
[1:06:14] call it when you wax your car or
[1:06:15] simonized job what good does it do to
[1:06:18] give it a facelift what good does it do
[1:06:20] to sit there and wax it
[1:06:21] again I've got that I've got a beautiful
[1:06:23] Ford Expedition
[1:06:25] got comfortable seats heated and cooled
[1:06:29] what good does it do me in the shop
[1:06:33] are you with me now perfect timing for
[1:06:36] me to preach this sermon
[1:06:39] you see all those other things are
[1:06:41] programmed
[1:06:44] you can have program and we we should we
[1:06:46] should do things for our young people
[1:06:47] yeah we should have good music we should
[1:06:50] have good views we should we should make
[1:06:52] it comfortable in the house of God we
[1:06:54] should do everything we can to help
[1:06:55] people yeah not just ourselves to help
[1:06:58] people
[1:06:59] we should help people in the community
[1:07:00] help people around us we should be nice
[1:07:03] to people we should treat people right
[1:07:05] we should do everything we can that
[1:07:07] we're here we might as well do it yeah
[1:07:09] we should do everything we can for the
[1:07:11] community but all of that is programmed
[1:07:13] yeah
[1:07:14] yeah all of that is programmed if
[1:07:16] there's no Dynamics it'll never go down
[1:07:18] the road right
[1:07:20] but this church is different this this
[1:07:22] car is different because it operates
[1:07:24] like what he said it would operate yeah
[1:07:27] somebody's got to have the spark yes
[1:07:29] yes might as well be us yeah yeah she
[1:07:32] programmed without the spark is dead
[1:07:33] yeah but the parent said no matter how
[1:07:36] much the mechanics proved to be right
[1:07:37] there's got to be a Dynamics to make it
[1:07:39] work
[1:07:40] that's what he proved Hallelujah that's
[1:07:43] what Easter proved he wasn't only the
[1:07:44] word but he was God himself the Dynamics
[1:07:47] in the work aren't you glad for that
[1:07:49] tonight that made the body of Jesus
[1:07:51] Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave
[1:07:53] shaken to life and raised again and roll
[1:07:55] away the stone I am he that was dead so
[1:07:58] dead to the son said he was dead the
[1:08:00] moon said he was dead the Stars said he
[1:08:02] was dead all nature said he was dead and
[1:08:04] now the whole world has to recognize
[1:08:06] he's alive again he was not only the
[1:08:08] mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics
[1:08:10] to prove it
[1:08:12] and if he being the groom the bride has
[1:08:14] to come forth because it's part of him
[1:08:17] has to come forth
[1:08:19] oh that ought to give us courage faith
[1:08:22] right we can be that
[1:08:25] we can be that
[1:08:27] I know that's hard when you're sitting
[1:08:29] at home caring for your children yeah
[1:08:31] and they're sick I know that's difficult
[1:08:33] when you struggle through school and
[1:08:35] work and you drag your kids to church
[1:08:36] and everybody's mad at each other
[1:08:39] it's hard to feel like the one
[1:08:43] so maybe it's somebody else
[1:08:45] but he didn't call Perfect People the
[1:08:47] first time all right but he went and he
[1:08:49] got a tax collector yeah and he got a
[1:08:52] fisherman yeah yeah and he got a and he
[1:08:54] got a bunch of uh he didn't send and a
[1:08:57] bunch of people that didn't know nothing
[1:08:58] couldn't write their name in boxcar
[1:09:00] letters a bunch of illiterate
[1:09:02] ignoramuses is what the Pharisees called
[1:09:04] them
[1:09:04] a bunch of people that didn't know
[1:09:06] anything about letters but they but they
[1:09:09] would follow him
[1:09:10] called a bunch of people who had
[1:09:12] problems a bunch of people who messed up
[1:09:14] a bunch of people who even denied him
[1:09:16] but he said I want you to go get the
[1:09:18] spark so that it'll change you I want
[1:09:20] you to get a spark so that you can begin
[1:09:22] to work he said I'll provide you the
[1:09:24] mechanics and then I'm going to give you
[1:09:26] the Dynamics on top of it
[1:09:29] hey man he was the Dynamics to prove the
[1:09:33] Mechanics Work
[1:09:34] Hallelujah and is he being the groom the
[1:09:37] bride has to come forth because it's
[1:09:38] part of him and it can only be the
[1:09:40] manifestation of the fulfilling of all
[1:09:43] the revelations
[1:09:44] any others has spoke of the Bride In
[1:09:48] other words whatever they foreshadowed
[1:09:49] it can only manifest
[1:09:51] does something different from the groom
[1:09:53] it isn't the bride because she is flesh
[1:09:56] of his flesh bone of his bone life of
[1:09:58] his life power of his power she is him
[1:10:01] yes as man and woman are one and a woman
[1:10:04] taken from his side she's taking a
[1:10:05] spirit the feminist Spirit from him the
[1:10:07] flesh from his side made both mechanics
[1:10:10] and Dynamics the wife yeah
[1:10:13] the wife yeah
[1:10:15] yeah not a wife the wife yeah
[1:10:18] not a church the church
[1:10:21] are you with me now
[1:10:23] hey man he said the spirit of him and
[1:10:25] the Flesh of him put it together made
[1:10:27] mechanics and Dynamics
[1:10:31] I'm losing my voice if I gotta get
[1:10:32] through the rest of this
[1:10:34] and we'll close look
[1:10:36] he said until the Church of the people
[1:10:37] all these Easter Bunny ceremonies big
[1:10:39] churches the finery will fail and pass
[1:10:42] away until that church becomes both
[1:10:44] Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of
[1:10:47] God that moved him to do the things that
[1:10:50] he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will
[1:10:53] the bride yeah I love the way brother
[1:10:56] Branham describes this vehicle yes
[1:10:58] yes he doesn't describe it as a
[1:11:00] four-cylinder yeah
[1:11:01] huh or an eight cylinder that shuts down
[1:11:04] to six like some of them do
[1:11:07] or a six cylinder that shuts down to
[1:11:09] four he doesn't describe it as a gas
[1:11:11] saver yeah
[1:11:13] yeah a Hugo
[1:11:16] are you with me now all right he doesn't
[1:11:18] describe this church as a Hugo yeah he
[1:11:21] doesn't describe it as a little Saturn
[1:11:22] like I got sitting outside he doesn't
[1:11:25] describe it as little thing that you
[1:11:26] just have to drop down on the gas pedal
[1:11:28] you just barely get up to 40 miles an
[1:11:30] hour he said it's 16 cylinders yes
[1:11:33] that's a big engine yeah
[1:11:35] yeah tell you what that engine will make
[1:11:37] some noise yeah sure will
[1:11:40] that's right yeah a 16 cylinder engine
[1:11:42] you ain't gonna get it to be very quiet
[1:11:43] yeah it's not a gas saver it's got
[1:11:46] plenty of gasoline but a big tank hey
[1:11:49] man
[1:11:49] hey man he said he said he hit on 16
[1:11:52] cylinders so will the bride he said in
[1:11:54] John 14 12 he that believeth on me the
[1:11:56] works that I do shall he do also I'll
[1:11:58] give him a charge of my Dynamics in his
[1:12:01] mechanics that the world will not be
[1:12:02] able to withstand it and I'll raise him
[1:12:04] up again at the last day
[1:12:06] he said that's the Easter message the
[1:12:08] Dynamics and the mechanics together he
[1:12:10] said the mechanics without the Dynamics
[1:12:12] is no good neither is the Dynamics
[1:12:13] without the mechanics you can scream and
[1:12:16] shout and jump up and down all you want
[1:12:17] to and deny this word it won't do any
[1:12:19] good yeah you're just cranking around
[1:12:21] the Pistons you see got the spark there
[1:12:24] to fire but no gasoline to fire it by
[1:12:26] e it'll only work as they come together
[1:12:30] so he said one will sit still
[1:12:32] yeah and the other one will go up
[1:12:35] now let me show you this in the
[1:12:36] scripture before we go can we do that we
[1:12:38] got time to do that yes
[1:12:40] I promise I won't hold you much longer
[1:12:42] Matthew 25.
[1:12:44] this is a parable of the wise and
[1:12:46] foolish virgin
[1:12:48] remember one sit still
[1:12:51] one goes up right
[1:12:54] right what's the difference the Dynamics
[1:12:56] yes
[1:12:58] yes right
[1:12:59] Matthew 25 and 1 then show the Kingdom
[1:13:01] of Heaven be likened unto ten virgins
[1:13:03] which took their lamps and went for it
[1:13:06] to meet the bridegroom they all had
[1:13:08] lamps
[1:13:10] and five of them were wise
[1:13:12] and five were foolish now how do we know
[1:13:14] that they were wise
[1:13:16] and which ones were wise and which ones
[1:13:18] were foolish
[1:13:19] it tells us today that we're foolish
[1:13:21] took their lamps and took no oil with
[1:13:24] them we know oil in the scripture is the
[1:13:25] type of the Holy Spirit
[1:13:28] they had no charge
[1:13:30] no spark
[1:13:32] no oil yeah
[1:13:34] right you see it's just a different type
[1:13:36] but it's the same same concept
[1:13:39] there's no no power
[1:13:41] so but the wives took oil in their
[1:13:43] vessels with their lamps so these have
[1:13:46] lamps wicks they're they're trimmed
[1:13:49] they're cleaned up they're ready
[1:13:51] but no oil
[1:13:54] these have the same lamps the same wicks
[1:13:57] sing the same songs
[1:13:59] right hear the same preaching
[1:14:03] right what's the difference
[1:14:06] one has oil in their vessel
[1:14:09] while the bridegroom tarried verse five
[1:14:11] they all slumbered and slept
[1:14:13] and at midnight there was a cry mate
[1:14:15] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[1:14:19] to meet him I believe we've heard that
[1:14:20] Midnight Cry
[1:14:22] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[1:14:25] their lamps they all arose
[1:14:28] and trimmed their lamps
[1:14:30] and the foolish fed to the wise give us
[1:14:33] of your oil
[1:14:34] for our lamps are going out but the wise
[1:14:37] answered saying not so this is a
[1:14:39] personal salvation
[1:14:42] right we can't give you ours
[1:14:45] you can't get it from your grandmother
[1:14:46] right you don't get it from the preacher
[1:14:49] you don't get it you got to get some
[1:14:51] yourself yes
[1:14:53] oh you hearing me now you're not born
[1:14:55] into it you can't just become a part of
[1:14:58] the church
[1:14:59] but you've got to have the oil
[1:15:02] he said go to them
[1:15:04] that sell and buy for yourselves and
[1:15:06] while they went to buy the bridegroom
[1:15:08] came and they that were ready went in
[1:15:10] with him to the marriage and the door
[1:15:11] was shut afterward came also the other
[1:15:14] virgin saying Lord Lord open to us but
[1:15:16] he answered and said verily I said to
[1:15:18] you I know you not watch therefore for
[1:15:21] you know neither the day nor the hour
[1:15:23] We're in the son of man cometh listen
[1:15:26] they both looked alike they both had the
[1:15:28] same thing they both had the same lamps
[1:15:30] same style of lamp bought it at the same
[1:15:33] store
[1:15:34] sir are you with me now everything
[1:15:36] looked the same but one had one didn't
[1:15:40] one could make a fire
[1:15:42] and the other one couldn't
[1:15:45] the Brother Bear said they both might
[1:15:46] look alike both claim to be churches
[1:15:49] both claim to be bride but one has
[1:15:51] mechanics and Dynamics
[1:15:53] brings it to pass of what he said is the
[1:15:55] truth
[1:15:56] it just won't move no matter how good
[1:15:58] the mechanics is until the Dynamics come
[1:16:01] when the Dynamics come that fire is made
[1:16:03] to connect with the octane in the
[1:16:05] gasoline
[1:16:07] see it's engineered for that
[1:16:09] and he doesn't leave us with a low
[1:16:11] octane either he said this is a thousand
[1:16:13] octane
[1:16:14] it's a 16 cylinder car
[1:16:17] running a thousand octane guests
[1:16:21] you gotta you gotta fire to that but the
[1:16:23] Harold it's going to do something
[1:16:27] but he said without that it just won't
[1:16:29] move
[1:16:30] he said when that explodes
[1:16:32] it causes a combustion and that
[1:16:34] combustion moves every motion every move
[1:16:38] for he is the same yesterday today and
[1:16:42] forever right that's the resurrection
[1:16:44] that's the real power of God mechanics
[1:16:46] with the Dynamics he said notice it's
[1:16:48] the spirit that quickens it's the spark
[1:16:51] that fires it's not the gas that fires
[1:16:53] it's the spark that fires the gas you
[1:16:55] can do nothing without me but with me
[1:16:57] you can do all things as he is the word
[1:17:00] it's the father living father sent me so
[1:17:02] send I you as the father has fired me
[1:17:04] and pushed me into everything I do only
[1:17:06] that which is pleasing to God now as he
[1:17:09] sent me so send out you with the same
[1:17:11] mechanics and it takes the same Dynamics
[1:17:14] to operate it and these signs shall
[1:17:16] follow them to claim to have the
[1:17:17] mechanics the Dynamics will take its
[1:17:19] place
[1:17:20] Paul said the gospel came to us not in
[1:17:22] word only
[1:17:23] through gasoline only but through spark
[1:17:26] also to make it move there you are it
[1:17:29] came to us in that manner
[1:17:33] for Our Gospel hey that's first
[1:17:34] Thessalonians 1 5 came down to you in
[1:17:36] word only also in power and in the Holy
[1:17:38] Ghost and in much Assurance as you knew
[1:17:41] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:17:42] your sake you saw it work
[1:17:46] you saw it work
[1:17:48] musicians go ahead and come I'm done I
[1:17:50] promise you I wouldn't take long
[1:17:52] look
[1:17:53] on the mechanics and Dynamics both
[1:17:56] present
[1:17:57] they're both here right
[1:17:59] right a prophet told us that the
[1:18:01] mechanics are here the word has been
[1:18:03] revealed the Dynamics are here
[1:18:07] why do we sputter
[1:18:10] think about it you ever get to drive in
[1:18:11] your spiritual car down the road brother
[1:18:12] Joe and it feels like you're driving a
[1:18:14] four-cylinder
[1:18:17] you come to church on Wednesday night
[1:18:19] and you just
[1:18:30] I made it
[1:18:32] oh
[1:18:34] another service
[1:18:38] I don't know if I can make it back or
[1:18:39] not but I'm here tonight preacher preach
[1:18:41] me happy fill me up with gas
[1:18:44] you don't have a a problem with being
[1:18:46] not empty on gaps
[1:18:52] that's not your problem
[1:18:54] you ever want to say well I've got the
[1:18:55] mechanics and the Dynamics I don't
[1:18:56] understand I'm moving but I'm sputtering
[1:19:00] I'm moving but I'm my spark plugs are
[1:19:02] all fouled up
[1:19:05] you know an engine was made to run
[1:19:08] at a certain speed
[1:19:10] if you've got a 16 cylinder engine and
[1:19:13] you go out there and you you run that
[1:19:15] engine on idle constantly yeah yeah you
[1:19:18] know what's going to happen to it some
[1:19:19] of you know engines better than I do
[1:19:22] huh what's going to happen to you that's
[1:19:23] why you don't buy an x a car that used
[1:19:25] to be a police car
[1:19:26] or a taxi because it may have low miles
[1:19:29] but it's been idling for a long time
[1:19:33] and when you don't put your foot on the
[1:19:35] gas
[1:19:37] foreign
[1:19:41] we've been driving this car like it's a
[1:19:43] little Pinto
[1:19:45] first car that I got a hold of was a
[1:19:47] Ford a Ford a Ford uh tempo
[1:19:51] Pinto's older than that isn't it
[1:19:53] I had a gray Ford Tempo that thing would
[1:19:55] just barely get up and down the
[1:19:57] mountains
[1:19:58] just barely move
[1:20:00] remember I bought that car and come
[1:20:01] outside the very first morning me and my
[1:20:03] brother went together to get that car
[1:20:05] and we got it down the very first one we
[1:20:07] bought some used tires and put on it and
[1:20:09] the very first morning we looked outside
[1:20:11] and all four tires were flat
[1:20:15] huh
[1:20:16] but we we thought that thing was but it
[1:20:18] got us around but it wasn't very good I
[1:20:20] don't like that
[1:20:22] my wife will tell you I've been having a
[1:20:23] hard time with this little car
[1:20:25] I don't like that I like to be able to
[1:20:27] go up a hill
[1:20:29] I like to be able to pass somebody
[1:20:32] are you with me now
[1:20:36] you're sputtering
[1:20:40] he ever found yourself like that I do
[1:20:43] you're sputtered you're sitting behind
[1:20:45] it's like you're sitting back on one of
[1:20:46] these Hills it's two-lane roads and you
[1:20:48] got in front of you a great big old
[1:20:50] greasy truck
[1:20:51] like a trash truck
[1:20:53] and it's right in front of you that
[1:20:55] thing just blowing clouds of smoke back
[1:20:58] on you blowing clouds of depression
[1:21:03] and you're sitting back there oh about
[1:21:05] sick of it oh if I just had the ability
[1:21:10] all right you're not driving a four
[1:21:12] Pinto
[1:21:14] foreign
[1:21:15] you're not even driving a Ford
[1:21:17] Expedition
[1:21:18] you're driving a race car
[1:21:21] you're driving a car of the word
[1:21:23] you're not driving a denominational
[1:21:25] vehicle
[1:21:30] Lord begin showing me this thing and I
[1:21:31] thought God too many times I sit behind
[1:21:33] that great a big old trash truck I'm
[1:21:36] sitting back there crying oh God
[1:21:39] if I could just get behind I could just
[1:21:41] figure out what happens put your foot on
[1:21:43] the gas
[1:21:45] say I'm a Child of God
[1:21:48] I belong in the house of God my family
[1:21:51] belongs in the house of God my church is
[1:21:54] not going to be full of sickness the
[1:21:55] rest of my life my family is not going
[1:21:58] to be full of sicknesses my mind I'm not
[1:22:00] I'm not going to be constantly giving in
[1:22:02] to besetting sin I'm tired of driving
[1:22:05] behind the trash truck I'm tired of
[1:22:07] being depressed constantly and being
[1:22:09] laid back at home and wondering why I
[1:22:11] can't get to the house of God put your
[1:22:13] foot on the gas you're the only one that
[1:22:15] can do it push down on the gas you've
[1:22:17] got 16 cylinders you've got a full tank
[1:22:20] push your foot down on the gas let that
[1:22:22] car go at some point you're going to
[1:22:24] have to pass
[1:22:27] but there's danger in that not in the
