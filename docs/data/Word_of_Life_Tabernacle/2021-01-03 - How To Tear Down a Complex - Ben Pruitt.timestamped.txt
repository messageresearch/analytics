[43:38] the deacons and trustees
[43:40] i've also nominated with alan price uh
[43:43] to be
[43:44] served as a trustee and uh so if it's
[43:46] the will of the church for him to do
[43:48] that we've nominated him to serve and
[43:49] you'll vote on that
[43:51] and brother harvey savage to serve as a
[43:53] deacon
[43:54] and all of the current officers to stay
[43:56] and
[43:57] so we we thank god and i think all of
[43:59] them are and so we thank god for that
[44:01] now
[44:01] we'll do that just the way we did the
[44:04] pastor election
[44:05] so we'll start getting ballots out to
[44:07] you next week because it's hard to get
[44:08] everybody here in the same service
[44:10] so we'll do it the same way and and just
[44:12] collected an offering i think is how we
[44:13] did at that time
[44:14] and just collect the ballots that
[44:16] morning that weekend brother andrew
[44:18] glover is supposed to be with us so
[44:21] we'll be praying about that that he'll
[44:22] be able to make it this time after
[44:24] several times that he's tried to come
[44:25] and
[44:26] and been hindered but maybe this is the
[44:27] time that the lord would have for him to
[44:29] come
[44:29] and uh so it'd be saturday night and
[44:31] sunday morning and that's that's
[44:33] on the 16th and 17th uh let's read from
[44:37] first chronicles chapter 4 and verse 9.
[44:40] you still love the lord you still love
[44:43] me
[44:44] amen you still love one another amen god
[44:47] bless you this morning
[44:49] we're so glad to be in the house of the
[44:50] lord and jabez was more honorable than
[44:53] his brethren
[44:55] and his mother called his name jabez
[44:58] saying
[44:59] because i bear him with sorrow
[45:02] and jabez called on the god of israel
[45:04] saying oh
[45:06] that thou wouldest bless me indeed and
[45:09] enlarge my coast and that thine hand
[45:11] might be with me
[45:13] and that thou would escape me from evil
[45:16] that it may not grieve me and god
[45:18] granted him
[45:20] that which he requested let's bow our
[45:23] heads one more time
[45:24] we've talked for a moment let's talk to
[45:26] the author lord jesus i pray
[45:29] god that you just come and open this
[45:30] book to us lord
[45:32] help us help me to say nothing that i
[45:34] shouldn't say lord and
[45:35] only the things that i should we ask it
[45:38] in jesus name
[45:39] amen you can be seated
[45:44] i want to speak to you this morning on a
[45:47] subject and
[45:47] i want us to listen this morning and try
[45:50] to pay attention if we can because i
[45:51] think it's something that all of us deal
[45:52] with
[45:54] and i know you've heard some things on
[45:55] this before but maybe it'll just open up
[45:57] to you in a little bit different way
[46:00] i want to speak to you on how to tear
[46:01] down a complex
[46:03] how to tear down a complex
[46:07] i heard a story about a salesman who was
[46:10] out one night
[46:11] on a dark rainy night and he had a flat
[46:14] tire
[46:15] he's out in the country and on a lonely
[46:17] road and
[46:18] in the distance he sees a farmhouse so
[46:20] he gets out of his car and he's walking
[46:23] through the rain as he's walking through
[46:24] the rain he begins to think he said well
[46:26] you know it's late at night and
[46:28] it's raining and the farmer probably
[46:30] went to bed already
[46:31] and and surely he'll have a lug wrench
[46:34] but he's probably going to be mad at me
[46:36] for being bothered and
[46:37] he gets himself all worked up as he goes
[46:39] along and
[46:40] he gets a little bit closer to the
[46:41] farmhouse and knocks on the door and
[46:45] and somebody from an upstairs window
[46:47] says who is it
[46:49] and the salesman says you know who it is
[46:51] it's me
[46:52] and you can have your old lug wrench i
[46:55] didn't want it
[46:55] anyway he never asked for it
[47:00] because he had already built the complex
[47:03] that he wasn't going to get it
[47:07] i the other night
[47:11] i was pondering about complexes and
[47:13] things that to deal
[47:14] with to do with the mind and i was
[47:16] pondering about that brother stewart
[47:18] mentioned it and so i'm kind of stealing
[47:20] his thought a little bit but he'll be
[47:21] preaching for us wednesday night but he
[47:23] had mentioned it on
[47:24] watch night i read a quote about
[47:26] complexes and then
[47:27] that night i went to bed and i had a
[47:29] dream and in my dream i asked myself the
[47:32] question do you have a complex
[47:35] do you have a complex and the answer is
[47:38] probably yes
[47:40] for almost all of us we we probably have
[47:43] some kind of
[47:44] of complex and it's something that
[47:47] humans do
[47:48] that's just what we do it's part of the
[47:51] human condition
[47:52] and yet is something that must be
[47:54] recognized and overcome
[47:56] and that's important because just
[47:58] because people do this
[48:00] doesn't mean we have to continue to do
[48:02] it because we are overcomers
[48:05] we're called to something better and and
[48:07] if you tear one down you might come up
[48:09] with another one you might build up
[48:10] another one not realize it but
[48:12] but you're called to tear those things
[48:14] down and to defeat those things now
[48:17] uh there's the bible tells us that there
[48:20] is no temptation taking you but such as
[48:22] is common to man
[48:23] but god is faithful who will not suffer
[48:25] you to be tempted above that you're able
[48:28] but with the temptation also make a way
[48:30] to escape
[48:31] that you may be able to bear it so we
[48:33] could put it like this that you can
[48:35] always live the word
[48:38] you can always live the word you don't
[48:42] ever
[48:42] have to live not according to the word
[48:46] you know there's nothing you say well
[48:47] brother ben you don't know my life no
[48:48] the word is not there
[48:50] for you to reach out and never be able
[48:52] to attain but the word is there
[48:54] so you can attain to it and we do that
[48:56] by the grace of god we do that by the
[48:58] mercy of god we know in the flesh we
[49:00] can't do that
[49:01] but there's something inside of us that
[49:02] pulls us to be more than what we are and
[49:04] something greater than than what we can
[49:06] even handle on our own
[49:08] we're so grateful for that today but
[49:11] so we deal with these complexes but we
[49:13] have to overcome them now
[49:14] the first thing that we want to look at
[49:16] is how the complex was built
[49:19] because if you know how something was
[49:21] built if you could get the plans to
[49:23] something if you were going to
[49:25] uh going to attack a fortress if you
[49:28] could get the plans to it you would know
[49:30] you would know how to attack it what the
[49:32] weak points are how to
[49:34] tear it down and as we begin to
[49:37] study the plans we realize we've got to
[49:39] overcome and overcome means to recognize
[49:42] the devil
[49:43] in every one of his tricks
[49:46] now a complex is interesting because
[49:50] if you look at the word complex it's
[49:51] something that
[49:53] is consisting of many different and
[49:55] connected parts
[49:58] right a complex is not just one thing
[50:01] a complex starts as one thing
[50:04] and you build it and i build it
[50:08] into something else right and so the
[50:12] complex
[50:14] it's a core pattern of emotions memories
[50:17] perceptions those are the building
[50:19] blocks that go into it
[50:21] it's wishes and it's in our subconscious
[50:25] realm it's
[50:26] not something that we think about
[50:29] because if you thought about it you
[50:30] wouldn't you wouldn't think like that
[50:32] but it's subconscious many times that
[50:34] you
[50:35] these thoughts these uh these attitudes
[50:38] these emotions these memories
[50:40] and they come in to make you prejudiced
[50:42] in a certain way
[50:44] so a complex is and when i begin to
[50:46] think about a complex i think of the
[50:48] pentagon complex which is
[50:50] a military complex what that means is a
[50:53] building
[50:54] or a group of buildings used for
[50:57] a purpose and it's there to what what
[51:00] does that do it directs
[51:01] all of the activity for the military so
[51:04] out of that complex every spy
[51:08] every soldier in all parts of the world
[51:11] out of there comes wars in the middle
[51:12] east
[51:14] right out of there comes comes
[51:18] raids on different parts of the world
[51:20] out of there comes ships going to asia
[51:23] and everything the plans
[51:24] come from the complex and if you watch
[51:28] your life and you find yourself with
[51:30] with bitterness or or with you you find
[51:33] yourself
[51:33] reaching out and lashing out in a way
[51:35] you say what was that
[51:36] i'm not that way that's not me i'm a
[51:39] christian
[51:40] you find yourself doing something taking
[51:42] an action that you wouldn't otherwise
[51:44] take
[51:45] it started at the complex
[51:48] right it was the complex that you built
[51:51] up something
[51:52] and that's what caused you to react in
[51:54] that way
[51:56] and you know maybe that it's not
[51:58] biblical to do that but it's just
[52:00] and if we're not careful we just
[52:01] accepted it well it's just who i am
[52:04] but but that was something that we have
[52:06] to tear down
[52:08] because it's very hard once a complex
[52:10] gets built
[52:12] to take it out it won't just leave on
[52:14] its own
[52:15] you've got to tear it down so a complex
[52:19] is the headquarters for what you do
[52:23] right and so it's not just a passing
[52:25] thing but
[52:26] it makes what makes you tick it's what
[52:28] makes you the way that you are
[52:30] there's people who've never been to
[52:32] church won't go in a message church yet
[52:35] they say they believe the message
[52:37] why that action comes from the complex
[52:41] right it gets sent out through there
[52:43] they may not even understand why
[52:45] but there's a complex there's something
[52:47] that where they've been done wrong
[52:48] they've had
[52:49] emotions and and and problems maybe with
[52:52] a preacher or somebody else and
[52:53] it causes the complex to send out a
[52:57] signal or an action
[52:58] to do a certain thing
[53:02] it's the headquarters for bitterness
[53:06] is a complex the headquarters for your
[53:09] war against humanity
[53:12] right you're wondering why people treat
[53:14] people the way that they do
[53:16] on the road in a grocery store at work
[53:21] it comes from the complex and a complex
[53:24] is built
[53:26] around emotional damage now
[53:29] when the pentagon complex was built
[53:32] blight eisenhower gave a speech after
[53:35] that when he
[53:36] left the presidency and that was built
[53:38] during the second world war and there's
[53:40] always a reason why we build what we
[53:42] build
[53:44] right the things that we what we are we
[53:46] may not realize it but we're
[53:48] we're becoming what we are for a reason
[53:50] we are
[53:51] maybe you are careful around in a
[53:53] certain situation
[53:55] you're careful maybe you were chased by
[53:58] a dog brother brown gives an example of
[53:59] that in discernment you were chased by a
[54:01] dog when you're little and
[54:02] it caused the fear to come on you of
[54:03] dogs maybe i have a fear of the water
[54:06] and just as far as swimming in it i i've
[54:09] never
[54:10] been able to swim and and my dad i think
[54:12] was the same way and it just kind of
[54:14] gets
[54:14] passed on but it builds up kind of a
[54:16] complex where you really believe that
[54:18] you can't do it there's no reason why
[54:19] you can't
[54:20] but it's just a it's a complex that's
[54:23] built up and
[54:24] and so a lot of times there's some
[54:26] reason for that
[54:28] and the second world war was the reason
[54:29] for the pentagon and
[54:31] and dwight eisenhower began to speak of
[54:33] that as the
[54:34] military industrial complex it was the
[54:38] idea that
[54:40] if we're not careful as americans that
[54:42] will feed this
[54:43] war machine because it's profitable
[54:47] right and so he says the potential for
[54:50] the disastrous rise of misplaced power
[54:53] exists
[54:54] and will persist because the truth is a
[54:57] lot of people died in world war
[54:58] ii but there were some people who were
[55:00] sad it was over
[55:03] you know who it was the guys who were on
[55:06] the factories
[55:09] they they they were they were sad they
[55:11] were they were unhappy that it was over
[55:14] the guys who were making millions and
[55:15] billions off of arms
[55:19] right and the world war ii lifted us out
[55:22] of a depression
[55:24] right and so what happened is we become
[55:26] addicted to that and then it went into
[55:28] the cold war and the vietnam war and
[55:30] every war since and the thing and i'm
[55:32] not here to talk about politics that's
[55:33] not what it's about but i want you to
[55:34] think about a complex
[55:36] something that's been built something
[55:38] that's entrenched a
[55:40] fortress that's there and it's something
[55:42] you think you need
[55:45] it's not something you think you don't
[55:46] need or you get rid of it
[55:49] right but it's something you think you
[55:50] need to survive
[55:53] but the truth is you'd probably survive
[55:55] without it
[55:57] in fact you definitely would survive
[56:00] without your complex
[56:02] but it's built around emotional damage
[56:04] hurts disappointments fears
[56:07] an example of a complex would be it and
[56:10] this is in psychology they say the
[56:12] example of one would be if one had a leg
[56:13] amputated when he was a child
[56:15] it would influence his life in profound
[56:17] ways even if they overcame the physical
[56:20] handicap a person would have thoughts
[56:21] emotions memories
[56:23] feelings of inferiority triumphs
[56:25] bitterness determinations
[56:27] centering on that one aspect of his or
[56:29] her life
[56:30] many people carry complexes from high
[56:32] school
[56:34] i carried a little bit of a complex
[56:35] because i didn't go to high school
[56:39] but some people carry complexes from
[56:40] that people carry complexes from the way
[56:43] that they're raised and don't even
[56:44] realize it
[56:46] and most of those have an element of
[56:48] truth
[56:49] but the structure that you built is a
[56:52] lie
[56:54] now think about this for a moment look
[56:56] look at elijah in the bible
[56:59] first kings chapter 19 and verse 9
[57:01] speaks of elijah and says he came to the
[57:03] unto a cave and lodged there and behold
[57:05] the word of the lord came to him and he
[57:06] said unto him
[57:07] what doest thou hear elijah now there's
[57:10] a loaded question
[57:12] and he said i've been very jealous for
[57:13] the lord god of hosts
[57:15] he had been that was true for the
[57:18] children of israel have forsaken that
[57:19] covenant thrown down thine altars
[57:21] saying thy prophets with the sword well
[57:24] that was true partially
[57:27] but the truth is the last prophet said
[57:29] slain with the sword was baal's prophets
[57:33] go look it was right after that that he
[57:35] killed all the prophets of baal now
[57:38] but that's mostly true that's true of
[57:39] the children of israel that just in
[57:41] general they were that way
[57:43] and then he says and i even i only am
[57:45] left
[57:47] that's not right
[57:50] you see there's an element of truth and
[57:52] then he builds a complex on it
[57:55] right somebody did something there was
[57:57] somebody hated him jezebel hated his
[57:59] guts
[57:59] we could say it that way jezebel hated
[58:02] him
[58:02] and the truth is as we live in life and
[58:05] just being a christian there's people
[58:06] who just hate you for being a christian
[58:07] that's
[58:08] true but when you build that into
[58:12] i even i only am left that's the lie
[58:18] right and that's what you you have to
[58:19] tear that down
[58:22] and to do that see but we were rooted in
[58:24] this truth and say well i've been
[58:25] treated badly
[58:26] so i'm the only one left the children of
[58:29] israel are like this so i'm the only one
[58:31] left
[58:32] and he said and they seek my life to
[58:34] take it away all that is true except
[58:36] the part where he says i'm the only one
[58:38] left
[58:40] and we know it's not true because in
[58:42] first kings 19 18 it says yet i have
[58:45] left me
[58:45] seven thousand in israel that's quite a
[58:48] few more than one
[58:51] right he says i'm the only one
[58:54] right and we're glad that every the
[58:56] seven thousand are glad
[58:58] that everything that he elijah said
[59:00] wasn't thus saith the lord
[59:04] because if it was they'd be out
[59:07] right but he said i'm the only one left
[59:08] and and here
[59:10] the here he coming and they said god
[59:13] said but there's 7 000
[59:15] left he said these which have not bowed
[59:18] unto baal every mouth which has not
[59:19] kissed him now that wasn't a majority he
[59:21] wasn't close to a majority
[59:22] wasn't even a very healthy minority but
[59:25] it was a lot more than one
[59:28] right and god's got a lot more than one
[59:30] left today
[59:33] but but i've seen preachers get hurt
[59:36] and i'll go to preachers because that's
[59:38] that's where i come from and maybe you
[59:39] can apply it to your life but you get
[59:41] hurt
[59:42] and then you begin to think well maybe
[59:43] i'm the only one that really believes it
[59:45] right
[59:46] i'm the only one that really teaches it
[59:48] right and pretty soon you build lies
[59:51] on top of that truth and when you get
[59:54] done
[59:55] the complex controls your ministry
[59:59] the way the military-industrial complex
[1:00:01] controls war
[1:00:05] right and if you're not careful the
[1:00:07] complex controls your life
[1:00:10] the way the military-industrial complex
[1:00:12] controls war that
[1:00:13] when it gets too peaceful it's not they
[1:00:15] don't like it the complex don't like
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:18] so it upsets you it makes you mad and
[1:00:21] makes you angry
[1:00:22] makes you look for perceived slights
[1:00:25] makes you look to try to make you think
[1:00:27] the pastor don't love you the church
[1:00:28] don't love you
[1:00:29] everybody's against you nobody cares
[1:00:31] about you you see what i'm saying this
[1:00:33] morning
[1:00:34] it's just based on that complex and
[1:00:36] you've got to tear all of that down
[1:00:40] and the truth is it starts with truth
[1:00:43] but it turns into a lie now
[1:00:46] it's a conscious decision based on an
[1:00:49] unconscious prejudice so
[1:00:51] you're doing things consciously but you
[1:00:52] don't really know why
[1:00:54] and it's because of this complex now
[1:00:57] maybe
[1:00:57] you were treated badly by someone in
[1:00:59] authority
[1:01:01] sadly many people are someone who you
[1:01:04] trusted betrayed you
[1:01:06] you may consciously forgive that person
[1:01:09] in your mind you may say i forgive them
[1:01:12] but in your spirit there's a continuing
[1:01:14] mistrust of people with authority
[1:01:17] and you sit in church and the preacher
[1:01:19] says something like
[1:01:20] there's people in this place that need
[1:01:22] to be born again
[1:01:27] sit back and say well i don't know what
[1:01:30] he's preaching about
[1:01:34] i was born again 45 years ago i'll have
[1:01:38] you know
[1:01:39] i was there when it happened right well
[1:01:42] maybe he wasn't preaching to you
[1:01:45] right and just as a general statement by
[1:01:47] the way you could say that in
[1:01:49] every audience over about seven or eight
[1:01:50] people because you're not going to know
[1:01:52] everybody's life
[1:01:53] maybe even in that small of an audience
[1:01:55] but you could say somebody in here needs
[1:01:57] to be born again and it would be true
[1:02:00] right in most audiences it would fit
[1:02:03] somebody
[1:02:04] that don't take much discernment to know
[1:02:06] that you could say there's three kinds
[1:02:08] of believers
[1:02:11] and somebody sit there and get offended
[1:02:13] well he called me an unbeliever well no
[1:02:16] not at all number one you're giving the
[1:02:18] preacher too much credit
[1:02:20] because he doesn't know your life right
[1:02:24] it's not that saith the lord and so
[1:02:26] he's just trying to repeat what the
[1:02:28] scripture says and what the message of
[1:02:29] the hour says
[1:02:31] so the preacher says some people in this
[1:02:32] place need to be born again and the
[1:02:34] devil begins to whisper in your ear
[1:02:36] and and tell you well he doesn't think
[1:02:38] you're born again
[1:02:40] and the next service you go to church
[1:02:41] and the same preacher doesn't shake your
[1:02:43] hand
[1:02:46] well the preacher really said that but
[1:02:49] for some reason you've got this problem
[1:02:51] with
[1:02:52] for whatever reason it is you may not
[1:02:53] know why but you
[1:02:55] you kind of you've got a spot there that
[1:02:58] you've
[1:02:58] kind of kept guarded maybe somebody was
[1:03:01] a legalist in your
[1:03:02] past life and treated you manhandled you
[1:03:04] with words
[1:03:06] and so you sit there and and you
[1:03:09] constantly guard that place now somebody
[1:03:10] says well some
[1:03:11] someone in here needs to be born again
[1:03:13] you see well he's preaching at me
[1:03:15] that's the first brick the first piece
[1:03:17] of lumber
[1:03:18] you're building the complex all right
[1:03:21] and then the next service he doesn't
[1:03:22] shake your hand
[1:03:24] right which right now that's most of you
[1:03:29] just because we're not really shaking
[1:03:30] hands much around here but
[1:03:32] but you know because of the not want to
[1:03:35] spread anything but that's
[1:03:36] you know you could say that you take
[1:03:38] that as a slight well he didn't shake my
[1:03:40] hand
[1:03:41] and then maybe you call and he doesn't
[1:03:42] answer well you don't know why
[1:03:46] right you don't know why you just but
[1:03:49] but in your mind
[1:03:50] that's another brick and then maybe
[1:03:53] you're gone for a couple weeks and
[1:03:54] nobody says anything
[1:03:56] it's another brick it's another stone
[1:03:59] and
[1:04:00] you get to feeling like well they don't
[1:04:02] care if i'm there or not i might as well
[1:04:04] not be there
[1:04:06] huh and you don't know why it might be
[1:04:10] that people don't care but it's probably
[1:04:12] not
[1:04:13] especially in a church of this size we
[1:04:15] need every one of you
[1:04:18] we need every person sitting here i'm
[1:04:20] not gonna run
[1:04:22] that would be suicide for me to just
[1:04:23] start running people off why would i do
[1:04:25] that on purpose
[1:04:27] we've got to stand for the word but i'm
[1:04:29] not going to put you out of the church
[1:04:31] or treat you bad you know on purpose
[1:04:35] right and so but but you take that and i
[1:04:38] don't know of any situation like that
[1:04:39] but i'm using that as an example
[1:04:42] what is it material for the complex
[1:04:43] you're building maybe you went
[1:04:45] christmas time and you've always felt
[1:04:47] like an outcast at the in-laws house
[1:04:52] you go to the inlaw's house and you sit
[1:04:53] down at the christmas table
[1:04:55] and somebody says something or maybe
[1:04:56] they don't say something about the dish
[1:04:58] you brought or whatever
[1:04:59] and it makes you just feel worse and you
[1:05:01] added the final brick to that complex
[1:05:03] you can't get out of it anymore
[1:05:05] and you can't enjoy dinner you can't you
[1:05:08] you can't enjoy even being around them
[1:05:09] anymore why you build a complex
[1:05:14] many times we build complexes around
[1:05:15] disappointments brother branham
[1:05:17] says this in the restoration of the
[1:05:18] bride tree he said so the people are
[1:05:20] disappointed he said i would be too
[1:05:22] and he's talking about people that
[1:05:23] wanted to be prayed for and couldn't be
[1:05:25] prayed for
[1:05:26] and that was a lot of people and go back
[1:05:29] and listen to the prayer lines they were
[1:05:31] wonderful
[1:05:31] but most of the people didn't get prayed
[1:05:33] for
[1:05:35] even most of the people lined up didn't
[1:05:36] get prayed for
[1:05:38] have you ever thought about this how
[1:05:39] would you feel there's two people i
[1:05:41] always felt sorry for in the prayer
[1:05:42] lines
[1:05:43] one was the one that brother branham
[1:05:44] says would you believe if i didn't
[1:05:46] say anything about you and just go on
[1:05:48] now you know they say yes they would
[1:05:50] believe but they feel kind of bad that
[1:05:51] he didn't discern their heart
[1:05:53] like he did everybody else's and then
[1:05:56] the other one i always felt sorry for
[1:05:57] was that next person in line
[1:06:00] right this person gets healed and and
[1:06:03] brother billy paul whoever was takes him
[1:06:05] away from the
[1:06:06] platform and the next person in line
[1:06:08] just standing there
[1:06:09] and i've heard stories of people who
[1:06:10] went over and over again and never did
[1:06:12] get prayed for
[1:06:13] and there were times brother branham
[1:06:14] tried to pray for them all but it's just
[1:06:16] physically impossible to do it
[1:06:18] so he said so the people are
[1:06:19] disappointed he said i would be too he
[1:06:21] said but
[1:06:21] he said i'd just like on this easter
[1:06:23] morning to make in my confession
[1:06:26] to say that i don't know what to do
[1:06:27] about it
[1:06:30] that's a good confession for a preacher
[1:06:31] to make sometimes he said there's just
[1:06:33] too many you know to get to thousands
[1:06:35] and thousands
[1:06:37] he said the people around the world he
[1:06:38] said i've taken my seventh trip
[1:06:41] he said around as you know and i have a
[1:06:43] personal contact he said
[1:06:46] i have in personal contact with better
[1:06:48] than 10 million people from around the
[1:06:49] world
[1:06:51] he said so you can imagine how it what a
[1:06:53] strain that is on you
[1:06:55] he said many times we hit little strains
[1:06:56] he said i know you do
[1:06:58] too and little disappointments
[1:07:01] how many people have ever been
[1:07:02] disappointed here
[1:07:04] well now there's an opportunity to build
[1:07:06] a complex
[1:07:08] right now look this one he says but
[1:07:10] think of them i have
[1:07:12] he said the disappointments i have when
[1:07:14] sick mother's on the phone
[1:07:15] listen to what he says i feel so bad for
[1:07:17] the mother and for brother branham in
[1:07:19] this situation
[1:07:21] because he said there's sick mothers on
[1:07:22] the phone they're saying oh god
[1:07:24] well wait just a minute brother branham
[1:07:26] and then they start praying lord jesus
[1:07:28] i pray that you'll send him he's on the
[1:07:31] phone
[1:07:31] you know what do you do about that maybe
[1:07:33] it's in another country
[1:07:35] in another place another state and their
[1:07:37] little baby is dying
[1:07:39] and and saying oh god wait wait just a
[1:07:41] minute brother branham lord jesus i pray
[1:07:43] that you'll send him
[1:07:44] he said i just hung up on the phone from
[1:07:46] another one and here and here and here
[1:07:48] all around the world he said you know
[1:07:49] how it is he said that's not easy when
[1:07:52] somebody in the end of the phone with a
[1:07:53] sick baby or a sick husband or a dying
[1:07:55] wife
[1:07:56] praying for you to come he said now you
[1:07:58] can imagine he said no wonder i'm a
[1:08:00] neurotic
[1:08:01] he said it's enough to make one he said
[1:08:04] but i have done this one thing now
[1:08:06] listen to this
[1:08:07] he said instead of getting a complex
[1:08:09] i've tried to hold steady
[1:08:12] by keeping my eyes on calvary
[1:08:15] and moving on because you can't pray for
[1:08:18] everybody
[1:08:20] not everybody is going to be healed that
[1:08:21] you do pray for
[1:08:23] but you keep your eyes on calvary and
[1:08:24] keep moving on
[1:08:26] and that's what we have to do church as
[1:08:28] a church we can't help everybody
[1:08:30] we want to help everybody but we can't
[1:08:32] help everybody but we keep our eyes on
[1:08:34] calvary
[1:08:35] and remember it's up to him anyway he
[1:08:38] said as many
[1:08:39] he won't lose the one so we'll help
[1:08:41] everybody that we can help
[1:08:43] but those that we can't help that we
[1:08:44] can't get to we leave those in god's
[1:08:46] hands
[1:08:48] he said i've done this one thing instead
[1:08:49] of getting a complex i've tried to hold
[1:08:51] steady
[1:08:51] by keeping my eyes on calvary and moving
[1:08:53] on just as he would have me
[1:08:56] to do he said in many of my mistakes i
[1:08:59] pray that god will forgive me of things
[1:09:02] maybe i should have went one place and
[1:09:03] didn't go he said i'm just human
[1:09:05] i'm subject to mistakes now i want you
[1:09:08] to notice
[1:09:10] that no one else but you i guess
[1:09:14] but you is unnecessary there no one else
[1:09:17] can build your complex
[1:09:21] you ever thought about that brother ben
[1:09:23] i have a complex you built it
[1:09:28] no that's not that's humans that's what
[1:09:29] we do
[1:09:31] right we all do it but you built it
[1:09:36] i didn't build your complex the deacons
[1:09:39] can't build your complex the trustees
[1:09:41] can
[1:09:42] your wife can't build your complex
[1:09:46] you build it are you with me now
[1:09:51] and so you can learn a lot about how to
[1:09:53] tear down a fortress by finding out who
[1:09:55] built it
[1:09:57] right and it's got a name on it on every
[1:10:00] brick it says you
[1:10:03] right every brick of a complex that i
[1:10:05] would have
[1:10:06] i built it i built that
[1:10:11] as a former president said you didn't
[1:10:12] build that well you did build your
[1:10:14] complex
[1:10:16] right that that's a little bit harsh i
[1:10:20] know but we've got to understand this
[1:10:23] brother random says it this way about
[1:10:25] himself because he said here he didn't
[1:10:26] build a complex about that one thing but
[1:10:28] he did build a complex about something
[1:10:30] else and he said i had built myself a
[1:10:34] complex
[1:10:35] because the people didn't hear my
[1:10:36] message
[1:10:38] look what he says i had built myself
[1:10:42] a complex it's true the people didn't
[1:10:45] hear the message just like it was true
[1:10:47] that the people were in a bad shape and
[1:10:49] they were trying to kill elijah
[1:10:51] but he built the complex that he was the
[1:10:53] only one
[1:10:56] that was elijah that built that
[1:11:00] it was you look at that spirit of elijah
[1:11:01] coming down through john and john built
[1:11:03] his own complex
[1:11:04] when he said behold the lamb of god
[1:11:06] takes away the sin of the world and then
[1:11:07] he sends out his disciples said are you
[1:11:09] here do we wait for another right and he
[1:11:12] was the one who saw him
[1:11:13] that spirit of god come down on him like
[1:11:15] a dove and all the things happened and
[1:11:17] if anybody should have been sure it
[1:11:19] should have been john but his eagle eye
[1:11:21] got filmed over and he built a complex
[1:11:23] in prison
[1:11:23] and he said are you really him and
[1:11:25] brother brown said i built myself a
[1:11:27] complex because the people didn't hear
[1:11:29] my message notice brother brown doesn't
[1:11:31] blame the people but he does
[1:11:33] understand the reason this is why i
[1:11:35] can't change that
[1:11:38] but i can tear down the complex
[1:11:41] i can't change the fact that the people
[1:11:44] won't hear my message
[1:11:47] i hope you're listening to me today you
[1:11:49] can't change
[1:11:50] you know you get into a marriage and you
[1:11:52] realize that person maybe there's
[1:11:53] certain things about them you wish would
[1:11:54] change you wish
[1:11:56] it would have changed for 30 years
[1:11:59] but you can't change that but you can
[1:12:02] tear down your complex
[1:12:07] elijah built elijah's complex brother
[1:12:09] branham built brother branham's complex
[1:12:11] i built mine
[1:12:13] you build yours the hurt can be there
[1:12:16] the pain can be there
[1:12:18] but if i don't build on it it won't ever
[1:12:20] be a complex
[1:12:22] huh if if i
[1:12:26] if i leave it alone if i don't get mad
[1:12:28] every time
[1:12:30] somebody doesn't speak to me and and you
[1:12:32] know if if i consciously walk away from
[1:12:34] those things if i don't let
[1:12:37] other people destroy my joy and take
[1:12:38] away my happiness
[1:12:43] but the problem is we build it many
[1:12:44] times subconsciously before we even
[1:12:46] realize that it's built
[1:12:50] then we're looking back and said now
[1:12:51] what do i do with that
[1:12:55] it's hard for me to sit in church
[1:12:56] because i built such a complex
[1:12:59] that people don't like me that
[1:13:01] everything sounds bad
[1:13:02] you know what'll happen when you build a
[1:13:03] complex against somebody they can't that
[1:13:05] person won't be able to sing
[1:13:07] preach pray or say hello
[1:13:10] without you thinking about that complex
[1:13:15] all right they won't be able to do
[1:13:16] anything every everything they do is
[1:13:18] going to be wrong because
[1:13:19] because of a complex you build and that
[1:13:20] person may not be the best person in the
[1:13:22] world
[1:13:22] but as we said about job sometimes god
[1:13:24] allows people like job's wife to say
[1:13:27] curse god and die and he said you speak
[1:13:30] like a foolish woman
[1:13:32] not you are a foolish woman but you
[1:13:34] speak like one
[1:13:36] why he wasn't going to build a complex
[1:13:38] out of it
[1:13:42] how do you tear a complex down number
[1:13:44] one you don't play with it
[1:13:47] you got to get serious about it don't
[1:13:49] baby it
[1:13:51] well i can't do that and so many people
[1:13:54] give names to their complexes
[1:13:55] complexes and worship them today
[1:13:58] and call it whatever syndrome they want
[1:14:01] to call it
[1:14:02] and it's just a complex and they've
[1:14:05] given it a name and they worship it and
[1:14:06] say well this is the way i am
[1:14:07] this is what it is and i've taken 49
[1:14:10] facebook personality tests and they all
[1:14:12] tell me i'm this way
[1:14:13] you know what they're going to tell you
[1:14:14] they're going to tell you what you put
[1:14:15] in
[1:14:18] you know how those tests know what you
[1:14:20] are they know because that's what you
[1:14:21] think you are
[1:14:23] but that doesn't mean that's what you
[1:14:24] have to be
[1:14:27] right you say well i i just i i just
[1:14:30] hold on to it because it gives us a
[1:14:31] feeling of security it's the pentagon
[1:14:36] some people build little forts other
[1:14:37] people people build a pentagon
[1:14:41] they got great big walls and they've got
[1:14:43] all kinds of security and spies going
[1:14:45] out everywhere
[1:14:46] see if people care about them or not see
[1:14:48] if people love them or not
[1:14:50] and the truth is you'd feel so much more
[1:14:52] loved if you quit sending out spies
[1:14:55] you'd feel so much more cared for if you
[1:14:57] quit looking at facebook like it was
[1:14:58] like it was the next person that said
[1:15:00] anything negative was gonna you were
[1:15:02] gonna die
[1:15:03] maybe if you quit looking at facebook at
[1:15:05] all
[1:15:08] because every time you look at it it
[1:15:09] builds it feeds into your complex
[1:15:12] they didn't say nothing about me they
[1:15:13] didn't like my picture they didn't say
[1:15:15] nothing about my children
[1:15:16] and so it just keeps building and
[1:15:17] building and building until finally you
[1:15:19] built the pentagon you don't know how to
[1:15:21] tear it down
[1:15:21] now what do i do with this huh
[1:15:25] you said pastor what do i do with it
[1:15:27] well number one
[1:15:29] you gotta quit baby in it because the
[1:15:32] complex will destroy you if you let it
[1:15:35] and you built it got to tear it down
[1:15:40] you're not hurting nobody but yourself i
[1:15:43] read a story i may have
[1:15:44] told it to you before about a farmer
[1:15:46] that was
[1:15:48] doing kind of a tow service on the side
[1:15:50] because people would cars would break
[1:15:51] down out on the country road and
[1:15:53] a car broke down out on the country road
[1:15:55] the bra the something went out
[1:15:57] in it and ran out of water or something
[1:15:59] like that and antifreeze something
[1:16:00] happened and and they found a farmer
[1:16:03] they said
[1:16:04] what do you charge us he said ten bucks
[1:16:07] on the ride
[1:16:07] after they got back to the service
[1:16:09] station the wife was just fuming
[1:16:11] husband and wife in the car she's just
[1:16:13] fuming she said i can't believe he
[1:16:14] charged us ten bucks to just go back to
[1:16:15] the service station
[1:16:17] of course that's been a lot of years ago
[1:16:18] be a lot more now i can't believe you
[1:16:20] charged us 10 bucks
[1:16:22] her husband said that's okay i kept my
[1:16:24] brakes on the whole time
[1:16:31] all he got out of that was burn up
[1:16:32] brakes you know the guy in the truck
[1:16:35] might have felt minutes are hard this is
[1:16:36] the hardest toe i've ever had
[1:16:38] but he towed it man it didn't hurt him
[1:16:42] it hurt it tore up their brakes that's
[1:16:45] what grudges are doing
[1:16:47] that's what bitterness is doing it don't
[1:16:48] hurt them
[1:16:50] you put the brakes on and and make the
[1:16:53] the minister drag you make the church
[1:16:55] drag you make
[1:16:56] your family drag you along and you got
[1:16:57] the brakes on the whole way but
[1:16:59] boy i taught them a lesson they can't do
[1:17:01] that to me no
[1:17:03] no they can't you did that to you
[1:17:09] brother brandon built such a complex you
[1:17:11] can go and you've heard about it before
[1:17:12] i'm sure you've been read the quotes
[1:17:14] where
[1:17:14] he built this complex because the people
[1:17:16] wouldn't listen to him
[1:17:18] and he had a dream about how that a bomb
[1:17:20] and different things like that and
[1:17:21] him being a bomb and in standing in the
[1:17:24] gap he confesses all of that and he says
[1:17:26] and a voice got to talking
[1:17:27] he said i was talking to him it said
[1:17:30] carry out your plans you'll be like that
[1:17:32] he was a prophet of god ordained by god
[1:17:37] but he had to tear down this complex
[1:17:41] he said carry out your plans you'll be
[1:17:42] like that i said lord i don't want to be
[1:17:45] like that said
[1:17:46] your wife will go too she won't live up
[1:17:49] there in them hills like that
[1:17:51] he said you'll become a bum just as the
[1:17:53] dream showed
[1:17:54] that you would imagine a prophet
[1:17:58] of god becoming a bum how could that
[1:18:00] ever happen
[1:18:01] well it's because he built himself a
[1:18:02] complex
[1:18:04] and if he'd have kept building on it
[1:18:09] but see he recognized it existed now
[1:18:10] this is important god had to show him
[1:18:13] this is where you're going to end up and
[1:18:15] sometimes god uses a minister to do that
[1:18:17] sometimes he uses a family member
[1:18:18] sometimes somebody else
[1:18:19] that one day we wake up and realize hey
[1:18:22] i got the pentagon i got to do something
[1:18:23] with it
[1:18:26] i've built a fortress here and it don't
[1:18:28] need to be there it's keeping me from
[1:18:29] joy
[1:18:30] it's keeping me from happiness it's
[1:18:31] keeping me from being all that i was
[1:18:33] created to be in god
[1:18:36] and so you recognize that it exists
[1:18:37] that's the first step
[1:18:40] this is something i created i need to
[1:18:42] tear it down
[1:18:43] and so brother branham in that message
[1:18:45] standing in the gap he said god bless
[1:18:46] you each one
[1:18:47] we hope to see you again real soon he
[1:18:49] said till then will you do this one
[1:18:50] favor for me
[1:18:51] both here and on tapes also you brethren
[1:18:54] he said pray that god will place into my
[1:18:56] heart that's something that i lost out
[1:18:59] there in that complex
[1:19:01] he said it's so easy to build a complex
[1:19:04] and he built one and he tore it down
[1:19:08] but then he said pray that i'll get back
[1:19:10] what i lost
[1:19:12] from those years of thinking through the
[1:19:15] prism of a complex
[1:19:17] all those awards that i started
[1:19:22] all those wars that started at the
[1:19:24] pentagon the complex that i built
[1:19:26] all those wars that i started i wish i
[1:19:28] had never started one
[1:19:30] and he said lord and he said ask the
[1:19:32] people he said would you help me
[1:19:34] would you pray for me that i'll get back
[1:19:36] what i lost in the complex
[1:19:39] amen he said i had an interview the
[1:19:42] other day
[1:19:43] with my brother way sitting here and
[1:19:45] said standing here in front of good man
[1:19:46] but built himself around a complex
[1:19:48] he said another kind of a complex he
[1:19:50] said did the same thing brother way
[1:19:53] you can so easily do it it's you just
[1:19:56] get a little something in your mind keep
[1:19:57] thinking that way now i've learned
[1:19:59] that and i like to i like to say
[1:20:02] something to somebody if i see somebody
[1:20:03] i see brother isaac sitting here
[1:20:05] and changing his hair he's probably
[1:20:06] waiting on me to say something about it
[1:20:08] his beard and
[1:20:09] i'd like to say something if i see
[1:20:10] something like that i i say something
[1:20:12] about it but
[1:20:14] you have to be careful doing that
[1:20:16] because if a person sitting over the
[1:20:17] complex they get mad
[1:20:20] i know sister fritz doesn't have a
[1:20:22] complex about this so i wouldn't have
[1:20:23] said it last week about her age but i
[1:20:24] got her age wrong
[1:20:26] i said she was 86 i think she's 87.
[1:20:31] now we've made it twice as bad haven't
[1:20:33] we
[1:20:35] but it's so easy to build a complex
[1:20:38] so brother branham calls out brother
[1:20:40] away and says by the way you had a
[1:20:41] complex too
[1:20:44] and now listen what brother branham says
[1:20:45] he said you he said you can do so easily
[1:20:48] do it if you just get a little something
[1:20:50] in your mind and keep thinking that way
[1:20:52] he said go back and check it with the
[1:20:54] scripture
[1:20:58] is this making me more like jesus is
[1:21:01] this giving me the fruits of the spirit
[1:21:03] is this attitude is this making me reach
[1:21:05] out for my brother
[1:21:06] or what's it doing to me
[1:21:10] go back and check it with the scripture
[1:21:12] see if it's right or not
[1:21:13] and then go from there on amen he said
[1:21:16] yeah he said don't lose the feeling of
[1:21:18] the people see
[1:21:20] he said you must remember they're not
[1:21:22] made out of sawdust
[1:21:24] they are flesh and blood human beings
[1:21:27] and a soul
[1:21:30] now if you don't believe that a prophet
[1:21:32] can hurt someone's feelings
[1:21:33] look at what happens next
[1:21:37] after brother branham and standing in
[1:21:38] the gap tells about his complex and said
[1:21:40] brother way you've got one
[1:21:42] too
[1:21:45] by the way fell over dead had a heart
[1:21:48] attack
[1:21:50] right in the service and of course
[1:21:54] i need to be careful not to offend
[1:21:56] someone that much
[1:21:57] because we we have to be able to raise
[1:22:00] the dead if we do
[1:22:05] but he he he was so shocked by being
[1:22:07] called out over the pulpit or whatever
[1:22:09] that it was so brother branham
[1:22:11] he said don't lose said don't lose the
[1:22:12] feeling of the people you must remember
[1:22:13] he said they're not made out of sawdust
[1:22:16] he said they are flesh and blood human
[1:22:17] beings and a soul so that night flashing
[1:22:20] red light is a sign of his coming he
[1:22:21] said this morning i had preached at
[1:22:22] length
[1:22:23] way over my time tired and warned he
[1:22:25] said there could be two things
[1:22:27] speaking of brother way he said he
[1:22:28] either got tired he said or when i spoke
[1:22:30] of having a complex not just to mess my
[1:22:32] brother up as we'd say it but
[1:22:34] he said because i was making my
[1:22:36] confession of having complex
[1:22:38] he said i guess if i'd ask tonight in
[1:22:40] this audience of people how many in here
[1:22:41] knows you have
[1:22:42] complex he said practically every hand
[1:22:44] would go up
[1:22:46] we won't do that this morning we don't
[1:22:47] want anybody fall over dead
[1:22:50] but he said that you might know brother
[1:22:52] way just let me show you whether it's
[1:22:53] discernment or not how many knows that
[1:22:54] you got a complex raise your hand he
[1:22:55] said look it there see
[1:22:58] he said but i don't know if that shock
[1:22:59] of me saying that to brother way
[1:23:01] taking it like i might be rebuking him
[1:23:02] or something then he fell into that
[1:23:04] condition
[1:23:04] and the lord jesus brought him back he
[1:23:06] said then it might have been this
[1:23:08] i love this he said that i've tried to
[1:23:09] think of it this afternoon that i had
[1:23:11] stood here
[1:23:12] with all my heart told you exactly the
[1:23:14] truth tell you of my conflicts make my
[1:23:16] open confession
[1:23:18] and i ask you to pray that my inside
[1:23:19] being would be changed towards the
[1:23:21] people
[1:23:22] that i could do as the lord did and to
[1:23:24] confirm that he will still send me to
[1:23:26] the field
[1:23:26] he let that happen to show that he still
[1:23:28] heals the sick
[1:23:30] and raise up the dead amen
[1:23:35] my sister sarah had a liver transplant
[1:23:39] and and as i remember it she had a tumor
[1:23:42] on her bile duct that goes to her liver
[1:23:46] and first she had surgery when she was
[1:23:48] just a few months old a couple months
[1:23:49] old to remove
[1:23:50] the the tumor was the size of a
[1:23:52] grapefruit
[1:23:54] and they had surgery in kansas city to
[1:23:55] remove that and when they went into
[1:23:57] surgery i remember
[1:23:58] them coming out and telling us that
[1:24:02] her liver was hard as a rock
[1:24:05] but there was nothing wrong with the
[1:24:06] liver in itself but it was this
[1:24:08] this bile duct had been stopped up so it
[1:24:11] wasn't getting what it was supposed to
[1:24:12] be getting
[1:24:14] and it just become hard
[1:24:17] that's the way a complex is that's what
[1:24:19] it does to your inner being
[1:24:21] it's what it does to your heart it makes
[1:24:24] it where it stops up the
[1:24:26] flow of the holy spirit in and out of
[1:24:29] your life
[1:24:30] it's the flow of love and joy and peace
[1:24:32] and so when you get the complex out you
[1:24:34] tear down the complex you find that
[1:24:36] there's a hard heart there
[1:24:39] but what do you do lord take it out of
[1:24:41] me what did she have she had a
[1:24:42] transplant took the old one out put a
[1:24:44] new
[1:24:45] fresh healthy one in
[1:24:48] what do you have to do take the old one
[1:24:49] out let the new one come in
[1:24:51] let his spirit come down and just make
[1:24:53] you new make
[1:24:54] and that's what brother brown was
[1:24:55] praying about he said ask you to pray my
[1:24:57] inside being would be changed towards
[1:24:58] the people that i could do as the lord
[1:25:00] didn't confirm
[1:25:01] that he will send me to the field he let
[1:25:03] that happen to show that he still heals
[1:25:04] the sick now
[1:25:06] listen you can't play with a complex
[1:25:09] or you'll end up dead naturally
[1:25:12] spiritually whatever it is if you mess
[1:25:14] with it you play with it
[1:25:15] you resent when it's called out you you
[1:25:18] hold that back and you're holding on to
[1:25:19] it
[1:25:20] that's my complex that's where i fight
[1:25:21] my wars but you wouldn't need it
[1:25:24] if you didn't have any wars
[1:25:28] and you create your own enemies and see
[1:25:30] god should be our fortress
[1:25:32] the word should be our our defense we
[1:25:35] defend ourselves by the word not behind
[1:25:37] a complex
[1:25:39] and that's why some ministries have
[1:25:41] become just a complex ministry that's
[1:25:43] all they can preach it's the complex
[1:25:44] because they've defended themselves
[1:25:46] behind the complex so long but you've
[1:25:48] got to get out from behind the complex
[1:25:49] and stand behind the word
[1:25:55] storm the castle
[1:25:59] you can't play with it you can't let it
[1:26:01] sit there say well
[1:26:02] i'll deal with it sometime no every day
[1:26:04] you're adding to it
[1:26:05] it's almost a complex is there it's
[1:26:07] building like a cancer cell it's adding
[1:26:09] it's adding it's growing
[1:26:10] it's moving it's spreading every day
[1:26:13] it's building you got to tear it down
[1:26:15] when you realize that you have it that's
[1:26:17] the time to make your confession or
[1:26:18] whatever it is that you need
[1:26:19] whatever complex that it is tear it down
[1:26:22] if it means just walking away from it
[1:26:23] forgetting about it
[1:26:25] tear it down quit taking material from
[1:26:29] people
[1:26:31] run over here and grab some material and
[1:26:32] rushing back and putting it on my
[1:26:33] complex right over here and grab some
[1:26:35] material you're going to find material
[1:26:37] the devil is going to provide you with
[1:26:38] lots of material quit taking it from
[1:26:40] people
[1:26:41] quit building it
[1:26:45] let that be a reality something that you
[1:26:48] can say lord
[1:26:49] i'm done with that storm the complex how
[1:26:51] do you do that
[1:26:52] how do you do that well you built the
[1:26:54] complex with bitterness and with strife
[1:26:55] and with
[1:26:56] with all of these things how do you do
[1:26:59] it you fight a spiritual war
[1:27:01] second corinthians 10 and three for
[1:27:02] though we walk in the flesh
[1:27:04] we do not war after the flesh for the
[1:27:07] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[1:27:09] but mighty through god to the pulling
[1:27:11] down
[1:27:12] of complexes strongholds
[1:27:16] the definition there's a castle a
[1:27:18] stronghold a fortress a fastness
[1:27:20] anything on which one relies the
[1:27:23] arguments and reasonings by which a
[1:27:25] disputant endeavors to fortify his
[1:27:27] opinion and defend it against his
[1:27:29] opponent
[1:27:30] that's what you've used to make your
[1:27:32] argument from but tear it down
[1:27:36] listen what he says so he said the
[1:27:38] pulling down of strongholds
[1:27:40] what do you do you're never going to
[1:27:42] break into a keep or a fortress
[1:27:45] by just standing there and lob and arrow
[1:27:46] at it every now and then
[1:27:48] well on sunday morning i'll repent no
[1:27:50] but monday morning man i'm back at it
[1:27:53] huh what good are you doing you just
[1:27:56] building the places you tore down
[1:27:58] if you build again what you what you
[1:28:00] tore down you're in trouble
[1:28:02] the bible says that so you've got to
[1:28:05] storm it
[1:28:07] right don't let it sit there storm it
[1:28:09] make it uncomfortable
[1:28:13] huh that's hard to do because we take
[1:28:16] comfort sometimes in our complex but
[1:28:17] listen what paul says
[1:28:18] casting down imaginations and you get
[1:28:21] the vivid picture of a soldier running
[1:28:24] up
[1:28:24] onto the walls of the fortress and he
[1:28:26] grabs hold of the garden he throws
[1:28:28] him off pretty graphic isn't it
[1:28:32] that's what you've got to do that
[1:28:34] thought comes up and says
[1:28:36] well they don't like you run up on the
[1:28:37] fortress grab hold of it it says
[1:28:39] i know that my god loves me throw it
[1:28:42] down
[1:28:43] what can man do unto me
[1:28:47] they the complex stands there and says
[1:28:49] but but
[1:28:50] but you don't know they're against you
[1:28:53] and you run up there and says but my god
[1:28:54] is for me and if god
[1:28:56] is for me who can be against me
[1:29:00] are you with me now whatever that was on
[1:29:03] that fortification here there's a guy up
[1:29:05] there and he's
[1:29:06] he's shooting poison darts into your
[1:29:08] soul run up on the complex and tear it
[1:29:10] down
[1:29:12] cast down imaginations they're the
[1:29:14] soldiers in the complex
[1:29:17] imaginations things that
[1:29:20] that word is computation figuratively
[1:29:22] reasoning conscious conceit imagination
[1:29:25] thought cast that down
[1:29:29] reasoning that that that'll get you in a
[1:29:31] lot of trouble you start thinking
[1:29:34] you start thinking you think well
[1:29:36] because
[1:29:37] i've seen preachers do this i think i've
[1:29:38] told you that before but so-and-so
[1:29:40] wasn't at church today
[1:29:42] that's evidently because of what i said
[1:29:44] and the truth is they may not have been
[1:29:46] listening
[1:29:48] to what she said but but i've done this
[1:29:51] it's also wasn't at church it must be
[1:29:52] because of what i said so
[1:29:55] i i better i better not bother them
[1:29:57] because they're probably mad at me
[1:29:59] so you don't pick up the phone you don't
[1:30:01] realize that maybe they got sick maybe
[1:30:02] something happened
[1:30:04] huh maybe they just stayed home
[1:30:09] and you don't know what's going on in
[1:30:10] other people's lives you can do that
[1:30:11] with your own spouse by the way
[1:30:14] you come home and usually you you
[1:30:17] she greets you and just so excited to
[1:30:19] see you and she's not today
[1:30:21] you sit there and say well she gonna
[1:30:24] treat me like that
[1:30:26] i think i'll just move on i think i'll
[1:30:29] just go down and
[1:30:30] and piddle in the garage so you go down
[1:30:32] there and after a while you've gone six
[1:30:33] or seven days you haven't spoken to one
[1:30:35] another nobody knows why
[1:30:38] reasoning computation imaginations
[1:30:41] she must not love me anymore that's
[1:30:43] usually not the reason usually there's
[1:30:45] something else
[1:30:47] so paul continues this military thought
[1:30:49] of rushing a defended keep tearing it
[1:30:51] down
[1:30:51] bringing the thoughts into captivity so
[1:30:53] it's running up on the
[1:30:55] on the hold or the keep running up on
[1:30:57] the castle you run up to the top you
[1:30:58] grab a soldier and imagination and you
[1:31:00] grab hold of him
[1:31:01] he's in captivity right so what's he
[1:31:04] going to do brother sam he's not going
[1:31:05] to move unless you tell him to
[1:31:08] you can't help the thoughts from coming
[1:31:10] around
[1:31:11] they're going to be there the enemy's
[1:31:13] going to be there but he's in captivity
[1:31:16] right you cast down imaginations and
[1:31:18] then you grab hold you take into
[1:31:19] captivity
[1:31:20] every thought because it's the thought
[1:31:22] that led to the imagination
[1:31:24] so the thought comes by and says i'm not
[1:31:26] going to make it grab hold of that
[1:31:28] before it becomes an imagination put it
[1:31:30] in captivity to the word of god
[1:31:34] don't leave the stronghold alone keep
[1:31:38] fighting against it
[1:31:40] what makes the complex break what makes
[1:31:42] us seemingly
[1:31:43] impregnable line of defenses break is
[1:31:45] when the enemy runs at it
[1:31:48] right now when they sit back and then
[1:31:50] fight a trench warfare
[1:31:51] and many of us have been fighting trench
[1:31:53] warfare with our complexes for years but
[1:31:54] you got to run at it
[1:31:56] you got to get serious about it you got
[1:31:58] to begin to begin to dig into it and say
[1:32:00] lord
[1:32:00] i'm ready to be done with this i'm ready
[1:32:03] to be done with it i'm not going to
[1:32:04] think like this anymore i'm not going to
[1:32:06] be like this anymore i'm not going to
[1:32:07] walk this way anymore i'm not going to
[1:32:09] let people get me down like this anymore
[1:32:13] don't leave it there if a complex can be
[1:32:16] built with hurts with love
[1:32:17] or with with hate with disappointments
[1:32:20] with fears it can be
[1:32:21] torn down by love joy and peace
[1:32:25] philippians 4 and 6 says be careful for
[1:32:27] nothing that means be anxious about
[1:32:28] nothing
[1:32:30] there there's a commandment we ought to
[1:32:32] keep
[1:32:33] we want to tell people especially our
[1:32:35] children i like to do this
[1:32:36] the bibles command you to obey me
[1:32:41] the bible says obey your parents and the
[1:32:43] lord for this is right how many of you
[1:32:45] have ever quoted that to your children
[1:32:48] i don't know what the rest of you all
[1:32:49] are doing you know
[1:32:53] i've quoted that to my kids over and
[1:32:54] over what does the bible say
[1:32:57] i like to remind them of that but here's
[1:33:00] a commandment
[1:33:01] be careful for nothing god's saying that
[1:33:05] to us
[1:33:07] be anxious for nothing but in everything
[1:33:11] now see you can't leave that spot vacant
[1:33:14] right you say well i'll just clear my
[1:33:15] mind well guess what will come in
[1:33:17] disappointments fears anxiety
[1:33:20] so what are you going to do you're going
[1:33:21] to fill that spot
[1:33:24] with prayer and supplication in
[1:33:27] everything by prayer and supplication
[1:33:28] and thanksgiving
[1:33:30] with thanksgiving let your requests be
[1:33:32] made known unto god
[1:33:35] so instead of being anxious you become
[1:33:38] prayerful
[1:33:40] amen
[1:33:44] and finally he says and the peace of god
[1:33:46] which passes all
[1:33:47] understanding shall keep that's the same
[1:33:51] word defend
[1:33:53] it'll be your fortress the peace of god
[1:33:55] will be your fortress
[1:33:57] you don't have to worry about standing
[1:33:58] behind this complex
[1:34:00] and constantly reminding your children
[1:34:02] well you probably don't love me
[1:34:04] anyway you don't have to do that
[1:34:07] constantly remind your wife or your
[1:34:09] husband or your or someone else your mom
[1:34:11] or dad oh you really don't love me
[1:34:13] anyway or you wouldn't be like that no
[1:34:15] no you know you can rest in the goodness
[1:34:17] of god
[1:34:20] if i remember one time i was asked to
[1:34:22] read the bible and
[1:34:24] i think it's in psalms and every morning
[1:34:27] we'd have a bible reading and
[1:34:29] prayer and that morning i picked the
[1:34:31] scripture out of psalms and said if if
[1:34:32] my mother and father forsake me the lord
[1:34:34] will
[1:34:35] will pick me up and my dad didn't take
[1:34:39] too kindly to that he said well what are
[1:34:41] you reading that for
[1:34:42] built himself a complex out of it
[1:34:47] but it's the truth isn't it if there's
[1:34:50] nobody else you still got him
[1:34:53] you if nobody said well nobody loves me
[1:34:55] but you've got an
[1:34:56] unlimited store of love
[1:35:00] pretty bad an unlimited amount of joy
[1:35:02] and unlimited by the david amount of
[1:35:03] peace
[1:35:04] whatever that it is i just called you
[1:35:06] david joe i'm sorry
[1:35:08] an unlimited amount of of the power of
[1:35:10] god i hadn't done that now you have a
[1:35:12] complex if i hadn't done that you
[1:35:14] wouldn't have known
[1:35:15] i hadn't said something about it but you
[1:35:17] got unlimited amounts don't you
[1:35:20] you don't have to worry about well the
[1:35:22] person at the grocery store didn't treat
[1:35:24] me right but god treats you right every
[1:35:26] day
[1:35:27] you have the almighty on your side and
[1:35:30] if god gets for you who can be against
[1:35:32] you
[1:35:33] you got to start thinking like that and
[1:35:36] the peace of god which passes all
[1:35:37] understanding shall keep
[1:35:39] keep that's just fortress your hearts
[1:35:41] and minds through christ jesus the next
[1:35:42] verse
[1:35:43] says finally brethren whatsoever things
[1:35:45] are true whatsoever things are honest
[1:35:47] what's over things they're just
[1:35:48] whatsoever things are pure
[1:35:50] what that what's over things are lovely
[1:35:52] whatsoever things are of good report if
[1:35:53] there be any virtue
[1:35:54] if there be any praise think on these
[1:35:57] things
[1:35:58] that'll tear down your complex number
[1:36:01] one it'll it'll fall apart
[1:36:03] from neglect
[1:36:06] you quit building on it and storm it
[1:36:08] with love and joy and peace and things
[1:36:09] that are just
[1:36:10] things that are pure things that are
[1:36:11] honest things that are lovely
[1:36:15] things that are of good report
[1:36:18] brother brown says when a person
[1:36:19] realizes he has an inferior complex
[1:36:22] or some sort of complex how may he
[1:36:23] overcome this
[1:36:25] and they said so should it be if he was
[1:36:27] the only child caused this in his early
[1:36:28] youth
[1:36:30] so they asked him that question he said
[1:36:32] take exactly the opposite
[1:36:34] he said if you're always wanting your
[1:36:36] way and that one little brat that always
[1:36:39] wants to have everything your way now i
[1:36:40] know some people who aren't only
[1:36:42] children that are like that
[1:36:44] so not just only children he says if
[1:36:47] you're that one little brat that wants
[1:36:49] to always have everything your way
[1:36:50] that's a complex
[1:36:52] turn right back around give everything
[1:36:54] you got the other way
[1:36:57] if you're selfish and you want to hold
[1:36:58] everything start giving away what you
[1:37:00] got
[1:37:02] see he said just vice versa he said
[1:37:03] that's the way to overcome anything
[1:37:05] is an antidote amen
[1:37:09] my old southern mother used to say a
[1:37:10] hair off the dog back is good for the
[1:37:11] bite
[1:37:12] and that applies this way too the
[1:37:15] antidote
[1:37:17] make the complex uncomfortable
[1:37:20] by doing exactly the opposite of the
[1:37:23] orders
[1:37:24] that get issued from that pentagon
[1:37:26] complex
[1:37:27] does that make sense you don't have to
[1:37:28] obey it
[1:37:31] that order comes down from the complex
[1:37:32] and says
[1:37:34] you need to not go to church today
[1:37:35] because nobody loves you
[1:37:38] i'm not going to obey that i'm going to
[1:37:39] go to the house of god
[1:37:42] not because anybody there but because
[1:37:43] the lord said
[1:37:46] assemble yourselves together that's what
[1:37:48] the word said
[1:37:50] the complex comes down and says that the
[1:37:52] order comes down from the complex and
[1:37:54] says
[1:37:54] today you need to start a war with your
[1:37:56] brother-in-law your sister-in-law your
[1:37:57] mother-in-law
[1:37:59] no i'm not going to do it you know how
[1:38:02] you resist the devil
[1:38:03] you say no to the devil that's what a
[1:38:06] prophet of god taught us say no
[1:38:08] and don't do it because you don't have
[1:38:11] to do it he said well i don't have the
[1:38:12] strength to not do it what you don't
[1:38:14] understand is you do have the strength
[1:38:16] because he said i can do all things
[1:38:19] through christ who gives me strength
[1:38:22] amen make the complex uncomfortable
[1:38:24] you've got to
[1:38:25] step out of that bitterness step out of
[1:38:27] that guilt i read a story
[1:38:29] about some christians in korea
[1:38:32] and they had been told by when the
[1:38:35] japanese invaded and took over korea in
[1:38:36] the second world war
[1:38:38] they were told not to have church they
[1:38:40] padlocked the doors of the church and
[1:38:41] this one pastor he
[1:38:42] he just couldn't stand him and over and
[1:38:45] over he
[1:38:46] he knocked on the door of the japanese
[1:38:48] soldiers and
[1:38:49] and the man that was in charge there the
[1:38:51] general that was in charge and
[1:38:53] he sent him letters he called him he
[1:38:55] tried every way that he could we need to
[1:38:56] have church we need to have
[1:38:58] church let us have church and finally
[1:39:01] the japanese
[1:39:02] soldiers got tired of it and they said
[1:39:04] go have church
[1:39:06] and so they opened the doors and that
[1:39:08] morning all the christians come because
[1:39:09] they hadn't been able to have church in
[1:39:11] a long time
[1:39:13] they come and got inside the old church
[1:39:14] building and made out of wood like all
[1:39:16] the buildings there were
[1:39:18] they got out of the in the old church
[1:39:20] building and they began to sing they
[1:39:21] were known the korean christians were
[1:39:23] known for their singing
[1:39:25] and they begin to sing different songs
[1:39:27] and after a while they realize the door
[1:39:29] had been locked behind them
[1:39:32] and then some at the back begin to smell
[1:39:34] gasoline they began to realize
[1:39:36] they'd been locked in they were about to
[1:39:39] be burned alive
[1:39:42] and they stood there and didn't know
[1:39:45] what to do so the pastor just began to
[1:39:46] lead the congregation in a song there's
[1:39:48] no way out
[1:39:50] he began to lead him in the song alas
[1:39:53] and did my savior
[1:39:54] bleed and did my sovereign die
[1:39:58] at the cross at the cross where i first
[1:39:59] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[1:40:02] rolled away they sing at the top of
[1:40:04] their voices
[1:40:05] the place burnt down with everybody
[1:40:07] inside
[1:40:09] they all died
[1:40:13] i got a note here for me to check the
[1:40:14] time
[1:40:16] it's right about time to close
[1:40:20] years later 30 years later the koreans
[1:40:23] put a memorial on that place but the
[1:40:25] koreans were bitter towards the japanese
[1:40:27] indescribably bitter because this was
[1:40:29] just one thing in a whole history of
[1:40:31] things
[1:40:32] that had been done to the korean people
[1:40:34] by the japanese the japanese were very
[1:40:36] warlike people
[1:40:39] and thirty years later there was a group
[1:40:41] of japanese pastors that were traveling
[1:40:43] through korea
[1:40:44] they come across this monument where the
[1:40:46] church had stood
[1:40:47] they'd never rebuilt and just had a
[1:40:49] monument there
[1:40:50] saying what had happened they come
[1:40:52] across it they said we got to do
[1:40:54] something about this
[1:40:55] this was a wrong done not by us by our
[1:40:57] people and so they said we got to do
[1:41:00] something so they went and gathered
[1:41:01] money
[1:41:01] and japan brought it back and built them
[1:41:03] a new church
[1:41:05] and that first sunday morning the
[1:41:07] koreans come together to worship and
[1:41:08] from that area
[1:41:10] and they began to worship the lord but a
[1:41:13] little japanese delegation had come and
[1:41:15] sit in the corner
[1:41:17] wanting to see the results of what
[1:41:18] they'd done but the koreans
[1:41:20] after 30 years still held that
[1:41:22] bitterness as you would
[1:41:24] if you had family members and
[1:41:25] forefathers and such that had been
[1:41:27] burned alive
[1:41:31] and they're sitting in the corner
[1:41:32] wondering what to do and they begin to
[1:41:34] sing that same song at the cross at the
[1:41:36] cross
[1:41:37] where i first saw the light and the
[1:41:39] burden of my heart rolled away
[1:41:42] one of the korean brothers began to
[1:41:43] realize he still held that
[1:41:45] he was still holding that he he just
[1:41:47] didn't feel right towards these japanese
[1:41:49] soldiers
[1:41:50] these people that were these pastors
[1:41:52] that were japanese even though they
[1:41:53] weren't soldiers
[1:41:54] he felt so bad about that and he just
[1:41:57] didn't know what to do
[1:41:59] so all he could do he's just stood up
[1:42:00] while they were singing the song he
[1:42:02] walked over and he began to shake
[1:42:03] the hands of the japanese people that
[1:42:05] were there and the service broke open
[1:42:07] and the bitterness was gone
[1:42:10] what did he do he stormed the castle yes
[1:42:13] it was
[1:42:14] it was a it was a horrible wrong that
[1:42:15] was done
[1:42:17] but the burdens rolled away at the cross
[1:42:19] here we are gathering at the cross
[1:42:21] we can be one here at the foot of the
[1:42:24] cross someone said the ground is level
[1:42:26] at the foot of the cross what do you do
[1:42:29] to a
[1:42:30] a bitterness that's there you take an
[1:42:31] action to make it right even if you're
[1:42:34] the one that was wronged
[1:42:38] make that complex uncomfortable
[1:42:41] storm the gates
[1:42:45] brother branham says surely after all
[1:42:46] these years on the field around the
[1:42:48] world and seeing different people he
[1:42:49] said i ought to know
[1:42:50] a little bit about the gate to enter in
[1:42:51] at he said if you want to get somewhere
[1:42:54] with god
[1:42:54] never let an arrogant spirit ever come
[1:42:56] around you
[1:42:58] don't let no malice come in no matter
[1:43:01] what anybody does could we do that
[1:43:02] church
[1:43:03] no matter what anybody does if they're
[1:43:05] wrong don't you never build up a complex
[1:43:07] against that person
[1:43:09] see you be sweet and kind remember god
[1:43:11] loved you when you were in sin
[1:43:13] and if the spirit of god is in you you
[1:43:15] love the other person when he's in wrong
[1:43:17] see just pray for them and love one
[1:43:19] another above everything love god
[1:43:21] and love one another and be humble with
[1:43:23] god and around one another
[1:43:25] and god will bless us in his heart
[1:43:27] telling what he will do i read the
[1:43:28] scripture the other night
[1:43:29] and it struck me he said let each esteem
[1:43:32] other better than himself
[1:43:35] esteem assumed by the same that you're a
[1:43:37] better man than i am and then we can get
[1:43:38] along
[1:43:40] because i assume that you're better than
[1:43:41] myself and i wouldn't hold anything
[1:43:43] against myself
[1:43:46] not if i was had my sanity i don't you
[1:43:48] don't hold things against yourself
[1:43:49] you hold it against other people god
[1:43:53] help us today
[1:43:57] i read starting out the prayer of jabez
[1:44:01] and you might wonder if i would ever
[1:44:02] come back to it
[1:44:05] the bible says jabez was more honorable
[1:44:07] than his brother and his mother called
[1:44:08] his name jabez because i bear him with
[1:44:10] sorrow and we don't know
[1:44:12] what sorrow that was the jews say that
[1:44:15] he was an illegitimate child
[1:44:18] we don't know what it was he was born
[1:44:22] under that name
[1:44:24] identified his life you may not like
[1:44:27] your name but at least you weren't named
[1:44:29] sorrow
[1:44:33] he's born under that his name
[1:44:37] and the circumstances of his birth may
[1:44:39] have caused him great pain in life
[1:44:43] but the reason he was more honorable
[1:44:44] than his brethren
[1:44:46] is because of what he did with it
[1:44:49] now you're listening look look at what
[1:44:51] at first chronicles chapter four if you
[1:44:52] look at that
[1:44:53] chapter you see a sea of names just a
[1:44:55] whole bunch of names one after the other
[1:44:57] after the other
[1:44:59] news says and jabez i want god to be
[1:45:02] able to do that for me
[1:45:04] i want him to be able to say that about
[1:45:06] me jabez was more honorable
[1:45:09] why not because he had more advantages
[1:45:11] in life because he probably had less
[1:45:12] advantages than any of the others
[1:45:14] he was born under that name that sorrow
[1:45:17] he was more honorable than his brethren
[1:45:19] because instead of wallowing in that
[1:45:20] pain
[1:45:22] he called on god and the bible says
[1:45:25] jabez called on the god of israel saying
[1:45:28] oh just stop there for a minute
[1:45:32] storm the gates if you need something
[1:45:35] get serious with god
[1:45:38] if you go back in there in the original
[1:45:39] this oh it's not just
[1:45:41] him saying oh that that would bless me
[1:45:42] indeed but it's all
[1:45:45] from the depths of his heart you don't
[1:45:48] see people
[1:45:49] call out to god like that anymore but
[1:45:52] all that we would do that today
[1:45:54] if you've got something that you need
[1:45:56] you cry out to god for it say oh
[1:46:00] it come from his heart something that he
[1:46:03] needed all that that would have blessed
[1:46:04] me indeed
[1:46:06] i've got this sorrow in my life i was
[1:46:08] born under there with this problem going
[1:46:09] on
[1:46:10] but all that that would have blessed me
[1:46:12] indeed oh that that would have blessed
[1:46:14] me in need
[1:46:15] blessed me with spiritual blessings like
[1:46:16] you promised abraham
[1:46:19] enlarge my coast let me possess all the
[1:46:21] land promise to me
[1:46:23] that thy hand might be with me let me be
[1:46:26] directed and helped in all that i do
[1:46:28] and keep me from evil that is literally
[1:46:31] keep me from sorrow
[1:46:33] his name means sorrow he says keep me
[1:46:36] from becoming that
[1:46:39] are you with me maybe you've had things
[1:46:41] going wrong in your life maybe you have
[1:46:42] had things going and i'm closing in just
[1:46:44] a moment
[1:46:44] but he literally said keep me from
[1:46:46] becoming what i was born to be
[1:46:48] keep me from when i was born i was given
[1:46:51] a certain name
[1:46:52] keep me from becoming that lord help me
[1:46:54] don't let me be that way
[1:46:57] in john 17 when jesus prayed for the
[1:47:00] disciples i'm closing musicians go ahead
[1:47:02] and come
[1:47:03] he said i have given them thy word and
[1:47:05] the world has hated them
[1:47:07] because they are not of the world even
[1:47:09] as i am not of the world
[1:47:11] i pray not that thou should have taken
[1:47:13] them out of the world but that thou
[1:47:15] should escape them
[1:47:16] from the evil
[1:47:20] that is literally keep them from the
[1:47:21] influence of the evil one
[1:47:24] have you ever wondered why did judas
[1:47:26] finally betray jesus when he did
[1:47:30] why did he betray him when he did born
[1:47:33] to be the son of perdition but what
[1:47:35] pushed him over the edge
[1:47:37] what caused the devil to enter into him
[1:47:40] become incarnate so something happened
[1:47:46] you find the story in john 12 john 12
[1:47:50] chapter 4
[1:47:52] a little woman a prostitute had come to
[1:47:55] wash jesus feet
[1:48:00] she come to watch jesus feet and she
[1:48:04] didn't care how it looked
[1:48:07] he had a need i pray that we would be
[1:48:09] that way today
[1:48:10] with our worship she he had a need and
[1:48:14] he was sitting there
[1:48:15] she come and she washed his feet with
[1:48:17] her tears
[1:48:19] wiped them with her hair and poured
[1:48:22] broke a bottle of
[1:48:23] an alabaster box of ointment and poured
[1:48:24] it on him
[1:48:28] judas is standing there and judah says
[1:48:33] in verse 5 if you go to that next verse
[1:48:36] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:48:39] pence
[1:48:40] it was a lot of money and given to the
[1:48:43] poor
[1:48:44] judas begins to get upset at what he
[1:48:46] sees as a misuse of church
[1:48:48] funds this was money that was given to
[1:48:51] jesus and his disciples
[1:48:52] for the work of the ministry or could
[1:48:54] have been given to them you understand
[1:48:56] she could have just taken the money
[1:48:57] and put it in the bag and instead of
[1:48:59] doing that she bought this ointment and
[1:49:00] poured it on jesus
[1:49:03] and he got upset judas got upset and
[1:49:06] said
[1:49:06] but he said that not that he cared for
[1:49:08] the poor but because he was a thief
[1:49:10] and had the bag and bear what was put
[1:49:12] therein and that makes the job of a
[1:49:15] treasure a hard job
[1:49:18] brother david's done an honorable job
[1:49:20] with it but judas was the treasure
[1:49:22] you know why he was a treasure because
[1:49:23] they trusted him
[1:49:26] but the bible says he was a thief
[1:49:30] and then said jesus let her alone he
[1:49:32] said against the day of my burying
[1:49:34] hath she kept this that's all he says to
[1:49:37] him
[1:49:38] let her alone for the poor always you
[1:49:40] have with you but
[1:49:41] me how you have not always let her alone
[1:49:44] leave her alone let her do it
[1:49:47] now he called peter a devil
[1:49:50] he says he looks at peter and he says
[1:49:54] he says devil get behind me
[1:49:58] that's pretty harsh and to judas all he
[1:50:01] says
[1:50:02] is let her alone he gets up from there
[1:50:05] and goes looking for the high priest
[1:50:11] he got offended he put the last
[1:50:14] brick on the complex that would make him
[1:50:18] sell jesus
[1:50:20] and take his own life and you know it
[1:50:23] was something beyond his control or he
[1:50:25] wouldn't have killed himself
[1:50:27] he just had to do it listen church don't
[1:50:31] let the word
[1:50:32] be the last brick on your complex you
[1:50:34] better storm it tear it down
[1:50:38] let it go or the word maybe the last
[1:50:42] brick on the complex we've seen so many
[1:50:43] people leave
[1:50:44] the the message not because one thing
[1:50:47] happened all of a sudden they realize oh
[1:50:49] the bridge wasn't what it was supposed
[1:50:50] to be the vision was wrong
[1:50:52] and then they can't prove that it was
[1:50:54] wrong but they just say oh it was wrong
[1:50:57] must not be right oh that changed me now
[1:50:59] i'm not a believer anymore that's not
[1:51:01] what changed them
[1:51:03] it was the last brick on a complex
[1:51:08] the last piece of mortar the last
[1:51:11] piece of wood he said i can handle it
[1:51:13] but you couldn't handle it
[1:51:14] and you left and judas left
[1:51:18] went out found the high priest and began
[1:51:20] to look for an opportunity the bible
[1:51:22] says
[1:51:24] to turn on him oh god
[1:51:28] i don't want to ever get that way i
[1:51:29] don't believe i can because i'm not the
[1:51:30] son of perdition you understand you're
[1:51:32] not the son of perdition
[1:51:33] i don't believe you can but don't hold
[1:51:35] on to a complex
[1:51:37] because it'll kill you it'll make you
[1:51:40] kill yourself
[1:51:41] bow your heads with me if you will
[1:51:44] i know it's a very somber
[1:51:48] subject and it's hard because we all
[1:51:51] deal with complexes anytime you preach
[1:51:54] something that deals with everybody it's
[1:51:56] a problem
[1:51:57] because everybody feels a little
[1:51:59] convicted i feel a little convicted
[1:52:03] but the purpose today is not to tell you
[1:52:05] that you have a complex because most of
[1:52:07] you understand that
[1:52:08] the purpose today is if you have one
[1:52:10] storm the capes
[1:52:12] don't let you let it sit there make it
[1:52:15] right
[1:52:16] and if you have to walk away from it
[1:52:18] walk away from it quit
[1:52:20] looking for materials to build with
[1:52:24] quit looking at people like their supply
[1:52:26] depots
[1:52:28] or lowe's or home depot with material
[1:52:31] that you can build your complexes out
[1:52:33] with
[1:52:33] that's not what people are if you're not
[1:52:35] careful you'll look even at somebody
[1:52:36] maybe somebody that you want you like it
[1:52:38] maybe you want to marry
[1:52:39] you look at that person and say but but
[1:52:41] but that's just a supply depot if you're
[1:52:42] not careful everything they say just
[1:52:44] builds into your complexes
[1:52:45] and you can never really trust somebody
[1:52:48] somebody you're actually married to
[1:52:49] you look at them just as a supply depot
[1:52:51] for material for your conflicts don't do
[1:52:53] that
[1:52:55] let jesus come in today and and just
[1:52:58] give you strength and say lord i'm going
[1:53:01] to think on good things i'm going to
[1:53:02] believe
[1:53:03] i'm going to i'm going to have joy love
[1:53:05] and peace in my life i'm not going to
[1:53:06] let this complex control my life
[1:53:08] i'm not going to let it be the pentagon
[1:53:10] control everything that goes on
[1:53:13] and i want this military complex in my
[1:53:15] life i want to be free
[1:53:17] i want to be right heavenly father
[1:53:21] lord jesus i pray like jabez when he was
[1:53:24] born
[1:53:25] under that under that curse under that
[1:53:28] sorrow
[1:53:29] every one of us are born with some
[1:53:31] sorrow in our lives some pain
[1:53:33] but oh god may we cry out like he did
[1:53:37] oh that that would bless me indeed
[1:53:40] oh that you would enlarge my territory
[1:53:44] help me to be all that i can be in you
[1:53:46] lord i don't have to i'm not
[1:53:47] bound to what my parents are what my
[1:53:50] grandparents are
[1:53:51] what my what my genes that are in me i'm
[1:53:53] not bound to that i don't have to live
[1:53:55] that way
[1:53:56] i don't have to build on this complex
[1:53:58] anymore i can storm it
[1:54:00] with you with me lord i can overtake it
[1:54:02] i can throw down those imaginations
[1:54:04] i can cast down those imaginations i can
[1:54:06] take those thoughts into captivity
[1:54:08] i may not be able to stop the thoughts
[1:54:10] from coming but i can make them captive
[1:54:12] to your word
[1:54:13] i pray you'd grant it today lord lord in
[1:54:16] my life if there's a complex being built
[1:54:18] right now
[1:54:18] maybe subconsciously that i wouldn't
[1:54:20] know about let your holy spirit come
[1:54:22] down
[1:54:23] lord and just just tear it out today
[1:54:25] wash it out
[1:54:26] lord sometimes the greatest antidote for
[1:54:28] bitterness is just to be in your
[1:54:29] presence
[1:54:31] lord somehow in your presence we can't
[1:54:33] think that way about people
[1:54:34] as brother branham talked about reaching
[1:54:36] a place in prayer where the whole world
[1:54:38] it looks like looks good to you it
[1:54:40] doesn't look like that
[1:54:41] anybody's your enemy you reach that
[1:54:43] place in prayer it doesn't matter what
[1:54:44] people do to you what they say about you
[1:54:46] oh god may we reach that place today may
[1:54:49] we worship
[1:54:50] you in such a way lord that you would
[1:54:52] know that you were welcome here
[1:54:54] let me not be like judas who criticizes
[1:54:56] somebody who gets a little bit lost
[1:54:58] in worship spends a little bit too much
[1:55:00] money or
[1:55:01] or praises a little bit too much but god
[1:55:04] may we
[1:55:05] be like you lord may we have your
[1:55:07] attitude let it be so
[1:55:09] let it be so it's needful for today it's
[1:55:12] needful that someone would wash your
[1:55:14] feet
[1:55:15] i pray you'd grant it lord thank you for
[1:55:18] all that you do for us
[1:55:19] thank you for building us up as a church
[1:55:21] lord the opposite of a complex being
[1:55:23] built
[1:55:24] is the word being built in our life and
[1:55:25] you sent the ministry to do that
[1:55:27] i pray god there would ever be so help
[1:55:29] me not to build complexes in people's
[1:55:30] eyes or supply
[1:55:32] material for the complexes but lord may
[1:55:34] i supply only
[1:55:35] your word to the people so that they can
[1:55:37] build on that word
[1:55:39] into the body of christ i pray you'd
[1:55:41] grant it lord
[1:55:42] that we would be edified lord until we
