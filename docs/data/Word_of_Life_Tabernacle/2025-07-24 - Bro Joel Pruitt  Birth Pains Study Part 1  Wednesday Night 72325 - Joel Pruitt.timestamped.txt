[48:14] little eagle,
[48:17] and fly.
[48:22] You weren't born
[48:26] for the valley.
[48:30] Oh, you were born
[48:33] soar in the sky.
[48:36] Don't let your trials
[48:40] bring you down
[48:43] or drive your spirit to the ground.
[48:49] Just m up with wings
[48:54] little
[48:56] go
[48:58] and fly.
[49:01] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[49:02] praise tonight.
[49:05] How many's happy to be in church on a
[49:07] Wednesday night?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many enjoyed our meetings over
[49:10] the weekend? Amen. Weren't they good? Go
[49:13] ahead.
[49:16] Amen. I don't think they could have went
[49:18] any better. I I we were just uh all the
[49:21] testimonies that have come in and and
[49:23] and the healings that have taken place.
[49:24] And that'll be all the music. Thank you.
[49:27] And all the things that have happened.
[49:28] Uh I I tell you what, I think the
[49:30] ministers that came, every one of them
[49:31] did a wonderful job. And and I want to
[49:34] say this for the church. U brother Ben
[49:36] would be up here doing this, but uh he
[49:38] got he come down with strep right after
[49:40] the end of the meeting and he he's not
[49:42] contagious. So don't look at him like
[49:43] that. He uh he he's good. He's on
[49:47] antibiotics and all those things, but he
[49:49] just don't have any voice tonight. So
[49:51] he's he's he's good. So you're stuck
[49:53] with me as brother David said. But uh I
[49:57] I will say this that uh I just felt like
[49:59] the meetings were just really a success.
[50:02] And that's not just the number of
[50:03] people, but it's the people that were
[50:05] helped and to see the people that were
[50:07] healed and delivered and all those
[50:09] things. I mean, that makes it all worth
[50:11] it. It it makes all the tiredness worth
[50:13] it. It makes all the money worth it when
[50:15] you can see just one soul get help. And
[50:18] I believe it's worth it. And the
[50:19] fellowship's always good. And and you
[50:20] people outdid yourselves. You all were
[50:22] just wonderful. Give each other a nice
[50:24] hand if you would.
[50:26] man, some of the best hosts in the
[50:29] world, uh, meetings you go to and you
[50:31] see how they run them and there's a lot
[50:33] of good meetings out there, but I felt
[50:34] like we just did a really, every one of
[50:37] us I felt like put our best effort
[50:38] forward and you all did a wonderful job.
[50:41] We'll get right into the word tonight.
[50:42] I'm running out of time. Uh, I did enjoy
[50:45] the specials. Good to see you all here
[50:47] tonight. God bless you. And uh, if you
[50:50] have your Bibles, John chapter 16 and
[50:52] verse 21. I I've just been doing a
[50:54] little bit of a study on birth pains,
[50:56] the sermon birth pains that brother
[50:57] Brandon preaches. And I just want to
[50:59] take almost every quote that I have here
[51:01] tonight will be from that sermon. And so
[51:05] uh if you get a chance, I would say uh
[51:08] if you if you can uh go ahead and listen
[51:12] to that sermon when you get a chance, I
[51:14] believe it would be good for every one
[51:15] of us to hear it. It's it's a it's just
[51:16] a wonderful message. And brother
[51:18] Brandham opens with this scripture on
[51:20] there. Actually, it's when his Bible, he
[51:22] couldn't find his place in the Bible.
[51:23] And there's a Catholic priest actually
[51:25] that that loans him his Bible and and
[51:27] tells him that must have been for a
[51:29] reason that he couldn't find it in his
[51:30] and uses his. And he explains that in
[51:32] the next sermon after that. But but uh
[51:34] John 16 and verse 21 before you're
[51:37] seated. A woman when she is in travail
[51:39] hath sorrow because her hour is come,
[51:42] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[51:43] child, she rememberth no more the
[51:46] anguish for joy that a man is born into
[51:49] the world. And you may be seated. May
[51:51] the Lord add his blessings to the word
[51:53] tonight. And if you read that entire
[51:55] scripture there, you'll see that that in
[51:57] the 33rd verse, Jesus, the Bible would
[52:00] tell us there in John that these things
[52:02] have I spoken unto you that in in me you
[52:05] might have peace. In the world you will
[52:07] have tribulation, but be of good cheer.
[52:09] I have overcome the world. So we just
[52:12] want to remember that. Amen. This world
[52:14] is full of sorrow. We know that. Amen.
[52:16] But as a believer, we have a rest. How
[52:18] many believes that here tonight? Amen.
[52:20] The faster you pull, the faster I'll
[52:22] preach and the quicker we'll get out of
[52:23] here. Amen. Hallelujah. Y'all don't seem
[52:26] real enthused about that, but it's the
[52:27] truth. I was told to keep it short
[52:29] tonight because y'all are tired and
[52:31] we're going to try to do that. But
[52:32] brother Brandon would speak here in the
[52:34] message birth pains. He said Jesus here
[52:35] was speaking of he said you will have
[52:37] sorrow but your sorrow shall be turned
[52:40] to joy. was speaking to his disciples
[52:41] here, knowing that the birth of
[52:43] Christianity was coming into existence
[52:45] and now the old has to die in order that
[52:48] the new is born to have anything that
[52:50] gives birth has to have pains of
[52:52] distress and they certainly was going to
[52:54] go through the pain of distress and
[52:56] anguish to get from the law unto grace.
[52:59] Now, they were in a time where you had
[53:01] Jesus on the scene. You had the
[53:02] disciples there and you would say,
[53:04] "Well, what we we shouldn't have any
[53:06] trouble. Everything should be okay
[53:07] because Jesus is right here with us."
[53:09] But but that was just the start of
[53:11] Christianity as we know it. That was
[53:13] just the ushering in of the grace
[53:15] dispensation. That was just then the
[53:18] time when they were about to go through
[53:20] all these things in order to be tested
[53:22] and tried for the gospel's sake. And I
[53:25] will say every believer that comes to
[53:26] God must first be tested and tried. Do
[53:29] you believe that tonight? And so brother
[53:30] Brandon would talk about birth here. He
[53:32] said natural birth types the spiritual
[53:34] birth. And all things of the natural is
[53:36] types of the spiritual. He said, 'We
[53:38] find out that if we look out here on the
[53:40] ground and see a tree in the earth
[53:41] growing is struggling for life. That
[53:43] goes to show that there is a tree
[53:45] somewhere that doesn't die because it's
[53:48] crying out for something. We find people
[53:50] no matter how old, how sick, what
[53:51] condition, they're crying out to live
[53:54] because it shows there is a life
[53:55] somewhere where we live forever. And the
[53:58] believer said, "Amen." He said, "Notice
[53:59] how perfect." And he quotes here 1 John
[54:01] 5:7. He said, "For there are three that
[54:04] bear record in heaven, the Father, the
[54:06] Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these
[54:08] three are one." And he goes on to say
[54:09] like this, "There are three that bear
[54:12] record in earth, that's water, blood,
[54:14] and spirit. And they agree in one." He
[54:16] said, "Now notice the first three are
[54:17] one. The second three are earthly, which
[54:20] agree in one, and cannot have the father
[54:22] without the son. You cannot have the son
[54:24] without having the holy ghost. But you
[54:26] can have the water without the blood,
[54:27] and the blood without the spirit." And
[54:29] he goes on down to talking about the
[54:30] birth. And he says a woman or anything
[54:32] in travail for birth the first thing
[54:34] comes to pass the breaking of the water
[54:36] a normal birth. The second thing is the
[54:38] blood and then comes life and water
[54:39] blood and spirit. And he said and that
[54:41] constitutes the normal natural birth.
[54:44] And so is it in the spiritual realm it's
[54:47] water justification by faith believing
[54:49] on God receiving him as your personal
[54:51] savior and being baptized. Second is
[54:53] sanctification of the spirit that God
[54:55] cleanses the spirit from all elements of
[54:57] the world and the desire of the world.
[55:00] And then the Holy Spirit comes in and
[55:02] gives new birth and fills up that
[55:04] sanctified vessel. Now in Matthew 9:16,
[55:07] it says it like this. No man putteth a
[55:10] piece of new cloth unto an old garment.
[55:11] For that which is put in to fill it up
[55:13] taketh from the garment and that rent
[55:15] and the rent is made worse. Neither do
[55:17] men put new wine into old bottles, else
[55:19] the bottles break and the new wine runth
[55:21] out and the bottles perish. But they put
[55:23] new wine into new bottles and both are
[55:26] preserved. So if you're still have a
[55:28] love for the world and you're still
[55:29] desiring the things of the world. Amen.
[55:31] You need to be justified and sanctified
[55:34] and then you need to be filled with the
[55:36] Holy Ghost. But God is not going to fill
[55:38] your vessel if you still have no desire
[55:40] to be filled. Can you say amen?
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So the Bible would would tell us that
[55:44] and brother Brandon would pick it up. He
[55:46] said now for instance like this he said
[55:49] now that I told you what what he said
[55:51] now he said what you don't believe lay
[55:52] aside then take the take the pie. He
[55:54] tells you to spit out the the pit and
[55:56] then spit out the bone and eat the
[55:57] chicken and and so you can do the same
[55:59] with me tonight if you want to. But I'm
[56:01] going to read a lot of quotes. So So
[56:03] hopefully you can believe what a prophet
[56:04] said. How many believers we got in the
[56:06] building tonight? Somebody say amen. He
[56:08] said now he said you go and there's a
[56:10] piece of glass laying out in the chicken
[56:11] yard. You don't just pick that up and
[56:12] put it on your table and fill it up with
[56:14] water or milk. No. He said by picking it
[56:17] up is justification. Cleansing it is
[56:20] sanctification. Because the Greek word
[56:21] sanctify is a compound word which means
[56:23] cleansed and set aside for service. Not
[56:26] in service but for service. And then
[56:28] when you fill it, it is put in service.
[56:30] Now that's why brother Brandon would
[56:32] also say a man should never stand in the
[56:34] pulpit until he's met God face to face.
[56:36] Amen. That doesn't mean a literal
[56:37] burning bush experience, but a man must
[56:39] have the Holy Ghost in order to preach
[56:41] this message. Amen. And understand the
[56:43] spirit that it was brought in. Can you
[56:45] say amen? And so we want to understand
[56:47] that God does not want a man that is
[56:49] still desiring the things of the world.
[56:51] And I want to just clarify this here
[56:52] that that there's going to be many men
[56:54] that will fall. There's going to be many
[56:55] men that make mistakes and will stand in
[56:57] a pulpit. That doesn't mean they didn't
[56:58] have the Holy Ghost. But I'll say this.
[57:00] If a man has the Holy Ghost, he will
[57:02] desire the things of God and he will do
[57:04] everything he can. Amen. To to stay
[57:06] clear of those things that would that
[57:08] would pull him down. Amen. But but a man
[57:10] could fall and still have the Holy
[57:11] Ghost. How many believes that here
[57:13] tonight? Amen. That doesn't mean you
[57:14] wasn't saved. It doesn't mean you wasn't
[57:16] filled. Amen. But you you backslid. So
[57:18] we go on like this. And brother Brandham
[57:20] would say it like this. He said, "In
[57:21] order to get a life in the baby," he
[57:23] goes back to the birth pains here. He
[57:25] said, "In order to get life in the baby,
[57:27] you've got to give him a spanking."
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Amen." Amen. You make him
[57:31] yell out. So have you ever been in a
[57:33] hospital room when there's babies are
[57:34] being born?
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Nobody. You've all got kids and
[57:38] you've never been in a hospital with
[57:39] kids. All right. Well, let me tell you.
[57:41] Let me tell you about it then since
[57:42] you've never been there. And some of
[57:44] y'all got dozens of kids, it looks like.
[57:46] And and so you go into a hospital room
[57:48] and and and I'm going to tell you
[57:49] something. There's nothing there's
[57:51] nothing pretty about a birth. Life is
[57:53] beautiful, but there's nothing pretty
[57:54] about the birth. And so and and you know
[57:57] there's pain and there's a lot and I
[57:58] know all about it. So and there's all
[58:00] kinds of pain and things that's going on
[58:02] there. And I've had a kidney stone. Does
[58:04] that count?
[58:06] They they they tell me that's pretty
[58:08] close.
[58:09] And uh I don't know how they know, but
[58:12] but they say it's pretty close. But you
[58:13] think about it, there's there's it's a
[58:15] mess. The birth is a mess, but be from
[58:18] the birth and the mess comes life.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; And so I believe that that's the way it
[58:23] is. If you don't want a mess in your
[58:25] salvation, then you really don't want
[58:26] life. If you really can't get down to an
[58:28] altar and ball and squall and and snot a
[58:31] little bit and just cry and pray
[58:32] through, you may not really be serious
[58:34] with God. Amen. But when you get serious
[58:36] with God, it doesn't matter what you got
[58:38] to go through to get there. You got to
[58:40] get to Jesus. And I want to say tonight,
[58:43] what we need more than anything is to
[58:45] not worry about such a such a beautiful
[58:47] service, but what we need is the Holy
[58:48] Ghost to come into the service. What we
[58:50] need is not to have such form and and
[58:52] fashion, but what we need is the Holy
[58:54] Ghost to move upon our young people and
[58:56] old people alike. Amen. It's not good
[58:58] enough to just come and say we're having
[58:59] a service, but we want God in our midst.
[59:01] It doesn't matter how it makes us act.
[59:03] We want God to be present among us. And
[59:06] I'll say the reason there was
[59:07] testimonies in the meetings is because
[59:09] there was a group of believers that come
[59:10] together and we didn't care what the
[59:12] world thought about us. We didn't care
[59:13] what one another thought about us. But
[59:15] we came for one purpose and that was to
[59:17] see souls saved and and demons cast out
[59:19] and and to worship God in the way that
[59:21] we know how to worship God. Amen. We
[59:23] heard a preacher stand here and say you
[59:25] can't you can't worship him without a
[59:27] divine revelation because you don't even
[59:29] know who you're worshiping. But I'll say
[59:31] here tonight that if you've got that
[59:32] revelation, then you're a blessed
[59:34] people. If you've got the revelation of
[59:36] who he is and who you are, then you can
[59:38] worship freely in the house of God and
[59:40] without form or without anything that
[59:42] would hold you back. Well, well, maybe
[59:44] the the preacher will preach against it.
[59:46] No, he wants to see you worshiping just
[59:47] as much as anybody else does. Can you
[59:50] say amen? God wants his people to
[59:52] worship him, and we must worship him in
[59:55] spirit and truth. Can you say amen?
[59:57] Amen. But in order to get life, there's
[59:59] got to be a mess. In order to get life,
[1:00:02] in order to have a birth, there's got to
[1:00:03] be birth pains that brings that brings a
[1:00:06] birth. Can you say amen? Amen. A lot of
[1:00:08] you that have been through it. Amen. You
[1:00:09] you may say that you it may be like any
[1:00:12] nothing else. It may be the worst pain
[1:00:13] that you've ever been through. But I
[1:00:15] will say this as a Christian, when
[1:00:17] you're dying out to self, when you
[1:00:18] realize that I've got to surrender what
[1:00:20] I am in order to be what God wants me to
[1:00:23] be. Amen. It may not be easy. Amen. But
[1:00:25] it's but it'll bring life to you. Can
[1:00:28] you say amen tonight? Amen. God wants
[1:00:30] you to surrender. He wants you to give
[1:00:31] everything to him. And if you can do
[1:00:33] that, it may be painful. It may be hard
[1:00:35] on you. But God wants you to be a to be
[1:00:38] a child of God. He wants you to be a
[1:00:40] born again Christian. He wants Come on,
[1:00:42] somebody. Amen. God wants you to have
[1:00:45] that experience even though it may be
[1:00:47] painful for you. But he knows on the
[1:00:49] other side of that is victory. He knows
[1:00:51] that after the birth there's going to be
[1:00:52] life. He knows that if you'll humble
[1:00:54] yourself and pray, then God will heal
[1:00:56] you. Amen. He knows that if you'll get
[1:00:58] yourself out of the way long enough,
[1:01:00] then God will create life in you. Can
[1:01:02] you say amen?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to do it more than you
[1:01:04] want it. But we've got to get sincere
[1:01:06] with God and there's got to be birth
[1:01:08] pains. Brother Brandon would go on like
[1:01:10] this. He said, he said, "Now, without
[1:01:11] education, my brethren, as my brethren
[1:01:13] here are so well trained, he said, "But
[1:01:15] I have to take nature to type it." And
[1:01:17] there you are. He said, "That's what
[1:01:18] happens when a real spanking to get this
[1:01:19] to them." He said, "You take a little
[1:01:21] some kind of a shock. Maybe maybe you
[1:01:23] wouldn't have to spank him. Just a
[1:01:24] little shock. Shock him a little. The
[1:01:26] very idea of him being born sometimes
[1:01:27] will do it. Grab him. Shake him. Don't
[1:01:29] start breathing. Spank him a little. And
[1:01:31] then he yells out in unknown tongues. He
[1:01:33] says to I guess to himself. And and he
[1:01:35] and anyhow and he said he's making
[1:01:36] noise. He said, "I think if a baby is
[1:01:38] born just by still birth with no sound,
[1:01:40] no emotion, that's a dead baby."
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Well, come on, church. I know people are
[1:01:45] trying to quiet us down and tell us to
[1:01:47] be orderly and things, but the babies
[1:01:49] have got to be born. The young people
[1:01:51] have got to have an experience. And
[1:01:53] there a still birth a still birth baby
[1:01:55] is a dead baby. But one that makes some
[1:01:58] noise is one that was born.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; And so brother Brandon would go on like
[1:02:01] this. He said I think he said I I I I
[1:02:04] think with a baby with no emotion.
[1:02:05] That's a dead baby. That's what's the
[1:02:06] matter with the church today. The system
[1:02:08] we got too many stillborn children. He
[1:02:10] said they need a gospel spanking. You
[1:02:12] see to wake them up to bring them to
[1:02:14] themselves so that God can breathe the
[1:02:16] breath of life into them. And now we
[1:02:18] find that that's so true. He said it's
[1:02:20] crude theology but it's the truth
[1:02:23] anyhow. And the bride would say amen to
[1:02:25] that. Amen. He said so see in a seed's
[1:02:28] birth the old seed must die before the
[1:02:31] new one can be born. How many knows that
[1:02:33] to be true? That's what a prophet would
[1:02:35] say. He said so therefore death is hard
[1:02:37] anytime. It's painful. It's distressful.
[1:02:39] Birth is the same way because you're
[1:02:41] bringing life into the world. That's why
[1:02:43] a birth for a Christian, a new birth is
[1:02:45] so painful because you're dying out to
[1:02:48] yourself. You're dying out to what you
[1:02:50] were in order to be born into the
[1:02:52] newness of life. And the church said,
[1:02:54] "Amen." And so he would go on like this.
[1:02:56] He said, "Birth is the same because
[1:02:57] you're bringing life." He said, Jesus
[1:02:59] said that his word was a seed that a
[1:03:01] swer went forth to sew. He said, "We're
[1:03:03] all acquainted with that." Can you say
[1:03:05] amen? He said, "And I want to teach this
[1:03:07] like a Sunday school lesson." And he
[1:03:09] goes on like this. He said, "But
[1:03:10] remember the seed is only bringing forth
[1:03:13] new life when it when it dies." And
[1:03:15] that's the reason it was so hard for
[1:03:17] those Pharisees to understand our Lord
[1:03:18] Jesus Christ because they were under the
[1:03:21] law. And then the law was the word of
[1:03:23] God in seed form. He said, "But he said
[1:03:25] but but when the word was ma was made
[1:03:28] flesh and become not law but grace." He
[1:03:30] said, "Now grace and law cannot exist at
[1:03:33] the same time." And so you'll see when
[1:03:35] Jesus was preaching there, the law was
[1:03:38] having to die in order for grace to take
[1:03:40] effect. Can the church say amen? He said
[1:03:43] they cannot exist together.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Y'all ever heard the message before?
[1:03:49] It's what a prophet said. Amen. You
[1:03:51] can't live under the law and then say
[1:03:53] you're living under grace
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; because you come on church. Amen. The
[1:03:57] law. You could none of you could live
[1:03:58] the law. I couldn't live the law. Amen.
[1:04:00] Aren't you thankful for the grace of God
[1:04:02] tonight that we're no longer living
[1:04:03] under the law, but we're living under
[1:04:06] grace in this hour? And so, brother
[1:04:08] Brandon would say, he said, because
[1:04:10] grace is so far above law, law is not
[1:04:12] even in the picture. And therefore, it's
[1:04:14] so hard for the Pharisees to die to
[1:04:16] their law so that grace could be born. I
[1:04:18] want to stop there and say this. If
[1:04:19] you're still trying to go back to what
[1:04:21] they used to do and you're still trying
[1:04:22] to observe the laws and the feast days
[1:04:24] and the holy days, let me tell you
[1:04:26] something. You're trying to live under
[1:04:27] something you're not ordained to live
[1:04:28] under. Amen. But grace has called you to
[1:04:30] the message of the hour. Grace has
[1:04:32] brought you this far. And grace is going
[1:04:34] to take you all the way home. Grace is
[1:04:36] why there was people healed in the
[1:04:38] meeting. Grace is why you're here on a
[1:04:39] Wednesday night. Grace is what brought
[1:04:41] us together. Come on, church. Grace,
[1:04:44] without grace, there would not be a one
[1:04:45] of us here tonight. But every one of us
[1:04:47] needed grace. And God would come in the
[1:04:50] son of man and he would say, "I I my
[1:04:52] grace is sufficient for thee." Come on,
[1:04:55] church. Amen. in your in your sin, in
[1:04:57] your your darkest hour, in the sin that
[1:04:59] you were in. His grace was enough for
[1:05:01] that sin. I don't care how low you were.
[1:05:03] I don't care how downtrodden you were. I
[1:05:05] don't know. I don't care how bad you
[1:05:07] were, Sister Stephanie. His grace was
[1:05:09] enough for you. His grace was Come on,
[1:05:11] church. When you really recognize the
[1:05:13] that the grace is here among us and
[1:05:15] we're living under grace, then we can
[1:05:17] realize it ain't how good I am or how
[1:05:19] good you are, but it is God that is good
[1:05:22] and we're under the grace that he has
[1:05:24] given us. Oh, the church ought to say,
[1:05:26] "Amen." Amen. Grace has brought us this
[1:05:29] far, church. Grace brought us through
[1:05:31] another meeting and there was healings.
[1:05:32] Grace brought that baby right there that
[1:05:34] you're holding. Grace is still
[1:05:35] sufficient for the believers in this
[1:05:37] hour.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; I say grace is enough tonight. He said
[1:05:41] the law is not even in the picture. And
[1:05:43] therefore, he said it was just a shadow
[1:05:45] of things that were to come. Amen. But
[1:05:47] but grace is enough. I want to just
[1:05:49] drive that point home. Grace is enough.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; We sit in the seat of the scornful and
[1:05:54] we're so critical about things all the
[1:05:55] time, but grace is enough. I I believe
[1:05:58] in holiness, but sometimes you need
[1:06:00] grace for people because maybe they
[1:06:01] ain't where you're at. Maybe there's
[1:06:03] people that aren't living where you're
[1:06:04] living. But but but grace will bring
[1:06:06] them to the place where you are. Come
[1:06:08] on, church. And then grace might take
[1:06:10] away your critical spirit as well.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; And the church said, "Amen."
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say it like this.
[1:06:16] He said, now he said, "The two laws
[1:06:18] could not exist at the same time. There
[1:06:19] cannot be a law that says you can run
[1:06:21] this uh semaphore. And the other one
[1:06:23] says that you can run it. One says you
[1:06:25] can and one says you can't." He says
[1:06:27] there has to be one law at a time. Amen.
[1:06:28] You go up to a red light and if it's a
[1:06:30] red light, you got to stop. If it's a
[1:06:31] yellow light, you yield. If it's a green
[1:06:33] light, you go. That's what you need to
[1:06:35] tell people when you're behind them.
[1:06:36] Honk your horn. Tell them to go. sitting
[1:06:38] at a green light and and Pentecostal
[1:06:40] cursing or whatever they call that. But
[1:06:42] but I'll tell you what it is. Many times
[1:06:44] we we we we try to say, "Well, if you
[1:06:46] try to say, "Well, green means stop and
[1:06:48] you're going to cause a wreck and and
[1:06:49] and red means go." What it is, you can't
[1:06:51] live under the it's got to be a law.
[1:06:53] There's got to be something there. Amen.
[1:06:55] But grace grace is greater than the law.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would go on like
[1:07:00] this, and I'm not going to get to all
[1:07:01] this tonight, so you just have to bear
[1:07:02] with me. We'll stop when we run out of
[1:07:04] time. Brother Brandon would go on. He
[1:07:06] said now he said but at this time it's
[1:07:08] red stop. See, and so there cannot be
[1:07:10] two laws exist at the same time. But did
[1:07:12] you notice? He said the pond lily had to
[1:07:14] be. He said, I think of what Jesus said,
[1:07:16] consider the lily, how it toils and
[1:07:18] spins. But yet I say unto you that
[1:07:20] Solomon and all his glory was not
[1:07:22] arrayed like one of these. For Solomon's
[1:07:24] glory and his arignment was all
[1:07:25] artificial. But the lily in its beauty
[1:07:27] is life that's making its beautiful, not
[1:07:29] some artificial smear on it, paint on
[1:07:31] it. Just like our Excuse me, brother
[1:07:33] Brandon goes here. So I'm going to go
[1:07:34] here for just a second. He said, "Just
[1:07:36] like our women." He said, "I don't think
[1:07:38] you have to have all this green, you
[1:07:39] know, and eyewinkers and and out like
[1:07:41] that and all the manicure." And he got
[1:07:43] that mixed up. He said, "But the paint
[1:07:45] on your face." And he said, he said, "To
[1:07:47] make you pretty. Pretty is as pretty
[1:07:48] does. If you all would add a little Acts
[1:07:50] 2 and 4 with a little John 3:16, it'll
[1:07:53] beat anything that Max Factor ever did
[1:07:54] try."
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, a prophet can put it
[1:07:58] blunt, but it's truth anyhow. Can the
[1:08:00] church say amen? He said, "Your husband
[1:08:02] will love you more. Everybody else will,
[1:08:03] and I'm sure God will." And then he gets
[1:08:05] back to the lily. So, we're going to
[1:08:06] just stay right with him here tonight.
[1:08:08] He said the lily, he said, consider it
[1:08:10] how it grows and toils. It has to bring
[1:08:12] itself up. You know, if you ever look at
[1:08:14] a pond lily, it ain't it's not easy
[1:08:16] before it gets beautiful.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; It has to work to get that way. Can the
[1:08:20] church say amen? Amen. That there's got
[1:08:22] to be a there's got to be a pain there
[1:08:24] in order for it to come through the mud
[1:08:26] and through the the pain of growing in
[1:08:28] order to become the beautiful lily that
[1:08:30] it is. And he said it has to come
[1:08:32] through the dirt, the muck, the mud, the
[1:08:33] muddy waters, dirty waters. It pressed
[1:08:35] its way through all of that, this little
[1:08:37] this little germ of life. He said,
[1:08:39] working itself from the bottom of the
[1:08:41] pond where the frogs and things are at,
[1:08:43] and then it brings itself up through all
[1:08:45] of that. But when it gets in the
[1:08:47] presence of the sun, it's born. So you
[1:08:49] say, why do we want the presence of God
[1:08:51] in our services? Because that's where
[1:08:53] children are born.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. It's good to have the
[1:08:56] word. And it's good to have the
[1:08:57] understanding and the revelations, but
[1:08:59] we must have the presence of God in the
[1:09:01] services.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; It's not, listen, it's not just for our
[1:09:04] meetings. It's not just for Sunday
[1:09:06] morning, but it's for every service we
[1:09:08] come in here. I know y'all are tired
[1:09:09] tonight. I won't hold you long, but I
[1:09:11] want us to never throw away a service. I
[1:09:13] want us to never say, "Lord, it's just
[1:09:15] another service. I don't know if I'll
[1:09:16] get anything." No. Come expecting and
[1:09:18] believing that the presence of God is
[1:09:20] going to show up and is going to take
[1:09:22] care of whatever situation you're going
[1:09:23] through.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe this right here
[1:09:26] tonight. Listen, church. I I know we've
[1:09:28] been through some good preaching. I was
[1:09:30] listening to one of them preachers today
[1:09:31] again and I thought, Lord, I can't
[1:09:33] believe I got to preach tonight, but I
[1:09:34] was sitting there thinking, you know
[1:09:35] what? It's not about the preacher. It's
[1:09:37] not about even me. It's not about you,
[1:09:39] but it's about letting him come in and
[1:09:41] make himself welcome in our services.
[1:09:44] It's about letting him come in and and
[1:09:46] do what he wants to do to your to your
[1:09:48] body and your soul and your spirit. He
[1:09:50] wants to change your mind. He wants to
[1:09:52] make you act right, do right, live
[1:09:53] right. God wants to do it more for you
[1:09:56] than you want him to do it. Amen. God is
[1:09:59] always wanting to do good things for his
[1:10:00] children. Listen, he watched you. He
[1:10:02] watched you come up through the mud. He
[1:10:04] watched you come as a lily. He watched
[1:10:06] you in your bad condition, but you
[1:10:08] always were a son or daughter of God.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; That's message teaching there. You
[1:10:13] always were. You didn't become a son.
[1:10:15] Listen, I I didn't become a son of of
[1:10:18] John Puit after after I was born. No, I
[1:10:20] was born a son of John Puit. Amen. From
[1:10:23] the very moment of conception, I was a
[1:10:24] son of John Puit. And so if I was, then
[1:10:27] I always will be. Amen. Whe for better
[1:10:29] or for worse, I'm the son of John Puit.
[1:10:31] And so I will tell you tonight, you
[1:10:33] always were a son or daughter of God.
[1:10:36] Amen. You don't get to choose who your
[1:10:37] father is. God chose you before the
[1:10:39] foundation of the world.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; And if God chose you, then he's going to
[1:10:43] see you through every trial. Amen. When
[1:10:45] you're at the bottom of the pond with
[1:10:46] the frogs and the tadpoles, amen, he's
[1:10:48] going to bring you up through the mud
[1:10:50] and he's going to watch you grow. Amen.
[1:10:52] But in his mind, he already saw you as
[1:10:54] the lily that was beautiful above all
[1:10:56] the things of the world.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; That ought to do something for us
[1:10:59] tonight that in his mind, Sister Janie,
[1:11:01] he already saw you coming forth as pure
[1:11:03] gold. He already saw you overcoming the
[1:11:05] world. He already saw you a as a as a
[1:11:08] pure, virtuous, sinless, spotless bride
[1:11:10] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Even in your bad
[1:11:13] condition, God knew who you were.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it took pains to be birthed
[1:11:17] into this bride. It took pains to be
[1:11:19] birthed into where you are. It's both
[1:11:21] natural and spiritual. You didn't get
[1:11:23] here the easy way. Amen. Every son that
[1:11:25] comes to God must first be tested and
[1:11:28] tried. Amen. I would say every person
[1:11:30] here tonight, you've either been in a
[1:11:31] trial, you're about to go through a
[1:11:33] trial, or you're going to go through,
[1:11:34] listen, church, every one of you going
[1:11:36] to go through a trial. Amen. Some of you
[1:11:37] are coming out of one. Some of you are
[1:11:39] still feeling the victory of the
[1:11:40] meeting. But don't worry, Satan's going
[1:11:42] to be hanging around saying, "Just as
[1:11:44] soon as the meeting feeling wears off,
[1:11:46] I'm going to be right there to give him
[1:11:47] some more sickness. I'm going to be
[1:11:48] right there to try to bring him down
[1:11:50] again. But don't listen to that devil
[1:11:52] because greater is he that is in you
[1:11:55] than he that is in the world. Greater
[1:11:57] was the the the seed, the life in the
[1:11:59] seed of the lily. Amen. Than the mud
[1:12:01] that tried to hold it down. Come on,
[1:12:03] church. Greater was the seed, the life
[1:12:06] in the seed. Greater was was the life in
[1:12:09] you that was already placed there before
[1:12:11] you were ever born. Greater is that than
[1:12:14] every demon that tries to hold you down.
[1:12:17] Listen, before God ever filled you with
[1:12:19] the Holy Ghost, you were a seed of God.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm going to go am I
[1:12:24] going to go to hell?" If you were
[1:12:25] predestinated for this, you can't go to
[1:12:26] hell. But if there is a seed on the
[1:12:28] inside of you, you will be thirsting for
[1:12:30] life. If there's a seed on the inside,
[1:12:32] you're going to say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:12:34] filled. Lord, I need more of you."
[1:12:35] You're always going to be hungering and
[1:12:37] thirsting and seeking God. Why? Because
[1:12:39] he found you and sought you. And now
[1:12:42] you're going to come running after him.
[1:12:44] Why? because something on the inside of
[1:12:46] you was built for such a time as this.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Ray would go on like this. He
[1:12:51] said the little seed burst open into
[1:12:52] life. It cannot do that until it goes
[1:12:54] through all the process. It's got to
[1:12:55] come through that. He said that's what
[1:12:57] makes it is because that the sun itself
[1:12:59] is what's drawing it. And when it gets
[1:13:00] fully above all the dirty waters and
[1:13:02] muck and so forth, then it's so happy.
[1:13:04] It just gives life out freely.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, why why do we get so
[1:13:10] happy?" because you've pressed through
[1:13:12] and now you've seen the sunlight. Oh,
[1:13:15] come on, church. And now you know that
[1:13:17] you're no longer just a seed, but now
[1:13:19] you can see yourself as a lily that has
[1:13:21] grown and you Well, I hope somebody's
[1:13:24] with me here tonight. Is this making any
[1:13:25] sense? Amen. God has brought you from
[1:13:28] somewhere to where you didn't look good.
[1:13:30] You didn't think you were much, but he
[1:13:32] brought you and set you aside for
[1:13:34] service and clean you up. And he wants
[1:13:36] to fill you with the Holy Ghost. He
[1:13:39] wants to make you a beautiful picture
[1:13:41] and a reflection of the grace of God.
[1:13:43] Can the church say amen?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[1:13:46] He said, "I think that's a beautiful
[1:13:48] type of a Christian life. When something
[1:13:49] is drawing you out of the world until
[1:13:52] one day you're born right into its
[1:13:54] presence by the Holy Spirit. How
[1:13:55] beautiful. If you try to help it, you'll
[1:13:57] kill it." He and he talks about a
[1:13:59] chicken. Some of you will remember
[1:14:00] Brother Windle's story about about the
[1:14:02] duck. And so, Brother Brandon would say
[1:14:04] here, he said, uh, he said, notice, he
[1:14:06] said, he said, right on top of his
[1:14:08] little beak or any bird that's born from
[1:14:09] an egg, it's got it's got an old inner
[1:14:11] part of the egg has to rot away and it
[1:14:13] has to take this little beak and scrape
[1:14:14] back and forth until it breaks the shell
[1:14:16] out. He said, we call it pipping its way
[1:14:18] out down in Kentucky where I come from.
[1:14:20] Pipping its way out. They have never
[1:14:22] found a better way. See why? It's God's
[1:14:24] provided way. You try to help him,
[1:14:26] you'll kill him. Pick the shell off of
[1:14:28] him, he'll die. He's got to labor and
[1:14:31] strain to break forth. And that's the
[1:14:33] way a Christian has to do. It ain't
[1:14:35] somebody just shaking your hand, taking
[1:14:36] you in. You got to lay there till you
[1:14:38] die and rot and are born into the
[1:14:41] kingdom of God. It's God's provided way.
[1:14:43] You don't go in by a book or shaking
[1:14:45] hands or join, pump up, pull down. You
[1:14:47] just simply have to get away from the
[1:14:49] old shell. I say tonight, get away from
[1:14:52] the old shell and just worship God in
[1:14:54] the way that he's worthy of worship.
[1:14:56] Brother Brandon would go on down. He
[1:14:58] says, "Notice, no better way have they
[1:14:59] ever found." They they they found no
[1:15:01] better way for a baby to get what it
[1:15:03] wants besides God's way for it. He said,
[1:15:05] "When that little baby is born, you
[1:15:06] could set a bell down there beside his
[1:15:08] little crib and say, "My little son, I'm
[1:15:09] a theologian in the way I've read books
[1:15:11] on how to raise a baby." And I tell you,
[1:15:13] you're a modern child. You've been born
[1:15:15] in a modern home by a modern parent. And
[1:15:17] when you're hungry or need, just ring
[1:15:19] the little bell. It'll never work. Some
[1:15:22] of y'all parents know this. Amen. They
[1:15:24] do cry for it. Sometimes it's the worst
[1:15:26] time, but they cry for what they want.
[1:15:28] He said, "Don't be ashamed. Say, I'm
[1:15:29] hungering for God." Don't care what the
[1:15:31] deacons, pastors, or whatever it is
[1:15:33] around. Scream out anyhow. The Joneses
[1:15:35] are sitting there. What difference does
[1:15:36] it make? Cry out. That's the only way
[1:15:39] there is to get it until you get help.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "We need quiet." I say, Brother
[1:15:44] Brandham said, "The only way you're
[1:15:45] going to get it is to cry out." The
[1:15:46] prophet in 1964 and 1965, several places
[1:15:50] I saw this, you'll never get what you
[1:15:51] want until you cry for it. You never get
[1:15:53] what you want until you get the
[1:15:54] formality out of the way and cry for
[1:15:57] what you want. Listen, God wants you to
[1:15:59] ask for big things. God wants you to ask
[1:16:01] for your healing. God wants you to ask
[1:16:03] for salvation. God wants you to ask for
[1:16:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he
[1:16:07] has provided a way for you to come into
[1:16:10] the kingdom of God.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[1:16:13] He said the old system had to die in
[1:16:15] order for the new to come on. When
[1:16:16] Wesley's age ceased and all the little
[1:16:18] ages or blades that come out on the
[1:16:20] stalker, the tassel in Wesley's time, he
[1:16:22] said when Pentecost come out with the
[1:16:24] restoration of the gifts, they had to
[1:16:25] come out of the Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:16:27] Pilgrim, Holiness, Nazarene, Church of
[1:16:28] Christ, so-called and all that, they had
[1:16:30] to come out of it, rot away from it to
[1:16:31] accept the new birth. He said, "You're
[1:16:34] always called crazy." But it's as Paul
[1:16:36] said when he rotted out that of what he
[1:16:38] once claimed. Said, "In the way that's
[1:16:40] called heresy, that's the way I worship
[1:16:42] the God of our fathers. in the way
[1:16:43] that's called heresy. See, he had
[1:16:45] accepted the new life that the Old
[1:16:47] Testament had give birth to the new and
[1:16:49] he had to rot away from the old and just
[1:16:51] make it a shadow. He said that's just
[1:16:53] where we are at now. He said, now bear
[1:16:55] with me, but that's my idea. The
[1:16:56] churches has got so systematically to
[1:16:59] you can't get into one unless you belong
[1:17:01] to one. You've got to have a fellowship
[1:17:03] card or some kind of identification. And
[1:17:05] by believing this, the only door I he
[1:17:07] said he had open was the businessmen. He
[1:17:09] said, "As long as they're not an
[1:17:10] organization, I go with them. But I get
[1:17:12] to bring the message that I feel that's
[1:17:13] on my heart to the people. But it's got
[1:17:15] so systematically and I love you
[1:17:17] Pentecostal people. And Pentecost is not
[1:17:19] an organization anyhow. You just call
[1:17:21] yourself that. Pentecost is is an
[1:17:23] experience and not a denomination. But
[1:17:25] you see the thing of it is it's so hard
[1:17:27] for many men when they look at it and
[1:17:29] they believe it and see it so identified
[1:17:31] by God in the word. And yet it's so hard
[1:17:33] to rot away from that thing you've been
[1:17:35] in. What would I do? Where do I get my
[1:17:37] meal? God is your meal. God is the thing
[1:17:39] for you to hold on. seek ye first the
[1:17:41] kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[1:17:43] I'll leave it lay at that. He said, you
[1:17:44] know what I'm talking about. We are told
[1:17:46] by God's prophets that you are that we
[1:17:48] are to have a new earth and a new heaven
[1:17:50] and a new earth if you want scripture.
[1:17:51] He says Revelations 21 and I saw a new
[1:17:54] heaven and a new earth for the first
[1:17:55] heaven and the first earth were passed
[1:17:56] away and there was no more sea. He said
[1:17:58] it was gone. Now if we're to have a new
[1:18:00] earth, the old earth and the new earth
[1:18:02] cannot exist at the same time. Or the
[1:18:05] new world and the old world cannot exist
[1:18:06] at the same time. There can't be two
[1:18:08] world orders together at the same time.
[1:18:11] Now, in order to get the earth, the new
[1:18:13] earth, the old one has got to die. And
[1:18:14] I'm going somewhere. I'll be there in
[1:18:16] just a minute and we'll close. But he
[1:18:17] says now, he said that it's giving birth
[1:18:19] pains for a new one now. So, I want you
[1:18:21] to notice that we are testifying now by
[1:18:24] the world events and the things that are
[1:18:25] going on around us. Amen. That this
[1:18:27] world is groaning, amen, to be to be
[1:18:29] dissolved. And this world is groaning
[1:18:31] for a new earth. This world is groaning
[1:18:34] for something that maybe it doesn't even
[1:18:35] realize. But nature itself is changing.
[1:18:38] I believe we heard this maybe in the
[1:18:39] meetings over the weekend. Amen. That
[1:18:41] the earth is thing that things are
[1:18:43] happening and the the nature is not even
[1:18:44] right. And I believe brother Josh said
[1:18:46] it. He said even the animals are are
[1:18:48] having struggles like they've never had
[1:18:50] before. Amen. But I want to say it like
[1:18:51] this. There is a new heaven. There is a
[1:18:53] new earth. There is a new kingdom. And
[1:18:56] somebody's got to inhabit it. Somebody's
[1:18:58] going to be there. And it's going to be
[1:18:59] those that have worked their way up from
[1:19:01] the toil and the mire and the muck and
[1:19:03] the dirt and the mud. Amen. Somebody.
[1:19:06] Somebody say, "Well, I don't know if
[1:19:07] we're ever going to make it." No, you're
[1:19:08] going to make it because God has chosen
[1:19:10] a bride. You know, God will have a
[1:19:12] bride. And if he called you to this
[1:19:14] message, I would say just hold on to it.
[1:19:16] Amen. And let the message hold you
[1:19:18] because God has called you, Amen, to be
[1:19:21] the inhabitants of the new world.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[1:19:25] He said, one of the first things the
[1:19:27] doctor does, he said, he's been watching
[1:19:28] the patient is to time the pains. And
[1:19:30] he's talking about the earth having
[1:19:31] birth pains here. And he said after he's
[1:19:34] been watching the patient his time the
[1:19:35] pains, birth pains they get, how many
[1:19:37] times the pains, how close they are
[1:19:38] together, contractions and things like
[1:19:40] that. He said how much more terrific
[1:19:41] each one gets. Terrific is probably not
[1:19:43] the word I would use, but but you know
[1:19:45] they get worse and and so and I don't
[1:19:47] not that I know how they feel, but he
[1:19:48] said how much more terrific each one
[1:19:50] get. One is harder to have than the
[1:19:52] other and the next one's still harder.
[1:19:53] Get closer together. And he said that's
[1:19:55] the way he diagnoses the case by the
[1:19:57] birth pain. So if you want to diagnose
[1:19:59] where a world is, amen, watch how things
[1:20:01] are happening. It's getting worse and
[1:20:02] worse. And you say, "Well, we had bad
[1:20:04] stuff happen years ago, but watch, it's
[1:20:06] getting more and more and worse and
[1:20:07] worse. And in the world, we're having
[1:20:09] trouble." Amen. But be of good cheer. He
[1:20:11] said, "I have come to overcome this
[1:20:13] world." Come on, church. You are the
[1:20:15] body of Christ. Amen. You were not put
[1:20:17] here to go down with the world, but you
[1:20:19] were put here to overcome the world and
[1:20:22] come forth and live in a millennium
[1:20:24] reign. Can you say amen? Amen. I don't
[1:20:26] believe it's good enough just to make a
[1:20:27] just to make it to heaven through the
[1:20:29] tribulation and things like that. I
[1:20:31] guess I'd rather see my my my my family
[1:20:32] there that way than any than know not at
[1:20:34] all. But I'll say this. There is a
[1:20:36] bride. There is a bride that's going to
[1:20:38] stand the worst of times. Amen. There's
[1:20:40] going to be a bride that's not going to
[1:20:41] walk away from this message. There is a
[1:20:43] bride that is going to come forth as
[1:20:45] pure gold. There is a bride that she's
[1:20:47] going to look in the mirror one day and
[1:20:48] say, "You know what? Say, yeah, I see
[1:20:50] myself in the scriptures. I see myself
[1:20:53] in the message. I am coming forth as the
[1:20:56] lily. I may have been in the mud. I may
[1:20:58] have may have been in the mire. I may
[1:20:59] have been downtrodden and forsaken, but
[1:21:01] with Jesus, I'm never alone. He said he
[1:21:04] would never leave me. He would never
[1:21:05] forsake me, but he would be with me till
[1:21:07] the end of the world, through every
[1:21:09] toil, every trial, everything we've been
[1:21:11] through. God has always been faithful.
[1:21:13] Can the church witness with me tonight?
[1:21:15] Was he faithful in our meetings? He's
[1:21:17] faithful here tonight. He'll be faithful
[1:21:19] come Sunday morning. I mean, he's going
[1:21:21] to be faithful next week. And if the
[1:21:22] Lord carries, he'll be faithful at the
[1:21:24] next meetings. If you're sick, then God
[1:21:25] can heal you. If you're if you're
[1:21:27] backslid, God can bring you back. If you
[1:21:29] got lost loved ones, God can still bring
[1:21:31] them in because we were not put here to
[1:21:33] lose. But we were put here to win and be
[1:21:36] overcomers in the toils of this life
[1:21:38] that we're going through. Amen. Don't
[1:21:39] let the toils take you down. Don't let
[1:21:41] the trials get you down. Amen. But keep
[1:21:43] pressing on. There's going to be a bride
[1:21:45] that keeps pressing on until she sees
[1:21:47] the break of day. And someday when the
[1:21:49] Lord would come back, he's going to look
[1:21:51] at you and say, "You've worked hard for
[1:21:53] this. Amen. you've toiled and you've
[1:21:54] cared and my grace has brought you this
[1:21:57] far. But then you're going to look at,
[1:21:58] come on, church. You're going to get up
[1:22:00] and you're going to say all of a sudden,
[1:22:01] Brother Herald's going to look in the
[1:22:02] mirror and his hair is going to be
[1:22:04] changed back a different color. Same
[1:22:05] amount of it, but it'll be a different
[1:22:07] color. And he's going to look in there
[1:22:08] and he's going to be saying, "Lord, I
[1:22:10] think the rapture is upon us and his
[1:22:12] loved ones may come in the room with
[1:22:13] him. No doubt his children will be
[1:22:15] standing there." Come on, church. You
[1:22:16] You say, "I I I'll miss it. I might miss
[1:22:18] Don't miss it for nothing because every
[1:22:20] trial that you've been through is worth
[1:22:22] it all when we see Jesus.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Everything you go through is worth it.
[1:22:27] Every time you have to plow, every time
[1:22:29] you have to preach to the people, and
[1:22:31] sometimes you don't feel it. And
[1:22:33] sometimes the people aren't receiving
[1:22:34] it, but if you'll plant the seed, God
[1:22:36] will water it and bring it forth. I know
[1:22:38] sometimes Wednesday nights you get tired
[1:22:40] and things. And my time's almost up, so
[1:22:42] give me five minutes. Will you do it?
[1:22:44] You give me five minutes. Anybody?
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; I got 10 or 15. Thank you.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. God did not
[1:22:53] bring you here to lose you.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; He didn't give you the message just to
[1:22:58] lose you. He didn't give you the message
[1:23:00] and say, "Go ahead and sit in a
[1:23:02] denominational church." He said, "Get
[1:23:03] away from those walls. Come in to where
[1:23:05] the where the glory still is." Amen. And
[1:23:07] I'll tell you what, I I'm ashamed of
[1:23:09] some of our message churches who are
[1:23:11] trying to do away with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:12] moving in the services. That's not what
[1:23:14] a prophet taught. He told us it takes
[1:23:16] noise. If any birth is a mess and any
[1:23:18] birth has got to have some noise to it.
[1:23:20] I'm telling you tonight, I want to see
[1:23:21] our young people. If it takes all the
[1:23:24] noise and and all the screaming and
[1:23:25] shouting, I say scream on. Because what
[1:23:27] I want to see is a birth inside of them.
[1:23:30] I I want to see them come forth. Amen.
[1:23:33] As children of God and not just say,
[1:23:35] "Well, I've joined Word of Life." No, it
[1:23:36] ain't good enough to go to Word of Life
[1:23:38] Church. Amen. You're not going to be
[1:23:39] saved because you come to Word of Life
[1:23:41] or or you go to any other church or
[1:23:42] Christian tabernacle or or or or Word of
[1:23:45] Life in Tennessee or you can name
[1:23:46] Evening Life Fellow, any of them.
[1:23:48] Listen, you're not going to be saved by
[1:23:49] that. You're not going to be saved by
[1:23:51] where your attendance and your
[1:23:52] attendance record. I believe in going to
[1:23:54] church, but that's not how what saves
[1:23:55] you. What saves you is nothing but the
[1:23:58] blood of Jesus. And his grace has
[1:24:00] brought you into a glorious life. And
[1:24:03] so, you don't have to no longer be
[1:24:04] fighting and fussing and saying, "Lord,
[1:24:06] I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:24:07] there." No, but you can see the vision
[1:24:09] that has been placed before you. And
[1:24:11] that is a message of the hour and a
[1:24:13] rapture that is upon the church.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; I say tonight, we need to give up and
[1:24:17] let Jesus take over. We need to give up
[1:24:20] on our own ways and say, "Quit trying to
[1:24:22] do it our own and say, Lord, I know
[1:24:24] there's going to be birth pains. I know
[1:24:25] there's going to be trials. I know that
[1:24:27] this is not a flowery bed of ease, but
[1:24:28] in every in every situation, you've been
[1:24:31] faithful. In every hardship, you've
[1:24:33] always been there. In every time that I
[1:24:35] fell down, you picked me up. Come on,
[1:24:37] church. Every time you had a bad day,
[1:24:39] amen, a good day was coming. Every time
[1:24:41] that the devil tried to tell you you
[1:24:43] wasn't good enough, you could go listen
[1:24:45] to the message of the hour and it wasn't
[1:24:46] about you. It ain't your works that
[1:24:48] saves you. Amen. But is God rich in
[1:24:50] mercy. It's God that brought you here.
[1:24:53] It is God that has raised you up. Come
[1:24:55] on, church. Every one of us are going to
[1:24:56] make mistakes. Every one of you are
[1:24:58] going to fall. Amen. There's a process
[1:25:00] of birth that that is messy. There is a
[1:25:02] process of a birth that is hard. But
[1:25:05] I'll tell you tonight, if you'll just
[1:25:07] hold on to Jesus, Amen. He's never going
[1:25:09] to let you go. But if you'll stay in the
[1:25:11] presence of the sun, then all things are
[1:25:13] possible to the believer.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. Don't worry
[1:25:17] about what's coming. I believe a rapture
[1:25:19] is coming for you, but don't worry about
[1:25:20] the atomic bombs. Don't worry about the
[1:25:22] news. Listen, it's negativity, but what
[1:25:24] you've got is a message that says we're
[1:25:26] going to get out of here. What you've
[1:25:27] got, it says through every every birth
[1:25:29] pain, it's just ushering us in closer to
[1:25:32] a millennium reign. Amen. So when you
[1:25:34] look at the news, I mean, the world's
[1:25:36] going down, but we're not going down
[1:25:38] with it. We're going to be changed. Can
[1:25:40] you say amen?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand would say this. I'm going
[1:25:42] to skip way on down here. Way on down
[1:25:44] here. Way on down here.
[1:25:48] Way on down here. And we're going to get
[1:25:50] to a close. Can we do that? Y'all are
[1:25:53] saying amen. Brother Brandham said it
[1:25:55] right here. He said, "A true picture of
[1:25:57] the modern church today." This is in
[1:25:59] another sermon. and brother Brandham
[1:26:00] actually right here I took this one from
[1:26:02] the invisible union of the bride of
[1:26:03] Christ and I just wanted to finish on
[1:26:05] this one here he said a true picture of
[1:26:06] the modern church today neither does the
[1:26:08] modern church want any of these here
[1:26:09] screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts
[1:26:11] 238 youngans around her yeah see she
[1:26:13] don't want any of them whooping and
[1:26:14] crying and screaming amen hallelujah why
[1:26:16] such a child would immediately put her
[1:26:18] out of her denomination they had one
[1:26:20] like that in one of the churches why
[1:26:22] they'd throw her out right quick why you
[1:26:23] letting such stuff as this go along so
[1:26:25] you see she's pregnant with something
[1:26:27] cuz she's bringing forth members all the
[1:26:29] time, but she don't want none of them
[1:26:31] screaming, hollering, blabbering. Acts
[1:26:32] 238, miserable creatures as she thinks
[1:26:34] they are. It would certainly embarrass
[1:26:36] her.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. He said it would
[1:26:39] certainly embarrass her. He said, he
[1:26:42] said it would ruin her and her educated
[1:26:44] ethical uh scientific society church
[1:26:46] that she belonged to here. They would
[1:26:48] throw her out at the next council. She
[1:26:50] can't have it. So, she don't want to be
[1:26:52] pregnant with the word because that's
[1:26:54] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:26:56] forth. All right,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; somebody ought to say amen to that. When
[1:27:00] you think we're too emotional, that's
[1:27:01] the only kind that the word can produce.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, the word the word is all
[1:27:06] I need." But the word will produce a
[1:27:07] birth. The word will produce a changed
[1:27:10] life. Come on, somebody. The word will
[1:27:12] change you and make you act different.
[1:27:14] The word will bring forth an Acts two
[1:27:16] church.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Brother Brham would
[1:27:19] say, "Born of the spirit of God, it has
[1:27:21] the spirit of God in it." No
[1:27:22] intellectual church join and creed
[1:27:24] going, Bob hair, painted face. There's
[1:27:26] no such thing as that in all of it. You
[1:27:27] don't find that in the word of God. You
[1:27:29] find an old-fashioned, sanctified, Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost fil of the spirit of God,
[1:27:33] screaming, hollering, shouting, and
[1:27:35] praising God.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Is he worthy of it? Did he bring you
[1:27:39] this far? I wonder if you would come.
[1:27:42] Record time right there, buddy.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; I told you I wasn't going to hold you
[1:27:46] long tonight. I want to tell you
[1:27:48] something. When the meetings are over
[1:27:50] and the devil comes back around and
[1:27:52] says, "Well, the preachers are gone, the
[1:27:54] services are over, the crowds get
[1:27:55] smaller, but he never left me.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; He's still the same God tonight as he
[1:28:01] was on Saturday night. He's still the
[1:28:03] same God on Monday morning as he is on
[1:28:05] Come on, church. Have we limited God's
[1:28:08] power? Have we put God in a place that
[1:28:10] he can only be here on certain days or
[1:28:13] only on Sunday mornings?" No. God has
[1:28:16] called us to live for him and and to die
[1:28:19] daily. So that it's a life of sacrifice
[1:28:22] to the believer. Amen. But we know that
[1:28:25] God is right there all the time. Every
[1:28:27] time you have to make a decision, God is
[1:28:29] there.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Every time you have to call on on the
[1:28:32] name of God, he he's always there to
[1:28:34] answer you. Every time there's a child
[1:28:37] that's sick, he's never too far away.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Every time you need a job, God's not
[1:28:42] that far away. He can provide for you.
[1:28:44] He's our healer. He's our provider. He's
[1:28:46] everything to us. The least we can do is
[1:28:48] quit trying to become a formal church.
[1:28:50] But praise him anyway. Praise him in the
[1:28:53] valley because he's going to bring you
[1:28:54] to the mountaintop. Praise him down in
[1:28:56] the mud because he's going to bring
[1:28:57] forth a lily. Praise him in the pig pin
[1:29:00] because he's going to bring back
[1:29:01] prodigals. Come on, church. What we need
[1:29:03] tonight is praise him anyway because God
[1:29:06] inhabits the praise of his people. And I
[1:29:08] want to be where the people are praising
[1:29:10] God.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Let's stand to our
[1:29:12] feet tonight.
[1:29:15] worthy of it all.

[1:29:35] Oh yes,
[1:29:37] you are worthy of it all.

[1:29:44] brought you through? You are worthy of
[1:29:47] it all.
