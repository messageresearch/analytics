Lord this evening amen our brother Joel's going to be speaking for us amen so let's everybody pull from the word of the Lord Let's help him out tonight amen trust we're all awake amen and ready to go let's just pull from the gift of the Lord see what the Lord has in store for us amen let's make this our prayers brother Joel comes amen as the word comes forth we want him to draw Us close amen and help him to help obey amen let's sing this to him tonight is brother Joel Jesus Draw Me Close closer Lord to you amen make this your prayer now this world around me Let It Fade Away Jesus Draw Me Close oh now closer Lord to you for it's my desire to worship amen tell him that tonight now amen is that your desire from your heart [Music] Jesus dra be close closer Lord to you let this world around me Let It Fade Away we're singing now now Jesus Draw Me Close OH Close Lord to you for I desire to worship Him oy as they would play that softly I wonder if we have a need on our hearts tonight I know there's a SP a very speci special request for our brother Harold we want to continue to remember him I'll be going over there this afternoon as soon as we leave here to go uh visit him there and pray with him in the hospital and I think we should each hold him up he wasn't doing well at all today um he said he was on having aib trying to shock his heart to come down and uh possible bleeding that they can't find and so uh we want to continue to remember him in prayer I believe God can still heal I don't care how old you are I don't care how young you are don't care who you are God's the Healer you believe that tonight and so I think if we could just join our faith together the doctors won't find nothing because there won't be nothing there and so I I think that's what we want to pray tonight because you know when one is hurting in our family we need to lift him up in prayer we need to pray together pray for one another love one another can you say Amen to that it doesn't really matter you know well I'm not related to him I don't care if you're related or not what we need to do is love one another how do you know love God because you love one another and and and if you love somebody you're going to go before the throne and pray for that person with love in your heart that's right and it's not going to be a cold formal prayer but it's going to be a heart to receive because God God is not the author of confusion he's not the author of hate but he's the author of love and so let's love one another let's pray for one another I think we should do that much more you see the enemy coming in and trying to take young people and old people and every one of us he's coming com after you believe we're in a fight tonight every one of us are dealing with something let's let's let's just go to the father tonight and ask him to take control of the situations around us wonder if we could each bow our heads if there's something on your heart you pray right where you're sitting let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord you see the enemy coming against our brother you see the enemy coming against the bride in this time that we're living in Lord Jesus I pray Lord you would just help us to recognize that there's a land here that's full of promis and all we have to do is cry out to you Lord You're the chief Captain you've never lost a battle you've never lost a war and you're not going to lose one now but Lord we ask Lord that your will would be done in each life that's sitting here today Lord if there's a sick among us someone Among Us Lord that would need a refilling of the Holy Ghost Lord I pray this would be their service we don't want to come Lord just for show or just to just to have another service Lord but I pray you would raise us up to to be more like what you would would want us to be Lord may we reflect you in our everyday lives may we reflect Lord you to our co-workers and the ones that are around us may everything that we do and say Lord in this service and and tomorrow and throughout this week May It Be Something Lord that uh that that that would be pleasing to you Lord may we help somebody else help us to live a life that would that would be worthy of the gospel and I pray you would be with us now be with each one sitting in this service and I ask you would move me out of the way Lord to speak to these people tonight I ask Lord you would just come a special way now we ask in Jesus name amen amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight you'll have to forgive me I broke my glasses I can't see most of you so that's good if you don't back me I couldn't tell anyway I can hear though Hallelujah so uh we're going to just get right into the word tonight and if I can see it we'll read it and I I would like to speak tonight this land is worth the fight and I believe that the promises that we are all trying to achieve are here right we're not looking for a promise to come the promises are here we're in the promises of God we're living in the land of promise but you've got to fight to get to them because it it is a time where Satan is trying to take each one of you out this is an age where we're so close to the end that Satan knows if he can't get you that you're going to take a Rapture oh you say the devil don't know that he does know it see he knows it better than you know it and he believes it but he can't live the word of God so what he's trying to do is try to take with him see he he knows he's going to hell he knows where his kingdom is and he's trying to take you with him but I think there's a group of people here today it's a group of people getting ready to leave this world and we need to be in the Battle of a lifetime in the fight for our lives and for our families to not try to stay here and get pulled down by the things of the world but let's press on towards the mark let's keep pressing on keep moving forward Le let's not stay down here and get get tied down by things that would hold you back but let's go ahead just keep fighting the good fight because at the end there's victory for every one of us do you believe it tonight amen if we could go to Ephesians chapter 6 uh it's chapter 6 there brother Robert in verse 10 we're going to go to verse 10 and Paul here is telling us how to get ready for battle and so we just want to uh just set a platform here for a few moments I won't hold you long tonight and Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord can you say Amen to that and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having all having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gir about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet Shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of Faith how many's going to take that Shield here tonight wherewith ye shall be able to quench all somebody say all the fiery darts of the wicked you say Amen to that tonight if you take on this uh uh take on the shield of Faith you can withstand the fiery darts of the wicked that's coming after you here tonight so and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and you can have your seats here this evening and Paul is telling us how to get ready for battle and God here has promised us an inheritance how many knows that y'all are starting off quiet you you pull real fast I'll preach fast we'll get out of here fast at the rate we're going so far it's going to be a long service amen so so we understand if you're getting ready for battle then you know you have an enemy to fight can you say Amen to that you know you've got an enemy now our enemy is not your husband your wife it's not your family your enemy is not your your brother it's not your sister but the enemy is the devil can you agree on that with me the enemy has come in this day but God has promise to raise up a standard now I'd like to show you just by the word who the standard is you know who the standard is in this day it is a bride that has been called out who has withstood a test already and she will be in a squeeze I believe we're in one right now I'm not looking for a squeeze to come but I believe the squeeze is here and you're in a a fight right now and you must learn learn how to fight this fight in order to overcome it because if you don't know how to fight the fight you're going to be lost in battle but if you know how to how to put on the shield and the helmet and and and and G up your loins and and if you know how to fight if you know how to prepare for battle then you know that you can win because you've been given an equipment to win you you've come equipped to the battle and you know what you're going to do see you didn't come to a picnic you came to a Battleground and in this day you're going to find that that the battle is in your mind and the battle the the battle is a is a spiritual battle it is a battle that that if you if you watch closely you'll see that it is a Warfare that is in your mind and and many times there'll be somebody coming to church on a Sunday morning and Satan will put something in there to to make you fuss with your wife or fuss with your husband because Satan doesn't want you to get a blessing from God in that service see that's a battle that you got to fight you may have to fight it every week if you haven't overcome that one yet maybe you haven't overcome the fact that that you just can't get right with God to enter into the service yet maybe you don't know how to worship but you got to fight the devil trying to hold you back from worship you say well I just don't feel like it that's a devil trying to hold you back from the blessings of God anything that is trying to keep you from the promises and the land of promise is the Devil Himself trying to keep you out of the land of promise now remember it's nothing but a scare tactic that is trying to keep you out because Joshua and Caleb would come across the land there and they had already seen God move in mysterious ways and mighty ways and they were following a Vindicated Prophet can you say Amen We are following in this day a Vindicated Prophet we're not looking for a prophet but he's already come and he's already restored the word back to the church so all we have to do is re realize who we are we are a people of the promised land we have already been given the promised land but there's going to be many things that come in our way that is going to try to hinder us from making it there there's going to be Giants in the land there's going to be walled cities in the land there's going to be many things try to stop us from get into the land but greater is he that is with you greater is the pillar of fire that we following than Pharaoh's Mighty Army that all drowned in the sea greater is he that is leading the way and that's what you got to realize the scarecrows are going to come the the trials are going to come the everything's going to come at you why because the devil knows who you are if he's not fighting you then you know you've already lost the battle but if you are in a fight here tonight then God is already trying to show you there is a promised land that you must achieve but you're not there yet but you're on a journey and and I'm going to tell you the promised land is not 40 years away but the promised land is right here tonight if you can accept it you realize that the reason it took so long to get there is because they mured and they complained and because they they didn't recognize it wasn't very far at all they could have made it in just a few days but they couldn't trust God's leading they always had to well the man is not good enough well I say the Mana is good enough the ministry today is not good enough I say the ministry is good enough you say well we just don't have enough we don't have enough people sitting in the pews I I I we need to see a church fold to have Revival Revival starts in you that devil is trying to take you out by trying to get you to look at somebody else and try to focus on your brother or sister but we need to focus on the word of God and the promise that has been given us because the promise said where're two or three are gathered I am in the midst and if he's here tonight it's because his word said he would be here it's not something we have to wonder did God show up at church yes he's here because of Promise did you feel him well he was there anyway see it's a battle of the mind that you've got to fight and overcome and so so in Joshua chapter 1 and we're going to go down at verse five there brother Robert and he says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee that's a promise that's a promise you're going to the land and he's not going to fail you he's not going to forsake take you but he's going to stay with you now I'm going to tell you this if you can just accept the promise then you don't have to worry about the Giants in the land Joshua and Caleb didn't look at the size of the walled cities they didn't look at the size of the Giants in the land but they look to the promise of the word of God and I say today if we can look to the promise of the word of God it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter what your body is trying to tell you how sick you are but if you look at the promises of God there's an overcoming people here today that know who she is you have been positioned in the land all you have to do is accept the promises that God has given you be strong in verse six and of a good courage that's what we need here tonight for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto the fathers to give them verse seven only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest do you want to prosper stay with the word it was given to a Vindicated Prophet then and if you stayed with the word you would Prosper if you would stay with the land you if you would stay with the word of God then then then then then the word of God works you believe that the word of God when he promised healing it works but you've got to accept it as a promise you've got to accept accept it as the word of God you can't say well well well I just don't know how to fight this enemy well Paul is telling you here how to fight it you've got to have faith you've got got to believe the word you've got to go into battle prepared for battle because I'm going to tell you when you go out of here on Monday morning every one of you sitting here today are going to fight another battle it's just the way it is because as long as you're here you are in the fight of your life and that's because Satan knows he hadn't got you yet so I I don't want him to quit fighting me but I want to have the courage and the grace to know what I'm fighting against and to be able to know the devil and know his tactics and and recognize him when he comes along so I'll know my enemy I can recognize who he is and then I can fight that enemy when he comes after me you young people Satan's going to come after you in ways that you may not even think of right now but he's going to come after you because see you understand the God of this evil age has gotten greater and greater and if you couldn't see it happening in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and some of you Elders may remember that in 70s and 80s if you could never see it more plain it's happening right now because you can see that Satan has tried to take over your minds with with with not just television cable television looks really good compared to what we got now we've got so much going on now that that that everything we've got is to try to attract your minds away from the things of God and it it is actually a fight that Satan is putting out there but he's very he he's very Savvy he's very very smart with how he takes up your time and he's very smart with how he gets you away from the things of God he knows if he can get a phone in your hand then you can't read your Bible anymore he knows if he can get a phone in your hand then you won't want to pray anymore but see what we do is we fight against that I'm not preaching against the phone I'm not preaching against that what I'm preaching against tonight is the devil that is trying to distract you from the word of God because if he can take one thing away from you if he can take your helmet away from you he can cut you off if he can take away your faith then he can he can get a spear into you but if you'll take a hold of the spirit tonight if you take a hold of the word of God tonight no devil in hell is strong enough to defeat the army of God yes sir right all you have to realize is who you are if you know you're in God's Army if you know the word of God you've got is true then don't look at nothing else come on somebody don't look at nothing that's trying to distract you but keep your eyes focused on Jesus be equipped be ready because we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against Satan God's enemy brother brand says principalities and wickedness and evil spirits wickedness in high places and we're pressing towards the mark of the high calling and we are C certainly in a battle that's what he said and no Nation would dare to send a man on the battlefield untrained can you say amen he might not only get himself killed but he would get another group killed as well he he says he doesn't know how to take a hold so he must be prepared for it and the nations are wise to that so they get their men ready every war they have a training period the these men are not just taken off the street and and giv an AK47 or or whatever they use and stuck into battle and say hey go kill these people first off they might kill the wrong man they don't know who they're after they don't know the purpose of the war they've just been put into battle no these soldiers in the army of God have got to be trained with the word of God to know how to fight the devil that is coming against them and so brother brandom said usually in the old Soldiers when they put on these ornaments of War they had a big belt and they had buckled it together holding over their loins these shields to keep the enemy Spears off he said what a real lesson that is to us when the lawn begin to get weak he said and the shield they would tighten it up on their belt sometimes you get a you get a little ax in your walk and you just get a little bit uh you know you just get a little bit uh I don't know how you would say it but you just kind of get just just kind of off to the side and and you get tired maybe of the journey and and you're sitting there well I just don't know how much more I can fight tighten up your belt listen to the word of God get in a good service somewhere where you can really feel the power of God move I mean I think it's time that we quit playing church I think every service needs to have the spirit of of God moving in it you say why is that I say because we are in a fight now and we need to recognize the presence of God it's where souls are born again it's where our children can come back to the Lord it is recognizing your position and in order to do so you need to be in the presence of the chief Captain who's never lost a battle because when he speaks to you it's something different than just some man speaking to you I can stand here and try to tell you something but if God doesn't open it to your heart then it won't do you any good if God doesn't open your heart to Revelation then won't do you any good but we've got to March and we've got to walk we've already given our orders how to March but I think now it's time to go ahead and buckle up and get your Shield get your helmet get your spear I think it's time now that we start fighting the greatest battle ever fought why because this is the time when God knows that there was going to be a spirit in the land so he had to have a soldier right and so in this time there is a spirit now let me tell you what that spirit is that we're fighting it is a spirit of leosia it is a spirit of cold old formal church members he doesn't actually care if you go to church as long as you don't participate in church he doesn't care if you go to church as long as you're not getting a blessing from God in church he really likes it when you go to church and you pick on your brother and sister because he's using you to seow Discord in the body come on somebody you say well that hurts but it's true he don't care about your church going but he does care if you're getting a blessing or not now if you love God you go to church but just going if you're going for the wrong reason and the wrong motive that's not going to do you any good you've got to fight the spirit that is trying to hurt your brother and sister and fight against that enemy at all times you don't ever give up in this battle this is not a battle where you take some days off this is a full-time battle Satan is every day on the trail trying to take your kids out what are we giving our kids what are we teaching our kids what are we doing for them what are we trying to help them with do you realize the fight they're going to go through when they're teenagers do you realize the fight of their that that that they're having to go through right now in their minds it's much worse than even when you were a kid or when your grandparents were a kid this is not the same time but in this time Satan has got worse and worse because he realizes there's a spirit of Illusion over the people that you don't have to worship no more you don't need a service where this convicting sermon preached anymore but what you need back in the Holy Ghost in the church is the holy ghost moving on the people again it'll take care of the spirits that are trying to get in and hurt the body so what we need to do tonight is realize that we are not fighting each other amen right because then you're just doing the devil's job for him you're fighting each other well you're not doing this and I understand that all of us have come short every one of us are going to make a mistake if you didn't make a mistake then you're not human welcome Mr Robot you're not W you're not you're not you know you're not you're not even human you don't even know what I'm talking about here tonight but if you're human you know that there's a battle that you fought before yes and you know that there's a battle coming brother Bram said you either just got out of a battle you're either in a battle or you're going to go into a battle there's there's not a whole lot of room to lay down your lay down your armor is there so you got to fight all the time a and not not to be just a fighter not to be just a you know walk around well I I I I you know I'm just fighting everybody because this person might have had a bad Spirit no no you can still have love you can still love one another you can still be a Christian come on somebody you can still be a Christian and fight the devil let's not get it twisted up fighting the devil is not fighting amongst yourselves because it's not really important that you're fighting the other person's Spirit fight the spirit that's trying to come on you or me see if I realize I'm getting cold then I need to fight that Spirit now when you're getting cold you got to fight fight that Spirit we can stand up here and preach that you need to enter in and accept the blessings of God but ultimately you're the one that has to make the decision I'm going to fight that Spirit of the cold Le to see and age just trying to overtake me Well I this was on my heart I hope it's okay I'm not trying to preach to anybody or hurt nobody but I just want to tell you this I think we need to recognize when you come to church we need to enter into the presence of God because it may take a little bit of a battle to get there but it's worth the fight this land is worth it in that land is where all the promises lay in that land is where the healing lays in that land is where you can possess the goodness of God in that land it it may look like it's a walled City it may look like the Giants are coming but did you know that God has promised that land to you and if he promised it to you Giants are going to fall then the walls are going to fall and God won't lose a one of his people that have went into into battle with god on their side so brother bam goes on down here and I'm going to skip a little cuz I'm right running out of time but he said every man that's born of the spirit of God comes into Christ has everlasting life and puts on his shield his breastplate standing ready and forbidden to leave until orders to March oh isn't it marvelous he said aren't you glad you got all harnessed up tonight You Soldiers I can say yes I'm glad I'm ready and when I get weak I know that I can go back to the word and I can read the promises of God and know that there that there's somebody with me even when I don't feel like fighting some body goes before me in battle he said now right here he said look I'll give it to you the land's over there but before you get there you got to fight he said that's what's the matter with people today you're afraid to stand and fight he said what we need is I must fight if I should rign increase my courage Lord I wonder if that's a prayer of ours tonight because I think what we've done is we thought we could just go through life so easy I become a Christian everything's easy now well come on somebody anybody here ever become a Christian and everything just went smooth I question your experience if you did that's right I tell you why because it's not possible if Satan's not fighting you then he's already got you so if you're not fight so you are fighting if you're here and you're a Christian tonight you are in a battle that's right you are absolutely in a battle now everybody battles different things at different times you can say well you can preach on this battle and this battle and this battle but really what you got to recog izes you have the authority as a Believer to win every battle I don't care what it is you put a name on it you have the authority to win it he said I'll give you this land he said increase my courage Lord and he he goes on down he says I must fight if I must Reign he said oh we're so wishy-washy boneless and helpless I'm going to say this because brother brandom did spineless as worms you know I don't anyway he said I think of old buddy Robinson he said he got down to the cornfield he said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back to earth you're going to find a pile of bones laying here he said if we ever get to that sincere that something's going to happen Lord he said give me plenty of knowledge in the Gable into my soul let me fight the devil as long as I got a tooth in my mouth and then gum him till I die I say that's what we need to do tonight let's quit just laying around letting the devil you you realize that the devil is the biggest Bluff you got do you realize and I've told you this before did you know that he knows he's a bluff but he don't know that you know you need to know he's a bluff you need to recognize that he has no power over you he has no authority over your life he has no authority over your happiness he has no authority over your marriage or over your children he has no authority over you because you're God's children you are part of the land that God promised well come on somebody you know I I think we we get beat down by the devil and we let him beat us up and he has no right to us come on somebody God has given us Authority and we allow the devil to do what he does because he has no right to hurt you he has no right to walk in your land he has no right to overtake you but God has given you a spirit that is not a spirit of fear but is a spirit of Victory and I say tonight that we need to recognize your Victory recognize your freedom know who you are recognize the land that God has given you and all the promises that are there that that are there that it is Faith and it is it is love it is Joy it is peace all the things that God has given us are in the land of promise here today can you say amen and so go brother Brandon would go on down here he said he said uh he said Paul speaking is talking about the Battle and he said he said and one thing he said Hebrews there he said they was talking about a runner and he said seeing that we are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sins that easily beset us sir he said he's speaking he said he's speaking there of the Olympics maybe or the Roman circus and he said so now he's speaking of armored men going into battle and how he's got to prepare himself self and he said he goes on down here he says and I have give you he was talking about the land that he gave to him he said he said my name is in him but if thou will indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I'll be an adversary to thy adversaries can you say amen he said if you'll obey his voice he said then I'll be an adversary see notice he said I'm going to send him now and I'm going to give you already he said here it is I've give you Palestine it's yours he said now it's all fenced in with hivites jebusites parasites amorites it's all fenced in but I've give it to you it's yours come on somebody it's yours he said now let's break that down for just a moment God didn't say I'm going to go give go in there and empty it out for you come on now God didn't say I'm going to go in there and just make a clean land with no no Giants no walled cities it it's you know it's just all there it's easy just walk over there you're not going to be scared because there's nothing to face but he did he put Giants in the land he allowed wall cities to be there why because it took somebody that would believe the word to go go in there right that's a test right there that's a word test if you really believe you can speak and go over but if you don't really believe it the Giants are going to scare you Satan's going to Bluff you but you got to believe the promises of God he said I've give it to you now go fight he said there you are God's give you healing tonight he said every one of you is give you healing it's your possession can you say amen he said it's all bound down with amorites and Canaanites and everything else of unbelief but he said go in and take over it's yours it belongs to you come on somebody if you're dealing with something and sickness in your body tonight do you realize if you go claim the healing that God has already given you that all you have to do is possess it claim it and take over that part of your body again say you know what Satan that's mine God gave it to me Satan has no right to it he said this is not a picnic it's a battlefield not a place where we lay back and say Lord you just come force it down he doesn't push you in one one end of the pipe and pull you out the other end where're in a battle that's not the way it works he said you're in a battle he said no he said you don't do it that way God never did it that way he said he said there's the land he said and yet some of the Israelites when they looked at it they said why we can't take that why we look like grasshoppers upside of them big people but when the spies came back there was Joshua and there was Caleb and they knew what God had said there's the key right there do you know what God's word said today have you have you recognized the word of God for your hour have you recognized your day and its message you can take a hold of that word of God and take it into your soul and it'll it it'll it'll defeat every enemy that comes against you can you say amen he said why Jericho was so big till they could run two chariots around in a horse race how can we go in there with our little Spears and so forth the gates are shut up great men in there look like Giants and the Canaanites probably the descents of ham he says and he said how could we ever go in and take that he said they looked at the natural part he said how could this woman ever walk how could that one how could this man ever get out of out of the wheelchair how could this man here he said he's going to fixing a die in a few days with heart trouble he says how could he be made well right now he said it's unreasonable you can't reason it out God hasn't been known isn't known by reasons no man understands it you've got to accept it by faith and say it so I wonder if we could do that tonight quit trying to reason out well well this sickness here it might be the one that takes me out because I don't think there's a way for it to be cured or healed there is a way it is the promise of God that says by his stripes you are healed you know this is this is an age here if you look back and you realize that Joshua and Caleb they didn't have the message like you've got yes they had a Vindicated Prophet but do you realize how many cases of healing that you've seen or heard on tape seen on video you've you've even known about it right here in our local assembly there's healing that's taking place there's there there's been there's been dead raised i' I've known I know him personally that have been raised from the dead and you tell me God can't do it I said he's the same yesterday today and forever yes sir but see we've got to speak and go forward because all those things are part of the promised land but the main thing is and I hope you get this tonight the main thing is to follow the word of God for your day because you can see the signs you can see the Wonders you can understand the first pull second pull but you've got to go in where all the promises have been made real to you and it is the word being revealed to you it is you becoming part of the word oh come on now you becoming part of Christ the word you becoming him he became you so that you could become him I hope you see that tonight and he said Jesus he said he said now he's G you the promise it's yours every one of you was healed 1900 years ago when Jesus died at Calvary I know there's a whole lot of he said Briars growed up in it there's a whole lot of Canaanites standing there saying days of Miracles has passed there's a whole lot of perizzites saying I don't believe in them holy rollers but he said go in and take it it's yours God give it to you it's a promise go on and take it anyhow if God said so what do you care about the Canaanites come on somebody if God said you're healed what do you care about that cancer trying to get a hold of you what do you care about that heart trouble trying to get a hold of you if God's the Healer and I say he is tonight then recognize him as such and believe in the promises of God you say well there's been something to get a hold of my mind and and Satan has got me on this internet program or something let me just go ahead and tell you that's the devil also and God is greater than that enemy trying to take you out amen right he said go take it brother brandom said there's a there's a person here he said but it is he said he said but there's Canaanites there he said he said those long-faced people that say says the days of Miracles has passed he said it is for them y all right if you say you don't believe in the holy ghost moving again then the Holy Ghost ain't going to move for you if you say you don't believe in in in God moving in the church again and the Holy Spirit coming in among the people and fallen on the people then maybe it'll never happen for you but there is a people who have not given up One Promise who have not laid down for one minute and let that devil overtake them with that kind of battle in their mind he said sure he said it wasn't for you it's only for believers that's all he said it's not for unbelievers now he said go take it he said I'll send he said I'll send my angel he will prepare the way and he said if you notice when they got over there one was looking at the material things and the other one was looking at the spiritual things the promise of God and I'm going to read quickly here as we as we get to wrap this thing up he said now we're longing for somewhere where there's no death no sorrow no heartaches no old age we're all looking for that place right he said that land is somewhere and will never be able to achieve it by guns and and fighting and so forth of the natural and carnal weapon he said but there is a land that we can go to and it's a battle to get there he said and when he said and when God gave Israel Palestine when he was in Egypt but he said he had to fight for every every inch of it and he told Joshua he said wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that have I given you so Footprints was possession see he said keep walking I think we need to do that tonight keep walking there's a promise and I see the Promise ahead of me I'm gonna keep walking I possessed another promise I've been healed I've been saved but I want my children healed I want my children saved I want my family to come back we keep on going see the promises don't stop just when you receive the Holy Ghost but that's when the battle begins some of you people are sitting here tonight and I heard a preacher say this the weekend and I'll repeat it he said some of you are sitting here tonight he said and you don't know that you've got the Holy Ghost you don't know that you've been born again because Satan has beat you up about it but when the battle begins is when you receive the Holy Ghost that's when we need to start fighting you say well I fell I made a mistake that's no cause for you to give up that's the devil trying to get you but if you recognize that as the devil then take a hold of the promise of God I wasn't backslid I I I'm just moving right along the de the devil never got got me Christ has got me God has got me see the devil has tried to tell you you're not good enough to be in The Bride of Jesus Christ but if you're sitting here tonight then I tell you you are good enough you don't know what I've done I don't care what you've done God has given you a seed on the inside and yes you might have went through a lot of things yes you might have had to go through battles yes you might have had to go through a lot of hard times but God he showed he he had a seed on there and he knew that that seed would grow through all the darkness and through the muck and the mire that would come through but when it got to the light it recognized the light and then it would Blossom as a as a beautiful flower as a lily I tell you tonight I see some people I know you've been through some some things but God has given you the ability to Blossom like a lily he has given you the ability to Blossom like a rose you say well I've come up and I was in darkness I was I I'll tell you I feel like preaching to you from a minute I was so low down that I couldn't even see bottom no more but do you realize that God in his goodness and his grace he came to where you were you never sought God but God came right down there to the place you were and he said you know what my grace is sufficient for you my strength is made perfect in weakness I will not leave you comfortless but I will send the Holy Ghost to you God doesn't want you to go around and acting like you're a children of the devil you're not children of the devil you're children of God you're children of God you say why are you preaching the promises because Satan's beat you up long enough you say why you preaching that way I just ain't all my notes but I'm going to tell you I feel a pull to go this way Satan is trying to hold you in the condition that you're sitting in but if you release the change tonight God can move you out of the change that you're in right now you say what do I have to have I say it takes a a stand for God what do I have to do brother Joel I said throw up your hands and release the change right now say I don't have to be be bound down to the devil anymore I don't have to do what the devil tells me to do because I'm being led by a pillar of fire and by the message of the hour I'm being led to the promise of God by the message of the hour and the life that has come don't let that devil Bluff you don't let that devil keep you down God is greater than that devil you realize sickness has just come along as a scarecrow you say well I deserve it no you don't deserve that sickness that's well I deserve for my children to be that way cuz I wasn't a very good parent no you don't deserve that a bit it's true raise them right but I'm going to tell you this if you did all you can do stand on the Promises of God there you go stand on his promises let him know you're standing on him when you come to the house of God I'm not going to give up in one inch to this devil my children are backslid stand on the promise that they're your children amen thank you Lord yes sir well yes sir we'll move on here true man come on he said while they were in Egypt God could have went down there and brushed all them little Hittites and everything out and said move on in that's right but that's not God's way that's right everything you know God could come come down tonight somebody in here may be dealing with a serious sickness he could come in right now and just take that out of you but he wants to see do you have the faith to overcome that thing because he wants to build a Powerhouse our pastor preached on that a few weeks ago he wants to build you individually not a power church not a power program but an individual Powerhouse that can be built into the stature of a perfect man you've overcome you and it's not a seven-step program when God when when God sought you out and you accepted the baptism of the Holy Ghost you were sealed to the day of your Redemption come on somebody he's not going to give you the Holy Ghost and take it back he's not going to seal you and then unseal you when you're sealed you're sealed to the day of your Redemption well that may not preach everywhere but I'll tell you tonight if you want to go study the message of the hour God will tell you through a Vindicated Prophet that that he's not an Indian giver he didn't give it to you just to take it back he's not going to heal one person and not heal another person he's not going to deliver one person a pornography or some evil spirit and not deliver somebody else but if he did it for one he could do it for every person here tonight why because your land is in sight and all you have to do is claim it you're standing on this side of the river in unbelief you're standing over here and all you have to do is step over here come on and the promises are there but you're scared because of the Giants well come on somebody you're scared because of of the battle of I may not fit in you're scared of the battle well if I go over here with this group that call me crazy come on I don't really care that's right you shouldn't care do you realize that every godall person throughout the ages has been just a little crazy to the world even Jesus come and did all the good things that he did and they they called him be elub and fortune teller they thought he was crazy and the greatest gift that God could send to the world come on somebody you're telling me he was crazy Paul was telling people about seeing a light and hearing a voice and they called him crazy we we we point to a picture of a man that had a light hanging over him it was a Vindication the angel of God the light the God himself standing there vindicating a prophet and you call us crazy I say this we're Bible Believers because we're just like they were you can call us crazy you can look for faults you can look for mistakes but you know when Abra it says he it says he made mistakes and he said all the things about him in the Old Testament but if you go over here to the New Testament and you look at what it said about Abraham he staggered not at the promises of God over here under the law you're going to look at brother Isaac we'll just use you for an example and you're going to tell him all the bad things he's ever done and oh he's done this and this but no he came under the shed blood and now over here under grace and the atonement that's been shed for him you can look at him and say I never see any of it he's a Perfect Bride of Jesus Christ what is it Satan's over here trying to show you what you did the law was over here and I'm not doing away with the law but what I'm telling you is this that Grace has come to restore people back in this generation you had to be a virgin bride and the only way you could be a virgin bride was to be restored back under Redemption oh brother Stuart not to steal your sermon title but this is the place to worship when you're redeemed and you recognize that now is the time to worship the Redemption has come the blood has covered your sins and that's the time to give God praise for what he's done for you oh you can look back and you can look back and maybe it's good sometimes to reflect on where you've been because you know you know what maybe I'm not right where I need to be at this moment but you know what I know I'm not where I used to be I know I'm not the sinner that I once was and I can't even see those things anymore because God has taking it out of my mind I don't even know the way I was because you're looking at it and it's just like a big old it's like a blob of Blackness over here and you look at it and you can't see nothing there and you know what God is even taking it from your memory because he says forget about the things in the past and press forward and the prize and the mark of the High Calling that's where all things are possible that's where the promis is Lay that's where you can have your healing that's where you can have your children that's where all things are made new in this land of promise can you say Amen so we go on down here I'll try to I'm going to try to hurry my time is up he said if you're sick don't wait for somebody to come by like some special healer or some special healing service some totem pull or to touch he said God is a God who keeps his word all you need is his word we don't have to worry we don't have to wait for nothing we don't have to wait for the meetings next summer we can have it now sir he said just reach up and take the promise oh but that's too simple but that's all you got to do it's easier now to receive healing than it's ever been because in the Old Testament maybe you had to go to the Brass serpent or maybe you had to do a certain thing or maybe you had to jump through some hoops even to be saved or you couldn't go into the temple and all these things but do you realize you're under Redemption today do you realize the blood has been shed for you and your sins do you realize that everything you've done is in the sea of God's forgetfulness if you've repented there is no wrong in you I see no wrong in the bride of Christ but it is a virtuous pure sinless spotless Lamb of God that has come to make you just like him thank you Lord he said it's yours for every believer we just got to be Believers tonight Church we've got to accept the promise that have come I if there's a church over here saying well we don't need ministers no more well if the if the word says we do there's a purpose for them come on somebody see and that's what happened to Eve was she got one word off and that's where she fell that's where she could not be restored she could not be the perfect bride that God wanted she could not be what God had in his mind from the beginning to have to have perfect family and and and raise up perfect uh lineages from Adam and Eve but no he couldn't do it because she listened to the devil and just one word one word we don't need preachers we don't need preachers we don't need the holy ghost in the church no more come on somebody we don't need God moving among our young people they act a little crazy I'd rather see him acting crazy right here than out in the world running the nightclubs and and and and and sinning and out here in all kinds of movie theaters and with their friends and and watching these bad movies and things I tell you I'd rather see them right here having a little bit of fun than to be out there with the things of the world I think we need to fight for our children to have a place to come into where they can be born again of the spirit of God because God has not giving you the spirit of fear but he wants you to come in uh courageous and bold Before the Throne of God you young people don't be scared don't be scared to get a little excited in church don't be scared to say Amen just because you got a few older people in the church that said we don't like emotion or we don't like noise I said do away with that if God has moved Upon Your Heart To Worship I say worship God with all you've got fight through that spirit that is trying to hold you back fight through that Spirit that's trying to keep you out of the house of God fight through that Spirit of division among the Brethren and among the churches fight through that spirit and take a hold of the love of God and the promises of God and all things that God has got for you that's what he wants tonight he wants a group of Believers that are Standing on the Promises he wants a group of Believers that says I'm not giving up I'm not going to turn around and take the way of the world but I'm going to take the way with the Lord just by as few I'm going through no matter what the trial is because on the other end is Victory on the other end is something that I've been told about in the message of the hour it is a perfect land where we're all young again where there's no more sickness and there's nothing that'll ever take your place that there's nothing that can ever take you out of there there's nothing that can give you a bad Spirit or a bad day but what it is is Christ that has given you this place I went to prepare you a place I tell you what somebody's going to go there he didn't go prepare a place that's never going to be lived in but he went and prepared a place for a bride that is called Mrs Jesus Christ and I believe I'm looking at her today can you say amen I believe God Has Come among the people in this hour and said you know what I've raised up a prophet like unto Moses I've raised up a prophet now I've raised up a people that can take the promised land I've raised up a people that not going to doubt and go back into denom denominations I've raised up a people who they don't want nothing else but the word of God and if the word of God says we can shout if the word of God says if you that that there's an to this then I'm going to take some emotion with it but ultimately I'm going to go back to the word and when the word is preached and the power and the demonstration of the Gospel then the word will move upon my heart and if there's something in there that's unclean let the word come in and wash it out to where you can be free and clean before the God and you can go in a Rapture that's what I want for every one of these young people I'm not looking here at these people today and saying I just want good Christians I just want good Baptist I want good message people come on somebody I don't want just some good people that can sit around and they can listen to a tape and and things like that I believe in listening to the tapes by the way I believe in hearing it I think we need to do more of it in our homes and I think we need to do turn it on in the cars and and listen to it I believe in that with all my heart but let me just go ahead and tell you this that's not going to save you you've got to come under the shed blood of Jesus Christ and the atonement for the hour you've got to come to a place to where all things have been made new and it's only under the blood of Jesus and it's only in the baptism of the Holy Ghost where you can really live a Victorious Life you tell me well I I've got to get to a certain place where can live come on somebody I got to get up here where I can live a Victorious Life and then God will give me the Holy Ghost well that's another devil you need to fight you need to get that devil out of your mind because it's not how you live it's how he lived through you that's where the people get messed up they think I got to do it it's my works it's my time it's God in you it's Christ in you that is the opening of the word Christ coming down and living in his people sir that's what we need to do tonight I'm over my time give me two more minutes on I'll quit qu he said now you say then the promise is mine he said sure yeah but you'll fight for every inch of it yeah yes sir come on somebody on you'll fight for every inch of it till you he said until you're well you'll take every step of it it's a battle the promise is yours he said there was a promised land they had to fight to get every step of it and the promise is yours but you'll fight every inch of it come on somebody it's a prophet speaking he said he said I was called to God to preach the gospel 30 one years ago I fought ever since you want to be in a battle get called get be become a preacher welcome to the battle Hallelujah he said welcome to the battle I I tell you what you want to be in another battle become a Christian well I don't want to be in a battle well without any fight there's no Victory come on somebody you got to fight that's why sometimes the best Services the ones you have to you have to fight to get to sometimes the ones where Satan's trying to keep you out of church and Satan's trying to get you to go this way and that way and do something else and then you end up getting there and you're like my goodness I'm glad I didn't miss that one but I'm going to tell you this even if you didn't feel good about going you took sides with Jesus doing that even if you didn't feel like shouting you took sides with Jesus by being there but when you come why not entertain the presence of the Lord while he's here why not come into the presence of God knowing his promise that he'd be here knowing this is a land of promise knowing it's a time of worship under Redemption knowing it's a place of of praise and worship to God then I say we ought to come with all of our hearts I think we ought to come and fight through that Spirit that's trying to make us cold well come on somebody I think it's time we try to fight that spirit because you realize that's the spirit of the age that's the spirit we're fighting against you say why why don't we fight against emotionalism I'm not really worried about that you know if it's just emotionalism it'll die out eventually but let me tell you this the cold Spirit on the church is the one I'm worried about the one that comes in and gets everybody looking like they can't worship no more the one that gets in where there's no healing no more and the one that comes in and there's no move of the spirit no more and there's no young people getting saved there's no young people coming back to the Lord I'm not talking about just an emotion but if there's something real in there then the people will change and their lives will reflect what happened to them and I think tonight that's what we need to see is get past just looking at the emotion and criticizing this group for being too emotional or criticizing this person for shouting a little too loud I say bring it on and if it's really of God then God will vindicate it with a life lived but let's not let's not criticize them because if it is of god then you found yourself in the seat of the scornful if you criticize a move of God you found yourself criticizing God come on somebody I'm not I'm I I understand I understand the rain falls on the just and the unjust I know not all emotion is God moving on the people some of it they're just having a good time I know that but I'm not going to tell you who's real and who's not real what I'm going to say is this preach the word and let the word take a hold of their hearts and people will respond to the word of God if there's a ceed within there to respond with and so you can say well I you know the people are just getting out of control let's let them get saved let's create an atmosphere of freedom for the people I I I think we need to sometimes I think an altar experience you can put the altar out of the church but I think an altar experience is absolutely necessary in the time we live in I I think a move of God in a service is absolutely necessary in the time we live in I I think a move of God is is so necessary you know why because he said where Jesus is there's a lot of noise and I just can't unsee that script or that quote I can't unsee it and I'm going to tell you this I understand he comes in a sweetness and the in the presence sometimes it's just like a glow over the congregation I love that too but I say however he comes let's entertain him while he's here let's entertain the angel of the Lord I can say he could come in this way or that way it ain't up to me how he comes but it's up to me to entertain him while he's here it's up to you to worship him when he walks down your high do you realize if the greatest person in this world could walk into this church there would be a presence that there would be an aura about that person the most famous person you can think of an idol of yours I hope you don't have any but if you do if that person walked into church here tonight you would light up and glow because your favorite persons in church take a queen or a king or a former president and bring them in here and and and they would get all the respect and and all these things but let me just go ahead and tell you this he is here here and if he's here then that should put a glow on your face is he your favorite come on somebody Jesus is here I can prove he's here I know he's here it's not a feeling it's not a sensation it's not an emotion but it's a promise in his word and you're living in the land of promise so worship him while he's here can you say amen I wonder if our musicians would come and I wonder tonight if we could just worship him while he comes while he's here you say well I don't know that he's here but he's promised he'd be here are you two or three if there's more than that here tonight there may not be very many but let me just tell you this if you and one other person are here then Jesus showed up to see what this meeting was about and he's wanting you to worship him he showed up just like he did in Simon's house you've heard the pastor preach on it a couple weeks ago you heard him preach on it how he showed up at Simon's house he didn't go in there and just make himself known right away but you know he sat down in the corner but somebody needed to recognize Jesus was there and the one that recognized him her sins were forgiven and I think if you you say well I'm a sinner I don't have no right to worship he won't take my worship oh come on somebody I get so tired of that God will accept your worship if you'll just repent and say God I'm coming back to you I'm not looking at what I did he's not even looking at what you did he didn't look at that woman but he looked at a Heart of Worship she recognized the presence of Jesus and I say the land that we're living in the time of the promise is here and I say this land is worth the fight to live in I say this message is worth fighting for I say the word of God in your F in your home is worth fighting for your marriage is worth fighting for your children are worth fighting for it's not just going to be a a picnic it's going to be a battlefield but I say it's worth the fight here tonight I think that's what we need to recognize God has given us the authority to walk all over the devil's head here tonight come on somebody God has giv you the authority to cast that Spirit of unbelief out of your mind you say well I'm a sinner sin is unbelief drop the unbelief amen start believing amen and God's here to take you as one of his I don't believe in quick experiences I do I say the thief on the cross made it I say the thief made it you say well I don't believe in death bed experience well I don't put a whole lot into those either but I'll tell you this if this is your last chance tonight I believe God can take you as one of his Chosen Few right here tonight you don't have to jump through no hoop Hoops here in this church I'm going to tell you if you'll accept God on the basis of his word that you are an overcomer that you are an heir to the land of promise all you got to do is accept it and God will take you as one of his all they had to do was go take the land but they couldn't doubt they couldn't look at the Giants quit looking at the fear quit looking at the complications and the you know well I don't understand the word just right just stay in it get to that land and the grapes are going to be there the word's going to be revealed to you this is the land this is the time of revealing the land is here I say it's time to get into it Worship in it believe the word of God that he's given us let's stand together I can't even walk oh yes I can't even even walk without you holding my hand oh the mountain and The Valleys to wide down on my knees I learn how to stand and Lord I can't even walk without you holding oh like that can you sing it again oh oh I can't even even walk without you [Music] holding oh it's too high and The Valleys to wide down on my knees that's where I learn how to stand oh lord I can't even walk without you holding my hand let's sing this verse Oh and I thought number one would surely be me oh when I thought I could be what I wanted to be Oh I thought I could build on life seeking sand but Lord I oh do you know he's holding your hand here tonight oh without you holding on to my hand oh with all your hearts now oh Lord I came even walk without you holding my hand oh the mountains too high and the valley to why down on my knees that's where I learn to stand cuz Lord lord I

never we're never saved if we backslide maybe we didn't have the Holy Ghost now that's not necessarily true the Holy Ghost wants you to live right the Holy Ghost will bring you back you Lord doesn't mean you can't mess up when you mess up don't say well I was never any good anyway when you mess up come back home God wants you God sold you in the pig pin where you were God knew where you were but your father was waiting right there for you to come back God wants you to come back more than you want to come back he's got the word ready he's got the robe ready everything's ready for you to come back all you have to do is accept it today I believe God is here to do something special for people in this church tonight not because I preached not because brother Stuart preached an outstanding message this morning but I tell you why I here because he promised it and I believe there's somebody here tonight who has grabbed a hold of a promise of God you said I want my family back and they're coming back let's quit looking at the symptoms quit looking at how far they left quit looking at how far they've gone but they're coming back home why because God said so and God cannot lie give God praise in the church tonight tell him you love me say thank you Jesus for bringing my children home my grandchildren back he deserves your praise his blood is still covering the sins of the people it's still bringing people back it's still I'll tell you what there's Miracles still working in the land just because the third pole and the opening of the word came it didn't do away with the Miracles it didn't do away with the healings it didn't do away with salvation if God's calling you it's your time to come home oh let's sing with all our hearts now pray today oh it will never never
