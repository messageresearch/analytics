[36:12] in Jesus name
[36:16] amen
[36:18] amen I'm going to read from Revelation
[36:22] chap 6 verse 12 we'll read down through
[36:26] verse 17 tonight we uh approach The
[36:30] Sixth
[36:31] Seal and my intention again with these
[36:34] uh first six seals to get you interested
[36:38] so it's not uh an overview by any uh
[36:41] means or comprehensive by any means
[36:44] there's so much here I'll say this uh
[36:47] I've gotten so much out of going back
[36:48] and listening to the sermons again so be
[36:50] it do us good just to do that you know
[36:53] we still believe the message around here
[36:55] and we still believe God sent a prophet
[36:57] and and he did that for a reason so it's
[37:00] for us to hear and and so uh we uh I
[37:04] really would encourage you to do that if
[37:06] you don't get one of these Wednesday
[37:07] nights maybe go back and listen to that
[37:09] then go back and listen to the tape I
[37:11] think that would do you good where
[37:13] brother brandom taught it because uh
[37:15] there's so much more than what we can
[37:16] get to in a 30 minute or 45 minute time
[37:19] frame but thank you for being patient
[37:21] with me as we go through this six seal
[37:23] tonight there's just so much here we're
[37:25] going to have our Bibles open because
[37:27] there's so much scripture he uses in
[37:30] this Revelation 6:12 I beheld when he
[37:33] open the six seal and oh there was a
[37:35] great earthquake and the sun became
[37:38] black as sackcloth of hair and the moon
[37:40] became as blood and the stars of Heaven
[37:43] fell into the Earth even as a fig tree
[37:46] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[37:49] shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven
[37:51] departed as a scroll when it is rolled
[37:53] together every mountain and Island were
[37:55] moved out of their their places and the
[37:58] kings of the earth and the great men and
[37:59] the rich men and the chief captains and
[38:02] the Mighty Men And every Bond man every
[38:04] free man hid themselves in the dens and
[38:06] in the rocks of the mountains and said
[38:08] to the mountains and rocks fall on us
[38:11] and hide us from the face of him that
[38:14] sth on the throne and from the Wrath of
[38:16] the Lamb the great day of his wrath has
[38:19] come and who shall be able to stand I
[38:23] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[38:24] the word you may be seated
[38:33] these things in the six seal happen
[38:35] after the bride is gone the bride cannot
[38:39] go through the tribulation the more I
[38:41] read about the tribulation the more I
[38:43] want to be a part of that
[38:46] bride but I realized I can't make myself
[38:48] a part of it he had to choose me to be
[38:50] part of it but I would say today that
[38:53] the fact that you've heard you're you're
[38:54] the chosen of the earth just to have
[38:56] heard heard and just to have known the
[38:58] message of the hour so I'd say you might
[38:59] as well put yourself in the in the bride
[39:01] group there ain't no point being a
[39:03] foolish virgin there ain't no point in
[39:05] being a gentile it's going to be a hard
[39:08] time for the Gentiles as well as the
[39:09] Jews after in the tribulation period and
[39:12] we know that that's what this six seal
[39:14] speaks of is tribulation the bride
[39:17] cannot go through tribulation but the
[39:19] brandom said cause she she has not one
[39:23] sin not one sin we can just stop there
[39:26] and preach for a while not one sin all
[39:30] right I go back to communion can I take
[39:33] communion brother the B not one sin
[39:37] against the bride that's past present
[39:39] and
[39:40] future right the the mistakes that we
[39:42] make you don't even see
[39:44] it are you with me now but you wouldn't
[39:46] want to break that for nothing right
[39:48] right you you wouldn't desire there's
[39:49] nothing in you to want to break that to
[39:52] want to go against his word but if you
[39:54] do something that was wrong there is
[39:55] there's not one sin that the bride has
[39:59] well that ought to set us on a solid
[40:00] place that that ought to put some
[40:02] Foundation underneath our feet and and
[40:04] something there are bad things don't
[40:07] happen to us because we sinned right
[40:09] because how could God judge us for
[40:11] something that he doesn't even
[40:14] see how can he put us through
[40:16] tribulation when we're already
[40:19] perfect brother Bram said a man doesn't
[40:21] marry a woman and then and then try to
[40:23] reform her and and put her through a
[40:25] bunch of hardship know he marries her so
[40:27] he can keep her so he can so he can
[40:29] protect her from every every evil on
[40:31] every hand I'm so glad that's where the
[40:33] bride is today sir not one sin not a
[40:36] thing against her the grace of God has
[40:38] covered her over and the bleach has took
[40:41] every sin so far away there's not even a
[40:43] remembrance of it he said not a thing
[40:45] but Purity perfect in the presence of
[40:48] God he said oh it ought to make the
[40:49] bride get down on her knees and cry out
[40:52] to God Amen such a wonderful thing we
[40:56] could preach that all night brother
[40:57] brandom in The Sixth Seal and and many
[40:59] of you are familiar with this he he
[41:01] tells a western love story so if you
[41:04] want to hear a good love story go to the
[41:06] six seal and listen to that I can't tell
[41:09] it like brother brandham did he tells
[41:10] about the the man from Chicago the the
[41:13] son of the owner of the armor packing
[41:15] company and how he he come down to a big
[41:18] shindig that they had going uh down in
[41:21] the west where they had the the the
[41:23] ranch and that they own and all the the
[41:25] the girl girls there the daughters of
[41:27] the foreman they were dancing and
[41:29] parting dressing up and getting ready
[41:31] trying to attract this young man's
[41:32] attention but one night he sees a young
[41:34] lady go out from the kitchen and she's
[41:36] carrying a dish pan of water she's
[41:38] Barefoot she doesn't have any shoes on
[41:40] and she's walking down to the coral to
[41:43] throw away the water he sees her and he
[41:45] goes around the coral to meet her and he
[41:48] he meets her out there runs into her and
[41:49] she's shy and he begins to talk to her
[41:51] and the next night he he finds a reason
[41:53] to go talk to her and the next night he
[41:55] finds another reason to go talk to her
[41:57] and he finds in her a character that
[41:59] those other girls don't have and he told
[42:02] her he said you know I found this
[42:03] character in you he said will you marry
[42:05] me and she said yes what else was she
[42:08] going to say she said yes and then but
[42:12] he he went away he said I'm going to
[42:13] come back at a certain time and and
[42:16] we'll be married and so he goes away to
[42:18] prepare her home and she said I've never
[42:20] had a home he said I'm going to make you
[42:22] one oh is that the way you feel tonight
[42:25] and uh she never had a home he's going
[42:27] to make her a home and so what does he
[42:29] do he goes out and uh or she goes out
[42:31] and she starts saving her pennies and
[42:33] preparing herself brother the brand said
[42:34] it was a perfect type of the Bride
[42:36] trying to prepare herself trying to get
[42:38] her wedding garment ready and and and
[42:40] sew it or whatever she had to do to put
[42:42] it on and she said all her all her
[42:44] cousins laughed at her and made fun of
[42:46] her and said you said today was the day
[42:48] and you said this was the hour and he
[42:50] hasn't come yet she said I got five more
[42:52] minutes and she said about the time that
[42:54] five minutes was up you could you could
[42:56] hear the sand under the wheels of the
[42:58] Buckboard here he come driving up and he
[43:00] put her up on there she left her
[43:02] denominational cousins behind oh I love
[43:05] this story she left her denominational
[43:07] cousins behind and went home to be with
[43:09] him I tell you that's where we're at
[43:11] church before the tribulation Falls
[43:13] we're going home to be with
[43:15] him right we've been chosen for our
[43:19] character not because we were rich not
[43:21] because we had anything else but God saw
[43:23] a character in us not even a character
[43:25] that was for here on the Earth but
[43:27] something before the foundation of the
[43:28] earth he chose us above everyone else in
[43:32] the world I just have to be grateful
[43:35] that don't make me arrogant or hotty
[43:36] just makes me
[43:39] grateful now brother brandom in The
[43:41] Sixth Seal he tells the people to take
[43:43] their Bibles and I want you to take your
[43:44] Bible tonight if you have one with you
[43:46] and we'll put it on the screen if you
[43:47] don't but and he tells them take their
[43:50] Bibles and open it to Matthew 24 and
[43:53] Revelation
[43:54] 6 take our Bibles and hold them like
[43:57] this and with your fingers in the Bible
[43:59] so you can see Matthew 24 and Revelation
[44:02] 6 and he's going to
[44:05] compare those two
[44:07] scriptures so we're going to do that as
[44:10] as we kind of lay a foundation and then
[44:11] go into the Sixth
[44:13] Seal remember this seal is the Judgment
[44:16] seal it's a tribulation period now
[44:18] Scholars have always said Matthew 24
[44:20] Jesus is speaking of the coming judgment
[44:23] he's speaking of uh of of of uh the his
[44:26] second coming and and the tribulation
[44:28] period And so brother brand was going to
[44:29] compare that to the seals Matthew 24:1
[44:33] Jesus went out and departed from the
[44:34] temple and his disciples came to him to
[44:37] show him the buildings of the temple and
[44:40] Jesus said unto them see you not all
[44:41] these things verily I say unto you there
[44:43] shall not be left here one stone upon
[44:45] another that shall not be thrown down
[44:48] they they couldn't even imagine how that
[44:49] would happen as he sat upon the Mount of
[44:52] Olives the disciples came to him
[44:55] privately saying tell us when shall
[44:58] these things be what shall be the sign
[45:00] of th coming the end of the world
[45:02] brother Bram said this happened on
[45:03] Tuesday afternoon April the 4th 830 and
[45:07] then Tuesday evening they came to him
[45:08] privately so he's at the temple and then
[45:11] he goes and sits on the Mount of Olives
[45:13] and they ask him three
[45:15] questions they say when shall these
[45:17] things be as one what shall be the sign
[45:20] of th coming that's two and of the end
[45:23] of the world that's
[45:24] three Jesus answers all three questions
[45:28] now brother Brandon begins to compare uh
[45:31] the seals to in Revelation 6 so go to
[45:34] Revelation
[45:35] 6 and then you're at Matthew 24:4 and
[45:38] Revelation
[45:39] 61 Revelation 61 I saw when the lamb
[45:42] opened one of the seals and I heard as
[45:44] it were the noise of Thunder one of the
[45:47] four beasts saying come and see I saw
[45:50] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[45:51] on him had a bow and a crown was given
[45:53] to him he went forth conquering to
[45:54] conquer we found out that was an
[45:56] antichrist deceiving Spirit right now
[45:58] most denominations teach that that is
[46:02] Christ in fact I I found almost all of
[46:04] them teach that but go back to Matthew
[46:07] 24:4 what did Jesus say Jesus answered
[46:10] and said unto them take heed that no man
[46:12] deceive you for many shall come in my
[46:14] name saying I'm Christ and shall deceive
[46:17] many right so let's go to the second
[46:19] seal Revelation
[46:22] 6:3 Revelation 6:3 when he'd open the
[46:24] second seal I heard the second beast say
[46:26] come and see there went out another
[46:28] horse that was red and power was given
[46:30] to him that set there on to take peace
[46:32] from the earth and that they should kill
[46:33] one another there was given unto him a
[46:35] great soar and compare that with Matthew
[46:37] 246 do you believe this message is
[46:40] scriptural it's absolutely it has to be
[46:43] because all of our foundation of our
[46:45] Doctrine has to come from the scripture
[46:48] so Matthew 24:6 what what does it say
[46:51] you shall hear of war and rumors of War
[46:54] see that you be not troubled
[46:56] all these things must come to pass but
[46:58] the end is not yet let's go to the third
[47:00] seal Revelation
[47:04] 6:5 when he'd opened the third seal I
[47:06] heard the third Beast say come and see I
[47:09] beheld in L Black Horse He that sat on
[47:10] him had a pair of balances in his hand I
[47:12] Heard a Voice in the midst of the four
[47:14] Beast say a measure of wheat for a penny
[47:17] and three measures of barley for a penny
[47:19] I love the voice speaking saying see
[47:22] thou hurt not the oil and the
[47:23] wine right and compare that to Matthew
[47:26] 24:7 the first part of the verse Nation
[47:29] shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[47:31] against Kingdom and there shall be what
[47:34] famines famines what kind of famine
[47:37] spiritual famine for the word of God as
[47:40] well as natural famines but it was
[47:42] spiritual famine that the seal was
[47:44] talking about because the Catholic
[47:45] church had it all locked up okay the
[47:47] fourth seal Revelation
[47:50] 6:7 Revelation 67 are you with me so far
[47:54] it says and we need open the force still
[47:55] I heard the voice of the fourth Beast
[47:57] say come and see and I looked and beheld
[47:59] a Pale Horse and his name that set on
[48:02] him was death and Hell Followed With Him
[48:05] power was given unto them over the
[48:06] fourth part of the earth kill with sword
[48:08] and with Hunger with death and with the
[48:10] Beast of the earth and compare that with
[48:12] the last half of that seventh verse
[48:16] again nation will rise against Nation
[48:17] Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be
[48:19] famines and pestilences earthquakes in
[48:22] diverse places pestilences diseases
[48:24] death right we' we've seen a little bit
[48:27] of that haven't we diseases death
[48:30] pestilence is brother BR said that Pale
[48:32] Horse He was spiritual death if you look
[48:34] up that word pestilence it's a plague
[48:36] it's a plague and the last plague that
[48:38] that strikes this nation is not coid
[48:41] right right it's spiritual death
[48:44] spiritual death is the LA we see it
[48:45] everywhere today it's the last plague
[48:48] that strikes the nation so so it says in
[48:52] Matthew 248 all these are the beginning
[48:54] of Sorrow so there's your four seals now
[48:57] the fist seal Revelation
[48:59] 69 Revelation 69 when he' open the fist
[49:02] seal I saw on the altar The Souls of
[49:04] them that were slain for the word of God
[49:06] and for the testimony which they held
[49:08] they cried with a loud voice saying how
[49:10] long oh Lord holy and true do thou not
[49:12] judge and Aven our avenge our blood on
[49:14] them that dwell on the earth and white
[49:16] robes were given unto every one of them
[49:18] it was said unto them they should rest
[49:20] yet for a little season until the fellow
[49:22] servants also and their Brethren should
[49:24] be killed as they were should be
[49:25] fulfilled now let's go to verse 9
[49:27] Matthew
[49:30] 24:9 now what does it say then they
[49:33] shall they deliver you up to be
[49:35] afflicted shall kill you shall be hated
[49:38] of all Nations for my name's sake now we
[49:40] know there are Christian Martyrs he's
[49:42] speaking of but now look and then shall
[49:44] many be offended shall betray one
[49:46] another shall hate one
[49:48] another if you didn't if the Nazis
[49:50] weren't a that people that hated people
[49:53] I don't know who was right ikan and
[49:56] Hitler and those people that did that
[49:58] Stalin what there was hate on the earth
[50:01] for people why because the Bible said
[50:03] there would be right it it was it was
[50:06] there's something coming and God knew
[50:08] about it doesn't that give you faith and
[50:10] courage you know if he knew about that
[50:12] didn't doesn't he know about your life
[50:14] doesn't he know about what would happen
[50:15] in your life and the things you've been
[50:17] going through he knew that before it
[50:18] would come if he knew this this many
[50:21] years before it came thousands of years
[50:23] before it came to pass now look
[50:26] six seal Revelation
[50:28] 6:12 now we get down to where we're at I
[50:32] beheld we need to open the Sixth Seal
[50:33] we'll just read 12 and 13 when he opened
[50:35] the Sixth Seal and lo there was a great
[50:36] earthquake and the sun became black as
[50:38] sacko of hair the moon became as blood
[50:41] and the stars of Heaven fell into the
[50:43] Earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[50:45] untimely figs when she shaken of A
[50:47] Mighty Wind let's compare Matthew
[50:51] 24:29 remember there's there's many
[50:53] things Jesus says between that but now
[50:54] look at verse 29 it says immediately
[50:58] after the tribulation of those days what
[51:00] was the tribulation of those days Hitler
[51:02] and ikan World War II right shall the
[51:06] sun be
[51:08] darkened huh that's coming up the sun
[51:12] will be darkened the moon shall not give
[51:14] her light what did it say over in
[51:17] Revelation there was a great earthquake
[51:19] the sun became black as sackcloth of
[51:21] hair the moon became as blood it's the
[51:23] same thing yeah right that's the
[51:27] tribulation and so he says and the Stars
[51:30] shall fall from Heaven the powers of the
[51:31] heaven will be shaken that's exactly the
[51:34] same thing he says in Revelation 6:13 he
[51:36] said that the stars of Heaven fell to
[51:38] the Earth like a fig tree casting her
[51:40] untimely figs when she shaken of A
[51:41] Mighty Wind so then brother brandom
[51:44] tells us that he omits the seventh
[51:46] seal right but he goes and he says this
[51:48] he said verse 32 Matthew
[51:51] 24:32 and that's the last that we'll
[51:54] deal with there in comparing those twoo
[51:56] he said now learn a parable of the Fig
[51:58] Tree when his branch is yet tender and
[52:01] putteth forth leaves you know that
[52:03] summer is n now who is the Fig Tree how
[52:06] many know Israel Israel's the Fig Tree
[52:09] what happened in 1948 I think sometimes
[52:11] we need to go back and learn our history
[52:14] something happened in our in our time if
[52:16] you could say it that way people that
[52:18] are alive maybe here in this building in
[52:20] 1948 I don't want to date you but uh I
[52:23] know there's folks that are listening on
[52:25] tonight that we're alive but I know
[52:26] brother sister Curtis you guys were
[52:29] alive in 1948 there's probably several
[52:31] others that were too I think about you
[52:33] were you were alive when this scripture
[52:35] came to pass right this is recent this
[52:38] just happened oh my when his branches
[52:41] yet tender and put us forth leaves you
[52:43] know summer is not something coming yes
[52:47] so we've seen that now in during the the
[52:50] purpose of the sick seal and you think
[52:53] about it what what what's the purpose of
[52:54] theur tribulation period it's not just
[52:57] although it is God punishing the Earth
[53:00] but it's not just that the SI what the
[53:02] sick seal does is it purifies the Earth
[53:05] for the Millennium but it also it also
[53:09] takes the uh foolish virgin and they're
[53:12] killed during that time because they
[53:14] have to be purified right and that's
[53:16] those who didn't have the fullness of
[53:18] the atonement they were not the bride
[53:20] but they were good to the bride or they
[53:21] had uh they they had some there was some
[53:24] way that they make it in and then that's
[53:27] maybe a denominational believer somebody
[53:29] like that I'm not sure exactly how
[53:31] that'll work but God knows who those
[53:33] people are so then uh there's another
[53:36] group though and this is the main reason
[53:38] for the sick seal is the Jews because
[53:41] there's 144,000 Jews I want to watch
[53:44] want you to watch this brother Brown
[53:45] types it to Jacob Jacob he calls it
[53:47] Jacob's trouble Jacob wrestling and if
[53:50] you if you go and and study the Jewish
[53:53] Nation you find that they wrestle with
[53:54] God
[53:55] with the concept of being the chosen
[53:58] people they're wrestling with the idea
[54:01] of being God's people and and the fact
[54:04] that they are God's people hasn't done
[54:06] them much
[54:07] good right think about that they've been
[54:11] they've called themselves God's people
[54:12] and so people persecute them people make
[54:14] fun of them people hate them and all
[54:17] they'd have to do is give up their
[54:18] testimony and they wouldn't hate them no
[54:20] more that sounds familiar doesn't it so
[54:24] it it seems like it' be so much easier
[54:26] to not be God's people and I've heard
[54:28] Jewish people actually Express that we
[54:30] were chosen for what right chosen for
[54:33] persecution chosen for uh for misery
[54:35] chosen to to be killed but there's more
[54:38] than that that we're also chosen to be
[54:41] delivered right because Israel will be
[54:42] saved as a nation all of predestined
[54:44] Israel be saved as a nation now so he
[54:47] said Jacob wrestling with God until they
[54:50] see something real that something real
[54:52] will be the two prophets of Revelation
[54:54] 11 we'll get to that in just a moment
[54:56] but brother BR said there stands Moses
[54:58] there stands Elijah he said and they'll
[55:00] wrestle with God until 144,000 of the
[55:04] tribes of Israel are called out right
[55:06] there and he said these come preaching
[55:08] repentance he said like John the Baptist
[55:11] they preach repentance to go back to the
[55:13] word of God to Believe In Christ and and
[55:17] I like the fact that they preach
[55:18] repentance people say well preaching's
[55:20] over I don't think so come on because
[55:22] even after the Gentile age the two
[55:24] prophets are going to preach
[55:26] they preach
[55:27] repentance it's amazing to me that God's
[55:29] not going to take a tape player and
[55:31] preach to him but it's going to be
[55:34] prophets right men I'll have to stand
[55:37] there Anointed with the spirit of Moses
[55:39] and Elijah or however it'll be brother
[55:41] brand said he he thought that it would
[55:42] be men Anointed with that spirit so they
[55:45] come and they preach and the sun becomes
[55:48] black right refuses to give her light
[55:51] now that's happened
[55:52] before right so brother Bram goes back
[55:54] into Exodus chapter 10 and we find when
[55:56] the Lord said to Moses stretch out thy
[55:58] hand toward Heaven that there may be
[56:00] Darkness over the land of Egypt even
[56:02] darkness which may be felt what was this
[56:04] the Deliverance of Israel the
[56:06] Deliverance of the nation of Israel at
[56:08] that time the sun is darken Moses
[56:11] stretched forth his hand toward Heaven
[56:12] There was a thick darkness in all the
[56:13] land of Egypt three days they saw not
[56:16] one another neither Rose any from his
[56:18] place for three days but all the
[56:19] children of Israel had light in their
[56:23] dwellings he said' now God was about to
[56:26] deliver Israel there all right bring
[56:27] them out of their enemy hand which was
[56:28] Egypt at that time he said now here he
[56:31] is bringing them out of the Roman hand
[56:32] where they made their Covenant remember
[56:34] they make a covenant with with Rome and
[56:36] then the Covenant is broken and then all
[56:39] nature lets
[56:40] loose right at the preaching of those
[56:42] two
[56:43] prophets Daniel 121 this is the time
[56:46] frame at that time shall Michael stand
[56:48] up the great Prince which standeth for
[56:50] the children of thy people there shall
[56:52] be a time of trouble such as never ever
[56:55] was since there was a nation even to
[56:57] that same time and at that time thy
[56:59] people shall be delivered everyone that
[57:02] shall be found written in the book amen
[57:05] the BR said the predestinated you see
[57:06] that's written in the Lamb's Book of
[57:08] Life shall be delivered at that time he
[57:09] said here God is about to deliver his
[57:12] second son Israel after the tribulation
[57:14] he had his only begotten son was Christ
[57:17] his second son was Israel and those he
[57:19] delivers them by the ministry of the two
[57:21] prophets Revelation 11:3 is where the
[57:24] two prophets prophets are are in the
[57:26] scripture he said I will give power un
[57:28] my two witnesses they shall prophesy
[57:30] 1,2003 score days as three and a half
[57:33] years clothed in
[57:35] sackcloth east of the two olive trees
[57:37] the two candlesticks standing before the
[57:39] god of the earth and if any man will
[57:41] hurt them fire proceedeth out of their
[57:43] mouth and devoureth their enemies BR
[57:46] said that's the
[57:48] word you think the word's not powerful
[57:51] yeah he said that's Holy Ghost Fire
[57:54] God's word expressed through a prophet's
[57:56] lips yes brother BR takes that he said
[57:59] when Moses he said that it was a thought
[58:01] that God that came to Moses he said it
[58:02] was God's thought that you put in moses'
[58:05] heart he said and then Moses spoke it it
[58:07] became the word of God right all right
[58:10] so that's what these prophets are going
[58:12] to be they're going to preach the word
[58:13] of God but they will not be Gentiles so
[58:16] someone comes to you and says well I'm
[58:18] one of those two prophets whether
[58:19] they're
[58:20] not right they're not number one they
[58:23] wouldn't be coming to you and telling
[58:25] you they got a people to preach to and
[58:27] it's not
[58:29] us right and I got personal history with
[58:31] that my dad thought that he was one of
[58:33] these two prophets so I've studied this
[58:35] man
[58:39] I but I've known several and that come
[58:42] popped up from time to time be one of
[58:43] these two prophets they're Jews right
[58:46] they they come to Israel they speak Holy
[58:49] Ghost fire nature is erupted at their
[58:51] message right it's not some preacher out
[58:54] here somewhere making tapes and calling
[58:56] themselves Moses or Elijah but they have
[58:58] Holy Ghost Fire Revelation 11:6 these
[59:00] have power to shut Heaven that it rain
[59:03] not in the days of their prophecy who
[59:04] did that Elijah did that power over
[59:08] Waters to turn them to blood to Smite
[59:10] the Earth with plagu often as they will
[59:11] who did that Moses did that so we know
[59:14] who these two prophets are brother
[59:16] brandom picks that up he said what is it
[59:18] what can bring these things but the word
[59:21] amen oh if the word of God's going to
[59:23] change nature what do you think it's
[59:25] going to do what do you think brings the
[59:28] Rapture you realize it won't be emotion
[59:31] it won't be sensation it won't be a
[59:33] church it won't be it'll be the word if
[59:36] the word spoken by a prophet could bring
[59:39] Make nature
[59:40] stop then the word already spoken by a
[59:43] prophet in this generation will say one
[59:45] day your bodies will be changed the word
[59:48] spoken by a prophet the Apostle Paul
[59:50] when he spoke we shall not all sleep but
[59:51] we shall all be changed and then brother
[59:53] brandom stands there at the the time of
[59:54] the Rapture he said and it shall come to
[59:57] pass where are we at church the word is
[1:00:01] going to change
[1:00:03] us
[1:00:05] amen hallelujah he said what is it what
[1:00:08] can bring these things but the word they
[1:00:09] can do nature any way they want to here
[1:00:11] it is they're the one who brings on this
[1:00:13] six seal sir they uncover and open it up
[1:00:16] it's the power of God to interrupt
[1:00:18] nature see the sick seal is completely
[1:00:20] an interruption of nature there's your
[1:00:22] seal who does it it's the prophets on
[1:00:24] the other side of the Rapture and now
[1:00:26] here is these two prophets standing here
[1:00:28] with the word of God to do anything to
[1:00:30] Nature they want to and they shake the
[1:00:32] Earth he said they open that Sixth Seal
[1:00:34] they have power to do it there's your
[1:00:35] Sixth Seal coming open if you listen to
[1:00:38] brother brand preaching this it means a
[1:00:39] lot to
[1:00:40] him why because it tells us what God's
[1:00:43] doing here was these are men but God's
[1:00:46] going to use them to shake the Earth but
[1:00:48] he already used a man in this generation
[1:00:51] to shake
[1:00:52] heaven and we are going to go in a
[1:00:54] Rapture because God spoke it he used a
[1:00:57] man yes the man made mistakes yes the
[1:00:59] man was a man was human being right and
[1:01:02] many times God's prophets make mistakes
[1:01:04] and are misled but when they grab God's
[1:01:07] thought right and they speak it it
[1:01:09] becomes the word of God and he said the
[1:01:11] move is on for the bride I say that's
[1:01:13] the word of God he said there's a
[1:01:15] Rapture coming he said I'm going to
[1:01:17] speak it he said it's coming and th
[1:01:19] sayith the Lord I say I believe
[1:01:23] that word is going to change our bodies
[1:01:26] going to change
[1:01:31] nature I could go run around your room
[1:01:34] come on you know what that means to me
[1:01:36] the word is going to change nature I
[1:01:38] don't mean means I'm not subject to your
[1:01:40] opinion I already have a word I don't
[1:01:41] need another Prophet I don't need
[1:01:43] another I don't need somebody else to
[1:01:44] come along and tell me what's going to
[1:01:46] happen I've got a word that's going to
[1:01:48] change my body I I got a word nobody can
[1:01:51] put me out you didn't put me in you
[1:01:53] can't put me out I got a word word is
[1:01:55] going to change my body ought to make us
[1:01:56] happy shouldn't it it ought to make us
[1:01:58] joyful it ought to make us love God with
[1:02:00] all of our heart I'm a part of something
[1:02:03] that's going to change me yes sir going
[1:02:05] to deliver me from these times Amy man I
[1:02:08] don't think we should get too caught up
[1:02:10] I know everybody's worried about
[1:02:11] everything going on and now we all get a
[1:02:13] alarm on our phone today and and uh
[1:02:17] everybody's worried about that but I I
[1:02:19] said you know it is an hour if you knew
[1:02:21] what they could really do with your
[1:02:23] phone
[1:02:25] fact they can push an alarm to your
[1:02:27] phone is nothing compared to what they
[1:02:28] can actually do with your phone you ever
[1:02:31] talk about something and and it shows up
[1:02:33] on
[1:02:33] Facebook you get the ad for it you
[1:02:37] realize they can listen to you at any
[1:02:39] moment that's not a conspiracy theory
[1:02:42] that's just a fact brother that's creepy
[1:02:44] isn't
[1:02:45] it you think about it your TV listens to
[1:02:48] you if you have one they turn it off man
[1:02:52] even if it's turned off they can turn it
[1:02:53] on if is plugged
[1:02:56] in that's actually go look it up they
[1:02:59] can do that but I wouldn't get too
[1:03:01] worried about it I wouldn't get too
[1:03:03] caught up in it all right because that's
[1:03:05] not our promise our promise is not
[1:03:08] tribulation our promise is not what is
[1:03:10] the government going to do to me that's
[1:03:11] not my promise my promise is going home
[1:03:15] I'm going home I'm going to leave this
[1:03:16] world I'm going to buypass all of
[1:03:19] it amen amen he said here's the secret
[1:03:23] of it the prophets the Bible said so
[1:03:25] here they can open anytime they they can
[1:03:26] do anything in nature they want to they
[1:03:28] do the same thing they did do cuz they
[1:03:30] know how it's done he said here God is
[1:03:32] about to deliver his son Israel again
[1:03:34] I'm skipping through this sick seal
[1:03:36] you'd have to go back and listen to the
[1:03:37] whole thing because it's it's almost
[1:03:39] three hours long he said after the same
[1:03:41] manner of the tribulation he did down
[1:03:43] there he sent Moses down there and
[1:03:45] delivered Israel is that right he done
[1:03:46] these very same things he sent Elijah to
[1:03:49] Ahab and 7,000 came out is that right he
[1:03:52] said sends them right back over here
[1:03:53] again in the time of the the tribulation
[1:03:55] and calls out the
[1:03:57] 144,000 now look what happened again
[1:03:59] we're going to go back in scripture and
[1:04:01] look what happened when when he called
[1:04:03] his only begotten son he's about to
[1:04:04] deliver him what happened Matthew
[1:04:07] 27:45 now from the sixth hour there was
[1:04:10] what Darkness over the land to the ninth
[1:04:13] hour the same thing happens every time
[1:04:16] he delivers his son Israel is his son
[1:04:19] yes look at Isaiah chapter 13 and verse
[1:04:23] 6
[1:04:25] brother the Brenham ties this in as well
[1:04:28] and he reads this during The Sixth Seal
[1:04:30] Isaiah 13:6 how ye for the day of the
[1:04:32] Lord is at hand it shall come as a
[1:04:34] destruction from the almighty therefore
[1:04:37] shall all hands be faint and every man's
[1:04:40] heart shall melt what did Jesus say
[1:04:42] men's heart will be failing for
[1:04:44] fear verse eight they should be
[1:04:46] afraid is that come on we're we're
[1:04:49] nearing that time right now but they're
[1:04:51] going to be a whole lot more afraid than
[1:04:52] they are now pains and Sorrows shall
[1:04:55] take hold of them they shall be in pain
[1:04:57] as a woman that travaileth they shall be
[1:04:59] amazed one another their faces shall be
[1:05:01] as
[1:05:02] flames behold the day of the Lord cometh
[1:05:05] cruel both with wrath and fierce anger
[1:05:07] to lay the land desolate he shall
[1:05:09] destroy the Sinners thereof out of it
[1:05:12] the stars of the heaven now listen and
[1:05:14] the constellation thereof shall not give
[1:05:16] their light the sun shall be darkened
[1:05:20] there it is again the six seal the sun
[1:05:23] shall be darkened in his going forth and
[1:05:24] the moon shall not cause her light to
[1:05:26] shine and I will punish the world for
[1:05:28] their evil and the wicked for their
[1:05:30] iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy
[1:05:32] of The Proud deceased I will lay low the
[1:05:35] hotess of the terrible brother the brand
[1:05:37] said see there just exactly Isaiah saw
[1:05:39] the same thing that Jesus spoke of that
[1:05:42] the seventh seal reveals he said when he
[1:05:44] is cleansing the land with tribulation
[1:05:46] that's the tribulation period this Sixth
[1:05:48] Seal brother brandham goes into if
[1:05:51] you've listened to the six seal you know
[1:05:52] he goes into a talk about the American
[1:05:55] Indian how many have heard it he talks
[1:05:57] about
[1:05:58] gono right he talks about jono he talks
[1:06:00] about the American Indian he talks about
[1:06:02] how uh that when the American Indian on
[1:06:05] the land that there was it was peaceful
[1:06:06] there wasn't anything going on just a he
[1:06:08] he had a Cherokee out here hunting
[1:06:10] Buffalo and and there was no sin in the
[1:06:12] land but all of a sudden all of a sudden
[1:06:15] the man came in the white man our
[1:06:16] ancestors came in many of our ancestors
[1:06:18] anyway they come in and they start
[1:06:20] polluting things they start building
[1:06:23] civilization
[1:06:25] right now why is brother BR doing this
[1:06:27] not because he's an environmentalist
[1:06:29] he's telling us something God's going to
[1:06:31] redeem the Earth you realize the Earth
[1:06:33] is an attribute of God it's an it's a
[1:06:36] spoken word of God it's a thought of
[1:06:38] God's not going to do away with it
[1:06:39] completely renovates it he's he's going
[1:06:42] to amen it it's got to be
[1:06:45] redeemed and so he's done that with
[1:06:47] water blood and spirit the same way he
[1:06:48] does the believer brother BR says that
[1:06:50] in future home brother BR talks about
[1:06:52] the American Indian in gono how he was a
[1:06:54] red-blooded American he called him and
[1:06:57] he talked about how the Earth was in
[1:06:59] birth pains and you'll find whenever and
[1:07:01] talking about the second coming of
[1:07:03] Christ whenever Jesus talks about that
[1:07:05] he uses the illustration or the illusion
[1:07:08] of he talks about woman bringing forth
[1:07:11] talks about travail whenever he talks
[1:07:13] about the end times he talks about
[1:07:15] travail talks about a woman uh in
[1:07:17] travail and brother Brown talks about
[1:07:19] the Earth being in travail and then he
[1:07:22] said we're in travail
[1:07:24] Christ to bring forth the
[1:07:27] bride he said that's why we're in
[1:07:29] travail yes oh you ever wonder why you
[1:07:31] have trouble sometimes you you struggle
[1:07:33] seems like everything's a struggle what
[1:07:35] are you doing it's just like Jacob he's
[1:07:37] struggling until he gets a hold of
[1:07:38] something real and you're struggling
[1:07:40] because there's something more real than
[1:07:42] this there's a world more real than this
[1:07:44] oh I wish I could show it to you today I
[1:07:46] wish you could see by the eyes of Faith
[1:07:48] there's a world more real than this one
[1:07:50] it's bigger than our little problems
[1:07:52] it's bigger than our situation it's
[1:07:54] bigger than our bills it's bigger than
[1:07:56] what we're going through through the
[1:07:57] week There's a world Beyond this
[1:07:59] one that we're going to just in another
[1:08:02] dimension brand said it's not three feet
[1:08:04] from where you are
[1:08:06] now oh my one day that world and this
[1:08:09] world will come together sir amen he

[1:08:29] those birth pains that's there
[1:08:32] everything is travailing and groaning he
[1:08:33] said see there's something fixing to
[1:08:35] happen he said brother the earthquake
[1:08:37] bursts open and the Stars shap volcanics
[1:08:39] will come forth the Earth will renew
[1:08:41] itself new lava will break from the
[1:08:44] center of the earth she'll crumble all
[1:08:46] around and around and around he said
[1:08:48] when she spins out yonder he said I tell
[1:08:51] you one morning when Jesus and his bride
[1:08:53] come back to the Earth there will be a
[1:08:55] paradise of God there he said oh my them

[1:09:02] loved
[1:09:03] ones amen this is the reason for the
[1:09:05] sick seal so the Earth can be renovated

[1:09:42] like you should have had back there
[1:09:44] before Eve started the ball rolling in
[1:09:45] sin he said the sick seal is going to do
[1:09:49] something yes sir truly the whole world
[1:09:51] is groaning and painting for the
[1:09:54] Millennium age yes he talked about the
[1:09:56] world falling apart he talked about
[1:09:58] materials being pulled out of the
[1:10:01] Earth right they pulled all the metal
[1:10:03] out and all the coal out and all the oil
[1:10:06] out and you know what I like living the
[1:10:08] way we do I like our standard of living
[1:10:10] but there's a
[1:10:11] cost there's a
[1:10:13] price and the Earth isn't isn't
[1:10:17] happy now how many of you have heard of
[1:10:20] something called
[1:10:21] fracking that's that's the thing where
[1:10:24] they take the they take the water if I
[1:10:26] understand it correctly and they shove
[1:10:27] it in under the Earth and then it they
[1:10:31] get more oil that way they can get the
[1:10:32] oil they couldn't get to otherwise
[1:10:34] they're forcing it with water Force
[1:10:36] breaks in the Earth with water and
[1:10:39] suddenly uh here a few years ago I was
[1:10:41] sitting in pigot Arkansas laying
[1:10:47] back preach my battery out I was laying
[1:10:51] back in pigot Arkansas and I'm laying
[1:10:53] back in my chair and and you know how
[1:10:56] you kind of in the chair you're kind of
[1:10:57] suspended Between Heaven and Earth you
[1:10:59] know it's early morning time and I I
[1:11:01] just really enjoy that my wife wasn't up
[1:11:03] yet and my kids weren't up yet so there
[1:11:05] was nothing to do you know and so I'm
[1:11:07] just laying there like that and my chair
[1:11:09] starts going like
[1:11:10] this
[1:11:12] who and uh I it's like I was on the
[1:11:15] ocean I'm swiming I thought something
[1:11:16] was wrong with me and I went and checked
[1:11:18] Facebook because that's what you do when
[1:11:19] you want to know something's wrong you
[1:11:22] know you check
[1:11:24] Facebook some people be checking
[1:11:26] Facebook for the Rapture you know see
[1:11:28] who's on there who has a little green
[1:11:30] light next to him say Well I
[1:11:34] know it was marked
[1:11:37] safe so I was sitting there and I
[1:11:39] started going like this you know I
[1:11:41] checked Facebook and it said there had
[1:11:42] been a there had been a uh six something
[1:11:44] earthquake in
[1:11:46] Oklahoma and had come all the way across
[1:11:48] there Oklahoma never had earthquakes
[1:11:50] before and brother brandom talks about
[1:11:52] that in the Sixth Seal he said said
[1:11:53] they're taking the materials out of the
[1:11:54] earth he said there's places never had
[1:11:56] earthquakes before have
[1:11:58] earthquakes and now they didn't even
[1:12:00] know that until just a few years ago and
[1:12:03] they realize that when they do that
[1:12:05] process in the earth I'm not making a
[1:12:07] political statement I'm just saying when
[1:12:09] they do that it causes
[1:12:11] earthquakes right well the brand said he
[1:12:14] talking about the world he said his
[1:12:15] politics are so polluted there's hardly
[1:12:17] an honest among them see it system its
[1:12:19] morals is so low it just don't have
[1:12:22] any he said this religion is cankered
[1:12:26] it's time for the sick seal pretty soon
[1:12:29] to be opening up and when she does he
[1:12:30] said oh my it ends remember the bride
[1:12:34] has been married Israel's Remnant is
[1:12:36] sealed right and then nature lets go at
[1:12:40] the word of the two prophets Revelation
[1:12:43] 6:15 I want you to look at this now as
[1:12:45] we've made good time tonight and again
[1:12:47] I'm just trying to trying to cover this
[1:12:49] the the very basics of it so you can see
[1:12:51] it and make you maybe want to go back
[1:12:53] and study it Revelation 615 and the
[1:12:56] kings of the Earth the Great Men the
[1:12:58] rich men the chief captains Mighty Men
[1:13:01] every Bond man every free man hid
[1:13:03] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[1:13:05] the mountains and said to the mountains
[1:13:07] and rocks fall on us and hide us from
[1:13:11] the face of him that sth on the throne
[1:13:13] from the Wrath of the lamb from the face
[1:13:15] of him what does that mean I never
[1:13:16] realized that brother the Joel it means
[1:13:18] he was he came back in his body form
[1:13:23] they saw
[1:13:25] him right he was the word and now he
[1:13:27] become incarnate Christ com back on the
[1:13:29] Mount of Olives in a body right and
[1:13:33] they'll see him yeah and they said hide
[1:13:35] us from the
[1:13:36] face of him that sth on the throne from
[1:13:40] the Wrath of the Lamb he said those who
[1:13:43] had laughed at the preaching of the word
[1:13:46] think about it
[1:13:47] Church of the Vindicated word of the
[1:13:49] Living God when them prophets had stood
[1:13:52] there and performed miracles remember
[1:13:53] this is only three and a half years
[1:13:54] after the bride is gone there'll be
[1:13:56] people living who attended message
[1:13:58] churches who started
[1:14:04] websites I say God have mercy today
[1:14:06] while there's Mercy while there's Mercy
[1:14:09] let's ask for it let's take advantage of
[1:14:12] it said see they cried for the rocks and
[1:14:15] the mountains to hide them see to hide
[1:14:17] them from the word that they had laughed
[1:14:19] at the word's going to be right there in
[1:14:21] front of them it's one thing to laugh at
[1:14:23] in this form but when he comes in body
[1:14:27] form they'll have a difficult time
[1:14:30] laughing yeah look what they
[1:14:33] do Oh my he said the word of the
[1:14:36] Vindicated word of the Living God with
[1:14:37] them prophets that stood there and
[1:14:38] perform Miracles close the sun
[1:14:40] everything else he said and all down
[1:14:41] through the age he said see they cried
[1:14:44] for the rocks and the mountains to hide
[1:14:45] them see to hide them from the word that
[1:14:48] they had laughed at cuz they seen him
[1:14:49] come hide us from the Wrath of the Lamb
[1:14:52] he is the word see they had laughed at
[1:14:55] the word and here the word was incarnate
[1:14:57] they had made fun of it laughed at them
[1:14:59] made fun of them why didn't they repent
[1:15:01] they couldn't remember the word came
[1:15:03] back with his Vindication us we are his
[1:15:06] Vindication and he come back with his
[1:15:08] Vindication a resurrected Church a
[1:15:11] resurrected bride he comes back riding
[1:15:13] on a white horse with his Vindication he
[1:15:15] said and then they laugh or they quit
[1:15:17] laughing they begin to cry out but they
[1:15:19] did not repent yes they couldn't repent
[1:15:22] that's right
[1:15:24] Mercy's
[1:15:25] over oh my so how do you know Mercy's
[1:15:28] still still going because you can
[1:15:31] repent as long as you can repent Now's
[1:15:34] the Time to do
[1:15:37] thaten Oh
[1:15:39] my he said they couldn't uh Church don't
[1:15:43] don't ever turn him down if there's just
[1:15:46] a a pole of conviction in your heart
[1:15:48] we're living in an age when there's no
[1:15:49] conviction anywhere right but you you
[1:15:51] can preach you can preach about the
[1:15:54] things of God people just people just
[1:15:56] don't
[1:15:56] move and that's not us I'm not rebuking
[1:15:59] you in any way that's the world that's
[1:16:02] everybody it's just there's no
[1:16:04] conviction I say if you feel a pull of
[1:16:06] God in your heart you better run and
[1:16:08] that's what brother BR says at the end
[1:16:09] of The Sixth Seal he said if you feel
[1:16:10] the tug of God in your heart you better
[1:16:12] run to the altar he said you shouldn't
[1:16:14] have to pull on people to come he said
[1:16:16] they should run they see the time that
[1:16:18] they're living
[1:16:20] in why didn't they repent they couldn't
[1:16:24] was too far then so they knew that the
[1:16:26] punishment they hear it theyve set in
[1:16:27] meetings like this and knew about it and
[1:16:30] they knew that the things that those
[1:16:32] prophets had predicted was looking them
[1:16:33] right in the face the thing that they
[1:16:35] had rejected they' spurned Mercy for the
[1:16:38] last time they tried to repent but the
[1:16:40] lamb had come to claim his own see and
[1:16:43] they cried to the rocks and the
[1:16:44] mountains prayed but the prayer was too
[1:16:49] late Israel blinded 2,000 years to give
[1:16:53] us a space to repent I say we ought to
[1:16:55] use
[1:16:56] it we ought to use
[1:16:59] it church
[1:17:01] we we should be down on our knees
[1:17:03] thanking God to be the bride
[1:17:07] right well who else who's going to
[1:17:09] escape from the from the transgender
[1:17:11] Revolution yeah who's going to escape
[1:17:14] from from the liberal theologies of
[1:17:16] today who's going to escape from the
[1:17:18] from the uh from the Roman Catholic
[1:17:20] Church who's going to escape from the
[1:17:22] world

[1:17:39] but the brid will stand because we're
[1:17:42] going home he gave us a space to
[1:17:46] repent brother Brandon said so if God
[1:17:48] did that for you you believe he did it
[1:17:50] for you tonight could you raise your
[1:17:52] hands he did that for me he did that for
[1:17:56] me he blinded his own children for 2,000
[1:18:00] years for
[1:18:02] me he said the least thing we could do
[1:18:04] would be accept what he's done that's
[1:18:07] all he asked us to
[1:18:11] do that's all he didn't ask you to jump
[1:18:14] through a bunch of Hoops he didn't ask
[1:18:16] you to go through a 12ep program become
[1:18:17] a better person he said just accept What
[1:18:19] I've Done
[1:18:21] yes
[1:18:23] we bow our heads together musicians
[1:18:30] come if you've never given your heart to
[1:18:33] him why say brother man why do you do
[1:18:34] that we're all
[1:18:36] Christians I'm prone to making altar
[1:18:39] calls I realize that I'm prone to giving
[1:18:41] people a chance at the end of every
[1:18:43] sermon there's a reason for that because
[1:18:45] I preach to people who never made
[1:18:47] another
[1:18:48] service I know every preacher has but
[1:18:51] I've had a couple of instances in my my
[1:18:53] life that I preach to people and had
[1:18:54] people in my home and counsel with them
[1:18:56] and talk to
[1:18:57] them those people ended up either
[1:19:01] changing the lives of other people in
[1:19:04] such a way that they ended up in prison
[1:19:05] for the rest of their
[1:19:07] life I can think of two distinct cases
[1:19:10] like that one case where someone that I
[1:19:13] had prayed for talked to and preached
[1:19:15] the last sermon that they ever
[1:19:17] heard died by the hand of their own
[1:19:21] husband I don't say that that'll be you
[1:19:23] there's no fear in that I'm not trying
[1:19:25] to make you afraid I'm just giving you
[1:19:27] an opportunity a chance if you've never
[1:19:29] given your heart to him why don't you
[1:19:31] why don't you do
[1:19:33] that it's not that hard if you haven't
[1:19:37] rep if you're a Christian but there's
[1:19:38] something in your heart that maybe
[1:19:40] something that you you know it's wrong
[1:19:42] but you just do it anyway and you tell
[1:19:44] well Lord will let me buy with it just
[1:19:45] just
[1:19:46] repent he's done so much for you he
[1:19:49] don't even see it but just just repent
[1:19:51] you don't want it that that in your your
[1:19:53] life you don't want nothing between you
[1:19:54] and God something you know it's right to
[1:19:56] do just just do the right
[1:19:59] thing he did so much for us the least we
[1:20:03] could do is just accept what he's done
[1:20:04] for
[1:20:06] us Heavenly
[1:20:09] Father oh Lord Jesus how we need you
[1:20:13] today Lord I I want to fully accept and
[1:20:17] embrace what you've done for us in this
[1:20:20] hour Lord I accept you as My Savior My
[1:20:24] Healer my God my leader my
[1:20:29] Lord I accept you Lord in the message
[1:20:32] that you brought in this hour I realize
[1:20:34] the message was more than a man we don't
[1:20:36] pray to a man we don't set tapes up and
[1:20:39] call that the token that's not our token
[1:20:41] but our token is you
[1:20:43] lord it's the very literal Life of
[1:20:46] Christ coming back on the
[1:20:48] believer but we accept that today Lord
[1:20:51] we accept the message that that you
[1:20:52] brought we accept the word that you've
[1:20:54] taught us we accept your love and your
[1:20:58] kindness and your mercy that's been
[1:21:00] extended Lord even beyond the age that
[1:21:02] the prophet could see it he couldn't
[1:21:04] even see it was so dark past 1977 he
[1:21:08] couldn't even see in an hour of Darkness
[1:21:11] the Bible said an hour of gross Darkness
[1:21:14] but he spoke to the bride he said arise
[1:21:16] shine thy light has come oh God I pray
[1:21:20] you'd help us to embrace that light
[1:21:21] today to walk towards it to be that
