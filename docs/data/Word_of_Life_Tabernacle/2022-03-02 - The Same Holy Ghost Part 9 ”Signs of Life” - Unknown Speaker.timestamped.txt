[3:41] whether andrew glover in our meetings
[3:43] so we're looking forward to that and uh
[3:46] good to have family that serves the lord
[3:48] and but you know we're all of us are
[3:50] promised our family is that right
[3:52] we're promised that and so we believe
[3:55] that each one of them every one of them
[3:56] is going to serve the lord no matter how
[3:58] dark it may look right now
[4:00] and so we believe that it's good to have
[4:02] sister sister pat and his family got
[4:05] some visitors with us today it's good to
[4:06] have them
[4:07] and uh each one of you that came today
[4:10] and uh we want to be praying
[4:13] uh especially for the bailey family
[4:15] brother bailey's here this morning
[4:18] and uh

[4:23] should say that celebration of life you
[4:25] know she's you know has a much better
[4:27] life now than she did here but she was
[4:29] loved and brother bailey is going to
[4:30] miss his daughter being there with him

[4:35] for brother john and all of the family
[4:38] there that they would be
[4:40] comforted in this moment also brother
[4:42] david white is gone this morning they
[4:43] had another wedding shower back at

[4:50] night probably but brother uh david also
[4:53] lost a brother and i drove out there
[4:54] this week as well to be with his family
[4:57] and
[4:58] and just be praying for them as well i
[5:00] believe god is merciful isn't he and so
[5:02] we always like i said believe for our
[5:04] family and believe that they made it
[5:06] and uh and i just saw the mercy of god
[5:09] in that situation especially with
[5:11] brother mark and
[5:12] and
[5:13] god's able to do that he's able to reach
[5:15] right down into the situation you think
[5:17] well how could that person ever be saved
[5:19] and then all of a sudden it just
[5:21] something happens and it just
[5:24] it sets up just right for them to make
[5:26] it
[5:26] amen i believe god does that for us
[5:29] listen if you're going to go to hell
[5:30] you're going to run across every
[5:32] every thing that god set up in your way
[5:35] he's going to warn you he's going to
[5:37] stop you he's going to put something in
[5:39] front of you and he even said you know
[5:41] we believe we're the bride but he even
[5:42] said the spirit and the bride say come
[5:45] and whosoever will
[5:47] whosoever will let him come and drink of
[5:50] the water of life freely amen aren't you
[5:53] glad to serve a god like that
[5:55] amen god bless you this morning i
[5:58] i know russia's been in the news we're
[6:00] going to
[6:01] the lord willing talk about that on
[6:02] wednesday night there's some uh special
[6:05] prophecies concerning russia and just
[6:07] kind of remind you of some of those
[6:09] things and and of course they've gone
[6:11] into ukraine we need to be praying for
[6:13] ukrainian believers and russian
[6:14] believers there's quite a few of them
[6:16] the russian believers have been under
[6:18] persecution for quite a while this
[6:20] message is banned in russia at this time
[6:22] and
[6:23] and because of some things brother
[6:25] branham said about prophecy about russia
[6:27] and
[6:28] and ukraine is being overrun at this
[6:31] moment and they just don't have they
[6:33] fought valiantly but they just don't
[6:34] have there's believers there's churches
[6:36] in those cities with believers in them
[6:39] so let's be especially praying for them
[6:41] would you do that
[6:42] and we don't know what that's like we've
[6:44] never experienced a war here on our
[6:46] country since the civil war it's been
[6:48] 160 or 70 years ago i guess now and so
[6:51] so that's a it's an amazing thing to be
[6:54] able to
[6:55] uh see that and see people hold their
[6:57] faith and still believe god and still
[6:59] believe the message of the hour
[7:01] but they're living it they're living we
[7:03] talk about the end times they're living
[7:04] the end times right now
[7:06] amen so let's be praying for them and i
[7:09] had
[7:10] just to kind of keep us in balance a
[7:12] little bit when we look at those things
[7:13] you look at those things say well is
[7:14] this the end time and it is
[7:16] it is the end time
[7:18] it's been the end time for a long time
[7:19] if we can say it that way but we're
[7:20] getting to the end of the end
[7:23] and brother branham said this about
[7:24] russia he said russia
[7:26] the reason russia come to herself she
[7:29] had to
[7:30] he said just like israel had to get in
[7:32] the homeland god had to drive israel
[7:34] back to the homeland for the trumpets
[7:37] and so did god have to drive russia up
[7:39] there in communism to do exactly what's
[7:42] been prophesied she would do
[7:44] so russia has been sleeping again for a
[7:46] while but you think why would they have
[7:48] to wake up now why are they all of a
[7:50] sudden so aggressive under under putin
[7:53] they're so aggressive because god wakes
[7:55] them up
[7:56] god does that for a purpose he allows
[7:59] them to be that way because they have a
[8:02] part in end time prophecy and so let's
[8:04] be praying that god's will would be done
[8:06] in these things and if you're not right
[8:07] with god now's the time to get right
[8:09] with god
[8:11] you don't have much time none of us know
[8:13] how much time we have well each one of
[8:14] us we could be taken off of here off of
[8:17] this earth tomorrow but especially in
[8:19] this time let's just be right with god
[8:21] let's just let everything out of the way
[8:23] old grudges old old things that would
[8:25] hold us back from being where we should
[8:27] be with god let's just get that all out
[8:29] of the way just serve god and believe
[8:31] god and believe his word because we
[8:33] never know what tomorrow holds amen
[8:36] amen god bless you today we'll deal with
[8:38] that some on on wednesday night let's
[8:40] stand together
[8:44] also next week i'd like to have our
[8:46] election we delayed it at the beginning
[8:48] of the year i'd like to do that i
[8:50] believe next week will be the first
[8:52] weekend in march let's do that next week
[8:55] for deacons just to re-elect our deacons
[8:57] and and trustees and
[8:59] and uh also we'll try to give you a just
[9:02] a basic financial report next week on
[9:05] what we've been doing with the offering
[9:06] money and the missions and things like
[9:08] that
[9:08] luke chapter 1 and verse 39
[9:12] luke 1 39-44
[9:16] and then we'll also read from first
[9:17] thessalonians 4 15
[9:20] it says and mary arose in those days and
[9:23] went into the hill country with haste
[9:24] into a city of judah
[9:26] and entered into the house of zacharias
[9:28] and saluted elizabeth
[9:31] and it came to pass that when elizabeth
[9:33] heard the salutation of mary
[9:35] the babe leaped in her womb
[9:37] and elizabeth was filled
[9:40] with the holy ghost
[9:41] and she spake out with a loud voice
[9:44] and said blessed art thou among women
[9:47] and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and
[9:50] whence is this to me that the mother of
[9:52] my lord should come to me
[9:55] for lo
[9:56] as soon as the voice of thy salutation
[9:58] surrounded and sounded in mine ears the
[10:01] babe leaped in my womb for joy and then
[10:04] in first thessalonians 4 15
[10:07] it says for this we say unto you by the
[10:09] word of the lord that we which are alive
[10:12] and remain how many want to be alive and
[10:14] remain
[10:15] so not just to be here but to be alive
[10:17] to be a living body of christ at the
[10:20] coming of the lord we which are alive
[10:22] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[10:24] shall not hinder or prevent them which
[10:25] are asleep
[10:26] the lord himself should descend from
[10:28] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[10:30] the archangel with the trump of god and
[10:32] the dead in christ shall rise first
[10:35] then we which are what alive and remain
[10:38] shall be caught up together with them in
[10:40] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[10:42] so shall we ever be
[10:44] with the lord i pray the lord would add
[10:46] his blessing to the word this morning he
[10:48] may be seated
[10:53] when a baby is conceived
[10:56] it isn't long until you begin to feel
[10:58] signs of life
[11:00] now i know that when it comes to the
[11:02] supernatural birth
[11:04] the conception there's no emotion no
[11:07] sensation
[11:08] in the conception
[11:10] but there is you do begin to feel signs
[11:12] of life and when the baby's born you
[11:15] know that
[11:16] it's something that you know
[11:18] and and so there are signs of life that
[11:20] begin to show up in the in the life and
[11:22] in the body
[11:23] of a person
[11:24] when the when that baby is alive now
[11:27] elizabeth had been pregnant for almost
[11:29] six months
[11:31] and she was worried
[11:32] because she never felt the baby move
[11:36] and so the baby was as though it was
[11:38] dead in the womb she was afraid because
[11:40] there hadn't been no movement and if
[11:42] there was no movement there would be a
[11:44] fear that would come on the mother
[11:45] because she began to realize that that i
[11:48] don't know if this baby's alive because
[11:50] it's not moving
[11:52] because life always
[11:54] causes movement when you have life
[11:57] you move
[11:59] listen when a church has life
[12:01] it's not sitting still
[12:04] it has movement it may not be much but
[12:07] it's movement are you with me this
[12:09] morning and so elizabeth said i'm just a
[12:12] little worried because she'd had no life
[12:14] yet and but the random said you know the
[12:15] baby as far as she knew was dead he said
[12:18] the little john must have been dead in
[12:19] his mother's womb and she'd felt no life
[12:22] as yet and she was kind of worried
[12:25] because now life is always pushing the
[12:27] boundaries life is finding a way it has
[12:30] detectable movement even if you were
[12:32] sleeping you were moving
[12:35] yeah right a little bit
[12:37] there's a movement you see the chest
[12:39] rise and fall you you there's a little
[12:41] bit of air coming out and if you've ever
[12:43] been a parent and you know your baby's
[12:45] in there sleeping and they seem so still
[12:48] you walk in and many times i walked into
[12:50] my children and i walked in and put my
[12:52] hand on their chest or over their mouth
[12:54] to see that they were breathing because
[12:56] you know if they're alive there's going
[12:58] to be some breath there's going to be
[13:00] some movement there's going to be
[13:01] something there and the same thing is
[13:03] true of the holy ghost if there's a holy
[13:04] ghost in the church there's going to be
[13:06] some signs of life
[13:08] right if the holy ghost is in our
[13:10] families there's going to be some signs
[13:12] of life if the holy ghost is among us
[13:14] there's going to be signs of life and
[13:16] just like russia had to wake up and
[13:18] realize who they were
[13:20] in in prophecy they had to wake up
[13:22] israel had to wake up and realize who
[13:24] they were in prophecy america has to
[13:26] realize become who they are in prophecy
[13:28] but the bride has got to become who they
[13:30] are
[13:31] and there's got to be a people who raise
[13:33] up in the last days and actually step
[13:36] into their position and wake up and
[13:37] brother madame said what happened is the
[13:39] denominational people miss the awakening
[13:41] of the bribe then if the bride is
[13:43] awakened there's got to be some movement
[13:45] there
[13:47] are you with me this morning
[13:49] so there's movement there's a there's a
[13:51] there's a living movement
[13:52] in the bride
[13:54] now
[13:55] when when the water breaks brother
[13:57] branham says you don't have to do very
[13:58] much about it
[13:59] when the blood comes you don't have to
[14:01] do much about it
[14:02] but in order to get life in the baby
[14:05] you've got to give him a spanking
[14:07] make him yell out
[14:09] now he said you take a little some kind
[14:11] of a shock
[14:12] he said maybe he wouldn't have to spank
[14:13] him but just shock him a little
[14:15] the very idea of him being born
[14:17] sometimes will do it grab him shake him
[14:20] i remember when peter was born i'd never
[14:22] experienced that before and peter was
[14:24] born and and i'm watching all that
[14:26] happen and and for some reason they let
[14:28] us men in the room anymore i don't know
[14:30] why
[14:31] we're not doing any good in there
[14:34] but they expect you to be in there you
[14:36] know
[14:36] and and i actually had to sit down i was
[14:38] about to die just just watching it
[14:40] and and and here's the baby being born
[14:43] when peter was born he didn't breathe
[14:44] very much he didn't make much movement
[14:46] and so they were roughing him up i
[14:48] thought they were going to kill him
[14:50] because they were shaking him and
[14:52] beating him you still have to do that to
[14:53] wake him up in the morning but
[14:55] i mean they just he just didn't move
[14:57] very much
[14:58] because he had stuff in his lungs it was
[14:59] a very difficult birth and but but you
[15:02] know
[15:02] they had they were doing that for a
[15:04] reason and god sometimes listen to me
[15:07] church he lets us go through things
[15:09] and we wonder why have i gone through
[15:11] this over and over again what is this
[15:13] movement in the water why why is the
[15:15] water troubled why is the church
[15:17] troubled why is the nation's trouble why
[15:19] are these things going on because
[15:20] sometimes god wants to wants to see
[15:23] wants to shake us until we begin to move
[15:26] he's trying to get us to go somewhere
[15:28] listen we're not here for the duration
[15:30] we're not supposed to live for this
[15:32] world are you with me this morning we're
[15:34] not here to stay here we're not building
[15:36] kingdoms here but we're building
[15:38] something that will help us in the other
[15:40] world we're looking forward to an
[15:42] eternity that's coming and so sometimes
[15:44] he lets us be shaken he let us be shaken
[15:46] by kovid by by all the things that's
[15:49] been taking place why is he why is the
[15:51] world shaking today because he wants to
[15:53] see movement
[15:55] and i believe there's movement in the
[15:57] bride today are you with me
[15:59] i believe there's movement in the bride
[16:01] now brother branham says he don't he
[16:03] says if you don't start breathing spank
[16:05] him a little and then he yells out in
[16:06] unknown tongues like to himself i guess
[16:09] he said but anyhow he's making a noise
[16:11] and i think if a baby is born just by
[16:13] stillbirth with no sound no emotion
[16:15] that's a dead baby
[16:17] he said that's what's the matter with
[16:18] the church today the system we got too
[16:19] many stillborn children he said that's
[16:21] right they need a gospel spanking you
[16:23] see to wake them up to bring them to
[16:25] themselves so that god can breathe the
[16:27] breath of life into them
[16:30] hallelujah
[16:32] listen that shock that hearing the name
[16:34] of jesus and mary's salutation to
[16:36] elizabeth when the name of jesus was
[16:38] spoken for the first time and she began
[16:40] to tell the story to elizabeth when that
[16:43] was spoken that was the shock that
[16:45] brought john to life
[16:47] notice brother brown said just as soon
[16:48] as she said jesus the first time the
[16:50] name of jesus christ was ever spoke
[16:52] through a human lip the little dead baby
[16:54] in its mother's womb received the holy
[16:56] ghost and began to jump for joy in the
[16:58] womb of a mother and he said what ought
[17:00] the name of jesus to do to a born-again
[17:02] church oh my george we just realized who
[17:05] we're talking about i wonder sometimes
[17:07] when we sing and when we preach and and
[17:09] when we do the things that we do i
[17:11] wonder if the if what we're saying ever
[17:13] goes through our brain i wonder if it
[17:14] ever actually we actually realized when
[17:16] i speak the name of jesus i'm speaking
[17:18] of someone who's the alpha and the omega
[17:21] i'm speaking of someone who's
[17:22] all-powerful i'm speaking of someone who
[17:24] has no limits to his power i'm speaking
[17:26] to someone who can heal i'm speaking of
[17:28] someone who can say i'm speaking of
[17:30] someone who can take away every burden
[17:32] and say lay them on me i'm speaking of
[17:35] someone who died for my sins are you
[17:36] with me this morning
[17:38] it's not just something we say but i'm
[17:40] speaking of something real
[17:43] hallelujah what about the name of jesus
[17:45] he said due to a born-again church
[17:48] hallelujah
[17:50] oh it ought to stir us up
[17:52] just to hear about his name what he did
[17:54] for us when we sing songs like we sung
[17:57] this morning about calvary and about the
[17:59] about what he did for us on that day and
[18:01] how he became us so that we might become
[18:03] him it ought to do something for us
[18:05] because we're talking not about
[18:07] something that we heard about 2000 years
[18:09] ago but we're talking about a reality in
[18:11] our lives we've we know our life has
[18:14] changed we know things were different
[18:15] than they were before i'm not who i was
[18:17] i'm something different
[18:19] amen and it brings a glory into the
[18:22] church a life into the church when the
[18:24] name of jesus is spoken
[18:26] and exalted
[18:29] now
[18:30] the body of a baby
[18:33] is made up of different parts
[18:36] so is the body
[18:37] of the church
[18:39] different parts now i want to type that
[18:41] this morning in kind of maybe an odd way
[18:44] because i'm a little bit of an odd
[18:45] person
[18:46] but i want to type it maybe in a little
[18:48] bit of an odd way to the physical church
[18:50] building
[18:52] because if there's life in the church
[18:55] then you would expect things
[18:58] to move
[18:59] now and in the body of the church you
[19:01] know we know we are the body of christ
[19:03] how many know that
[19:04] we are the body of christ the rest of
[19:06] you i you know you just have to catch up
[19:08] with us but
[19:09] the body is christ and we are the body
[19:12] of christ
[19:13] now
[19:14] do you expect to see
[19:16] different movements in different parts
[19:18] of the body
[19:20] right you expect to see that now when
[19:22] i'm up here under control and as much as
[19:25] i can be but there's certain things that
[19:27] are mannerisms that's when i'm right
[19:29] there i grab my ring is actually what
[19:30] i'm doing make sure it's still there
[19:32] i have a when i got married i never
[19:34] wanted to wear a ring i couldn't take
[19:35] off
[19:36] and and there's a reason i'm
[19:38] claustrophobic it's not because i didn't
[19:40] i've worn this ring every day and every
[19:41] night since we got married almost 16
[19:43] years ago but i always
[19:45] touch it it's just something i do
[19:47] involuntarily but the things i do under
[19:50] the control of my brain you expect my
[19:52] body to move in certain ways
[19:55] right if my brain tells me to walk over
[19:57] here i'm going my my feet will move in
[19:59] that direction
[20:00] right it's a sign of controlled life
[20:03] does that make sense it's life
[20:04] controlled you expect me to move if i
[20:06] just stood here
[20:08] and
[20:09] and completely still
[20:11] you'd think there was something wrong
[20:12] with me
[20:14] now that's true you think about it how
[20:15] much does a person move while they're
[20:17] preaching
[20:19] a lot
[20:20] because you you expect a person to you
[20:22] know somebody walked up to you and they
[20:24] began to talk to you and their face
[20:25] never moved and their mouth never moved
[20:28] and their body never moved you think
[20:30] there's something wrong with them
[20:32] right even though they were talking to
[20:34] you but there's some something's got to
[20:35] move
[20:37] right or you think that they're dead now
[20:39] so there's but there's different
[20:40] movements i don't expect my hands to
[20:42] move like my eyes do or my feet to move
[20:44] like my hands do there's different
[20:46] movements in different parts of the body
[20:49] now you could be dead and still move
[20:56] we won't hear any stories today but you
[20:58] could be dead
[21:00] and still move right now but watch now
[21:04] your movements wouldn't be directed by
[21:06] the head
[21:08] now i can prove that we used to cut
[21:10] chicken's heads off
[21:13] right if you've been out on the farm you
[21:14] know what that's like brother dan you
[21:15] told me some of them stories we used to
[21:17] do that and you take a chicken and cut
[21:19] its head off and the blood will spurt up
[21:21] where the head was
[21:23] i'm glad we're not eating very soon
[21:25] the blood will come up where the head
[21:26] where the head was and that chicken will
[21:28] run around the yard just like crazy
[21:31] but it's it it don't make any sense and
[21:34] so when you see somebody just going here
[21:36] and there and with no sense to their
[21:37] movements you say well they're running
[21:38] around like a chicken with its head cut
[21:39] off
[21:40] because the movement of the body is not
[21:42] connected to the head
[21:45] right and there are some movements that
[21:46] we do involuntarily but that's the
[21:48] movement of the body now in the body of
[21:51] christ the movement should be connected
[21:53] to the head
[21:55] that's why the spirit of the prophet can
[21:56] be subject to the prophets that's why we
[21:58] can still have church order and yet
[22:00] worship god
[22:01] right because the movement of the body
[22:03] is connected to the head we are not off
[22:06] on our own doing our own thing off on
[22:09] the side somewhere just just playing our
[22:10] own game but the movement about listen
[22:12] listen that's why it's so dangerous when
[22:14] somebody gets away from the church in
[22:15] the sense that they they begin to drift
[22:17] away and they begin to say well i'll
[22:18] just do my own thing and it's not
[22:20] because we want to control people that's
[22:21] not it at all but you got to work within
[22:23] a body
[22:25] if you're not working with the body if
[22:26] i'm walking around here my foot's just
[22:28] shaking on its own that's a problem
[22:31] right my foot's supposed to be carrying
[22:32] me somewhere
[22:34] are you with me this morning
[22:35] so the movement of the body ought to be
[22:37] connected to the head
[22:40] right
[22:42] now
[22:43] and brother madam said this about that
[22:45] about the body movement he said we got
[22:47] the same thing he said we stay with the
[22:49] word we live
[22:51] how many believe that today
[22:53] and shall live by every word but if we
[22:55] don't we die we spiritually die he said
[22:58] oh we can still make noise sure kick
[23:00] around
[23:02] and holler and carry on but that ain't
[23:04] living
[23:06] sure so something could seem to be alive
[23:08] now listen the pentecostal church runs
[23:10] the aisles
[23:11] i've been in some of their services
[23:12] where there's there's much more emotion
[23:14] than there is maybe in our services and
[23:17] and i'll be okay with a little more in
[23:18] ours to be honest with you
[23:20] i'd be okay with that but you know what
[23:22] it's not connected to the word the head
[23:26] right and you take the same maybe
[23:28] movements but you connect it to the head
[23:30] it's going to produce something
[23:32] right two people come to the altar one
[23:35] comes under the influence of a story
[23:36] about his his mother or something like
[23:38] that comes under that influence another
[23:40] person comes because he's genuinely
[23:42] convicted of his sin when that movement
[23:45] is because of genuine conviction what
[23:46] does it do they come to the altar
[23:48] and when they get down there something
[23:50] happens because the movement is directed
[23:52] by the head not this intellectual head
[23:55] but the head is christ
[23:57] are you with me now the head is not the
[23:59] pastor the head is not the deacons the
[24:01] head is christ
[24:04] the holy spirit
[24:06] so something that makes no movement
[24:07] though is dead period
[24:11] right if it's just not making any
[24:12] movement it's dead
[24:14] so well we're in a live church okay but
[24:16] you're going to make some movement
[24:19] if you are alive in fact alive
[24:22] you're going to be moving
[24:24] now
[24:25] and you look at the old testament for an
[24:27] example of that the priest when he went
[24:29] into the holy of holies he had a bell
[24:30] and a pomegranate on his
[24:32] on his robe when he walked in that that
[24:34] bell and pomegranate would move and the
[24:37] movement would cause the bell to ring
[24:40] and and when it when it did that they
[24:42] would know he was still alive
[24:45] right and if that stopped
[24:47] everybody held their breath because the
[24:48] priest was not moving
[24:50] as long as he was alive those were
[24:52] sensitive enough to the movement
[24:54] of his body that as long as he was alive
[24:57] that would still be there that sound
[24:59] would still be there listen to me church
[25:00] brother branham typed that over and over
[25:02] again to the church and he said if
[25:04] there's no movement if there's no noise
[25:07] the church is dead right yeah
[25:09] right now he doesn't do that just once
[25:11] he does that many times he said it this
[25:13] way he said i can prove anything that
[25:14] hasn't got emotion in it is dead so if
[25:16] your religion ain't got a little emotion
[25:18] in it you better bury it and get
[25:20] something you'd have to have a motion to
[25:22] be alive
[25:24] and i've told you before you've got
[25:25] emotion you may just not realize him
[25:27] you got emotion or you couldn't have
[25:29] bitterness against people
[25:31] you got emotionally you couldn't hate on
[25:33] people you got emotion or you couldn't
[25:35] or you couldn't sit there and talk about
[25:37] somebody you got emotions
[25:39] but i want our emotions to be used in a
[25:41] positive way if i'm going to express my
[25:43] myself and my emotions let it be a
[25:45] praise to god a worship to god a
[25:47] hallelujah a song in the house of the
[25:50] lord let it be something that'll exalt
[25:52] christ instead of something that tears
[25:54] down my brother are you with me now
[25:58] now the first place if you were like i
[26:00] said if you're typing into a physical
[26:02] church the first place you would look
[26:03] for signs of life if you were walking
[26:05] into a church is signs of life in the
[26:08] pulpit
[26:10] right that's the first place you look
[26:13] you begin to look for signs of life in
[26:15] the pulpit what do we expect from
[26:16] preachers
[26:18] are they to be intellectual teachers
[26:21] and you preachers just bear with me for
[26:22] just a moment i'm not trying to to
[26:24] preach at you but at myself this morning
[26:26] well i begin to think about this what do
[26:28] we expect from our preachers in hebrews
[26:30] 1 7 it says that he makes his ministers
[26:32] a flame of fire
[26:35] a flame of fire he's talking about
[26:37] angels but the minister is an angel to
[26:39] the church
[26:41] right now he makes his ministers a flame
[26:44] of fire
[26:45] in first peter 4 10 and 11 it says as
[26:47] every man has received the gift even so
[26:49] minister the same one to another so
[26:51] they're not all going to be the same
[26:52] but he said as good stewards of the
[26:54] manifold grace of god if any man speak
[26:56] let him speak as the oracles of god in
[26:58] other words let him be confident in what
[27:00] he says
[27:02] right we don't speak us one way that
[27:04] they knew the difference between jesus
[27:05] and the scribes in the new testament is
[27:07] when jesus walked out there when jesus
[27:10] walked out there they said he speaks
[27:11] with authority
[27:13] he speaks with authority like somebody
[27:15] that knows what he's talking about
[27:17] why did he say that because
[27:19] because that he was different from the
[27:20] scribes he said well it could be this
[27:22] way it could be that way but we've have
[27:24] a voice of authority in our day
[27:26] right we've heard the voice of authority
[27:28] and we have to be a voice of authority
[27:30] if any man speak let him speak as the
[27:32] oracles of god if any man minister let
[27:34] him do it as of the ability which god
[27:36] giveth that god in all things may be
[27:38] glorified through jesus christ to whom
[27:40] he prays and dominion for every and ever
[27:42] and ever now brother rudolph said every
[27:44] denomination has these seminaries hatch
[27:46] out a bunch of incubator preachers
[27:49] he said i always felt sorry for an
[27:51] incubator chicken it had no mammy
[27:54] so it never felt the warmth of a
[27:56] mother's love
[27:57] because it was born in an incubator
[28:00] oh
[28:01] he typed that to preachers
[28:03] they didn't know the the comfort of the
[28:05] holy spirit
[28:07] they didn't know what it was like to be
[28:09] in a move with the holy spirit they
[28:10] didn't know what it was like to be in
[28:11] revival it was an incubator preacher
[28:14] hatched out without a move of god
[28:18] are you hearing me now
[28:19] and that kind of a preacher is never
[28:21] going to move god's people why because
[28:23] it's just an intellectual understanding
[28:26] no matter how much it chirped it wasn't
[28:28] mothered
[28:29] he said that's the way these machines
[28:31] turn out clergymen sometimes don't know
[28:33] more about god than a hot and taut does
[28:34] about egyptian nights
[28:36] or rabbit knows how to put on snowshoes
[28:39] he said what we need is an experienced
[28:41] preacher now he's not talking about the
[28:42] length of time that they've been
[28:43] preaching but he's talking about a
[28:45] preacher with an experience
[28:47] go listen to he said what we need is an
[28:49] experienced preacher that's been on the
[28:51] backside of the desert until he stayed
[28:53] in that place under god until the pillar
[28:55] of fire come down before him like he did
[28:57] with moses and nobody can take that from
[29:00] him
[29:02] an experienced preacher yeah i don't
[29:04] care if someone's 16 years old but give
[29:06] me somebody by the officer that can
[29:08] stand there under the influence of the
[29:09] holy ghost and has known what god is
[29:11] like has met god for himself and his
[29:13] life has changed that's the kind of
[29:15] preachers we want
[29:17] not somebody to just give you an
[29:18] intellectual talk
[29:19] again brother brandon says what we need
[29:21] is an old-fashioned god-sent scalding
[29:23] religion that will scald that
[29:25] worldliness out of the church
[29:27] we need to come back to the holy ghost
[29:29] and fire
[29:30] back to the thing that burns out the
[29:31] dross brings the old-fashioned preaching
[29:33] back
[29:34] why are people today are trying to do
[29:36] away with preaching in the pulpit but a
[29:38] prophet said we want to bring it back
[29:41] bring the old-fashioned preaching back
[29:42] make heaven high and hell hot gun barrel
[29:44] straight we need that kind of preaching
[29:46] he said but you do it today your
[29:48] congregation will vote you out i'm so
[29:49] glad i don't have a congregation like
[29:51] that
[29:52] he said your congregation will vote you
[29:54] out he said sometimes good preachers are
[29:55] led astray by their congregation he said
[29:58] that's the reason i have no denomination
[29:59] i have one headquarters that's from
[30:01] heaven wherever he sins there i go
[30:03] whatever he says i say we don't want no
[30:05] do not listen i don't tell these other
[30:07] preachers what to preach they have to
[30:09] hear from god themselves we don't have a
[30:11] denomination he said i have one
[30:12] headquarters that's from heaven wherever
[30:15] he sins there i go whatever he says i
[30:17] say we don't want no denomination this
[30:18] church ever talks about denomination
[30:20] you've lost your pastor right then i
[30:22] wouldn't hang around it not one five
[30:23] minutes
[30:24] listen if there's somebody some in some
[30:26] other town some other place that can
[30:28] tell us what time to have church
[30:30] that's a denomination
[30:32] if there's somebody in some other town
[30:33] some of the place that can tell me what
[30:35] to preach on sunday or what tapes to
[30:37] listen to or what to feed the people
[30:39] that's the denomination
[30:41] i don't care who it is i don't have to
[30:43] preach it because the church down the
[30:44] road preaches it much respect as i have
[30:46] for brother wendell or or brother tim
[30:48] pruitt or donnie reagan or whoever it is
[30:50] i've got tremendous respect for them
[30:52] brother bill ivy i got respect for many
[30:54] men but i don't have to preach something
[30:55] because they preach it i preached
[30:57] something because the word it's true
[30:58] it's in the word and god it's inspired
[31:00] to me
[31:02] i'll study other men's sermons to preach
[31:04] the word
[31:05] study the word of god
[31:07] are you with me now
[31:08] we have one headquarters
[31:10] we should never if we talk about
[31:12] denomination i'll say amen to that if
[31:13] there's ever a denomination you've lost
[31:15] your pastor
[31:19] brother members said they think you have
[31:20] to have curly hair i'm so glad this is
[31:22] in the message
[31:26] they think you have to have hair
[31:29] curly hair and wear tuxedo suits and say
[31:31] oh man so beautiful all like this and be
[31:33] a prince he said that's a woman's puppet
[31:38] god wants men
[31:39] godly men men that can shake
[31:42] he don't mean men that can stand up here
[31:44] and shake but men that can shake
[31:46] something
[31:47] right by their words
[31:49] are you with me now men that can shake
[31:51] but today we want hollywood we want
[31:53] something that's desirable to the eye we
[31:54] want something that can speak so
[31:56] intellectually that he can let us sleep
[31:58] for five minutes on sunday morning
[32:01] so glad to see all these kids awake this
[32:03] morning and bright-eyed and taking notes
[32:06] but that's what people want somebody can
[32:08] let them sleep for five minutes he said
[32:10] we want something so intellectually he
[32:11] could let us sleep for five minutes on
[32:12] sunday morning he said god wants
[32:14] separators who will send her forth like
[32:16] a blaze of lightning this is what god
[32:18] wants to see a sign of life that god
[32:19] wants to see in the pulpit he wants
[32:21] separators to send her forth like a
[32:22] blaze of lightning condemned sin to the
[32:25] roots
[32:26] dig it out he said but we want our
[32:28] intellectual pastors most of people
[32:30] wants a whispering pastor
[32:32] somebody says yes theory
[32:35] god wants thunderbolts
[32:38] i feel mad sometimes i feel like i'm
[32:40] yelling at you but that's god wants
[32:41] thunderbolts
[32:44] not whispering pastures
[32:49] you find the signs of life in the pulpit
[32:51] if the church is alive
[32:53] where else would you find signs of life
[32:54] it wouldn't be just in the pulpit
[32:57] now we're going to move down in a minute
[32:59] you find signs of life at the altar
[33:02] not traditionally you'd have an altar in
[33:03] the front of the church let's look at
[33:04] that for just a moment signs of life at
[33:06] the altar let's go to malachi chapter 1
[33:09] and verse 6.
[33:12] malachi chapter 1 and verse 6.
[33:14] you can turn there with me if you want
[33:15] this morning it's just i'm going to read
[33:17] several verses
[33:18] a son honoreth his father and a servant
[33:20] as master
[33:21] if i if then i be a father where is my
[33:24] honor if i be a master where's my fear
[33:26] said the lord of hosts unto you o
[33:28] priests that despise my name and you say
[33:30] we're in if we despise thy name you
[33:32] offer polluted bread upon mine altar
[33:36] so they are offering a less than perfect
[33:38] sacrifice aren't you glad your sacrifice
[33:40] is perfect
[33:42] but there was trouble at the altar
[33:45] because the people
[33:47] were not willing to get into the to the
[33:50] service
[33:51] and give their all to it
[33:54] are you with me this morning they were
[33:56] offering polluted bread and you say
[33:58] wherein have we polluted thee so the
[34:00] thing they were offering what wasn't
[34:01] what was polluted but it's the way and
[34:04] the attitude that they had when they
[34:05] offered it
[34:07] think about it and then they later
[34:08] because they had that attitude they
[34:10] brought the lame and the blind and
[34:11] everything else to the altar but now
[34:14] it's the attitude he said why where have
[34:16] we polluted thee and that you say the
[34:18] table of the lord is contemptible and
[34:20] that means actually to regard something
[34:23] as worthless
[34:25] you can take it or leave it right
[34:29] and so people today and i typed this to
[34:31] an altar because it's at the altar in
[34:33] the sense that people have regarded
[34:36] people have regarded this the the
[34:38] services that we have and the time that
[34:40] we have around the altar specifically
[34:42] and we'll get to the pew in just a
[34:44] minute don't worry
[34:45] but
[34:47] the part about the altar is that the
[34:49] altar has been despised in this day as
[34:51] something that's worthless it's not
[34:52] worth coming to it's not worth having a
[34:54] service when somebody's praying that we
[34:57] just want them to let us go so and we
[34:59] want to just move out real quick because
[35:01] the altar time is there but we should
[35:03] not despise the altar if i could just
[35:05] use a play on words this morning i know
[35:07] they were talking about an old testament
[35:09] alter them but we should not despise a
[35:11] new testament altar a place and a time
[35:14] for a sinner to make his heart right
[35:17] there's got to be a place for you
[35:19] where you make your heart right there's
[35:21] got to be a place he said brother ben
[35:23] but i feel so so condemned when i come
[35:25] to church but listen to me i hope you
[35:27] can hear me today there's a place of
[35:28] freedom there's a place that there's a
[35:30] place you can come to where the word
[35:32] doesn't condemn you anymore when you
[35:34] don't feel bad about those things and
[35:36] it's not because you're a good person
[35:38] it's not because of how you live
[35:40] necessarily but it's because you come
[35:42] face to face with that burning bush and
[35:44] that pillar of fire and you've literally
[35:46] given surrendered your entire life to
[35:48] god and he's come and forgiven you of
[35:50] your sins and washed all of the things
[35:52] away from you and you know that
[35:54] regardless you may still make mistakes
[35:56] you may have problems in your life but
[35:58] you've reached a place of assurance and
[36:00] safety and you can come with confidence
[36:01] to the altar of god oh don't you want
[36:03] that place today
[36:05] oh my
[36:07] don't you want that place
[36:08] don't you want to be in that place
[36:12] we should bring our best to the altar
[36:16] he said if you offer the blind for
[36:17] sacrifice is it not evil
[36:20] if you offer the lame and sick
[36:23] i'll think about our attitudes now
[36:26] but the steward's going to preach
[36:27] tonight so he'll he'll preach his back
[36:29] happy but i just want us to think about
[36:30] it
[36:33] if you offer the lame and sick is it not
[36:35] evil
[36:37] offer it now unto thy governor
[36:39] and we can say it this way go give that
[36:41] effort to your boss
[36:44] will he be pleased with thee
[36:46] will he accept thee joel's boss might
[36:48] because he works for himself but
[36:52] the effort that you put into the house
[36:54] of god
[36:55] what are we doing here church
[36:57] and i don't say this to false your
[36:59] effort but to to see it continue
[37:01] to see it continue because we can get to
[37:03] a place where the preacher is preaching
[37:05] his heart out and everybody just sits
[37:06] there and watches i don't want a church
[37:08] like that i don't want to be a part of a
[37:10] church like that i want to see a
[37:11] reaction it may not be people jumping
[37:13] and shouting and running but under the
[37:15] control of the head there may be
[37:16] something a reaction there something
[37:18] that's alive something that moves in the
[37:20] in response to the word there's got to
[37:22] be something there if you offer
[37:24] something less than your best to god if
[37:26] you make church secondary if you say
[37:28] well i might go or i might not go what
[37:30] does that do
[37:33] how does god view that
[37:35] he said well if you offered that effort
[37:36] to your boss what would it be like
[37:42] so now i pray you beseech god that he
[37:44] will be gracious unto us
[37:46] this has been
[37:48] by your means he says will he regard
[37:49] your person saith the lord of hosts
[37:52] who is there even among you that would
[37:54] shut the doors for naught now they had
[37:55] reached such a place that they wouldn't
[37:57] even close the doors in the church
[37:59] wouldn't even lock up unless they were
[38:00] paid for it
[38:04] think about it
[38:06] neither do you kindle fire on mine altar
[38:08] for not
[38:09] you know how we get paid many times i'm
[38:12] just going to preach i can't help it
[38:13] just stay with me this morning
[38:15] you know how many times we get paid we
[38:17] expect applause
[38:20] i know i got to a place
[38:22] sometimes as a preacher you get to a
[38:23] place where well nobody said there was a
[38:24] good sermon but that's not why i preach
[38:27] right
[38:29] i'm preaching to help people
[38:31] just put a fire under people
[38:33] and i my master is upstairs
[38:36] right he he's not
[38:38] he's not so concerned about whether
[38:39] people said it was a good sermon but
[38:41] whether or not the word was preached
[38:44] are you with me now and so they'd reach
[38:47] such a place they wouldn't do nothing
[38:49] unless somebody
[38:51] oh you're good man you're good man you
[38:53] you just man you just bless the people
[38:55] you just helped but listen i've always
[38:58] looked at it like this you know like
[38:59] simon i've preached that to you before
[39:01] simon was standing there on the side of
[39:02] the road and here comes jesus with a
[39:04] with a cross and he's carrying it and
[39:06] it's going
[39:07] up down the road and jesus reaches a
[39:10] place where in his physical body where
[39:11] he's so tired he's so weak that he can't
[39:14] go on anymore
[39:15] and he reaches such a place that he
[39:17] falls down
[39:18] and simon is standing there by the side
[39:20] of the road and he just happens to see
[39:22] the body of christ fall and he says what
[39:25] am i going to do and here a roman
[39:27] soldier compels him said you carry his
[39:29] cross
[39:30] that's what i feel like ministry is
[39:33] you're standing there and the holy
[39:34] spirit comes and compels you to go and
[39:37] carry the cross to pick up the body of
[39:39] christ when it's sweet not to be the one
[39:41] that gets the most applause not to be
[39:42] the one that gets has the most views on
[39:44] facebook not to be the person to pastor
[39:46] the biggest church but to be somebody
[39:48] are you with me this morning that could
[39:50] be a help that can do the things that
[39:52] nobody sees nobody sees who sweeps the
[39:54] floors nobody sees who shows up early
[39:56] and prays nobody sees who gets down by
[39:58] their bed at night and prays for the
[40:00] pastor and the musicians and the song
[40:01] leader nobody sees those people but god
[40:04] sees it
[40:05] nobody sees who gives sacrificially
[40:07] nobody sees many of those things but god
[40:09] sees it
[40:11] amen and he appreciates that so much he
[40:14] said i have no pleasure in in the things
[40:16] that you do because of your attitude
[40:18] towards it you want to be paid for it
[40:21] you want to be noticed for him
[40:23] oh god help us today
[40:24] i know we preachers get like that too
[40:26] many times but god help me i know i'd
[40:28] rather have somebody notice me than not
[40:30] notice me
[40:32] everybody would you don't want to not be
[40:33] noticed but that's not why we do it
[40:36] amen
[40:37] he said neither do you kindle fire on my
[40:39] altar for not i have no pleasure in you
[40:40] saith the lord of hosts neither will i
[40:42] accept an offering at your hand
[40:44] from the rising of the sun even to the
[40:46] going down of the same my name shall be
[40:48] great among the gentiles that's us this
[40:49] morning hey man he said in every place
[40:52] incense shall be offered unto my name
[40:53] and a pure offering for my name shall be
[40:55] great among the heathen saith the lord
[40:57] of hosts but if you have profaned it in
[40:59] that you say the table the lord is
[41:01] polluted and the fruit thereof even his
[41:03] meat is contemptible it's worthless
[41:05] you said also behold what a weariness is
[41:07] it
[41:08] and you're snuffed at it said the lord
[41:10] of hosts
[41:12] oh it's just church again
[41:14] i can't i don't even want to go
[41:19] it's not a problem with the church
[41:22] it's a problem with our attitude
[41:25] i don't care if there's a preacher that
[41:26] couldn't hardly stumble over two words
[41:29] or a singer and musicians that could
[41:31] barely play
[41:32] or no musicians at all it's the house of
[41:36] the lord
[41:38] it's the house of the lord and the house
[41:41] of the lord deserves my best
[41:44] it deserves my reverence
[41:46] it deserves my effort
[41:49] are you with me this morning
[41:52] so i appreciate i enjoy seeing some of
[41:53] our backups placed sometimes and some of
[41:55] the ones that don't do it all the time
[41:56] and i appreciate the effort our regular
[41:58] musicians put into it my we have a
[42:00] wonderful service but when we have
[42:01] backups and extras and things like that
[42:03] and they're able to play and and the
[42:05] preachers who aren't the pastor you know
[42:06] you all are providing for my living so
[42:08] i'm able to study and and go and and go
[42:10] and do and be there for people and pray
[42:13] for people and y'all do that you provide
[42:15] for me you provide well but these other
[42:17] brothers aren't compensated other than
[42:19] just an offering now and then for what
[42:20] they do but i tell you what that reward
[42:22] many times will be greater
[42:24] because what i do i do it by obligation
[42:27] does it make sense but many of you
[42:29] volunteer
[42:30] and i'm so glad that you do but i like
[42:32] to see the backups many times or
[42:34] something it's not so great maybe what
[42:36] they do but they got number one they got
[42:37] to learn and another thing is they're
[42:39] doing it from their heart
[42:41] not because somebody said oh somebody
[42:43] begged him to do it
[42:45] so many people excuse me but people act
[42:47] like they don't want to do stuff well i
[42:48] don't want to do it really what they
[42:49] want you to do is beg them to do it
[42:52] we should not have to beg people to
[42:53] worship
[42:54] we shouldn't have to beg people to come
[42:56] to church
[42:57] shouldn't have to beg people to play the
[42:58] piano or to play the drums or do
[43:00] whatever there should be something in
[43:01] your heart that cries out to god every
[43:03] day of the lord i want to be right i
[43:05] want to be i want to live for you what
[43:07] can i do if the body of christ is weak
[43:09] in some area let me pick up the cross
[43:12] carry it to the best of my ability
[43:15] because not everybody has the ability to
[43:16] do that
[43:18] he said what a weariness it is you
[43:20] brought that with which was torn and
[43:22] lame and the sick
[43:23] he said thus you brought an offering
[43:24] should i accept this of your hand saith
[43:26] the lord
[43:27] but cursed be the deceiver who hath in
[43:29] his flock of male
[43:30] he has the ability to do something
[43:32] beyond what he's doing and voweth and
[43:34] sacrifice unto the lord a corrupt thing
[43:36] i'm a great king saith the lord of hosts
[43:38] my name is dreadful among the heathen
[43:40] see god wants your best
[43:42] at the altar
[43:45] brother said we've gone off without the
[43:46] old time prayer meetings and the baptism
[43:48] of the holy ghost coming back until the
[43:50] fire is burnt low
[43:51] you can cry out and try to get people to
[43:54] the altar and they just walk up like
[43:56] they were almost dead
[43:57] a dread to come
[44:00] and then ask ministers to come pray with
[44:01] them oh why did he ask me for
[44:04] they get down there you can't hardly get
[44:05] them and they'll stand there just for a
[44:07] few minutes look up at you go back and
[44:08] sit down on their feet to me he said the
[44:10] fire has gone out
[44:12] something has happened listen what we
[44:13] need is a revival that sinners looking
[44:15] upon christ repent run to the altar with
[44:17] their hands up screaming for mercy and
[44:20] the whole church is the flame of fire
[44:22] with the glory of god
[44:25] so that must have been back in the 40s
[44:27] known as in 1964.
[44:29] brother branham didn't change that
[44:31] with the opening of the word
[44:33] he said i went to places even and the
[44:36] people who's supposed to be
[44:37] spirit-filled people and see altar calls
[44:38] made he said why you couldn't get people
[44:40] to go in with anybody to pray with him
[44:42] he said that shows it's ichabod
[44:44] the spirit of the lord has departed
[44:46] he said but when you see that seal and
[44:48] fire and longing long for human souls
[44:52] in brother branham's tent vision we've
[44:53] talked about it several times recently
[44:55] he had his vision about a tent and he
[44:57] saw in the he never said he was going to
[44:58] come back and preach in a tent that's
[45:00] something somebody else said but he did
[45:02] have a vision about a tent in that third
[45:04] pole vision and when he had the vision
[45:06] about the tent he also saw an altar call
[45:09] but he saw in the first place he said
[45:11] they didn't have an altar call if you go
[45:12] back to the original place where he
[45:14] tells the vision in in waters of vision
[45:16] in 1956 they had an altar call they were
[45:18] begging for money
[45:20] instead of souls
[45:22] listen if i'm going to be sincere about
[45:24] something let it be souls not money
[45:27] are you with me now if i'm going to care
[45:29] about something let it be souls not
[45:31] money
[45:33] they're begging for money and he said i
[45:34] just made an altar call it seemed like
[45:37] down at the altar now he's talking about
[45:38] later he said when i was down there i
[45:40] looked and there was hundreds of people
[45:42] standing around the altar weeping
[45:44] because they had accepted the lord jesus
[45:46] and they were just weeping out loud he
[45:49] said and i said oh that's more like it
[45:51] like that
[45:53] well their heart was in it they weren't
[45:55] just begging for money that's a
[45:56] denominational thing
[45:58] listen we don't have the money to
[46:00] operate we'll just shut down
[46:02] and we do we're not short on money don't
[46:04] get that in your head this morning
[46:06] we're not short on money but you see
[46:07] that if we don't have the money to
[46:08] operate i'm not gonna beg you for it
[46:10] i'll go get a job and provide for it
[46:12] myself and i believe god would provide
[46:14] are you with me this morning

[46:18] coming to the altar this way he said

[48:11] the word revival produced an emotion in
[48:12] the people listen to deuteronomy 12 and

[49:28] woman inside of their heart there's
[49:30] something even though they're grieving
[49:32] in tears they're flowing down their face
[49:33] but they're still worshiping god because
[49:35] they're saying lord i know you give and

[50:40] amen
[50:42] with lifting up their hands are some of
[50:43] you all about to have a stroke aren't
[50:44] you
[50:47] amen amen with lifting up their hands
[50:49] and they bowed their heads and worshiped
[50:51] the lord with their faces to the ground
[50:54] amen
[50:55] amen psalms 150 says praise you the lord
[50:58] listen it's the sign of life in the pew
[51:00] not the only sign of life but a sign of
[51:03] life
[51:04] praise you the lord praise god in his
[51:06] sanctuary praise him in the firmament of
[51:08] his power praise him for his mighty acts
[51:10] praise him according to his excellent
[51:12] greatness praise him with the sound of
[51:14] the trumpet praise him with the sultry
[51:16] and heart praise him with the timbrel
[51:17] and dance praise him with stringed
[51:19] instruments and organs
[51:21] amen praise him upon the loud symbols
[51:26] huh these are the loud symbols
[51:28] you can't even hear that's the loud
[51:30] symbols
[51:33] the loud says he can't have drums in the
[51:34] church well the loud cymbals
[51:39] oh my
[51:41] praise him on the high sounding symbols
[51:44] that's that little one right there
[51:45] probably
[51:48] praise him on the loud symbols on the
[51:50] high sounding symbols
[51:52] i think sometimes we forget that we
[51:54] worship an almighty god
[51:56] listen there's nothing that goes on in
[51:58] our life and again i'm not saying that
[52:00] because i feel that i feel that god
[52:03] allowed me to have a i have a feeling
[52:05] for people i empathize with people but
[52:07] some of you been through things i can't
[52:08] empathize with
[52:10] you've been through things i i've never
[52:12] been through i don't know what that's
[52:13] like but i do know this god is still
[52:15] faithful
[52:17] he's still the same yesterday today and
[52:19] forever
[52:20] he didn't die he's still alive
[52:23] it may be hard the time that you're
[52:25] going through the the struggle that
[52:27] you're going through right now maybe
[52:28] just sit in church it's a struggle to
[52:30] even be there but there's something
[52:31] inside of you that's still rejoicing
[52:33] you're still praising god i believe we
[52:35] can have a good service and worship god
[52:37] and trust god even when coven rages
[52:39] outside even when war rages outside
[52:42] david said the war rages against me in
[52:44] this will i be confident amen he's
[52:47] hidden me in the shelter he's hidden me
[52:48] in the secret of his tabernacle
[52:51] hey man aren't you glad for a god like
[52:53] that today
[52:55] hallelujah you still alive this morning
[52:59] oh i'm going to start looking for some
[53:00] signs of life in the pew
[53:03] amen the bible says speaking to yourself
[53:05] that's that's the old testament say well
[53:07] that's the old testament let everything
[53:08] have breath praise the lord it's the old
[53:10] testament let's look at the new
[53:11] testament ephesians 5 19 speaking to
[53:13] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[53:16] spiritual songs
[53:17] three different types of songs and we'll
[53:19] go into that sometime i've done it
[53:20] before where we talk about the different
[53:23] kinds of songs because not every kind of
[53:24] song is the same
[53:26] and for the same purpose and we get in
[53:28] the spirit of the lord and sometimes the
[53:29] song will make you cry sometimes the
[53:30] song will make you rejoice and make you
[53:32] happy and that's a good thing because
[53:34] god allows us to have music good music
[53:36] spiritual music for that reason
[53:38] he said singing and making melody in
[53:40] your heart to the lord verse 20 giving
[53:42] thanks always
[53:44] for all things
[53:46] that's difficult
[53:50] that's more difficult than what i
[53:51] thought when i was a kid
[53:54] because i've seen so much more
[53:57] it's more difficult than what you
[53:58] thought when you were a kid
[54:00] because you've seen so much more
[54:02] and if your life has never been touched
[54:04] by grief you say oh that's that's easy
[54:06] in all things giving thanks i thank god
[54:07] for my job i thank god for my car i
[54:09] thank god for that i thank god for that
[54:11] wife he gave me i thank god for my kids
[54:14] thank god for my money in the bank
[54:17] but he said all things
[54:20] so you have cancer
[54:22] then do you think god for all things
[54:26] you never say thank god for the cancer
[54:28] but you say thank god that even during
[54:30] cancer
[54:31] i know i have a god who heals cancer
[54:35] in all things thank giving thanks always
[54:37] for all things
[54:39] you lost your job giving thanks always
[54:41] for all things god must have a better
[54:43] job for me
[54:45] are you with me now god must have a
[54:46] better job god must have i've lost some
[54:48] things i've lost some friends in my
[54:49] lifetime i've had troubles and struggles
[54:52] but god must have had something better
[54:53] for me
[54:56] god's got something better giving thanks
[54:58] always for all things unto god and the
[55:00] father in the name of our lord jesus
[55:02] christ
[55:03] listen brother brandon said this about
[55:04] he said well music's not supposed to
[55:05] make you feel good i'm just going to
[55:08] kill that devil this morning let's put
[55:09] it like that
[55:12] people say well music's not supposed to
[55:14] make you feel good it's just supposed to
[55:15] make you well it made brother random
[55:16] feel good
[55:18] it made moses feel good it made made
[55:21] david feel good when he danced to it
[55:24] music's not supposed to make you feel
[55:25] good listen but the brandon said you
[55:27] talking to a man he said i want to be
[55:28] sure you get that for me if you have a
[55:29] little tape put it on it for me special
[55:31] so my children want to hear it he said
[55:33] when i get get kind of get down a little
[55:36] low i hear that it makes me feel good
[55:39] and i've heard it said well music don't
[55:41] make you feel good it's not supposed to
[55:42] do that it's supposed to convict you
[55:43] there's times it's supposed to convict
[55:44] you there's times it's supposed to make
[55:45] you feel good
[55:48] to hear good singing he said billy i go
[55:50] in the office down there and he has
[55:51] constantly got them tapes of singing
[55:52] going all the time and i think it kind
[55:54] of helps him i remember going in brother
[55:55] billy paul's office at the in
[55:57] jeffersonville and looking and all over
[55:59] his office he had cds back then we had a
[56:01] thing called cds
[56:03] a little round disc you know we put in
[56:05] our car
[56:06] and played music on and brother billy
[56:08] paul his office was full of southern
[56:09] gospel music maybe i shouldn't tell on
[56:11] him like that but just full of it he
[56:12] just loves southern gospel music and
[56:14] brother branham told that on him back
[56:15] then he said i go in the office he's
[56:17] constantly got them tapes of singing
[56:19] going all the time he said i think it
[56:20] kind of helps him
[56:23] he said you know there's something about
[56:24] song that's got power in it we all know
[56:26] that he said we're aware of that he said
[56:28] see he said let's look at the army when
[56:30] they sing the songs and play the music
[56:31] do you know the approach to war in the
[56:33] army of god is first by music the
[56:36] singers went before the ark rejoicing
[56:38] and singing he said then come the ark
[56:40] and then the battle that's right so
[56:42] that's the right approach
[56:45] hallelujah sometimes you feel so bad
[56:48] because of the things you've been
[56:48] through you need to be made to feel good
[56:51] before you can hear the word
[56:54] and sometimes you need to be made quiet
[56:57] so you can worship
[56:59] and so you can hear the word it just
[57:00] depends on what you're going through but
[57:02] god knows
[57:04] god knows and he's able and that's why
[57:06] when we come to play when we come to
[57:07] lead singing we should pray
[57:09] because what you do is just as important
[57:11] as what i do we should pray we should
[57:13] seek god because it's not a last-minute
[57:15] thing it's something that is something
[57:16] that matters
[57:19] because there's in order to be signs of
[57:21] life in the church there's got to be a
[57:22] response to the music and the music
[57:24] needs to be right i'm glad for the music
[57:27] that we have and many times most of the
[57:28] time it's right and i'm glad for that
[57:31] i'm glad for that listen
[57:33] that's the right approach
[57:34] it's through singing
[57:36] where else would we look for signs of
[57:37] life now you think brother ben you're
[57:39] running out of places
[57:40] not yet
[57:44] not yet you see we don't just
[57:46] worship together
[57:48] we fellowship with one another
[57:51] and we have a fellowship although not
[57:52] every church does but every church has
[57:54] somewhere someplace or maybe the the the
[57:58] all the lot outside the parking lot
[58:01] maybe the mcdonald's every every place
[58:04] every church has some place
[58:05] where the people fellowship together we
[58:08] have a fellowship host i want to look
[58:09] for signs of life
[58:11] have i got a few minutes this morning
[58:13] we haven't been very long there's got to
[58:15] be signs of life in the fellowship hall
[58:18] oh it's getting quiet
[58:22] you said well brother ben i haven't been
[58:23] in there in two years or five years or
[58:25] whatever but there's signs of life in
[58:27] the fellowship hall
[58:29] i'm so glad to see some signs of life
[58:32] well i told you here before brother
[58:33] branham he said he talked about the holy
[58:35] ghost he said the holy ghost he said
[58:37] here was a rock he said he turned over a
[58:38] rock and there was a little seed had
[58:40] grown into a little a little flower a
[58:42] little lily and he screamed out he said
[58:44] father look at this
[58:46] amen what was it a sign of life
[58:49] and all that chaos and darkness
[58:51] the word was working and the word
[58:54] doesn't just work in the in the pulpit
[58:55] the word doesn't just work at the altar
[58:57] the word doesn't just work in the pew
[58:59] but the word works in the fellowship
[59:00] hall
[59:05] acts 2 42 the first thing the church did
[59:08] very early in the church the church
[59:09] began to fellowship
[59:11] it says they continued steadfastly in
[59:13] the apostles doctrine oh that's good
[59:14] brother ben they all had the same
[59:15] doctrine oh saying the same things
[59:17] that's wonderful and fellowship
[59:20] and in breaking of bread
[59:22] that's eating together
[59:24] and just standing there and break bread
[59:25] but literally eating together
[59:28] and in prayers
[59:30] i am pro eating together not just
[59:32] because i'm fat
[59:36] but you fellowship around a meal many
[59:38] times
[59:39] many times you fellowship around a meal
[59:41] i've been
[59:41] uh proud of some of you because you
[59:43] invite people over and you do things
[59:44] like that and and the erskins are new
[59:47] with us but they've tried to make their
[59:48] home a place of fellowship and i tried
[59:50] to make mine a place of fellowship some
[59:51] of you all don't ever get to come and i
[59:53] apologize for that but we've tried to
[59:55] work our way through the church and have
[59:56] different people over and you just got
[59:58] people over on sunday night and my wife
[1:00:00] may kill me for saying this but if you
[1:00:02] if you want to fellowship some on sunday
[1:00:03] night come to my house
[1:00:05] because we've always got something going
[1:00:06] on after church because it takes me a
[1:00:08] little bit to kind of get out of the
[1:00:09] service a little bit and so we usually
[1:00:12] have something going on at my house on
[1:00:14] sunday night but there's a reason why we
[1:00:15] do that because we love one another
[1:00:18] it's not because somebody get up got up
[1:00:19] here and told us to do it
[1:00:21] right but if there's got to be signs of
[1:00:24] life in our fellowship
[1:00:26] in how we treat one another
[1:00:28] look in first peter 22 122 seeing you
[1:00:31] have purified your souls and obeying the
[1:00:33] truth to the spirit unto unfeigned
[1:00:36] and what that means is when you see
[1:00:37] somebody i see brother joe i don't have
[1:00:39] to say oh brother joe i'm so glad to see
[1:00:41] you i just love you and then walk away
[1:00:43] and say i can't stand that man
[1:00:46] that's feigned love
[1:00:49] right feign love woke up to brother
[1:00:51] austin and say brother austin i just
[1:00:53] love you you're just such a wonderful
[1:00:55] person god bless you man that guy's
[1:00:57] annoying
[1:00:59] he's 16 he's got a right to be annoying
[1:01:01] right
[1:01:02] but that's what that's what we do many
[1:01:04] times that's feigned love fake love
[1:01:08] he said see that you have purified your
[1:01:10] souls
[1:01:11] from what from malice from bitterness
[1:01:13] from hate
[1:01:14] you know obeying the truth through the
[1:01:15] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[1:01:17] brethren see that you love one another
[1:01:19] with a pure heart
[1:01:21] fervently
[1:01:23] fervently
[1:01:25] amen with it put some effort into it
[1:01:28] love one another fervently hey man he
[1:01:31] said then the first thing you know
[1:01:33] listen he's talking about brother brown
[1:01:34] was talking about the fellowship our
[1:01:36] fellowship together many times it
[1:01:37] happens at the fellowship hall but
[1:01:38] wherever you fellowship he said the
[1:01:40] first thing you know when you started
[1:01:41] doing those things you let down the bars
[1:01:43] you begin compromising
[1:01:45] then the church began to get little
[1:01:47] clicks in among them
[1:01:49] it always goes together when there's a
[1:01:50] compromise in the word
[1:01:53] and listen if there's a moral compromise
[1:01:55] there is a compromise in the word
[1:01:59] it always goes together
[1:02:00] but when you have a compromise in the
[1:02:02] word then you have a compromise
[1:02:05] in fellowship
[1:02:07] it brings down fellowship he said the
[1:02:08] church begins to get little clucks
[1:02:10] clicks in among them and this one said
[1:02:13] you know the pastor is just so-and-so or
[1:02:14] the deacon so and so
[1:02:16] and the first thing you know you listen
[1:02:18] to that
[1:02:20] and that's the reason we've had so much
[1:02:21] trouble is because you begin to listen
[1:02:24] to the devil and get a snarl instead of
[1:02:26] listening to the gentle dove the holy
[1:02:28] spirit the dove of god that would lead
[1:02:30] you and guide you love you and bless you
[1:02:32] he said first time you get one of those
[1:02:34] little temper spasms
[1:02:37] because you've been listening to that
[1:02:39] that's right
[1:02:40] the dove flies right away
[1:02:44] he said well you know it's like little
[1:02:46] clicks will rise up in the church
[1:02:48] you know it's you pastors
[1:02:50] see they like they say birds of a
[1:02:51] feather but if we're born again brethren
[1:02:54] that's not the attitude to take
[1:02:56] i ought to be able to fellowship with
[1:02:57] every one of you know there's some of us
[1:02:59] don't have so much so many things in
[1:03:00] common we won't maybe fellowship
[1:03:02] together so much outside of the church
[1:03:04] but when we're here together we ought to
[1:03:05] be able to fellowship together as much
[1:03:08] with an old person as a young person as
[1:03:10] a middle-aged person as a person with
[1:03:12] children with no children why because
[1:03:14] we're all brothers and sisters in christ
[1:03:17] no clicks
[1:03:20] now you may in your everyday life
[1:03:21] there's people you know you got your
[1:03:22] kids in school maybe your kids are in
[1:03:23] school with somebody and they become
[1:03:24] friends because they're around them but
[1:03:26] that's the reason we come to church and
[1:03:28] fellowship here
[1:03:30] because we're all together
[1:03:32] and it keeps clicks from forming he said
[1:03:34] you know it you pastors he said you know
[1:03:36] it you pastors see they say birds of a
[1:03:39] feather but if we're born again brother
[1:03:40] that's not the attitude to take if we
[1:03:42] see something wrong in our brethren
[1:03:43] listen to this god help me this morning
[1:03:46] god help me many times i'll bring it up
[1:03:47] and i'm i i'm ashamed of myself for
[1:03:49] doing that i don't spread stuff around
[1:03:51] but sometimes just around the table i
[1:03:53] get so frustrated i'll get a phone call
[1:03:54] or a text and i say why do they do it
[1:03:56] like that why do people have because i
[1:03:58] have to deal with other places other
[1:03:59] churches other ministers and and not
[1:04:01] people here but just around i'll say why
[1:04:03] do they have to do it like that and i'll
[1:04:04] say that publicly and i feel bad about
[1:04:06] that because you know but the brown said
[1:04:08] if we see something wrong in our
[1:04:09] brethren let us just pray and keep it
[1:04:12] before god
[1:04:13] and love that man
[1:04:16] till we bring him right into the
[1:04:18] presence
[1:04:19] of god
[1:04:21] he said that's really the way to do it
[1:04:26] he said but brother bennett just don't
[1:04:27] make me happy well you need to check up
[1:04:28] on your experience
[1:04:31] i don't like being around people because
[1:04:33] of something that happened or something
[1:04:34] that's taken place you need to check you
[1:04:36] need to get that out because it'll
[1:04:38] become a habit
[1:04:40] i know things you don't get over things
[1:04:41] overnight but it needs to move its way
[1:04:44] out
[1:04:45] it needs to work its way out because if
[1:04:46] it never works its way out you always
[1:04:48] have less than what you could have in
[1:04:49] fellowship
[1:04:51] brother brandon said the pleasure of a
[1:04:53] christian is serving the lord at the
[1:04:55] house of god
[1:04:56] you don't have to sign up no cards
[1:04:59] you can't open the door quick enough
[1:05:03] you ever been to a one of these
[1:05:06] concerts
[1:05:07] i i've never been to a country concert
[1:05:09] or rock and roll concert i've been to
[1:05:11] southern gospel music concerts that's
[1:05:13] the only type of concert i've ever been
[1:05:14] to outside of just you know singing in
[1:05:16] church
[1:05:17] and them old people be there early
[1:05:20] we'll go through sometimes silver dollar
[1:05:22] city and then them folks will be there
[1:05:23] in their wheelchairs and in their
[1:05:25] buggies they'll be there at uh maybe
[1:05:27] some of y'all or some of them i don't
[1:05:28] know but
[1:05:30] but they'll be there in their little
[1:05:31] buggy little cart four hours before the
[1:05:34] singing starts
[1:05:36] and they're waiting in the heat and the
[1:05:38] sun and they're sitting there and they
[1:05:40] make sure they got there right when they
[1:05:41] open that they flood in
[1:05:43] and then they sit in the heat on hard
[1:05:45] benches for four hours
[1:05:48] to see their favorite gospel singer and
[1:05:51] it always amazes me i said them people
[1:05:52] have zeal why because that's their
[1:05:54] pleasure
[1:05:56] the pleasure of a southern gospel music
[1:05:58] fan is to be there when when ernie hoss
[1:06:00] begins to sing
[1:06:02] that's their pleasure
[1:06:04] the pleasure of a ball a ball fan
[1:06:06] they'll show up early in the day and
[1:06:08] they'll go all day drinking and crowds
[1:06:09] and when they finally get to game time
[1:06:11] they'll be sure they're in the stadium
[1:06:13] buy the best seats they can find and be
[1:06:15] right among the people and they're so
[1:06:16] happy and so and and they're making
[1:06:18] noise and glad to be there why the
[1:06:20] pleasure of a baseball fan or a football
[1:06:23] fan is being in the stadium that's where
[1:06:25] they're their happiest listen to me but
[1:06:27] the pleasure of a christian is serving
[1:06:29] the lord at the house of god you don't
[1:06:31] have to sign no cards you can't open the
[1:06:33] door quick enough they'll be there
[1:06:36] why it's their pleasure amen
[1:06:38] it's their pleasure oh let it be our
[1:06:40] place many times the world drags that
[1:06:42] out of us our bodies we don't feel like
[1:06:44] it it may not be the pleasure of the
[1:06:45] flesh but it's the pleasure of the
[1:06:47] christian
[1:06:48] amen many times you don't feel like it
[1:06:50] and your body will
[1:06:52] especially around church time you begin
[1:06:54] to hurt but the pleasure of a christian
[1:06:55] is serving the lord at the house of god
[1:06:57] i know some of you sometimes you can't
[1:06:59] come but you want to be here that's your
[1:07:00] desire and i see that in your heart and
[1:07:02] in your eyes and when you are here you
[1:07:04] really worship and i appreciate that
[1:07:06] because that's your pleasure
[1:07:08] i didn't have to sign you up for that
[1:07:09] but you're here
[1:07:11] if the members of the church love one
[1:07:12] another he said enough instead of
[1:07:14] putting little clicks and pulling away
[1:07:16] from the church he said brother if you
[1:07:18] love one another so much that it just
[1:07:20] hurts your heart
[1:07:22] do you got together again
[1:07:30] it'd be less fighting if we did that
[1:07:34] i uh
[1:07:36] i've got family i'm not able to be
[1:07:37] around very much
[1:07:38] khalil lives in oklahoma and we go to
[1:07:41] meetings when we go to meetings over
[1:07:42] there you know you're always busy
[1:07:44] doing stuff so they come over when there
[1:07:45] wasn't a meeting so we spent some time
[1:07:47] together
[1:07:48] and the boys and and i'm so glad to be
[1:07:50] able to do that but i got family i'm not
[1:07:51] able to be around much i'm around you
[1:07:53] guys more
[1:07:54] but you know what i miss you more than i
[1:07:56] do some of my family
[1:07:59] i got family that serves the lord i'm
[1:08:01] thankful for that because that's double
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:03] but you know how you miss the grandkids
[1:08:05] if you haven't seen them in a while you
[1:08:06] miss somebody an aunt or an uncle or
[1:08:08] somebody that you love you haven't seen
[1:08:10] them in a while
[1:08:11] oh how much more ought you to miss one
[1:08:13] another
[1:08:15] he said brother if you love one another
[1:08:16] so much that it just hurts your heart i
[1:08:19] can remember going to meetings as a kid
[1:08:21] just a little kid and when we left i
[1:08:23] felt so bad i thought oh i don't know
[1:08:25] when i'll see those people again
[1:08:27] i didn't remember what was preached
[1:08:31] i didn't know i was so little i didn't
[1:08:33] know what was going on
[1:08:34] but i love the people so much i want to
[1:08:36] be around the people that's the way we
[1:08:38] ought to be
[1:08:39] it just hurts your heart till you got
[1:08:41] together again that's the way it should
[1:08:43] be listen to me you see well but the
[1:08:44] people aren't friendly but the people
[1:08:47] are us
[1:08:51] if the people aren't fiddling the people
[1:08:53] are us that's the problem
[1:08:57] we put so much on a preacher
[1:08:59] standing in the pulpit and i've seen it
[1:09:01] people rush in
[1:09:03] and make sure they get their good seat
[1:09:04] and rush out because the pleasure of the
[1:09:06] people is hearing the preaching but the
[1:09:08] pleasure of the
[1:09:09] pleasure of the christian is to be is
[1:09:11] serving the lord at the house of god and
[1:09:13] to be together
[1:09:15] right if you love one another so much it
[1:09:17] just hurts your heart do you got
[1:09:18] together again that's the way it should
[1:09:19] be it's not about who's preaching
[1:09:22] it's about the word it's about the
[1:09:24] fellowship we have with one another he
[1:09:25] said oh god
[1:09:26] listen to this
[1:09:28] i'm closing in just a moment he said oh
[1:09:30] god if we have to take every miracle out
[1:09:32] of the church
[1:09:34] if we have to take all the pipe organs
[1:09:36] out
[1:09:38] and the plush pews
[1:09:40] give us back to that godly love
[1:09:43] brotherly love among the people and
[1:09:44] fellowship
[1:09:45] if we have to do all that take it back
[1:09:48] to that
[1:09:49] again
[1:09:52] what's he saying i'd rather have the
[1:09:54] fellowship than the nice piano
[1:09:56] it's a nice piano in austin but i'd
[1:09:58] rather have fellowship than the nice
[1:09:59] piano
[1:10:01] i'd rather have fellowship than a nice
[1:10:03] organ we've got a nice organ top of the
[1:10:05] line but i'd rather have fellowship than
[1:10:07] a nice organ we put i think pretty nice
[1:10:09] chairs in here for you but i'd rather
[1:10:11] have fellowship
[1:10:13] than the nice
[1:10:14] chairs are you with me now if we have to
[1:10:18] take every miracle
[1:10:20] listen i believe in miracles i believe
[1:10:21] god will do a miracle for you this
[1:10:23] morning if you'll ask him i believe in a
[1:10:25] god of miracles but if we had to do
[1:10:27] without miracles i'd rather do without
[1:10:29] that
[1:10:30] than do without love
[1:10:34] are you with me now we don't have to do
[1:10:35] without miracles but i'd rather
[1:10:37] do without miracles
[1:10:39] i'd rather have to take every miracle
[1:10:40] out of the church and have love
[1:10:43] take away the good preaching take or bad
[1:10:45] preaching whatever you think
[1:10:47] take away whatever it is take away all
[1:10:49] the sound equipment and everything else
[1:10:51] strip it there if i had love i'd be okay
[1:10:54] if there were people there that wanted
[1:10:56] to be together that wanted to worship
[1:10:58] god together that weren't just waiting
[1:10:59] the first chance they could get to get
[1:11:01] out the door but wanted to love one
[1:11:02] another wanted to be together if you
[1:11:04] could just have some people that really
[1:11:06] were in love with god and in love with
[1:11:07] one another what would you have oh
[1:11:10] church i don't you know this church i
[1:11:12] don't know if we may grow we may not i
[1:11:14] don't know what the future holds but i
[1:11:16] feel like the church will grow in
[1:11:17] numbers but only may we never lose the
[1:11:19] closeness
[1:11:20] of being able to look at one another and
[1:11:22] know each other's names
[1:11:24] and being able to shake hands with one
[1:11:25] another and being able to love and hug
[1:11:27] one another and being able to know if
[1:11:29] one person is hurting that the whole
[1:11:31] church is hurting with them
[1:11:33] oh god if we don't have that we need to
[1:11:35] do a checkup in our own hearts
[1:11:39] there's a problem
[1:11:40] in the fellowship hall
[1:11:42] there's no life
[1:11:44] in it
[1:11:48] john 13 35
[1:11:51] jesus said this is the way the world's
[1:11:53] gonna know
[1:11:54] this is the movement that they'll look
[1:11:56] for
[1:11:58] this is not how
[1:12:00] god knows god knows who's his
[1:12:02] that's how the world knows
[1:12:05] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:12:08] my disciples
[1:12:10] if you have love
[1:12:11] one to another
[1:12:13] they're watching like you did the little
[1:12:15] baby in the crib they're watching the
[1:12:16] baby in the crib and the baby's laying
[1:12:18] there
[1:12:19] and they walk over
[1:12:21] and they lay their hands i've done this
[1:12:22] to melody many times when she was a baby
[1:12:24] lay my hand on her head lay my hand over
[1:12:27] mouth to make sure she's breathing
[1:12:28] because they'll lay so still
[1:12:31] and the world is watching
[1:12:33] the
[1:12:34] church not to see what doctrine we
[1:12:37] preach
[1:12:38] but to see if we have loved one for
[1:12:39] another
[1:12:41] that's right
[1:12:42] they're watching when we rush out of the
[1:12:44] church and go and never be around
[1:12:45] anybody they're watching
[1:12:47] but this shall all men know that you're
[1:12:49] my disciples
[1:12:50] if you have love
[1:12:52] one to another
[1:12:55] oh god
[1:12:56] help us today
[1:12:58] musicians go ahead and come i'm gonna
[1:13:00] close
[1:13:06] there's a story of a young lady walked
[1:13:08] into a fabric shop
[1:13:10] she went up to the counter and asked the
[1:13:11] owner for some noisy rustling white
[1:13:14] material
[1:13:17] the owner owner finally found a couple
[1:13:19] bolts of fabric that would work but he
[1:13:21] was puzzled by
[1:13:22] why a young lady would want that
[1:13:25] why would anyone want several yards of
[1:13:27] noisy material
[1:13:29] finally his curiosity got the best of
[1:13:30] him and
[1:13:31] he asked the young lady
[1:13:33] why she wanted noisy cloth most people
[1:13:35] don't want that
[1:13:37] and she said you see
[1:13:39] i'm making a wedding gown
[1:13:42] my fiance is blind
[1:13:44] and when i walk down the aisle
[1:13:46] i want him to know when i've arrived at
[1:13:48] the altar
[1:13:50] so he won't be embarrassed
[1:13:54] listen we live in a blind world
[1:13:58] if you really love people
[1:14:00] you want to put the
[1:14:02] add the frills the lace whatever's going
[1:14:04] to make noise
[1:14:06] onto the dress
[1:14:08] so that people that's our love for one
[1:14:10] another
[1:14:11] so that the blind can see
[1:14:14] when we get to the church
[1:14:16] that we love one another
[1:14:19] she said he's blind he can't tell
[1:14:21] he can't tell
[1:14:23] when i when i stop
[1:14:25] so as soon as he heard the noise stop he
[1:14:27] would know she was there
[1:14:30] oh my
[1:14:31] i think that works would you bow your
[1:14:32] heads with me as this morning i think
[1:14:34] that works for us as christians too
[1:14:37] now we know jesus isn't blind
[1:14:39] he can see us
[1:14:41] but i want to make enough noise
[1:14:44] by the word that i'm wearing
[1:14:46] i want it to make enough of a difference
[1:14:47] in my life
[1:14:49] that he knows
[1:14:50] when i'm walking
[1:14:52] and he knows when i stop
[1:14:55] he can hear the rustle
[1:14:57] of the fabric
[1:14:58] oh god
[1:15:00] may my love be like that lord
[1:15:03] let my
[1:15:04] let my
[1:15:05] the cry of my heart let it be like that
[1:15:08] so that when the world looks they
[1:15:09] wouldn't have to question whether i love
[1:15:11] god
[1:15:12] they wouldn't have to question whether
[1:15:13] we love one another because they can
[1:15:15] hear the fabric rustle
[1:15:19] oh god may we be like that
[1:15:21] heavenly father
[1:15:23] lord jesus i
[1:15:24] i know every heart that's here this
[1:15:26] morning there's something in them
[1:15:28] or they want to be like that maybe they
[1:15:30] don't know how
[1:15:31] they don't know what to do
[1:15:33] lord i pray that you'd move into their
[1:15:35] hearts right now may the love of the
[1:15:37] holy spirit
[1:15:38] move into the hearts of the people
[1:15:40] lord that's when
[1:15:42] that's when john began to leap for joy
[1:15:44] when he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:15:46] as the scripture said in his mother's
[1:15:47] womb
[1:15:48] oh lord may we be full of the holy ghost
[1:15:52] and may our muscles begin to move
[1:15:54] lord may our arms begin to move a
[1:15:56] certain way into the direction of that
[1:15:57] your headship may our legs begin to move
[1:16:00] a certain way under direction of your
[1:16:02] headship lord
[1:16:03] may our life begin to move and begin to
[1:16:05] produce beautiful music a love song
[1:16:08] lord that to to you so that you would
[1:16:11] know
[1:16:12] lord when we're moving
[1:16:13] you would know you could hear the noise
[1:16:15] i pray you'd grant it lord
[1:16:17] i pray you'd move into each one of our
[1:16:19] lives help us to love one another with a
[1:16:22] pure heart fervently
[1:16:24] lord may there be signs of life in the
[1:16:26] pulpit lord may we put every effort that
[1:16:28] we have into it
[1:16:30] signs of life on the platform signs of
[1:16:32] life in the altar signs of life in the
[1:16:35] pew
[1:16:36] and signs of life at the fellowship hall
[1:16:38] oh lord so you could be pleased and the
[1:16:41] world would know we are your disciples
[1:16:44] not because we said we were message
[1:16:46] people or we believed in a prophet but
[1:16:48] because they saw the love that we have
[1:16:50] for one another in a time of hate and a
[1:16:52] time lord when the world is at enmity
[1:16:54] one against another in a time of cain
[1:16:57] may we be the apostles of love i pray
[1:17:00] you grant that lord we pray we ask it in
[1:17:03] jesus name
