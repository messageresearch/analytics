[44:46] seated
[44:48] when brother Branham came on the scene
[44:52] in the 1940s one of the things that the
[44:56] Pentecostals tried to do and were
[44:58] unsuccessful in doing was trying to to
[45:01] determine what gift that he had uh they
[45:04] tried to say that he had a word of
[45:06] knowledge or a word of discernment a
[45:09] gift of discernment and actually they
[45:12] they missed it it was actually a huge
[45:13] mistake on their part because they
[45:16] thought he was just another Gifted Man
[45:18] but he wasn't just another Gifted Man he
[45:21] was a prophet and not just a prophet but
[45:24] the messenger to the age and so they
[45:27] missed it because they were used to
[45:29] gifts it was an age of kiss when the
[45:31] gifts had been restored and they were
[45:34] used to these nine spiritual gifts
[45:36] working in the body and yet they did not
[45:38] see that a prophet was among them now
[45:40] there is again there's a difference
[45:42] between a prophet and the nine spiritual
[45:45] gifts and I want to make this clear
[45:48] tonight as clear as I can because my
[45:51] view of the gifts has actually been
[45:54] broadened and changed a little bit since
[45:57] I just since I started studying this and
[46:00] and I don't know if it's done you any
[46:02] good or not but for me I really and I've
[46:05] studied ahead and and I've been working
[46:09] on these things and reading things
[46:10] brother Branham said reading the
[46:12] scriptures and it really changed my
[46:15] thinking in some ways but that's what
[46:17] the word's supposed to do is that right
[46:19] we're not supposed to conform uh the
[46:22] word to our ideas of the way things are
[46:24] but we're supposed to conform our ideas
[46:28] to the word I mean believe that tonight
[46:31] so brother Branham explains to us that
[46:35] there are nine spiritual gifts and then
[46:37] there are predestined gifts
[46:40] I want to make sure I make this clear
[46:42] before I move on tonight the predestined
[46:44] gifts to the body fall on the body
[46:47] and God uses individuals in that body in
[46:50] different ways but they are not
[46:52] predestined gifts predestined to a
[46:54] particular person but they fall on the
[46:57] body they're in the body listen how
[46:59] brother Branham explains this he says
[47:01] many people gets it mixed up sometimes
[47:03] about gifts and callings he said gifts
[47:06] and callings are without repentance God
[47:07] for ordains those things and sends them
[47:10] to the Earth and then it vindicates them
[47:12] what they are he said here not long ago
[47:14] a person walked Walked to me he said
[47:17] many times they do and said thus saith
[47:19] the Lord can you imagine someone going
[47:21] up to a Vindicated prophet and saying
[47:23] thus saith the Lord I'm just that in
[47:26] itself would take some courage right but
[47:28] they didn't understand who he was
[47:30] so they said thus saith the Lord the
[47:32] Lord said do this
[47:34] he said if you didn't go to a certain
[47:36] place or a certain thing and do a
[47:38] certain thing the Lord's going to strike
[47:40] you and take this gift away from you so
[47:43] they they would come to brother Brandon
[47:44] and say you need to come to my church
[47:45] and hold a Revival and if you don't the
[47:48] Lord's going to take your gift away from
[47:49] you and so he said now that isn't true
[47:52] he said that isn't true gifts and
[47:54] callings are without repentance he said
[47:56] there is Spirits that's in the church
[47:59] he said that's true such as gifts of
[48:01] Prophecy healing and so forth but
[48:03] they're in the entire body he said they
[48:05] may fall upon one person tonight A
[48:07] Prophecy and it might not never fall on
[48:09] that person and again so you might be a
[48:11] person who says well I've never spoken
[48:13] tongues I've never prophesied I've never
[48:15] done that you know you just get real
[48:17] close to God you may never but you might
[48:20] right you might when you get close to
[48:23] God but uh you you just get in the
[48:25] spirit of that but but that's that's not
[48:28] the same as being a prophet or being a
[48:30] predestined gift to the church or being
[48:32] a minister for that matter he said it
[48:34] might not never fall on that person
[48:35] again it might be somewhere else in the
[48:38] body and those Spirits are supposed to
[48:39] be judged Brother Brad was very clear
[48:42] about this we'll get more into it when
[48:43] we get to prophecy and and the sign
[48:46] gifts tongues and interpretation
[48:49] he said let one speak and two or three
[48:51] judge said Paul he said now those are
[48:53] the spirits of the gifts that's in the
[48:54] church but the only person that has a
[48:57] right to say thus saith the Lord is a
[48:59] Vindicated Prophet right
[49:02] right to remember that someone tells you
[49:04] thus saith the Lord this and this is
[49:06] going to happen be careful because he
[49:08] said the one who has a right to say thus
[49:10] saith the Lord is a Vindicated prophet
[49:12] he said you never seen anybody judging
[49:14] Isaiah or Jeremiah or those people and
[49:16] that's why you can't be held by fear
[49:19] right if someone come to you and say if
[49:21] you reject me or you're going to die
[49:23] you're going to get in a car wreck
[49:24] you're going to have we've all heard
[49:26] that nonsense
[49:27] if you go against our church you're
[49:29] going to have all kinds of bad things
[49:31] happen to you it's nonsense
[49:33] the one who has thus saith the Lord is a
[49:35] prophet
[49:36] and and you you know you may reject my
[49:38] idea of what he said but you can't
[49:40] reject the word he brought that's what
[49:42] you don't want to reject and and so they
[49:45] brother Brandon said these prophets he
[49:47] said you never saw anybody judging
[49:48] Isaiah or Jeremiah or are those prophets
[49:51] he said they were prophets for ordained
[49:54] and born in the world to be prophets and
[49:55] they forced all the thing by a vision
[49:57] and then said thus saith the Lord for
[50:00] the Lord had already said it right
[50:03] so again brother Branham says there's
[50:05] nine spiritual gifts in the church they
[50:08] operate anywhere in the church
[50:10] he said for instance if this tent here
[50:12] tonight concealed the entire body of
[50:15] Christ so let's say this church
[50:16] concealed the entire body of Christ we
[50:18] know that's not true but if it was
[50:21] he said it might he said the Holy Spirit
[50:23] leads the body of Christ and in this
[50:26] body there's nine spiritual gifts he
[50:29] said they are here in the body Gifts of
[50:31] healing Gifts of Prophecy he said it
[50:33] might fall upon someone here tonight he
[50:35] said this lady sitting here this man or
[50:38] this man he may give a prophecy and it
[50:40] would be true but it would never work on
[50:42] him maybe again
[50:44] So when you say brother Joel might
[50:45] prophesy might prophesy something and it
[50:48] come to pass
[50:49] but it may never work on him again
[50:51] he said see that doesn't make him a
[50:53] prophet he said that makes we're in the
[50:56] body aren't you glad to be in the body
[50:58] tonight he said by one Spirit we're
[51:00] baptized in the body and subject to
[51:03] these gifts
[51:05] he said and when the body's sitting here
[51:07] remember what Paul said is something to
[51:09] be revealed to one setting by let him
[51:11] hold his peace and so forth like that he
[51:13] said that's the apostolic church that's
[51:15] where it should be now he said and here
[51:17] might be one tonight with a prayer of
[51:19] faith that would pray a prayer of faith
[51:20] that would heal someone that gift of
[51:22] healing might be on them tonight you see
[51:25] why it's so important for us to be a
[51:26] part of the body and to be in the house
[51:28] of God and to be together you realize
[51:30] why Satan fights that so much because
[51:33] those gifts operate in the body
[51:36] and you might have you might be the one
[51:38] that has a prayer a gift of faith
[51:40] tonight
[51:42] that would be able I may not have it you
[51:45] might have it you might have that gift
[51:47] of faith or that gift of healing he said
[51:49] it might be on them tonight he said it
[51:51] might be on this lady here tomorrow
[51:52] night upon this man over here the next
[51:54] night he might come back to her he said
[51:56] it's in the church the body
[51:58] he said now these are the nine spiritual
[52:00] gifts that's in the body now he said
[52:02] they work through the body but then
[52:04] there is gifts and callings without
[52:05] repentance see you see the difference
[52:07] tonight so one is is a gift or something
[52:11] that falls on you it's something that
[52:13] that you're enabled to do by the Holy
[52:15] Spirit but another is a calling or an
[52:18] office gift he always taught this on on
[52:21] down to the end of his ministry in 1962
[52:24] he said now there's he said there's nine
[52:26] spiritual gifts that goes in each local
[52:27] body which is tongues interpretation of
[52:29] tongues prophecies and so forth he said
[52:31] but there's five predestinated offices
[52:33] of the church Apostles prophets teachers
[52:37] pastors and evangelists he said that's
[52:39] what God Said in the church that's what
[52:42] God Said in the church
[52:43] he said the Holy Spirit that's an office
[52:45] yes
[52:46] yes he said the Holy Spirit might fall
[52:48] in one tonight and speak in tongues and
[52:50] the other give the prophecy and so forth
[52:52] and then next night it might be on
[52:54] somebody else and somebody else like
[52:56] that he said that's local gifts in the
[52:58] body to keep us straight he said but in
[53:00] the church alone five offices Apostles
[53:03] means missionaries Apostles prophets
[53:05] teachers pastors and evangelists God
[53:08] sets those in the church so we know both
[53:10] kinds of gifts are from God remember
[53:12] what we read I think was last week every
[53:14] good gift comes from God
[53:16] right but and both fall on the just and
[53:19] the unjust
[53:20] right you could have a a person with a
[53:23] predestined office that wasn't a
[53:25] predestined person yes
[53:28] yes right they could have a calling a
[53:30] real Calling
[53:31] to be a preacher or to be even a prophet
[53:35] but they wouldn't be the prophet to the
[53:37] age
[53:38] you understand because the prophet to
[53:40] the age you cannot you can't have a
[53:41] prophet to the age that falls
[53:44] does that make sense because the very
[53:46] fact of his ministry we can look back
[53:47] and prove that it was what God said it
[53:50] would be
[53:51] but yet he's human being but he was
[53:53] predestined to a certain place and to
[53:55] finish his work but now you could be a
[53:57] pastor an evangelist or a prophet or an
[53:59] apostle or a teacher and you could you
[54:01] could fall from that position but you'd
[54:04] still have the gift but that's different
[54:06] from a spiritual gift another is a gift
[54:08] that falls in the body now again there's
[54:11] another difference between that and
[54:14] natural Talent
[54:16] right some people can just sing
[54:20] right God gave them that gift but it's
[54:23] not necessarily a spiritual gift that
[54:24] works in the body
[54:26] right or else it'd have to be judged
[54:28] should we sure would hate to have our
[54:29] singing judged
[54:32] right it would be prophecy or something
[54:34] like that the nine spiritual gifts had
[54:36] to be judged but you might have a
[54:38] singing gift you might have a gift to
[54:40] help you might have a gift of some other
[54:42] kind so those those are gifts that come
[54:44] from God but it's things that God has
[54:46] enabled you to do
[54:48] right so when we look at a word of
[54:50] knowledge let's look at that tonight for
[54:51] just a few moments now the word
[54:53] knowledge is gnosis which is in the
[54:56] Greek is something it's cognitive
[54:58] knowledge or understanding
[55:00] understanding Mary uses this word when
[55:03] she sings about Jesus when she's
[55:06] pregnant with with Christ and she sings
[55:09] this he said she speaks of him to give
[55:11] knowledge of Salvation unto his people
[55:14] by the remission of their sins so Jesus
[55:17] was to bring a kind of knowledge or an
[55:20] understanding that they didn't have
[55:22] before so that's what this kind of
[55:24] knowledge is now Jesus in Luke 11 52
[55:27] accuses the Pharisees of taking away
[55:30] this kind of knowledge and the key to it
[55:33] he says woe unto you lawyers for you
[55:35] have taken away the key of knowledge you
[55:37] entered not in yourselves and them that
[55:40] we're entering in you hindered so they
[55:43] were they were wanting to come into the
[55:45] revelation of the day they were wanting
[55:47] to understand the word of the hour and
[55:49] the Pharisees were standing there
[55:51] locking them out of it by their
[55:53] traditions and their crates can't you
[55:55] see that same thing happening today
[55:58] right in the denominational Realms and
[56:00] even in message Realms now so we find in
[56:04] this age we have an understanding how
[56:06] many believe that tonight we have an
[56:08] understanding that many people don't
[56:09] have
[56:11] and it doesn't it's not to make us to to
[56:13] uh to Puff us up we'll get to that in a
[56:15] moment that's not what it's for but it's
[56:18] for a reason we've got to have knowledge
[56:20] we have to have faith and then we have
[56:22] to add to our faith knowledge and so we
[56:25] must have Godly knowledge understanding
[56:27] is essential now what you don't
[56:30] understand you still need to believe
[56:34] right if you don't understand it you
[56:37] believe it if it's the word of God yeah
[56:39] but you want to understand it
[56:42] I don't say this a true Eagle
[56:44] understands the things that need to be
[56:47] understood
[56:48] right they may not understand all the
[56:50] ins and outs and and the where forests
[56:52] and all the different things they may
[56:53] not understand all the technicalities
[56:55] but that's not the kind of understanding
[56:56] we're talking about we're talking about
[56:58] Godly knowledge they understand the
[57:00] things that they need to understand
[57:02] brother Branham teaches us that he goes
[57:05] he takes that from John chapter 5 and
[57:07] verse 24. you'll have to excuse me
[57:09] tonight I'm I'm fighting through my
[57:11] voice tonight so and it's not it's not
[57:14] really from preaching too much it's just
[57:15] from the uh from the trees and things
[57:18] and the pollen that's out there so oh
[57:20] just forgive me tonight John 5 24 verily
[57:23] verily I say unto you he that heareth my
[57:26] word and believeth on him that sent me
[57:28] hath everlasting life and shall not come
[57:31] into condemnation but is passed from
[57:33] death into life now a Baptist person
[57:35] would say well if you if you hear the
[57:37] word
[57:38] then that's it
[57:40] right but brother Brown takes that and
[57:43] he uses the original Greek which is
[57:45] actually uh the original Greek is to
[57:47] understand it's more than just to hear
[57:50] but it's actually and it with an
[57:53] emphasis on the accurate understanding
[57:55] of what is spoken he said now to prove
[57:59] that's right he says I go down here
[58:00] here's a drunk coming along the street
[58:01] with some other man's wife on his arms
[58:03] and cussing and taking God's name in
[58:05] vain everything else like that and said
[58:07] say did you hear what that preacher said
[58:09] did you yeah I heard it he said that
[58:11] don't mean he's got eternal life
[58:13] this stuff today well if you hear the
[58:15] tapes here you've got it I don't give
[58:17] you eternal life hearing a certain
[58:20] preacher doesn't give you eternal life
[58:22] but he that understandeth my word he
[58:25] that is an eagle amen he is an eagle
[58:29] Hallelujah now we we need knowledge we
[58:33] need understanding and yet even
[58:35] Knowledge from God can be used wrong
[58:39] knowledge even from God can be used in
[58:43] the wrong way now in First Corinthians
[58:45] chapter 8 and verse 1 we find the
[58:47] Corinthians had knowledge and they were
[58:49] actually it caused them to be puffed up
[58:52] in their minds they begin to be uh
[58:55] instead of it causing them to love their
[58:58] neighbor more it actually caused them to
[59:00] uh cause Strife because of their
[59:02] knowledge he said he's speaking about
[59:04] things offered to Idols meat that's
[59:05] offered to Idols he said we know that we
[59:07] all have knowledge
[59:08] he said but knowledge puffeth up but
[59:11] charity edifies
[59:13] so even knowledge has to be guarded by
[59:15] love
[59:17] hey man all of the gifts do by the way
[59:20] all of the gifts have to be operated by
[59:22] love even the ministry gifts have to be
[59:25] operated by love he said speak the truth
[59:27] in love
[59:28] Lord help us tonight
[59:30] so knowledge has to be constrained by
[59:33] love now and he goes on and says are you
[59:36] going to let your your weak brother
[59:38] perish
[59:39] because of your knowledge
[59:41] through your knowledge well your weak
[59:43] brother perish because you just insist
[59:46] on doing things you know they're the
[59:48] right things to do but you offend
[59:49] somebody
[59:51] so knowledge got to be constrained by
[59:52] love Paul says in First Corinthians 13 2
[59:55] though I have the gift of Prophecy and I
[59:57] understand all Mysteries and all
[59:59] knowledge wouldn't that be nice
[1:00:01] wouldn't it be nice to understand all
[1:00:03] Mysteries whether JT all knowledge and
[1:00:05] though I have all Faith so that I could
[1:00:08] remove mountains and have not love I am
[1:00:11] nothing right
[1:00:13] brother said love God's love he said
[1:00:15] it'll take the place of speaking in
[1:00:17] tongues and that's all right in other
[1:00:18] words it's all right to speak in tongues
[1:00:20] he said but love he said we'll take that
[1:00:21] place it'll take the place of gifts and
[1:00:23] wonders and signs and everything else he
[1:00:25] said if you haven't got love to
[1:00:27] accompany that what good does the signs
[1:00:29] do he said the greatest of all the gifts
[1:00:31] is wisdom the second is knowledge he
[1:00:34] said but we've gone after gifts we've
[1:00:35] gone after this we've gone after that
[1:00:37] because the supernatural was done but
[1:00:39] brother don't seek gifts he said don't
[1:00:41] seek favor with the nomination seek the
[1:00:44] love of God or could we do that tonight
[1:00:46] seek the love of God that's what we need
[1:00:48] to seek
[1:00:51] now the word of knowledge
[1:00:54] is not again it's a gift for the
[1:00:56] edification of the body
[1:00:58] understand that tonight is it's not you
[1:01:00] understanding something although
[1:01:02] knowledge Godly knowledge could be that
[1:01:04] you understanding something
[1:01:06] but the gift the word of knowledge is
[1:01:09] is you it's basically making someone
[1:01:11] understand something they didn't
[1:01:13] understand even if you didn't understand
[1:01:15] it yourself
[1:01:17] right that's the way that gift would
[1:01:19] operate
[1:01:21] and it would operate it would always
[1:01:22] operate within boundaries
[1:01:25] and and we'll get to that in a moment
[1:01:26] because there's any of these gifts if
[1:01:28] you take if you take a gift of Prophecy
[1:01:31] it operates within certain boundaries
[1:01:33] you take a gift of tongues it operates
[1:01:35] within certain boundaries because you
[1:01:37] are your office you say uh you're a
[1:01:41] housewife well you're you're a housewife
[1:01:42] that that's your office in God you're
[1:01:44] you're a wife you're uh you're uh you
[1:01:47] were called by God to be that that's a
[1:01:49] high position
[1:01:50] that's a great position in the day and
[1:01:53] age that we live in
[1:01:54] but but you're not called to stand up
[1:01:55] here and preach the word
[1:01:57] right so your word of knowledge would be
[1:01:59] limited by what you are
[1:02:02] right we're a person a preacher with a
[1:02:04] word of knowledge could would do much
[1:02:07] more with that than someone else would
[1:02:09] so it's always going to stay at the
[1:02:11] Spirit of the prophets always going to
[1:02:13] be subject to the prophets it's always
[1:02:15] going to stay within its boundaries
[1:02:18] light of Who You Are
[1:02:20] so that's why Paul says let the older
[1:02:22] women teach the younger women right
[1:02:24] there's a place for them to give
[1:02:25] knowledge to somebody but it's not in
[1:02:28] the in the house of God
[1:02:30] are you with me now I know that's not
[1:02:32] popular today but it's the truth
[1:02:35] and so now uh brother Brown says this he
[1:02:38] says he speaks of how the word of
[1:02:40] knowledge operated within his own
[1:02:42] Ministry he said when you receive the
[1:02:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that
[1:02:46] is the completion of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:48] taking up its Abode in you to manifest
[1:02:51] gifts speaking with tongues
[1:02:54] interpretation of tongues Gifts of power
[1:02:55] wisdom knowledge understanding he said
[1:02:58] the man said last night said where did
[1:03:00] you get your education for these things
[1:03:01] he said well said I've come out of great
[1:03:04] seminaries we've never had such as that
[1:03:05] ever taught in a seminary I ever heard I
[1:03:08] said it don't come from Seminary I said
[1:03:11] I'm poor with a seventh grade education
[1:03:13] he said 10 15 years ago I couldn't
[1:03:15] hardly write my own name he said I can't
[1:03:17] do much better today but it comes
[1:03:19] through inspiration I said then watch it
[1:03:21] now remember first of all he's a prophet
[1:03:23] yeah right he's a prophet so that that's
[1:03:27] Works differently with him than it would
[1:03:28] with you or I but it kind of gives you
[1:03:30] an insight into how it works he said why
[1:03:32] he said he said you never watch where
[1:03:34] you're going in the Bible he said you
[1:03:36] just grab the thing and run all through
[1:03:38] the Bible and and said it just all comes
[1:03:40] right together I said an hour after I
[1:03:43] get out of the pool but I couldn't tell
[1:03:44] you what I said right see it's not me I
[1:03:48] don't know he said see it's him putting
[1:03:50] it together yeah he said I don't know
[1:03:52] see I can't tell you now that gift there
[1:03:54] was brother Branham always there was
[1:03:56] things that he would say even before the
[1:03:58] opening of the word and this great
[1:04:00] Revelation that we have at the in 1963
[1:04:03] at the opening of the seals but you go
[1:04:05] back to 1947 brother random preaches the
[1:04:07] deity of Jesus Christ
[1:04:09] and preaches baptism in Jesus name and
[1:04:12] Divine Healing and things that the
[1:04:13] people he was years decades before his
[1:04:16] time
[1:04:18] right and people didn't even understand
[1:04:19] it but he didn't even understand it
[1:04:21] himself
[1:04:22] until later
[1:04:24] right much of it he didn't understand
[1:04:27] himself he said it's not me doing that
[1:04:28] he said it's him putting it together he
[1:04:30] said I don't know see I can't tell you
[1:04:32] he said I just get up here and something
[1:04:33] strikes me and I just know the
[1:04:36] scriptures like that he said you might
[1:04:37] ask me the scripture an hour later I
[1:04:39] wouldn't know but it just comes like
[1:04:41] that he said you watch and see if it's
[1:04:43] right or wrong once
[1:04:44] he Compares that to the discernment line
[1:04:46] how it's never wrong he said I haven't
[1:04:48] got anything to do with it he said I
[1:04:50] just yield myself to the Holy Spirit and
[1:04:52] he does the talking he said there's the
[1:04:54] whole thing he said so it isn't I it's
[1:04:57] not me he said if you judge that he said
[1:04:59] if you judge that I have the Holy Spirit
[1:05:01] then it's the Holy Spirit if you judge
[1:05:03] that it isn't the Holy Spirit you might
[1:05:04] think it was the devil but the thing of
[1:05:06] it is now watch where he takes it now
[1:05:08] this is where every gift has to come to
[1:05:11] he said compare it with this and see
[1:05:14] what it Compares with
[1:05:16] he said the Holy Spirit wrote this yes
[1:05:19] yes so if it Compares with that and
[1:05:21] brings that out truth
[1:05:24] then it must be of God
[1:05:26] right so these gifts let me say this
[1:05:29] these gifts do not operate out of fear
[1:05:32] neither do the ministry gifts right you
[1:05:35] don't operate these gifts as a way of
[1:05:37] holding fear over people we have the
[1:05:39] gifts and others don't or I have a gift
[1:05:41] and you don't see you better listen to
[1:05:42] me
[1:05:43] not even the gift of a pastor that's not
[1:05:45] what it's about
[1:05:47] right it's not out of fear but the gift
[1:05:49] because you have the Holy Ghost you know
[1:05:53] whether to accept or reject it you don't
[1:05:55] have to be afraid of tongues you don't
[1:05:57] have to be afraid of Prophecy you don't
[1:05:59] have to be afraid of a word of knowledge
[1:06:01] you don't have to be afraid of a
[1:06:02] Preacher standing in the Pulpit you're
[1:06:04] the Bride of Jesus Christ number one you
[1:06:06] can't be deceived
[1:06:08] right because you're the bride so you
[1:06:10] don't have to be afraid of that you can
[1:06:12] tell right from wrong
[1:06:15] I can't well first of all you need to be
[1:06:18] baptized with the Holy Ghost to
[1:06:19] re-baptize with the Holy Ghost because
[1:06:21] he's the one who leads you into all
[1:06:22] truth and then if you've been baptized
[1:06:24] with the Holy Spirit and you have the
[1:06:26] token on the inside of you then what you
[1:06:28] need to do is study the word find out if
[1:06:31] it's right or not study the scriptures
[1:06:33] and see whether these things are true
[1:06:36] you can do that yes
[1:06:38] every one of us can do that we ought to
[1:06:40] be studying the message
[1:06:42] this message has value
[1:06:45] it's not a second Earth it's not
[1:06:46] Spurgeon Spurgeon has value but that's
[1:06:49] not what this message is right
[1:06:51] right these other things these men have
[1:06:53] value but they're not what this message
[1:06:54] is this message is the message of the
[1:06:57] hour
[1:06:58] given for our day we need to get into it
[1:07:01] we shouldn't be afraid of that right say
[1:07:04] well if my pastor Don't Preach it I
[1:07:05] don't know if I can believe it you can
[1:07:06] believe it if God said it
[1:07:08] [Applause]
[1:07:10] right right
[1:07:11] so now
[1:07:13] again this would be done decently in an
[1:07:15] order according to the office that you
[1:07:18] have in the church or the office that
[1:07:20] you have at home
[1:07:21] or the office of Who You Are
[1:07:24] so what is Godly knowledge so let's look
[1:07:27] at that for just a moment as distinct
[1:07:29] from worldly knowledge
[1:07:31] this knowledge is a part of the divine
[1:07:33] nature it's distinct from worldly
[1:07:35] knowledge because we know that comes
[1:07:36] from Satan that's the knowledge that the
[1:07:39] serpent gave to Eve
[1:07:41] if you go to Second Peter chapter one he
[1:07:43] talks about knowledge
[1:07:44] he talks about knowledge actually
[1:07:46] several times in second Peter chapter
[1:07:48] one he said Grace and peace multiplied
[1:07:51] unto you through the knowledge of God
[1:07:53] and of Jesus our lord so here he's
[1:07:55] speaking of knowledge and it must be
[1:07:57] Godly knowledge because it's not the
[1:07:58] knowledge that is against faith he said
[1:08:02] and the knowledge of God of Jesus our
[1:08:03] lord verse 3 according is his divine
[1:08:06] power is given unto us all things that
[1:08:07] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:08:10] the knowledge of him that has called us
[1:08:12] to glory and virtue so here and he said
[1:08:15] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:08:17] great and precious promises that by
[1:08:19] these you may be partakers of the divine
[1:08:21] nature so knowledge the knowledge of God
[1:08:23] or the understanding of God comes from
[1:08:25] the divine nature of God himself he said
[1:08:28] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:08:30] the world through lust he said beside
[1:08:32] this giving all diligence add to your
[1:08:33] faith virtue virtue knowledge so that's
[1:08:37] one of the steps on the pyramid that
[1:08:38] brother Branham talked about that we
[1:08:40] we're constantly adding these things now
[1:08:43] he said knowledge he said now he said
[1:08:46] that don't mean worldly knowledge he
[1:08:49] said because that's foolishness to God
[1:08:50] right but knowledge to judge
[1:08:54] Now watch how he takes this to judge
[1:08:56] right from wrong
[1:08:57] he said how do you judge it then he said
[1:09:00] if you've got Christian knowledge with
[1:09:02] your virtue and Faith you judge whether
[1:09:04] the word is right or wrong
[1:09:07] and if you can lay aside all your Creeds
[1:09:09] and all your unbelief everything that
[1:09:12] you claim that you have done he said
[1:09:14] then you have knowledge to believe that
[1:09:17] God cannot lie
[1:09:19] let every man's word be alive but mine
[1:09:22] be true
[1:09:23] that's a powerful quote
[1:09:25] if you can lay aside what you claim
[1:09:28] you've done yeah
[1:09:31] but it's a lie compared to the word
[1:09:36] right let my word be alive
[1:09:38] and God's word be true that's knowledge
[1:09:42] all right what is it it's knowledge and
[1:09:44] I condense these things these are the
[1:09:46] things that brother Branham said but I
[1:09:47] condensed it uh just so that if you're
[1:09:49] writing it down you can see it this
[1:09:51] actual quotes that brother Brown uses he
[1:09:53] said his knowledge and this is from the
[1:09:55] statue of a perfect man
[1:09:57] knowledge of what knowledge that what
[1:09:59] God Said God is able to perform
[1:10:03] hey man how many have that kind of
[1:10:05] knowledge tonight that is the knowledge
[1:10:07] that we're talking about so a word of
[1:10:10] knowledge would be somehow
[1:10:11] supernaturally God falling among the
[1:10:13] body and and conveying that to somebody
[1:10:16] else that that what God Said God is able
[1:10:19] to perform and he uses the type of
[1:10:21] Abraham Abraham had knowledge of God he
[1:10:24] knew that God God told him he'd have a
[1:10:26] child it was 25 years later he still
[1:10:29] believed it in fact his faith increased
[1:10:31] it didn't decrease that's true Godly
[1:10:33] knowledge
[1:10:34] right so again he says knowledge that
[1:10:38] the Bible
[1:10:39] doesn't contradict itself
[1:10:42] that's Godly knowledge
[1:10:45] right so the God said God was able to
[1:10:48] perform
[1:10:49] and the the Bible doesn't contradict
[1:10:52] itself and he uses the example of
[1:10:53] Matthew 28 19 and Acts 2 38 somebody can
[1:10:57] come to you and say well I got all kinds
[1:10:59] of knowledge
[1:11:00] but the scripture is all messed up
[1:11:02] the scripture doesn't make sense I
[1:11:05] believe this instead of the scripture
[1:11:06] they don't have Godly knowledge
[1:11:09] right that knowledge didn't come from
[1:11:11] God
[1:11:12] he said but when you can see that the
[1:11:14] scripture is not contradictory
[1:11:17] that you can say that and concede that
[1:11:20] by the revelation of God the whole word
[1:11:22] is wrote in Mysteries and only the
[1:11:25] knowledge of God can reveal it I'm so
[1:11:27] glad for the knowledge of God in our day
[1:11:29] he said then when you get and say
[1:11:31] punctuate every word of God with an amen
[1:11:33] he said then add that to your faith yeah
[1:11:36] yeah so he's saying make sure the
[1:11:37] knowledge that you're adding it's not
[1:11:39] the knowledge that YouTube will give you
[1:11:42] or some other thing some other platform
[1:11:44] where you've learned to doubt the word
[1:11:46] of God but it's the knowledge that
[1:11:49] confirms the word of God
[1:11:52] right so now you said add that to your
[1:11:55] faith again he says it's knowledge to
[1:11:59] judge whether I should be born again or
[1:12:02] join a church
[1:12:05] I think we all should know the answer to
[1:12:07] that one
[1:12:08] should I be born again or join a church
[1:12:10] you must be born again
[1:12:13] it's what this Bible knowledge tells you
[1:12:16] right knowledge that the days of
[1:12:18] Miracles is not past
[1:12:22] glory to God oh that's the knowledge
[1:12:24] that we have to have when we're talking
[1:12:26] even about these gifts and other things
[1:12:28] we have to have knowledge that that the
[1:12:30] days of Miracles has not passed he he
[1:12:32] said now he said next thing the preacher
[1:12:34] will tell you and many people say these
[1:12:36] things that you read in the Bible they
[1:12:37] were for another day he said now I'll
[1:12:39] tell you why he said because we don't
[1:12:41] need those things today he's quoting the
[1:12:42] the preacher that would say that he said
[1:12:44] we don't need it see we shouldn't we
[1:12:46] don't have to practice those things
[1:12:47] Divine Healing we don't we don't
[1:12:49] practice we don't practice speaking with
[1:12:51] tongues in the church to keep our church
[1:12:53] straight we don't do this
[1:12:54] now remember there's boundaries to that
[1:12:56] we're going to get to that for too long
[1:12:58] but but he said we don't practice that
[1:13:00] that's that's the knowledge of the world
[1:13:01] yeah he said I don't know we shouldn't
[1:13:03] do that today only thing I think we
[1:13:05] should do we should learn to speak
[1:13:06] properly before the crowd we should go
[1:13:09] let a psychiatrist test our mind to see
[1:13:11] if we're able to be able to present
[1:13:12] ourselves if our IQ it's high enough to
[1:13:14] do it and so forth like that he said and
[1:13:16] we hold the greatest congregations we
[1:13:18] build our organization
[1:13:19] he said Christ never sent me to build
[1:13:21] organization Christ sent me to build
[1:13:24] individuals to the stature of Jesus
[1:13:25] Christ that they might be the PowerHouse
[1:13:27] in the dwelling place of the Spirit by
[1:13:29] his word
[1:13:31] that's Godly knowledge
[1:13:33] right but this other knowledge fee it'll
[1:13:35] it'll tell you that the Bible's not the
[1:13:38] same that God's Not the Same he said he
[1:13:42] said by uh he said by his word build up
[1:13:44] the individual to that place not build
[1:13:46] an organization to a greater
[1:13:48] denomination but build the individual to
[1:13:51] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:53] he said now when they begin to say well
[1:13:56] we don't have to accept that today he
[1:13:57] said you do have to yes
[1:14:00] right so wherever you're getting that
[1:14:02] Knowledge from you need to quit
[1:14:03] listening to the serpent
[1:14:06] because that's where that knowledge
[1:14:07] comes from that knowledge that tells you
[1:14:10] you're not going to make it right that
[1:14:12] understanding that tells you that you're
[1:14:14] you're not good enough you're you're you
[1:14:16] you don't qualify to be in the bride
[1:14:17] where does that come from
[1:14:20] comes from Satan yeah
[1:14:23] yeah and knowledge and accept the
[1:14:24] knowledge of God that sit by his stripes
[1:14:27] I'm Healed by I'm saved by the blood of
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ I am redeemed I'm going to
[1:14:32] heaven I'm going to make it
[1:14:34] it's the knowledge of God he says well
[1:14:37] you can't be saved you you're past the
[1:14:39] age of Salvation you need to accept the
[1:14:41] knowledge of God not the knowledge of
[1:14:43] man we're past the age of preachers
[1:14:46] that's the knowledge of man yeah well
[1:14:48] how can you say that but how can how can
[1:14:50] you say that definitively because a word
[1:14:52] Prophet came and said he was the same
[1:14:55] yesterday today and forever even and he
[1:14:57] said these were predestined gifts in the
[1:14:59] body I have to believe that
[1:15:01] that's the knowledge of God
[1:15:04] and anything else is a knowledge of man
[1:15:07] right but we can take that and apply it
[1:15:09] to every area of our life
[1:15:11] quit taking the knowledge of man yeah
[1:15:13] yeah you say well people today say well
[1:15:16] we shouldn't correct our children
[1:15:19] well what does the knowledge of God say
[1:15:22] all right
[1:15:24] people today say we we have to do
[1:15:26] certain things the world will tell you
[1:15:28] today I'll just go get a divorce
[1:15:30] just get it over with what does the
[1:15:32] knowledge of God say
[1:15:34] how we should treat one another the
[1:15:36] world will say the world will say do
[1:15:38] what's best for you
[1:15:39] huh dude whatever business deal you want
[1:15:41] to do do what's best for you but the
[1:15:43] knowledge of God says love your enemies
[1:15:46] I love them that despitefully use you
[1:15:49] love them more the more they use you
[1:15:51] that's the more that you love them
[1:15:53] that's the knowledge of God
[1:15:56] the knowledge of the world will tell you
[1:15:58] well uh you know I I got this feeling
[1:16:00] against somebody I'll just stay away
[1:16:02] from them but the knowledge of God has
[1:16:04] brotherly love in it and you'll go take
[1:16:06] care of that
[1:16:08] that's all that's that's hard isn't it
[1:16:10] but that we want the knowledge of God
[1:16:13] brother says the scriptures cannot lie
[1:16:17] oh my and they are no private
[1:16:19] interpretation the Bible said you just
[1:16:22] believe it the way it's written there he
[1:16:24] said you've got to have these things and
[1:16:27] the only way you'll ever be able to have
[1:16:28] them is to have heaven born knowledge
[1:16:30] and heaven born knowledge will vindicate
[1:16:33] the word
[1:16:34] hey man he said I believe in genuine
[1:16:37] Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost
[1:16:39] knowledge will always someone say always
[1:16:41] will always punctuate the word with amen
[1:16:45] it might hurt me but amen it might feel
[1:16:48] bad but amen it might it might not fit
[1:16:51] with my preconceived notion but amen
[1:16:53] anyway
[1:16:54] amen thank the Lord he said when you get
[1:16:58] these things that seem to contradict
[1:16:59] themselves in the Bible he said you sit
[1:17:02] down and study it he said and
[1:17:04] prayerfully like that and the first
[1:17:06] thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:17:08] move in he said after a while you see it
[1:17:10] ties together and there you got it how
[1:17:12] many have ever experienced that where
[1:17:14] you sat down with the Bible and you
[1:17:16] prayerfully you're not rejecting it but
[1:17:18] you want to know and the holy spirit
[1:17:20] gives you knowledge he said the Holy
[1:17:22] Spirit begins to move in after a while
[1:17:24] you see it ties together and there you
[1:17:25] got it that's knowledge he said
[1:17:28] knowledge not worldly it reasons
[1:17:31] any kind of worldly knowledge reasons
[1:17:34] but faith has no reasoning
[1:17:37] he said well I got this person that I
[1:17:39] follow this psychiatrist or the
[1:17:41] psychologist that's fine as long as they
[1:17:43] have the knowledge of the word
[1:17:46] right but if it's the knowledge against
[1:17:47] the word don't follow it don't listen to
[1:17:49] it
[1:17:50] you say I've got this I've got this uh
[1:17:53] this family member they they always can
[1:17:55] they always help me and that's good it's
[1:17:57] good to take advice from people
[1:17:59] because so many people won't but don't
[1:18:02] take advice against the knowledge of the
[1:18:03] word
[1:18:04] right the blog that you read
[1:18:07] right about how to raise your family
[1:18:09] that's good that could be good as long
[1:18:11] as it's with the knowledge of the word
[1:18:13] but if it's against the knowledge of the
[1:18:15] word cast it down
[1:18:17] brother Brown says faith has no
[1:18:19] reasoning he said God reveals to you a
[1:18:21] certain certain thing is going to happen
[1:18:22] he said every scientist in the world
[1:18:25] could tell you it's contrary it could
[1:18:27] not happen you believe it anyhow
[1:18:30] isn't that what he's asked us to do with
[1:18:31] the Rapture every scientist in the world
[1:18:34] would tell you you're nuts
[1:18:36] every side
[1:18:37] belief for a change of the body
[1:18:39] shouldn't we be able to believe for
[1:18:40] these little things that we face every
[1:18:42] day shouldn't we be able to believe for
[1:18:44] our children if we believe that one day
[1:18:46] Brother David we're going to walk into a
[1:18:48] new body we believe we're going to see
[1:18:49] our loved one science would tell you
[1:18:51] you're crazy but we believe that why
[1:18:53] because of the knowledge of the word
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:59] we need to have enough respect for the
[1:19:01] word to believe it
[1:19:04] I realize brother Branham was a man but
[1:19:06] when brother Brown talks about there
[1:19:07] will be a sweep go over you it's been
[1:19:09] all at once you'll see your loved ones
[1:19:11] walk in
[1:19:12] I don't doubt that I believe it
[1:19:16] yeah are you with me now yeah we got to
[1:19:18] come to that place we need to believe in
[1:19:20] amen because it fits with the knowledge
[1:19:22] of the scriptures and knowledge of God
[1:19:25] he said he said knowledge you know not
[1:19:27] worldly knowledge but it's Heavenly
[1:19:29] knowledge he said in Heavenly knowledge
[1:19:30] when God is the Fountain of all
[1:19:32] knowledge and God is the word he said
[1:19:34] then if you've got Heavenly knowledge
[1:19:36] you believe the word and you reason
[1:19:37] anything by the word
[1:19:40] he said now that kind of knowledge that
[1:19:41] you learn out of some book you better
[1:19:44] throw it out in the garbage can
[1:19:47] laughs
[1:19:48] remember what Paul said he said I had to
[1:19:50] count it all done
[1:19:52] to take Christ he said I come among you
[1:19:55] he said I didn't come with the men's
[1:19:57] wisdom though he could have
[1:19:59] but he said I come preaching Christ
[1:20:00] because I didn't know anything among you
[1:20:03] but Christ and him crucified Paul what
[1:20:05] do you know I know Christ oh what that
[1:20:08] would do for the world today if we could
[1:20:10] be like that what do you know I know
[1:20:12] Jesus I know Christ's been him crucified
[1:20:15] I know there's a better way I know the
[1:20:18] word is right yeah
[1:20:19] he said if it's the kind of knowledge
[1:20:21] you learn out of some book you better
[1:20:22] throw it out in the garbage can come to
[1:20:24] this knowledge when God said he's the
[1:20:26] same yesterday today and forever Say
[1:20:29] Amen
[1:20:30] he said yes sir he said not not to The
[1:20:33] Twelve in other words just it's not
[1:20:34] limited just to the disciples it's for
[1:20:37] all when you get that kind of a faith
[1:20:39] when your faith punctuates at every bit
[1:20:41] with an amen every bit he said then you
[1:20:44] say all right
[1:20:46] he said add that to it
[1:20:49] so a word of knowledge is going to tell
[1:20:52] you Godly knowledge what does the
[1:20:53] scripture say musicians go ahead and
[1:20:55] come I'm done tonight
[1:20:57] what does the scripture say cast down
[1:20:59] imaginations
[1:21:02] huh now think about this now I've read
[1:21:04] this to you a lot but think about this
[1:21:06] now in reference to gifts
[1:21:08] and especially the gift of knowledge
[1:21:11] if you have a knowledge of something a
[1:21:13] high thing something is speaking to you
[1:21:15] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[1:21:18] of God because we know Satan is in these
[1:21:20] Realms he's the prince of the power of
[1:21:22] the air
[1:21:24] right he comes and talks to you and you
[1:21:26] may not believe that but it's the truth
[1:21:29] he comes and talks to you that's why
[1:21:31] that's how he got his Eden the way that
[1:21:32] it is
[1:21:33] because he influences people he may not
[1:21:36] speak in an audible voice but he
[1:21:38] influences he uses Hollywood he uses he
[1:21:41] uses social media he uses the preachers
[1:21:43] of this world to influence the people to
[1:21:46] influence them to negativity to
[1:21:48] influence them to Suicide to influence
[1:21:50] them to these things when you have those
[1:21:52] imaginations when you when those high
[1:21:54] things begin to exalt themselves against
[1:21:56] the knowledge of God even if it's
[1:21:57] something you thought was true cast it
[1:21:59] down
[1:22:00] he said cast down imaginations and every
[1:22:03] High thing that exalteth itself against
[1:22:06] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:22:07] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:22:11] of Christ
[1:22:13] and let me say this about the gifts it
[1:22:15] means that my gift must be governed by
[1:22:18] the word
[1:22:20] right
[1:22:22] yes it's got to be governed even as a
[1:22:23] pastor got to be governed by the word
[1:22:25] and I can't go outside the message of
[1:22:27] the hour which is the light on the word
[1:22:29] on the Bible for our day brother Brown
[1:22:31] said don't do something I can't do it
[1:22:34] because I'm going to cast down every
[1:22:35] feeling every imagination that's not the
[1:22:37] word of God
[1:22:39] oh my oh God help us to surrender to
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:43] let's bow our heads together
[1:22:47] maybe Satan has presented some kind of
[1:22:49] knowledge
[1:22:51] to say that Christ is not the same
[1:22:53] yesterday today and forever
[1:22:56] maybe that kind of knowledge Has Come
[1:22:58] Today to you
[1:22:59] why don't you cast that down and
[1:23:02] just accept the knowledge of Christ
[1:23:05] the knowledge of Christ says I'm going
[1:23:06] to make it
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:09] you don't think Satan tries to talk to
[1:23:10] me every time we have a Wednesday night
[1:23:12] service he says well you know it doesn't
[1:23:14] really matter
[1:23:16] doesn't matter what you say you don't
[1:23:17] people are just tired nothing nothing
[1:23:20] matters that's the knowledge of the
[1:23:22] world
[1:23:23] but the knowledge of God the knowledge
[1:23:25] of Christ
[1:23:26] speaks to us and said we're two or three
[1:23:28] are gathered together I am in their
[1:23:30] midst
[1:23:32] and if he's here tonight he's here to
[1:23:35] affect whatever his word says to bring
[1:23:37] it to pass to manifest
[1:23:39] you know our lives could we just accept
[1:23:41] that tonight Lord I cast down every
[1:23:44] reasoning every imagination every High
[1:23:47] thing that exalts itself against the
[1:23:49] knowledge of God
[1:23:51] let the word be knowledge to my life may
[1:23:55] I conduct myself by the knowledge of the
[1:23:56] word Heavenly Father
