I'll keep going gone amen is that your attitude this morning this evening been through some hard times but I'm not giving up amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Matthew 7 and 24. then also Luke 6 and 47 it's been an owner being here today I pray something was said this morning that was a blessing um I'll try to keep it short tonight but it's good to have brother Dylan with me he uh my wife we had a baby two weeks ago so she hasn't been traveling with me but Dylan's been my wife this weekend so is cooking ain't too very good but anyways now we've had fast food this weekend so bless his heart but Matthew 7 and 24 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise men which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that hearethy sayings of mind and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and in Luke 6 and 47 who I like about that scripture was it was the same winds the same rains there was the same pressure but two different results there was two different foundations bringing forth two different results you look at Luke 6 and 47 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he is like a man which built up built a house and and dig deep and lay the foundation upon a rock and when the floods arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock can we bow our heads this evening dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace and your mercy of love your love that you've given us father Lord as we come into your house one more time I ask that you would anoint us Lord As I Lay myself aside Lord I ask that you would speak through these lips of clay father Lord you know the needs that are in the building Lord I ask that you would speak to the heart speak to the needs father Lord we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and I'm just going to continue on what I spoke on this morning on the season of pressure but we're living in a shaky time it's a time of pressure it's coming against homes it's coming against families churches marriages young people Elders you're not immune to pressure you say people don't lose their temper right away but it's pressure upon pressure upon pressure and there finally comes an explosion and I believe that's what the devil is trying to do in this day is by pressure he's trying to get people to turn away from their faith to turn away from the things of God it's pressure coming against the church and brother Branham says see full of pressure doctors are that way nurses are that way psychiatrists are doctoring psychiatrists pressure he said something's wrong seems so strange the whole world is going some way the nervous are doctoring the nervous but you know you but you know in all of it the doctors doesn't seem to have the answer the hospital the Medics they don't have the answer because they're nervous too but there's only one that has the answer that's God he is the answer he says the nervous are Doctrine the nervous the psychiatrists are doctoring a psychiatrist pressure is getting to the people that are supposed to have the answers pressure is getting to the people that are supposed to have the solutions supposed to have the ones you're supposed to go to that you can trust they're buckling under the pressure you know brother Branham says you can walk out on the street and feel the pressure he says you can see uh you see a young man going down the road 60 miles an hour he's trying to hurry up and get home he says he gets home and supper ain't ready yet because he's home too early he says then his wife says something smart and then they get into a spat he says what is it pressure has built up and it's caused an explosion the Bible says men or men's hearts are failing them for fear what is it it's pressure there's no security in politics there there's no security in National Security but you see God has given us something in this generation in an uncertain time he's given us a security where we can found our life upon we can build our house upon a foundation and know even though it is a shaky time even though it's an uncertain time we've got some certainty brother Branham says oh we we have unrest among the Nations Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom be perplexed of time to stress between nations the sea roaring why the world seems like it's in a nervous prostration another thing our jobs our jobs are so uncertain I was talking to a young man uh just returned from the Army back in the hall come back he had no job and you don't know one day from the next whether somebody is going you're going to get up to a place of seniority and somebody steps down to keep from being retired and I find something against you and now you're on the street you've got no job you're past 25 it don't get much good to look for a job now anyways he says it's a shaky time you see you can't rely on on the stock market you can't rely upon your job you can't rely upon a wealth of currency is going up and down we got nothing to put our confidence in but God has given us something in the midst of us in the midst of uncertainty he's given us a foundation you see I believe it is the separating time the Bible talks about the farmer that was showing the the seed of Wheat and then the enemy come along and he sold the tares and the Bible says that the servants come up to the farmer and says do we go and pluck up the Terrors he says no but just in case we don't want to pluck Up the Weed as well but wait till the Harvest time whenever they're whenever they're coming forth and bringing forth fruit he says then go pluck up the tears bind them for the burning but you gather up the wheat to go into the barn and so it was a separating time brother Branham says let them they'll be filthy be filthy still let them they'll be holy be holy seal still so the seed hasn't changed but the only thing is is now they're bringing forth fruit they're bringing forth what is on the inside and so that's why we see so many people that was raised up in a message church so many people that said on a Pew but then the pressure got to them and then they turned away and started to manifest the fruit that was really on the inside you see that's what the pressure does pressure shows what is on the inside you know like I said this morning pressure will show your character character is who you are whenever you're by yourself you can wear a nice suit you can have long hair long dresses but what are you when the pressure gets to you if when you're on the jobs title or or you're home with the children you see pressure is going to bring out what is only against sign but I believe that we can live in the midst of the pressure but still bringing forth the life of Jesus Christ we don't got to bring forth the life of a hypocrite the life of a make-believer but in the midst of laodicea the most wicked day that there is there can be a virtuous life that is the living in the midst of chaos the world is looking for a living God the world is looking for a genuine savior the looking for reality and you've got what the world is looking for in in every pill that the drug addict takes he's looking for something and every drink the trunk drinks he's looking for something the woman of the whale every man that she went with she was looking for a satisfaction but one day the satisfaction come by her way and she was never the same you've got what the world is looking for in the midst of the pressure you've got what the world is looking for but we see it taking place all over preachers uh song leaders deacons all of them are turning away from them a message where we thought they were Charlotte men but they never was built upon the foundation they claimed the message as their own they claimed the prophet as their own but once it come to building upon it you see you can claim to be a message believer but if you're not building your house upon it it's not going to do you any good you know I can say if I'm building a house I can say my Foundation is right over there that's where I'm building my house but if my house is over here clearly my house ain't on the foundation that I'm claiming it to be on but in order for it to be on that Foundation I gotta build I've got to construct I've got to base everything that I'm doing on that Foundation come on somebody and in order for the message to be your foundation it's got to dictate or it's got a bigger thought pattern It's gotta might be our belief system you see I don't believe the message it's just opinions I don't believe the message is just good ideas but the message is to be the absolute to the pride of Christ what is the absolute brother Josh it's the final sayup it's the typos it's what you point back to you know uh whenever you're in a discussion and somebody brings up uh when somebody brings up a uh the Trinity you're pointing right back to scripture and they can say well I don't believe it that way but you've got an absolute that you're tied to and I believe we can tie ourselves to the word and say Satan you can bring up all the pressures that you want to bring up but I'm tied to something that is unmovable oh my your shame we're living in a day of pressure it's more than just an idea of pressure but it's a reality There's real pressure coming against the minds that's coming against bodies it's coming to get Spirits it's coming against you trying to destroy your soul but God has given us something that is anchored or so in the midst of the pressure oh my you see the word is given us right and wrong I believe this message has given us right and wrong you know brother Branham says that there's a Razor's Edge difference between rights and wrong you look at the world of the world don't know if they're boys they don't know if they're girls they don't know what they are and in the midst of confusion God has given us certainty where we can know what is right you see this the message has given us the blueprint of the word of God he's there the message has given us an insight to what was in God's mind before the foundation of the world but not only what was in God's mind but he let us know the tactics of the devil and let us know what he is doing in this day that's why the message must be the absolute because if it's not we're going to dismiss what we don't like we're going to dismiss what we don't want to hear come on somebody we're gonna start to dismiss it and start to embrace our opinions oh my you see you see how the Bible says in First Corinthians 3 and 10 according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build of their own but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for another Foundation can no man lay that which is laid and which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hey stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare him because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is he says there's only one Foundation that you can build upon but he says there's many foundations he says there's gold there there's wood there's Treasures there's good Stones you can build upon but what's going to withstand the pressure he says the fire is going to try every man's work and see what sort it is oh my so the pressure is going to try the foundation and whatever your foundation is upon is how it's going to respond to the pressure you look at First Peter 4 and 12 11 thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though something strange happened unto you so the pressure is coming and is determining what you're built upon but what I love about this is it's having an opposite effect upon the rhyme the same pressure that is causing many to backslide the same pressure that is causing many to turn away from the message is the same pressure that is that that is giving an assurance to the bride that what I'm standing upon is the truth well others are falling away I'm standing while other marriages are falling away I'm standing while other families are falling apart I'm standing the pressure is letting you know what you've got is the truth oh my the Baptists are trying but they can't do it but sure doing it come on somebody the pressure is letting you know what you've got here's the truth and if you know what you got is the truth stand upon it build upon it base your life upon him you see the Bible says whosoever Hearth these chains of mine and do with him I will liken him unto a wise man which built this house upon a rock so it goes more than just hearing it we got to put it into action oh come on now we can't just hear it but it goes from hearing it to doing it to putting it in the action that's a better get into action that's why I say the message has to be the absolute because you're never going to put it into action if it's not because if you think it's this way then you hear the message says this way oh God I think it's this way you're going to walk down another path you're going down another Direction but if you want to go in the direction that the bride is moving the message has to be your foundation but the Branham says the move is on for the Bride Watch the move on the bride it's the message of Malachi or let us removing the bride in a Direction Where The World Is Gonna Get You Ready for a tribulation the pride is getting ready for the Millennium the pride is getting ready for the marriage supper of the Lamb what is doing it the direction is based upon what you're building upon oh Hallelujah it all starts with your foundation what are your basing your house upon oh my you see brother Branham says this Moses scriptural sign he was that great prophet of God that went down there to deliver them and they recognized that they recognized the sign he was the exact scripture promise Vindicated he says Jesus was the promise of scripture Vindicated to the woman or he Jesus uh he says oh he was the interpretation Jesus was the interpretation of the scripture his own life interpreted the scripture then he says don't you see the message of the hour can be recognized Where We Are the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour we are living it is the interpretation oh my you see I got into a discussion the other day uh about the absolute and the brother says that the Bible is my absolute not the message and I agreed with him the Bible is my absolute but what is the interpretation of the Bible without the message come on now the brother brother Branham says Revelations is a book of symbols how can we understand the symbols without the interpretation of the symbols I don't believe whenever I say the message it's my absolute that I'm separating it from the Bible but we know what the Bible says because of the message come on now I don't believe in dear find brother Branham I'm not saying if he like cherry pie that's the absolute we're supposed to be eating cherry pie I don't believe that but the scripture interpretation that he brought is to be the foundation of the Bride is to build upon it is the absolute that is pushing it it is the typos oh man there's there's doctrines all over the place you see everybody has the same Bible that we are reading out of but there's thousands of the nominations there's thousands of interpretation we needed somebody to come and bring the interpretation and say there's not three Gods there's one God uh evening and even an apple it was a sex act we needed the interpretation to bring us back to the foundation oh man it is the foundation that the apostles laid is what we are building upon Hallelujah it is the foundation but the random says this and then next the message that opened up the Seven Seals which which undone all the hidden mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and so forth which the world so rudely attached nowadays attacks it and says the truth he says here the other day in Arizona splashing tapes to try to make me say things that I didn't say just remember the vision about Arizona uh the proposition the Bible says it was far better for you to have a rock at your neck and another thing whosoever let him be a preacher or what he will will take one word from it or add one word to it people putting their own interpretation upon the word as it's been given trying to make it say something that I did not say he says not my word it is his word and I say Amen to that this message was not a word from a hillbillion from Kentucky but it was the word from almighty God to the bride that she can build her life upon and go in a direction oh my we can move in a direction and know that in the midst of insanity we've got something changed that we can build upon so Jesus is saying if you take the word that I'm bringing I will build the house oh my I'm going to build the house what did what did Jesus tell Peter Upon This Rock I will build my church what is that rock it's the rocket Revelation so upon the revelation of Jesus Christ is the foundation that the bride is going to build upon and that that is just something that struck me the other day once you choose the right foundation it goes from you trying to build the house and now God is building the house how is he building it by you applying the word then the word starts to build up the house oh Hallelujah that's why this bride cannot fall because it's built up by the word that's where this bride can't be deceived because she's built up by the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus is making a personal claim not a man a man's not going to build my church the pope ain't gonna build my church the bishop ain't gonna build my church but I am going to build my church upon the revelation of who I am and he was letting Peter know this is the foundation not your Sensations not your opinions not on your emotions but this the revelation of who I am you go and you preach that because that is what I'm building my church upon oh my you look at First Corinthians 3 and 16. know you're not that ye are the temple of God and so the house the God is going to dwell in is your life you're the house that is going to come and dwell in if it's on the right foundation oh my look at Colossians 2 and 7 rooted and built up in him and established in the faith and she had been and taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving rooted and built up in him so we're not being rooted in man's ideas and man's opinions but we're established upon the saith the Lord which is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and I believe that's what we're being built in is the word of God we're being built in something solid but the Branham says well you've got the same Choice today she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride he says the woman is a part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the Bible not systems not dogmas or nothing added to it it'll have to be the unadulterated pure virgin word that's right and I say that's what we've got in this generation and what the word wasn't defiled but it was was the perfect word that was brought from the mind of God for us to build our life upon oh man you believe that this evening and I believe that we are an invincible Army that is Walking In Step you look at Ephesians 2 and 19. now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles Helm the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone we are built upon the foundation of the prophets and the apostles so that's what this message come to do is to bring us back to the foundation that the denominational systems got off of oh my you see there's no rapturing faith in the foundation of the nominations but there is rapturing Faith on the the foundation of the Apostles that's why this Bride is a marching and staff it's because she's come back to the foundation that the apostles first laid oh my look out for Psalms 127 and 1 a song of degree for Solomon except the Lord built the house they labor in vain that building so we're not wanting to just build any house but we're wanting a house the God himself is building up the God himself is constructing oh my you all hope you're following me this evening I'm trying to move fast so I so if we can dismiss fast but you look at Joshua 24 and 14 it was Joshua's proclaiming as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord and you notice he's making a statement about the promised land he wasn't wanting to build his house in the wilderness but he was wanting to build his house in the promised land Upon This Mountain upon his inheritance and that's what the attitude of the Bride has to be is I'm not building my house in the wilderness in confusion but I'm building my house upon thus saith the Lord this message is what is guiding us into our inheritance that's what I'm building my house upon the Gates of Hell May blow against your house but if you're on a solid foundation you can't be blown away hallelujah we're shining upon something solid brother random says I want to get this on God's word for after all this is the only foundation that anyone can build upon correctly God will never recognize any foundation but this word come on now remember God is building the house and the only way he will build the house if it is on the foundation of his word oh Mash I'm so glad God gave us a prophet in this generation to bring us back to the foundation so that Christ can come and dwell in the house so it matters what we're founded upon we don't want to build our families just on anything but we want to build our families on something that God is constructing you see uh I heard brother Branham say it the other day he was talking about he was in New York City and him and another brother was walking down the street and he's seen this big old building a beautiful building they said they went and shine and he says the interior was beautiful but he said there was one problem nobody was inside of it using it and he said he found one of the one of the men that was around there he went up to him and he says how come nobody's in this building how come nobody's using him and he says it's because the the Builder was so worried about the inside of him that he failed to dig the Footers deep enough and he says since the foundation ain't solid now the inside is going to start the crumble down he says that the building is starting to crumble down so nobody is wanting to dwell in the house because of the foundation and I thought my that's why many churches are they dormant that's why many families don't have the presence of God in it that's why many marriages don't have the presence of God in him because he's not going to do well in a house that is on the wrong Foundation come on somebody you might have to dig a little bit you might have to dig through man's ideas through man's opinions but if you dig deep enough you will find that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh you see man man's ideas has starting to twist up this message again but if you can push past all of man's ideas and just say what is on the tapes we are on the right foundation hey come on somebody but the Branham says God is The Interpreter of his own word so once God's interpretation comes we don't need a man's interpretation we need God's interpretation that is the foundation that God is building upon but the random says for you're not built upon the right foundation just if you're not built upon the right foundation it's just no good he says what's the use of the building of building upon a foundation that's already been condemned he says watch the goose he says what would be the use of trying to put paper in paint on an old building if the government has already condemned he says that's where many people are trying to do today by reforming they're trying to reform we'll start a church we'll turn a page we'll do something a little different than we used to do you'll never get anywhere like that it's just foolish to even try he says seeing you're only wasting your time well now if you believe that if you believe I believe I will stop quick I quit my lying and stealing all those things are good as they are you're still a million miles off of the road he says you've got to come back to the foundation you've got to build a new place not patch up the old one but build a brand new one you've got to come back Star right that's the reason you see so many faulty mistakes so many people indifferent people who profess Christianity he says that's why you see so many Hypocrites it's because they're built upon the wrong Foundation trying to build up a house but they're built on opinions they're built on ideas but God has given us a foundations here I know back home we've got many that buy old houses and fixes and fixes them up I don't know if anybody does that here but I've got an old house right my dad's go to old house I mean it's got old houses and we try to make them look good on the inside we can repaint them we can retexture them but if you don't do nothing with the foundation the pressure on the foundation is going to crack what is on the inside you see my dad has a big old tree on his front in his front yard and they're The Roots is starting to get under the foundation and even though he remodeled the inside of it the cabinets are Level the doors are level but since there's pressure upon the foundation it's starting to crack and now the inside is being affected of what is on the foundation come on now your family still look great and be great and wonderful but what about the foundation what are you built upon what are you striving upon because if it is on the wrong Foundation the pressure is going to get to the inside but if it's built upon thus saith the Lord the pressure can come against the foundation it can come against the inside but it will not prosper Hallelujah if you're built upon the right foundation no pressure let the devil send your way can't Prosper we can have families that are on fire we can have children that are on fire with the things of God but it comes to the right foundation oh my the foundation is messed up and now the doors are unlevel the cabinets are unlevel they're all uneven and that's exactly what brother Branham was talking about he says the foundation is wrong on this building and it's it's affecting the inside oh my I don't want to be a house that is unoccupied by God I want him to come and occupy my house my home my church oh my you see what destroys foundations it's Roots it's something that gets a next to the foundation and it starts to crack it it starts to make it crumble and that's where many people fall as they start to build upon a foundation but then they'll let Roots come and they file them let the root of bitterness come when he found him they left lukewarmness come and he file it the formalism come and he file it and now the roots is disrupting the foundation but if we dig deep enough not in complexes not not in bitterness but if we dig deep enough upon the foundation of the word there's no roots can disrupt us Hebrews 12 and 15 looking diligently lest any man should fall from the grace of God lest any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you thereby many be devoured he didn't stay all was defiled he says many are defiled by the root of bitterness and I'm so glad he put just many not all because in the midst of people being defiled were standing we're not being defiled by bitterness we're not being defiled by lukewarmness but we're standing against it you see that that offense that comes against your foundation must be dealt with this morning I talked about the offense that you got towards God but then there's offenses that you have toward your brother that you have to hurt your sister that you have towards the preacher towards the Deacon those are bitterness that is our roots of bitterness that is coming against your foundation but you notice that the Bible shows us how to deal with them you look at Matthew 16 and 22 then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying being far from thee Lord there shall not be unto thee so Peter turns to Jesus and rebukes him and says what he is saying is not the truth and you would think this would hurt Jesus but instead of being offended at Peter look how he deals with it the next verse in Matthew 16 and 23 but he turned and set unto Peter get thee behind me Satan Thou Art and offense unto me so he turns the offense from Peter to the pressure come on now why did Jesus share what what about the brand I'm saying God hates and loves the sinner but hates the sin he separates the sin from the end of Israel and that's what we got to do with offenses if somebody hurts you you see they got the pressure got to them I'm not offended at my brother but I'm offended at the pressure I'm offended at the devil that is trying to disrupt Unity come on somebody Jesus did again offended at Peter but he had turned that offense and got offended half the devil and I think if there's ever a time to get offended of the devil it's this time we need to turn our offense towards the devil because what happens whenever you get offended at a brother you stop talking to them you stop talking to them and I think we need to stop talking and talking to the devil we need to stop talking to the spirit of unbelief we need to stop talking to the devil that's coming and trying to disrupt your foundation what happens when you get an offense at your brother you see it you see him coming this way you turn around and you walk the other way what's the Bible say shun the very the very appearance of evil I think we need to get offended at the Devil and say you know what there may be pressure coming against me but I'm turning the other way I'm not listening to the voices of the pressure who might turn the offense from the devil from Peter to the devil oh man I think if we put the message up in front of our family let me do the offenses we will have a house on fire oh my we'll have a house on fire not on the not with the things of the world but with the things of God you know brother Branham talks about the the one time there was a church that was on fire a natural fire and that the pastor the pastors turned around and he's seen a man that he hadn't seen in a long time he'll turn around and he says my my well I haven't seen you in a long time he says well I haven't seen the church on fire in a long time either I think if we get to house this on fire with the things of God that Revival will move into the church if we get families on fire with the things of God that Revival will come into the church the pastor don't bring the Revival families bring the Revival pastors don't bring the Revival in the homes you bring the Revival come on somebody this building ain't necessarily the church you're the church you're what the Revival is remember the Welsh Revival remember they were looking for the Welsh Revival and they come up to the to the placement and they said sir where's the Welsh Revival he says you're looking at it they said no no you don't understand where's the location of the Welsh Revival he says it's right here I am the Welsh Revival he was Tabernacle the Revival Hallelujah I think it's time that we Tabernacle the bride's Revival what is the branch Revival it's a word Revival it's arrived the soul the seed that was on the inside Hallelujah this message has come to a bride that was a part of the word whenever this word come across your path there was a response to it because you're a part of it you're a part of this word no brother banham he talks about the eagle he says whenever Mama Eagle come across the Barnyard and she began to scream out the baby eagle recognized the stream and says that's who I am I'm a part of that screen and whenever he recognized that scream the word started to lift it up out of the out of uh the the Barnyard and the message would have come across your way something responded saying I pump from the word I come from the thoughts of God and you could not help but respond because you're a part of it Hallelujah are you a part of it this evening it's your origin it's who you are you see a builder don't get there by itself but a building has to have a base where it started where it was constructed upon you know I started thinking about a McDonald's didn't get worldwide by itself I was in England last year and there's a McDonald's in England in Germany there's a McDonald's you know it didn't get worldwide by accident but it had an origin it had some place where it started and now that establishment wherever it goes it may go across the seas and wherever it goes it's always pointing back to its origin come on now it looks like the same ones in the states the one in Germany looks like the ones in the states the one in England looks like the ones in the states what is it it might be in a different location but it's always pointing back to its origin oh my we might not be in heaven we might not be in the mind of God but we are in a place where we're pointing back to our origin we're on the foundation of the word and we're pointing back what we're laying hands on the sick and they're recovery we're living an undefiled life what is it our Tabernacle our house is pointing back to our origin if Pentecost have the power to speak in tongues this pride has the power to speak in tongues come on somebody if the first church laid hands on the sick the second bride will lay hands on the sick and expect miracles why we're pointing back to our origin oh mine we're producing another book about continuation of the book of Acts it's not the work doing it by yourself but we're pointing back to its origin hallelujah we're just building or a house opponent and it's producing the results oh my it's producing the results that's what I want to be I want to be a result of Christ but you see if you compromise on what you were founded upon you lose the characteristics of your origin you know brother Branham talks about America and he says and we are all American I think so in the church tonight we're all American citizens we're thankful to be American but yet what happened to our American Heritage what was it he says we begin to compromise and as soon as we compromised we lost the sacredness of our heritage because we compromised he said says we won print we run presidents four times that breaks down the Constitution we do things today to this little parking meter that we have on the street that's unconstitutional there are such such a thing and there's no such a thing in the Constitution it gets against the Constitution yet we do it and we do all kinds of things that's against the principles that this nation was founded upon he says we do everything contrary we've lost our heritage because why we compromised on the principles that we was based upon is that the definition of Heritage is a property that descends to an heir an inheritance of Birthright so America has lost its inheritance because they've compromised upon their origin oh my but this pride is not compromising but she is standing faithful upon the word and her inheritance it's something of Her Imagination but her hair inheritance she is claiming every time she steps out her bed she's claiming her inheritance she's living a life she's producing the Greater Works she's producing the life of Jesus Christ oh my Christ is inside of the house betraying his thoughts oh my you see we're not letting offenses dictate our foundation oh my you may say brother Josh I've been offended of this brother I've been offended at that brother there's a solution the Bible says in Psalms 107 and 19 then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he shaveth them out of their distresses he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh my you don't gotta stay up in that root of bitterness you don't get a stamp in my complex he has sent his word that blind you up with the right foundation you may be eating up with bitterness you might be eating up with any anxiety but God has sent his word to break up the old Foundation that sure built upon and to direct you to the true foundation where you can have joy unspeakable and I'm full of Glory you can have a peace the passive Hall understanding Hallelujah he sent his word within itself with an authority he didn't send a dead letter but he sent a word that is that has happened backing it up that is destroying every root you look at Matthew 7 and 28 and it come to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his Doctrine or at his word for he taught them as one having Authority not as the scribes did you catch that he they were astonished not at his actions but they what they were astonished at his word they said okay there's something something strange here you're saying the same things that the scribes are saying but they've got no Authority behind him but you do what made the difference he was the interpretation of the Scrolls it was the word coming off of the Scrolls and now in a body The Same Spirit the Rope the Scrolls Was the Same Spirit that was making the scroll live oh my that's what separated Jesus from the Pharisees was there was a life behind the letter and what separates you from the rest of the world we're not just reading quotes or not just reading scriptures but the word the spirit the Rope the word is living in a vessel making the word live there's a separation taking place in the midst of the pressure while the Serpent's heat is portraying the life of who they're portraying the bride is portraying the life of Jesus Christ in the midst of uncertainty the pride is standing stable upon a foundation with the life behind it you look at Matthew 8 and 8 the Centurion answered and said Lord I am now worthy that there should has come under my roof but speak the word holy and my servant shall be healed for I am a man under Authority having soldiers hunting me I say to this man go and he goeth into another come and he cometh into my servant do this and he do with him he was making a statement that Jesus you have authority but I've got Authority as well but it's not a supernatural Authority I can speak to my servants and they go I can speak to this one and they go but you've got a supernatural Authority that I don't got and this bride has a supernatural Authority that the world don't have you've got something that the world longs to have oh my look at Matthew 8 and 16 and when even when they even was come they're brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sent oh he healed the he cashed out Spirits with this word and hear all that were sick but should notice what was his ministry based upon the next verse that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet if you look to the scripture it's always saying that that it might be fulfilled about this Prophet by that Prophet his foundation was always pointing back to his origin his actions was always pointing back to the word oh come on now and that was the example of the Bride our actions is to always to point back to the word or decisions is to point back to the word well our everyday life is is to point back to the word because rebuilt upon the right song were built on the same Foundation you see brother Branham says this it can't come through a rag that drums right down and says it was in another day it was in another day it's forever the same he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and begin absolutely you have to come back to the foundation for Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against him he says God bless you friends I know you think I'm a little bit noisy and a little out of order but I am not I think I am in order with his word oh my that's a it's okay to get a little excited whenever you're built up on the right foundation he says I'm not out of out of order I've been lined with his word oh man if there's a house that is in line with this word you have a right to get excited because while the world is in chaos you're living in sanity oh come on somebody while the world don't know where they're going you've got a Direction Hallelujah you've got a right to be happy amen as the musicians come brother Branham says this so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female he was all redeemed in one body see they are one same the same word the same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the Bride well how can the Bride come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and the groom come and wouldn't be the same there wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards they don't the bride have the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she will be in these last days he says just like Christ was the Fulfillment of scripture fulfilling the word the bride is fulfilling her portion of the word he didn't see two different two different words two different individuals but he seen one he's seen the bride that was in Christ oh my God really really are saying to you John 14 and 12. he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than than these he shall do because I'm going on my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father might be glorified in the son where are these Greater Works brother random says you're not doing something greater but you're doing more he says you can't do nothing greater than him but you're doing more of just like he healed the sick the bride's got to have the Greater Works healing a sick to raise him the Dead amen let's bow our hands tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for this Foundation but you've given us Lord you've given us something that could anchor Us in the time of uncertainty as we're hearing the uncertain sounds around us Laura marching out to battle with certainty Lord we're gonna stop her thank you Lord there's millions of people in the world on the earth Lord but you chose us you placeless you place the seed on the inside of our heart father Lord
