========================================

[Music] Well, I'm singing about the different breed. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sprang up from the original seed. Chosen and elected from the beginning of time. We'll never be a chicken. We won't take the devil's licking. We're born winners. Were the eagle kind. We're an army of believers. That makes us naturalborn receivers. Hopeless thoughts and doubts and fears we've left behind. While others think of dying. All I've got on my mind is flying. I repeat, that's the nature of the eagle kind. No barnyard bruise can hold us. No chicken coop can mold us. We'll just keep on going. We'll never lie behind. We're going to keep on growing. And this bunch will do more than growing. I repeat, not the chicken worth, the eagle kind. Well, we're an army of believers. That makes us naturalborn receivers. Our hopeless thoughts, our doubts and fears. While others think of dying, all I've got on my mind is flying. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. What shall we try now? We're an army of believers that makes us naturalb born receivers. Our hopeless thoughts and doubts and fears we've left behind [Music] while others fing all I've got on my mind is flying. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. Yeah. While others think of dying, all I've got on my mind is right. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. Yeah. I repeat, that's the nature of the evil kind. mind. [Music] Hallelujah.
