but lord we know that you're still god i ask you to come and just speak to each heart we pray in jesus name amen amen do you love him today amen turn with me to second chronicles chapter 15 and verse 10 second chronicles chapter 15 and verse 10. it's good to have brother james sister sharon back with us tonight and each one of you that are here it's always good to be in the presence of the lord um sunday we'll have brother jason demars with us i didn't intend to kind of have back-to-back services like that when we had special speakers but it's just the way that it happened but but jason will be in on sunday morning just one service but he'll be telling us about the mission work and introducing himself to the church i don't believe he's been here before and he's done some wonderful things the lord has done some wonderful things in his ministry in turkey and in the middle east and so he'll be telling us about those things and then preaching the word to us as well on sunday morning amen so we're looking forward to that second chronicles chapter 15 and verse 10. so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the 15th year of the reign of asa and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought 700 oxen and 7 000 sheep and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul now they were they were getting serious about this said that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman verse 14 they swear unto the lord with a loud voice was shouting with trumpets with cornets they had a pentecostal jubilee and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him notices with their whole desire he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word this evening you may be seated waldo emerson was addressing a graduating class at harvard university one time and he said this he said young men be careful what you want for you will surely get it be careful what you want for you will surely get it someone has said i've learned that if you give a pig and a boy everything they want you'll get a good pig and a bad boy that's the problem with our democracies i want to speak to you tonight on what do you want what do you want a problem with our democracy is that people get what they want they get what they want and ultimately what we want is the wrong thing what what the world wants is the wrong thing and and i've got some pictures i think on the sides has happened today there was a headline which i thought was interesting in the new york post is why are so many women wearing purple at biden's inauguration today now i'm not going to start commenting on fashion choices though all of the former first ladies and the first lady are the vice president now of the united states wearing purple today and she was when she got swore in i want to be careful here because i don't want you to think i'm reading into things some something brother branham didn't say but i want us to know that people get what they want and we're seeing the fulfillment of that and brother branham says this and i won't spend long on this so just pay attention for just a moment we'll move on but brother brown says now i predicted and have said i saw great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in real highly royal look like purple he saw her now whatever that means he saw it he says i got a little parenthesis down here down there here she was a great ruler in the united states perhaps the catholic church he said a woman some woman i don't know it'll be the catholic church i don't know i can't say only thing i've seen i've seen the woman that was all and then and from that time and there's many quotes you can go and i read them all today just to kind of try to get a balance on this but again i don't want to read in to something that's not there but brother brother says remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her so the nation wasn't fighting it the nation bowed to her they they get what they want and we had a lot of of uh turmoil in this election about election fraud and things but not about the popular vote the popular vote went decidedly to the democrat party and i'm not republican or democrat but just to show you people get what they want it's true people get what they want the nation as a whole wanted this and this is what they've got and and though many people did not but the nation as a whole now look he said the catholic church he said is on the rise we've had one catholic president will no doubt have another this is the first time that we could stand here in the pulpit and say this has come to pass since brother branham was here that ought to make you think today is the first time that we've been able to say there's been another catholic president i think it's the mercies of god to us until now but but we're seeing it these things are speeding up these things are happening and we're getting close to time what do you want today you get what you want look he's the catholic church he said is on the rise we have had one catholic president will not have another he said what is left nothing except hebrews 12 26 whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised saying yet once more has shaken up the earth only but also heaven and he talked about the earthquakes and the things would take place brother brown said this after that 1960 election in december of that year he said now so then i said there will be in that time during that time the women will be permitted to vote and they'll elect the wrong person he said they did it on this last election that was president kennedy he said that's right which will start the stronghold something happened in 1960 in this nation that started a stronghold and people don't recognize it but it's been going on since that time the people have been getting what they want right now look and i'm making a point with this but but it's something that's happening today and and he says he says during that time during that time it'll come to pass that there'll be a great woman rise up in the united states she'll be beautifully dressed he says my god in parenthesis perhaps the catholic church see he said and he goes on he said this woman now he said that'll take rulership over the power overpower the others in the united states now think about that after what's happened in the and the contested election and all of this and you look at a president that's 78 years old and i'm not a prophet i can't stand you here and tell you thus saith the lord what will happen but i'm telling you we're living right at the end we know that and we've known that since brother branham was here but we're not seeing the beginnings of it we're not seeing in in its infancy we're seeing in its fulfillment we're seeing the very very top of it the very fruit of it very free could you imagine in 1960 one of the cabinet members i don't remember which one but one of them is is i think it's over the health department is is a transgender it's a man dressing as a woman who's been appointed to be over the the health uh of this nation and and look at that and think where have we come to they couldn't have imagined that in 1960 but what started as a stronghold there is coming out in 2021 why because people eventually get what they want what their desire is this was satan's desire was to have this and he has what he wanted he finally has his eden the way that he wanted it but i'm so glad there's a place that's been prepared for us and it's something that not satan didn't want but christ wanted for his bride there's a place and there's something inside of us that calls us to that place amen now he said so she'll take rulership over the power overpower the others in the united states and you watch what'll take place if that's if that's what's going on right now there's some things that could happen now look he said she'll be beautiful to look at but she'll be cruel-hearted as she can be he said i said then i looked again and i saw the united states just blow to pieces that's it and you can go and find over and over again brother randall says i've seen five of the seven and one place brother branham talks about how that he says not a a woman but a church he talks about the church the catholic church taking over which has also happened in this election if you think about it all the supreme court justices now all the uh and they were republican appointed and and then you have now the president himself the entire power wrapped up in the catholic church and and and then you have this woman and brother branham talks about that but he also after that and you'll find it up in the 1964 he talks about how that uh how that uh five of those visions had already come to pass he knew that five of them had come to pass i wonder tonight if we could say six of them have come to pass again i don't want to read anything into what brother branham says but look at the age we're living in we're living in the fulfillment of prophecy brother branham could look at what happened and is this the sign of the end sir and he could say when he come to what is the attraction on the mountain he said that was three years ago was prophecy now it's history where are we at church right at the end of the end at the end of the end aren't you glad to be the elect of god tonight say brother ben's what's going to happen i don't know i do know this he's coming for his bride there's going to be a body change that going to be tomorrow i don't know it could be it could be tonight it could be a hundred years from now but i know it's coming and i know these things had to happen now so brother brown said there was nothing left on it now in first samuel 2 12 13 there was an inauguration day of a new king in israel and the people got what they wanted samuel come to him they come to samuel rather than they said give us a king and samuel said we i don't want you to have a king or in other words haven't i always done things right and god led them through that prophetic ministry they said no we want a king god didn't want them to have a king at that time they said we want a king and so they come to samuel and and you know the story how that saul was chosen and on inauguration day samuel is is fulfilling the part of of the like the supreme court justice that would stand there and make him swear the oath and he stands there and he points to soul he says now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen whom you have desired and behold the lord has said a king over you in the sense that god allowed them to have it right god will give you what you want or we have to watch our desires don't we be careful what you want because you might get it the truth is you probably will get it whomever you desire and behold the king has sent or the lord has set a king over you and that kind of goes with the scripture that says i've gotten a man from the lord because god allowed it to happen all babies come from god but he was the son of perdition he was the seed of the serpent but saul was not serpent seed saul was just a man out of his place shouldn't have ever been the king but god allowed it now people almost always do what they want to do but it's the desires to want to that has to change right and that's what we have to see in this hour if there was ever a time when we should have a desire for the things of god it ought to be today there was a time when we should be able to cry out to god and this has been heavy on my heart recently even before these events of this last few days but there ever was a time for this to take place it ought to be now it ought to be today that the people of god could cry out lord come quickly that there would be such a a fervent desire to be in the presence of god and to fellowship with god and to say lord i want to come home i want to be there with you i'm tired of this whole world i'm tired of what it's becoming i'm tired of the news i'm tired of what's going on i'm ready to go there ever was a time that we ought to be on fire for goddess today and yet i see even a falling off of some of the fervor and things that we had in 2016 when people thought that hillary clinton would be the the president that would come and and take over and so they see that and this would fit the prophecy in a more direct way as far as being a catholic president of things than that does and that did but back then it seemed like people were all nervous and excited people started coming to church and doing things because they thought that was happening where's that at today even the charismatic church got involved and things you don't see that as much today why because the world is dulled people's senses we're living in an hour when people have gotten what they want and it's become just a playground satan's eating brother brown said he made it easy to sin in oh but i tell you what a true christian today and i trust that you're a true christian here on a wednesday night there's something on the inside of you you're just not happy here anymore you're ready to go home amen see the desire needs to be changed god doesn't want to take away your desires he wants to make them right it's not that we have too strong a desire that our desires many times are for the wrong things this quote of c.s lewis has always struck me and says it would seem that our lord finds our desires not too strong but too weak we are half-hearted creatures fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy has offered us he said like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea we are far too easily pleased god help us today we're far too easily pleased because we're comfortable and we've got everything that we could ever want and it's an age when when everything increases and goods increase and everything looks like it's it's a wonderful age to live in but we're far too easily pleased with those things we find in genesis 3 3 6 that eve didn't have a desire for these things but satan come and begin to talk her into it and when he reasoned with her he changed eve's desires listen it says when the woman saw the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did he and gave also unto her husband with her and he did when she saw that it was desirable and she did it what it happened there was the desire she didn't know it was there but that desire became awakened when she listened to the serpent brother random tells us that by your desire you can tell who is on the throne of your heart that's a powerful statement what do you want i sat here sunday night counseling through the afternoon with someone and sitting here and i ask them that question what do you want i've asked it before counseling what do you want what's the point of all this that you're doing and what you're going through what's the end result what do you want the person said to be happy i don't think they'd mind me saying that because we all want that we want to be happy but i told them this i said you can't be happy by trying to make yourself happy it's the worst way to make yourself happy you try to make somebody else happy and you might be happy we'll talk about that a little bit more but we find satan his desire was to make his own ministry bigger than all the others and you can look in isaiah chapter 14 and verse 12 he had this desire he says howard thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer son of the morning howarth thou cut down to the ground which just weakened the nations for thou has said in thine heart this is what you begin to want your wants are powerful things your wants are powerful things what do you want you look at young people that are about to on on the verge and they're halting between two opinions brother andrew said sunday and they're right there on the edge and they can step this way and go into the world or step this way and become a committed christian and they're right there on the edge what do you want you want to be loved by the world do you want all the pleasures and things that the world can provide or do you want a home and a family and to feel the peace of god in your life you could go either way what do you want satan's in heaven you can't blame anything on the surroundings of the church or the pastor but he's in heaven and he's sitting there and he's it says thou instead of my heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation on the sides of the north this became his overwhelming desire amen to move out of his place into a place he didn't belong he said i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit and see it wasn't given to angels to do that it wasn't given to angels to be like the most high that was given to the sons and daughters of god but here he with this fallen angel said yet thou shalt be brought down to hell the sides of the pit i've watched over the years bear with me for a moment we're kind of dwelling on the bad side we'll get to the good side in a moment but i've watched over the years many men and women destroy their families because they want something they want something and it starts out as just a minor irritation something they wish they could have or experience and then one day it becomes an overwhelming desire and they get it and they get what comes with it too proverbs 7 22 speaks to this and speaking of a man that would go after a strange woman or a bad woman he says he goes after her straightway as an ox go to the slaughter as a fool to the correction of the stalks till a dart strike through its liver look at the graphic language here as a bird he says to the snare why because he wants something he wants the what's in the trap why does the mouse get in the trap because he wants the cheese he wants it it's an overwhelming desire but he says knoweth not that is for his life amen verse 24 hearken unto me now therefore you children attended the words of my mouth let not thine heart decline to her way he's going out astray in her past for she has cast down many wounded yay many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death but i want it you're going to die with it too but people usually get what they want but they also get what comes with it the gay rights people said we want to be recognized they're recognized now as of today you can choose your pronoun when you contact the white house you can be a vey or them or or a shim or whatever else you want to be they got what they wanted but you get what comes with it amen proverbs 9 16 says whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she said to him or that lacks understanding in that case she says to him stolen waters are sweet this is the woman trying to draw him in bread eating in secret is pleasant but he knoweth not that the dead are there that are guests are in the depths of hell what do you want if you want what you've got you'll have to deal with repercussions of the fall amen you want to be enlightened do you want to know more about the world you want to know more about what's going on in the world you have to deal with the repercussions of that as i said a person might say i want to be happy but the path to happiness doesn't lay to the door of the harlot it doesn't lay through the door of denominations and doesn't lay to the door of the world but lays through gethsemane the road to happiness is through death to self amen we know that because jesus in hebrews 12 1 paul tells us that we're foreseeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight we're not trying to make ourselves happy we're trying to get rid of anything that would hinder us from the race let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him see there was happiness coming but to get there but the caleb had to go through gethsemane he had to walk the via dolorosa he had to go to the cross in order to have happiness you want to have happiness in your family make your life a self-sacrificial life you want to have happiness here in the church you want to be happy sacrifice yourself to the will of god for your life let yourself die out to the world and the things of the world and god there will be joy in front of you because of your sacrifice you see the measure of how badly you want something is taken by what you're willing to give up to get it if you desire god there's something there inside of your heart now let's look at this as a on the good side now because there's been many in the scripture that wanted god if you want something because of the love of god in your heart faith will produce the object of your desire something there love produces a want a desire for god hebrews 11 24 which we know ultimately comes from the seed that's there if you don't have a seed you just don't have that desire so it makes sense that's pretty simple if you still have a desire for god then run to god don't do it half-heartedly there's nobody more miserable than someone who tries half half the time to serve god and half the time to serve the world run to the word of god run like the the deer that's thirsty as brother brandon preaches that very similar message where he talks about thirst run like the deer that is wounded and has to get to water shall die run to the water amen if you desire god run to the water and the scripture tells us by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward he conceived down the road see faith gives you a vision to be able to see beyond just what's there you're looking at the unseen looking at something that's more real than the current pleasure something that's more real than just the moment something more real even than the election or anything else that's going on there's something more real amen the reality of the word of god is more real so he said he had respect of the unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured seeing him who is invisible isn't that who you want to see tonight and i'm always saying open the eyes of my heart lord let me see you let me see the one who is invisible david wanted to be in god's house if you look at david there's just something about david he wanted to be in the house of god and the bible says david was a man after god's own heart in other words he david wanted things that god wanted what do you want you see the world's got what they want what do you want tonight what does hardy arkansas want what does word of life tabernacle want what what do you want there's something real inside your life that would reach out and make you even if it was uncomfortable even if it was caused hardship even if it was hard but you still want to be in the presence of god and so david says in psalms 27 4 one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord to inquire in his temple he wanted to be there why because he loved the word amen he was a man after god's own heart he loved the word and he loved to worship amen see if we don't have that love to worship in our lives and i want you to stay i i don't want to say this too harshly because you know people will come many times and they just don't have that love and then one day when they're under the atmosphere of the holy ghost things begin to change in their life one day they realize they want to be in the presence of god but that old shell's got them down but many times so i want you to keep coming and come in the presence of god but many times we sit through services if you don't want to be in god's presence you won't respond to the word you won't respond to the to the preaching you won't respond to the to the music you won't respond to the presence of god and you just sit there and go in and go out and and nothing's changed except you got a little worse than what you were but he said one thing have a desire to the lord can we say that that's us tonight i desire yes there's many things i want i i you may say i want a better car i want a better house i want a better job i want i want to be married i want to some people want to be unmarried whatever it is that you want but more than anything else i want to be in the house of the lord and i think we can say today david wanted to be in his physical house i think we could say i want to be the house of the lord amen that's my desire whatever it takes god i want to be your house his wants and gods once became the same why they both wanted fellowship brother branham tells us and i know this message took a strange turn but you know it's in hours like this we should re-examine what we want why we're here while you're listening there on the stream or wherever that you're at tonight why you're here i know many of you can't come on wednesday night but you want to be here there's a desire and you watch the services you want this is your church you want to be a part you want to be here and so there's something inside of you what is it that wants that brother brown said at one time man had perfect fellowship with god that was god's purpose he said that's the reason it's a crave in your heart it's a longing for something of contact amen he said i love the word don't you he said you know why you love the word bill james and i can sit and talk about the word for hours i love the word don't you hey man do you know why you love the word amen you have the holy spirit in you amen but the bible said that man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god he said so the holy spirit feeds on the word and then when you hear the word he said everyone wants to hear it no matter every little piece of literature they can pick up now think about this this is someone that wants that speeds on the word that wants to hear the word everyone wants to hear it every little piece of literature they can pick up they read it they listen to the radio they go to church and so forth because they are longing for that fellowship around the word amen some of you are streaming tonight some of you are not able to be here but you're longing for that fellowship around the word he said they listen to the radio every little piece of literature they read they try to get in touch with god why because they want that fellowship around the word do you know why the opening of the word and the revealing of the son of man came in our day but andrew talked about that sunday morning why did that happen in our day lebron says in abraham he said god would represent himself again in human flesh just before the coming of the son of man what flesh your flesh my flesh god coming down from heaven why did he come like that why did he come and shout a message why did he come like that to nrh because he wanted fellowship god coming down from heaven god longing for fellowship and god's power to transform i know i'm reading a lot but i want to get through this without wearing you out tonight he said oh wandering stars how long will you wonder you methodist baptist presbyterians outsiders whatever you might be wandering stars from church to church from pillar to place television to television world to world why don't you come on said he longs to have fellowship with you he is longing for you what do you want i'll tell you what he wants he wants you he wants me and if i'm not careful i get up in the morning and and i rush around to get the kids up and brush my teeth and get everything ready and maybe run down to the church or do some business have some things to do study for a while and all of the things that i do but he wants me he don't just want what i do are you with me now you don't want just want me as a pastor he wants me he wants to have fellowship with me he don't just want you as a husband or as a wife or as a as a deacon or a trustee or whatever that you are he wants you and that's why we give him a little time at the end of the service and i would to god that that would just become richer and richer in our lives he wants you he wants to talk to you you've heard the word and he's been speaking to you through the service let that just wash over you he wants you he's longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind what do you want he wants to transform you amen not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are part of if that desire is in you oh god what do you want i guarantee you you don't want the word as bad as he wants you as bad as he as bad as you want the word you still have the flesh i still have the flesh but he wants you unencumbered by that amen he said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled see and the rapture brother brown said now so you were in if you've got eternal life you were in god before there ever was a world you are a part a son of god an attribute of god he knew the very age you were coming he knowed because i should have read it that way you'll forgive me sometimes i correct brother with english and i don't do that intentionally i worked in a job where my basically my job was correcting people's english for for 15 years and so i'll read it right even if brother brown says it wrong so many times but it's not wrong we know what he's talking about amen he says he knew he knowed the very age you were coming and he predestinated you he predestined you to that age to take that place and no one else can take it you know what he's talking about don't you he said care how many impersonations and things you've got to be there because he knew you would be there now you're made manifest now you can have fellowship with him and that's what he wants amen he let you come the way that you did and let you be raised the way that you were that's not good english either but come up the way that you are he let you be who you are why because he wants you he's longing for fellowship and you were made manifest on this earth because he wants to fellowship with you not not your flesh but he wants to fellowship with that seed that's inside of you now he said now you are made manifest so that now you can fellowship with him and that's what he wants he's longing for fellowship to be worshipped so he comes to church and he's sisters and just thinks oh i hope they worship me tonight if we can put it in human terms you understand he knows what you're going to do but you know if we can put it in human terms it's that longing oh i hope they worship me tonight i hope they take a little bit of time and stop thinking about what's going on on the outside i hope they just take a little bit of time and just spend it in my presence i want to fellowship with them i want i want i want to speak to them the words of life i want to be i want them to be a a part of me i want i want to be have that that intimate fellowship imagine if someone comes and maybe you've done something that's wrong even as a christian sometimes we do things that are wrong don't we you've done something that's not right and you know and and you sit there and you think oh i i need to repent of that and you just see the holy spirit how that maybe you've had that anger that bitterness so that that that thing you let that worry take over your life that frustration and he sits there but the rhetoric says the holy ghost goes to the gable end of your soul he doesn't leave you but it's you don't feel that presence in your life you don't feel the the effects of the holy spirit in your life he's been grieved from you but don't you know he's there saying oh i want you to repent i want you to come back to me i want you to and all it would take is just lord i'm sorry i don't want to be that way i don't want to be that old that old cruel hard person lord i'm sorry i know that's not right and here he comes why does he forgive us over and over and over again because he wants to have fellowship with us the world got what they wanted satan got what he wanted how much more will god get what he wants amen thank you lord he's longing for fellowship to be worshipped he said i wonder if we recognize how much he wants you if we could ask god today what do you want i want you amen brother branham tells us jesus only asked for one thing in his prayer to the father he said you know what that was one thing after all of his sacrifice that he did here on the earth the life that he lived the path that he walked he asked for one thing where i am they may be also you ask for our fellowship amen so that's the only thing he asked the father in prayer your companionship forever amen oh don't you love him tonight let me make you want to worship your lord don't make you want to fellowship with him because he asked the father in prayer one thing your companionship forever he said listen saint john 17 the 24th verse he said then how much should we desire him amen he said now listen he said if he desire now listen if you really are born of the spirit of god that means everything to you it means everything to you and i watch people maybe somebody don't let them sing when they think they should or or maybe have them sing when they think they shouldn't they quit coming to church they'll quit depending on the house of god maybe some will get on there somebody will say something to them a little bit off maybe say something that's bad you know say something rude to them and it was rude but they'll let that keep them away from fellowship when brother a prophet told us that you want it more than anything else more than anything else i just want fellowship i i've made a lot of mistakes i know every one of us here could say that we made a lot of mistakes but ultimately what do i want i want fellowship with god i want fellowship i'm i'm not perfect but i want fellowship and if that desire for fellowship is there i'll climb over the rocks and and and go under the fences and anything i have to do to have fellowship with god and brother brother said it ain't some book of rules you don't live by law any laws and so forth you don't come to church on wednesday night because you have to or because you're afraid i'm going to preach at you because you didn't ain't some book of rules you don't live in any laws and so forth you live by the grace of god you want it more than anything else how could you keep somebody who wants something more than anything else you take somebody wants a new car they're always in the car a lot until they get that new car they're always on the internet looking at cars my daughter wants something my daughter decided here not long ago excuse me esther but she they wanted a tent my two daughters decided they wanted one little play tents and they want that more than anything else in the world i've watched them amused because i wouldn't buy them one i think they finally got one through the black market but i wouldn't buy them one and and but i watched them i was so amused by it because they look through amazon stuff and they they know better than to push the button to buy it but they want it so bad it just becomes a consuming desire all right i hope we can only have that kind of desire for god that every day we'd flip through our phone whatever it is we wouldn't be looking for a tent we wouldn't be looking for something else we'd be looking for god looking for his fellowship looking for fellowship with other believers it ain't some book of rules you don't do that because i can't make you do that there's nothing i could do to make you do that you don't live by laws you live by the grace of god amen amen i wonder today if we're willing to give god what he wants he said i want to be happy are you willing to give him what he wants are you willing to make god happy well you said brother ben how could i make him happy i don't know i won't hold you much longer tonight but brother brown says this he said in christ the mystery of god revealed said now you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe you've got tapes on discipline in the church how we behave ourselves in the church of god how we got to come here together and sit together in heavenly places he said don't stay home if god is in your heart you you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out you honor he didn't sit there and say how preachers we talked about that earlier but he didn't say now preachers you make sure they're in church on wednesday night he said don't stay home but if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers and i know many of you are like that i know there's people who've been in such pain through all this this problem that we've had and such turmoil and some people that can't come and i see that and i recognize that but there's a desire there and sometimes people that come don't have that desire god help us today but we've got to keep that fire alive don't stay home if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out your under to get in here to fellowship with your brothers you may get sick or have a problem and you know for the first time in our life we've had to tell sick people to stay away you know we've always said come to church if you're sick and we'll lay hands on you we believe you'll get better and now you start telling people that are sick to stay away and i understand the reason but there's still a desire they want to be there if god is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers he said if you don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to pray something's happened to the want listen why he said because we're in the last days how could we say anymore how could i i could come up here and yell and scream about it or whatever but we laid it out before you we're in the last days we're at the end of the end there's nothing left if there ever was a time to fulfill the scripture much more as we see the day approaching and i'll just say that doesn't mean we'll have necessarily have more services but when we have church we'll want to be there it doesn't because the early church didn't have two services on sunday and i'll get in trouble for that but it's the truth and we may have one or two but the early church probably just had one but it lasted a while but you know that i'm not a fan of long services but you understand there's a want there's a desire i'd rather have people that wanted to be there and be there for five minutes and spend three hours where people didn't want to be there i'll say this if you don't want to come to church don't come to church but oh i would pray that god would give you a desire give you a desire to be in the house of god i want to tell my kids that too i'd say that quietly to them but you know that has to be stirred up in you paul says stir up the gift that's in you right sometimes we got to stir up the gift stir up that seed let that seed take preeminence in our life but there's still something there you understand he said much more as we see the day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another why because we're in the last days do i need to get a sign put it out here like the end is coming the end is near do we need to stand out on the road and wave a sign maybe pay that guy that stands down there to put up a sign say the end is near we don't have to do that that's not what excites us we see the word being fulfilled in our day and we realize the end is near and during this time we ought to be that much more desirous of being together than we ever were this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for the other he said that's right stay right together well go on he said if the brother you think he's a little wrong with his sister i know this is so familiar to you but could we just reawaken it for a moment think about it listen to me you've heard that prophecy about that woman coming into power all these years and then you see it whether at the literal fulfillment or not you see the catholic church coming in you see a woman in a position of power like that and you begin to think you've heard it for years and years but it was still god's word a genuine prophet said thus saith the lord and it's according to the scriptures you understand it so now we're seeing it amen amen and if that don't wake you up nothing will but you see people are you have to be motivated by love or even that it's not going to bring you to the house of god and it's and more than that it's not going to make you a real christian the brother you think he's a little wrong with the sister say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the christ right out of my life i've seen preachers and i would never de-christianize the preacher because you don't know what he's been through but i've seen preachers that the christ was gone from their lives and they stand in the pulpit with a root of bitterness god help me never to do that yes amen but it may be easier for me to do than anyone else here you understand because of the position how satan attacks that and because you deal with people all the time brother branham calls it the poison acids if you could imagine two more worse things that you could have in your body the poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred and it'll come and it'll affect your face it'll affect your attitude it'll affect your outlook it'll make you think everybody's against you it'll it'll make you lash out from the pulpit or from the pew or from the car or at the dinner table it'll make you lash out at the preacher it'll make you lash out of the congregation why because it's poison acids malice and jealousy and hatred so that will just take the holy spirit right away from you it will run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here it'll hurt your pastor it'll do everything see he said don't you do that very man but here's what he said to do you just waxed that much closer today together don't you realize this is the same prophet that said those other things said thus the authority said if it doesn't come to pass he said i'm a false prophet and here it is today coming to pass just like he said it would see you just wax that much closer together same prophet take the buckle if there's a testimony on the internet i believe his brother cleveland talks about brother brown was referencing the testimony that he gave he had a vision about the buckle and how they would draw up he said that was tightening up to the word of god but branham gave him the interpretation of it he said take the buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night by having a buckle seeing it in a vision he said just that buckles on the whole armor of god buckle it on amen just pull her on tighten up tighten up there's something loose tighten it up what you doing you get a rattle in your car you're driving down the road and something's rattling somewhere what does it need it needs tightening up needs some tightening up somebody needs to get a wrench out begin to tighten it up or that we would let the holy spirit tonight begin to tighten us up we're at the end he said because we're at the end amen we ought to come that much closer together tighten up move right up close to one another you see what it's done in the natural in this hour and we you have to do what you have to do i don't believe in just flaunting the rules but look everybody's distancing everybody's distancing but watch what's happening in the spiritual it's been happening a while spiritually everybody's distancing everything's virtual but a prophet of god spoke and said these things will happen and he said we're at the end time just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another you don't want to get too close i'll spit on you but talk nice about one another thank you brother say nice things about one another can we could we do that you say well that's not very deep brother ben but don't you realize that's how we tighten up we know where we are we know who we are we're we know in whom we have believe it we know that we're predestined we know all these things but tighten up talk nice about one another when you tighten up you don't get more grouchy that's legalism when you tighten up and and and everybody seems bad to you and you're always talking bad about somebody know tighten up talk nice to one another talk nice about one another say nice things about one another amen amen that seems so simple but he said say nice things about one another and then god will bless you you could just see without that principle that same principle we talked about in business it works in the church say nice things about one another and then god will bless you what do you want what do you want i'll tell you what i want especially after seeing these last few months this last year i want a body change now i can say that but what i want manifests itself and what it in what i do how can i get a body change who's selling them where they at are they on the internet is there some place i can go and google it up how do i get a body change can i go down and get into the minerals and the salts and everything and find a body change can i get it in medicine at the drugstore where can i find a body change huh where am i going to get a body change where am i going to get it i'm not going to get it down at the drugstore i'm not going to get it down somewhere else i'm going to get it in the word of god amen tighten up to the word of god amen i don't get a body changed by running around talking about my neighbor i don't get a body changed by by flirting with the things of the world i get a body change which is what i want amen do you want that more than anything else i believe brother james could stay with us he wants a body change more than anything else right now he wants a body change i think all of us can say that we want a body change we're ready to go home and then if you're ready to go home tighten up get close as close as you can to the word as close as you can to one another tighten up where at the end this is we've seen the very end time signs come to pass where at the end you'll get what you want you want a church that's on fire for god you'll get it why because you'll have you can have it at the end time if you want it bad enough you want revival you can have it you want happiness you can have it you want peace you can have it but you got to come god's provided way to get it it's all right here what do you want most of all in your life it's bower heads i don't want a body jam be changed just because i want to be out of the pain but i want to have unbroken fellowship with him what do you want i've seen so many people get so distracted and they're playing with mud pies they don't realize that they're playing with mud pies here at the end of the age at the last call we had to have this last administration and now we've got this one you can see politics lining up you see a prophet messenger came and went years ago we have the message of the hour we have the opening of the word what do you want you want to play with mud pies satisfy yourselves with carnality or do you want the word of god in your life more than anything else and i'll tell you what just in the last few weeks and months i've just been pulling up closer and thinking god i want you and i found myself not wanting some things that were in my life because i want you more lord would you just make that your prayer tonight this is wednesday night they used to call wednesday night
