[43:05] joel chapter 1 and verse 4.
[43:10] joel chapter one and verse four uh keep
[43:12] remembering each
[43:13] of the those that are sick and several
[43:16] of the kids i know are
[43:17] are sick and colds and things like that
[43:20] in the church and
[43:21] uh different families couldn't be here
[43:22] today so be praying for them but i know
[43:24] they're watching
[43:25] this morning
[43:28] i want to continue on our thought of
[43:32] are we there yet but i want to speak
[43:34] this morning on hearts restored to
[43:36] fellowship
[43:39] and we need to also remember um
[43:42] the white camp family and keep them in
[43:44] our prayers as brother bill's lost his
[43:46] mother
[43:48] and sister sharon's had some
[43:49] complications with the procedure she had
[43:51] done on her heart and
[43:53] and so they need our prayers today and
[43:55] we need to keep them
[43:57] remember them today and then uh the
[44:00] church at galena
[44:01] and i was going to say brother brown's
[44:03] church but brother brown has passed on
[44:05] now and
[44:06] let's remember them in our prayers and
[44:08] and that they would
[44:10] it's hard we've been through that where
[44:13] you change from one pastor to another
[44:15] for whatever reason and
[44:16] and so it's difficult and so keep them
[44:18] in your prayers and
[44:20] then this afternoon we'll have communion
[44:22] it's always
[44:23] i know some folks can't be here but it's
[44:26] always a
[44:27] a blessing to have communion be able to
[44:30] do that
[44:31] and then we when we have the opportunity
[44:33] we should do that and you say brother
[44:34] ben i don't feel worthy to take
[44:36] communion well
[44:38] all you have to do is repent if you're a
[44:40] christian the only thing
[44:42] standing between you and taking
[44:43] communion is saying lord i'm sorry
[44:47] we can all do that amen
[44:50] amen joel chapter one and verse four
[44:52] that which the palmer worm hath left
[44:55] the locust eaten that which the locust
[44:57] hath left at the cankerworm eaten
[44:59] and that which the cankerworm had left
[45:02] had the caterpillar eaton i pray the
[45:04] lord would add his blessing to the word
[45:06] you may be seated this morning
[45:13] i don't have a lot of notes this morning
[45:14] i'm going to take my time and speak to
[45:16] you from my heart we
[45:19] um have been to several funerals
[45:22] lately and it just seems like those
[45:25] things kind of go in spurts
[45:27] and i went to
[45:30] speak at a funeral wednesday of a
[45:33] a young man he was 52 years old that
[45:36] seems younger all the time
[45:38] who had passed away unexpectedly and
[45:42] not really any reason for it it was just
[45:44] his time and
[45:46] but i hadn't been around those people in
[45:47] a long time and and some of them may
[45:49] watch this i know his wife
[45:52] and the family sometimes watch these
[45:54] services but
[45:55] i was around the family and i hadn't
[45:58] been around them in a long time and
[46:00] they had not had fellowship in a local
[46:03] church for a long time and
[46:05] i got to looking at that and i thought
[46:08] it makes a difference
[46:10] it makes a difference the fellowship
[46:12] matters
[46:15] the leaves on the tree are not
[46:18] something an added benefit they matter
[46:21] to the life of the tree
[46:23] and the health of the tree the tree is
[46:25] not cannot produce fruit unless it has
[46:28] leaves
[46:29] right it cannot be a tree it cannot
[46:32] provide shade it cannot
[46:33] it doesn't do any good you go and what
[46:35] do you what do you do when you see a
[46:37] tree with no leaves in the middle of the
[46:38] summer
[46:40] it's dead right you see that it's dead
[46:43] and
[46:44] and so i i was watching that and it
[46:47] really broke my heart because some of
[46:48] those kids i grew up with i spent
[46:50] 16 years with some of them and then come
[46:52] back 15 years later and
[46:55] and things have changed and i haven't
[46:58] changed i still
[46:58] serve the same god and preach the same
[47:00] gospel but things have changed and
[47:04] and i told you here not long ago a
[47:06] little boy that i grew up with i
[47:09] saw him went and spent the day with him
[47:11] in in church in a message
[47:12] church we grew up together kind of and
[47:15] he uh
[47:16] didn't know if he believed in god
[47:18] anymore
[47:20] and how do you get to that place with a
[47:21] steward where you don't even know
[47:23] if you believe in god well it begins
[47:26] it's because the cankerworm is eaten
[47:27] away
[47:28] and the caterpillar's eaten away and the
[47:30] locust is eaten away at the tree
[47:33] and there's no fellowship and there's no
[47:34] cooling and there's no
[47:36] there's no way to keep your life clean
[47:38] and
[47:39] and do the things that you need to do
[47:41] and and so that lack of fellowship
[47:44] matters and
[47:45] on the way when we were on our way to
[47:48] the funeral
[47:49] i was at steak and shake in west plains
[47:52] we stopped there to eat on the way by
[47:54] the jt and
[47:55] i saw someone there who i had known
[47:59] and who i grew up with and he had taken
[48:02] his family out of church and he may
[48:03] watch this as well
[48:05] but he'd taken his family out of church
[48:07] and just listens to tapes at his house
[48:10] and i've seen the results of that and
[48:11] when i saw him i could tell he was under
[48:13] conviction because he knew i was
[48:15] pastoring here now and
[48:16] and they hadn't been over and he was
[48:19] under a lot of conviction he begins to
[48:21] defend this to me and he was like
[48:24] abraham and you didn't have to have a
[48:25] church home and all these things and i
[48:27] began to think about these things and i
[48:28] thought
[48:29] and i was already planning on preaching
[48:30] this but i thought god
[48:32] i'm so grateful for the fellowship that
[48:34] i have
[48:35] so grateful to be able to gather with
[48:37] god's people
[48:38] if for nothing else because that's what
[48:40] he said to do
[48:41] but it's not just that it it it's not
[48:44] just an added benefit it's a
[48:46] it's something that's essential to the
[48:48] life of a christian
[48:49] brother branham says you can't be as
[48:51] good a christian
[48:53] and not go to church and so that's
[48:56] pretty straightforward i want to be a
[48:58] good christian don't you
[48:59] you don't want to be a halfway christian
[49:01] why would you want to be miserable
[49:04] anything halfway is miserable why be
[49:06] miserable why be in and out and up and
[49:08] down and
[49:09] when you can stay right there in
[49:10] communion you can stay right there in
[49:13] fellowship with god and so
[49:16] you would you would find as we were
[49:18] talking about are we there yet
[49:20] are we in a place where we
[49:23] are restored can we say that malachi 4
[49:27] did what he came to do can we say that i
[49:30] believe
[49:31] he did what he came to do but the proof
[49:33] of that has got to be me
[49:35] right have i been restored am i am i are
[49:37] we there yet have i been
[49:39] turned back has my heart been turned
[49:42] back
[49:42] to fellowship with god and with the
[49:45] people
[49:47] now a lack of fellowship is a symptom as
[49:49] i've said before it's not a
[49:51] it's not the problem it's a symptom of
[49:54] the life that's been taken out of the
[49:55] tree
[49:57] but he takes it away and then he gets to
[49:59] the life now
[50:01] in first john 1 3 or actually we'll go
[50:04] to a quote here first in restoration of
[50:06] the bride tree brother branham says then
[50:07] this little fellow
[50:08] died out and he become a locust he said
[50:11] that was the next stage was the locust
[50:13] now what does the locust do
[50:14] the locust eats the leaves he said
[50:17] destroyed the leaves he said what's the
[50:19] leaves for
[50:21] he said he was destroying divine
[50:23] fellowship
[50:25] brother branham calls it divine
[50:26] fellowship now in first john 1
[50:28] 3 john says that which we have seen and
[50:31] heard
[50:32] declare we unto you that you also may
[50:34] have fellowship with us
[50:36] and truly our fellowship is with the
[50:38] father and with his son
[50:40] jesus christ so he's saying there and
[50:41] we've talked about this before but
[50:43] there's a
[50:43] vertical fellowship taking place it's
[50:46] got to be there before this horizontal
[50:48] fellowship can happen
[50:50] right we've went over that before but
[50:52] you know i want to dwell on that just
[50:54] for a moment that we've got to be in
[50:55] fellowship with god
[50:58] right not just know about god
[51:01] not just to know about a message of the
[51:04] hour and all the things that we know but
[51:05] to actually
[51:06] be in fellowship with god means that
[51:09] you're communing with him on a regular
[51:11] basis
[51:12] how do we have fellowship with god well
[51:14] first of all we were out of fellowship
[51:16] with god and that fellowship
[51:18] came by the blood brother badam said god
[51:20] only accepts a man through
[51:22] shed blood he said that's the only place
[51:25] of fellowship the only way
[51:26] across that chasm is not through
[51:29] religious organization
[51:31] not through idols not through towers not
[51:34] through holy places
[51:36] see you come to church because you're in
[51:39] fellowship with god
[51:40] but church itself doesn't make you in
[51:42] fellowship with god
[51:44] right but you come to church because
[51:46] you're in fellowship with god
[51:47] he said it's not holy places not through
[51:50] cities not through anything else
[51:52] but the shed blood that's the only way
[51:55] back amen and brother adam says this he
[51:59] said the preaching of the cross
[52:01] despised as it is it's god's provided
[52:05] way
[52:06] for sinners amen to come in fellowship
[52:10] with god
[52:11] or with each other so we can say we come
[52:14] to hear the preaching of the word
[52:16] because we want to be in fellowship with
[52:17] god if you're out of fellowship today
[52:19] if you're doing things that you know
[52:20] that is wrong you know that you
[52:22] shouldn't be doing that you can come
[52:24] in fellowship with god under the shed
[52:26] blood but how by the preaching of the
[52:28] word
[52:29] but brother a prophet of god stands
[52:31] there and tells you he said how can you
[52:32] be
[52:33] washed if you won't stay where the
[52:34] fountain is
[52:36] how can you be washed unless you listen
[52:38] how can you be washed unless you hear it
[52:40] amen
[52:41] how do you maintain fellowship with god
[52:43] unless you're willing to stay
[52:44] where the fountain is and the bible
[52:48] tells us that if we want to have
[52:49] fellowship with god
[52:51] we should not grieve the spirit and he
[52:54] tells us that in ephesians 4 30
[52:56] but first john 1 and 6 says if we say we
[52:58] have fellowship with him
[53:00] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[53:03] the truth
[53:05] we say we have fellowship with him so i
[53:08] have fellowship with god
[53:09] but i walk in darkness he said if we but
[53:11] if we walk in the light
[53:13] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[53:16] now watch what he says one with another
[53:18] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[53:21] cleanses
[53:22] us from all sin you can't
[53:25] be in darkness and say i'm saved i'm
[53:29] redeemed
[53:30] i'm walking in the light i'm in
[53:31] fellowship with god
[53:34] and i don't say that to condemn us this
[53:36] morning because i believe you're a
[53:37] christian this morning
[53:39] you come to the house of god or you're
[53:40] watching this morning you're a christian
[53:42] i'm not saying that to condemn you but
[53:44] if you're in darkness
[53:45] walk in the light it's a whole lot
[53:48] simpler than what people make it
[53:51] just walk in it just do it
[53:55] right you know what's what's the right
[53:56] thing to do
[53:58] you wake up you know what you should be
[53:59] doing but it's just doing it right
[54:02] it's just walking and how are you going
[54:03] to do that well you have to invite the
[54:05] spirit of christ
[54:06] into your life to be to be able to do it
[54:08] because otherwise you're gonna
[54:10] you're gonna fail in the flesh because
[54:11] the flesh is always against god and
[54:13] always will be
[54:15] never will be converted but yet there's
[54:17] something inside of you
[54:18] that will cause you to walk in the light
[54:20] because you have fellowship
[54:22] with that light now the random tells us
[54:24] in harvest time he said back
[54:26] he said now go back to genesis which is
[54:27] the beginning he said genesis
[54:30] means the beginning he said we find that
[54:32] god gave his family eternal life as long
[54:35] as they stayed in this word and lived by
[54:38] this word
[54:40] i want to slow this down because i want
[54:42] you to get this quote it's very
[54:44] important very important
[54:48] especially for those of us who are maybe
[54:50] growing up and
[54:52] in in faith and none of us are there yet
[54:55] we're not
[54:55] in the sense that we all have something
[54:57] to learn
[54:59] but part of what you have to learn is
[55:01] yourself
[55:03] how do i deal with myself
[55:06] right my biggest problem that i have to
[55:08] deal with is not some other pastor
[55:10] somewhere
[55:11] sometimes pastors can give you problems
[55:14] it's not some other
[55:16] person it's not any of you
[55:19] the biggest problem i've ever had is
[55:20] right here
[55:22] how do i deal with myself
[55:26] right and i suspect that your problem is
[55:28] the same person
[55:30] right itself
[55:34] now so brother branham deals with this
[55:36] he said
[55:37] his first family lived by this word but
[55:40] when they broke it just
[55:41] one link in the chain of promises death
[55:45] struck them which was a promise also
[55:49] right we talk about promises and we
[55:51] should believe the promises
[55:53] but death was a promise said if you eat
[55:56] thereof that day you'll die that was a
[56:00] promise
[56:02] god's promises are true right
[56:05] he said it's a chain you're hanging over
[56:08] hell with it i want you to get this
[56:09] image brother branham uses it hundreds
[56:11] of times he said you're hanging over
[56:13] hell by a chain
[56:15] that chain is the word of god right
[56:18] you're hanging over hell with it that's
[56:20] the only thing
[56:21] that'll carry you through nothing else
[56:24] will keep you from hell
[56:26] but the word right i love
[56:29] emotion i love good times i love to
[56:31] worship
[56:32] there's nothing that blesses my heart
[56:34] more than seeing people worship but that
[56:36] won't keep you out of hell
[56:39] nothing i love more than to be in church
[56:41] with all of you fellowship we go to the
[56:43] fellowship all this afternoon
[56:44] have a potluck dinner i love to eat but
[56:46] fellowship with the bride won't keep you
[56:48] out of hell
[56:50] right what does the chain of god's word
[56:53] right the chain of god's word is holding
[56:56] you amen
[56:58] amen he said you're hanging over hell
[57:00] with it he said now listen
[57:02] he said when the believer becomes a
[57:05] make-believer
[57:07] upon do that for a while because you
[57:10] can't come become something different in
[57:11] the seed but in your attitude you can
[57:15] right in your outlook when the believer
[57:19] becomes a make-believer and you say well
[57:22] that that can't happen well go back and
[57:24] listen to three kinds of believers
[57:25] brother branham gives an altar call to
[57:27] unbelievers and make believers to become
[57:29] believers
[57:32] that's what he does at the end of that
[57:33] sermon right and so
[57:36] all of us at on some level at different
[57:39] times in our life
[57:40] we've been an unbeliever a make-believer
[57:41] or a believer
[57:43] but on the inside it's what we really
[57:45] are but he said when the believer
[57:46] becomes a make-believer and lives on one
[57:48] word
[57:49] that's contrary to this word he cuts his
[57:52] fellowship with god
[57:55] one link broke
[57:59] that's why you better have the holy
[58:00] spirit right because who else is going
[58:02] to teach you the word
[58:04] how else brother joe are we ever going
[58:05] to know whether we're right because you
[58:08] could look through
[58:09] and try to study it and find out every
[58:11] little thing that you could find
[58:12] but the holy spirit has got to be there
[58:14] to convict you to
[58:16] to call you back to the word to bring
[58:17] you back into
[58:19] fellowship with god so
[58:22] he says your faith in this word is like
[58:25] a chain
[58:26] he said he said a chain is its strongest
[58:29] at its weakest link and this is the same
[58:31] quote just continuing
[58:33] he said that's right it's the strongest
[58:35] he said
[58:36] because that's all it'll hold right you
[58:39] don't have to break every link in the
[58:40] chain just one link
[58:42] that's all that'll hold now listen what
[58:45] he says
[58:46] he says if there's something in the word
[58:48] that's puzzling to you
[58:51] and i don't want you all to raise your
[58:52] hand and admit it but for me there's
[58:54] lots of things in the word that's
[58:55] puzzling to me
[58:58] sure it is but there's some things that
[59:01] maybe would bother you wouldn't bother
[59:02] anybody else
[59:04] you don't understand it i met a man one
[59:07] time that
[59:07] was just perplexed why brother branham
[59:10] would talk about shorts on
[59:11] men he didn't understand that and women
[59:14] could wear skirts
[59:17] right and he didn't understand that they
[59:18] just went below the knee why can't a man
[59:19] wear shorts below the knee and
[59:21] and you know there's we could go into an
[59:23] explanation and all of that but that was
[59:24] puzzling to him
[59:26] and almost made it where he couldn't
[59:27] believe the message just because of that
[59:29] right and it's puzzling there's
[59:31] something puzzling to you something that
[59:33] it's just you for some reason for
[59:35] whatever reason that was puzzling to him
[59:36] there may be something in the message
[59:38] something in the word of god that's
[59:39] puzzling to you
[59:41] you think maybe maybe you think well
[59:46] you know that word is true but it's not
[59:49] really for me
[59:50] my situation is different but he said if
[59:54] it's puzzling to you
[59:56] he said something that you've heard
[59:58] different
[1:00:00] right and so maybe you come in here and
[1:00:02] preach and you've heard it different all
[1:00:03] your life
[1:00:04] and you think well yeah that's true
[1:00:07] but i heard it this way so maybe this is
[1:00:11] okay as well
[1:00:13] he said but if it's puzzling to you and
[1:00:14] you've heard it a certain way all your
[1:00:17] life
[1:00:18] different he said but they said
[1:00:23] now who are they they is usually the
[1:00:25] people that get you into trouble
[1:00:29] is they because like i said you you got
[1:00:33] to conquer yourself
[1:00:35] and they may not know what's best for
[1:00:37] conquering self
[1:00:40] right they might say this is okay it's
[1:00:42] okay for you to do this
[1:00:44] you can do this they might come out and
[1:00:46] say well
[1:00:47] you can lead your family this way you
[1:00:48] can go to this church you can do that
[1:00:50] this side or the other
[1:00:51] but you gotta have that in your own
[1:00:53] heart
[1:00:54] right they said oh that was for the
[1:00:56] apostles
[1:00:58] them things was for days gone by he said
[1:01:00] when the scripture said
[1:01:02] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:01:06] and forever
[1:01:07] brother brown said don't let that be a
[1:01:09] weakness
[1:01:13] because it's puzzling to you you don't
[1:01:17] understand it maybe it's the way
[1:01:18] somebody treated you
[1:01:20] and you've been treated badly and and it
[1:01:23] becomes like a sore spot and you don't
[1:01:25] understand it
[1:01:26] but you know you should treat other
[1:01:27] people right
[1:01:29] you know when he was reviled he reviled
[1:01:31] not again but you just can't
[1:01:32] quite do it and then other people come
[1:01:34] around you on facebook they're
[1:01:36] especially good at this
[1:01:37] and oh we understand oh they shouldn't
[1:01:39] have treated you that way man
[1:01:40] you have a right to be upset you have a
[1:01:42] right to be angry you have a right to
[1:01:43] not go to church
[1:01:47] they said
[1:01:50] they said god don't really mean that
[1:01:54] god you'll be okay they said
[1:01:57] but what did god say because they said
[1:02:01] might be the weak and
[1:02:01] the weak link in the chain remember he
[1:02:04] said they said
[1:02:06] certain things but what did god say he
[1:02:08] said don't let that be a weakness
[1:02:11] fortify it hold it
[1:02:15] there's a saying in baseball i'm sure
[1:02:17] brother david's heard it that
[1:02:18] that don't you not let that you not
[1:02:22] you don't want to let certain people
[1:02:23] beat you so before they go to a game
[1:02:26] one game one team against another they
[1:02:28] say who do we not want to let beat us
[1:02:31] it sounds strange but it's like if we
[1:02:33] get beat by their best
[1:02:35] players or something wrong with our
[1:02:36] strategy because we can pitch around
[1:02:39] them we can walk them
[1:02:40] right so they fortify against the best
[1:02:42] players and if somebody else beats us
[1:02:44] they're just going to beat us
[1:02:45] but we're going to fortify against the
[1:02:47] guy we know we know what he can do
[1:02:49] if we don't plan for him that's our
[1:02:51] problem
[1:02:52] because we know he's a problem right we
[1:02:56] know he's going to get hit
[1:02:57] and the truth is there's some things in
[1:02:59] your life that you know that's a problem
[1:03:02] some areas some things in my life in
[1:03:04] each one of our lives that we know
[1:03:05] that's a problem and we know and you say
[1:03:07] what does this have to do with
[1:03:08] fellowship well look
[1:03:09] this is what keeps you from being in
[1:03:11] fellowship with god
[1:03:14] one link and
[1:03:18] we'll come back to this later because i
[1:03:19] want us to really understand it because
[1:03:21] it has to do with
[1:03:22] fellowship with one another as well but
[1:03:24] he said don't let it be a weakness
[1:03:26] fortify it take that very thing that is
[1:03:28] a weakness
[1:03:30] maybe it's just you have a hard time
[1:03:32] studying
[1:03:34] the word that's your weakness you just
[1:03:36] have a really hard time my dad was not a
[1:03:38] reader i was a reader i always loved to
[1:03:40] read
[1:03:40] my dad was not a reader well i found as
[1:03:42] i get older i don't read as much as i
[1:03:44] used to
[1:03:46] but and maybe i just knew him when he
[1:03:48] was old i don't know
[1:03:51] but my dad never read but you you have
[1:03:53] to study there's there's got to be a way
[1:03:55] you got to fortify that
[1:03:57] right for some people may be easy to
[1:03:59] take an hour and pray 30 minutes and
[1:04:00] pray whatever it is
[1:04:01] for other people that's difficult maybe
[1:04:04] the way you were raised and different
[1:04:05] things way that you come up it's hard to
[1:04:07] have family prayer it's hard to have a
[1:04:09] devotion it's hard to do that you've got
[1:04:11] to fortify that
[1:04:13] watch out for that spot because that's
[1:04:16] exactly where the devil's going to get
[1:04:17] you but the random says
[1:04:18] he has one punch coming at you right
[1:04:21] there's something in your life he said
[1:04:22] if it wasn't maybe it'll be a sickness
[1:04:24] maybe it'll be a certain mindset
[1:04:26] something or another he's got a pledge
[1:04:28] coming at you for brother branham
[1:04:29] he dealt with depression in his life he
[1:04:32] struggled with that every seven years
[1:04:34] brother branham dealt with depression
[1:04:36] people deal with things we're real
[1:04:38] people aren't we
[1:04:39] we're human beings but fortify that
[1:04:42] don't make excuses for it
[1:04:45] right that's the worst thing you could
[1:04:46] do not because i don't want to hear your
[1:04:48] excuses but because it's the worst thing
[1:04:50] you could do for you
[1:04:52] right the worst thing you can tell
[1:04:54] somebody is you're a victim
[1:04:56] because as soon as you realize you're a
[1:04:58] victim you begin to act like a victim
[1:05:01] even if you are a victim it's the worst
[1:05:03] thing you could ever realize about
[1:05:04] yourself
[1:05:06] he said fortify it hold it wrap your
[1:05:09] listen
[1:05:09] wrap your life into it well it's hard
[1:05:12] for me to go to church it's hard for me
[1:05:14] i don't like it people offend me it's
[1:05:16] hard for me to be in the house of god
[1:05:17] with people it's hard for me to take
[1:05:19] communion
[1:05:19] hard for me to do foot washing fortify
[1:05:22] that
[1:05:23] wrap your life into it if you know it's
[1:05:25] something you're supposed to do
[1:05:27] take that spot and fortify it
[1:05:30] are you with me this morning this meant
[1:05:31] so much to me because i've got those
[1:05:33] spots
[1:05:35] that i need to fortify he said wrap your
[1:05:37] life into it because that's the only
[1:05:39] thing
[1:05:40] that'll take you over the flames of hell
[1:05:44] now how do you maintain this fellowship
[1:05:48] well you don't grieve the spirit you
[1:05:50] fortify those spots what else do you do
[1:05:52] commit to communion
[1:05:53] i i appreciated brother allen's sermon
[1:05:56] wednesday night so much and it actually
[1:05:58] convicted me a little bit because
[1:06:00] we've got to be committed we've got to
[1:06:02] be committed
[1:06:04] to prayer we've got to be committed to
[1:06:06] the house of god we got to be committed
[1:06:08] as a christian
[1:06:10] amen and and you say well brother ben
[1:06:13] said i don't have to pray because i
[1:06:14] don't ever do anything wrong well good
[1:06:16] for you
[1:06:17] that's not why you pray huh
[1:06:21] who prayed the most in the bible look it
[1:06:24] up sometime
[1:06:25] the person the biblical figure who we
[1:06:28] who we see
[1:06:28] praying the most is christ
[1:06:33] and he never did anything wrong
[1:06:36] so it actually works like this obedience
[1:06:38] leads to prayer yes but prayer leads to
[1:06:40] obedience
[1:06:42] no one prayed more than than christ did
[1:06:45] and the more christ-like you become the
[1:06:47] more you pray
[1:06:48] not less
[1:06:52] so brother branham talks about that he
[1:06:54] said so children back to your god
[1:06:56] quickly
[1:06:58] oh if i could say that this morning word
[1:07:00] of life tabernacle back to god
[1:07:02] quickly not that you're some kind of
[1:07:04] sinner out here somewhere but every day
[1:07:06] it's a walk
[1:07:07] back to god quickly don't tangle with
[1:07:09] the world for anything
[1:07:11] stay out of this modern world stay out
[1:07:13] of these modern theologies just look to
[1:07:15] the lamb of god he said read your bible
[1:07:19] and pray
[1:07:20] all the time don't be weary
[1:07:24] be rejoicing happy for the redemption of
[1:07:27] the church's drawing nigh
[1:07:29] when we shall see him who died for us
[1:07:32] amen amen stay in that holy place
[1:07:37] where the man is fresh all right
[1:07:39] remember brother branham talks about and
[1:07:41] we'll read some from
[1:07:42] it but in the hidden life in christ he
[1:07:43] talks about how that
[1:07:45] there was a problem because when the
[1:07:47] people began to eat
[1:07:49] the manna that had been left over the
[1:07:51] manna that was provided for their health
[1:07:53] and their well-being
[1:07:54] made them sick right remember that
[1:07:58] they yesterday's man that made him sick
[1:08:01] brother branham in a very colorful
[1:08:02] comment calls it the campground cramps
[1:08:07] made him sick i apologize to those of
[1:08:10] you that are already sick today
[1:08:13] but it made them sick they couldn't they
[1:08:15] couldn't because there was leftovers
[1:08:18] they were coming in and out just getting
[1:08:19] the leftovers but he talked about how
[1:08:20] that there was a man that was kept
[1:08:22] inside
[1:08:23] the holy of holies and in the presence
[1:08:26] of the shekinah
[1:08:27] that manna never went bad
[1:08:31] amen and so you have to stay in that
[1:08:33] place you say well i don't understand
[1:08:35] every day it seems like i'm up and i'm
[1:08:36] down and i'm in and i'm out
[1:08:38] stay in the holy place and brother
[1:08:40] barron says i think that's what's the
[1:08:41] matter with our church today
[1:08:43] he said we got too many of those
[1:08:44] layovers he said that's right he said
[1:08:47] some people just eat enough manna
[1:08:49] to make them right good and hungry for
[1:08:50] some more
[1:08:53] he said they just you know it's like
[1:08:55] eating mcdonald's i've never eaten
[1:08:56] mcdonald's been full
[1:08:59] i guess it's the salt content but every
[1:09:00] single time i've ever eaten at
[1:09:02] mcdonald's
[1:09:02] i'm more hungry when i get done than
[1:09:04] when i started now about 30 minutes
[1:09:06] later i'm full but right then you want
[1:09:08] to eat more
[1:09:09] why because you just ate enough to make
[1:09:11] it right good and hungry for some more
[1:09:13] he said before one revival to another
[1:09:15] one you have to go out and get renewed
[1:09:16] again
[1:09:18] he said oh brother why don't you stop
[1:09:20] that nonsense and come into the holiest
[1:09:22] of holies
[1:09:23] by the blood of the lord jesus every bit
[1:09:26] of man
[1:09:27] outside of here just lets you last for
[1:09:28] tonight or tomorrow next week it won't
[1:09:30] work
[1:09:31] it dries up overnight right we want
[1:09:34] something that'll work
[1:09:36] we want to have something in our heart
[1:09:38] today that works for every day
[1:09:40] that doesn't just make us a little bit
[1:09:42] better versions of ourselves
[1:09:44] but changes us but keeps us that well
[1:09:48] let's just walk with him where we quit
[1:09:50] making excuses for how we are
[1:09:52] say well that's just the way my family
[1:09:53] was just the way i was no you can be
[1:09:55] like christ
[1:09:57] hey man you don't have to be like your
[1:09:59] family you don't have to be like me or
[1:10:00] anybody else
[1:10:01] you can be like christ do we believe
[1:10:02] that today amen i can be as committed as
[1:10:05] christ i can pray like him why because
[1:10:07] his spirit lives in me
[1:10:09] amen just as so flesh gets in the way
[1:10:12] but i can stay
[1:10:13] on the inside in that holy of holies i
[1:10:15] can stay in that place
[1:10:17] now look it's possible to grieve him but
[1:10:20] it's also possible to stay there
[1:10:24] he said it's impossible wait just a
[1:10:25] minute
[1:10:27] he says he said but if you'll ever
[1:10:30] consecrate yourself to come into where
[1:10:31] the man
[1:10:32] stays fresh day in and day out year in
[1:10:35] and year out in the holiest of holies
[1:10:37] he said you can meet that man that's
[1:10:39] ever walked in there
[1:10:41] he said i don't care if he hasn't been
[1:10:43] in revival for six months
[1:10:46] he's just as sweet as he was the day he
[1:10:48] was in the revival
[1:10:51] hallelujah he said that's right you
[1:10:53] could meet him on a shouty day
[1:10:56] amen i'm so glad for the shouty days but
[1:10:59] he said you could meet him on a shouty
[1:11:00] day
[1:11:01] or on a cloudy day hallelujah
[1:11:04] or whatever you want to he might be
[1:11:07] driving a tractor he might be driving a
[1:11:08] truck he might be working in a factory
[1:11:10] but you can meet him on a cloudy day
[1:11:12] or a shouty day it doesn't matter he's
[1:11:14] just the same because he's living
[1:11:16] in the glory of god amen
[1:11:19] he said he's living where the man is
[1:11:21] fresh all the time
[1:11:22] where it isn't a burden to get out he
[1:11:25] said notice him pray through today
[1:11:27] and pray through tomorrow now brother
[1:11:29] man it's not telling us not to pray
[1:11:31] through
[1:11:31] i heard a message preacher one time get
[1:11:33] up and preach and say you don't have to
[1:11:34] pray through anymore
[1:11:35] that's false you do have to pray through
[1:11:42] but you need to stay prayed through
[1:11:45] right because brother random makes some
[1:11:47] statements he said david didn't have
[1:11:48] didn't pray through before he went and
[1:11:49] fought goliath
[1:11:51] he was already prayed up right you don't
[1:11:54] have to go back and
[1:11:55] repray you can stay prayed up it's not
[1:11:58] necessarily even how much you pray but
[1:12:00] it's staying in that atmosphere
[1:12:03] staying in that place where whether it's
[1:12:05] a shouty day or a cloudy day
[1:12:06] while you prayed through that day you
[1:12:08] don't have to go out go
[1:12:10] get out and pray through today and pray
[1:12:11] through tomorrow he said brother stay
[1:12:13] with him all the time
[1:12:14] in the holiest of holies he said can a
[1:12:17] person live that way
[1:12:18] he said brother man that's impossible
[1:12:20] but a prophet of god because i was
[1:12:22] having this conversation the other day
[1:12:23] and
[1:12:24] like i said perhaps i'll listen to this
[1:12:25] but in this conversation with a man was
[1:12:27] obviously convicted
[1:12:29] and and i just i told him i said brother
[1:12:32] i didn't bring it up
[1:12:35] and you know i'm not the person that
[1:12:38] and i love that brother love him to
[1:12:41] death
[1:12:42] but you no one is exempt from the word
[1:12:47] right no matter how much we love each
[1:12:50] other and we
[1:12:50] i want everybody to be saved but
[1:12:52] nobody's exempt from the word
[1:12:54] and you can choose to go to church
[1:12:57] wherever you want to you go to the
[1:12:59] church of your choice but you got to go
[1:13:00] to church
[1:13:03] you say well if i lived in africa
[1:13:04] somewhere but you don't
[1:13:09] right maybe i won't be a little bit more
[1:13:12] blunt than i normally
[1:13:13] am but there's a reason for it because i
[1:13:16] see
[1:13:17] what happens to families when they get
[1:13:18] out of church
[1:13:22] and some of you make a real effort with
[1:13:23] your families and
[1:13:25] and i appreciate that i it does my heart
[1:13:28] good to see you here with your babies
[1:13:29] and the babies are
[1:13:30] maybe struggling and crying and things
[1:13:32] but it means the world
[1:13:35] because you're teaching them something
[1:13:37] my dad there's a lot of things my dad
[1:13:39] taught me wrong but he taught me one
[1:13:40] thing right go to church
[1:13:42] he taught me to go to church and we were
[1:13:43] always at church and so for me it wasn't
[1:13:46] hard for me
[1:13:47] to develop a habit of going to church i
[1:13:50] didn't have to do that as an adult
[1:13:52] because i was there as a kid and so it
[1:13:55] means the world to be able to do that
[1:13:56] because they
[1:13:57] it won't be a weakness in their life you
[1:13:58] understand it's
[1:14:00] less likely to be a weakness in their
[1:14:01] life if they did it as a kid
[1:14:03] but some of you weren't saved as a child
[1:14:04] you didn't go to church or your parents
[1:14:06] maybe didn't do that
[1:14:08] and and yet you come to church today why
[1:14:10] because the love of god's in your heart
[1:14:13] but but i'm not just preaching this at
[1:14:16] you and you understand but
[1:14:18] but to make sure we understand that
[1:14:21] we must do it it's not i'll do it
[1:14:24] because it's good and because i enjoy
[1:14:26] the preacher because we have the pastor
[1:14:28] i wanted or
[1:14:29] we have the person no it's not it's not
[1:14:32] dependent on that this is essential
[1:14:36] you just can't be as good a christian
[1:14:39] as you can if you go to church and i
[1:14:42] told the brother the other day
[1:14:43] he's like well you don't have to go to
[1:14:45] church to be saved and i said
[1:14:47] no i said but i'll tell you what dwight
[1:14:49] moody told his congregation he said you
[1:14:51] don't have to go to church he said you
[1:14:52] can
[1:14:53] you can get to england without getting
[1:14:54] on a boat he said but it's a long way to
[1:14:56] swim
[1:15:01] but it does affect people you might be
[1:15:04] saved
[1:15:06] but who are you affecting around you
[1:15:11] i don't want to have to stand at your
[1:15:12] funeral
[1:15:15] and look at what you've done and the
[1:15:16] decision you made not to be in church
[1:15:21] because i'll do it i'll i'll do it
[1:15:23] because i love people
[1:15:25] say brother ben why do you do it because
[1:15:26] there is people it could be god's people
[1:15:28] we don't know
[1:15:30] we don't know one from another
[1:15:33] but when you see him make decisions you
[1:15:35] see that decision directly lead
[1:15:37] to the things that have gone on in the
[1:15:40] in in a life or a family and you think
[1:15:42] god
[1:15:42] if they could only realize that they did
[1:15:44] this to themselves
[1:15:47] but but i want you to i want you to hear
[1:15:49] the warning today not
[1:15:50] not that you would do that but i just
[1:15:52] want you to hear the warning that
[1:15:54] that life wouldn't pass by with me never
[1:15:57] saying it
[1:15:59] that it leads you need to think about
[1:16:02] going to church
[1:16:03] more seriously than what we do sometimes
[1:16:07] more seriously because it is a serious
[1:16:09] thing it's the word
[1:16:11] and the word is that chain
[1:16:15] right and that's
[1:16:39] people come to me i can remember
[1:16:40] preaching sister brown years ago 90
[1:16:42] something years old and she
[1:16:43] she'd come in the prayer line go oh
[1:16:45] brother ben i want to be closer to god
[1:16:47] i never knew anybody who lived closer to
[1:16:48] god than sister brown
[1:16:50] in my life but that's the way she would
[1:16:52] come i think we all ought to come that
[1:16:53] way sometimes
[1:16:57] now in the new testament the only people
[1:17:02] that we know about in the new testament
[1:17:03] who refuse to assemble with a local
[1:17:05] church
[1:17:06] this includes ministry by the way
[1:17:08] because even paul whenever he would go
[1:17:10] to a town he'd go to the local church
[1:17:14] and maybe there were several he went to
[1:17:16] all of them probably
[1:17:18] but he would go to the saints that were
[1:17:20] in that town
[1:17:22] all that would let him all that would
[1:17:23] allow him to come now the only people in
[1:17:25] the new testament who refused to
[1:17:26] assemble with the local church were
[1:17:28] apostates
[1:17:29] you can find that in first john 2 19.
[1:17:33] that's he said they went out from us
[1:17:35] because they were not of us
[1:17:36] they broke fellowship right and
[1:17:40] again i don't want to be harsh but we
[1:17:41] need to think about it seriously
[1:17:44] and because the fellowship is though
[1:17:46] that leaves that the
[1:17:48] locusts ate away brother brown said this
[1:17:51] and i want to take you through several
[1:17:52] quotes here and
[1:17:55] what i'm going to do is i'm going to try
[1:17:56] to convince you that brother branham
[1:17:57] believed in
[1:17:58] what the word says right
[1:18:01] and not that you haven't already been
[1:18:03] convinced but but just
[1:18:04] to bring that up in our minds and so
[1:18:06] there never be any question if anybody
[1:18:08] asked what
[1:18:08] why did brother branham believe about
[1:18:10] going to church
[1:18:12] and brother branham says this he said i
[1:18:13] pray that every sinner that comes in
[1:18:15] through these doors will be converted
[1:18:16] and will take a good church home he said
[1:18:19] there's some fine churches and fine
[1:18:20] ministers here and i would not say which
[1:18:22] one
[1:18:22] or where he said because if i was here
[1:18:24] i'd be in confusion which place to go
[1:18:27] brother brown was being so nice to the
[1:18:28] brothers there and said i wouldn't even
[1:18:30] know which one to choose
[1:18:32] he said there's just so many fine
[1:18:33] churches and find places
[1:18:35] he said you just take you one of your
[1:18:37] choice
[1:18:38] one right i don't care
[1:18:42] and i i'm serious about that and i have
[1:18:44] to surrender my own flesh to do that
[1:18:46] because i want you to come here
[1:18:48] right i want everybody i meet to come
[1:18:50] here but that wouldn't work
[1:18:52] right but i want you to come here but
[1:18:54] you need to go to one church
[1:18:56] right and then you can visit wherever
[1:18:57] you want right but go to one church
[1:19:00] he says find one of your choice but you
[1:19:02] be sure he said to be there every night
[1:19:04] the door is open
[1:19:04] and again i know some of y'all sick
[1:19:07] today and being convicted by that and
[1:19:09] i apologize i didn't intend that but
[1:19:12] it's just the way it is but
[1:19:17] it's not for you because you'd be here
[1:19:18] if you wanted if you could be i've known
[1:19:20] people who couldn't go to church
[1:19:22] physically unable to go god knows that
[1:19:27] but their heart was there and you watch
[1:19:29] that person
[1:19:30] i marvel sometimes at elderly people
[1:19:33] because elderly people
[1:19:34] are more faithful and some of that is
[1:19:37] just because they're less busy right
[1:19:38] you've got less to do
[1:19:40] but some of that is not that some of
[1:19:41] it's just because they they've lived
[1:19:44] and they know how important it is
[1:19:48] right to come to the house of god
[1:19:51] now um remember the steward you have a
[1:19:54] hard time preaching this afternoon i'm
[1:19:56] just
[1:19:58] looking forward to brother stewart this
[1:20:00] afternoon before communion bit
[1:20:02] look at this brother branham says be
[1:20:04] sure to be there every night the door is
[1:20:06] open
[1:20:07] he said and if you just love the lord
[1:20:09] real well
[1:20:10] you'll be there don't you want to love
[1:20:14] god
[1:20:15] he said well brother ben this is before
[1:20:17] the books and the tapes
[1:20:19] before the books and the tapes now we
[1:20:21] have the book states we don't have to do
[1:20:22] this anymore
[1:20:23] continue that quote this is this is the
[1:20:25] next quote
[1:20:27] he said now the tapes of the messages in
[1:20:29] the books he said they're all back at
[1:20:30] the back
[1:20:32] but you find a church home
[1:20:35] right now
[1:20:39] brother brown went to india in september
[1:20:41] 1954 and he had no cooperation in the
[1:20:43] sense that
[1:20:44] churches there was a person that
[1:20:46] sponsored him but it wasn't
[1:20:48] they didn't have any infrastructure in
[1:20:49] the country no churches to take the
[1:20:51] people to
[1:20:52] and so he gets over there and has all
[1:20:54] kinds of problems and yet he said that
[1:20:56] the meeting in bombay was his greatest
[1:20:58] meeting
[1:20:59] was the bombay meetings there was
[1:21:01] something like over in that meeting over
[1:21:03] half a million people
[1:21:05] we can even imagine that number of
[1:21:08] people in that meeting
[1:21:09] half a million people and he talks about
[1:21:14] 10
[1:21:15] 000 mohammedans being saved
[1:21:18] at the same time in one service
[1:21:21] because they saw a miracle of i believe
[1:21:22] a blinded eye opened and
[1:21:24] he talks about that being his greatest
[1:21:26] meeting greater than africa but you
[1:21:27] don't hear about india
[1:21:29] the way you do about africa when it
[1:21:30] comes to the message of the hour there's
[1:21:32] a reason for that
[1:21:33] because he didn't have any church to
[1:21:35] send them to
[1:21:37] there was no existing church
[1:21:39] infrastructure it's mostly a pagan
[1:21:41] country
[1:21:42] and so brother branham it's why he
[1:21:44] called a men's meeting
[1:21:46] and ended up preaching the sermon called
[1:21:47] taking sides with jesus
[1:21:49] but branham does that because he's
[1:21:50] disturbed by that
[1:21:52] india meeting by the events that took
[1:21:54] place
[1:21:55] because he realized and he says he'll
[1:21:57] say at different points to his ministry
[1:21:59] i don't know where any of them are he
[1:22:02] would say something like 50 000 people
[1:22:04] were saved he said i don't know where
[1:22:05] any of them are
[1:22:07] and because they didn't have any support
[1:22:10] you ought to patch yourself on the back
[1:22:11] this morning you don't realize
[1:22:12] what a great support you are to other
[1:22:14] christians
[1:22:16] just being able to gather together i
[1:22:17] know we're not large in number but just
[1:22:19] being able to gather together in
[1:22:20] in the house of god on a sunday morning
[1:22:22] or on a wednesday afternoon
[1:22:24] whatever it is you don't know what that
[1:22:25] means to other people what it means to
[1:22:27] me
[1:22:28] to see your face what it means to other
[1:22:29] people it gives you courage to keep
[1:22:31] going on
[1:22:32] these people didn't have it so they were
[1:22:36] converted they gave their hearts to
[1:22:37] christ and then
[1:22:38] they never heard anything about the
[1:22:39] gospel again many of them
[1:22:42] and think about what an opportunity
[1:22:43] we've had to hear it over and over and
[1:22:45] over
[1:22:46] he's still with me this morning i i know
[1:22:49] i'm wading through a little bit
[1:22:50] different water than usual but you just
[1:22:52] stay with me
[1:22:54] now brother branham says about that
[1:22:57] meeting he said
[1:22:58] he said i have learning a little better
[1:23:00] than that now
[1:23:02] he said every person that saved ought to
[1:23:04] have a church home and he was speaking
[1:23:05] about that india meeting
[1:23:06] he said every person that's saved ought
[1:23:08] to have a church home
[1:23:09] they ought to be in church and there
[1:23:11] every time that church has a service or
[1:23:13] every time you pass it
[1:23:14] brother brandon set a high standard here
[1:23:17] so you all just
[1:23:17] he said every time you pass it go and
[1:23:19] open the doors and go in and pray or do
[1:23:21] something
[1:23:23] now we don't make that a law but you
[1:23:25] understand what he's saying love the
[1:23:26] lord
[1:23:30] amen amen now
[1:23:35] he said again speaking of that same
[1:23:38] india meeting and jesus christ the same
[1:23:39] yesterday today and forever he said it's
[1:23:40] such a sad thing
[1:23:42] he said if we can get the ministers to
[1:23:44] cooperate so that the man when he's
[1:23:46] converted
[1:23:46] he can have a church home to go to if
[1:23:49] you turn him back out in the devil's
[1:23:51] pickpin
[1:23:52] then he'll become back again just like
[1:23:54] he was
[1:23:57] he said well if they're predestinated
[1:23:58] they'll make it god predestinated you
[1:24:00] and then put you in the church
[1:24:04] to help you you understand i made the
[1:24:06] statement the other night when brother
[1:24:07] brown
[1:24:08] had passed away i don't know that i
[1:24:10] would be here today standing here
[1:24:11] preaching to you if it wasn't for
[1:24:12] brother brown's ministry
[1:24:15] i don't know that and and you say well
[1:24:17] you're predestined you you've got a gift
[1:24:18] in your life no god
[1:24:20] allows the things to happen in your life
[1:24:21] that's all a part of
[1:24:23] the providence of god i don't know that
[1:24:26] i would be here
[1:24:27] you know that what they told him what
[1:24:29] they told brother branham when he got to
[1:24:30] the other side
[1:24:31] they said if you hadn't went we wouldn't
[1:24:34] have been here
[1:24:36] huh so there's a responsibility that's
[1:24:40] on us but i don't know
[1:24:41] if brother brown hadn't set that example
[1:24:42] for me as a young man of what a message
[1:24:44] ministry was in that time and day and
[1:24:47] hour that he lived in i
[1:24:48] i don't know that i would have made it
[1:24:51] and i've had other men like that in my
[1:24:52] life and i've been able to be a part of
[1:24:54] great churches that that helped me and
[1:24:56] some not so great but they still it
[1:24:58] helped me to go to the house of god
[1:25:02] if you turn someone out in the devil's
[1:25:03] pigpen he'll be come back again just
[1:25:05] like he was
[1:25:06] he said but if you get a place got a
[1:25:08] place you can direct him to
[1:25:10] he said something good he said like
[1:25:12] jesus with the samaritan
[1:25:14] he taken him to the end you realize that
[1:25:17] god even ha
[1:25:18] even uses pastors for those that he
[1:25:21] finds
[1:25:23] on the side of the road
[1:25:26] god finds them god arrests
[1:25:29] god gets a hold of them god takes them
[1:25:31] and binds up their wounds and takes them
[1:25:33] to the pastor
[1:25:36] what an awesome responsibility take some
[1:25:38] of the church what an awesome
[1:25:39] responsibility as the church he took him
[1:25:41] to the end
[1:25:42] and he said the good samaritan taking
[1:25:44] the fallen falling man to the end he
[1:25:46] said
[1:25:47] he said that's we got to have a place
[1:25:48] like that
[1:25:50] there's got to be somewhere where and
[1:25:52] brother random talks about that just
[1:25:54] meant so much to me he said
[1:25:55] he said he the the innkeeper he said the
[1:25:57] pastor received payment
[1:26:00] he did from god not money
[1:26:03] the pastor received payment he said he
[1:26:05] he received he received
[1:26:07] direction from god and wisdom and he
[1:26:09] received
[1:26:11] the gifts of healing and the things that
[1:26:12] he would need i thought god
[1:26:14] i'm so glad that you give us provide for
[1:26:16] us what we need to care for the people
[1:26:20] but here the end the the samaritan has
[1:26:22] to bring the man to the end he said we
[1:26:24] got to have a place like that
[1:26:26] again in 1959 in baum and gilead brother
[1:26:28] the brandon says i wish this above
[1:26:30] all things that you hear tonight that
[1:26:34] who believes in your heart that you love
[1:26:35] the lord
[1:26:36] and something has happened to you he
[1:26:38] said i wish this above all things
[1:26:40] he said promise to me that you'll find a
[1:26:42] good gospel church somewhere
[1:26:44] a church that teaches the full gospel
[1:26:46] the power of god his resurrection
[1:26:49] join up with those people and make
[1:26:50] yourself a church home
[1:26:52] he said don't just stray around loose on
[1:26:54] the streets
[1:26:55] go get a good church somewhere of your
[1:26:57] choice where the gospel and the power of
[1:27:00] god is made known
[1:27:01] and the science of eternal life is in
[1:27:03] there the signs that was in christ
[1:27:04] amen amen that's what we're striving for
[1:27:07] isn't it that's what we believe we have
[1:27:09] amen by the grace of god christ said i
[1:27:13] am the vine you're the branches
[1:27:14] and the first vine that come out of the
[1:27:16] branch brought forth a pentecostal vine
[1:27:18] that went forth preaching the gospel
[1:27:21] amen
[1:27:21] he said signs and wonders if the follow
[1:27:24] the lord jesus followed that church
[1:27:26] if that vine produced that kind of a
[1:27:27] branch the first one the next line will
[1:27:29] have to produce
[1:27:30] he said the next branch will have to be
[1:27:32] like the first vine and every vine that
[1:27:34] comes off of that branch
[1:27:35] will be like the first one
[1:27:38] you say well brother ben
[1:27:43] my church home is is
[1:27:47] my home and that's wonderful your home
[1:27:50] ought to be a sanctuary
[1:27:52] do i believe i would never limit god
[1:27:56] if the only place you have to worship is
[1:27:57] your home make it a place of worship
[1:27:59] make it sacred
[1:28:01] right maybe you're not able to come to
[1:28:02] church maybe you're physically not able
[1:28:04] i know there's people who watch our
[1:28:05] services
[1:28:05] there's some people who watch
[1:28:06] religiously that we've never seen here
[1:28:08] at the church
[1:28:09] and i pray that god would still continue
[1:28:11] to bless them i don't
[1:28:13] i don't want to count them out or or say
[1:28:15] that they're not christians but
[1:28:17] by the same token you have to
[1:28:20] you have to have a home somewhere and
[1:28:22] what did brother branham define a church
[1:28:24] home
[1:28:25] as because again and this goes back to
[1:28:28] what we said
[1:28:30] you've got things you don't understand
[1:28:32] he said don't let that become a weakness
[1:28:35] because you don't understand what a
[1:28:37] church is find out what
[1:28:39] a prophet said a church is what the word
[1:28:41] says the church is
[1:28:44] right find out what what happened in the
[1:28:46] bible be willing to
[1:28:47] to learn or that will become a weak spot
[1:28:50] in your life and the devil used it all
[1:28:51] your life to destroy you and your family
[1:28:54] because it keeps you out of fellowship
[1:28:56] so what does the church home consist of
[1:28:58] brother branham says every man ought to
[1:28:59] have a church home
[1:29:01] you ought to have a place not just to
[1:29:02] float about from pillar to post
[1:29:04] he said but have somewhere and number
[1:29:07] one that you go to church
[1:29:09] right he said you call it your church
[1:29:14] somewhere you pay your tithes and
[1:29:17] somewhere that you help support the
[1:29:18] cause
[1:29:20] right that's a pretty good definition i
[1:29:22] think
[1:29:24] somewhere that you go to church
[1:29:27] somewhere that you call it your church
[1:29:30] so you don't just float around say where
[1:29:31] do you go to church and
[1:29:33] like my brother joel at one time
[1:29:35] comically was
[1:29:36] and he's watching i'm sure this morning
[1:29:38] but he was comically telling
[1:29:40] someone i think he was that brother
[1:29:42] andrew someone said where did you go to
[1:29:43] church he was at one of the andrews
[1:29:44] meetings he said where are you preaching
[1:29:45] next weekend
[1:29:47] and and that's
[1:29:51] that's funny but at the same time some
[1:29:53] people actually do that
[1:29:55] but there's got to be somewhere you go
[1:29:56] to church and you call it your church
[1:29:59] it doesn't mean sometimes you'll get
[1:30:00] sick and not be able to come sure you
[1:30:02] will
[1:30:02] there will be times you'll be on
[1:30:03] vacation that's that i'm not going to
[1:30:05] come digging
[1:30:06] you know digging at you because you go
[1:30:07] on vacation i'm going to take a vacation
[1:30:09] this year
[1:30:10] i don't want you calling me every day
[1:30:12] telling me i should be back
[1:30:14] unless there's a real issue right but
[1:30:17] you but you know you but you understand
[1:30:19] i you know you got to have some place
[1:30:22] he said but it's not perfect well
[1:30:26] it's only as perfect as god can make it
[1:30:30] and you're not perfect either right
[1:30:33] but somewhere you go to church somewhere
[1:30:34] you call it your church somewhere you
[1:30:36] pay your tithes
[1:30:36] somewhere that you help support the
[1:30:38] cause
[1:30:40] brother brown says take your choice
[1:30:43] but then don't never disfellowship the
[1:30:45] other man because he doesn't belong with
[1:30:47] your group that's denominationalism
[1:30:52] don't ever disfellowship the other man
[1:30:54] because he don't belong with your group
[1:30:56] what if you disfellowship people
[1:30:59] because you're a little offended by them
[1:31:02] or because
[1:31:03] they fellowship with certain people you
[1:31:05] don't fellowship with
[1:31:06] or because they maybe they even believe
[1:31:08] something a little different than you do
[1:31:09] now i'm not talking about
[1:31:11] out and out apostasy i'm talking about
[1:31:13] they just a little different
[1:31:15] and you just fellowship with them over
[1:31:16] that what's the difference in you in a
[1:31:18] denomination
[1:31:22] tell me what the difference is you're
[1:31:24] going to be like the church of christ
[1:31:25] and say we're not a denomination
[1:31:26] denomination
[1:31:27] say why well because we said so
[1:31:30] right i mean that's the only reason
[1:31:33] they're not a denomination they say
[1:31:34] we're not a denomination
[1:31:36] well it's got all the trappings of a
[1:31:38] denomination
[1:31:40] in fact maybe more denominational in
[1:31:42] mindset than anything else
[1:31:44] and that's where in the message we can
[1:31:45] get in trouble because oh we're not
[1:31:47] denomination but
[1:31:48] but do you cut people off because they
[1:31:51] don't agree exactly with the way you
[1:31:52] think it ought to be
[1:31:55] right he said don't disfellowship the
[1:31:58] other man because you don't belong with
[1:31:59] your group
[1:32:00] discern his spirit now watch this
[1:32:03] brother random taught this we should
[1:32:04] look at the spirit of a man even more
[1:32:06] than his doctrine we should look at his
[1:32:08] doctrine
[1:32:08] but more than that we should look at his
[1:32:10] spirit discern the spirit
[1:32:13] and see if he because his doctrine he
[1:32:16] could be corrected maybe he's wrong
[1:32:17] maybe he don't understand
[1:32:18] but if he's got the wrong spirit the
[1:32:20] wrong motives and objectives there's
[1:32:21] nothing you can do for him
[1:32:23] right he just needs a heart change you
[1:32:25] understand only god can do that
[1:32:28] but the doctrine can be corrected he
[1:32:29] said discern his spirit and see
[1:32:31] if he's got the same purpose in heart
[1:32:33] you got fellowship one with another
[1:32:37] and if we both want to see souls saved
[1:32:39] we ought to be able to have fellowship
[1:32:40] right
[1:32:41] we both want to gather under the blood
[1:32:42] we ought to be able to have fellowship
[1:32:45] and i hear this argument all the time
[1:32:48] that people say well when brother
[1:32:49] branham said that about going to a
[1:32:50] church home
[1:32:51] he was just being nice he was just
[1:32:54] saying what the preachers wanted him to
[1:32:55] hear
[1:32:56] what an awful thing to say about a
[1:32:58] prophet
[1:33:01] what a disrespectful thing to say about
[1:33:03] a prophet
[1:33:06] was he just telling us what we wanted to
[1:33:07] hear how can i have confidence in
[1:33:09] anything else he said
[1:33:12] right but listen what would you let
[1:33:14] brother branham tell you what he meant
[1:33:17] when he was telling people to have a
[1:33:18] church home brother brown said did you
[1:33:20] ever hear me when i'm making an altar
[1:33:22] call
[1:33:23] he said i say when i get them up there
[1:33:25] and get them saved i say now you go to
[1:33:27] some
[1:33:27] good full gospel church and get you a
[1:33:29] church home now we read four or five
[1:33:31] instances of that there are dozens well
[1:33:34] brother branham says that
[1:33:36] he said have you heard me say that how
[1:33:38] many have ever heard me say that sure
[1:33:41] he said why why would i send them there
[1:33:43] then
[1:33:44] would i be a hypocrite to send my own
[1:33:46] children to death
[1:33:50] far be it from me oh sir
[1:33:53] brother branham wasn't a hypocrite he
[1:33:55] was telling us the truth
[1:33:57] and that's what the word says assemble
[1:34:00] yourselves together
[1:34:02] even more as you see the day approaching
[1:34:04] now
[1:34:06] and and you say well i just have a hard
[1:34:09] time doing it
[1:34:10] but there's your weakness and you're
[1:34:12] hanging over hell by that
[1:34:15] right that that's you've got to guard
[1:34:18] that
[1:34:19] yes i know it's hard for some people
[1:34:21] some people just don't get along in
[1:34:23] crowds some people are introverts
[1:34:24] i know it's difficult but you're hanging
[1:34:26] over hell by that word
[1:34:28] and the bible says therefore to him that
[1:34:30] knoweth to do good and doeth it not to
[1:34:31] him it is sin
[1:34:34] now if you know to have a church home
[1:34:37] and don't do it the chain
[1:34:38] is broken i don't know what else to tell
[1:34:41] you say well brother
[1:34:42] brother ben i felt led you may have felt
[1:34:44] led but the spirit that led you against
[1:34:46] the word was wrong
[1:34:48] it was an evil spirit
[1:34:54] let's move on
[1:34:59] i i don't want to ever get to a place
[1:35:00] where i'm comfortable preaching
[1:35:02] uh hard things you understand i have to
[1:35:06] say it
[1:35:07] but i want to always be able to say it
[1:35:09] because i have the right motives in my
[1:35:10] heart you understand
[1:35:12] because i love you i don't ever get
[1:35:14] comfortable with just getting up and
[1:35:15] cutting people
[1:35:20] we got to have fellowship not just with
[1:35:22] the church
[1:35:23] our church but with the body of christ
[1:35:27] with the body of christ john 13 34 says
[1:35:30] a new commandment i give unto you that
[1:35:32] you love one another
[1:35:34] as i have loved you you also love one
[1:35:35] another
[1:35:37] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:35:38] my disciples if you have loved one to
[1:35:40] another
[1:35:41] if people had to judge you
[1:35:45] whether you were a christian or not
[1:35:47] based on your love for
[1:35:48] other message people in your area
[1:35:51] would they know you were a christian
[1:35:58] let that sink in and i'm not saying we
[1:36:02] you can't do
[1:36:02] everything for everybody you can't be
[1:36:04] everybody's close friend you understand
[1:36:06] you have a responsibility to your own
[1:36:08] church you can't fellowship with
[1:36:09] everybody
[1:36:10] but the desire ought to be there
[1:36:16] by this the love we have one for one
[1:36:17] another we'll travel overseas and
[1:36:20] i can't explain to you the difference
[1:36:22] and i think it's because they go through
[1:36:23] so much financially and physically
[1:36:26] that they just love one another and the
[1:36:29] churches tend to fellowship together
[1:36:30] more
[1:36:31] and there's a closeness that
[1:36:34] you're just all together and we're just
[1:36:36] piled up on top of one another i'll be
[1:36:38] honest sometimes
[1:36:39] i don't have you in my home maybe we've
[1:36:41] been living in a small place we're
[1:36:42] moving to a bigger place and i hope to
[1:36:44] invite you all over
[1:36:45] maybe not all at once but we'll have you
[1:36:46] all over but
[1:36:48] and maybe we will all at once son let's
[1:36:50] just plan that we get into this house
[1:36:53] but
[1:36:54] but when you're when you're together
[1:36:57] like that
[1:36:58] i was in manila in brother malevo's
[1:37:00] house and he watches some of these
[1:37:01] services as well but
[1:37:03] the closeness of it because his living
[1:37:05] room is about the size of this piano
[1:37:07] and but the pastors the other pastors
[1:37:10] would come in
[1:37:11] we had a the first marriage banquet that
[1:37:14] they'd ever had
[1:37:15] while i was there and it was 120 degrees
[1:37:18] or something like that we all dressed up
[1:37:21] everybody dressed up and i was about to
[1:37:23] die but they ate and had a marriage bank
[1:37:25] we went upstairs and
[1:37:27] i gave a a little talk to the married
[1:37:29] couples that were there was a wonderful
[1:37:30] time
[1:37:31] but the closeness of that fellowship you
[1:37:33] just don't get
[1:37:46] forth all that effort and gathered
[1:37:48] together there in
[1:37:50] just a tiny little place and i i'll
[1:37:51] never forget sitting in the
[1:37:53] in the pastor's house and and it's hot
[1:37:56] because there's only one room air
[1:37:57] conditioned that was mine
[1:37:59] and i wanted to get up there but i felt
[1:38:02] bad leaving those people and so
[1:38:03] everybody's sitting
[1:38:04] here in that in that space and in the
[1:38:07] house and i'm sitting there just just
[1:38:09] crammed together waiting on church to
[1:38:11] start
[1:38:12] i thought my goodness i'm going to see
[1:38:15] some of these people
[1:38:16] again i may never see them again i don't
[1:38:18] speak some of their language i don't
[1:38:20] know their name but i'm going to see
[1:38:21] them again
[1:38:22] and the closeness that i have here is
[1:38:24] going to be so much more over there
[1:38:27] and i got to i read my heart really went
[1:38:28] out to those people i thought
[1:38:30] i want to be around them i want i have
[1:38:33] there's something in me i want to be
[1:38:34] there
[1:38:34] and ever since i left i wanted to go
[1:38:36] back africa the same way i want to go
[1:38:38] back
[1:38:38] not because i could do something great
[1:38:40] for them but because i want to be around
[1:38:42] them
[1:38:43] and they said it's that kind of
[1:38:44] fellowship couldn't we be that way with
[1:38:46] each other
[1:38:49] they say familiarity breeds contempt but
[1:38:52] not with the holy ghost not with
[1:38:56] the people of god
[1:38:59] brother branham said this and i know
[1:39:00] i've probably taught you this before
[1:39:02] talked about it before but just bear
[1:39:04] with me a moment bear with me in my
[1:39:06] folly like paul would say
[1:39:09] the weather's real hot did you ever see
[1:39:10] sheep
[1:39:12] they won't separate themselves and one
[1:39:14] be at one place and one at another
[1:39:16] right in the heat of the day the sheep
[1:39:19] will all stand together
[1:39:22] i thought about that sitting there in
[1:39:23] manila in the pastor's home
[1:39:26] sitting there with all those people
[1:39:27] crammed in a room
[1:39:30] amen right in the heat of the day those
[1:39:33] countries where it's that much harder
[1:39:34] they fellowship that much more
[1:39:38] i talked to a man i want to go to his
[1:39:40] church sometime in the philippines that
[1:39:42] it i'll preach a youth a tent meeting
[1:39:45] there
[1:39:45] or a meeting in a tabernacle they're
[1:39:47] outside and this man had traveled seven
[1:39:50] hours by bus
[1:39:51] a pastor to be there in that meeting and
[1:39:53] was going to go back that
[1:39:55] saturday night and go back and preach i
[1:39:56] believe to his people
[1:39:58] and he made an effort to be there but
[1:40:01] right in the heat of the day
[1:40:02] they get that much closer together right
[1:40:05] in the heat of the day
[1:40:06] the sheep will all stand together you
[1:40:08] know what they're doing they're making
[1:40:09] shade one for another
[1:40:11] they're having fellowship and wouldn't
[1:40:13] it be good if all god's sheep
[1:40:15] when the heat was on would stand
[1:40:18] together
[1:40:19] when the trials are real hard and the
[1:40:22] heat is on
[1:40:23] and everything going on everywhere if
[1:40:26] all of god's little sheep
[1:40:28] would just stand together we'd have the
[1:40:31] coolness
[1:40:31] of the shade of each other the comfort
[1:40:34] to lean upon each other
[1:40:38] he said now someone said is that
[1:40:40] necessary brother branham
[1:40:42] it certainly is is that necessary
[1:40:47] it certainly is what we do as a church
[1:40:50] is necessary not just the services by
[1:40:52] the way
[1:40:53] but our fellowship together is necessary
[1:40:56] don't cut it short and i know some
[1:40:58] people there's always some people in
[1:41:00] every congregation
[1:41:01] that never want to go to the meal or
[1:41:03] something like that and it's okay you
[1:41:04] don't have to it's not a requirement
[1:41:06] but it's such a benefit to the body of
[1:41:08] christ to be able to stand in the shade
[1:41:12] and fellowship one with one with another
[1:41:15] he said there's nothing like having a
[1:41:16] good dependable friend
[1:41:19] he said that when the troubles are
[1:41:20] blazing the heat's on
[1:41:22] you can go to this friend and sit down
[1:41:24] and just explain it to them talk it over
[1:41:27] in personal confidence and then kneel
[1:41:29] down and pray together
[1:41:31] and know that this person is a god a
[1:41:33] good god-saved man or woman
[1:41:35] that you can put confidence in he said
[1:41:37] oh it's good to do that come let us
[1:41:39] reason together say it's the scripture
[1:41:41] and i love the way brother brandon puts
[1:41:42] this he said or
[1:41:43] come let us stand together
[1:41:48] i don't want to say anything i'm just
[1:41:51] going to stand with you
[1:41:52] you've been through a hard time you've
[1:41:54] lost a loved one i don't have to say
[1:41:55] anything i'll just stand there with you
[1:41:59] you realize what that means i'll just
[1:42:01] stand there with you
[1:42:02] and and just me standing there just me
[1:42:04] being there
[1:42:05] just you being in the service just you
[1:42:07] being at the function or whatever the
[1:42:09] fellowship the meetings that we're gonna
[1:42:10] have and and just you being there bring
[1:42:14] shade to somebody
[1:42:16] come let us stand together amen
[1:42:19] oh if we could only do that today stand
[1:42:21] together just be there
[1:42:22] he said and i noticed another thing when
[1:42:23] i see sheep in a cold country
[1:42:26] when the all the sheep he said the
[1:42:28] blizzards come to break the wind all
[1:42:30] those little sheep will come from one
[1:42:32] side of the field to the other
[1:42:33] huddle up together he said it keeps each
[1:42:36] other warm
[1:42:37] the warmth from each body helps warm the
[1:42:38] other and i think when the church gets
[1:42:41] real cold and indifferent
[1:42:42] god's sheep ought to kind of huddle up
[1:42:44] together and pray for each other
[1:42:48] how to pray for each other when i was a
[1:42:52] kid
[1:42:52] at brother brown's we used to sing when
[1:42:55] you
[1:42:55] when i pray or when you pray will you
[1:42:57] pray for me
[1:42:58] for i need his love and his care
[1:43:03] when i pray i will pray for you for you
[1:43:05] need his love and his care
[1:43:08] amen amen if we could just make that
[1:43:10] effort
[1:43:11] to come it means so much to pray for one
[1:43:14] another
[1:43:15] in the heat or the cold when he said the
[1:43:18] warmth of real good christian fellowship
[1:43:20] oh it means so much
[1:43:21] david spoke of it in the first psalm and
[1:43:23] said blessed is the man that said it's
[1:43:25] not in the seat of the scornful
[1:43:26] standeth in the way of sinners and
[1:43:28] brother brown types is to fellowship we
[1:43:30] think about it as
[1:43:31] someone who doesn't do bad things but
[1:43:34] brother brother said it's more than that
[1:43:36] blessed is the man who doesn't walk in
[1:43:37] the way of the ungodly what does that
[1:43:39] mean he's walking with the godly
[1:43:42] right if he don't sit in the seat of the
[1:43:44] scornful it means he's sitting with the
[1:43:46] people
[1:43:46] of god he's not standing in the way of
[1:43:49] sinners he's sitting there with the
[1:43:50] redeemed
[1:43:52] but his delight is in the law of the
[1:43:53] lord and the law does he meditate day
[1:43:55] and night and he shall be like a tree
[1:43:58] that's planted by the rivers of water
[1:44:00] and his leaves shall not wither
[1:44:02] whatsoever he doeth that shall prosper
[1:44:08] are we restored back i've got written
[1:44:12] down here conclusion my daughter
[1:44:15] got a hold of my sermon and she wrote
[1:44:18] here there is no conclusion the sermon
[1:44:20] never ends
[1:44:28] but we are going to close this morning
[1:44:33] you see there's something about a
[1:44:34] christian that is
[1:44:36] only satisfied by fellowship with other
[1:44:38] believers
[1:44:44] let me leave this with you this morning
[1:44:46] romans 15
[1:44:47] 24 i'm becoming less of an evangelist
[1:44:51] all the time you all forgive me
[1:44:55] romans 15 24 he said when so ever i take
[1:44:58] my journey into spain this is paul
[1:45:01] speaking and to kind of set the scene
[1:45:03] he's
[1:45:04] he's going to take an offering
[1:45:08] from the gentile saints to the jewish
[1:45:10] believers in jerusalem to the poor
[1:45:12] jewish believers who are in a famine
[1:45:14] during that time
[1:45:16] and being persecuted as well and he said
[1:45:20] whenever i take my journey into spain i
[1:45:21] will come to you
[1:45:23] for i trust to see you in my journey not
[1:45:25] just to leave this here with you
[1:45:28] you know brother branham wanted to do
[1:45:29] certain things he wanted to get a tent
[1:45:30] and put and pitch it in jeffersonville
[1:45:32] he wanted to do that paul wanted to go
[1:45:34] to spain you know he never did
[1:45:36] just because the prophet wants to do
[1:45:38] something doesn't mean it's to saith the
[1:45:39] lord
[1:45:41] right paul never went to spain but he
[1:45:43] said i will come to you for i trust to
[1:45:45] see you in my journey
[1:45:47] and to be brought on my way the other
[1:45:48] word by you
[1:45:50] if first i be somewhat filled
[1:45:54] with your company that's kind of a
[1:45:57] difficult phrase
[1:45:58] but paul was saying that
[1:46:02] i want to make sure i'm there long
[1:46:03] enough
[1:46:05] to fill up the the desire that i have
[1:46:08] for fellowship
[1:46:10] it's like i got a bucket and it needs to
[1:46:13] be filled up with fellowship
[1:46:16] and if i'm not there long enough he said
[1:46:18] i want to make sure i'm there long
[1:46:19] enough that i can be somewhat
[1:46:21] filled because i can never be fully
[1:46:24] filled
[1:46:25] he leaves the the idea that i can never
[1:46:27] be fully filled up
[1:46:29] with fellowship until we get over there
[1:46:33] there's just not time and plus we live
[1:46:36] in this flesh it hurts
[1:46:41] makes it hard to sit in church makes it
[1:46:44] hard to fellowship
[1:46:46] makes us gripe at one another
[1:46:49] right but he said i want to be at least
[1:46:53] somewhat
[1:46:54] filled by your company
[1:46:57] i just want to be close to you i want to
[1:46:59] spend some time with you now
[1:47:00] it's interesting because paul would have
[1:47:02] grown up being taught to hate the romans
[1:47:09] it would have been like a boy from the
[1:47:11] extreme deep south
[1:47:13] going to a a person a black person from
[1:47:17] the hood
[1:47:19] and this boy from the south has been
[1:47:21] taught to maybe
[1:47:23] from the deep south and i know it's not
[1:47:25] as prevalent as people think it is most
[1:47:27] of us
[1:47:28] you know are not raised that way we're
[1:47:29] not raised as much a racist but
[1:47:31] there are people who are raised that way
[1:47:33] to hate people of another color
[1:47:35] and he's he's coming from this deep
[1:47:37] south
[1:47:38] mentality where this deep racist
[1:47:40] mentality where he's like he's like i
[1:47:42] i've been taught to hate this person
[1:47:44] and coming together with this guy that
[1:47:46] come right out of the hood
[1:47:48] and he's coming together with him and
[1:47:49] saying oh i just want to be close to you
[1:47:52] i just want to be around you i want to
[1:47:54] spend some time with you
[1:47:57] what would make a man do that
[1:48:01] what would that why would he do that the
[1:48:03] leaves were on the tree
[1:48:07] in that early church the leaves were on
[1:48:09] the tree the fellowship hadn't been
[1:48:10] taken away
[1:48:12] and so there was a desire in the heart
[1:48:14] of paul why because they served the same
[1:48:16] god
[1:48:17] they had the same the same focus
[1:48:20] the same same goals
[1:48:23] to see others saved and he hears about
[1:48:26] this group in rome
[1:48:27] and he writes them a letter and he says
[1:48:28] i've never been there but i want to go
[1:48:31] and when i get there
[1:48:33] i want to make sure i get filled up with
[1:48:35] your company
[1:48:37] why did he want to see them so badly he
[1:48:39] had a longing for fellowship
[1:48:43] he could be somewhat filled by
[1:48:45] fellowship over here realizing
[1:48:48] that that fellowship could never really
[1:48:49] be perfect
[1:48:51] but it will be over there
[1:48:56] i read a poem wednesday musicians go
[1:48:59] ahead and come
[1:49:01] i read a poem on wednesday called walk
[1:49:03] slowly with grief and
[1:49:04] part of it was that you you have to give
[1:49:08] yourself time to grieve
[1:49:10] and you've got to give other people time
[1:49:14] to grieve and you've got to forgive
[1:49:16] yourselves
[1:49:17] yourself for conversations that you wish
[1:49:21] you had made
[1:49:22] wish you'd had and phone calls that you
[1:49:25] wish you'd
[1:49:25] made and never did
[1:49:30] because there's there's times there's
[1:49:31] things and i'm sure every one of us can
[1:49:32] go back in our own memories in our own
[1:49:34] mind and think of
[1:49:35] places where we should have talked to
[1:49:36] somebody more i had that with brother
[1:49:38] brown
[1:49:39] and he was always there when i called
[1:49:41] him but i've been meaning to call him
[1:49:43] for
[1:49:43] a few months and get to talk to him
[1:49:46] before he passed away
[1:49:48] that's my fault and yet you got to
[1:49:51] forgive yourself for that
[1:49:53] because there's coming a time of perfect
[1:49:54] fellowship
[1:49:56] there's going to be a day in a place
[1:49:59] where you can fellowship
[1:50:01] without any reservations the leaves
[1:50:04] are going to be on the tree but you know
[1:50:06] what i believe they're here now
[1:50:08] the restoration prophet come why why
[1:50:11] can't we have fellowship
[1:50:14] if malachi 4 and that's the great
[1:50:16] question is malachi 4 fulfilled in our
[1:50:18] time
[1:50:18] if it is then our hearts have been
[1:50:21] restored back to fellowship
[1:50:23] amen can we play in moments like these
[1:50:28] let's bow our heads together
[1:50:31] you forgive me a little tired today but
[1:50:34] i just wanted to talk to you about these
[1:50:36] things
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:43] we serve a very real god
[1:50:48] and we we are very real people maybe
[1:50:52] there's something in your life today
[1:50:53] that
[1:50:55] you can look at is that that weakness
[1:50:57] that
[1:50:58] maybe it's going to church maybe it's
[1:51:00] not maybe it's something else
[1:51:02] maybe you just have a hard time getting
[1:51:04] along with people
[1:51:06] it's just something in your nature it's
[1:51:08] just that way
[1:51:09] [Music]
[1:51:10] maybe you have a hard time forgiving
[1:51:12] people forgiveness will
[1:51:14] unforgiveness will destroy you
[1:51:16] bitterness will destroy you in
[1:51:18] everything you touch
[1:51:22] don't let that be a weak place
[1:51:25] hear what a prophet of god was telling
[1:51:26] you not me but a prophet of god was
[1:51:28] speaking to you
[1:51:29] and telling you don't let that be a weak
[1:51:31] place maybe you have a problem where
[1:51:33] you you don't read your bible enough you
[1:51:35] don't pray that whatever it is
[1:51:36] don't let that be a weak place guard
[1:51:39] that spot do what you have to do
[1:51:42] to take care of that because the chain
[1:51:45] is only as strong
[1:51:46] as its weakest link i don't want no weak
[1:51:49] links in my fellowship with god
[1:51:51] i want to be exactly the kind of
[1:51:53] christian that he wants me to be
[1:51:55] and this is why we come to church we
[1:51:57] come to be washed out to be cleansed
[1:52:00] we come to hear from god i was convicted
[1:52:02] wednesday night even by the sermon the
[1:52:04] things that
[1:52:04] brother allen was saying and just
[1:52:06] repented a little bit in my own heart
[1:52:08] lord
[1:52:08] i want to be committed maybe this
[1:52:11] morning you feel the same way you raise
[1:52:12] your hands with me and say
[1:52:14] i i i want to guard that weak place i
[1:52:17] want to make sure
[1:52:18] i wrap myself in the word i want to make
[1:52:20] sure that
[1:52:21] i'm not responding out of the flesh but
[1:52:23] i'm doing things because god wants me to
[1:52:25] do them
[1:52:27] heavenly father lord jesus i have my own
[1:52:30] hands raised this morning
[1:52:32] lord and i'm sure there's some sitting
[1:52:33] in their living room or wherever
[1:52:36] lord of different families that couldn't
[1:52:37] come lord maybe they're
[1:52:40] raising their hands as well we're at
[1:52:42] that time
[1:52:43] lord where we want to be right lord we
[1:52:46] know the leaves have been restored back
[1:52:48] to the tree by malachi 4
[1:52:50] may we be restored may our heart be
[1:52:52] turned back lord
[1:52:54] every day by your message that's why you
[1:52:56] sent it lord
[1:52:57] if there's a weak spot if there's
[1:52:59] something there a weak link in that
[1:53:01] chain oh god there's something
[1:53:03] puzzling to us something maybe we don't
[1:53:04] really understand
[1:53:06] help us to guard that spot make sure it
[1:53:09] doesn't become
[1:53:10] something that'll take us out of the
[1:53:11] house of god something that'll destroy
[1:53:13] our lives destroy our families
[1:53:16] oh god i pray for these that have lost
[1:53:18] loved ones lord
[1:53:20] some of them i just stood there with
[1:53:21] them that's all i could do
[1:53:24] i don't know what to say but lord if you
[1:53:27] would just come as only you can and
[1:53:28] comfort those families
[1:53:31] oh god i prayed lord
[1:53:35] as your prophet said that family was
[1:53:37] like a wheel and
[1:53:38] every time someone is lost it's like a
[1:53:40] spoke it's gone out of the wheel
[1:53:43] when we get to the other side we want
[1:53:45] that wheel to be complete again
[1:53:48] oh god we just we just think about the
[1:53:50] families the different ones lord
[1:53:52] i want all of my family to be there oh
[1:53:55] god somehow i don't see how you can do
[1:53:57] it
[1:53:58] but i know you can lord maybe i don't
[1:54:01] have enough faith
[1:54:03] to envision it lord but you you're able
[1:54:05] to do it
[1:54:07] lord and so i trust you today you'll
[1:54:10] take everyone that's
[1:54:11] lost every spoke that's missing lord and
[1:54:15] somehow it'll be there on that day
[1:54:16] somehow in your great mercy lord
[1:54:18] i'm so glad that you know more than we
[1:54:20] know i'm so glad lord that you reach
[1:54:23] farther than we can reach
[1:54:25] so glad you've forgiven away lord that
[1:54:27] we could never forgive
[1:54:30] because you don't just forgive our sin
[1:54:32] you forget about it
[1:54:34] you put it in the sea of your
[1:54:35] forgetfulness and so it never happened
[1:54:37] in the first place
[1:54:39] we're so grateful for that lord and even
[1:54:42] in your mercy lord you
[1:54:43] you provide a way even for those maybe
[1:54:45] that didn't do right
[1:54:47] didn't live right but god somehow even
[1:54:49] the ones
[1:54:50] maybe we think won't be there i pray
[1:54:52] there will be grace for them on that day
[1:54:55] but oh god as we serve you today we want
[1:54:58] to serve you with a whole heart
[1:55:00] we don't want to fall into hell lord
[1:55:03] because our
[1:55:04] families fall apart because that weak
[1:55:06] link in the chain was us
[1:55:09] oh god i pray you'd help us to take a
[1:55:11] stand for the word
[1:55:13] and to stand together lord in this end
[1:55:16] time heat lord may we stand together and
[1:55:18] provide
[1:55:19] shade to one another the leaves back on
[1:55:22] the tree
[1:55:23] i pray you'd grant it today deal with
[1:55:25] every heart deal with us lord
[1:55:28] oh god don't i don't want to
[1:55:31] pass this up lord but just just deal
[1:55:34] with our hearts
[1:55:35] root out may your holy spirit root out
[1:55:37] every every root of bitterness
