[applause] Them songs this evening. Let's just stand together. We invite Brother Job out this evening. Amen. He got a long drive ahead of him. Amen. And so just looking forward to the word of Lord. Let's sing that. Uh you are my refuge. Amen. You are my sanctuary. Amen. Believe that'll go really [music] well with what he's speaking on today. So amen. Let's just sing it out to him as brother Joe comes. Oh you are my refuge. You are my sanctuary. [singing] All right. Sing it to him now. You're my hiding place. [music] You are my refuge. And when the storm is raging underneath your wings, I will rejoice and sing. [music and singing] You are my refuge. Oh, you are my refuge. [music] You're my [singing] sanctuary when I am afraid my [music] high you Aren't you thankful that you have a refuge? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have a rock. You have a shelter. You have a strong tower. [music] &gt;&gt; You have an absolute. You have a tiepost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a blessed people we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are very blessed to have a hiding place in this hour. Let's just go to him in prayer. Father, we rejoice in knowing, Lord, no matter what befalls us on this side of eternity, Lord, we're sheltered in the wings of the Almighty, we have peace in our storms, Lord. We have the assurance in the gable end of our souls that God, we may not see the end, but we know the one who does. We're here today, fathers, your children, asking, Lord, for wisdom, direction, leadership, guidance. God, open up our hearts that we may receive your word. [music] Lord, anoint our ears to hear what this spirit would say to the church. Father, anoint these lips to speak only those things that would edify you and build up your bride. So, Lord God, we just come before you tonight. thankful for another service, another opportunity to serve you and to worship you. Lord, we just pray God you'd move tonight. Maybe not in a way of an altar call, Lord, or or however you would move, but Lord, we just pray that you would move in their hearts and their lives to see the reality of this word and that through this word, God, they can find their place. they can find that shelter, they can find that peace. So we commit this service to you, Lord. We ask for your hand of mercy to be upon us now in Jesus name. If you have your Bibles tonight, [clears throat] we're going to have you look in Psalms 27. Very, very, very familiar scripture to us who are believers. Psalms 27 and verse one. And I want to pick back up on the same title that we preached this morning. Thou art my hiding place. And try to kind of bring this to a a conclusion. Here's David is speaking. He said, "The Lord is the light of my salvation. Otherwise, he's the illumination. He's my joy. Whom shall I fear?" You think about what God is to you tonight. What have we to fear? &gt;&gt; That he's the light of my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength. And that word there means safety, protection, refuge, and stronghold. &gt;&gt; So he is the strength. He is the refuge. He is the stronghold. He's the protection of my life. In whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and they fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war shall rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after, that I may dwell. That word dwell means to sit, to inhabit, to marry, to abide in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me, and he shall set me upon a rock. God bless you. You can have your seats tonight. Not [clears throat] going to hold you too long. Like uh brother David said, we have a long drive back tonight. So if I don't shake any of your hands, just know that we were blessed to see you again. Uh it's always a pleasure to be here. Lifelong friends. And uh I was telling the brothers in the back, this is where I learned to preach. preached in many of services right here at Word of Life Tabernacle. And uh you guys, many of you that know me and go way back, you were very longsuffering for a young man just learning how to cut his teeth and preach. But I I pray by God's grace that we have matured along the way and we'll be able to speak something to you this evening that'll feed you. But we find here in the scriptures, the Bible would tell us in Psalms 27 and verse4, in the time or this word here actually means a period or a season of trouble. And it seems like we go through seasons of calamity and seasons of difficulties. But we have a promise that in that time of trouble, he is going to hide us. That word there means to cover us. Cover us in his pavilion. And that word pavilion there is his chamber. And it's given reference to a a wedding chamber, a bridal chamber, you know, it's a not just any room of the house, but it's that special room, that designated room that not just anybody can enter into. It's it's a privileged person that can enter into that place. And here we find to hide in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle of his his protection. And he's going to set me upon a rock. Notice here that word rock there as we are well assure of and well know it's a revelation. So and brother Brandon would take this Psalms here and he would take Psalms 27 and he WOULD BEGIN TO PREACH THE RAPTURE MESSAGE BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS THAT IF THE BELIEVER CAN EVER CATCH THAT REVELATION THAT IF THEY'RE IN CHRIST AND CHRIST IS IN THEM THEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT COMES THEIR WAY THAT'S GOING TO SHAKE THEM. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO MOVE THEM FROM WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE WHY? BECAUSE THEY ARE HIDDEN IN CHRIST AND CHRIST IS HIDDEN HIS LIFE IN THEM. &gt;&gt; But we must understand now I think a lot of times I was sharing in the back just recently and you know for many years as I matured into the message it seems like for the most part the message as we CALL IT IS ALL BEEN ABOUT BROTHER BRANDHAM AND I don't say that lightly. I say that with all due respect, BUT WE MADE THE MESSAGE ABOUT ONE MAN AND WE'VE FOREGONE AND WE'VE GOT AWAY FROM THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE BECAUSE A NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE IS WHAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU AND TAKE YOU INTO A RAPTURE. NOT JUST HAVING AN IDEA OF A MAN, NOT HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE OF A MAN, NOT HAVING JUST AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A MAN, BUT TO HAVE THAT NEW BIRTH IS WHERE IT LIES TODAY. AND WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH? THEY ASKED BROTHER BRANDON, "WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH?" IT'S THE PERSONAL REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST to you. &gt;&gt; A PERSONAL REVELATION, &gt;&gt; NOT A SECONDHANDED REVELATION. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S CHRIST IN YOU. THAT'S THE REVELATION that the church was built on. &gt;&gt; And that's why he's preached. He would preach the rapture message. If you ever get that personal revelation, then nothing's going to keep you from a rapture. &gt;&gt; Young person, you may go to camp meeting after camp meeting after camp meeting after camp meeting. But until you have that new birth experience, &gt;&gt; let me tell you, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WALKED AMONG US. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MEN WHO USED TO PREACH THIS MESSAGE, BUT THEY NEVER GOT THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE. AND TODAY, THEY DON'T WALK WITH US. TODAY. THEY ARE AGAINST US. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, GOD HAS CALLED A PEOPLE TO HAVE A NEW BIRTH. AND HE'S GOING TO HIDE THEIR HIS LIFE INSIDE OF THEM. AND NOTICE, NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY ARE HIDDEN IN CHRIST JESUS. SO NO MATTER WHAT COMES THEIR WAY, THEY HAVE THE REVELATION THAT I'M GOING TO TAKE A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; I LIKE HOW BROTHER WOULD TELL US. HE SAID, "THE MESSAGE CALLS THE BRIDE TOGETHER." &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE SEE WHAT A HIDING PLACE WE HAVE. MARRIED TO THE VIRTUOUS SON OF GOD. NOW NOTICE, AND I like how he says it, we never sin in the first place. &gt;&gt; WHERE WERE YOU AT IN THE FIRST PLACE? IN THE THOUGHTS OF GOD, IN THE MIND OF GOD. AND THINK ABOUT IT, NO OTHER AGE, NO OTHER GIFT, NO OTHER MAN BUT IN THIS HOUR, IN THIS AGE, GOD SENT A MAN HERE THAT WENT INTO THE VERY BACK PARTS OF GOD'S THINKING, TO THE BACK PART OF GOD'S MIND AND BEGIN TO PULL OUT THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD AND PREACH IT TO A PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; In the back part of God's mind, he had a bride. He had a people. as I begin to preach and study on this hiding place and WE FIND DAVID SAYING, "THOU ART MY HIDING PLACE." And we know that the SCRIPTURES CAN BE TWOFOLD. I BELIEVE IT WAS GOD SPEAKING TO DAVID, TELLING DAVID, DAVID, THAT THOU ART my hiding place because God is hidden in simplicity. &gt;&gt; He's hidden in a PEOPLE &gt;&gt; HERE IN HARDY, ARKANSAS. OH, YOU MAY NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT TO GOD, YOU'RE EVERYTHING. AND GOD HAS HIDDEN HIS LIFE IN YOU THROUGH A PERSONAL REVELATION, THROUGH A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT TO GET TO. DON'T GET THEM TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PROPHET. GET THEM TO THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; THE KNOWLEDGE OF A PROPHET IS GREAT. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE and if you get to THE NEW BIRTH EXPERIENCE, you will see the prophet's position, &gt;&gt; but you'll also see your position, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at another thought that I'll preach at some point. Looking at the unnamed servant in Genesis 24. You believe HERE ABRAHAM, HIS HIGHEST SERVANT. When you GO LOOK IN GENESIS 24, THIS IS SENDING FORTH OF ELEAZAR. But in Genesis 24, the longest chapter in Genesis, he never gives him a name. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because it's not ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT THE MAN. IT'S ALWAYS GO GET ME A BRIDE FOR MY SON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE ENTIRE GENESIS 24 WAS ABOUT. IT WASN'T ABOUT ELIJAH. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT A MAN. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THIS MESSAGE HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT A MAN. IT'S BEEN ABOUT GET A BRIDE. CALL [screaming] HER OUT OF SIN. CALL HER OUT OF DENOMINATIONS. CALL HER OUT OF THOSE DARK DENOMINATIONS. CALL ME A [screaming] BRIDE. BRING HER TO ME. DON'T GO TO THE THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. CALL HER OUT &gt;&gt; OF MY PEOPLE. BUT WE'VE MADE IT &gt;&gt; TO THE SHAME OF THE MESSAGE. WE MADE IT ABOUT A MAN AND PEOPLE ARE SHIPWRECKED down the way &gt;&gt; and we made it about oh if you see a prophet if you believe the message then you got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And then when the hard times come we spoke about this morning brother Danny they get shook &gt;&gt; because they don't have an experience. &gt;&gt; They only have a head knowledge. This is what we do. THIS IS CHURCH. THIS IS WHAT WE LEARN. IT SOUNDS GOOD. IT ALL FITS TOGETHER. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A RAPTURE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PREDESTINATED PEOPLE. WE TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTED OF GOD THAT WERE IN THE BACK PART OF GOD'S MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND IN THIS HOUR, GOD SENT YOU A PROPHET TO DO WHAT? TO MANIFEST. TO REVEAL THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT A people we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen how your prophet says this and I want to be very respectful because I don't want you to I don't want to come across as I don't believe the message or I don't believe God sent a prophet because I will do I want to be very respectful but we got to place these things in the right order. &gt;&gt; Now let me go back to Genesis. This is not even in my notes. When you look in Genesis 24 this track that Eleazar had to make was 900 mile journey. Now if you go and you study the scriptures, you look before at the time before Ishmael was born, there was no heir to Abraham. But my servant, this Eleazar of Damascus. &gt;&gt; So he was the ONLY ONE. AND SO LET'S JUST PER SAY HE WAS WITH Abraham 10 years or five years prior to Ishmael's birth. At the time of Genesis 24, Isaac was 20. He was 40 years old. So that put Ishmael at 55, 54. That put the the servant at 65. So he's not a young man. And we don't know how old he was when he came. Let's say he was 20. So now, NOT ONLY IS HE 65, HE'S AN 85 YEAR OLD MAN ABOUT TO MAKE A 900MILE JOURNEY FOR ONE PURPOSE. HE NEVER TOLD UH REBECCA ABOUT HIMSELF. HE NEVER TOLD HER ABOUT WHAT HE LIKES. HE NEVER TOLD HER ABOUT WHAT HE HAS BACK HOME. BUT EVERYTHING THAT HE EXPRESSED TO REBECCA WAS ABOUT MY MY MASTER, MY MASTER, MY MASTER, MY MASTER. HE SAID THE WORD MASTER 22 TIMES IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS 24 CUZ IT WAS NEVER ABOUT ELEAZAR. BUT IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT MY MASTER. MY MASTER'S GOT A SON. MY MASTER'S GOT A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HEELS. MY MASTER'S GOT WEALTH UNTOLD. MY MASTER'S GOT HEALING. MY MASTER'S GOT DELIVERANCE. MY MASTER'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST. MY MASTER HAS A HIDING PLACE. MY MASTER [screaming] HAS IT ALL. &gt;&gt; HE HAD TO EXPRESS THE LOVE FOR HIS MASTER SO [screaming] MUCH THAT REBECCA WOULD LEAVE EVERYTHING SHE'S EVER KNOWN. &gt;&gt; THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE, WALK AWAY FROM HER FAMILY, WALK AWAY FROM HER LIFESTYLE, [screaming] WALK AWAY FROM THE BAR, WALK AWAY FROM THE DRUGS, WALK AWAY FROM THE SIN, WALK AWAY FROM THE ONLY CHURCH SHE'S EVER KNOWN TO FOLLOW THIS ONE. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; And that's the way the message has got to be preached. Don't take me to Ezer. Take me to Christ. &gt;&gt; Take me to him. &gt;&gt; I left everything &gt;&gt; for him. &gt;&gt; I thank God for the message he sent the servant who had no name because they're never about the servant, &gt;&gt; but it was about the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother B would tell us they marched out, referring back to Israel, THEY MARCHED OUT of Egypt on the strength of the testimony of this prophet with their pillar of fire over him because he was sent. God had proved that he was WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; THEY MARCHED OUT UNDER THE testimony of what he declared. &gt;&gt; And you would have thought they would have been complete believers after the Red Sea. See, he called a nation &gt;&gt; out of a nation. The Holy Spirit, BROTHER B SAYS, IS CALLING A BRIDE OUT OF A CHURCH. A CHURCH OUT OF A CHURCH MEMBERS FROM EVERY DENOMINATION, MAKING UP THE BRIDE. YOU SEE, THE BRIDE NOW IS THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE RAPTURE. THAT ALONE, NOTHING BUT THE BRIDE, THE ELECTED ONES FORNOWN BY GOD FROM THE BEGINNING, THE FATHER'S spiritual genes. And that's what we're here for today. Why did God send a message to call a church out of a church? To call a bride out of dark denominationalism. &gt;&gt; What did HE DO? HE IF HE CALLED you out, church, he's taking you somewhere. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; HE DON'T CALL YOU out to leave you. &gt;&gt; He doesn't call you out so you f excuse me, you f for yourself, but he's called you out of Egypt to take you into &gt;&gt; Canaan. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, he calls the bride out of these things. And what's he do? He takes us to the opening of the word. &gt;&gt; Think about that. The opening of the word. Now, we've had seven church ages. We're in the final church age. But never before until this end time have we've had the fullness, the opening of the word. And so we're speaking about a hiding place. So it can only come into manifestation at the end. The true hiding place as your prophet would preach a token message after the opening of the seals. He said outside of the opening of the seals, the most ordained message that I've ever preached was the token message. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NOW IT WASN'T JUST A GOOSEBUMP. NOW IT WASN'T JUST A SHOUT. NOW, IT WASN'T JUST A A YOU KNOW, JUST A AN UH THE HOLY GHOST ON THE FLESH, BUT NOW IT'S THE PERSON OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT'S THE TOKEN LIFE IN THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT'S OUR TRUE HIDING PLACE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S OUR TRUE SAFETY. OUTSIDE OF THAT TOKEN LIFE, YOUNG PERSON, YOU'RE NOT SAVED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OUTSIDE OF THAT TOKEN, &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT SAFE. BUT NOTICE THEY CAME OUT ON THE testimony of a prophet. &gt;&gt; We're going somewhere. &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S THREE STAGES FOR THE STEWARD OF THE JOURNEY. SO THEY LEFT EGYPT UNDER JUSTIFICATION believing a word. They separated themselves FROM THE EGYPTIANS AND COME OUT. THEY CROSSED THE RED SEA, KILLED THE THINGS THAT WERE BEHIND THEM, WHICH WAS THE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH THE BLOOD THAT KILLS HUMAN DESIRES OF EVIL. THE SECOND STAGE OF THE JOURNEY. BUT THE THIRD STAGE WAS WHEN THEY CROSSED INTO JORDAN. SO WHAT DOES JORDAN REPRESENT? DEATH. Death to self. &gt;&gt; Well, you die out to your OWN IDEAS. YOU DIE OUT TO YOUR OWN HABITS. YOU DIE TO YOURSELF. AND BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE MOVING INTO CANAAN LAND, THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; THE TRUE HIDING PLACE FOR THE BELIEVER WAS NOT IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE JOURNEY. IT WASN'T IN THE SECOND STAGE OF THE JOURNEY, BUT IT'S IN THE THIRD STAGE OF THE JOURNEY WHERE ALL THE PROMISES LAY. THEY LAY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF JORDAN IN CANAAN'S LAND. AND THAT'S WHY GOD SENT [screaming] US A PROPHET WAS TO TAKE US NOT ONLY OUT OF THROUGH THE FIRST POOL MINISTRY THROUGH THE THE GIFT OF THE SIGN IN THE HAND AND THE DISCERNING THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE SECOND POOL, BUT [screaming] IN THE THIRD POOL. AND LET ME TELL YOU, THE THIRD POOL IS MORE THAN SPEAKING SQUIRRELS INTO EXISTENCE. THE THIRD POOL MINISTRY IS THE OPENING OF THE WORD. IS PLACING THE PEOPLE IN THE HIDING PLACE OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; All the promises lay in that Canaan land. &gt;&gt; Brother had a vision, had a dream. This is about 3:00 in the morning, I suppose. And I had gotten up and I looked in front of me. [clears throat] THERE WAS COMING DOWN THE JORDAN. And because I was coming down to the Jordan, looked like I was standing on the map of Palestine. And I was coming down to Jordan. IT SEEMED LIKE I COULD HEAR the song, I'm going down to the Jordan. Someone was singing it. And as I drew near the river, I looked back and I seen which way had come. And I was 23 of the way there to the Jordan. And I looked across JORDAN AND I SAID, "OH, PRAISE GOD." Just on the other side is where all the promises lay. SEE, EVERY PROMISE lays in the promised land. So, we've seen the first pool. We've seen the second pool. We've had we've seen the the the the third pool, which I believe firmly is the hiding place of the believer, where we're hidden into the word and the word hidden for the word, by the word, in the word. And what a refuge that we have. So no matter what shakes, how hard the storms sail, no matter what life travails against us and tries to throw upon us, and as I just listened to the testimony of Gabe and his wife and with their baby and the situation there, you know, WE GO THROUGH A LOT OF HARDSHIPS ALONG THE JOURNEY AS WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS MORNING. BUT AS LONG AS WE HAVE AN ANCHOR, AS LONG AS WE HAVE A HIDING PLACE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE GO THROUGH AS LONG AS WE KNOW THE ONE THAT'S HOLDING OUR HAND. AND HE SAID THE THIRD PULL. NOTICE NOW &gt;&gt; THE THIRD PULL IS THE OPENING OF THE WORD. THE MYSTERIES REVEALED. AND THERE'S NO HIGHER ORDER TO REVEAL THE WORD THAN PROPHETS. BUT THE ONLY WAY A PROPHET CAN BE VINDICATED IS BY THE WORD. AND I CAN SAFELY SAY THIS MORNING, WE ARE SITTING UNDER THE MESSAGE OF A VINDICATED PROPHET SENT BY ALMIGHTY GOD. NOT TO JUST CALL YOU OUT, BUT TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE. AND HE'S TAKING US IN TO THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST AND TO A BODY CHANGE, CHURCH. YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING TO STAY HERE. GOD IS GOING TO COMPLETELY CHANGE HIS BODY. ONE MINUTE WE'RE GOING TO BE MORTAL. AND THE NEXT MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO STEP [laughter] OUT INTO A NEW BODY, A WELL BODY, A SUPERNATURAL BODY, [screaming] NEVER TO GET OLD, NEVER TO GET SICK, NEVER TO HAD A BAD DAY, NEVER TO GO THROUGH A TRIAL, A NEW BODY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED. THAT'S WHY GOD SENT A MESSAGE. THIS THIS IS LIFE AIN'T an all it's not everything that we WANT IT TO BE. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Thank God there's more in store for the believer. &gt;&gt; He said the third pull was the opening of them seven seals to reveal the hidden truths that's been sealed in the word. &gt;&gt; So it's more than speaking squirrels, &gt;&gt; but the revealing of the third pool was Listen to people in their hiding place. All the promises lay right there. See, that's why even a prophet would take Joshua and he take the book of Ephesians and he say they paralleled together because he's trying to place a people into that land, into their possession, into their homeland. But when we find Israel, they came out. [clears throat] They came out on the testimony of a prophet. They left Egypt. And we look here in the scriptures when they left Egypt, they wandered in the wilderness and they came to Mount Si after two months. And they stayed around Mount Si for maybe a year or so, just a little over a year. And they DWELT THERE. SO ALONG THE JOURNEY THERE'S STOPPING AND GOING AND STOPPING AND GOING AND STOPPING and going. How many's ever stopped and went? Stopped and went, stopped and went. Hey, keep going. Keep going. KEEP GOING. DON'T STOP AND SET DOWN ROOTS OUT THERE IN THE IN THE LAND OF UH OF the wilderness out there. BUT WE FIND MANY OF US US as and I say that not to say the church here locally but MANY OF US AS MESSAGE BELIEVERS WE HAVE left out on THE SAME PROMISE THE SAME TESTIMONY OF A PROPHET. WE LEFT THE DENOMINATIONAL LIFE. WE LEFT THE SINFUL LIFE AND ALL WE'VE DONE IS WANDERED IN THE WILDERNESS. WONDER IF IT'S FOR ME. WONDER IF MY KIDS CAN HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. WONDER IF I'LL EVER BE SAVED. WONDER IF THIS HABIT'S EVER GOING TO BREAK. WONDER, WONDER, WONDER, WONDER. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR US TO STOP WONDERING, CHURCH. AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO CROSS INTO THE PROMISE OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR US TO QUIT PLAYING CHURCH. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; And move into our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Well, we don't like that kind of preaching. Well, you got the wrong preacher. I rather preach you a promise &gt;&gt; and preach you into the promised land than keep you from it. &gt;&gt; Cuz church, that's the only thing we got looking for. They came out on the testimony of a vindicated voice &gt;&gt; and we find them in Deuteronomy. They come to Mount Horeb and here God speaks to Moses. And he tells them, "You had dwelt long enough in this mountain." They just went around the mountain, stayed there for a year, year and a half, camped down, got their feelings hurt in church. Oh my. Ain't nobody ever had that happen. Got the feelings hurt. We just going to stay right here. I ain't going back. What did he tell him? You have dwelt here long enough. This is not I'm going to bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to bless you around the mountains. I'm not going to bless you in the wilderness. I'm going to bless you in Canaan. &gt;&gt; Church, put your eyes on Canaan. And don't stop short. I don't care what you go through in this life. I don't care what kind of hardships you face. You put your focus on Canaan land. You put your focus on a rapture. You put your focus on the new birth. You put your focus on that life. Young person, you go to camp. Hey, I hope you jump. I HOPE YOU SHOUT, BUT YOU DON'T JUMP AND SHOUT TO GET IT. BUT AFTER YOU get it, you probably jump and shout. &gt;&gt; But do me a FAVOR AND DO THIS ONE THING. ONE thing have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I will abide in the hiding place of the most high, and he shall hide me. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 2 and verse one. THEN WE TURNED AND WE TOOK OUR JOURNEY. NOTICE NOW HERE THEY'RE leaving Horeb. WE TOOK OUR JOURNEY INTO THE WILDERNESS by the way of the Red Sea. AND THE LORD SPAKE UNTO ME, AND WE COMPASSED MOUNT Zir many days. And the Lord spake unto me, saying, You have compass this mountain long enough. Turn ye northward. So they left Mount Si and they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years. My my my. How long have we been wandering? 60 plus years wondering, still preaching, still preaching the same message. God sent a prophet. Push, play, and obey. Oh, I'm sorry I said that. See, we make it about a man. Push, play, and obey. It's about go get a bribe. &gt;&gt; And we just Oh, just Hey, believe God sent a prophet and you'll be upright. Believe the message. And that's all we've made this message about. &gt;&gt; While the entire message is about you. &gt;&gt; The entire message. If you want to bring it all down in just one little phrase, the message is about a bride. &gt;&gt; What good would it be for him to come for just one man? &gt;&gt; Why did he even send Christ? just to prove that he can be the lamb of God. He sent him for one purpose &gt;&gt; and it's to pay a debt that you and I couldn't pay. &gt;&gt; It was to get himself a bride. &gt;&gt; Because see, a part of his plan was redemption. &gt;&gt; And in part to fulfill the kinsman and redeemer, there had to be a man. There had to be one like us that could that can be a kinsman to us. that therefore that the sins of man will be rolled off of us and THE REPROACH BE ROLLED OFF OF US. So he had to BECOME A MAN IN ORDER TO TAKE SINS OFF OF US SO THAT WE CAN BE PLACED BACK IN THE VERY THOUGHTS OF GOD AGAIN. SO EVEN GOD COMING DOWN LEAVING ALL OF GLORY TAKEN ON THE FORM OF SINFUL MAN IN THE FORM OF HIS SON JESUS CHRIST WAS ALL FOR THE PURPOSE AND THE POINT OF TAKING himself a bride. And if he sent Christ for that, what about a prophet? &gt;&gt; What's the need of a prophet? The very same thing. BUT WE FIND THEM. THEY'VE COME OUT TWOTHIRDS OF THE journey on the testimony of a prophet. Just a wonder. Well, we God don't do those things anymore. God doesn't he doesn't do the supernatural signs and wonders of that was back in the 40s and 50s and 60s. God doesn't do that anymore. He doesn't open up blind eyes. Tell Gab's wife that he doesn't heal from rheumato arthritis. Tell sister Lana bus back home that God doesn't heal stage four lymphoma cancer. &gt;&gt; Tell these PEOPLE THESE THINGS THAT GOD DOESN'T DO THAT YOU'RE TOO LATE. &gt;&gt; WELL, WHY? BECAUSE HE IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, [cheering] [applause] TODAY, AND FOREVER. LOOK, LET THAT BE MORE THAN JUST A CLICHE. [cheering] LET [applause] THAT BE THE ABSOLUTE. GOD IS THE SAME. AND IF HE'S SAME GOD TODAY AND HE TOOK THEM OUT OF EGYPT AND PLACED THEM INTO THEIR LAND OF PROMISE, INTO THEIR HIDING PLACE, THEN THAT SAME GOD WITH THE SAME ANOINTING UNDER [screaming] THE SAME MINISTRY OF THE SAME WORD WILL TAKE A BRIDE OUT OF THEIR EGYPT AND PLACE HIM INTO THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HE WILL DO IT. HE HAS TO DO IT IN ORDER TO BE GOD. DEUTERONOMY 2:13 SAYS, "NOW RISE UP, SAID I, AND GET YOU OVER THE BROOK OF ZARED, AND WE WENT OVER TO THE BROOK ZARED, AND THE SPACE IN WHICH WE CAME FROM KADESH BARNEA until we come over the brook there was 38 years." So 38 years. I'm 50. Don't look at me like that, David. I'm getting old. I can't even see it. But 38 years they wandered &gt;&gt; and complained &gt;&gt; and wondered and complained. Well, it's too cold. It's too hot. It's too this. It's too that. And they wondered. Did you see so and so? They wasn't here. Did you see their kids little snotty nose things? That's how we act sometimes. &gt;&gt; If that was my AND I'D HAVE SNATCHED HIM UP. THANK GOD IT ain't your kid. You can just sit there and run a mouth with it. BUT WE FIND THEY COME TO KADESH BARNEA 38 years on the testimony of a prophet. &gt;&gt; I want you to get this. This is how important it is for the new birth. &gt;&gt; Three days journey from the promised land. &gt;&gt; Just how close are we? THREE DAYS JOURNEY, THE BELIEVER CAN LOOK OVER into the land, but they couldn't enjoy it. Brother Stewart, they've heard the testimonies of how it took two men to carry back those grapes. They heard the testimonies, oh, how it was a wonderful land. It flowed with milk and honey, but they could they couldn't set down any claims because they failed to enter into the land. 38 years they sat on the outskirts of the promised land, their place of safety, and they wandered in the wilderness. 38 years. Moses covered 38 years of Israel's wandering in the wilderness. And this what did it do? Took up time waiting on a generation of unbelief to die out so a generation of faith can enter into the promised land. They kept preaching the same doctrines of repentance. God sent a prophet. All you got to do is believe the message. But they never dug into Moses's message. &gt;&gt; If they would have dug into Moses's message, they would have known that God had a purpose to take them to a certain place &gt;&gt; and they stopped short. &gt;&gt; What am I telling you, church? Don't stop short. &gt;&gt; I know this life can be unbearable. I know it can be difficult, but don't short in the journey &gt;&gt; and it is a journey &gt;&gt; and it can be intense at times but he's leading us to the promised land. 38 years they lacked the desire to possess what God had given him because the old fighters said God don't do that no more. We had the reveal word today. We don't need the signs and the wonders. We don't need to speaking in tongues. We don't need to shout. We don't need to shout the king in the camp. That was something of yesterday. Why? But these old generation of fighters had to die off. Can I tell you the promise still remained? &gt;&gt; The promise still remains. &gt;&gt; He gave them a promised land. They can look sister James and see it. No doubt Caleb every morning got up. There's a mountain over there. It's got my name on it. There's a mountain over there. I've already been there. I know exactly where I'm going to build my house. There's giants on that mountain. Caleb didn't care about what was on the mountain. He just knew God gave him the promise. &gt;&gt; And that promise wasn't in the wilderness. That promise was in the promised land of the word. &gt;&gt; And God has given you each and everyone precious promises. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, he has given you your children that they and their offspring shall be there WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU THE PRECIOUS promise of the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It may be a giant on your mountain, but your mountain needs to hear your voice. &gt;&gt; See, the promised land is just as in sight today as it was then. See, God called them out of Egypt and God has called us out of Egypt and he sent us a prophet. And when brother Brandham was here, I believe today that the same promise that he preached that that same promise still is still in effect today because we've not changed bodies. &gt;&gt; We've not changed unless you're changed. If this is the millennium, I'm sorely disappointed. SEE, THERE'S A PROMISE OF THE HOLY GHOST TODAY for every believer who will complete all three stages of the journey. You hear me, young person? So, what am I telling you? Don't be content with just a justified life. Don't remain satisfied with crossing your red seas and bitter waters to live a sanctified life and just wander around thinking, "Well, I'm moral. I got long hair and I don't wear those kind of clothes. But yet in your heart, you know, you've not completed the journey. &gt;&gt; And that doesn't only go for the young person. It go for us as old people as well. Make sure that you complete THE JOURNEY BECAUSE ALL the promises of God lay in that third pool. &gt;&gt; They lay in the promised land, the third stage of the journey. May we not make church the same fatal error that they &gt;&gt; come out under the testimony because only a handful of you maybe a handful ever seen the prophet. How many of you seen the prophet? Come on raise your hand high. Some two or three out of 50 60 we got here. So the rest of us have come out under the testimony &gt;&gt; and what we heard on tape. &gt;&gt; Oh, we heard this one saying that one saying how he revealed this to me and he did this to me and he did this and he spoke this. &gt;&gt; See, we've come out on that same testimony. &gt;&gt; But we're not going to be of the type that only stay twothirds of the way. &gt;&gt; No, WE WE'VE COME AND BROTHER SAID EVERY CHURCH SERVICE IS A CADISH BARIA. YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. ARE WE GOING TO STAY HERE AND WONDER AND WONDER AND WONDER AND LET THIS OLD LIES AND GOD DOESN'T DO THIS ANYMORE? WE DON'T NEED A SUPERNATURAL ANYMORE. KEEP US FROM OUR LAND OF PROMISE. NO. BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION. I'M LEAVING HERE. I'M LEAVING HERE IN THIS SERVICE. I'M LEAVING HERE IN THIS DAY. I'M NOT GOING TO GO AROUND THE MOUNTAIN OF UNBELIEF ANYMORE. I'M NOT GOING TO WANDER AROUND THE WILDERNESS OF WONDER AND WORRY AND GR REGRET AND DIFFICULTY AND MALICE AND STRIFE. I'M GOING INTO [screaming] THE PROMISED LAND OF THE HOLY GHOST OF MY H MY HIDDEN LIFE IN CHRIST. I'M GOING TO MY HIDING PLACE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE GOD HAS INTENDED TO TAKE A PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; NOT TO SOME DENOMINATION. NOT TO THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS CHURCH. NOT TO JUST SAY, "I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER." IT'S MORE THAN [screaming] JUST BELIEVING THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; He's trying to take you somewhere &gt;&gt; to a hiding place. And when they got to Canaan, oh, brother Brown would tell us, you know, there were still battles in Canaan, but that's where all the promises lie. &gt;&gt; Oh, I just love this word. So, we got to make sure that we enter into that land, enter into the Holy Ghost. And he said, God's promised the Holy Ghost to every believer, and he wants to give it to you more than you want to receive it. Not just a baptism on your flesh &gt;&gt; where you get a goosebump or you shout &gt;&gt; or maybe during your special meetings and you [snorts] get all caught up in the forio of of the service and maybe you you begin to run under the excitement. It's more than just the emotional aspect of it. &gt;&gt; I'm all about emotion, but we don't get worked up and EMOTIONAL TO GET THE HOLY GHOST. WE GET THE HOLY GHOST FIRST AND THEN IT WORKS US UP UNTO EMOTION. &gt;&gt; SEE, NOT JUST IT ON YOUR FLESH, BUT WE WANT the literal life of Christ, &gt;&gt; the token life on display. See, that's the rest. That's the place of safety. &gt;&gt; That's our hiding place. &gt;&gt; Kadis Barne, we told it means make a decision. You got to make a decision. And I and you may tell me today, "Well, Brother Joe, I believe God sent a prophet." I say, "Great, Brother Joe, I've been a believer of this message for 50 years." Great. We'll give you a plaque when the service is over, Brother Joe. I live a clean and moral life. I'm happy. But do you have the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Do you have the token life? Because that's where it meets the rubber meets the road. Not how much you know or how much you confess you know, how much you say that you know. Do you know him? And more importantly, does him know you? See, have you received the life or we just circling? Circling. I see the land, all the blessings in the land. Oh my, I heard about the miracles in the land. I don't want to be an observer of the land. God didn't call us to be observers just to sit back from three days journey and look what's going on at so and so church. Wish we could have that here. Oh, I looked over, man. Wish we could have that type of service here. Wow, they got that brother. I wish we could get that brother here. No, we're not observers. &gt;&gt; The promised land belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to go alone. Well, you better be dead set on going at it alone. Sometimes &gt;&gt; this Christian journey ain't about you and your buddy, &gt;&gt; Brother Danny. It's not about us and our wives. It's about us and our relationship with God. And if you don't go, but you're not going to hinder me. &gt;&gt; My wife decides she's had enough of it. Praise God. I don't believe that's going to happen. But I'm going on anyway &gt;&gt; because it's about me and God. &gt;&gt; Sister Danny, you've been at it a long time by yourself. Brother passed over many years ago, but you're still faithful. If it was about you and him, you'd have stopped a long time ago. It was about you and him. So we find today the land still belongs to us. What needs to happen is we need to turn northward. It's time some of you make a decision. I'm not just going to come to Word of Life tabernacle just to come to Word of Life Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; I'm not just going to fulfill my religious Christian responsibilities and duties, but I'm coming because I want to possess something. We are possessors of the promise. &gt;&gt; Moms and dads, you can pray for your children because you're a possessor of the promise. You can believe when nobody else can believe with you for [clears throat] their salvation and for their Holy Ghost. I look over here and I see brother Joe and sister Joanne praying for one of their children. And now I see the manifestation of a faithful prayer coming to manifestation. Why? because they refuse to let go of a promise. &gt;&gt; And what God's done here, God can do all throughout the churches. &gt;&gt; We have a hiding place, church. &gt;&gt; A place of refuge. And God has called us not just to come out, but to go in and possess the land, possess the new birth, possess the baptism of Holy Ghost, to possess that token LIFE. AND THERE'S HEALING in that land. There's deliverance in that land. There's peace IN THAT LAND. AND THERE'S REVELATION in that land. &gt;&gt; And what did Jesus tell us? He said, "If I go to prepare a place for you, I'm going to come again and I'm going to receive you unto myself that where I am, you may be also." So, he's gone to prepare the place. Church, he's coming back. Are you going to be ready? I like how brother Ram says this in the token message. He says we are not we're not to come and talk about the message. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna let that sink for a minute because we do a good job of talking. &gt;&gt; God's in a prophet. God's in a prophet. God's in a prophet. We can make a song about God's in a prophet. And I'm not making light of that. But he says in THE TOKEN MESSAGE AFTER the revealing of the seals, &gt;&gt; he says, "WE HAVE NOT COME TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT THE MESSAGE. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER to get in the message." &gt;&gt; AND THE MESSAGE IS CHRIST. HE IS THE WORD. WE'RE TO GET INTO IT. GET BENEATH IT. YES, SIR. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. NOWHERE DID HE SAY YOU GOT TO LISTEN TO ME. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE WHAT I'M PREACHING. BUT HE SAYS YOU GOT TO GET INTO CHRIST. YOU GOT TO [screaming] GET INTO THE TOKEN LIFE. YOU GOT TO GET INTO THE MESSAGE. AND CHRIST IS THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; He says we're to get in beneath it. Yes, SIR. HE SAYS ALL HE GOES HE GOES ALL HAD TO TAKE NOT ONLY HIMSELF BUT his whole family, the whole He SAID THEY'RE ONLY SAFE. Now listen, they're only safe when the token was displayed. Now we're talking about a hiding place, a place of refuge, a place of safety. And they were only safe when the token was displayed. Young person, hear this next phrase of this quote. And we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed. &gt;&gt; But I thought you said all we got to do is believe God sent a prophet. I never said that. They made it that, but that's not what I said. See, we cannot feel safe until this token is displayed. That's right. YOU MUST COME UNDER THIS TOKEN, GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT, AND IT displays to you, Jesus Christ, because it comes and lives in you. There's your hiding place. That's what he wanted from the very beginning. All that God was, he emptied himself. He keynoted himself in the Christ. And all that Christ was when you go and you listen to Christ, the mystery of God, all that Christ was, he poured or emptied himself into the body, the bride. So it's always been about you, little bride. But see, we made that the theme or the anthem of the message. We made that and we shipwrecked people because we pointed him to Jeffersonville. We pointed them to a tape player. We pointed them to slanted ideas. We pointed him to false teachings that circulate around a voice. Instead of pointing him &gt;&gt; to Christ, we pointed him. Well, you as long as you believe this, you're secure. As long as you had an eagle belt buckle. I remember that was a thing when I first came to the message. I'm not a cowboy, so I never wore one. Belt buckles. And you got to have the pictures all over your house. My wife don't decorate that way. Hey, if you do, that's great. But we decianize people because we don't have all the messes paraphernalia, all the relics hanging around our who are we here worshiping. &gt;&gt; I want you to understand how I'm presenting this. I'm not presenting this to be disrespectful of our message because I'm not I don't have anything to preach but this. But I want to rightly place it. It's always been about him. &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. The message is not William Brandom. &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. Get in the Christ. Get in the Christ. Get in the Christ. Get in the Christ. What did he say this morning? I'm not him. I'm just his servant. But there'll be a spirit in the land to seduce people to believe and they'll baptize in his name and do all this other stuff in his name. But he says, "Now in the time of trouble, he's going to hide me, shelter me, protect me." Why? because he's going to fill you with the Holy Ghost. And what greater time of trouble are we living in than right now? I personally don't see how we can go much further. &gt;&gt; But he promised he promised. Brother B says he promised to be God in the time of trouble as a present help. He promised to do the things that he seen him through. And he says, "And now he was," he said, "the same spirit of God that led Israel leads the church today, bringing us through as it was the wilderness into the promised land." HE GOES, "WE HAVE WE HAVE A PROMISED LAND. YOU BELIEVE THAT IN MY father's house are many mansions, and I go to prepare a place for you. And I'll come again to receive you unto myself that see where I am, you may be also." He goes, "We're going to a glorious promised land that God has promised us." And what does God want to do? He wants to reveal the word to the people. He wants to reveal himself to the people. And in Isaiah 32, it says, "Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment, and a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place, and the shadows of a great rock in a WEARY LAND." SO ISAIAH HERE IS PROPHESYING OF THE ONCOMING MESSIAH THAT NOT ONLY IS HE GOING TO BE KING, BUT HE'S GOING TO BE JESUS CHRIST MADE MANIFEST AND HE IS GOING TO BE IN THE HIDING PLACE FROM THE WINDS AND A COVERT FROM THE STORMS AND THE TEMPEST OF LIFE. HE IS GOING TO SHELTER YOU AND PROTECT YOU. BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE IT'S MORE THAN JUST AN IDEOLOGY. YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR LIFE IS SO HIDDEN WITH GOD THAT ALL THAT OLD NATURE, THE THINGS THAT YOU USED TO DO AND THE things that YOU USED TO LOVE, YOU DON'T LOVE THEM ANYMORE. NOW YOU LOVE HIM AND HIM ALONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE'S TAKEN ALL THAT OUT, ALL THAT SINFULNESS, ALL THOSE WORLDLY DESIRES, AND HE SHELTERED YOU IN HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; We have a rest when we've been troubled by men. We had peace last night. Many of you, you seen this, the winds blowing last night, man. The winds were whipping. Leaves were just whipping around. &gt;&gt; But you didn't feel none of that because you was inside. &gt;&gt; Oh, you saw the effects. When the storms come in the darkest of nights and the lightning's popping and the thunders are rolling, you don't feel the thunder. Maybe you feel a little bit, you know, a little concussion from it. You see the lightning, but it's all on the outside. You're safe. You have a hiding place, a refuge. And I was thinking this morning when somebody, you know, in the dark, maybe 10 o'clock at night, you're at the house with your people, your family, not your people, and somebody comes knocking on the door, beating on the door. It startles you, right? But guess what? You may be scared for a minute, but they can't come in &gt;&gt; because the door's locked. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm telling you. He's a hiding place. A man shall be a hiding place. So when the enemy and the persecutors and the pursuers come pounding on your door, reminding you of your past, they can't get in &gt;&gt; because we have a hiding place. We're hidden &gt;&gt; in Christ. Let me go on. Brother talks about a bomb shelter. And I'm going to start wrapping this up because I got 13 minutes and 23 seconds. I got to speak fast. I figured y'all would have clapped and said amen on that one. Here we go. But the BIBLE SAYS IN PROVERBS 18:10, THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER THAT THE RIGHTEOUS runest into and are safe. And that word name means reputation, fame and glory. So the name of the Lord, the reputation of the Lord is a strong tower. &gt;&gt; IT'S WITHTOOD A LOT OF ATTACKS. &gt;&gt; IT'S SEEN MEN THROUGH SOME VERY TRYING TIMES. IT BEEN THERE WITH THE HEBREW BOYS. IT'S BEEN THERE WITH DANIEL AND THE LIONS. IT BEEN THERE WITH ABRAHAM ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DESERT. THE NAME OF THE LORD, &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU, THE NAME OF THE LORD'S MADE IT THROUGH SIX CHURCH AGES. IN THE NAME OF THE LORD IS GOING TO PERMEATE IN THIS LAST FINAL LEISIAN CHURCH AGE BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO TAKE A PRIDE JUST LIKE HE SAID HE WOULD FROM THE BEGINNING BUT THE NAME OF THE LORD IS A STRONG TOWER LET ME TELL YOU I'M NOT RUNNING TO THE BAPTIST CHURCH I'M NOT RUNNING TO THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH I HAVE RUN [screaming] TO THE HIDING PLACE OF THE ANOINTED WORD OF GOD FOR THIS HOUR AND THAT'S MY SECRET PLACE THAT'S MY PLACE OF PROTECTION [applause] &gt;&gt; SIR &gt;&gt; TO NAME THE REPUTATION OF THE LORD. I'VE SEEN WHAT HE DONE. I'VE SEEN CANCER DELIVERED. &gt;&gt; I see couples that couldn't get pregnant, barren, prayed for them, and God give them a child. &gt;&gt; Had a couple there in Kentucky last year came up for prayer. I told the the wife, I said, "Give him a name. Speak a name over him right now." just got a testimony the other day. They're pregnant with their first child. CAN I TELL YOU, HE'S STILL GOD TODAY? &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU ARE, WHEREVER YOU FIND YOURSELF, HE'S STILL AS MUCH GOD TODAY IN LEIA, IN HARDY, ARKANSAS, OR WHEREVER YOU FIND YOUR PLACE, HE'S NOT DEPLETED OF [screaming] ONE OUNCE OF POWER. &gt;&gt; HE IS STILL GOD AND HE'S STILL SUFFICIENT FOR YOU IN YOUR NEEDS TODAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. Righteous run to and safe. SO NO MATTER HOW MANY bombs or how many anything, we're safe there. And you got people today, you know, we got these preppers, man. They got food stored up to last a thousand years. Good Lord, I don't want to taste that food in a thousand years. Hey, it may be canned perfect, but it ain't going to last that long. BUT THEY DONE DUG THEM A CELLAR. They done got it so many feet deep. I don't know who did the test to see if it's going to withstand a nuclear explosion. Somehow they got it all figured out. They building bomb shelters. They're preparing to stay. I don't want to stay. &gt;&gt; Look, look around. I &gt;&gt; mean, hardy ain't that bad. But look around. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE. OUR POLITICAL SYSTEMS ARE FALLING APART. &gt;&gt; MEN AND WOMEN DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE A MAN OR A WOMAN, CAT OR A DOG. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, YOU GOT KIDS IN SCHOOL PEEING IN A LITTER BOX, &gt;&gt; because they're taking on the NAME OF A CAT or the identity. Well, meow me crazy, BUT I'M NOT GOING DOWN THAT ROAD. Come on. &gt;&gt; AND WE WANT TO STAY HERE. &gt;&gt; NO, I want to leave. &gt;&gt; And brother B talked about this bomb shelter. He says, "No, if I had a bomb shelter under all the places and everything, we're still not secure. THE ONLY ONE SAFE PLACE that's in Christ, the son of THE LIVING GOD. HE IS THE BOMB SHELTER. Under his wings, &gt;&gt; we will abide." &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "THE REAL BOMB SHELTER." NOW FLEE TONIGHT FROM THE THE WRATH THAT IS TO COME. HE SAYS, "BUT NOTICE THERE IS A SAFE PLACE THAT'S IN JESUS CHRIST. UPON THIS ROCK I'LL BUILD MY CHURCH AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT." THAT'S THE BELIEVER'S PROTECTION JUST UNDER the wings safely abide. A hiding place. Ah, it doesn't look safe. Wings, feathers safe. Try it one time. Try it one time. I've seen God move, church, time and time and time and time and time and time again. Not with steel, not with ammunition, not with political powers, not with great powers. Because he said, "Not by might, not by strength, but by my power." It's all about God. God moves how he desires to move. Amen. &gt;&gt; Seen God heal, seeing God deliver, seeing God set free, seeing God filled with the Holy Ghost. Seeing God move in situations, but I never figured out how he was going to move through it. Four or five years ago, I took a leap of faith and left a great job. I thought it was great. Took a leap of faith to go full-time into the ministry. My kids, all with the exception of Caroline, Rebecca Manley, she thought we was going to go poor as church Bryce. Ain't no way we're going to make it. Ain't no way we're going to make it. She was scared to death. We're going to be poppers. We're going to be P. We ain't going to have nothing. Cara, I mean, she's like, LAUREN HAD THE BEST LIFE. SHE GOT TO GET ALL THIS STUFF. I'M NEVER GOING TO GET A CAR. I'M NEVER GOING TO GET THIS. I'M NEVER GOING TO GET THAT. I'M LIKE, GIRL, you underestimate God. You underestimate God. We took a leap of faith. And I could go on and on and on. Just a couple years ago, God blessed me with that black truck out there. Somebody bought it for me. Yeah, you heard me right. Did y'all look at it? It's a platinum. Yeah. Nice red seats. Fine truck, man. Oh, poor preacher. It ain't a poor preacher. It's a big God. &gt;&gt; WHAT AM I TELLING YOU? DON'T SHORT CHANGE GOD JUST FROM WHAT YOU SEE. &gt;&gt; God can do what he chooses, HOW HE WISHES TO. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT BUILDING BOMB SHELTERS, but we're under a shelter of his wings, of his protection. &gt;&gt; And brother Andrew Spencer at a youth camp many years ago, he spoke a word. And I, you know, and it it's not just in the aspect of this word being just for me and I make him anything special, but I believe God uses gifts and uses men. But at the end of a youth service, he looked at the back and he said, "Brother Joe," he says, "Satan [snorts] can't stop you." He goes, "Don't worry about your future. Your future is clear." What he didn't know was Monday morning. And I was going in with a resignation letter. &gt;&gt; So God was telling me, "Don't worry about your future. &gt;&gt; I got you." &gt;&gt; And can I tell you, Word of Life tabernacle, don't you worry about your future. &gt;&gt; He's got you. &gt;&gt; He's got your children. He's got your families. He's got your husbands, your wife, your jobs, your careers, your grandchildren. He's got you. &gt;&gt; Sister Carla, he's got you. He's got your children. Don't worry. God's got them. &gt;&gt; We got nothing to worry about. We're safe. &gt;&gt; We're in a safe place. &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God. And they're building bomb shelters. He said you they can build it 150 ft deep, but it'll blow thousands of miles wide. He said you can get it all the way to the lava. It'll crush every bone in your body. I'm not preparing to stay. I'm preparing to leave. &gt;&gt; And so what do we got to do, brother Stewart? We got to get everybody in. Everybody in. &gt;&gt; Get them under the token. &gt;&gt; Because see, he's not responsible for those that are outside the token. &gt;&gt; Got to get into that city of refuge so the pursuers can't get to him. &gt;&gt; Let me bring this on to a close. Musicians, if you would make your way back, please. the token life, the believer's refuge, the believer's hiding place. Brother taught us that God's mouthpiece is a prophet. He's God's channel. He's God's eye. When we go back and we look here, And Psalms 32 and verse 7, thou art my hiding place. Thou shalt preserve me from trouble. Thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. But in verse 38, he says, I will instruct thee and teach thee in thy way, and thou are in the way that thou shalt go, and I will guide thee with my eye. And your prophet taught us that a seer, a prophet, is God's eye. And God has been leading us with his eye. Some of you, he's led from other lands. You drive two, three hours maybe to be here. God's leading. God's guiding. God's put you together. God's placed you here. It's God. It's been God the whole time. But his eyes been watching over his elect. He put this one with that one because he saw a seed 100 years later that's going to come up in this hour. And God's watched it. It's been God's eagle eye the whole time. See, we have a hiding place. If we didn't belong to God, he wouldn't watch over us. But he has a responsibility. He had he's obligated to his word. And I'm his word. Brother Brandham expressed that a prophet functions as God's eye on earth to reveal his will and to guide his people. We go on just a little bit further. And he would tell us that Christ, the word is our refuge. It's our only safe place for the believer in the last days is to be in Christ. Which the revealed word for this hour is Christ. And he would tell us that the token is our protection. It's it connected, brother B would connect the hiding place with the token, the Holy Spirit. And just as Israel had the blood on the DOORSTEPS OF EGYPT, BELIEVERS TODAY must have the same spirit applied to their lives. That's the protection against judgment. Then it would tell us that the name of the Lord, notice, is a strong tower. And brother taught that Christ's name understood spiritually through REVELATION WAS A STRONG TOWER WHERE THE BRIDE HIDES. She's not hidden in the denominational name, but she's hidden in his name. And he warned us in the chaos of denominations and politics and end time judgments, only those that take refuge in the revealed word, the message have a true hiding place. Aren't you thankful today, church, that we have a refuge? And I'm going to say something here, and please understand it in the way that I mean to say it, but the message movement is not our hiding place. The message movement is not our hiding place. The name William Brandom has never saved one person. The name William Brandom is not our hiding place. But the message and the message is Christ and he is the word and he is our hiding place. &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet God sent a prophet. God's eye leading you, guiding you, speaking expressly to you and to your needs. God's eagle eye. And we're in a time of trouble. The death angel is going through the land and he's looking. Well, B tells the story about that little Hebrew boy. Dad, are we going to be okay? ARE YOU SURE WE'RE OKAY? HE SAYS, "YES, SON. We're okay. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I NEED THE ASSURANCE." He said, "Come here, son." He said, "Come here." He said, "You see this?" Moses the prophet told us to apply the blood. Told us not just come and talk about it, but get in it. And we applied this token to the door. And when the death angel comes, he's going to pass over. Why? How can that happen? Because he sees the sacrifice. He sees that blood was applied. And in this hour, in the time of trouble, that that angel is going to pass over. If the token has been applied, if the life has been applied, if you're truly in your hiding place, God bless you. Let's just stand and worship the Lord. You are my refuge. &gt;&gt; When I feel afraid, you're my hiding place. You are my refuge. And when the storm is raging underneath his waves, I will rejoice and sing. You are singing it to him again. Now be thankful for that refuge tonight. You are my refuge. You are my sanctuary. When I feel afraid, you're my hiding place. You're my refuge. And when the storm is raging underneath your wings, I rejoice and sing. Sing it to him again now. Oh, you are my refuge.
