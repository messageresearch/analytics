[54:35] chapter 1 and verse
[54:37] one God who at sunry times and in
[54:40] diverse manners spake in time pasted
[54:44] unto the fathers by the prophets hath in
[54:47] these last days spoken unto us by his
[54:50] son whom he hath appointed heir of All
[54:54] Things by whom also
[54:57] he made the worlds and then I want to go
[55:00] to 2 Peter chap 1 and verse
[55:06] 16 it says for we have not followed
[55:09] cunningly devised fables when we made
[55:12] known unto you the power and coming of
[55:15] our Lord Jesus Christ but were
[55:18] eyewitnesses of his
[55:20] majesty for he received from God the
[55:23] Father honor and Glory when there came
[55:25] such a voice to him from the excellent
[55:28] Glory this is my beloved Son in whom I
[55:33] am well pleased and this voice which
[55:36] came from heaven we heard I just love
[55:39] Peter's testimony he said I was there on
[55:41] the mountain and I heard the voice that
[55:45] spoke when we were with him in the Holy
[55:47] Mountain we have also a more sure word
[55:52] of Prophecy where unto you do well that
[55:55] you take heed
[55:57] is unto a light that shineth in a dark
[55:59] place until the day Dawn and the day
[56:02] star arise in your hearts knowing this
[56:05] first that no Prophecy of the scriptures
[56:07] of any private interpretation for the
[56:10] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[56:12] will of man but holy men of God spake as
[56:16] they were moved by the Holy Ghost I pray
[56:18] the Lord would add his Blessing to the
[56:20] word and you may be
[56:22] seated Peter is speaking here of when
[56:25] Jesus Took James and John to the
[56:27] mountain and he sees Moses and Elijah
[56:30] with Jesus and he says let's build three
[56:33] Tabernacles one to each of them and the
[56:37] Bible says while he yet spake Behold a
[56:40] bright Cloud overshadowed them and
[56:42] behold a voice out of the cloud which
[56:44] said this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[56:51] hear ye him and brother Brenham says
[56:54] about that he talks about how that Moses
[56:56] and Elijah represented the law and he
[56:59] said I don't want his law it puts me in
[57:02] jail I don't want his Justice it
[57:04] condemns me I want Mercy we all want
[57:06] Mercy don't we he said God knows we all
[57:09] need Mercy I want his Mercy he said what
[57:12] did Jesus represent his Mercy his his
[57:15] love he said if you're without love hear
[57:18] ye him if the barrels empty at home hear
[57:22] ye him if the cruise has run dry hear ye
[57:26] him if you've got a broken heart hear ye
[57:29] him if you need joy in your soul how
[57:32] many can use more joy in your soul hear
[57:34] ye him who is he he is the word so if
[57:39] you need these things if you've got a
[57:40] need for Joy if you got a broken heart
[57:42] he said hear him if you need forgiveness
[57:45] of your sins hear ye him if you need
[57:47] healing for your body how many needs
[57:49] healing today hear ye him hear the word
[57:54] so it came from a part meral fulfillment
[57:57] to a a fullness God manifested In the
[58:00] Flesh and he said now I want you to hear
[58:02] him you've heard the law and the
[58:03] prophets you've heard Moses you've heard
[58:05] Elijah now hear him yes all right right
[58:09] now watch he said he represents all that
[58:12] God was the fullness of the God had
[58:14] bodily dwell in him hear ye him Justice
[58:18] Mercy met and paid the debt and God said
[58:20] this is my beloved Son hear ye him he
[58:23] said Methodist your church is all right
[58:25] but hear him
[58:27] Pentecost your church is all right hear
[58:29] ye him you're shouting wonderful but
[58:32] hear ye him they're speaking in tongues
[58:36] wonderful right but hear ye him your
[58:39] denomination wonderful but hear you him
[58:43] you can have all those things and still
[58:47] turn a deaf
[58:48] ear to him that's now just to kind of
[58:52] establish that as a background to what
[58:53] we want to say today now what I want to
[58:56] speak to you on is how do we know that
[58:59] it's God that's
[59:01] speaking how do we know that God is
[59:06] speaking and that the voice that we're
[59:09] hearing is God and if someone came to
[59:13] you today or someone does in the future
[59:16] and said God told me to tell you to do
[59:22] this right how do you know that what
[59:26] they're telling you is the
[59:28] truth how would you know that it was God
[59:33] speaking I want you young people to
[59:35] listen even your children to listen this
[59:37] morning as Elders I think and not just
[59:40] because it's me that's speaking but I
[59:43] come up a certain way and I've been
[59:45] through some things and I'm not old but
[59:47] I've I've got an old spirit and uh I
[59:50] I've seen some things and and I've been
[59:53] around and some of you all that have
[59:55] been around you you you'll understand
[59:57] and you'll be able to fellowship with me
[59:59] on this thought that we grew up I grew
[1:00:02] up under
[1:00:03] uncertainty and the kind of uncertainty
[1:00:06] that I grew up under was a man standing
[1:00:09] in the Pulpit that thought he had the
[1:00:10] ability to tell me whether I was saved
[1:00:14] or not whether I was going to heaven or
[1:00:16] not even if I was predestined or not
[1:00:18] based on gifts and based on signs and I
[1:00:23] and I'll never forget an instance in my
[1:00:25] life when I was 12 years old just about
[1:00:27] the age of these young men sitting here
[1:00:29] some of these girls and I was 12 years
[1:00:31] old and and a man my my pastor who was
[1:00:34] also my father spoke to me and and asked
[1:00:37] me if I'd seen a certain sign that he
[1:00:39] said it happened and I told him I didn't
[1:00:41] see it and he said well you must not be
[1:00:45] predestined and so I grew up under that
[1:00:47] uncertainty of whether or not I was
[1:00:49] predestined whether or not I was the
[1:00:51] elect based on whether or not I had seen
[1:00:53] a
[1:00:54] sign yeah
[1:00:56] huh some of you don't know what I'm
[1:00:58] talking
[1:00:59] about and so it creates it breathes
[1:01:02] uncertainty because it it it ties what
[1:01:06] we are and who we are and our election
[1:01:08] to what a man has to say about us but I
[1:01:11] want you to understand this morning your
[1:01:13] election has nothing to do with signs
[1:01:16] your predestination has nothing to do
[1:01:20] with what some man says about you I may
[1:01:22] not be able to see it but God can see it
[1:01:25] and and that's why we don't get too
[1:01:27] offended you know we may disagree with
[1:01:28] somebody somebody might somebody might
[1:01:30] come and say well uh you know uh you
[1:01:33] don't belong here or something and and
[1:01:35] you're not a Christian or whatever but
[1:01:36] that don't bother us too much because we
[1:01:38] have to make our calling and our
[1:01:40] election sure between us and God and if
[1:01:43] nobody else serve God I'm going to serve
[1:01:45] him anyway and if nobody else thinks I'm
[1:01:48] serving God I'm going to serve him
[1:01:51] anyway so I grew up under that kind of
[1:01:53] uncertainty of and I know I know some of
[1:01:56] y'all stories I know you've experienced
[1:01:58] some of the same
[1:01:59] things that some man could tell you
[1:02:02] whether or not you were saved that
[1:02:05] week right and you're not saved because
[1:02:08] the pastor thinks you're
[1:02:11] saved right because every time you miss
[1:02:14] church I doubt it you know I just like
[1:02:17] no I'm just
[1:02:18] kidding huh right CU I I might look at
[1:02:21] that and say my goodness what's that
[1:02:22] person doing wonder if they even have
[1:02:24] the Holy Ghost but you have the Holy
[1:02:26] Ghost because you come God's provided
[1:02:28] way you repented and were baptized and
[1:02:30] filled with the Holy Ghost not cuz I say
[1:02:33] you have it are you with me now not
[1:02:36] because somebody else says there some
[1:02:38] some gift spoke to you and we're getting
[1:02:41] to a point now where it seems like some
[1:02:42] gift has to speak to tell somebody if
[1:02:44] they've got the holy ghost or not you
[1:02:46] got the Holy Ghost because you come
[1:02:47] according to the
[1:02:51] word so I grew up under uncertainty my
[1:02:54] wife grew up under the same thing thing
[1:02:56] in a different Church different place in
[1:03:00] fact our parents almost met my dad
[1:03:02] talked to her pastor which was her uncle
[1:03:05] on the phone and they were going to meet
[1:03:07] and they never did and I ended up
[1:03:09] meeting her because I went to here by
[1:03:11] the Daryl Ward
[1:03:13] preach at her church and I'm thankful he
[1:03:15] went I'm thankful he did that that's the
[1:03:18] reason I have my wife today so if you're
[1:03:20] looking for a wife or looking for a
[1:03:21] husband go to
[1:03:23] church it's a good play you know that
[1:03:26] trat don't
[1:03:27] you so it was a good place to go and and
[1:03:30] so we went to church and and I went to
[1:03:32] her church and she come to find out she
[1:03:34] grew up under the same thing and my
[1:03:37] dad's passed away and to his reward and
[1:03:40] and her pastor her uncle had passed away
[1:03:43] to his reward as well but at you know he
[1:03:47] he would tell them something to do and
[1:03:50] he told a certain sister she had a dark
[1:03:51] cloud over her life and she still lives
[1:03:53] under that amen
[1:03:57] and and he he told a he he told a
[1:03:59] certain uh he told and I'm just being
[1:04:02] honest with you told her mother that she
[1:04:03] was all right to leave her husband and
[1:04:05] marry somebody else and later on says
[1:04:08] oops I was wrong I'm being very open
[1:04:11] with you today because I want you to
[1:04:12] understand where I'm coming from we
[1:04:15] don't go by that you go by the word
[1:04:18] right what does the word have to say
[1:04:20] about it cuz I could be wrong but the
[1:04:22] word will never be wrong heavens and
[1:04:25] earth will pass away but my word will
[1:04:27] never pass away yes sir so I guess maybe
[1:04:31] Britney and I are are uniquely tuned to
[1:04:34] that because we grew up under that and
[1:04:37] she's got many stories of that and I do
[1:04:39] as well but I won't bore you with that
[1:04:40] this morning but you see when when you
[1:04:44] have that it breeds uncertainty in your
[1:04:46] life it's an uncertain
[1:04:49] sound you're just not sure what's being
[1:04:51] said if you're saved or not if you're
[1:04:53] able to make it or not it breeds un
[1:04:55] certainty and uncertainty breeds in
[1:04:59] action right because you're not sure if
[1:05:02] you're saved you're not sure what you
[1:05:04] should be preparing for you're not sure
[1:05:06] whether or not you're going in a Rapture
[1:05:08] you're not sure whether or not you can
[1:05:10] be healed so you're waiting on something
[1:05:12] and so it it causes you actually to be
[1:05:15] in a state of inaction look at 1
[1:05:17] Corinthians 14 and8 where Paul is
[1:05:19] dealing with the gifts and he says this
[1:05:21] for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:05:23] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[1:05:27] battle because the same trumpet that
[1:05:29] sounds charge also sounds
[1:05:33] Retreat right and if you're not sure
[1:05:35] what the trumpeter is blowing if you're
[1:05:37] not sure of the tune if you've not been
[1:05:39] trained to hear the sound how are you
[1:05:41] ever going to come out see so if you
[1:05:43] just have people blowing horns all over
[1:05:45] the place and all kinds of stuff going
[1:05:47] on do you realize what it does it's just
[1:05:49] confusion we're living in a time of
[1:05:51] confusion we're living in a time when on
[1:05:53] every hand there's somebody who's going
[1:05:55] to tell you the Lord said this or the
[1:05:57] Lord said that and I say the Lord has
[1:06:01] spoken he has spoken and we ought to
[1:06:04] believe
[1:06:07] it I was so
[1:06:09] thankful when I left home and I was got
[1:06:13] out and I know my mother and sitting
[1:06:15] here my brother different ones we were
[1:06:17] so thankful to come around people that
[1:06:20] that their their standard was the
[1:06:23] word and some of the men I've been able
[1:06:25] to priv to fellowship with some of the
[1:06:26] churches I've been privileged to preach
[1:06:27] in and things all over the world and I
[1:06:29] found men that that believed the word
[1:06:32] and stood by it and and they didn't go
[1:06:34] by what how they felt and didn't go by
[1:06:37] uh some some little feeling or some
[1:06:38] emotion or some gift although those
[1:06:40] things are wonderful but that's not what
[1:06:42] we go by we go by the word and so I was
[1:06:45] so thankful to find people that would do
[1:06:47] that and yet I see that uncertainty
[1:06:49] coming back in the hearts and the minds
[1:06:51] of people and I want you young people to
[1:06:54] understand that you're not you don't get
[1:06:56] unsaved because somebody tells you you
[1:06:58] got some kind of a spirit on you or
[1:06:59] something like that you check that out
[1:07:01] with the word don't just take what that
[1:07:03] man says about it find out what God
[1:07:06] said you don't have to believe that the
[1:07:08] Bible says beloved believe not every
[1:07:11] Spirit but try the spirits and see if
[1:07:13] they're of
[1:07:15] God right are you with me
[1:07:18] now brother brand said there never was a
[1:07:20] time that things was so uncertain as
[1:07:23] today and anything that's un un certain
[1:07:26] cannot be trusted right just remember
[1:07:29] that anything that's uncertain cannot be
[1:07:31] trusted if it ministers questions to you
[1:07:35] it cannot be
[1:07:37] trusted church if all it does is
[1:07:39] Minister questions then what good did it
[1:07:41] do you I've heard preachers preach
[1:07:43] sermons and all it did was create
[1:07:44] mystery I'm not here to create mystery
[1:07:47] I'm here to dispel and tell you the
[1:07:49] books been open and the mystery's been
[1:07:51] revealed
[1:07:55] if there's a question brother brand said
[1:07:57] anything that's uncertain cannot be
[1:07:58] trusted if there's a question don't do
[1:08:01] it at
[1:08:02] all right don't do anything that's
[1:08:04] uncertain I've said that before when
[1:08:06] covid come around people wonder should I
[1:08:08] take a vaccine should I not and now
[1:08:09] everybody's looking hindsights you know
[1:08:11] we can see that a little bit better what
[1:08:13] all happen but but at the time I told
[1:08:15] people I said if you can't do it in
[1:08:16] faith don't do
[1:08:18] it right because it's uncertain to you
[1:08:22] you don't do anything uncertainly
[1:08:26] so brother Randon when he preaches this
[1:08:27] the sign of the end sir I hope you'll
[1:08:30] you'll just allow me a little bit of
[1:08:31] time this morning to go through this and
[1:08:33] then but Joel can come preach us all
[1:08:34] happy
[1:08:36] tonight but brother BR said now I do not
[1:08:38] believe that there's anything that he
[1:08:39] has spoken this a remarkable statement
[1:08:43] he said I do not believe there's
[1:08:44] anything that he has spoken all these
[1:08:46] years of my life that I have spoke to
[1:08:48] the people but what come to
[1:08:51] pass he said and many people's come with
[1:08:53] dreams that he's L Me by his grace and
[1:08:55] interpret for the people now he's about
[1:08:56] to uh interpret these dreams that have
[1:08:59] come and he's about to give them to the
[1:09:01] people and tell them about them and say
[1:09:02] what they meant but he said there's many
[1:09:04] people come with dreams he said that
[1:09:06] he's let me interpret and many has come
[1:09:09] with dreams and with problems I was
[1:09:12] unable to
[1:09:14] interpret he said but I haven't tried to
[1:09:16] introduce to you people a gimmick that
[1:09:20] has all the
[1:09:21] answers I wish I could church I I really
[1:09:24] do there are times as a pastor I wish I
[1:09:26] could just sit here and say you know God
[1:09:28] showed me you should do such such and
[1:09:30] such and and I know there's a there's a
[1:09:32] certain element in the church that you
[1:09:34] would because you trust me and you love
[1:09:35] me you you'd want to do that brother Ben
[1:09:38] if God showed you I want to do that and
[1:09:40] it'd be easy to slip into that and start
[1:09:42] to say well God showed me that you
[1:09:45] should do that but you know you that
[1:09:47] have counseled with me and been in my
[1:09:48] office and talked to me or or you've
[1:09:50] dealt with me with problems you know
[1:09:51] what I tell you I I don't tell you God
[1:09:54] said I'm we careful with doing that I
[1:09:56] tell you this is what the word says and
[1:09:58] and this is my opinion but you make sure
[1:10:00] that you go back to the
[1:10:03] word because we don't want to introduce
[1:10:05] a gimmick that has all the answers he
[1:10:09] said I've tried to be honest and to tell
[1:10:10] you what was truth and I can only tell
[1:10:12] you as he told me and then as it come to
[1:10:14] me then I could tell you he said I want
[1:10:17] to warn you in this day that we're
[1:10:19] living in there's many not saying
[1:10:21] anything against people but when you see
[1:10:23] a person that's got the answer to
[1:10:24] everything that's contrary to the
[1:10:28] word what' he say he talked about the
[1:10:30] many lepers in the days of uh of uh of
[1:10:33] Jesus many widows in the Days of
[1:10:36] Elijah many lepers in the days of nonon
[1:10:39] he said we find out there's many things
[1:10:41] that God does he doesn't reveal to his
[1:10:43] servants and no servant is greater than
[1:10:46] his Lord and then God will not share his
[1:10:48] glory with nobody he is God and when a
[1:10:51] servant becomes a place that he tries to
[1:10:54] take the place of God then God takes his
[1:10:56] life and moves him away somewhere or
[1:10:58] something he said we must remember that
[1:11:00] he said now in those visions and
[1:11:02] interpretations I cannot tell the
[1:11:03] interpretation of a dream until I see
[1:11:06] exactly by Vision what the dream was and
[1:11:10] he even goes as far as to say he told
[1:11:11] them what they left out of the dream
[1:11:14] when they told him the same as Joseph
[1:11:17] did right when he when he told pharoh's
[1:11:19] dream the same as Daniel did when he
[1:11:21] told Nebuchadnezzar's dream that's the
[1:11:23] pattern of the scripture said but all
[1:11:25] these
[1:11:26] Impressions we mustn't take them you
[1:11:30] don't have to take my word for it let's
[1:11:32] take what a prophet had to say we
[1:11:34] mustn't take them and say thus sayeth
[1:11:38] the Lord we mustn't do that we must have
[1:11:42] a direct voice an answer from God before
[1:11:45] we can say it's
[1:11:46] God not an impression not a sensation no
[1:11:51] matter how much it's pulsating
[1:11:55] I've been stirred to say things before
[1:11:58] that I've checked myself and the Holy
[1:12:00] Spirit has checked me because it wasn't
[1:12:02] with the word just because you're
[1:12:04] stirred to say
[1:12:06] it doesn't make it
[1:12:09] right so he said no matter how much it's
[1:12:11] pulsating you might say I believe it
[1:12:12] could be this way but when you speak
[1:12:14] thus sayith the lord it's not you all
[1:12:16] right right and again we want to get we
[1:12:20] want to get away from that church we
[1:12:21] want to grow up we want to grow up into
[1:12:24] him in All Things where we're not going
[1:12:26] by sensation or feeling we're going by
[1:12:28] what the word that's all we can go by as
[1:12:31] easy as it would be to run the church by
[1:12:33] dreams or by visions or by something
[1:12:35] else it's not how the church was meant
[1:12:37] to be run the church was meant to be run
[1:12:39] by the
[1:12:40] word and and when there was an open
[1:12:42] Vision that was a great thing and when
[1:12:45] the prophet was here on the earth that
[1:12:46] was a great thing but now we have more
[1:12:48] than an open Vision do you realize that
[1:12:50] this morning we've got more than an open
[1:12:52] Vision we've got an open
[1:12:54] book that's right go back to perfect
[1:12:56] faith brother brand said the the the
[1:12:58] word is greater than the vision that's
[1:12:59] right yes
[1:13:01] sir so he said he said when you speak
[1:13:05] thus sayi the lord it's not you watch on
[1:13:06] the platform have you ever seen it fail
[1:13:07] have you ever seen it fail there's a
[1:13:10] prophet right thus sayith the Lord is
[1:13:13] perfect never has failed and as long as
[1:13:16] it's thus sayith the Lord it can't
[1:13:18] fail but so far he's protected me
[1:13:22] because I've waited on him yes I haven't
[1:13:25] tried to seek popularity or vain Glory
[1:13:28] of men I've tried my best to live humble
[1:13:31] live the kind of a life I think a
[1:13:32] Christian should live he said and I
[1:13:35] haven't been able to do that within
[1:13:36] myself but he has done it until this day
[1:13:39] he said as I say he is the one that's
[1:13:42] led me we believe God speaks we believe
[1:13:44] God still leads we believe the sons of
[1:13:46] God are led by the spirit of God I'm not
[1:13:48] telling you God never spoke to you I'm
[1:13:50] telling you check it out with the word
[1:13:52] yes sir brother Brandon said if you have
[1:13:53] a strange feeling or want feel that to
[1:13:55] do something he said check it out with
[1:13:57] the word and consult your pastor why do
[1:14:00] you consult your pastor not because he's
[1:14:01] some super spiritual man that'll have a
[1:14:03] dream or a vision about it he might but
[1:14:05] but most of the time they don't most
[1:14:07] pastors are not also prophets but but
[1:14:10] did you know did you know that sometimes
[1:14:12] the pastor might know something you
[1:14:14] don't know about a situation that's why
[1:14:16] we check it out with the word and
[1:14:17] consult the
[1:14:19] pastor right and I don't mean you have
[1:14:21] to consult the pastor about every little
[1:14:22] detail of your life because I know I've
[1:14:25] told you before I know some things I
[1:14:27] know more about antiques than I do about
[1:14:29] modern things I don't know much about
[1:14:32] cars I have a terrible history with cars
[1:14:35] buying cars and then them breaking down
[1:14:37] on me so if you ask me which car to buy
[1:14:40] I'm probably not going to be able to
[1:14:41] give you that answer correctly I have an
[1:14:44] opinion but it's not very
[1:14:47] good right I don't mean I don't have an
[1:14:50] opinion but don't take that as thus
[1:14:52] sayth the
[1:14:53] Lord are you with me Church church so
[1:14:56] how how do we know when God speaks we
[1:14:59] want to know don't we he said my sheep
[1:15:01] hear my voice and a stranger they won't
[1:15:04] fall we want to know that God has spoken
[1:15:06] I believe you're the elect I don't
[1:15:08] believe you'll be deceived but we don't
[1:15:10] want people to be misled we don't want
[1:15:12] because we see you know problems come
[1:15:14] and people come and speak things that
[1:15:17] that cause people to move in a certain
[1:15:19] direction and and maybe they wouldn't
[1:15:20] have done that at all if they just went
[1:15:22] by the word but they do it because
[1:15:23] somebody said so all right and so the
[1:15:26] first thing we want to know is when we
[1:15:28] want to know if God is speaking or when
[1:15:31] God speaks first of all does it come to
[1:15:35] pass not 99 times out of a hundred but a
[1:15:39] hundred times out of a
[1:15:43] hundred now see God told Moses he said
[1:15:46] he said I'm going to raise up a prophet
[1:15:47] like unto you I know I'm teaching this
[1:15:50] morning but just just hang with me God
[1:15:52] said I'm going to raise up a prophet
[1:15:53] like unto you and what was he telling
[1:15:55] Moses he was saying there's going to be
[1:15:56] someone come in the form of a son of man
[1:15:59] a son of man and he'll speak and that's
[1:16:02] what Hebrews 1 is saying when he speaks
[1:16:05] right that's what Peter's saying hear
[1:16:07] him right because what he says comes to
[1:16:10] pass and after he says that Deuteronomy
[1:16:12] 18 God tells Moses that in verse 21 if
[1:16:15] thou say in thine heart how shall we
[1:16:17] know the word which the Lord hath not
[1:16:20] spoken when a prophet speaketh in the
[1:16:22] name of the Lord if the thing
[1:16:25] follow not nor come to pass that is the
[1:16:30] thing which the Lord hath not spoken but
[1:16:33] the prophet has spoken it
[1:16:35] presumptuously Thou shalt not be
[1:16:38] afraid of
[1:16:42] him now what does that mean you don't
[1:16:44] have to follow
[1:16:45] him you don't have to listen to
[1:16:48] him right you don't have
[1:16:51] to right you you listen to a person
[1:16:54] that's a privilege to them you're the
[1:16:57] bride of Christ you don't have to listen
[1:16:59] to everything that comes down the pike
[1:17:01] everybody that tells you thus said the
[1:17:03] Lord or they got a vision or they got a
[1:17:04] feeling or they got a sensation or
[1:17:06] they've got something you don't have to
[1:17:07] listen to all of that don't make
[1:17:08] yourself vulnerable to all of that go by
[1:17:10] the word and then within your own self
[1:17:13] grow to a place of maturity maybe you
[1:17:15] could have a vision maybe you could have
[1:17:16] a dream maybe you could be led by God
[1:17:19] but don't let somebody lead you around
[1:17:20] by the nose cuz they say they're
[1:17:22] spiritual then you find out they're not
[1:17:23] even living it at all
[1:17:28] CU you know the life that you live you
[1:17:29] don't know anybody
[1:17:32] else now
[1:17:34] look he said Thou shalt not be afraid of
[1:17:37] him brother brandom says this he said
[1:17:38] I'm seeking the Lord now before the
[1:17:40] change of his ministry he said to find
[1:17:42] out a real straight message from God he
[1:17:44] said I by God's help I just aim to hold
[1:17:46] on until he comes he said that's till he
[1:17:48] makes some statement to me there's
[1:17:51] something that's fixing to happen around
[1:17:52] here and I want to know what it is I
[1:17:54] want to know directly from God so I can
[1:17:56] say it's thus sayeth the Lord he said
[1:17:58] and then you can the people then will
[1:18:00] know that it isn't me so I want to try
[1:18:02] to make it so that or hear from him
[1:18:04] first because if he puts his words in a
[1:18:07] person he said well then it's not the
[1:18:08] person anymore it's him and if the man
[1:18:11] is saying it in himself it won't amount
[1:18:13] to anything anyhow but if he's the word
[1:18:15] of the Lord is in the man it'll come
[1:18:17] forth and then it'll be just exactly
[1:18:19] right he quotes that scripture we read
[1:18:20] in Deuteronomy he said that's how God
[1:18:23] has he said he's got his regular program
[1:18:25] laid out here where in the Bible we know
[1:18:29] how to read that out but there's certain
[1:18:31] things he said to the church to the time
[1:18:33] and things he hasn't got written here in
[1:18:34] the Bible so he puts his voice into a
[1:18:37] person and they speak it Forward see
[1:18:40] speak it forth so then the way to judge
[1:18:43] that person find out whether it happens
[1:18:45] the way they say it he said then if it
[1:18:47] does then keeps hat then keeps happening
[1:18:50] that way not just it happened once but
[1:18:51] it keeps happening he said then we know
[1:18:54] that come from the Lord then we have
[1:18:56] confidence then to make ready for the
[1:18:58] things that's coming oh my so so the
[1:19:02] word speaks to make us ready but we
[1:19:04] cannot be made ready if it's an
[1:19:06] uncertain sound now so make sure it
[1:19:08] comes to pass what else we want to make
[1:19:10] sure it stands the word
[1:19:12] test right in other words it doesn't
[1:19:14] contradict the
[1:19:16] word right because if and then our
[1:19:19] example earlier if if someone told you
[1:19:21] go Mar go divorce your wife and marry
[1:19:23] somebody that else that's not the word
[1:19:26] go divorce your husband marry somebody
[1:19:27] else that's not the word the holy spirit
[1:19:30] will never tell you to do
[1:19:32] that right no matter how good you feel
[1:19:34] about it and how it just never will tell
[1:19:36] you to do that right it just can't do
[1:19:39] that because he will not speak against
[1:19:41] his word and so brother Brandon said if
[1:19:43] the gift won't be corrected by the word
[1:19:46] he said it wasn't a true
[1:19:48] gift right because if it won't take
[1:19:50] correction of the word if it won't come
[1:19:52] in the word order it's not a true gift
[1:19:53] Galatians 1:8 but we are an angel from
[1:19:55] heaven preach any other gospel unto you
[1:19:57] than that which we have preached unto
[1:19:59] you let him be a curse Revelation 22:18
[1:20:01] he said I testify unto every man that
[1:20:03] Hearth the words of the prophecy of this
[1:20:04] book If any man shall add unto these
[1:20:07] things God shall add unto him the
[1:20:08] plagues that are written in this book
[1:20:09] and if any man someone say any man shall
[1:20:12] take away from the words of the book of
[1:20:13] this prophecy God shall take away his
[1:20:16] part out of the book of life out of the
[1:20:18] holy city and from the things which are
[1:20:19] written in this
[1:20:21] book so the word only comes who does the
[1:20:25] word come to Amos 3:7 a
[1:20:27] prophet brother brand said the word only
[1:20:29] comes to the
[1:20:30] prophet right and a prophet's
[1:20:33] credentials is that he stays with the
[1:20:37] word see that takes all the uncertainty
[1:20:40] out of it
[1:20:41] church and we can't brother brandom told
[1:20:44] the Pentecostal people he said I want to
[1:20:46] get you away from this fear and scare
[1:20:49] bring you up to where you're settled and
[1:20:50] you're not babies anymore you're growing
[1:20:53] up into the grace of God you you're not
[1:20:55] you're not just going by every wind of
[1:20:57] Doctrine and every little whim that
[1:20:58] comes along and you just change with
[1:21:00] this and change with that but actually
[1:21:03] it's got to be something that settles
[1:21:05] you and the word is what does that so if
[1:21:09] it isn't in Bible in the scriptures or
[1:21:11] in the Bible order it can't be received
[1:21:15] as God
[1:21:17] speaking I want to I want to bring this
[1:21:19] down real close if Paul said to do it a
[1:21:21] certain way and we don't do it that way
[1:21:24] it's not God yeah right yes it's not God
[1:21:29] right especially if it's corrected and
[1:21:32] it's still doesn't do it the right way
[1:21:35] brother brandom said it's not
[1:21:36] God and and
[1:21:39] you getting real close
[1:21:41] now right it now it's Believers brother
[1:21:44] BR he's talking by the prophet it's
[1:21:46] Believers watch for the Fulfillment of
[1:21:48] what their Prophet said that's what I'm
[1:21:49] looking
[1:21:50] for right CU anybody could tell you
[1:21:52] anything but I'm watching for the
[1:21:53] Fulfillment of what my Prophet said and
[1:21:57] my Prophet is William brandom right and
[1:22:00] and why do you say that not because the
[1:22:02] man was anything great but because God
[1:22:04] spoke through that man it never
[1:22:06] missed and he was proved and Vindicated
[1:22:09] to be a prophet so I'm waiting for the
[1:22:11] Fulfillment of what their Prophet said
[1:22:13] and that's identification that they are
[1:22:14] God's prophets because first he said
[1:22:16] they're inspired next they stay exactly
[1:22:20] with the word of the hour he said then
[1:22:22] that's his
[1:22:23] credentials see and it won't contradict
[1:22:26] what another Prophet previously
[1:22:28] said right so we know that a prophet
[1:22:31] can't come along and tell us we can't
[1:22:32] have
[1:22:33] preachers when a word Prophet told us we
[1:22:36] have a five-fold
[1:22:37] ministry right so the second prophet
[1:22:40] come can't come around and change that I
[1:22:41] think we all agree with that
[1:22:43] right well also a word Prophet can't
[1:22:45] come and tell us that no brother brand
[1:22:48] didn't know what he was talking about
[1:22:49] and he you know he didn't really know
[1:22:51] what he was talking about when he put
[1:22:53] the gifts in order Paul didn't really
[1:22:54] know what he was talking about we're
[1:22:55] just going to do it differently now how
[1:22:58] could he do that he can't do that are
[1:23:01] you with me now it can't be received as
[1:23:04] God speaking because you don't know if
[1:23:06] it's God or not right right and if it
[1:23:08] isn't in order it's not with the word
[1:23:10] right now one of the ways God speaks is
[1:23:12] by gifts and we're going to deal with
[1:23:14] that just a little bit and then then
[1:23:16] then I'll let you go because gifts are
[1:23:18] speaking something not written in the
[1:23:20] word right that's the purpose of the
[1:23:22] nine spiritual gifts if it's something
[1:23:24] written the word then I can say it as a
[1:23:26] preacher we don't need the gifts for
[1:23:28] that right we we've got men that can
[1:23:31] preach that that's our job is to rightly
[1:23:33] divide the
[1:23:35] word right because a gift could operate
[1:23:37] through a woman or through a man right
[1:23:40] they don't they don't come and bring the
[1:23:41] word right a woman doesn't come in then
[1:23:43] stand up in the in here and bring the
[1:23:44] word to us right we we we believe that's
[1:23:47] ordered of me the men do that men who
[1:23:50] are called of God right and and the same
[1:23:54] the same same chapter in 1 Corinthians
[1:23:56] 14 where Paul says I suffer not a woman
[1:23:57] to teach or you serve authority over a
[1:23:59] man it's the same chapter that he talks
[1:24:01] about setting the gifts in
[1:24:02] order right so one of the ways that God
[1:24:05] speaks in is by gifts now gifts have to
[1:24:08] be judged before they can be given to
[1:24:11] the church you ever ask yourself
[1:24:13] why because you don't know if it's God
[1:24:16] or
[1:24:18] not right no matter who's
[1:24:21] talking you don't know if it's God or
[1:24:24] not yes now again if it's the word if
[1:24:28] it's the word just the word just
[1:24:29] speaking the word then it is God right
[1:24:32] because God is his word but God don't
[1:24:34] need a gift to do
[1:24:35] that but the gift is something that
[1:24:38] comes and tells you there's something
[1:24:39] going to happen and you need to stay
[1:24:41] away from a certain place at a certain
[1:24:43] time so it's something specific to
[1:24:45] someone
[1:24:47] specific so so how how do you give a
[1:24:49] gift the word test you see if it comes
[1:24:51] in the order of the word because it
[1:24:53] wouldn't be something written in the
[1:24:54] word but it's got to come in the order
[1:24:55] of the word so if it won't come in order
[1:24:58] it's not the Lord Paul says let the
[1:25:00] prophets speak two or three and let the
[1:25:01] other judge and I know people interpret
[1:25:03] this verse very differently in different
[1:25:05] ways but a prophet of God interpreted it
[1:25:07] over and over and over again for us the
[1:25:10] same way every time and he he talks
[1:25:13] about in speaking of Prophecy or tongues
[1:25:15] because tongues interpreted as prophecy
[1:25:18] we don't have to wonder how Paul would
[1:25:19] apply that in a church like ours because
[1:25:22] a word prophet in our day showed us how
[1:25:24] to apply it he said watch what Paul says
[1:25:27] if one speaks with tongues and the other
[1:25:28] one interpret whatever he said let it be
[1:25:30] judged first before the church can
[1:25:33] receive
[1:25:34] it in 1 Corinthians 14:29 we find out
[1:25:37] any gift in the church has got to be
[1:25:39] judged first that first one was in 1953
[1:25:42] the second quote's in 1964 brother Bram
[1:25:44] never changes on this he said you have
[1:25:47] to watch because evil spirit slip in
[1:25:49] because remember the rain falls on the
[1:25:51] just and the unjust the same rain that
[1:25:52] was sent to ripen the weat also ripens
[1:25:53] the weed the same water a church I want
[1:25:56] the gifts in operation I want them to
[1:25:58] move but when the gifts are operating
[1:26:00] correctly they're in the church like the
[1:26:03] Ephesian church when you didn't even
[1:26:04] know they were
[1:26:06] happening are you with me now they were
[1:26:08] in the Ephesian Church Paul don't even
[1:26:09] have to deal with it they were in
[1:26:11] order right but they could take the meat
[1:26:13] of the word because they had moved to a
[1:26:16] place of maturity that's where we're
[1:26:18] called to be in this hour we are not
[1:26:20] called to be a Corinthians church called
[1:26:22] to be an Ephesians Church
[1:26:26] not another Corinthians but another
[1:26:28] Ephesians so he said the same rain that
[1:26:31] was sent to ripen the wheat Rens the
[1:26:32] weed the same water God has a law now on
[1:26:34] this in the law of the spirit you have
[1:26:36] to watch because Satan slips in and Paul
[1:26:38] when something was revealed to somebody
[1:26:40] it had to have at least two or three
[1:26:41] judges before it could be told before
[1:26:43] the
[1:26:43] church right and that's not one or two
[1:26:46] places I read you two places it's dozens
[1:26:48] of places brother brandham says that so
[1:26:51] if it isn't judged by two or three with
[1:26:53] a gift of wisdom or deser ger of spirits
[1:26:55] it isn't right with the word and you
[1:26:58] shouldn't receive it as thus sayith the
[1:27:00] Lord right so the only gift that isn't
[1:27:03] judged is a sear right a prophet well
[1:27:07] the Brandon makes that distinction
[1:27:08] dozens of times he said every gift has
[1:27:11] to be judged except the word Prophet why
[1:27:14] because the word comes to the prophet
[1:27:16] right and and and the one we were
[1:27:18] promised in this day has already come
[1:27:21] we're not looking for another what they
[1:27:23] say when they were looking they said
[1:27:25] shouldn't Elias first come and Jesus
[1:27:26] said he already came right but Elias
[1:27:29] shall come and restore all things the
[1:27:30] one that promised that would come has
[1:27:32] come and he has restored all things and
[1:27:34] we're standing here with an open book
[1:27:36] that we have the word of God in our a we
[1:27:38] don't have to guess at these things
[1:27:40] church we don't have to be vulnerable to
[1:27:42] these things we don't have to be
[1:27:43] wondering whether I'm saved or whether
[1:27:45] I'm not whether I can be healed or
[1:27:47] whether I can't or whether I can be free
[1:27:48] or whether I can't no the word tells me
[1:27:50] I'm free the word tells me I'm safe the
[1:27:53] word tells me
[1:27:54] I can live that I'm going to make it in
[1:27:56] a Rapture the word tells me not because
[1:27:58] a man stood there and told me but the
[1:28:00] word speaking through men that's told me
[1:28:03] that I can judge it by the
[1:28:07] word so then if somebody says well I'm a
[1:28:10] prophet too that you have to be that
[1:28:13] Prophet or an impersonator there's no in
[1:28:16] between right it there just not church
[1:28:20] I'm not trying to be harsh but I got to
[1:28:21] clinch this in and and move on you know
[1:28:24] know me I don't just Hammer these things
[1:28:25] and move but it's just church you
[1:28:31] don't I'm living proof of overcoming
[1:28:36] that
[1:28:37] thing but I also know the damage it can
[1:28:43] cause I've been there I've seen
[1:28:46] it and some of y'all have too that's why
[1:28:49] we don't just jump on every bandwagon
[1:28:51] that comes down the street because we
[1:28:53] know these things this isn't the first
[1:28:55] time it's happened it's happened many
[1:28:56] times before and we just and again I'm
[1:28:58] not preaching any certain situation I'm
[1:29:00] just for us let's stay with the word
[1:29:03] let's believe what God says let's
[1:29:04] believe that we're healed because God
[1:29:05] says we're healed let's believe that
[1:29:07] we're saved because God says we're saved
[1:29:09] let's believe that how can I give these
[1:29:10] young people just a say well dream come
[1:29:13] to me they don't know if a dream come to
[1:29:14] me and I've told you I'm a I'm a dreamer
[1:29:17] I have dreams and I can tell my dreams
[1:29:19] and it may mean something it may not
[1:29:20] mean something but I'll tell you what
[1:29:22] what I can tell you I can tell tell you
[1:29:24] by the Landon that God is for you I can
[1:29:26] tell you that he's with you I can tell
[1:29:28] you that he loves you why because the
[1:29:29] word says that are you with me now the
[1:29:32] Bible tells you that I can tell you
[1:29:34] young girls that that he wants to save
[1:29:36] he wants to fill you with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:38] he wants you to be free he wants you to
[1:29:40] worship he wants you to why can't I say
[1:29:42] that because God said so in his word you
[1:29:44] don't have to take my word for it take
[1:29:46] the word of the Lord you can read the
[1:29:48] same thing that I preach right in the
[1:29:50] Bible you can read the same thing that
[1:29:52] we preach right in the message of the
[1:29:53] hour
[1:29:55] are you with me now you can check it and
[1:29:57] see it's never failed it's never been
[1:30:00] wrong it's always the
[1:30:02] same we were not we're not going to be
[1:30:04] spoken into the Rapture by by fallible
[1:30:07] gifts by gifts with a margin of error
[1:30:10] we're going to be spoken into the
[1:30:11] Rapture by the spoken word of a prophet
[1:30:13] that begins to speak through a bride who
[1:30:15] becomes the final voice to the final
[1:30:22] age good
[1:30:26] another thing we could use to say is it
[1:30:28] the Lord and not is it
[1:30:31] specific right the Bible says when you
[1:30:34] pray use not vain
[1:30:35] repetitions see he said they think they
[1:30:37] should be heard for their much speaking
[1:30:38] the heathens do we don't just repeat
[1:30:43] ourselves right we should ask God for
[1:30:46] something in prayer and hold on to it
[1:30:50] brother BR said I believe in speaking in
[1:30:51] tongues I believe in interpretation but
[1:30:52] it must be something Direct ly to the
[1:30:54] church not the Lord is coming soon or
[1:30:57] something which is all right but don't
[1:30:58] use vain repetitions Jesus said as
[1:31:00] heathens do you say well that's not what
[1:31:02] that scripture means brother brandom
[1:31:03] said it
[1:31:05] did right the Divine the revealer of the
[1:31:08] truth in our day said it
[1:31:10] did again he said now you see but many
[1:31:12] times in our churches we permit people
[1:31:14] just to raise up even when you're
[1:31:15] preaching speaking tongues making an
[1:31:16] altar call somebody speak in tongues
[1:31:18] somebody too and give interpretations he
[1:31:20] said merily one of them I believe I
[1:31:22] believe the person is genuinely speaking
[1:31:23] in tongu T he said but I believe the
[1:31:25] other is more or less prophesying CU
[1:31:26] some will speak in tongues maybe for
[1:31:28] five minutes and the other one give four
[1:31:30] words of interpretation see it has to be
[1:31:31] at the same sound the same rise and fall
[1:31:34] of voice he said and then again if they
[1:31:37] say it and it doesn't come to pass then
[1:31:38] get that evil spirit away from you he
[1:31:41] said you don't want that in my
[1:31:42] Tabernacle he said when one speaks like
[1:31:44] that he better have it he said it's
[1:31:45] wrote down if it doesn't come to pass
[1:31:47] they get that evil spirit out of them
[1:31:48] I'll tell you well that was just for
[1:31:50] brother Brown's Tabernacle he's not
[1:31:51] preaching to his Tabernacle in this
[1:31:52] quote he's preaching somewhere
[1:31:55] else and and we've confirmed they
[1:31:57] actually did that at the Tabernacle just
[1:31:59] speaking to brother Kenny caps whose uh
[1:32:01] father is was brother caps who led songs
[1:32:04] brother Kenny's kind of a he may watch
[1:32:06] this brother Kenny's kind of a funny guy
[1:32:08] you know he's all over the place and
[1:32:09] excitable but I like brother Kenny but
[1:32:11] he he's just all over the place
[1:32:13] but but he uh he did tell me I asked him
[1:32:16] and some of the brothers were with him a
[1:32:18] couple weeks ago what did Brother
[1:32:19] brandham do about this in the Tabernacle
[1:32:21] cuz I had been told that it never
[1:32:22] happened brother Kenny told us that it
[1:32:24] did happen that they actually wrote
[1:32:28] Things in and they read it over the
[1:32:29] pulpit he said my dad read it he said
[1:32:32] and then if it didn't come to pass they
[1:32:34] come up got up and they told the people
[1:32:36] it's the evil spirit it didn't come to
[1:32:40] pass and brother BR tells us they did
[1:32:42] that at his church they actually did
[1:32:45] it and so he said it's got to be exact
[1:32:48] not some repeating Jesus said don't use
[1:32:50] vain repetitions as heathens do it's got
[1:32:51] to be something directly to somebody or
[1:32:54] to help the church or to help the cause
[1:32:56] he said that's wrote right down and the
[1:32:57] people who speak with tongues them great
[1:32:59] gifts help the body of Christ they meet
[1:33:00] hours before we ever get there and the
[1:33:02] Holy Spirit Works through them and it's
[1:33:04] put on the desk and we tell out what
[1:33:05] they've said here and if it doesn't
[1:33:06] happen right as it said it did happen
[1:33:08] then they cannot do that no more till
[1:33:10] that evil spirit is out of
[1:33:12] them now why does something have to be
[1:33:14] specific non-specific prophecy is
[1:33:16] dangerous so you have prophecy that's
[1:33:18] just somebody repeating something in
[1:33:20] scripture and they get up and they say
[1:33:22] they prophesy and it's it's read
[1:33:23] harmless because it's basically what a
[1:33:26] preacher would do right but it's out of
[1:33:29] place right but it's relatively harmless
[1:33:31] but then you have prophecies where it's
[1:33:33] specific or sort of
[1:33:36] specific right and so I know of a
[1:33:38] situation where two girls both thought
[1:33:40] they had to marry a preacher because a
[1:33:43] person spoke to their general area of
[1:33:46] the congregation and said uh you got to
[1:33:48] marry a preacher and and two girls both
[1:33:52] took that to heart
[1:33:54] now what do they do with that but if it
[1:33:57] was true but it was only meant for one
[1:33:58] of them prophecy has to be specific to
[1:34:02] not only specific in its nature but
[1:34:03] specific to a person that's why brother
[1:34:06] Brandon would say oh they're going to
[1:34:07] miss it Miss so and so right called them
[1:34:11] by
[1:34:12] name right if God can talk to your
[1:34:14] specific problem he can speak your name
[1:34:16] too all
[1:34:18] right right so now so again it's got to
[1:34:22] be specific does it glorify God God or
[1:34:24] the person
[1:34:26] speaking and we we could take that to
[1:34:28] Ministry
[1:34:29] too does the ministry glorify God or the
[1:34:32] person preaching does the prophecy
[1:34:34] glorify God or the person speaking
[1:34:37] what's the purpose of the prophecy is it
[1:34:38] to build a kingdom to build a church to
[1:34:40] promote a Ministry or is it to help the
[1:34:43] church 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak
[1:34:46] with the tongues of men and of angels
[1:34:47] and have not charity that's love I'm
[1:34:49] become a sounding brass or tinkling
[1:34:51] symbol oh I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:34:53] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:34:55] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:34:56] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:34:58] not charity I nothing so he said I'm
[1:35:00] going to show you a more excellent way a
[1:35:02] way that you can know whether things are
[1:35:03] right or not and that's when it's
[1:35:05] operated by
[1:35:06] love right and when it's operated by
[1:35:08] love it don't tear up the
[1:35:12] church don't tear up people's
[1:35:17] lives brother BR he taught us that now
[1:35:20] and and Paul taught us that now so we we
[1:35:23] must consider when we talk when we say
[1:35:26] and this goes for all of us when we say
[1:35:28] the Lord told me something if you ever
[1:35:30] tell your kids brother brandom
[1:35:32] said you know what you're telling that
[1:35:34] kid God said something because we
[1:35:35] believe God spoke through a prophet so
[1:35:38] you sit there and Hammer him over the
[1:35:39] head and say brother brandham said for
[1:35:40] you not to do that you better make sure
[1:35:41] brother Bram actually said
[1:35:46] that because I've been told some things
[1:35:48] we won't get into them this morning that
[1:35:49] brother brand said all my life and I
[1:35:51] can't find them
[1:35:55] so brother brandom said it doesn't
[1:35:57] always work and what you're putting the
[1:35:58] authority of a prophet behind something
[1:36:01] are you with me now so we must consider
[1:36:04] what the thing we are saying in the name
[1:36:06] of the Lord might do to the person who
[1:36:07] hears it we got to think before we tell
[1:36:11] say well I can't control it then it's
[1:36:12] not a you shouldn't you shouldn't be
[1:36:13] operating it then right it hasn't come
[1:36:16] to maturity in your life because the
[1:36:18] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[1:36:21] prophets there's many things that Jesus
[1:36:23] couldn't tell his disciples he says and
[1:36:25] I've used this to uh promote short
[1:36:27] sermons before but we won't use it that
[1:36:29] way this
[1:36:30] morning but this is in John 16:12 he
[1:36:34] said I have yet many things to say unto
[1:36:36] you but you cannot bear them
[1:36:39] now you can see that how that would
[1:36:41] apply to a preacher but there's things
[1:36:43] that Jesus held back because they had
[1:36:45] not come to a place of maturity they
[1:36:47] could receive
[1:36:48] it and he said I see things that's
[1:36:50] coming up and you can't tell people he
[1:36:52] said you see different different things
[1:36:54] and you're forbidden them visions that
[1:36:56] they call on sometimes they'd be sorry
[1:36:58] if you did tell them and you know better
[1:37:00] than to do it yeah all right right it's
[1:37:02] not just being able to do something it's
[1:37:03] knowing when and
[1:37:05] how and and that goes for that goes for
[1:37:08] preachers and pastors and
[1:37:10] deacons doctors right first Do no
[1:37:14] harm right make sure you're mature
[1:37:17] enough to handle the message that you
[1:37:20] have and so he says I see these things
[1:37:23] and then visions that they call and
[1:37:24] sometimes they'd be sorry if you did
[1:37:25] tell them and you know better than to do
[1:37:27] it and you find out things about people
[1:37:29] that you wish you didn't know he said
[1:37:31] the people that desires these things to
[1:37:33] know these things they don't realize
[1:37:35] what type this type of ministry cost you
[1:37:37] don't know what goes with it he said
[1:37:39] then it throws into desperation Lord God
[1:37:41] I know I'm going to have to answer
[1:37:43] listen our preaching ought to be in
[1:37:44] desperation our prophecy our gifts
[1:37:47] whatever it is should be in desperation
[1:37:49] Lord I know I have to answer for what I
[1:37:51] say and I'd rather never
[1:37:54] speak than to speak something that would
[1:37:57] be
[1:37:59] wrong lastly does it edify the
[1:38:02] body Paul says I'd rather you use gifts
[1:38:06] that edify the
[1:38:07] body so he talks about unknown tongues
[1:38:09] that would be tongues and I believe in
[1:38:11] tongues I believe as Paul said I wish
[1:38:14] you all spoke with tongues I do speak in
[1:38:16] tongues I have brother brandham talked
[1:38:19] about it not something that happened all
[1:38:20] the time in his life but he spoke a
[1:38:21] several instances where he spoke in
[1:38:23] tongues
[1:38:24] and I have spoken tongues and I believe
[1:38:26] in it I I believe in it but it was not
[1:38:29] an interpretable
[1:38:30] tongue right it was a tongue that helped
[1:38:33] me because I believe the Lord was
[1:38:34] praying through me but I didn't know
[1:38:36] what it
[1:38:37] said right so he that speaketh in an
[1:38:40] unknown tongue edifieth himself but he
[1:38:43] that prophesieth edifieth the church he
[1:38:45] said I would that you all spake with
[1:38:47] tongues but rather that you prophesied
[1:38:50] for greater is he that prophesieth than
[1:38:52] he that speaketh with tongues except he
[1:38:53] interpret that the church may receive
[1:38:56] edifying see what we're saying must
[1:38:58] edify the body therefore we must be sure
[1:39:01] when we're saying what we're saying that
[1:39:03] it's right because false prophecies
[1:39:05] destroy confidence in the body and so
[1:39:09] brother BR says God has set in the
[1:39:10] church God not the organization not the
[1:39:11] achievement of man to make Bishops and
[1:39:13] so forth presor but God set in the
[1:39:15] church first apostles that's missionary
[1:39:17] secondary prophets teachers pastors
[1:39:19] evangelists God set them in the church
[1:39:21] he said and every bugle will blow the
[1:39:23] same the same gospel see he said if he's
[1:39:27] a prophet he blows the bugle of a
[1:39:29] prophet so in God's five part if you can
[1:39:32] say it like this like a like a five
[1:39:34] piece Orchestra each one's playing a
[1:39:36] different instrument but each one's
[1:39:38] playing the same
[1:39:40] tune right and they compliment one
[1:39:43] another so if he's a prophet he blows
[1:39:45] the bugle of a prophet he foretells the
[1:39:47] things that is to come and hits every
[1:39:51] time so Brother brandom Talks to
[1:39:53] 12-year-old little girl my heart's to
[1:39:55] these young people today and and and
[1:39:57] also to all of
[1:40:00] us listen when a man tells you he stands
[1:40:03] it for God he's a
[1:40:05] preacher and he stands up here and
[1:40:07] preaches before you and then lives any
[1:40:08] kind of a life goes home and throws
[1:40:10] things cusses people out throws
[1:40:14] fits I've dealt with people for
[1:40:16] years because their fathers or their
[1:40:19] pastors did that kind of a thing and
[1:40:21] years later they're still scarred by
[1:40:23] that they don't know whether to listen
[1:40:25] to The Prophet or not they don't know
[1:40:26] whether they believe the message or not
[1:40:27] many
[1:40:29] times because of the way Dad acted
[1:40:31] because of the way the the pastor acted
[1:40:33] or whoever else it was in their life I
[1:40:36] say there's healing for that church how
[1:40:38] do you know where the been because I
[1:40:40] know I've been
[1:40:42] there I've questioned myself and I had
[1:40:45] to come to the realization that God did
[1:40:47] speak in our day and I'm going to
[1:40:48] believe that I'm going to believe in an
[1:40:51] open book I'm going to believe in a word
[1:40:53] that come to me that was true I'm going
[1:40:56] to stand on
[1:40:59] that somebody that represents God to you
[1:41:03] fails it shakes your
[1:41:05] confidence but look at those who haven't
[1:41:10] failed look at those who are preaching
[1:41:13] the truth look at those who do stand for
[1:41:16] the
[1:41:17] gospel and let that be a a reinforcement
[1:41:20] of your faith not just the man but the
[1:41:23] you believe that when they do speak that
[1:41:25] they speak sparingly they don't just say
[1:41:27] God said about everything but that you
[1:41:29] could have confidence if they did say it
[1:41:30] would be right God had a prophet we had
[1:41:33] a prophet in our day God sent a prophet
[1:41:36] behold I sent unto you Elijah the
[1:41:37] prophet before the coming of the great
[1:41:39] and Dreadful day of the Lord amen I I
[1:41:41] believe he's come he turned the hearts
[1:41:43] of the children back to the
[1:41:47] fathers brother Bram said he's talking
[1:41:49] to this 12-year-old little girl and she
[1:41:51] come to brother brandham and she brought
[1:41:52] him a dream and she come to me and she
[1:41:55] said why didn't you interpret my dream
[1:41:58] you know little kids have confidence in
[1:42:00] you and they believe that if you say
[1:42:02] let's have Youth Services you'll have
[1:42:04] youth services so we try to
[1:42:07] comply little kids have
[1:42:09] confidence how dare we abuse
[1:42:14] that these men you you just forgive me
[1:42:17] these men standing in prayer line
[1:42:18] speaking things to young people you
[1:42:20] better be
[1:42:22] sure you know what I speak to them most
[1:42:24] of the time when I'm praying up here you
[1:42:25] know what I'm going got you on a great
[1:42:27] Revelation you know when I'm praying for
[1:42:29] people and when I'm when they're coming
[1:42:31] through the prayer line and when I'm
[1:42:32] speaking to them you know what I speak
[1:42:33] to them most of the time in the name of
[1:42:37] Jesus because I know that's
[1:42:39] right in the name of
[1:42:42] Jesus lay my hands on him in the name of
[1:42:44] Jesus where do you get that from from a
[1:42:46] prophet it's what a prophet did when
[1:42:48] they come by him in the name not that
[1:42:49] you couldn't say anything else and even
[1:42:51] sometimes it'd be right listen church
[1:42:52] I'm not doing away with that God could
[1:42:54] speak in that way sure but let it be
[1:42:57] something that's right we got to make
[1:42:59] sure that it's right before we say
[1:43:02] it and and you that hear it take it back
[1:43:05] to the word and if the shoe Don't Fit
[1:43:07] Don't you wear
[1:43:11] that brother brandom said when you find
[1:43:13] a man that's got every interpretation
[1:43:15] just like
[1:43:17] this I got every just like that in the
[1:43:19] name of the Lord I said you be careful
[1:43:20] about that that's contrary to the
[1:43:22] scripture yes those gimmicks that's got
[1:43:24] every answer be careful he's talking to
[1:43:25] this 12-year-old girl when somebody
[1:43:27] stands up and speaks in the name of the
[1:43:29] Lord that must be true it must be
[1:43:31] exactly the truth he said you might in
[1:43:33] your mind be impressed I said now honey
[1:43:35] I believe I could tell you what I think
[1:43:36] your dream is but to tell you in the
[1:43:38] name of the Lord no sir I said have I
[1:43:41] ever spoke to you in the name of the
[1:43:42] Lord but what had happened I said
[1:43:44] thousands has come and said this that I
[1:43:46] cannot tell you what what your dream is
[1:43:47] till I see it over again and then he
[1:43:49] tells me then I can say the Lord told me
[1:43:52] until then I don't
[1:43:54] know look at the humility he had this is
[1:43:57] a major prophet he said I don't want to
[1:43:59] take listens important my own
[1:44:03] influence because a man has influence
[1:44:06] and when you say something you want to
[1:44:07] he says something you want to believe it
[1:44:09] because you have confidence in the man
[1:44:11] he said I don't want to take my own
[1:44:12] influence and my own opinion I can't say
[1:44:15] thus sayith the Lord because that's me
[1:44:17] thinking it that's best to my opinion he
[1:44:19] said we must be sincere because we've
[1:44:21] got the greatest thing in the world the
[1:44:23] greatest Treasure of Heaven is Christ
[1:44:25] Among Us do you believe that today
[1:44:26] Church why do we want a substitute of
[1:44:28] some little influence to try to make
[1:44:30] ourselves somebody big among somebody
[1:44:32] here why not be a humble servant to
[1:44:35] Christ so brother bandam uses the
[1:44:37] example now you kids listen 's the
[1:44:39] example of a crippled woman a Waterhead
[1:44:42] baby and a dead man so he says if I
[1:44:44] spoke to you and I told you you're going
[1:44:46] to go to the meeting and there's going
[1:44:48] to be a crippled woman and she'll be
[1:44:50] raised she she'll be able to walk and
[1:44:53] there's going to be a Waterhead baby and
[1:44:54] the head will instantly shrink down he
[1:44:56] said and there's going to be a man that
[1:44:57] dies in the congregation and will go
[1:44:59] back and pray for him he be raised from
[1:45:01] the dead he said now if I tell you those
[1:45:03] things he said and they happen you got
[1:45:06] confidence in
[1:45:07] it right he said and then I tell you he
[1:45:11] said so I tell you those three things
[1:45:12] about the meeting and then I tell you
[1:45:14] this he said your little brother is
[1:45:17] going to get run over by a
[1:45:18] truck but don't be
[1:45:21] afraid said he's he's not going to get
[1:45:25] he's going to get killed but don't be
[1:45:27] afraid right and you kids would hate to
[1:45:29] lose your sibling wouldn't you right
[1:45:31] you'd hate to well some of y'all would
[1:45:37] anyway he said don't be
[1:45:40] afraid right he said because I've
[1:45:42] already told you these things he said no
[1:45:45] I'm telling you your your little brother
[1:45:46] he just using this as an example he said
[1:45:48] but your little brother's going to raise
[1:45:49] from the dead he said then you could
[1:45:50] take that to the bank all right yes
[1:45:54] you believe it now now listen what he
[1:45:56] says about this he says now I said then
[1:45:58] if that taken place he said what if you
[1:46:00] went out there then of that woman
[1:46:01] arthritic whatever it was paralyzed
[1:46:03] woman wasn't
[1:46:05] there what if the Waterhead baby wasn't
[1:46:08] there right then you're all mixed up in
[1:46:10] your mind you don't know and I spoke to
[1:46:14] you and told you thus sayth the Lord I
[1:46:15] said then my influence is lost and you
[1:46:18] might need me sometime real bad I said
[1:46:21] but what if the woman is there
[1:46:23] oh Church you realiz what we have in
[1:46:25] this age what if the woman is there what
[1:46:27] if the Waterhead baby is healed what if
[1:46:29] the man is raised from the dead then if
[1:46:31] your little brother gets killed you
[1:46:33] wouldn't even cry you'd say Daddy let me
[1:46:36] have him I'm going to show you the glory
[1:46:38] of God he said why it was right here it
[1:46:42] was right there it was right there every
[1:46:46] time it's right then you know it's right
[1:46:49] I said that's the reason we want to
[1:46:50] believe the word of God now watch where
[1:46:52] he takes to he said that's the reason we
[1:46:54] want to believe the word of God he said
[1:46:57] everything someone say everything
[1:46:59] everything the Bible has ever spoke of
[1:47:02] the Bible says it here history says it
[1:47:05] happened I want you kids to have
[1:47:07] confidence in this book everything the
[1:47:09] Bible says it here the Bible said a
[1:47:11] virgin shall conceive and a virgin did
[1:47:13] conceive the Bible said there be four
[1:47:15] Gentile kingdoms and there were four
[1:47:16] Gentile King the Bible said it and we've
[1:47:19] seen it in history the Bible said there
[1:47:21] be seven Church agents we've seen seven
[1:47:23] Church agents the Bible said it and
[1:47:25] we've seen it
[1:47:27] happen amen oh what confidence that
[1:47:30] ought to give us today we've seen it
[1:47:32] here it was right there it was right
[1:47:33] there it was right now we can have
[1:47:35] confidence it's
[1:47:38] right brand said now we're at the time
[1:47:40] of the Rapture what else does the Bible
[1:47:41] say it speaks of future events it said
[1:47:43] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:47:45] at the last Trump the dead in Christ
[1:47:47] shall rise why does it say that you got
[1:47:49] to have confidence in that you got to be
[1:47:52] able to believe that how can you believe
[1:47:53] it because the Bible was right about a
[1:47:55] virgin conceiving the Bible was the
[1:47:57] Bible was right about a flood coming and
[1:47:59] so you believe the Bible's right about
[1:48:01] the Rapture the Bible's right about oh
[1:48:04] the Bible's right about Malachi 4 the
[1:48:06] Bible's right about Revelation 10:7 how
[1:48:07] do we know because God manifested it he
[1:48:11] brought it to pass and we believe the
[1:48:13] same God who brought a prophet in our
[1:48:15] age the same God that did that same God
[1:48:17] that revealed his word to us and opened
[1:48:18] the book to us that same God will change
[1:48:21] our bodies one of these days it's a more
[1:48:23] sure word of Prophecy something we can
[1:48:25] hang our hat
[1:48:29] on brother BR said now at the time of
[1:48:31] the Rapture it's going to happen because
[1:48:33] it's been perfect every other time it's
[1:48:36] got to be perfect this time God is
[1:48:39] calling out a people see and it's the
[1:48:41] time we've got to be
[1:48:44] sincere he goes on to the same quote he
[1:48:46] says sometimes we find someone spoke in
[1:48:47] tongues the other wants to imitate him
[1:48:49] he'll speak in tongues
[1:48:51] too once he one give an interpretation
[1:48:53] the other one say I got it too and you
[1:48:56] go by
[1:48:57] Impressions and then say thus sayeth the
[1:48:59] Lord well that's
[1:49:01] wrong God Will Never Move you any
[1:49:04] further than what you are right now just
[1:49:07] an
[1:49:08] organization until you get out of that
[1:49:11] yes said be sure don't you say it unless
[1:49:14] God says so and you know that it is the
[1:49:16] truth that God said so not your opinion
[1:49:19] not some impression because you can be
[1:49:21] impressed anyway yeah all right can I
[1:49:24] have five more minutes I've got not been
[1:49:27] quite an
[1:49:28] hour Paul ends his teachings on gifts
[1:49:31] with this 1 Corinthians 13:8 charity
[1:49:32] never faileth but whether they be
[1:49:34] prophecies they shall
[1:49:36] fail whether there be tongues they shall
[1:49:38] cease whether there be knowledge it
[1:49:40] shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:49:42] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:49:45] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:49:47] in part should be done away and I know
[1:49:49] people take that and say oh well praise
[1:49:50] the lord we can prophesy in part then
[1:49:52] wait for which is perfect but listen
[1:49:54] what brother Bram says about
[1:49:56] that again Paul continues on verse 11
[1:50:00] says when I was a child I spake as a
[1:50:02] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:50:04] as a child I had a partial understanding
[1:50:07] when I become a man I put away childish
[1:50:10] things for now we see through a glass
[1:50:12] Darkly but then face to face now I know
[1:50:14] in part but then shall know even as also
[1:50:17] I am
[1:50:18] known now brother brandom if you go
[1:50:20] early in his ministry he always
[1:50:21] interprets this as love that which is
[1:50:23] perfect is love and there's a truth to
[1:50:25] that because love is the
[1:50:27] Capstone right that's true that's that's
[1:50:30] the true thing but after the opening of
[1:50:32] the seals he he brings out a little bit
[1:50:33] more about it and he tells us that the
[1:50:37] that which is perfect is the perfect
[1:50:41] word the opening of the
[1:50:44] seals right and you go to questions and
[1:50:46] answers
[1:50:46] 1964 brother BR said 1 Corinthians 13
[1:50:49] says this when that which is perfect is
[1:50:51] come that which is in part should be
[1:50:51] done away with he say all these little
[1:50:53] things of jumping up and down like a kid
[1:50:55] trying to talk in tongues and all these
[1:50:57] other things when that was just perfect
[1:50:59] and we do have
[1:51:03] today if we had it then we've got it now
[1:51:06] by God's help the perfect interpretation
[1:51:09] of the word with Divine Vindication then
[1:51:12] that which is in part is done away with
[1:51:14] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:51:16] understood as a child when I become a
[1:51:17] man I put away childish things I'm not
[1:51:19] I'm not trying to make something happen
[1:51:21] the gifts are the there but I don't have
[1:51:23] to make them happen you don't take a
[1:51:25] gift for me to have a good service I
[1:51:27] don't worship God cuz I feel like it I
[1:51:29] worship God cuz he's here Among Us and
[1:51:31] he deserves to be
[1:51:36] worshiped the feelings come the gifts
[1:51:38] come the things happen yes we praise God
[1:51:41] for that but that's not our emphasis in
[1:51:44] this hour that which is perfect has come
[1:51:47] he said that which is in part will be
[1:51:49] done away with then that which is
[1:51:51] perfect has come now this is three
[1:51:53] different places in questions and
[1:51:54] answers where he addresses
[1:51:56] this he says now I've got a question on
[1:51:59] that I hope to get it tonight listen
[1:52:00] about what happened when the seals
[1:52:03] opened something happened when the seals
[1:52:06] opened had to do with that which is
[1:52:07] perfect has
[1:52:08] come again he said please explain 1
[1:52:10] Corinthians 13 8-12 the question now
[1:52:14] that the perfect word is restored to the
[1:52:15] church are these verses fulfilled he
[1:52:17] said now I think I just went through
[1:52:19] that didn't I he said when that which is
[1:52:21] perfect has come that which is impartial
[1:52:22] should be done away with Paul said
[1:52:24] though I speak with tongue of men and
[1:52:25] angels do all these things here but when
[1:52:27] that was just perfect has come now is
[1:52:28] there anything perfect but God and we're
[1:52:31] almost done church can you say Amen to
[1:52:33] that there's nothing is perfect but God
[1:52:35] no sir he say it's God the perfect in
[1:52:38] the beginning was
[1:52:40] the the
[1:52:42] word right and the Word was with God and
[1:52:45] the Word was
[1:52:47] God he said the word still
[1:52:50] God hallelujah so that which was perfect
[1:52:53] is the
[1:52:54] word amen and the Word was God the
[1:52:58] word's still God all right when that
[1:52:59] which is perfect is come that which is
[1:53:01] in part is done away with and and so I
[1:53:05] listen I have the opening of the word
[1:53:07] gifts are part of that but I don't have
[1:53:09] to manufacture
[1:53:11] gifts they'll come when God calls them
[1:53:13] to come when God makes them happen I I
[1:53:15] don't have to manufacture gifts to have
[1:53:17] a good I'll tell you this you ought to
[1:53:18] shout more for the opening of the word
[1:53:21] than you do for any gift because a gift
[1:53:23] could be wrong but the word is never
[1:53:28] wrong and the Pentecost is got to where
[1:53:30] they felt like that if somebody didn't
[1:53:32] speak in tongues they didn't have a good
[1:53:33] service and everybody was left
[1:53:36] mad ask me how I
[1:53:38] know right that's not what God has
[1:53:41] called us to we got something that lives
[1:53:44] with us we got something that goes over
[1:53:45] the opening of the word doesn't stop at
[1:53:47] church it goes with us to work it goes
[1:53:49] with us to school it goes with us to our
[1:53:51] homes it goes with us every every day he
[1:53:53] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:53:55] forsake you what is it it's
[1:53:57] Christ sir I don't have to manufacture
[1:54:00] gifts I believe they're there but God
[1:54:02] has G us something else to fight
[1:54:05] with right the Pentecostal age
[1:54:07] represented that again I'm quoting the
[1:54:09] prophet Pentecostal age represented that
[1:54:11] again but God has given us something now
[1:54:12] look as great as the second pole was
[1:54:16] right that was division right
[1:54:18] discernment the third poll brother brand
[1:54:21] said was much greater
[1:54:22] all
[1:54:24] right I
[1:54:25] look I said five minutes I've went over
[1:54:28] by zero minutes so
[1:54:30] far but look when David went out you
[1:54:32] remember when David went out to fight
[1:54:34] Goliath brother Joel told me something
[1:54:36] this morning I hope I'm not getting on
[1:54:37] your sermon tonight but he told me said
[1:54:39] when you go out to fight Goliath what
[1:54:41] was
[1:54:42] that huh leave it alone he
[1:54:46] saids but when you go out to fight
[1:54:48] Goliath someone say if you take a swing
[1:54:50] on the at the king you better not miss
[1:54:52] you
[1:54:53] know right you got to believe that that
[1:54:55] Goliath is is able to to fall right but
[1:54:59] now David went to fight Goliath now why
[1:55:00] was David why did David have to fight
[1:55:03] Goliath because Saul
[1:55:05] couldn't Saul was
[1:55:07] afraid right Saul represents the old
[1:55:10] Administration the
[1:55:12] denomination right Saul is the old Saul
[1:55:15] is what we would say the Pentecostal age
[1:55:16] or the lean age he's sitting there
[1:55:20] trembling right even though he's much
[1:55:23] bigger than David he got much better
[1:55:25] looking
[1:55:26] armor but now watch what Saul does Saul
[1:55:29] says okay David you're now the guy
[1:55:31] you've been anointed you can go fight
[1:55:33] him but put my armor on take the thing
[1:55:38] that I used to fight with you and David
[1:55:42] could have walked out with that armor on
[1:55:43] that old clunky armor and looked pretty
[1:55:46] good to the people but he didn't know
[1:55:48] how to fight with it because it's not
[1:55:51] what he was was given he represented
[1:55:54] something new that had come what was it
[1:55:56] the opening of the word are you with me
[1:55:58] now he had something that Saul didn't
[1:56:00] have you got something that Saul didn't
[1:56:02] have the Pentecostals didn't have that's
[1:56:04] why they had to get Saul out of order
[1:56:05] you got something it wasn't because they
[1:56:06] were bad people it's because they didn't
[1:56:08] know but you and I have an open book
[1:56:11] we've got something to fight with we got
[1:56:13] faith in the word of God so he said all
[1:56:15] I got to have is this sling because I
[1:56:17] know this worked for me before it worked
[1:56:19] for me with the lion it worked for me
[1:56:21] with the bear it worked for me with my
[1:56:22] sick children it worked for me and my
[1:56:24] family it worked and brought me out of
[1:56:26] Darkness it brought me out of leoda and
[1:56:28] I believe it'll work again take it to
[1:56:31] the test church every time in'll work
[1:56:34] it's he's always the same yesterday
[1:56:36] today and forever he does not change
[1:56:38] don't give up now you grab a hold of the
[1:56:40] sword of the word the slingshot God's
[1:56:42] giv you fight with it don't use
[1:56:45] yesterday's armor fight with the word
[1:56:47] this message is our protection
[1:56:56] musicians go ahead and come I'll just
[1:56:58] read this while you come BR said you
[1:57:00] can't manufacture
[1:57:02] salvation you can't manufacture the
[1:57:04] gifts you've got to Bear the gifts
[1:57:07] certainly see the Sheep doesn't he
[1:57:09] doesn't manufacture wool he has wool
[1:57:11] because he's a sheep he just Bears wool
[1:57:15] the cherry tree doesn't manufacture
[1:57:17] cherries it just Bears cherries because
[1:57:19] the life of it that way and the Church
[1:57:21] of the God doesn't inject this to try to
[1:57:24] make themselves look like something
[1:57:26] they're already what they are by the
[1:57:29] grace of God and the word of God is
[1:57:32] joined with them and they're joined with
[1:57:36] the word you realize what's happened in
[1:57:38] this age of marriage between the bride
[1:57:40] and the word and the works that was
[1:57:42] brought forth in that perfect one Jesus
[1:57:44] Christ God manifest in flesh will
[1:57:47] produce itself through every Born Again
[1:57:50] believer he said so nothing else he said
[1:57:55] now that's something
[1:57:57] certain oh Church an hour of great
[1:58:02] uncertainty let's get back to the
[1:58:04] word let's go back to something certain
[1:58:07] an open book which is not just
[1:58:09] intellectual I defy that the teaching
[1:58:11] that the word is only intellectual the
[1:58:12] word is the but Jesus said my words are
[1:58:15] Spirit their
[1:58:17] life word has power to defeat every e
[1:58:20] every demon every evil in your life
[1:58:22] would you bow your heads with me we have
[1:58:25] a certain sound prepare yourself for
[1:58:27] Rapture make yourself ready a voice that
[1:58:30] cried out at
[1:58:31] midnight we don't need to go back to
[1:58:33] Saul's armor let God speak through his
[1:58:38] word getting us ready to leave this
[1:58:42] world if you're not ready this morning
[1:58:44] would you do that today how do I do that
[1:58:47] believe the
[1:58:49] word let the word produce an experience
[1:58:52] erience in your life we believe in the
[1:58:53] Holy Ghost experience we believe in the
[1:58:56] manifestation of worship and the gifts
[1:58:58] and all of those things but we don't
[1:59:00] believe in an uncertain
[1:59:02] sound we believe in a word that set
[1:59:04] things in
[1:59:05] order that lives and he wants to produce
[1:59:08] himself in your
[1:59:11] [Music]
[1:59:13] life I don't want to go
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:17] back to uncertainty
[1:59:22] I don't want to go back to where men
[1:59:23] have control over my
[1:59:26] life I don't want to have control over
[1:59:28] your lives I want to preach the
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:33] word let the chips fall where they may
[1:59:37] preach the word that don't mean there's
[1:59:39] no discipline in the church there has to
[1:59:40] be well we're not a body we're not a
[1:59:42] church we part of our job is to protect
[1:59:44] the church and help that don't mean
[1:59:46] there's no discipline but it just means
[1:59:48] it just means that it's not because it's
[1:59:51] not because because i' feel led or I had
[1:59:53] a vision or I had a dream no because we
[1:59:56] go by the word we go by the word and we
[1:59:59] try
[2:00:00] to we we Empower even the offices that
[2:00:03] we have are empowered by the word to do
[2:00:05] what they do so if a deacon asks you to
[2:00:07] do something you do it not because the
[2:00:10] man's a good man not because he's a
[2:00:11] Gifted Man but because he has an office
[2:00:14] of the word that God put in order the
[2:00:17] same thing with a with a pastor or
[2:00:19] something you should listen to your
[2:00:20] pastor you should listen to other men
[2:00:21] but always take get back to the word
[2:00:24] because he has a word office but he has
[2:00:26] to also speak the word do you love him
[2:00:27] this morning you love the word if you're
[2:00:31] not ready to meet him it's an uncertain
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:36] time every time I go and I begin to pray
[2:00:39] and begin to talk to God say God it so
[2:00:41] much going on it it must be
[2:00:46] close I think about that song say count
[2:00:48] the years as months and the months as
[2:00:51] days and
[2:00:54] thank God it could be any day
[2:00:57] now some of you have been in this way
[2:00:59] for a long time you're Elders to
[2:01:02] me you've seen these things you know
[2:01:04] what I'm talking about I say hold on
[2:01:07] little church hold on little
[2:01:11] bride it won't be
[2:01:14] long you don't have to worry Don't Be
[2:01:18] Afraid trust in the word of God you
[2:01:22] don't have to be under some man tell you
[2:01:24] to do something not to do something you
[2:01:25] just believe
[2:01:27] God and if you've been hurt maybe you've
[2:01:29] been hurt by men you've been hurt by
[2:01:31] situations
[2:01:34] and I've known situations where men took
[2:01:37] their own
[2:01:39] lives CU they had false
[2:01:43] prophecy listen you don't have to listen
[2:01:46] to
[2:01:47] that you don't have to be bound by that
[2:01:49] you come to God you believe God
[2:01:52] God says you can be saved you can be
[2:01:54] saved you believe God no matter where
[2:01:56] you go to church or what you do you

[2:02:01] you do this morning Heavenly Father Lord

[2:02:06] their life to
