[44:43] of the way and speak directly to the
[44:45] people we pray in Jesus name
[44:48] amen amen second Kings chapter 5 and
[44:52] verse 1.
[44:54] Second Kings 5 and 1 about preach me to
[44:57] death this morning so we'll try to get
[44:58] through this tonight
[45:00] and maybe try to close quickly but the
[45:04] Lord knows what we need do you believe
[45:05] that tonight he always knows what we
[45:08] need good to see each and every one of
[45:09] you with us tonight and those that are
[45:12] watching that had to go home I know
[45:13] where the Allen had to leave this
[45:14] morning got sick and so let's be praying
[45:17] for him and his family and each one the
[45:19] devil always fights always fights to
[45:22] keep us out of the house of God why
[45:24] because we have the potential yeah and
[45:27] we're Sons and Daughters of the king and
[45:29] so we learned about that this morning so
[45:31] the devil's going to fight our families
[45:33] going to fight our homes we're going to
[45:34] fight this church gonna fight other
[45:36] churches of Believers but we have the
[45:38] victory we've already won the victory
[45:41] through Christ Our Redeemer he won it
[45:43] for us and so we have to believe that
[45:45] tonight Second Kings 5 and 1 it says now
[45:48] Naaman captain of the host of the king
[45:51] of Syria was a great man with his master
[45:54] and honorable because by him the Lord
[45:57] had given Deliverance unto Syria he was
[46:00] also a mighty man in Valor but he was a
[46:03] leper
[46:05] and the syrians had gone out by
[46:07] companies and brought away captive out
[46:09] of the land of Israel a little maid and
[46:13] she waited on naaman's wife
[46:15] and she said unto her mistress
[46:18] would God my Lord were with the prophet
[46:21] that is in Samaria
[46:23] I love the faith of the little maid
[46:26] for he would recover him of his leprosy
[46:30] I pray the Lord would add his Blessing
[46:32] to the word you may be seated I'd like
[46:34] to speak to you for just a few minutes
[46:36] tonight on a topic of surrounded
[46:42] somewhere in Israel during the days of
[46:45] Elisha there was
[46:47] a little maid
[46:48] and those words little made are
[46:51] significant or they are they they mean a
[46:54] lot because it actually means small
[46:57] young unimportant and the root of it is
[47:01] insignificant
[47:03] we don't know her name she was so small
[47:06] and Unworthy of recognition maybe she
[47:09] was about the age of one of these young
[47:10] ladies sitting here in the front just a
[47:13] little maid
[47:15] and she was taken away from her family
[47:18] I can see her as she was brought away
[47:20] from her family and the people that she
[47:22] loved everything that she knew
[47:24] everything that she was and and they
[47:27] take her away by night and and and the
[47:30] band of syrians that took her can
[47:32] imagine her laying there with her hands
[47:34] bound and her feet bound she's laying by
[47:36] the fire and she's listening to them
[47:39] talk about how they killed her family
[47:41] and how they destroyed because they were
[47:43] a tool in the hands of God to bring
[47:45] judgment on Israel at that time and she
[47:48] laid there by herself and it must have
[47:51] been a lonely place it must have been a
[47:54] place where she felt like that she was
[47:56] completely surrounded by the by the
[47:58] enemy she she had nobody there to help
[48:00] her mom and dad were a long ways away
[48:03] perhaps dead at that time all of her
[48:05] family all the structure all the temple
[48:08] all the things of God that they had in
[48:10] Israel at that time it was all gone and
[48:12] she didn't have nothing she was being
[48:14] carried away a captive carried against
[48:17] her will a captive in Australia Strange
[48:19] Land
[48:20] and I think sometimes all of us feel
[48:22] like that
[48:23] we're surrounded by things beyond our
[48:26] control we're just covered up by
[48:29] problems covered up by circumstances of
[48:32] life and we're listening to the Devils
[48:34] that are surrounding us many times
[48:36] bragged about what they've done to our
[48:38] families and our friends and we feel
[48:40] that way we're surrounded by school
[48:44] surrounded by work surrounded by Family
[48:47] sometimes
[48:49] surrounded by trouble
[48:52] the word in the King James version is
[48:55] compassed
[48:57] compassed about when you see that in the
[48:59] King James it means to be surrounded but
[49:02] it's not just to be surrounded but for
[49:04] the enemy to be going around and around
[49:06] around the perimeter
[49:08] so to be compassed about with armies is
[49:11] when when the enemy would March around
[49:13] like they did at Jericho and go around
[49:15] and around and constantly making their
[49:17] presence known
[49:19] right and I'd just be honest with you
[49:22] sometimes that's the way I feel as a
[49:24] Christian and laodicea today we feel
[49:26] like we're surrounded by enemies
[49:29] right you feel like you're by yourself
[49:31] when you go but the Bobby if you go to
[49:33] work and you and you realize that
[49:35] there's not very many people live like
[49:37] we do
[49:38] not very many people love God the way
[49:40] that we do and they don't understand and
[49:43] then there's some good people out there
[49:45] but but the world for the most part has
[49:47] gone insane
[49:49] can I get an amen on that tonight it's
[49:51] gone completely and totally insane and
[49:54] so our children go to school and we
[49:56] wonder how will they ever make it
[49:57] through school our families we look at
[49:59] if they if we homeschool them but yet
[50:01] you have to get them out in the world to
[50:03] go to work and when they reach a certain
[50:04] age what are you going to do when they
[50:06] reach when they leave your home they
[50:07] turn 18 and you feel like they're out
[50:09] there on their own
[50:11] and there ain't no way to help him there
[50:13] ain't no way and and there's no way to
[50:16] look but they're surrounded by their
[50:18] enemies but sometimes it has to be this
[50:21] way so we can see who God really is
[50:24] so he can reveal himself to us
[50:27] job felt surrounded by his friends
[50:30] that should have come and and helped him
[50:32] should have come and offered a kind word
[50:34] or an encouraging word and they were
[50:36] constantly telling him he'd done
[50:37] something wrong he was a secret sinner
[50:39] in job 16 and 10 he said they have gaped
[50:42] upon me with their mouth they have
[50:44] submit me upon the cheek reproachfully
[50:46] they have gathered themselves together
[50:48] against me
[50:50] it's like being on Facebook
[50:53] they're just gathered they're ganging up
[50:55] on me
[50:56] and they're constantly telling me I must
[50:58] be a secret sinner or I wouldn't be
[51:00] going through this but job knew that
[51:02] there was a sacrifice that he had made
[51:04] listen to me tonight you be sure and
[51:06] know that there's a sacrifice that you
[51:08] have made
[51:09] amen
[51:11] Hallelujah sacrifice has been made for
[51:14] you I'm glad for that tonight
[51:16] and he said they've gathered themselves
[51:17] together against me God hath delivered
[51:19] me to the ungodly
[51:21] turn me over into the hands of the
[51:23] wicked I was at ease but he hath broken
[51:25] me asunder he's also taken me by the
[51:27] neck look at this graphic language he
[51:29] said he's taken me by the neck and
[51:31] shaken me to pieces
[51:33] set me up for his Mark so it's like I
[51:35] was God's Target and God marked off his
[51:37] space and set me at 50 yards and started
[51:39] shooting arrows at me yeah
[51:43] he felt surrounded
[51:45] persecuted he cleaveeth my Reigns
[51:47] asunder does not spare he poureth out my
[51:50] gall upon the ground
[51:52] David Felt This Way many times look at
[51:55] Psalm 22 when he was being hunted by
[51:57] King Saul he prayed and he cried out to
[51:59] God said be not far from me for trouble
[52:02] is near for there is none to help
[52:05] you imagine that little girl feeling
[52:07] that way there is none to hell
[52:09] many bulls have compassed me strong bull
[52:13] salvation have beset me around they
[52:15] gaped upon me with their mouths as a
[52:17] ravening and a roaring lion he said I'm
[52:19] poured out like water all my bones are
[52:22] out of joint my heart is like waxing is
[52:24] melted in the midst of my bowels my
[52:26] strength is dried up like a puncture oh
[52:28] can you enter in with him and realize
[52:30] the situation he was in he didn't even
[52:32] know he was speaking of the future of
[52:34] him
[52:35] amen he said my tongue cleaveeth to my
[52:38] jaws I was brought me to the dust of
[52:41] death for dogs have come past me the
[52:44] Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me
[52:46] they pierced my hands and my feet I may
[52:50] tell all my bones they look and stare
[52:53] upon me they part my garments among them
[52:55] cast lost upon my vesture he said but be
[52:58] thou not far from me O Lord O my
[53:01] strength Hast thee to help me
[53:04] completely surrounded by enemies
[53:07] don't you know that's how Jesus felt on
[53:09] the cross
[53:11] let's just picture that for a moment I
[53:13] know this is simple tonight but it ought
[53:15] to bring something to us and make us
[53:17] realize where we're at and and how we
[53:19] should feel about what he did for us
[53:21] he was completely surrounded by enemies
[53:25] his friends all left him
[53:27] they left him there to die alone
[53:32] brother Brandon put it this way he said
[53:33] Yonder on the hill when they laid him
[53:36] down pulled his precious hands back
[53:37] those hands that stood to fever he said
[53:41] that hands that said to the poor widows
[53:42] woman's boy when it touched his brow the
[53:45] casket he was laying and he came to life
[53:47] those same hands
[53:49] you think well I should be rewarded for
[53:51] doing good look what he got
[53:53] for laying his hands on the sick they
[53:55] pierced his hands
[53:58] Oh my he said that same those same hands
[54:01] that said to the poor widow woman's boy
[54:02] would touch the casket he was laying and
[54:04] he come to life that one who called
[54:06] Dorcas back to life
[54:08] that one who called jairus's daughter to
[54:11] life that one who said Lazarus come
[54:13] forth
[54:14] them lips are bleeding now
[54:17] parching crying
[54:20] as the great cruel Nails driving to his
[54:22] hands in his feet they pierced my hands
[54:25] and my feet said the prophet 700 years
[54:27] before it happened what was it it was
[54:29] Abel's lamb
[54:31] said they flung him down in the ground
[54:32] in the flesh tore his poor body quivered
[54:35] and said I thirst they give him vinegar
[54:39] they riled and mocked and made fun of
[54:41] him and said you great miracle worker do
[54:43] something about it now but then the
[54:45] Skies begin to get dark lightning began
[54:47] to flash God was hiding his face
[54:51] and that's sometimes when we feel most
[54:52] surrounded by our enemies is when it
[54:55] seems like God
[54:57] pulled away from us
[54:59] and his absence is felt
[55:02] but I want you to know tonight that he
[55:04] give you a promise that you would never
[55:06] be left alone
[55:08] he said I'll be with you always
[55:11] I'll be with you always he was left
[55:13] alone so we wouldn't have to be
[55:16] yeah amen and when you get all by
[55:18] yourself and you feel like nobody can
[55:20] feel your pain nobody knows what you're
[55:22] going through it's at that moment that
[55:24] you know he's been there he knows what
[55:27] you're going through he's a great high
[55:29] priest that can be touched by the
[55:31] feeling of your infirmity yes
[55:34] amen
[55:36] they riled and mocked and made fun of
[55:38] him said you great miracle worker do
[55:40] something about it now
[55:42] the Skies begin to get dark lightning
[55:44] begin to flash God was hiding his face
[55:46] he couldn't stand it no more oh God how
[55:49] cruel sin must be
[55:51] he said how cruel how cruel that caused
[55:54] that precious one to do that even such a
[55:56] price he paid until God himself hid his
[55:59] face
[56:00] the Angels failed their faces and turned
[56:03] around oh God to weeping with him
[56:08] they were there but they couldn't do
[56:10] anything about it
[56:12] and so they turned around they couldn't
[56:14] take it they turned their faces from him
[56:17] God turned his face from him
[56:20] oh I know we've all suffered but we've
[56:22] never suffered like that
[56:24] Oh my he said even such a price he paid
[56:27] till God himself hit his face the Angels
[56:31] veiled their faces and turned around the
[56:32] moon and the stars could not go any
[56:34] farther they could not shine no more the
[56:36] very God that created them was dying on
[56:38] the cross and he bowed his head
[56:40] before he did that he looked down there
[56:42] to them people gambling for His Garment
[56:45] to fulfill what the prophet said father
[56:48] forgive them
[56:51] they don't know what they're doing
[56:55] I hope we haven't gotten so cold that it
[56:58] doesn't mean anything to us anymore
[57:01] the love of Jesus
[57:04] talk about it in church but it becomes
[57:06] so common until we can sit and it don't
[57:09] mean anything anymore
[57:11] but he said now father forgive him they
[57:14] don't know what's All for Love like that
[57:16] I want to be that kind of a that kind of
[57:18] a character I want the spirit of Christ
[57:20] to express himself in me until I can be
[57:22] reviled and reviled not again father
[57:25] they don't know what they're doing
[57:27] all in love Adam slam God's provided
[57:29] Lamb slain from the foundation of the
[57:32] world there he died friendless
[57:34] completely surrounded by his enemies
[57:37] friendless even forsaken by God himself
[57:40] God he said and then his own father
[57:42] Forsaken and bleeding
[57:44] yeah we go around laughing again he's
[57:46] just like nothing had happened
[57:48] he said oh God it was that blood
[57:51] when was the last time you thought about
[57:52] this church it was that blood when
[57:55] Yonder in the hospital the doctor said
[57:57] he's dying it was that blood that healed
[58:00] me
[58:01] a little old sitter boy running around
[58:03] here it was that blood that forgive my
[58:05] sins right
[58:07] oh aren't you glad for that blood
[58:09] tonight it's that blood that heals me
[58:11] today it's that blood That Forgives me
[58:13] it's that blood that lets me stand here
[58:15] today and preach to you that blood that
[58:18] did it
[58:19] oh my it was that blessed taking me out
[58:22] of a debatable place that I was living
[58:24] and sent me and made your son oh poor
[58:27] dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood Keep
[58:29] Me Near The Cross Lord he said that's my
[58:32] vision that's what it is Yonder love
[58:35] all God's Great heart moving down there
[58:38] and all that comes by him will not be
[58:40] rejected they'll all receive everlasting
[58:42] life he that cometh to me he said I will
[58:44] in no wise cast out
[58:47] well the Branham says those things at
[58:49] the end of a sermon called the cruelty
[58:50] of sin and the penalty that it cost to
[58:54] rid Sin from our lives what an amazing
[58:57] title
[58:58] surrounded by his enemies
[59:00] he said father
[59:02] forgive them
[59:04] I want you to notice the attitude of the
[59:06] little maid
[59:09] she said to her mistress
[59:11] would God my Lord were with the prophet
[59:14] that is in Samaria
[59:16] he would recover him of his leprosy
[59:20] we don't know what happened to the girl
[59:22] in between we don't know how she was
[59:23] treated but somehow she had such a
[59:26] character
[59:28] and there's a reason for that our kids
[59:30] that don't just automatically happen
[59:32] but kids that are raised in the right
[59:34] atmosphere
[59:35] the kids that are have parents that care
[59:38] about them that provide a nice home a
[59:40] happy home as the prophet said kids that
[59:42] that have parents that care about them
[59:44] they tend to they tend to go to this
[59:46] place and when they're in struggles and
[59:49] they may be in trials they may be
[59:50] carried away even by Satan but there
[59:52] will be a testimony there as we said
[59:54] before there'll be some place they can
[59:56] go back to
[59:57] a home that they can go back to amen
[1:00:00] well that's what we want to provide for
[1:00:02] our children
[1:00:03] but the random put it this way he said
[1:00:05] they had a little girl there he said I
[1:00:07] want to show you the force of a
[1:00:09] testimony of a child who lived in a
[1:00:12] nation or perhaps a family who was under
[1:00:15] the influence of God you realize
[1:00:18] children your your testimony has Force
[1:00:23] your testimony has Force here was the
[1:00:26] little child one of you children one of
[1:00:29] you young people I should say wrote
[1:00:32] notes had notes I don't know big notes I
[1:00:34] got it there in my office we found it
[1:00:35] somewhere outside one of you made notes
[1:00:37] you made good notes by the way about the
[1:00:39] sermon that preached Wednesday night we
[1:00:41] were going over those notes and thinking
[1:00:43] about that what a testimony that is that
[1:00:45] a child even can understand some of that
[1:00:47] stuff was pretty deep it was pretty
[1:00:49] pretty much dig down deep in the message
[1:00:51] but you were understanding it writing it
[1:00:53] down and I thought my goodness we would
[1:00:55] think that these kids wouldn't even
[1:00:57] understand it but there's a force of a
[1:00:59] testimony of a child who lived in a
[1:01:01] nation and perhaps a family who was
[1:01:03] under the influence of God
[1:01:06] horse we just could repeat it over and
[1:01:09] over again but as we said we want to
[1:01:10] keep them hide them in the house of the
[1:01:12] Lord
[1:01:13] hide them in your family make sure you
[1:01:16] keep them in the in the presence of God
[1:01:19] she loved her master and her mistress
[1:01:23] they took her away
[1:01:25] they destroyed everything she knew she
[1:01:28] could have hated them
[1:01:31] she should have hated them
[1:01:34] and look how Christ shines through that
[1:01:36] little child even before Christ was ever
[1:01:38] here but we see Christ in every verse of
[1:01:40] the Bible
[1:01:41] here's a little child who's taken
[1:01:43] captive by her parents and she's all
[1:01:45] alone can you imagine being all alone
[1:01:47] family by yourself in a place where
[1:01:49] there's there's no help and there's
[1:01:50] nobody there and yet you learn to love
[1:01:52] instead of hate
[1:01:54] you you learn to you learn to care for
[1:01:57] the people that you were taking and it
[1:01:59] seems phenomenal that it could be but
[1:02:01] she was raised right
[1:02:03] she was under the influence of the
[1:02:05] supernatural
[1:02:06] we'll find that in just a moment he said
[1:02:08] now she loved her master and her
[1:02:10] mistress so when she seen Naaman
[1:02:12] probably a good-hearted good-natured man
[1:02:14] he said as far as we know according to
[1:02:16] history Elijah never healed a man with
[1:02:18] Leprosy there's never been a leper case
[1:02:20] healed in his day but the little girl
[1:02:22] being raised and brought up under the
[1:02:24] influence over in Israel yet an alien
[1:02:28] she was conducting herself as a believer
[1:02:31] oh my oh I want to raise children like
[1:02:34] that I want to see young ones come up
[1:02:36] like that they may be surrounded but
[1:02:38] they're under the influence not just
[1:02:40] children but but church members people
[1:02:42] that if you say well I go to Word of
[1:02:44] Life Tabernacle I go to some other
[1:02:46] church but but it could be a
[1:02:48] representation not of that church but of
[1:02:50] the of the actions of Christ that if I
[1:02:52] find myself surrounded by enemies I'll
[1:02:55] still Reach Out In Love I'll still say
[1:02:57] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:02:58] they're doing
[1:03:00] amen he had an alien she was conducting
[1:03:03] herself as a believer
[1:03:05] he said and that's the way we should do
[1:03:06] all the time is conduct ourselves no
[1:03:09] matter what our position is conduct
[1:03:11] ourselves as Believers ready at all
[1:03:14] times to give an answer for the hope
[1:03:16] that lieth within your brother random
[1:03:18] talks about the slave
[1:03:20] was taken and he was the son of a king
[1:03:23] but they didn't know it but they began
[1:03:25] to watch him and he said when the slave
[1:03:27] trader come by I begin to watch him he
[1:03:29] said I want to buy that one he said he's
[1:03:30] not for sale he said well what makes him
[1:03:32] so different does he eat differently do
[1:03:34] you treat him differently he said no he
[1:03:36] said it's just that I found out that
[1:03:38] over in Africa he was the son of a king
[1:03:40] and so he still holds his head high he
[1:03:43] still conducts himself though he's a
[1:03:44] slave he conducts himself as the son of
[1:03:46] the king or how that ought to be you and
[1:03:48] I tonight though we're in laodicea now
[1:03:51] we're in many ways we're surrounded by
[1:03:53] enemies yet we ought to feel like Sons
[1:03:55] and Daughters of the king we ought to
[1:03:57] conduct ourselves as believers
[1:04:00] brother random said how much that ought
[1:04:02] to be to the Christian church this
[1:04:03] morning what a challenge
[1:04:05] what a challenge can you say Amen to
[1:04:07] that on a three o'clock service in the
[1:04:09] afternoon what a challenge
[1:04:11] hey man what a challenge no matter what
[1:04:13] other men do and what those who profess
[1:04:15] Christianity does we must walk as Sons
[1:04:18] and Daughters of the king
[1:04:19] our morale should be wonderful
[1:04:25] amen oh that ought to I told him I
[1:04:29] wasn't going to preach at you tonight
[1:04:31] somebody told me he said give us a
[1:04:33] little bit of balm for all them wounds
[1:04:36] foreign
[1:04:37] but we got to walk your sons and
[1:04:39] daughters of the king our morale should
[1:04:41] be wonderful
[1:04:42] oh we're not we're not in the gloom and
[1:04:44] doom the Risen sign has dispelled the
[1:04:47] Gloom
[1:04:48] our morale should be wonderful we should
[1:04:51] never act as the world or live with the
[1:04:54] world we should keep our courage High
[1:04:56] knowing this that we are aliens we don't
[1:04:58] care about the world and what they think
[1:05:00] we are aliens pilgrims and strangers but
[1:05:03] someday brother JP we're going home do
[1:05:06] you believe that tonight someday we're
[1:05:07] going home
[1:05:09] amen he said we're at this time we're
[1:05:12] pilgrims this little lady was that type
[1:05:15] she said to her mistress she said I
[1:05:17] would God that my Lord name it was over
[1:05:19] in my country for we have a prophet over
[1:05:21] there that could heal him of his leprosy
[1:05:23] he said oh my how God used that child
[1:05:26] how did she know he said the same thing
[1:05:29] I was talking on last night inspiration
[1:05:31] from the very atmosphere
[1:05:34] oh my she was under such an atmosphere
[1:05:37] under the influence of such an
[1:05:38] atmosphere of the supernatural at home
[1:05:41] her parents must have believed in
[1:05:43] miracles
[1:05:44] they went to a church are you hearing me
[1:05:46] today that believed in miracles people
[1:05:49] that believed in the moving of the
[1:05:51] spirit of God
[1:05:52] and because amen her parents believed in
[1:05:55] Miracles and her church believed in
[1:05:57] Miracles when she was taken out of by
[1:06:00] captivity into another land she still
[1:06:02] was influenced by that
[1:06:05] under the influence of that atmosphere
[1:06:07] she received inspiration
[1:06:10] and when she received inspiration she
[1:06:12] spoke the word of God
[1:06:15] huh now there might be some things in
[1:06:18] your life that you never run across in
[1:06:20] the scripture might be some disease or
[1:06:22] or some trial or something they didn't
[1:06:23] have to deal with certain things that we
[1:06:25] deal with today and so there's things
[1:06:26] that you maybe you don't see a direct
[1:06:28] analogy to that in scripture but if
[1:06:30] you're under the influence of the right
[1:06:33] atmosphere and the inspiration of God
[1:06:36] you can actually speak the right things
[1:06:39] oh my I know I'm Healed because he said
[1:06:43] I'm the god that heals all your diseases
[1:06:44] no matter what they name
[1:06:47] I know I'm saved I know they may not
[1:06:50] have to deal with the internet but I
[1:06:51] know I'm an overcomer of of all of these
[1:06:54] things
[1:06:55] are you with me tonight because I'm
[1:06:56] under inspiration from that atmosphere
[1:07:00] he said now notice that child under
[1:07:02] inspiration was led to say those words
[1:07:04] we don't know if Elijah ever healing
[1:07:07] anyone else and maybe no one else no
[1:07:10] matter how many he prayed for
[1:07:12] oh God she said I would to God my Lord
[1:07:15] was over with my country my country we
[1:07:17] have a prophet yeah now watching this uh
[1:07:19] Elijah there never been a leper that we
[1:07:22] know of in the Old Testament healed
[1:07:24] until Naaman
[1:07:25] and he wasn't even
[1:07:28] a Christian as we would say today
[1:07:30] he was but she said my God
[1:07:34] oh my he's so powerful
[1:07:37] that if I'm at work and somebody asks
[1:07:39] for prayer I still believe God's A
[1:07:42] Healer if I'm at school and somebody
[1:07:44] asks for prayer I still believe that
[1:07:46] God's A Healer why because I'm under the
[1:07:49] atmosphere of the influence and the
[1:07:51] inspiration of God sir amen he said
[1:07:55] notice that child was under that
[1:07:57] atmosphere and so he said and led to say
[1:08:01] those words he said oh if we could say
[1:08:03] that now watch she said I would to God
[1:08:06] that my Lord was over with my country in
[1:08:08] my country we have a prophet he said oh
[1:08:09] if we could say that about our churches
[1:08:12] today
[1:08:15] I'm preaching the Word of Life
[1:08:16] Tabernacle now oh that we could say that
[1:08:19] about our churches today I want God that
[1:08:22] you could come under the influence that
[1:08:24] I live under and my church lives under
[1:08:26] for we believe that God Is A Healer do
[1:08:29] you believe that today we believe God is
[1:08:31] the savior we believe that God gives the
[1:08:33] Holy Spirit and I would God you lived in
[1:08:35] my country because we have a church
[1:08:37] where they still lay on hands we have a
[1:08:39] church where they still believe in
[1:08:40] healing we have a people I believe the
[1:08:42] message people ought to be that way I
[1:08:44] know there's a God in our midst there
[1:08:46] may be problems but there's a God who
[1:08:48] solves those problems I want God you
[1:08:51] lived in my country
[1:08:52] now she didn't go back and say well you
[1:08:55] know the preachers are not very because
[1:08:56] that's not what she heard yeah
[1:08:58] yeah that's not the atmosphere she was
[1:09:00] under
[1:09:01] gossip and a bunch of
[1:09:03] you with me now talking down about
[1:09:05] people all the time that's not the
[1:09:07] atmosphere she was under
[1:09:08] she was under an atmosphere that could
[1:09:10] bring inspiration
[1:09:11] she said my church is the best Church
[1:09:14] uh we have a prophet how do you believe
[1:09:16] that today you can talk bad about the
[1:09:18] message all you want to but I would God
[1:09:20] you were in my country I look out at the
[1:09:22] world surrounding us I look out with the
[1:09:24] people without hope and I look at them
[1:09:26] and some of them don't know if they're a
[1:09:27] boy or a girl or a man or woman or a cow
[1:09:29] or a pig or whatever it is that they are
[1:09:31] when they don't even know what side of
[1:09:32] the fence they belong what God you were
[1:09:34] in my country because we had a Prophet
[1:09:37] come in our day to set those things
[1:09:39] right just shine light on the word of
[1:09:41] God show us where we live at
[1:09:44] hey man
[1:09:48] I'm about to kill myself I haven't
[1:09:50] preached this sermon in 20 years
[1:09:57] as fresh and I had 20 years ago
[1:10:01] I believe he's still God today
[1:10:06] oh God
[1:10:08] that I would to God you could come under
[1:10:10] this influence I live under
[1:10:12] and my church lives under
[1:10:14] for we believe God Is A Healer we
[1:10:15] believe that God is a savior we believe
[1:10:17] that God gives the Holy Spirit I went to
[1:10:19] God you lived in my country
[1:10:21] we can condemn people and look down on
[1:10:23] people but we're the god you lived in my
[1:10:25] country just come to church
[1:10:27] come under that atmosphere
[1:10:29] things will change if you sit under it
[1:10:31] long enough that there's a seed of God
[1:10:32] there things will change
[1:10:36] she had that testimony in those
[1:10:37] circumstances now look now look at me
[1:10:40] church we are not surrounded by enemies
[1:10:42] we may think we are
[1:10:45] but we are not actually surrounded by
[1:10:48] enemies
[1:10:50] now there was prophet Elisha as he was
[1:10:53] the one that Naaman received healing by
[1:10:56] going and dipping seven times then in
[1:10:58] the muddy Jordan but that same Prophet
[1:11:00] was there one day and and the Syrian
[1:11:03] King was wondering why are we always
[1:11:06] having problems why why is it that uh we
[1:11:10] can't ever have a real victory in Israel
[1:11:12] and the reason was because Elisha was in
[1:11:14] the land and Elisha was was taking the
[1:11:18] words that were spoken in the king's bed
[1:11:19] chamber and going over and telling them
[1:11:22] to the king of Israel
[1:11:24] and so he had a problem he had a spy
[1:11:26] that wasn't even in the country
[1:11:28] so they actually marched down you think
[1:11:31] when the enemies against you why is he
[1:11:33] against you because you're doing
[1:11:34] something right yeah
[1:11:36] so the enemy come against the prophet
[1:11:38] Elisha and they marched down and
[1:11:40] surrounded the city that he was in
[1:11:41] listen the way to protecting Kings puts
[1:11:43] it and he said go Inspire where he is
[1:11:45] that I may sin and fetch him he was told
[1:11:47] him saying behold he is in Dothan he
[1:11:49] said therefore said he they're their
[1:11:51] horses and chariots and a great host and
[1:11:54] they came by night and come past the
[1:11:56] city about for one man
[1:11:58] surrounded it
[1:12:00] and when the servant of the man of God
[1:12:02] was risen early
[1:12:04] gone forth Behold a host come past the
[1:12:06] city both with horses and chariots and
[1:12:08] his servants said unto him alas my
[1:12:10] master
[1:12:12] how shall we do
[1:12:14] huh that's the Doom and Gloom of a
[1:12:17] person that doesn't hasn't pierced the
[1:12:19] Veil
[1:12:21] are you with me now
[1:12:23] he can't see there's more with us than
[1:12:26] be with him we all get that way
[1:12:27] sometimes by the way because we live in
[1:12:29] the flesh which is the Veil we all get
[1:12:32] that way but here the servant will stand
[1:12:34] there and saying what are we going to do
[1:12:36] oh preachers are fighting with one
[1:12:38] another churches or splitting people are
[1:12:40] leaving the message what are we going to
[1:12:42] do
[1:12:43] people are having problems what are we
[1:12:45] going to do people got sin in their
[1:12:47] lives what are we going to do they're
[1:12:49] it's all around us
[1:12:51] oh we just pull back and sit down and
[1:12:53] wait for the end to come
[1:12:54] run off in a cave somewhere like Elijah
[1:12:57] did and God told him he said there's
[1:12:58] more than what you think there is
[1:13:02] but Elisha had a revelation
[1:13:05] oh my that the servant didn't have
[1:13:08] he said what are we going to do and he
[1:13:10] answered fear not
[1:13:11] for they that be with us are more than
[1:13:13] they that be with them
[1:13:16] and Elisha prayed said Lord I pray thee
[1:13:20] open his eyes
[1:13:22] open his eyes said he may see or if
[1:13:25] you're surrounded by trouble today if
[1:13:27] you're surrounded by enemies he was
[1:13:29] surrounded so you wouldn't have to feel
[1:13:31] that way you wouldn't have to feel like
[1:13:33] there's no hope you wouldn't have to
[1:13:35] feel like there's no way to have peace
[1:13:36] no way to have comfort no way for that
[1:13:38] cloud of depression to leave your life
[1:13:40] you wouldn't have to feel that way he
[1:13:42] would surrounded
[1:13:43] by enemies
[1:13:45] and and so we would not have to be look
[1:13:48] he said fear not they're more with us
[1:13:50] than be with him well I should pray Lord
[1:13:52] I open his eyes he may see and the Lord
[1:13:53] Open the Eyes of the young man and he
[1:13:55] saw and behold the chair the mountain
[1:13:58] was full
[1:14:00] yeah
[1:14:01] I don't know how many
[1:14:04] that the king of Syria brought but it
[1:14:05] wasn't enough
[1:14:08] amen whatever the amount was
[1:14:13] Elisha knew that God wouldn't sin the
[1:14:16] smaller Army oh I hope you hear me today
[1:14:18] he says hello to see you it's a bad
[1:14:21] place it's a bad condition yes it is but
[1:14:23] God will not have
[1:14:25] a smaller Army of angels with us
[1:14:29] amen then there are demons against us
[1:14:33] listen to me there was 200 million
[1:14:36] demons released from the Euphrates River
[1:14:39] 200 Millions released on the bride in an
[1:14:42] epic communical mood to try to come
[1:14:44] against the bride but whatever their
[1:14:46] number is it is not enough
[1:14:50] hallelujah oh that ought to be shouting
[1:14:52] ground tonight it is not enough
[1:14:55] oh god there are more with us than be
[1:14:58] with them remember it's always true
[1:14:59] Elisha didn't have to go out and count
[1:15:01] them he didn't have to go out and say
[1:15:03] one two three four five hundred thousand
[1:15:05] a million he didn't have to do that what
[1:15:07] was he doing he knew that God would be
[1:15:09] would provide a sufficient Army
[1:15:12] Glory
[1:15:14] more than enough
[1:15:16] oh God
[1:15:18] age of the Lord
[1:15:20] now watch
[1:15:21] the Lord opened his eyes the mountain
[1:15:23] was full of horses
[1:15:25] Chariots of Fire around about Elisha
[1:15:29] oh my watch the servant saw syrians
[1:15:32] Elisha saw angels
[1:15:35] now in Psalm 34 7 the Bible tells us
[1:15:37] that the angel of the Lord in campus
[1:15:41] in campus
[1:15:43] now we know the angel of the Lord is
[1:15:45] Christ
[1:15:46] that's in the Old Testament Angel of the
[1:15:48] Lord is Christ but now there's angels in
[1:15:50] camping because he brings his armies
[1:15:52] with him to encamp and brother Brown
[1:15:55] said that don't mean go back and forth
[1:15:57] right like the in the encompassing
[1:15:59] people that can pass around the city but
[1:16:02] they're encamped
[1:16:03] that means therefore our defense
[1:16:06] right and it says the angel of the Lord
[1:16:08] in campus round about them that fear Him
[1:16:11] and delivereth them
[1:16:15] now brother Brandon said when God opened
[1:16:17] his spiritual sight all around there he
[1:16:19] said the prophet stood Chariots of Fire
[1:16:21] and angels of fire he said why the
[1:16:23] Chariots of Fire outnumbered that Syrian
[1:16:25] Army by the thousands
[1:16:29] now think about it God had more than
[1:16:31] enough
[1:16:33] amen when we needed Grace he said Grace
[1:16:36] abounded
[1:16:37] if you go back and look at the original
[1:16:38] Super abounded
[1:16:40] when when it bounded more the Bible says
[1:16:43] about and more When sin abounded Grace
[1:16:45] Super abounded
[1:16:47] oh my when the when the when the demons
[1:16:50] come from the Euphrates River God sends
[1:16:52] an army of Chariots of Fire
[1:16:55] the Bible said the angels of God he said
[1:16:58] in Camp about those who fear Him He said
[1:17:00] just the same tonight yes I wonder if we
[1:17:04] can believe it tonight yeah
[1:17:06] yeah he said I wonder what would happen
[1:17:07] if a man here tonight had the power to
[1:17:09] strike across your eyes
[1:17:12] and say look
[1:17:13] standing around this Tabernacle tonight
[1:17:16] you don't know what you're doing when
[1:17:18] you come to church
[1:17:20] oh God you don't realize you're bringing
[1:17:23] my angels and his angels and your angels
[1:17:25] and they're all gathering in one place
[1:17:28] because I got them in camping around me
[1:17:30] he's got them and camping around him
[1:17:31] they're in one place
[1:17:34] oh god oh you thought it was just
[1:17:36] another church service no it's a
[1:17:38] Convention of angels
[1:17:41] there might be 50 people in the church
[1:17:43] service 30 people in the church it
[1:17:45] doesn't matter there's a Convention of
[1:17:46] angels because around each one of those
[1:17:48] servants there's hundreds maybe
[1:17:50] thousands of angels
[1:17:56] he said I wonder what would happen if
[1:17:58] you could see them standing around the
[1:18:00] Tabernacle tonight he said you would be
[1:18:02] a member here the rest of your life
[1:18:05] oh God
[1:18:07] you just think that
[1:18:09] look to your own church or to our church
[1:18:12] I want to believe that
[1:18:15] be real hard to miss a service if you
[1:18:17] knew there was an angel convention going
[1:18:18] on
[1:18:23] Angels sitting all out in the foyer
[1:18:26] we're not exciting to have that meeting
[1:18:28] everybody's people sitting out in the
[1:18:29] foyer man that made my heart feel good
[1:18:31] I wish I I want that to be every service
[1:18:33] or just save people out off the street
[1:18:36] and bring them in let that be every
[1:18:37] service but I'll tell you what there's
[1:18:39] more than them
[1:18:41] right now
[1:18:43] there's more than the seats or fall
[1:18:46] the building is full and you say well
[1:18:47] the devil's here yes he is but the
[1:18:49] angels of God are here
[1:18:51] and they position themselves between the
[1:18:54] devil and thus
[1:18:57] between the devil and his you know
[1:19:01] and God's people he positions he encamps
[1:19:04] angels
[1:19:06] oh my
[1:19:08] he said sometimes you can't see it with
[1:19:09] your natural eyes
[1:19:11] you can feel the impulse of it
[1:19:14] something near a sixth sense that
[1:19:18] denotes something is near
[1:19:22] brother Brandon talked about going to
[1:19:24] certain places he said I hope I'm not
[1:19:25] superstitious if I am I don't know it he
[1:19:27] said but then when you go into these
[1:19:29] places where they have amusements and
[1:19:30] gambling and dances it just looks to me
[1:19:33] like they're just little Devils sitting
[1:19:35] around everywhere
[1:19:36] he said they're just kind of a
[1:19:38] habitation for them they just stay there
[1:19:40] and then you got to go in he said take
[1:19:43] about five nights to preach them all out
[1:19:45] he said you know before you can get the
[1:19:46] meeting started but in the church house
[1:19:50] amen oh that's where we're at tonight in
[1:19:53] the church house I believe the angels of
[1:19:55] God and Camp around because of saints
[1:19:58] gathered there it's a noted place for
[1:20:01] God all people may not like it today
[1:20:03] they may not want to come to church
[1:20:04] people may say well we don't need it no
[1:20:06] more we'll just sit at home and play a
[1:20:08] tape or stream some other service but in
[1:20:10] the church house he said there's angels
[1:20:12] and camping around because Saints
[1:20:14] Gathering there it's a noted place for
[1:20:16] God where he comes and meets with his
[1:20:18] people
[1:20:20] who am I
[1:20:22] said but brother Ben I can't see them
[1:20:25] there's a reason for that
[1:20:29] look at Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 17.
[1:20:31] we'll take this and then we'll close
[1:20:35] it says we're in God willing more
[1:20:36] abundantly
[1:20:38] to show unto The Heirs of promised
[1:20:40] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[1:20:43] by an oath
[1:20:44] that by two immutable things in which it
[1:20:46] was impossible for God to lie I love
[1:20:49] that impossible
[1:20:51] we might have a strong consolation
[1:20:54] who have fled for Refuge to lay hold
[1:20:57] upon the Hope set before us
[1:21:00] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:21:03] Soul well he's not talking about the
[1:21:05] kind of hope that only say well I hope I
[1:21:08] get healed that's not the kind of hope
[1:21:09] he's talking about that kind of hope is
[1:21:10] the enemy of Faith but this is
[1:21:12] expectation
[1:21:14] so we have this expectation as an anchor
[1:21:17] of the Soul
[1:21:19] when you feel it when you don't feel it
[1:21:21] the Anchor's still there right we have
[1:21:23] this hope as an anchor of the Soul both
[1:21:26] sure and steadfast which inrth now watch
[1:21:29] into that within the Veil
[1:21:33] it entereth into that within the veil in
[1:21:36] the veil he said the but the brown said
[1:21:37] and he's talking about this in the
[1:21:39] Hebrew series he said the veil is the
[1:21:41] flesh
[1:21:42] the veil is what keeps us from seeing
[1:21:44] God face to face in this church
[1:21:51] oh I'm not just saying these things
[1:21:53] these things are true
[1:21:55] now think about the veil our flesh
[1:21:59] can you imagine you know somebody ever
[1:22:01] sees an angel I don't doubt that they do
[1:22:02] many people sometimes I have a dream or
[1:22:04] a vision or see an angel but if they
[1:22:06] ever did you heard about it
[1:22:08] most of the time people will tell that
[1:22:10] story
[1:22:12] yeah I I saw an angel
[1:22:16] oh God because when they see it they
[1:22:18] believe it
[1:22:20] but now we can't we don't see Angels
[1:22:22] today why don't we see them because
[1:22:23] there's a veil there
[1:22:25] called the flesh we don't see him he
[1:22:28] said but it's the only thing that keeps
[1:22:30] us from seeing God face to face in his
[1:22:32] church it's just as real as if we could
[1:22:34] see him
[1:22:36] right now watch can you imagine if you
[1:22:39] went home today and you went and told
[1:22:41] your neighbors and told everybody put it
[1:22:42] on Facebook the angels of God were
[1:22:45] camped around us tonight
[1:22:47] we had a service where there was Angels
[1:22:49] Chariots of Fire well they were around
[1:22:51] this side they were camping you realize
[1:22:53] what they are they're around every part
[1:22:55] every person in the church
[1:22:57] now watch he he said here they were all
[1:23:00] around the church and you go home and
[1:23:01] you'd write about it you'd call your
[1:23:03] neighbors you'd say you know what there
[1:23:05] were Angels everywhere
[1:23:07] an angel convention all over the place
[1:23:09] and we shouted and we spoke with tongues
[1:23:12] and we cried and we well we'd have
[1:23:13] church wouldn't we yeah
[1:23:15] they're here
[1:23:23] maybe I should have preached this before
[1:23:24] you got so tired
[1:23:27] they're here yeah
[1:23:30] brother Brown said the Veil is what
[1:23:33] keeps us from seeing the Angels at their
[1:23:37] positions this morning
[1:23:39] standing by
[1:23:41] feet yes
[1:23:46] brother Branham when he was in that
[1:23:48] debate
[1:23:49] with the Baptist man he actually didn't
[1:23:51] he attended the debate he wasn't the one
[1:23:53] debating he was debating with Dr
[1:23:55] debating with Dr Bosworth was when the
[1:23:57] picture of the pillar of fire was taken
[1:23:59] over his head
[1:24:00] he's in that debate and he's standing
[1:24:02] there or he's sitting there in the back
[1:24:04] and they call him up to come pray and
[1:24:06] that's when the angel a picture of the
[1:24:08] Angel of the Lord is taken of the pillar
[1:24:10] of fire and at that time brother Brown
[1:24:12] tells the story he said there's hundreds
[1:24:14] of ushers lying the aisles
[1:24:18] but Rebecca Branham was there
[1:24:21] went to church that night with her dad
[1:24:23] and she said we didn't see no ushers
[1:24:30] he looked like he was walking down the
[1:24:32] aisle by himself
[1:24:35] and a prophet of God I I'm just crazy
[1:24:37] enough to believe there was angels
[1:24:40] and he let the pillar of fire be shown
[1:24:42] and taken a picture of it but he was
[1:24:44] always with him
[1:24:45] he wasn't just with him when they took a
[1:24:47] picture of it brother said he's standing
[1:24:49] here right now not three feet from where
[1:24:51] I'm at right now don't you realize he
[1:24:54] did not just promise that for prophets
[1:24:55] but he said if you could look Beyond the
[1:24:57] Veil of Flesh you'd see Angels standing
[1:24:59] here an angel standing here an angel
[1:25:02] standing over here what is it the angels
[1:25:04] of the Lord didn't come and Camp around
[1:25:06] those that fear God
[1:25:09] that's right
[1:25:12] I wish I could impress on you that's so
[1:25:14] real
[1:25:15] what keeps you from seeing them
[1:25:18] what keeps you from being in the
[1:25:19] presence of the Lord when you go to
[1:25:20] church
[1:25:21] the veil that's right
[1:25:24] the Veil
[1:25:26] the flesh
[1:25:28] oh my
[1:25:30] he said we are hid behind the veil and
[1:25:32] that Veil is the flesh we are Sons and
[1:25:35] Daughters of God we're in the presence
[1:25:37] of God the angels of God are encamped
[1:25:39] about those who fear Him we're in the
[1:25:42] presence of God
[1:25:44] hey all the time
[1:25:47] you mean when I'm at home yes when I'm
[1:25:49] at church yes when I'm just at church
[1:25:51] there's a whole bunch of them together
[1:25:52] but when you're at home you still have
[1:25:54] your angels encamped about you when
[1:25:56] you're in school your angels are still
[1:25:57] encamped about you when you're wherever
[1:25:59] you're at whatever you're doing
[1:26:01] that's why I'm not scared that God won't
[1:26:03] have a bride God has a big enough Army
[1:26:05] to produce a bride in this time a big
[1:26:07] enough influence in this age he did not
[1:26:09] send a prophet for no reason you can
[1:26:12] preach Doom and Gloom if you want to but
[1:26:13] I believe there's somebody that's going
[1:26:15] to make it
[1:26:16] somebody's gonna make it somebody's
[1:26:18] gonna have Godly children somebody's
[1:26:20] gonna have a church on fire for God why
[1:26:22] we we may be hid behind the veil but if
[1:26:24] we can see there's Angels at their
[1:26:26] positions
[1:26:28] we're in the presence of God all the
[1:26:29] time he said I'll never leave thee
[1:26:31] neither will ever forsake thee I'll be
[1:26:33] with thee always even unto the end but
[1:26:34] the veil is the flesh that's what keeps
[1:26:36] us out of his presence
[1:26:37] but through the soul of the Spirit by
[1:26:40] our faith we know he's watching us
[1:26:43] he's standing by us
[1:26:46] here
[1:26:47] now
[1:26:51] if I could press through the Veil
[1:26:56] that Veil kept him hidden
[1:26:58] he appeared in many ways
[1:27:00] in the Old Testament but he was hidden
[1:27:02] for what he really was
[1:27:05] come down as a baby in a Manger veiled
[1:27:08] himself once again in flesh all that
[1:27:10] what God was
[1:27:12] poured himself into a baby brother said
[1:27:14] it was little Jehovah crying in the
[1:27:16] manger
[1:27:17] he veiled himself in that and he lived
[1:27:20] and he walked on the earth and many
[1:27:22] people didn't understand because the
[1:27:23] flesh hit him
[1:27:25] but those who understood like the woman
[1:27:26] at the well she said when Messiah comes
[1:27:29] he's supposed to do these things he said
[1:27:30] I'm he
[1:27:31] and she ran into the City and said
[1:27:33] there's
[1:27:34] a messiah in town
[1:27:37] the son of man is revealed himself
[1:27:39] she was sure it was him because she
[1:27:41] could see the eyes of face she could see
[1:27:43] behind the veil
[1:27:45] but he walked through this Earth and and
[1:27:47] then he went to if you go and read the
[1:27:49] rest I don't have time today but if you
[1:27:51] read in that Hebrew series but the brown
[1:27:53] talks about how that Christ when he died
[1:27:56] and he rose again on the third day he
[1:27:58] said he he is he ascended he said and
[1:28:00] then descended to give gifts unto men he
[1:28:03] said and when he ascended he said he
[1:28:05] broke all the Gloom that covered over
[1:28:06] the Earth
[1:28:07] he said he broke the veil of the flesh
[1:28:11] oh God oh God all the Risen Christ broke
[1:28:15] the veil he said he broke the veil of
[1:28:17] depression are you struggling with
[1:28:18] depression today he broke the veil of
[1:28:21] depression he broke through the veil and
[1:28:23] if you could just get past your own Veil
[1:28:25] get past that if you could just get in
[1:28:27] the spirit of God in the presence of God
[1:28:29] under the right atmosphere you'd begin
[1:28:31] to speak words of inspiration why
[1:28:33] because you're not only surrounded by
[1:28:35] enemies but you're surrounded by angels
[1:28:37] and the angels are between you and your
[1:28:38] enemies
[1:28:39] you can't fail any more than God could
[1:28:42] fail
[1:28:45] Hallelujah
[1:28:48] see behind it tonight
[1:28:50] if we can press through enough
[1:28:52] and this is a real problem in the world
[1:28:54] that we live in
[1:28:55] he broke through the veil LED captivity
[1:28:57] captive and they could see it was him
[1:29:01] I think musicians would come tonight and
[1:29:02] I'm going to close
[1:29:04] I wonder if we could press through the
[1:29:05] Veil
[1:29:06] oh my God
[1:29:08] that's the presence of the Lord is here
[1:29:10] if you close your eyes with me
[1:29:16] sometimes you got to shut out the things
[1:29:19] of the world
[1:29:20] shut out the movies you've been watching
[1:29:22] shut out the
[1:29:24] news
[1:29:26] even sometimes shut out the chatter
[1:29:29] people talking about you said things
[1:29:31] just shut it out
[1:29:33] let go of it
[1:29:35] let go of the bitterness and the pain
[1:29:37] it's the flesh that's the Veil
[1:29:40] seeing angels
[1:29:42] huh
[1:29:44] but if you could just Reach Out by faith
[1:29:46] now I don't say you might see them
[1:29:47] physically I don't say that you can't
[1:29:51] but how much greater would it be if you
[1:29:52] didn't see him with these eyes but with
[1:29:54] the eyes of Faith
[1:29:56] see I know Lord your word is true
[1:30:00] I might feel all by myself maybe you're
[1:30:02] a young lady you feel all by yourself
[1:30:05] I feel like a kid's at school and the
[1:30:07] kids at work or even the home they don't
[1:30:08] understand you
[1:30:10] nobody really knows who you are
[1:30:13] but you're surrounded tonight
[1:30:15] if you could just reach out let your
[1:30:17] faith reach out just you bump into them
[1:30:19] over here and over here everywhere
[1:30:21] you're surrounded you can't go nowhere
[1:30:24] David says wither can I flee from thy
[1:30:26] presence
[1:30:27] he said if I go to hell behold Thou Art
[1:30:29] there if I take the wings of the morning
[1:30:32] fly Beyond this oceans you're there
[1:30:36] everywhere around you
[1:30:39] why don't you just surrender to him
[1:30:41] tonight Lord I believe
[1:30:44] I believe let me look past my
[1:30:46] circumstances let me look past my what
[1:30:49] I've been going on what's been going on
[1:30:50] in my life lately and I'll be like that
[1:30:52] little girl who was in a foreign country
[1:30:55] felt like I've never been this place
[1:30:57] before sometimes you feel like that
[1:30:58] don't you I've never been here before
[1:31:01] I've never had this this kind of
[1:31:03] problems maybe your kids got sick and
[1:31:05] your parents are are fighting or you're
[1:31:08] or your family's all in a plus I've
[1:31:10] never been here before I don't know what
[1:31:11] it's like
[1:31:13] I don't know how to handle it but I know
[1:31:15] I'm surrounded by angels
[1:31:17] I know I can feel his presence if I
[1:31:20] could just get behind the veil that's
[1:31:22] the problem of our age if we could just
[1:31:24] get through that Veil and break through
[1:31:27] we can see God's just as real as he ever
[1:31:29] was just as able to bring Revival but
[1:31:32] lay able to see her rejected him this
[1:31:34] nation rejected him but you don't have
[1:31:35] to you're the Bride of Jesus Christ look
[1:31:38] Beyond the Veil tonight and see Angels
[1:31:41] at their position
[1:31:42] comforting Angels Angels bringing joy
[1:31:46] and present and peace and long-suffering
[1:31:49] Angels coming to serve you to war for
[1:31:53] you oh my well I'm just crazy enough to
[1:31:57] believe it tonight
[1:31:58] why don't we just press through that
[1:32:00] Veil tonight and see Angels at their
[1:32:02] position
[1:32:03] at every pew
[1:32:04] oh Lord
[1:32:06] I pray you would do it tonight
[1:32:08] open our eyes oh God
[1:32:10] May our spiritual eyes be open until we
[1:32:13] can see
[1:32:15] we see what's on the news
[1:32:17] we see what's in the world that we're
[1:32:19] living in we see the problems
[1:32:22] we see people falling away
[1:32:25] but oh God it you could help us see
[1:32:27] beyond that today
[1:32:29] I can see angels
[1:32:31] I see Supernatural things working on my
[1:32:36] behalf
[1:32:37] supernatural beings working in my family
[1:32:39] I see my healing I see salvation for my
[1:32:42] children I see things the world can't
[1:32:45] see because I know it's true and even
[1:32:48] when I don't feel their presence I know
[1:32:50] that if I can just get through the veil
[1:32:52] of Flesh they'll be there
[1:32:54] because the angel of the Lord never
[1:32:57] leaves
[1:32:58] oh God help us to believe it tonight
[1:33:00] help us to take you at your word
[1:33:03] Lord and stand with faith and Assurance
[1:33:05] knowing that you are near
[1:33:08] I thank you for these people or they
[1:33:10] waited patiently on Sunday afternoon I
[1:33:12] pray you'd reveal your angels to him or
[1:33:15] in some way if it's only or just a a
[1:33:18] sense of your presence if we believe you
[1:33:20] Lord we know we can feel you we can it's
[1:33:22] not about the feeling but Lord sometimes
[1:33:25] we get weary we get like Elijah we run
[1:33:28] from God
[1:33:30] and your Prophet told us that you had an
[1:33:32] angel with soft hands
[1:33:34] to touch the brow of Elijah and an angel
[1:33:38] that knew how to cook to cook him a meal
[1:33:40] I pray that it would be so today
