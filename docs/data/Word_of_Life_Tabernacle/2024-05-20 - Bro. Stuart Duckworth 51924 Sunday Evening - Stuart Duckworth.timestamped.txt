[57:03] amen David we look here at David David
[57:06] was a man of
[57:08] prayer you look at David the shepherd
[57:11] boy and brother ramam says here and a
[57:13] god- called man he said and I think of
[57:16] the rugged training he did to David he
[57:18] never so much as schooled him into some
[57:20] school but he schooled him in his own
[57:23] school I like that he said David was was
[57:26] a hunter and a Shepherd in his Psalms he
[57:28] wrote of Green Pastures and Still Waters
[57:30] because there he was alone by himself he
[57:34] wasn't contaminated with the things of
[57:36] the world he says God has got to get a
[57:39] man away from the things of the world so
[57:41] he can get him quiet so he can listen to
[57:43] God that still Small Voice that once in
[57:46] contact with God he becomes Fearless
[57:49] then notice that he didn't care what
[57:51] anyone says he'd been in the presence of
[57:53] God Amen and he know he knew God in the
[57:56] power of his resurrection and that's the
[57:59] place that God wants for you young
[58:01] people here this evening amen a young
[58:03] Christian as a young Christian there
[58:05] will be times amen where it seems that
[58:07] you're all alone but that is the time to
[58:10] draw not to God that is a time in your
[58:13] life that that God wants to come in and
[58:15] reveal himself to you amen and to get
[58:19] closer to God Amen what are we told to
[58:21] do amen read your Bible and
[58:23] pray that's right amen but but this is a
[58:26] Time amen as David amen going to God's
[58:30] School you you may go to different
[58:32] schools all through your life you may
[58:33] move around and go to this one but
[58:35] there's no school more important than
[58:37] going to God's school going on the back
[58:40] side of the desert amen and getting in
[58:42] tune with that voice getting in tune
[58:44] with God by prayer amen and and
[58:47] dedicating and consecrating your life to
[58:50] him amen and in that alone time and and
[58:54] I can say that I was there
[58:56] amen if you if you're a Christian
[58:59] starting out amen and you've been in the
[59:02] way perhaps you can testify of that that
[59:05] amen and I I real I remember that there
[59:07] was just such a it seemed like such a
[59:09] long period of time where it it seemed
[59:11] like I didn't have amen the friends like
[59:14] I used to have why because I gave up the
[59:16] things of the world I gave up those old
[59:18] acquaintances and that's just the way
[59:19] it's going to be that's the way it's
[59:21] going to be but but when you get to that
[59:23] place where you feel all alone amen amen
[59:25] that's where God God he's got you right
[59:28] where he wants you God help me to speak
[59:30] tonight he's got you right to a place
[59:31] where he wants you Amen to where you can
[59:33] really get into the word and listen to
[59:36] the message of the hour and hear the
[59:38] voice of God Amen and get in tune with
[59:41] what the spirit is trying to do what
[59:43] it's trying to say amen for your
[59:45] generation Amen to develop a prayer life
[59:48] and to come in in into that into the
[59:50] that prayer life amen where the spirit
[59:53] of God can come and speak to you and
[59:55] reveal
[59:56] amen his things his word to
[1:00:00] you amen as young people God don't want
[1:00:04] you mixed up with the world he wants you
[1:00:07] to
[1:00:08] himself he wants you to himself so he
[1:00:10] can use you so you can be a witness for
[1:00:13] God come on he wants you Amen to a place
[1:00:17] where the world is shut out and where he
[1:00:19] is shut in
[1:00:22] amen we read on here and then David we
[1:00:26] see him one day God permitted a bear to
[1:00:28] come in and and get one of his sheep and
[1:00:30] David took just took after that bear no
[1:00:33] doubt but what he prayed because a
[1:00:35] little later on he confessed to it he he
[1:00:37] prayed and asked God and me he was a
[1:00:38] caretaker over the Sheep he could not
[1:00:41] lose that sheep and he must save that
[1:00:44] sheep at at all cost and he grabbed his
[1:00:47] little Shing slingshot and took after
[1:00:49] that bear and killed him he he must he
[1:00:51] must have he must save that sheep you
[1:00:53] see that was that was what God was
[1:00:55] training him for thank you Lord so
[1:00:58] David was anointed to be
[1:01:01] king Oh my he was anointed to be king
[1:01:05] amen for his day God had trained him on
[1:01:08] the on the back side of the of the of
[1:01:10] the the pastor there just amen realizing
[1:01:13] what his purpose was that that he was to
[1:01:15] protect the sheep and he's seen how God
[1:01:18] had done that all along amen and that
[1:01:20] that encouraged David and so he was
[1:01:24] anointed by the prophet to be king King

[1:10:52] prayed up amen ready ready for the
[1:10:54] battle
[1:10:56] that's we'll shift gears here a little
[1:10:58] bit Luke
[1:11:01] 11 and
[1:11:07] 1 and it came to
[1:11:10] pass as he was praying in a certain
[1:11:12] place when he ceased one of his
[1:11:15] disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
[1:11:19] pray as John also taught his
[1:11:22] disciples I believe we can still ask him
[1:11:24] that here this evening don't you teach
[1:11:27] us to pray
[1:11:28] Lord amen how do we get closer to God
[1:11:32] brother R said read your Bible and pray
[1:11:34] how simple is that but we can still come
[1:11:39] to God teach us Lord amen we can still
[1:11:43] learn from his word we can still learn
[1:11:45] from the spirit of God in prayer and
[1:11:49] Jesus didn't teach us by only words but
[1:11:52] he taught by example right and he was
[1:11:56] our
[1:11:58] example and brother Bram says here in
[1:12:00] Feast of the trumpets he says Lord it
[1:12:02] was set on one occasion by thy disciples
[1:12:05] teach us to pray for when we catch sight
[1:12:08] of the great God of heaven we do realize
[1:12:10] how insufficient we are so teach us to
[1:12:13] pray Lord in our hearts now for the
[1:12:14] things that would be beneficiary to your
[1:12:17] kingdom and for thy servants thou
[1:12:18] knowest the need of every person oh yeah
[1:12:23] Matthew 6
[1:12:25] you believe that tonight amen we're
[1:12:28] insufficient without him teach us Lord

[1:12:33] pray amen we we may be studied in the
[1:12:36] message we may we may have learned these
[1:12:38] prayers and and the right things to say
[1:12:41] and it's more than just saying the right
[1:12:42] things and getting up saying the right
[1:12:44] things amen but it's in sinc a sincerity
[1:12:48] God help us tonight to be sincere Amen
[1:12:50] to come before God teach me Lord bring
[1:12:53] me up higher bring my my relationship up

[1:13:00] me get back in tune with you God Amen
[1:13:03] help me to come up higher than what I
[1:13:07] am Matthew 6
[1:13:11] and9 very familiar scripture after this
[1:13:14] manner therefore pray ye Our Father

[1:13:21] thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:13:24] earth as it is is in heaven and give us

[1:13:31] lead us not into temptation but Deliver
[1:13:34] Us amen Deliver Us from Evil for thine
[1:13:37] is the kingdom and the power and the
[1:13:39] glory

[1:13:43] approach here Hallowed be thy name so
[1:13:46] our approach to God is
[1:13:49] everything amen we acknowledge God's
[1:13:52] holiness amen you come to him and not
[1:13:55] just in any old way but we come to him
[1:13:57] in a in a Consecration and the Bible
[1:13:59] says without Holiness no man shall see
[1:14:02] God so we approach him amen how we
[1:14:05] approach him in worship amen not just
[1:14:08] God give me this God give me that but
[1:14:11] there's an approach to God Amen and

[1:14:19] approach him in reverence we approach
[1:14:21] him in respect amen we come not to him
[1:14:24] Amen in our own own worthiness and our
[1:14:26] own righteousness amen but we come
[1:14:28] confessing our insufficiency amen and
[1:14:32] and even more so now that even after
[1:14:34] this this scripture was said amen amen
[1:14:36] the blood has been shed amen and so when

[1:14:41] it's not you coming amen but you're
[1:14:43] coming amen amen under the blood under
[1:14:46] the righteousness of the blood and when
[1:14:49] we come under that blood in prayer amen
[1:14:51] Amen brother random said amen it's not
[1:14:54] your voice that God God hears amen but
[1:14:56] it's the voice of Jesus Amen it's your
[1:14:58] voice speaking through that blood amen
[1:15:01] amen don't worry about your unworthiness
[1:15:03] amen don't worry about amen our our
[1:15:06] obvious in uh insufficient amen amen
[1:15:09] there's a blood that's been spilled for
[1:15:11] you and I that your voice can go through
[1:15:13] even now even now God is with within
[1:15:16] speaking distance everything you have
[1:15:18] need of is within speaking
[1:15:20] distance and we speak through the blood
[1:15:23] we approach God we approach our
[1:15:26] intercessor through the
[1:15:28] blood
[1:15:32] amen he said thy kingdom
[1:15:35] come so not so much a a literal Place

[1:17:16] will can be done and someone that he can
[1:17:18] form that he can fashion himself in amen
[1:17:21] that it wouldn't just be about me that
[1:17:24] it would be about
[1:17:25] him and and my commitment to him and and
[1:17:29] what he said he would do that I want to
[1:17:30] keep my part and and if we'll keep our
[1:17:33] part we know that God's going to keep
[1:17:35] his part right it's a little different
[1:17:37] tonight I'm just rolling with it I don't
[1:17:41] know I certainly love the Lord tonight
[1:17:44] oh yes so we're not here I take my time
[1:17:49] we're not here to establish our own
[1:17:52] kingdom and our own power and what we
[1:17:55] want to do but we're here amen thy
[1:17:57] kingdom come we're here to establish the
[1:18:01] kingdom of God God's kingdoms and
[1:18:03] brother Ram said you are
[1:18:04] Messiah holding forth the representation
[1:18:08] of the Messianic Kingdom amen amen when
[1:18:10] you surrender your will to God's will
[1:18:13] amen the Holy Ghost will come and anoint
[1:18:15] you to perform what God Said in his word
[1:18:18] of what would be and I I I think that's
[1:18:21] what brother brother Ben said today I
[1:18:23] think I heard him right
[1:18:25] it's not so much God speaking back to
[1:18:27] you though you can hear him in an
[1:18:28] audible voice and me but when God speaks
[1:18:31] it's his word living back through you
[1:18:33] amen and you're written Epistles read of
[1:18:35] all men amen amen and that's that's
[1:18:38] God's voice speaking back to you amen
[1:18:40] when God interprets his word when he
[1:18:42] does what he said he would do amen
[1:18:45] that's the voice of God speaking back
[1:18:47] through
[1:18:48] you when when he heals you come on he
[1:18:52] said in his word he would heal you amen
[1:18:55] and when you ask God to heal you he says
[1:18:57] all right I'm going to heal you he
[1:19:00] already said it in his word but God is
[1:19:03] is his own interpreter I wish I could
[1:19:06] preach tonight God is his own
[1:19:07] interpreter tonight amen and God will
[1:19:10] interpret his word through this Kingdom
[1:19:13] amen your needs whatever your need would
[1:19:15] be amen God comes down amen and you and
[1:19:18] God's will is done his word is done in
[1:19:22] you thank you Lord amen that's
[1:19:27] good you come under that Kingdom you
[1:19:29] come under that
[1:19:30] Authority you've approached God the
[1:19:33] right way and you come under that
[1:19:34] authority of the kingdom of God yes sir
[1:19:37] and brother R says you got to be
[1:19:39] identified with Christ is life living in
[1:19:42] you when you're identified with Christ
[1:19:44] is when Christ lives in you it isn't a
[1:19:47] ritual it isn't belonging in church
[1:19:49] that's all good but you you see the real
[1:19:52] sincerity of it he says and and that's
[1:19:54] What It Takes when he said when we come
[1:19:56] to Healing Services he said if you'll
[1:19:58] notice on the discernment line it's
[1:20:00] constantly tell the people to repent he
[1:20:02] said there you go till our prayers have
[1:20:04] become a tradition it's got to be it's
[1:20:07] got to go beyond a tradition it's got to
[1:20:09] go beyond a form right it's got to be a
[1:20:14] sincerity for you and I oh yes he goes
[1:20:18] on here he says we kneel down at night
[1:20:20] say Lord bless so and so bless so and so
[1:20:22] and help John do all he said you make a
[1:20:25] mascot and you make him some kind of
[1:20:27] Aaron boy God you do this and you do
[1:20:29] this that's not the way Jesus told us to
[1:20:32] pray he said Hallowed be thy name thy
[1:20:34] kingdom come he said but we try to order
[1:20:37] God what to do for us amen that's the
[1:20:40] wrong approach that's right you can't
[1:20:43] approach God like that right that you
[1:20:46] know what's best yeah right because
[1:20:50] you're coming to the one that knows
[1:20:52] you're coming to the one that can order
[1:20:54] your St steps you're coming to the one
[1:20:56] that can give you the understanding that
[1:20:58] can give you the Revelation amen for
[1:21:01] every step of your life if if you s if
[1:21:03] you're in and it's not a tradition to
[1:21:05] you amen and you come in sincerity amen
[1:21:08] God will give you an answer he'll leave
[1:21:10] you either give you a yes or he'll give
[1:21:12] you a
[1:21:14] no he says here he said but you see when
[1:21:19] when they ask these things and they ask
[1:21:20] for it he said they don't ask as Jesus
[1:21:23] said we try to make God aaronb Lord you
[1:21:25] do this for me and you did this for me
[1:21:27] and you go and do that and tell him what
[1:21:30] to
[1:21:32] do but don't ever think that you're so
[1:21:35] spiritual that God has to listen to you
[1:21:39] come
[1:21:39] on right you can be uh so Heavenly
[1:21:43] minded that you're no earthly good on
[1:21:46] right amen you're so spiritual that
[1:21:48] you've got it all figured out and you
[1:21:51] will never get an answer from God with
[1:21:53] that attitude that's right people become
[1:21:56] so spiritual that they think they know
[1:21:58] better than the word yeah so
[1:22:02] spiritual they'll pray for something and
[1:22:04] if God doesn't tell them a yes or no
[1:22:07] amen they they think that they can just
[1:22:09] go on and go over the word because
[1:22:11] they're so
[1:22:13] spiritual and maybe the word already
[1:22:16] told you what to do but you're so
[1:22:18] spiritual you can't even see it oh my
[1:22:21] what an attitude amen that we should
[1:22:24] watch out out for
[1:22:26] amen yeah I I think about prayer prayer
[1:22:29] is not it's it's not something uh under
[1:22:33] legalism right yeah that's right amen
[1:22:35] it's not a legalism but it's a sincerity
[1:22:39] that you come before God and you need an
[1:22:41] answer you need to bring your request
[1:22:43] before God Amen it's not you going
[1:22:45] before God and telling God what you
[1:22:46] think about
[1:22:48] it oh
[1:22:51] my praise the Lord
[1:22:59] amen oh my let's wait on the
[1:23:03] Lord again I don't know where I'm going
[1:23:05] I'm just rolling with it tonight
[1:23:08] okay Jesus said when you pray in this
[1:23:11] manner Our Father who art in heaven
[1:23:12] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:23:15] thy will be done who find where where we
[1:23:19] do that we're always wanting God to run
[1:23:20] errands for us to do something he said
[1:23:22] but when we're willing to say thy will
[1:23:24] be done oh commit ourselves to him
[1:23:27] commit our ways to him and all that we
[1:23:29] are committed to him then that's when
[1:23:32] God will will move when you're willing
[1:23:34] to let him work on you and not you work
[1:23:38] on him that's simple isn't it amen
[1:23:42] you're willing amen Lord let thy will be
[1:23:44] done amen that you can commit everything
[1:23:47] to God amen amen that you haven't got it
[1:23:49] all figured out and brother R said watch
[1:23:51] out for a person that's got it all
[1:23:53] figured out amen I need God's leading in
[1:23:56] my life I need his leading in my life
[1:23:58] for my family I don't know everything I
[1:24:00] I don't understand everything about the
[1:24:02] message I still need a revelation of the
[1:24:05] spirit and the only the only way I can
[1:24:07] do that is if I get before God and I ask
[1:24:09] him to show
[1:24:11] me that's the only way amen for Flesh
[1:24:14] and Blood doesn't reveal it amen but my
[1:24:17] Father which is in heaven amen shows it
[1:24:19] to you oh yes amen I need understanding
[1:24:22] I need knowledge yes I need wisdom I
[1:24:26] need to know how to lead my family I I
[1:24:28] need to know am man I we we got to walk
[1:24:30] in this sech we got to walk in this life
[1:24:32] and while we're here amen we we got to
[1:24:34] depend upon Him we've got to to commit
[1:24:37] it to him
[1:24:40] amen oh thank you Lord try to hurry here
[1:24:44] come brother R said there's a permissive
[1:24:47] will and a perfect will isn't that right
[1:24:49] Brethren he said I feel like for a long
[1:24:51] time I've kind of been the permissive
[1:24:53] will of God and not the perfect
[1:24:55] will man if a prophet of God could be in
[1:24:59] the permissive will what about you and
[1:25:01] I he thought he thought he knew what was
[1:25:04] right and the right way and he was in
[1:25:06] the permissive will what about you and I
[1:25:09] amen we've got to watch he said now
[1:25:12] there's a perfect way and a permissive
[1:25:13] way and I feel that if God here on the
[1:25:16] platform can show me the things that has
[1:25:18] been in in my rooms and so forth he's
[1:25:20] able to tell me just where he wants me
[1:25:22] uh and what he wants me to do and to be
[1:25:24] but I feel as long as I've got it all
[1:25:26] hooked up or I feel that he won't put
[1:25:28] his hands on it as long as I'm doing it
[1:25:31] and that's the way it is anything amen
[1:25:33] God permitted the prophet to operate as
[1:25:36] he wanted to he permitted him and and he
[1:25:39] got to where it was really just him
[1:25:41] opting to continue to operate like that
[1:25:45] right but he wanted God's hands on what
[1:25:47] he done do you feel the same way I don't
[1:25:50] just want to live my life and how I want
[1:25:52] to live it amen I don't just want to
[1:25:54] walk about amen but I I want God's hand
[1:25:57] leading me amen I want to be under
[1:25:59] prayer under the spirit of Prayer in
[1:26:01] this hour amen God leading me Amen in
[1:26:04] this hour I want him to have control of
[1:26:06] my life every decision every move amen
[1:26:09] his perfect
[1:26:12] will he goes on as long as you're going
[1:26:15] as long as you're going to do it as
[1:26:17] someone talks about you and and you just
[1:26:19] talk back about them God can't fight
[1:26:22] your battle you're fighting it yourself
[1:26:25] on he said just let loose and let him do
[1:26:27] it and just commit it to him he said the
[1:26:29] greatest weapon that I know of of a
[1:26:31] Christian today is a committ to God when

[1:28:31] me
[1:28:35] people in a time of decision we look at
[1:28:38] elaser he's known as the model servant
[1:28:41] why why was he known as the model
[1:28:43] servant he was sent to find a bride for
[1:28:47] Isaac and we find here brother Bram says
[1:28:49] he says we find out that elzar decided
[1:28:51] that though he was a good man and he was
[1:28:54] on a great Mission but he was under an
[1:28:57] oath amen he was under an oath and so he
[1:29:01] says now when a man gets to that place
[1:29:03] it's time not to use his own thinking so
[1:29:06] he knelt down and began to pray and he
[1:29:08] said Lord if you blessed me in the way
[1:29:10] and you've brought me here let it come
[1:29:11] to pass that the first damel that comes
[1:29:14] am me from the city to get water and he
[1:29:16] said because it was the evening time
[1:29:18] that they come out to get their water he
[1:29:20] said I'll go and ask her for a drink he
[1:29:22] said see was him asking a sign and if
[1:29:24] she gives me a drink he he said I'll
[1:29:27] also water your camels that will be the
[1:29:29] one that you have chosen he committed it
[1:29:31] to God he said Let It Be Your Choice
[1:29:34] Lord he said oh if we can only learn to
[1:29:36] to be a trusted servant of God like that
[1:29:39] then we could commit to things of God
[1:29:41] things to God it's the most powerful
[1:29:43] thing that I know of is a committ commit
[1:29:45] thy ways commit your thinking if you're
[1:29:47] sick and the doctors can't help you no
[1:29:48] more just to commit the the case to God
[1:29:51] and act like it's already done amen
[1:29:53] something will have to take place it
[1:29:55] just can't keep from it because God is a
[1:30:00] Creator he talks about a seed when you
[1:30:03] commit a seed into the ground am man you
[1:30:05] don't go the next day and dig it up
[1:30:07] you've got to commit it to the ground
[1:30:09] right that's right you've got to commit
[1:30:11] it to the ground and and you don't come
[1:30:13] back the next day and try to dig up dig
[1:30:14] it up or a week later and expect to for
[1:30:17] it to be fully grown it takes
[1:30:19] time but he says here is and you can put
[1:30:21] me on record after 30 years of preaching
[1:30:23] I can say this I've never one time
[1:30:25] sincerely asked God for anything and
[1:30:28] committed it to him he either give it to
[1:30:30] me or he told me why he couldn't do it
[1:30:32] yes sir amen if we'll take that attitude
[1:30:35] in this hour amen I think it'll take a
[1:30:37] lot of the disappointment away if we'll
[1:30:40] take that attitude that God I'm going to
[1:30:42] commit it to you amen you're either
[1:30:44] going to give it to me or you're going
[1:30:45] to tell me you can't do it whatever it
[1:30:47] is Lord let thy will be done thy kingdom
[1:30:50] come in this earth amen and if we have
[1:30:54] the right mental attitude towards God's
[1:30:58] word amen that's what brings it to pass
[1:31:01] do you believe that sir that's what
[1:31:04] brings it to pass commit it to him and
[1:31:07] know that he's in control of the thing
[1:31:10] amen Isaiah 56
[1:31:13] and6 you love the Lord yes
[1:31:19] sir thought this was good we'll try to
[1:31:21] close on this if we can Isaiah 56 and6
