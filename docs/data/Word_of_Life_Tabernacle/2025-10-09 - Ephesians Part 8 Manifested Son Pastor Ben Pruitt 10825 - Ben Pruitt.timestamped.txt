[14:05] with cold. But the blessed Savior heard
[14:09] me when I cried.
[14:12] Then he threw his robe around me and he
[14:16] led me to his home. And I'm living on
[14:20] the hallelujah side.

[14:49] with her dazzle and her dreams, yet I
[14:53] envy not her vanities and pride.

[15:35] would I leave this precious place,
[15:37] though the tempter to persuade me off
[15:41] has tried.
[15:43] For I'm safe in God's pavilion, happy in
[15:47] his love of grace. And I'm living on the
[15:51] hallelujah side.

[16:20] the sky is always bright. Just no place
[16:23] for gloomy Christians to abide.
[16:28] For my soul is filled with music and my
[16:31] heart with great delight. And I'm living
[16:35] on. I'll sing with all your hearts now.

[17:02] and upon the streets of glory when we
[17:05] reach the other shore and have safely
[17:08] crossed the Jordan's rolling tide.
[17:12] Well, you will find me shouting glory
[17:16] just outside the mansion door where I'm
[17:19] living on the hallelujah. Oh, clap your
[17:23] hands now. Sing it. Oh, glory be to

[35:50] Any day now. Oh, you believe it. Tonight
[35:54] we'll be going home. One more time.
[35:57] Count the years.
[36:00] So why don't you count the years as
[36:03] much?
[36:07] Oh, count the months as we.
[36:15] Oh, count the weeks as days,
[36:20] any day now.
[36:22] [Music]
[36:24] Oh, will be gold when home.
[36:30] Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly
[36:32] Father, we're so grateful for your love
[36:35] and your goodness to us, Lord, for your
[36:38] longsuffering. We thank you for your
[36:39] kindness,
[36:41] Lord. We thank you for that promise of
[36:43] going home. As I can think, Lord, many
[36:46] times when traveling, Lord, and we get
[36:48] far away from home, how our hearts long
[36:51] for home, Lord, as pilgrims and
[36:53] strangers here in this earth, we're
[36:55] we're we're we're longing for home. We
[36:58] want to see you, Lord. We we want to
[37:00] experience that place, oh God, where all
[37:03] things are perfect, Lord, and there's no
[37:06] pain, there's no worry, there's no
[37:07] sickness, Lord. I believe that right now
[37:10] is a preparation for that time. Pray
[37:13] that you'd help us, Lord, mold in us
[37:15] that character that would be ready to go
[37:18] to that place. I pray. Pray that you'd
[37:20] move in this congregation. Bless us
[37:22] tonight. May we have your word revealed
[37:24] to us not by a man, Lord, by your
[37:27] spirit. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[37:32] Thank the Lord.
[37:34] Thank the Lord.
[37:37] Amen. Ephesians chapter 1 verses 5 and
[37:39] six.
[37:41] Ephesians
[37:43] chapter 1:es 5 and 6.
[37:51] That's my fault. Peter,
[37:54] Ephesians 5 and six. If you'll turn down
[37:58] what I turned up earlier, you can fix
[38:00] that.
[38:07] Having predestinated us. How many are
[38:09] glad for predestination tonight?
[38:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I'd be a
[38:13] discouraged man if it wasn't for
[38:15] predestination."
[38:17] I'm so glad that we know that we've been
[38:19] chosen by God and predestined to go to a
[38:22] place. He said, "Unto the adoption of
[38:25] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[38:28] according to the good pleasure of his
[38:30] will, to the praise of the glory of his
[38:33] grace, wherein he hath made us accepted
[38:37] in the beloved." I pray the Lord would
[38:39] add his blessing to the reading of the
[38:40] word. You may be seated
[38:44] as we're continuing in our study of
[38:47] Ephesians, but I've kind of stopped here
[38:49] for a little while on the subject of
[38:51] adoption. And I think it's very
[38:54] important, but I want us to remember the
[38:56] the backdrop of this teaching. If you go
[38:58] listen to the adoption series, brother
[39:00] Brandham has just went had the
[39:02] experience of going beyond the curtain
[39:04] of time and he's just stepped into
[39:06] another dimension and he's able to see
[39:09] uh the people that are there. I believe
[39:11] that he saw us there and and and he saw
[39:14] the people that were in new bodies and
[39:17] he he said, "I've taught what Paul
[39:19] taught and and baptized in the name of
[39:22] Jesus and all of those things." And they
[39:23] said, "We're resting on that." and and
[39:26] he comes out of that experience and just
[39:29] a little while later preaches this
[39:31] adoption series. And so what brother
[39:34] Brandham is doing is he begins to lay
[39:36] the groundwork. Uh and and towards the
[39:38] end of his life, he preaches a message
[39:41] called the rapture. And I don't believe
[39:43] that was an accident that he did it the
[39:45] way that he did it because everything
[39:47] leading up to that was actually
[39:50] preparation for that. In fact, Brandon
[39:53] makes this statement that this adoption
[39:55] teaching, the teaching about election,
[39:57] about predestination, all of these
[39:59] things was actually preparation for the
[40:02] opening of the seals. That if you didn't
[40:04] understand, if you didn't know who you
[40:06] were, then you wouldn't know about the
[40:08] seals and about those things that were
[40:10] being opened. So, it's very, very
[40:12] important to us because of the time that
[40:14] we live in. And so, that's why I'll say
[40:16] things like we live in the age of
[40:18] adoption. We live in the hour of
[40:20] adoption or the age of the opening of
[40:22] the word, the age of the open book. And
[40:25] we live in the time of what is that? The
[40:27] time of preparation. The time I'm not
[40:30] telling you that we already have it. I'm
[40:32] telling you that we're on our way. And
[40:34] we're farther along than we were
[40:36] yesterday. How many are glad to be
[40:37] farther along than you were yesterday?
[40:39] And we still struggle. We'll get into
[40:41] that later. We still have problems, but
[40:43] yet we're farther along than where we
[40:46] were before. So this is where we need to
[40:48] be. This is where our placing is. This
[40:51] is where our our life needs to be so we
[40:55] can go over there. And so we want to
[40:57] look at Romans chapter 8 tonight. Romans
[40:59] chapter 8 and verse 15. My wife's not
[41:02] here tonight. She uh sick at home and
[41:05] and uh so you'd be praying for her and
[41:07] each one that's not feeling well. We had
[41:09] a rough couple of days, but I appreciate
[41:11] all of you showing up tonight. I thought
[41:12] it might look like one of those COVID
[41:14] nights, but I appreciate you being here
[41:16] tonight.
[41:18] Romans 8:15 says, "For you have not
[41:20] received the spirit of bondage again to
[41:24] fear, but you have received the spirit
[41:27] of adoption whereby we cry, Abba,
[41:30] Father." So the spirit of adoption, once
[41:33] we have received that, it takes away
[41:34] fear and causes us to worship. 16, the
[41:38] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[41:40] spirit that we are the children of God.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; So adoption, I want you to notice, and
[41:46] we'll get into more of this at a later
[41:48] date, but adoption ties to the token.
[41:50] Adoption ties to the token being on
[41:53] display in our lives. And that's the
[41:55] fullness of our adoption is to have the
[41:57] token on display in our lives. We we'll
[42:00] talk about that maybe in another sermon.
[42:03] But he said, "The spirit itself beareth
[42:05] witness with our spirit. We are the
[42:06] children of God. and of children than
[42:08] hes
[42:09] of God joint hes with Christ if so be
[42:12] that we suffer with him that we may be
[42:13] also glorified together. He said for I
[42:16] reckon that the sufferings of this
[42:18] present time are not worthy to be
[42:20] compared with the glory which shall be
[42:23] revealed in us for the earnest
[42:26] expectation of the creature or the
[42:28] creation waitth for the manifestation of
[42:32] the sons of God. That word manifestation
[42:35] is the same word as revelation. It's
[42:36] apocalypsis. It's revelation. Something
[42:39] that's made fully known. Full
[42:42] disclosure. So it's the full disclosure
[42:45] of something formally unknown. Look at
[42:47] the Amplified Bible how it puts it. It
[42:50] says, "For even the whole creation, all
[42:52] nature waits expectantly and longs
[42:55] earnestly for God's sons to be made
[42:58] known. waits for the revealing, the
[43:01] disclosing of their sunship. So, it's
[43:04] not making them sons. As we said, it's
[43:07] not adoption that you're being brought
[43:09] from one family to another, but it's the
[43:11] disclosing of sons, the revelation of
[43:14] sons, the manifesting of sons. It's
[43:17] recognizing who you are and re and and
[43:20] and displaying who you are, manifesting
[43:23] who you are. He said, "For the creature
[43:25] was made subject to vanity, not
[43:27] willingly, but by reason of him who has
[43:29] subjected the same in hope, because the
[43:32] creature itself also shall be delivered
[43:35] from the bondage of corruption into the
[43:37] glorious liberty of the children of
[43:38] God." So Paul's telling them, it's not
[43:41] just what we have. The spirit, that's
[43:43] not all we're going to have. There's
[43:44] going to be a reality to it that is
[43:46] going to change even these bodies. See,
[43:49] even the earth that we live on, it's
[43:51] also considered in redemption. and it's
[43:53] going to be remade. It's not always
[43:55] going to be this way, church. And
[43:57] listen, no matter how hard your life
[43:58] gets, no matter what situations you
[44:01] might go through, and there's people all
[44:02] over the earth tonight dealing with war
[44:04] and struggle and natural disasters and
[44:08] sickness and all kinds of different
[44:09] things. But you got to remember this is
[44:12] not going to always be this way. There's
[44:14] coming a new country, a new city. He
[44:17] said, "Behold, I make all things new."
[44:20] How many are looking forward to that
[44:21] time? So we know this is not the end but
[44:24] this is the preparation for that. So he
[44:27] said not only they we know the whole
[44:29] creation groanth and travaleth in pain
[44:31] together until now. Verse 23 and not
[44:34] only they but ourselves also which have
[44:37] the first fruits of the spirit even we
[44:41] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[44:44] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[44:47] of our body. So he's saying all nature
[44:48] groans and we groan waiting for what?
[44:52] The adoption, the redemption of our
[44:54] body. So what we're considering here is
[44:57] more than just another teaching or a
[45:00] better way of living, but we're
[45:01] considering actually a a a change of our
[45:05] bodies. So we find that we are God's
[45:08] children. We're in his thoughts. We
[45:10] bypassed our word body, our our
[45:12] theophony, and came to the earth to be
[45:14] tested. We're made subject to fall. but
[45:17] redeemable.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that today. If you
[45:20] are redeemed, it's because you were
[45:22] God's to begin with
[45:24] &gt;&gt; because that's what redemption means.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; We were born in sin, came into the world
[45:29] speaking lies, and we needed a savior.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He is that savior.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; If you need a savior tonight, he is that
[45:36] savior. How are we saved? We're saved by
[45:40] the by the blood of Jesus Christ. We're
[45:42] saved by faith in that blood. were saved
[45:44] by that seed gene coming to life. You
[45:48] could put it many different ways.
[45:49] Brother talked about he how he
[45:52] remembered sitting out by the tree
[45:54] waiting on parties to end at his home.
[45:56] And he talked about how that he always
[45:59] knew there was something different. He
[46:00] had two natures, but he said he only
[46:03] catered to one nature, but he had two.
[46:06] And and he remembered having a a
[46:08] consciousness that something was wrong,
[46:10] but he didn't know what it was. But
[46:12] because he it had never been he'd never
[46:14] been enlightened. He didn't know
[46:16] anything about it. He said he'd even uh
[46:18] he he'd camp out by the river and he
[46:20] said there'd be a a place where all
[46:23] winter long the cold and the snow would
[46:25] come over the bank. And he said and then
[46:27] there would be ice over it. And he said
[46:29] and then he built a fire over it. And so
[46:31] it had been burnt. It it had had heat
[46:33] and it it had cold. He said but in the
[46:35] spring a flower would come up. He'd look
[46:37] at it and said, "Little flower, where'd
[46:39] you come from?" Yeah,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; that seems pretty basic, doesn't it? But
[46:42] there was something in him that made him
[46:44] realize that there was life beyond this
[46:47] life somewhere. And and so he only
[46:50] catered to one nature, but but but the
[46:52] other one was there. And you always were
[46:54] a son or daughter of God. You may not
[46:56] have known it, but you always were. And
[46:59] brother Brandon said, "There was a
[47:00] time," he said, "Yet all at once, I
[47:01] looked up and I said, "I'm not the son
[47:04] of Charles and Ella Brandom." There's
[47:06] something calling. How many of you,
[47:08] Brother Brandham talked about it like
[47:09] this? He said, he said, "Can you
[47:10] fellowship with me on this thought?" He
[47:13] said, "That you've there's always been
[47:14] something calling." I think many of us
[47:16] could say amen to that today. We didn't
[47:18] know what it was. We couldn't understand
[47:20] it. We couldn't even comprehend it. But
[47:22] there's something calling. He said,
[47:23] "Like the little eagle, brother Brandon
[47:25] told the story about the eagle that was
[47:27] down in a chicken pin and it had been
[47:29] raised as a chicken. It identified as a
[47:32] chicken. It thought it was a chicken,
[47:34] but one day it recognized I I didn't I
[47:37] there's something different about me.
[47:38] I'm not satisfied with the chicken pin.
[47:41] And when it heard a scream of its
[47:42] mother, it began to change its thinking
[47:45] and begin to realize what it could do.
[47:47] It already had the potentials of an
[47:49] eagle. It already was an eagle. It just
[47:52] needed to hear the scream of an eagle.
[47:54] Listen, you and I already were children
[47:56] of God. We just needed to hear the
[47:58] message of the hour. It needed to strike
[48:00] our souls.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm not the son of Charles.
[48:04] There's something different, something
[48:05] calling. I'm not a chicken. There's
[48:07] something up yonder somewhere." Oh,
[48:08] great Jehovah, whoever you are, open up.
[48:11] I want to come home. There's something
[48:13] in me calling.
[48:15] See, you can't put that in somebody.
[48:17] That's got to be there. And if it is
[48:19] there, we ought to thank God every day
[48:21] that there's something in our hearts, no
[48:22] matter what what amount of darkness
[48:24] might be surrounding that seed, but
[48:26] there's still a seed there for the wall.
[48:28] And it will come up if there's a seed
[48:30] there at all.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; It's got to come up.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I was born again.
[48:36] That little life was laying there. He
[48:39] said the life of water was poured upon
[48:42] it and then it began to grow. And now
[48:44] that old life was forgiven, put in the
[48:46] sea of God's forgetfulness.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; To never be remembered against me no
[48:51] more.
[48:52] He said, "See, now we stand justified as
[48:55] though we'd never sinned."
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; In the presence of God.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; But the Brandham illustrated that by the
[49:02] eagle story and also by his duck story.
[49:04] I've told it to you before, but the duck
[49:07] got put in the chicken pin as well. And
[49:09] and he just around the farm and and and
[49:11] he's just uh he's just acting like it
[49:13] all the other birds acted around the
[49:15] farm. He'd never swam any in his life.
[49:18] He'd never seen water, only the drinking
[49:20] water, maybe muddy water that they put
[49:22] out. But the man said one day he got far
[49:24] enough behind the barn that he caught a
[49:26] scent of the pond. And when he caught a
[49:28] scent of water, he could smell the
[49:30] water. There was something in him, a
[49:32] deep calling to the deep that responded
[49:34] to that water. That's what we're looking
[49:36] for, church. We're not looking for an
[49:38] emotion or a sensation. We're looking
[49:40] for something in the life of a person
[49:42] that can respond to the word of God.
[49:44] That's my home. That's where I was born.
[49:46] That's what I'm coming from.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there'll be emotion.
[49:52] There'll be sensation. There'll be a new
[49:54] birth. There's got to be a new birth.
[49:55] But it's got to begin with just a with
[49:58] just a desire in your heart. Lord, I I
[50:00] believe there's something more than what
[50:02] I am today.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:06] Hallelujah.
[50:07] The B said the new birth is Christ is a
[50:11] revelation.
[50:12] God has revealed to you this great
[50:14] mystery and that's a new birth. Now,
[50:18] what are you going to do when you get
[50:19] all that grouped together? Now, he says,
[50:20] "So, the new birth is a revelation.
[50:24] So you being manifested, you can say it
[50:27] like this, the manifestation of the son
[50:30] of God that you are, the daughter of God
[50:32] that you are, begins with the new birth.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Right. That's when it begins to be
[50:38] manifested.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And once it's started, it can't stop.
[50:44] Somebody's ought ought to say amen to
[50:46] that.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Once it started, it can't stop. So once
[50:52] if you ever were a son, you always were
[50:54] a son.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And so once you get started, once you
[50:58] may you may have temporary backsidings
[51:00] and misunderstandings and trouble
[51:02] because you live in a body of flesh, but
[51:04] once you're started, you can't stop
[51:07] because what's happened is you're
[51:09] beginning to be manifested. You're a
[51:11] seed gene of God that's beginning to
[51:13] manifest from the inside out. Brandon
[51:16] said it's like a spot of light. He said
[51:18] like a button. And he said that gets in
[51:19] your heart and it begins to grow and it
[51:21] begins to push out all the darkness
[51:23] that's in your life. He said that's when
[51:24] you start having trouble is when it
[51:26] starts pushing out that darkness. The
[51:28] darkness don't like it. And so you start
[51:30] having trouble that you the
[51:32] sanctification's got to happen. There's
[51:34] a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's got
[51:36] to take place. What is it is pushing
[51:37] that darkness out. Yes, you'll have
[51:40] trouble, but you got to greater is he
[51:42] that's in you than he that's in the
[51:44] world. I'm glad for him tonight. Yes.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bram says, "Then when the
[51:49] where the revelation is perfectly in
[51:51] harmony, what are you going to do when
[51:54] you get all that grouped together? Where
[51:56] the revelation is perfectly in harmony
[51:58] &gt;&gt; and God expressing it through his word
[52:01] by the same actions, the same things
[52:03] that he did, making the word manifest."
[52:08] And brother Brandon, you can hear the
[52:09] cry of a prophet here. Oh, if the church
[52:11] only knew its position.
[52:15] Hallelujah. I love this. It will one
[52:18] day.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; It will one day. How you going to know
[52:21] your position? By the message of the
[52:23] hour. That's how we're going to know our
[52:25] position. Somebody's got to preach it.
[52:27] Somebody's got to live it. We got to
[52:28] keep the church doors open. Let's keep
[52:30] the church doors open. Keep preaching
[52:32] the message. Let's keep our Let's Let's
[52:34] keep listening to the prophet of the
[52:36] age. Can we do that? Let's keep reading
[52:38] our Bibles. Let's keep praying because
[52:39] we know there's going to come a time
[52:41] when the bride knows who she is. It will
[52:43] one day. Then the rapture will go when
[52:46] it knows what it is.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] Revelation of who you are as sons and
[52:53] daughters begins with the new birth and
[52:55] ends with the body change.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we're changed into that
[53:00] same image from glory to glory. I'm not
[53:03] going to hold you long tonight. So just
[53:05] stay with me as we go through this.
[53:06] Maybe the most important thing that I'll
[53:09] say as far as this adoption series is
[53:12] concerned is tonight because it's
[53:14] something that's very important to us.
[53:16] We want to be a manifestation of the
[53:19] sons and daughters of God. We want to
[53:22] become what the gene seed is on the
[53:24] inside that we need to become that. And
[53:27] that's what we're preaching about
[53:28] tonight. Genesis 1:26,
[53:30] God said, "Let us make man in our image
[53:33] after our likeness. Let them have
[53:34] dominion." And so you might say, "Well,
[53:35] brother Ben, what are we supposed to
[53:37] become?" Well, this is what we're
[53:39] becoming because we know when Adam come
[53:42] to the earth, he was God's seed gene
[53:44] word uh expressed on the earth. This is
[53:48] what a man was supposed to look like on
[53:50] the earth. Right? And when he separated
[53:53] Eve from his side, this is what a man
[53:55] and a woman was supposed to look like.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; This is what they were supposed to look
[53:59] like. This is what they were supposed to
[54:01] do
[54:02] &gt;&gt; and to be. They were to have dominion.
[54:06] Dominion over the fish of the sea, over
[54:08] the fowl of the air, over the cattle,
[54:10] over all the earth, over every creeping
[54:12] thing that creepeth upon the earth. That
[54:14] word dominion is to exercise authority
[54:17] over
[54:19] you as nations or other entities, even
[54:21] natural ones like animals. So, that word
[54:24] is it's to tread on. It's to rule. So,
[54:28] we were to have dominion over the earth.
[54:31] And how are we to do that? Brother
[54:32] Brandham uh kind of gives us an insight
[54:34] into that. It wasn't that we were to do
[54:36] that by natural ability. He said right
[54:38] now you take an axe and chop a tree
[54:40] down. It's a form of dominion, but it's
[54:43] not the kind of dominion that Adam had.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Cuz the axe had never been invented, but
[54:48] he had full dominion. What was it? He
[54:50] could speak and something would happen,
[54:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:53] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do we know that, Brother
[54:55] Ben?" Because that's what Jesus did when
[54:56] he was here.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; The second Adam came and when he came,
[55:00] what did he do? He He spoke and things
[55:02] happened. He spoke and the storm
[55:04] stealed. He spoke and the tree came back
[55:06] to or or died rather. He spoke and
[55:09] things happened. He and he told us if
[55:11] you speak to this mountain, if you said
[55:13] this mountain be removed, it cast into
[55:15] the sea, it'll be done even as you said.
[55:17] So that's the kind of dominion that
[55:18] we're talking about.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; So the Pharisees when Jesus come that
[55:23] second Adam, they called him a
[55:25] blasphemer. Why? Because he said he was
[55:27] the son of God. And what was he saying
[55:29] when he said he was the son of God? So
[55:32] I'm kind of hurrying through this, but I
[55:33] think you'll get my thought and what I'm
[55:35] trying to say to you. But the Pharisees
[55:38] called him a blasphemer and said, "You
[55:39] can't say that." And Jesus answered them
[55:42] in John 10:34 and said, "Is it not
[55:44] written in your law?" I said, "You're
[55:46] gods. if he called them gods unto whom
[55:48] the word of God came and the scripture
[55:51] cannot be broken. Say ye of him whom the
[55:53] father has sanctified and sent into the
[55:55] world that blasphe because I said I'm
[55:57] the son of God. So he's saying you you
[55:59] called the prophets gods. Then wouldn't
[56:02] I be would how can I be a blasphemer
[56:05] saying I'm the son of God? Now why were
[56:07] they called that? Because God backed up
[56:09] their word, right? What they said come
[56:12] to pass. Oh church, look listen. We're
[56:15] not talking about brother Brandham being
[56:17] a son of God tonight. Brother Brandham
[56:20] being manifested as a son of God. Jesus
[56:22] being manifested as a son of God. We're
[56:23] talking about you being manifested, me
[56:26] being manifested as a son of God.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; So, brother Bren said, "Now, this may
[56:31] just choke you to death, but did
[56:35] you might need that that Heimlick
[56:38] maneuver tonight.
[56:40] This may just choke you to death, but
[56:41] did you know that men that are sons of
[56:43] God are amateur gods?" Yeah.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; How many ever know that? He said, "How
[56:47] many knows that Jesus said so?"
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; He was referencing that scripture we
[56:50] just read. He said he gave him dominion
[56:53] over all things. He lost his godship,
[56:55] lost his sunship, lost his domain, and
[56:57] Satan took it over. But brother, we're
[57:00] waiting for the manifestations of the
[57:01] sons of God who will come back and take
[57:03] it over again.
[57:05] He said, "Waiting for the fullness of
[57:07] time. When the pyramid gets up to the
[57:08] top, when the full sons of God will be
[57:10] manifested, when the power of God will
[57:13] walk out and will take every power that
[57:15] Satan's got away from him. Yes, sir. He
[57:18] said it belongs to him. Who does it
[57:19] belong to? Belongs to you.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Satan's a squatter. It belongs to you.
[57:26] He said he made man a god. A god in his
[57:28] domain. His domain goes from sea to sea,
[57:31] from shore to shore. He has the control
[57:33] of it. And when Jesus came being the one
[57:36] God without sin, he proved it. When the
[57:38] winds blow, he said, "Peace be still."
[57:40] When the tree, he said, "No man eat from
[57:41] thee. Verily I say to you, this little
[57:43] gods, if you'll say to this mountain, be
[57:45] moved and don't doubt in your heart, but
[57:47] believe that what you said will come to
[57:48] pass." You can have what you said. He
[57:51] said, "Now the world and nature is
[57:52] groaning, crying, everything's moving."
[57:56] &gt;&gt; What? for the manifestation of the sons
[57:58] of God.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; When true sons, born sons, filled sons,
[58:02] he's talking about me right here.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; I hope he's talking about you tonight.
[58:06] True sons, born sons, filled sons, speak
[58:08] and their word is back.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; He said, I believe we're on the border
[58:12] of it right now. Yes, sir. Say to this
[58:14] mountain, let it be so.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; True sons, filled sons, born sons. Oh
[58:22] my. I I tell you what, church, we're
[58:25] we're we're we're on the on the cusp of
[58:28] something.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; And and and I believe we're we've
[58:31] experienced something and we've got
[58:32] something maybe we don't even realize.
[58:35] Brother Brandham
[58:37] gives some examples of that. And one of
[58:39] the examples he gives is that someone
[58:41] would say uh he said a Christian, a
[58:43] believer would come and say, "I don't uh
[58:47] my crops are burning. I need rain." And
[58:49] I I've always wondered, "Well, why
[58:51] wouldn't the believer just speak it for
[58:52] his own?" But maybe that would be
[58:54] because there'd be different levels of
[58:55] people of believers who've come to
[58:57] different stages of maturity. But he
[59:00] said he they would come and say, "My
[59:02] crops are burning. I need rain." He
[59:03] said, "And this manifested son of God
[59:06] would stand there and say, uh, I call
[59:08] for rain." Have you heard brother Random
[59:11] say that?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; I call for rain. And the rain would
[59:14] come.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:17] I know we're sitting there thinking,
[59:18] "Well, I'm a long ways off of that." How
[59:20] many times have you sat there and looked
[59:23] at a storm coming at your picnic
[59:26] and thought, "I'm just going to speak
[59:28] that out of existence and it didn't
[59:29] happen."
[59:31] Now, be honest with me. That didn't ever
[59:34] cross your mind when you were about to
[59:36] face an inconvenience
[59:38] of some kind and you sit there, well,
[59:39] brother Brandham spoke a storm. Jesus
[59:41] spoke a storm, right? But brother
[59:43] Brandham taught us that was by
[59:44] inspiration.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Right? It had to come by inspiration. I
[59:49] I I want to show you something here
[59:51] because that potential is in us now.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:55] &gt;&gt; See, when you receive the baptism of the
[59:56] Holy Ghost, all the power that ever was
[59:58] in the universe
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; is in you.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, you take a
[1:00:03] spoonful of water out of the ocean. All
[1:00:06] the p all the same chemicals that are in
[1:00:08] the ocean are in that spoonful.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; It's the same, but it's a portion of
[1:00:12] God. So, that's already in you, Brother
[1:00:14] Joe. It's already in us to be that. You
[1:00:17] say, "Well, why do I have to deal with
[1:00:18] the things I deal with now?" Well, let's
[1:00:20] see. Let's look at it for just a moment.
[1:00:22] It's it's important, I think, because
[1:00:25] you know, we realize that the fullness
[1:00:27] of manifesting of sons is the
[1:00:30] millennium. Now, I don't want to put off
[1:00:32] something to the mill all things to the
[1:00:35] millennium because we need to be careful
[1:00:36] about this because some people put
[1:00:38] healing off to the millennium and
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; right
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandon said, "Why would we
[1:00:42] need healing in the millennium?"
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I believe that we can speak the
[1:00:46] word right now and things can happen,
[1:00:47] right?
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a perfection
[1:00:50] of it, a fullness of it, and the reason
[1:00:53] will be because we'll be in new bodies.
[1:00:55] But did you ever wonder why is there a
[1:00:57] millennium?
[1:01:00] I've wondered that.
[1:01:03] I'll be honest with you. I thought,
[1:01:04] Lord, why have a thousand-y year reign?
[1:01:07] Why not just fast forward? Because I'm a
[1:01:10] cleancut kind of guy, you I'd rather
[1:01:12] just get it over with. And when Jesus
[1:01:14] comes back to the earth, why reign for a
[1:01:16] thousand years and let the sa let Satan
[1:01:18] come back,
[1:01:20] right? Because he's already a healer, a
[1:01:22] redeemer. The church mystery of the
[1:01:23] church has already been. But there's got
[1:01:25] to be a time. The Brandom taught us that
[1:01:27] that that the thousand-year reign that
[1:01:30] that was had to be that day had to be
[1:01:32] fulfilled. So there had to be a there
[1:01:35] had to be a finishing up. There had to
[1:01:37] be the sons of God had to come. But the
[1:01:39] B said they would have come by the
[1:01:41] spoken word in Eden, but they didn't
[1:01:44] come that way because Adam fell,
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; right? And so now these redeemed sons,
[1:01:49] you and I, are going to be in the
[1:01:52] millennium. Well, what happens during
[1:01:54] the millennium? During the millennium,
[1:01:56] we rule and reign with Christ. So, it's
[1:02:00] the manifestation of sons and it's the
[1:02:03] entire purpose of the thousand-year
[1:02:06] reign is that we would be the manifested
[1:02:09] sons of God.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Let me show it to you. Brother said,
[1:02:12] "See, they're gods, fallen gods. They
[1:02:14] get a domain. The world, they're
[1:02:15] supposed to take care of it. The trees
[1:02:16] and animal life, everything is waiting
[1:02:18] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:02:20] when they'll be manifested on the earth.
[1:02:23] Everything's waiting. Every earthquake
[1:02:24] is because the earth is waiting on us.
[1:02:29] right to put it back in order again.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; The the world is groaning. Every every
[1:02:34] tsunami, every hurricane is waiting on
[1:02:37] the sons of God to be manifested.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; And and so he said they're supposed to
[1:02:43] take care of it. He said, "Oh, come Lord
[1:02:45] Jesus is my prayer." He said, "Oh, that
[1:02:48] great millennium when they'll be
[1:02:50] manifested." He said, "We're getting
[1:02:52] ready now for this time to come. The
[1:02:56] church has got to get ready." Why is
[1:02:58] brother Brandham telling us these
[1:02:59] things? Why did we have to see the
[1:03:00] manifestation of the third pole and the
[1:03:02] spoken word? Why do we see a greater
[1:03:05] move of the Holy Spirit during the time
[1:03:07] of brother Brandham? And even today, we
[1:03:09] see a supernatural working of God. We
[1:03:11] see the vindicated message of the hour.
[1:03:13] Why did he have to do it the way that he
[1:03:15] did it? Because it's time for the
[1:03:17] manifestation of the sons of God. But
[1:03:19] the fullness of that is a millennial
[1:03:21] reign. What does that tell us? We're
[1:03:22] right there at the door. We've got to be
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; because he would not have sent this at
[1:03:27] this time unless it was almost time for
[1:03:30] the sons to be fully manifested.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And right now that manifestation is
[1:03:37] taking place in our souls and even in
[1:03:39] our bodies when it comes to the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost having control. But there will
[1:03:43] come a day when it'll take place in its
[1:03:45] fullness. You understand? You say,
[1:03:47] "Well, I I'm a I'm a full I I have the
[1:03:51] fullness of adoption." Then why do you
[1:03:52] get sick? Come on.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Right. Why Why do you get old?
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; That's not the kind the fullness that I
[1:03:59] want. I want a fullness that actually
[1:04:01] puts me in a new body.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; But we have the word that's taking us to
[1:04:06] that. Are you with me now?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; We're We've already been, as I've said
[1:04:10] before, we've been placed in the roller
[1:04:12] coaster.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; You know, there comes a point of no
[1:04:15] return
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; when you're not in control anymore.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Right. There's a time when you could get
[1:04:21] off if you wanted to, but there comes a
[1:04:23] point of no return. There's a roller
[1:04:25] coaster in Branson that takes off at a
[1:04:27] very fast speed. Some of y'all know what
[1:04:28] I'm talking about. It takes off very
[1:04:30] quick and and when it does, it kind of
[1:04:32] you kind of catch your breath. You know,
[1:04:33] up until that moment, you could say,
[1:04:35] "Hey, wait a minute. Let me off." And
[1:04:36] I've seen people do it, but once it
[1:04:39] takes off, it's gone. And there ain't no
[1:04:41] getting off until it reaches its
[1:04:43] destination. We're already on.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Listen. Don't let Don't let you We
[1:04:50] stress so much about what other people
[1:04:52] are doing.
[1:04:55] We stress so much about what other
[1:04:56] churches are doing, other preachers are
[1:04:58] doing. I do it, too. We stress so much
[1:05:00] about what our own church is doing. We
[1:05:02] stress even about ourselves, about our
[1:05:03] families, and we think, "Oh, you know,
[1:05:05] this one's wrong and this one's wrong
[1:05:07] and that one's wrong." If we could ever
[1:05:08] just get to the fact and realize we've
[1:05:11] already been stepped in. We got a word
[1:05:12] that's taken us home. God's big enough
[1:05:14] to get us bride. Let's just believe him.
[1:05:16] Let's just accept him. Let's just
[1:05:18] manifest him in our own lives.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Instead of worrying about what everybody
[1:05:22] else is doing
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; the word has already been spoken.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to see the
[1:05:29] manifestation of the son of man again.
[1:05:31] It's already been shown. He had to
[1:05:33] speak.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, church. We've been taken to a
[1:05:37] mountain and he spoke in this age.
[1:05:40] Hallelujah.
[1:05:42] God's proven that a a son could speak
[1:05:46] things into existence that weren't even
[1:05:48] there. I believe that ought to give us
[1:05:49] faith for a rapture to speak a body into
[1:05:52] existence one of these days.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; If we really believed it.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Again, brother said, "All
[1:06:00] the world is groaning, waiting for the
[1:06:02] manifestation of the sons of God,
[1:06:06] waiting for the church to get back in
[1:06:07] its place again, sons of God to be made
[1:06:09] manifest.
[1:06:11] waiting for that hour. The church is so
[1:06:13] far away from its place. It needs to be
[1:06:15] back to be sons of God again, rulers,
[1:06:17] governors of the earth under the
[1:06:19] spiritual reign. It will be someday when
[1:06:22] the chief one comes. Jesus Christ, the
[1:06:24] great millennium. Nature is groaning for
[1:06:27] that day. It's groaning for that day.
[1:06:31] Oh, church, I'm ready for that day.
[1:06:35] We are redeemed back
[1:06:38] to reign over the earth. We're we're
[1:06:41] going through what we're going through
[1:06:42] now for a reason
[1:06:44] because we're redeemed back to reign
[1:06:47] over the earth. Revelation 5:9. We just
[1:06:50] read it, I believe, Sunday. But it says
[1:06:51] they sung a new song saying, "Thou art
[1:06:54] worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:06:56] seals. For thouast slain and hast
[1:06:58] redeemed us to God by thy blood out of
[1:07:01] every kindred and tongue and people and
[1:07:03] nation and hast made us
[1:07:06] to our God kings and priests and we
[1:07:09] shall reign on the earth. What caused
[1:07:13] him to know that? It was the opening of
[1:07:16] the seals
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; that caused them to worship under their
[1:07:21] adoption under their under the oh God
[1:07:24] under the reality of of the fullness of
[1:07:27] the word for their day. So, Brother
[1:07:29] Brandham tells us anything that's
[1:07:30] redeemed is something that's been lost.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; It's something that's been lost and then
[1:07:34] it's been brought back again. What does
[1:07:36] he bring back to us? This lamb.
[1:07:38] Everything we had at the beginning.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; What did we have at the beginning?
[1:07:42] Eternal life. We was heirs of the world.
[1:07:45] We had life. We never had to die. We
[1:07:47] never had to be sick.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; We never had to be sick. Aren't you glad
[1:07:54] there's something more
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; than what we have now? Listen, Paul
[1:07:59] said, "If in this life only we have
[1:08:01] hope, we are of all men most miserable."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Right? We're not looking to this world.
[1:08:06] Oh, I hope we start looking away again.
[1:08:09] I I remember, you know, I I I feel like
[1:08:12] an old man saying this, but I remember
[1:08:14] back in the day it seemed like there's a
[1:08:15] lot of songs about heaven and now
[1:08:18] there's a lot of songs about earth. And
[1:08:19] I I like those songs, too. But I think
[1:08:22] maybe we need to sing about heaven again
[1:08:23] and begin to look forward to some
[1:08:25] things. And the reason people sung,
[1:08:27] especially in the depression era in this
[1:08:29] country and and when times were hard
[1:08:31] during the civil war, they sang a lot of
[1:08:33] songs about heaven because the earth was
[1:08:35] so horrible. It was such a terrible
[1:08:37] experience here on the earth. We've
[1:08:39] gotten used to things and it got a
[1:08:41] little bit easier, but it's still hard
[1:08:43] sometimes, isn't it? We still get sick.
[1:08:45] We still get worried sometimes. We our
[1:08:47] minds play tricks on us. We You still
[1:08:50] get old and you can't you you can't stop
[1:08:52] getting older.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Everything you try to do, you just can't
[1:08:57] beat that. You can do plastic surgery
[1:08:59] and everything else. You'd never be able
[1:09:01] to be You can't keep yourself from
[1:09:03] getting older. But we've got there is a
[1:09:05] place where people don't get older.
[1:09:06] There is a place where we never had to
[1:09:08] die. We never had to be sick. We never
[1:09:10] had to get old. I pray that we'd sing
[1:09:12] about that place. We'd we'd pray. We'd
[1:09:15] ask God, "Lord, come quickly. Come
[1:09:17] quickly. We're we're we're going through
[1:09:19] some things. Come quickly. Come Jesus.
[1:09:22] Come as the songs come." We We've been
[1:09:24] waiting so long. Amen. It's time to go
[1:09:27] home.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it's coming
[1:09:30] church. And the story doesn't get old to
[1:09:31] me. I don't care how many years we're
[1:09:34] here. We need to preach it just like
[1:09:36] that. Tomorrow we might step into
[1:09:38] another dimension.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; We never had to be sick. We never had to
[1:09:41] get old. We never had any worries.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; No funerals,
[1:09:47] no graves,
[1:09:49] no evil.
[1:09:51] I think the absence of sin is an
[1:09:52] underrated part of heaven.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Could we say it that way? I don't think
[1:09:59] we realize how much sin bothers us.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And I mean not just us, but the world
[1:10:05] that we live in.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; It vexes even Lord. It vexed his
[1:10:09] righteous soul. Sin vexes us. Not just
[1:10:13] the world's sin, but our own. Many times
[1:10:16] our own disobedience. But there's a
[1:10:18] world where there's no sin. No evil, no
[1:10:21] death, no gray hairs, no stoop
[1:10:22] shoulders, no mourning, no crying. We
[1:10:26] had life eternal. We had the
[1:10:27] jurisdiction over all the earth. We were
[1:10:29] just a god. That's all on the earth.
[1:10:31] Walk about. And if this tree didn't look
[1:10:33] right standing here, we'd say, "Be thou
[1:10:35] plucked up and set over here." And it
[1:10:37] would do it.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, I couldn't even move people in
[1:10:41] the sanctuary if I wanted to.
[1:10:45] I don't want to move anybody. Don't get
[1:10:47] scared. But if I want you to sit in a
[1:10:49] different place, you know that that
[1:10:51] necessarily wouldn't necessarily happen.
[1:10:54] Some of our brothers who've had to seat
[1:10:55] people in meetings know that's the
[1:10:57] truth. We can't always put people where
[1:10:59] we want them, much less trees,
[1:11:03] right? You just can't do that. I got
[1:11:06] some trees I've been talking about
[1:11:07] removing from my yard for years now.
[1:11:11] One of these days I'm going to get
[1:11:12] around to it.
[1:11:15] Why? Because you just can't do that
[1:11:18] here. You can't do that. But we're going
[1:11:20] to a place because that's where we came
[1:11:23] from, right? He said if the winds was
[1:11:25] blowing, we didn't want the winds to
[1:11:27] blow. Say, "Peace, be still."
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; And he do it. And what did he come to
[1:11:32] do? Now look, to redeem all that back to
[1:11:36] us again. Get all that back again.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; And now nature in itself is groaning,
[1:11:43] waiting for what? the manifestations of
[1:11:46] the sons of God for the sons of God to
[1:11:49] be manifested. Now listen here here's
[1:11:52] here's what's important and we have the
[1:11:54] earnest of our salvation. Now
[1:11:58] I love this can take our brother that's
[1:12:01] dying with cancer stand with that little
[1:12:04] breath of redemption. Pray the prayer of
[1:12:06] faith over him that will turn a shadow
[1:12:08] of a man back to a healthy man again.
[1:12:10] What will we do when our full possession
[1:12:13] comes?
[1:12:15] But we've seen what God could do in a
[1:12:17] prayer line. How many have seen what God
[1:12:18] can do in a prayer line? We've seen what
[1:12:20] God could do by laying on of hands.
[1:12:21] We've seen what God could do in a
[1:12:23] meeting. We've seen what God could do in
[1:12:25] a church service. We've seen what God
[1:12:26] could do with this little breath of God
[1:12:28] just by the preaching of the word. He
[1:12:30] said, "Could take our brother with
[1:12:31] cancer and and and pray the prayer of
[1:12:33] faith over him and the cancer would
[1:12:35] leave." He said, "What will we do when
[1:12:37] our full possession comes if we've seen
[1:12:40] what he could do under the earnest? What
[1:12:42] could he do under the fullness of it?
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen what he did in our
[1:12:49] bodies. We've seen what he did in our
[1:12:51] souls. How he changed us, made us new.
[1:12:53] What will we do when our full possession
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; comes?
[1:12:58] Nature knows that. Nature's groaning and
[1:13:00] we're groaning with it. Nature is
[1:13:02] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:13:04] sons of God because nature was cursed
[1:13:07] with its master. when his master was
[1:13:09] cursed the highest and nature fell with
[1:13:11] the master. But when this kinsman
[1:13:13] redeemer come, hallelujah, redeem back
[1:13:16] the man. That's the master over nature.
[1:13:18] And all nature is waiting for the man.
[1:13:22] Master
[1:13:25] and the master is the sons of God that
[1:13:28] was given this earth.
[1:13:30] And now God will have his heavens of
[1:13:32] course. But this was given to man. And
[1:13:35] the kinsman and redeemer come to redeem
[1:13:36] us back to that we lost. When the work
[1:13:39] is finished, we have all things again.
[1:13:41] What kind of all things? We have all
[1:13:43] power. We have eternal life. We have
[1:13:46] eternal health. We have eternal youth.
[1:13:48] We have eternal power. Oh, we're just
[1:13:50] eternal with the eternal. And then we're
[1:13:53] all waiting for that time to come.
[1:13:55] Waiting and groaning and waiting. Look
[1:13:57] at 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and 16. If
[1:14:00] you have your Bible, turn there with me
[1:14:01] before we close.
[1:14:04] 2 Corinthians 4:16. for which cause we
[1:14:06] faint not.
[1:14:08] But though our outward man perish,
[1:14:12] yet the inward man
[1:14:15] is renewed day by day, there's the son
[1:14:17] of God,
[1:14:19] right? And we get looking at the outward
[1:14:20] man and say, "Well, that's not a
[1:14:21] manifestation of the son of God." No,
[1:14:23] the manifestations on the inward man.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; See that the outward man perishes? It's
[1:14:28] got to go to the dust, right? This
[1:14:30] mortality must put on immortality. Yet
[1:14:33] the inward man is renewed day by day.
[1:14:37] For our light affliction,
[1:14:40] which is but for a moment, workketh for
[1:14:43] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[1:14:47] weight of glory.
[1:14:50] So he said, there's a purpose in our
[1:14:52] affliction. While we look not at the
[1:14:54] things which are seen, but at the things
[1:14:57] which are not seen. For the things which
[1:14:59] are seen are temporal, but the things
[1:15:02] which are not seen are eternal.
[1:15:05] Second Corinthians 5:1. You realize the
[1:15:06] chapters are man-made. Right? So the
[1:15:09] chapters in the Bible aren't necessarily
[1:15:12] inspired, but this is a continuation of
[1:15:14] Paul's letter. Look at it. Verse verse
[1:15:17] one. For we know, so he says four, he's
[1:15:20] continuing his thought. For we know that
[1:15:23] if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:15:25] were dissolved, we have a building of
[1:15:28] God and a house not made with heaven
[1:15:30] with hands eternal in the heavens. How
[1:15:34] many believe it today? We already have a
[1:15:37] building of God. So there's a body
[1:15:39] waiting for us. For in this we grown
[1:15:42] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:15:45] with our house which is from heaven. If
[1:15:48] so be that being clothed, we shall not
[1:15:51] be found naked. For we that are in this
[1:15:53] tabernacle do grown, being burdened, not
[1:15:57] for that we would be unclothed, but
[1:15:59] clothed upon that mortality might be
[1:16:02] swallowed up of life. We don't want
[1:16:04] death. We want life. That's what he's
[1:16:07] saying. We're not groaning for death,
[1:16:08] brother JT. We're groaning for life.
[1:16:11] Death's going to come if we live long
[1:16:13] enough,
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; right? But but Oh, God. But we're
[1:16:16] groaning not for death, but for life,
[1:16:18] for a new body. Oh, that we would be
[1:16:21] clothed upon immortality might be
[1:16:23] swallowed up of life. Now, he that hath
[1:16:25] brought us for the self-same thing is
[1:16:27] God with who also hath given us the
[1:16:31] earnest of the spirit. So, do you
[1:16:34] realize what this the spirit is? The
[1:16:36] spirit is the down payment on a new
[1:16:38] body.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul's saying. The spirit is
[1:16:43] the down payment. It's the same thing
[1:16:44] brother Brandon was saying. The spirit
[1:16:46] is the down payment. So the oh the the
[1:16:48] the the new birth is the beginning.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the fullness of our
[1:16:54] adoption, the new body is the ending.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So you've already
[1:17:00] began changing into what you will be.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; So he said, "All creation is groaning,"
[1:17:07] said Paul. "Everything is groaning. Look
[1:17:09] at the trees how they struggle. Look at
[1:17:11] the flowers how they struggle for life.
[1:17:12] Look just for the frost to tear them
[1:17:14] down. Look at the trees how they
[1:17:15] struggle to hold their branches out to
[1:17:17] sing glories unto God. Everything, all
[1:17:18] nature, all animals, all birds, how he
[1:17:20] flies from the enemy quickly. So,
[1:17:22] Brother Brandham identifies the fact
[1:17:24] that the Ryan that a bird tries to get
[1:17:26] away.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Right. If you go up to a bird and and
[1:17:29] you scare it, it flies away. It won't do
[1:17:31] that over there.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; But over here, it's cuz nature is
[1:17:35] groaning.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said he flies away from
[1:17:40] his enemy quickly. Everything groaning.
[1:17:42] And we ourselves said, Paul, we grown
[1:17:45] with them for we are waiting for the
[1:17:47] redemption of our body.
[1:17:50] But now,
[1:17:51] now they did all those years until now.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Now we have the earnest of our
[1:17:58] inheritance.
[1:18:00] Oh my. What do we have?
[1:18:03] What do we have tonight, church? I know
[1:18:04] it's Wednesday night,
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; but what do we have? We have the
[1:18:07] evidence that God lives.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God is with
[1:18:11] us.
[1:18:12] Hallelujah. We have the evidence that
[1:18:15] God has not forsaken us. That we are his
[1:18:17] and he is ours because we in our bodies
[1:18:19] we now tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God
[1:18:22] that cries out. What is that? The spirit
[1:18:24] of adoption that cries out abba father.
[1:18:27] And there's nothing can ever take that
[1:18:29] away. We are anchored in Christ.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Now the trees does not have it. Nature
[1:18:35] does not have it. But yet we are still
[1:18:37] groaning with them. Look the tree don't
[1:18:40] have the earnest. The nature don't have
[1:18:42] the earnest. We have the earnest.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; But yet we are still groaning. What's
[1:18:48] groaning? Our our bodies.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Oh God. He said we are still groaning
[1:18:53] with them. Because as yet we haven't
[1:18:55] received the fullness of our adoption,
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; but we have the earnest of it that we
[1:19:00] were picked up from the things of the
[1:19:01] world and now become sons and daughters
[1:19:03] of God. What kind of people should we
[1:19:06] be? Oh my. When we think of that and
[1:19:09] then in other ages they didn't
[1:19:10] understand that they thought they could
[1:19:12] be saved and then they could be lost.
[1:19:14] But brother Brandon brings in election
[1:19:16] and teaches us election and
[1:19:18] predestination because he said you got
[1:19:20] to know that as a preparation for the
[1:19:22] seals
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; why oh church cuz the seal was going to
[1:19:25] tell you who you are
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; right
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; was going to reveal who you are and we
[1:19:30] have the earnest our spirits groaning
[1:19:32] for the full adoption but now we have
[1:19:33] the earnest of it as we receive the Holy
[1:19:36] Spirit. It is the earnest of our
[1:19:38] complete adoption or complete salvation.
[1:19:40] So don't get discouraged where you're
[1:19:42] at. Don't get discouraged. You say,
[1:19:44] "Well, I haven't come very far." But if
[1:19:45] he's given you his spirit, what was that
[1:19:47] spirit, brother Ryan, that he gave you?
[1:19:49] It was a down payment. He made a down
[1:19:51] payment, an investment in your life that
[1:19:53] said you're going to body's going to be
[1:19:54] changed one day. You're going to come to
[1:19:56] a new body. This world is not your home,
[1:19:59] but you're going to a better place.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:04] waiting for the fullness of adoption.
[1:20:08] He said this will take place when at the
[1:20:10] first resurrection.
[1:20:12] It's
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; when our bodies will be changed from
[1:20:13] these vile creatures that we are and
[1:20:16] we'll have a body like his own glorious
[1:20:18] body.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is and we
[1:20:21] will be like him. Brother Brandon said
[1:20:24] it's just a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:20:25] shadow of what will be.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Right? So what we saw with the prophet
[1:20:29] when he spoke squirrels into existence,
[1:20:30] what you've seen in a minor form in your
[1:20:32] own life as you begin to walk with the
[1:20:34] Lord, what you see now is only a minor
[1:20:38] to what will be.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; When he appears, we appear
[1:20:44] in his likeness.
[1:20:46] He said we will have a body like his. A
[1:20:49] glorious, glorified body.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; I love this. And all the trials and
[1:20:54] struggles of life will fade off into a
[1:20:57] little mist
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; and blow away to never be no more.
[1:21:04] Just you wish you could you could just
[1:21:07] get your troubles gone like that. Just
[1:21:11] just a mist. The high blood pressure,
[1:21:14] the
[1:21:16] struggles with your weight. Some of us
[1:21:18] struggle with our weight. We struggle
[1:21:20] with our kids. Not me. Me, I got perfect
[1:21:22] kids. But everybody else,
[1:21:26] we struggle with our
[1:21:29] with our health.
[1:21:33] Struggle with allergies.
[1:21:36] And I live in probably the allergy hot
[1:21:39] spot of the world. It seems like we do
[1:21:41] in Arkansas. We struggle.
[1:21:44] But that don't mean that don't mean we
[1:21:46] should just make life easier on oursel.
[1:21:48] But what is the struggle? The struggle's
[1:21:49] for a reason.
[1:21:51] It's for a reason. Don't you wish you
[1:21:53] could just blow it away? Well, one day
[1:21:55] it will.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll fade off in a little
[1:21:58] mist and blow away to never be no more."
[1:22:01] He said, "But brother Ben, why do I
[1:22:02] struggle now? Why? Why do I struggle?
[1:22:04] Why do I have to struggle? What's the
[1:22:06] point of it all? Why? Why? If I'm
[1:22:09] predestined, if I'm elected, why do I
[1:22:11] struggle? Musicians, go ahead and come.
[1:22:12] I'm I'm done tonight."
[1:22:15] Why do we struggle? Why do we not have
[1:22:18] the fullness? Now
[1:22:21] in Romans 8:16, we we may have missed
[1:22:24] this part as we read through that
[1:22:26] chapter, but I want to bear down on
[1:22:28] these two verses 16 and 17. The spirit
[1:22:31] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:22:34] that we are the children of God.
[1:22:37] And if children, then heirs, heirs of
[1:22:39] God, joint hes with Christ, if so be
[1:22:44] that we suffer with him, that we may be
[1:22:48] also glorified together.
[1:22:52] See, you can't be an overcomer unless
[1:22:54] there's something to overcome.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "Unless we suffer
[1:22:58] with him, we cannot reign with him."
[1:23:02] Angels will not reign in the millennium.
[1:23:05] Who's going to reign over the earth?
[1:23:07] Sons and daughters of God,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; right? Angels will not reign over there.
[1:23:12] They will not judge the nations. We will
[1:23:15] judge angels.
[1:23:17] Why? Oh. Oh, church. We just realized
[1:23:21] tonight
[1:23:22] you have to suffer to reign.
[1:23:26] The reason for this is that character
[1:23:28] simply is never made without suffering.
[1:23:33] Character is a victory,
[1:23:36] not a gift.
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:40] See, because God could not give you.
[1:23:43] Think about this. Your trials give you
[1:23:46] something that God himself could not
[1:23:47] give you.
[1:23:49] And that's the character to rule. So, he
[1:23:52] gives you trials.
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:55] He allows trials to come your way.
[1:24:01] No wonder. No wonder Peter said, "Count
[1:24:03] it all joy."
[1:24:07] No wonder Paul said, "Praise him always,
[1:24:10] all the time, and all things praise
[1:24:11] him." Why? Because when you this this
[1:24:14] little trial that you're going through,
[1:24:16] the struggle that you're having right
[1:24:17] now is a gift from God. He couldn't gift
[1:24:20] you character. Character is not a gift.
[1:24:27] What do you have to do? We had to put
[1:24:28] you on a free moral agency. Put you down
[1:24:30] here on the earth. Let you make
[1:24:31] decisions. Let you make sometimes wrong
[1:24:34] decisions.
[1:24:37] Let you go through struggle and trial
[1:24:39] and maybe get born a certain way with a
[1:24:42] certain handicap and a certain struggle
[1:24:44] and all your life you struggle with
[1:24:46] that. You say, "Lord, why did I have to
[1:24:47] struggle all of my life with depression?
[1:24:49] Why did I have to struggle with with
[1:24:51] this uh with this kind of outlook on
[1:24:53] life? Why did I have to struggle with
[1:24:55] this this disease or this trouble or or
[1:24:57] my family or something that that that is
[1:25:00] endemic to my my area or something like
[1:25:02] that? Maybe you struggle for work and
[1:25:05] you struggle for those things and really
[1:25:07] what it is is a gift. It's a gift cuz he
[1:25:11] could not give you character. So he gave
[1:25:14] you trials. He allowed you to have
[1:25:16] trials. Character is a victory, not a
[1:25:19] gift. A man without character can't
[1:25:23] reign because power apart from character
[1:25:27] is satanic.
[1:25:30] Oh church, but power with character is
[1:25:34] fit to rule. You see why we had to go
[1:25:38] through the time that we've gone
[1:25:39] through? Why we're here when we think we
[1:25:42] should have went home years ago?
[1:25:44] He's building a character in you and
[1:25:46] building a character in me
[1:25:48] to take us to a better place. Place
[1:25:51] where all of our trials will just
[1:25:54] blow away. Be gone like a mist. I'm
[1:25:57] looking forward to that. Aren't you? Bow
[1:25:59] your heads with me for just a moment.
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:05] or Jesus. Even tonight, I've struggled
[1:26:07] and to preach and I think, Lord, that
[1:26:09] that maybe illustrates better than
[1:26:11] anything,
[1:26:14] Lord, as we struggle in these bodies.
[1:26:18] But God, we know that there's a purpose
[1:26:20] in that struggling. That in our
[1:26:21] struggling is overcoming,
[1:26:24] Lord. And I see
[1:26:26] maybe people that come to the church
[1:26:28] tonight and didn't feel like it. And
[1:26:31] maybe some that
[1:26:33] worked all day and had a hard time
[1:26:35] getting you here,
[1:26:37] Lord. But there's a character in that,
[1:26:39] in that struggle, in that trial, in that
[1:26:41] overcoming. There's a character in that.
[1:26:44] And I I pray you'd help us, Lord, to
[1:26:46] understand that, Lord, not to be weary
[1:26:48] and welloing, but to recognize there's a
[1:26:51] reward for everything that we've gone
[1:26:54] through. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I
[1:26:56] pray Lord that you'd help us to
[1:26:58] understand there's a better place
[1:27:01] a fullness of our adoption that we're
[1:27:03] going to we would not be so satisfied
[1:27:05] with this world Lord not a health wealth
[1:27:09] and prosperity gospels we see taking
[1:27:11] over so many places and so many pulpits
[1:27:14] but Lord it's a it's a gospel of
[1:27:17] suffering but a gospel of overcoming we
[1:27:20] thank you for that Lord we thank you for
[1:27:22] all that you do for us you bless these
[1:27:24] people now ines Jesus name.
[1:27:27] Amen. Thank you Lord. Let's just worship
[1:27:30] him a moment.
[1:27:32] He was there
[1:27:36] all all
[1:27:38] the time.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he was there? Even in
[1:27:43] the struggle waiting faith
[1:27:47] lead
[1:27:50] in life.
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:27:55] Oh, he was there
[1:28:00] all
[1:28:02] the time.
[1:28:04] I'm so glad he was there. He was there.
[1:28:10] He was there all
[1:28:13] all the time. Let's stand together and
[1:28:16] sing it.
[1:28:17] You need prayer. Be glad to pray with
[1:28:19] you tonight.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He was there.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; He was there all
[1:28:25] the time.
[1:28:28] Oh, waiting
[1:28:31] patient
[1:28:37] in life.
[1:28:42] He was there
[1:28:46] all
[1:28:48] the time. Do we know the verses to that?
[1:28:51] Time after time.
[1:28:53] Oh, time after
[1:28:58] time I I went searching
[1:29:03] for peace in some for
[1:29:09] I was trying to blame all my ills. I was
[1:29:13] trying
[1:29:15] to blame all my ills on this world.
[1:29:24] I was in
[1:29:26] surface relationships.
[1:29:29] Oh, surface
[1:29:32] relationships
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:35] used methods used me till I was
[1:29:41] done. All the while someone was begging.
[1:29:45] Hallelujah.
[1:29:47] And all the while
[1:29:52] was begging
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; to save me
[1:29:58] from sin.
[1:30:01] Sing that chorus now. He was
[1:30:07] all
[1:30:10] the time.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, he was there.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, God bless you tonight
[1:30:22] until the time
[1:30:26] waiting

[1:30:42] all
[1:30:45] the time.
[1:30:48] And after all this life is over
[1:30:56] and our burdens
[1:30:58] have been lifted
[1:31:02] and we stand upon
[1:31:06] the mountain top so tall.
[1:31:14] We're looking
[1:31:16] over in that city
[1:31:22] that the Savior
[1:31:24] is preparing.
[1:31:28] It gives me faith that I'm going to make
[1:31:33] it
[1:31:34] after all.
[1:31:37] With all your hearts now. Oh, after all
[1:31:43] this life is over

[1:33:19] all.
