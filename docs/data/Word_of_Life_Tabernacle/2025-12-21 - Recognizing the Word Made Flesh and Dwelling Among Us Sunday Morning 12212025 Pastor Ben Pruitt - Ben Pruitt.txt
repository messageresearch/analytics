How many wants the word to be born in your heart this morning? Amen. Let's start with the chorus if you would. Let your word [singing] be born in the manger of my heart. [singing and music] Let it live in me. Let it [music and singing] start. Live inside this house [music] and mold me [singing] every day. Let [music] your word be born in the manger [singing] of my [music] heart. It was a tiny [singing] simple staple [music] all beaten hardly a place for a king to be [music] born. He didn't choose some place special [singing] to reveal his majesty. [music] So I know if I give [singing] him control, he'll be born in [music] me. Let [singing] your word be born [music] in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. Baby star [music and singing] inside this house and love [music] me [singing] every day. And let your word be born in a manger of my [singing] heart. [music] Well, outwardly I'm nothing. Not much to behold, [singing] unlikely place for his word [singing] to unfold. [music] Unfoul let it have his way. [music] Have his [singing] way. Sorry. Oh, from glory unto glory. [music] He will change me day by [singing] day. Let [music] your word. Oh, sing with all your hearts now, church. [music] Oh, let [singing] it live in me. Oh, let it start. [music] Won't you live inside [singing] this house [music] and hold me every day? Let [singing] your word be born in a manger. Sing the chorus one more time. I wonder if we can stand and [music and singing] sing it now. Oh, let your [music] word be born in a manger. Is that your desire this morning? [music] Let it [singing] live me. Let it start. Oh, [music] let it start [singing] living inside. Oh yes [singing] and more [music] we Oh, let your word be born in a manger of my heart. [singing] Give him one more hand clap of praise this morning. [applause] Let's sing this. He became me so that I could become him. Aren't you thankful he could become flesh so that he could send his spirit and live through us this [music] morning? You know, we know it wasn't maybe this time of year that he was born, but you we worship him every Sunday. We don't come just [music] to every time we come to church, we're worshiping him. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time we come here, it's all about him. [music] &gt;&gt; Every morning when you pray, when you pray and you get down on your knees and pray or you open your Bible, [music] it's all about him. Brother Brandham said he was in every verse of the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Every verse. It's all about him. So this time, you know, when when the world's made it about everything but Christ, I think it's time to remember that there's more about there's more to this thing [music] than just a baby in a manger. There's more to this than, you know, there's more to this than just presents and gifts and [music] things like that. Amen. But it's a time to reflect and remember why we worship who we worship. He was a baby. He lived and he died, but he's come back and he's living inside of every one of us this morning. So if you have his spirit on the inside of you, we ought to be able to worship him like nobody else. The world can't worship like we can worship cuz we know why we're worshiping. Do you believe that this morning? Because he became me, we could become him. Let's sing with all of our hearts as our pastor comes. There will be a baby dedication right [music] after this. Let's sing it now. Oh, I know [singing] that he [music] became me so that I might become him by grace. [singing] Yes, [music] he became [singing] me [music] so that I might become him by grace. [singing] Oh, he [music] took my place so that I through his. [music and singing] Aren't you thankful for it this morning? Yes, we did. Oh, [singing] he became [music] me so that I might become him [singing] by grace. One more time with all your hearts. Sing it like you mean it now. Oh, he [music] became [singing] me so that I might [singing] become [music] in my grave. Sing it now. [singing] Oh, he [music] became me so [music] that I might [singing] become him by [music] grace. [singing] He took my place. Aren't you glad he did? For [music] he took my [singing] place so that I through his love [music] could take his [singing] for he [singing] became me so that I [music] might [singing] become him by my grace. Aren't you glad [music] for grace this morning? Amen. We'll be seated just for a moment and we're going to have a uh dedication [music] little Maya uh it's been dedicated this morning. My sister uh just has a [music] heart for children and the Lord has placed several children in her life and I believe there's something special about this one just as a baby coming into her home. And so we're going to dedicate this baby to the Lord. And especially these babies that come from the foster system, it's hard to [music] know what their future will hold, but we believe that God holds their future. He knows all about them. And [music] so we're just going to have that this morning. Brother Brandham said this about dedications. He said, "What an appropriate time." [music] He said, "When in the manger there was found a baby, a Christmas time for dedication [music] of babies back to God." So thought that was appropriate this morning. if you would come. Let's sing Bring Them In, Brother Joel, if you could do that. &gt;&gt; Jesus. [singing] Oh, [music] bring them in. Bring them [singing] in. Bring them in from the fields of [music and singing] sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the [singing] little ones to Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; I don't think little Ma's afraid of anything. She She just loves to look around. Look at this. See all them people? Yeah, we sure love these little ones. Let's bow our heads together. Heavenly Father, Lord, you you saw Lord before this baby was born. Lord, the need that it would have of a family and a mother, Lord, and you placed it in this family, Lord. I pray that you would just, Lord, that you would just be with this baby. That you would there would be a hedge built around about its life. Lord, as she grows, may she be nurtured in the fear and admonition of the Lord. I pray for this home, Lord, that Becky raises these children, all all three of them. Lord, I I pray, God, that you'd just help her. Lord, we know the struggle of it, but we know that you're her helper. I pray you would do that this morning. Pray you protect the little child from sickness, from things, Lord, that would come quench every fiery dart of the enemy. I pray, Lord, that she would grow to serve you and to be a wonderful part of your kingdom and give her heart to you at the earliest opportunity. Lord, I pray that you grant it. If you, Terry, Lord, may she become a strong Christian, a believer. Pray you grant it, Lord Jesus. Lord, we pray for all of these at this time of year. Lord, these children that Lord, maybe aren't born in the best situation, but Lord, you see them, you know. I pray you'd protect each one. I pray you bless this family. Now, we dedicate little Maya back to the Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Bless you. Let's give her a hand this morning. [applause] All right, that'll be all the singing this morning. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; I want to, if you'll stand with me, I want to read from first John chapter 1. [snorts] It's good to be here. If I haven't mentioned your name this morning, good to see everybody again. We were gone last week and so sometimes when I miss a week and then somebody else has missed a week, it seems like forever since I've seen you, but we sure good to see you this morning. God bless you. If you have any visitors among us, God bless you this morning. Thank you for being with us. 1 John chapter 1 and verse one. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life. For the life was manifested and we have seen it. So there was it wasn't just a story, but there was a baby being held. There was a life that was manifested. There was a a real real man who went to the cross. It was a manifested life. The life was manifested. We have seen it. In other words, the word became flesh. And bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us. And then verse three, that which we have seen and heard, declare [clears throat] we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us. And truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ. I want to also read from St. John. St. John chapter 1 and verse 14. A very familiar scripture. St. John chapter 1 and verse 14. It says, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word this morning. You may be seated. I want to speak to you this morning on the word becoming flesh and dwelling among us. I don't believe there's anything that causes more conflict among message people than Christmas. I don't think that ought to be the case, but it is. And we believe in freedom of conscience. In other words, if someone has a conviction about something, we let them have that conviction. And we don't want to uh ever trespass that because you can make someone sin against their conscience and and it would actually be a sin because it's unbelief. So, [snorts] we don't want to do that. And but what we try to do is treat one another with love and treat one another with respect at all times of the year, not just at Christmas, but all year long. Treat one another with love and respect. We can never go wrong in that way. Just try to help somebody. You know, I I I think people look at it in the world and say, "What can I do to serve the Lord?" Well, try to help people. That would that'd be a good start. Try to help somebody. Don't just be a a hindrance to people, but or a stumbling block. Be a stepping stone to help somebody. And I think there's, Brother Brandham said, as long as it's good for suffering humanity, he said it's of the Lord. And I believe that ought to be what we try to do. And yet, as the bride of Christ, we're called to even a higher walk. We believe we're going to be his bride. That we are his bride. And so, we have to stay with the word. So, we try to stay just as close to the revealed word of the hour as we can. We believe that the Bible is the word of God. How many believe that today that it's the word of God from cover to cover as brother Joel already said this morning. We believe that uh you can find Christ in every verse of the scripture. Brother Brandon said if you don't find Christ in every verse, he said then go back and read it again. &gt;&gt; So we believe that the Bible is the absolute word of God. We believe that in that Bible it tells us that there would come an Elijah that would come and restore the heart of the children back to the faith of the fathers. So we believe that we are living in that time with that evening light and we've seen that prophet come. And so what we have is the ability to look at what a prophet said and what a prophet did and be able to see how should we act in the world that we live in today where everybody's gone crazy and you can't find an absolute anywhere. But God allowed us to see what his word was all about in in the words of a prophet and and and and make it clear to us in this day. Not to write a new Bible but to make it clear to us so we could o it could be open to us to understand. In 1961 in a sermon titled Christianity versus idolatry, brother Brandon made this statement he [snorts] said studying on mythology and all these myths. Christmas itself is a myth. He said nothing real about Christmas. Christmas wasn't even mentioned in the Bible. They never worshiped the birthday of Christ. Wasn't no such a thing. He said that's a Roman Catholic dogma, not a Christian teaching. No scripture for it nowhere in the Bible. And for the first hundred years after the Bible see nothing of it. It's just a myth. He said Santa Claus commercial everything. the whole thing has wound up into a big conglomeration. And boy, it got quiet. &gt;&gt; But that's the truth, &gt;&gt; right? We believe that. We know that to be the truth. Now, the next week, Brother Brandon preached a sermon that was in uh on December 17th, 1961, Christianity versus idolatry. The next week, Brother Brandon preaches a Christmas message titled, "Sir, we would see Jesus." &gt;&gt; And he says this. He said, "Yet at Christmas, you know, little kitties, you can't tell them no different." He said, "It's just Christmas time for them." He said, "And they wouldn't have their little sock come up, sock hung up, there would be something." So he said, "If they didn't have a sock hung up, there would be something." He said, "It's a tradition." Even in our nation, they hang up a sock and something another. He said, "Why I did when I was a kid?" And although as far off the scripture beaten path as it is, kids are they hear the other kids say, "Well, I got this for Christmas. I got this little fell stand around. Look, you know, he said you can't make them understand, so just Christmas is here to stay. Now, now, how do you justify that with what he already said? I I think that he's doing the same thing Paul did when he talked about uh things that were sacrificed, food that was sacrificed to idols. Paul makes a remarkable statement in Romans chapter 14 and verse 5. He's talking also about those who observe one day above another. Talking about those who observe feast days, Jewish feast days, those who did not. He said, "One man esteemth one day above another, another esteemth every day alike." He said, "Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." &gt;&gt; Could we be Christian enough to do that today? And when it comes to Christmas, I'm going somewhere. This has something to do with what I'm preaching. So, I just want to lay this in before we go any further. He said, "He that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that regardeth not the day to the Lord he does not regard it. He that eateth eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks. And he that eateth not to the Lord he eateth not and giveth God thanks. So we said there's uh some observe and some do not but we give God thanks anyway. So whether or not you observe the birth of Jesus on Christmas as brother Brandham did or but it has nothing to do with your salvation. The just live by faith alone. &gt;&gt; Right? We're not saved by Christmas. &gt;&gt; Come on. We're not saved by whether how many gifts we got or whether we didn't get any or whether we how we did it or whether we hung things up uh lights on our house. We're not saved by that. We're not Christians because we serve Christmas. We're Christians because we've been born again, &gt;&gt; because we have a new birth, something in our heart. And and that ought to make all the difference. We ought to have a love one for another because of our new birth. Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, just a few minutes after saying what we just read, he said this. He said, "Let me make this clear. I do not believe Jesus would care what day you worshiped his birthday on if it's the 25th, 26th, whether it's April, May, June, July, or whenever it might be just so you worship. He said you worship him on any day. But here's what it is. They've taken the sacredness from Christmas to make it not a Christmas. He said a worship day, but a celebration. See, we you hear people say, "We're going to celebrate Christmas." He said, "That's wrong. We should never celebrate Christmas." Christmas is a day of worship, not a celebration. So, brother Brandham takes that and if you study the message and this week I went back and refreshed myself. I read every quote brother Brandham said anything about Christmas and I've got them all on a file if you if you want to have them sometime. But but if you go and look at it, brother Brandham is always pointing us to he said if there's something negative during Christmas time, he said there must be something positive during that time. &gt;&gt; He said the light shines the greatest in the darkest place. &gt;&gt; Right? So what are we doing today? And and I wanted as I preach my Christmas sermon today, what are we doing today? We are letting the light shine in a very dark time when all the tinsel of the world has taken over. But we want to recognize that he was born, but he didn't stay a baby. He grew up to die for my sin. And and and he didn't stay on the cross either, but he raised again on the third day. And he's living in my heart right now. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said it should not be a celebration. He said, "But the birthday of Christ, I believe should be a day of consecration worship." He said, "Instead of tonight of people at church on their knees praying, thanking God for the real Christmas gifts, I think it's appropriate for us to have church today at Christmas time." Why did brother Brandham observe Christmas on as a day to remember the birth of Christ? Because we know brother Jesus wasn't born on December 25th, &gt;&gt; but he said light shines best in darkness. He said, "This Christmas ought to be an outstanding thing." He said, "We Christians ought, no matter how much it looks, it'll make it shine that much better." He said, "The whole world's got tinsel. We've got Christ." &gt;&gt; And that's what we ought to be letting shine in this dark hour that we're now living in. &gt;&gt; When Brother Brandham from 1957 to 1963, and this is going to lead into what I want to say this morning, preaching, but brother Brandham was at home every year from 1957 to 1963. and preached a Christmas message at the tabernacle. In 1964, he preached a Christmas message in Phoenix. In 1965, he was on his way home, but he had already told us what he was planning to preach. He said why it had to be wise men. And I've heard people say, "Well, brother Brandham did that, but we shouldn't do what we should do what brother Brandham said, not what he did." Well, if we apply that, we make Brother Brandham a hypocrite and a Pharisee. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this. He said, "You've known me long enough. I hope I've lived before you to show show you I'm honest and sincere. I'm not a hypocrite. Even my critics don't say that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. He said, "My critics say I'm wrong, but they don't say I'm a hypocrite." I pray we could live that way. &gt;&gt; Lord, let the word become so flesh in my heart that even my critics would say, "Well, he's not a hypocrite." &gt;&gt; He lives what he preaches. &gt;&gt; You realize that's why there's scriptural qualifications for a pastor in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1. Because a pastor doesn't just preach a sermon, he lives his sermon. &gt;&gt; But that's true for all of us. Brother Brandham said, "If you're a preacher, get you a pulpit and preach." &gt;&gt; He said, "But if you're not a preacher," he said, "don't try to be a preacher, but live your message." He said, "Oh, how Jeffersonville needs thousands of lived voices." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what we need today. Not just a baby in a manger, but lived voices. We We need to see the word becoming flesh. Let it become flesh in our homes. Let it become flesh in our community. Let it become flesh all around us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we need is the word to become flesh. &gt;&gt; See, you you would and rightfully so. If I did not live what I preached and you knew about it, you'd either quit coming to church here or vote me out. &gt;&gt; Right? Because because I would be a fraud, &gt;&gt; a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; I got to live what I preach. I I make mistakes. I'm human. But I live what I preach &gt;&gt; to the best of my ability as a human. as a human being. A pastor is supposed to live his sermon and preach it. A a prophet does the same thing. A and Brother Brandham taught us that a prophet is a divine interpreter of the word. But he don't just interpret that in his preaching, but even in the way that he lives, the way God deals with him. He's not God. A prophet's not God. How many know that he makes mistakes? He's human, but he says, "Follow me as I follow Christ." That's right. &gt;&gt; And he even come to uh with Moses when uh when when Moses made mistakes, but he was God's man. And brother Brandon said God backed him up even in his mistakes. &gt;&gt; But he said Joshua could have confidence because he said as I was with Moses, so I will be with you and he looked at Moses mistakes. I'm glad that God didn't call an angel a literal angel to come in this day. But he called an earthly angel a messenger that that was a human being and made mistakes. I'm so glad that Jesus didn't come as an angel, but he come as a man. He was a high priest that could be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. Aren't you glad for that today? No matter what you're going through, no matter what's going on in your life here at this time of year, it may be a dark time of year. I know for some people that Christmas time of year is a very dark, depressing time of year because of things that they've been through or people that they've lost. But I'll say today, there's a comforter here for you. There's a God who knows what it's like to be lonely. He knows what it's like to be alone. He knows what it's like to be weary. And he says, "I've come to comfort you today." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If a man walks in sin, we're not supposed to follow him. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Philippians 3:17, "Brethren, be followers together of me. And mark them which walk so as you have us for an example." So other words, they live like we live. For many walk of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things for our conversation. That word conversation is lifestyle. Our manner of life is in heaven. &gt;&gt; From whence also we look for the savior, Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like his glorious body according to the working whereby he's able even to subdue all things unto himself. What is he saying? We we don't just let it be stay word, but the word has to become flesh. &gt;&gt; You see where I'm going now, brother Brandham? It is not just that he preached one thing and did another, but he actually lived what he was preaching, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Why didn't the religious scholars of that day? As we turn our minds now towards my Christmas sermon with that now as a background, a foundation for what we want to say. Why didn't the religious scholars of the day recognize the word made flesh? &gt;&gt; Why couldn't they see it? &gt;&gt; You know, he fulfilled every scripture. Yes. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. Mary was a virgin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He'd be born in Bethlehem. He was born in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; All the scriptures that were written of him, he fulfilled that. But they couldn't see who he was. And the reason they couldn't see it is because of tradition. And many times the thing that keeps us from revelation in our life is our own tradition that we've added to the word that we actually we actually though we're well taught. But this was the most well-taught generation of Jews that had ever lived. They were a people who who dotted their eyes and crossed their tees and they were they were the most legalistic of the legalists. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. In that day, they had everything going the way they thought it should go. But you don't listen to me. You don't serve God by legalism. Brother said, "I don't serve God legally. I don't come here legally." &gt;&gt; Listen, if I was if I was just just depending on the works of the flesh to make it in, I'd never make it in. But I live the way I do because of his grace in my life. Because he saved me. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul said. By the grace of God, I am that what I am. He said, "But I labor more abundantly than you all." He said, "Because grace has been shown to me." Well, I pray that we could live like that. That grace would be shown in our lives. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Grace for others, grace for ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that ought to make us want to serve him even more. They were the most well-taught generation of Jews &gt;&gt; that had ever lived. &gt;&gt; Generation after generation of Jewish people had gone into idolatry and paganism, but thieves didn't. But see, Satan has a way. If he can't get you to go up into paganism, he'll get you to go the other direction &gt;&gt; into legalism. &gt;&gt; Right? So what he did is what they did is they began to begin to preach a nationalistic gospel and during the time between the time that Malachi came and the last prophet that they had it was a period of 400 years where they didn't have a prophet and so they had great teachers during that time. One by the name of Hel was a great teacher whose teaching was that you had to follow both the written law and the oral law. So it wasn't just what was written but what was actually said by them or done by the Jews. He basically made tradition carry the same weight as scripture. He was one of the founding teachers of the Pharisees. That's the time that the Pharisee uh cult as it was came into existence was during that time. And and the Pharisees unlike the Sadducees they believed in in divine revelation. They believed in the oral law. The the Sadducees believed just in the written law the letter of the law. But the Pharisees are the founders of modern rebbitic Jew Judaism. It's they were actually the people who had it right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the way that the Jews are today. And and that's God's chosen people. But they couldn't see the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The very word they were taught in. &gt;&gt; See, the Sadducees weren't looking for a Messiah, but the Pharisees were. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were the Pentecostals of their day. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. They were the closest thing to the real. And in fact Jesus in Matthew 23, Jesus spoke to the multitude and to his disciples saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. So he so he said they have that office. He said therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do. You realize what people are doing when they say brother Random didn't live what he preached. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They're making him a Pharisee &gt;&gt; because Jesus said that observe and do. He said what whatever they did you observe that observe and do. But do not ye after their works. For they say and do not. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born. Lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. Other words, they tell people to do things they won't do themselves. &gt;&gt; It's phariseism. &gt;&gt; And they didn't recognize him. Simon didn't recognize him when he was invited to his own house. Didn't recognize him. And you all know the story, but a little woman that was of real fame, she recognized him when he come in. Well, I pray we could be like that little woman today. We could recognize him when he comes. We could we could bow before his presence. We could worship him when he comes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But but Jesus said they made the word of God of none effect. He said through your tradition which you have delivered and many such like things do ye. They built a framework of tradition for the word so that could only be seen a certain way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were a generation of Jews that were looking for a Messiah. Oh, we we think that the Jews had been subjugated by the Romans for many many years, but that's actually not true. They had actually only been under Roman uh under Roman control for about 40 years. &gt;&gt; So, they could remember when they were free. They could remember, the elders could remember when when they had had their own nation through the the I don't know if I'm pronouncing right, but the Hasmonian kings and and the high priest was the king for a while through the Mcabes and some of those they they remembered what freedom was like. And so they they they they believed they thought that oh that you know here's Messiah's going to come and take us back to that and he's going to overthrow these Romans. said they had it all worked out how it was going to happen. &gt;&gt; Just like some of us how it have it all worked out how the rapture is going to happen. Huh? We got it all figured out what exactly is going to happen and when it comes I wonder if we'll even recognize why what you know you want me to say something. Brother Brandon said the rapture is already in you. &gt;&gt; It's already started. It's already began. He said he said he would descend with a shout and he said a shout was a message. &gt;&gt; Well, we got it all figured out how it's going to happen. They had it all figured out how was going to happen. But we don't want to miss the word becoming flesh. The word being more than just a written letter, but the word becoming something you actually do. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Worship can be just something we say. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; A lot of people will talk about worship. Oh, we want worship, man. We want worship. We want to be in a church that's on fire. And you know, and they get to worship time and they just barely Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; barely able to get a hand up. Barely &gt;&gt; able to make it. It's hot up here. I don't know if it is out there or not, but they just barely able to. Maybe if we sweat a little bit, it'll cool us off. But but uh you know, just you say they talk about worship. It's easy to talk about. It's easy to say, "I want to be in a church that's on fire." But how much prayer do we actually put in? &gt;&gt; Right? How much time do we actually put into having a church be on fire? I believe we are on fire, but how many how many time how much time do we put in making sure it stays that way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Because we can talk about it, but let the word become flesh this morning. The word wasn't meant to be just an idea. This message was never meant to be just something people say, a word stories people tell about a prophet. It wasn't meant to stay just on paper. It was meant to be lived by preachers, lived by evangelists and pastors, lived by the leoty, lived by every one of you, every one of us. &gt;&gt; We don't want to make the word of God of none effect by tradition. But let's make the word live. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, Herod knew enough about it that he recognized the Messiah as a threat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In Matthew 2:1 it says, "When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, where is he that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him?" And when Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet, thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." Then Herod, when you had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared? And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go search diligently for the young child. And when you found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also." He didn't want to worship him. He wanted to kill him. &gt;&gt; But he recognized him as a threat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But he didn't recognize, he couldn't see the word becoming flesh &gt;&gt; and bow down before him, though the wise men did. See, the only ones who recognized him during that time were those who had a personal revelation of who he was. &gt;&gt; See, he had to tell Joseph in a dream because there was no prophet in the land. So, brother Brand say, he did it in a secondary way. He showed him in a dream. He had to he had to give a revelation to Simeon and a revelation to Anna. Oh my. That they would see him at the temple. It it was he come to shepherds and and the angels actually come down and showed them where he was. Oh my. Told him where he was and they saw the heavenly host and the wise men come following the star. two years they come across from the east and coming to to find him so they could worship the young child there in Bethlehem. And did you notice brother Brandham said in the coming of the Lord those who really received him he said it was Simeon never no never heard anybody nothing about him but he was looking for the Lord blind Anna in the temple John the Baptist in the wilderness &gt;&gt; he said John went in the wilderness at 9 years old never appeared again till he was 30 in the wilderness and men like that who secretly believed and kept humble they was looking for the coming of the Lord but why were those who were so well taught taught so ignorant. &gt;&gt; It's not how much you read, it's how it applies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've been working real hard on preaching, you know, and and and and and the way that we talk to our young people and stuff because we want it to apply. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We want it to make sense. We wanted to you to be able to live it, not just to be an idea that you could tell us what the seals are, the thunders or something like that, but what what what what does the word mean to you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. How does it affect you? How does it take flesh? &gt;&gt; Right? How does it become flesh in the way you deal with your parents? How does it become flesh in the way you deal with your children? How does it become flesh in the way we congregate together, in the way that we love one another, in the way that we in the way that we worship, in everything about our lives? How does the word become flesh? That's what we want to see. Not just the word in letter form, but the word in life form. Now, why were they so ignorant? Well, there was no prophet there at that time. Remember, he had to show Joseph in a dream because there was no prophet. That's why the Jews got so far off during that 400 years. They got so far away from God. Even though they thought they were getting closer to him, &gt;&gt; but by their traditions, they were making the word of God of no effect. &gt;&gt; Right? They got so far off of from God that they didn't even recognize him when he come. &gt;&gt; And why? Because God had to bring a prophet. And Amos 3:7, he said, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret to his servant servants the prophets." He said then a prophet means not only to speak the word but also to foretell and a divine interpreter of the word. The divine word written the word come to the prophet. So the prophet is the interpreter of the word. So there had to be a prophet come John the Baptist right? You realize John and Jesus were born within six months of each other. &gt;&gt; So you would think that well you don't nearly need both. But you couldn't see Jesus unless you first got pointed to him &gt;&gt; by a revelation. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; So it had to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Oh my. That was revealed by a prophet. &gt;&gt; And they could not see him. You realize Jesus had no disciples until John pointed at him &gt;&gt; and told him who he was. And yet every detail of his life of Jesus birth and life was foretold in scripture. Yet they could not see it. They knew what Isaiah said, "A virgin shall conceive." And they were looking for it to happen. &gt;&gt; But when a virgin did conceive, they said, "That's not her." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's not him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? When he did signs and wonders and miracles and did exactly what the word said he would do and said, "This day this scripture is fulfilled," they stood there and said, "This is Joseph's son." &gt;&gt; Yes. They couldn't see that Jesus was the fulfillment of that prophecy. Are you with me this morning? Aren't you glad for Isaac can see Jesus rejoiced in his spirit and he said, "I thank thee, Father." He said that you've hid these things from the wise and the prudent and revealed them to babes. Oh, I feel like a baby this morning in learning. I feel like I don't know hardly nothing, but I know I've had something revealed to me. He hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent. But he sent Elijah to turn my heart back to open up the word to me so I could see the word when it was made flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, the word come to the prophet. The word didn't come to Hel. The word didn't come to them during the 400 years. The word come to the prophets. The word didn't come to Caiaphas even though he prophesied and and different things but the word the interpretation the divine interpreter of the word was John. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So Jesus had no disciples until John identified him. Look at John 1:29. It says the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and sayith behold the lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Oh my takes away the sin of the world. He didn't stop there, but every day once he got the revelation of who he was, he stood there. He said, he said, "There he is." Then again, the next day, verse 35, after John stood in two of his disciples, so he's got disciples, got people in his church looking to him as a leader. And he looks at him and he says, "You need to follow him." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. Don't you realize that's the same thing that happened in our day that brother Brandham stood there and said, "You need to follow him." Yeah, &gt;&gt; you need to follow Christ. What was it? A voice crying in the wilderness, in a wilderness of dogmas and creeds and and pagan ceremonies and everything else. A voice stood there and said and said, "I'm going to I'm going to He lived what he preached, but he said, "I'm going to preach the word to you to help you understand this is him. Don't look at denomination. Don't look at all the ceremony things. Look at me." He said, "Look at the word. Look at Christ. Look away from even from the flesh of the prophet and look at Christ." Are you with me now? [snorts] &gt;&gt; So John stood there and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, "Behold the lamb of God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I love this next verse because this is the story of my life. The Bible says the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus. &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet speak and that's why I believe what I believe. I've told people before, I don't preach in spite of the message. I preach because of the message. &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet when I was a young boy, and thankfully I was in a grew up in a home. Some of y'all ought to be thankful that you grew up in a home that taught you the message of the hour. I heard a prophet preach when I was a young boy. I heard him on tape and and and that voice, there was something about it that pointed me not to itself, but to point me to Christ. &gt;&gt; The disciples heard him speak. Who? John. But they didn't follow him. They followed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now I believe we follow Jesus. We follow Jesus. We follow brother Brandham as he followed Jesus because he was following Jesus. &gt;&gt; He didn't walk in a different manner, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And Jesus did. &gt;&gt; Look, they couldn't see it until John identified it. It was hid from the public. You see that seventh seal? How that works? I know maybe above some of our heads, but brother Brandon said if you go back you that listen to tapes, he said it was hid from the public. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. It John's who Christ was was hid from the public. But the hour arrived that the book was open. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we see Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Today our traditions have hit him just like their traditions did. But at the darkest night, I wonder today, can you see the light shining? This morning as we It's a beautiful day outside, but there's a lot of darkness in the world. Gross darkness is covering the people. But he said at evening time, there would be light. Can you see the light at the end time? This message is not a drudgery. It's not a book of dos and don'ts. But what is it? It's a it's a breaking of revelation. Just like John's message was, behold the lamb [screaming] of God that takes away the sins of the world. Behold the lamb of God that you can worship with. Behold the lamb of God. You can be a bride, too. Behold the lamb of God who takes away every sin. &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad for him this morning? Aren't you glad to be one of his bride? Aren't you glad to have heard the voice of a prophet, I heard his voice, but I followed the lamb. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother said as the first forerunner came from the wilderness and cried behold the lamb of God. He said the second forerunner will probably do the same when brother retells this in the church book. He said no doubt do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Something's been born in this hour. It wasn't a baby in a manger, but it was an infant bride on the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the appearing of Jesus screaming. Hallelujah. Oh, what are we going to be screaming, church? He said, screaming, "Behold the lamb of God will come forth from his lips." What? How does the bride scream that? You said, "Well, that's brother Brandham's job." No, we say what a messenger said. If he said, "Behold the lamb of God," he then we say, "Behold the lamb of God." He said, "The seventh angel messenger said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." will not behold my Methodist, my Baptist, my Pentecostal, but the word, the son of God, the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; For no other foundations is there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We don't worship, brother Brandon. We worship Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And all of his power, but a prophet's message pointed us to Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen, we don't we don't brother's not our inter intermediary. He was the groomsman, &gt;&gt; the best man, &gt;&gt; the mighty prophet &gt;&gt; that come and handed us off &gt;&gt; to the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; The word. I'm so glad that he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] Hallelujah. Why couldn't they see it? They needed their prejudices stripped away. &gt;&gt; They needed to be washed by the word of a prophet. Why do we have so much conflict and controversy? Because there's there's quotes people can't Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; There's scriptures they can't back. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Because it would mess with their idea. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Or the way that they live, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; When the kids were young, uh, younger, every time, you know, they get kind of rowdy. A few times I did this. we'd get together and you know have family prayer and I'd tell them now today we're going to pray or we're going to read Ephesians 6 can't remember the verse but it's the one where it says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right [laughter] they got a little older and they realized what the rest of that said they they said read a little further fathers provoke not your children to wrath [laughter] but but what is it it's got to become. Now, think about it. If you have a problem with that, the problem's not with the word, unless it's a very simple thing. But if your kids have a problem with hearing that preached, children should obey their parents. The problem's not with the verse. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The problem's with us, &gt;&gt; we should be able to take any scripture of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes. If our teaching doesn't align with something Brother Brandham said, we don't just throw out what he said. Come on. If it don't align with the scripture, we don't just throw out the scripture. We realize brother Brandham had a progressive revelation and things, but when we see something Brother Brandham taught over his entire life, his entire ministry, we don't throw that out. How dare we do that? &gt;&gt; He was pointing us to Christ to throw out the word. To throw out his ministry is to throw out our our direction to Christ. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we want to find Christ. We want to live with Christ. We want him to live in us. &gt;&gt; So, we want the word to live. We want the word to be made flesh. So, if you got a problem, a woman cuts her hair and and and she don't want to hear that scripture in first Corinthians where it says a woman shouldn't cut her hair. Why? Because she's doing it. &gt;&gt; Right? If you sisters, I don't mean to make this about this today, but it just comes to my heart. A few scriptures if you sisters dress in a way and and the preacher is preaching the word, not his own opinions, but the word. Right? And it bothers you to hear it preached. &gt;&gt; The problem's not with the word. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; As brothers, if it bothers us to hear about how a man should be and what a man should do, the problem is not with the word. &gt;&gt; The word has to become flesh. &gt;&gt; See, this was God's great gift. And the people needed to be washed by the water of the word that a prophet spoke to be able to see it and recognize it. &gt;&gt; Oh church, can you see that the bride today is God's great gift? &gt;&gt; And the and we need to be washed so we can recognize one another. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; So we don't spend all our time fighting and fussing and feuding. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We must recognize the word made flesh and dwelling among us. This was God's greatest gift. And all they could do was see the wrapping that it came in. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He was God's wrapped gift. Brother Rand preached that to us in John 4:10. He he he told the woman at the well, "If you knew the gift of God, you would ask me for a drink." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. If you knew the gift, hang with me for just a few more minutes and we'll get you to dinner. But look, they could not receive it because they thought more of their creeds than they did of the gift. He said, "That's the way it is today. People can't accept speaking with tongues in their church. It would ruin their creed. They can't accept divine healing, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and such great evangelical doctrines of the Bible, apostolic truths." Why? Because their creed condemns it. And brother Brandham illustrates that. Excuse the expression, but this is the way he put it. He said the took the wrapping paper instead of the gift. &gt;&gt; He said that's what Simon Pharisee did. He took the wrapping paper instead of the gift. He said foolish Pharisee. &gt;&gt; That's what he called him. &gt;&gt; Who [snorts] took the wrapping paper instead of the gift. &gt;&gt; You can you see the gift today? I know it's in flesh. I know the bride sometimes does things that people don't recognize and say, "Well, you know, they must not be bride cuz they they made a mistake or something like that." But can you look past the humanity of it? Can you look past it being in Hardy, Arkansas? Can you look past what God's what's going on around it and and and tear off the wrapping paper and look inside? There's some people there who love the Lord with all of their heart, who believe the message of the hour, who are doing their best to serve him, who are going in a rapture one day. Are you with me? It's not a maybe, but it's a it's it's a it's a certain thing. There is a people who are going to go and it won't be based on on their own works. It'll be based on election from before time ever began. They were called to go and they're going. There will be a people leave the earth. But the Brandon said, "If it wasn't for he said predestination, I'd be a very discouraged man." I'll say this because of predestination. I am not discouraged today. I believe God does have a bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. good &gt;&gt; said they couldn't see it because their creed condemns it. &gt;&gt; So [snorts] they can't fellowship with people because well I have a creed about this so I can't fellowship with that. Better make sure it's the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said he's rejected as much today as he was then. [snorts] This Christmas night he's just as much rejected as he was the first Christmas night. He said they cannot do it because it disagrees with their creeds. All down through the ages, we've had the same thing. He talked about how there was no room for him at the end. Oh, church. [snorts] Whenever Brother Brandon preached a Christmas sermon, he'd say something like this. He said, "I want to dramatize this so the kids would understand." So, I kind of want to do that this morning, you know, with the inkeeper. Brother Brandon said they brother the Brandon said Joseph fed his fed that donkey real well because he said that Mary was heavy. &gt;&gt; She was great with child. So he fed his donkey real well the night before. He said they to went by the on the road down to the city of Bethlehem where he was born and she'd been in pain all day. that he'd come down there in the dust of the wagons. People who could travel faster than they could got all over them. They were going down towards Bethlehem. He said they come down there, got to a certain spot and there was a he said there was a the stars come out and and Joseph noticed it. He said he he said he looked he saw that star. He said, "Mary, did you see that?" When he turned to look at her, the star was shining in her black eyes. He said, he said that as they went down into into Bethlehem, he said they knocked on the door of the inn and they come down the inkeeper opened it up and and listen to him looked like a bunch of dusty, dirty travelers, more people to bother with, &gt;&gt; but it was it was God condescending. Amen. &gt;&gt; If he had known it was a king, be king, he'd have thrown open his house, &gt;&gt; put all them publicans and everybody out on the on the straw tick and let the baby have a room. &gt;&gt; But he didn't recognize who it is who it was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he treated them in in a manner. He said, "Well, there's all there is is a stable, but that's good enough for God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. just a just a cave in the side of the hill. Now, we know again this didn't happen on on December 25th, but it did happen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the inkeeper missed the birth of Christ. &gt;&gt; He probably went back in, put his took his slippers off, put his feet up, and said, "I made some money tonight." Amen. &gt;&gt; Stuck his belly out there, you know, and stuck his toes towards the fire and said, "Boy, I showed them not going to overburden myself this night." Oh, church. &gt;&gt; How many times do we come to the house of God &gt;&gt; and the knock comes at the door? He wants to become flesh. He wants to live in our hearts. &gt;&gt; We sit back and say, "Well, it don't fit with my creed." &gt;&gt; Come on. How many times will we have an opportunity to go to church with me with with people who love the Lord and and but we can't do it. That's not our creed. So and so hurt my feelings. &gt;&gt; I got hurt. I got &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; God, let me let the word in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No matter what anybody else does, no matter what it's wrapped in, let me let the word in. Let me open the door of my home for the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He missed the birth of Christ. Because listen to me now, he didn't have room in his busy home &gt;&gt; for a birth. &gt;&gt; Let me let that sink in for a minute. &gt;&gt; Our homes get busy. &gt;&gt; We get busy with work. We get busy with everything else. But he wants to get you in an atmosphere that you could be born in. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many people have missed the birth of the word because they were just too busy? &gt;&gt; They didn't have room &gt;&gt; after everything else that was going on around Christmas &gt;&gt; to let him in. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Young people, don't do that. &gt;&gt; Don't do that. Don't get so busy. I want you to do well in school. I want you to do well I want I want you to have a family. I want you to have a wife or a husband if you if the Lord carries. Not right now. If the Lord carries, I want that for you. I I I want I want you to grow up in the fear and admonition of the Lord, but you you're going to get busy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't spend all your time on your schoolwork. Don't spend all your time on your on your vacation. Don't spend all your time dreaming about that new car or that boy or that girl. Give him a little room. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give him a little time at the beginning of your day. Give him a little time and say, "I know this is simple, church, but if we could just receive it this morning, if we could just receive him, let the word become flesh and the the word has to have a room to become flesh in. &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are so jumbled up and you're not so thinking. I know people come to church and they come and they don't even think about church. They don't even think about the Lord. They're just thinking about what's going on at home, what they have to deal with on them. This Satan will bring everything to their mind and try to bring something. Some of you are thinking about your lost children. You're thinking about this and that. If you'd think about him, maybe your children begin to come back. If you'd think about him, maybe your healing would come. &gt;&gt; There was a king of glory. &gt;&gt; No room. How many times the word preached? People are too busy to go hear it or to turn on a tape or to read their Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Too busy. &gt;&gt; They went on about their business. But the word was born that night. &gt;&gt; Brotherson was wrapped as a gift as a gift from God. Sent from God. A God that they didn't know nothing about. They claimed they did. And they claimed they was looking for him, but he did not come in the way that they thought he was coming according to their creeds. And they could not receive God's gift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was wrapped different. He was wrapped up like a baby. He was born in a manger. He come from poor people. He come from a bunch of fanatics. So how could they receive something like that? No wonder there was no room for him in the end. There's no room in our religious circles today. He said for a Holy Ghost meeting. &gt;&gt; They don't want it. It belittles them in the sight of the classes of the country. &gt;&gt; Oh, but I say I want to give him room this morning. It belittles them to think they humble themselves to come down to an altar to cry and to tar there until they're filled with power from on high to rise up from there with newness of life. To let women let their hair grow out, act like women ought to make men throw away their cigarettes, quit their drinking, treat their fancy. The word has to become flesh. &gt;&gt; It's too much for them. So they hold on to their creed of their church instead of receiving God's Christmas gift. &gt;&gt; He was wrapped in a dirty cloth, a swaddling cloth. He's wrapped today in the same thing which they call holy roller fanaticism. Bunch of heretics. It's wrapped up in swaddling cloth. And the world don't want it. Oh, I pray that we want it this morning. Oh, I'll serve God if I have time. I'll serve God if it don't get in the way of my job. I'll serve God if it don't get in the way of my my my sports. I'll serve God if it don't get in the way of this, that, or the other. I say we ought to serve him at this time of year and every time of year. Do we realize what it is? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you had all the money you would ever need to live on waiting on you at home, &gt;&gt; all you had to do was open up your door to get it. You would find time. Everything you would ever need to make it in life just plop down in front of you. For me, that's like $20,000. You know, some of you that's millions, you know, but no, like you think, oh, I could get out of debt. I could drive a new car. I could buy a new house. Have money to make it. I wouldn't have to work. I could spend time with my family. You'd miss church if you had to. I mean, come on now. If you knew it was waiting on you at home, you'd you'd do just about anything. &gt;&gt; Make sure you were there. You know how they Some of you will do that for a cell phone &gt;&gt; when they require a signature. &gt;&gt; You move heaven and earth to be there when it gets there. &gt;&gt; But what about him? This is not all you need for the rest of life. It's all you need for the rest of eternity. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And he's laid it at your doorstep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just like you come to the to the inkeeper. He's laid it at your doorstep. And you have a choice. Will I take it? Will I take time? Will I make time in my busy schedule to take him in to receive the word? Or will I just leave it there? Even though it could change my life. The truth is we don't really believe what's in the package. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's wrapped &gt;&gt; and we've never opened it up to see what's inside it. That's why some people can't worship God the way that they should is because they haven't seen what's on the inside. &gt;&gt; But if they could ever see what's on the inside, it'd make a worshipper out of them. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm so glad to raise that cloth off. Look what's laying underneath it. Eternal life. God made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they don't even give the gift a chance to receive it today. It interferes with them. Oh, if somebody would raise up in the church and start shouting or praising God or somebody say amen. I know sometimes our meetings people say, "Well, you got a bunch of ministers saying amen." I got a quote for it. &gt;&gt; He said, "Or somebody say amen like this group of ministers here." &gt;&gt; I think it's appropriate for ministers to amen the word. But not just ministers. &gt;&gt; Everybody to amen the word. Right? So he said he said something like this group of ministers here or something or in the audience quickly. He said an usher would lead them to the door and if you had your name on the book it would be quickly taken off. See God don't have a chance. &gt;&gt; I say give him a chance this morning. &gt;&gt; You say well it might it might break into my dinner time. It might do that. Give him a chance this morning. Let him come to you. &gt;&gt; Open the door. Let him in. Let the word be born &gt;&gt; in your home. rejected in that day because it was wrapped in swaddling cloth. God's wrapped gift today for many. &gt;&gt; Christmas is a bottle of whiskey. A party at the office spending too much on a credit card. That's not Christmas. I know it's what the world calls Christmas, the Catholic holiday, but that's not what we observe at this time of year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What are we doing? We worship Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A light in the darkest hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People are still playing with the paper on the floor. They still don't want the gift. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like a little child, you y'all, some of you give your kids Christmas gifts and birthday gifts, whatever it is. Birthdays are pagan, too, by the way. But you give your children gifts and there's wrapping on them. They take off the wrapping and they play with it. And you could have just got them a box. It's because they're not grown up &gt;&gt; enough to recognize the importance. If there's something wrapped, there must be something good in it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If God delivered a package to the earth, there must be something good in it. If he's given us a message today, there must be something good in it. Let's not be like the foolish Pharisee that refuses to look and see what's inside. Well, I'm just going to live my life and go to church and be No. Look inside the gift. &gt;&gt; Look inside and see what he said. Listen, people are still playing. They don't want the gift. But brother Brandon said, "I want it." How many can say amen to that this morning? I'm closing. He said, "I want it. I'm glad I received it." Oh, Emmanuel, God made flesh and dwelt among us, rejected and condemned all down through the ages. and his mercy extends today to every heart that will receive him. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you this morning as the musicians come, would you receive him? Take off the dirty cloth he's wrapped in and see Christ, hear the voice of the prophet of Malachi 4, Elijah, calling you to open the package. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said the first ones to open the package was the angels. He said when they l opened the package and looked inside, he said they began to rejoice. &gt;&gt; Yes. When the wise men f saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. Oh, I believe it ought to be a rejoicing time. When we look inside the package and see beyond the tinsel and and the wrapping and everything else and see Christ is still he was born. He's a reality. He He's living among us. He's the same yesterday and forever. We don't have to wait till Christmas time to worship him. Let's worship him every day, every hour. Listen, if you've not let him in your heart, if he's still waiting outside knocking and your creed won't let him in or your lifestyle won't let him in, why don't you open up that door this morning with every head bowed and every eye closed? Open up that door. Don't be so busy that the word doesn't have time to become flesh. You see, Jesus didn't become the man of Galilee overnight. It took 30 years till John pointed him out and said, "Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." 30 years. Oh, however long it takes. Brother Brandham said, "We're not we don't believe in overnight conversions." You know, he said that. In other words, you don't become a full mature Christian. Yes, you're born and and just it just takes a moment to be born, but you don't become a full mature Christian overnight. Don't get discouraged at yourself. You just keep receiving the word, receiving the word. Let the word become flesh. And Jesus even being the the son of God, God wrapped in flesh, he said, yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered. You can only do that if you're looking at the gift. You won't put up with the long journey. Mary had a long journey. Joseph had a long journey. The wise men had a longer journey. But unless they recognized the importance of what they were looking for and what they were looking at, they would never go through the hardship. Unless you recognize today the importance of the message and the importance of what's being said, you will never go through the hardship. The first time you're mocked or made fun of or laughed at, you'll turn back. But oh, let me open up my heart. Let me see the importance of it today. Let me see God's wrapped gift. Oh, hallelujah. Let me see it. That's my cry. If maybe you've never given your heart to the Lord, I want to give you this opportunity. I do this because brother Brandon did it almost every Christmas time. If you want to raise your hand, brother Brandon taught us that was a powerful thing. If you want to raise your hand, maybe you've never really given your heart to the Lord. You'd like to do that this morning. God bless that hand. I believe he can do it today. I believe he can save you. If you'll just open up your heart to him, he can change you, make you new, take away all the old, make you a new creature in Christ. God bless that hand. Maybe maybe there's someone else here. Maybe you're a Christian, but you just kind of got busy and the word's been waiting on your doorstep and you just didn't take time to let him in. Said, "Brother Ben, I want I just want to take time today to let the word in my life." Would you raise your hand? My hands are raised. I want to take the time though I get busy. Brother Brandon said, "They got so busy at Pharisees house with religious things that they forgot to they forgot to entertain him when he came in." Yeah. No matter what you believe or what your theories are or how much what dogma or whatever you might have, he's still worthy to be worshiped, he's still worthy. Not just at this time of year, every time of year, he's worthy of our worship and our praise. Let's just let's just turn it to him now. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, is the hand that went up, Lord, for salvation. I pray God that you'd cleanse them of all sin today. you'd help them to receive your your great gift, Lord. May they quickly find their way, Lord, to a place where they can receive you with all of their heart. I pray, God, that you they would do it today. May they grow continually, Lord. Lord, that little light that comes on the inside as they raise their hand, Lord, may it continue to grow until it fills their entire being. I pray you grant it, Lord, for those of us, Lord, who want to welcome you in our homes. Welcome you, Lord. Welcome the word in our lives. And I pray God that you'd help us. Help me, Lord, not to get so busy even with pastoral things and things that are are good and godly. But Lord, may I not get so busy that I don't have time to receive the word. Oh, help me Lord. Help me, Lord. I I want to when you come knocking, Lord, I want to be there to open up. I don't want to be an inkeeper that put you away, but I want to give you room in my house. Oh granted, Lord. Lord, may we look inside and see that wrapped gift. open up the wrapping and see you revealed in this hour. I pray you'd grant it, God. I pray we'd be able to see one another, Lord. That's all we've got. There's not a lot of us, Lord. I pray you'd help us to see the gift of our of our people, Lord, that we fellowship with, Lord. The people that believe like we do, and we may have little differences here and there, but Lord, help us to see your wrapped gift, oh God. love one another, the word becoming flesh. Grant it, Lord, we pray. May this message be more than something we talk about or Lord, a a belt buckle or something we put on, but Lord, may it be a reality that lives in our hearts. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Oh, shine all [singing] around us &gt;&gt; by by day and [music] by night. [singing] Oh Jesus, the light of the altar's open.
