we're depending on you today we want you to move in our midst I pray that the Holy Ghost would be free move in this service and you would have the preeminence among us we pray in Jesus name amen hallelujah thank the Lord and we're going to go to First Peter chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 13 we'll read down through verse 16 first Peter 1:13 says wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lust or that's desires your former desires and your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be holy in all manner of conversation that word conversation the King James is your your manner of Life your lifestyle because it is written be holy for I am Holy me you believe he's holy today amen you may be seated Lord that his Blessing to the word I want to speak to us today on sanctification want to say I appreciate uh the people who come and worked as well if you get a chance go and look at the at the uh side of the church where we did some work over there it looks really nice appreciate you doing that I heard a story of a young man who was uh in Russia and a priest who had uh been trying to get the kids interested in coming to church and he couldn't get them to come and so he started handing out candy and that's always a good program to get kids to come to church so he started handing out candy and there was this particular young man uh that uh kept coming back for the candy he'd take the candy and he'd run off in the field and eat it and they were really poor in the peasants in Russia and so he uh he got him to come he kind of coaxed him into the church and got him to where he could recite scripture and at one point the boy got up and recited all four gospels the entire gospels from memory and so he was well taught and the priest had taught him well about those things and uh he was able to do that uh years later that boy became the premier of Russia his name was Nikita kushev and Kush had become the man when they sent the Cosmonaut you remember to the moon and they looked up there and they said we've been then we orbited the Earth and they said there's no God the same boy that recited all four gospels is the same one that said there's no God learning isn't enough to save us it takes more than learning it takes more than legalism it takes the supernatural work of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives to make us live as Christians and and and so God has to do that and there's things that we can do or will do because we are Christians but it takes that Supernatural work to clean us up it takes the blood to save from sin aren't you glad for that today it still takes the blood to save from sin like these are just a little bit too loud it still takes the blood do you believe that the blood is still effective today he's still the same yesterday today and forever and he never changes so God deals with the individual we've been talking about about that as he has dealt with the church in three stages he deals with individual in justification uh sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the fourth stage if we could say it that way is the Holy Ghost itself coming and and having the preeminence in our lives and that is our adoption the message of the hour as we look forward to our full adoption which is the change of our bodies now brother brandom talks about how that the life come through the plant Jesus told us that except a corn of wheat go into the ground and die it abides alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruit and and so the church he said had to go into the ground and die in order to come through the stages of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then the Holy Ghost itself now now brother brand said the life that was in the in the stalk and in the tossle and in the husk all gathers in the seed yeah so all all the life that was in justification all the life that was in sanctification all the life that was in you have to help me this morning I having trouble with my voice and but all the life that was in those things uh gathered into the seed and I believe we're living in seed time how many believe that this morning we're living in the seed time so the life that was in one BR said the life that was in the stalk one went to make the other justification made a way for sanctification sanctification made made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to come right down in Perfection back to the word again to manifest itself so we know that it was the Holy Ghost in all three stages it was it's the holy ghost that justifies it's the holy ghost that sanctifies and it's the holy ghost that fills right and it's the holy ghost that is the word it it's all him and I'm so grateful for that today now but it it is a work of the Holy Ghost brother B said that this justification served its time he said in justification under Luther it had to become sanctification through Wesley sanctification served its time till it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost served its time until the Holy Spirit which there's only one God he said Blends into the church and the church into Christ and it makes Jesus Christ reflected on the earth what he promised here in the Bible it makes Jesus reflected on the Earth what he promised in the Bible now we know that and I'm kind of hurrying to lay a background here so we can get to what we want to preach on this morning but it is possible to be justified and even Sanctified without having the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'll say this if you're a seed of God you will become the grain yeah does that make sense your life as it goes through those stages it will not remain in justification it will not remain in sanctification it will end up at the baptism of the Holy H ghost and even the seed itself it does become that now why does it become that because of the type of seed that it is so you will become that so we don't need to spend all of our our life worrying well maybe I'll get stuck on justification maybe I'll get stuck on sanctification and be lost no it it was possible for people to do that but if you're a seen of God you'll go on into the fullness of the world Judas did not go on in oh he was justified and Sanctified yes but and we know that because because Jesus Sanctified his disciples he was justified and Sanctified but he did not go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he was the son of predition yes and so in first John 5:7 uh John deals with this and and brother brandom teaches about this but John deals with it like this there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost that's the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost these three are one someone say they are one they are one there there's only one God 1 John 5'8 and there are three that bear witness in in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one they're not one but they agree in one so it's possible uh to go to have one without the other and so brother B said notice the first three are one the second three are Earthly which agree in one you cannot have the father without the son you cannot have the son without having the Holy Ghost but you can have the water without the blood and the blood without the spirit yes so natural birth is the type so brother brand said it is so it is in the spiritual realm as it is in natural he said it's water justification by faith believing on God receiving him as your personal Savior and being baptized you got to go through that stage right if you haven't this morning you got to go through that stage you're never going to get started unless you go through the stage and do what God Said and repent and be baptized yeah right just hearing the word is not going to be enough you've got to do what God says so you've got to go through that now as you go through that he said second is sanctification of the spirit I want you to watch that this morning not sanctification of the flesh because the flesh is not Sanctified every flesh is just as rotten as every other flesh right but in sanctification of the spirit sanctification of the spirit that God cleanses the spirit from all elements of the world world and the desire of the world and then the Holy Spirit comes in I love that the Holy Spirit comes in and gives New Birth and fills up that Sanctified vessel and he explains it in a very uh way that we I think we can all get it this morning he said a glass is laying out in the chicken yard now that's a dirty glass if you've ever seen a glass laying in a chicken yard that is a dirty glass because there's nothing filled healthier than a chicken that's right and I I say that with passion because one of my jobs as a youth as a young person what when I was these kids' age was to clean out the chicken house whenever Dad decided he particularly didn't like me that day he'd sent me out to the chicken house and I got to clean it out and it didn't get cleaned regularly we we had a farm but it wasn't one of these these Farms where everything's painted and everything's nice and like that we had a real farm and so things were messy sometimes brother the Caleb and and so uh cleaning out the chicken house was a big deal so what we did uh what I learned to hate that because because it caused such filth and if there was ever a glass got put out there and I've actually seen it if there was ever a glass in the chicken yard you don't just pick that up and put it on your table and fill it with something to drink right you don't pick it up and put it on your table and fill it up with water or milk no he said by picking it up is justification you picked it up you've been picked up oh my and that's a wonderful thing you've been picked up but cleansing it is sanctification because the Greek word sanctify is a compound word which means cleansed and set aside for service so the idea is you take the glass and you wash it you put soap on it you you you you cleanse it with hot hot water as hot as you can find and you cleanse the impurities from it and you get it sparkling clean and then you set it up in the in the cabinet because one day you're going to fill it and use it amen so now you feel it he said he said it's not in service he said sanctification is a compound word which means cleansed and set aside for service not not in service for service then when you fill it it's put in service so everybody understand that now so sanctification uh in the Bible uh you know you say what why sanctification why why does god require Holiness Holiness in whenever you see the word Holiness especially in the New Testament in the Greek it's the same as the word sanctification Holiness why does god require Holiness Genesis 2:3 and I want us to think Beyond this morning I want us to think Beyond uh just dress when we talk about Holiness that is part of it but I want us I want us to think beyond that because sanctification is sanctification of the spirit amen and you could be you could dress everything right and do everything right and never never did anything wrong and always wee long dresses and long sleeves and and have a long face to go with it or whatever you want to to do you could have done everything right and not have a Sanctified Spirit how will you know if oh I'm getting head of myself here how do you know if you have a Sanctified Spirit if the word can come to you and it and you don't re re against it you've been cleansed from that you might have used to have been that but it don't bother you no more because you've been cleaned of that but when the word comes forth and and and and you get angry at it why because you're not Sanctified yet right that's true now look not in service for service now sanctification in Genesis 2:3 God introduces the idea of sanctification he said God bless the seventh day and San Sanctified it Sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made now he didn't have to cleanse the second day but Sanctified in the in the Hebrew is apartness apartness sacredness Holiness he set it aside for himself the seventh day was his that's why he wouldn't allow them in the Old Testament it wouldn't allow them to work on the seventh day wouldn't allow them to travel only so far on the seventh day which was Saturday but now we've entered into rest as God entered into his rest Paul teaches us we've entered into rest our Sabbath is the Holy Ghost it's not Sunday we work on Sundays many of us do getting to church getting our kids up and getting ready Sunday can be a hard difficult day but that's not our rest our rest is the Holy Ghost whether we're working whether we're whether we're going to church whatever it is that we're doing our rest is the Holy Ghost so but on the seventh day God rested from all his all his work which he had created and made and he Sanctified or set apart the seventh day and and being a holy God he required Holiness in worship to him and so there were many ceremonial things which were types of things that we believe now today types of things that Christ did on the cross types of the blood many types that were that were made in the Old Testament but they were and they were ceremonial but it was because God was holy not just any you couldn't just come to God any old way way you couldn't come to God with any old fire it had to be a certain fire you couldn't come to God with any old offering it had to be a certain offering you couldn't come to God within your attitude it had to be a certain attitude right so you had to come to God a certain way you had to be set apart yeah and even the average person in that day couldn't even come to God directly they come through the priest who was set apart or Sanctified for the work of God and that's why today Peter tells us we're all Kings and Priests right we've been set apart for the work of I'm so glad you've been set apart today yeah so now watch now Exodus 29:37 tells us about it seven days Thou shalt make an atonement for the altar yeah for the altar it oh my if worship was going to be on it then it had to be Sanctified first if God was going to accept worship from the altar if he was going to accept a sacrifice from the altar it had to be sanctified before he would accept it do you see how important it is this morning so he said seven days thou shall make an atonement for the Altar and sanctify it and it shall be an altar Most Holy whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy whatever toucheth the altar shall be holy God is Holy he is set apart so anything DED dedicated him must be cleansed and set apart the word is used in the Old Testament of people and things Exodus 29:44 said I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the congregation and the altar I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office so it tells us that they had to be dressed in a certain way where the ROM talks about it they would put actually on their outer robe they would put on the bottom they put a pomegranate and a bell a pomegranate and a bell and when the man walked when the priest high priest walked in the holy of holies it would ring out but it didn't just make noise but it rang Holiness unto the Lord yeah that's what it was crying Holiness unto the Lord right because they had followed the instructions of God so every time the the bells would ring it would ring in a certain way and you knew that when you heard that noise you knew there was life yes oh God it's not just any noise but life that comes from a noise that comes from a life of Holiness is the noise that God accepts right so now now they had to be dressed a certain way and come in his presence a certain way Leviticus 8:6 tells us that Moses brought Aaron and his sons washed him with water verse 10 Moses took anointing wall and Anointed The Tabernacle all that was therein and Sanctified them verse 11 he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and Anointed The Altar and all his vessels both the labor and his foot to sanctify them verse 12 he poured out the anointing wall upon Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him and he brought the bull of verse 14 for the sin offering and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bullet for the sin offering why they had to be identified with their sacrifice brother Bram taught us we have to be identified with our sacrifice you've got to feel the death of your sacrifice you got to be identified with what he did for you there on Calvary I said we ought to be identified today with that it ought to do something for us right they had let the blood run all over them so they were identif ified by with their sacrifice and then but all of that alone the washing of the water all of the anointing oil they had to finish with something else now if you if you cut your hand got a little blood on your on your shirt collar say and or your cuff you know what you would do you you'd sanctify it you clean the blood off right you clean it off but that's that's not what God required in the Old Testament you didn't take the blood and clean it off but when you got done washing it anointing it cleaning it up you pour blood on it you sprinkle blood on it right because only the blood could sanctify oh god oh hope we recognize what go what he did for us today only the blood could really sanctify because the blood showed that it something had died because no matter how how much you sanctify that altar with anointing oil how much you sanctify that altar with with water there had to be Blood on the altar because when the blood came on the altar then there was known and it spoke back to God a life had been given oh I'm here to tell you today you can't be Sanctified by by just coming to church you can't be Sanctified by just saying I believe the message you can't be Sanctified by just saying well I'm just going to be a good person but you're Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ which was shed for you and when the blood is applied then sanctification is there now watch no amount of scrubbing can make something clean enough to serve God's purpose it takes the blood Leviticus 8:15 he slew it Moses took the blood put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified The Altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the Altar and Sanctified it to make reconciliation upon it Solomon's Temple was Sanctified by Jehovah in 2 Chronicles 7:14 it's a famous scripture he said If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven will forgive their sin and will heal their land he said now mine eyes shall be open mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place you want his eyes to be open I believe his eyes are open today why because you've been washed by the blood his eyes are open his his ears are attentive to your prayer yeah he said and he said for now I have chosen and Sanctified this house see that was the temple of God it had to be Sanctified I have chosen and Sanctified this house that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually oh God don't you realize that if you receive the baptism of the the Seal of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost that you cannot be lost that you don't go in and out anymore but you're sealed on the inside oh my to to your destination he said grieve not the Holy Spirit by which you're sealed till the day of your Redemption yeah right so you you can't be un you can't be sealed and then unsealed why because he Sanctified you and then he come down to live in you and he said you'll be my people forever yes sir right that's good Paul does the same thing for the spiritual Temple if you go and there's a whole teaching on this I time this morning to go into it but 1 Corinthians 6:19 he said what know you not it's your body now you think about this for a minute your body is the temple there's things we don't allow here in the church you come in with popcorn we don't allow you to eat it in the church you can sit up there in your car and eat it you can't come in the church with it why you know in the modern church today you just come in and and they got a coffee bar and you go out and sit out there for a while and I went to a gospel music concert at a church and I won't call the name of the church it a great big church and I went there and I thought well this pretty nice during the service you got TV screens it was like a a sports bar you know you had all the TV screens up here and you could sit there at the coffee shop drink your coffee and watch the preacher for a while and they had the kitty Zone and all the all the play things and all things like that I thought my goodness what a you know love to have areas like wonderful areas like that but see we don't allow those things in the church why don't we allow them here in the sanctuary where the preaching happens right we don't someone walks in with their hat on they take it off out of respect even myself when I'm here by myself I I I usually wear a hat because I'm losing my hair so I wear a hat because I found it's necessary not because I like to but just NE because it's hard to find a hat that fits his head but I've it's it's necessary some of y'all bald people can say Amen to that this morning so I Sanctified I put a hat on it you know and and I but when I come in here I take it off why that seems like why would you do that because we this is a sanctuary but this isn't the true Sanctuary you understand this isn't the real Sanctuary the real Sanctuary is in here the real Sanctuary is in your heart the reason you come to this Sanctuary the reason you're faithful to the house of God is because he dwell in Your Heart Right he said no you not your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God you are not your own you don't get to just make when you're Sanctified by the Holy Ghost and filled with his power you don't get to just make whatever decision you want to make you don't get to lead your life just whatever way you want to lead it you don't get to just go out and you say well I'll just go do this or I'll go do that no you you ask him you talk to him why you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost right and and the sons of God are moved by the spirit Spirit of God they're filled with the spirit of God and do what he says that's good walk by faith and not by sight not what I say what the spirit of God says right now look and and but the modern Church look they teach sanctification as optional right it's not it's not optional the Holy Ghost will not dwell in a dirty house right right and you are not born again until you've been filled with the Holy Ghost right right and so you can't he will not dwell in a dirty house but I'm so glad that he sanctifies Us by his blood yeah I'm glad he does that now to be justified and Sanctified is to be a partaker of heavenly things see it's not an optional thing Hebrews 12:14 follow peace with all men and Holiness that sanctification without which someone say no man no no man shall see the Lord right no no no human being is going to make it to heaven without being Sanctified and that's why I say it has to be a work of the Holy Spirit now look because we can't do that ourselves uh uh we we cannot sanctify ourselves we'll get to this in a moment we cannot sanctify ourselves until we have been Sanctified that makes sense we we we sanctify ourselves because we have been Sanctified and filled by the holy ghost look and I know and I want you to understand that you know sometimes people this this is to them because they say well you know I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and I never really my life was not cleaned up before but now I'm Different well he he justified you he Sanctified you he filled you with the Holy Ghost he can do that all at once he can do that over time but you know because there's been a change right right so don't let that get in your head because when I was a kid I thought I had to go to the altar three times I had to go for justification had to go for sanctification had to go for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the wesling people had taught that sanctification was a second work of Grace which it is but it's just the second stage on the Journey of the new birth the new birth is it if you've got filled with the Holy Ghost and you had to have been Sanctified yeah does that make sense so and God can do that God can clean you up that's why it's a work of God not a work of your own right and yet yet sometimes it takes time it does take time because we have to die to ourselves in order to be born again but I'll say this whatever stage you've reached don't stop there keep pressing on say to those of you who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now it's time for you to go to work that's right right because now is the time to sanctify yourselves now Hebrews 6:4 it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift were made partakers of the Holy Ghost have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again and repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open Shain now these are not those who have backs and come back back to church that's not what he's talking about he's talking about somebody who walked through justification and sanctification and looked at the Holy Ghost and mocked it and made fun of it and turned away from it and walked away and never had a desire in their heart again what was it what brother said if you have a desire in your heart you can be saved but but but they don't have no desire anymore why it's impossible for them to renew themselves because they walked up to the Holy Ghost and said I don't need it I don't want it it's not for me right right so we we need in our own selves we just make sure that you always want whatever God's got for you and he'll give it to you now he that despised Moses law Paul said died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses of how much sore punishment suppose you shall he be thought worthy who trotten under the foot the Son of God has counted the blood of the Covenant where with he was Sanctified an Unholy thing so he was Sanctified but he counted the blood of the Covenant as an Unholy thing at done despite to the spirit of Grace that's why sanctification is not enough you got to go on into the Holy Ghost taught us that the nazarin the pilgrim Holiness we were I was raised around those people and I know how holy their lives were many of them and how they lived they were Hypocrites there just like there are everywhere but there were some godly people there and they lived it they lived it but they they they turned down the Holy Ghost now their denomination their move has died yeah because they turn down the Holy Ghost yeah now sanctification as a part of the new birth is not a work of man but it's a work of Grace it's a work of the Holy Spirit now we are called we must receive the token that's what we must receive the Assurance all this well you say well I have to jump through all the Hoops now look at the ones who received the Holy Ghost when Peter preached in cornelius's house they hadn't been baptized yet they hadn't received but yet when the word was preached as the word was preached the Holy Ghost fell on the ENT entire congregation they received the Holy Ghost and then they went out spoke with tongues they went out and were baptized right so don't get in your mind well it has to happen this way it has to happen at this Camp it has to happen at this service it has to be in this kind of a no it can be whenever God wants it to be whenever he's calling you that's the moment to come when you hear him calling that's when to come you say brother Ben when should I go to an altar when should I seek the Lord you should seek the Lord when you feel a pull in your heart when there's something in you to go go whenever you feel that pull go because God can take it oh my who can take a clean thing an unclean thing make it clean God can he's the only one that can clean you up he's the only one that can when you feel that pole go you say well I'm not good enough go anyway he'll make you good enough that's his job we should Christians we should come to the altar when we when we feel his pres I'm not calling for an altar service every time we don't do that but just when you feel you have a need this a place to get it you can get it at home too you can get it in your closet but when you when when you feel that pull go to him yeah good I want us to be scared of asking for what we have need of he said you have not right CU you ask not right I want everything he's got for me I want to ask we're Sanctified what are we Sanctified by by the will of God yeah the Bible teaches that us that Hebrews 10:9 said then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all right sir right so this is the work of sanctification as it relates to the New Birth he sanctifies You by his blood once for all yeah and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after you had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God right from henceforth expecting amen till his enemies be made his foot stol oh if he's at the right hand of God do you realize he's also placed you at his right hand he's at the right hand of go my and he's placed you at his right hand that ought to mean that you ought to sit down expecting till God makes your enemies your foot stol expecting till cancer is under your feet expect till diabetes under your feet expecting till a new body is yours he sat down at God's right hand you sit down at his right hand in Heavenly places yes what the Bible teaches amen listen brother BR said when we were Sinners alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud he said God came to us God sought you you never sought God no man can come to me except the father draws him first and God came down in that muck what you were and sought you out and brought you out that ought to create a perfect love in your heart look what you was look what you are what did that you said do how do I know I got it brother B look what you was look what you are no emotion can ever tell you that you got it no sensation can ever tell you but if you look what you was what a great testimony we've heard of these young people that receed they got an emotion they got a sensation but they also change yeah come on Church they also change we're seeing a change in our young people that's what we want to see we want to see God get a hold of a life until you can't run them away from the house of God we want to see God get a hold of a life until you couldn't run them back to the world yeah yes sir it's good Let The Devil tell you that was just an emotion look back to your change yeah look what you was and look what you are what did that somebody that loves you yes amen hallelujah we got a sign somewhere I think we had it I don't know if we still have it on the wall but says all because two people loved one another and I would say when it comes to being a Christian it's not even about me loving him right but all that I have all of my life is because he loved me because he loved me my life you think about how different it is because you your wife met and and you love one another and and how different your life has become and how it's changed you as a human being because your your wife was just made for you she your counterpart and and you can look at one another and realize that's what God did in your life and just think how much more of a change it was when God come down in your life he loved you and you were unlovable and he changed you and made you into something new yes aren't you glad for that today that ought to make us worship we ought to be able to worship at that we shouldn't have to pump up worship we shouldn't have to have to just he said well if everything's not perfect I can't worship no no in the moments when everything is imperfect in the moments when everything's gone wrong in the that's when you lift your hands and you say Lord I love you I know what you did for me I know how different my life is than what it would have been if you had never touched it if you had never come down I realize how dirty and filthy I was and I know what you've done in my life right I know what you've done for me I'm not going to let anything talk me out of that Hallelujah somebody that loves you can't you have faith in what he's promised you then real genuine love will create a confidence in his word yes now sanctification is sanctification of the spirit of the spirit see God brother brand in in the 50s brother Harvey and I talked about this the other day he talked about he gave you a new spirit said because with the spirit that you got in you you couldn't get along with yourself said he gave you a new heart right a new heart Brother people mistake that for the Holy Ghost but it's not he gave you a heart or desire right to go along with the things of God yeah well that's justification and sanctification right but there's go but he said then I'll put my spirit in you yes and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost now it's a cleansing of our spirit realm and of the mind it's not just say well I quit smoking I quit drinking that's part of it but it it's why because people by human effort can do some of those things but it's why it's a cleansing of the mind and the spirit I want us to think soberly about this today because I think all of us need this listen brother brand said secondly comes sanctification which sets our mind in order for Holiness to think right to think right we sanctify ourselves to the word until we can think right look he said then the next comes the baptism of the fire and holy ghost that God might dwell in US and the fire of God cleanses our hearts from sin puts the Holy Ghost Inside he said then we bring forth the same life that he did this did bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us see the word Christ comes into you the B said a man can repent of his sins and he's still thinking well maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds is still there now now what what does he do you know when when a man sees a woman that's immoral immorally dressed it's why we want we we ask our sisters to dress uh to dress according to the word not not according to some church theology or tradition but according to the word we ask that because when a man sees that and and even women have this to some extent but with men there's something about a man that when he sees that uh he it does something he he'll notice it now but noticing it that's temptation but it's dwelling on it that's sin right unless it's your wife obviously but dwelling on it is sin now look so he said well maybe he's an immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds is still there so in other words he wants to right he wants to he wants to sin he he wants to go out but see the the Sanctified man now how much more the baptism of the Holy Ghost fill in that Temple but even the Sanctified man watch he said when you get Sanctified cleanses that desire out of him takes the one of it away you can still be tempted huh temptation is not sin and we need to understand that our young people need to understand that he say well I'm always tempted by women well join the club boy that got quiet didn't it brother brother brandom held a put a cross in his car that's right that he looked at gave him something to look at so he could be reminded of the death of Christ that's why we have boundaries that's why we have wives and husbands and we set things up and have boundaries so we we put our young people it's not because we don't trust them we have boundaries and the way that they go together way they Court way they date things like that there's a reason for that because we realize people are human right but when but when you get Sanctified now now now watch there's something in you if you just constantly just lust after that and want to go after that it's because there's something wrong and there's something wrong and brother BR says it's a spirit it's a spirit that that needs to be cleansed out of you taken away from you look it he said he can still be tempted but he takes the want of it away still he's not right yet he said then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost in fire see God can make it where you where you never go do that again because you could be Sanctified Justified Sanctified and then still be pulled back out into that but God can so save a man until he won't want to ever do it again right the want to is just gone I say God take me there let let him take you there this morning until the want to is gone he's baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire cleansed burned out cleaned up and put in the service of God he said sanctification only sets him aside for service brother brand talks about Mary Magdalene he said she didn't know she had Seven Devils she just thought she was pretty think about it for a minute she didn't realize she had Seven Devils on her making her do what she did she didn't realize it was just it was a spiritual realm in a spiritual realm there's a battle going on yeah and so she thought well she wore the dresses she did and the things she did she had Seven Devils but the one of them was Pride she didn't realize that it was a spiritual battle and and and again not because she was a bad person but it was spirits that gotten on her he said but now when you get that kind of spirit on you or men he said you get out here and start lusting for women he said you said well it's human nature not like that said see no it's a spirit the Bible said it was a spirit he say so the thing to do that's why we need a spiritual church right because there's a direct connection between being dead and sinning immorality come on church we need to be alive I don't say that means we're running the aisles and shouting all the time but we need to have something burning in our hearts because you get away from the fire of God this flesh is still flesh that's why we need to come to church on a regular basis come and and and and receive from God and be cleansed All Over Again by the washing of the water of the word we need that we need the presence of God we need power of God in our services come on because if not you you end up with immorality I've seen it hundreds of times yeah that that it just ends up in immorality and everything else we must have his presence as a minister his presence is not optional to me his anointing is not optional I must have it yes I must have it or I'll go out like everyone else does we must not grieve the Holy Spirit look it's a spirit the Bible said it was a spirit so the thing to do then he said the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from lust and passion called sanctification the word sanctification means to be cleaned and set aside for service he said no that lust Spirit leaves you under sanctification a little lady nice goes to church she sings in the choir but she has to mow her grass with a little pair of shorts on let her get Sanctified one time let her put on a pair see she won't do it she don't want to to let that man that'll almost have her wreck look at at that woman in the yard let him get Sanctified one time go down the street he'll keep his mind on what he's doing amen that's exactly right if he gazes sideways he'll turn his head this way the holy spirit says turn your head that's it see there you are he said that's sanctification now look you're Sanctified by the blood that's a work that God does in your life you can't do that for yourself but now look there is something we can do now you say what is that you say brother Ben I know I've been born again my sins are forgiven my life has changed how many can say Amen to that this morning I know God's done something in my life my life changed I know what I was I know what I am now I you know you couldn't I didn't want to go to church now I do I didn't want to serve God now I do I'm not perfect as John Newton said I'm not what I he said I'm not what I want to be he said but I'm not what I wish to be he said but I'm sure not what I was and so we could say that Amen to that today now we are we what happens is as after we've been changed there is an ongoing work of sanctification because I've told you before that that Spirit gets it's all clogged up that Spirit realm is not saved in other words what's sealed is the soul so the body and the spirit are not are not born again that's right right so if the body and spirit are not born again there has to be something continually right but the brand said the the blood Keeps Us saved yeah right and it's the blood the application of the blood in our lives and brother brand calls that applying the token right you take the token he said you take the blood it wasn't enough just to have it he said it must be applied it must be applied and he said you apply the token you kick all the trash out it's famous quote you apply that you do all of that why do you do that because you're applying the token you you're doing something about it right right so there's a there's a sanctification of the spirit realm that still takes place after you've been born again so you young people you come from camp and you realize you're just rejoicing and praising God and then you start F in battles just the devil tempting you devil trying you devil working on you old people the same way all of us fight battles theom taught us when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the devil sets a Target on us yeah right and we start fighting battles yeah so you start fighting battles you say what am I going to do about my battle well you're going to you're just going to keep applying the blood applying the blood applying the blood right and that's sanctification now the Bible tells us that that there is an ongoing work the the Bible tells us we're Washed by the Water of the word right we're Washed by the Water of the word the Bible tells us we're continually Sanctified the Bible tells us that we we apply the token to our lives it tells us the bride makes herself ready right there's a constant cleansing because we get our Jesus taught Peter a great lesson he he he went to wash his feet and Peter says you won't wash my feet Jesus said if I don't wash your feet you're not part of me yeah right and so Peter's like he is you know before you got the Holy Ghost just this way and that way 100 degrees one way or the other and and and what he did he's like well uh he said then wash every part of me yeah Jesus said you don't need your whole body washed you're cleansed right but not all yeah right and he said you're cleansed but your feet get dirty right listen to me Church you're clean you've been clean by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you've been born again but you're your spirit gets dirty right you get you get little things on you little attitudes little things on you it shouldn't be there you begin to sit in church and and you can't sit in church without without something just consuming you because you think so this so and so wrong and so and so wrong you got this grudge against this one and that grudge against that one this one mistreated me that one Mist don't you realize what needs to happen come on you need to be Sanctified all right by the blood of Jesus Christ sanctify yourself yeah right can you do that Jesus did now watch this is not a work to be saved it works because we are saved yeah now Jesus was Sanctified by the Father John 10:36 he said say ye of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemist because I said I the Son of God he said you called your prophets Gods he said but I've been Sanctified by the father other words he was already clean but he was set apart he was set apart to do the father's will to do only his will will he was Sanctified by the father yet in John 10:36 brother Brandon said it's the sweetest or John 1718 rather and 19 the B said is the sweetest scripture in the Bible he said and for the he said as thou has sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world and for their sakes now can you can you listen can can we just pull in for just about 10 minutes now before we close just kind of stay with me for a minute he said for their sakes now now I want you to think about the their that God has given you God has given you a their their sakes a them a people your neighbor your friend your church your family your husband your wife right he's given you a them a their their sakes he's given you somebody yes and what does he say for their sakes I'd like to do this but for their sakes I'd like to live my own life and do my own thing but for their sakes what about your children today there's things I'd like to do there there's Liberties I'd like to take but for their sakes brother Rand talked about a man a preacher Don rle who was a man who pastored a church that was ultr legalist and brother B talks to him I don't remember what it was about I think it was short sleeves maybe that they they wouldn't wear short sleeves they'd only wear sleeves down to their elbows talked to me and said you don't believe that he said no he said but but they do he said so I I do it for their sakes brother B said I wanted to grab his neck and hug him because sometimes and that's what brother Brand's talking about when he said if Pastor sometimes Strays with the sheep in order to bring them back it's not that the pastor goes out and sin with them sometimes the pastor will will put up with maybe a wrong idea or something that somebody has because they want to save the person they want to help the person so he Sanctified himself he Sanctified himself listen Jesus Sanctified himself after he was Sanctified by the father you said well I've been cleansed by the blood I have the Holy Ghost that's enough but if you have the Holy Ghost you have the Life of Christ Living in you and what did Jesus do he Sanctified himself he set himself apart he lived apart from the world oh Church what will we do if he was Sanctified himself if he Sanctified himself after he was Sanctified by the father what will we do if his Spirit dwells in us hallelujah you find that in 1 Corinthians 9:27 where Paul says I bring under my body I keep under my body and bring it under subjection L having preached to others I myself would be a cast away I sanctify myself I know this isn't popular preaching but I think it's time we went back to the altar went back figuratively speaking or literally speaking I think it's time we come back to the house of God and Sanctified ourselves to the will of God for our lives every one of us need to do that no matter how saved you are how predestined you are you need to sanctify yourself to the will of God for your life yeah that's right Jesus in his prayer said father I sanctify myself Jesus became Sanctified to the church said he could have gotten married but he didn't do it he become Sanctified he said sanctify them Father through the truth Thy word is the truth he said now let's lay aside every way yes you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk we're going to get real real here for just a minute or we close said oh God lay it there now lay it there and watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away watch the love of God Lick It Up watch watch that old selfishness that old selfishness selfishness for the DAR Ward told me one time he said a lot of marriage problems is selfishness selfishness watch that old selfishness and the thing about selfishness is you can't really tell if you have it CU you're selfish oh God reveal to me show it to me Lord reveal to me David said reveal to me cleanse me from my secret faults search my my heart and know me oh God so watch that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you talked about the people in the church just stopp in there for a minute I'm not trying to make you nervous but I wanted to head home church I've seen people that could they they lived it man they they wore their long dresses boy they get if you if you if you got an inch Too Short right the way they talk about the church your spirit wasn't Sanctified clothes might have got Sanctified and our clothes need to get Sanctified too but their Spirit needs to be Sanctified sanctify myself for their sakes sir look the way you talked about the people in the church lay it on the on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn his place said brother Ben I have to go to every person I've talked about it might be a good thing but I'll say this many times it just causes disturbance and questions and someone come up to my old Pastor one time and he said and she come up to the lady she said brother Ivy I just want you to forgive me for all the bad thoughts I've had all the things that I've thought about you and how much I hated you and he all that did is caus him a complex because he's like I didn't know you hated me so we got to be careful with that but but if you lay it down on the altar Let the Fire of God clean it up they'll be able to tell they'll be able to tell cuz you'll treat them different not because you try to but because the fire of God cleansed your spirit you apply the token you applied the blood good am watch it lay it on the Altar and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place listen brother said he possessed every gate of Temptation I'm so glad he did he said oh how he did he was a man he was a man like you are he he was a man like I am he had a right to be married he had a right to have a home he had a right to the things that we have he had a right to have clothes he could have done it what you means by that is he had one robe you remember that's all he had he had a right to have a closet fo like I do he had a right to have things sir oh God but he turned it down right sir for your sake that's right for my sake he could have done it a man that could turn water into wine that could know where a coin was in a fish's mouth you know how rich I would be if I knew which fish had swallowed coins think about it for a minute be fishing all the time brother Allen forget banking we just go fishing if you knew which ones had coins in their mouth he did he can create money God he can still do that today by the way if you have a need he can create money but he didn't do it for your sake he knew where coin was he owned the heavens and earth yet he abstained from those things he abstained from those things he said the sweetest words in the Bible when he said father I sanctify myself that I might sanctify them what was he trying to do set an example he was sending 12 men out with a gospel that would conquer the world and he's depending on you and I to do it right he said if he could sanctify himself like that why ought we we to set aside every failure see you don't just sanctify yourself from sin but you sanctify yourself from sinful thoughts I'm not going to make it I'm not good enough I nobody likes me sanctify yourself for the sake of your children you hold that grudge against somebody I don't care who it is it'll kill your children that's right root of bitterness spring up in your life listen Church we've been through it but everybody goes through it yeah come on human human Humanity being a human is not easy I read about the Korean church that the Japanese when they went into Korea in World War to they found a church full of Believers worshiping like we are this morning and surrounded the church and burn it with fire Christians burn up and later on it become a hate in the in the eyes of the people for the Japanese because of what they did my grandpa fought the Japanese World War II and he hated the Japanese because of what they the way that they fought and things they just commit suicide and bomb and kamakazi and all those things and he just hated them wouldn't buy anything was Japanese and but yet these Koreans were real Christians and they they uh they went to they they they got burned up and their family members they watched them burning people that were on their way to church watched their family members and their the people they fellowship with burn up years later years later that church started up again and the pastor found it's like 50 years later the pastor found that those people they couldn't get over it they just it just continued on for Generations he said we're going to break the cycle and they become missionaries to Japan that church sent out oh God missionaries to Japan to tell them about the good news of the Gospel why because oh God they what happened they got they Sanctified themselves against that that's good just because you're born again doesn't mean Satan won't get a hold of you and try to make you bitter sanctify yourself we have to set aside every failure every doubt and everything else yeah and say ify ourselves brother B said what was he doing he was training up 12 disciples that were going to preach the gospel in all the world he put an example he said Brethren as ministers I tell you there only I think two of us this morning brother Joel and I but it speaks to us and brother steuart not here this morning but he it speaks to him as well speaks to all the ministers that come and stand behind this Pulpit listen to me said you preachers I'm talking to he said you Brethren as ministers I tell you it pays us not to get too much of the world's goods and things hanging around us you preachers I'm talking to sanctify yourself for them that you're going to lead see that's what we need today is a complete consecrated Sanctified life of ministers amen that walk upright before God God help me today does not entangle with the things of the world keep away from it taking that as a personal challenge you failed with the B many times that's why I sanctify myself I I want the newest car I want I want the biggest boat I want to do that but we sanctify ourselves the thing is when you do get power and you do get money what do you do with it CU if you were the boss I think about it for just a moment you come to church and and maybe you struggle maybe your boss don't let you come on Sundays or something like I've got situations like that I just wrote a letter for one brother to their uh company trying to let them come to church on Sundays cuz people don't respect that much any more and and so you know we work sometimes people have to work and they have to be out of church but but the thing is are we are we Sanctified and I'll say this some of y'all if you if you become a preacher and you didn't have to work no no one was your boss in the sense that they didn't wake you up in the morning what would you do if you become self-employed that well if I was just self-employed everything I wouldn't have those hours anymore boy I'd be at church I've seen that people who were not Sanctified when they were worked for somebody were not Sanctified when they didn't work for somebody amen well the situation was just different most of the time it stays the same find somebody who serves God under hardship and then you'll have somebody who serves God when things get a little easier and I'll challenge you young people sanctify yourself you're a you're a generation we seen that we are the generation let's sanctify ourselves keep ourselves in the house of God all right wonder he said keep away from it listen Jesus was God's wrapped gift tell me believes that today he was God's gift to the Earth at Christmas time brother B talks about that when he preaches his Christmas sermon God's W gift he said oh gifts of God we're all gifts of God that's what he taught us that sermon were wrapped gifts to the world oh gifts of God you people who claim you've received his Spirit keep yourself Sanctified so not just preachers but all of us keep yourself Sanctified yes keep away from the things of the world be Sanctified the BR said Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 men he was to take the gospel to the world he said for their sake I sanctify myself he said make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake don't use your Liberty for a cloak said Paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to let your communication be if you meet your enemy yeah sanctify yourself for his sake all right not knowing what you might do yes but the brandham had to sanctify himself it didn't come easy because he was a prophet was that much harder yeah brother BR could have taken that gift and charged for it the gift would have still been there but he Sanctified him himself brother brand talks about how he got old getting older he couldn't preach like he used to he felt like couldn't go like he used to he turned down to some meetings because he just felt like he couldn't do it and then he felt bad and so he said after praying for three or four days he said I got in such a place going around thinking oh God said I got in such a place that I didn't know what to do said God we're at the end of the road and I realized I've neglected I've had calls to go on and be tired and wouldn't do it that's a that's an admission to make you realize pastor are human people are human and sometimes you don't feel like going to church and sometimes I don't either I didn't feel like preaching this morning and and and sometimes you just don't feel like preaching but you go if you're not going to do it how's everybody else going to do it so you sanctify yourself for their sake now look look and not to myself as an example because many times I fail but brother the BR said he failed he said I've had calls to go on and be tired and wouldn't do it I thought then I could see my Lord staggering through the dark when he was so tired he could hardly raise one foot after the other one Oh my he talked about how he went by the Widow of Na's son you remember him he went to that funeral brother said he was sitting on the side of the road with a headache and he went to the Widow of Na's funeral he was suffering in his own body but here come here come a funeral procession by and he walks up to the funeral and raises the dead Jesus never preached the funeral he raised the dead and he raised the dead and went back and sat back down with his headache he was tempted like we are but the brother said well how did I get tired he said after seeing what he did how he persevered so how did I get tired what's the matter with me Lord here I think well I'm getting old I can't do it he thought of Moses and Caleb some of you Elders you you think about this this morning Moses was 120 and said his strength wasn't Abad Caleb was 80 years old and he said I'm as ready now as I ever was you said maybe that was something Supernatural something eight it could have been it could have been Supernatural strength but it might have just been perseverance Caleb was maybe he he didn't have the maybe he didn't have the physical strength he used to but he had some spiritual willpower he had some ability he knew he had been through some things and he said I'm not going to let this stop me I'm not going to let the weakness of my body stop me I'm going to church I'm going to serve for God serve God good we need you Elders we need you sister Fritz this morning sitting at home we need sister Fritz how me say Amen to that this morning we need women of God who serve God that woman's got a testimon she served God in spite of her husband kicking around I I don't mean to I don't mean to sister fris I know you're watching probably this one I don't want to make you feel bad but but her but her her husband because she believed the message of the hour said I'm not having none of that and so she lived Godly before the Lord all these years all of these years and and helped any way she couldn't and today she I know the devil gets after cuz she feels like she can't do enough but I'll say this God give me a hundred more give us a 100 more to serve God like that I don't care what your age is be like Caleb and stand up and say I'm as able now I may not have the physical strength but I've got the ability to pray and I couldn't we couldn't do what we've done you think this church would be what it is even today and and the things that we've seen without prayer warriors who get down on their knees at night and pray for me and pray for each one of you it's not just her all of you you Elders I know you've been through some things you take that and say I'm as able today as I ever was what would we be without a Danny Ward what would we be without some of you all many of you all start calling names I'll get myself in trouble where would we be without men who stood there with a sword all right stood for the word of God some of you some of you were born in this church went to this church gab was telling me he'd been in this church all his life why do this church stayed open because of men that stood there and said I'm not too old I'm not too tired I I I'm not going to go run after money I'm going to serve God here in Hardy Arkansas so somebody else has a chance for their sakes brother BR said I said well lookie here I'm always took my wife back there by the hand cross the Bible and this Bible in her little bible I said honey I've been too negative I think many of us could confess to that many of us could confess to this I've been too negative the Holy Spirit condemns me within me he talked about Hatty wght and all the things God had done the first and second and third poll I said honey I take your hand by God's help and God's grace never let me be negative again let me walk forth to this revival here to preach like never before let me go here to First sanctify myself and make a way for the people that my own sins my own neglecting be under the blood my own shortcomings be under the blood I might walk out and say follow me people listen to me church have you reached that place in your life where you can tell your kids follow me I wasn't always a Christian I wasn't always serve God but today I can say follow me I'll never forget brother Harold Brown years ago Buster Brown he preached one day and he said he he said he said I reach a place in my life I could tell my son follow me he may not always do it but I can say that follow me as I follow Christ have we reached that place where we can say follow not because I've been good but because I've Sanctified myself I've been born again by the power of God and I sanc myself to the will of God you want to live your whole life and say kids don't do what I did it'll keep you out of church yeah don't make the choices I made it'll keep you out of church make different choices yeah oh that we could get to a place where he say follow me it was hard but do what I did it was worth it church I'm not preaching something I've been there and done that I know what it's like to be scared by your bank account not want to look at it I know what that's like through blessing and cursing I need to follow the will of the Lord whatever happens I need to follow God he said never let me be negative again let let me let me be able to walk out and say follow me
