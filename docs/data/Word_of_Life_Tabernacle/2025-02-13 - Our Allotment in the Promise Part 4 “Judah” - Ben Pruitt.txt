that was tarnished by sin Lord and you came to redeem that soul Lord and one day even our bodies Lord will be redeemed and bought back lord and and we'll be standing in the Glorious light of the liberty of the sons of God we're so grateful for that I pray that you'd move in the service I pray Lord while we're here in these bodies I pray we would worship you with everything that we have give you the praise that you deserve bless those that are sick and those that are in need pray you to help them now in Jesus name amen [Music] amen God bless you Genesis chter 49 and verse 8 Genesis 49 8- 12 as we're going to move on to Judah tonight I'd mentioned something about the Levites but we're actually going to go back to them some point in the future the Lord willing gives us time to do that I just love doing this on a Wednesday night because we've got time to do what needs to be done and I've just really enjoyed this I don't know about you I I've really enjoyed getting into this and something I've never done and uh so it's it's always good to get into the word of the Lord and the word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path it's dark outside it's dark in the world that we live in but we have a word that gives us light and he shows us how to live and what we should be doing we're so thankful for that uh Genesis 498 remember the service Sunday brother uh uh George Moore will be here Sunday morning and Sunday afternoon Sunday afternoon service will be for for married couples if you've been married you're welcome to come but it'll be geared towards married couples Genesis 498 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's welp from the prey my son Thou Art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall Rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah or a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come unto him shall the Gathering of the people be binding his fo unto the vine and his ass's Colt unto the choice Vine he washed his garments in wine his clothes in the blood of grapes his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this evening in the Old Testament inheritance was divided by lot but the oldest uh son would get a double portion and that was called the birthright it's the special uh the special blessing given or the special privileges of being the firstborn so they were very careful uh to acknowledge even with twins who was the first born and who was second as we see with Esau and Jacob because the firstborn had the right to the father's name to carry on the father's business receive a double portion of the father's estate uh but we found in 1st Chronicles 5:1 I actually got a question about this and so we'll go into a little bit of of detail here in 1st Chronicles 51 it says now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel remember we talked about Reuben the first uh Wednesday that I did this he said for he was the firstborn but for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birth right was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright but then he said for Judah prevailed above his Brethren and of of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was Joseph so you see the Ruben was the firstborn but he did not get the birthright his father gave it to Joseph who was the favorite son but Judah prevailed he actually earned the right to be the ruler in Israel oh and I'm so grateful that there was a lamb worthy to be the lion of the tribe of Judah was worthy to take the book and open the seals this is this is good stuff I this will be more familiar to you tonight because it's things probably you've heard about Judah but I believe it'll be a blessing now Reuben was the Natural Choice Joseph was his father's choice but Judah was God's choice choice and and we are God's choice today you may not be the church's choice or even the pastor's choice or somebody else's choice but hopefully you're your husband's choice or your wife's choice but even if you weren't you're still God's choice God's choice will always Prevail it will prevail so God saw something in Judah and put something in Judah that would make him Prevail the word Prevail means to be or to make Superior to achieve something to increase to be strong to Prevail and so God has put something in you you young men God has put something in you to Prevail he's put something in you to overcome right we've talked about how we must overcome and what the blessings that would come the uh to the Overcomer and so there's something in you that God sees that will prevail there's lots of churches there's lots of people but God called you to the message of the hour because he saw something in you oh Church you say well I can't overcome no you can overcome because God called you to this message because there's a prevailing power on the inside of you already so the the the pre the ability to Prevail was in Judah now the name Judah means praise praise from Genesis 29:35 when his mother uh bore him she conceived again and bear a son and she said now will will I praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah and left bearing that word praise the definition of it is literally to throw out the hand to extend Hands In Worship I'm going to go on down a little bit of a rabbit Trail here but it's on purpose because I think it's important that we understand why we do what we do in worship and I know sometimes a song leader will ask you or a pastor will ask you lift your hands up to him and and maybe you feel awkward doing that and what am I doing with my hands up in church well there's a very good reason why that we do that it's a Biblical mode of worship that when she had Judah she said now my hands are going to be up I'm going to extend my hands in worship because he's given me this child and so n none of the other children did she speak that over but over Judah from which that would be the one that Christ would come from the the lineage that Christ would come from would be Judah listen to me he's the only one that we worship like that he's the only one that we lift our hand to I is Christ and so he's the lion of the tribe of Judah and when we raise our hands in worship we are showing our gratitude to him and our surrender to him amen right it's it's a in the Old Testament a hand raised was more than just uh it was more than just a a a show it was more than just something you do CU every everybody else did it but it was it it was a posture that was a response to what had been done right and it was also a vow and a testament you'll find all through the Old Testament I didn't have time for the scriptures tonight we'd be here all night but but here even a good example is Abraham when Abraham comes and the king of Sodom wants to give him some money and he said I lifted my hand to the Lord he said that I would not take any money from you so you because you might say you made Abraham Rich yeah so he said I lifted my hand what was he doing he was swearing a testimony so a lifted hand church when we raise our hands we're saying that the testimony of our mouth is true what are we saying when we worship God when you sing a song he looked beyond my faults and saw my need and your hands go up what you're saying is you're signifying this is true he really did that that means something to me and I'm going to praise him I'm going to worship him I'm going to extend my hands to the king who's worthy of all praise it's not just a form it's not just something we do cuz somebody told us to but that's why a song leader will encourage you it's why a preacher why brother Brandon would encourage the church raise your hands to him because what it does is it it begins to bring an atmosphere of surrender and worship to him it signifies the statement of your lips is true so when you say say Amen to the word sometimes you raise your hand why because a raised hand signifies it's nothing but the truth amen and when sister Hatty Wright said it's nothing but the truth what happened to her she achieved something no human being had ever achieved to speak the word oh my oh my I I just I just love this when we raise our hands in worship things change because praise prevails yeah remember that praise prevails Judah prevails are you with me now because we can't do anything for ourselves come on church we couldn't save ourselves we couldn't make ourselves Christians we couldn't put ourselves in the bride but how do we Prevail by lifting up our hands that's actually how we fight our battles yes and when you come to church many times people think well you know I'll sit here in church and I'll just wait on somebody to speak to me or wait on something to happen or or maybe we're sitting there with cares and worries and things and you wonder how am I going to fight this battle how am I going to overcome this sickness how am I going to overcome this financial trouble how am I going to ever see my kids saved and what you don't realize if you would just open up and praise the Lord and say Lord I believe that you're good I believe that you're going to take care of me I believe you're a Healer I believe you're a savior what would happen that praise would cause a prevailing power to come in your life yeah amen good the closest thinging that there is probably to a church service like what we have a modern church service in the Old Testament is found in Nehemiah chapter 8 when Ezra opens the book you remember the story he opens the book and before the people and he stood on a Pulpit the Bible said right he stood on a Pulpit and opened the book above the people and what did he do he read all day long and the people stood for the reading of the word which is what we do and he read the word and he caused him the Bible says to understand the sense and the meaning of it yeah right so he didn't just read but he preached right and but when he did it the Bible says Ezra opened the book all right Hallelujah in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people standing on the pulpit I guess the only person I've ever heard I would stand on the pulpit would be Kenny caps but I don't know if anybody else ever done it but but you know he stood on the pulpit but you know it was the pulpit would be the platform he was on he was up above the people and so he was above all the people when he opened all the people stood up and Ezra blessed the Lord oh I wonder if we can bless the Lord tonight the great God and all the people answered amen amen amen amen with what with lifting up their hands right so they answered amen and their body body language showed that they agreed right you know we got to be invested in worship you young people understand this like you need to be invested in it when the preacher preaching be invested in it whether you keep notes or whatever that you do watch the preacher and be invested in the preacher what he's saying because it might be something that will change your life might make a difference in your life might make a difference in what's going on around you might make a difference in school might make a difference and maybe the preacher couldn't make a difference but God could cause him to say something that would go right directly to what your need is and and when you're when you're in worship you you invest yourself in it you don't just I've often told preachers If You Preach you preach about the cross and you don't show any passion About the Passion of Christ nobody's going to believe you right why would they if it doesn't affect me why would it affect you on right but it's not just for the preacher right it ought to do something to us when we hear about Christ's death on the cross it ought to bring a worship from our hearts when we hear about it if you preach about I've noticed if you preach about the lamb taking the book and the opening of the word people respond to that because it's something he did for us that we couldn't do for ourselves and so there's a worship that goes with that there's a worship a time of worship that goes with that and so you you invest yourself in that you can't just sit back and say well I'm waiting on somebody to bless me well when was the last time you blessed the Lord Ezra blessed the Lord and all the people said amen amen with lifting up with their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground good yes brother Mark I probably couldn't see hear if you were saying amen from back there anyway but I see brother Mark rais his hand I know what does it signify it signifies that that he's saying Amen to the word of God it means something church when when brother Brandon would speak to the people a and he would he would say now there's a sister back in the back maybe on the back maybe as far away maybe much farther because they were big dimly lit auditoriums full of people and many of them and he'd say back maybe where cathine sitting he said there's a lady sitting on the LA back on the back seat on the second row or whatever that it was and and he'd speak to her or to him and how many times have you heard him say she's going to miss it because he's looking for a response he's looking for a response because if and then many times what he do he said oh God she's going to miss it and then he'd say sister so and so yeah you call her name that get her attention right right and that ought to you know that ought to get our attention if somebody stood up here and called your name and said Brother Bruce you know you've struggled with a certain thing all these years now you're free from it and he called your name out like that what what would that do to you You' you'd respond in such a way saying Thank You Lord but shouldn't we do that to the word hasn't our name been called when the book was open isn't there a response in our heart God it's not old to me it's not something I've just heard over and over again it's not just another Wednesday night but I want to praise you I want to be like Jud I Want To Praise yes sir hey man true not how you thought the night was going to go is it but Ezra blessed the Lord and the people responded amen amen I like that but let's do it more than one amen multiple amens that's right David who was of the tribe of Judah lifted up his hands in Praise look at the scripture in Psalm 633 if if you thought this was a modern invention the way we worship is not a modern thing that's why we don't just change what we do in Worship in the sense of We Still gather together we still sing songs we still hear the preaching of the word somebody still gets up and preaches it we've been doing this for 2,000 years and then way before that God had a a method of bringing people together and a method of worship that's what he desires that's what he wants and so we don't just change that so David lifted up his hands in Praise now remember David was of the tribe of Judah Psalm 63:3 because thy loving kindness that's that's thy faithfulness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will I bless thee while I live I will lift up my hands in thy name so I lift up my hands he said for your faithfulness has he been faithful to you church has he been good to you he he raised his hands up he raised it up before the word he said my hands in Psalms 1948 my hands also will I lift up unto thy Commandments which I have loved come on which I have loved oh that we can fall in love with the word again as brother Stuart was speaking of Sunday night that our children would fall in love with the word and we learn we we love to read it we love to hear it again we love to study we love to talk about it my hands will I lift up to what to the word which I have loved and I will meditate in thy statutes if he could do that on Old Testament law you say well the preaching's tough for the Ben and sometimes brother brandom says things that skin my hi he was lifting it up to a law with no Grace hardly in it at all only Grace to make it another year but he still loved the word of God because it was in his heart to do it hallelujah amen raised his hands in church in Psalms 1342 you say well I do my hand raising at home I heard someone preacher years ago say I do my running at home well David ran in church danced in church and raised his hands in church he said liftt up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the Lord we talk about getting a blessing have we ever thought about being a blessing come we're not just here to to have the Lord bless us but we are here see they understood worship differently than we do they understood that when they come to the house of God that their job was not to be blessed but to be a blessing amen many times that's where our blessing comes from is when we bless the Lord he said lift up your hands he he praised God in church and out of church psalms 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice Jeremiah Jeremiah tells us let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heaven s don't just do it as a show don't just do it because somebody else does it but because it's in your heart to do it that's there was something in judah's heart that caused something about that baby being born caused his mother to lift her hands to the Lord and worship there something about David or was something in his heart he wanted to worship God and I believe there's something in the heart of every born again Christian that you just can't help but you may not be an emotional person but once in a while you just can't help but raise your hands and say Lord you're good to me amen he said what about the New Testament well Paul said I will therefore and men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting yes well the brand many times gave an altar call by raising hands you think well that's nothing I've heard people even criticize that but raising hands matters a raised hand matters sir he said you know what you do when you raise your hand you defy every law of gravity you defy nature do you know that you guys know that when your your hand is not supposed to raise supposed to hang down that's the natural posture right it's for oh church for your hands to hang down but when you get in the presence of God and maybe you feel conviction about something and you raise your hand to him you say Lord I'm sorry what are you doing you're defying every law of gravity you defy nature you defy science when you raise up your hand he said when you raise your hand it shows there's a spirit in you that has come to a place that's made a decision and raise your hands toward your creator it defies scientific it defies gravitation the law of gravitation it raises the hand to accept the Creator that's able to raise it up he said that's what it means did you know you were foreshadowing the resurrection you're you're breaking the laws of gravity one day you're going to break the laws of gravity for good right but that's what you're doing every time you raise your hands in church you're breaking the law of gravity you're defying gravitation to accept the Creator that's able to raise you up good Judah prevailed he prevailed over his Brethren oh my to be the lineage of the king now I want to get and we'll get back to the praise aspect of it after a while but Christ's entire natural lineage was from Judah and it's his rights to be king that are identified in Genesis 498 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee now we we know that Israel's first king and brother Stuart talked about it Sunday night Saul was a benjamite but God's choice was David from Bethlehem in Judah in Genesis 49 And1 again Saul was the People's Choice but David was God's choice said the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be now if you look at judah's life and just him as an individual he seems like an odd choice because he married a gentile woman but the king would too yeah come on it seemed like an odd choice because marrying a gentile woman he he was a a person who you know he had trouble in his family so his sons failed to produce Offspring his first son was killed by the Lord for his wickedness that's what the Bible says doesn't tell us what it was the second son was also killed basically for being scared of dying and and for being afraid that because the way the lever the uh a marriage worked was that uh you had to take up your brother's wife because there had to be seed go on in the family so the second son was unwilling to do that and he died so Jacob only had three sons right so his third son he's like you know we got to be start being careful you ever heard the term Black Widow and not just about a a spider but a a woman that you know everybody she marries dies so a woman here his his uh his son had married a gentile woman named Tamar Tamar and she and then she was the wife of the second one and but she didn't have any children and Genesis 3811 then said Judah to Tamar's daughter-in-law remain a widow at thy father's house so he's basically saying my other son's too young he said let's pray he said Till Sheila my son be grown but he had no intention of giving her to Sheila to his other son so he was going to break what was his duty as a as a father and as a the patriarch of the family to raise up seed by her or to her to his other sons and Tamar went dwelt in her father's house now Judah failed to do it so it's a strange story but she pretends to be a harlot gets Judah to give her his staff and ring as collateral on a payment you talk about dumb I told you he you know he doesn't just seem to be a very good choice right and then the Bible says it came to pass after three about three months after it was told Judah saying Tamar thy daughter-in-law played the Harlot and she is with child by whoredom and Judah said look at that you know it's amazing what people are willing to as long as people don't know what's going on they're willing to just lay the law down Jesus said bring her forth let her be burnt she came she had the staff and his ring she said this the man who owns this is the father I told you it's a strange story she said the child is his Judah say she's more righteous than me she had twins there was something about her she she she wanted to Bear the seed she was something she had a desire for that and she had twins and because that line would become the line the lineage of Christ she had twins and when her first child broke forth it was just a hand and a midwife put a Scarlet streak around it remember to mark the firstborn brother R said because a Scarlet streak spake of redemption yes that the first son of the Virgin Mary would have the Scarlet streak of redemption oh Hallelujah so Tamar becomes one of only a few women mentioned in the lineage of Christ and I just think that's amazing you think about the grace of God that here she was a gentile woman but she had more about her than Judah even had more understanding and things and even he had that this line had to go on there was something in her that cried out for that but it doesn't speak very well of Judah at all the whole episode is a dark mark on his character but during the episode with Joseph that we've talked about extensively uh recently it was Judah began to show signs of leadership during the time that Joseph was in Egypt now you don't lead people by beating them up you don't lead people by forcing people right the the the the only way you can lead people is to get them to buy in to to what you're doing right you do that with words not with force a leader who uses force will not last very long eventually somebody's going to kill him somebody's going to be more powerful than him but a leader who uses Words which is what God uses with us and it's not a brainwashing but it's a it's it's it's a persuasion it's a leadership that comes from uh him speaking to us listen faith comes by hearing hearing the word of God and so you find Judah begins to speak and he begins to negotiate you'll find in Genesis 438 it's Judah who changes his father's mind about sending Benjamin to Egypt it's Judah who's the one who's negotiating with Joseph and you find him I believe it's in chapter 49 and he begins to negotiate with him and when he does all of a sudden it's actually in chapter 45 or 46 and he he begins to negotiate with him and all of a sudden Joseph can't take it no more yeah cuz judah's telling him we've done wrong we messed up all right and immediately oh my immediately Joseph takes puts everybody out of the palace you remember the story and he cries out to him he says I'm your brother sir amen I'm your brother but it was Judah who begin to show a leadership in fact during that time it says Judah and his Brethren so he had already begin to take on that that that that Manel of leadership among his Brethren he prevailed now in Deuteronomy 33:7 he prevailed by his voice listen to this he said this is the blessing of Judah this is Moses blessing on Judah on the tribe of Judah he said hear Lord the voice of Judah and bring him to his people let his hands be sufficient for him be thou in help to him from his in enemies so he doesn't say that much about him as he much was said about him by Jacob Moses doesn't say that much but he said Lord hear his voice I'm so glad I'm so glad that there's a voice speaking that speaks uh washes Us by the water of the word even today I'm glad that there's somebody negotiating on our behalf and it's the lion of the tribe of Judah who does that judah's a lotman in the promised land would be a very rich very wealthy very kingly allotment it would be the largest one in the promised land I'm not sure if I have that map on there or not or maybe on there later and but there's a map I kind of got it spread out there but you can see Judah is the green at the bottom if you can see that far and it's actually uh the much much larger than any other uh than any other contingent or any other allotment that was given to any of the 12 sons of Jacob so you would find in in judah's Place quite literally you'd find lots of of wine lots of uh lots of grapes lots of uh milk and and it was a very rich country it's goes all the way from the south of of Jerusalem uh in Joshua 15:8 says the Border went up by the Valley of the son of hen to the south side of the jebby site the same as Jerusalem and the Border went up to the top of the mountain that lith before the valley of ham Westward it sounds like a pretty good piece of land doesn't it amen sounds like it's going to be really good and really easy but Judah was given a large piece because he was able to Prevail he was given a large piece of land maybe the L it was the largest but also maybe the most difficult to take not just because it's large but because of what was in that land listen what he says he said the valley of henm Westward which is at the end of the Valley of the Giants the Valley of the Giants northward the Valley of the Giants is where the that was the area searched by the 10 spies you remember the 10 spies I hope I'm not moving too fast for you tonight but the 10 spies that went over into the land Moses sent over and or the 12 Spies rather 10 of them had an evil report two of them had a good report but they went into the land and when they did they went up to heon and they got a bunch of grapes it took two men to carry back right one bunch of grapes you talk about a land so it's literally fulfilling the prophecy to Judah but also there were giants in that same land and numbers 13:27 says they told him this is the giving their report back to Moses said we came into the land with thou sendest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the children of an there now brother random types that he said it was like the Pentecostals going into the promises and finding tongues yeah right cuz remember it's it's the new wine that caused them to speak in tongues the the product of the grapes so the Pentecost went in the promised land just enough to find tongues and come back and said we like the grapes but we just can't take it right we like the tongues and he said they brought back one evidence but it wasn't the evidence there was more in the land than grapes there were giants in the land that needed to be killed but they said we can't do it and so he said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the children of anak there we saw giants and Caleb remember Caleb is an interesting man I don't have time to go into all this history but Caleb is adopted into the tribe of Judah so that was his land they were talking about it's his land he would have to be the one for sure that would fight for that land and so it's even more astounding that Caleb would say would say give me this piece of land because it was the most difficult piece of land there was but remember he had in him a spirit even though he was only adopted in and you and I have been adopted into the family into the tribe of Judah amen the lion of the tribe of Judah he was adopted in but yet he had a spirit about him that caused him to be stirred up to take the land why he was a prevailer he was an overcomer right sir right and that was spoken over Judah he'll Prevail he prevailed over his Brethren yes Oh my he says Caleb stealed the people and said let us go up at once and you see the leadership coming from the tribe of Judah for we are well able to overcome it he didn't say well we might be able to there's a P he said we're well able we're well a and he based that on one thing and that's that God made the promise listen to me church if you believe what God Said that trumps everything else that says anything else different if you believe what God said about your healing you'll accept that you don't have to listen to nothing the doctor says because what God Said trumps all of that why we're prevails we're Overcomers we don't just give in when we get bad news we don't just give in when it's a tough service we don't just give in but we raise our hands and we Prevail we Prevail before God why this is our tribe amen it's spiritual in a spiritual sense yes are you with me now good Hallelujah he says but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought an evil report of the land where which said searching of the children of Israel saying the land which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitant are so in other words it's so big and so vast that we couldn't take all this land there's too much it's too deep have you ever heard that huh the the Mysteries are just just too much for us let's just stay over here on this side of Jordan and raise some cattle but it's your land are you with me now it belongs to you everything that's in the land that's where the the promises lay so we don't stay on the other side of the land eating grapes well we love the grapes we we love the Pentecostal blessings but we want to go on over into the land which is the third pole the opening of the word the Holy Ghost which is where the Holy Ghost leads us in our day are you with me now so the land that each up the inhabitant is huge all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature and there we saw the the Giants the sons of anoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight but despite their evil report Caleb had a spirit in him to Prevail he just couldn't help it have you ever been there church everybody else is saying well we're we're you know everything's going bad and everything's going on come on Church it takes somebody in the family sometimes when you're having a bad day it takes somebody just just step up and say hey we can Prevail we're going to make it it's going to be okay I believe what God Said I don't believe that the doctor's report is right I don't believe that what the people are saying is right I believe what God Said I believe we can have a there's a bride without spot a wrinkle I believe I'm going to make it I believe our children are going to make it when I say I don't want to lose another generation I say that not just I don't want to lose it but we're not going to lose it why do I say it that way because we're claiming them by faith we're not going to we're not going to let them go wow we're a Caleb generation it's time to go in it's time to quit just giving in to the devil say well just soon as they turn 18 they'll run out on you and go out in the world I don't believe they have to right amen I believe young men and women can stand for God you said well it wasn't done in the past well it can be done now and if they do leave there will be a place there'll be such a pull in their heart and desire that they will come back I don't believe we have to give in sir even your children that are already out of the Ark of Safety and away don't give in right don't give in say Well they're always going to be that way you know would take a miracle well his he's a miracle working God so we preached here not long ago his name is wonderful if his name is wonderful he's a miracle worker he's able to do what we're unable to do Hallelujah this isn't much of a teaching message brother Stuart I'm trying trying not to get too excited they saw the works of God the P said they saw the manifestation of the spirit the the 10 that gave the evil report they saw that they saw Great Mighty Miracles being done there in Egypt and everything and started out but it wasn't in their heart listen to me it's got to be in your heart it's got to be more than just saying it's more than just bravado but it was in Caleb's heart that's why I could say it when nobody else said it but Joshua but if Joshua said it I'll say what Joshua said yeah yeah brand said we know Joshua's a type of the Holy Ghost we went over that Joshua is a type of Christ but Joshua is a type of the end time leader as well he's a type of of brother brandom just say it that way he is he's a type of the messenger of the hour and we are he said Caleb is a type of the Bride who stays with what Joshua says so if Joshua said sir we could have we could have church in a certain way I believe it yes I don't care how many people say we can't right if Joshua said God still healed the sick I believe it because Joshua is just saying what the Bible says he just saying what Moses said amen hallelujah as I was with Moses he said I will be with you so they saw the works of God they saw the manifestation they saw all that but it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome listen to me church it's so important we have to overcome sometimes to be here on a Wednesday night you got to overcome tiredness but that's part of being from this tribe yeah right you say well how do I know what tribe I'm from well you're of the Lion of the tribe of judah's tribe because you're his brother yeah you're you're related to him in all kinds of ways right you're his wife you're join heirs with him he's the firstborn among many Brethren he just tied up all the Loose Ends you're you're related to him in almost any way possible oh church he lives within you what is it the lion of the tribe of Judah that goes and prevails yes sir he prevails over oh if we can just see it tonight he prevails over over backd conditions he prevails over lukewarmness he prevails over cooled off churches he prevails over that what does he do he always reaches out his hands to praise right glory to God prevails I don't know what you got going on in your life right now but I believe the lion of the tribe of Judah is within you and the line of the tribe of Judah prevails yes hallelujah amen brother BR said they didn't overcome speaking of the 10 they just come out so they come they were message people they come out but they didn't overcome and Jesus said they perish in the wilderness and they eternally dead every one of them is dead means Eternal separation every one of them WR it in the wilderness but there was two men Joshua and Caleb when it come to The Showdown the obstacles was so great they look like grasshopper side of them and Joshua screamed out with Caleb and said we are more than able to do it why God said so and they were Overcomers they overcome they was the ones that was privileged out of the whole group great organization of people to take the real elected bride into the promised land Joshua and Caleb in the front lines out there as two generals LED them right down to the river and crossed the river over into the promised land why they believed the word no matter what the Bible tells us every one of the other men died in fact all the men of their generation died but there was one left Caleb every other Church might die but the bridal still be in Revival what did Caleb why because he said my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and has followed me fully him will I bring into the land with to unto he went and his seed shall possess it his church his seed shall possess it yeah he was a gentile adopted in the family of Juda he had Faith to Prevail and overcome we've talked about it before many times but his seed would become the one who went in and founded Bethlehem and when they founded Bethlehem that Bethlehem would become the place of the birth of the lion yeah of the tribe of Judah oh church that's prevailing right there right that's prevailing he was a gentile adopted in the family of Judah but he had Faith to Prevail and overcome Joshua 14:5 the Lord commanded Moses so as the Lord commanded Moses so the children of Israel did and they divided the land and the children of Israel of Judah came to Joshua and gilar are you with me tonight you still with me and Caleb the son of jeffan of the kenite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee and Kadesh barnea 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh barnea to spout out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart you know what 40 years old is not that old used to think that was old but Caleb was 40 the first time when he went to search out the land but he was 80 when he come back hallelujah amen but what did he say he said I I brought him word again as it was in my heart listen the the the seventh angel didn't come Elijah didn't come to turn our heads back he come to turn our hearts back we can't always serve God by our head It won't always make sense right it won't always make sense to be a believer It won't always make sense to deny anything that doesn't exalts itself against the word of God it won't always make sense to go to church right it won't always make sense to do what we do but what are we doing we're we're we're we're overcoming we're prevailing over the flesh over the devil what is it we've got it in our heart not our heads oh I believe there's some people here that's got it in their hearts you wouldn't be here if you didn't come on now amen my heart not my head nevertheless he said my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but I wholly followed the Lord my God Moses swear on that day saying surely the land were on thy feet of Tren shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast wholly followed the Lord my God the land you searched out you can only possess what you searched and claimed you see they all went into the land they all heard the same tapes they all listened to the same message yeah come on now right they all listened but Caleb was looking for something he was looking for a home yeah he was looking for a city all right not made with hands he was looking for a place what was it he searched until he found the burial place brother BR said where job was buried and Caleb searches out the land listen to me it's important he searches out the land until he finds the Rapture the resurrection yeah he finds the place of the Resurrection he's searching out the land until he finds Hebron until he finds the place of the resur look Church of that resurrection of the Old Testament Saints look that's exactly what the bride does we're not here to find all the faults and failures we're not looking through the message to find everything that's wrong we're looking through it for a reason we got another Hill to climb we got some Giants to fight and there's a place that belongs to us we will not be happy just just believing in one God we believe in one God but we want the revelation of the Rapture down in our hearts we believe in serpent seed we believe in all of those things but we want the revelation of the Rapture and so we search it out until we find it yes one day we're changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I don't say that'll be a head knowledge he may not even realize he found it but he looked all around and he just said this is mine everything is mine so the Rapture is mine right Hallelujah brother B say what's the matter with Christians tonight is God give it to us but we're afraid to investigate it when you become a Christian you're an heir to every promise in the Bible every promise someone say that with me every promise I got a few more minutes just hang with me he said that's right everything that God promised is yours it's just like a great big arcade now when I say arcade I see these little ones perk up cuz they thinking arcade is something that steals your money or that you you pay $50 for tokens and you take them up there none of y'all ever been in one of those places with your kids it it's it's Casino for kids we've done it I mean you go in there you know and you swipe the card and 50 bucks 100 bucks and it's just gone and then they go to get their prizes and they get like a little plastic top or a little toilet break the little stretchy toy that breaks when you get it in the car you've all been there that's what we think of as an arcade but an arcade the way brother brand was talking about it was a a a covered Street lined with shops that's if you go look it up in the dictionary what an arcade is it's a covered Street line with shops or something like a a grocery store or maybe we a mall or perhaps a uh a Walmart or depending on where you live Dollar General and I hope you're arcade is better than Dollar General but you know how it is sometimes you're just looking for that my wife's perfectly happy with Dollar General you know she can spend just as long in there as she can in Walmart or any of the other arcades when she goes in she wants to find out what they've got she not happy with just walking through see when I go in I go in straight right head right straight to where I'm going if I'm going to Automotive in Walmart that's exactly where I'm headed I've already mentally uh decided which route to take and how busy it is at that time because I'll take a different route if it's if it's a high traffic that's true and which door to go in where to park and you go you get your stuff and you go out but Britney wants to see what belongs to her or what could potentially belong to her so brother BR was telling he said imagine you imagine somebody gave you Walmart yes sir you know what would you do with you know you're just going through there and brother Joe would be up at Walmart tonight I know I need to go to bed and work but I just feel like looking around believe that generator is on clearance don't even matter anymore if it's not on clearance I can take that almost bought a generator the other day cuz it's on clearance I don't even know how to plug it in and I bought a shop vac the other day brother Danny he was on clearance in the middle of the aisle what was I supposed to do you know but I was headed that direction just caught my eye that's how they get me the aisle shopping right in the middle of the aisle Walmart knows what they're doing but if you knew it was yours you just go around and look for it oh Church do we realize what this message is this message is a description sir he just telling us where to find sir the promises that belong to you in the scripture yes Hallelujah we didn't know that psalms 27 belonged to us in the end time until a Prophet come by and said it's a Prelude to a Rapture oh church we didn't know what those scriptures meant but a Prophet come by and gave us the directions and showed us where to find it but it's up to you and I to look around and say that belongs to me healing belongs to me salvation belongs to me that's what that's what Caleb was doing in the land that's what that's what Jacob did that's what Judah did he prevailed he prevailed Hallelujah the I think that's what Christians ought to do do tonight find out what you got if something gets a little high up I can't reach it I'll get me a step ladder and climb up to it if something seems a little Out Of Reach he said in the Bible that God has promised I'll stay on my knees and climb Jacob's Ladder till I reach it CU it's mine God gave it to me if Divine Healing is Promised in the Bible and I'm sick I'll stay there till God gives it to me cuz it's a promise God promised I'd forsake the world he'd give me the Holy Ghost come on you that are seeking the Holy Ghost I know some of you young people want it so bad I'll stay right there till he gives it to me because he promised it if God promised listen to this to give me the desire of my heart it's not even something maybe that you need but it's something you want but it's something that's right you something that's right yeah if God promised to give me the desire of my heart and the desire of my heart is the right thing I'll stay there till God gives it because it's a promise Hallelujah Caleb said as yet I'm as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me brother Danny was 5 years older than you and he stood there he said I'm young yet I can still hold a sword I can still fight a battle he says I'm as strong today as I was imagine what kind of workout regimen he had to be on to be strong for that many years but he knew he wasn't going to be in the desert forever listen to me Church we're not going to be in these bodies forever we're going home right let's go get what's ours said I'm as strong this day as I was the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war but to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anacom were there that the cities were great and fence if so be the Lord will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said what did he do he prevailed he broke the laws of gravity right stretched out his hand and said it's mine it belongs to me oh my that's what praise is now we're coming all full circle now before we close praise is thanking God for victory before The Battle Before the battle you remember in 2 Chronicles 20 josaphat needed a miracle it says the enemy was too numerous for them way too strong for them toight fight and Jehoshaphat being a righteous man a Godly King he faced an enemy too big a son oh my a son of Judah he faced an enemy too big to defeat by natural means but what he did is he got the people in Battle Order yeah a and a prophet rose up among the people and said if you'll give this battle to the Lord he said this battle is the Lord's not yours and immediately he what he did he consulted with the people and he appointed singers come on which is an odd thing to appoint but he appointed singers and praisers hand raisers heo oh church he appointed singers and hand raisers and when they begin to sing and to praise yes the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon Moab and mount seir listen they'd all gathered together against the people of God just like today when all the demons out of the Euphrates River have gathered themselves against the people of God come on church we know that's happening we know what's out there we know the darkness but what do we do we raise their hands they begin to sing and to praise and the Lord set ambushments and they went down there when they got to the battlefield there was nothing but dead bodies right and all they had to do was go and collect the jewels and the riches that were found in the place where the battlefield was oh church that's what we need to do be willing to fight but fight the right way fight with our hands raised right Hallelujah good when John sees that there was no one worthy to take the book in Revelation 5 he be to weep and one of the elders said to John said weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah oh my the reason why he said that the lion have the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof his weeping was turned to praise look what happened he's standing there and and he's weeping because no one was found worthy and then the one told him said hey someone's worthy the lion is worthy the lion of the tribe of Judah is worthy and so the lion of the tribe of Judah turned his weeping into praise yeah right it turned it around now why did he do that how did he do that he did it by becoming a lamb Hallelujah when he looked he didn't see a lion what did he see he saw a lamb and depending on how you look at him when you look at him what do you see we still see a lamb we still see a redeemer but he's the lion of the tribe of Judah he prevailed by overcoming himself yes brother brandom said speaking of John he said don't be brokenhearted John don't weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of Offspring from David he has prevailed Prevail means wrestle with overcome he said oh my the guard of Gethsemane who was he overcoming in the garden himself yes what will Judah Prevail over what will the people in the end time Prevail over what will we Prevail over ourselves ourselves he prevailed over himself Prevail means wrestle with and overcome oh my The Garden of Gethsemane when blood dropped down out of his face he was overcoming what did he Prevail over Giants the giant of the flesh but in doing that see Jesus killed the giant of sin and death by killing the giant of sin he killed the giant of death because then the day you eat through of that day you die he reversed the curse right took us back across the chasm I'm closing in just a minute so he reversed the curse to back across the chasm what happened he killed the giant of death what did Caleb Prevail over Giants what did David Prevail over Goliath yeah a giant yeah who come out and boasted against the people of God day after day he boasted and he said you'll never be able to whoop me but God anointed a young man to go and take that battle to the giant right oh church we don't realize how important that sermon was Sunday night that's important because we've been an anointed in our day to do something we've been not been anointed just to sit here but we've been anointed to overcome our giant what's our giant death sir are you with me now those giants represented death but they said our God Is Bigger Than death our God is able to keep us and able to overcome a giant of death Caleb died David died but when the lion of the tribe of Judah prevailed at Gethsemane he overcame the fear of death and death itself listen what he said and what did he say he said uh he said I beheld low in the midst of the throne the four beasts in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as what as it had been slain but it's standing it has been slain but it's resurrected what does that mean he overcome by becoming a lamb he overcome the giant of death how will we overcome right and be in a Rapture in Our Generation by becoming Lambs yes right are you with me that you just chew on that for a while the lion prevailed by giving up Sir how did he Prevail church he stretched out his hand that's how he did it you want to know how to beat the problems in your life you want to know how to beat I know it's been long on a Wednesday night but just I'm fix the clothes musicians go ahead and come you know how you want to know how to Prevail over the enemy that you're facing right now on stretch out your hands sir amen Raise Up Your Hands by stretching out his hands which is the most vulnerable position that you can be in he prevailed over death it looked like he was beaten the Bible say he was a lamb who had been slain but he wasn't dead because he said I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more amen and have the keys of hell and of death as David prevailed over Goliath for the children of Israel Christ Jesus prevailed over sin and death for us no wonder Paul could say oh death where is thy sting oh grave where is th Victory brother Bram taught us that the bee of death left his stinger in Christ and what did John do now look how it just comes full circle when John sees the book is open just like the children of Israel did he he worshiped all Heaven heard Him worship and when he began to worship what happened he sees the book has open it's been taken and just like Caleb though he can't just rest on his Laurels he can't just watch it open but he said give me the book that is my land that's what belongs to me I went to the angel and said to him give me the little book he said take me unto me take it eat it up it shall make thy belly bitter it shall be in th mouth sweet as honey listen when he open the lamb opened the book he was the only one that could do that you realize brother brandom didn't open open the seals right the lamb opened the seals and when the seal was broke he handed it down to a prophet the seventh angel Messenger to give to us but the lamb broke the seals and the revelation of that causes us to Prevail that's what changed John's testimony from weeping to rejoicing that's why he could go and say give me the open book because he was also going to Prevail he said thou must prophesy again what did he say to Peter Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock what the rock of Revelation I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it why did Caleb Prevail it was revealed in his heart that the word was true his heart had been turned back and we have a revelation that God keeps his word when the church brother Brown said disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her oh church again he says this Satan hates Revelation but we love it how many love it tonight with true Revelation in our lives the gat of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them how it's like this my hands raised I'll face my B we're trying to fight all our battles you don't need that you don't need to do that you trying to say well if this person was better that one was better that one would do his job and they would do their job don't do that it just make you a cynic and a Critic just raise your hands say Lord I believe you I worship you I love you I believe you're God I believe you have prevailed for me Lord I believe you can Prevail in my life over the flesh one day over death itself cuz he wasn't the only one that would Prevail over death but because he he prevailed as the lion of the tribe of Judah one of these days we're going to Prevail Even in our bodies we'll be turned back in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's a hard thing to believe it's a it's a stretch of the imagination but it's absolutely the truth I want to stand there like Caleb and said give me my Mountain this is my focus this is why that's why Satan would love to get us to arguing and fussing among ourselves about different things but this is my focus give me my Mountain I'm not going to go back to another age I'm not going to go argue with
