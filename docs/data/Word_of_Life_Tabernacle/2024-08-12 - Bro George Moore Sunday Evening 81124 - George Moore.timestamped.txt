[46:37] profit hath he that worketh in that
[46:39] which wherein he labor Earth I have seen
[46:42] the travail which God hath given to the
[46:45] sons of men to be exercised in it Heath
[46:48] made everything beautiful in his time
[46:52] also he ha set the world in their hearts
[46:56] so that no man man can find out the work
[46:59] that God maketh from the beginning to
[47:01] the end I know that there is no good in
[47:05] them but for a man to rejoice and to do
[47:08] good in his life and also that every man
[47:11] should eat and drink and enjoy the good
[47:14] of all his labor it is the gift of God I
[47:17] know that whatsoever God doeth it shall
[47:20] be forever nothing can be put to it nor
[47:23] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[47:26] that men should fear before him that
[47:30] which hath been is now and that which is
[47:33] to be hath already been and God
[47:36] requireth that which is
[47:37] passed moreover I saw Under the Sun the
[47:41] place of judgment that wickedness was
[47:43] there in the place of righteousness that
[47:45] iniquity was there and I said in my
[47:47] heart God shall judge the righteous and
[47:50] the wicked for there is a time there for
[47:53] every purpose and for every work yes

[49:18] that if we'll just be honest have been
[49:20] better than others there's times where
[49:24] things are going better than they are at
[49:26] other times now I've been serving the
[49:29] lord for 27 years now and I've been
[49:32] happy ever since the day that he saved
[49:35] me I've been glad to be a Christian
[49:38] every day that the Lord has given me but
[49:41] there's been some days that's been
[49:42] longer than others and there's been some
[49:45] heartache along the way and there's been
[49:48] some trials and some tests there's some
[49:50] ups and downs in this Christian Life
[49:52] Saints there's times in our life when
[49:55] our families are doing better than they
[49:58] are at other times there's times in our
[50:01] life where we like our job better than
[50:03] we do at other times there's times in
[50:06] our life when our marriage is stronger
[50:08] than it is at other times there's times
[50:11] in our life when our relationships with
[50:13] our children are better than they are at
[50:16] other times we got ups and downs in our
[50:19] life we got ups and downs in our family
[50:21] there's ups and downs Even in our church
[50:24] there's ups and downs there's there's
[50:26] there's good times and there's bad times
[50:28] there's heartaches in a church there's
[50:31] blessings in a church there's tough days
[50:34] long nights there's times of Joy but
[50:37] there's times Of Heartache
[50:39] also and all of these things there is a
[50:42] time there appointed for every purpose
[50:45] and for every work under Heaven all of
[50:48] it the good and the bad so if you don't
[50:51] like how things are right now you can
[50:53] just wait a minute cuz things is going
[50:55] to change amen and if everything's going
[50:59] good right now watch out cuz things can
[51:01] change and we find that there's a time
[51:04] and a season for everything and brother
[51:06] Bram says that God's got a time for all
[51:09] things he's got a time as he was to
[51:12] plant corn we got a time we plow corn
[51:14] then there's a time we harvest corn he
[51:16] said the spring rains come the drought
[51:18] through the summer and the rain falls
[51:20] and the Snows he says and you just can't
[51:22] say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow
[51:25] I'll go out and harvest it see there's a
[51:27] lot of things Saints there's a certain
[51:29] time when we plant and there's a certain
[51:31] time when we Harvest and if you try to
[51:33] harvest at the wrong time your crop
[51:35] ain't ready yet and if you try to plant
[51:37] at the wrong time the seed will rot
[51:39] everything is app point at a time and
[51:42] the Lord's timing is perfect but we
[51:45] don't like to wait on nothing amen and
[51:48] and if you try to harvest when you are
[51:50] to be planting you don't have a crop
[51:52] amen and it's the case in God's word
[51:55] listen to this believer position in
[51:57] Christ he says God has set times for
[52:00] season he set seasons for his
[52:03] word and he has times in the scripture
[52:06] here where he says the presence of the
[52:08] Lord was there to heal the sick and he
[52:11] said that's when Jesus was ministering
[52:13] also and he says that the presence of
[52:15] the Lord was there to heal the sick
[52:17] maybe at other times the presence of the
[52:20] Lord wasn't there to heal the sick and
[52:22] we find out that God works everything
[52:25] seasonally
[52:27] now Saints sometimes the presence of God
[52:29] is here to heal the sick sometimes it's
[52:31] not but God is always a
[52:34] Healer now is that right Saints and we
[52:37] understand that God's word is always
[52:39] true but there's times when the presence
[52:41] of the Lord is there it's like in the
[52:43] pool of the Bethesda when they when the
[52:45] when the waters was troubled if you got
[52:47] in when the waters was troubl you got
[52:50] healed amen now we don't have that no
[52:53] more but I I'll bring to you remembrance
[52:55] those two sisters that brother Brandon
[52:57] prayed for in the prayer line they they
[52:58] were Sisters in Christ and one of them
[53:01] had a stomach issue and the other one
[53:03] had a tumor on her neck and if you
[53:05] remember they prayed for him and you
[53:07] remember the one sister she left out of
[53:09] that meeting and she went back and was
[53:11] testifying testifying how God had healed
[53:13] her testifying how the Lord had touched
[53:15] her but she couldn't hold nothing down
[53:17] and she was sick to her stomach and
[53:19] everything was coming back up on her and
[53:21] her husband even told her you're
[53:22] bringing you're bringing a reproach out
[53:25] here testifying how God healed you when
[53:27] it's obvious that he hasn't healed you
[53:30] yes now is that right
[53:32] Saints and he he she was testifying how
[53:35] God had healed her and then he said one
[53:37] morning she got up and the kids had had
[53:39] some toast and had some oats that
[53:41] morning and he said they look so good to
[53:43] her but she said she knew if she eat it
[53:45] it it it' come back up on her it was
[53:47] driving her crazy but she said she tried
[53:49] some anyways and she said boy I'm going
[53:51] to pay for
[53:53] that she eat some of that leftover toast
[53:57] and then a little bit later she eat that
[53:59] leftover
[54:01] oatmeal and a little bit later she was
[54:03] hungry again and she fried up a couple
[54:05] eggs made her a big cup of coffee got
[54:07] her some toast and bacon and brother
[54:08] Brown say she had a gastronomical
[54:12] jubilee oh I like a gastronomical
[54:17] jubilee and she was so excited after two
[54:20] months two months after the prophet
[54:22] prayed for her she' waited two months
[54:24] and got sicker and sicker and she was so
[54:26] excited about it she ran down the street
[54:29] to talk to the other sister and when she
[54:31] got there she thought somebody died cuz
[54:33] she heard screaming and shouting out
[54:35] there right and when she went in they
[54:37] was fluffing back the sheets and the
[54:39] sister said I went to bed last night
[54:42] looking at that tumor and I got up this
[54:44] morning and it's
[54:45] [Applause]
[54:48] gone times and Seasons Saints times and
[54:52] seasons and brother BR said what
[54:53] happened he said the very angel of God
[54:56] that made that promise he said I had
[54:58] nothing to do with it I didn't know him
[55:00] he says but thus sayith the Lord he said
[55:03] it taken him almost two months but he
[55:05] was passing through that neighborhood
[55:08] confirming that word that he
[55:11] spoke see God will confirm his
[55:15] word in his time and in his season right
[55:22] good now brother Brown gives the example
[55:23] of Moses and he said he knew that he was
[55:26] was called to be the deliverer and he
[55:28] was trying to do it his way and it was
[55:31] the right thing to deliver the children
[55:33] of Israel but he was trying to do it in
[55:36] the wrong time in the wrong
[55:39] way now he had the word of the Lord and
[55:42] he knew that he was to deliver the
[55:44] children of Israel but brother Brown
[55:45] said he tried to just jump right in
[55:48] that's right and sometimes that's what
[55:50] we do we see a little something in the
[55:52] word and rather than praying about it
[55:55] and and seeking God's will on we just
[55:57] try to jump right in and do something
[56:01] ourselves see he made the assumption
[56:03] that a lot of us make he assumed that if
[56:05] it was in God's word it was God's will
[56:07] for
[56:09] him but he failed to realize it must be
[56:11] God's time also now believer's position
[56:15] in Christ again brother Brown says as
[56:17] Full Gospel people I think we made many
[56:19] mistakes by looking into the
[56:21] word and say God said
[56:24] this and we fail to find the direct
[56:29] revelation of our life to fit in that
[56:32] program sir you see there's things
[56:35] that's in the word Saints but it may or
[56:38] may not apply to our life and time right
[56:42] now now now God has offices in the
[56:45] church is that right but that don't mean
[56:48] that everybody's called to
[56:49] preach God's got God and that's an
[56:52] office that God put in the church God
[56:54] put Apostles in the church
[56:56] but that don't mean everybody's called
[56:58] to be a
[56:59] missionary amen God put God put speaking
[57:01] in tongues in the church but Paul said
[57:04] do we all speak in tongues there's
[57:06] things in the word that that that are
[57:09] the truth and there thus sayith the Lord
[57:11] but it doesn't necessarily mean it
[57:13] always applies to every situation with
[57:15] each one of
[57:17] us
[57:20] okay now it's such a striking statement
[57:23] to me that the Full Gospel people make
[57:24] the mistake of looking at in the word
[57:26] and saying God said this but they don't
[57:29] have the revelation of how that fits in
[57:31] their
[57:32] life and and so if we read something in
[57:35] God's word Saints it's got to fit the
[57:39] pattern if you read something brother
[57:41] brandham said it's got to fit the
[57:44] pattern with everything else that he
[57:46] said if you read something that the
[57:48] prophet said it's got to fit the patter
[57:50] with what this Bible says see if you
[57:52] take a quote and you try to make it say
[57:55] something that this Bible don't say you
[57:57] got it
[57:59] [Applause]
[58:00] wrong now you can take one thing brother
[58:03] brandom said it and make it say anything
[58:05] but it's got to fit everything that he
[58:07] said and it's got to fit we don't
[58:09] believe in his Bible no more seem like
[58:12] people come up with all kinds of
[58:13] doctrines if they could just read their
[58:17] Bible where's it at in the Bible you
[58:20] ain't going to find the message leaving
[58:22] the Bible
[58:23] behind if you're trying to make the
[58:25] message say something that the Bible
[58:27] didn't say you're making it
[58:30] wrong
[58:32] yes
[58:34] good now if we hear something on tape
[58:39] it's got to fit everything else that's
[58:41] on
[58:43] tape it's got to be the time that he
[58:45] said it would happen see we put things
[58:48] out of place brother Joel right we put
[58:51] things on this side of the Resurrection
[58:52] it should be on that side of the
[58:54] Resurrection or or we put things in in
[58:56] the wrong context and we just confuse
[58:59] the
[59:00] people or we get we get the wrong type
[59:03] and we use a we use a good type but we
[59:05] use it in a wrong way this morning I was
[59:07] talking to you about the I forfeit my
[59:09] rights thing that sounds real cute but
[59:12] that ain't what he
[59:15] said amen we'll take a tape or something
[59:18] he said over here and try to put it
[59:20] together with something else he said
[59:22] over there and maybe we ain't got it put
[59:23] together right
[59:26] and we make him say something that he
[59:28] didn't
[59:30] say now he talks and recogniz I think
[59:34] it's recognizing your day in his message
[59:35] brother Bram talks about they're he said
[59:37] they're taking these tapes and they're
[59:38] they're splicing them they're cutting
[59:41] and splicing them well now we ain't got
[59:43] a problem cutting and splicing tapes
[59:45] today we got a problem copying and
[59:46] pasting
[59:51] today and you can copy something from
[59:53] over here and paste it in over there and
[59:55] copy it over here and pasted in over
[59:56] there and you got all kinds of doctrines
[59:59] amen but we got to read what he said
[1:00:01] before and read what he said after and
[1:00:04] and know what context he's saying it in
[1:00:07] and know why he's saying what he's
[1:00:08] saying and you got to listen to the tape
[1:00:10] before and you got to listen to the one
[1:00:12] after see if you just listen to stature
[1:00:14] of perfect man you get one understanding
[1:00:17] but if you listen to stature of perfect
[1:00:18] man and then listen to Blasphemous names
[1:00:21] you'll get a completely different
[1:00:23] understanding and the two go together
[1:00:26] yes so we can't just take one little
[1:00:29] snippet and run off and build a Doctrine
[1:00:31] on it can we
[1:00:33] amen so I'm so glad God sent us a
[1:00:36] prophet today to reveal to us these
[1:00:39] things he said it's got to be in God's
[1:00:42] time it's got to be in God's season it's
[1:00:45] got to be according to his word it's got
[1:00:48] to be the person he chose and that
[1:00:50] person's got to be
[1:00:52] Vindicated and many times we find that
[1:00:54] we got to wait all
[1:00:57] right and we don't like in this fast
[1:01:00] food super duper Society to
[1:01:04] wait right we want it right
[1:01:09] now now there's a reason for that Saints
[1:01:13] and that's that we have to learn that
[1:01:15] we're helplessly dependent on the grace
[1:01:18] of almighty God today
[1:01:26] I I can't say enough about the grace of
[1:01:28] God Amen I know maybe it's it's it's not
[1:01:32] in fashion anymore we we W talk about
[1:01:35] how good we are but Saints I need the
[1:01:36] grace of God I try to live as close to
[1:01:39] the Lord as I can I try to live as good
[1:01:40] a life as I can I try to be the best man
[1:01:43] that I can but I still need the grace of
[1:01:45] God I got to have it Saints I still make
[1:01:48] mistakes I I still say things that's
[1:01:50] wrong and I do things that's wrong and I
[1:01:52] I need the grace of God today
[1:01:56] sir and I think about brother co uh
[1:01:58] brother brand talking about Papa Cox and
[1:02:01] you you know the story many of you he
[1:02:04] talked about Papa Cox he said he was a
[1:02:05] good old man I loved him he said and I
[1:02:08] asked him Papa why don't you become a
[1:02:09] Christian and he says well brother
[1:02:12] brandom he said I would become a
[1:02:13] Christian when I can get good
[1:02:16] enough and he said I tell you what do
[1:02:18] Papa you look around and find out where
[1:02:20] you can get good enough and then tell me
[1:02:22] where that place is and I want to go to
[1:02:27] he said Christ never came to save good
[1:02:31] men he came to save bad
[1:02:34] men he says and when you think you're
[1:02:37] good he didn't come for
[1:02:40] you he come for save them that knows
[1:02:43] they're bad amen he said Christ died for
[1:02:48] Sinners and that's me Saints he said
[1:02:51] when you think you're good he didn't
[1:02:53] come to die for you right
[1:02:59] now Papa Cox told him said well what
[1:03:00] brother B I smoke these old
[1:03:02] cigarettes and he says I ain't even
[1:03:04] going to talk about the cigarettes he
[1:03:07] said I ain't even going to talk about
[1:03:10] them see Saints you don't get good
[1:03:12] enough and then come to church you come
[1:03:13] to church to get good
[1:03:15] enough oh God glory to God and he said I
[1:03:19] smoke these old cigarettes he said we
[1:03:21] ain't even going to talk about the
[1:03:22] cigarettes amen and then he goes into
[1:03:25] this store he said said they asked me is
[1:03:27] there any difference between Adam and
[1:03:29] Eve and the people
[1:03:32] today and he said are they the same
[1:03:34] physically as we are are they different
[1:03:36] he said no they're not the same they
[1:03:38] said well what difference would there be
[1:03:40] and he says well for one they wouldn't
[1:03:41] have a
[1:03:45] naval because they never they were
[1:03:48] created he said they never was attached
[1:03:50] to nothing and he said so if you can
[1:03:52] look and find a naval he said if you got
[1:03:55] a AAL he said you're Renegade to begin
[1:04:01] with so if you can look down tonight and
[1:04:05] find a belly button you're Renegade to
[1:04:08] begin
[1:04:10] with whether it's the any or an Audi
[1:04:12] Joel it don't matter if you got one
[1:04:15] you're a renegade to begin
[1:04:19] with all right yes sir now that's what a
[1:04:22] prophet said if you were born in this
[1:04:25] world world and he says it shows your
[1:04:27] Renegade to begin with and he said we're
[1:04:30] everyone in the same prison house
[1:04:33] everyone of us is in the same prison
[1:04:36] house every one of us that was born by
[1:04:39] sex is in the same prison house we can't
[1:04:41] help one
[1:04:44] another and he's talking to Papa about
[1:04:47] these things and he says you believe
[1:04:49] that Papa he said I believe it he said
[1:04:51] Christ died for bad men like you
[1:04:56] amen and he said will you accept it he
[1:04:58] said I'll accept it and he says I
[1:05:00] baptized him in the name of the Lord
[1:05:02] Jesus Christ and he said he got up out
[1:05:05] of that baptism and went out and smoked
[1:05:07] a
[1:05:12] cigarette now he wouldn't make it out of
[1:05:14] a message Church alive
[1:05:19] today but that's what the prophet said
[1:05:21] he
[1:05:23] did then in God
[1:05:26] timing in God's time he said he found
[1:05:29] brother brother Papa Cox he smashed his
[1:05:32] back up real bad and he said he was
[1:05:34] laying in the bed right after that he
[1:05:36] was laying in the bed and said they went
[1:05:38] to carry him his cigarettes and he said
[1:05:41] the desire had done left
[1:05:44] him and
[1:05:47] brother and brother Bram said he had
[1:05:49] these old black hands where he was
[1:05:50] smoking those cigarettes and he said now
[1:05:52] he can't even stand to smell of them and
[1:05:55] he said but he put first things first
[1:05:58] don't try to get good he said you're bad
[1:06:01] to begin with and there's nothing you
[1:06:02] can
[1:06:05] do so as long as we're packing around
[1:06:07] that belly button today there's nothing
[1:06:10] we can
[1:06:12] do and many times we're going to have to
[1:06:15] wait on the Lord because there's a space
[1:06:17] of time between the sewing and the
[1:06:21] Harvest between the planting and the
[1:06:23] reaping there's a space of time in there
[1:06:28] and we got to learn to wait on the Lord
[1:06:30] good or bad we got to wait on the Lord
[1:06:32] and that's difficult but if we'll wait
[1:06:35] on the Lord the Bible said we'll get
[1:06:37] stronger in the waiting they that wait
[1:06:39] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:06:43] is that what the Bible said now if you
[1:06:45] ever planted a garden now we can't do
[1:06:48] that in Arizona because we ain't got
[1:06:52] dirt but when I used to live over here
[1:06:55] i' plant a garden and you know you you
[1:06:58] can't plant a seed and go out and keep
[1:07:00] digging it up every day you got to plant
[1:07:03] it and leave it
[1:07:04] alone and you know no matter what you do
[1:07:07] you can go check on it every day check
[1:07:09] on it every day check on it every day
[1:07:11] you can't Harvest it until the fruit is
[1:07:17] ready there's a waiting Abraham had to
[1:07:21] wait 25
[1:07:24] years now you can can get
[1:07:26] prepared you can plant and then get
[1:07:30] prepared he said Abraham and Sarah went
[1:07:32] and they got the bird eye they went and
[1:07:34] got the booties they got all the things
[1:07:36] ready started getting a getting the crib
[1:07:38] painted up they got ready but they still
[1:07:40] had to wait 25
[1:07:42] years amen it's like if you pray for
[1:07:45] rain you better bring an
[1:07:49] umbrella it's like those little women
[1:07:52] did when brother Brandon prayed for them
[1:07:54] and they left out there testifying about
[1:07:57] how God had healed him so much so that
[1:07:59] they they said well you're bringing a
[1:08:00] reproach no they W they were preparing
[1:08:03] for the blessing that was coming they
[1:08:05] were preparing to harvest the
[1:08:10] blessing like the little man that got
[1:08:12] prayed for and and he said praise the
[1:08:14] Lord for healing me he was blind and he
[1:08:16] said praise the Lord for healing me for
[1:08:18] extra extra praise the Lord for healing
[1:08:22] me he was preparing for the
[1:08:27] blessing and he had to wait a little
[1:08:29] while but one day his eyes come open and
[1:08:33] he took off running down the street see
[1:08:35] that little woman she wasn't staggering
[1:08:37] she was strong giving praise to God her
[1:08:40] husband said she was a reproach but she
[1:08:42] knew her season was
[1:08:45] coming right
[1:08:48] now you say this you say well brother
[1:08:51] George I might I hadn't been that good
[1:08:54] during my waiting
[1:08:56] and sometimes when I'm waiting I'm
[1:09:00] pouting I'm
[1:09:02] whining I'm
[1:09:05] complaining I mean I'm not y'all I'm
[1:09:07] talking about me
[1:09:11] here I know y'all got Halos out
[1:09:16] there you say I hadn't done that good I
[1:09:18] hadn't done as good as Abraham did I
[1:09:21] hadn't done as good as those two little
[1:09:22] women did well I I would call your
[1:09:25] attention back to Moses now brother
[1:09:27] brandham said that Moses while he was
[1:09:30] out there on the back side of the desert
[1:09:33] after he' messed up and was C called
[1:09:35] away to the back side of the desert he
[1:09:37] said Moses lost all the hopes and all
[1:09:41] the power that he
[1:09:43] had that's what brother Bram said and he
[1:09:46] said he was thinking that freedom wasn't
[1:09:48] for the children of Israel so Moses was
[1:09:52] called to deliver the children of Israel
[1:09:54] but because of his failures and the
[1:09:56] tough times that he had brother Brown
[1:09:58] said he got out there and he lost all of
[1:10:00] his victory he got out there on the
[1:10:03] backs side of the desert even thinking
[1:10:05] that freedom wasn't for the children of
[1:10:08] Israel yes and he said God made him one
[1:10:12] day in a burning bush and when God sees
[1:10:15] him come along just exactly he revealed
[1:10:17] his plans to Moses and he says now the
[1:10:20] reason Moses had forgot about Freedom he
[1:10:22] says God's promises that he would free
[1:10:24] them but God hadn't forgot his promises
[1:10:27] we might forget God's promises but God
[1:10:30] hadn't forgot his promises and he said
[1:10:33] Moses tried himself and failed and he
[1:10:35] said that's what the church has done
[1:10:36] many times we tried in ourselves to do
[1:10:39] things and we fail to recognize God's
[1:10:42] element of
[1:10:44] time now you say I hadn't been as
[1:10:46] gracious as I should have been while
[1:10:48] I've been waiting I hadn't been as good
[1:10:50] as I should have been I've been Moody
[1:10:52] I've complained I I felt sorry for
[1:10:54] myself I been angry at the Lord
[1:10:56] sometimes that he hadn't delivered me
[1:10:58] Moses even lost his feeling for the
[1:11:01] people the people that he was sent to be
[1:11:04] the deliverer of Moses lost all hopes
[1:11:07] lost all the power that he had and he
[1:11:10] was thinking that the children of Israel
[1:11:12] wasn't meant for Freedom see sometimes
[1:11:15] when you're in the middle of a great
[1:11:17] battle or you're in the middle of a
[1:11:18] great trial you forget that everybody
[1:11:21] else is fighting the same devil too we
[1:11:25] for forget we lose our feeling for the
[1:11:27] other people we start concentrating on
[1:11:29] our problems and where we're fall short
[1:11:32] and the battles we're fighting and we
[1:11:33] forget that that brother next to us or
[1:11:36] that sister next to us is fighting that
[1:11:38] same devil we're
[1:11:41] fighting right we're all fighting
[1:11:43] tonight Saints make no mistake we're in
[1:11:46] a battle here and it might be a better
[1:11:48] time than others but every one of us is
[1:11:49] fighting a
[1:11:51] battle and we can get so involved in our
[1:11:54] battle that we lose sight of the other
[1:11:56] people everybody in here needs
[1:11:59] you we need you every one of us needs
[1:12:03] each other every one of us needs a a
[1:12:06] kind word a helping hand a little
[1:12:10] prayer now there's another trap we fall
[1:12:13] into and that's when we're fighting a
[1:12:15] battle and somebody else is being
[1:12:17] blessed
[1:12:19] amen now you guys just come through a
[1:12:22] meeting and there was a lot of people
[1:12:24] got blessed in that meeting
[1:12:26] but maybe you didn't feel like you got
[1:12:28] blessed the way other people did maybe
[1:12:30] you feel like well everybody else say
[1:12:33] was shouting and running up and down the
[1:12:35] aisles and I I just didn't feel it
[1:12:37] brother George I don't know what's wrong
[1:12:38] with me everybody else was anointed I I
[1:12:41] didn't feel it brother George what's
[1:12:42] wrong with me I'll tell you what the
[1:12:44] devil will do is show you how great
[1:12:46] everybody else has got
[1:12:50] it the devil will try if you compare
[1:12:53] yourself with others that's a recipe to
[1:12:56] be
[1:12:57] miserable cuz everybody else the devil
[1:12:59] show you how good everybody else has got
[1:13:02] it and how bad you got it everybody else
[1:13:05] makes more money everybody else has got
[1:13:07] a nicer family everybody else's husband
[1:13:10] is better
[1:13:12] looking now in Sister bry's case that's
[1:13:15] probably
[1:13:19] true everybody else has got a nicer
[1:13:21] bunch of kids everybody else's kids they
[1:13:24] always clean when they they come to
[1:13:25] church their hair is always
[1:13:28] combed everybody else got a better
[1:13:30] prayer life everybody else has got more
[1:13:32] faith everybody else knows more about
[1:13:34] the message everybody else's family's
[1:13:36] doing better everybody else's kids are
[1:13:39] doing better he they got their teeth
[1:13:41] brush
[1:13:45] too see that's what the devil does but
[1:13:48] he'll never show you the full picture
[1:13:51] he'll never show you the battle
[1:13:52] everybody else is fighting you'll never
[1:13:54] know the the war that somebody else is
[1:13:56] going through at J at their work you'll
[1:13:59] never know maybe they got a good paying
[1:14:00] job but maybe that job's killing
[1:14:03] them you'll never know the battle
[1:14:05] everybody else is facing their kids
[1:14:07] might look like they're doing good but
[1:14:08] you never know the battle those kids are
[1:14:10] fighting amen their family might look
[1:14:13] like everything's good but you don't
[1:14:14] know what's going on you never know what
[1:14:17] people are going through Saints people
[1:14:19] don't tell you everything they're going
[1:14:20] through you never know the battle but
[1:14:22] the devil will point out the good but
[1:14:24] rest sure everybody is fighting a battle
[1:14:32] tonight so we don't get
[1:14:34] jealous of what God's doing for others
[1:14:38] we don't get jealous when God's blessing
[1:14:40] others amen when they're being blessed
[1:14:42] we
[1:14:43] rejoice when they're hurting we mourn
[1:14:45] with them is that right is that what the
[1:14:48] Bible
[1:14:49] said so if you're in a season of trial
[1:14:52] and your brother or sister is in a
[1:14:54] season of blessing then you you can
[1:14:56] easily get a case of the why me Lords
[1:14:58] that's right why
[1:15:00] me am I not good enough am I not a
[1:15:04] Believer enough have I done something
[1:15:07] wrong no it might just be your season it
[1:15:10] might be their season it it it's a
[1:15:13] season appointed for
[1:15:16] everything if somebody else is healed
[1:15:18] and you're still battling with your
[1:15:19] sickness your season is coming
[1:15:22] Saints yes it's just a proof that that
[1:15:25] season's out
[1:15:27] there amen there's nothing wrong with
[1:15:30] you everything's going right it's just
[1:15:33] God's
[1:15:36] time now you find that he can drive you
[1:15:38] so far do you get jealous of the
[1:15:40] blessings and other people's lives now
[1:15:42] now this happened with brother brandham
[1:15:44] now brother brandom talked about how he
[1:15:46] went out to or Roberts and looked at
[1:15:48] this great Cathedral that he had built
[1:15:51] and he talked about how the uh the IBM
[1:15:54] machines was running and how how
[1:15:56] beautiful it was and how it was all
[1:15:58] imported marble and and all these
[1:16:00] thousands of things going on there like
[1:16:02] an assembly line and he said I stood
[1:16:04] outside and I got out to myself and I
[1:16:07] walked around to get in my car and
[1:16:09] something said to me he said it was
[1:16:12] Satan yeah he said but what about
[1:16:17] you Satan said to brother brandom what
[1:16:21] about
[1:16:22] you he said all Rober Ministry come off
[1:16:26] of yours so did Tommy osbor and here you
[1:16:29] are where's your IBM
[1:16:33] machines brother Bram said I'd have
[1:16:34] hated seen my office one little
[1:16:37] typewriter in the corner of a
[1:16:39] trailer one little
[1:16:43] phone he said what about
[1:16:46] you and he said he said Satan told him
[1:16:49] you see God don't trust
[1:16:53] you now this is a prophet of God that's
[1:16:56] right Satan coming to him God don't
[1:16:59] trust
[1:17:01] you oh come on somebody
[1:17:04] tonight and brother Brown said I guess
[1:17:06] that's right and he said just then he
[1:17:10] said I Heard a Voice and said but I am
[1:17:14] your
[1:17:15] portion Oh Glory to God Saints I Heard a
[1:17:19] Voice that said I am your portion Saints
[1:17:23] that's my desire tonight I don't I don't
[1:17:25] care who he's blessing and who he ain't
[1:17:26] just as long as he's with me just as
[1:17:28] long as I'm a Child of God today don't
[1:17:31] talk to me by no
[1:17:33] Crown just as long as he's with me at
[1:17:36] Saints if he's blessing me or if I'm
[1:17:38] going through the trial or if I'm going
[1:17:40] through a heach or if I'm on the
[1:17:42] Mountaintop just as long as he's with me
[1:17:47] Saints just as long as I know that he's
[1:17:50] with me he is my portion he is is your
[1:17:55] portion blessings will come and go but
[1:17:58] God will be with you
[1:18:02] always amen if he's blessing everybody
[1:18:05] but you you're still a child of
[1:18:09] God if he's healing everybody but you
[1:18:12] you're still a child of God tonight if
[1:18:15] everybody else's family is doing better
[1:18:17] than yours you're still a child of God
[1:18:20] tonight and the word is still
[1:18:23] true and your season is
[1:18:26] coming that's good yes sir I had a
[1:18:29] little sister I was up in
[1:18:32] Canada and she came to me and she was
[1:18:37] upset and and she was upset because she
[1:18:42] didn't she didn't have as emotional
[1:18:45] response as all the other young people
[1:18:48] and she was concerned that something was
[1:18:49] wrong with
[1:18:51] her amen see how the devil does it
[1:18:54] amen now this sister's life was
[1:18:58] wonderful Godly young lady just a
[1:19:01] blessing real help to the church but
[1:19:05] because she didn't cry as much as some
[1:19:08] of the rest she didn't feel like she's
[1:19:10] where she needed to be that's the devil
[1:19:13] Saints amen just as long as he is with
[1:19:19] us now brother Brown watch what happened
[1:19:23] here he said believer's position in
[1:19:24] Christ Christ he said God revealed
[1:19:25] himself he talking about Moses revealed
[1:19:28] himself in the burning bush and he found
[1:19:30] out that the very thing that was in The
[1:19:31] Burning Bush was the thing he lacked and
[1:19:34] I think that's a whole lot of with us
[1:19:37] today that many times we try to do the
[1:19:39] program ourselves and failed to get what
[1:19:42] was in the burning bush the direct
[1:19:44] revelation of the will and time of God
[1:19:48] what good would it do you to plant some
[1:19:50] corn out here today this preached in
[1:19:51] January he said what good would it do to
[1:19:53] plant some corn out here today it would
[1:19:55] rot it he said nothing would happen he
[1:19:57] said if it happened to sprout the cold
[1:19:59] weather would kill the germ it wouldn't
[1:20:01] work he said we got to have a season for
[1:20:03] it so then when Moses found out the real
[1:20:06] direct will of God and the time of God
[1:20:09] and the revelation of everything to do
[1:20:11] now try to keep him out of Egypt now he
[1:20:13] says right back to Egypt he went as hard
[1:20:16] as he could go for he knew that God had
[1:20:18] promised
[1:20:20] deliverance and the time of Deliverance
[1:20:23] had come
[1:20:25] amen so Moses knew what the word about
[1:20:28] said about it but then the Lord revealed
[1:20:30] to him it's time now and we can know the
[1:20:34] word Saints we can know what the word
[1:20:36] says about it but we've got to have that
[1:20:39] Revelation now is the time
[1:20:42] right good
[1:20:45] amen so this same man that had once been
[1:20:49] defeated that had once lost his feeling
[1:20:51] for the people now all of a sudden was
[1:20:54] set on on fire yes and he said you
[1:20:56] couldn't keep him out of Egypt then amen
[1:21:00] and you might be struggling today and
[1:21:02] you might be discouraged from the season
[1:21:04] that you're in but all you need is this
[1:21:07] Revelation all it's going to take is God
[1:21:11] to set fire to you all it's going to
[1:21:13] take Saints you say well I'm too far I'm
[1:21:16] so defeated I'm so far down I I I've
[1:21:19] been struggling with this for so long
[1:21:20] all it's going to take is for God to
[1:21:23] reveal to you here's my plan
[1:21:25] and now is the
[1:21:27] time and once he shows you the plan once
[1:21:30] he shows you the time all the devils in
[1:21:33] hell can't stop you from getting your
[1:21:35] healing they can't stop you from being
[1:21:37] delivered they can't stop you from
[1:21:39] claiming your
[1:21:42] family so when you're in the middle of
[1:21:44] something it can seem like the end of
[1:21:47] the
[1:21:47] world now I know none of y'all do but
[1:21:51] but like if you husbands and wives ever
[1:21:53] get into a spat
[1:21:55] oh it's all bad it's just all bad he
[1:21:59] don't love me she don't love me I just
[1:22:02] the marriage is a failure everything's
[1:22:04] bad everything's gone and then 30
[1:22:05] minutes later you kissed and made up and
[1:22:07] everything's
[1:22:10] great all right in other churches not
[1:22:16] here see when you're in the middle of
[1:22:18] the battle everything's going oh just
[1:22:20] everything's wrong everything's wrong
[1:22:22] all it takes is God to set that fire or
[1:22:25] something amen you forget all about it
[1:22:31] then everything has times and Seasons so
[1:22:34] Saints I don't want you to get
[1:22:36] discouraged today tonight if your time
[1:22:39] hasn't come yet because your season is
[1:22:42] coming yes whatever that season is it's
[1:22:47] coming times and seasons and I think
[1:22:50] there's a burning bush experience
[1:22:53] waiting for all of us Moses had to wait
[1:22:55] 40 years on the backside Abraham had to
[1:22:58] wait 25 years brother brandham waited on
[1:23:00] the healing of his stomach his whole
[1:23:03] life and he seen thousands of other
[1:23:06] people worse off than him healed and he
[1:23:09] waited and and people crippled and lame
[1:23:12] and Halt and blind and withered were all
[1:23:16] healed and he
[1:23:18] suffered but there is a season appointed
[1:23:22] for everything under Heaven I'll tell
[1:23:24] you this
[1:23:25] God is
[1:23:26] faithful there's one appointed for you
[1:23:29] also there's one appointed for your need
[1:23:31] also there's one appointed so don't get
[1:23:34] discouraged if somebody got healed that
[1:23:36] don't mean your healing ain't coming if
[1:23:38] somebody got delivered that don't mean
[1:23:40] your deliverance ain't coming if
[1:23:42] somebody got blessed that don't mean
[1:23:43] your blessing ain't coming it's proof
[1:23:45] that it is coming your season is coming
[1:23:49] your time is coming
[1:23:51] Saints yes sir
[1:23:54] good but God's always faithful right and
[1:23:57] you might be struggling with your health
[1:23:59] maybe you've been waiting on the Lord to
[1:24:00] do something for you the word declares
[1:24:03] that he is your
[1:24:06] healer your time is coming maybe a
[1:24:09] family struggling you've been crying out
[1:24:11] for the Lord to come on the scene but
[1:24:13] God's word declares there's a token to
[1:24:14] apply and your season is coming Saints
[1:24:19] you might have been seeking the Holy
[1:24:20] Ghost and everybody around you has
[1:24:22] received it and you're still seeking and
[1:24:24] you might be getting a little
[1:24:25] discouraged but God's word said you
[1:24:27] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:30] and your season is
[1:24:33] coming amen maybe you've been struggling
[1:24:35] with a stubborn spirit I nobody in this
[1:24:37] church I'm sure but others but God's
[1:24:40] word says he's a deliverer your season's
[1:24:43] coming that spirit's gone one of these
[1:24:46] days Saints and maybe you had a
[1:24:48] financial need you don't know how he's
[1:24:50] ever going to get you out of it but your
[1:24:52] season is coming because he's a provid
[1:24:56] Rider he's appointed a
[1:24:58] season but don't forget he's also
[1:25:02] appointed the season you're in right now
[1:25:04] that's
[1:25:05] right the season you're in right
[1:25:08] now the trial you're going through right
[1:25:11] now he's appointed that too the test
[1:25:14] you're facing right now he's appointed
[1:25:15] that too the the physical need you're
[1:25:18] got right now he's appointed that too
[1:25:21] the Bible said all things Romans 8:28
[1:25:24] work together for the good of those that
[1:25:25] love the Lord and called according to
[1:25:27] his purpose Saints the good things the
[1:25:29] bad things the upside and the downside
[1:25:31] it all works together for our good it's
[1:25:35] not pleasant to go through it's not easy
[1:25:37] to go through but on the other side of
[1:25:39] it you see it worked out for your good
[1:25:42] that's right now we TR tend to gravitate
[1:25:45] toward the more enjoyable
[1:25:48] things amen when something's born or
[1:25:51] something's planted or something healed
[1:25:52] or something bu up or something time to
[1:25:54] laugh or time to dance or time to gather
[1:25:57] we we tend to gravitate toward that amen
[1:26:00] but remember we read that the other part
[1:26:02] of that just as important as there's a
[1:26:04] time to die a time to pluck a time to
[1:26:06] pluck up what's planted A Time to Kill
[1:26:08] time to break down a time to weep a time
[1:26:10] to
[1:26:12] mourn all
[1:26:14] things now I'll tell you what that first
[1:26:16] one sounds like a better evening than
[1:26:17] the last one but it's all according to
[1:26:20] the plan of God now 1 Peter 1:3
[1:26:25] he says this we're closing he said
[1:26:26] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:26:28] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[1:26:31] abundant Mercy hath begotten us again to
[1:26:34] a lively Hope by the resurrection of
[1:26:37] Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[1:26:39] inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled
[1:26:42] that fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[1:26:45] for you who are kept by the power of God
