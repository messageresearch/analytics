standing in his presence on holding ground do you believe that tonight it's not the building it's not the earth that we're standing on this this carpet that's holy but we're standing on a holy consecrated place on the word of god today i believe that he's here do you believe he's here today when all else will fail you we serve a god who is bigger than all the failures we serve a god who can stand here today and if there's a sickness among you he can take it out of you right now if there's a doubt or a fear in any one of you today you can leave here with a heart of belief do you believe it today could you bow your heads for just a moment dear heavenly father as we come lord to take your word to the people i ask that you would just move me out of your way move me out of the way of the people let them receive something from you in myself i'm not able i'm not capable lord of bringing the word to them lord but but you know lord what they have need of you know the food lord that they they need for their hungry souls lord and whatever they would have need of right now lord i pray you would just grant it to them they came under expectations they came here to worship you and receive from you lord and i believe they will not go away hungry today i believe that they will be filled with overflowing in jesus name we thank you for these things amen amen are you happy to be in the house of the lord this afternoon i didn't get very many amens on that one are you happy to be in the house of lord on sunday afternoon amen i tell you what i know it's a struggle sometimes but god honors that god honors you know the more you put into something the more you get out of it and and i know most of you i know some of you heard a real good preacher this morning and then some of you heard brother andrew as well and they didn't get that brother ben did they didn't get that did they all right well praise the lord if you've got your bibles turn to job chapter 23 and verse 10 job chapter 23 verse 10. i try not to hold you very long i can't stand up too long i had a little fall and uh but i feel really i actually feel a lot better i tell you i'll tell you this i sit there this morning and i believe sister jane i don't know if is voluntarily or involuntarily but she touched me on the shoulder and when she did i actually started feeling better right then and i want to thank you sister jane for that act of faith and you never know and when she did that i thought of a testimony brother allen's struggling with the drums and things and and i believe you know who prayed for him and such and and uh that came to mind and i thought of that and that'll build your faith you just never know what you're doing when you do something like that you don't know what you're doing for somebody but i appreciate that and i thank the lord for his healing don't you amen job chapter 23 and verses 10 but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food and one more place first peter chapter one we'll read just a few verses there first peter chapter one verse three he said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and glory at the appearing of jesus christ you may be seated may the lord have his blessings to the reading of the word i was just on a little thought today of testings and trials and and they come to us and sometimes they come and and it just gets you down makes you feel the blues just a little bit and we all have them every one of us have tests and trials and brother branham talks about this here he said god doesn't make any difference between his children every son that cometh to god must first be tried or chastised first be tried or chastened corrected child trained schooled everyone not one exception every son he said have you went through trials have you went through tribulation have you suffered persecution then you'll endure these things you are real children of god but when you can't bear chastisement when the rod comes down heavy and you run off and back into the world the bible said your illegitimate children are not the children of god for when a man's born of the spirit of god he expects those things and he loves those things now that's a hard pill to swallow right there it's hard to say in the trial that i love this trial it's hard to say when everything's going wrong i just i tell you what i'm having the time of my life but really that's when god is making something out of you and he says it like this there there was back in the in the medieval times they talked about when the goldsmith would take the gold and he would beat the gold and he would and he would beat it until he could see his reflection in it and that's where i kind of got this thought today if we are in the trial he is beating us and getting off all the all the the the black and things that would smear over the gold until he can see his reflection in us and so many times we look at the trial and we don't think the trial is for any benefit but all things work together for the good to those that love god you say why did this happen or why did this happen well i tell you today i believe it's like this i believe that the trial happened for a reason and i believe according to the word of god we need to counter all joy when we go through the sufferings like that because in the moment it may not feel very good but we'll come out smelling like a rose and i think sometimes brother branham says like this he says i think we ministers making a little too much of a flowery bed of ease for the convert oh come to christ everything is lovely but you see it isn't like that he said in a way he said that's saying that everything is flowering because no christian the bible said all that lived godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions he said if you're not suffering persecutions for christ's sake then there's something wrong can you say amen to that if if the world is just really on your side and telling you how good you're doing and how great you are you might want to check up with the word one time all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions he said if you're not suffering persecutions for christ's sake there's something wrong if the devil ain't after you brother he's got you that's all he said because as long as he's after you that's a sign he hasn't got you yet i don't believe he's going to get you either because i think we've got the devil on the run today because we satan he's always going to try to get in there and remember satan is really good at his job and when he knows he can't get you at one area because you've you've put up the shield of faith in front of you and you've you've kind of you've found out hey this is where satan likes to tip me this is where he likes to get me you really you uh you put some stuff there in front of that you put the word in front of the devil and he can't get you no more but then you realize that that he's got another tactic and sometimes you don't recognize it until after he's already snuck in there and that's where we have to come to the place to recognize and have the faith to overcome at that time he said but it but if he hasn't if he isn't after you he hasn't he a sign he hasn't got you he said so just remember as long as he's blasting at you you're a few jumps ahead of him he said just keep on going but all that live godly and christ shall suffer he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which was before you he said don't go with a hang down face and say well i ought to have done it i guess he said i just can't stand for somebody to talk to me and say i'm old-fashioned i'm this that or the other he said oh you should be exceedingly glad and happy because of it because you can bear the reproach of his name and he said by keeping his commandments it caused you to do that what we hear this morning stay with the word stay with the pure word and if you'll stay with the word it'll make you act odd to the world but that's the way god wants to see you tonight because maybe if you're odd to the world you're exactly where god wants you and because you suffer persecutions you young people at school when they laugh at you for your long hair they laugh at you for your long dresses remember you are suffering for christ's sake but you're just a little just a little step away from a place where you're going to be in perfect unity with christ and it won't you won't be laughed at no more but you will take on his righteousness amen you will be one of his what they have here is just temporary it's glamorous it's something that may look good for a while but remember the end thereof is death it just looks good it's a false mirage brother brahm talked about you go out in the desert and you'll see it looks like you see water and you go and you get to the water and it's not there it looks good to the world to live and sin for a season but remember it's just a false mirage you young people remember when you see it looks good and and they'll make sin look so good advertisements will make smoking look good or it used to and and maybe they'll make wearing these immoral clothes they'll make it look good but remember in the sight of god that is just it's filthy rags but remember today that we are more than able to overcome what satan has in this hour do you believe that we were built for this we were put here for a purpose today he said if you'll ever notice a lily where it comes from right out of the bottom of the slimy pit of the pond and it toils day and night and to get itself to the light but when it gets to the light blooms out the most beautiful flower there is anywhere that's what a lily is it comes up from the dirt of the earth and the filth that's where the jewels are found wrapped up out here in this gold state of the nation where you find gold down in the dirt where do you find rubies and jewels in the muck in the dirt just exactly right that's where we all come from but we know where we are now we can look back and say i was there i was in the bottom of that pond and you couldn't see the beauty yet but now i have come forth and you can see me as the lily and you can see what god has done in my life why because he changed you from what you were you are no longer stuck in the muck and the filth of the pond but you have come forth you have pushed your way through why because you stayed in the word you believed what god said was good for you and you stayed with it he said but he said i'm he said i'm a prospector what does a prospector do he hunts for gold he said then when he does he shines it and he beats it and he smells and he gets it ready remember he has to do that to show the real value and show the beauty of the gold so when you're going through a trial just remember this remember that there is a purpose in that trial there may be something in your life that has to be trimmed off a little bit so that you can become the full beauty beautiful piece of gold that god has for you to be remember it's not just oh flowery bed of ease but there has to be a test before there can be a testimony before there could ever be a testimony of healing you have to go through a sickness before there could ever be a testimony of salvation there had to be someone lost before there could be a savior that had to go through more than any of us could ever bear to think of going through there had to be someone lost for him to come back and save think about it today we think well my trial is too much think about what he went through for you he went through everything for you he was beat and he was bruised so that what you go through is nothing compared to what he went through but we get so soft and and we give up so easy we get we give up at the littlest battle we say well maybe it's not worth being in the message if i have to be persecuted like that but it is worth it to the overcomer to the overcomer will i give the kingdom to the overcomer how many overcomers are here today that's what he's coming for is the overcomer he said see as i said at the beginning you are born defeated you were born a defeated person he said and that that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people amongst defeated creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to victory some way so how do you get to this victory through a test he wants to test you to see if you'll come out remember job had to be tested job was a perfect man you can look and you can wonder why god had to put him through the test but there was a reason for the test to show that he could come forth he said the test is more precious than gold he said you've got to come to victory some way it's just like a lily and he goes through that pond lily again he said there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big pawn lily call it a water lily how radiant it is he said now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right in the beginning the gold was always gold but you couldn't see the reflection in the gold until it had been beat until it had endured the persecution i hope you can see that today it's simple but god has actually put you in this spot to where you're in a world you're in the darkest of ages you are in the one where you're going to suffer the most persecution maybe there's been all kinds of persecution but we see it in this day it seems like the young people especially you fight something that is so much more than maybe they fought 30 40 50 years ago because there is more at your fingertips that will that will discourage you or that can get you in trouble but remember if you can overcome those things you will come forth as something beautiful that god has determined you to become he said remember it'll it'll he said it's black it's dirty he said it's slimy he said in that slime that it's living in yet it presses its way on through the mud and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light how many has come to the light of the age when you stick out of the the mud and into the light when you see the light he said then it expresses what's been hid all the time so in you was a hidden seed of god that you would become but nobody could see it brother jeremy at your worst spot you were always that seed and but that seed had to become something and today you are a seed but you must become more than just the seed the seed must be expressed when it comes to the light oh i think today if we could just understand who you are you were just a seed form but when you saw the light of the age you came forth you said that's what i want that's what i've been looking for the whole time he said you said that's christ that's the word and here i am to receive it and when the light struck the seed it brought forth something beautiful out of a messed up beat up life that you were living he said i think that's an overcomer that once in sin once did things that was wrong he said don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong he said now why look back into that pawn again see why look back into that pond again see what you have now is so great why would you ever want to go back to what you were satan's going to tell you why don't you just go back and live the way you were well i mean i tell you you live in the darkness why would you want to do that church when the light is here to make you live the anointing is here to make the word live through you today he says it like this my god is able to heal me from this or my god is able to take me from this wheelchair my god's able to do this but he said i've accepted him as my healer i've confessed him i've confessed my sins my unbelief confessed that i believe that he is my healer he said let let come let go what may if not well today i will be tomorrow if not tomorrow i will be next year the lord has gave and the lord is taken away blessed be the name of the lord he said oh there it was when they walked into the fiery furnace under trial under a test they held true to the end how many could have the same testimony today when the testing and the trials comes we're going to hold true to the end we are going to overcome this laodicean age he said they held true to the end but god was there just in time just in the spirit of a moment and he delivered them he said he knowed that they were prayed up their sins were confessed he knowed that they had met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent he's only silent to test you he said he's only silent to test you when it seems like your prayers are not getting answered he's still there and he's got an answer for you but he wants to see just how long you hold out let's test you just a little while and see if you're really meaning business with god remember when when buddy robin said i believe it was was there he said he was going to receive the holy ghost you'll find these bones laying here listen to me church it's like this right here he says he says he meant what he said now if i go in back room and i say i'm not coming out of here until i receive this certain thing from god if i stay there two or three hours and i come out well god didn't hear me no god knew i wasn't going to stay down long enough but if you mean business with god then god will be there he said he's only silent to test you he wants to see if you mean business he wants to see if your testimony will hold out can you be true to the end that's what he's looking for he's not looking for a part-time christian yes you'll fall down yes you'll make mistakes yes we'll do things that we regret in life but we got back up and we push forward and nothing's going to stop us from going all the way i'm going all the way with the lord he said to see really what you are what's on the inside of you to see if you really mean from your heart what you're saying with your lips he said let that go deep to see if you mean what you're saying i say i love the lord do i mean what i'm saying i say i'm going to pray more do i mean it i say i'm going to fast and pray and i'm going to read my bible do i mean it remember satan's always there he's a roaring lion he's seeking whom he may devour he's always on the job but remember greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater is he that is in you than he that is trying to take away your joy greater is he than that cancer that's trying to take on your body i'll tell you what greater is he than death because he overcame death he can overcome everything for you but you have to trust in him and stay true you overcome what by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony we must stay with our testimony if i say i'm a message believer i don't just say that to have a title i say it because i've accepted the end time message of the hour i've taken what's true for me i've taken my inheritance today i want to be like job though god should slay me yet i'll trust him i will then come forth as gold i'm not going to be fool's gold i'm not going to get down to the end and give up but i'm going to be real true gold [Music] i believe there's real gold in the building today i believe brother branham said he was a minor i believe he was mining out the gold for the end time i believe there's going to be a rapture for this end time gold where he's going to bring us all together and he's going to take us up there and he's going to look at us and he's going to see his own reflection in you i believe just any day now we'll see him as he is and when we see him he'll look at us and he's going to see us and we're go we're going to look familiar to him because he's seen himself reflected all the time we've got to mean our testimony don't give up when your faith seems weak don't lose hope when you're weak because in the weakest hour his show up when it looked real dark when peter was out there and the waves got real high and he even doubted his own testimony that's when god showed up and he revealed himself to peter when you just feel like you can't go on any farther it's in that moment when he'll show up but if you'll just hang on just a little longer you'll realize who's on the sea with you you'll realize who's in the boat with you you'll realize who's with you the whole time you'll realize when you tried to take your life there was somebody who stopped you then when you tried to become a drunkard there was somebody who wouldn't let you go as far as your buddies went when you tried to cut your hair off somebody stopped you and maybe you did go too far but he was there to tell you i've come to take you home he was there to tell you i'm here and i want you back you are my child don't go down that road that your friends went down don't go the way of satan don't go the way he's taking you it may look flashy it may look glamorous but it's fool's gold to him that overcometh today i believe you're the overcomers in this age he didn't call just all the denominations to overcome but he called you to be the overcomer in this day don't give up when your faith gets weak don't give up when it seems like you're you're nothing you say i'm the least in the kingdom of the lord it don't matter what position you are in the kingdom be in the kingdom it don't matter if you're a doormat at the house of god be in the house of god oh yeah you say well i'm just nothing i i don't feel good enough to be down there with those people oh you're never going to feel good enough with this flesh but inside of you is a seed that is coming forth and through the test and the trial of life is becoming something to god that he sees himself in remember he is the goldsmith and he's standing there and he's beating those rough edges off of you the temper oh yeah the unforgiveness he's beating all these things off of you why because he knows that you need it not because he doesn't love you but brother branham talked about it like this in child training when your son or your daughter would go out in the street and there's a car coming it's not love to leave the child out there and say oh little johnny come back here i'll say jason come back over here and get out of the road son that car is going to kill you know if i love him i'll go out there and get him and because he didn't listen to me i'm probably gonna have to discipline him a little bit but remember it's not out of anger it's not out of hate that i'm doing it it's because i have a love for him and i know that he's meant to be my son and i know when he's in the lowest of times when he doesn't when he doesn't listen to me when he doesn't obey that's when i gotta bring him back to me and i gotta put him through something that'll tell him hey i just want you to know you're still my son i want you to know you're still mine i want you to know today church you're still a son of god you are still somebody thank you jesus just because you don't feel like it just because you feel you can't go on any farther you are more than able to overcome laodicea don't let satan steal your joy he'll get in your mind remember the greatest battle ever fought it's right there don't lose up on your faith don't give up on your faith don't lose hope he's still god and he changes not it's in the midst of the storm when he show up oh yeah it's in the midst of the storm remember there's a song i remember in he's in the midst of our storm he's in the valley we go through where two or three are gathered there i am in the midst if you could ever remember this that though god slays me think about it like that think about come on though god himself would slay me i'm still going to trust him anyway oh yeah it doesn't even seem right it doesn't seem right that that you would serve somebody who would slay you who would knock you down an arch but he had a reason for it you say well it wasn't good it didn't feel good no it's not going to feel good but it's good for you oh yes you know when god put me through a test in life i remember as a teenager when he called me i remember when he called me to preach and i said no and i remember backsliding after that because you know when when you go against god and you kind of back up and you're like i just don't want to do what god tells me to do it almost seems like then he leaves you like his presence has left you and when he left me i didn't know what to do so i got re-baptized and i'd been baptized twice already and i was 16 years old and i'm like i got to get re-baptized again because i can't i couldn't fellowship with god i'd lost fellowship lost connection and i couldn't find god and i saw i got re-baptized and i felt a call and then i thought no i'm not good enough on that you know i couldn't do that i had sinned i was a teenager and you know i thought i was really bad and then i got to know really bad kids and i was pretty good but you know how it is i was raised in a home where we we knew what was right and wrong we didn't always do what was right and we did a lot what was wrong but we we knew what was right and wrong and so little things sometimes to a christian kid is worse than some of the bad things to a bad kid right yeah if you've been live if you've been raised in the world maybe you don't your standards aren't there so you do something and maybe you won't feel bad about it but to a christian kid i remember i chewed tobacco and i and i got it out of my boss's truck and i thought i'm going to chew a little this the first time made me sick it made me real sick because i swallowed some and uh and then well it wasn't so bad i'll chew it again because i was running i was running from something running from a call that i had on my life and i i didn't want to do it but i wanted to be a christian i wanted to be a christian but i didn't want to obey what god wanted me to do so i quit doing that because the condemnation was so bad i couldn't go to church and do that at the same time and i had to go to church because i still living at home and so after that i remember i got into a worse i got into a worse worse worse than that i you know i just almost at that point i could fake religion i could go to church and i could feel the presence of god supposedly if you looked at me i looked like i was getting blessed in church and then but i could go outside of the church and just like that and flip a switch and i could i could act the part of a christian and that's a dangerous place and then i got married and don't get married in a bad condition because god's still going to put you through the trial even if you're married that don't solve all your problems it solves some of them but not all of them and when you're when you're 18 years old and you're still running from god but you think you're doing right well i'm still going to church and i thought i could have a form of godliness but i had never experienced the power just yet and i remember when i finally experienced the power of god it changed me i tried to take a step back and go into the world i tried to do some wrong things and you talk about guilt you talk about shame and it almost was like god had let me do little things and it would just make me feel so bad and i'd get closer to god every time i went i'd go back and then i'd get closer i'd go back and then i'd get closer every time i see my and i get closer to god and finally i got to a point where you know what i lost the desire to be the sinner oh yeah i had to push right the flesh might have still wanted things but there was a spirit there was a stronger than the flesh and when you work to overcome that it'll take years to overcome that sometimes maybe it's not as long for others but it's in the midst of that trial that he's putting you through that he's really molding you into something and if you look at that ring if you're wearing a gold ring on your finger at one time that was just a piece of rock and they had to beat it and beat it and it's just like a diamond right it gets the sparkle from the cuts on it it shines and it gets a glow from the different cuts on the different angles of the diamond remember it had to go through a process of time and beatings and trials and testing but there was always in the mind of god he knew what you would become he saw the diamond before you were ever a diamond he saw you when you was just a piece of rock it looked like just a piece of ordinary glass but he saw in his mind the diamond you would become and i believe today if you can just press on through the battle press on through the times you're going through you young people you may think well i just want to turn back and but remember there's always something there tugging at your heart to push you just a little farther you feel like backsliding remember there's something there to catch you you may make a mistake but he's there to grab you what is it because this morning we heard you're hanging over hell by by a chain by a thread you're hanging over hell by a thread but that thread becomes a chain when you hold onto the word of god remember that chain is there and if you hold on to the word of god with all your heart with all your might with all your strength when it feels you can't go on he'll be there to catch you he'll be there just in time he said i'll be there in the fire with the three hebrew children he said i'll be in the den when daniel's there with the lions he said i'll be there when the flood waters come and i'll have an ark of safety ready he said in the end time when there's all these pestilences and things i'll be there to protect you from them i'll have a bride that can rise above it all we are more than conquerors through christ that loved us there's this quote here and i'll bring it down i i i just about can't stand here much longer he said when it looks like everything has gone wrong god is giving you a trial he's got confidence in you he don't have to baby you around you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid you're a real christian god is giving you a test see what you'll do about it he said no wonder peter said these fiery trials why count it as a joy it's more precious to you than gold and he said many times we him and hall well if i just well that well that's something god gave to you he said to overcome thank you lord we him and hall about it why why why do we have this he said he knows he said he said well that's something that god gave to you to overcome it's for your good if we could ever get through our minds that all things really do work together for the good they really do there is some reason for everything that happens to you everything god makes no mistakes and if he allowed something to happen to you he allowed it for a purpose and that's the hardest things to accept sometimes oh i can accept the blessings i can accept the word i can accept all these things i oh man but but that trial what was that for to perfect you to bring you forth to where he could see his image in you he's testing your faith to see if you hold on to your testimony right he said that's something god give you to overcome he knows you'll do it he's put his trust in you he trusts you more than you trust him i wonder if he doesn't sometimes come on he trusts you we get in a place we think i just can't go on can you trust god can you trust in his word i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you until the end of the world you know when he left he sent his spirit and his spirit he said i said i'll be with you and even in you until the end of the world so he's in you he's with you it don't matter how far you go if you've ever experienced the spirit of christ if he's in you you can't go far enough that he can't reach you you can't do something bad enough that he can't bring you back he's always going to have his have his hand on you it don't matter how far your son or your daughter go from you they're always your son or your daughter it doesn't matter how many mistakes they make when you see how bad they are when they break your heart you say brother joel you've just got little kids wait until they're teenagers they may break my heart but i can tell you i've experienced love from a father and i know just how much he loved me when i did stupid things that i can't believe i did sometimes he didn't ever quit loving me and i can't quit loving them and when they go so far when that prodigal son went so far he was unrecognizable as a son he come back home and guess who did recognize him his father knew who he was his father said come on back home i've made a feast for you come on back i've got a table prepared for you come on home church it's time we quit laying there and feeling sorry for ourselves when the test is over when the battle's done i'm an overcomer and at the end of the day i'm going to sit in my father's house as a son of god at the end of the day i'm an overcomer anyway [Music] i can look back and i can see every test and trial was to make me what i am today i wonder why god did you allow me to become this way in a certain area and then i went through something later in life and i realized i had to be that way to overcome something else so the first trial caused me to be to put up a guard on something in my life and then the next thing you know you go through something oh that's why i went through that that's why i had to overcome that time and then you'll see god's hand in your life he's never left you church he was there all the time you were always in his thoughts you were always in his mind and then you become a manifestation of what was in his mind when you become who he sees in himself when he looks in the mirror he sees you he sees you because his reflection is you if jesus was standing here today and he could look in the mirror he would say i see i see brother malachi in the mirror i see i see brother jeremy in the mirror and you know what you can say well i know what brother jeremy was or i know what brother malachi was well you're looking at the old man but the old man is dead and i have become something that god said i could become i am an overcomer in laodicea i am who he spoke of that could stand the test of time when so many walked away you may give up you may walk away but i'm going to stay with the word for the day you know why because he gave me something that i can't let go of you say brother joel you could let god eat to know because he's holding me he's holding me and i feel like letting go but he's holding on to me jesus is always holding your hand no matter what you're going through there was this quote i run across and i've i loved it i ran across it studying in my dad's old study bible and i was going through this week and i was reading and i saw this he had this printout from i don't know maybe 12 15 years ago and and i was looking at it he said there's one assurance the believer has though the world turned him down yet god loves him the world may call you a holy roller they may call you a fanatic but if you're true to god there's one sure thing god loves you and his angels are encamped about those who fear him he said i'd imagine on every limb all around through the place there was swarms of angels and god came down and said my poor little tired servant he's so nervous and tore up he don't know what to do he said i want to pick out the angel standing here that's got the softest hands don't scare him walk over there and stroke his brow right easy see god knows what you need when you need it he knows when you need the spanking he knows when you need to be loved gently he's the perfect parent he knows how to handle every situation he said and i want the best cook among you and go up there and get all the vitamins that you can find and put in this corn meal the world's turned him down but i'm going to treat him right he said don't get scared of hallelujah that means praise our god he said hallelujah bring forth the best that we got cook him a corn cake and set him down some water and his soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of god on the brow remember if you've done your best god still got those angels in order he loves you just the same as he loved elijah he don't love you any less if you go back to that first quote we read there's no difference he said god doesn't make any difference between his children just because brother branham had a gift god didn't love him more than he loves you just because i'm standing here this morning and maybe you're sitting in the farthest back or you're the youngest child in here you're loved just as much maybe you'll never be called to preach maybe you'll never be called to be any more than what brother branham described as a doormat in the house of god but at least you're here at least you're in the house of god you say brother joel do i have to humble myself to that status at times even the ones who are called have to humble there's times when if i stand here and i've boasted myself i don't have anything to boast of but if i did and i boasted in myself watch god knock you down just a little bit remember god doesn't want you to try to put yourself above him he don't want you exalted above him he wants you to stay in your position but he loves you in your position he loves you just the way you are don't try to be more than what you are just be a good solid christian that believes the word of god i don't know why i'm talking this ain't in my notes but there's something somebody maybe needs to hear this you're discouraged because you're not doing enough maybe you need to do more but wait on the lord let god have his way in your life today god is never out he's never out there and got his eyes off you remember he sees every sparrow if he sees every sparrow if he knows if his eye is on the sparrow then i know he watches me thank you can you stand this afternoon and i wonder if there's someone here that feels like you're not enough his musicians would come remember when you've done your best god still got his angels in order he loves you just the same can you hold on through the trial of your faith i believe if you're here today then you've held on through some trial you've held on you've stayed true to your testimony and god will honor that stand today do you believe that i believe god is going to honor your faith because remember when you've done your best when you feel like i can't go on any farther he's an on-time god don't you believe it today job said he may not come when you want him to but he'll be there right on time do you believe it he'll be there right on time when the storm is at its worst when it feels like all hell is against you he has raised up a standard and he's raised up something to withstand every dart of the enemy today can you take on the shield and the breastplate and arm yourselves with all the things that god has for you today amen if you play something softly can we bow our heads this afternoon dear heavenly father lord this feeble attempt trying to bring a sermon to the people lord lord maybe i haven't done my best today but lord i i want to show the people lord that you are more than able to take control of the situations in their lives today lord lord when it looks like the waves are too high the valley's too deep and the mountain's too high lord there's a faith that has been given us that would move the mountain if necessary that would calm the seas if we just call on the name of the lord today lord if there's one going through a trial today that seems just too much i pray you would just reach down that soft hand send that angel with the soft hands to hold on to them today and to hold them through the trial of your faith oh god i pray you would just reach out to everyone today i believe you got each one of us in the palms of your hand lord you wouldn't lose one of your children but you would be there all the time even when we went through the worst test of our lives lord we thank you for it we give you praise even in the bad times we're going to praise your name even in the hardest of times we're going to hold on we're going to hold on to the faith lord i believe you've healed everyone in the building today i believe you get a give it a refilling of the holy ghost to the people here today oh god if there's one that needs something lord if they would slip their hand up to you this afternoon and say lord deliver me from this trial but lord if it's your will just bring me through the trial and let me come forth as gold in your sight lord and may you see your reflection in me i pray each one would pray that way today in jesus name we thank you for it thank you for the
