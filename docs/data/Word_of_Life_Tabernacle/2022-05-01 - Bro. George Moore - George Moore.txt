best time the the first time we were here and uh certainly excited to get to come back and uh it just worked out to where we could so um y'all just pray for me tonight i told brother ben i said you gave me that coveted time slot right after lunch and uh not only that brother allen got my uh got my wife in some hot water by buying the same vehicle that i have and so i was out there trying to break into his truck uh to get my uh tablet and stuff out of the car and uh couldn't get to couldn't get my passcode to work on his uh car and so uh just about right isn't it amen so but we're happy to be in the house of the lord with you all this evening and uh uh i just you know i got this on my heart and um y'all y'all help me preach tonight i need some help and uh i was just so happy to be off this weekend and and everything just worked out uh just we're going to call it for ordained to the lord i will say i was blessed to hear that message this morning uh my goodness how many of you is blessed this morning my my my i um it's just a masterpiece i told brother ben i said really wish you hadn't preached that before i got up that's kind of a tough thing to follow is the message like that so we'll do the best we can and i just appreciate the lord using brother ben this morning it was such a help to me and uh uh he they act like it was a long message i don't know uh so i think he like took up some of my time or something so i'll try to be uh i'll try to be as quick as possible but we certainly do want to get into something let's turn in our bibles and let's all stand just once again to the book of ephesians the fourth chapter ephesians the fourth chapter and we've got several scriptures that we'll not say several we've got a few scriptures that we'll read today uh ephesians the fourth chapter we'll start there and then also in galatians you'll bear with me this isn't my regular bible like galatians the first chapter of ephesians the fourth chapter in galatians uh the first chapter i've got it marked off wrong i'm sorry bear with me church i've gotten my notes crossed up here okay ephesians 4. i beseech you i therefore the prisoner i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love everybody say love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but unto every one of us has given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ wherewith he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he these he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might feel all things yes and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of faith and the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ amen and galatians the first chapter the sixth verse will read i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that calls you into the grace of christ unto another gospel so paul speaking here saying that he was in shock at how quickly the people had moved from the gospel that he had gave them is that right and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and went per and would pervert the gospel of christ there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that which ye have received let him be accursed and one more little verse of scripture in the book of revelations the 19th chapter revelations 19 and seven revelations 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints yes let's just bow our heads heavenly father we thank you lord for the reading of your precious word this evening lord lord god heavens and earth will pass away but this word will not pass away and every time we open the pages of this book it says the same thing every time lord lord it never changes and lord god we just thank you for that we thank you for solid ground to stand on this afternoon and i pray lord that you would bless this service bless these brothers and sisters of light precious faith lord i pray you to just speak to us this evening lord i ask you to watch over me bind my lips before i speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands now in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you you may be seated and i would like to take a subject this afternoon of how does god lead his church how does god lead his church can you say amen and i'll just call your attention to this that in the book of revelations you'll find that the bride of jesus christ had something to do yes the bride had made herself ready now brother brown said he can't push you in a pipe and pull you out the other end and say blessed is he that overcometh but rather the bride has something to do the bride has made herself ready and the bride was also or she was also clothed in fine linen and so there's a lot of different opinions on what the fine linen is but the bible said that the fine linen was the righteousness of the saints and brother branham said the same and if you look in the message and see what he's talking about he always says it was the righteousness of the saints and in other places he said it was the holy spirit that the bride was clothed in the holy spirit and brothers and sisters if you have the holy spirit in your life it will lead you into righteousness is that right and so we find then that the bride was clothed in righteousness we also know that brother branham taught that the message this message that we hold dear this message that we believe tonight cannot be denominated is that what brother brown said you cannot denominate the message of the hour now he now here's the here's the problem with this brothers and sisters men are building denominations and around this message but the pure word cannot be denominated you cannot organize the pure word of god now there's plenty of organizations being built around the message but the pure word cannot be denominated can i preach tonight now the word of god cannot be denominated now you can take parts of the word and build the denomination out of it you can take parts of the message and build an organization out of it but the pure word to take it all cannot be denominated is that what he's saying amen so we find then that you cannot organize this word and god only has one program and i'm hearing a lot about what god's program is here lately like everybody's telling me what god's program is every everybody's got a program that god has and i just keep hearing that word it's god's program it's god's program brother ben it's god's program but i only find one program in the bible and that's the one i just read to you out of ephesians 4. so i don't know where all the other programs come from but i'll tell you where they don't come from amen and so people are always telling me what god's program is but but i think it's god's job tell us what the program is amen and and he's established well that that uh that we have a program amen and i don't want to discount any of god's program right yeah amen come on i i want all of it i want everything that the lord has for yes amen i don't want to discount any of it so i i but i question this brothers we know that that god sent in the church apostles prophets preachers teachers and evangelists he set them in the church is that right now he did not in anywhere that i can find in ephesians 4 set general presbyters or general overseers or bishops or anything like that amen as far as i can see by the word each local assembly is sovereign yes is that right amen and it's not to be ruled over by any other man or any other group of men or any other organization amen is that the word as you understand yes and so we find then that god appoints a local pastor yes is that right god does amen appoints a local pastor and a local pastor answers to god alone yes that's right amen that's right and that is the program yeah that's right now this program is too simple for someone yeah and you know you hear all the time people say well we we we don't need that no more because we've got the message of the hour we've got the message of the hour now look brothers and sisters i'm just silly enough to preach that if brother braham said it i believe it amen so so everybody so if i want to so if i want to say that i have the message of the hour don't i need to believe what the messenger says yes sir amen so you say well i just want to hear the message no i don't want to just hear the message i want to believe what the messenger said amen and so we find then that paul established brother ben this ministry in ephesians 4 and paul it was it said not once but twice if anybody says anything contrary to this let them be a curse he said if i say anything contrary if an angel from heaven says anything contrary if anybody that says anything contrary than what i've established already let them be a curse now brother brent read to you this morning where brother brown went beyond the curtain of time and when he was beyond the current time he was looking at all those people and all of those people said uh said my precious brother and he said are all these branhams amen they said no these are your converts to christ he said will paul's people be there will peters be there is that what brother being read this morning yeah will they be there he said well then i preached the same message that paul preached amen so whatever paul said brother branham said yeah amen and so he preached the same and so anything contrary to the gospel that paul preached and then by extension the gospel that brother branham preached anything contrary let it be a curse is this message and so we find then that we are resting on that yes sir we're resting on it and brother branham says in his army he presents his army in the form of five offices apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers now here's the important part after with the all with the baptism of the holy ghost now look saints i'll be the first to tell you there's been many preachers that's made a lot of messes yeah oh yeah sure there's been a whole lot of people that made a whole lot of messes listening to tapes too yeah sure what's what's good for one's good for the other yeah i mean we're just gonna point out everybody doing wrong we'll be here a while amen amen we'll be here a while so it's important that the ministry be led by the holy ghost by the holy ghost and that's the part everybody missing everybody knows the quotes and they know what brother branham said but we don't have the holy ghost that are alive to lead us and guide us in these things yes sir amen he said when he the spirit of truth has come yes that's not a man yeah yes that's the spirit of christ yes he will lead you amen amen it's the holy spirit that has to lead the church it's the holy spirit that has to leave the offices amen and so we get so tied up in everything but the holy spirit sometimes yes but the holy spirit with the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word of god amen now people say oh we only want the word we only want to hear but the word of god is in the offices yes that are led by the spirit of god yes amen each one backing one another up amen working together yeah backing each other up not tearing each other down amen lifting each other up lifting it up with him the chief captain not out there in the front up here or back behind but in them brother branham said not not the captain's not leading from the front or back where he's leading from inside he's leading the church from inside so the church isn't led by a group of men or a general overseer or presbyter but it's led from inside by the holy ghost if that's what i say amen and it's led through these offices that he has that if so if you if god's got a program there it is and never has there been a time brothers and sisters never has there been a time of attack on the ministry brother ben that we're seeing today there's a layout to see an ecumenical spirit at work in the message of the hour you remember he said he'll get to where you preachers can't preach anymore oh yeah that's right is that right the ecumenical council he said and so we find the end of this it's such a time of attack on the ministry where's this attack coming from why the attack on the ministry if we believe the message of the hour brother i apologize these are not quotes that i sent these are some that i grabbed on the way out these are the ones on paper uh but y'all y'all can look it up when you get home okay yeah or you can look it up right now i don't care but all right all right but i'm just gonna i'm gonna read to you some of what brother brown said y'all tell me if you agree with it or not okay amen brother brown says in divine healing the message divine healing he says god has set some in the church to be teachers some for different gifts some prophets some different things he set them in a church for the perfecting of the church you all believe that don't you you're taught that that scripture we might try to say it was for some other day we might try to say that it was for some other day but we're only trying to hide behind our unbelief look it up i don't care but i'm reading straight from the message of the hour he said we're he he said we're only trying to hide behind our unbelief yes see we're guilty as people of having a personal preference yes sir we have personal preferences things that we prefer over others some like to have a louder service some like to have a more a more cerebral service so so what we do is we we we find all the quotes where brother graham talked about what we like and it's our personal preference but then we make it say what we wanted to say amen yeah that's our personal preference that's not doctrine saints is that right yeah so we find the quotes that agree with the way we want to see it amen but but jesus told them to believe all that the prophet spoke yeah amen and so we find then he says it's the hide behind our unbelief god's word never changes it doesn't alter it's the same yesterday today and forever now let me ask you something church have we missed the rapture come on have we missed the rapture i hope we haven't missed the rapture i'd like to think that i'm in tune enough with the spirit of god to know whether god's spirit's left the earth or not see that's why people will go right on living and not knowing that the rapture happened because they don't know nothing about the spirit of god anyway amen but i'd like to think the bride is in tune enough with the spirit of god to know that the spirit of god is still here amen that's right and the reason i ask you that's because the resurrection of jurassic's daughter brother brown says but he sets some in the church teachers apostles prophets gifts of healing working in miracles and all those things are said in the church do you believe that i never did say where they'd be set out of the church he set them in the church for the perfecting of the church and to be in the church until he comes again he set him in the church to be perfecting the church until he comes the again [Music] hey man i wish i had to send them to my brothers back there so y'all don't have to take my word for it message go tell god never sent a man lest to give him something to say i'm gonna skip ahead some so we don't have one in morning services again can i go a little deeper gifts 56 brother brandon said god sets them in the church because one would be an apostle the prophet couldn't say you're not it yep or the pastor to the evangelist and so forth but they're all little lines of god that's put in the church for the perfecting of the saints they're all little lines of god put in the church for the perfecting of the saints can we go deeper yeah yeah come on now if you see a man here prophesying and another a pastor one evangelist another a teacher now you can't say you're not it you're not in it because it's just one of them raised off of god he said it's one of them lines it's one of them raised off of god is that right he said it's just one of them raised off of god it all points right back to god that big master diamond don't forget that now saints if you see a gift or an operation it better point back to the master diamond yes sir and if it's not pointing back to it you've got to question where that gift comes from yes yes amen because remember it's got to be led by the holy spirit yes the holy spirit leading the church with these little lines these little rays and they all gotta point back to you thank you can we go a little deeper yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna skip ahead baum and gilead 59 apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists these officers of god sets in the church they're all in operation or should be we cannot bypass one good one and say there's teachers without saying evangelists we cannot say there's evangelists without saying there's apostles we cannot say there's apostles without admitting there's prophets all of them are for the perfecting of the body the saints as far as i can tell i've just set up here and read a bunch of quotes to you amen so if you don't agree with it you're not disagreeing with me now i believe this is pressure event 62. so it's almost getting late enough in the message to where you can listen to it right after 62. brothers and sisters i believe this message from 47 all the way up to 65 anything in between hey man the understanding was a little greater but yeah it doesn't change what was spoken amen now i believe there's a church coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection ministry of perfection saints don't you don't you understand that there's all these offices there's only one office that's under attack and it's the preachers nobody's complaining about missionaries nobody's complaining about teachers sunday school's fine it's only the preacher and i believe there's a church coming into that perfection that ministry of perfection where the offices were the apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists for the perfecting of the church them pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word brother ben yes sir until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the lord yes i believe that and i believe we're nearing that time now i believe so yes so there's a ministry coming is this mine there's a ministry coming and they'll be so in tune why by the holy spirit saying yes yes sir amen brother braham said the blood of jesus christ doesn't bring complexes it brings love amen amen and so if it's led by the holy spirit it leads to the perfecting of the church yes you say you say i only need the tapes now i've heard this a lot i only need these tapes all that we need is on the tapes and that's that's true if you believe what's on the tapes amen if you believe what's on the tapes i'm reading to you what's on the tapes right now yes amen amen so so i'm reading that to you but brother brown said questions and answers dearly beloved uh let's see about the scripture ephesians 4 11 through 13. do we all do we all get the perfecting of saints through the tapes or should we be here where the gifts of the spirit are operating and the different offices of the church to help perfect us our hearts have believed all the word of the lord so the question was asked yes that we get everything that we need from the tapes see these spirits that we're fighting bro joel they're not new there's a time for everything but none of it's new that's right yeah amen brother brown said no they want to come here to the church for perfection why is this so complicated where's this coming from see we get to fellowship with one another here at the church but perfecting comes between us and god the blood of christ is what perfects us in the holy spirit yes that's what brother brown said see see so many times yeah the act of going to church or the act of listening to tapes becomes our religion yes i got cinema life i'm not living right it's all stones i'm not led by the holy spirit i don't have the holy ghost in my life but i went to church and i checked the box yes or i listened to the right tape at the right time and i checked the box amen that's catholicism yes that's works yes amen but but the children of god are led by the spirit of god right thank you lord amen so you ever wondered you say man i wonder what brother branham would say about all this stuff going on today you don't have to wonder i'm going to read it to you you know you can leave here tonight not wondering anymore amen i'm ready all right come on and then you can go home and listen to it questions and answers would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture yeah brother branham will the bride have a ministry for the rapture sure sure yes sir see some of these questions to brother brown and he handles such grace yes sir see if it'd been me i'd be like come on man are you serious yeah brother brown handles everything just the right way amen sure that's what's going on right now see the bride of christ certainly is the message it is the message of the hour see yes the bride of christ sure let's see right here is where everybody stops and they said see right there all you need is the message of the hour amen but brother ham said sure she consists of apostles prophets teachers evangelists give the lord a hand clip of praise here he said is that right that's the bride of christ sure she's got a ministry a great ministry it's the ministry of the hour he says and it'll be so humble he says yes questions and answers now brother branham is it true no one should preach but you brothers and sisters the message don't miss nothing all right amen holy spirit brother is it true nobody should preach but you we have seen your we have seen you ordain men we we don't believe you would do that if it were not if they were not to preach yeah good thinking bill brown said mercy come on man mercy brother sister everyone who told you that nobody's to preach but me i'd sure be a poor subject to god with all that that's what he said no every man that feels a call of god upon his life get into the ministry and start preaching yes sir we need them men of god are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel yes y'all get tired can we go a little deeper i'm just reading quotes i'm just reading the message questions and answers would we still be on fire and preach the gospel or is the time over no keep preaching just as hard as you can preach brother yes sir stay with it i'm right behind you he says yes i perceive that they are the prophet in 53 that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent preacher yes now people don't act like that yeah that's true but the highest office in the five-fold is the pastor amen the most important thing of the day is a good god sent preacher he said god sent very important that's key yeah that's key yeah amen god sent i admire them their gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god it's the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister amen brother ben i got to call those things that aren't as though they were yeah it doesn't feel like a wonderful gift all the time amen but brother i'm just saying what brother brown said he says the most wonderful gift in the world yes it's to be a minister i keep hearing about god's program my new ministry brother abraham said quote unquote preaching is god's program yes wisdom versus faith we've got something to do ourself you've got something to do here's the gospel i know it but if you just sit here and don't preach it what good is it going to do come on now see you got something to do you got to make an effort things that are to be 65. i'm as i'm beginning to get old and now and and know that my days are numbered and now uh know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the lord if he doesn't come in my generation yes what hearst thou elijah 59 if god called you to preach preach if you stand alone preach anyhow god spoke to you stand out there and preach at your god-given right yes amen yes church age i sincerely believe that the spirit of god has been speaking to us not only teaching us the truths of all ages but he has been faithfully dealing with the hearts that they may turn to him that's the reason for all preaching and teaching for it is in the preaching and teaching of the word that the sheep hear the voice of god and follow him yes church age book the church systems will persecute the true bride the church systems will persecute the true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it yes sir yeah come on yeah that's good yeah that's good come on absolutely no matter what your experience is then if something tells you that the bible isn't true that the power of god apostles prophets and teachers and pastors and the gifts of the spirit isn't the same as it was when it flowed through them apostles at pentecost then there is something wrong with your absolute yes amen yeah we'll skip ahead a little bit what does it take to make a christian life brother brown says and when you have these little temper fits and fly out and you tell lies and you proselyte and jump the fences and so selfish with your organization you're so narrow-minded you couldn't hear another minister just remember the holy spirit isn't ticking inside of you this was for you brother joel yeah israel in the church if god can use the tongue of a dumb mule to talk surely he can use a man or a woman that'll surrender himself to god [Applause] thank the lord i've been listening brother joel he's been doing a good job very solid oh man let's move forward people say i don't want to be deceived so i don't want to listen to anybody preaching i only want to hear what brother branham says and so so if you don't want to be deceived your concern is about being deceived you've got larger concerns because that would mean you're not part of the bride so i wouldn't worry about being deceived i would worry about being part of the bride because the bride can't be deceived amen if i go to a baptist church it's not going to deceive me amen if a brother says something i don't quite agree with it's not going to deceive me i'm not going to just walk away and say i don't hear the message of the hour anymore and the people that don't want to hear people preach don't mind watching any kind of filth on tv as long as there's not a preacher now we can watch any kind of nasty movie or any kind of filth on the internet that's all well and good but as long as it's not a preacher preacher amen saints the people won't try to make you pick a side oh yeah you know what this morning that message i heard stirred my heart it helped me yes sir what it didn't do was make me not love brother branham i don't i don't love the tapes less because i heard brother ben this morning i love them more amen because remember this is all just little lines little licks of fire yeah coming off the big diamond amen it's all the same saints yes it works together yes to perfect the bride that's right if it's led by the holy spirit yes that's right amen and it's never been the program of god to crown a king [Music] you remember they had the word of the lord in the days of samuel the prophet they had the word of the lord yes they did but it was you know it was too boring for him that's right one fancy enough it wasn't new enough yeah and they got tired of it and they wanted a king and so they they asked samuel i said you know your sons are not they're not like you and and you know you're getting old and and we'd like to have a king because we won't be like everybody else well the bride ain't like everybody yeah we'll be like everybody else hey man yes we want to have all these programs and all this all this organization we want all that stuff it won't be like everybody else and so so samuel went to the lord and the lord said don't go ahead and give it to them that's fine but they hadn't rejected you they rejected me because that was my way amen amen that was my way see man always wants somebody to look at yes they don't want the holy spirit they want somebody they can look at yeah amen this happens all over yeah and it happens in the message yes i mean there's godly men that get lifted up in themselves and people the first thing you know they get to talking to them and tell them oh brother you're so wonderful and they start believing it amen they start believing it right you know i am pretty wonderful you're right brother i'm pretty fantastic and and so we get lifted up and and then we want to put we want to put too much faith in man yes there's not a man that won't fail you that's right amen and we we can be led to the lord and we can do the very best that we can to live our lives but all of us make mistakes brothers right yes every one of us make mistakes amen i was trying to get in the wrong truck man we all make mistakes we're human amen but there's only one that has the power of infallibility is that right yeah church age book let's look at this we'll spend just a little time here those there are those who say that god's people are going to come together through a collective revelation brother ben a collective revelation amen everybody's got a collective revelation they're trying to sell you in the message right now yes amen everybody look yeah i say everybody i shouldn't say everybody there's a lot of collective revelations in the message and see there's a lot of people that are looking to other people to be their holy spirit there's a lot of people watching a lot of other people and deciding whether it's okay or not well it must be okay because brother so and so does it oh sister so-and-so does it yes sir i had a brother tell me hey it's all right if you see these kids right here go to this youth gathering it's all right i don't care whose kids go to the youth gathering they're not my kids hey man that don't work on me your kids will try to tell you what all the other kids are allowed to do and what they ain't i don't care yeah amen they're my kids i had to go as i feel led is that right as parents you have to do that that's churches you have to do that right as individuals you have to do that it doesn't matter what everybody else is doing yes that's right amen it's all right for some to eat meat but some to eat mean it would be a sin is that right is that what the bible teaches so we're not all the same yeah amen you got to go as you feel led to go and so does the collective revelation those that say that they're going to come together through a collective revelation he says i challenge that statement it's a bald and valid assumption in the face of revelations 10 7. now i do not deny that the people will prophesy in the last age and their ministers ministries can and will be correct i do not deny that there will be prophets even as in the days of paul when there was one agabus of prophet who prophesied of famine i agree that that is so but i deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major prophet messenger who will reveal the mysteries as contained in the word and who has the ministry to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers yes thanks let me let me paraphrase this and say there's only one brother branham all right there's only one word prophet yes there was only there were seven stars yes yes sir in the right hand yes sir right and the seven stars were the seven messengers to the seven ages yes amen and the letter was written to the messenger of the church of laodicea amen amen yes sir yes thus saith the lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be vindicated there is one prophet messenger to this age on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that where there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major doctrine which they all hold together in this church today there's going to be doctrines that we all hold true but we got a little differing opinion on yeah sure hey man right yeah right so so you can't have a bunch of revelation the whole collective revelation he said he said divided opinion lesser points to he says who then will have the power of infallibility which is to be restored in this last age for this last age is going to go back to manifesting the pure word bride that means that we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of paul and i'll tell you who'll have it it will be a prophet as thoroughly vindicated or even more thoroughly vindicated than was any prophet in all the ages from enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the capstone prophetic ministry and god will shoot him forth and he won't need to speak for himself god will speak for him by the voice of the sign amen yes sir amen amen and it is this office remember the the message was to the messenger and the messenger revealed the word is that right yeah so why does everybody got to reveal the revelation the revelation is given we just need to receive it yes amen and so we find then that all the other offices in ephesians 4 should be getting their food the evangelist the missionary the teacher the pastor yeah from this one word prophet yes jesus that's right yes sir amen yes you need to be thankful for your pastor saints amen i can tell you this i wish i'd known brother ben a long time ago he believes this message amen and so that's where the pastor is getting his food from amen from the message of the hour not from another pastor right not from another pastor see there's too many pastors that's getting their leadership from other pastors a pastor shouldn't have influence over another church oh y'all get quiet now come on now a pastor is responsible for his congregation yes amen and each local assembly is sovereign in and of itself we don't have general overseers of district presbyters amen and too many pastors are are afraid to stand on what the lord is showing them they're looking to other pastors with their leadership amen that's not the program the program is to look to the messenger to look to the bible yes yes sir amen amen don't believe this tonight yes amen i'm thankful for brother ben amen we got too many preachers that are getting inspiration from other preachers why is everybody trying to preach this thing you got to be what you are brother joel you ain't nobody else man i can't be brother ben yeah preach come on all right brother joel you got to preach like you preach we can't mimic other preachers amen it gets to the point to where you see groups of ministers they all sound the same yeah yeah we'll just be what we are let's be genuine yes amen let's get our leadership from the lord yes remember it's the holy spirit leading the church yes the holy spirit leading the church there's some brothers it's like a they're uh god makes some of them they're like a surgical knife they go in me i'm more like a dull spoon brother ben now you can do heart surgery with either one of them but the spoon's gonna hurt a little worse we just got to be what we are saying each one of us preacher or not be what you are amen amen that's right amen god's provided way so uh let's keep going in in another little bit here this is uh one of my i guess probably if you got a favorite uh uh this would be one of my favorites in the sumernian church age brother brown says notice here that jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person that's relative to the word for that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church god speaks or he speaks for god by revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but all the though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger yes thank you see it's not a collective revelation saints right it's you and god and are you thankful tonight you have the ability to hear what god is saying by way of the messenger i love this next part he said those who here are not getting their own private revelation yeah that's right yes nor is a group getting their collective revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from god amen now i'm not saying god doesn't show you things god the lord shows you things in the word yeah i hope the lord's showing you things in the world every time you open the word the lord should be showing somebody you're not getting a new revelation only to you amen you're enjoying the blessings of the revealed word for this day yes amen let me skip down just a little bit here in every age we have the exactly the same pattern that is why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry yes let's see i've been told there ain't no ministry but brother branham yeah but brother brown said that the light is then spread through the ministry of others who have been faithfully taught i'm thankful there's a few that's been faithfully taught and and the light spreads through the ministry of those who've been faithfully taught but but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember paul warned the people to say what he said first corinthians 14 37 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord yes let me skip down just a little bit brother said they add here or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the revival dies down yes how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of god the spirit has one voice yes it's the voice of god amen paul warned them to say what he said even as peter did likewise he warned them even he paul could not change one word of what he had given by revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of god by way of his messengers and then say what's been given them to say to the churches yes so the prophet said we need to hear what he said and then say what he said to the church yes sir right [Music] there's the program notice it was a ministry there is a ministry to say what he said yes sir yes to the church god uses men who are called now we do have many that are not called yeah and we have many people that aren't called to anything that's feel the need to give counsel yeah oh yeah come on preach yeah there's a whole lot of folks that are giving counsel that need to be receiving counsel yeah all right remember brother graham talked about the king that got lifted up and he went in and tried to take a minister's place is that right yes and he rebuked the full gospel businessmen but because he said you're you're successful in your business he said but but that don't mean you need to be preaching yeah because you're successful in your business he said you got to be what god called you to be amen and he said you should always let a minister do that preaching because as oral roberts said it's hard enough to keep the thing clear by ministers let alone by men who has not called for that office see you should have men there that knows and are ordained for the work he says that's right let's break it down just a little all further the only way we can keep it all straight is to believe what the prophet spoke yes just believe what the prophet's book amen anywhere you see where people get off it's because somewhere another there was unbelief in what the prophet spoke sure yes this makes sense tonight and god deals with individuals that doesn't mean that he doesn't have ministers to speak it means that the pastor can get up and preach the message that god lays on his heart but it's up to you to receive it it's our job to receive what the messenger says yes amen so anybody can preach it doesn't do any good unless you receive what's been given that's an individual and so people take things that are natural and are pure and are organic they take these things that that you should do if you're a believer and you love the lord and your minds on the things of god there's just things that just happen you don't have to think about growing wool you just do grow wool because you're a sheep yes and there's natural things that are just organic that should just naturally happen yeah and we take things that are natural and organic and we set up organisms around them and we make it a work yeah amen i'll give you a great example it's a good thing to spend time in prayer or or or meditation on the things of the lord would you agree to that yes it's a great it's a good thing to do you as a christian as a believer you should just you get up in the morning and and you know you the holy spirit's there with you and you're just thinking on the things the lord and you know it's kind of quiet and you know the house is still kind of quiet the kids aren't up yet and you're just meditating on the things of the lord everybody know what i'm talking about here or maybe at night time after everybody goes to bed and and you're just sitting right there and you know you've prayed and you're just thanking god for what he's done for you and you're just thanking the lord for your life and and and thanking him for your kids and or whatever we're talking to the lord about you're just having fellowship having communion with the lord let's see we take things like that and we take that quiet time before the lord and we make it a doctrine yeah and then it becomes the word yeah you got to do this every day you got to do it every day from this time to this time and if you're not doing it this day and this time to this time then then you're probably not where you need to be and it becomes a legalism instead of a love yes sir it becomes something you do because you have to not something you do out of love because you want to and when there's legalism there's condemnation and then so oh my goodness i miss my quiet time today i'm not a good believer i'm not where i need to be lord help me we take things that are natural and are organic and we do because we love the lord and we make rituals out of them we make it a ritual we make it a work it doesn't come that way saints it comes out of love you can't make yourself pray through yeah you can't you you the lord does that amen you can't make the lord show you something yeah the lord does that when he will he's sovereign yes amen i remember preaching i think it might have been i think it might have been it might have been becky's wedding brother ben and we were down was it was that like a presbyterian church or something yeah luther lutheran church i remember walking up behind the pulpit and grabbing some piece of paper back there and i got to looking at it and it was the program for the church at this lutheran church and the program had everything laid out so it had like song number one such and such song number two such and such song number three special then it had like brother ben two and a half hours and then [Laughter] and then at the end it had it had alter service and then at the end of that it had response and anointing the church had scheduled when the anointing comes sanctuary come on they had scheduled anointing brother ben so so the lord was welcomed there yeah from 11 50 to 11 55. that's when the anointing comes yeah let's see we get that way sometimes we get so legalistic in how we do things that we get so rigid in how we do things you know brother branham kept a little book on him he said and when the lord gave him something write it down yeah amen if you're thinking about the things of god all the time the lord will just give you stuff amen yeah just be thinking about the things the lord the lord will show you some of you right now but see we can take those things that are natural and organic and done out of love and we can make it into something that's not yes to where we're trying to force that yes amen yeah come on it's good that's good this is not it's no we're not catholic we don't say hail mary's and we don't schedule when the lord blesses yeah amen we're believers yes we live this life not because we're made to because we love him yes we love him we want to serve him yes we do what we do because we love the amen i'm not doing this because i'm scared he'll send me to hell i love him for saving my soul i love him for changing my life the response and anointing yes sir people can take their pastor and make him an idol they can take their church and make it their salvation yeah they're going it's all right i'm going to this church this is the right church to go to it's an individual affair no matter what church you go to the church doesn't save you your pastor doesn't save you amen you're not an okay brother because you go to this brother's church amen yeah you know there were so many doctrines that i heard when i come in the message i keep in mind i never went to church a day in my life until i walked into a message church so all i know is the message and uh i remember when i came in it was a doctrine that there was three tapes that you played for somebody you ever heard this one there was three tapes you played for somebody and if they were bribed it was three tapes you played uh uh doors and door how the angel came to me in his commission and life story the one in california and if you pray if you play those three tapes if they were bribed they'd catch it that's a pretty good doctrine right there and then i got to thinking and so i you know when you come in you just assume everybody's telling you the truth and you assume everybody believes the same way but then i got to hearing about people that come in listening to the church ages or people that come in listening to c.o.d or somebody that read the seals and it opened their eyes and i thought well how in the world could they be believers they didn't listen to these three tapes where do we get this stuff saint where do we get this stuff when i when i first came in the message i said you i was told you do not pay for a dog because the opposite don't let the price of a dog come under your roof so if any of y'all bought a dog at any time we can't have fellowship i had a young man kept quoting to me matt fluger you remember matt he always quoted to me well brother branham said if you're going to be a bomb don't you ever work a day in your life there was anything that brother brown said that he could hear he said and i said i finally told him one day i said that's uh just go uh go pull that quote up for me and bring it yes go pull me that quota and he went about an hour later he come back he said i can't find it i said no you won't find it brother billy paul said that yeah brother billy paul said brother brent said that now i believe that's the truth yeah yeah but we got to be careful basing our thoughts and ideas on people's testimonies yes we got to be we got to base our thoughts and ideas on pure word yes amen and testimonies are wonderful and i love to hear them but i can't base my salvation on it amen and i i'm sure there's a lot of things that brother brown told a lot of people and if brother branham told me something you better know i tell you yeah if i could amen yeah so i don't fault people for giving their testimony we just can't take a testimony and turn it into a doctrine it's just a testimony and there's things that apply only to certain people and certain individuals amen if it applied to the bride it'd be on the tape [Music] yeah yes sir comforter brother brown says this i noticed coming up i just want to emphasize this brother brown's approach was so different than what we see in the message today so difference [Music] i notice coming up brother brown says the last couple of days coming from the hospital that there's a tent erected down here on the pennsylvania railroad lot it's it's it's been i believe between 9th and 10th street down here off of spring coming up there and i i said uh it had a sign said sign said gift ministry i i don't know the brother i don't know as i ever met him yeah but he's a brother and he's here in the city holding a meeting and i know i know what it means to go into a city and perhaps a city of this size and with no somebody holding back i i don't know him and he's never asked me to say this but i believe it'd be real nice if all you people wanting something somewhere to go if you'd go down here if you'd go down here our brother preached the gospel he's got to be one of christ's children or he wouldn't be out putting up this tent in this cool september weather trying to do something for our lord so this week visit our brother down there and listen to him preach brother branham's approach was to send his people down to a brother he'd never even met yeah never heard preach didn't know anything about he just saw a sign that said gift ministry and said i believe it'd be nice if y'all go down there and support him is that right or wrong now that's a little different approach than we take today why the bride can't be deceived now i'm sure the lord showed brother branham something about you but i'm just i'm telling you what he said yeah amen he didn't say don't you go over there they don't believe it like we do amen they don't they don't worship like we worship they don't got the right instruments in the church yeah they got all these crazy doctrines we we don't want nothing to do with any of that he said i don't even know the brother but it'd be nice if y'all go down there and support him yeah he said i'm sure he's trying to win somebody the lord he wouldn't be here is that right thanks his approach was right yes the prophet knew how to handle every situation yes another quote here brother brown says this and now the thing brother what's his name up here in utica i think brother graham and another brother that's pastoring there a brother shanks and something like that brother sink brother neville says brother snelling brother snelling is the pastor altogether brother stalin is the pastor up at utica now and i think their prayer meeting is on thursday night thursday night now you you know it would be real nice if we would slip up there on thursday night and show these fellas a little fellowship good see and then when brother jackson the time that he has his if we just get a little group of us together and go just keep praying keep digging yeah don't stop just like when elijah told them dig ditches out there yes amen and i'm going to close on this because i still got several things to know but i don't want to want to hold it any longer saints the misrepresentation of the message of the hour is rampant and the people take the quotes that they like to hear yes that tickle their ears and they recite those quotes over and over again without taking the entirety of the message yes and examining all that the prophet said yes and we can't do that right brother brown said that's splicing and cutting and making me say stuff i didn't say is that what he said yes he said they're taking the tapes and they're splashing and cutting yeah amen well we're doing the same thing with with pulling these five quotes that we like yes now brother brown said in the voice of god in this last days he said today one reason the church is in the condition in is because there's so many voices so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god it's very doubtful many would hear the voice of god though it spoke right in their midst they perhaps wouldn't even understand it because it would be a foreign thing to them they have got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day yes now i believe i read this the last time i was here brother brown said that to so many voices yes in the church today that the people would be a doubtful thing that they would recognize the voice of god though it spoke right in their midst yes amen now i've had this very quote quoted to me brother ben to say see there see causation doesn't equal correlation correlation doesn't equal causation y'all know what happened amen so like people they do studies right yeah and and they say all right how many men had a heart attack here all right well how many of you men eat red meat all right well red meat if 80 of you men eat red meat then 80 of you had a heart attack then that must mean that red meat causes heart attacks right come on now they didn't mention that they eat red meat in the form of a cheap greasy cheeseburger and they had the fries and they smoked cigarettes with it right yeah right so causation is not always because of correlation yes right and so we can't take the message and say brother branham said this so this must mean that amen brother brown said there's too many voices so that must mean that we don't need any other voice for brother browns correlation doesn't equal causation but if we read a little deeper into what brother brown said yes brother brown said but there's so many voices today that takes the voice of the lord away from us he said there's the voice of pleasure yes not preaching not the voice of preachers not the voice of ministers the voice of pleasure he said and we live in a pleasure mad nation yes so many people are listening to that where they can go and have a good time yes everybody wants to have a good time as musicians come everybody wants to be entertained everybody wants to uh to to be able to relax and to have have have something done for them that ain't church things we don't come to church wanting to have a good time and relax we come to church wanting to get better we come to church wanting to get something from god amen now he did not say that these voices was preachers he said pleasure was one of the voices he said so many people are listening to that and many of them are professed to be christians some kind of an old rock and roll coming he said they they could just listen to what golly they said well i'm a christian i ought to ought to read a bible verse in the bible today yeah jesus wept he said yeah yes i'm a christian i got to read the bible today that's it's legalism saints oh i got to read the bible today because i'm a christian blah blah blah instead a real christian reads this bible every day amen someone read the bible jesus will they check in the box amen reading the bible don't make you a believer the bible's read all over the world amen now if you're a believer you're going to want to read your bible is that right that's it he says go ahead but they really get down he said but then to really get down and pray they got too many other things to do there's so many voices in the world so many things to attract our attention from god amen so these voices that we're talking about you can't say oh that's a ministry yeah come on well brandon said it was the voices that attracted your attention from the voice of god come on amen we're fine then back to our initial text of revelations 19 the people that were clothed in righteousness made themselves ready they didn't make themselves ready by running everybody else down they didn't make themselves ready by speaking evil of every brother that doesn't agree with them they didn't make themselves ready by going to a certain church or having a certain big name pastor or playing a certain tape or any of those things they didn't make themselves ready by any kind of work sakes the bride made herself ready by examining her life by the word of god for that day it is our job to examine our lives in the auspices of god's word to find the areas that we don't measure up and ask god to bring us to that standard because the bride will be clothed in righteousness not in a denomination not in somebody else's name shall be clothed in righteousness by the holy spirit our goal today our goal this afternoon is righteousness we want to be right and if we're gonna be right we gotta believe it all sake let us not stumble at one word that's in this message saints if you receive a quote and it stirs you up there's something wrong there if there's a quote that offends you there's something wrong there amen the bride how could the word offend the word bride how could it be part of you and be offended in it my hand doesn't offend me amen my tongue offends me sometime amen joel sing us a song brother [Music] it's a beauty life come where the dudes the mercy are bright shine on [Music] can we stand and sing it to us tonight [Music] shine all around us [Music] with our heads bowed in our hearts how many of
