[43:27] out of the way tonight, Father. That
[43:29] that Lord, you'd be the high and lifted
[43:31] up one tonight, God. And Lord, it's not
[43:34] about me or anybody else, Father, but
[43:36] Lord, this service, God, it's about you
[43:38] tonight. And and Lord, I ask, Father,
[43:41] that you would just come. And Lord, get
[43:43] me so far out of the way, Father, that
[43:45] it's not my mind, Lord. It's not my
[43:47] thoughts, Lord, but God, that it's you,
[43:48] Lord, standing before your children,
[43:50] Lord. And Lord, breaking the bread of
[43:52] life tonight, Father. Lord, I ask,
[43:55] Father, that you'd open the channels of
[43:56] inspiration, Father.
[43:58] Lord, may we be sensitive, Father, to
[44:00] run down those tonight, Father. Lord, I
[44:03] I don't know the needs of the people,
[44:04] Father, but thou knowest all things,
[44:06] Lord. And God, I I just ask you, Father,
[44:09] to just meet every need tonight, Father.
[44:12] Lord, I I thank you, Father, once again,
[44:14] Father, for these people, Lord, that are
[44:16] Lord, here in in this church tonight,
[44:19] Father, here at Word of Life, Father,
[44:21] God, they're just a portion of the
[44:23] bride, Father. But but Lord, we just
[44:25] thank you for them tonight. And Lord, I
[44:27] ask, Father, you'd be their portion this
[44:29] evening, Father. God, may there be a
[44:31] great revelation, Father. Lord, that
[44:33] would Lord set on the heart of every
[44:35] believer tonight, Father. That Lord,
[44:37] your word, Father, it would Lord, it
[44:39] would not only be a head knowledge, but
[44:40] God, it would become a heart knowledge
[44:42] tonight, Father. Lord, that Father, that
[44:45] Lord, you would just, Lord, the eyes of
[44:47] every heart, Father, would come open
[44:48] tonight, Lord. And and God, we'd be able
[44:51] to wage a good warfare tonight, Lord.
[44:54] God, would you grant it, Father? I pray
[44:56] Lord, would you just come and anoint in
[44:58] a mighty way? Anoint the speaker tonight
[45:00] and anoint the hearer, Father. And Lord,
[45:03] I ask, Father, that Lord, as the
[45:04] preaching of the word goes forth, God,
[45:07] Lord, may it fall on good ground this
[45:09] evening, Father. Lord, prepared ground,
[45:11] dear God. And Lord, I ask, Father, that
[45:14] there would be a harvest that would be
[45:15] reaped tonight, Father. Lord, a harvest
[45:18] of joy, Father. A harvest of peace,
[45:20] Lord, a harvest of understanding, Lord.
[45:23] Lord, I ask Father that Lord, you'd make
[45:25] take the broken heart, Lord, and you'd
[45:27] mend it once again tonight, Father.
[45:29] Lord, take the despondent soul, Father,
[45:32] and Lord, settle this fire on fire for
[45:34] you tonight, Lord. And God, I ask that
[45:36] you'd do it, Lord. Lord, we love you,
[45:39] Father. Lord, now, Lord, we stand here
[45:42] tonight, Lord, and we report for duty,
[45:44] dear God. Lord, I ask, Father, that
[45:46] you'd use us as only you can, Father.
[45:49] And Lord, as we end this service
[45:51] tonight, Lord, may we say, Lord, truly,
[45:54] did not our hearts burn within us, Lord,
[45:57] as you spoke with us along the way, how
[46:00] we love you, Lord, and we thank you for
[46:01] it in Jesus Christ's name.
[46:05] Amen. Amen. Don't you love him
[46:08] tonight? I said, don't you love him
[46:10] tonight? Amen. There you are. God bless
[46:13] you tonight. It's certainly good to have
[46:15] each and every one of you here tonight
[46:17] and say thank you for for coming
[46:19] tonight. Genesis chapter 3 verse one
[46:22] tonight. We're uh we were in the vein of
[46:25] thought this morning. Took a title of
[46:26] beautifully broken and we're we're
[46:28] staying kind of similar in that same
[46:30] vein of thought, but we're going to
[46:31] change the title up just a little bit
[46:33] tonight and we're just going to call it
[46:34] the need for a savior. The need for a
[46:37] savior tonight. Genesis chapter 3 verse
[46:41] one.
[46:43] Now the serpent was more
[46:45] subtle than any beast of the field which
[46:47] the Lord God had made. And he said unto
[46:51] the woman, "Ya hath God said, Ye shall
[46:54] not eat of every tree in the garden?"
[46:56] And the woman said unto the serpent, "We
[46:59] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[47:01] garden, but of the fruit of the tree
[47:04] which is in the midst of the garden, God
[47:06] hath said, Ye shall not eat of it,
[47:10] neither shall ye touch it, lest you
[47:12] die." And the serpent said unto the
[47:15] woman, "Ye shall not," He just he quoted
[47:19] the word back to her, but he just just
[47:21] changed one word. Ye shall not surely
[47:27] die. For God doth know that in the day
[47:31] ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
[47:34] opened, and ye shall be as God's,
[47:37] knowing good and evil.
[47:40] And when the woman saw that the tree was
[47:42] good for food, and that it was pleasant
[47:45] to the eyes, and the tree and and a tree
[47:49] to be desired, to make one wise, she
[47:52] took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
[47:56] and gave also unto her husband with her,
[47:59] and he did eat. And the eyes of them
[48:02] both were opened, and they knew that
[48:06] they were naked. And they sewed fig
[48:09] leaves together and made themselves
[48:11] aprons. And they heard the voice of the
[48:14] Lord. I love this now. And they heard
[48:17] the voice heard the voice of the Lord
[48:19] God walking in the garden in the cool of
[48:23] the day. And Adam and his wife hid
[48:25] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[48:28] God amongst the trees of the garden. And
[48:31] the Lord God called unto Adam, and said
[48:34] unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I
[48:38] heard thy voice in the garden and I was
[48:40] afraid because I was naked and I hid
[48:44] myself. And he said, Who told thee that
[48:47] thou was naked? Hast thou eaten of the
[48:50] tree whereof I commanded thee that thou
[48:52] should us not eat? And the man said to
[48:55] the woman said, And the man said, The
[48:57] woman whom thou gavest to me to be with
[49:00] me, she gave me of the tree, and I did
[49:03] eat. And the Lord God said unto the
[49:06] woman, "What is this thou hast done?"
[49:10] And the woman said, "The serpent begiled
[49:12] me, and I did eat." God bless you. You
[49:15] can have your seats for just a few
[49:16] moments this
[49:23] evening, a need for a
[49:28] savior. For
[49:30] truly we know that the devil, he hates
[49:34] two books in the
[49:36] Bible. We know that that we're taught
[49:38] that he hates the the book of Genesis
[49:41] because it shows his beginning. And then
[49:44] also he hates the book of Revelation
[49:46] because it also it shows his ending.
[49:49] So, we know that that here in this in
[49:52] this book of Genesis, we find a great a
[49:56] great mystery laying within the pages of
[49:59] the of this book. And and of course, we
[50:03] know as message believers, we know
[50:05] exactly what took place in this scene.
[50:07] And we're not going to go into that
[50:09] tonight, but but we know that that right
[50:12] here at this at this moment in time, you
[50:16] can
[50:17] identify where sin entered into the
[50:20] picture and all of a sudden man was in
[50:22] need of a savior. And and we find how
[50:25] that how that as sin became amen in this
[50:28] in this picture, it's be to it settled
[50:31] in. And we know that the the Bible says
[50:34] that the be the serpent was the most
[50:36] subtle beast of the field. And and so we
[50:39] know and we're taught that that that
[50:40] that serpent was actually an upright
[50:43] creature. It was a beast. And and as
[50:45] that as he would begin to talk to Eve,
[50:48] he would come and he would he would
[50:50] begin to speak and and and and he and he
[50:53] would come and in such a way that that
[50:54] that he would he would take the word and
[50:57] he would actually quote the word back to
[50:59] Eve and and he would quote almost all of
[51:02] the word. Now, there's where your
[51:04] troubles at is where it's almost all of
[51:07] the word. But he would come and he would
[51:09] quote almost all the word, but he would
[51:11] change just one little part of it. And
[51:14] we know that the Bible says that in the
[51:16] last days it'd be so close that it would
[51:18] deceive the very elect. But I'm so
[51:20] thankful that he said, "If it were
[51:22] possible," aren't you grateful for that
[51:24] tonight that you that you have an
[51:27] assurance or you have a a a a an
[51:30] assurance. Amen. That you're able to
[51:32] stand in this hour and and you're able
[51:34] to discern between right and wrong.
[51:37] You're able to discern between truth and
[51:39] false. Amen. And but many times the
[51:41] devil, he doesn't come in, amen, and and
[51:45] preach to you or or teach to you, Amen,
[51:48] a blatant false doctrine. He doesn't
[51:50] come in that way. Many times he he
[51:52] doesn't come in through the front door
[51:54] and and and ring the doorbell and say,
[51:56] "Well, I'm I'm here and this is what I'm
[51:58] doing." No, that's not the way he comes
[52:00] in. But he'll he'll slip in little by
[52:03] little and before you know it, you've
[52:06] ran down a path. Amen. And and and
[52:08] you've lost your way. How did that
[52:10] happen? Well, it was a little here and a
[52:13] little there. Now, I don't believe that
[52:16] we have that trouble here. That is not
[52:18] why I'm preaching this tonight. I
[52:20] believe that you're you've been blessed
[52:21] with a a good godly pastor and good
[52:24] godly ministry around you. Amen. To
[52:27] preach to you the whole council of God.
[52:29] And otherwise, you know, well, I don't
[52:32] believe that they would be here today
[52:33] because I believe you to be a Holy Ghost
[52:35] fil people. I believe that you would be
[52:37] able to identify that and you'd be able
[52:39] to say, "No, we're we're not going that
[52:41] route." Amen. So, we don't say those
[52:43] things because there's trouble here, but
[52:45] I believe that you've got a good godly
[52:47] ministry. How many's thankful for your
[52:49] pastor and the ministry here? Amen. At
[52:52] Word of Life. That's all right. You can
[52:53] give him a hand. It sure don't hurt you
[52:54] to do that. Amen.
[52:56] You're blessed to be able to have a
[52:58] ministry, amen, in this hour that'll
[53:00] declare to you the whole council of God
[53:04] unapologetically. Amen. I'm thankful for
[53:07] men like that. But as we get into this
[53:10] tonight, I'm going to try to be just as
[53:12] brief as I know how to be tonight. Amen.
[53:14] But uh but we but we uh we we see here
[53:18] that that as as as uh in this picture
[53:22] here that is being developed now, we see
[53:25] how that sin begin to enter into the
[53:27] into the realm and into the picture. And
[53:30] but you know, I like how he said that
[53:32] that God don't want you to to to eat of
[53:35] that tree because he he don't want you
[53:37] to he your eyes will be open that you're
[53:39] gods and you But what that you
[53:41] understand, brother, sister, they
[53:42] already were that. Amen. They were
[53:44] already in that place. Amen. That that
[53:47] as they as they would speak, it would
[53:49] happen. Adam could say, "Mountain, be
[53:51] moved." And it would be moved. And he
[53:52] would begin to name as he begin to speak
[53:55] the word, the the word would come to
[53:58] pass. Amen. So, he was already in that
[54:00] place. But what was it? Satan had taken
[54:03] him and he he had taken him from that
[54:05] place and he had entered in. Amen. And
[54:07] we know that how that that entered in
[54:09] was Eve stepped from out behind the
[54:12] word. Sister, it's so important that we
[54:15] don't step from outside of the word, but
[54:17] we stay right directly behind the word.
[54:20] Amen. We stay with what it what the word
[54:23] says and what the word declares. Amen.
[54:25] But if Eve would have done that, look,
[54:27] it wouldn't the human race wouldn't be
[54:29] where it's at today. But because Eve
[54:32] stepped from out behind the word. Amen.
[54:35] Now Eve was taken out of the sight of
[54:37] Adam. And Eve, we realize and we're
[54:39] taught that Eve was actually a byproduct
[54:42] of the man. She wasn't actually in the
[54:44] original creation. Amen. How many knows
[54:47] that? Amen. But she was taken out of the
[54:49] side of man as a helpmate for the man.
[54:52] And and so so Eve would be taken. Why
[54:54] did Satan come, Amen through that that
[54:57] that uh through that vessel of the of
[55:00] Eve? It was because, see, he couldn't
[55:02] come through Adam, but he had to come
[55:05] through that other rail. But as Eve
[55:07] fell, Amen. Adam because of his love for
[55:10] Eve, he would he would look at Eve and
[55:13] he would know exactly what she had done
[55:15] wrong, she would he would know that she
[55:18] had she had stepped from out behind the
[55:21] from behind the protection, amen, of the
[55:23] word. So, so Adam knowing that he would
[55:26] become so overcome with the love for Eve
[55:30] that now Adam would actually act almost
[55:33] like a savior to Eve because the penalty
[55:37] of death was sin. So, we know Adam knew
[55:40] whenever he would look at Eve, he knew
[55:42] that she was going to die whenever God
[55:45] got down there. And and so Adam knowing
[55:48] and overcome with the love that he had
[55:50] for his wife, he came and and she be to
[55:53] express to him what had happened. And
[55:55] and she also give unto him. And and him
[55:59] knowing all the time, there been he'd
[56:01] done that. And why did he do that? Amen.
[56:04] It was because, Amen, of the love that
[56:07] he had for that one that God had given.
[56:10] And he knew that the penalty, amen, it
[56:13] would be death. But he also knew that he
[56:17] was a son of God. He was a spoken word
[56:20] king seed of God. And he knew that if he
[56:24] amen would come and and he would he
[56:26] would he would take his wife's sin upon
[56:28] himself as it were, he knew that once
[56:32] that gene seed was placed there, that
[56:35] God couldn't kill her no more than God
[56:38] could kill Adam. So Adam stood in this
[56:40] t. Oh my, aren't you grateful for that
[56:43] tonight? Adam stood in hisstead for his
[56:46] wife. And what did he do? Brother Joel,
[56:48] he stood in the gap and he knew his
[56:50] wife. And now with God come down in the
[56:53] cool of the day. Amen. He begin to call
[56:56] him and he begin to say, "Adam, Adam,
[56:59] where art thou?" Now I want you to
[57:01] understand, brother, sister, God already
[57:03] knew. God already knew what was going to
[57:06] happen because God, inside of God, there
[57:10] was an attribute to be a savior. Inside
[57:13] of God, there was an attribute to be a
[57:15] healer. And inside of God, there was
[57:17] those attribute. So, in order for them
[57:20] attributes to come to full
[57:21] manifestation, something had to be lost
[57:24] to be saved. Something had to be sick to
[57:26] be healed. So, God already knew. But
[57:30] what was that actually doing? It was
[57:32] fulfilling the full purpose of Christ
[57:35] Jesus because he could never express
[57:38] himself the way that he desired to
[57:40] express himself without that happening.
[57:44] You'd say, "Brother Ben, now why
[57:45] wouldn't God stop that from happening?"
[57:47] He could have done that. No doubt. But
[57:50] because of those attributes that needed
[57:52] expressed, oh my, he allowed the devil
[57:54] to come in and to do that. So now Adam
[57:58] would to look and he would take and he
[58:00] would he we realize that it was twins.
[58:02] I'm just being vague tonight. Amen. But
[58:04] we realize that that was twins that
[58:06] would be implanted in that in that seed
[58:09] would be planted there in that in that
[58:11] womb. Amen. But what was it? See if the
[58:14] one seed was there only. Amen. She was
[58:17] subject to death. But whenever that
[58:20] other seed was planted there all of a
[58:22] sudden it shielded her.
[58:26] Hallelujah. All of a sudden, it stood.
[58:28] But how many's following me tonight? All
[58:30] of a sudden, now she was impregnated
[58:33] with a word.
[58:35] That's true.
[58:37] Amen. So now God Amen. He couldn't He
[58:41] couldn't kill Eve without killing a part
[58:43] of Adam.
[58:44] [Music]
[58:46] Is that right?
[58:48] Amen.
[58:50] Everybody with me?
[58:52] Amen.
[58:54] But right there, there was a need of a
[58:57] savior. But we realized that that even
[59:01] though sin had entered into the picture,
[59:04] it did not stop God from coming and
[59:06] calling.
[59:09] Even though sin had entered into the
[59:11] program in the Garden of Eden, it did
[59:14] not stop God from doing his part and
[59:17] calling.
[59:18] Let me tell you something, brother. I'm
[59:21] thankful that he's still calling today.
[59:23] I'm thankful that there's still a God
[59:26] that's pulling on the heart of men
[59:27] today. Even though there's sin in the
[59:30] world, even though there may be sin in
[59:32] your life sometime, but yet God still
[59:35] calling.
[59:37] Hallelujah. It never stopped him. Even
[59:40] though sin had entered into the into the
[59:42] picture. Amen. And Adam and Eve, you
[59:44] understand? They never realized that
[59:46] they were naked until sin had entered
[59:48] into the picture. Then all of a sudden
[59:50] their eyes weren't open and they
[59:52] realized that they had to they had to
[59:53] cover themselves. Why would they why
[59:55] would they have to do that? Because
[59:57] their eyes were open at what was
[59:59] standing before them.
[1:00:02] That's broad, but it's just you you're
[1:00:04] following me.
[1:00:07] Amen. So, so man has always been that
[1:00:10] way. This is just a little different
[1:00:11] tonight. You forgive me for that. I'm
[1:00:13] I'm a little more into that that other
[1:00:15] mode this this evening. But but uh but
[1:00:18] man, Amen. has always done that. Amen.
[1:00:22] They've always tried to they've always
[1:00:24] tried to cover themselves. Come on.
[1:00:28] Amen. They've always tried to to make a
[1:00:31] a a covering of their own. You
[1:00:33] understand? It's always a a a covering
[1:00:36] that they'll take and they'll try to
[1:00:38] join this church as a covering or that
[1:00:40] church as a covering. But what is
[1:00:42] religion? It's a covering. Is that
[1:00:44] right? Amen. But but you understand,
[1:00:47] Amen. They've always tried to do that.
[1:00:49] But you understand that as God would
[1:00:52] come, they would begin to cover
[1:00:54] themselves. But God knew what had
[1:00:56] happened. And here still came God.
[1:01:00] Here still came God. Even though sin had
[1:01:03] entered into the picture. And he said,
[1:01:06] "Adam, Adam, where are you, Lord? Adam,
[1:01:10] Adam, where art thou? Adam." and Adam
[1:01:13] and Eve back there, they weren't hiding
[1:01:14] from God. He knew where they were. And
[1:01:16] many times, you're thinking, "You're
[1:01:18] hiding from God. You might hide from
[1:01:20] your pastor. You might hide from the
[1:01:22] deacon, but you're never hiding from
[1:01:24] God. He knows exactly where you're at."
[1:01:27] And he's saying, "Adam, Adam, where art
[1:01:31] thou?"
[1:01:32] Oh my, I'm so grateful that it didn't
[1:01:35] stop God from coming and calling. Even
[1:01:38] though sin had entered the picture, God
[1:01:40] still was faithful and he called.
[1:01:44] Hallelujah. I'm thankful I had a need
[1:01:46] for a savior and a savior showed up. Oh
[1:01:49] my. I'm thankful that I had a need for a
[1:01:51] savior and a savior showed up. Amen. But
[1:01:55] but you understand you weren't never
[1:01:57] looking for God, brother, sister. But it
[1:01:59] was always God that would come. Look,
[1:02:02] I'm a looking for you. You say, "Oh, I
[1:02:04] was a looking for God." No, you never
[1:02:06] look for God because you were born in
[1:02:09] sin. You were shaped in iniquity. You
[1:02:12] came into this world speaking lie and
[1:02:14] your flesh was enmity with God. There
[1:02:18] was a war between you and God. But
[1:02:20] nonetheless, God come looking for you.
[1:02:23] And he said, "Adam, Adam, where art
[1:02:26] thou?" Oh, you never went looking for
[1:02:29] God. But God come looking for you. Why?
[1:02:32] Because because there was a there was a
[1:02:35] need for a savior. And if there's a need
[1:02:37] for a savior, then a savior is what
[1:02:40] you'll have.
[1:02:42] Hallelujah.
[1:02:44] Thank you, Lord. Oh my. Oh, I went
[1:02:48] looking for God. I I I'm the one that
[1:02:50] held on to God. No, you never held on to
[1:02:53] God. But God all the time, he was
[1:02:56] holding on to you, brother, sister. You
[1:02:59] might have children out in the world.
[1:03:00] You might have a a son out in drugs and
[1:03:03] alcohol and crowing with women, but let
[1:03:07] me tell you something. If you'll just
[1:03:09] place them before
[1:03:16] God, he might be out crowing. He might
[1:03:19] be out with with this one and that one
[1:03:21] and this one and that one over there and
[1:03:23] and and maybe shooting up with dope. But
[1:03:25] if you'll commit them to God,
[1:03:29] take them out of your hands and place
[1:03:32] them in the hands of God. I want to tell
[1:03:34] you, one day you've got a promise, mama.
[1:03:38] One day you got a promise, daddy, that
[1:03:41] one day they're going to hear, "Adam,
[1:03:43] Adam, where art thou?"
[1:03:48] Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] Hey, don't give up on your prodals.
[1:03:53] I believe that this church will fill up
[1:03:55] with prodals. Come on, somebody. Come
[1:03:57] on. Let's not give up on our prodals. I
[1:04:00] believe that you're going to start
[1:04:01] watching prodals walking through the
[1:04:03] back door. You're going to watch prodals
[1:04:05] that have been gone for 15, 20, 30
[1:04:08] years. And you're going to watch them
[1:04:10] weep their way back into the presence of
[1:04:13] almighty God. This isn't a time of
[1:04:16] subtraction. It's a m of multiplication.
[1:04:19] It is not a time that people are going
[1:04:21] to We're getting le weaker, but we're
[1:04:24] getting stronger and stronger.
[1:04:27] Yes, sir. Don't give up on your prodical
[1:04:29] mama. Don't give up on your on your
[1:04:31] husband or your wife. Come on, somebody.
[1:04:34] You place them before God and you leave
[1:04:36] them there.
[1:04:38] Come on,
[1:04:40] brother. Every time I I I take my hands
[1:04:42] off of them, looks like they get further
[1:04:44] away. That's all right. They're in God's
[1:04:47] hands, not yours.
[1:04:50] Hallelujah.
[1:04:53] The devil wants you to back up on your
[1:04:55] promise. There ain't no reason to back
[1:04:57] up on your promise. Amen. God promised
[1:05:00] it. You believe it and that settles it.
[1:05:06] Adam, Adam, where art thou?
[1:05:12] Hallelujah. I'm so grateful that because
[1:05:15] sin entered the picture, Amen. It didn't
[1:05:17] stop a savior from doing his part. Amen.
[1:05:21] There they were. There they were. They
[1:05:24] were in a broken condition and and and
[1:05:26] broken and and and and and they would
[1:05:29] stand there and but yet God would come
[1:05:32] down in the cool of the day like he
[1:05:34] always did because God keeps every
[1:05:37] appointment that he ever ever made. And
[1:05:39] he had made an appointment with him that
[1:05:41] day that he would be there on that day
[1:05:43] in the cool of the day. And it didn't
[1:05:46] matter what had gotten in between them
[1:05:47] and him. He was still there. Yes, sir.
[1:05:50] He was still there and he was still
[1:05:53] calling. Hallelujah.
[1:05:55] Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] Thank you, Jesus. The need for a savior.
[1:06:00] They didn't know what it was like until
[1:06:02] that moment to need a savior.
[1:06:05] That's right. They didn't know what it
[1:06:07] was like until that moment to need a
[1:06:09] savior. But now all of a sudden, they
[1:06:12] realize that their man-made religion
[1:06:14] wouldn't work. no more. All of a sudden,
[1:06:16] they realize that just me attending a
[1:06:19] message church, it wasn't good enough
[1:06:21] just to attend the message church no
[1:06:22] more. The me, you understand, many of us
[1:06:25] are in the message, but the message
[1:06:26] ain't in us.
[1:06:28] Come on, somebody. It wasn't good enough
[1:06:31] just because I was raised in this
[1:06:32] message. Now, it's got to be a personal
[1:06:35] experience.
[1:06:38] Hallelujah.
[1:06:40] We get them. We get them so far, but we
[1:06:43] failed to get them on to God. Come on,
[1:06:45] somebody touched on that just a little
[1:06:47] bit this morning. I'm not going to get
[1:06:49] bogged down in that again tonight, but
[1:06:51] we'll get them so far. Amen. But we but
[1:06:53] we refuse to to to take them on in too.
[1:07:00] Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] Amen. Adam, Adam, we're hearts out, sir.
[1:07:07] We and we would see Jesus. 196 late
[1:07:10] 1962, excuse
[1:07:11] me. Victoria, Brit, British Columbia. He
[1:07:15] says, "You don't seek God. God seeks
[1:07:16] you."
[1:07:18] You said, "I sought. I He said, you said
[1:07:21] you you said I sought and sought it."
[1:07:23] No. No. It was God seeking you. Just you
[1:07:27] wouldn't turn loose. That's all. Come
[1:07:30] on, somebody. Just you. There's a key
[1:07:32] there. Just you wouldn't turn loose,
[1:07:34] that's all. And I tell you what,
[1:07:36] sometimes that's the case. I wonder what
[1:07:38] our church services be like if if we
[1:07:41] would turn loose. Yes, sir.
[1:07:44] I wonder what our our homes would be
[1:07:46] like if we would let loose. I wonder
[1:07:49] what our pastor would preach like if we
[1:07:51] would let loose. I wonder what kind of
[1:07:53] kind of signs and wonders would be set
[1:07:56] seen in the church if we would let
[1:07:58] loose.
[1:08:00] But we're so the theological until we
[1:08:03] got everything figured out. Let me tell
[1:08:05] you something. You don't know nothing
[1:08:07] and I don't either. Yes, sir. Come on,
[1:08:11] somebody. We think we got it all figured
[1:08:13] out. God can do what God wants to do.
[1:08:16] This is his house anyhow. It ain't your
[1:08:18] house. It ain't my house. It ain't his
[1:08:20] house. It's God's house. I say, let him
[1:08:23] out of the corner and let him move up
[1:08:25] and down the corridors of every heart.
[1:08:27] Let him move on the hearts of men and
[1:08:30] young women and young boys and let them
[1:08:33] have an experience with a a lifechanging
[1:08:36] savior.
[1:08:39] Let's not have less of Jesus. Let's have
[1:08:41] more of Jesus. Let's have less of you
[1:08:43] and me.
[1:08:45] You want to have less of something? I
[1:08:47] say let it start with brother Ben Beard.
[1:08:49] Let there be less and less of Ben and
[1:08:52] more and more of him.
[1:08:55] Let it start right here. There's too
[1:08:57] much of being hanging on. But God, I
[1:09:00] surrender my will. I surrender my life.
[1:09:03] I surrender my family. I surrender my
[1:09:06] children unto you, Lord. God, I take my
[1:09:09] hands off of it.
[1:09:12] They need a savior. And I do, too. Thank
[1:09:14] you, Lord.
[1:09:17] Oh my. What would our What would our
[1:09:19] services be like, brother, sister, if we
[1:09:21] would just take our hands off and say,
[1:09:22] "God, oh God, you lead, you guide." What
[1:09:26] would our services be like if we came in
[1:09:28] 30 minutes early or 45 minutes early? Am
[1:09:31] I okay, brother Ben? Came in 30 minutes
[1:09:33] or 45 minutes early and we hit our
[1:09:35] knees. Come on, somebody. Instead of hit
[1:09:37] Facebook.
[1:09:40] Come on, somebody. Why are we standing
[1:09:42] underneath the awning scrolling Facebook
[1:09:44] when we ought to be down on our knees
[1:09:46] seeking for God saying, "God, move on my
[1:09:49] pastor to come right down. I got a need,
[1:09:52] Lord. Lord, would you come in my midst
[1:09:54] tonight?
[1:09:55] Lord, what would our services be like if
[1:09:58] we get if we approached every service as
[1:10:00] though it was our last?
[1:10:03] Oh, church, I don't know why I'm here
[1:10:04] tonight. Can I just preach tonight? I I
[1:10:06] I don't know. But but what what would
[1:10:08] our services be like if we'd approach
[1:10:10] every service like it was our last
[1:10:12] service, like our life depends on it?
[1:10:14] And it does.
[1:10:16] What would our worship be like if our
[1:10:18] life depended on it? And it does.
[1:10:22] You say, "I'm in a low valley." Worship
[1:10:24] your way out of it.
[1:10:26] Praise your way out of it. Where you at,
[1:10:28] Miriam? Grab your tambourine and start
[1:10:31] walking all over the devil's head.
[1:10:34] Hallelujah. Miriam, look back behind
[1:10:37] her. She saw that taskmaster that had
[1:10:39] once beat her. Come on. Maybe it beat
[1:10:42] her a few days before that and she
[1:10:44] watched him go under that under that sea
[1:10:47] of judgment. And let me tell you,
[1:10:48] brother Harvey, she was overcome with
[1:10:50] joy. She grabbed a hold of that
[1:10:52] tambourine and she start and she had
[1:10:55] herself a Holy Ghost fit.
[1:11:02] She had herself a Holy Ghost fit. She
[1:11:04] grabbed that tambourine and she took off
[1:11:06] dancing. Oh my god.
[1:11:12] She
[1:11:13] dancing. Don't she know that's out of
[1:11:15] order?
[1:11:20] Oh, bless God. Bless her heart. Brother
[1:11:22] Ben's going to have to have a talk with
[1:11:23] her.
[1:11:28] And if Brother Ben don't, I
[1:11:32] will. Maybe you ought to get in the
[1:11:34] aisle with her.
[1:11:37] Come on, somebody. Maybe you ought to
[1:11:39] get in the aisle with her. It might set
[1:11:41] you free. It might get that critical
[1:11:43] devil off of you.
[1:11:45] Yes, sir. Come on, somebody. Is that a
[1:11:47] little too straight? I'm sorry.
[1:11:51] It might get that I'm comfortable now.
[1:11:53] God help us all.
[1:11:58] Amen. Hey, maybe it maybe it do you good
[1:12:01] to get that critical devil off you.
[1:12:03] Brother was in that spot one time. Now
[1:12:05] I'm just off on inspiration. Brother was
[1:12:07] in that spot one time and he stood
[1:12:08] there. He was crossed his tees and he
[1:12:10] was dotting his eyes. But before you
[1:12:12] know it, he was sitting there and before
[1:12:14] you know it, the critical spirit got off
[1:12:15] of him and he got out in that aisle and
[1:12:18] he be to Oh, glory to God. He be to get
[1:12:21] in a different atmosphere. He begin to
[1:12:24] Everything else didn't matter. This
[1:12:26] didn't matter. That didn't matter. He
[1:12:28] got out there and before you know it, he
[1:12:30] was in the middle of that floor and he
[1:12:32] was cutting the rug.
[1:12:36] Come on, somebody.
[1:12:41] Praise God. Don't he know he's out of
[1:12:43] order?
[1:12:48] I can show you a quote where brother
[1:12:50] said, "I hope somebody gets out of order
[1:12:51] long enough to get saved."
[1:12:55] That's just what he said. I'm sorry. I
[1:12:56] don't I don't read them and weep.
[1:13:02] Come on.
[1:13:05] Amen. I'm sorry. I This I'm just being
[1:13:07] me. All right. I I don't know how to be
[1:13:09] anything else. You either you're either
[1:13:10] going to love me or hate me after this.
[1:13:12] But I find that's just generally the
[1:13:15] case. They either love me or they hate
[1:13:16] me.
[1:13:20] Adam, where art
[1:13:23] thou? Never stopped him from seeking.
[1:13:28] He said you don't seek God. He said you
[1:13:30] just He said just you wouldn't turn
[1:13:32] loose. That's all. See, God seeks man,
[1:13:35] not man seeking God. the very ma nature
[1:13:37] of man showed in the Garden of Eden when
[1:13:40] he sinned. Instead of coming out and
[1:13:41] confessing it, he ran.
[1:13:45] That's every one of our That's every one
[1:13:47] of our our our our thing to do. Instead
[1:13:49] of just confessing that thing and
[1:13:51] cutting the devil's head off
[1:13:52] immediately, we take off running for all
[1:13:54] we're worth. Come on, somebody. Y'all's
[1:13:57] the same as I am. That's all right. You
[1:13:59] take off running as hard as you can. And
[1:14:01] that's the devil chasing you with that.
[1:14:04] Amen. because he knows, brother Joe, if
[1:14:06] you'll just stop right there, identify
[1:14:08] that devil and dismiss him and move on
[1:14:11] that he's lost his hold on you.
[1:14:15] He's lost his hold on you. At that
[1:14:17] moment, you know you're wrong. You
[1:14:19] identify it. You confess it. And the
[1:14:22] devil's powerless before you. Thank you,
[1:14:25] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:14:28] Come on.
[1:14:33] He said they
[1:14:35] run. They run.
[1:14:38] It wasn't Adam running through the
[1:14:40] garden hauling God. God, where are you?
[1:14:44] No, that ain't what he does. When you
[1:14:46] find a man that he's so discouraged that
[1:14:48] he can't he has to look look down to
[1:14:50] look up. You ever been there? You've
[1:14:52] been so low you got to look down to look
[1:14:54] up. Come on, somebody. I've been there.
[1:14:58] Amen. But you watch that man and before
[1:15:00] you know it, he gets in that state and
[1:15:02] he It's not that he stays in the house
[1:15:04] of God, but he begins to run. He begins
[1:15:07] to run for all that he's worth. And
[1:15:09] before you know it, the pastor's out
[1:15:10] having to chase him down.
[1:15:14] And it ought to be the other way around.
[1:15:17] But you understand what it is. It's a
[1:15:19] devil running you ragged.
[1:15:22] Come on.
[1:15:25] Come on. It's a devil running you out on
[1:15:27] a rail. Hey brother, sister, I'm just
[1:15:29] showing you who you are tonight.
[1:15:32] Come on. If if if we would catch this
[1:15:34] one revelation tonight. Amen. There
[1:15:36] ain't no telling what happened in the
[1:15:38] service tonight. Come on, somebody.
[1:15:40] There ain't no telling what you could
[1:15:41] walk out of here free of tonight if
[1:15:43] you'll only believe. The pro the angel
[1:15:45] of the Lord came to the prophet and he
[1:15:47] said, "If you can get the people to
[1:15:48] believe." Yes, sir. Come on, somebody.
[1:15:51] We try to make it so complicated. He
[1:15:54] didn't say whenever I come back. He
[1:15:55] didn't say will you did you understand
[1:15:57] it? Will I find understanding? He said
[1:15:59] will I find faith?
[1:16:04] Come on now. I believe that we ought to
[1:16:06] be taught. We ought to be understanding.
[1:16:08] We ought to we ought to study to show
[1:16:10] ourselves approved. I don't believe in
[1:16:11] ignorance. Come on. I don't believe in
[1:16:14] those sayings. Oh my. We bury our head
[1:16:16] in the sand and we say, "Well, we ain't
[1:16:17] got to study. We ain't got to do that.
[1:16:19] We ain't got to have no revelation.
[1:16:20] That's a lie out of the pit hell."
[1:16:22] That's right. Come on, somebody. If you
[1:16:24] don't have no revelation, you got to you
[1:16:26] better seek God somewhere. You better
[1:16:28] get on your knees and say, "God, I need
[1:16:30] help." Come on. Come on, somebody.
[1:16:34] Hallelujah. Most of times we want the
[1:16:36] pastor to do our studying for us. Don't
[1:16:38] work that way.
[1:16:42] Come on. Though he studies, no doubt. I
[1:16:45] know he
[1:16:48] studies because you don't pastor a
[1:16:50] church without studying.
[1:16:53] He said it wasn't Adam running through
[1:16:55] the garden hollering, "God, God, where
[1:16:56] are you?" It was God's sake. Adam, Adam,
[1:17:00] where?
[1:17:06] But I want to I want you to notice
[1:17:07] something, church. Before sin ever
[1:17:10] entered into the picture, God had
[1:17:12] already made a way.
[1:17:14] Thank you, Lord.
[1:17:15] God had already made a way for him to
[1:17:17] for for the chasm to be bridged
[1:17:21] before. It was it was not out of the
[1:17:23] plan of God. It was not out of the You
[1:17:25] say, "Brother Ben, you don't know what's
[1:17:26] happened in my life." No, I don't know
[1:17:28] what's happened in your life. But I'll
[1:17:29] tell you this much. The Bible said that
[1:17:32] the footsteps of the righteous, they're
[1:17:34] ordered of God. It doesn't matter. He
[1:17:36] didn't say they were ordered sometimes
[1:17:38] of God. He said the footsteps of a
[1:17:40] righteous man. It is ordered of God. If
[1:17:43] you find yourself in a valley, it's
[1:17:45] because God's footstep, the the order of
[1:17:48] God, it led you, it leads right through
[1:17:51] that valley.
[1:17:53] The children of Israel when they came
[1:17:54] out of the out of the out of out of
[1:17:56] Egypt, brother, sister, they came to a
[1:17:58] Red Sea. And that Red Sea was before
[1:18:00] them, and the mountains was on the other
[1:18:02] either side of them, and Pharaoh's army
[1:18:04] was behind them. But let me tell you
[1:18:06] something, that Red Sea did not take God
[1:18:08] by surprise. But the footsteps of the
[1:18:10] children of Israel, it led right through
[1:18:13] that Red Sea. So that Red Sea wasn't a
[1:18:16] problem for God. He was just taking
[1:18:18] them. They were still in God's hand.
[1:18:20] They were still in the plan of God. And
[1:18:22] now God had to just produce a miracle
[1:18:25] before them and start moving the water.
[1:18:29] The Red Sea wasn't a challenge for the
[1:18:31] children of Israel. It was a chance for
[1:18:33] the glory of God. What did he tell
[1:18:35] Moses? He said, "Stand still."
[1:18:38] He said, "Stand still and watch the
[1:18:40] glory of God." Moses stood there and he
[1:18:43] told the children of Israel, he said,
[1:18:44] "Stand still
[1:18:48] and watch the glory of God." Thank you,
[1:18:51] Lord.
[1:18:55] Brother, sister, if you leave this this
[1:18:57] service these services today, and you're
[1:18:58] still down in the in the
[1:19:00] valley, it's because you chose to stay
[1:19:02] there.
[1:19:05] Come on. Come on. There's nothing but
[1:19:09] grace today. My job today, I I I didn't
[1:19:14] come here with any agenda. I came here
[1:19:15] to simply encourage you today and to
[1:19:18] tell you to keep going. Keep your head
[1:19:21] up and keep pressing this battle. Yes,
[1:19:24] it's getting harder and harder, but let
[1:19:25] me tell you, you're getting stronger and
[1:19:27] stronger. Yes, sir. Let me tell you, the
[1:19:28] father of God said that the lid had been
[1:19:30] pulled off of hail. But I want to tell
[1:19:32] you something. And he also said, "If the
[1:19:34] devil's doing one thing, God's doing
[1:19:35] another. If the devil's working on one
[1:19:37] end, God's working on the other." So if
[1:19:40] the lid's been pulled off of hell, that
[1:19:42] tells me also that the lid has been has
[1:19:44] been pulled off of heaven. And let me
[1:19:46] tell you, these signs shall follow them
[1:19:49] that believe.
[1:19:53] I'm not looking for less miracles.
[1:19:56] Come on, church. I said I'm gonna say it
[1:19:58] again and amen me real good right here.
[1:20:01] I said, "I'm not looking for less. I'm
[1:20:03] looking for more. I'm not looking for
[1:20:05] less revelation. I'm looking for more.
[1:20:08] I'm not looking to be less like God. I'm
[1:20:10] looking to become God."
[1:20:12] Woo. That was strong, wasn't it? But
[1:20:14] that's the way it is.
[1:20:17] All that God God was, he poured into
[1:20:19] Christ. All that Christ was now he
[1:20:21] poured into. That's right.
[1:20:26] Come on, somebody. So I ask you today,
[1:20:29] where is Christ this evening? He's
[1:20:32] sitting right here in a many membered
[1:20:33] bride body. When you speak, he speaks.
[1:20:36] He said, "You'll have thus sayith the
[1:20:37] Lord or keep still." He also said that
[1:20:40] the bride knew what he wanted done with
[1:20:42] this word.
[1:20:44] He didn't just give her the word. Amen.
[1:20:46] And say, "I hope you know what to do
[1:20:47] with that, honey." No, he gave it to her
[1:20:49] because he knew. He had confidence in
[1:20:52] her that she would know exactly how to
[1:20:54] place that word.
[1:20:56] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] My wife sitting right there, she has the
[1:21:02] ability and the authority to speak on my
[1:21:04] behalf. Why does she have that ability
[1:21:06] and the authority? Because I gave her my
[1:21:09] last name. When she signs her name on
[1:21:12] that checkbook, it's as good as my name
[1:21:14] on that checkbook. And when she speaks,
[1:21:16] it's as good as I'm speaking. And when
[1:21:19] you say, "House of hell, give way." It's
[1:21:22] the same as Christ standing there and
[1:21:24] saying, "Devil, back up and give way.
[1:21:27] Loose him and let him go."
[1:21:31] When you take the anointed word and you
[1:21:34] place the anointed word on the anointed
[1:21:36] lips of an anointed bride and you speak
[1:21:39] that word, every devil in hell has to
[1:21:43] bow
[1:21:45] at that
[1:21:47] word. Thank you.
[1:21:51] Come on. Huh?
[1:21:53] Christ in you. I know I'm jumping all
[1:21:56] over the place tonight, but I'm having a
[1:21:57] good time doing it. Come on. Christ in
[1:22:01] you, the hope of glory.
[1:22:06] Thank you, Lord. I'm about to take off
[1:22:08] around this building. Come on. Huh?
[1:22:14] That ought to excite you, church.
[1:22:19] Brother said, he said, "You live, God
[1:22:21] have mercy, you live millions of miles
[1:22:25] below,
[1:22:30] millions of miles below your God-given
[1:22:33] right or privilege."
[1:22:36] I don't like that. You know, if if if uh
[1:22:41] if Brother Joel, we all know Brother
[1:22:43] Joel's got all the money. That's right.
[1:22:46] Praise the
[1:22:48] Lord.
[1:22:49] Huh? Hot, dude. It's in your back
[1:22:56] pocket. Brother Joe looked at me and he
[1:22:58] said, "Brother
[1:23:00] Ben, I got $200 with your name written
[1:23:03] all over it. I'm going to say, "Thank
[1:23:05] you, Jesus."
[1:23:09] First, brother Joel, if you pulled that
[1:23:11] $200 out and you had $200
[1:23:15] bills, I guarantee don't try me. Yeah,
[1:23:24] do. But if Joel, Brother Joel, pulled
[1:23:26] out a $200 bills and he said, "Brother
[1:23:29] Ben, this is yours. All you got to do is
[1:23:31] come and take it."
[1:23:34] Come on, somebody. All you got to do is
[1:23:37] come and take it. Now, I might be in the
[1:23:38] back of the church.
[1:23:42] I might even be in the middle of the
[1:23:45] church. I might even be at the front of
[1:23:47] the church.
[1:23:51] You ain't never seen nothing like this,
[1:23:52] have you?
[1:23:55] Amen. But if he said, "Brother Ben, this
[1:23:58] $200 is yours. All you got to do is come
[1:24:01] and take it." Now, now do you think No.
[1:24:04] Now, do you think that I'm just going to
[1:24:05] sit here?
[1:24:08] Heavens, no.
[1:24:12] Ain't no way.
[1:24:15] Amen. But when I get there, I'm not just
[1:24:19] going to take a $100 bill and say,
[1:24:20] "Brother Joel, you keep that for a rainy
[1:24:22] day."
[1:24:24] Come on, somebody. But you understand
[1:24:25] your approach to God. Many times are
[1:24:27] just that way. God says you can have
[1:24:29] your deliverance and you sit there and
[1:24:31] don't take it.
[1:24:32] God says you can have your children and
[1:24:34] you sit there and you don't claim them.
[1:24:36] Come on, somebody. Don't get heavy on me
[1:24:38] now. We're going to preach for just a
[1:24:40] minute. Amen. But it's yours. But you
[1:24:43] got to do something to go get it. Come
[1:24:45] on, somebody. I tell you right now, mama
[1:24:48] and daddy, if you got something, if you
[1:24:50] got your baby out there, you go get
[1:24:52] them. How do I do that, brother? You lay
[1:24:55] them at the feet of Jesus and you say,
[1:24:56] "God, they're in your hands now.
[1:25:00] Come on. Amen. But I'm not going to go
[1:25:02] down there and I'm I'm just going to
[1:25:04] Well, I thank you, brother Joel, for
[1:25:05] your consideration, but I don't need the
[1:25:07] 200. And I'm going to take it whether I
[1:25:08] need it or not.
[1:25:13] Come on, somebody. Because I don't want
[1:25:14] him. I don't want the bins getting
[1:25:17] confused. Amen. The other Ben might
[1:25:19] think it's for him.
[1:25:23] It's all right to laugh. I believe in I
[1:25:24] believe the Lord has a sense of humor.
[1:25:27] Amen. But we approach God. Amen. That
[1:25:31] way many times and and you realize
[1:25:34] sometimes you might be one Thank you
[1:25:35] Jesus away from your deliverance.
[1:25:40] You might be one thing one hallelujah
[1:25:42] away from your deliverance. What if non
[1:25:44] had went down there and he only did five
[1:25:46] times. Come on. Come on somebody. That
[1:25:49] wasn't what the word said. He said you
[1:25:52] go down there and you did seven times.
[1:25:54] Come on church. But he went down there
[1:25:56] and he come down the first time and he
[1:25:58] come up. He still looked the same. But
[1:26:01] yet the word had proclaimed a promise
[1:26:03] over him. Yeah. Yes, sir.
[1:26:05] Non went down the second time. He looked
[1:26:07] come back up. He looked the same. Three,
[1:26:10] four, five, six, seven. And on that
[1:26:13] sixth time, he looked and he said, "I'm
[1:26:15] still the same. There ain't no hope."
[1:26:17] That ain't what the word said.
[1:26:20] Come on, somebody. It said seven times
[1:26:22] he come down that seventh time. It
[1:26:24] wasn't good enough to go down six and a
[1:26:26] half times.
[1:26:29] I went down. I I got almost all the
[1:26:32] word, brother. I believe everything
[1:26:33] except
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:38] Come on, somebody.
[1:26:43] You don't get to, right?
[1:26:47] That okay.
[1:26:49] Amen.
[1:26:51] non went down seven
[1:26:55] and he come up and then the Lord
[1:26:56] fulfilled the word. Come on. Come on.
[1:27:00] It's just like when brother Brandon
[1:27:01] would have a vision, he would stand
[1:27:02] there and and if and and and when God
[1:27:04] would show him something, if one thing
[1:27:05] was out of order,
[1:27:07] if one thing if that sweater wasn't
[1:27:09] moved over here to this chair, Amen. the
[1:27:12] fulfillment of the vision wasn't yet. He
[1:27:15] could have acted. He could have he could
[1:27:16] have spoke the word but the chair
[1:27:17] sweater was supposed to be here and it
[1:27:19] was over there but it would have never
[1:27:20] come to pass. Why? Because it wasn't
[1:27:22] exactly the way the angel had showed
[1:27:23] him. Come on somebody. And that's why
[1:27:26] the word it must be fulfilled to the
[1:27:28] letter. It must be fulfilled every dot
[1:27:30] and every tit line upon line precept
[1:27:32] upon precept. Here a little and there a
[1:27:34] little
[1:27:36] keep our personal interpretations out of
[1:27:38] it. Is that okay? Good.
[1:27:45] Excuse me.
[1:27:48] He said, he said, he said it was God
[1:27:51] saying, "Adam, Adam, where art thou?"
[1:27:53] Same thing today. It is God seeking man.
[1:27:56] No, not man see no man can come to me
[1:27:59] except my father draws him first. But
[1:28:01] Adam, he realized in that moment that he
[1:28:04] was in need of a savior. Come on,
[1:28:07] somebody. At that moment, Amen. They was
[1:28:09] in that sin had entered into the word
[1:28:11] into the into the picture and the
[1:28:13] penalty was death. And Adam knew that if
[1:28:17] if God found Eve with child of a of an
[1:28:20] uncertain seed, Amen. that she would
[1:28:22] surely die because that penalty was
[1:28:25] death. But when God when Adam stood in
[1:28:27] thestead of Eve, hallelujah.
[1:28:32] When Adam stood in thestead, he what was
[1:28:35] it? He said, "I'll stand and I'll fall
[1:28:37] with her. I'll take the sin upon
[1:28:40] myself. And there he was. He took a
[1:28:43] fall, amen, upon himself. And we
[1:28:46] realized that God come down. And you can
[1:28:48] hear it now. The the the and God would
[1:28:50] take the the the the the fig leaves off
[1:28:53] of them and he would place skins of of
[1:28:55] lambs over them, bloody and and and they
[1:28:58] would be covered in that blood. And as
[1:29:00] they would be walking out of that
[1:29:01] garden, prophet of God would say, "I
[1:29:03] hear it just now, something slapping
[1:29:06] against her leg." He said, "Oh, I see it
[1:29:09] now. What is it?" He said, "It's that
[1:29:12] blood. It's running down their leg and
[1:29:14] it's that lamb covering them." What was
[1:29:17] it? It was the blood. It was a
[1:29:19] substitute. It was God taking a because
[1:29:22] there had to be blood for sin. So God
[1:29:24] said, "I'll accept the substitute until
[1:29:27] there's a perfect lamb that would come
[1:29:28] into this world." And let me tell you,
[1:29:30] in the Old Testament, whenever they
[1:29:32] would they would sin, men would go and
[1:29:34] they would do their confession and they
[1:29:36] would do all of the all their penences
[1:29:38] and whatever they do and they and they
[1:29:40] would do their sacrifices. There it is.
[1:29:42] That's the word. They would do their
[1:29:43] sacrifices and they would take that
[1:29:45] little lamb and they would take a rock
[1:29:47] or a knife or whatever and they would
[1:29:49] begin to jab at that lamb's throat and
[1:29:51] that blood would begin to squirt all
[1:29:53] over them and it was covering them all
[1:29:55] up. And what was it? Why? Because there
[1:29:58] had to be something die because sin had
[1:30:00] entered the picture and God would look
[1:30:03] at that and that would be a substitute
[1:30:05] for for what was to come one day when a
[1:30:08] perfect lamb would stand there. But they
[1:30:11] would stand there and that blood would
[1:30:12] get all over them and it would only
[1:30:14] cover sin. It would cover that sin and
[1:30:17] they would stand there. They would make
[1:30:18] that sacrifice and that the blood of
[1:30:21] that lamb would stand between them and a
[1:30:23] holy God. Amen. But that was only a type
[1:30:26] and a shadow of what was to come. And
[1:30:28] let me tell you, I hear another sound
[1:30:31] one day up called Gothther's Hill. I see
[1:30:33] a man. I hear an angry mob around him.
[1:30:37] And there was screaming, "Crucify,
[1:30:38] crucify, crucify." And let me tell you,
[1:30:41] I begin to see Brother Joel. I see in my
[1:30:44] in my mind's eye right now. I see a man
[1:30:47] standing there. He had been broken. He
[1:30:50] had been beaten for your a chastisement
[1:30:52] of your peace. It was upon him that
[1:30:55] moment. And let me tell you, he was a
[1:30:57] broken body. And
[1:30:59] he's not a broken body. But you
[1:31:02] understand, he was he was beaten to
[1:31:03] where he was unrecognizable.
[1:31:07] He was he was
[1:31:09] broken. And I can hear now. I'm just I'm
[1:31:12] just skipping right on because that
[1:31:13] clock right back there's not being very
[1:31:15] friendly to me. Amen. But we we
[1:31:17] understand that that that that as as
[1:31:19] they would leave that garden, brother
[1:31:20] say, I hear the the sound of that lamb
[1:31:23] skin smacking against Adam and Eve's
[1:31:25] leg. And now fast forward down the down
[1:31:28] through time and I hear an angry mob
[1:31:31] screaming out and there was a man
[1:31:33] standing there. It was the perfect
[1:31:35] spotless blood lamb of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:38] Why? Because there was a need for a
[1:31:40] savior in Word of Life Tabernacle in
[1:31:43] 2025. Amen. In June, on June the 8th,
[1:31:46] there was going to be a people that
[1:31:47] would have a need of a savior. And it no
[1:31:50] longer would it cover sin, but it would
[1:31:52] divorce sin.
[1:31:56] So now, he doesn't look at you and I.
[1:31:58] Amen. Amen. As old you and I, as I
[1:32:00] touched on just briefly this morning, he
[1:32:02] don't look on you as you look on you.
[1:32:04] But he don't even see you, brother Joel.
[1:32:06] But he looks to the sacrifice. He looks
[1:32:09] to himself. Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] But I hear that slap, that garment
[1:32:15] slapping against him and the weight of
[1:32:18] that cross dragging behind him and you
[1:32:22] look back behind him and there was the
[1:32:24] the cobblestone streets as it were in
[1:32:26] that day and you would hear clunk clunk
[1:32:29] clunk clunk of that sound of the foot of
[1:32:31] that cross dragging through the streets
[1:32:33] of that of of the streets of the city
[1:32:36] walking up toward a hill called Calvary.
[1:32:39] But I want to tell you something. In the
[1:32:40] garden of Gethsemane, Christ Jesus had
[1:32:43] already died out to himself. In that
[1:32:45] garden, whenever he was laying there and
[1:32:47] he was praying and this and his sweat
[1:32:49] turned to blood, there he was laying his
[1:32:52] own will down. And he was saying, "God,
[1:32:54] if it be your will, let this cup pass
[1:32:56] from me." Amen. But then he come around
[1:32:59] and he said, "Even though, Lord, not my
[1:33:02] will, God, but thine be done, Lord."
[1:33:07] Oh, what love that must have been.
[1:33:15] And as he walked up that hill, they were
[1:33:17] screaming and they was crying, "Crucify
[1:33:20] him! Kill him!"
[1:33:24] And you'd look and the foot of that
[1:33:26] cross was dragging out the bloody
[1:33:28] footprints of our savior.
[1:33:32] Oh my, what a savior we have, church.
[1:33:37] Have we gotten so cold until the story
[1:33:39] of the cross? It doesn't move us
[1:33:41] anymore. Let me tell you something,
[1:33:43] church. You're never going to get beyond
[1:33:45] the story of the cross. If it weren't
[1:33:47] for a God,
[1:33:49] if it weren't for God hanging in between
[1:33:51] heaven and earth and preaching the gap
[1:33:53] from time to eternity, you and I would
[1:33:56] be condemned to a devil's hell. But God,
[1:33:59] one day, Sister Carla, he hung between
[1:34:01] heaven and earth, and he joined the two
[1:34:03] together. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[1:34:07] Jesus. Oh, what love that was.
[1:34:11] Oh
[1:34:13] my. I thank
[1:34:15] God for a savior.
[1:34:19] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:26] Amen.
[1:34:29] But because Adam had lost the title
[1:34:34] deed, Adam had lost that. He had
[1:34:37] forfeited his right.
[1:34:42] Adam had forfeited the right to the
[1:34:44] title deed. And now in the hand, it went
[1:34:47] now into the hands of the original
[1:34:49] owner. I know I'm bouncing between the
[1:34:50] beginning and the ending there, but just
[1:34:52] follow me just for a moment, church.
[1:34:55] Amen. But Adam had lost. He said it now.
[1:34:57] He said in the breach between seven
[1:34:59] church ages and seven seals. He said he
[1:35:01] said now Adam forfeited the title deed
[1:35:03] and it now is in the hands of the
[1:35:05] original owner mighty almighty God. The
[1:35:07] title deed to the earth and to eternal
[1:35:09] life. When Adam forfeited it then
[1:35:11] Satan's dirty hands could not take it.
[1:35:15] Hallelujah. Satan's dirty hands could
[1:35:18] not take that title deed.
[1:35:23] That'd make, as brother Daryl says, the
[1:35:25] pope shout.
[1:35:32] Maybe even our new one.
[1:35:35] Come on. It said Satan dirty hands could
[1:35:38] not take it. So, it went back to its
[1:35:40] original owner, God
[1:35:42] himself. We're going to find it in just
[1:35:44] a minute. There he sits on the throne
[1:35:47] with his h with it in his hand. The
[1:35:49] title deed. Oh, that makes me feel
[1:35:51] religious. Friends, for those of you
[1:35:53] that thinks the prophet didn't get a
[1:35:55] little excited every now and again, you
[1:35:56] ain't listen to very many tapes.
[1:35:59] Come on. Come on, somebody. Those of you
[1:36:00] that think that the the prophet was a
[1:36:02] monk, he weren't.
[1:36:04] Come on.
[1:36:06] Come on, somebody. He weren't.
[1:36:10] I just grew up in the hunts of Missouri.
[1:36:14] I was homeschooled, too, and I didn't do
[1:36:15] a very good job with that.
[1:36:19] English wasn't my strong strong point.
[1:36:22] He weren't.
[1:36:24] Come on, somebody.
[1:36:26] Amen. Oh my.
[1:36:29] You'd think the prophet of God would do
[1:36:30] that and maybe more.
[1:36:33] I bet it'd surprise you. Come on.
[1:36:38] Let me just back to this now.
[1:36:41] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:44] He
[1:36:45] said the title deed. Oh, that makes me
[1:36:48] feel religious, friends. The title deed
[1:36:50] to eternal life. The abstract title deed
[1:36:53] to eternal life. When Adam forfeited it
[1:36:55] for wisdom instead of faith, it went
[1:36:57] back to the hands of the owner. Almighty
[1:36:59] God, what a great thing.
[1:37:03] What's it doing? It's in the hands of
[1:37:05] God, waiting for redemption's claim.
[1:37:10] Waiting for redemption's claim. He said
[1:37:12] he made a way of redemption. He made a
[1:37:15] way back. said, "Someday the redeemer is
[1:37:18] take is going to take it back." He said,
[1:37:20] he said, "It's going to take it back."
[1:37:21] He said, "Where we're getting to?" He
[1:37:23] said, "You see where we're getting to
[1:37:24] now?" He said, "Well, watch this fella
[1:37:26] sitting up on the throne." All right.
[1:37:28] Why waiting for redemption's claims? He
[1:37:31] said, "What is this book of book of
[1:37:33] redemption, this title deed?" He said,
[1:37:35] "This abstract deed." He said, "You say
[1:37:37] abstract." What does abstract mean? It
[1:37:41] means it searched all the way back to
[1:37:43] the beginning. Come on.
[1:37:46] That abstract, it searched all the way
[1:37:48] back to the beginning. Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:54] He said, "It's like that little drop of
[1:37:56] ink."
[1:37:57] How many remembers that little drop of
[1:37:59] ink? Let me tell you something, brother,
[1:38:00] sister. Whenever you drop down, drop
[1:38:02] your life into your sins into the drop
[1:38:04] of into that into the blood of Jesus
[1:38:07] Christ. Amen. It's like that little drop
[1:38:09] of ink that drops down into that bleach,
[1:38:11] brother, sister. Whenever I drop that
[1:38:13] ink into that bleach, I want you to find
[1:38:14] that ink. Come on, somebody. No, you
[1:38:17] ain't going to find that ink. Why?
[1:38:19] Because it's no longer there. The bleach
[1:38:22] has overtaken that ink so much that the
[1:38:24] ink becomes the bleach.
[1:38:27] Hallelujah. Amen. You're not going to
[1:38:29] find it.
[1:38:33] Why? Because it went back all the way.
[1:38:36] Yes, sir. Come on, somebody.
[1:38:42] He said, "Let me
[1:38:45] just," He said, "It searches all the way
[1:38:47] back." He said, "That little drop of ink
[1:38:49] this morning." He said, "When it struck
[1:38:50] that bleach, it went all the way back."
[1:38:53] And when sin has here we are when sin
[1:38:55] has been confessed. Come on. See,
[1:38:59] there's where that where there's where
[1:39:00] our biggest trouble is. Right there is
[1:39:03] unconfessed sin. That's right.
[1:39:08] Come on. That gets a little heavy, don't
[1:39:10] it? A little touch and go.
[1:39:15] He said when that sin has been confessed
[1:39:18] and fallen into the blood of Jesus
[1:39:20] Christ, oh my, it gives an abstract
[1:39:23] right back to the creator again.
[1:39:27] Now see what is it? Now look, once
[1:39:30] something once that's been put under the
[1:39:31] blood and that that's been confessed and
[1:39:33] put under the blood, no longer does God
[1:39:35] see that. Come on. Now, you and I still
[1:39:38] see it and we still bear the scar of
[1:39:40] that thing. That's right.
[1:39:42] Come on, somebody. I still bear the
[1:39:44] scars of my past sins and so do you.
[1:39:47] Amen. But God, when he sees you and I,
[1:39:49] he sees the blood of the lamb. Why?
[1:39:52] Because you and I, let me tell you
[1:39:53] something, brother, sister. Amen. Just
[1:39:56] because you fall on your face sometime,
[1:39:58] that don't make you any less of a
[1:39:59] person. It just makes you a human being.
[1:40:01] Amen. But if you lay there and you stay
[1:40:03] on your face and you say that I'm going
[1:40:05] to lay right here, that's where the
[1:40:07] trouble's at. Don't lay right there and
[1:40:09] let the devil beat you to death with
[1:40:10] that. You say, "Devil, yeah, I failed.
[1:40:12] Yeah, you got on me that time, but
[1:40:14] devil, I confess it in the name of Jesus
[1:40:16] Christ. I say, God, forgive me." And I
[1:40:19] place it under the blood of Jesus. And
[1:40:21] now I'm walking on. No longer. Let me
[1:40:24] tell you something. The sins of my past
[1:40:26] do not define me. But it is the
[1:40:28] redeeming blood of Almighty God that
[1:40:31] whenever he went to Calvar's heel, he
[1:40:34] stood there and he cleansed me from all
[1:40:36] unrighteousness. Now he doesn't even
[1:40:38] look to me, but he looks to the He looks
[1:40:42] to himself.
[1:40:45] He doesn't see him or you. He sees the
[1:40:47] sacrifice. Thank you, Lord. So grateful
[1:40:51] for that. I'm going to keep driving that
[1:40:52] home just for a minute. Good. You spend
[1:40:55] too much time looking at yourself.
[1:40:59] Come on, somebody. I want you to
[1:41:02] understand something. As long as you're
[1:41:04] on this side of eternity, yes, there'll
[1:41:06] be mistakes.
[1:41:08] That's right. Even I I I make I make I
[1:41:12] make more than my share. Yeah. Come on,
[1:41:14] somebody. Anybody tells you they don't,
[1:41:16] they're lying to you. That's right. They
[1:41:18] already made a mistake cuz they got a
[1:41:20] lying devil on them. Come on.
[1:41:23] Hallelujah. There's one mistake. They're
[1:41:24] a liar.
[1:41:26] Come on. There ain't no halos in this
[1:41:28] room. That's right. We're all We were
[1:41:31] all born in sin, shaped iniquity, and
[1:41:33] came in the world speaking lies.
[1:41:37] Even me.
[1:41:40] Ain't that hard to believe?
[1:41:43] Well, thank you, brother Joel.
[1:41:48] Uh,
[1:41:50] let me find a spot here to bring her
[1:41:55] down. He said, "And when sin has been
[1:41:58] confessed and fallen in the blood of
[1:41:59] Jesus Christ, oh my, it gives you an
[1:42:01] abstract right back to the creator again
[1:42:03] and you become a son of God." An
[1:42:06] abstract title deed is held in the hand
[1:42:10] of the almighty God.
[1:42:13] Oh my. He
[1:42:14] says it's
[1:42:16] redemption means all legal possession to
[1:42:20] all that was lost by Adam and Eve.
[1:42:25] All that was lost by Adam and Eve. He
[1:42:28] said it means all legal possession by
[1:42:30] all that was lost by Adam and Eve. Oh
[1:42:32] my, what that ought to do to a born
[1:42:35] again Christian. He said it's legal
[1:42:38] possession to the abstract title deed of
[1:42:40] eternal life. It means that you possess
[1:42:43] everything that Adam and Eve lost.
[1:42:47] He didn't say you will possess
[1:42:48] everything that Adam and Eve lost. He
[1:42:50] said it means that you possess
[1:42:54] present tense. Thank you, Lord. All that
[1:42:57] Adam and Eve lost. Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:02] He said the possession of that deed.
[1:43:06] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:08] Adam could not meet the requirements of
[1:43:10] redemption
[1:43:12] after he found he lost it. He had sinned
[1:43:15] and he had separated himself from God
[1:43:17] and was on this side of the chasm. So,
[1:43:20] he could not redeem it. That's right. He
[1:43:22] just couldn't do it. He needed
[1:43:25] redemption himself.
[1:43:27] So, he couldn't do it.
[1:43:31] Brother, sister, it took a kinsman to
[1:43:33] come. Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:36] It took a kinsman to come and he had to
[1:43:38] become one of us.
[1:43:40] But let me tell you, that one couldn't
[1:43:42] come the way that you and I came.
[1:43:45] Amen. That that first Adam, he came by
[1:43:48] the spoken word, but then sin entered
[1:43:49] the picture. There had to be one that
[1:43:51] would come by the spoken word. Amen.
[1:43:54] That that man and woman didn't know that
[1:43:56] that relationship they they would have.
[1:43:58] But he would come and he would create
[1:43:59] himself a a a sail in a in a Mary's
[1:44:03] womb.
[1:44:05] And he would come and he would be that
[1:44:06] perfect sacrifice standing there. He
[1:44:09] didn't come in sin.
[1:44:11] Come on, somebody. He was a He was a man
[1:44:14] that was acquainted with grief. He had
[1:44:15] heartache. He would He knew what it was
[1:44:17] like to have a headache and to sat with
[1:44:19] his hand over his over his head because
[1:44:21] he moaned in a headache. He was a man to
[1:44:24] know and what what it was like to be
[1:44:26] tested and tempted and tried. But he
[1:44:28] also when he overcame all of that, you
[1:44:31] also overcame with Christ
[1:44:34] Jesus. When the devil got him up there
[1:44:36] on that mountain that day and then he
[1:44:38] begin to tempt him and begin to try him.
[1:44:40] He said, "It is written." He always took
[1:44:42] him back to the word. What was he doing?
[1:44:44] He was showing you and I He could have
[1:44:46] used his his a miracle. He could have
[1:44:48] used Amen. and and and made that devil
[1:44:51] do whatever he wanted to do. But he
[1:44:52] didn't do that, brother, sister. He
[1:44:54] said, "It is written. It is written."
[1:44:56] And what was he doing? He was defeating
[1:44:58] the devil by the word. And you and I
[1:45:01] today, we've been called, amen, to
[1:45:03] defeat the devil the same way that
[1:45:05] Christ defeated him on that mountain
[1:45:07] that day. He said, "It is written." It
[1:45:10] is written.
[1:45:12] Hallelujah.
[1:45:16] But whenever Christ
[1:45:19] overcame, you overcame with Christ.
[1:45:24] Whenever Christ
[1:45:25] died, you died and you was buried with
[1:45:28] him and you rose with him. That's right.
[1:45:31] I told the church here while back, I
[1:45:32] said, "I've already been to hell.
[1:45:35] But when I went to hell, I went to take
[1:45:37] the keys of death, hell, and the grave."
[1:45:40] Come on, somebody. They Oh my. You
[1:45:42] should have felt them clam up on
[1:45:45] me, preaching along, just preaching
[1:45:47] hard, and all a sudden you make the
[1:45:48] statement, "I've already been to hell.
[1:45:54] But let me tell you something. I was
[1:45:56] with him.
[1:45:58] Amen. Amen. I When George Washington
[1:46:01] crossed the Delaware, I was there. Come
[1:46:04] on, somebody. When Christ put his foot
[1:46:06] on the boat of that boat and he said,
[1:46:08] "Peace be still." I was there. When
[1:46:10] Christ went down there and he took the
[1:46:12] keys of death, hell, and the grave, and
[1:46:14] he smacked Satan, that was me.
[1:46:18] Hallelujah. That was you. You was there.
[1:46:22] And when Christ rose on that third day,
[1:46:24] you were there.
[1:46:28] When redemption story was settled, you
[1:46:31] were there.
[1:46:34] The need. Now, don't let that trip you
[1:46:37] up.
[1:46:44] You were
[1:46:45] there. How many believes that tonight?
[1:46:50] Huh? What are you worried about?
[1:46:55] Amen. The need for a savior. Stand
[1:47:00] tonight.
[1:47:03] Amen. Don't you love him? What a
[1:47:06] privilege it's been here to be here with
[1:47:08] you this weekend and to share the the
[1:47:11] wonderful news of of Christ, our savior,
[1:47:14] with you. It's not our desire to do
[1:47:16] anything except exalt him and raise him
[1:47:18] high and my high and ra to raise him
[1:47:20] high among the people. He said if I'll
[1:47:23] be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me.
[1:47:26] Aren't you grateful for that this
[1:47:27] morning, this evening? Amen. Let's bow
[1:47:30] our heads
[1:47:31] tonight. Dear heavenly
[1:47:34] father, how we thank you Lord for your
[1:47:37] word
[1:47:37] tonight. I thank you Lord for these
[1:47:40] people dear God.
[1:47:42] Lord, the attentive spirit tonight,
[1:47:44] Lord, to your
[1:47:45] word. God, I know, Father, that it was
[1:47:48] simple, dear God, but Lord, I just
[1:47:51] happen to believe in simplicity,
[1:47:53] Lord. Prophet God would say it's God
[1:47:56] hiding himself in
[1:47:57] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:48:00] same. So, Lord, I thank you for that
[1:48:03] tonight. I thank you for for the for the
[1:48:06] for redempt for the for the redemptive
[1:48:09] work of Calvary.
[1:48:10] Lord, I thank you, Lord, for that. For
[1:48:14] truly, Lord, when I had had a need of a
[1:48:16] savior, there was one,
[1:48:19] Father, that stepped
[1:48:22] out and said, "I'll take his place."
[1:48:26] So Lord, I ask tonight, Father, that if
[1:48:28] there'd be one,
[1:48:29] Father, that would have a need
[1:48:33] tonight. May they not leave this place,
[1:48:38] Father, without placing it, Father, at
[1:48:42] your
[1:48:43] feet. We love you, Lord. We commit this
[1:48:47] church, Father. We commit these people,
[1:48:49] this pastor, Lord, into thy hands, Lord.
[1:48:52] Prosper them, Lord, in all that they do.
[1:48:54] Prosper him Lord in the re revelation of
[1:48:56] your
[1:48:56] [Music]
[1:48:58] word. Prosper them Lord physically Lord
[1:49:01] financially Lord spiritually all those
[1:49:03] things
[1:49:04] Lord bless them
[1:49:07] Lord we love
[1:49:09] you in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:49:17] When
[1:49:18] he was on the
[1:49:24] cross, I was
[1:49:28] on his
[1:49:31] mind.
[1:49:33] Oh, he
[1:49:36] knew
[1:49:40] me yet he
[1:49:43] loved me.
[1:49:48] It was he whose
[1:49:52] glory
[1:49:54] makes all the heaven
[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:00] shine. Oh, I was so
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:08] unworthy of such mercy.
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:16] But when he was on the
[1:50:23] cross, oh, I was all Oh, can you sing it
[1:50:29] one more time with all your hearts now?
[1:50:32] Oh,
[1:50:34] for he
[1:50:36] knew me.
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:39] Oh yet he
[1:50:43] loved
[1:50:46] me. It was he who
[1:50:51] glory
[1:50:53] makes all the heaven
[1:50:59] shine. Well I was so unworthy.
[1:51:04] [Music]
[1:51:07] Oh, of such
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:14] mercy. For when he was on the
[1:51:22] cross, oh,
[1:51:24] I was
[1:51:26] on his
[1:51:30] mind. Oh,
[1:51:33] amazing grace.
[1:51:36] [Music]
[1:51:39] shall
[1:51:40] be my
[1:51:43] song of
[1:51:46] praise. For it was
[1:51:52] grace that
[1:51:54] walked by liberty.
[1:52:01] Oh, I
[1:52:03] do not
[1:52:07] know just why he
[1:52:10] came to love me so. But aren't you glad
[1:52:15] he did? Oh, he looked
[1:52:21] beyond all all my faults and he
[1:52:25] saw my needs.
[1:52:28] with all your hearts. Now let it ring
[1:52:30] out to him. I shall
[1:52:37] forever lift mine eyes to Calary.
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:46] to you. That old
[1:52:51] cross where
[1:52:53] Jesus died for
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] me. Oh, how
[1:53:05] far the grace that caught my falling
[1:53:12] soul.
[1:53:15] He looked
[1:53:19] beyond all my faults and he
[1:53:24] saw. Let's sing that second verse now.
[1:53:26] Can we worship him for a
[1:53:29] moment? It
[1:53:31] was God's
[1:53:35] grace that brought me
[1:53:39] out of darkness.
[1:53:45] it to the
[1:53:49] light where
[1:53:52] I can
[1:53:54] clearly see.
[1:53:57] [Music]
[1:53:59] Will I shout it
[1:54:04] from the
[1:54:07] mountains and the
[1:54:13] valleyies that he looked? Oh, that ought
[1:54:17] to make somebody in here happy tonight.
[1:54:19] Aren't you glad he did it for
[1:54:21] you? Oh, yes. He saw your need. Oh, with
[1:54:25] all your hearts. Now, let me hear you
[1:54:26] singing. Oh, I
[1:54:30] shall
[1:54:34] forever lift mine eyes to Calary.
[1:54:42] [Music]
[1:54:43] to you. That old
[1:54:48] cross where
[1:54:50] Jesus died for me had he died for you.
[1:54:58] How
[1:55:02] far the grace that caught my
[1:55:08] falling
[1:55:11] soul. He looked
[1:55:16] beyond all my
[1:55:19] faults and he
[1:55:21] saw my
[1:55:26] need and sometimes hallelujah.
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:34] Oh, sometimes praise the
[1:55:40] Lord and sometimes
[1:55:43] gently
[1:55:48] singing our hearts in
[1:55:51] one
[1:55:54] accord. Oh,
[1:55:57] sometimes. Hallelujah.
[1:56:03] Oh, sometimes praise the
[1:56:10] Lord. Sometimes
[1:56:13] gently
[1:56:17] sing our hearts in
[1:56:20] one. Let's play that for a second. And
[1:56:24] did you enjoy the word of the Lord
[1:56:25] tonight? Give the Lord a big hand clap
[1:56:27] of praise if you
[1:56:30] would. And I I forgot this morning to
[1:56:33] read a card that brother Danny had gi to
[1:56:35] the church and I want to apologize for
[1:56:36] brother Danny for for that. I'll hang it
[1:56:38] on the bulletin as well, but it's from
[1:56:40] the the Brewer and the Ward family. The

[1:56:53] remember them in prayer. Amen. We sure
[1:56:55] love them and and uh just keep them in
[1:56:58] prayer through this time of grieving.
[1:57:00] Amen. Aren't you glad for what the Lord
[1:57:01] has done for us today? Amen. I believe
[1:57:03] we ought to just go out of this place
[1:57:05] with our spirits lifted and encouraged.
[1:57:07] Amen. To keep pressing the battle. Can
[1:57:08] we do that? Amen. I'm on the battlefield

[1:57:12] G. Well, I'm on the battlefield for my
[1:57:16] Lord. For my Lord. Oh, I'm on the
[1:57:21] battlefield. Oh, yes I am. Well, I
[1:57:24] promised him that I would serve him till
[1:57:28] I die. And I'm on the battlefield for my
[1:57:32] Lord. Sing it again now. Oh yes, I'm on
[1:57:36] the battlefield for my Lord. For my
[1:57:39] Lord. Oh, I'm on the battlefield for my
[1:57:44] Lord. Well, I
[1:57:47] promised.
[1:57:50] Oh, I'm on the
[1:57:53] battlefield. Sing it one more time.
[1:57:56] Well, I'm on the battlefield for my
[1:57:59] Lord. For my Lord. Yes, I'm on the
[1:58:03] battlefield for my
[1:58:05] Lord. Well, I promised him that I would
[1:58:10] serve him. Oh yes, I'm on the
[1:58:14] battlefield. Amen. You're free to go.
[1:58:16] God bless you. Ain't God
[1:58:18] good to give us so many blessings
[1:58:22] undeserving?
[1:58:24] That's what we
[1:58:26] are. We ought to thank him. Oh, love and
[1:58:31] praise him a little more today and a
[1:58:35] whole lot more tomorrow.
[1:58:38] Well, ain't
[1:58:39] God to give us so many blessings
[1:58:43] undeserved.
