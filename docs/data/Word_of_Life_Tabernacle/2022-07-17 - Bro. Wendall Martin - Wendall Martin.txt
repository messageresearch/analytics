but i tell you what there's plenty of other things to do for the lord as well amen some people say well i'm a preacher i can't mow the lawn well shame on you you're a servant of the most high god amen amen how many servants do we have in the building here today hallelujah glory to god amen so let's look here in the book of uh genesis 18 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mammary and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door about himself to the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet rest yourselves under the tree and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant they said so do as thou has said and the lord and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready three quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the earth and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it to the young man and he haste to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat let's go to the lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your blessings thank you for the anointing of the holy spirit we thank you for a wonderful meeting this weekend and lord all of the rewards that this church will have from all of the people that were blessed and lord the eternal dividends lord i know there will on that day this this group and the individuals who have labored so hard i know lord that they will receive many rewards just from this weekend and i'm asking god that you would just lord come down real special here this morning and that you would anoint and lord as we wait upon you oh god bless our pastor and his family bless all of the the deacons and those that are laboring here with him lord i pray that you'll just make this church such a lighthouse continue to make them a lighthouse lord and we'll give you glory and honor in jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen god bless you you may be seated here this morning praise the lord amen i want to speak on a real simple subject and that's entertaining the angel of the lord and um amen entertain is to give attention to to give consideration to to entertain is to amen to receive somebody and to uh to to take care of them and to make sure that amen when you're entertaining company at your house you don't just greet them uh at the door and and and just make them stand the whole time you want to make them comfortable you want to you want to make them feel like they're welcome amen and so when you're entertaining the presence of the lord amen i want to tell you this is greater than just entertaining uh uh your your uncle or amen grandpa or grandma or mom and dad or your friends entertaining the presence of god is something that is that is the greatest thing that you could ever have to entertain the presence of the lord is the greatest is the greatest privilege that you could ever possess as as a human being and for sure as a christian can you say amen so what have we been doing this weekend we have been entertaining the presence of the lord hallelujah friends i think that god should feel comfortable in our homes god should feel comfortable in our churches god should feel comfortable on our jobs god should feel comfortable wherever we are we should entertain the presence of the lord now the scripture says as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man now there will be a revealing and there will be a receiving everyone say it with me there will be a revealing and a receiving amen now what good is it to have a revealing if there is no receiving what good is for the lord to come and there's no one there to welcome his presence brother random told us amen about the unwelcome christ amen coming to the the pharisees house he showed up like he said he would come but yet they did not entertain him amen he sat there unrecognized set there unloved sat there amen no one was entertaining him amen so saints of god i think in order for god to be welcome we must entertain him hallelujah well praise the lord amen when you're waking up in the morning time amen you the first thing that you should do is lord jesus i just want you to know that i love you amen before you leave the house you say lord i want you to go walk with me today hallelujah i want you to fellowship with me today i want you with me amen brother andrew was talking last night about the amen about the preacher standing up you know amen everyone that might be sitting there thinking what in the world are you doing hallelujah amen but you see a preacher knows that a preacher needs the presence of god there ain't nobody knows like a preacher knows amen uh to preach a sermon without the presence of the lord i mean somebody i heard somebody say you know amen i've been preaching for 50 years and i've only preached without the anointing once and i thought dear god that'd be something to have hallelujah amen ain't nobody knows how to preach what it's like to preach without god being there amen so what does a minister do he is pulling on the gift what is what is he trying to do he's wanting to get that preacher out of his aim in humanity and into the presence of god because if that preacher can ever get into the presence of god amen there's going to be virtue and healing and the supernatural and the presence of god with us oh come on now you don't want to hear me just saying you don't want to hear me just preach but you want the presence of god in our midst he may let this church be a church that god feels comfortable in where the anointing of god is right there in oh come on church but it don't just happen here in the church it'll happen right there in your home if you'll make him welcome praise the lord hallelujah but this day is a lot like the days of sodom it's a day of self abs absolute self gratification amen it's a it's a day where every man did that which was right in his own eyes he man until there was no boundaries to the sin they were discovering their sexuality and in different ways and amen they were known for their homosexuality the children were were no doubt told that they were born gender-neutral and as long as they wanted it they could have it amen it was there was no questioning of the belief system there was nothing there to a man to stand as a standard and lot senses had become so numbed until he become accustomed to the new norm amen lot become accustomed to the ways of sodom amen lot done this he meant he could rub shoulders with him and literally thank god surely he meant surely god looks upon their heart and surely god loves them amen people love god in their own way i mean they're going to their shrines and their churches are their synagogues amen they're they're going to their temples and offering their sacrifices amen are you hearing me the sodomites were worshippers too even they were worshipers amen now their worshipping wasn't as strict as as abraham they full-heartedly believed that amen that they would be accepted to amen oh yes amen there was a plenty of worship that was going on amen the scripture says amen but it was a different worship are you hearing me they did not see lot could not see abraham's way of seeing things lord could not see that sodom was fixing to burn lord could not see amen that the end was coming lot could not see the wrath of god was fixing to be poured out but it was faithful abraham who had been given a promise hallelujah amen he was all by himself amen out there in the heart desert hey man and there he is but he's waiting upon the promise of god he had been waiting for many years are you hearing me now amen but one morning amen as he was sitting out there thinking about the promise god came showing up i said god the one who gave the promise came to fulfill his word oh come on now amen oh maybe hallelujah as we as we heard last night amen brother ron had said you're going to be healed and the girl amen said it's been five years but i'm still believing for my promise how many in the building here today amen is still waiting upon your promise he says i'm gonna come i'm gonna take you home i'm gonna i'm gonna bring you to myself you're gonna forever be with me there's going to be a fulfillment of that promise his attitude was that of romans 1 21 because that when they knew god yeah they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain and their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they become fools you see the actions are direct results of the blindness of the age now i i want you to just hallelujah how many's with me here this morning you see sodom's actions are the results of their blindness their code in different hearts are the results of their blindness there's no amen there's no there's nothing within them to understand the promise or the revelation that uh that that the world is coming to an end can you say amen but there is a people who is possessing who is who has possessed a promise who is walking with god day by day hallelujah amen you might not be on the who's who you might not be a part of amen you know the big program of the community but god knows who you are oh praise the lord amen you look out there in the denominational world today just just pick any church you want to and you tell me amen where the power of god is you have you you tell me where the overcoming power is you tell me those that are that are living above sin amen where the word is becoming flesh amen can you say amen but you see isaac could only come by those amen incredible words of god abraham was living by the word of promise amen he was waiting upon the word of promise oh can you say amen amen there's nothing to change a lot there was nothing i said there was not somebody saying nothing there was nothing to change lot he meant he had no word he had no revelation he had no angel appearing he had nothing coming to him are you hearing me but there was a promise that abraham had and he was waiting upon god to fulfill his word oh hallelujah amen they might have their stage shows going amen they might have big youth groups even there might be a lot of things are going on but i want to say word of life has been given a promise all glory to god you might not be aiming much in the world's eyes but god gave you a promise and you should rejoice [Music] what can you say man you see what the world looks at what the world what the world sees is not what god sees amen abraham hallelujah he just looked like he got the bad end of the stick he meant lots down there with all the money lots down there amen the mayor there he is a judge amen there he is he's he's he's highly respected but abraham amen was all by himself in the desert but you know what god did not know the angel of the lord like abraham knew that angel now praise the lord amen now the revelation of the son of man is the only thing that is going to produce change the son of man and the revealing of his word is the only thing that's going to produce a body change now you hear me sons and daughters of abraham the words of the angel are the only things that's going to change you and your body now y'all hearing me hallelujah there's a reason why we entertain god there's a reason why when we come into the church even we we don't run all over the building and you kiss amen the reason why mama says when you come in and sit down amen just to come and sit down and be real quiet amen and there's a reason why the music is playing ahead of time amen and you're coming everyone's real quiet and there's no notes being passed amen we're being real reverend you there's a reason why we do that kids we do that because we want god to come down and visit with us hallelujah it's not just rules and regulations amen it's not pastor said you better where the deacons say i'm going to take you back to your mama no no no no it's we are learning we are we are entertaining the presence of god remember the branham said amen a child running in the building can cause the angel of the lord to leave that church for two weeks amen run him off amen but we don't want him running off oh come on now you girls want the presence of god in the church amen elders we want the presence of god in the church amen pastor we need the presence of god amen not when there's just a meeting amen thank god for meetings but i want the presence of god every service sunday morning sunday night wednesday night i need the presence of god i want him to feel welcome in this church yes sir you want him to feel welcome can you say mine yes sir you see the church world does not have even the clue brother branham said is because she was the shock and the plant has died but life is still in the sea now brother branham said now she is now a dry chuck he says churches of yesterday it's past the spirit of god passed through her is true and will not she will not be heir with a vindicated seed word she sure will not be she will not be in the rapture she'll be a church member may come up in the second resurrection and be just for what she's heard can you say man but you see she's not part of that elect but abraham's seed is not to be caught up in the lot generation we're not to be caught up in the laodicea culture the laodicea culture amen is heady high-minded amen lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god can you say man amen they are cold and formal amen they have a form of godliness but denying the power thereof they say i'm rich increase with goods and have need of nothing but christ is on the outside of that church well you might as well help me to preach amen but he didn't stop there he says but if there's anybody amen that can recognize my presence i will personally come to that man and i will identify myself my character my love my power my majesty i will come to that individual and show my power how many wants to entertain the presence of the lord oh it's not a bunch of music it's not a bunch of hype it's not a bunch no it's the presence of god in revealing himself to me [Music] what can you say man amen you say brother thank you lord how is it that they can cry tears how is it that people amen even in the message are satisfied listening to a sermon and yet their lives aren't changed how is it it's because somebody has got caught up in the culture of laodicea people's rights they're caught up in self-gratification oh come on now amen but what are we doing when we're saying amen what are we doing when we're raising our hands and saying yes what are we doing hey man when we're lifting our hands and singing songs we are leaving the culture behind and we are giving amen adoration and love unto the one who has called us and separated us to himself we've identified he has kept his word he promised he would come and he is here he promised there would be amen the revealing of the son of man we see him we feel him we know he's here and we choose to entertain yes him sir amen thank you you're coming with your sorry attitude come on oh come on friends and expect god to be blessed you come in with your sorry attitude you see now i'm just the evangelist today well i might be getting a little bit of metal in here but hallelujah he can correct that when i leave [Music] but you see huh oh now tc now now we all have wings when the when the evangelist shows up halos smile oh yes some of you has jumped up and shouted amen to the word of the lord this weekend the first time you've done it in 50 years well praise the lord and amen but you see andrew glover is not the angel of the lord josh martin is not the angel of the lord amen ben prince not the angel of the lord joel pruitt is not the angel of the lord wendell martin for sure ain't the angel of the lord but you know what it has been promised that god would raise men up amen to lead us into the rapture that would keep us in that message come on church amen then what we should do no matter the vehicle no matter the body no matter the amen the message or whoever's preaching we need to recognize jesus christ in our midst because when he's in your midst he says amen i want you to be careful about entertaining even strangers because that could be an angel oh come on now amen looking at the things of god amen i know this is simple amen but sometimes we get caught up in that culture okay can you say amen amen we get caught up in their culture and we fail amen that we are to see that we are to be partakers amen after coming into his body a partaker of his divine nature christ's nature in you he says how can you cheat steal and lie and backslide and proselyte and everything else with the divine nature of christ in you it's impossible amen let that soak just a few minutes here if you be a partaker in christ then you become a new creature old things have passed away all things become new all of our warnings and our fussings and our stewings and our arguings and our tempers all these things pass away we're washed oh yeah there's a lot of strife going on out in the world but it's not going to happen in my home free come on there's a lot of darkness out in the world but it's not got to happen in my life there's a lot of unforgiveness out there in the world amen but by god's grace i'm going to keep the angel with you want to stay with god stay gentle come on god is gentle you want to stay with god stay humble god is humble what praise the lord you want to stay with god instead of telling the pastor amen that his sermons that he's priests is just you know dear lord can't you ever can't you step it up a notch i mean andrew glover don't have no problem preaching like that hallelujah what's your problem i know what the problem is you need to lose weight hallelujah and so then hey man they'll start picking on the preacher you need to lose some weight amen you're eating too much fried chicken hallelujah amen hallelujah and and then they'll come back and say you need to go tan you're not as dark as he is amen oh my but why don't you understand that god has god is here he's here somebody say he's here amen god is here all he's got to do is be recognized you're not fat hallelujah now man recognizing our thoughts are not to be amen caught up in the temporal vanities come on come on preach come on come on somebody say this is good pretty good well thank you you girls wearing the short skirts are caught up in layout to see a culture amen those tight blouses amen these days they've got the tights under the skirts hallelujah they've got all of these things these this is culture to try to pull you away pull you away from what god is doing i've not seen anybody with tight skirts so i'm not preaching to anybody i'm just it was on my notes hallelujah come on come on you guys always say just stick with your notes will you i did hallelujah amen can you say man amen because brother branham says you can have all knowledge yes sir you can pray for the sick yes amen come on now you can say oh god just revealed the word to me like this and that and the other i have all the knowledge and he says and you're still wrong why because the angel of the lord can only be contacted in that spirit realm you can learn your sermon you can learn your dress code you can learn even all of the message you can have on but if you ain't got it here you're not recognizing what god has done he's not come to give us another seminary learning of the book he's come in his power his anointing in his person to bring about the body change for you [Applause] can you see man abraham sarah let me remind you this morning oh yeah there's no blood and salt there's no blood in sodom there's no word lamb therefore there's no blood what can you say man there's nothing there but the scripture says but in the revealing of the sun when god takes on reveals himself in the form a man of dust when god comes down and takes on a body here on the earth it's going to be god revealing himself amen now i want you to stay with me for a little bit longer here this morning amen he's discerned the heart with decision through brother branham amen year after year night after night i'm in the anointing with accuracy what was god showing he was trying to tell you i am here amen when you seen all amen amen time after time name after name address after address and there was no mistake it was god's showing i am here amen when god sent that prophet seven times around the world and he was in all of the newspapers amen it was god saying abraham abraham i'm here to fulfill my promise i'm here i'm here i'm here [Applause] it was god wanting to elect the elect no i am here to fulfill thank you lord hallelujah thank you jesus can you say amen brother that was 60 years ago what bearing does that have on me today oh come on oh come on now he is imparting supernatural strength to his little lady only the son of man can do this oh yes now you see that prophet becomes the word to that group yeah am i going too slow this morning no come on that prophet becomes the word it's god's thoughts spoke through a prophet and then that little bride is carrying super natural seed [Music] [Applause] are y'all hearing me you see you see we want the supernatural rapture we want the supernatural bride we want these kinds of things but you see the only way the bride can be impregnated is by the word of god through a prophet and the prophet had to come and bring the seeds out of that bible amen god and shine the light and says this is for you but this is unlike any other kind amen of a seminary because you can learn it you can learn it that's right if you've got ears you can hear it if you've got eyes you can read it if you got a computer you can search it all right right but only the angel yes only only the angel has the ability to come and to say to sarah oh yeah according to the time of life you're going to produce oh come on lot didn't have that the angel didn't appear a lot sarah could not do it she was a message believer she could not do it until the angel comes and makes it well praise the lord someone tells me amen brother wendell why why is it that amen you you make it to church every service because i don't want to miss the angel of the lord why is it that you pray and you're living a dedicated life i don't want to miss the angel of the lord why is it that i'm keeping my heart pure and and undefiled is i do not want to miss oh church of god amen we miss him we miss it we miss him because we are part of a culture that we should not be off we miss him we allow our hearts to get all caught up and gossip hate amen filth of the world and then we want to come to church because we know how to say amen even we know how how to sing our song we know how to come in amen and do our duty amen but if your heart is not where it needs to be when the angel is near then it does you no good come on come on i want the angel i've been waiting on a promise too long i don't want to be out there messing with the world i don't i don't have time to be a part of the culture i don't have time amen to lose what god has given me in this hour i refuse to be a lot i refuse to be deaf and dumb to the presence of god when he comes amen well y'all were shouting a whole bunch last night hallelujah hallelujah what can you say man oh god you see lot can't change who he is neither can any of the sodomites change who they are oh can you say amen neither can you neither can i change myself in my own nature in my own efforts i can't do it you can't do it it requires the angel of the lord let's honor that angel when he is near thank you the sinner can't change his nature come on that's right right come on a sinner is no match for those homosexual devils and neither are you boys come on preach you boys are no match you say oh yeah i am not going to do this you play around with devils they'll take you further than you want to go you get out there in that culture what are you talking about culture this world that we're living in that is excusing anything and everything under the name of christianity and that same devil comes into our churches and our children set without the power of the holy ghost and a lot of times it's because the elders of the church has not taught them how to entertain the presence of god [Music] many times because the elders have not had an experience with god and themselves amen for the last five ten years but i want to tell you today the angel is here he can change that homosexual devil he can drive evil away he can make or believe her he can make you who you are come on church you don't have to beg you don't have to plead he showed up to abraham and abraham recognized who he was and entertained him almost no begging about it he's here he's here that angel of revelations 10 never left the earth he's here what are you doing with this christ i don't know y'all so i'm just preaching hallelujah hallelujah i'm glad i don't know you amen that way i can just continue to keep on preaching hallelujah oh can you say amen amen you want the power of god in the church get the angel of the lord you want the power you say well hey man i've been praying and praying and praying he's always following his word the word was with sarah and abraham that you were standing upon that promise they were believing the promise you want to attract the holy spirit then you get the word the spirit of god follows the word it don't follow drums it don't follow piano it don't follow music it don't follow deacons it don't follow preachers it follows the word if we can recognize his promise to this day thank you lord amen hallelujah now come on before the fire falls the promise is that i'm going to reveal i'm going to come to you and i'm going to come in the form of the son of man come on i'm going to come in the form of son of man now what is that it's going to be god with dust on his clothes it's going to be god amen we'll praise the lord it's going to be god in a prophet form are y'all with me here today hallelujah amen and now listen amen as long as amen now now i want you to understand because when the words come the words was in the angel let me just make it put a name to it melchizedek had the words and once the words were spoken amen to abraham and sarah then they become a part of that word are you hearing me amen it's whatever the josh was preaching yesterday it had to be the thoughts of god through the mouth of god into the womb of the virgin bride and then you become word made flesh praise the lord amen everyone knew that something was happening come on everyone knew because is this okay oh it's good because when sarah and abraham go down a mountain in the time of famine and goes down to grier there come on and hallelujah amen sir abraham looks at sarah and says hey hey now listen now since the angel has touched you you don't look like a grandma and uh you i'm a little bit worried because i'm telling you you beat anybody in that country and i and i feel honored i'm glad you're you're mine you're you're mine but i'm afraid the king wants you too and and and so i well praise the lord he was fearful of that and when the king comes back over and what does the king do the king says he's looking at him now he could have any of all those girls in the land and guess who he fell in love with grandma i i i i was looking for a grandma to pick one but i ain't gonna pick on no grandma's here tonight hallelujah or this morning amen so so you wanted what one he wanted wanted grandma now what the king had to witness the angel had the angel had been at their place the king had to witness oh come on lord had to witness everyone had to witness why because the word was no longer in the thoughts of god it was no longer in the brother branham said as long as the word was in the prophet he was a god to the people but once it left his mouth and entered into the womb of that heart then it was no longer in god it was no longer in the prophet now it's in the [Applause] believer i said praise the lord now you know why the scripture says there in revelations 10 and 8 go to the angel and take the book entertain the angel how are you going to entertain how are you going to take the book acknowledge he's near sit at his feet and ask for him take those words from your mouth and put it into my womb take those words from oh come on church amen when your pastor's up here preaching amen what is he doing he's taking the words the thoughts of god that was spoke through the prophet of god he's picking up those spirit-filled words he's placing them upon his lips brother branham says that is the same as deity speaking what is he doing he is standing up here in his in his human vessel declaring god's word and if you can recognize it and accept it as the angel of the lord then you shall be blessed [Applause] william branham become the vehicle of the son of man right oh yeah so it was a son of man revealing the son of man this weekend it's been a son of man revealing the son of man amen a son of a freak well i'll accept it with brother branham but i ain't going to accept it as from my pastor come on you're not going to accept us from the evangelist where you girls would say i'm not going to accept this from my mom and dad come on come on can you say man but you see the angel we can't excuse the angel oh yeah we can't i don't matter what i i i this really is not my message i'm fixing to get to my message here in a minute hallelujah recognizing the angel amen recognizing what god is doing recognizing come on now amen oh god it don't matter how it comes it don't matter if it comes to pastor it don't matter if it comes to the evangelist it don't matter whether it comes to the teacher it don't matter whether it comes to the amen the apostle or the prophet amen there's one thing about it i'm going to receive the words of god i'm going to recognize the present i'm going to entertain oh come on church i don't care if there's only 30 people on a wednesday night i'm going to lift up my hands tears are going to stream down my face i love this angel sir hallelujah can you see man now so now the angel of the lord the messenger of god was the word veil until he delivered it to the people is that right now hallelujah come on there the unveiling of god brother branham says now but this is spirit that comes upon the promised word for the age and brings forth and manifests not two tables of stones but the presence of the living god hallelujah this is the spirit upon the promised word not in two tables of stones not in a bible come on come on but it's the presence of the lord not a mythical thought somebody made up or some houdini a trick but the very promise of god revealed and made manifest right behind before us what sort of a veil will that be behind i i say today satan you're not going to minimize the veil in my eyes [Music] oh come on now amen you're not going to men i know i'm i'm i'm talking about the men of god here right now but i want to talk to you now you shouldn't minimize the veil don't minimize god beating her and don't you minimize god being in her and don't you minimize god being in her god is living in his people he's living in his word he's oh come on now amen mamas amen maybe maybe you feel like you ain't got nothing to give oh but you are the promised word for the day and god's spirit is upon you amen all you might feel amen you elders might feel like man i'm a husband i'm used up but no no no no you still house the temple of god you still have oh come on just entertain that presence amen don't let jealousy and hatred and don't last malice and then be among us don't let amen unforgiveness are y'all hearing me tonight amen but recognize god he is in the building his tabernacle his people glory brother branham says now in that day luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said when the son of man is being revealed not men the son of man not an organization the son of man the word living itself among the people the word itself made flesh in you you are a reflection of this hour the message glory reflection of it see you live again live the life that was in jesus christ you're in the presence of the son oh someone shout hallelujah what happens to it what happens to that church finally listen

each other ain't got no life in them they're the the culture the sun everything has dried them up that secret of life it has produced exactly what it was supposed to do and while that plant in itself

different walks but we all have the same promise some of us are old some of us are middle-aged some of us are kids but we carry the same promise we are the bride of the lord jesus christ i need you you need me god's still in a human veil just like he was with the prophet god's not changed god's still here god will always have a body brother branham said that same pillar of fire that was with him amen it split up and it went into the 100 he said the adopted sons will have the holy or that pillar of fire with them i say this is the message of adoption we have the holy spirit and it is that pillar of fire and he's got a body as i entertain my brother andrew hallelujah as i entertain him i'm entertaining the angel oh yeah if i'm critical of brother andrew and critical of the way that he needs a haircut i am missing the god if i'm critical of you i am not entertaining god come on church we need god he's in his body [Applause] all right hallelujah i'm preaching this morning amen oh can you say amen what's the scripture says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if one fall if they fall the one shall lift up his fellow woe to him that is alone when he followed yeah he has not another to help him can you say amen if two lie together they have heat but how can one be warm alone if one prevail against him two shall we stand him three cord and threefold cord is not quickly broken thank you lord you know why is it that we can't recognize god in our services sometimes oh my god why is it once again as our spirit man is clogged up yeah you know what makes the preacher so different when he's up here preaching is when that anointing hits him but a preacher has learned to yield himself to that presence when he comes he's learned how to yield himself come on and it's not just for the preacher it's for every one of us in this body all right come on yes sir amen do you feel his presence right now his presence is in the building what is it what is it it is here and me talking about it and me just bringing this message to you it is quickening on some i can see the presence of the lord on you very strongly yeah what is it it is someone that is reaching out you've got your tentacles out right now into the rim of the supernatural god [Music] the prophet would call it a built-in receiver he says there is a transmitter and there is a receiver amen i've got this this thing right here these ear monitors i don't know where who where where's the where is the transmitter there's the transmitter man how about this microphone this microphone don't have no cord all right that'll do anything for you kids because y'all yeah yeah i mean but this was big for us this was big i i i remember i could follow my sister i knew where my sister was at hey man just follow the phone cord we'd just go to the we'd go to the wall find the cord and use it fine it'd go down the hallway and there she was she had the phone yes we had quarters on our phones did y'all know that yes and we would talk like this on the phone i'm serious back in the day yeah you you had everything but now i remember when i first got my cell phone amen it was the neatest thing someone told me i could get a cell phone and i got one i went down there and got one of those big old phones there's a big old huge phone like this big old huge phone put it on my in my truck amen and back then they hooked through the they hooked to the horn and so amen when i'd be out on a on a service call or something i'd be up in the attic and all of a sudden you hear this honk honk honk honk well by the time i'd get out of the attic the hall of the neighborhood's going down that truck has got a demon that thing is there's something's wrong with that horn i said that's my phone pick this thing up and i was a they all looked at whoa what is that what have they done yeah they have hooked in to another dimension they found in that fourth dimension through those airwaves those sound waves those sideways that you can put a transmitter and now i've got this thing right here and it's going back over there there this is the receiver this is the that's the transmitter this is well i have one of the two did you know that you are built yes sir oh yes with a receiver and the transmitter how was it that brother branham could stand right here he could stand right here and he would start to tell you he wasn't telling you of those things of his own right there was a transmitter and a receiver and he was simply telling what the voice was telling him to say he was simply saying what the vision was telling with him in front of him oh come on now amen it was another dimension are you hearing me you see you are built with a spirit i'm fixing a clothes you are built with a spirit man and you have a receiver amen but god is not the only one with a transmitter yes sir the devil's got a transmitter and the devil will transmit jealousy and hatred and envy and strife but god will channel love and joy and peace and long suffering amen can you say man come on amen this place within your heart brother branham says your thoughts ring louder than your words the song says be careful little eyes what you see yeah awful little eyes what you see for the father up above is looking in tender love be careful little eyes what you see recognizing he's here oh yes now your spirit is actually magnetized to that spirit world spirits travel on words are you still with me your eyes and ears are the ushers to the soul of the songs and the tep vision and the internet and the text people are not aware that they're subject to spirits hallelujah but brother branham's are there in ephesians 2 and 2 it says wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience it's a spirit that is magnetized to the evil why they're in first corinthians 15 and 33 says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners hallelujah that's why it says in second timothy 2 and 16 amen but shun provine and vain babblings they will increase unto more ungodliness and their word will eat as death a canker and it's because we have allowed our hearts to be channeled somewhere else now i want you to think i'm bringing this into home right now yeah brother branham talks about a wandering thoughts wandering thoughts takes us from the presence of the lord yeah come on brother branham says the reason they do that is because they're not conscious that god is watching you lose the very thought of god being there listening at you come on god is putting down everything you're thinking about he knows it in his recording book your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on the earth think the right thing come on now i'm trying to get to that this is my best part right here so put your neighbor and say wake up hallelujah now you can't see god but he is here did you know that brother branham says there is a difference in the appearing of christ and the coming of christ he says this is my ministry to declare him that he is here i can't see god can you see a court all right come on does that mean this ain't a microphone does it mean it's not working testing one two three it's working you can't see the chord and you can't see god but god is in that other room brother branham said he that rather rim he says he's known he is he is standing three feet from me right now you can't see him he's in that other dimension oh yeah just like you can't you we should hallelujah we should not be able to be using this microphone right now come on yeah can you say amen amen how many listens to series so that xm 65 21x 75. now here i listen to it all the way in oklahoma i i i used xm65 it's a it's a christian station for you other unbelievers y'all need to switch channels so i could i drove off into canada as far north as i could drive all the way up as far north as i could drive all the way up to red lake there in in ontario and i could steal i could still catch them 65. amen what i'm trying to say is god is here in our midst brother branham talks about that dimension he says now we don't have any reverence to god everybody just thinks he is so secured until they don't they're not reverent like god to god like they should why why do they do this because they're not conscious of his presence they're not conscious of his presence that's the reason people do that they don't recognize it they can't they can't comprehend that they're in the presence of god their minds become so perverted and taken up in the things of the world till they can't even pay attention to it they go to church sure but to realize you're in the presence of god not only in church wherever you are in the presence of god if they could do as david i put the lord always before my face therefore i shall not be moved as long as the lord is before him he could not be moved can you say amen brother in another place he says now you've got to remember god is watching you every hour he watches you when you're asleep now the reason i think that people do these things is because they're not conscious of his presence but yet he is there whether you think he is or not he sees every look that you make every move that you make he knows all about it we ought to realize that the awareness am i making sense now brother branham says there's three things here on earth there's there's there's spirits down below the spirits of hell have come to earth spirits of
