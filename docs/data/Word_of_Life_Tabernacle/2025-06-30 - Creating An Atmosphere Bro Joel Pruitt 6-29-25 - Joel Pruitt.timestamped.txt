[34:55] word of prayer if we would.
[34:58] If you have a need on your heart
[34:59] tonight, we just make it known by an
[35:00] uplifted hand. Heavenly Father, we just
[35:03] want to thank you, Lord, for this
[35:04] opportunity to come again to your house
[35:06] tonight. Lord, I ask you would just move
[35:08] me aside, Lord, and only speak what the
[35:10] people meet up here, Lord, here in front
[35:13] of me this evening. I ask, Lord, you
[35:16] would take away anything that would be
[35:18] my own, Lord, may only be what you would
[35:19] have me to say. I pray Lord for every
[35:21] person sitting here tonight, every need
[35:22] that is represented among us. I ask Lord
[35:25] you would just move in a special way
[35:26] Lord and deal directly Lord with each
[35:29] individual heart here tonight. Move upon
[35:31] us we ask in the name of Jesus we pray.
[35:34] Amen. How many is happy to be in the
[35:36] church this evening
[35:39] to see each one of you back out tonight.
[35:40] If you have your Bibles, Genesis chapter
[35:42] 1 and verse one. Genesis chapter 1
[35:47] and verse one. And we'll read through
[35:49] the fourth verse to start. Genesis 1
[35:54] 1-4.
[35:56] In the beginning, God created the heaven
[35:58] and the earth. And the earth was without
[36:00] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[36:03] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[36:06] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[36:08] God said, "Let there be light." And
[36:11] there was light. And God saw the light
[36:13] that it was good. And God divided the
[36:15] light from the darkness. And in Acts
[36:18] chapter 2 and verse one, Acts chapter 2
[36:20] and verse one,
[36:23] just to lay just the scriptures we'll be
[36:25] using for tonight. Acts 2 and 1, it
[36:27] says, "And when the day of Pentecost was
[36:29] fully come, they were all with one
[36:30] accord in one place, and suddenly there
[36:33] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[36:36] mighty wind, and it filled all the house
[36:39] where they were sitting." You may be
[36:41] seated. May the Lord add his blessings
[36:43] to the word tonight. If I could take for
[36:45] a thought tonight, it would be creating
[36:48] an atmosphere. And if you go back to the
[36:50] very beginning, you'll find that the
[36:52] earth had been created. He created the
[36:54] heaven and earth. And brother Brandon
[36:56] would say it like this. Even though he
[36:58] created the heavens and earth, it didn't
[37:01] mean that it was like we know it now. It
[37:03] may have been laying there for in the
[37:05] void for thousands of years. We don't
[37:07] know because we know that he made it. He
[37:09] he created the earth as we know it in in
[37:12] in six days. But if you take it all the
[37:15] way back, brother Brandham said he it
[37:16] was just darkness and it was just
[37:18] something. It was a creation. Amen. But
[37:20] there was nothing there. There was no
[37:21] atmosphere to bring life in the
[37:24] beginning. So I hope you follow me
[37:25] through this just the best we can
[37:26] tonight. And I'll start my timer.
[37:29] Hallelujah. And uh somebody say amen.
[37:33] And so we'll just keep going here. And
[37:34] the earth did not have an atmosphere of
[37:38] life. The atmosphere that the earth had
[37:40] was darkness. It was gloomy. It was it
[37:42] was without it was without any form. It
[37:44] was it was it was nothing good. You
[37:47] couldn't have lived there. There was no
[37:48] human life. There was no animal life.
[37:50] Nothing could live in the earth as it
[37:52] was before God moved upon the earth. And
[37:56] so I want to deal with that for just a
[37:57] moment. I want you to know that you were
[38:00] created as a being. And you were you
[38:02] might have been a being. You might have
[38:03] been a created person for 20 years, 30
[38:05] years, 40 years, 50 years, but until the
[38:07] spirit of God moved upon you, there was
[38:10] darkness. Until God moved upon you,
[38:12] there was no light. Can you say amen?
[38:14] And so it it changed the very atmosphere
[38:17] that you would create. So the earth
[38:19] could put off an atmosphere of darkness,
[38:21] the earth would produce an atmosphere of
[38:24] nothing. It was just nothingness there.
[38:26] Amen. But once God's spirit would move
[38:28] upon it, then life would come. Can the
[38:31] church say amen? And it's very very much
[38:33] the same way on this earth here, this
[38:35] dirt that God has raised up, God has
[38:37] made, brother Bill, you're six foot of
[38:39] of dirt there. But when God moved upon
[38:41] you, there was no more darkness, but
[38:43] there was light. Can you say amen? And
[38:46] so what we want to say tonight is when
[38:48] is when God moves upon a person, when
[38:50] God moves upon your life, then it
[38:53] changes the very atmosphere that you
[38:55] create. And so, Brother Brandham would
[38:58] say it like this. He said, he said,
[38:59] "There was a time when the world was
[39:01] laying in utter darkness. It was without
[39:02] form and it was void and it was all
[39:04] covered with water and was laying there
[39:06] in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere.
[39:09] And the spirit of God moved upon that
[39:11] water and said, "Let there be light."
[39:12] And God had a reason to do that. For
[39:14] down beneath that water, there was seeds
[39:17] that he had planted. And it had to have
[39:20] that sunlight to make it alive. Can the
[39:22] church say amen? Amen. If you'll stay
[39:24] with me and follow me here, you'll
[39:25] notice that the same way it was then on
[39:27] the earth is the same way it is today in
[39:30] the human life. There was a seed there
[39:32] when you were in your darkest condition.
[39:34] There was a seed there when you didn't
[39:36] know God. There was a seed there when
[39:37] you had never seen the light. But when
[39:39] you saw the light, then God would not
[39:42] only create the he would not only create
[39:44] you because you were already created,
[39:46] but then he would put his spirit upon
[39:47] you and it would change the atmosphere
[39:50] that you're living in. I hope you can
[39:52] stay with me here for just a little bit
[39:53] tonight. I won't hold you long, but I
[39:55] really want to drive this home. We are
[39:57] all creators. We all create an
[39:59] atmosphere. every every person in this
[40:01] room on your jobs, in your homes and in
[40:04] the church, you're a creator and of the
[40:06] atmosphere around you. Amen. Can you say
[40:08] amen? So, so what we want to understand
[40:10] is that in order to change the
[40:12] atmosphere that you're creating, you've
[40:14] got to meet God and the presence of God
[40:17] has got to take away all the darkness in
[40:19] your life. And it's actually got to
[40:20] bring about an actual life and a light
[40:23] that will portray to the people around
[40:25] you. Amen. the the people could have
[40:27] looked at the world. If you could look
[40:28] back before there was a before there was
[40:30] an Adam, before there was an Eve, you
[40:32] could look all the way back and see the
[40:33] earth as it was and you would see
[40:35] darkness. Amen. I could look back at
[40:37] what you was, brother David, and I could
[40:39] say there was darkness in your life. But
[40:41] when God got a hold of you, amen, it
[40:43] changed the atmosphere and made you
[40:45] different. And we go on down. Brother
[40:47] Brandon would say it like this. He said
[40:49] that turned darkness into light in order
[40:50] to bring forth a creation of joy and
[40:53] life upon the earth. I want you to know
[40:55] you can't have joy in the house of God
[40:57] until God changes that creation of
[40:58] darkness into light. You You can't have
[41:01] Come on, church. You can say, "Amen. You
[41:04] can shout. You can jump and run. But
[41:05] until you've met God and until the
[41:08] presence of God has come, then you'll
[41:10] never know what light is. You'll never
[41:12] know what it's like to be free. You'll
[41:14] never know what it's like to be in an
[41:15] atmosphere of worship until you've met
[41:18] God's presence." Can you say amen? So,
[41:20] he goes on down. says it create the
[41:22] creation of joy and life upon the earth.
[41:24] He said then the spirit of God as it
[41:25] moved with love and compassion at that
[41:27] great day the first day of the dawn of
[41:29] creation upon the earth the sun rose and
[41:31] swept across its rays and dried up the
[41:33] waters from the earth and made an
[41:35] atmosphere above and for its first time
[41:38] it was to bring joy and life to the
[41:40] earth by a seed. I want you to notice
[41:43] that the seed that was in you had to
[41:46] come forth in newness of life. Can you
[41:48] say amen? Amen. So if there was a seed,
[41:50] then God had to find that seed and
[41:52] create light upon that seed. Can you say
[41:54] amen? Amen. So all you was, brother
[41:56] Bill, when you were the lowest sinner in
[41:59] the county, then God already knew there
[42:01] was a seed there. And when the spirit of
[42:03] God would move upon brother Bill, Amen,
[42:05] there would no longer be a brother Bill
[42:06] of the darkness, but there would be a
[42:08] brother Bill of the light. Well, can you
[42:10] say amen? So what we need tonight is not
[42:12] a God of darkness. This is not a guard
[42:15] of god of darkness but all the way from
[42:17] the beginning when the spirit of God
[42:18] would move there was light.
[42:21] And so light light is light is something
[42:23] that comes by a seed. He said that was a
[42:26] great hour and you know we were talking
[42:28] about being an amateur god and creating
[42:31] atmospheres. Brother Brandham would
[42:32] actually say it like this. Did you ever
[42:34] see people you love to be around just
[42:36] love to be around them because they
[42:38] create an atmosphere a heavenly and you
[42:41] like to be around them. Others seem to
[42:42] be good people, but you have to get away
[42:44] once in a while. Somebody says, "That's
[42:46] brother Joel." Hallelujah. But you know
[42:49] what it is? You you sometimes there's
[42:52] people that's hard to be around because
[42:53] they're, you know, they're just they're
[42:54] real tense or, you know, they they maybe
[42:56] they've still got a little temper in
[42:58] them or or something like that or maybe
[43:00] they're just unbearable to be around.
[43:02] But I want you to notice that you create
[43:03] an atmosphere.
[43:06] You create the atmosphere. It's not your
[43:07] brother. It's not your sister as we
[43:09] heard this morning. Amen. But I am
[43:11] creating the atmosphere from right here
[43:13] tonight. You're creating an atmosphere
[43:14] from where you're sitting. Because in
[43:16] the beginning, God was there and he saw
[43:19] what the atmosphere was and then he
[43:21] changed the atmosphere of the earth. And
[43:24] if you are an immature God, according to
[43:26] Genesis 1 and 26, it would say, "And God
[43:28] said, let us make man in our image after
[43:30] our likeness, and let them have dominion
[43:32] over the fish of the sea, and over the
[43:33] fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
[43:34] and over all the earth, and every
[43:36] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[43:37] earth." What was it? You were given the
[43:39] the ability at that time uh in the word
[43:43] to create an atmosphere. Can you say
[43:45] amen? Amen. So God actually gave you
[43:48] that ability because you are like an
[43:50] amateur God. God's spirit in you can
[43:54] still create atmospheres today. And so
[43:56] when you see an atmosphere of darkness,
[43:58] it is the time to change the atmosphere.
[44:01] If you see an atmosphere in the church
[44:03] where it's quiet, if you see an
[44:05] atmosphere in the church where there's
[44:06] just no smoothing of God, I think it's
[44:08] time as believers to raise up and let
[44:10] the spirit of God move once again and
[44:12] get rid of the darkness in the room so
[44:14] that can we can worship freely in an
[44:17] atmosphere of freedom and worship.
[44:19] Brother Rain would go on like this. He
[44:21] said he he said he said that we had
[44:22] dominion over the whole earth and he was
[44:24] made to be an amateur god. Now, I want
[44:27] you to notice that there is something
[44:28] you've got to have in order to create
[44:30] the right atmosphere because there's all
[44:32] kinds of atmospheres in the world today.
[44:34] You can walk into a bar and there's an
[44:36] atmosphere there. You can walk into a a
[44:38] an a nominal church maybe and they can
[44:41] have the loud music and they can they
[44:42] can be in their skinny jeans and their
[44:44] shorts and and they can do all those
[44:46] things and they can create an
[44:47] atmosphere, but it may not be a godly
[44:49] atmosphere. Well, can you say amen? And
[44:51] so, you can see that you can see that
[44:54] there's different atmospheres. So maybe
[44:56] the atmosphere you're creating because
[44:58] of your ability to create one is not
[45:00] necessarily the atmosphere that you were
[45:02] born to create. So brother Brandon would
[45:05] say it like this. He said he said you've
[45:07] got to apply the token with such love
[45:10] and so forth till you know it's going to
[45:12] take it's going to take place. And he
[45:14] said that's all. Apply it in confidence
[45:16] believing it's going to help. And he
[45:18] said when you talk to that child when
[45:19] you talk to your husband talk to your
[45:21] wife talk to this loved one believing
[45:23] that it's going to help. just stand
[45:24] there and say, "Lord, I've claimed them.
[45:26] They're mine. I'm getting them for you,
[45:28] Lord." He said, "Apply it and create the
[45:30] atmosphere around you that they'll drop
[45:33] right into it." So, it's not good enough
[45:35] for you to say, "I believe the message
[45:36] and we need you to come back to church.
[45:38] We want you to live right, do right."
[45:39] No, you've got to create an atmosphere
[45:41] so that they can drop back into that.
[45:43] Come on, church. They don't want to go
[45:45] somewhere where you're creating a bad
[45:46] atmosphere. They don't want to go
[45:48] somewhere somewhere that's so tight and
[45:50] so bound up that you can't raise your
[45:51] hands and worship that you young people
[45:53] don't want to come back to that. They
[45:55] left that deadness in the beginning.
[45:56] They left it went out in the world.
[45:58] Listen, there's more freedom in the barn
[46:00] than there is in some of our churches.
[46:01] Come on, somebody. And that's why that
[46:03] they're not coming back. But if you'll
[46:05] create an atmosphere in the house of
[46:07] God, there could be eagles born right
[46:09] here. Come on, church. You say, "Well,
[46:11] is it all about the atmosphere?" No.
[46:13] There's all kinds of atmospheres. But we
[46:15] want to create the right atmosphere and
[46:17] that's where we're going to see souls
[46:18] saved and children come back to the
[46:20] Lord. Can you say amen? Brother Brandham
[46:23] would say it like this. He said, "I've
[46:24] I've claimed them." And he said,
[46:26] "They'll drop right into it if you
[46:27] create that atmosphere around you." He
[46:28] said, "Oh, there you are. If you've got
[46:30] the token, you create a spirit around
[46:33] you." That's right. He said, "A power
[46:36] that when you walk, people know you're a
[46:38] Christian." Come on. They love for you
[46:41] to say something to them. They believe
[46:43] your word. what you say, they hold on to
[46:45] it. See, that's it. Now, nobody's going
[46:48] to do that to somebody that comes in and
[46:50] shouts in one service and goes and lives
[46:52] like the devil on Monday morning.
[46:54] They're not going to listen to what you
[46:55] say is the token. But if the token is
[46:58] applied, then there is a power within
[47:00] you to create an atmosphere on Sunday
[47:02] and on Monday and on Tuesday and on
[47:05] Wednesday. You're going to always create
[47:07] an atmosphere that is pleasing to God.
[47:09] That doesn't mean you won't make
[47:10] mistakes. That doesn't mean you're not
[47:12] going to fail God. But what it means is
[47:15] God's going to bring you back because
[47:16] the spirit that is in you is your guide.
[47:19] Can you say amen? So when you start to
[47:21] fall away, when you start to when you
[47:23] start to get away from God, you start to
[47:24] get cold on God. Amen. You start to
[47:26] realize the atmosphere you're creating
[47:28] is no longer pleasing to God and there's
[47:30] more darkness than light. Amen. Just get
[47:32] back in fellowship with God again and
[47:34] let the spirit of God go to work on your
[47:36] life. Amen. And that will change the
[47:38] atmosphere back to what it's supposed to
[47:40] be. Brother Brandon would go on like
[47:42] this. He said, "You've heard my message
[47:43] on the possum and you know and on the
[47:45] bees trying to sting me and the bull
[47:46] trying to kill me." He said, "You create
[47:48] an atmosphere and that's the atmosphere
[47:50] you have to be in to pray for the sick."
[47:52] And so before I would ever make an altar
[47:54] call, I want to feel an atmosphere here
[47:56] that we can create. Come on, church. I I
[47:59] believe anybody here can come to an
[48:00] altar at any time and get saved. But I
[48:02] believe it's more effective if we'll
[48:04] create an atmosphere where they can come
[48:06] back and pray through. Come on, church.
[48:07] Amen. If you're in a hurry to get out of
[48:09] here and there's people at the altar,
[48:10] you're not creating the right kind of
[48:12] atmosphere.
[48:14] Can the church say amen? It's just the
[48:16] truth. If you've got people at the
[48:18] altar, the atmosphere you create is an
[48:20] atmosphere of worship so they can get
[48:22] something from God. Come on, church.
[48:24] There's nothing more important than a
[48:25] soul coming back to God. Amen. That's
[48:27] when the angels rejoice. That's when the
[48:29] church will rejoice. That's when the
[48:31] fire will come back in the church. When
[48:33] souls start coming back to God. And so I
[48:35] say if somebody wants to pray and they
[48:38] want to stay there for an hour and pray,
[48:39] let them pray. Let them stay there.
[48:41] Listen, church, and let's get behind
[48:42] them and and help them. Come on, church.
[48:44] Listen, what we're doing is we get in a
[48:46] hurry about the things of the world and
[48:48] we get in a hurry to do what we want to
[48:49] do. But did you ever think you were put
[48:51] here to see souls saved? You were put
[48:54] here to create an atmosphere. You were
[48:56] put here and ordained to help somebody
[48:59] make it. Come on, church. Amen. What you
[49:01] need to realize tonight, Amen. You can
[49:03] create all kinds of atmospheres, but in
[49:05] this service tonight, I want to create
[49:06] an atmosphere, amen, where young people
[49:09] can say, "Lord, I want to come home. I
[49:11] want to be saved. I want to be baptized.
[49:13] I want to be filled with the Holy
[49:14] Ghost." Amen. We've had services like
[49:16] that, but don't let one service go by
[49:18] where we don't create an atmosphere
[49:20] where our young people can come back
[49:22] home. I I I say I I've seen I've seen
[49:25] our I've seen people here in the church
[49:27] come back home. And not to single any of
[49:28] them out, but I remember the service
[49:30] when Sister Stephanie came back to the
[49:31] Lord. Amen. There was an atmosphere here
[49:33] where souls could be born again. Come
[49:35] on, church. What we need to realize
[49:37] tonight is it's not about how I feel.
[49:39] It's not about what you want, but it's
[49:41] about him being glorified in this church
[49:44] tonight. Amen. God wants you to be in
[49:47] such a fellowship with him that an
[49:48] atmosphere is created so the people
[49:51] around you can see the light. Amen. I I
[49:54] don't want him to see darkness all my
[49:55] life because darkness is just listen.
[49:58] Dark darkness will run people from the
[49:59] church. Darkness will move people out
[50:01] from this church, but but light will
[50:03] draw them in. Amen. And the and the
[50:05] darker the night, the the the brighter
[50:06] the light will shine. Amen. So, I
[50:08] believe in the darkest time we've ever
[50:10] been in the history of the world. Amen.
[50:12] Your light ought to be shining brighter
[50:13] than ever. But it's got to be a creation
[50:16] of an atmosphere around you that'll do
[50:18] it. Brother Brand would go on down here
[50:20] and I love this. He he actually says
[50:23] something nice about Brother Neville
[50:25] creating an atmosphere. And he said,
[50:27] "How many enjoys our pastor, brother
[50:28] Neville?" He said, 'Aren't you thankful
[50:30] to the Lord for a good, honest, everyday
[50:32] man believes the gospel? And he's doing
[50:34] such a wonderful job by obeying the
[50:36] commandments of God and preaching the
[50:38] word and keeping this great spiritual
[50:40] atmosphere in the church all the time.
[50:44] All the time. I want you to notice it's
[50:47] not good enough to come and say, "Well,
[50:48] we're going to try to work this up for
[50:50] Sunday morning, or we're going to try to
[50:51] build a Sunday afternoon, or we're going
[50:53] to try to" No, we don't sit around
[50:54] trying to build a certain service. Every
[50:57] service is important to create an
[50:58] atmosphere in. Amen. That's why from the
[51:00] first song to the last and everything
[51:02] that's said in between. Amen. It's not
[51:04] about me. It's not about brother Ben or
[51:05] brother Stewart or any other man that
[51:07] stands in this pulpit, but it's all
[51:09] about magnifying the Lord. Amen.
[51:11] Glorifying his name and creating an
[51:13] atmosphere that he would be pleased
[51:15] with. Amen. This all I believe tonight
[51:18] we can create an atmosphere. If there's
[51:20] somebody called on God tonight, I say
[51:22] get back to an altar and pray through.
[51:24] You've got people in the church that are
[51:25] behind you. And man, we're not here to
[51:27] judge people that have gotten cold on
[51:29] God. We're here to help the people and
[51:31] pull them through the times when they've
[51:33] gotten cold. You say, "Well, we we sit
[51:34] around. We talk about the people that
[51:36] have backslid." Amen. It's time we quit
[51:38] talking about the people that have
[51:39] backslid and start praying for the
[51:40] people that have backslid. Amen. That
[51:42] all you're doing when you're when you're
[51:44] creating a negative atmosphere and
[51:46] running them down and running them away
[51:47] from the church, that's not going to
[51:49] help nobody. Amen. But let's bring them
[51:50] back and pray them through and hold on
[51:53] and say, "Lord, these are your children.
[51:55] We're not going to lose a one of them."
[51:58] Can you say, "Amen." Brother Brandon
[52:00] would say it like this. He said, "Now,
[52:02] what you want to do is be lifted up by
[52:04] Christ into an atmosphere to where you
[52:06] are happy, peaceful, and in there, you
[52:09] create a situation."
[52:11] That's right. Now, there's many
[52:12] situations created by people that,
[52:16] myself included, when you say something
[52:18] you shouldn't say or do something you
[52:20] shouldn't do. We'll create situations.
[52:23] Come on, somebody. And the pastor has to
[52:25] clean it up. The pastor has to take care
[52:27] of it. You know, we say stupid stuff. I
[52:30] think brother Ben said we all do this
[52:31] morning. And so, that makes me feel good
[52:33] because I'm in good company. That means
[52:35] all of us do it because I know I do it.
[52:39] You know, you say stuff and it creates a
[52:40] situation. and you say something you
[52:42] shouldn't say and somebody in the church
[52:43] gets offended by it and you probably
[52:45] maybe you didn't mean to do it. Amen.
[52:47] But what you did was you caused a
[52:49] negative uh situation by creating a bad
[52:52] atmosphere when what you should have
[52:54] done was kept your mouth shut. Help me
[52:56] Lord. And prayed for the person instead
[52:59] of talking bad about the person. Can the
[53:01] church say amen? You say, "Brother Joel,
[53:03] are you guilty?" Yes. Because because
[53:05] sometimes my mouth opens before I think
[53:06] about it. And and I'm going to tell you,
[53:08] every one of us probably have that
[53:09] problem if we be honest about it. Amen.
[53:11] We're keyboard warriors on Facebook or
[53:13] or we're trying to we're trying to talk
[53:15] about somebody because it's an
[53:17] interesting situation. But why not solve
[53:19] the situation by creating a good
[53:21] atmosphere? This church was not built
[53:23] here. This church was not was not made
[53:25] to to to start start pointing fingers at
[53:28] one another because if you do that,
[53:30] you're going to be pointing for back at
[53:31] yourself. But I want you to notice
[53:33] something. We're not pointing fingers at
[53:34] one another because this one didn't do
[53:36] me right or this one offended me or this
[53:38] one did me wrong. Listen, church, we're
[53:39] all guilty. We've all failed God. But I
[53:42] want to tell you tonight that God cares
[53:44] for you and he wants you to be in an
[53:46] atmosphere that he can be pleased with.
[53:49] Amen. God wants you to have an
[53:51] atmosphere around you. I want to take
[53:52] this into our homes just for a minute
[53:54] because if your homes have got a bad
[53:56] atmosphere, then there's no way that you
[53:58] could ever have an atmosphere of worship
[54:00] in your home if you're always fussing
[54:02] with one another.
[54:04] Is this okay tonight? You know, you say,
[54:07] "Brother Joel, are you guilty of any?"
[54:08] Absolutely. You ever have a bad day at
[54:10] work and you walk in your home and you
[54:11] snap at your kids? You don't have to
[54:13] raise your hand, but I guarantee you
[54:15] somebody has because it happens. let the
[54:18] pressures of life build up and you say
[54:19] things you shouldn't have said. But the
[54:22] truth is there is a way to create that
[54:25] atmosphere and change it from that gloom
[54:27] that you created into a light. Can you
[54:30] say amen? So, brother Brandon would say
[54:32] it like this and I don't have the quote
[54:33] in front of me. I took it out actually.
[54:34] But brother Brandon would say it like
[54:36] this. He said he said he was at home and
[54:38] he said that his kids were I think
[54:40] brother Joseph was was fighting over a
[54:42] toy and and Sarah was maybe fighting
[54:44] with him over the toys and and and then
[54:46] Ma was standing in there and she'd had
[54:48] all she could take and and it seemed
[54:49] like that happened more than once. You
[54:51] know, must have been some wild kids in
[54:52] the Brandom household. But but brother
[54:54] Brandham walks in and he sees the
[54:56] situation and instead of making a worse
[54:59] situation, he actually changes the
[55:01] atmosphere by putting on an apron and
[55:03] doing the dishes. You say, "What does
[55:05] that have to do with creating an
[55:06] atmosphere?" It actually ta it took the
[55:09] pressure off the family and he could
[55:11] stand there and say, "You know what? I'd
[55:13] like to buy you this dress or I'd like
[55:14] to help you out." Or the next thing you
[55:16] know, he said it changed the entire
[55:18] atmosphere of the home by one man taking
[55:21] leadership and accountability and
[55:24] changing the whole environment. Come on,
[55:25] somebody. If you want to change the way
[55:27] the church is, you be the change in the
[55:29] church. If you want to be the you want
[55:31] to see change in your home, then I you
[55:33] be the change in your home. Somebody say
[55:35] amen. If you want to see change, be the
[55:38] change. If you want to create an
[55:40] atmosphere here, you say, "Well, we're
[55:42] not we're not we're not emotional enough
[55:43] here in the church. We don't shout
[55:45] enough. We don't scream enough." Well,
[55:46] somebody's got to shout once in a while.
[55:48] And you say, "Well, I wish I'd see
[55:50] somebody run. Somebody's got to run, and
[55:52] it might as well be you." Come on,
[55:54] church. We want to create an atmosphere,
[55:56] amen, where it's more loud. And then,
[55:59] well, go ahead and be the loud person in
[56:01] church. Everybody wants to Everybody
[56:03] wants to I've got Jonah. That's all I
[56:04] can do. I've done I'm doing my part. I'm
[56:06] bringing the loudest a manor in the
[56:08] whole church here. And I I'm I'm going
[56:10] to tell you something. Everybody wants
[56:11] to be the critic, but nobody wants to
[56:13] create the atmosphere. And if you really
[56:15] want to see God move, create the
[56:16] atmosphere. And if you don't move for
[56:18] nobody else, he'll move for you.
[56:21] Come on. You say, "I want my family to
[56:23] come back home." If the church would
[56:24] just create an atmosphere, the best
[56:25] atmosphere that can be created is right
[56:27] there from your seat. That's right. If
[56:29] you're worshiping, the song leader will
[56:30] do better. If you're worshiping, the
[56:33] preacher will do better. That's right.
[56:35] It's the truth anyway. It if you're
[56:37] worshiping, it'll make a difference in
[56:39] the whole church because you're creating
[56:41] an atmosphere.
[56:43] If I come up here and I'm having a bad
[56:45] day leading songs or Brother Allen or
[56:47] Brother David, if we're up here and
[56:48] we've had a bad day, but we got to be
[56:49] here anyway and do and and lead the
[56:51] songs. Listen, it may create a bad
[56:53] atmosphere in the church, but you know,
[56:55] instead of getting mad at us for being
[56:56] mad or getting mad at us for having a
[56:59] bad day, the best thing you can do is
[57:01] pray for that brother. Your pastor could
[57:04] come out here and deal with something
[57:05] that day to where it actually affects
[57:07] his atmosphere when he comes to the
[57:08] pulpit. He may have prayed through and
[57:10] did everything he could to do to get the
[57:12] right atmosphere, but maybe he dealt
[57:14] with something that he that he just
[57:15] couldn't get past to get in the pulpit,
[57:17] but he had to stand here at his calling
[57:19] anyway. Can I tell you how to fix that
[57:21] situation? Pray for the man and pull on
[57:23] the gift of God.
[57:26] See, if we quit pointing fingers saying,
[57:27] "I wish that service was better." Make
[57:29] the service better. Come on.
[57:34] Is this okay? I know your pastor don't
[57:36] yell at you like I do, and I shouldn't
[57:38] do it, but it's just me. Okay? And a lot
[57:41] of times I'm preaching it myself when
[57:42] I'm preaching because if anybody needs
[57:44] to change their atmosphere, listen, if
[57:46] you knew if you knew the environment we
[57:47] was raised in, you know, there was there
[57:49] was a lot of times we'd get to church
[57:50] and we dreaded going to church. We had
[57:53] to go to church, but we dreaded going to
[57:54] church. And you know, but what I found
[57:56] out is it's actually fun to go to church
[57:59] when you realize that you can put
[58:00] everything behind you and just have a
[58:02] good time in the house of God.
[58:04] And you don't have to be depressed in
[58:06] church. You don't have to be down
[58:08] because you think the preacher is going
[58:09] to hold you three hours. You don't have
[58:11] to be down because you think, well, you
[58:13] know, you know that person don't like me
[58:15] that's in the pulpit. I want you to know
[58:16] that it really don't matter if the
[58:18] person in the pulpit likes you or don't
[58:19] like you. It does God find favor with
[58:21] your worship or not? Listen, I I don't
[58:23] believe in disliking anybody. I think
[58:25] it's an evil spirit to dislike people.
[58:28] Brother Brandham taught us that. That's
[58:29] right. You know that. Said, "Well, it's
[58:32] wrong to hate people." No, Brother
[58:32] Brandham said it's an evil spirit to
[58:34] dislike people. That's right. It's an
[58:35] evil spirit that gets on people. And so
[58:37] when you start disliking somebody and
[58:39] what they're doing, listen, you you
[58:41] don't have to love everything that goes
[58:42] on in a service, but the only way you're
[58:44] going to get anything out of that
[58:45] service is to break through and create
[58:47] an atmosphere. And so what we've got to
[58:49] do, quit looking at the distractions and
[58:52] and look at the promise that God will be
[58:55] there. And if he's there, then we know
[58:58] we're going to get what we came for.
[58:59] Brother Brandon would say, he said,
[59:00] "Many times we churches, we this may
[59:02] seem strange." He said, "But if you
[59:03] watch it," he said, he said, "the people
[59:05] get one another's spirit instead of
[59:07] getting the Holy Spirit." You go into a
[59:09] group of people, you watch the way that
[59:10] person acts and them find people, they
[59:12] come into the congregation. The first
[59:14] thing you know, they act that same way.
[59:16] He said, "You you take a good woman and
[59:17] a bad man, and he'll either become a bad
[59:19] a good man or or she a bad woman." And
[59:22] the atmosphere that you live in, you
[59:24] project to your associates what you are.
[59:28] Think about that. on your job. Your
[59:30] associates know what you are. Whether
[59:34] you tell them or whether you don't, they
[59:36] know what you are. If you're a
[59:39] Christian, most of the time they can
[59:40] tell because the way you act on the job.
[59:44] If you blow up and start cussing your
[59:46] coworker, then they are not going to
[59:47] look at you as a Christian. If you blow
[59:50] up and just fly off the handle and get
[59:51] mad at everything, they're not going to
[59:53] look at you as a Christian. But what you
[59:56] do is if you if you if you have love for
[59:59] that person that mistreats you at work,
[1:00:01] they'll look at you and know there's
[1:00:02] something different about you. They may
[1:00:04] never become a Christian, but they'll
[1:00:06] know you are. Listen, church, what you
[1:00:08] you you are you are born to be a light
[1:00:11] in a dark time. And the only way you can
[1:00:13] do that is be a creator of the right
[1:00:16] atmosphere. Brother Brand would go on
[1:00:17] like this. He said, "What time of an
[1:00:19] what type of an atmosphere should we
[1:00:21] live in?" He and I love this. He said,
[1:00:23] "In a consoling, soothing, healing
[1:00:26] atmosphere, we should live in with our
[1:00:29] hearts constantly in prayer with a deep
[1:00:32] love for every person we come in contact
[1:00:34] with." Yes, sir. I ought to read that
[1:00:37] one again because I don't think you all
[1:00:38] got it. He said, "What type of an
[1:00:40] atmosphere should we live in?" In a
[1:00:42] consoling, soothing, healing atmosphere
[1:00:44] we should live in with our hearts
[1:00:46] constantly in prayer with a deep love
[1:00:49] for every person. Yes. Somebody say
[1:00:52] amen. Every person we come in contact
[1:00:55] with, that doesn't mean your favorite
[1:00:56] person in church or it doesn't mean the
[1:00:58] only the people you work with or only
[1:01:00] the people you go to church with, but
[1:01:02] every person you should have a deep love
[1:01:04] for that person. And if you do, there'll
[1:01:07] be something respond to that deep love
[1:01:09] that you have. Oh, thank you, Lord. Is
[1:01:12] that okay tonight? Listen, I know a lot
[1:01:14] of times, you know, we can get
[1:01:15] frustrated with people and and and in
[1:01:18] your flesh there there's carnality.
[1:01:20] Brother Brand or Brother Ben this
[1:01:21] morning, he he talked about your carnal
[1:01:24] nature. He he said something controls
[1:01:26] the the spirit. And he said it's either
[1:01:28] your carnal nature or or the in inside
[1:01:31] spirit that creates these things. And I
[1:01:34] I will say this many times. If there's
[1:01:36] never a good atmosphere around you, it's
[1:01:38] because you need the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:41] You say that's hard. No, I'm going tell
[1:01:43] you something. I I don't question your
[1:01:45] Holy Ghost. But but but if one way to
[1:01:47] know you don't have it is if you've
[1:01:49] never created a good atmosphere to live
[1:01:50] in. Yeah. Come on church. The Holy Ghost
[1:01:53] is not going to make you live in a doomy
[1:01:55] gloomy gloomy atmosphere in a in a
[1:01:58] hateful atmosphere. He He's not going to
[1:02:00] cause your home to be in constant chaos
[1:02:02] if you find yourself in that situation.
[1:02:04] It's time you find yourself at the altar
[1:02:06] again and say, "Lord, I need the Holy
[1:02:09] Ghost." Yeah. I I I know we don't want
[1:02:11] to tell people they need it. But I want
[1:02:12] you to know if you find yourself without
[1:02:14] it, you need to be seeking it tonight
[1:02:16] because it's not good enough to say,
[1:02:18] "Well, the preacher preached it good
[1:02:19] this morning, and that'll help me for a
[1:02:21] couple days, and I'm going to be right
[1:02:22] back like I was." No, you need to be
[1:02:24] always creating an atmosphere in your
[1:02:27] home so your children can come up in the
[1:02:30] presence of God. Thank you, Lord. Y'all
[1:02:32] still with me tonight? We're going to go
[1:02:34] just a little bit longer if it's okay.
[1:02:37] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[1:02:39] He said, he said, "He ascended up on
[1:02:42] high and gave gifts unto men, his spirit
[1:02:45] in us. There was an atmosphere hung over
[1:02:48] the earth of darkness, of gloom, of
[1:02:49] death and weary, and the prayers that
[1:02:51] couldn't come up because the atonement
[1:02:53] wasn't made. But he broke through that
[1:02:55] veil and he opened up the way. He broke
[1:02:58] the veil of sickness. He broke the veil
[1:03:00] of sin." Come on, somebody. He broke the
[1:03:02] veil of weary. He broke the veil of
[1:03:05] depressed. He broke every veil and made
[1:03:08] a highway for the wayfaring man walking
[1:03:10] up the king's highway. You say, "I've
[1:03:12] got depression." He broke the veil of
[1:03:14] depression. You say, "I I've got
[1:03:16] weariness in my body. I've got I've got
[1:03:18] sickness in my body." He broke the veil
[1:03:20] so that you could find healing and
[1:03:22] satisfaction in the atmosphere of God
[1:03:26] that he's created. Listen, church, we've
[1:03:27] leaned on crutches long enough. It's
[1:03:29] time to create an atmosphere that God is
[1:03:32] pleased with. Can you say amen? Amen. He
[1:03:35] broke the veil. He broke every veil and
[1:03:37] made a highway for the wayfaring man.
[1:03:40] I love this here in Colossians 3:12. Put
[1:03:43] on therefore as the elect of God, holy
[1:03:45] and beloved, vows of mercy, kindness,
[1:03:47] humbleness of mind, meekness,
[1:03:48] longsuffering. All these things will
[1:03:51] create a true and godly atmosphere.
[1:03:53] That's right. All these things will do
[1:03:55] the opposite of a of a bad home. All
[1:03:59] these things here, if you put on as the
[1:04:01] elect of God, holy and beloved, bounds
[1:04:02] of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind,
[1:04:05] meekness, and longsuffering, it will
[1:04:07] create a happy home. Can the church say
[1:04:09] amen? It will create a home that God
[1:04:11] would be pleased with. It will create a
[1:04:13] church that God to be pleased with.
[1:04:15] Listen, we can there there's somebody
[1:04:17] here that knows a lot more about this
[1:04:18] message than I do. I believe every bit
[1:04:20] of it, but I can tell you, you may have
[1:04:22] a better knowledge and understanding of
[1:04:23] it. But I want you to know tonight that
[1:04:25] if you don't have love, it don't matter
[1:04:27] what you know. Amen. You can know
[1:04:29] everything and create a bad atmosphere.
[1:04:31] You can know all the mysteries and
[1:04:33] create a bad atmosphere. But if you can
[1:04:35] have love, that'll create an atmosphere
[1:04:37] where people want to come and be in
[1:04:38] church with you. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:04:42] We do have a way out of a gloomy
[1:04:44] atmosphere. How many knows that to be
[1:04:46] true? Brother Brandon would say it like
[1:04:48] this. He said he said the Presbyterian
[1:04:50] church, the Methodist church, the
[1:04:51] Baptist church, and anything can bring
[1:04:52] forth these eagles. Sure. It's the
[1:04:54] atmosphere that does it. Come on. And he
[1:04:58] said, brother, he said, Dr. Bosworth
[1:04:59] used to say you could take a hen and and
[1:05:03] uh under the put eggs under the pup. You
[1:05:06] could take a hen setting an egg and and
[1:05:08] put the put the eggs under a pup and tie
[1:05:10] them down and a pup would hatch out a
[1:05:11] chicken. Why? It's the atmosphere that
[1:05:13] did it. Think about it. You say, "Well,
[1:05:17] I I I was saved in a Baptist church."
[1:05:19] Sure you were. But you weren't born
[1:05:21] again till you heard the scream of the
[1:05:23] eagle flying over the barnyard.
[1:05:25] Come on, church. That'll that'll that'll
[1:05:26] that'll solve some problems right there.
[1:05:29] When you say, "Well," you say, "Well, I
[1:05:30] was born again in in this church." No,
[1:05:32] you wasn't born again, but you were
[1:05:34] born. You might have been born a
[1:05:35] Presbyterian or a Baptist. I'm not I'm
[1:05:37] not saying you wasn't saved there.
[1:05:39] There'll be many saved. But if you want
[1:05:40] the new birth, you've got to recognize
[1:05:42] the eagle scream in order to know who
[1:05:44] you are. Come on, church. In order to
[1:05:46] recognize the voice that has called you
[1:05:48] an eagle, you've got to recognize Come
[1:05:51] on, somebody. You say, "Well, I don't
[1:05:53] agree with you, Brother Joel." Well,
[1:05:54] I'll tell you this. Because a a an eagle
[1:05:56] could be hatched under a chicken or a
[1:05:58] chicken could be hatched under a puppy.
[1:06:01] But but an eagle that's born, they will
[1:06:03] not stay in that condition because of
[1:06:05] the atmosphere that the chickens have
[1:06:07] created. But when they hear the voice of
[1:06:10] the eagle or they smell the water, if
[1:06:13] it's a duck and it smells the water,
[1:06:15] it's going to go straight to the water.
[1:06:16] Why? Because it creates an atmosphere
[1:06:18] that they can swim in. Come on, church.
[1:06:21] Amen. But if it's an eagle, then they
[1:06:23] recognize that there's something they're
[1:06:24] missing here. And they'll fly higher
[1:06:26] with the moment eagle. Listen, it's
[1:06:28] because they heard the voice and they'll
[1:06:30] fly into an atmosphere.
[1:06:33] I hope the church is hearing me tonight.
[1:06:35] Many times you say, "Well, I was saved.
[1:06:37] I was saved. I'm good enough. No. And
[1:06:39] not. You need to get out of that
[1:06:40] atmosphere and realize that you were
[1:06:42] born for more than just a barnyard. You
[1:06:44] were born more than just to scratching
[1:06:47] the dirt with the chickens. You were
[1:06:48] born for more than just to just eat the
[1:06:50] food that is prepared for the chickens.
[1:06:53] But you were born to fly into the
[1:06:55] heavenlies and and feel the atmosphere
[1:06:58] that God would create for you. God never
[1:07:00] created that caged up condition for you.
[1:07:03] Are you hearing me tonight? But he
[1:07:05] created an atmosphere in the heavenlies
[1:07:08] so you don't have to stay earthbound any
[1:07:10] longer. I hope you're okay with this
[1:07:12] tonight. Amen. But if you are if you are
[1:07:14] an eagle, you're longing for another
[1:07:16] atmosphere. If you are an eagle, you're
[1:07:17] not satisfied with this world. If you
[1:07:20] are an eagle, you're not happy with the
[1:07:21] way this world is going. If you're an
[1:07:23] eagle, you're not happy being caged up
[1:07:25] and told you can't shout and told you
[1:07:27] can't dance and told you can't fly. But
[1:07:30] if you are an eagle, you're going to
[1:07:31] take your liberty into the heavenlies.
[1:07:35] Are you still with me tonight? Listen,
[1:07:37] church. I I know you're tired, but I'm
[1:07:39] going to preach through it anyway
[1:07:40] because I'm going to tell you something.
[1:07:42] If you're an eagle, you love going to
[1:07:43] church. If you're an eagle, you love to
[1:07:45] praise God. If you're an eagle, you know
[1:07:47] you heard a voice and it told you who
[1:07:50] you were. You were no longer a chicken,
[1:07:53] but you are an eagle. Can the church say
[1:07:55] amen? He said, what it is, it's the
[1:07:57] atmosphere. when any church or any group
[1:07:59] that'll assemble themselves together and
[1:08:00] pray until they throw away their creeds
[1:08:03] and things and look straight in the face
[1:08:04] of God, it'll bring forth eagles just as
[1:08:06] certain as I'm standing here. He said,
[1:08:08] "That's what I think that this
[1:08:09] businessmen's group has done, trying to
[1:08:11] break up the atmosphere. We're getting
[1:08:12] two clanish. One belongs to this and and
[1:08:14] that. Let's break up the atmosphere and
[1:08:16] get the atmosphere in a heavenly
[1:08:17] worship. Get the atmosphere right. And
[1:08:20] eagles will be born out of any church
[1:08:22] anywhere." Oh yes. Come on. You mean
[1:08:25] they can't just be born out of word of
[1:08:26] life? No, sir. They can be born out of
[1:08:28] any church anywhere. Any eagle can be
[1:08:30] born out of anywhere. But I want you to
[1:08:32] know that you could be you could be an
[1:08:34] eagle and still chained or bound in a
[1:08:36] barnyard. Can you say amen? You could
[1:08:39] still be out of your position and be an
[1:08:41] eagle, but you'll be in a bad atmosphere
[1:08:44] as long as you stay there. But when they
[1:08:46] were in the upper room in one accord and
[1:08:48] they were sitting there waiting for the
[1:08:50] promise of God, they knew they were
[1:08:52] eagles, but they were waiting to be
[1:08:53] endued with power so that they could fly
[1:08:56] higher than the things of the world.
[1:08:57] Well, can you hear me tonight and say,
[1:08:59] "I'm an eagle." Somebody say, "I'm an
[1:09:01] eagle. I'm an eagle. I'm born to fly
[1:09:03] higher. I was made to live a life above
[1:09:06] reproach. I was made to be more than
[1:09:08] just a barnyard bird, but I was made and
[1:09:11] created to fly in the heavenlies." Thank
[1:09:14] you, Lord. You say, "Well, that's pretty
[1:09:15] simple." Well, I I think if we forget
[1:09:17] who we are and you get to thinking,
[1:09:18] "It's okay to be a chicken or it's okay
[1:09:20] to be in the barnyard or it's okay to be
[1:09:22] caged down." Listen, a and a believer a
[1:09:24] believer does not want to be bound down
[1:09:26] to the things of the world. The the
[1:09:28] things of the world might bind a
[1:09:29] believer up, but they don't want to be
[1:09:31] that way. They are always longing for
[1:09:33] the heavenly atmosphere to take control
[1:09:35] of their life. And so what I would say
[1:09:37] tonight, if you find yourself in a
[1:09:39] situation where you feel no freedom of
[1:09:41] the spirit, where you feel no God moving
[1:09:43] in your home, where you feel nothing
[1:09:45] moving in the service, I would say it's
[1:09:47] time to hear the voice again and fly
[1:09:49] higher than you've been flying. And live
[1:09:51] a life higher than what you've been
[1:09:53] living. And don't point fingers at
[1:09:55] somebody else and say, "Well, that over
[1:09:56] there's a chicken. That might be a
[1:09:57] chicken." But you're not a chicken.
[1:09:59] You're an eagle. And if you're an eagle,
[1:10:01] you were the one that was made to fly
[1:10:03] higher. Can you say, "Amen." Amen. Don't
[1:10:05] look at anybody else cuz what's around
[1:10:07] you may not be eagles. I don't know. But
[1:10:09] I'll say this. If you are, then be glad
[1:10:11] God made you different than them other
[1:10:12] birds.
[1:10:14] Be glad God made you different because
[1:10:16] if he made you different, he did it for
[1:10:17] a purpose. If he made you different, he
[1:10:20] made you that way so that you wouldn't
[1:10:22] have to be bound to this world through
[1:10:23] an ecumenical system and and all these
[1:10:26] other systems. And listen, church,
[1:10:28] everything we we see around us is
[1:10:30] prophecy being fulfilled. I'm not tied
[1:10:32] to the prophecy being fulfilled to this
[1:10:34] world. But I'm tied to a prophecy of a
[1:10:36] rapture. And if we're tied to that
[1:10:38] prophecy, you will fly like an eagle out
[1:10:40] of this place one day. It's going to
[1:10:43] take an atmosphere to do that. It's
[1:10:45] going to take a change in atmosphere.
[1:10:47] You're not going to get out of here by
[1:10:49] thinking, "Well, maybe I could maybe I
[1:10:52] could just work my way out of here
[1:10:53] through good works and and giving more
[1:10:55] money to the church." All those things
[1:10:56] are good, but none of those things are
[1:10:58] going to get you out of here in a good
[1:10:59] atmosphere.
[1:11:01] What you need is to really get down on
[1:11:03] your knees and pray because that will
[1:11:05] create an atmosphere where God will look
[1:11:07] and say, "I'm pleased with that person."
[1:11:09] He'll say, "Well done." Come on, church.
[1:11:12] Thou good and faithful servant. He'll
[1:11:14] say, he'll say, "It was good because you
[1:11:16] it was good that you've been in the
[1:11:17] house of the Lord. It was good that you
[1:11:19] worshiped in his temple. It was good
[1:11:20] that you sang praises to his name. It
[1:11:22] was good that you realized you were not
[1:11:25] bound to this world, but there was an
[1:11:27] atmosphere calling you to live higher.
[1:11:30] And so, brother Brandon would say it
[1:11:32] like this. He goes on down. He said
[1:11:34] there was he said this little eagle was
[1:11:35] walking around for the hen for a long
[1:11:37] time. But he said it was kind of
[1:11:39] strange. He didn't understand what the
[1:11:40] hen meant when she scratched. He he he
[1:11:43] didn't understand why she eat bugs and
[1:11:45] so forth. That that an eagle doesn't
[1:11:46] eat. It seems strange all to him.
[1:11:48] Listen, he was born in a chicken pin. He
[1:11:51] was born in a denomination, but it was
[1:11:53] strange to him because he was looking
[1:11:55] for something. Somebody can identify
[1:11:57] with this here today. Amen. they were in
[1:11:59] something that they were born they may
[1:12:01] they may have been saved in it but they
[1:12:03] realized they needed to be born again by
[1:12:05] something different because this wasn't
[1:12:07] going to work. This wasn't going to cut
[1:12:09] it. Some people are satisfied with just
[1:12:11] being saved in a denominational church
[1:12:13] and they're hoping to make it through
[1:12:14] the tribulation and make it to heaven,
[1:12:16] but I'm not okay with just being saved.
[1:12:19] I want to be in a rapture and have the
[1:12:21] Holy Ghost and the new birth to get me
[1:12:23] out of here. That's what I'm looking
[1:12:25] for. Brother Brandham said it seems
[1:12:27] strange. He said he was an ugly
[1:12:28] duckling. He was not saying he said I'm
[1:12:30] not saying this sacrilegious. He said
[1:12:31] maybe he was a free will Baptist. And he
[1:12:33] said something on that order, a
[1:12:34] Presbyterian. He said, "But you know one
[1:12:36] day his mother knew she had laid an
[1:12:38] egg." The eagle mother knew she had laid
[1:12:40] an egg. And he said there had to be a
[1:12:42] child somewhere. This goes right back to
[1:12:45] that seed that was planted before the
[1:12:47] foundation of the world. God knew there
[1:12:49] was one somewhere that had to come forth
[1:12:51] in the atmosphere of light. And so,
[1:12:54] Brother Brandon would go on like this.
[1:12:56] She said there was a child somewhere. So
[1:12:58] she throwed her big wings into the winds
[1:12:59] and she searched and she and she
[1:13:01] searched screaming to the top of her
[1:13:03] voice. And one day she passed over the
[1:13:05] barnyard.
[1:13:06] Are you still with me? And this little
[1:13:09] eagle heard the voice because she was
[1:13:11] screaming at the top of her voice. And
[1:13:13] one day when she passed over and this
[1:13:15] little eagle heard the familiar scream,
[1:13:17] he may have never heard that voice
[1:13:18] before, but he heard it all of a sudden
[1:13:20] and it was different. And he said he
[1:13:23] under he he recognized the scream. He
[1:13:25] had never heard it before, but he
[1:13:27] realized that it fit him like a glove
[1:13:28] over a hand. And he knew that was his
[1:13:30] mother. He she knew that was her son.
[1:13:33] And she was looking for him. So God in
[1:13:36] every age ordained his church for that
[1:13:38] age, a message for that age. And they
[1:13:40] could have laws and everything that they
[1:13:41] want to. But when that hour comes, the
[1:13:43] Holy Spirit of God, which was at the
[1:13:45] beginning and throughout all and spoke
[1:13:47] it out for that age, that spirit hunts
[1:13:49] that egg. And when he hears that
[1:13:51] message, there is no church denomination
[1:13:53] going to hold to it. It'll rise to the
[1:13:55] heights it's got to go to. It's a
[1:13:58] different bird. It's a different
[1:13:59] creature. He's an eagle. And he'll hear
[1:14:01] the scream. So when there was a seed
[1:14:03] there in the darkness, when there was an
[1:14:05] egg lay in a barnyard, there was
[1:14:07] something moving all the time to bring
[1:14:10] light for you and to say, "Lord, let's
[1:14:12] say, Brother Bill, you may have been
[1:14:14] born in a barnyard, in a chicken yard,
[1:14:15] in a chicken pin, but God has called you
[1:14:18] to be an eagle. God has called you to
[1:14:20] fly above all these denominational
[1:14:22] things. God saw that egg and said, "You
[1:14:24] know what? That's my son. That's my
[1:14:27] daughter. These are my children." And
[1:14:29] you have looked back and said, "I
[1:14:31] recognize the voice." And there was an
[1:14:33] atmosphere. Come on, church. The
[1:14:35] atmosphere changed from the clucking of
[1:14:37] the hens, amen, to a heavenly scream of
[1:14:39] an eagle. There was an atmosphere
[1:14:41] changed when you heard the voice of God.
[1:14:44] I hope that's okay tonight. Listen
[1:14:46] church, I'm not talking about a physical
[1:14:48] voice, but it was something on the
[1:14:49] inside that called out from, come on,
[1:14:51] church. It was something in the
[1:14:53] heavenlies that called you. It was
[1:14:54] something that called you different.
[1:14:56] Amen. And looked at brother Logan and
[1:14:57] said, "You weren't meant to be a
[1:14:58] denominational bird, but you were an
[1:15:00] eagle and you were called to fly
[1:15:02] higher." I hope somebody's hearing me
[1:15:04] tonight. Just because the world tries to
[1:15:06] bind you down to something or just
[1:15:08] because some message church tries to
[1:15:09] make you something or say, "Well, you
[1:15:11] can't scream, you can't shout." Listen,
[1:15:12] when the atmospheres change, nobody can
[1:15:15] hold me back from recognizing that the
[1:15:17] atmospheres are changing and I've heard
[1:15:19] a voice and and I went from an
[1:15:20] earthbound condition and now I'm flying
[1:15:22] in heavenly places. Can you say amen?
[1:15:25] Listen, church, what it is is too often
[1:15:28] we're looking at the circumstances
[1:15:29] around us and questioning whether we're
[1:15:31] eagles or not.
[1:15:34] You've looked around said, "Am I really
[1:15:35] bride? Am I really seed? Am I really?"
[1:15:38] Come on. Yes, you are. because you heard
[1:15:41] the voice and you recognized there was
[1:15:42] there was a there was a sign and and
[1:15:44] there was a voice and and then there was
[1:15:46] a message that followed it and you
[1:15:48] couldn't deny that message because when
[1:15:50] it caught that seed, you said amen to
[1:15:52] it. There was a rejoicing in your heart.
[1:15:54] There was a joy that rose up on the
[1:15:56] inside of you. It made you walk
[1:15:58] different, act different, talk
[1:15:59] different. Listen, church, it'll make
[1:16:01] you act like an eagle. And an eagle,
[1:16:04] listen, brother Random would talk about
[1:16:05] the eagle and the chipmunk. How many
[1:16:07] remembers that story?
[1:16:08] Little chipmunk would be up there in the
[1:16:10] northern woods and he was sitting there
[1:16:12] on that log and he was chatter chatter
[1:16:13] chatter. Brother Brandon would interpret
[1:16:15] those chatters by saying the chipmunk
[1:16:17] was saying days of miracles has passed.
[1:16:19] No more rejoicing. Are you okay with
[1:16:21] that? The little chipmunk was just
[1:16:23] having a little revival, but it was a
[1:16:24] revival. It was an anti-emotional
[1:16:25] revival.
[1:16:29] There was an eagle there that had more
[1:16:31] power in one wing than that chipmunk had
[1:16:32] and all the lungs. And brother Brandham
[1:16:34] said all that eagle would have had to do
[1:16:35] to shut that thing up was to just take
[1:16:37] one big swoop and come down there and
[1:16:39] hit that thing. And he said it would
[1:16:40] have happened the same. He said for him
[1:16:42] too. He said I'm standing there with a
[1:16:43] gun. He said I could have he said that
[1:16:44] eagle knew I could have reached over and
[1:16:46] got that gun. He said but by the time I
[1:16:48] reached over there that eagle would have
[1:16:49] been already gone in the heavenlies.
[1:16:50] Listen I I want to know when God has
[1:16:52] called you. You may be hearing some
[1:16:54] chatter of a chipmunk. You might be
[1:16:56] hearing some things other earthbound
[1:16:57] things. There might be a gun trained on
[1:16:59] you. Come on somebody. But God has given
[1:17:01] you the power to overcome this world and
[1:17:04] create an atmosphere. Listen, you're so
[1:17:06] powerful on the inside of you that you
[1:17:08] create, you could create another world
[1:17:09] and go live on it. The atmospheres have
[1:17:12] changed. We're no longer earthbound.
[1:17:15] We're not working up this revival. The
[1:17:17] revival was the seed on the inside
[1:17:19] coming to life. Yes, sir. It was a word
[1:17:22] seed that recognized the voice. I I want
[1:17:25] to I want to present this to you that
[1:17:27] the voice was already on the inside of
[1:17:28] you before you ever heard the voice.
[1:17:32] Yeah. Because how can you recognize
[1:17:34] something on the inside of you if you
[1:17:36] never heard it before? The little eagle
[1:17:38] was born an eagle and had recognized the
[1:17:41] voice of the mother eagle even though
[1:17:43] the eagle had never heard the voice of
[1:17:45] the eagle. But it sounded familiar to
[1:17:47] the eaglet. Why? because there was
[1:17:50] something on the inside that would that
[1:17:52] would that would know when it heard the
[1:17:54] voice that it would be something
[1:17:55] familiar to it. Before you was ever
[1:17:58] called bride, you might have been called
[1:18:00] church. But a prophet saw you and didn't
[1:18:02] call you church. He said, "I now call
[1:18:04] you bride." Why? Because he saw that you
[1:18:07] were an eagle even in your condition.
[1:18:09] Even when you were a Pentecostal baby,
[1:18:11] even when you were a in in a bad church
[1:18:13] or I don't mean a bad church, but in a
[1:18:15] church that don't believe in the signs
[1:18:17] and wonders. And a church that don't
[1:18:18] believe in the moving of God. Come on,
[1:18:20] church. We got some in the message, too.
[1:18:22] Amen. They try to quench the spirit by
[1:18:23] saying, "We don't want to get too
[1:18:24] emotional." Listen, what they need is to
[1:18:26] get on fire for God and quit preaching
[1:18:29] against the rest of the churches getting
[1:18:30] emotional and they'll find themselves in
[1:18:32] revival themselves. What we've got is
[1:18:34] some people sitting in the seat of the
[1:18:35] scornful and they're pointing at all the
[1:18:37] other churches saying, "Such fanaticism.
[1:18:39] Such fanaticism. Days of miracles has
[1:18:41] passed. No more prayer lines." I want to
[1:18:43] tell you tonight, God is not through
[1:18:45] with prayer lines. He's still healing
[1:18:47] people in this church in prayer lines.
[1:18:48] He's still saving souls in prayer lines.
[1:18:50] He's still revealing himself to young
[1:18:52] people in prayer lines. God is not
[1:18:54] through using them. When when we're out
[1:18:56] of this earth, there'll be no more
[1:18:57] prayer lines. But while we're here, God
[1:18:59] is going to use everything that he has
[1:19:01] put in the church. I want you to know
[1:19:04] you you you turn into a dead church real
[1:19:05] fast. If you start saying, "I don't want
[1:19:07] to be Pentecostal like them." If the
[1:19:08] Pentecostal experience was ever given to
[1:19:11] one person, you've got to have it, too.
[1:19:13] That's right. Come on. Not what they
[1:19:15] call Pentecost, but a true book of Acts
[1:19:17] Pentecostal experience. When did we get
[1:19:19] away from that?
[1:19:21] We can't get away from it if we want to
[1:19:22] change atmospheres. I I say the Holy
[1:19:25] Ghost is needed in order to live in an
[1:19:27] atmosphere where you don't have to live
[1:19:30] in this world anymore. Amen. You are in
[1:19:32] this world, but you are not of this
[1:19:33] world because of an atmosphere change by
[1:19:36] the Holy Ghost. Can you say amen? I want
[1:19:40] to just take this next couple minutes
[1:19:41] here and go over this. Brother Brandham
[1:19:44] said, "Did you ever go in a church?"
[1:19:45] He's talking about people taking one
[1:19:46] another's spirits. And he goes on
[1:19:47] through this and about the eagle. And he
[1:19:49] goes on down in the same sermon. He
[1:19:51] says, "Did you ever go to a church in a
[1:19:53] church where the pastor is a real
[1:19:54] starchy?"
[1:19:57] He said, "The congregation is the same
[1:19:58] way."
[1:20:00] He said, "See, what is it? It's that
[1:20:02] atmosphere that brought it." You say,
[1:20:05] "That's a dead church. You better check
[1:20:07] the person in the pulpit.
[1:20:10] He said, "That's Listen, that's why your
[1:20:12] pastor stands here and preaches
[1:20:13] passionately, service in and service
[1:20:15] out. He's not here to preach a dead
[1:20:17] religion. He's not here. Listen, he's
[1:20:19] preaching a living living God in a live
[1:20:21] message to you." And that ought to make
[1:20:24] somebody shout. It ought to make
[1:20:25] somebody feel a little something in the
[1:20:27] service. It's not about feelings, but if
[1:20:30] you got something, you'll feel
[1:20:31] something.
[1:20:33] Your pastor's not standing here. Your
[1:20:35] pastor's not standing here saying, "You
[1:20:37] need to be quiet. you needed to be, you
[1:20:38] know, listen, we're in order. You get
[1:20:40] out of order, we'll tell you about it,
[1:20:42] but you ain't there yet. And
[1:20:46] brother Br. So, what is it? The
[1:20:47] congregation the same way that it's the
[1:20:48] atmosphere that brought it. Going to a
[1:20:50] place where the pastor says, "Now, wait
[1:20:51] a minute. There's no such thing as the
[1:20:52] as that nonsense. I don't believe in
[1:20:54] that such a thing as divine healing
[1:20:55] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You
[1:20:56] know, you'll see every one of them, the
[1:20:58] congregation.
[1:21:00] The congregation will sure take a spirit
[1:21:02] of something, but we don't want you to
[1:21:03] take the spirit of me or brother Ben or
[1:21:05] Brother Stewart. We want you to take the
[1:21:06] spirit of him. And if you take that
[1:21:08] spirit, listen, it's going to change the
[1:21:10] atmosphere in your life. It's going to
[1:21:12] change what you are. And and I want to
[1:21:14] say this here. He said, "Sure will." He
[1:21:16] says, "Now," he said, "If there's an
[1:21:18] eagle in there somewhere, he'll get out
[1:21:20] amongst that bunch of chickens." Come
[1:21:22] on.
[1:21:24] Somebody say, "I I don't have a choice."
[1:21:25] Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:21:26] If you're live, if you're going to
[1:21:27] church in a place that preaches against
[1:21:28] the move of God, I say, "If you're an
[1:21:30] eagle, you'll get out of that nonsense."
[1:21:33] I didn't say it. A prophet said it. You
[1:21:35] say, "Well, listen." Well, is that is
[1:21:37] that too hard? Is that okay? Can I say
[1:21:40] what a prophet said? A prophet said if
[1:21:42] there's an eagle in there somewhere,
[1:21:43] he'll get out amongst that bunch of
[1:21:45] chickens. If they're preaching the days
[1:21:46] of miracles is passing, no more laying
[1:21:48] on the hands, no more prayer lines, no
[1:21:50] more shouting, no more speaking of
[1:21:51] tongues. Get out of that dead formal
[1:21:53] condition. God has called you to live
[1:21:56] higher than that.
[1:21:59] I hope that's okay tonight. I'm not
[1:22:00] trying to get anybody. I'm not trying to
[1:22:02] yell at you, but but but it's the truth.
[1:22:04] Anyway, can you say amen? He said, "Sure
[1:22:07] will." Exactly the truth. He'll leave
[1:22:09] it. He sure will. He can't stand that.
[1:22:12] He's an eagle. He's a skybuilt bird, not
[1:22:15] a barnyard.
[1:22:16] He said, "Now, we find out that those
[1:22:19] atmospheres, you get in wherever those
[1:22:21] things where where faith is taught in a
[1:22:22] church, you'll find a church in that
[1:22:24] atmosphere." He said, "Oh, God, let me
[1:22:25] get this to you so you can see it." He
[1:22:27] said, "There's a reason people come
[1:22:29] among the saints where they're praying
[1:22:30] and believers." Paul said he didn't find
[1:22:32] any in the city, only Timothy. That was
[1:22:34] like this precious faith that he had. He
[1:22:35] said, you know, the rest of them are all
[1:22:37] denominationalists. See, but when he got
[1:22:39] into that atmosphere, see, you you find
[1:22:42] things going on. That atmosphere has
[1:22:44] been created and you find people living
[1:22:46] by faith. When you get into a place
[1:22:48] where it says, "My, the Bible is true.
[1:22:50] God heals." You walk around their
[1:22:52] congregation, you find why? I was dying
[1:22:54] with cancer. I was healed. I was blind,
[1:22:56] but now I see. What is it? It was an
[1:22:58] atmosphere where God could move in that
[1:23:01] church.
[1:23:04] That's what a prophet said. When you've
[1:23:05] got an atmosphere like that, people are
[1:23:06] going to be healed. The sick are going
[1:23:07] to come on church. The sick will be
[1:23:09] healed. The dead will be raised there.
[1:23:10] There there'll be people coming back to
[1:23:12] the Lord. If we'll create the
[1:23:14] atmosphere, God will help us do the rest
[1:23:16] of the work because God just wants us to
[1:23:18] be a willing and able vessel to create
[1:23:21] an atmosphere. Can you say amen? I want
[1:23:24] to get down here to closing and brother
[1:23:26] Brandon would say it like this. He said,
[1:23:28] 'D did you ever go out while you're
[1:23:29] praying? Did you ever go out in the
[1:23:31] morning after a dark dismal night, look
[1:23:32] out, hanging on the closed wire, looking
[1:23:34] on the grass blade, look hanging on the
[1:23:36] leaf, it's a little dew drop. I love how
[1:23:39] Brother Brandham does this. I hope this
[1:23:40] is okay. This will be my last quote here
[1:23:42] and I'll close. He said, "Oh, they're so
[1:23:44] miserable looking, quivering as the
[1:23:46] cold, chilly winds are shaking them, but
[1:23:48] just let the sun start to rise."
[1:23:52] He said, "Watch how they shine. They're
[1:23:54] glistening." He said, "Why? You know,
[1:23:56] they were once up in the sky and the
[1:23:57] going away of the sun brought them down,
[1:23:59] but they've been up. Listen, they they
[1:24:01] come down into the darkness of night.
[1:24:03] Amen. But they knew what they were at
[1:24:04] one time. He said, they're quivering.
[1:24:06] They were miserable. He said, he said,
[1:24:07] they've been up and they've had an
[1:24:09] experience and they're a witness that
[1:24:10] there's an atmosphere to live in above
[1:24:11] this earth. And as soon as the sun is
[1:24:13] that one that draws the dew back up into
[1:24:15] the skies again, they've they've been
[1:24:17] they've once been up and now they're
[1:24:18] down. And they see the sun rising. So,
[1:24:22] they know they're going up again. So
[1:24:24] they're happy and reflecting the light
[1:24:26] of the sun. Little dew drops. Oh yeah.
[1:24:29] You're just like a little dew drop. You
[1:24:31] were already there. You've tasted the
[1:24:33] heavenlies, but the darkness brought you
[1:24:35] down. But the message brought the
[1:24:37] sunlight again and has raised you back
[1:24:39] into a place where you can worship. I
[1:24:42] know there's been dark ages. But little
[1:24:43] New Drop, it's your time to go back to
[1:24:46] the heavens where you came from. You
[1:24:48] were just down there in earthbound
[1:24:50] condition because the darkness was
[1:24:51] there. But once you saw the light, you
[1:24:53] knew you started. The brother Ram said
[1:24:55] they were quivering and shaking and it
[1:24:56] went right back to where it knew it had
[1:24:58] been before. Before you ever had an
[1:25:01] experience with God, you'd already know.
[1:25:03] You already knew what it was like to be
[1:25:04] in his presence because you came from
[1:25:06] God.
[1:25:08] Oh, thank you, Lord. I want you to think
[1:25:09] about that for a moment.
[1:25:11] You were in the thoughts of God and he'd
[1:25:14] already called you. The seed was planted
[1:25:16] there in your worst condition. Oh, yeah.
[1:25:19] And in your worst condition,
[1:25:22] God saw fit to shed his light on you.
[1:25:26] And you might have started quivering and
[1:25:27] shaking at an altar. And maybe you
[1:25:29] started acting a little funny to the
[1:25:30] people, but you knew you had felt that
[1:25:33] before because you came from God. And
[1:25:35] now you were going back to God. Don't
[1:25:37] call us crazy for acting a little crazy
[1:25:39] in church. We knew that feeling came
[1:25:41] from somewhere. It wasn't just an
[1:25:43] emotional workup, but it was from we're
[1:25:45] from God. We are God's beings. And we
[1:25:47] went back to God by the message of the
[1:25:49] hour. We were presented to him again and
[1:25:51] now we know who we are because God's
[1:25:54] voice has come in this hour and called
[1:25:56] you bride. You're not a chicken. You are
[1:26:00] an eagle. It's eagle time. It's time to
[1:26:03] rise up high. It's time to set your
[1:26:04] wings to the winds of faith. It's time
[1:26:07] to fly out of this place. Come on,
[1:26:09] church. We know who we are by the voice
[1:26:11] that we've heard and we've recognized
[1:26:13] the voice. We've recognized our day and
[1:26:16] its message and we are called to live
[1:26:19] higher. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:26:21] Musicians, go ahead and come as I finish
[1:26:23] this quote. Amen. He said, "They are
[1:26:25] they are a witness. These dew drops are
[1:26:26] a witness that there's an atmosphere to
[1:26:28] live in above this earth." Amen. I love
[1:26:30] this. He said, "My blessed little child
[1:26:32] as your father in the ministry, though
[1:26:34] you may be older, but you're still my
[1:26:36] child. I have preached to you the gospel
[1:26:38] and you're dropped down. You were made
[1:26:40] to be a son and daughter of God. And
[1:26:42] maybe you've wandered away, but the son
[1:26:44] of righteousness is here with healing in
[1:26:46] his wings. And don't you want to reflect
[1:26:48] his life, knowing that you can be lifted
[1:26:51] up and lifted to your rightly position
[1:26:53] to be God's daughter or God's son? He
[1:26:57] said you do. I think he spoke that with
[1:26:59] faith to the people there. And I want to
[1:27:01] speak to the fa to the people here
[1:27:02] tonight and say, I know that you want to
[1:27:05] be an eagle. I know you want to feel the
[1:27:07] presence of God in your life. I know you
[1:27:09] want to be different. But you know what
[1:27:10] it is? We get so fa fettered and and
[1:27:13] tied to this world that we don't
[1:27:15] recognize that God's presence is so near
[1:27:19] that all we have to do is reach out and
[1:27:21] say, "Lord, I I I'm I've I've fallen
[1:27:24] back into this chicken pin again." But
[1:27:26] you know, I'm an eagle. And he knows
[1:27:28] you're an eagle. And all he'll do is
[1:27:30] he'll call out to you and say, "Son or
[1:27:33] daughter, come up a little higher and
[1:27:35] come back into my presence again." And
[1:27:37] I'll say once you've been in the
[1:27:38] presence of God, you can never be the
[1:27:41] same. One time in his presence and you
[1:27:44] can't ever be the same. Just like the
[1:27:46] dew drops, they had been there before
[1:27:49] and even though the darkness brought
[1:27:51] them down, they knew the feeling of the
[1:27:54] sunlight coming through. They felt it.
[1:27:57] You say, "Amen." You ever been down
[1:28:00] because the darkness has overtaken you?
[1:28:03] Don't worry, child. Sunlight's coming.
[1:28:06] I would like to go ahead and say,
[1:28:06] "Sunlight has come. The light of the sun
[1:28:10] is here. The message of the hour has
[1:28:12] lightened your path for you so that you
[1:28:14] don't have to live in this darkness any
[1:28:15] longer. But you've been called to live
[1:28:18] higher." Can the church say, "Amen."
[1:28:22] Let's sing this song. I wonder if we can
[1:28:24] stand together tonight. If you have a
[1:28:26] need on your heart, we'll be happy to
[1:28:27] lay hands on you or or you can pray
[1:28:29] right right there where you are. But if
[1:28:31] you found yourself in darkness, I know
[1:28:34] there's something on the inside of you
[1:28:35] that wants to live higher. I know
[1:28:37] there's something on the inside of the
[1:28:38] people. You wouldn't be here on a Sunday
[1:28:39] afternoon if there wasn't something on
[1:28:41] the inside of you that was calling you
[1:28:43] to live higher. I want you to just put a
[1:28:46] hand up to him and say, "Lord, don't
[1:28:48] pass me by this afternoon. I want the
[1:28:51] atmosphere created around me to be an
[1:28:52] atmosphere of worship. I want the
[1:28:54] atmosphere in my home to be an
[1:28:55] atmosphere of love and kindness and
[1:28:58] gentleness and meekness. I want the
[1:28:59] atmosphere in this church to be one of
[1:29:01] praise and power and glory. I want I
[1:29:04] want more of you and less of the world
[1:29:06] and less of me. Oh, just sing it now.
[1:29:11] He's to supply. Oh, reach out
[1:29:18] and touch the Lord
[1:29:21] as he
[1:29:24] goes by.
[1:29:26] Oh, reach up. Can you do it like that?
[1:29:28] and touch the Lord.
[1:29:31] Oh, as he
[1:29:34] goes by, oh, you'll find
[1:29:39] he's not too busy.
[1:29:42] Oh, to hear your heart's cry. Oh, he's
[1:29:50] supply this moment. Oh, yes. Your needs
[1:29:55] to
[1:29:56] supply.
[1:29:58] Oh, reach up
[1:30:01] and touch the Lord
[1:30:04] as he
[1:30:06] Oh, with all your hearts now, won't you
[1:30:09] reach out and touch the Lord? You
[1:30:13] believe he's here this afternoon as he
[1:30:17] goes by.
[1:30:19] Oh, you find
[1:30:22] he's not too busy. Oh, to hear your
[1:30:28] heart's cry. Oh yes, he's passing
[1:30:32] passing by this moment.
[1:30:36] Your reach to
[1:30:39] supply.
[1:30:40] Oh, reach out and touch the Lord
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:50] by.
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:53] Oh, pass
[1:30:56] me not. Oh, gentle
[1:31:00] save. I wonder if we could just worship
[1:31:03] him for a moment now. Oh, won't you
[1:31:07] hear?
[1:31:09] Hear my humble
[1:31:14] cry.
[1:31:15] [Music]
[1:31:19] Oh,
[1:31:20] w
[1:31:26] you believe he's here. If you have a
[1:31:28] need on your heart this afternoon, make
[1:31:30] a move for God and say, "Lord, create in
[1:31:32] me an atmosphere." I believe this
[1:31:34] service is just for you today. Don't let
[1:31:36] it pass you by now. Lord, do not pass me
[1:31:41] by. Call to him now. Call to the Savior.
[1:31:45] Oh, I'm calling on you, Savior.
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:31:53] Oh, my Savior.
[1:32:00] Oh, here my
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:08] cry.
[1:32:13] Oh, and while
[1:32:17] all others
[1:32:20] thou
[1:32:22] are calling
[1:32:27] oh to
[1:32:31] not pass.
[1:32:34] Let's play that softly. I want us to bow
[1:32:36] our heads for just a moment. Just feel
[1:32:38] led to do this and I hope this is okay.
[1:32:40] Every eye closed, every head bowed.
[1:32:43] I know sometimes it's hard because if
[1:32:45] you if you respond to a message like
[1:32:48] that, people think that you you're
[1:32:50] living in a bad atmosphere. Listen,
[1:32:53] we're not judging here what you're
[1:32:54] living in. We're not judging that you've
[1:32:56] been bad or you've you've failed God.
[1:32:58] We've all failed God. We've all created
[1:33:00] a bad atmosphere at times.
[1:33:03] But what we do when we do that is we
[1:33:05] don't stay there. We don't stay in the
[1:33:07] darkness, but we let the light bring us
[1:33:09] back into fellowship with God. Can you
[1:33:11] say amen? If there's a need on your
[1:33:13] heart this afternoon, I just feel led to
[1:33:14] do this one time. If you have a need, I
[1:33:17] the altar's open. I I don't necessarily
[1:33:19] have to pray with you, but but maybe you
[1:33:21] just want to pray yourself. If your
[1:33:23] atmosphere is wrong in the home, I
[1:33:26] challenge you today to change it after
[1:33:27] this service and say, "Lord, I'm not
[1:33:30] going to leave here the same person. I'm
[1:33:32] not going to leave here and let the
[1:33:33] atmospheres of this world hinder my walk
[1:33:35] with God in my home, in my workplace, in
[1:33:38] the church, but I'm going to make a step
[1:33:40] of faith this afternoon. And I'm calling
[1:33:42] on you now, Lord. Don't pass me by, but
[1:33:45] change change my heart and make me love
[1:33:47] you again. Renew my spirit now and
[1:33:50] create in me an atmosphere that you'd be
[1:33:52] pleased with. If there's a need on your
[1:33:54] heart today, the altar's open. And if
[1:33:56] you don't want to come forward, maybe
[1:33:58] slip a hand to him and say, "Lord,
[1:33:59] change the atmosphere in my home. Change
[1:34:01] the atmosphere in my life. Change the
[1:34:04] atmosphere on my job and let it start
[1:34:06] with me. Let me change the atmosphere as
[1:34:08] the creator that I am. Move upon me and
[1:34:12] let me be the light that moves the
[1:34:13] darkness away. Let me be the light to
[1:34:16] somebody." We're going to sing that
[1:34:17] again. If you have anything you need
[1:34:19] tonight, amen. We'll take the time for
[1:34:20] you. God bless you. Do not pass
[1:34:25] me
[1:34:27] my
[1:34:29] crying savior.
[1:34:32] Oh, we're crying
[1:34:34] Savior.
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:39] Oh my precious Savior.
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:47] Oh,
[1:34:50] hear my heart
[1:34:54] cry.
[1:34:59] Oh yes and wow.
[1:35:04] All others
[1:35:06] thou are calling.
[1:35:14] Oh to
[1:35:17] not pass.
[1:35:21] Oh sing it again. Pass me not. Oh it'll
[1:35:23] say again.
[1:35:25] Oh
[1:35:27] yes pass
[1:35:35] to Savior.
[1:35:38] [Music]
[1:35:42] Hear
[1:35:45] my humble
[1:35:49] cry.
[1:35:56] While
[1:35:59] on others,
[1:36:01] thou art calling.
[1:36:06] [Music]
[1:36:10] You
[1:36:12] not pass
[1:36:15] me
[1:36:17] by.
[1:36:22] We're trying.
[1:36:29] Oh, Savior.
[1:36:32] [Music]
[1:36:37] Lord, hear
[1:36:39] my
[1:36:41] humble
[1:36:44] cry.
[1:36:51] And while
[1:36:54] all others
[1:36:56] thou
[1:36:57] art calling,
