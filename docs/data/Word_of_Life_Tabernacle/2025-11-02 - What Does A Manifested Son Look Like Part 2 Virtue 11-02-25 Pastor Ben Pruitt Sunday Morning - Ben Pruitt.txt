Want to mention to you while you're turning there this morning that tonight's service will be focused to the youth, but you're all welcome to come. We want you to come, but it'll be focused on that. Brother Joel will be preaching tonight. Uh, brother uh Joe Adams is going to be here next week. It's been several years since he's been here. So, I know you're looking forward to hearing brother Joe again, and he'll be here with us. And I I won't be here. I'll be in Arizona. Um going out there to a meeting at brother Israel Pose and and then going to be preaching a couple times out there. So you keep me and Britney in your prayers. The kids are going to stay here and this is what we're going to attempt to do is to go and be gone for about a week or a little longer and leave the children here. And so u we we'll try to do that not have to take an early flight back. We're not used to being separated from our children. So but we're getting older, you know, and and they can take care of themselves now. So you'll be praying for my wife especially that we'll be able to do that and also we have to get on an airplane so you all know about that and uh so be praying for us but I know you'll enjoy brother Joe coming in and that'll be a real blessing to the church and uh so we'll we'll be uh doing that. Romans chapter 8 and verse 18. Do you love the Lord this morning? For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. So we can say it like this. the the the earth is waiting, holding its breath, waiting for the sons of God to be manifested. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated this morning as we've uh been dealing at some length with adoption and manifestation of sons. And we're going to continue on that manifestation of sons this morning. We know when Jesus was born in flesh that he was the perfect manifested son of God that being born here in the earth that uh if we wanted to know what a manifested son looked like then we need to look at Christ and we need to be like Christ and that is what we're talking about. It just kind of makes it a little bit simpler if you think about it that way. We're just talking about being like Jesus. We're supposed to use him as our example and not just as our example but also to let his spirit come in us so that we can become like him, walk like him, talk like him, be like him. And we know when Jesus was born that he was God in flesh. How many know that today? &gt;&gt; When Jesus was born, he was Jehovah in a manger. Brother Brandham said it was little Jehovah crying over in a manger. It was little Jehovah uh the nursing at his mother's breast. It was little Jehovah that that was the one who was there and he was actually a baby and and yet he was God. He was all the God he would ever be at that moment. He he was God's DNA. And even Brandham said the blood cell and the egg were both created in the womb of Mary. He was the very creation of God and and he was born into the world. And yet when he come into the world, he did not come into the world speaking thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? We just don't expect that, do we? And that sounds kind of ludicrous, but but he wasn't born a full-g grown man. &gt;&gt; And so he was the word, but he couldn't speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. He was the word, but he couldn't he couldn't uh he couldn't heal the people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; His little hands wrapped around his mother's finger. Right. a and and grabbed a hold of his mother's finger, but his touch did not heal the people. There's no record of it as a even as a a child or a young man. And yet he was God. Are you with me so far? The same is true of us when we're born again into the kingdom of God. We are as much we have all the potentials of the resurrection. We have everything in us that will ever be. We we whatever God is going to do for you, he's already put in you when you're born again. Right? that seed. In fact, before your new birth, before you even come to an understanding of it, a knowledge of it, YOU ALREADY CHOSEN BY GOD, ELECTED by God to be what YOU'RE GOING TO BE. HOW MANY CAN TAKE COMFORT IN that today? A and God doesn't miss. He doesn't make a mistake. HE DOESN'T HE DOESN'T MESS UP HIS PROGRAM. WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING TO BE IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; But yet, when you come into the world or you come into THE CHURCH, YOU DON'T START speaking all at once. And and so many people get discouraged cuz they're like, "Well, I'm not like brother so AND SO. I'M NOT LIKE SISTER SO AND SO." WE DON'T EXPECT YOU TO BE. YOU COME IN AS A BABY. You're born as a baby. LET THE YOUNG PEOPLE BE YOUNG PEOPLE. LET THOSE WHO COME IN OFF THE STREET COME IN AND HAVE A REAL EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. LET THEM BE BABIES, BUT you know, BABIES HAVE TO GROW UP. SO, LET US AS ELDERS, LET US GROW UP INTO THE FULL MANIFESTATION OF THE WORD of God. &gt;&gt; Huh? Uh, excuse me this morning. Sometimes we pick a fight or or or get upset at younger people for having wrong ideas or we we get upset at new people for living in ways maybe that we wouldn't live. But let's let's us AS ELDERS, LET'S LET'S be the example of that. Let's do LET'S BE MORE THAN JUST SOMEBODY WHO CAN SEE SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULTS, BUT LET'S BE SOMEBODY WHO'S GROWN UP INTO A MATURE CHRISTIAN that can preach the word of God. You say, "Well, I'm not a preacher." Will you preach with your life? &gt;&gt; PREACH WITH YOUR LIFE. PREACH WITH THE WAY YOU LIVE EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what I want to do. Jesus was born God in flesh. He was that part of God called the son of God. Fully a son of God. Emmanuel, God with us. Even at 12 years old, he was the word correcting the error in the temple. &gt;&gt; We know he had to be tempted and he had to be tested and he had to learn. And that's hard for us to understand because obviously God knows all things and Jesus had access to that knowledge. But he had to learn how to surrender himself &gt;&gt; to the father that lived within him. &gt;&gt; How how do we know that? BECAUSE HE SAID, "NOT MY WILL, but thine be done." HE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO DEPEND ON THE WORD. HOW DID JESUS GO INTO A GRAVE and believe that he would come up again? Because he believed the scripture that SAID, "I WILL NOT SUFFER MY HOLY ONE TO SEE CORRUPTION. OH, NOT LEAVE YOUR SOUL IN HELL. SO IF HE believed that, he had to learn to believe that. CAN I SAY IT THAT WAY? HE HAD TO REACH A PLACE IN HIS LIFE THAT THAT HE COULD HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN THAT. YOU SAY, WELL, he just always knew those things that not according TO THE SCRIPTURE. THE BIBLE SAYS, THOUGH HE WERE a son, come on, sir. &gt;&gt; Again, AS MUCH SON HE WOULD EVER BE FULLY a son, HAVING ALL THE POTENTIALS HE WOULD EVER HAVE, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. He learned to be obedient to the word to the oh God TO TO THE MANIFESTATION OF GOD IN HIM. &gt;&gt; And he Oh, that's why we still NEED TO PRAY. &gt;&gt; WE STILL NEED to surrender ourselves. WE STILL NEED TO REACH OUT. WE STILL NEED TO PRESS. WE STILL NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. YES, WE'RE ELECTED. YES, WE'RE CALLED. YES, WE'RE THE PREDESTINED CHILDREN OF GOD. BUT WE STILL NEED COME ON, CHURCH. WE STILL NEED REVIVAL. WE STILL NEED GOD TO MOVE IN OUR MIDST. WE STILL NEED THE PRESENCE OF GOD TO COME DOWN ON US. WHY? WE ARE SONS. BUT WE LEARN OBEDIENCE IN LIFE. &gt;&gt; HE BECAME THE AUTHOR. HE BECAME THE author &gt;&gt; of [snorts] eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. He did not take a shortcut &gt;&gt; to the throne, &gt;&gt; but he took the way that God called him to be. Many people confuse activity for the leadership of the Lord. We want activity. We want to press. We want to do make sure that there's something in there to give out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before you go. Now look, he he's made perfect and become the author of eternal salvation. Brother Brandham said shortcuts. He said tonight they're out here today. They're going on. Oh my. Tomorrow they want to preach. Pentecostal people letting them do that. I just say upfront. I'm not talking about any preacher this morning. I want us all to to fellowship with this and and understand this. These ministers here have have a lot of experience and and uh and and a lot of of uh I believe they're not noviceses at all. The brothers we have in the church, aren't you glad for that? And brothers we have stand behind the pulpit. So, I'm not pointing this to them at all. But he talked about preachers how the Pentecostals would bring someone off the street, make them a preacher the next day. He said tomorrow today he said go they're going on mine tomorrow they want to preach. He said Pentecostal people letting them do that too. They want a shortcut to heaven. Hallelujah. All they have to do is go down there and just don't think nothing at all and say hallelujah. I I got on Elijah's garment. I'm going out tomorrow to cast out devils. Come on. You you guys see it all over Instagram and all over Facebook and all over social media today. Everybody's a prophet and everybody's casting out devils and everybody's doing all this stuff and they don't have THE LIFE TO MATCH UP WITH THAT. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon believed in shouting. He said he believed in jumping. He said, "BUT DON'T JUMP NO HIGHER than you can live." &gt;&gt; So he said THEY WANT THE SHORTCUT TO HEAVEN. He said taking as much of the world as they can take. You can't take any of it. Is that right, Jonah? You can't take any of the world. Amen. AMEN. THERE'S NO SHORTCUTS. YOU COME THE WAY OF CALVARY. YOU COME THE WAY OF THE BRASS ALTAR. AMEN. You come the way of the brazen serpent. He said you die. You actually die. You die. You literally die to yourselves. How many believe THAT TODAY? YOU DIE TO THE THINGS OF THE WORLD AND ARE BORN A NEW. AMEN. NO WORLD. The things of the world is dead. There's no shortcuts. HE SAID THEY WANT TO COME RIGHT QUICK. THEY DON'T WANT TO GROW. BUT HE said we grow in the Lord. It takes growth and experience. Somebody say that with me this morning. growth and experience. &gt;&gt; People are told out on the West Coast now, he said, "Oh, we got the immortal baptism." Brother Brandham was seeing the beginnings of that, the charismatic movement, &gt;&gt; Pentecostal babies. [snorts] We got a Pentecostal baby here in the church. But brother seen the beginning of that and says, "We baptized you in water. You turned right back to a young man right there, a young woman said they got Elijah's garments. They got manifested sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we believe in manifested sons. &gt;&gt; Right? We believe in sons of God being manifested, but not overnight. &gt;&gt; And here's this is the key. &gt;&gt; NOT OVERNIGHT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. WHEN WILL THE SONS OF GOD BE FULLY MANIFESTED? IN the millennium when we have the character for it. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME SONS THAT CAN COME TO THAT. THEY SAY, "CUZ WE SAW ONE THAT DID THAT. GOD SHOWED US A PROPHET AND COME TO SUCH A MATURITY IN HIS LIFE THAT HE COULD SPEAK AND AND THINGS WOULD HAPPEN. BUT HE SAID, "I DON'T JUST DO THAT ON MY OWN." HE HAD THE MATURITY TO WAIT UNTIL GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; SO, it's the manifestation of sons. BUT IT'S NOT TONIGHT you're a sinner, tomorrow you're manifested sons of God. &gt;&gt; He said nonsense. Where you get that in the word? Babies are not born men. They're born babies and grow to men. &gt;&gt; Right? baby can put on a tie and wear dress clothes and they're still not a man. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And but listen, when it's a baby doing that, there's no shame in that. &gt;&gt; Are you with pal? You say, "Well, they're not, you know, they're just they're just kind of pretending to be a Christian, just coming to church and they're not really doing everything they should be doing." Well, you did two at one time. &gt;&gt; You kind of come and assimilated yourself, too. A and you didn't always have every work of grace in your life and YOU HAD TO STOP START AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID LIKE EVERYBODY else did. BUT THANK GOD IF YOU'VE REACHED THE TOP, if you're up there with brotherly KINDNESS AND LOVE, YOU CAN REACH BACK DOWN TO SOMEBODY A LITTLE LOWER AND SAY, "COME ON UP WITH ME. I'LL HELP YOU WALK. I'LL HELP YOU MOVE UP FARTHER." So the Bible says that after teaching the rabbis in the temple and Jesus did that at 12 years old, HE HAD SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND HE HAD SO MUCH UNDERSTANDING AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD moving him in him. He he was God &gt;&gt; and he was preaching AT 12 YEARS OLD, PREACHING to the to the to the Pharisees and the rabbis in the temple. And then in Luke 2:52, it tells us after the his parents come and got him, he subjected himself to them. &gt;&gt; And after he had already corrected the error in their lives, Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man. Now I want you to understand he was deity walking, &gt;&gt; right? But he increased. &gt;&gt; So how did he increase? He did not add from the outside. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A lot of people misunderstand the stature of a perfect man. It's not adding something from the outside. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; It's growing in what's on the inside. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And so you HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ON the inside. Brother Brandon taught us, we talked about, I think last week or the week before, you got to have that foundation of faith or you can't get started. And so YOU GOT TO BELIEVE GOD FIRST. How many believe God this morning? &gt;&gt; Got to believe that he is. and he's a rewarder of those that diligently se serve him, seek him, and yet you you've got to increase. So Jesus increased. He was deity and and you got to start at the bottom. But he increased in wisdom and stature. So he was increasing into the stature of the perfect man and in favor with God and man. church, you don't understand like like he WAS DOING WHAT GOD WANTED HIM to do. It's not that. See, when you're born again, God loves you. You're in FAVOR WITH GOD. YOU'RE ACCEPTED IN THE BELOVED AS WE TALKED ABOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. YOU YOU LISTEN, you don't have to worry about God loving you. Jesus didn't have to worry about the father loving him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. GOD LOVED HIM. YET, he increased IN FAVOR WITH GOD. AND MAN, WHAT WAS HE DOING GOING THROUGH HIS TIME? BROTHER SEAN TALKED ABOUT WHERE WHERE HE WAS BEING CHILDRAINED AND BROUGHT TO THAT PLACE WHERE THE FATHER COME DOWN AND SAID, "THIS IS MY BELOVED SON. HEAR YE HIM." LISTEN, IF GOD WALKING IN FLESH, THE FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD BODILY, HAD TO BE BROUGHT THROUGH A TRAINING PERIOD, HAD TO COME TO HIS ADOPTION, HOW MUCH MORE OUGHT EVERY CHRISTIAN BE WORKING AND AND DOING EVERYTHING THEY can for that goal. &gt;&gt; But it's not a it's not just something you add. It's not something you just get out of the air or you get out of a book. It's something that happens from that divine nature. It's been birthed on the inside. Brother Brandham said uh and the Bible teaches us that the Holy Ghost in us is deity, right? But it's the earnest of our salvation. It's just the earnest of it. So it's the beginning of it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So the quickening power of your resurrection, he says, when you receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you, the potential of it, &gt;&gt; the potential of it. So when you're born again, you say, "Well, praise God. I'm already resurrected." Yes, you are. Right? The pot in potential form. &gt;&gt; The seed is in you &gt;&gt; to be resurrected. And God never planted a seed that didn't come up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we can take a a great we can rest in that. We don't have to worry. We don't have to to govern our lives in such a way of fear and scare and worry about things because we know he's got us. And yet we have to grow. That seed's got to grow once it's quickened. He said the quickening power of your resurrection when you receive the Holy Spirit is then dwelling in you the potential of it. He said, "Notice, you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection. No tree just comes UP OVERNIGHT. IT'S GOT TO GROW as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BAPTIZED INTO THE HOLY SPIRIT." He said, "Now, AS THE PENTECOSTAL CHURCH BAPTIZED IN THE HOLY SPIRIT, it's begin growing." I want to I want to address something as it comes to my mind. You know, we we feel like, well, the church needs to always be in revival, and it does. We should strive to stay in revival, but individuals within the church are not always going to feel like they're in revival BECAUSE SOMETIMES GOD WANTS YOU TO BE TESTED. SOMETIMES HE'LL ACTUALLY WITHDRAW HIMSELF FROM YOU and wait to see what you'll do. We find when when Abraham, remember when he had Ishmael, the the Bible tells US THERE WAS A SILENT PERIOD of 12 years in between THE TIME ISHMAEL WAS BORN AND GOD SPOKE TO ABRAHAM AGAIN. THERE'S NO RECORD BETWEEN THAT 12 YEARS THAT GOD EVER SPOKE TO ABRAHAM. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS A TESTING TIME. IT WAS A PROVING TIME. GOD WASN'T PUNISHING HIM, BUT HE WANTED HIM TO STILL BELIEVE. THERE'S STILL A PROMISE FOR YOU. EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE MESSED UP, EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE DONE WRONG, GOD WASN'T PUNISHING HIM FOR doing wrong. HE WAS TRYING TO PROVE TO HIM, I'M STILL THE GOD WHO'S GOING TO MEET MAKE THE PROMISE REAL IN YOUR LIFE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO SOMETIMES WHEN WE DON'T FEEL GOD LIKE WE THINK WE SHOULD AND MAYBE THE CHURCH ISN'T AS ON FIRE AND WE JUST DON'T ENJOY CHURCH LIKE WE THINK WE SHOULD. WHAT IF GOD IS USING THAT TO MATURE YOU? &gt;&gt; HUH? What if he's changing you in that? WHAT IF WHAT HE WANTS IS NOT JUST A GOOD SERVICE, BUT WHAT HE WANTS IS A IS A FULLGROWN CHRISTIAN, A MATURE SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. HE WANTS SOMEBODY WHO WILL WORSHIP WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE IT. SOMEBODY WHO WILL PRAY. COME ON CHURCH. SOMEBODY WHO WILL LIFT THEIR HANDS EVEN WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE ISN'T DOING IT. SOMEBODY WHO'LL LIFT THEIR VOICE EVEN WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS SILENT. SOMEBODY WHO'LL PRAISE HIM THROUGH TRIBULATION AND TRIAL AND EVERYTHING GOING ON IN their life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you have been through some things, made some mistakes, made some errors. &gt;&gt; You know you're not tied to that the rest of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. God used it to help you grow. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you just got to let it be and move on. Correct the error and just move on and &gt;&gt; and live for him. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about how it come up. The tree, the bride tree came up. He said limbs has died. It was pruning them off, but the tree is still growing. It's still going on because it's got to come to the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. So when you're being pruned, things are being pruned off your life, don't look at that and say, "God, why are you doing this to me?" But say, "Lord, keep it up." &gt;&gt; I know I can't go like this. I've got to change, mature into something that you want me to be. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said they're led by the spirit to quicken the word to you who is believers. He said the word keeps quickening. He said, "As you come to first limb, second limb, third limb on up." &gt;&gt; So I don't know which limb you're on this morning, but you as an individual, as you come to first limb, second limb, third limb, it keeps quickening, the spirit of God keeps quickening to you. Now, it depends on what kind of tree that you are, what what kind of uh how fast them limbs come out, &gt;&gt; right? And God's GOT A CERTAIN FRUIT that he wants to produce in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right? And maybe you're a a tree that CAN COME UP FAST AND START PRODUCING EARLY, but maybe you're one of those pecan trees that take forever &gt;&gt; to produce. I believe IT'S 25 years to produce a first crop of pecans. Think about that for a minute. A SORERO CACTUS in in the desert puts out its first arm at 75 years old. It's not too late for some of y'all. It's drinking. It's drinking. It's taking in nutrients. IT'S GROWING. IT'S IT'S IT'S JUST constantly swelling up. And but it just looks like this. And you know, those aren't the pretty ones. Nobody takes a PICTURE IN FRONT OF A HALF-GROWN SORRO, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? You find the pretty sorro. YOU FIND THE GREAT CACTUS THAT'S GOT ALL THE BEAUTIFUL ARMS OUT. THAT THING'S LIKE 150 YEARS OLD. IT'S ALMOST READY TO DIE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? IT'S LIVED ITS LIFE. NO WONDER IT'S GOT LIMBS. IT'S ABLE COME ON. SOME OF Y'ALL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ABLE TO RAISE YOUR HANDS. THAT'S WHY YOU GOT LIMBS TO BE ABLE TO PUSH OUT. YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME THINGS. YOU YOU YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THE BATTLE OF LIFE. WE SHOULD NOT DESPISE THOSE THAT ARE GROWING AROUND US. [sighs] &gt;&gt; So the oak tree takes years. You plant an oak tree for the next generation, &gt;&gt; right? You plant an oak tree for something coming. If you're young, you plant it for when you're old &gt;&gt; or you plant it for the next generation, but you plant a pine tree or something like that, it comes up a little bit quicker. But it's also more breakable, &gt;&gt; right? So, if you want something solid, many times it takes time. Now, brother Brandon said, "What does a tree have to do?" &gt;&gt; When you plant it, the only thing you have to do is water it &gt;&gt; and then it's got to drink. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the leaves are in it. The apples are in it. Everything is right in the tree. But it's got to drink. You know where I'm going with this? It's got to drink more than its portion. &gt;&gt; And as it drinks, IT PUSHES OUT, PUSHES OUT LEAVES, PUSHES OUT BLOSSOMS, PUSHES OUT APPLES. &gt;&gt; And after a while, PEOPLE BEGIN TO SEE, WELL, I HADN'T NOTICED THAT tree was producing. We've got pimmen trees near us. I don't know how long a pimmen tree takes to grow, but when we take a walk, sometimes I like to look down at the pim pimmen trees and and see and I I felt like Jesus walking seeing the fig tree this year. There were no pimmons on the pimmen trees. And finally, we got down to one. It had one lonely pimmen on that tree, but we still know how the weather's going to be because of that. You know, [laughter] &gt;&gt; it has not really. I'm kidding. You know, I know that's not always 100% accurate, but you know, the pimantry, it's got a purpose. Just one purpose, give out pimmons. But yet, all the pimmon trees we walk by wasn't doing it. BUT THAT ONE PUT OUT ONE. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW STRANGE IT MUST SEEM. If you're walking by a bunch of trees, never had a pimmen on them. Years later, you're walking by the same one. Here it's full of pimmens. WHAT IS IT? THAT FIRST ONE ACTUALLY looks odd to it. BUT AFTER A WHILE, you get used to seeing it. &gt;&gt; Listen, it would be strange to see some of you backslide. Right? BECAUSE YOU'VE LIVED THE LIFE FOR SO LONG. IT WOULD BE STRANGE TO SEE YOU GO OUT IN the world. I mean, just go out in the world and live like the devil. IT'D BE STRANGE TO SEE THAT. But you get a newborn Christian, it's not so strange to see them FAIL AND FALL. WHY IS THAT? I'm not condoning it. I'M I'M EXPLAINING IT. WHAT IS IT, GOD? THEY HAVEN'T REACHED THIS PLACE OF MATURITY YET. LISTEN, WE DON'T GIVE UP ON OUR SALVATION BECAUSE WE FAIL, BUT WE PRESS ON. LISTEN, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID DAVID DIDN'T LOSE HIS SALVATION WHEN HE DID WHAT HE DID, BUT HE LOST THE JOY OF IT. &gt;&gt; HUH? HE SAID, "RESTORE UNTO ME [screaming] THE JOY OF MY SALVATION." LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT MANY OF US need today. &gt;&gt; Cuz we're not just quickened once. Did you know that? We're quickened many times by the SPIRIT OF GOD. I PRAY THAT WE WOULD BE QUICKENED THIS MORNING IN THE HOUSE OF GOD TO RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD AND TO PRESS FORWARD IN THE KINGDOM of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. He said it's got to keep drinking, drinking, drinking in order to push out. And when we take a promise of God, drop it into our heart. He keeps watering it with faith and it keeps pushing out, pushing out. Hallelujah. He said when Christ is planted in our heart, the Holy Ghost, only thing we do is drink in this word of God and it pushes out salvation. It pushes out divine healing. It pushes out glory. It pushes out. Everything that we have need of is right in us when we're planted in Christ Jesus. Now, we're gonna start preaching here in a minute. I just I'm not gotten yet to what I want to preach on. So, you just forgive me this morning. I won't hold you long. Help us. Lord is right. We must add virtue to our foundation of faith. Now remember second Peter chapter 1:5 Peter says beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge. So here's where we're at. We've laid a foundation and we're about to add to our faith virtue. Brother Brandon said here's what we do. What's the first thing? Have faith and be born again. That's laying the foundation. First pour your foundation. Then to your faith add virtue. I want to say something about add that word add in the in the in the uh New Testament. The u the authorized version or the King James version tells us to add one virtue to another. But the in the Greek it's actually to develop one virtue &gt;&gt; in the exercise of another. So it's an increase by growth &gt;&gt; not by external junction. &gt;&gt; So so it's an increase that comes from the foundation. each new grace springing out of attempting and perfecting the other. So it it's like this. In your faith supply virtue and your virtue knowledge, brother Brandham says it this way. He said when he's born again, he said then he's in line of fellowship because he's a new creation. He said that old suspicious doubting character he was. Do you remember that old suspicious doubting character you were? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you remember him or her? &gt;&gt; Remember them? They were suspicious. But now YOU'VE LEARNED TO TRUST GOD. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? RIGHT? You've been born again. &gt;&gt; But he SAID THAT OLD SUSPICIOUS DOUBTING character he was in is dead. Now he's a new creation. So you see, he don't have to add anything to his now because it'll automatically be added. &gt;&gt; Now that's a striking statement, brother Ram. You just told us add and ADD AND ADD. BUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF ADDITION that comes from within because the believer's been born again. So you add to your faith or or uh to your faith is added virtue. Virtue is actually manliness, valor, excellence. It's uh comes from a word that means to be stronger, to be a man. That's what it means to be stronger. It's strength. Virtue is strength. So let faith supply strength in in Luke 8:46 Jesus uses actually a different Greek word but it's dunan dunanimous which is a very similar meaning it also means strength and it's translated virtue in the English supernatural strength in Luke 8 verse 43 it says a woman having an issue of blood 12 years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him and touched the border of his garment. Now notice now Jesus has grown up. We've fast forwarded, right? Remember when you could had a VHS tape and you or or a cassette tape and you hit the fast forward and make that little sound? We fast forwarded to Jesus in his ministry, right? And he's healing the sick, raising the dead. He's the son of God. He's a manifested son of God. And so what's happening now is he has something in him to give out, &gt;&gt; right? He's got something in him. Listen, he he preached the SERMON ON THE MOUNT AS an adult. HE DIDN'T PREACH THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT AS a baby in the manger. &gt;&gt; Didn't you understand that this morning? HE DIDN'T COME OUT THERE AND SAY and say, "Blessed are the meek." &gt;&gt; Right? That' been that'd been a strange one, wouldn't it? A little bitty baby laying there and said, "Blessed are you, mother." You know, but what did he say? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Said, "You know what? The words of Jesus were when he come to you. Absolutely. Same as your baby was and I and mine were and and you were when you were a baby. He screamed. &gt;&gt; HE CRIED FOR HIS MOTHER. &gt;&gt; Was the cry of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; He wasn't full grown. HE WAS JUST A BABY. BUT NOW HE HAD GROWN UP. AND A WOMAN THAT needed help. YES, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; AND FOR 12 YEARS, SHE HAD BEEN TO EVERY DOCTOR THAT SHE COULD GO TO. AND SHE'D BEEN TO EVERY KIND OF A PHYSICIAN THAT SHE COULD. She'd been down to the maybe the psychiatrist and the psychologist and the AND THE MARRIAGE COUNSELOR. AND THERE nothing wrong with any of that, BUT SHE'D BEEN DOWN TO ALL OF THEM. SHE'D BEEN DOWN TO THE TO THE DOCTOR. SHE'D BEEN DOWN TAKEN THE PILLS. SHE'D DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOLD HER TO DO. AND THE BIBLE SAID IT JUST TOOK ALL HER MONEY. IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY HELP HER. BUT ONE DAY, SHE COME IN CONTACT WITH JESUS. AND HER FAITH REACHED A PLACE IF I CAN JUST TOUCH THE HYMN OF HIS GARMENT. I BELIEVE HE'S THE MANIFESTED SON OF GOD. I BELIEVE IN WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD ME. I BELIEVE IN THESE MIRACLES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE. AND AND IT INCREASED HER FAITH UNTIL SHE WENT AND TOUCHED SHE PRESSED HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD UNTIL SHE TOUCHED THE HYMN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; Of his garment. &gt;&gt; The hymn of his garment. Oh, church. And Jesus said, "And immediately hear her her BLOOD ISSUES STAUNCH." And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" And when all denied Peter, and they that were with him said, "Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee AND SAYEST THOU, WHO TOUCHED ME?" And Jesus said, "Somebody hath touched me?" &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For I perceive that virtue &gt;&gt; is gone out of me. See, he was that pyramid, right? He had virtue added to his faith. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; He He had virtue, something in him that he could give out to her, sir. &gt;&gt; And she was able to appropriate that by faith. DON'T YOU BELIEVE HE'S STILL THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST THAT CAN BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITY? DON'T YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN STILL TOUCH THE HYMN OF HIS GARMENT THIS MORNING? IF YOU'RE SICK OR IN NEED OR WORRIED OR STRESSED OUT THIS MORNING, YOU CAN STILL GRAB A HOLD [screaming] OF THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT &gt;&gt; AND TOUCH JESUS. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Somebody touch me." And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately. Now what did he say? Somebody touched me. Virtue virtue went out from me. Virtue went out from me. So he had conducted his life and followed the will of the father until there was virtue in him to give out. &gt;&gt; Now you say, well that that that could have come when he was a baby. But again, this didn't happen when he was a baby. Many people probably held him in their arms. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they may have passed him around like we do some of our babies here in the church from person to person and they held JESUS AND MAYBE FELT NO virtue &gt;&gt; and he didn't get weak. In fact, in that very crowd, THERE WERE MANY WHO TOUCHED HIM BUT THEY DIDN'T TOUCH HIM IN the right way. &gt;&gt; Right. They they they even brother Brandon said the soldiers laid THEIR HANDS ACROSS HIS FACE and they didn't feel no virtue. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; BUT A WOMAN COME BY FAITH AND FELT THAT. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But he had reached a maturity in his life before he began his ministry. He'd reached a maturity and then God evidenced it. He said, "Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world." He said, "This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased and pleased to dwell in." He said, "Hear ye him." And so, he's reached that. He's reached that place. He's a he's in his ministry doing what God called him to do. And here he has a strength and a virtue for others. But you know what we sing? We've sung it all our lives. I love the song. Brother Brandon said it was one of his favorite old hymns was to be like Jesus, &gt;&gt; right? To be like Jesus. What does that mean? It means to have virtue like Jesus, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? TO HAVE SOMETHING WITHIN US TO give out, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN WE CHANGE OVER and it's a wonderful thing to watch as a pastor because you get to watch people for years and people who are going through a trial many times need help. And people after they've COME OUT OF A TRIAL STRONGER than they were before, they can give help. &gt;&gt; And it's a wonderful THING TO WATCH THAT TRANSFORMATION, brother Paul, from somebody who needs constant attention and needs help and all THOSE THINGS AND THEN AFTER A WHILE THEY GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN receive help. &gt;&gt; There's something in them to receive help. OH GOD, I PRAY THAT'D BE SOMEBODY WHO COULD RECEIVE HELP. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And also give help. Listen, if you DON'T RECEIVE IT, YOU CAN'T EVER GIVE IT. I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE WHO WHO FEEL LIKE, WELL, I I, you know, I just won't bother nobody. I won't I DON'T NEED ANY HELP. I don't need any counsel. I don't need to hear preaching. I I JUST WON'T BOTHER NOBODY till I get things right. I work things out in my own mind. Listen, you can't do that. It's no shame in looking for help. EVERYBODY NEEDS HELP FROM now now and then. EVEN JESUS WAS IN A FLESH BODY AND WHEN HE WHEN THE DISCIPLES COME WITH HIM, HE SAID, "PRAY WITH me for an hour. &gt;&gt; PRAY WITH ME. STAND WITH ME. YOU NEED SOMEBODY PRAYING FOR YOU. YOU NEED A CHURCH BODY OF FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; But it's wonderful to watch that transfer over in life where somebody is very needy and then they get to a place where they can help. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then because they're human beings, maybe they get older &gt;&gt; and they need help again and then there's others who have virtue, right? Strength to help. Listen, virtue is strength for others. Brother Brandon said, "Virtue, before you can let it out, you've got to have it first." &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT, IT WON'T come out. There's nothing for it to come out of. I could go many different ways with this. It's why it's important for preachers to hear preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's why it's important for preachers to pray and and song leaders to pray and and deacons to pray and people WHO ARE GOING TO HELP SOMEBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. need to be helped [clears throat] themselves. Are you with me? If you can't receive, you can't give out. That's right. &gt;&gt; If you can't be led, you can't lead. If you don't have strength coming in, YOU CAN'T HAVE STRENGTH GOING OUT. WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO WITH our young people? OUR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING A LOT INTO them right now. We're trying to pour into them. WE WANT TO DO THINGS FOR THEM AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. I THINK US parents ought to support what the Sunday school teachers do. We're trying to pour something into them and they may have a Christmas play this year. I don't know about that. I I trust that they will. And that'll be A IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT to do that. And we ought to SUPPORT THAT IF WE CAN. WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING INTO OUR CHILDREN. SUNDAY SCHOOL, WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING IN. PREACHING THESE YOUTH SERVICES WE HAVE AND THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING IN TO THE CHILDREN. WHY ARE WE TRYING TO DO THAT? BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO STAY CHILDREN. WE WHEN THEY GROW UP, WE KNOW THEY WILL. WHETHER WHETHER THEY GROW UP SPIRITUALLY OR NOT, THEY'LL GROW UP NATURALLY. &gt;&gt; And we want them TO GROW UP SPIRITUALLY WHERE THEY CAN BE A HELP, WHERE THEY CAN BE THE deacons and be the song leaders, be the musicians, AND BE BE THE PASTOR. COME ON, CHURCH. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT &gt;&gt; IF THE LORD CARRIES. SO, LET'S POUR INTO THEM SO THAT THERE'S NOT A A DEFICIT OF STRENGTH IN THE NEXT GENERATION, BUT THAT VIRTUE will flow from one generation to another. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know about you, but I want to have a place that my kids can come to and touch the hymn of his garment. &gt;&gt; IF WE ARE THE [screaming] BODY OF CHRIST, &gt;&gt; I WANT THERE TO BE A PLACE ON THE EARTH. [snorts] AND I'VE thought a lot about this recently and I'm going to talk about you because y'all have pulled together so well. But I see so many churches fuss and fight with each other and carry on and and and and deacons at each other's throat and preachers at EACH OTHER'S THROAT AND EVERYBODY'S THINKING ABOUT DOING THIS OR DOING THAT AND THERE'S NO UNITY. AND I WANT TO ASK THE CHURCH, ARE YOU are are do you want a church? DO YOU WANT A PLACE FOR YOUR CHILDREN TO COME OR DO YOU WANT A FUSS? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH. &gt;&gt; You're going you're GOING TO DESTROY IT. YOU'RE GOING to You're going to cook the go the the the the golden egg that the goose laid. Maybe that's the wrong term. Kill the goose that laid the golden egg. I'll get my metaphors right in a minute. Do you WANT TO FIGHT OR DO YOU WANT to have church? &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PREACHER &gt;&gt; OR DO YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO HAVE confidence in the man of God? &gt;&gt; Well, come on, church. DO YOU WANT TO PUT EVERYBODY DOWN OR DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN LOVE going to the house of God? you you can't have both. &gt;&gt; So we want to put VIRTUE INTO THE NEXT GENERATION. The only way we can do that is by having virtue ourselves. If we DON'T HAVE STRENGTH COMING IN, you can't have strength going out. Now brother Brandham makes this allegory and he says he said, "What if SOMEBODY COME TO DRAW from us and they and the check bounced, right? IF SOMEBODY COME TO TOUCH THE HYMN OF YOUR GARMENT, we put it like that. They had confidence in you and faith in you that that you were we're the body of Christ, are we not? &gt;&gt; Somebody had confidence in faith in you that you could help. &gt;&gt; And maybe you you just not been receiving &gt;&gt; because of something. You know, something's just kept you. You've got some besetting sin in your life or some little issue that you've just not been following the word or maybe you got a critical spirit or something on you and you just not been receiving. And at that moment that baby needs prayed for. &gt;&gt; And that moment that that elder is on their last leg and you didn't know and you're asked to pray that moment &gt;&gt; they need virtue. &gt;&gt; Now all of us have experienced a virtue deficit at some point in our life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; if you don't believe me, you know, come to my house on Mondays, you know, look at Elijah after he preached to Jezebel and declared the word of the Lord and KILLED ALL THE PROPHETS AND then runs from Jezebel and tells GOD TO TAKE HIS LIFE. HE DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO GIVE OUT. But what did the angels do? THEY COME DOWN TO HIM AND AND THEY HAD A HE HAD A JUNIPER TREE EXPERIENCE AND THE ANGEL WITH THE SOFTEST HANDS CRESTED HIS BROW. THE ONE WHO KNEW HOW TO COOK. I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE ANGELS KNEW HOW TO COOK, BUT BUT THE BRANDON TOLD US THERE WERE. THEY COOKED CAKES, HE SAID, AND JOHNNY BREAD AND AND WHATEVER that is. AND AND AND CORNBREAD, WHATEVER IT IS. AND THEY THEY PUT IT TOGETHER AND AND COOKED IT FOR HIM. AND WHEN THEY DID, WHAT IT WHAT HAPPENED? IT STRENGTHENED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GO ALL AND DO ALL THAT GOD WANTED HIM TO DO. OH, CHURCH, DON'T YOU REALIZE THERE'S VIRTUE FOR YOU? SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO SIT UNDER A juniper tree for a while and take it. &gt;&gt; BUT BUT THERE'S VIRTUE FOR YOU. THERE'S VIRTUE. THERE'S STRENGTH GOD WANTS TO GIVE YOU. AND GOD, HELP US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND DRAW FROM THE STRENGTH OF THE WORD SO WE CAN BE READY SO THE CHECK DON'T BOUNCE WHEN SOMEBODY TRIES TO cash it. &gt;&gt; I probably shouldn't get into this cuz I'm going to make somebody feel bad because I know some of y'all do have done that. I do it too. Have done it in the past. Thank God I haven't done that in a long time. But you ever bounce a check? Nobody going to raise their hands. Some of our young people are like, "We never wrote a check." We talking about bouncing a check. We don't write checks anymore. Used to we, you know, checks would bounce cuz it take a couple days and you had hope, &gt;&gt; you know, that there would be money in the account. Some of y'all know what I'm talking about. That's the way some of us live spiritually. You know, we write that check. Oh, I'll pray for you, buddy. I'll be praying for you. And you just hope that that check don't bounce. Come on. &gt;&gt; But when you reach a place of maturity in your life, you realize, hey, the money's got to be there before you write the check. &gt;&gt; If I got nothing to give, I I've had to reach that I'm maturing as a pastor, and I haven't reached that place yet. Someday I'll be as mature as some others, but I I'm not reach that place of maturity yet, maybe. But you, you know, I I am beginning to realize that I can't give what I don't have. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. I I can't do that if I'm wore out and I've I've done, you know, just just doing whatever I wanted to do and and hanging out with people or doing whatever I want to do. Like, if I'm wore out from doing that, I can't preach the way I want to. Right? If I'm up all night Saturday night, I can't preach the way I want to. I believe God gives us grace if we have to do it. But when we can, when I can, I go to bed early on Saturday or I get I do what I need to do on on Saturday to get ready for Sunday or Friday to get ready for Sunday because I'm learning that if I don't have &gt;&gt; have it to give, I I'm no good to people. &gt;&gt; I'm learning that it's not how much you preach, but how well you present the gospel. AND AND IT'S THE QUALITY OF WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY, NOT JUST HOW MANY WORDS you say. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Right. AND AND WE ALL HAVE to learn that. And and IN OUR OWN LIVES, YOU GOT TO LEARN THAT IT'S NOT JUST, WELL, I'LL PRAY FOR YOU AND I'LL PRAY FOR YOU. YOU want to pray for people, BUT YOU GOT TO BE IN A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN PRAY for people, &gt;&gt; you know, and and people get discouraged when they can't empty the hospital, but you got to you GOT TO GET FILLED UP BEFORE YOU can go out and lay hands on the people. And that's that's a and I understand the Bible CALLS US TO DO THAT AND TO BE THAT. We're called to be sons. We're called to lay hands on the sick AND THEY'LL RECOVER. WE'RE CALLED THAT BY THE WORD. AND I BELIEVE IF I do it, no matter how tired I am physically, THAT THAT'LL GO TO YOU. But but I GOT TO HAVE SPIRITUAL VIRTUE IN MY LIFE IN ORDER TO give spiritual virtue out. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDON SAID IT MIGHT BE YOU SAY, "WELL, I WONDER WHY MY why my account is empty." Brother Brandon said it might be the reason you don't have it because many churches teach you don't have to have it or the days of its past. I'm glad that's not the case here. Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. We preach that the days of miracles are not past, but they're present. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That testimony of Lizzie Joe being healed has gone around the world now. I've seen it posted by people and gone around the world, and I I appreciate that. Let's be a strength to people. &gt;&gt; Let's be a strength. We don't have to be known everywhere, but when we can be a strength, let's be a strength. &gt;&gt; Listen, he said they they preached the days of miracles past. They don't have to have it. Only thing you have to do is just join church. Yeah. Days has passed. He said if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick, he's expecting the same virtue in his church BECAUSE HE WAS OUR EXAMPLE. AND IF HE HAD VIRTUE to give to the people, he expects us to have virtue to give to the people. What is virtue? VIRTUE IS STRENGTH, POWER. AND PETER SAID HERE, ADD VIRTUE. PETER'S talking about building the house of God. See, the temple of God, FIXING IT TO A PLACE, HE SAID, AFTER YOU HAVE FAITH, YOU MUST HAVE VIRTUE with it. Have virtue for who? FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. CUZ YOU DON'T KNOW WHO MIGHT BE WANTING TO PULL VIRTUE OUT OF YOUR LIFE. AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN SOMEBODY ELSE. IT MIGHT BE THE CASHIER AT THE GROCERY STORE. IT MIGHT BE SOMEBODY YOU DON'T BARELY EVEN KNOW. IT MIGHT BE A NEIGHBOR. IT MIGHT BE SOME SOME OF Y'ALL ARE NURSES. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT WORK. WELL, WHO KNOWS THAT YOU MIGHT GIVE VIRTUE OUT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS VIRTUE. I KNOW YOU'VE EXPERIENCED THAT, BROTHER LOGAN, WHERE SOMEBODY NEEDED STRENGTH AND YOU HAD SOMETHING TO TELL THEM, SOMETHING TO GIVE THEM. LET'S DRAW IN ALL WE CAN SO WE CAN HAVE VIRTUE FOR THE whole world. Come on. Yes. &gt;&gt; Not just think about ourselves, &gt;&gt; think about others. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; It's kind of virtuous tied to how we live. &gt;&gt; See, there's a direct link to how we live and the power in our prayers. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? You say, "Oh, that's not true. Why were the disciples not able to heal the child with epilepsy?" &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Think about it. We'll answer that in a in a moment. You see, preaching doesn't save us. It doesn't save me to preach, &gt;&gt; right? I should say it that way. Preaching does not save me. &gt;&gt; I could lay down my Bible today and never preach again. I would not be lost. &gt;&gt; Do we understand that? &gt;&gt; Works don't save you. &gt;&gt; Nothing you do can save you. &gt;&gt; That's on him. You can't by your own effort &gt;&gt; avail yourself of the cross of Calvary. &gt;&gt; He did that for you and had you in his mind or you can't you can't make get blood out of a turnup. Brother Brandon said, right? That's got to be something he did for you. &gt;&gt; Works do not save you. But the virtue I have to help others depends on how much confidence I have in my own life. Now, that's just the truth. Look what Look what John says. My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. AND HEREBY WE KNOW THAT WE ARE OF THE TRUTH, and shall assure our hearts before him. &gt;&gt; FOR IF OUR HEART CONDEMN US. NOW LOOK WHAT HE'S SAYING. JUST BECAUSE YOUR HEART CONDEMNS YOU DON'T MEAN YOU'RE LOST. &gt;&gt; When you WERE LOST, IT PROBABLY DIDN'T CONDEMN YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT YOUR HEART CONDEMNS YOU NOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SAVED. IT FEEL IT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING AGAINST THE WORD. YES. &gt;&gt; IF OUR HEART CONDEMN US, GOD IS GREATER THAN OUR HEART AND KNOWETH ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS YOU'RE HIS CHILD. HE KNOWS YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ELECTED CHILDREN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BELOVED, if our heart condemnth not. Now, here we come. Remember, we're beloved in him. &gt;&gt; We're in him. We're the beloved. He's greater than our heart. BUT IF OUR HEART CONDEMNTH NOT, then we have confidence toward God. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AND WHATSOEVER WE ASK, WE receive of him. Because I know you say, "Well, this is legalism." No, it isn't. It's virtue. &gt;&gt; Do Do you want to HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE? Then you need to have confidence in the atoning work of Christ first and then in what the atoning WORK OF CHRIST HAS DONE IN YOUR LIFE. and then you can begin to help somebody else. &gt;&gt; He said, "Whatever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight." I I think this morning as we kind of gear down now on what we want to talk about this morning and this virtue, we need to think on our ways. I played that that tape for my children this morning on the way. I was listening to it. already listened actually to brother Brandon preaches it three or four times and I listened to one of them and I listened to another one on the way to church and [snorts] part of it and in that sermon brother Brandham uses the text from Psalms 119 I thought on my ways and I turned my feet unto thy testimonies I thought on my ways brother Brandham deals with a sinner how they have to think on their ways then he deals with a church member he said or a person who's been saved and how we need to think on our ways &gt;&gt; right and so it's not just for sinners but when we think on the Lord when we think of what we're doing, then then we turn our feet unto thy testimonies. So, Brother Brandham uses the illustration uh in one of those times that he preaches that sermon, he uses the illustration and from, you remember when uh he was in trouble with taxes and all it was is he had signed a bunch of checks and put them into the ministry because he had personally signed them. They charged him with a big chunk of money for taxes and he was upset about it. He ended up settling with the government and paying it off, working to pay it off. And he was so upset he almost quit preaching. It was just an awful time in his life cuz here he'd done everything he could to help people and give it all away and they come after him anyway. And he talked about how that the government was so corrupt and the tobacco companies and and all these people had all these lawyers to, you know, and they could spend all this money and not pay any taxes. And then they were charging preachers taxes, right? Who were helping people. He just had to do it differently. So he didn't get charged that. And so, Brother Brandon was going through that time in his ministry. And and he talked about a tax man that called. You all know the story. and and the tax man called and the tax man said uh or it was actually the attorney I believe brother Brandham's attorney but they they needed brother Brandham they talked to him about it and so the attorney called and he said I [snorts] I need to talk to brother Brandham and and and me goes Bill and &gt;&gt; brother Brandham says tell him I'm not here as he stepped outside the door &gt;&gt; right and I know some of us have done that Of &gt;&gt; course, now we got caller ID and we don't have to, you know, &gt;&gt; just make them think we're not there, you know. &gt;&gt; So, but he had caller I he didn't have that and back then he had she answered the phone and and so brother Brandon said, "I started out I got my hat and I went down to make a sick call." Now, the way God dealt with brother Brandham on this was sort of severe. &gt;&gt; But I think it was to teach us a lesson. &gt;&gt; I I really do believe that. And because brother Brandham had to live in a place, and let me just say this, if you've got if you got if God's got really something to do in your life, then he's got to get you to a place of maturity, maybe beyond others, &gt;&gt; to get you a place where you can give out &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; and be a help. So here and that's why people who want to be prophets, who would want to be a prophet, right? Who would want to be a pro? Who would want that kind of that kind of responsibility? And I'd say that even about a pastor or something like that. Who would want that? They would wish that on themselves because you're responsible for people and for what you say. But the random was responsible to an age. &gt;&gt; And he had great responsibility and God held him to that. And he said, "I start out, I got my hat, went down to make a sick call and went into the room to pray for a little sick baby. Man had been waiting a long time with this baby. I WENT IN TO PRAY FOR IT. WHEN I STARTED TO LAY MY HANDS ON IT, something said to me, "Can you lay your lying hands on that child?" Now, think about this. Brother Brandham had an advocate, did he not? Same one we do. &gt;&gt; Right? That sin wasn't going to take him out of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; He was covered. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; We're covered. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it's having like having a license to speed. Did you know he said that? &gt;&gt; He said it's like if you He said if the speed law doesn't apply to you, he said then you can go as fast as you want. &gt;&gt; Right? And if you get stopped, you can tell the man. He said I it don't apply to me. I've been given permission by the mayor. Drive as fast as I can go. Right? So I can go as fast as I want. So that's the way a Christian is. &gt;&gt; You can live however you want to. I'M SO GLAD HE PUT SOMETHING in me to want to live for God. &gt;&gt; But yet, SO THAT WASN'T THAT THE SIN WASN'T COVERED, BUT WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM'S CONSCIENCE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT WAS BROTHER BRANDHAM'S OWN CONSCIENCE SAID, "CAN YOU LAY your lying hands on that child?" Just proved how close he lived to God. &gt;&gt; Because most of us maybe wouldn't be bothered by that, but he was. And the Bible SAID IN 1 JOHN 3:21, "IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US NOT, THEN WE HAVE CONFIDENCE in God." HE SAID, "THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER TODAY THAT THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH CAN'T GET ANYTHING DONE IS BECAUSE OUR HEARTS ARE CONDEMNING US WITH UNCONFESSED SINS." &gt;&gt; He said, "It's not easy for me to tell this, but it's the truth." He said, "That's the way to be truthful." I've told you the story, and I don't have time to tell it again today, but about the dove flying away. G get me to tell if you haven't heard it. Some of our folks are new, but when we were young and married couple, I got angry and slammed the door at something. And and when I did, I walked outside of our little place here right next to Sister Fritz here in West Plains. There was a dove sitting right there by by my door and it flew away AND MY HEART SMOKED ME. I went back in AND APOLOGIZED TO MY WIFE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON SAID THAT DOVE WOULD FLY AWAY WHEN WE GOT TO ACTING LIKE A WOLF. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever been there? Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, I STARTED TO PRAY AGAIN. LISTEN, he tries TO JUST IGNORE THAT AND TRIED TO PRAY AGAIN. I SEEN I WASN'T FIT TO PUT MY HANDS on that baby. I SAID, "SIR, I WILL SEE THAT YOUR APPOINTMENT IS HELD. YOU JUST STAY HERE." I RUSHED TO THE PHONE, CALLED THE ATTORNEY. I SAID, "CAN I SPEAK TO YOU A MINUTE?" HE SAID, "SURE, BUT THE OTHER fellas are done gone." I SAID, "JUST STAY IN YOUR OFFICE A few minutes." I RUSHED DOWN THERE, WENT INTO the room. I SAID, "ATTORNEY, I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. WHEN YOU CALLED A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I WAS THERE." I said, "WHEN YOU CALLED, YOU HAD ME SO NERVOUS. I HARDLY KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING. I WAS ALMOST BESIDE MYSELF. I SAID, I HAD MY WIFE TO ANSWER LIKE THAT, BUT IT WAS A LIE AND I LIED TO YOU AND I CAUSED MY WIFE TO LIE. He said, "Well, you wasn't in there just then, Billy." She said, "You wasn't?" I said, "I wasn't, but I run out of the house and run behind the house to keep from being in there." I said, "It's a lie." Anyhow, I said, "Will you forgive me for it?" Walked across the floor, looked me right straight in the eye. I could see in his gray eyes little tears BEGIN TO FORM. HE TOOK ME BY THE hand and hugged me. HE SAID, "BROTHER BRANDON, I'VE HAD GREAT CONFIDENCE IN YOU, BUT I GOT MORE THAN EVER NOW." WHY? WHEN WE THINK ON OUR WAYS. I WENT AND PRAYED FOR THE BABY. WHAT WAS THAT? HE HAD VIRTUE NOW TO GIVE CUZ HIS HEART WASN'T IN CONDEMNATION. &gt;&gt; YES, WE HAVE FREEDOM IN CHRIST. YES, WE'RE DELIVERED FROM SIN. YES, WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LIVING SOME KIND OF LEGALISTIC LIFE, BUT WE WANT TO BE SO CLOSE TO HIM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OUR HEART CONDEMNING US. SOMEDAY IT'LL BE OUR CHILDREN THAT NEED PRAYER. SOMEDAY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THE PASTOR. SOMEDAY YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH THE ASSOCIATE OR SOMEBODY ELSE. SOMEDAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LAY YOUR HANDS ON SOMEBODY AND EXPECT THAT PRAYER to be he be be met. &gt;&gt; HOW YOU GOING TO GET TO THAT PLACE, LIVE A LIFE THAT'S HOLY BEFORE GOD. &gt;&gt; Something comes up, just repent of it and let it &gt;&gt; let it go and move forward. &gt;&gt; Make it right if you can. &gt;&gt; That's why the disciples couldn't heal the epileptic child. &gt;&gt; The Brown said they didn't have confidence in who they were. Brother Brandon [snorts] said, "Remember they had the word and the word was fleshed in. The word told them, I give you power and they had the power, but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them. But Jesus had it. He was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen." He said, "Oh, bring him here. How long will I suffer you?" He had faith with his power. How did he? He said, "I can't do nothing in myself." Why? He relied upon what he was. He relied in knowing that he was the word. So that's primarily church. Even beyond how we live, we need to rely on who we are, &gt;&gt; right? And how we live is just an evidence of who we are. [snorts] But he had faith in God who made him the word. He was God the word and they was in him. That gave him faith because he understood his position. He knew what he was because the scripture had said he was this. And here every scripture tied in to prove he was exactly what the scripture said he would be. And he knew what he was. Therefore, he relied upon what God had made him. And if he did that, then can't we rely upon what God made us &gt;&gt; as believers. &gt;&gt; THESE SIGNS SHALL FOLLOW THEM. &gt;&gt; Someone say them. &gt;&gt; That believe. &gt;&gt; He had faith in what he was. &gt;&gt; And if you are a believer, YOU HAVE FAITH IN WHAT YOU ARE. YOU'RE a believer. And if you got FAITH IN GOD, THE BIBLE SAYS IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US, THEN WE CAN'T HAVE FAITH. BUT IF OUR HEARTS DON'T CONDEMN US, THEN WE HAVE FAITH. HAVE CONFIDENCE TOWARDS GOD. BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE DOING THINGS THAT'S WRONG, YOU CAN'T HAVE CONFIDENCE TOWARDS GOD. SO, SEE, YOU'LL AUTOMATICALLY KNOW THAT YOU'RE WRONG. YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF YOU'RE RIGHT. TELL YOURSELF IT'S OKAY. TELL YOURSELF IT'S NO PROBLEM ALL YOU WANT TO, BUT ON THE INSIDE, YOUR INNER MAN KNOWS THAT IT'S WRONG. &gt;&gt; Don't violate that. Listen, I don't preach legalism. You all know that. &gt;&gt; I don't do that. I don't harp on how our sisters DRESS OR HOW HOW PEOPLE DO THINGS. BUT LISTEN, YOUR HEART KNOWS. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; You wear that AND AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WRONG. EVEN OUR young people, my own daughters AND THOSE AND THEY KNOW when there's something, they know some of y'all got daughters old enough to know this. And I I say daughters, not to single one out, but [snorts] but you get daughters that are old enough, you know, and they'll come out on Sunday morning. Maybe y'all don't watch your children's dress this closely. maybe they haven't reached that age, but I do I'm not legalistic, but I don't want them going out in a way that would be embarrassing to them or to me. And so, I watch them and and I always compliment them when they're dressed nicely, you know, and if they come out and they're see-through shirt or something like that, and I don't have that problem very often, but I, you know, I'll say something to them, you need to put something under that, you need to change that, and you need to fix that. &gt;&gt; We're going to the house of God or we're even going to town, &gt;&gt; right? we we need to fix that. And so I've done that. But if you ever notice that kid even knows &gt;&gt; because they'll try to slip around me, you know, &gt;&gt; they don't want to be seen when they're in that condition. I don't have to tell you. Listen, your heart. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? It knows. &gt;&gt; It knows. I believe that many of us are Christians this morning. And I believe there's a time to preach those things and we will and we have dealt with those things but your heart knows. &gt;&gt; If your heart condemns you, just don't do it. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; You put that cigarette in your mouth and you think every time you're destroying your confidence towards God, &gt;&gt; huh? I don't condemn you. Do you realize, Brother Brandon baptized people who smoke cigarettes? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Sure he did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'll pray for people that smoke and and and and can't get kick that habit. Some of y'all had habits you couldn't kick all the at the first and &gt;&gt; you had to overcome things. &gt;&gt; And that person can be saved even. But God will deliver you of that if you let him. &gt;&gt; But what you're doing IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL IS YOU YOU smoke and then it's it's giving condemnation to your heart. You get to a place where you don't have any strength in YOUR LIFE AND NO VIRTUE TO EVEN OVERCOME YOURSELF MUCH LESS GIVE TO ANYBODY ELSE. AND WHAT IS IT? If you LAY THAT THING DOWN, IF YOU GIVE IT TO JESUS, YOU BUT I CAN'T. BROTHER BEN, WHY DON'T YOU COME AND TRY THE ALTAR ONCE IN A WHILE AND SEE IF GOD WON'T TAKE THAT THING FROM YOU, DELIVER YOU OF that thing. &gt;&gt; He said, if you know you're wrong, he said, [snorts] you automatically know that you're wrong, you automatically put yourself back there a sinner. You might be saved, &gt;&gt; but because you're doing something, you know it's not right. So you automatically know that you're wrong. And so you put yourself as a sinner. But when your heart don't condemn you, when your heart don't condemn you. You see the difference? Look, brother Trip, excuse me for using you, but you had a wreck on the way home from church here a while back. &gt;&gt; Could have died. God spared him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember in that service we prayed before our young people left to protect our young I didn't know what I was praying and God protected brother Trip. I believe that with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; He's alive today cuz God protected him. &gt;&gt; But how much confidence could you have if you're leaving a bar? &gt;&gt; Come on church. &gt;&gt; This is for our good. I'm not trying to scold you. HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE COULD YOU HAVE IF YOU JUST WATCH THIS R-RATED MOVIE AND somebody calls for prayer? How do you have that CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO SOMEBODY? LISTEN, you're still a believer. Are you with me now? You're still, if you've ever been a believer, if you've EVER GIVEN YOUR HEART clear all the way to God, YOU'RE STILL THAT WAY. YOU DIDN'T SUDDENLY NOT BECOME A CHRISTIAN, BUT YOU NEED TO THINK ON YOUR WAYS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO THAT YOU HAVE VIRTUE TO GIVE OUT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. LORD, help me to be that way. &gt;&gt; See, WE AUTOMATICALLY PUT OURSELVES BACK THROUGH A CENTER BY KNOWING THAT YOU'RE WRONG. BUT WHEN YOUR HEART DON'T CONDEMN YOU AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE a believer and there's nothing between you and God, YOU CAN ASK WHAT YOU WILL AND KNOW THAT IT'LL BE GIVEN BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD THAT'S GIVEN TO YOU JUST LIKE IT WAS TO THOSE DISCIPLES. HE SAID THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO DO THEN IS HAVE FAITH IN WHAT YOU ARE. HAVE FAITH IN WHAT THE WORD SAYS. WHAT BROTHER BRANDON TELL THE PEOPLE WHO COME UP FOR PRAYER. HE SAID FIRST IF THERE'S ANY UNCONFESSED SIN, HE SAID YOU MAKE THAT RIGHT. YOU YOU PRAY TO GOD. HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE, BROTHER BEN? JUST A SECOND. A MOMENT. IT JUST TAKES A MOMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD TO RELEASE YOU FROM ALL OF THAT. HE SAID, "MAKE THAT RIGHT AND THEN COME IN FAITH, CONFIDENCE, BELIEVING WHAT God's done for you. &gt;&gt; You don't HAVE TO HOLD YOURSELF HOSTAGE TO THE SINS OF THE PAST. LET IT GO. LIVE A DIFFERENT LIFE. LET WALK IN THE SPIRIT." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAYS, "THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS, WHO WALK NOT [screaming] AFTER THE FLESH, BUT AFTER THE SPIRIT." HE SAID in Galatians 5:16, "THIS I SAY THEN, WALK IN THE SPIRIT AND YOU SHALL NOT FULFILL THE LUST OF THE FLESH." &gt;&gt; This virtue has to come from within. It can't be put on. [snorts] Jesus said, "Consider the lily." I want to fast forward past the quote on this, but brother Brandham talked about the lily [snorts] and he talked about how it had something to give out. He called it an unselfish odor. Unselfish odor. He has it. Before he can give out honey, he has to have it. &gt;&gt; And so what does the lily do? It comes through trials. Comes through the muck. Are you still with me this morning? I'm about to close. &gt;&gt; It comes through the muck and the mire and the darkness and the gloom of the earth. We all come through that those stages and the lily begins to press its way towards the light, &gt;&gt; right? It begins to press its way. How many are pressing their way this morning? You begin to press your way toward the light. Little lily, all that would it would ever be was in the seed. But it's got a purpose. It's got to serve the purpose of God. And so it pushes its way up to the muddy bottom of the pond. Pushes its way up through the dark waters, to the brighter waters, up into the sunlight. And when it gets UP IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT COULD BE OF HELP to somebody. And brother Brandon says before YOU CAN GIVE OUT VIRTUE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO PREACH FAITH. WHERE FAITH IS PREACHED FROM THE WORD THAT CHILDREN LIVE BECAUSE YOU GOT TO HAVE FAITH TO BELIEVE. WE GOT TO PREACH THE WORD BECAUSE YOU GOT TO HAVE THE WORD TO BE ABLE TO HELP SOMEBODY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Many times virtue comes through trials. So [snorts] Job one time wanted to talk to God and he talked to him like this. He said, "Lord," he said, "if I could just find God." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You ever been like that? You've gone through a trial, maybe you've been sick, and if I COULD JUST FIND HIM, &gt;&gt; he said, "I'd go to his throne room." I SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF HIM AND I'D TALK TO HIM. AND HE SAYS THIS. HE SAID, "WOULD HE USE HIS GREAT strength against me?" He said, "No." He said, "He wouldn't USE HIS GREAT POWER." HE SAID, "BUT HE WOULD PUT STRENGTH IN ME." Will he plead against me with his GREAT POWER? NO. HE WOULD PUT STRENGTH IN ME IF I COULD FIND HIM. HE WOULD GIVE ME VIRTUE. OH, HOW WE NEED TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES. HOW WE NEED TO DWELL IN HIS PRESENCE. COME ON, CHURCH. DAVID SAID, "I WANT TO DWELL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ALMIGHTY. I WANT TO LIVE A [screaming] LIFE THAT'S HOLY BEFORE GOD. I WANT TO LIVE LIKE I'M LIVING IN THE TEMPLE. I WANT TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD EVERY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO. I WANT TO LIVE FOR GOD EVERY EVERY MOMENT THAT I CAN. I WANT TO PRESS INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. WHY? NOT BECAUSE I I'M NOT SAVED. KNOW I AM SAVED. THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO BE A GIVE WHAT THAT VIRTUE THAT I HAVE TO somebody else. &gt;&gt; He put strength in us. Brother said he may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That's his priority. He's sovereign, but it's with a purpose. If he didn't have a purpose, he'd be the author of frustration, not of peace. &gt;&gt; His purpose is that after we have suffered a while, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; we would be made [clears throat] perfect. Jesus growing up from a child to our redeemer cross. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. I want to ask you this this morning. If he became the stature of a perfect man, a manifested son, what would a manifested son look like? It look like him filled with virtue to give a dying world. If he did that by suffering, how will we get it any other way? &gt;&gt; Let's go back to our original scripture. As the musicians come, for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time. I want you to think about this for a moment. the sufferings, how difficult it is to get to church sometimes, and how much pain you've gone through, people did wrong to you. God just let him do it. Cheated you, lied on you, he just let him do it. He stood by because he's doing something for you. He He You go through sickness. Some of you all uh I I get proud of you at times because I I start thinking, you know, I could you couldn't hardly tell. I know some how sick some of y'all are sometimes how how you feel and I know because you've told me and yet you still have a smile in the house of God and still worship the Lord. And I think, oh God, what is he doing? There's virtue in you. But God's doing something in your life. if you may stand by for a moment because he said I reckon that the sufferings you put whatever you're going through in that of this present time are not worthy brother Cochran to be compared with the glory THE SUFFERING SAID GOD WHY DIDN'T YOU HEAL ME BROTHER BRANDHAM EVEN HAD THE QUESTION Lord why would you heal me now I suffered all these years he suffered with his stomach all them years his nerves he said why would you heal me NOW HE TOOK HIM OFF THE EARTH, BUT HE WAS SHOWING HIM SOMETHING. HE WAS MATURING HIM. He was growing him, MAKING SOMETHING OUT of him. The suffering is NOT WORTHY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE GLORY WHICH SHALL BE REVEALED IN US. For the earnest EXPECTATION OF THE WHOLE EARTH, THE CREATION waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. What did Jesus do when he come to the earth? HE GAVE ALL OF HIS STRENGTH. THAT'S WHAT THAT HE SAID VIRTUE. BROTHER said he got weak. He gave ALL OF HIS SUPERNATURAL strength for one woman who touched the hymn of his garment. We can't give what we don't have. Let's draw from him today. He's still the great high priest. He's the one who can WALK THROUGH AND CLEANSE THE WOMAN. AMEN. ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST COULD DO THAT. We just heard that the other day. BROTHER WAYNE LAWSON PREACHED A SERMON ON THE GREAT HIGH PRIEST AND HE TALKED ABOUT HOW ONLY THE HIGH PRIEST COULD HEAL A WOMAN IN THAT CONDITION. COULD PRONOUNCE HER CLEAN. Only the high priest, HE IS A GREAT HIGH PRIEST WHO COULD BE TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF OUR INFIRMITIES. LET'S DRAW FROM HIM THIS MORNING. LET'S REPENT OF OUR SINS. LET'S GET RID OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD HOLD US BACK FROM THE THINGS OF GOD. LET'S BE QUICKENED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL WE REACH A PLACE WHERE WE CAN START HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE. THERE WILL COME A DAY, BROTHER JAMES, WHEN YOU CAN HELP SOMEBODY. THERE WILL COME A DAY WHEN YOU CAN GIVE OUT. WHY DON'T YOU DRAW IN RIGHT NOW? DRAW IN WHILE YOU'RE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD CUZ THERE WILL COME A TIME YOU WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, let's be ready. said, "But brother Ben, he's not using me. Maybe he's building up that virtue in you for the sake of one for the sake of one lost soul. Maybe that LOST SOUL BE THE last one." You say, "Brother Ben, why do you do what you do?" We travel AROUND THE WORLD PREACHING THE GOSPEL WHEN we can. And I appreciate y'all making time for us to do that. Brother Joel goes and I go, and brother Stewart goes and we work here and YET WE GO. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING? TRYING TO BUILD STRENGTH IN OTHER PEOPLE. LISTEN, CHURCH, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT US. If we have a little strength, let's give it to somebody. Let's be like the lily. While we have this opportunity, we don't know how many services everybody wants to rush out of the building, but I'm not. It's just in general our culture. We're just ready to go. Yeah. What if he could put a little virtue in you if you just waited a moment and and Lord, forgive me of my sins. Wash me again in your blood. [laughter] CLEANSE ME FROM ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. SEARCH MY HEART. If I've done anything that would make it WHERE MY CONSCIENCE WOULD AFFECT ME AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY, TAKE IT OUT OF ME, LORD, so you could come and make a difference in my life. Some of y'all have family that's broken and destroyed by sin. And maybe you're the only one even COMING TO CHURCH OR SERVING GOD. LET HIM PUT VIRTUE IN YOU FOR YOUR FAMILY. LET HIM PUT VIRTUE IN YOU FOR YOUR CHURCH. Oh God, feel his presence here this morning. Let's just bow our heads. Hallelujah. I think every minister has felt that. I felt that myself many times praying for someone and their faith just draws the strength right out of you. Lord, help me have the strength, the spiritual strength to be able to give that. I wonder if we could all pray that way with every head bowed and every eye closed. Maybe you'd like to just slip up a hand to him and say, "Lord, I want that kind of virtue. Help me to receive so I can give. Help me. Help me, Lord. I want to not JUST BE A TAKER. I want to be a giver. I want to be a help. I have a purpose in life." Oh, granny Lord. Oh, my hands are up to. I [laughter] I want to be like the lily. Oh, brother Rams, there's a type of a pastor. I want to be somebody who people could draw on. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I pray you'd help us today. Lord, may we not spend all of our time worried about what somebody else is doing, but us, Lord. It's me, OH LORD, STANDING in the need of prayer. Oh God, may we may you may you put strength in us, oh Lord, in our families, oh God, so we can be a strength to others. If our hearts condemn us, Lord, that we we Lord, repent today. And we ask your mercy. Forgive us of every sin. Forgive us of every shortcoming, Lord. Lord, WE'RE NOT SINNERS. WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN SAVED BY THE BLOOD, BUT LORD, THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE DO maybe that are wrong, Lord, and we don't mean to do it, OH GOD. BUT MAY WE COME CLOSE TO YOUR THRONE. MAY WE LIVE RIGHT CLOSE TO YOU, LORD, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PEOPLE. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN, FOR THE SAKE OF ONE ANOTHER, LORD. So I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Take all the bitterness and the strife and the fighting and the fussing. Take it away from us, God. Oh God, I pray you'd grant it today. Take away all the sin, all the besetting sin, Lord. All the uncleanness, all the unclean thoughts, all the unclean words and deeds. Oh God, take it away from us today. Let us be helpful. Let us be a virtue giver. I pray you'd grant it today in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Could we sing this? Search me oh God. Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; Search [singing] [music] me, &gt;&gt; oh God. [singing] The altar's open. If you need to come and pray, [music] you just talk to the Lord now before we close. [singing] &gt;&gt; My heart [music and singing] Lord. Oh. [singing] [music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh.
