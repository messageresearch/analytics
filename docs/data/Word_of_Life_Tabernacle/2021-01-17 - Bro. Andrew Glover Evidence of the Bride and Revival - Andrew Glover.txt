your way here in this meeting this morning for it's in your name we pray the name of the lord jesus christ we ask these things and all the believers said amen and amen god bless you this morning the book of revelations here uh the book of revelation the eighth chapter i know uh you hear as message believers this morning so i know you're not unfamiliar with this verse but here in the first verse of the eighth chapter the bible says and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now if we could go the book of jeremiah the 32nd chapter jeremiah the 32nd chapter and i've got a few places here i'd like to read this morning if that'd be okay in jeremiah the 32nd chapter and the sixth verse you love the lord this morning are you happy to be a christian amen here in jeremiah 32 and verse 6 the bible says and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying behold hainamel the son of shalom thine uncle shall come unto thee saying by thee my field that is in anoth for the right of redemption is in thine to buy it so hamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word the lord and said unto me by my field i pray thee that is an anath which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew it was the word of the lord and i bought the field of hand about my son my uncle's son that was in anoth that weighed him the money even 17 shekels of silver and i subscribed the evidence somebody say evidence i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him in the money in the balances so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom that which was open and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of narah the son of manasses in the sight of hainamel my uncle's son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that said in the court of the prison and i charge baruch before them saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open notice sealed and then open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue therein many days for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in thy land one other place i'd like to read is revelation 21 and verse nine uh revelation 21 verse nine from revelation 8 you hear the seventh seal was open there were silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and you go to jeremiah and you see that there's a time of something being sealed in a time of something being open and there's actually an evidence of it being sealed then there's an evidence of it being open and when you come here to revelation 21 in verse 9 the bible says this and there came unto me one of the seven angels now i believe that that was the seventh angel which we believe to be william branham came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vowels full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither and i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife notice there i will show that word sho means to expose to the eyes or to give evidence or a proof of a thing he's saying i will give you evidence i will show thee the bride which is the lamb's wife we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats there for just a few moments this morning we thank the lord for the reading of the word of god don't we amen we believe that the word of god is true we believe it's inspired we believe it's infallible and we believe it's the perfect word of the living god this morning and from those scriptures i want to by the help of the lord maybe just to take here a few thoughts it's up on my heart maybe if i would title this morning i want to speak to you on the evidence of the bride's revival the evidence of the bride's revival and we i don't know if maybe some of you saw some of it or not they're on the facebook but we actually they're at home our church brother our pastor there brother sean martin also sends us greetings to you this morning but we had a meeting there last week on the the subject of the seventh seal it was about a seven day meeting and i tell you there for about two or three days or two or three nights of that meeting we were just soared in heavenly places just hearing the things of the seventh hill brother wayne lawson and myself there ministering in that meeting so i've been studying here in this area of the seventh seal and maybe if i could just take a few things this morning and share that with you i believe that the seventh seal is a powerful it's a powerful revelation don't you i believe it's a i believe it's the bride's revival i believe it's the bride's seal and i believe if there's ever been a time for the church of the living god to have a revival i believe the hour has come now for the church to have revival don't you i think if there's ever been a people on the face of the earth that can be in revival i believe the church of the living god which is the bride of jesus christ can be in revival now if i could say this morning before we can have revival there has to be a desire for revival there has to be a thirst for revival i just wonder maybe just by show of hands how many would say lord i desire amen a revival i desire a renewing i desire a refreshing the prophet of god says that is a thirst and he said that you see to neglect the thirst if you neglect to satisfy a thirst of water or food you will die if you neglect that thirst in your god you will spiritually die he said now you call for revivals but you wait for your church to have a revival he said well that ain't the revival for you he said the revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god there might not be another member of the church wanting that revival but if it breaks out in you it will break out in other places so amen when you when you begin to feel the first little nudge the first little pull for revival amen don't squash that don't don't don't try to silence that and then there is a reason why there is a desire in your heart for revival amen it's because god is desiring to do something in the church amen now amen i believe there'll never be a revival until the church gets in the spirit of revival the prophet said you get in the spirit of dancing he said you can't have a ball game unless you get in the spirit of the ball game you've got to get in the spirit of it and we can never have a revival in shreveport or anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of revival god can come and perform miracles he can show wonders he can stretch forth his hand to heal the sick and the afflicted the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but they'll never be a revival until the church gets in the spirit of revival so that tells me amen that the revival is not depending upon the preacher amen the revival is not depending upon the musicians or the song leader or the evangelist amen but the revival is relying upon those who are hungry amen to push beyond traditions and push beyond circumstances amen pushed me on all the things that would try to bind the church amen from having a revival now the word revival means amid an improvement in the condition or the strength of something amen in the religious sense it is a reawakening amen of religious fervor especially by the means amen of a series of evangelistic meetings now i know that denominations has actually changed the idea of what revival is amen pentecostals changed the idea of what revival was amen they thought revival was five or six or eight weeks of meetings and people coming in amen but the prophet come and said no a revival is not the adding of members amen but the revival is the stirring up of the members that you've already got amen to thank you this morning church we don't have to wait amen until a special meeting to have revival we don't have to wait ain't until something until some great convention takes place but i believe right here this morning amen if you're willing to push beyond your own humanity if you're willing to push beyond your own thoughts and your own motives and your own objectives amen i believe we can break into a realm this morning amen that the same spirit of god and then that field the upper room would come in this church this morning and would not just come to excite us amen but it would change its mind and then to think we have seen revivals we've seen true revivals amen and we've seen false revivals now you say what is a false revival well a false revival comes amen by departing from the word while trying to move the people and then they try to move the people but they're trying to move them maybe through the music or moving maybe through some special gift or something amen that is a false revival amen of trying to move the church without the word amen let me say it like this but a true revival amen comes by coming back to the word in order to move the people the prophet said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches in every age it was the same cry hear what the spirit says if you are a christian then you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach that word he says every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age he said the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word of god repent and come back to the word from the first book in genesis to the last book in revelation one reason amen for god's displeasure was leaving the word amen and there is only one remedy amen to regain his favor is to come back to the word amen see to displease god is to leave his word amen but to please god is to come back to his word amen now we've had all kinds of revivals can amen if you forgot the word and say man amen we've had all kinds of revivals right we've had church revivals we've had denominational revivals we've had man-made revivals we've had intellectual revivals yet to think of all the revivals we've had and then the prophet of god would say but we haven't had a revival yet and many would say we're talking about revival and we ain't had no revival yet we've had a lot of protractive meetings but a revivalist when they tear down the sheds and go to pray and get right with god he says in the third seal that's the reason today that the revivals were supposed to have we had denominational revivals but we haven't had a real story no no no no sir don't think we've got revivals we haven't oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members amen but not a revival nowhere he said the bride hasn't had a revival yet amen we've had man-made revivals we've had intellectual revivals we've had a million more in 44 we've had youth for christ amen we've had billy graham and oral roberts we've had all these things but in the midst of all that we've not had a revival yet he said there's been no revival amen no manifestation of god he meant to stir the bride see we're looking for it and it will take those seven unknown thunders amen back there to wake her up again he said he will send it he promised it now watch she was dead amen now how many will agree that at one time amen the prophet said the bride was dead they met in traditions and creeds amen she was bound in denominational graves amen they were shouting and they were rejoicing they were hollering they were dancing but there wasn't a revival nowhere he said see they've got the hell of his coming and all they'll pray oh they'll post amen is fast praying fast pray remember brother jack moore and sister moore printed the herald of his coming he said all they'll do is pra as poster print fast pray fast pray god's not done yet send a revival he said see the problem is amen by being a christian amen they feel the pull of the hour amen but they have missed the awakening of the bride they've been seeing the third seal he said there's been no manifestation yet there's been no revival yet there's been no real stirring yet amen but somewhere between 63 and the third seal amen and the feast of trumpets or recognizing your day he could say but today amen she was dead amen but she is awake amen can i take the breaks off and preach here for a minute amen then what woke her up it was when the seventh seal come open and then there was a revival amen that was birthed out of this book amen i'm just going to preach here for a second i don't believe the bride's revival is a bunch of pentecostalism i don't believe the bride's revival is a bunch of emotionalism i believe the bride's revival is the same kind of revival that they had in the days of nehemiah when the word returned to the church when the power of the book come open when the word was released come on church amen when the word is preached there'll be demons cast out when the word is preached amen the sick will be healed when the word is preached even people will be transformed amen from a life of sin into a life of service what do you say in church i'm saying we're not looking for revival this morning we're not trying to fast and pray revival down this morning but the opening of the word has brought a revival in the church of the living god oh somebody shout revival no shout out like you believe it revival amen this week we didn't come for no intellectual talk this morning we come here for revival amen i don't believe the seventh seal was hoping amen to quieten the church down i know there's been a lot of false teachers amen that's mister mistake the seventh seal mistake the seven thunders misrepresented what the prophet meant by the third paul amen but let's come back to the homeland of the bible this morning and let's realize church we are not looking for a revival we have got a revival by the opening of the word see the bride was not awakened and then went back to sleep amen the bride was awakened and she stayed awake she was not awakened by the manifestation of god in those seven thunders and then went back to sleep and then god raised up some man in this last day amen to reawaken her he meant when she was awoke amen she is awoke and that when she woke up she stayed awake amen the prophet said it'll take what it'll take them seven thunders amen to wake up the bride amen i know when you mention seven thunders people get all wadded up amen but let me just remind you before a man mistaught the seven thunders amen william branham taught the truth of the seven thunders and the bible said in revelation 10 3 and he cried with a loud voice that's when a lion roared and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying to me amen seal up those things amen seal up those things which were which the seven thunders uttered and write them not amen see they uttered but john could not write them and then he had to seal them up and the prophet said it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of jesus amen came forth amen see it was not in the beginning it was not in the middle but it was in the end time period that the seven thunders of jesus came forth he said what was in those thunders no one knows amen but we need to know amen and he says and it will take a profit to get the revelation because god has no other way of bringing out his scriptural revelations except by a prophet see revelation does not come out but by a prophet notice here he said with both the theologians and the people having departed from the word god always somebody shout always god always sent his servants amen to the people but apart from the theologians in order to correct the false teaching and lead the people back to god he said now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 is going to do two things amen one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children amen to the fathers now here's the second thing he will reveal amen the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are somebody say with me which are the revelations contained in the seven seals amen so now brother david it's not me telling you it's not brother ben telling you or some other preacher telling you what the seven thunders are we now have a vindicated prophet on the earth declaring that the seven thunders are contained in the revelation of those seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally amen i love that word that will literally even turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers amen brother what it's going to do is it's going to come down in the church and it's going to move the church amen come on church this seventh seal it's not some mystery this seventh seal is not some education this seventh seal is not some some scriptural learning this seventh seal amen is christ himself coming back in the church and taking possession of the hearts and lives of the people and literally somebody shout literally amen literally turning the hearts of the children back to the faith of the bible oh to think this morning the opening of that seventh seal will produce amend the bride's revival amen you say then what is the bride's revival the bride's revival is a word revival the bride's revival is a word revival see the prophet says education can never bring life it takes the spirit of god to bring life and the life must not come out of just the intellectual revival broken sisters it's got to come out of the bible he says word revival and that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens you get the same results that you did in acts chapter 2 exactly it always has and it always will be because it's the spirit of god that conditions the atmosphere it takes atmosphere to do things amen now can i just take a little liberty here and preach amen without an atmosphere i mean this is just a building without an atmosphere this is just a pulpit without an atmosphere this is just another platform amen but if an atmosphere comes in here amen if an atmosphere amen i know a lot of people's got a lot of different opinions but guess what i got the microphone this morning amen i'll tell you what the prophet of god said he said it takes an atmosphere a meant to bring a birth it takes an atmosphere amen to bring a change let me say this we have gotten so oh god amen we all didn't know i wasn't no bank no pennywise preacher amen i'm gonna preach here for a second amen we've gotten so cold and so indifferent and so intellectual that we can't even say amen no more we can't even shout no more we can't raise our hands no more we just come and sit and look at the preacher and say move me if you can amen if you find something good i might have i might happen to have it amen amen but that's not the bride amen that's not the word amen the word says let everything that hath breath praise ye the lord i think this morning church i think it's time we let the devil know there's still some holy ghost alive in word of life tabernacle there's still some hallelujahs there's still some amens there's still some thank you jesus there's still some worshipers come on church you realize an atmosphere is not made an atmosphere is created you don't make an atmosphere you create an atmosphere you don't build an atmosphere you create it you say that how can i create it because the prophet said you are a secondary god he said you are an amateur creator you've got to write this morning come on church you've got the right this morning amen to create an atmosphere in this church that'll pierce every demon of unbelief that'll bring joy back in the church you say how do i do it amen when you push past what is pushing against you when you push back against the spirit that's trying to hold you when you push back beyond the formalism hey and you realize if i just create an atmosphere something good is about to happen and then look at somebody and say something good is about to happen when believers get together i'll tell you what happens demons are defeated when believers get together revelation comes and changes lives and without this seventh seal we are a hopeless church we are a confused people we are a powerless preacher but with the opening of the word all power in heaven and earth is with this message if somebody will believe it amen god will come down [Applause] it takes an atmosphere it takes an atmosphere and then to see a change it takes an atmosphere to see a breakthrough can i preach to you for a second you know what some of us need this morning is a breakthrough you know what we need this morning is a breakthrough you know how you're going to get it you ain't going to get it sitting there sleeping and you ain't going to get it sitting there texting and you ain't going to get it sitting there saying how long i'm preaching but when you begin to peck against the shell that you're in when you begin to peep oh come on church amen how many say this morning i want to break through amen i want to break through i'm tired of this coming to church i'm tired of just paying my tithes i'm tired of just singing the songs god this morning i want to break through i want to break through this barrier i want to break through this wall i want to break through this coldness i want to break through this formalism i want to break through this lukewarm condition that's trying to steal my victory trying to steal my joy you say is it possible brother harvey all things are possible to them that'll believe this morning i believe there's some eagles here but you got to peck your way through oh ain't nothing wrong with me i just got victory ain't nothing wrong with me i just believe the word is open ain't nothing wrong with me i believe the seventh seal is more than a history lesson i believe it is a word revival and let me say it like this there is a drastic difference between a word revival and a denominational revival amen there is a drastic difference the prophet said this this after effects of the revival he says the after effects of the meeting when he preached on the holy ghost he said are these questions now think about that amen the prophet preached a three-part series on what is the holy ghost what is the holy ghost given for and then he comes with quests and answers on the holy ghost out of that word revival he says the evidence of the after effects of this meeting will be the questions that come from what's being taught now do you realize those were not questions that was leading to unbelief but they were questions that was broad in the understanding of the subject that was at hand i say this morning church it's a sad day when the effect of the word and the effect of the revelation has been crucified around our churches it's a sad day when the effect of the holy ghost has been squashed down by some cold spirit it's a sad day when the power of the holy ghost has been reduced to shaking a preacher's hand and claiming you believe god sent a prophet there is a power in this message church there is a reality in this message there is a place you can go where the holy ghost can light your fire and let me just say this if this message don't light your fire i think your wood's wet if this message don't set your soul on fire something's wrong somewhere well preacher what are you talking about the prophet god said we have got the revelation amen now can i preach this morning amen i'm going to take my time and preach all right amen we just got one service so relax okay amen we have got for revelation see you've got every right to sit there with a coldness this morning if you're looking for the revelation you've got everyone to sit there without a sound in your heart without an amen upon your lips if you're looking for the revelation rather being if you're hoping the revelation comes but a prophet said remember what time is it sir how many ever heard it three of you how many ever heard it he said what time is it sir he said amen exactly that's right he said now notice now then we've got now we've got the revelation in this last days for the message of the lord god to gather his bride together we're not looking for it we've got it you say how did it come the same way it came to moses the same way it came to paul you say what way was that brother david do you realize amen that moses went to the desert and their god came down and revealed to him the revelation do you realize paul went to the desert and there god came down and revealed to him the revelation and do you realize william branham went to a desert and the same god that came to paul was the same god that came to moses it's the same god that came to william branham and revealed to him the revelation come on church it's shouting time won't you take your sad shoes off and put your joy shoes on this morning we ain't looking for the revelation we ain't praying for the revelation we are the possessors this morning of the revelation that'll change the body of the bride yes sir no other age has it been promised but in this age malachi 4 luke 17 30 john 14 12 joel 2 38 we are under the effects of the revelation of the seventh seal amen can i preach to you for a second we are now under the effects of the revelation of the seventh seal the prophet said watch the effect of revelation of who god was had upon abraham look what it did to him he said after his name was changed from abram to abraham he see three men coming and he called the three one my lord three being one not so at number six lodge he seen two coming and said my lord abraham's vision and revelation showed him that he was the all-sufficient elohim abraham come under a revelation that that was not three gods he said my lord amen and by coming under that revelation it changed his vision it changed his perception it changed the way he talked come on church and the prophet said see what it done it changed abraham forever well he said brother andrew what evidence do we have well actually we have bible evidence you say what is bible evidence brother said now therefore i stand here with the ministers around me behind me and out in front christian people and here we stand here and i claim somebody say i claim that the bible evidence of jesus christ is the prophetic sign the bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever now do you realize today amen that that sodom is positionally where it's supposed to be do you realize today washington is positionally where it's supposed to be do you realize today that the church nominal is positionally where it's supposed to be do you realize amen they've already found their place amen they're setting in place this morning and the prophet said and so has this abraham group amen so has this group that has seen the effects of the revelation of jesus christ we have seen the effect of it we have felt the pull of it we have seen the charge of it and the prophet said that's the way you've done the church we've made it pretty and we've decorated it with denominational tinsel but it ain't got no life in it it can't produce that bible evidence again see now who are these promises made to these promises are made not to the church nominal not to the hybrid church not to the national church not to the government church these promises are not made to those these promises are made to the elected now do you realize the prophet said this when jesus come on the scene he promised us a land he said in my father's house of many mansions and there's life beyond death and he crossed jordan what we call jordan death he crossed over into the other land and brought back the evidence he crossed over into the other land and brought back the evidence on the third day he rose again he eat he drank and he said feel me i'm not a spirit i'm flesh and bones and he said i'm going to give you an earnest to this but wait up there for 10 days they got perseverant after that too because they had the power the evidence of the resurrection in them that's the reason they loved not their lives unto death because they could be perseverant they had evidence see what did evidence do evidence moved them into action evidence moved them into perseverance evidence moved them into faith see the problem of god said and you have the earnest the first payment on the eternal resurrection now what is evidence evidence is the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid see you can have a belief you can have a proposition but without evidence it's just a belief without evidence it's just a proposition but when there comes evidence it'll change it from being a proposition from just being a belief to being a living reality now how many will agree with me amen that moses actually sent spies to search out the land if you look at numbers 13 and verse 1 the bible said the lord spake unto moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel every tribe of their fathers shall send a man everyone a ruler among them now notice here moses sent them up by the way of the clan of canaan and said them get you up the way southward and go up in the mountain and you see the land what is it and the people that dwell therein whether they be stronger weak fewer many notice here he actually says go in there and search out the land and when you get in there see if they be few or many now here's what i love about it they meant there were many giants in the land but what does it matter if they're weak if there's many there what difference does it make if they're weak enemies notice here in verse 23 and they came unto the brook of escal and cut down from fence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they buried between two upon a staff and they brought out the pomegranates and of the figs notice here and the place was called the brook escal because of the cluster of grapes which the two of israel cut down from thence and they returned from search land 40 days now can i read you something the prophet of god said lord jesus confirmation how we thank thee for the presence of the divine one tonight if the people could only realize their authority in him oh how great it would be lord if they can only believe it and have faith may they to not take a hold of that faith they've been taught it they've been preached it's been preached them and they have read it out of the bible they have seen others who appropriated o great god jehovah the mighty one who was made flesh and blood among us now somebody shout now now you're made flesh in our flesh by the holy spirit here tonight quickening the word and clicking the promises that you have spoken notice here what did caleb do caleb sent spies or rather moses sent spies and land and caleb come back or they come back with the evidence of the land and i preached this morning they came back from the land with evidence that you know what i like brother harvey is they went over there and they got a cluster of grapes they went over there and got a cluster of the grapes and they came back and the bible says the grapes were so big now do you ever go to the grocery store and buy some grapes do you go in there and ask somebody to help you carry the grapes out to your car you don't do it you know why because them grapes ain't that big them grapes ain't that heavy them grapes ain't that great amen but these grapes were so big and these grapes were so strong that they said we've got to have help we've got to have help he meant to carry this evidence amen i could preach there for a while couldn't i taken sides with jesus oh how i would love to take some of these young men and send him an evangelist amen to help with this message amen to help care come on church to help carry the evidence what is this message this message is the evidence that there is a land beyond the river this message is the evidence to every song about heaven this message is the evidence to every song about victory this message is the evidence to every song about joy when you go over there caleb come back and he begin to feed upon the evidence of the land you know what it does he began to eat on them grapes he began to eat on them grapes you know what happened the product of god said caleb got so inspired they've been paraphrasing he got so inspired by eating on those grapes you know what them grapes did them grapes begin to release them grapes begin to release amen begin to release an anointing begin to release something in him that he said you know what we are well able to take this land you realize a few this was an 80 year old man but he began to eat on the evidence of the land and the evidence began to fill him up and the prophet said don't mind me for perspiring and slobbering i'm just eating the evidence i'm just seeing the evidence of the land beyond the river are you hearing me he said see the evidence and then caleb was the type of the true believer joshua was the top of the leader i'm trying amen help me somebody amen the evidence of the land amen was there the evidence was real and god sent josh away who would be a leader ain't meant to lead him in that land amen brother ben he would lead them amen beyond their inabilities come on church brother josiah do you realize caleb was 80 years old amen but when he began to eat on the land it began to release an anointing in him it began to release a fire in him what are you saying i'm not preaching this morning for my health i'm not up here just to have a pulpit i'm trying to get you amen to push me on your fear please be on your doubt i'm telling you church there's evidence here this morning there's evidence here this message is real if you'll just start eating on the evidence of it it'll release a fire in you it'll put an amen in your heart do you realize caleb was an old man with stooped shoulders with gray hair with a wrinkled face with no abilities of his own but when he ate the evidence when he ate the evidence it put a fire in him he said you know what if these grapes are so good i don't just want an appetizer i want the seven course meal i want the seven course meal i want every bit of it the evidence now what is the evidence you say the evidence is not natural grapes today you're right the evidence is the holy ghost well you see jesus didn't promise us a land caleb and joshua was promised the land we are promised the land not a land the land the prophet said the pilgrim fathers were very thankful for their newfound way of life being separated from the old english denominations and creeds he said could be married to the new anointed word for their age separated us and opened to us a new land a new message for this day separated us from the old land us from the old traditions and opened opened notice it didn't say in revelation 8 1 and when the seventh seal was sealed there was silence in heaven about the space of an hour no it said when the seventh seal was opened now you'll agree with me this morning amen that the message of the hour is the opening of the book it's the opening of the word it's the revealing of the son of man it's the manifestation of the third pool it's the power amen of god to bring a church into adoption it's the reality of the theophany it's the pull from another dimension come on church this message should not be looked at casually this message should not be treated that's just another idea this message should be the headship of every preacher it should be the headship of every pulpit this message is the opening of the new land now our country a nation has recently been changed forever over one word election this country will never be the same over one word election you say what are you talking about the devil is trying to get our eyes off of our election on to the election of this world now you realize our president claims that this last election was rigged that's a claim now let's just let's well we're here we might as well preach it we we're this far into it let's go and deal with it it's a claim but you know what it's only a claim if there's no evidence but when you've got evidence then you've got more than just a claim now you've got people that's got to be under obligation to look at the evidence see now they can't just dismiss the claim there's evidence but we live in a nation where you can have hundreds of thousands of evidence and affidavits and they won't even look at it no i'm not preaching politics but i'll just throw that in there for free amen our world has changed forever but you know what as much as i hate to see what's going on there i have to realize that the devil is trying to get our eyes off of our own election the bible says in first thessalonians 1 4 knowing brethren beloved your election of god in second peter 1 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your call and an election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall look at what this word call it means it means to a feast the divine invitation the word election means the act of picking out amen used the fact or the act of god's free will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed his blessings to certain persons notice here and then that word fall means to stumble or fall in misery do you realize that the point of god said the devil can make you think you're called when you're not and he can make you think you're not called when you are he can make you think you are called when you're not and he can make you think you're not called when in reality brother joe you are when in reality there is a call upon your heart now notice here a preacher with a ministry is commissioned by god right but he must be called and he must be elected amen now do you realize the bride of jesus christ must be amen commissioned by god to be the bride she must be called by god and she must be elected by god to be the bride now let me say this the opening of the seventh seal was the calling out of the bride and the bringing of the commission to the earth to find a bride and to be the bride see the seventh seal commission was not just find the bride it was when you find that bride then preach a power that will equip her to be the bride what good does it do brother caleb amen to preacher the bride to preachers of bride to preachers and bride if we don't preach something that'll put a backbone in the church not to just claim they're the bride but to be the bride to manifest the bride to manifest the promises that was written concerning the bride now in genesis 24 you realize eliezer was commissioned to find the bride for isaac and the power of god used this term he says ministers hunt my bride amen notice here hunt my bride now in 1963 amen is this okay in 1963 we hear the term the calling out of the bride today is the calling out of the bride out of the church the exodus for the rapture feast the trumpets the long period of pentecost which ends in the calling out of the bride the bride is called out by a servant get it preacher c don't miss it question answer 64. then come the time of the calling out of the bride which was to escape all the damnation notice here in works is faith expressed and those men maybe some of them present here here in the tape around the world may they realize that this is the calling out of the bride this is not brother howard this is not a pentecostal message this is not a pentecostal restore the gift he said that was the pentecostal age but this is the calling forth of the bride another message that was to come just before sodom was to be born to be burned he said let them understand then see the difference in this message amen the pentecostal message brought a restoration of the gifts but the seventh angel's message brought an understanding of the giver glory to god amen the pentecostal message brought a restoration of the guests but the seventh angel's message will bring an understanding that we don't just have the gifts but we've got the giver brother ben we don't just have the gifts this morning we have the giver now why brother andrew why is the bride called out she is called out for the ministry of christ to be manifested in the ministry of the bride see this is more than just a ministry of a prophet this is more than just the ministry of a preacher of the pastor of an evangelist this is the hour for the ministry of the bride can i preach this morning it has to be because a woman and her husband become one they become one and so does the bride and christ become one the ministry of the bride and the ministry of christ is the same it's not two separate ministries it's the same so then when god gives a commission he will give a confirmation of the commission let me say this the bride's commission is not a natural commission the bride's commission is not a church commission the bride's commission is a supernatural commission that came from a supernatural god who gave the supernatural power for a supernatural deliverance somebody shout deliverance somebody shout deliverance a natural deliverance see this morning i believe it god is not going to deliver his people by education then the seventh seal is not a learning god is not going to deliver his people by theology then the message of the hour is not theology he's not going to deliver them by science then the message of the hour is not science are you hearing me why would god send a supernatural message then let a bunch of preachers define what that message is if god sends a message he defines what kind of message he's sending if god sends a commission he don't need a preacher to define what kind of commission it is he defines it himself and this is not a natural commission this is not a natural calling this is a supernatural commission well he said with andre i don't think that i don't think we need all this pentecostal hard and carrying all that i tell you what i just i just with brother ben and brother then brothers up there quit shouting hard and carrying on i was brother being quit trying to preach so amen won't you join him this is not a theology come on church you sleep in school i've done it education's boring come on well i just killed the meeting right turned five minutes didn't i hey hey at least get a kid to say amen now education's boring amen i mean i remember being a kid sitting in school looking out the windows i'd see a turkey out in the field and a squirrel out in a tree i think my god that's what boys was born to do is go out there and kill them thanks not sit here listen to this algebra we'll never use right amen but you know what amen there's no reason amen you don't shout in school you don't holler even when the teacher says we're gonna learn two plus two you didn't get up and dance did you you know why cause it's an education there's no anointing behind it there's no power behind it amen but when a teacher said you passed the test you can go home amen that wasn't education that was a reality and you know what this prophet was saying he was saying you're the bride you've been commissioned to be the bride you're the chosen and oriented of god you know what i'm not teaching this morning i'm declaring to you church you have been released by the opening of the word amen to possess the land to take the inheritance this ain't an education this ain't a theology this ain't a learning this is a reality oh since the prophet you say what are you saying i'm saying he didn't send an education he sent a power he didn't send the learning he sent an anointing he didn't send a suggestion he sent a commission can i give you one more he didn't see in the definition right he sent a vindication you say what are you talking about a definition can be anybody's things come on well let's break it down there's a chair right you know what i say i say a chair you can sit in it brother ben comes along and says a chair is a place you can rest brother joe comes along and says a chair is a bottom and a top and you can sit there and you can you you can sleep in it see we got one item now with three different definitions but when a voice of vindication speaks there's nothing can be added there's nothing can be changed there's nothing to be taken away when the voice of vindication speaks it's the absolute it's the final now i'm just going to take the breaks off and preach here for a second because since the prophet preached the revelation of the seven seals how many believes he preached that how many believes he finished out his earthly ministry do you realize since that time there has been what we call the case of the seventh seal come on come on the case of the seventh seal you say what is it this is it is it open or is it closed can i take some liberty here is it open or is it closed is it revealed or is it still going to be revealed is it sealed or is it still going to be unsealed well let me just say this what is the case a case is an incident or set of circumstances under police investigation it is a set of facts or arguments supporting one side in a legal action now the prophet of god i'm so down here because i want you to get this the prophet of god preached a message called a trial he preached a message called a court trial you know what he preached that message several times you know what he says i want to have this little trial first and now the case today in the court trial the case is the word of god's promise versus the world now a case cannot be called unless it's for some cause a case cannot be called unless it's for some cause now watch here you realize it's amazing now this is amazing to me because we're living a day and time now brother josiah we've got preachers who have left this message that are now putting this message on trial well let's preach we might as well but brother harvey literally got the nerve to put this message on trial you know a guy the other day he sent me that he sent me a part there she said watch this he said the message is on trial i just laughed to myself you know why because 56 years ago the messenger who was bringing the message put his own message on trial in front of several different congregations and every time the judge of all judges the supreme ruler the supreme king came down in the building and picked up the gavel and hit the desk and said the verdict is in the message is the truth listen church the case is closed this morning this message is not up for debate this message is not up for interpretation this message is not up for man's ideas the case is closed this morning this message is the truth then what is it looking for it's looking for somebody who will believe it and let it become the preeminence of their life [Music] now a case begins with a claim don't it come on the david acclaim is made a claim help me lord acclaim means to state or assert that something is the case typically without providing evidence or proof so you can make a claim but without evidence it's just a claim see jesus said destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again you realize what jesus just did he made the claim of all claims he made the claim of all claims destroy this temple and in three days i'll raise it up again do you realize there was confucius there was buddha there was muhammad there was all kinds of great men who were making claims the same way jesus did but you realize there was just claims because the prophet said here this morning we have sure solid rock foundation of the evidence of the resurrection now let me say this education cannot produce evidence of the edge of the resurrection it takes faith to see the direct evidence of the resurrection of christ so what is a claim a claim is just a claim without confirmation evidence the strength of a claim is evidence the strength of a claim is evidence let's say that together the strength of a claim is evidence see the bible says abraham made a claim that he and sarah would have a child you realize abraham claimed that by an unseen evidence there would be a visible manifestation help me jesus that would be like brother joel me going outside and looking and seeing a brand new a brand new 1500 pickup out there we'll call it a chevrolet right because that's that's that's a good truck right amen there's a brand new 1500 silverado truck out here and you know what i say brother joel it's got your name on it you and you and your wife are gonna drive at home today you know what i went out there i saw the evidence of it you know what i did i opened the door and i got the title out of it and i put it in my pocket and i come back in here and i said church there's a brand new truck out there brother joe and his wife is going to drive at home you know what i did i went out there nobody else in here saw it but i saw it see no one else god no one else out there saw the truck but i laid my eyes on it and i came in here and i preached a promise to you that you're gonna drive that truck home and you know what about halfway through reality struck you and you jumped up and threw your old car keys in the air whatever they are and you said praise god i'm gonna leave this whole car behind i'm gonna get me a brand new truck amen somebody come over and say brother joel you're crazy man you ain't seen that truck it don't matter i heard the promise brother joel you can't shout like that you've never seen the title it don't matter i've done heard the promise listen amen i went in the unseen and saw the evidence and brought back a report do you realize i could read it to you amen but i don't want to put you to sleep by reading to you amen let me say it to you like this the prophet of god said reproach for the cause of his word he said abraham went into another dimension and saw the evidence oh god josiah he went in the other room and saw sarah hold the baby her milk ranger still dried up his body was still as good as dead no life in him 75 and 65 years old but he went into a realm [Music] he went into a real brother david and saw sarah holding the baby and he come back in this realm and the evidence stacked up against him greater and greater and greater and greater but it never changed [Music] it never changed his claim he claimed they were going to have a child he claimed sarah was going to hold a baby he claimed that sarah was going to nurse her own child come on he went there yeah come on come on he saw it come on now the problem of god said man always requires a confirmation or some sort of evidence [Music] do you realize the rest of town didn't see what abraham saw but that did not change the fact that abraham saw it brother ben the rest of the community didn't see it but it never changed abraham's testimony because he was there he saw it he saw sarah he saw the baby do you realize the product of god said this he said if you've got the title of a car it's the evidence of the car though you haven't even seen the car or the car be in the garage if you just get the evidence if you just get the promise if you just get the word he said you can have a deed to a piece of ground it's yours though you've never seen the ground though you don't even have it in your possession but you have the evidence of it abraham made a claim i'm still the bride's revival so stay with me abraham made a claim without one visible evidence now the prophet said a hundred years old the evidence got greater and greater and greater and piled up against him but he was looking at the unseen now let me say this i would like to present a case here this morning of the claim that we've heard for years we've heard it claimed for years that the seventh seal is open we've heard a claim for years now something i i i ain't gonna fight with you so don't don't go there i ain't fighting okay amen there's some that say this heaven seal is closed and the bottom line to me is when you see it open you can't even see the fact that it's open but i'd like to say this we've heard these claims from the message of the hour that remember what is a claim it's a set of facts but there's got to be evidence to put a backbone to those facts here are some of the claims we've heard we've heard that the bride is in possession of the seventh seal revelation we have heard we ain't looking for revival we found it we have heard that the revelation of god has been brought to us by the hand of vindication we have heard that the time is at hand to unseal what has been sealed we have heard that the seventh seal is an absolute secret until the seventh angel begins to sound we have heard everybody would die unless a prophet would come with the word and understand what was sealed we have heard we are not looking for the answer we have the answer we have heard the seventh seal it's not a learning it is a life we have heard the mysteries of this message will have a voice we have heard the seventh seal is christ coming in the church we have heard the seventh seal is the coming of the lord we have heard that the rapture is not just coming the rapture is happening we have heard the third pull is here we have heard brother david that the shout of first thessalonians 4 is a message of malachi 4 amen together a bride for christ we have heard what is the attraction on the mountain what was prophecy is now history we have heard that the seventh seal brings christ back to earth again you say brethren that's a bunch of claims you're exactly right but i don't have to worry about it because i'm looking at the evidence of it this morning y'all just leave me alone i have a spell all by myself i'm not looking at a bunch of claims sister this morning you are the evidence that the word has been opened brother david you are the evidence that christ has come back in the church josiah you're a young man you're a young preacher god called you amen your evidence this morning brother allen your evidence this morning are you hearing me church amen brother danny your evidence this morning i don't know brother david why if you're watching god bless you buddy he was laying at this door the other day but you're sitting there with life and breath in your lungs you are evidence this morning that the seventh seal has brought christ [Applause] [Music] friends if i could break this down as best i know how this message is not a bunch of fussing and fighting what are you talking about i'll tell you like this brother dave can i share something with you i remember one time i was out preaching one time brother ben and i got preached a message on the open book brother harvey i study one day and heard a proud of god say this he said we now have the answer i think i might even preach that message here at this church on the open book he said we now have the answer and when i heard that i went to the place he said and we'll pass the test you realize the book's got to come open if it's an open book test the book's got to come open to get the answer out of the book if the book remains closed then there's no answer but when the book comes open it opens up the answer and what is the answer the answer is christ see the answer is christ now i said the church that's preaching with me on that open book they opened the word the power of god at your church your brother called me in the office the pastor he said well he said i want to have a talk with you i said okay what's new i said what and what i thought to myself you know what's new he said well brother andrew he said you've got to realize you ain't got no right to preach that seventh seal as an evangelist and you ain't got no right to preach that third pull and you ain't got no right to preach revelation 5 revelation 10 you ain't got he said you you young whippersnapper you probably ain't even read half of those quotes i said brother i've read your quotes he said well he said let me sit like this he said you have no right to declare and claim the seventh seal is open i said okay and you have no right to tell me that it's not open when i'm the evidence it is open come on sir amen just because it's close to you don't mean it's close to everybody just because it's confusing to you don't mean the rest of us are confused just because you let some man add interpretation and definition to what a prophet said doesn't mean the rest of us did come on church i'm going to close right here but there's some victory in the seventh seal there's some joy in the seventh seal there's some power in the seventh seal that's the 19th and the seventh seal this is not an education this is not a bunch of fussing and fighting and putting clothes together and who's right who's wrong this is the evidence that the son of man has revealed himself and there is a bride that's in a real true word revival [Music] brother me and i ain't looking for revival i'm in revival oh brother josiah ever since the day i heard a prophet say in what time is it search he said now is this that third pool are these them seven thunders is this which will bring the power of god back in the church again you know what he's done brother joe he give me a license to preach this message he said now you draw your conclusion you draw your conclusion and you know what i did brother harvey i went to the word and i drew my conclusion based on the word you know what the prophet said if the book is closed then there's no understanding but i'm not preaching to a bunch of confused people this morning if the book is closed there's no understanding there's no direction there's no vision but thank god this morning church that the book has come open in this generation we have seen his word we have seen his power we have seen his anointing we have seen his reality oh brother just cause you ain't in revival don't mean the rest of us ain't just cause you ain't got joy don't mean the rest of us ain't and you know what brother howard i've come to place i'm done apologizing for being who i am brother i've done i'm done apologizing for being who i am i believe this message i believe it's the evidence of the rapture i believe it's the evidence of the resurrection i believe william branham was a prophet i believe there was a first pool i believe there was a second pool but i believe there is a third pool and i believe there's a bride this morning that is walking in the footsteps of a prophet and she's walking with power and authority to bind the serpents whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven come on church do you see what this message did do you see what this seventh seal did it brought the power of god back in the church [Music] and when you see it brother ben come on when you see it you can't unsee it when you hear it you cannot hear it are you hearing me when you come in contact with it it changes on thank you lord it don't matter if the whole church is asleep if you hear your name you're going to stand up and say amen it don't matter if everybody around you is uninterested when you hear that word you're going to raise your hand and say that's for me see if something in you calls for revival that doesn't mean it's a church revival it's an individual revival to bring a revival to your heart are we in it brother ben do we see it are we in the bride's revival brother told me today he said well he said praise god brother mark it kind of kind of kind of made me a little comical guy that they told me said well praise the lord he said when mine and harris gets in he said the church will get on fire i said brother i was on fire when obama was in come on well berlander brother ben it was honest god's truth the woman told me back when hillary and trump was running she said oh if hillary gets in it'll put the church in action i said sister where you been the church has been in action it's ever since ever since revelation 10 7 begin to sin come on come on sir brother bride survival is going to come with andrew when persecution comes relevant said persecution he said natural persecution put israel in the homeland natural power put the church in the world council churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride what are you saying i'm saying just as jeremiah bought that property sealed the evidence in earthen vessels with a message that would open up those seven last seals of the bible that would restore the oneness of the godhead that would restore the truth on predestination that would restore the authority to the church that would have straightened out the evidence of the holy ghost that would be the very power to change our bodies he sent a message to open it a prophet to open it but those that evidence is not infused this morning that's right looks like y'all got rid of them pews if the evidence of this message was just an abuse and you got rid of your evidence of revival come on come on well preaching church one time the guy got all tore up he is all wadded up i said what's wrong with you he should bless god they got rid of the wooden benches and got padded cushions i said what's that got to do with it he said well kick the power of god out of the church i said well brother if your power only goes as far as it wouldn't be you need to find more than a wooden bench you need to find a wooden altar come on church god ain't sealing this evidence in sheetrock he's sealing it in earthen vessels do you realize who you are this morning caleb do you realize who you are you're not just a son and a father and a husband and a painter and an and a man in a church you're walking evidence that what has been sealed has been opened and has claimed the lives of human flesh do you love him this morning brother joe you're not just a church member you're not just a husband and a father and a son and a grandfather and an organ player and a church officer brother danny you're not just a deacon this morning brother ben you're not just a pastor brother josiah you're not just a young man with a with a ministry and a family you're living evidence [Music] you are the evidence this morning of the bride's revival how did i become it i began to eat the evidence and what i ate i become come on brother if all i do is eat donuts come on i'll be be quiet joel i'll become a donut if all i eat is is oh god it's fruit and vegetables and salads i'll become a a healthy person what you eat is what you'll become friends y'all forgive me this morning i got some slobber on my face but i've been eating them grapes y'all forgive all these people in here shouting hollering amen they've just been eating some grapes for the evidence this morning you love him as the musicians come thank you for the evidence this morning how many believes your evidence today thank you for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ i love this brother caleb but we have this treasure thank you lord we have this precious thing collected laid up a magazine we have this treasure in earthen vessels earthen clay with the added suggestion oh god a foretell of being fragile of being able to be broken god is so sure of you yeah that he deposited this evidence and you know there would be there would be the slightest bit of human frailty there but he still knew in this age he could lay these treasures in your heart and you would be a magazine y'all forgive me this morning i'm taking a little bit longer than i planned but brother ben told me to take my time so take it up with him you know what magazines are they're putting random places doctor's offices dentist offices there's an attraction to him when you see the attraction something causes you to pick it up look through it what is the attraction of hearty arkansas what is the attraction of wearing a live tabernacle can i tell you what it is yes it's the evidence of redemption has been sealed in earthen vessels again that's right there is a bride on the earth you say well if i get baptized the holy ghost then well maybe the lord will take me no not only that you're just getting ready to live you ain't ready to live till you get the holy ghost and then when you get the holy ghost then you're just fit to live you wasn't fit to live before that seed but now you're just fit to live live after you got the holy ghost see people say well i get ready to die oh my i'm getting ready to live the thing of it is get ready to live live in christ a victorious life over sin death and hell i already have the victory he's my victory i'm his evidence and i'm an evidence of his victory every believer sitting here this morning is an evidence of the victory of jesus christ won't you stand your feet with us this morning anybody tasted some grapes today they taste good releases something in you don't it thank you lord thank you you know what it does it makes you want more brother ben i've never drunk and i i say that think thankfully to the lord i've never been drunk so i don't know what it is to be drunk but i've heard that a drunk man don't like to be drunk if everybody else around him ain't drunk ain't no fun to be the only drunk one come on maybe some of y'all maybe some people are struck or something you know before you before you got saved but that's what i've heard you know what ever since i got drunk on the evidence of this message it set a fire in my soul that i want every individual i preached to to be drunk on the fervor of this message to be drunk on the inspiration that it's poured out to be drunk on the transforming power of the words of a prophet of god you love him this morning oh my victory this morning to the blood of jesus christ with the evidence of his resurrection when you see it when you see it you can't unsee it when you hear it you can't un hear it see brother hardy that's the problem there's some preachers around this message that seen the opening of the word they've seen the son of man revealed they've seen the lamb take the book they've seen the prophet say maybe i'm just feeling this way and this is just a sublime act but let me call the lamb to come and claim his bride thank the lord they've seen the evidence of what a drop of bleach will do to a life of an individual and they can't unsee it they can't unsee it they may go through a lot of trials and there may be a lot of hard times but when they come out of it they've still seen the evidence of the land oh god this is coming hot off the press so you're just going to get it as it's coming okay come on what you've been through it's not enough to take the evidence out of your heart that this message is still the truth i'm getting ready put another door in this church where do you want it come everything you've been through it's not enough to destroy the evidence that god opened up through a prophet and sealed in your earth and vessels you'll come out on the other side as a witness i just feel to share this if it's okay a few years ago well probably last year year before last sometime we was out at byc at the youth camp there and we left there and when we left the youth camp we was going to canada to preach them eating up their brother uh brother john simon's church well brother brother seth martin brother isaac hatfield they went along with us and we got up there and the end of the meeting was ready to come home and they thought well you know what we'll go over and see the see the niagara falls brothers isaac had never seen it so if you know me i'm the type when the meeting's over the car's ready we're going home you know let's go home so i really wasn't wanting to go to be honest with you but i thought well you know what i'm not the only one on the trip so we'll you know we'll go so on the way over there i said now is anybody know how to get there where to go and that brother brother brother seth he said i know how to get there so he took off drive and i'm like wait a minute where are you going he's like oh i know how to get there so he went this way and went that way and the whole way i'm over sitting now what in the world are you doing where are you taking us where are we going and brother josiah we just about got there and brother seth spoke up and he said oh i've been here before he said when that pastor to pennsylvania we come up here and salt the niagara falls and he said i remember how to get there he said that was seven or eight years ago he said but but i still i still remember how to get there he said there's been some things changed around he said well he said this is different that's different you know but but the amazing thing about it was a lot of things had changed around it but the main attraction of what was drawing people to that area was still the same the niagara falls was why people was coming to that part of canada they weren't coming to see the parking lot they weren't coming to see the the signs they were coming to see the attraction and let me say this there's been a lot change around this message and if god terry's just coming 20 more years there'll be a lot more change but let me just tell you this the attraction will never change and the message of the hour is the attraction [Music] oh can't you see oh why i'm so happy [Music] oh i've accepted the word i've accepted the opening of the word the revealed word that was oh oh don't you love him oh can't you see [Music] what eve turned down you've accepted glory the sealed word that was [Music] friends we're gonna be there we're gonna make it [Music] we're eating on the evidence we're living by the evidence of the new land what's keeping us going brother harvey what's putting strength in our bodies the outward man is perishing day by day but the inward man is being renewed what's doing that the evidence those grapes that new wine that stimulation of revelation those golden nuggets those handfuls of purpose how many terms did he call it but brother allen it's all pointing to that new land oh the unsealed word that was full it's not sealed this morning it's unsealed it's revealed [Music] one more time with all of our hearts oh can't you see why i'm so happy oh i've accepted [Music] the unsealed the revelation the power of god the manifestation [Music] it's unsealed it's vindicated word it's identified word spoken word creative word by the prophet [Music] you know the other day out there in those meetings brother on the nights but the wayne was speaking he got talked about them squirrels being created something about how the brotherhood spoke and said let them squirrels be and he said he he actually killed him like abraham saw the ram blood came out of it he said blood came out of them squirrels now i just be honest with you my brother wayne was preaching i was sitting there and i just i just jumped up on my feet and it's all i could do to keep church order i was about ready to come unglued and just start screaming but you know why where the harvey i was wanting to scream it's because there's a deacon in our church who used to go to brother charlie cox's church and charlie cox gave this brother the table that brother branham brought them squirrels in and lay them on it's at his house he took me in there and showed me he said andrew brother charlie told me this is where brother brown said and this is where he laid them squirrels and this is where he got him and brother harvey is all i could do to keep my to keep my composure i was wanting to jump up and scream he's got the table they was laid on he's got the evidence where the squirrels was put but you know what he meant if that table falls away if that table falls apart or burns up in a fire the evidence of that word is not just on a table it's an earthen vessels there's walk and living evidence you believe it this morning just before we turn the service over let's sing that song we'll understand it better by and by how many agrees this morning i understand a lot more through this message than i did before i heard this message but there's more things we'll understand on the other side let's sing it this morning every hand not understand all the ways that god would lead us to that blessed promised land but he'll guide us with his we'll follow till we die and we'll understand it better bye [Music] when the morning comes when all the saints of god are gathering home we will tell the story how we overcome and we'll understand it better by and by we are often tossed and driven on the restless sea of time somber skies and howling tempest off succeed the bright sunlight perfect day when the mists have rolled away [Music] when all [Music] by and we cannot understand all the ways that but we're eating the evidence of it [Music] [Music] in the morning comes when all the saints of god are gathering home we will tell the story of how we overcome and we'll understand it better by [Music] old trials dark on every hand not understand all the ways that god would lead us to that blessed promised land but we're eating he's guided us by the food we eat we're going there understand it better bye we will tell the story [Music] [Music] lord when the morning [Music] we'll understand it one more time i know you can't shake hands but just turn around and wave at somebody just wave at him say i'll see you there we'll be there for the men will be there we'll talk about these means brother david we'll shout down the streets of gold we'll eat the fruit of the [Music] all glory sing it real loud [Music] give the lord a handclap of praise praise him this morning church praise him for his mercy praise him for his grace do you love him this morning oh my thank you just forgive me i've been drinking again i've been eating him grapes this morning you love him this morning let's buy our hearts together i don't know what you're going through today church or maybe your family or your something on your job or i don't know but i know this one thing you're here for a purpose you're here to be living evidence this message is the truth the holy ghost is back in the church [Music] i pray this morning what we said was was a blessing and a help to you you give me grace i know there's there's so many different channels and aspects to cover the seventh seal from but just having one one meeting here this morning i just took some things on my heart i pray you can see this is not an education this is not a learning or a theology this is a living breath of inspiration from the word of almighty god the prophet of god said the word is inspired he said but what we need is a breath of inspiration to breathe over the church how many can say today god breathe your breath of inspiration over my life inspire me near god inspire me to walk in the power of this message inspire me dear god to quit feeding on all the troubles all the problems all the situations all the negativity help me lord help me to feed on the vindicated evidence of that new land that you've opened under the seventh angels message god bless you sis god bless you there god bless you there god bless you god bless you back there brother hands up different places god bless you are you weak today let god give you some strength from the evidence of this new land are you caleb here today caleb was the type of the believer that stayed with joshua are you going to stay with joshua are you going to stay with this message today let it lead you there heavenly father lord we love you today dear god lord i pray something has been said to help your people here i pray something has been said to encourage them lord to let them see who they are to let them see what you've done in this hour to let them see what you've revealed to let them see that this bride is not looking for revival she's not trying to work up revival she's not trying to make revival she is revival she is religious awakening she is spiritual fervor she is an atmosphere she is the word made flesh father you've seen the hands it was raised here today you see behind those hands or knees behind those hands are situations but lord i believe behind those hands are caleb's i believe there's believers there that is feeding not on definitions on opinions but on vindicated facts and that word hallelujah glory that word is releasing a perseverance in them that word is releasing a zeal it's releasing a drive it's releasing a push it's releasing releasing an overcomer on the inside of that individual strengthen the believers here today i pray father i pray nothing has been said to hurt but to help lord may they take this messages lord may they take what your prophet has declared and may they feed on it and may they come in the image of the word of this hour hallelujah oh could you just slip your hands up dream for just a moment and say lord lord help me transform me change me dear god lord i don't just want to sit and listen to tapes i want to become what i'm hearing lord i don't want to just sit and listen to sermons lord i don't just want to come to church

possible lord will you help me oh help us today lord all those satan rages god bless you this morning friends god bless you today don't ever stop feeding on the evidence of this message god bless you
