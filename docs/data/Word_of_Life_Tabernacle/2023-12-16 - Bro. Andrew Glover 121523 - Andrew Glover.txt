us but there's more than two or three so that's a promise tonight that he's in our midst amen and maybe we just buy our hearts together tonight for a word of prayer before we open the word tonight

have gathered here on this Friday evening Lord father the end of another week Lord and father to the world it's a day of pleasure it's a day of relaxation in the evening father Lord people have worked

amen amen and amen God bless you this evening we want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it sure is an honor and a privilege to be here with you all tonight on this uh Friday evening to have this time to Amen to get together in Fellowship around the word and amen I was just thinking today at un unusual uh time or unexpected time but the prophet of God said you know he preached a message one time on the unchangeable god working in an unexpected way and he said now it may be an unexpected time an unexpected place and he said but God will move there he said but how much more will he move for those who's expected him so you know I know it may be unexpected on a Friday night to be in church but here we are and amen I believe the Lord has something for us tonight and amen we want to say God bless you all sure good to see everyone out that could make it tonight and amen sure appreciate brother ver and sister Dee for coming up amen they their family to us so we sure appreciate them for making the effort to come and the different vistors the Shamel God bless you all and I'm going to leave somebody out sure's the world brother uh Daniel my buddy from North Carolina come all the way to Arkansas just to see me so no I'm just kidding but sure good to have him here tonight we sure appreciate brother Daniel and his family and amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go to the book of Acts the 20th chapter the book of Acts the 20th chapter and um amen we sure appreciate brother Ben in the church here and the he was tell me the other day he said uh we hadn't heard you speak to us since the meeting so it's good to get to swing by and see you all once again and amen I believe the Lord's doing some wonderful things in the age we're living amen amen the book of Acts the 20th chapter and the 25th verse uh Paul here writing he says and now behold I know that ye all among whom I've gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more wherefore I take you to record this day that I I am pure from the blood of all men for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God now I love this because it's Paul's farewell words if we could say it that way and he's addressing the church and in the 20th verse he said take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this that after my departing shall Grievious wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock watch verse 30 and also of your own selves shall men arise so he's actually going to break it down more clear and show us that they're not coming from the outside but they're going to arise from the inside speaking perverse things now here's why they're doing this to draw away disciples after them now therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I have not seen cease to warn I cease not rather to warn everyone night and day with tears and now Brethren I commend you to God and to the word of his grace now watch this which is able to build you up not tear you down but Build You Up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments tonight to just share a few things with you and if I would uh title this tonight I want to speak to you for just a few moments here Amen on declaring the message with Liberty amen declaring the message with Liberty you know I've been in a bit of a a series of thoughts and study on this scripture here in the book of Acts the 20th chapter and also looking a lot at the the prophet of God's teaching Amen on the term in the middle of the road and you know Isaiah 35 actually gives us a very beautiful scripture he says that there would be a Highway and then he said there would be a way so there would be a highway and it there would be a way and it would be called the way of Holiness now in Matthew 7 and verse 14 and 15 you will find that there's actually two ways so there's the there's the Broadway and that way leadth under destruction amen but then there is the narrow way and that is the path that leadth unto life amen and I I find it very amazing that we're living in a time where it seems to be such a uh such a confusion or such an age where people are always saying well you know we've got to find the middle of the road or we got to find the balance and you know I I actually believe that I believe that it is essential amen as Believers to find the balance in all things I don't believe it's just essential Amen to find it in one area of the message but I believe it's essential to find it in all areas of our life amen because I believe that the message of the hour came to an unbalanced church amen to put them into a scriptural balance now you remember per brother Perry green says it many times said brother Bram told him brother Perry you always keep your balance where in the scripture see because he was not bringing something apart from the word but rather he was bringing something in the word to the church to make the word bride now when you look at Webster's definition of balance he said it is a condition in which different elements are equal amen or in the correct proportions it is the stability of one's mind amen or feelings to keep or put something Amen in a steady position so that it does not fall so amen a balance is coming to put the church into a steady position amen so that it does not fall now when you start looking at balance brother Bram will actually take it to the prescription and he says now if you go to the doctor and the doctor writes your prescription he said you take it down to a druggist he said what the druggist is going to do is he's going to mix the prescription right he said he's going to put enough antidote in there he said to to kill the germ or to balance the poison he said then he's going to put enough poison there there Amen to balance out the antidote he said now see amen if you put too much antidote then the Poison's not going to work and if you put too much poison then the antidote is not going to work he said so if you take it to a quack druggist you're automatically amen going to be out of balance he said but then we turn it to the church and he said God has given the church an original and eternal prescription amen and that is the book of Acts the 2 chapter where he said repent and be baptized every one of you and he said now if you take that to a quack Seminary he said they're going to mess it up and they're going to add and they're going to take away from it amen but if you take it to the one who wrote it amen then he's going to administer it to you the way that he wrote it and you know amen I as I said already I believe that God has sent us in this age amen a balanced message we do not have to balance this message amen I believe it's already balanced because when a Prophet come on the scene amen he announced that his ministry was coming to two classes of people right he said one was the fundamental he said and the other was the Pentecostal now if you start studying that you'll see that he called the fundamentals a little cold and a little starchy amen then he said the Pentecostal are so fanatic amen you can't teach them nothing he said but see if you could ever bring the two together he said then you would have the most powerful church amen that you've ever had now I'll just say it like this amen the way that they were looked at amen was the fundamentals was looked at as the high class right amen they were the ones that if they wanted to bring the mayor to the church didn't have to worry about somebody breaking out in tongues or shouting or dancing amen then you go theend Pentecostals and they were known as the ones on the other side of the track and they were the Fanatics and the poor people so they were considered the low class amen but what I love about this is God sent a prophet to the church amen and he said what I'm doing is pulling from both sides amen so he was pulling from the high class as well as the low class amen and he was making one class and that was the middle class amen which would be the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe tonight amen that we are not amen out of balance with this message I believe that we are in the balance amen that a prophet has established in the age we're living now he said that brother BR said it very beautiful he said what he done there was that way of Holiness he called it the middle of the road right and he said what will happen amen is you will build a road now when you build a road brother said the highest part is in the center he said now why they build it that way is because it lets all the trash amen be washed off for the middle of the road now I know I love this because it's very beautiful something that I found amen is when you build the road the highest part is in the center and Brother David what that does is that that puts everybody out of a job amen of being on trash control in the middle of the road so what they do is they want to be the ones to determine well this is trash and this is trash amen but the beautiful thing about it is God ordained for the rain to fall amen and when the rain comes the rain will wash all the trash amen out of the middle of the road see amen and the prophet said because the true message amen is laying in the center of the road amen he said the angel of the Lord is in the center of the Rob now this is where I want to preach to you for a little bit he said and as I the prophet amen I'm saying it that way he said I always preach the middle of the Roe so there was never one time that a prophet amen was preaching from a ditch amen but he was preaching in the middle of the road because he was pulling amen from both sides to produce an invincible Army now you know that we have been born again right amen we we believe in the new birth and the prophet said amen that when somebody gets born again he said they are set right in the middle of the road amen so Church your new birth did not put you in a ditch amen when you got born again you were automatically positionally placed Amen in the middle of the road with your eyes on Christ he said but finally they get over here and get so much knowledge and wisdom till they all they know and you don't know nothing see and if you don't do that then you run off on the other side with a bunch of wildfire and fanaticism amen but right in the middle of the road amen there is a true sound unadulterated gospel amen and power of God right down through there amen taking the Kings and the monarchs where anybody can stand and they can search and they can see that it's the power of almighty God Amen it's not a fanaticism amen and neither is it a formality it is the power amen of God we are not following fanaticism we're not following formality amen We are following the power of God another place he said friends I've always tried to keep a balance of the road he said you get way off on formalism just as formal as your ritualistic as can be he said and people grab for that but then if you don't watch you'll get pum over on the other side and be just as fanatic as you can be amen but there is a middle of the road amen where the true sound San gospel is preached amen and God moves in there vindicating the truth straight is the gate and narrow is the way amen and few there will be that'll find it amen you know what I love about this is man does not have to vindicate it's the truth amen but God moves into the church amen and God by his Sovereign power amen will vindicate what is happening is either of him amen or it's not he said the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough Spirit In You Amen to keep you warm and moving amen amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit to move just as the spirit moves amen not till or not after amen but just as the spirit moves amen I believe it tonight friends I believe that every one of us amen have been called to be a part amen of the kingdom of almighty God do you agree with me we've been called to be a part of the kingdom of God now I'll say it like this many times we get in our minds amen I got to have something you know I got to find something I got to be something I I got to do something to really be amen what God called me to be but I find it amazing amen that the only thing that we really need Amen to be what God has called us to to be is Liberty amen that's the only thing we really need amen is Liberty now you all know Paul says Amen in 2 Corinthians 3:17 he said now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is not where the spirit of the Lord was or where the spirit of the Lord will be amen but where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and when you look at that word Liberty it is the license Amen to do as one pleases amen true Liberty is living as we ought to amen and not as we please amen Liberty to do or to Omit things that have no relationship to Salvation amen I believe that God sent the message of the hour amen and the message of the hour has omitted amen things that had nothing to do amen with the salvation of your soul or a true relationship between you and God can I just put it in in country boy terms in other words the message of the hour has omitted all the nonsense amen there's no com and put your name on the road there's no come and join this or memorize this or follow this amen but this message has brought a liberty of the grace of God and to the church amen to manifest the nature of Jesus Christ I love what the prophet said he said not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship an organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied brother Brandon what is that one thing amen that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men wherein men become New Creations in Christ and they are filled with his spirit amen now let's not stop there let's read the rest of it and they live according to his word amen so the message he was bringing amen was not just a baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but it was was the adoption of the church it was the positionally plac of the sons where we would not just be baptized with the Holy Ghost but we would get up from the baptism and we would live according to the word now we got to identify this source of Liberty right amen the source of Liberty comes from the spirit I'll say it like this that's why you cannot take our Liberty and that's why you cannot give us Liberty amen because you're not the source of Liberty amen a church is not the source of Liberty a preacher is not the source of Liberty amen the message of the hour is our Liberty I said as plain as I know how the message of the hour is our license amen y'all know what you need to drive you need a driver's license I know people get in their mind well if I just got keys I'll be okay amen but go tell the police officer that when he pulls you over amen if you don't have a license you're headed for the jail house amen and listen friends we've had a lot of people amen trying to live without a license amen they've tried to live on this man's idea and this experience amen but why don't you come tonight and take the word test amen and when you pass the word test he will give you the license Amen to be what he called you to be and he didn't call you to be something great for leot see he called you to be the Bride of Jesus Christ I love first John 1:1 he says that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life he said for the life was manifested and we have seen it and we bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now listen at verse three he says that which we have seen and heard amen declare we unto you somebody say seen heard declare what we've seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ now look at this word seen it means to see with the eyes it means to see with the mind it means to perceive amen the word gives prominence to the Discerning mind so when one see something brother brother Danny they are perceiving it with her mind but then John said we didn't just see the life amen but we heard the life and that word heard means not to be death it means to consider what is or has been said it means to understand or to perceive the sense of what is said I love this one to perceive by the ear what is announced in one's presence amen so when something is announced in your presence he said there will be an ear to hear the announcement of what's happening in your midst and then he said to give ear to a teaching or a teacher so John said we've seen it brother Ben we've heard it but then he says amen we got to declare it so it's not just enough to see it it's not just enough to hear it amen but somebody's going to declare it and that word declar means to bring Tidings Amen to bring a word to bring a report to Proclaim to make known openly Amen to declare listen he said these things right we unto you that your joy may be full yes now amen this is is it okay to have church and then then in the fifth verse he says it very beautiful he says this then is the message I love that brother Dell this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is like and in him is no Darkness at all so the message that we're hearing is not a message of Darkness it's not a message of confusion it's not a message of tradition but the message that we are hearing is a declaration of the life of God that was in God in the beginning has now been manifested in the bride and she is not a daughter of Darkness she is a daughter of light amen I love that word message it means announcement it means a promise or the act of promising it is a promise given or to be given it is a promise good or blessing so when we read that word message we could very easily say this is the announcement amen this is the blessing this is the promise amen this is the act that God has bless this generation with listen friends he said father what we need tonight is Mercy he said for Liberty of spirit that we might be able to bring to the people amen the gospel truth of what we believe to be the meage message of the hour for your church brother Brandon was not asking for membership he was not asking for money he was not asking for popularity he said the only thing I need Amen to deliver this message is some Liberty Amen to tell you what the message is to tell you who God is to tell you what you've been called to do amen I believe it church I believe we have seen the message I believe we have heard the message amen but I believe th more than ever it's time to declare the message amen I believe it I believe what I Isaiah said he said Isaiah 48:6 he said thou H has heard and see all this and will not ye declare it I have showed thee new things from this time listen at these words even hidden things and thou didst not know them so we're not looking at things amen that have been laying in plain sight for years amen we've been looking at things that have been hidden amen but now they've been uncovered in Deuteronomy 29:29 I love what the Bible says the Bible says the secret things amen belong unto the Lord Our God Amen but the things which are revealed the secret things amen they belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed they belong unto us and to our children amen that we may do all the words of this law in other words things that have been sealed in this generation would be unsealed things that had been hidden in this generation would be unveiled they would be revealed and they would not be put in plain view Amen to argue about or to debate about amen but they would be put in plain view because they are your possession listen friends if it's still a secret it belongs to the Lord but if it's been revealed Brother David it belongs to his children and I happen to be one of them tongue talking acts 238 young that the word has produced in this generation and everything that is a part of my inheritance I refuse to back up I refuse to lay down I refuse to let some devil amen pack my inheritance out into a field somewhere I'm going to stand on this message and declare I have been given an inheritance among them which are Sanctified and the way I got this inheritance was the life that was in God was the same life he poured into Jesus and the same life he poured into Jesus he is poured into this bride and we are here living manifested life my things don't belong to the world they belong to us now the prophet said it very beautiful he said the Book of Revelation has more symbols in it than all the rest of the books in the Bible it has more symbols because it is a book of Prophecy amen now we're moving somewhere amen it's a prophetic book therefore it has to be understood by a prophetic class so it will not be understood by the high class fundamentals and it'll not be interpreted by the low class Pentecostals amen but there will be a middle class that'll be pulled from the high class they'll be pulled from the low class and they will be positionally placed in the middle of the road under the angel of the Lord and the tutorship of the Holy Ghost and the things which the father has revealed he will give unto the children and they will live by those things they will feed upon those things they will Feast upon them listen friends without this message we're starving without this message we might as well be at a ball game tonight amen but thank God he sent a message and he put us in a position where we would not be under a fanaticism we would not be bound under formality but we would be in a feast well glory to God I love what the prophet said he said some people make the gospel a Frolic he said then some people make it a funeral procession he said but it's not a Frolic he said and neither is it a funeral procession he said it's a feast and we used to sing a song Amen come on over here where the table is spread and the Feast of the Lord is going on listen church amen you're not going to a funeral you're not going to a Frolic you're going to a seven course meal where everything that God has revealed is to be revealed and it's on the table for you to eat it's not a Frolic it's not a funeral procession the gospel is a feast see and you are the prophetic class so this book is not meant for everybody there's nobody can understand it hardly now listen this book is made for a certain class of people he refers to Deuteronomy and he says the carnal mind cannot comprehend them great things of the scripture because it's foolish to them but to the ones who are lovers of the word of God how many lovers of the word of God but to the ones who are the lovers of the word of God that's who the book was written to to the church see the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church at Ephesus to the Church of samna to the church here see the revelation of Jesus Christ to the church can we say this together revealed things belong to us amen the revealed things belong to us I love this sermon 1962 from that time you all heard me preach this quote many times but I don't want to pull a word out of it brother B said my Ministry is different from a pastor or a teacher he says I'm not and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to amen but this is my Ministry see it's to declare him that he's here so the prophet's Ministry was to declare him Jesus Christ not that he was coming or he's been here but to declare that he is here he comes an anointed ones at the end time paragraph 262 and says notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message amen 1962 his message is to declare him he's here 1965 when he begins to declare his message see the first pull is healing the second pull is prophesying amen but the third pull is the opening of the word amen the mysteres revealed there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember somebody say remember the third pull was the opening of them Seven Seals Amen to reveal the hidden truth that had been sealed in the word what was a messenger coming for he was bringing a message that the people might have a true spiritual relationship where men might be new creatures in Christ be filled with his spirit and live according to his word don't you get mad at me but William bram's message was not just the bringing of the restoration of the gifts it was not just the bringing of the Pentecostal message he was a Moses but he was also a Joshua he was a Moses bringing them in but he was a Joshua who was positionally placing them in the inherit of the message of there listen Church don't you let some devil tell you that you don't have rights in this message don't you let some devil tell you you don't have rights in the third pole that's where your rights are laying is under the third pole now God has a provided way for everything right and God's provided way to declare his word is by prophet he said notice he wrote the Bible by his own chosen way he said and he chose the way his word came and the way by His prophets which which were predestinated and for ordained listen being a part of God's word amen declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time so a prophet comes on the scene to declare the revelation of the word at the age and the time that is to be declared in have not I sent thee 62 he said a modern day Prophet is a preacher so a real true Prophet points back to the word of the Lord the promise of the Lord not the Declaration the church has made so that's why brother Brandon was not accepted when he was not pointing at the Baptist declaration he was not pointing at the Methodist declaration he was not poined at the Catholic declaration he said he's sent here Amen to declare what God has made amen now how can he declare it unless he sees it and how can he see it and how can he declare it unless he hears it listen friends you are not feeding on the mind of a man you are feeding on the unfailing body word of of the son of man what is on those tapes it did not come from Bob Jones University it did not come from Oral Roberts University what is on those tapes come directly from the back part of God's Mind through his chosen Channel a prophet of God and we are feeding on the unveiling of God we are feeding on the revelation we are feeding on the promises and they didn't come from a system they came from the Eternal part of God's mind I love this friends the God says in 1951 he said expectation now I stand Here somebody say stand here he says I stand Here declaring the creator of Heaven and Earth is Jehovah God he said now I claim to be a representative of his in these days to bring a faith to his church first pull second pull bringing a faith to his church why to catch the attention of the elect to believe the unveiling of the things that belong unto them come on 1964 looking under Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God see we have a responsibility Church the prophet of God said everything is a responsibility he said now this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times amen they Sher a responsibility amen for standing for the true word of God when they are confronted with it they will sh that responsibility when the truth of the word of God is brought face to face with we human beings we are prone to Sher back until the last resource the message to leot in age 58 he said before the church can ever be taken to Glory it has to go through this world of criticism and sometimes we try to Sherk amen or pull back from criticism but let me say what a prophet said he said God forbid I ever Sher the job amen then what was the job the job was to to see the job was to hear but the job was also to declare listen I say thank God that brother bradam brother Ben was not a hling he was not a politician when he stood there in the Seven Seals and said now this will cost me thousands of friends it'll close many doors he could have very easily sh back and said I see it and I've heard it but I'm not going to declare it but he went to a pull pit because he met an Angel and the angel visit him seven days and revealed to him the mind of God concerning the seven end time Mysteries and he come to a pullit and said the white horse rider is the Antichrist he said the souls on the altar are those that were killed in those martyrum days he stood there and said the seventh seal is the ministry of Malachi 4 Revelation 10 you say preacher You're Fired Up amen how could you believe what I believe and not be excited about it these things belong to me they belong to our children they belong to our young people and I think it's time somebody take their gloves off and see and hear and declare what a prophet has said in the age we're living in now come on I believe in shout but I think sometime or another we ought to get back to preaching the message on come on church amen this message has got some substance it's got something to say don't you ever forget the third seal he said it's the stimulation by the Revelation he never said it was Revelation from stimulation he said if you get the Revelation the revelation will cause the stimulation not the stimulation calls the Revelation now y'all know that's the truth he said see God forbid I ever Sher the job listen acts 20:27 Paul says it very beautiful he says I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God I love that word shun it means to draw back it means to let down or to lower it means to withdraw it is of a timid person to withdraw oneself it is example to be timid to cover to shrink of those amen who from Timothy hesitate to avow what they believe listen to be unwilling to utter from Fear now listen to this Paul said I've not shunned I've not drawn back to declare unto you the counsil of God what is the counsel of God according to the Greek definition oh my the counsel of God is the purpose of God so Paul knew that nothing could defeat the purpose of God so that's why he stood there and said I know when I leave that Grievous wolves are going to rise among you and they're going to take these things and they're going to pervert them come on they're going to twist them and they're going to draw a group of seven Thunders and a group of return and a group of perusia and a group of this and a group of that well come on church amen Paul told us these things were going to happen now don't y'all get mad at me amen amen but God but listen amen a lot of the false doctrines around this message were not started by Baptist preachers there wasn't some Pentecostal Guy come out of the the UPC Church and twisted the seven Thunders or Twisted a tent or Twisted the presence of God Amen but men arose right among us but the problem was amen they were not taught by the spirit they were not taught by the scripture they had a motive and an objective but I say thank God in the last days that God has fulfilled his word and he's raised up a true pure Ministry that'll study the message and they will find the answer to the question in the message brother B said it very beautiful unto me if I don't declare this counsel of God the people of this healing power can I say this like a prophet said he's here and he's here Christ the son of God is here right now to heal the sick and the needy he said this divinely revealed by the Holy Spirit the same angel of God that directs me to see visions and so forth like that and the healing of the sick so when he changed from the first pull to the second pull the angel did not change it was the same angel in the first pool it was the same angel in the second pool it was the same angel in the third pool see because a prophet cannot change a let me say like this a prophet cannot change the word because he's God's mouthpiece to declare God's attitude and according to a Vindicated Prophet God never changes his attitude about his word he said I've done the best I know how Lord I haven't sh to declare the whole counsil of God feeling Lord and knowing if I'd be back at you from tonight many sitting here it's going to already be in eternity and I know cuz I see you Lord and I told I told them that you love them and you got the same respect for them that you did for the woman that night many years ago do you know what he's talking about he's talking about the worst sinner in the city which was the woman amen that washed jesus' feet and he said the saint oh God he said the same attitude that you had towards her is the same attitude that you've got here tonight towards every sick person listen I'm just going to take the gloves off and preach for a second amen I think we need to get back to giving our all to every service and not cherry picking Services well I'll give my all on Sunday morning and I won't come on Sunday night and I might come back on Wednesday amen I think this listen friends this could be the last service that some of us has ever in this could be the last sermon that some of us ever preach but I say oh God Amen Let us give you our all let us lay aside every ambition let us lay aside whatever motive and let us come back to where Christ will become the absolute and will give our all regardless of how we feel I know what I'm talking about cuz sometimes it's real easy to come to church and you don't feel like entering in and you don't feel like pulling and you don't feel like singing and you don't feel like preaching amen come on preachers let's be honest amen you don't feel like getting up preaching amen but you get up there because you got a commission you got a responsibility and it is to declare what God has on his mind for that service well listen friends I think if men of God will declare what is on God's mind I think we ought to have some people that'll be happy to receive what God is on his mind yes sir y'all know I'm telling the truth prophet of God said I've got to declare because some of you may be in eternity before I come back next year another place he said he cannot be a Healer once and not a Healer again listen brother Bram could never go to the pull pit and not have a prayer line cuz he didn't feel like it come on he did not have option to go the pit and say well you know tonight I just don't feel like really putting forth an effort he went there when he bleeding from his tonsils when he was hurting in his stomach when he was sick in his body he found his place because he was a prophet that was established in the middle of the road and he was not just showing us what to say he was not just preaching good sermons he was showing us how to act in the trials and the situation come on church amen I probably preached it to you here but I'm going to preach it to you again real quick amen a prophet of God went to a pull pit and preached a message called the comforter with his mother or rather let me back up preached a message called it is becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and his mother was laying up the road dying and a prophet was in a pull pit I know this might get touchy but he didn't play a tape and stay home he went to the pull pit and preached you know why because he was a prophet of God he wasn't a hling he was a prophet and he comes down the end of that sermon and he says Lord I don't know may be gone he said but you called me to stand here and to declare your word and he said if she's gone on then I'll meet her on the other side Brother David he walks home and she's laying there breathing her final breast but he didn't stay home on Sunday night but he come right back to the pull pit and he stood there and said when I left mama was still breathing but God put me here to preach a message listen I know things happen and we're not able to be at church amen but quit letting little old quit letting little old weak excuses is amen keep us out of the house of [Applause] God well it may get quiet here but I'll preach for a second amen I think some people's forgot 2020 I think they forgot when they laid in their rooms and cried like babies cuz they couldn't go to church I think well come on church I think some people's forgot what it was like when you didn't have the option to miss church when you felt like it because church was shut down I say oh God Amen restore The Passion of the word of God in the heart of the believer this is not a game this is a responsibility this is a message of the hour this is body changing power he said I've got to stand here and declare it when I don't feel like it I have to declare it I have to declare he's the same yesterday today and forever he's still got he never did declare he was the I was he declared he's the I am always he never declared I was I was I was I was or I will be I will be I will be brother Stewart every time he declared himself I am I am that I am I am the am I am that I am I am the one that was with Moses but I'm right here now I am the one that was representing the bread but I'm here in perfect realization I am the one that represented the water that come up out of the rock but here I am and I am that artisian well and if a man will drink of me he will never thirst again listen church I declare unto you tonight that the I am that I am is in this building present tonight and he's got the same attitude towards you he's got the same power for you that he had in the Bible days thank you Lord now I'm going to bring it on down because Paul writes to Timothy and says preach the word yes he says be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and Doctrine brother said to preach he said we ministers we have Ord from you preach the word see that's why they call us Full Gospel preachers is we preach the whole word we preach the whole word the whole counsel of God so a prophet did not bring a buffet to the pull pit right he did not bring a buffet and say well here's something you may like and if you don't like that no whenever he preached he was preaching the full word of God now let me say this our preach of the message and our believing of the message it must somebody say must it must be free from Prejudice right the way we preach the message must be free from Prejudice The Way We believe the message must be free from Prejudice listen I'll say it like Webster says very beautiful definition he says it means an adverse opinion or a leaning formed without just grounds or before sufficient knowledge and instant of such judgment or opinion it is an irrational attitude of hostility amen directed against an individual a group a race or their supposed characteristics amen so now y'all y'all going have to just just relax with me and preach for a second amen cuz some of y'all sit through them Prejudice sermons on come on Church you sat through them Prejudice sermons and you thought I remember one time I was in a meeting and the guy was up here preaching and man he was just blasting this guy I'm blasting this church and Blasting this move and I mean it would be one thing if the church was on fire but everybody's sitting there asleep you know Brother D about halfway through it I about stood up and just said anybody in here struggling with this can we move on y'all know what I'm talking about amen because they didn't study and so the only thing they do is hear some late gossip and go to the pull pit and try to correct this guy and correct that guy amen but whatever happened to just preaching the message whatever just happened to studying what a prophet said and not com to the pullit with an irrational attitude or hostility towards this guy whatever happened this coming and saying brother bradam said it Church let's put our lives on it the word of God is revealed the power of God is here I tell you what happened if some guys got big for the britches and they thought the message needed them rather than them needing the message but you're looking at one country preacher right here that's not ashamed to say Amen my this message don't need my Ministry but my Ministry must have this message if I don't have this message we're another sinking symbol and sounding brass but with this message we have the Vindicated thus sayith the Lord and we're not following every feeling that comes through the building come on church amen let's just get back to preaching the message without prejudice and let's get back to believing the message without prejudice let's just get back to where we didn't care who did what or who was preaching what we were just happy to be in the house of God just one more time Amen to sing again to pray again to shout again I know I'm pushing against that devil but I really don't care cuz it's the truth this is not a Prejudice message this is a message of Grace you know I'm telling the truth you said brander you better be careful why should I be careful when the prophet of God said that Jesus himself was accused of prejudice now you know why people get accused of prejudice brother said because see when he come among the Pharisees and the Sadducees he did not join with her group come on he did not join with her group brother said if he would have come among them and said now you Pharisees are wrong I'm a sadducee are you Sadducees are wrong I'm a Pharisee the Pharisees would say see I told you right amen but he didn't come to any of them come on church he stood between them he did not go to the fundamentals he did not go to the Pentecostals he did not go to the Sadducees he did not go to the Pharisees he walked on the scene and he stood between them in other words Brother David he stood in the middle of the road and declared that when you seen me you have seen the father you know why he couldn't join the F the the Pharisees it's cuz they wouldn't let him declare that I and the father are one you know why he didn't declare or didn't join the Sadducees is because they would not let him declare that I am that one I am the one that was prophesied so in order to declare who he was he had to stand in the middle of the road where there was some Liberty to say when you've seen me you've seen the father well come on Church y'all give me a little preaching room amen I can't join some group and this message I've got to stand in the middle of the road and say what a prophet said I got to stand there and say there'll be shouting and I got to stand there and say there'll be repenting I got to stand there and say there'll be gifts and I got to stand there and say there'll be word I got to stand there and say there's a bride age I got to stand there and say there's an adoption on the church I've got to stay in the middle of the road where I can have some Liberty to declare what I've seen and declare what I've heard y'all get mad at me but in order to believe it you got to stand there too come on church let me just go a and just knock that devil pump out of here this message ain't a click it ain't a social club it ain't a boys club this ain't the Boy Scouts this is the middle of the road where we preach the message we believe without fear we believe without favor we say what be revealed belongs to us hey you know it's the truth want me prove it to you get in the formal ditch and try to shout you can't do it they'll clamp you down get in the formal ditch and try to have an Altra call you can't do it they'll clamp you down okay get in the fanatical ditch and try to take a solid message of teaching you can't do it is this okay get in a formal ditch and try to op PR the gifts you can't do it get in the fanatical GI get in the fanatical ditch and say what a prophet said that the gifts ought to be in order come on it's still in the message come on let's say what a prophet said he said if prophecy comes forth he said it's not going to be a repetition of scriptures he said it's going to be a direct message and he said it's got to be judged now listen if I was in a group or I was in a ditch I would not have the Liberty to say that but because I'm not in a group and I'm not in a ditch I'm in in the middle of the road I'm not one bit afraid to preach Church order I'm not one bit afraid to preach amen that that which is perfect has come that which in part is done away I pray you're seeing my point anywhere outside of the middle of the road you lose your Liberty on yes sir anywhere outside of the middle of the road you lose your Liberty now you want me to keep on preaching amen amen get in a tape ditch and you can't preach get over in a tape ditch and you can't preach can't nobody preach for brother brandham everybody's wrong everybody misinterprets everybody's false everybody L people astray get over in a tape ditch and that's where you'll be then get over in a preaching ditch and everybody place a tape must be backslid and every Pastor that place a tape must be leaning this way amen get out of the ditch and get back in the middle of the road where the spirit of God can lead the church if the pastor feels like playing a tape bless God let him play the tape if he feels like preaching let him preach but just quit trying to tell us what to do when to do it how to do it woo GL I know you don't like it but I got Liberty and I really don't care get out of the ditch and get back in the middle of the road where there's a pillar of fire where the message is laying and you have Liberty you have Liberty to have church come on Church there's no liberty in a ditch now the problem of God said it very beautiful he said you're not blind people you're sensible people and if I stood here and said these things for prejudice I say it because it's life I say it because it's life I'm responsible to God for saying it and I must say it and my message all the time knowing back there under healing and so forth was just to catch the people's attention knowing somebody say knowing the message would come and here it is yeah all right we're no longer waiting for it brother Joe it's here we have the Seven Seals open the Mysteries are showing the things has happened listen when the Revelation broke are you hearing me can I have a few more minutes when the Revelation broke if a prophet was in a ditch he couldn't have declared it but because he was in the middle of the road he could not hold back because the pressure of responsibility of Amos 3 was upon him the line has roared who can help but prophesy do you see just as Jesus couldn't hold back you know why Jesus couldn't hold back because it was given to his disciples Amen to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven I know some people don't like this but let's just say what the prophet said God of this evil age 65 now in doing this I have come here for the purpose of teaching the last vows the last seven vows and the last seven trumpets and the last seven thunders of the Book of Revelation amen time them together in this hour that we're now living to follow the opening of The Seven Seals the seven Church ages but now I took the opportunity to express to the people my belief and faith in God and then bringing you to the hour that we're living in and by this somebody say by this he said it's not appointed to any certain person Creed whatever it might be it's just as I see God's word so a prophet went through it y'all y'all know what I'm talking about amen read a quote who's she pointing at all right come on well let me just say this I'm not going to lose my Liberty to read a quote and have have to stand there all night explaining why I read it all right come on come on church I'm going to read it and keep on preaching because a prophet said it I don't have to balance the quote the quote is balanced itself last Sunday we had a very fine out pouring the spirit upon the word it was very lengthy and I hated to stay that long but yet we didn't know what time we're going to meet for our last minute and I want to be rather as Paul said of old I've not sunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God he said Jesus said he kept nothing back from his disciples you know why because he was bringing them can I can I can I turn a corner here he was bringing them interpretation now the Bible says in second Peter 1:20 knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation you know what that word prophecy means it is a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purposes of God look at this word interpretation brother Joel the word interpretation is a loosening it's an un loosening I love this because private interpretation from the serpent evees interpreter binds the church amen but true interpretation from the spirit of Truth loosens the church come on you want me prove it to you by the Bible Eve's interpreter interpreted one word and put the whole human race in bondage but the spirit of Truth come and interpret the word and said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you know what I'm saying tonight friends I'm saying if we'll just preach this message we will cast out the devil we will cast out evees interpreter we will cast out Lucifer we will cast out private interpretations we will cast out bondage and we will make way for Liberty to come in the church again and loose somebody's heart and lose somebody's life listen friends if we're afraid to preach it nobody's going to get free well brother Andrew what are you saying I'm saying with a said he said the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil you know why the devil's cast out so you can believe now can I say this to you preaching is spiritual warfare but you know what we don't do we don't quit right we don't quit we don't quit your pastors don't quit the evangelists don't quit the ministry don't quit you know why because we are accompanied by Angels the Bible says we've come to mount Z to the city of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels can I say this to you the prophet of God said Angels appear in the end time all the prophets and the signpost point to this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did that for those little Junctions back there then what will he do now when all hell is turned loose amen can I preach my way out of this when all hell is turned loose he said all heaven will turn loose angels will appear signs and wonders on the Earth Earth see the counterfeits are rising but God is proven which is right and wrong don't you get bogged down in Prejudice trying to prove the counterfeits and trying to prove the truth amen just preach the message the counterfeits arising the Bible said is Janice and jambers withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith but they shall proceed no further for their their Folly shall be made manifest unto all men as theirs also was that is a Bible prophecy Brother David amen are you hearing me and the Bible said I'm going to I'm going to close on this point the Bible said as they wisted Moses in the last days they would reappear he says those Spirits again what just before the liberation of the people Oh Glory he said but Hallelujah The Liberation time is here well I want to tell Janice and jambers if you couldn't stop at days of Moses then you're not going to stop it now you know why Janice and jambers Rose up is they tried to stop the liberation of the seed of God but God overrode them and he delivered them just the same and I want to tell every Janice and jambers devil that rises up and tries to bind the church you didn't stop Moses and you won't stop this Third Exodus we're going to leave here hallelujah one of these mornings we're going to leave here sir the word is the truth sir the angels are here now can I just can I just say this to you the hour of Liberation is on us the hour of Liberation is on the church brother BR said beautifully he refers many time Stacks 2027 let me let me leave you with this last part of that definition of shund brother Ben it is to be unwilling to utter from Fear all right so you've seen something yeah and you've heard something and brother Danny it's time to declare it amen but a spirit of fear raises up and puts a pressure on you probably God said one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear Everybody's scared to death it's what's going to happen who what part four of Israel on the church the greatest thing I find against the church tonight is fear everybody scared to death about something what are you scared about all right if a man is born again he should be happy Carefree just like these fellows singing up here and the brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ can I give you another one after Jesus rose from the dead his words were constantly fear not he said that's what's the trouble with the church today is scared today you're scared to death you're going to make a failure how can you fail when you're in [Music] Christ how can you fail when you're in Christ you cannot fail you've got everlasting life all demons and Hell cannot shake you you got everlasting life so don't be scared of failure right 365 times in your Bible Jesus says these words or the scripture refers to these words be not afraid that's right fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind listen this love is a powerful force there's nothing more strong than love love will make you trust love has no fear love cast out fear one of the greatest things I find among them is fear and what makes fear is lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if if you love it Cast Away fear and that's the way God wants his church not so many as charter members he wants members that's loyal loves and believes and has confidence in him can I say this to you from Romans 8:15 you've not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB by father can I tell you what a prophet said Lord he died and he sent back the holy spirit and he said to the church take this and fight with it follow me the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions fear doubt and trembling can I say something to you you've got the the weapon yes amen that's right you've got the weapon what are you afraid of come on you're carrying the weapon oh that's good I'm going to tell on myself and I was a little boy my grandmother lived here and my great-grandparents lived across the road kind of kindy caty quarter so from my grandmother's porch you could look straight across and see my great grandparents so one night there was a big snow come in feel I mean the the it was biggest snow East Tennessee ever probably seen in my generation it was it it was horrible we didn't know how to act in that so we all piled up grandmother's house and they were making she made some cookies or bread or something well Nanny and Grande was across the road and so I got the right idea to sneak in there when nobody was watching get a pan of cookies and sneak out across the across the snow and get get out on the road well brother Danny I got about to the road and when I did there was a big I never forget there was a big Bronco like truck thing coming down the road and it had chains on it and it was like you know real real loud and it I mean it was completely dark outside the guy didn't even have his headlights on and he and now this was back when everybody was scared death kidnapping you know so that's when we were taught you know if you get caught you so I'm standing there and I see this truck and he stops right here in my right here at my grandmother's driveway and I'm just a little kid standing there and I'm looking up and the guy gets out and he's got all black on and he comes walking towards me and he says come over here to my truck well brother Joe I took off running back to the house I don't know where them cookies are something eat them he might have picked him up but I ran back in the house and I was just shaking I never forget my grandmother come over she said what's wrong with you I said there was a guy out there who tried to get me tried to get me I don't so so she's like well what did he look I said I don't know it was black it was dark I couldn't see nothing so from that time I'm telling this for a point and I'm closing so from that time every time I'd go hunting as a kid we we would I'm telling on myself we'd go before daylight and in my mind that guy was in those woods somewhere I never will forget it my uncle Matthew and I one of my uncles I can't remember exactly which one but we were walking in and I was always right on the TR you know right on their boo Hills you know just give me some room scared to death I never forget it one day I think it was my Uncle Andy he hands me the 270 rifle and we go walking in the woods and I'm following him and I'm on his Trail on his heels and I'm looking around and he stops he goes what are you doing I said I'm scared to death that guy might be here in the woods somewhere looked at me brother Ben he said these words he said you got a 27 rifle what are you afraid of you're carrying the weapon and you're acting like the defenseless one are you hearing me what are you afraid of come on church and I close by saying this you've got the message sir some of y'all ain't raising your hands no more cuz you're afraid of fanaticism what you afraid of you got the message some of y'all it's been a month of Sunday since you really got free in the spirit you know why because you're afraid of fanaticism come on church amen it's been years since some of y'all listened to the Seven Seals cuz some man taught something scary amen what are you afraid of you're the one carrying the weapon you're the one carrying the message quit letting that devil chase you around like a defenseless church member you've got the weapon of the word you can defend yourself you can stand with the word of God thank you Lord what are you afraid of I'm way off subject but I feel it here so I'm going to say it what are you afraid of come on there's churches right now won't preach the S Thunders CUA somebody perverted them 20 years ago what are you afraid of you've got the original tapes yes sir I know where I'm at brother Ben guys won't even read a quote where a prophet said I'll ride this again cuz somebody taught something weird about what are you afraid of I'm not talking to you you're a preacher you're helping me what are you afraid of you've got the original man's voice saying I'll ride this Trail again come on scared to death a gift might break out in the church what are you afraid of you've got the original thus sayith the Lord teacher not some man got thus sayith Lord you got the oral you got the man that put the church in order and the pitar of fire stood with him when he done it yes [Music] sir now I'm not going to read it to you I got to quit I got y'all are pulling now I got to quit but I want to say this the disciples was in a ship remember they were crossing the sea Jesus had went away to rest and a storm arose I got two minutes and a storm arose and the ship Brother David is tossed and the Bible says the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary wind wind where about oh Ephesians 4:14 carried about with every wind of Doctrine but in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went un them walking on the sea the water thou sawest is the thickness of the multitude the people and when the disciples saw and walking on the sea they were troubled listen they're already drowning the ship is falling apart and they're scared and they said it's a spirit and they cried out for fear they're they're sister sister they're going to the bottom they're they're on their way the ores are broke the Master's Fallen the helm is gone the the ship brother Stewart is falling apart it's filling up with water the ship is full of fear and here comes Jesus walking on the waters and they seem and they're more afraid of him than they are the ship that's falling apart they said now this is a spirit this is spooky but you know what Jesus said he looked at him and said these words he said be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid you know what he done he rebuked the fear by declaring his presence he rebuked for fear by declaring this is not our was I'm not I will be it is I it is the I am and I have come down to deliver you and the fear backed up prably God said today people are something on that order like they was in the days when the disciples on the ocean the night Storm come up there wasn't nothing all hopes was gone and they seen him come walking on the water now their ship was waterlogged and the sails was broke and the ores were gone they were holding one another screaming and they looked out there and seen him come walking on the water and was scared of him I'm after a devil right now and I'm going to get him and their only hope they were afraid of the only thing that could save them if that ain't a true picture again of today they thought it looked spooky you know they said it's fear it's a spirit but watch if you'll notice when they cried out when they cried out they Heard a Voice come back and the voice said fear not it is I Be not Afraid be of good courage Church of the Living God God can I preach to you right now brother Jeremy when he rebuked the fear he replaced it with courage when he rebuked the fear he replaced you with courage and the prophet said and if you'll just watch The Word of Promise for this day you'll hear the same voice speaking through the word it is me I promis to do this in the last days fear not don't be scared put your trust in me the Son of God who he is believe it now come on don't get mad at me but this message is walking through churches right now all right it's walking brother Ben through churches Brother David is walking through men's studies and they're looking at it and they're scared to go to a pull pit and just say what a prophet said it's walking through their studies and brother Danny they're afraid to go to a pull pit and preach a adoption come on Church they're afraid to go to a pull pit and preach what a prophet said because there's some pressure there's some fear well if I say it but can I say this fear is defeated fear is defeated and when fear Was Defeated strength stepped in and courage stepped in and they walked out oh glory to God they got some strength back what are you saying preacher I'm saying this message is coming right at you tonight this message is not me it's not brother Ben or any other preacher this message is Christ and he's walking do you know why it was spooky to them buddy because they were listening to the wrong interpretation Some Devil got in that ship and said that's a fortune teller that's Bey buub that's got the potential to turn into an a they Messenger right there but when he said it is I he broke every private interpretation he stopped the wind he calmed the storm thank you he rebuked the fear by declaring his presence let our musicians come tonight that's good what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying what the prophet God said the only thing can bring the church back together and take the Rapture they say it's fortune telling it's be elub another place but he said fear not it is I Be not Afraid now it is I be of good cheer could you could you all give me the the scripture of Acts 20 and verse 32 fear not it is I Be not Afraid now it is it's I be of good cheer be of good courage now he's the prophet of God acts 2032 the prophet of God is bringing Jesus Christ right in the building he's saying what he said to them that day he's saying it here right now what does that say and now Brethren I commend you to God and the whole word of his grace which is able to what Build You Up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified and a Vindicated Prophet brother Ben says if he was here tonight and he said I believe he is and he come walking on the people and he was addressing you here's what he would say brother Harvey he would say fear not it is high Be not Afraid Be not Afraid now it is high be of good cheer be of good courage build yourself up if it's me I've got my eye on you I'm watching you I'm coming into the midst of the assemblies into the midst of the Church of God I'm coming in here to do what to take out the elected not to make another organization but a Rapture to go home I'm coming for that and today it's the same thing they're afraid to take a hold of the Holy Spirit they're

brm say it come in my hotel room and brother BM said they looked at him and said he's spooky and my mind went back to sitting at a table with some message people and somebody spoke up and said you know we don't listen to them tapes cuz that voice is pretty spooky and I thought dear God literally sitting right there in my hotel room I went back 12 years to sitting in a restaurant and hearing a a so-called message person say the voice on those tapes are spooky and I thought I literally just about broke down right there the only thing that can help them and they're scared to death of it the only thing that can take them out of this confusion and they're scared to death of it but is there anybody here tonight ready to walk anybody say I'm ready to get out of the ship and walk on the water want you to stand your feet with us tonight what are you saying brother Andrew I'm saying it's not spooky it's a shalom it's not a spirit he's [Music] here I was thinking today brother brother hom

know Homer get away with it I can't he said first meeting I ever went to he said up there in Jeffersonville he said man we were just so happy you know God sent a prophet and there's a message and there's a Rapture coming he said man I thought he said I thought man I got out of the Baptist Church and the Catholic church and he said I'm over here in the message and he said everybody's normal you know he said that morning we got up at the Easter meetings and went out in the park I'm saying this for a reason said we went out in the parking lot of the hotel to go to the service and he said there was a guy standing there and he was in a suit and he was looking up in the sky about 5:00 in the morning brother Homer said I walked by him I said good morning sir he said this could be the day couldn't it he said what do you mean he said this could be the day those Skies part and brother Bram comes right down here on the street and preaches the seventh seal H said dear God there's been some spooky stuff yeah but it wasn't the message yeah that's right Christ is not spooky come on brother Andrew I'm I'm really battling this fear well can I tell you this you're not the first [Music] one you're not the first one you say I'm not the first one no what if I told you that a prophet of God battled fear to move into that third pool that's right right can me prove it to you in your seven seal book brother B says when I was up there in Sabino Canyon that sword come down he said you know I've always been scared of a sword scared of a sword he said I'm holding that sword he said and I'm looking at it and he said there's not a person within miles of me he said how did this get in my hand he said I remember that blast right he said I remember that blast he said now what I was afraid of was this was my death he was literally scared of it he said but then all of a sudden that voice come and said fear not it's only the Vindication of your ministry it's the third pull so the barrier of fear was trying to stop him from entering into his ministry but God rebuked the fear and revealed the sword of courage and he said now let me take this third pull let me take this sword in my hand and March forward to that third pull is there any Mighty Gentile Warriors here tonight said Lord let me take this weapon in my hand put it out in front of me brother Harvey and let me March into every
