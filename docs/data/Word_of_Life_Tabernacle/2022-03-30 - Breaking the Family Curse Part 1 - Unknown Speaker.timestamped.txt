[0:00] chapter 33 and verse 12
[0:02] my goodness if you had that as a
[0:04] prophecy about your life you know that's
[0:06] not very much is it
[0:08] it says you'll raven as a wolf and
[0:10] and devour the prey and and at night he
[0:12] shall divide the spoil
[0:14] but then there's another prophecy and
[0:16] this is moses
[0:17] prophesying over the children of israel
[0:19] and he said of benjamin
[0:21] he said the beloved of the lord shall
[0:22] dwell in safety by him
[0:25] and the lord shall cover him all the day
[0:28] long
[0:28] and he shall dwell
[0:30] between his shoulders what a difference
[0:33] in prophecies
[0:34] talking about the same tribe
[0:37] the same family of people
[0:39] but there's a complete difference from
[0:41] genesis to deuteronomy and so i want to
[0:43] look at that and maybe we'll take more
[0:44] than one service let's bow our heads
[0:46] together heavenly father we're so
[0:48] thankful to be here tonight on a
[0:50] wednesday night
[0:51] lord i pray that you just come and meet
[0:53] us here lord
[0:55] how we need your help we can't do it on
[0:57] our own we can't make it on our own we
[1:00] need you lord and so we pray that you
[1:02] would come and that you would just take
[1:04] over this service lord the thoughts that
[1:06] i had lord
[1:07] and i know maybe the people look at it
[1:09] and think where is he going but lord i i
[1:11] pray that you just help me lord to say
[1:14] the things you would have me to say and
[1:16] walk lord right right in the places i
[1:18] need to walk in and lord to stay away
[1:21] from the places i need to stay away from
[1:23] i pray lord that you'd help us we we
[1:25] want to be more like you we didn't come
[1:27] to church just to hear a man we come to
[1:29] hear the word of god and so we ask you
[1:31] to come express yourself by your word
[1:33] here tonight lord and we thank you for
[1:35] your presence that we've already felt
[1:37] you're in the service lord during the
[1:39] songs we pray you continue to be with us
[1:41] we pray and we ask it we pray especially
[1:43] for nathanael tonight lord that you heal
[1:46] his body lord when we think of these
[1:48] other needs i know there's many other
[1:49] needs and requests that have been made
[1:51] over the last few weeks i pray you bless
[1:53] them heal them lord bless them in every
[1:55] way we pray in jesus name amen amen god
[1:59] bless you you may be seated this evening
[2:06] whatever you are naturally
[2:08] today
[2:09] as a result of two things
[2:12] it's the nature passed to you from your
[2:14] parents
[2:16] and the environment or nurture that you
[2:18] were raised in but the random tells the
[2:20] story of a family that had five sons and
[2:25] their sons excuse me for speaking slowly
[2:27] i've got a little a bit of a problem
[2:29] with my voice tonight but
[2:31] he had five sons and they had five sons
[2:34] and there was a picture
[2:36] on their wall of a ship a sailing ship
[2:38] on a smooth sea
[2:40] and they found out that every one of
[2:42] these sons had a desire to go to the
[2:44] navy every one of them went into the
[2:46] navy or the marines
[2:48] and so they investigated and they found
[2:49] that that was the only thing in the
[2:51] family the only reason why
[2:53] was that they went to bed every night
[2:55] and woke up every morning looking at
[2:56] this picture of a navy ship and so it
[2:59] wasn't their genes necessarily their
[3:01] father their grandfather no one in their
[3:03] family had been a sailor but it was the
[3:05] environment that they were raised in
[3:07] that actually caused them to uh to want
[3:10] to sail a ship and so those things
[3:13] matter you know and if it matters just
[3:15] as an example
[3:16] just how a room is or what pictures are
[3:19] there then the things we see and
[3:22] especially the way we present ourselves
[3:24] in front of our children matters to our
[3:26] children and yet much of what we uh what
[3:29] we are also
[3:30] comes from our parents and and so if
[3:33] your parents are here tonight or or your
[3:36] parents are alive you can look back and
[3:38] you can say well
[3:39] i'm i'm a result of you guys and
[3:42] and so you can kind of blame some of
[3:44] that on them and yet it goes back even
[3:46] further than that because it goes back
[3:48] to your grandparents and your
[3:49] great-grandparents and your
[3:51] great-great-grandparents and goes all
[3:52] the way back to adam because ultimately
[3:55] the nature the sin nature that we have
[3:57] comes from adam all the way back
[4:00] right right and so now it's been passed
[4:03] on to us since the blood has been mixed
[4:05] up and all those things have happened
[4:07] and so now
[4:08] so now we're born into this world now it
[4:11] matters everything matters the place you
[4:13] were born the environment you were born
[4:14] in even the sign in the heavens that you
[4:17] were born under all of those things
[4:19] matter as to what you're going to be in
[4:20] life you're going to become something in
[4:22] life and danny ward becoming what he is
[4:25] today is a result of all the genes that
[4:27] have passed on the nature that he has
[4:30] and then also the way that he's been
[4:32] raised that's why you find such a
[4:33] difference many times in between
[4:35] siblings in between people because that
[4:37] gene will express itself in a different
[4:39] way and then many times they go
[4:41] different paths and so you find out
[4:43] later on in life that they took a very
[4:45] different road but maybe even had the
[4:47] same basic genes the same basic set
[4:51] of wants and desires but yet they took a
[4:53] completely different road why because
[4:55] something happened that they they took
[4:57] the narrow road as as the poet said and
[4:59] that made all the difference
[5:02] so the nature that we have comes from
[5:04] adam and in adam all
[5:07] die
[5:08] how many know that today
[5:10] there's no exceptions in adam all die
[5:14] right but in christ all are made alive
[5:17] the bible says but in adam all die and
[5:20] there's no remedy for this body of death
[5:23] outside of the blood of jesus christ
[5:25] which we know is the life of the blood
[5:27] the holy ghost the token that comes in
[5:29] and changes our lives first peter 1 23
[5:32] says being born again not of corruptible
[5:34] seed but of incorruptible by the word of
[5:37] god which liveth and abideth
[5:39] forever
[5:40] so now that is what it takes to change
[5:43] our lives
[5:45] right
[5:46] we don't treat sin with psychology
[5:50] right that's not a treatment for sin
[5:52] although psychologists can do many
[5:54] things as far as making someone feel
[5:56] better about themselves can talk them
[5:58] through things but that's not how we
[6:00] treat sin we don't treat sin by
[6:02] counseling it out of people
[6:04] right we treat sin
[6:06] with the new birth
[6:08] right and that takes care of the sin
[6:10] problem and yet you still have a body
[6:13] that has to be sanctified right and
[6:15] that's going to be going on for the rest
[6:16] of your life so now
[6:18] we do we do retain a sticky nature on
[6:20] the on the outside
[6:22] that we must constantly keep under guard
[6:24] and yield our members to christ in first
[6:25] corinthians 9 27 paul says i keep under
[6:29] my body the idea the picture that he's
[6:31] painting is of a boxer with his fist
[6:33] cocked and he's waiting he's waiting and
[6:35] standing over a another boxer that's
[6:38] gone down but he's wanting to make sure
[6:40] he's down for good
[6:41] and so he stands there and watches over
[6:43] it he's vigilant he doesn't leave so
[6:46] that he makes sure that he wins that's
[6:48] the way you and i have to be we've got
[6:49] to keep under our body bring it into
[6:51] subjection
[6:53] by any means he said when i preach to
[6:55] others myself should be a castaway that
[6:57] doesn't mean that he would lose his
[6:58] salvation it means he would be
[7:00] disapproved by god
[7:02] that he would not oh my i tell you what
[7:04] i don't want to be in and i'll get over
[7:06] there and realize that all my all my
[7:08] life's work had been thrown away and so
[7:10] so i you want to keep yourself right you
[7:12] want to keep under your body it's not
[7:14] just about making it into heaven but
[7:16] it's about bringing as many others in as
[7:18] we can as well
[7:20] so in second corinthians 10 and 5 he
[7:23] tells us how to do that he said cast
[7:24] down imaginations and we've talked about
[7:27] this many times but every high thing
[7:29] that exalts itself against the knowledge
[7:31] of god and bring into captivity every
[7:34] thought
[7:34] oh what a people we could be but caleb
[7:37] if we could take every thought that we
[7:39] think every thought of disappointment
[7:41] every thought of denial every thought of
[7:43] of unbelief and we could bring that into
[7:45] captivity and say the word says
[7:47] something different
[7:49] my thoughts may tell me that i'm not
[7:51] going to make it but the word says i am
[7:54] my thoughts may tell me that
[7:56] everything's going wrong but the word
[7:57] says
[7:58] that there's a bride without spot or
[8:00] wrinkle
[8:01] washed in the blood of the lamb so you
[8:03] bring every thought into captivity to
[8:05] the obedience of christ
[8:08] now brother branham taught us i'm laying
[8:10] a wide foundation here because i'm not
[8:12] going to finish this tonight and we'll
[8:13] get we'll get into it at a different
[8:16] date but brother branham taught that
[8:17] we're an outward man which is controlled
[8:19] by five senses and an inward man
[8:21] controlled by one sense which is faith
[8:24] and so there's actually five senses of
[8:26] the of the outside man and then there's
[8:28] five senses of the spirit the inside of
[8:30] that is a soul
[8:32] and so inside of that is is a sense that
[8:34] his faith
[8:35] branham teaches us that one is contrary
[8:37] to the other
[8:39] he said and as long as the five senses
[8:40] agree with faith wonderful but when the
[8:43] five senses disagree we should leave the
[8:45] five senses alone
[8:47] right and so that that nature that
[8:50] nurture that we are we should always
[8:52] agree with that inside man
[8:54] so and here he puts it this way he said
[8:56] now for instance jesus made a statement
[8:58] a promise
[8:59] the inside man says that's true
[9:02] what promise did he make to you he said
[9:04] your children would make it
[9:08] right and the inside man said it's true
[9:12] right it's just one example
[9:13] but many examples he said he said you
[9:16] can claim your children the inside man
[9:18] says that's true that's nothing but the
[9:19] truth but the outside man reasons that
[9:22] it can't be true to you
[9:24] yes sir right he said then ignore the
[9:26] outside man and accept the inside man
[9:30] he said now that's the same thing that
[9:32] paul is speaking of he was sold under
[9:34] under the law to carnal sin every one of
[9:37] us is the same
[9:39] he said that's the reason we have the
[9:41] troubles we do married four or five
[9:42] times and all kinds of sin and
[9:44] adulteries and everything else so long
[9:46] in our lives is because of those things
[9:49] that's because of the outside man we are
[9:51] carnal and that part must perish but
[9:53] then inside we hear a spirit man see
[9:56] your spirit man never did anything wrong
[9:59] as far as the soul is concerned you
[10:00] understand that that inner man he never
[10:03] did sin
[10:04] and he never will sin
[10:06] but you could mess up out here
[10:09] that inner man was born it would come
[10:11] from god it's going back to god yeah
[10:13] that's right
[10:15] hallelujah because we've been born again
[10:17] by the spirit of god he said we are
[10:18] carnal
[10:19] he said and that part must perish but
[10:21] then inside we're a spirit man soul
[10:23] inside he said that's faith in god's
[10:25] word he said then we bring our outside
[10:28] body under subjection to the word by
[10:30] faith
[10:31] by accepting what god said
[10:34] right god said i'm going to make it
[10:37] god said my children are going to make
[10:39] it going to be there you don't say how
[10:40] they'd be there you said that you could
[10:42] claim them
[10:43] right god said that god said i have my
[10:46] healing yes
[10:48] amen he said i'm saved
[10:50] i come by his provided way he said it
[10:53] and so no matter what the outside man
[10:55] says i agree with the inner man
[10:57] because the inner man agrees with god's
[10:59] word
[11:00] so now
[11:01] he said how can i take a cuckleber
[11:04] and make a grain of wheat out of it it's
[11:06] impossible for me to do it
[11:09] he said the only way it can be is
[11:11] because inside that cocklebur has been
[11:14] transmitted from a cockle bird to a germ
[11:17] called wheat life now notice on the
[11:19] inside
[11:21] it's been transmitted in the inside it's
[11:23] been changed
[11:25] you said then you bury that cocoa bird
[11:27] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[11:29] because there's been a life of wheat put
[11:31] in the kuckleberg
[11:33] amen
[11:34] amen and the life of the kuckleberg has
[11:36] been taken out
[11:38] but the nature of the kuckleberg is
[11:40] still sticky
[11:42] and it will be until this new life has
[11:44] fully been developed out of the ground
[11:47] and raised up again
[11:49] so there will come a day but joe no more
[11:51] sticky nature
[11:52] there will come a day we don't have to
[11:54] worry about hurting nobody's feelings or
[11:56] our feelings being heard
[11:57] there will praise god i'm so looking
[11:59] forward to that day aren't you brother
[12:01] joel aren't you looking forward to the
[12:02] day when nobody can hurt your feelings
[12:04] and you can't hurt nobody else's
[12:05] feelings aren't you looking forward to
[12:07] the day with everything you say will be
[12:08] true
[12:10] are you with me now you can't lie you
[12:12] can't steal you can't do anything not
[12:13] that you would do that now because the
[12:15] inside man controls the outside man but
[12:17] yet you say things sometimes that maybe
[12:19] you go back and say oh that i didn't
[12:21] realize that wasn't the whole truth and
[12:23] and you say and you may you make
[12:24] promises sometimes you can't keep but
[12:26] there's coming a day you won't do that
[12:28] no more
[12:29] because when you leave this life then
[12:31] that inside man takes over
[12:33] right but now as long as we're in this
[12:35] life
[12:36] that inside that outside man is still
[12:38] sticking he said it's going to bother
[12:40] you
[12:41] he said as long as you live
[12:43] he said but the inside of you you're
[12:45] born again and when you're raised up
[12:47] you're in the likeness of christ and all
[12:50] the sin has gone from you
[12:54] so just again to lay this foundation
[12:56] tonight there's
[12:57] there is a reason for our behavior
[13:00] but not an excuse
[13:04] right so there is a reason why we do the
[13:07] things that we do
[13:09] but it's not an excuse
[13:12] we've got to commit ourselves to the
[13:14] word
[13:15] in such a way and surrender ourselves to
[13:17] the word in such a way that lord if it's
[13:19] something that's written in the bible if
[13:21] it's something i shouldn't be doing i
[13:22] know i shouldn't be doing it it may be
[13:23] my nature to hold things against people
[13:26] but you said if i wouldn't forgive you
[13:28] wouldn't forgive me so i'm gonna forgive
[13:29] anyway
[13:31] it may be my nature to to be angry and
[13:34] and to walk around all the time with a
[13:36] temper like a buzz saw that may be my
[13:37] nature but that's not what the word says
[13:40] to do the word says to be live like
[13:42] peaceably with all men as much as you
[13:44] can and so i'm going to follow the word
[13:47] now you can't do that just because you
[13:49] decide to do it but you've got an inside
[13:51] man yes sir and if you'll let him he'll
[13:53] take control of the outside man
[13:57] that's being born again
[13:59] so again there's a reason for our
[14:01] behavior
[14:03] it's not an excuse the bible says let
[14:05] not sin therefore reign in your mortal
[14:08] body
[14:09] don't let it rain you can't do nothing
[14:11] about it being there
[14:13] right as far as this body being sin it
[14:15] is
[14:17] it is that's why you get distracted in
[14:19] church
[14:20] that's why you get when you get worried
[14:23] you realize worry isn't of god
[14:26] that's not of god at all god has nothing
[14:28] to do with that you didn't get that from
[14:30] god you didn't get that that's not
[14:31] because you're spiritual just because
[14:33] you're you're natural
[14:34] you're carnal
[14:35] but you don't have to let it rain yeah
[14:38] right right they don't have to have a
[14:40] scepter over you holding it over you and
[14:42] keeping you down listen what we come
[14:44] we'll come through our genes does not
[14:46] have to keep us down
[14:48] we're not bound to repeat the mistakes
[14:50] of past generations but we can press
[14:52] forward we can move on we can go on into
[14:54] something better aren't you glad for
[14:56] that tonight doesn't that give you a
[14:58] freedom you can say lord i know i can i
[15:00] can be better than that yes sir i can do
[15:02] better than that not by my own merit but
[15:04] because the word allows me to do it
[15:06] right and the life that is in me it's
[15:08] not the life of benjamin fruit anymore
[15:10] but the life that's in me is the life of
[15:12] christ
[15:14] so i can go from
[15:16] the ravening wolf nature
[15:18] to someone who's a protector
[15:21] of the throne of god
[15:24] so now
[15:26] brother branham likens it to the new
[15:28] heavens and new earth
[15:30] he said heavens and earth have met
[15:32] god and man is reconciled
[15:35] restored eden has begun all the curse is
[15:38] gone he said just like all the curse of
[15:42] sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts
[15:44] you
[15:46] he said see you don't accept it
[15:49] excuse me it accepts you
[15:51] because it's god's attribute if it's the
[15:54] holy ghost it means god's spirit are you
[15:56] with me tonight
[15:58] if it's the holy ghost it means god's
[15:59] spirit it's the attribute the thought of
[16:01] god has accepted you
[16:04] because that you were ordained for that
[16:06] purpose yet she was born in sin
[16:10] but god had that attribute amen and here
[16:13] you express yourself here on earth and
[16:15] he comes down and gets you
[16:18] i love it
[16:19] oh i just think it wasn't me at all
[16:22] looking i thought it was me looking i
[16:24] thought it was me struggling to get it
[16:25] but it was him coming down to get me
[16:29] i would hey man i was just attributed
[16:31] come down to get me he said see you're
[16:33] back here here's where you belong sin
[16:35] has lost its power
[16:38] what power did it lose the power to keep
[16:40] you back here
[16:41] you belong over here
[16:44] amen he said that's right the desire of
[16:46] sin is done gone from your heart when
[16:48] the holy ghost comes in you are a
[16:51] restored
[16:52] person
[16:54] and that doesn't mean you'll ever you'll
[16:56] never want to sin but what it means when
[16:59] the desire of sin as far as i can
[17:00] understand it when the desire of sin is
[17:03] gone from your life it means you never
[17:05] have to sin
[17:08] are you with me now the excuses are gone
[17:11] you don't have to sin because there's a
[17:13] desire there that's put there by god
[17:15] that wants to be right
[17:18] then if you sin it's just because you
[17:19] let the devil in
[17:21] right and and we are capable of doing
[17:23] that
[17:25] but we don't have to
[17:27] what a freedom there is in them
[17:29] the desire is gone we don't want to live
[17:33] like that right
[17:35] amen and but it's from the inside
[17:36] because many people say what but but
[17:39] my flesh wants to
[17:41] look at something that's wrong my flesh
[17:43] wants to of course it does it's still un
[17:44] unregenerated
[17:47] right but the where's the desire coming
[17:49] from
[17:50] what what's your strong desire brother
[17:52] brown said by your desire you can see
[17:54] who's on the throne of your heart what
[17:56] is your strong desire is it to go to
[17:58] heaven amen i believe it is tonight you
[18:00] wouldn't be here on a wednesday night i
[18:02] believe you're in the house of god
[18:03] tonight because you got a desire a
[18:05] strong desire inside of you that was
[18:07] stronger than your weaknesses stronger
[18:09] than your desire to stay home stronger
[18:11] than your desire to sit back in your
[18:12] easy chair and go to sleep but it was
[18:14] stronger than that there's a desire
[18:16] inside of you that wants god
[18:18] and because you there's something inside
[18:20] of you that wants that you don't ever
[18:21] have to give in to the flesh again
[18:25] you might but you don't have to
[18:28] right
[18:30] now
[18:31] brother branham says you're a restored
[18:33] person he said that's where the outside
[18:34] can reason you take a man and say well
[18:36] you know i know i'm not supposed to
[18:38] commit adultery but you know in the
[18:39] spirit then the spirit tells me i
[18:41] shouldn't commit adultery but you see
[18:43] way down in there is still that thing in
[18:44] there he said see it'll kind of govern
[18:46] around
[18:48] right so it'll govern around what you
[18:50] know to do is right and do something
[18:52] wrong anyway
[18:54] even though you know it's wrong
[18:56] it'll govern around that
[18:58] because the inside man's not been
[18:59] changed
[19:01] he said but when it's
[19:03] directed from the inside it throws all
[19:05] the rest of it together he said that's
[19:07] the guidepost that's the control tower
[19:08] the inside of the inside the soul
[19:10] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[19:14] the body aren't you glad there's
[19:15] something that you've got the controls
[19:17] yes hey man you're not you're not being
[19:19] controlled but you are actually in
[19:21] control
[19:23] even of your body now look
[19:24] and that goes to healing as well
[19:27] we're not controlled by our sicknesses
[19:30] we don't have to give in
[19:32] amen to the condition of our body
[19:34] because we know we have a healer we're
[19:36] already healed right we were healed on
[19:39] calvary the stripes were there for our
[19:40] healing and so because we know that we
[19:43] don't have to give in to that anymore
[19:46] and again you'll have sickness but you
[19:48] don't have to give into it you'll make
[19:49] mistakes but you don't have to give in
[19:51] to those mistakes
[19:55] now
[19:56] so that he said when it's directed from
[19:58] the inside it throws all the rest of it
[19:59] together he said look when this body
[20:00] receives the spirit of god the immortal
[20:02] life inside of you it throws this body
[20:04] in subjection to god
[20:06] he said he that's born of god does not
[20:08] commit sin he cannot sin
[20:10] he said he references romans 8 1 there's
[20:12] therefore now no condemnation to them
[20:14] that are in christ jesus that walk not
[20:15] after the flesh
[20:16] after the spirit he said there you are
[20:18] see that throws your body subject you
[20:20] don't have to say oh if i could just
[20:22] quit drinking if i could just just get
[20:24] in christ it's all gone because your
[20:26] body is subject to the spirit there's no
[20:28] more subject to the things of the world
[20:29] they're dead they're dead your sins are
[20:31] buried in baptism you are a new creation
[20:33] in christ and your body becoming subject
[20:35] to the spirit try to live a right kind
[20:37] of a life
[20:38] yeah right and that's not again it's not
[20:40] by constantly reminding yourself
[20:42] today i'm not gonna do it today i'm not
[20:43] gonna rob a bank
[20:45] all right today i'm not gonna write bank
[20:47] i don't have to do that
[20:49] right the desire's gone
[20:51] does that mean i'll never slip up on my
[20:53] taxes
[20:55] or be tempted to put something there
[20:56] that's not there
[20:58] right boy it got quiet
[21:02] but the desire of sin is gone i'm gonna
[21:04] go rob a bank
[21:06] all right i'm not gonna purposely go
[21:07] even mislead the government much as i
[21:08] would like to
[21:10] right but but in a moment of weakness
[21:12] might i be caught up in something sure
[21:13] i'll make it right yeah i'm sure why i'm
[21:16] a christian
[21:18] i'm a restored person
[21:20] amen i'm a new creature in christ
[21:24] hallelujah and so he says you're a new
[21:26] creation he said your sins are buried in
[21:29] baptism your new creation in christ in
[21:31] your body becoming subject to the spirit
[21:33] try to live a right kind of life but now
[21:35] in that and again trying to keep the
[21:37] balance of this of this foundation so we
[21:39] can begin to look into the scripture you
[21:41] still have to overcome right
[21:44] how many know that tonight
[21:46] i got class participation because you
[21:48] spread out kind of tonight all over the
[21:50] place
[21:50] so i can't really see you without my
[21:52] glasses on but but you know we know uh
[21:55] that that we have to overcome and
[21:56] brother brown said he can't just push
[21:58] you through a pipe and pull you out the
[21:59] other end you've got to overcome yes sir
[22:02] right right right and so paul puts it
[22:04] this way he said this i say then walk in
[22:06] the spirit
[22:07] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[22:09] flesh
[22:10] so that's what we have to do so here we
[22:12] have this nature and nurture that's
[22:14] pulling us down but here we have a new
[22:16] nature on the inside we're a new
[22:18] creature in christ and that creates that
[22:21] war before there was no war because it
[22:23] was just whenever you wanted to do
[22:24] something bad you just did it
[22:26] now there's an awakening of that seed
[22:28] now you have a desire to do the right
[22:30] thing and the holy ghost when it comes
[22:32] in there becomes a control tower that
[22:33] controls you and keeps you doing the
[22:35] right thing yes
[22:37] amen and so now
[22:40] now
[22:40] you have that but they didn't have that
[22:42] in the old testament yeah
[22:45] you realize all even the greatest men in
[22:48] the old testament did not have the holy
[22:50] spirit on the inside
[22:52] right it could only anoint their spirit
[22:54] but they could not have the life of
[22:55] christ because christ hadn't come and
[22:57] died yet
[22:58] sure right so they did not have the holy
[23:00] ghost or the token as we know it today
[23:03] though they were influenced under the
[23:04] holy ghost and though they walked in
[23:06] faith and though they did great deeds
[23:08] and mighty miracles and things like that
[23:10] yet you see a fluctuation in in and out
[23:14] a backsiding constantly
[23:17] and and it's it's instructive for us to
[23:19] look back at what went on with them
[23:21] because we see how these two realms on
[23:24] the outside
[23:25] actually work
[23:27] right because you could look at a man
[23:29] like joseph or jacob or
[23:31] or a man like abraham and think my
[23:34] there's a man who should have never done
[23:36] anything wrong but look what how they
[23:37] backslid how they lied how they did the
[23:39] things that they did a man like david
[23:41] how could david ever do that well that's
[23:43] because there's just there's no control
[23:45] tower on the inside
[23:47] are you with me now but yet you see god
[23:49] still loved him god they were still a
[23:51] man after god's own heart but but you
[23:53] see they were walking in the flesh yes
[23:55] sir and then they walk in the spirit for
[23:57] a while but then they'd walk in the
[23:58] flesh because there was nothing there to
[23:59] hold them to keep them and hebrews deals
[24:01] with that we could go look at it he said
[24:03] there was no sacrifice that could make
[24:05] the one coming to it perfect right right
[24:08] there was nothing there that they could
[24:09] come back and once for all but we do
[24:11] have that sacrifice
[24:13] we have a high priestess greater than
[24:15] aaron aren't you glad for that we have a
[24:17] high priest after the order of
[24:18] melchizedek had no beginning of days or
[24:20] ending of days
[24:21] our high priesthood is always there and
[24:24] he said john said if any man sin he has
[24:27] an advocate with the father you you
[24:29] can't sin in the eyes of god yes that's
[24:31] right are you with me tonight
[24:34] so now as we look at this i want to look
[24:36] at the tribe of benjamin
[24:39] and
[24:40] and this family
[24:41] the broader family of israel of jacob
[24:44] but especially it's the tribe of
[24:46] benjamin because it's an interesting
[24:47] study
[24:48] in extremes
[24:50] there were famous benjamites in the old
[24:52] testament just a few hood was one of
[24:55] them he was the left-handed assassin in
[24:57] the book of judges you boys are going to
[24:59] go find that now
[25:00] the left-handed assassin
[25:02] went and killed the king
[25:05] and that was that was bringing reigning
[25:08] over the israelites or or causing
[25:10] bringing the israelites into bondage
[25:13] and there was saul
[25:15] saul was a very interesting case and
[25:17] we'll get to him at some point saul
[25:19] is a fascinating man because of all the
[25:21] things he did right and all the things
[25:23] he did wrong
[25:24] right and brother brown said he still
[25:26] made it
[25:27] sure right and but he's a fascinating
[25:29] man mordecai and esther were benjamites
[25:33] and then paul the apostle in the new
[25:36] testament was a benjaminite and those
[25:38] are the major
[25:39] benjamites in the bible now the prophecy
[25:43] we know had to come true that jacob when
[25:45] he prophesied and actually these
[25:48] mothers would would cry out but it's
[25:50] interesting benjamin's name is not what
[25:52] jacob prophesies over him but benjamin's
[25:56] name is actually a son of my right hand
[25:58] i know that because that's my first name
[26:01] and it's not personal at all tonight but
[26:03] it is interesting to me because my name
[26:05] is benjamin my son's name is benjamin
[26:07] but but yet there's a there there's a
[26:10] prophecy that jacob gives after his
[26:12] mother names him benjamin son of my
[26:14] right hand
[26:15] and the second prophecy seems to go more
[26:16] with that that first prophecy just calls
[26:19] him a ravening wolf he's uncontrollable
[26:22] well there's a reason for that
[26:25] and it has to do with how he was raised
[26:28] and the kind of family he was born in
[26:30] and the environment and things that he
[26:32] was around and and this is important and
[26:34] i don't want to
[26:36] bring any kind of guilt tonight because
[26:38] some of you have raised your children
[26:39] and and some turned out better than
[26:41] others and it just seems like you just
[26:44] we live in a fallen world
[26:46] and any child is capable without the
[26:49] holy ghost if they don't receive the
[26:50] holy ghost they're capable of doing
[26:52] almost anything
[26:54] and that's just the truth
[26:56] and we've got to learn that and it
[26:58] doesn't it doesn't bring your any less
[27:00] love for them it's just the way that the
[27:01] human flesh is but we need to get them
[27:03] in an atmosphere where they can get the
[27:05] holy ghost we need to have them in an
[27:07] atmosphere where they can hear the word
[27:08] yes sir and we've been like that is
[27:10] something we can do yeah and we can set
[27:13] the right kind of example before them
[27:14] now benjamin was born of godly parents
[27:18] but there was trouble in the home
[27:21] jacob and rachel were sweethearts
[27:24] but because polygamy was legal at the
[27:25] time and his payment for jacob's shyster
[27:28] ways because he had
[27:30] he deceived people so many times he got
[27:32] deceived and laban his father-in-law
[27:35] deceived him into marrying leah first
[27:37] that's that's a fascinating story isn't
[27:40] it
[27:41] that he actually gets the wrong life
[27:43] yeah
[27:45] and you can imagine the resentment that
[27:47] he must have had
[27:48] because he still loves rachel so much
[27:50] he's not just going to quit
[27:53] but then he's got to he gets to marry
[27:55] rachel right after he marries leah but
[27:57] then he's got to work seven more years
[28:00] right for her you can imagine the
[28:01] resentment that that you know you come
[28:03] in every you know it's hard sometimes to
[28:05] go to work and you go to work and you
[28:06] sit there and think well all i'm doing
[28:08] is paying bills you know i should have
[28:09] never got married should have never had
[28:11] a family i know none of you men have
[28:12] ever thought like that but i have
[28:16] you get that hard at work and you're all
[28:17] stressed out said man i can't believe i
[28:19] did this you know i'd have been better
[28:21] off by myself you know and
[28:23] and you forget about the joys of it and
[28:25] i can imagine sometime during that seven
[28:26] years that that he was really bummed out
[28:28] because now it had been almost 14 years
[28:30] he couldn't go make his own life he
[28:32] couldn't get away from his in-laws
[28:34] he's stuck there finally he sneaks away
[28:35] from him in the dead of night
[28:37] runs away because he and and
[28:41] he pulls another con and ends up leaving
[28:43] town jacob was quite a fellow
[28:46] but now here he
[28:48] must have been such frustration
[28:50] and when you have that kind of
[28:51] frustration towards the mom
[28:54] it goes towards the children yes that's
[28:56] right right and and on the other side
[28:59] you've got another step thank god we
[29:01] don't believe in polygamy anymore
[29:03] are these guys that want to restart that
[29:05] my goodness what in the world have you
[29:06] never read the bible
[29:10] every time there was fights in the home
[29:13] we got enough trouble without more than
[29:15] one wife
[29:18] and here there was there was all kinds
[29:20] of trouble in the home and
[29:21] and just an extra set of resentment that
[29:24] he has because listen he never picked
[29:26] her
[29:28] her father his father-in-law picked her
[29:30] for him
[29:32] and and so the bible tells us that laban
[29:35] had two daughters the name of the elder
[29:36] was liam the name of the younger was
[29:38] rachel it said leo was tenderized in
[29:41] other words in in that old testament
[29:42] parliament her eyes were dull she didn't
[29:44] have a a good expression in her eyes she
[29:47] was just kind of a plain person
[29:50] but rachel was beautiful and well
[29:52] favored it meant she was she was
[29:54] beautiful in face and body
[29:56] she was a beautiful woman but leah was
[29:59] not
[30:00] you think leah didn't know that
[30:03] leah's leah that's probably why laban
[30:05] got her married off the way he did you
[30:08] know you got a pretty bad case of it if
[30:11] if your father is trying to get you
[30:12] married off secretly
[30:14] without the man knowing
[30:17] but now
[30:20] come on this is real life church
[30:22] without the holy ghost right
[30:25] remember that
[30:26] we're talking about families without the
[30:28] holy ghost
[30:29] right
[30:30] and so there there's a constant fuss
[30:32] going on in the home and there's a
[30:34] there's a feeling jacob
[30:36] even though he loves all of his children
[30:38] i really believe that based on what we
[30:39] see in the scripture but he doesn't love
[30:42] leah's children like he does rachel's
[30:44] children
[30:47] and so
[30:48] the bible tells us that he went in also
[30:50] into rachel and he loved also rachel
[30:52] more than leah i mean that's a pretty
[30:54] plain statement he loved her more
[30:56] and served with him yet seven other
[30:59] years that was now he served for 14
[31:02] years
[31:02] when the lord saw that leah was hated he
[31:05] opened her womb
[31:07] but rachel was barren
[31:09] now by showing favoritism in the home
[31:12] jacob is repeating a family mistake
[31:16] that goes back to his father isaac
[31:19] and he should have known better because
[31:21] his dad did the same thing to him
[31:25] right
[31:26] but isn't it strange how we seem to pass
[31:28] on we can't do the same things again
[31:30] without the holy ghost looking just at
[31:32] the flesh the outside man
[31:34] right the holy ghost on the inside but
[31:36] sometimes we still make mistakes and
[31:37] many times we do but here he makes a
[31:39] mistake of showing favoritism towards
[31:42] his towards his other children towards
[31:43] rachel's children and it caused them no
[31:46] end of trouble and we'll get into more
[31:47] of this as we go along and i'll show you
[31:49] how even joseph was caused trouble
[31:51] because
[31:52] that he had that favoritism showed
[31:54] towards him and it's how he ends up in a
[31:56] pit
[31:57] because the other brothers know that
[32:00] right and and so now
[32:02] these family genes are so strong that he
[32:04] is actually doing the same thing his
[32:06] father did even though he saw his
[32:07] father's mistake the bible tells us
[32:09] isaac loved esau
[32:11] because he did eat of his venison that's
[32:14] a strange reason to love one child more
[32:16] than the other
[32:17] but rebecca loved jacob yeah
[32:20] see it's difficult for fathers not to
[32:22] show favoritism towards talented
[32:25] children
[32:26] especially if they're talented in the
[32:28] same way the father is
[32:30] right because you're going to do more
[32:32] things with them
[32:34] well you didn't think this was going to
[32:35] go this way did you
[32:38] but we had to be careful with that
[32:39] because we could scar generations of
[32:41] children
[32:43] right that's right
[32:45] because we're responsible for every one
[32:46] of our children not just the ones we
[32:48] like
[32:52] i say well i like all my children well
[32:57] you say but brother ben we we like that
[32:59] part about the we're a restored creature
[33:01] and all that yeah but you're also an
[33:03] outside man
[33:04] you understand and this is instructive
[33:06] to us to understand
[33:08] how we should do and and and how we
[33:10] could should continue to watch for these
[33:11] things in our in our outer man we're
[33:14] responsible for our children
[33:16] now the bible says train up a child in
[33:18] the way he should go and when he's old
[33:20] he will not depart from it train means
[33:22] to dedicate to dedicate
[33:25] it's the idea of setting aside narrowing
[33:28] or hedging in now if i wanted one of
[33:30] these children to go a certain down a
[33:32] certain aisle in the church what i would
[33:34] do is i would i would stand in front of
[33:36] them block their path in some way so
[33:38] that they would go down the other aisle
[33:40] go down the aisle i wanted them to and
[33:42] that's the idea is by by looking at your
[33:44] children by watching your child by
[33:46] paying attention to your children and
[33:47] you actually corral them or
[33:50] or move them in the right direction
[33:52] in the way that they should go their way
[33:54] is their custom or their manner or
[33:56] behavior the idea is according to their
[33:59] bent and i've talked to you about that
[34:01] before it's like going out in the forest
[34:03] and you see a tree that's been a certain
[34:05] way they would make a bow maybe
[34:07] for arrows out of a of course you would
[34:09] have make a bow for arrows but a bow to
[34:11] shoot arrows with they would make it out
[34:13] of a piece of wood that was already bent
[34:15] that way
[34:16] and the reason for that is because
[34:18] you don't fight the bend of the wood
[34:21] but yet you have to make the child live
[34:23] according to the scripture
[34:25] right and when i say make the child when
[34:27] they're very young that's exactly what
[34:28] you have to do
[34:30] because they're not going to do it on
[34:31] their own
[34:32] right news flash right your children are
[34:35] not going to live right on their own
[34:37] without the holy ghost they're just not
[34:39] going to do it most of the time there
[34:40] may be outliers in that there's
[34:41] exceptions to every rule most of the
[34:43] time they're just going to they're just
[34:45] going to be little brats
[34:49] because they got all boy
[34:52] i can't make you laugh tonight
[34:55] they got all your genes in them right
[34:57] they're little unconverted versions of
[34:59] yourself
[35:01] that's why excuse me for saying this
[35:03] that's why we we love it when they do
[35:05] something good
[35:07] right we just love it when they do
[35:09] something good because most of the time
[35:10] they don't
[35:15] right now
[35:16] so the idea is to bring the child up
[35:18] according to its bent or tie the tree to
[35:21] a stake
[35:22] to make it go straight you see a tree
[35:24] some trees are almost straight but you
[35:26] still correct it so you corrected a
[35:28] certain amount
[35:29] right and some grow up like this
[35:32] and it takes a lot more correction and
[35:34] polling and you're just constantly
[35:36] pulling you're tying it and but you've
[35:38] got to do it in such a way that'll
[35:40] acknowledge the way that the child is
[35:43] already bent and make sure that you
[35:45] bring it back to the word
[35:46] so now uh paul puts it this way in the
[35:49] new testament he said you fathers
[35:50] provoke not your children to wrath
[35:53] in other words don't grab a hold of them
[35:55] and pull them back so severely that they
[35:57] they all you do is make them mad but
[36:00] random says sometimes all we do is beat
[36:01] the devil into our children
[36:04] right and the bible says to use a rod it
[36:07] does say that
[36:09] i could get in trouble for saying that
[36:10] on the internet today they call that
[36:12] child abuse but the bible says spare the
[36:14] rod and spoil the child
[36:16] but yet you could do that so much that
[36:18] you actually just beat the devil into a
[36:20] child
[36:21] right because maybe it doesn't need that
[36:23] maybe it needs some some spiritual help
[36:26] and some prayer
[36:27] and so you've got to bring them up the
[36:29] bible says in the nurture and admonition
[36:32] of the lord
[36:34] so
[36:35] a more sensitive child the mother will
[36:36] tend to tend to
[36:38] look towards that one or maybe a child
[36:40] with special needs because that's the
[36:41] nature of a mother a father will look
[36:43] more towards that one who's able to do
[36:45] things and able to hunt and able to fish
[36:47] and able to do the things like that
[36:49] that's just natural but you got to be
[36:50] careful with that and i believe the holy
[36:52] ghost can make us better at raising our
[36:54] kids
[36:55] you believe that i believe it'll do that
[36:58] now
[36:58] he brother brown says oh he said your
[37:00] family is what you are
[37:03] now that's a scary thought
[37:05] he said you raise your child in a
[37:07] certain environment
[37:08] it's got a 98 percent better chance now
[37:11] he didn't say 100
[37:12] because sometimes like i said the tree
[37:14] is just bit so severely because maybe
[37:17] genes that pass through you pass through
[37:19] your generation express themselves in
[37:21] that child
[37:22] and it just it becomes a wild a child
[37:26] that's gone crazy it seems like but yet
[37:28] you have a promise god will bring it
[37:30] back
[37:31] you still you don't just give up on it
[37:33] you still try to bring it back and raise
[37:35] it in the right kind of a of an
[37:37] environment as long as you have control
[37:38] over that so now he said it's got a 98
[37:42] better chance to go right than it has if
[37:43] you bring it up in the wrong way
[37:45] bring up a child in the way it should go
[37:47] when it's old it will not depart from it
[37:48] be brought up right he said teach your
[37:50] children to do right to be honest to be
[37:53] square and fair even when they're in
[37:56] school
[37:58] you know god would motivate a a prophet
[38:01] to take time in the message that we have
[38:03] when he told us about the deity of
[38:04] christ and all these wonderful things
[38:06] and then he would motivate that same
[38:07] prophet to say make sure your kids don't
[38:10] cheat in school
[38:12] right motivate them in what he tells you
[38:14] to do if you go on in that quote he said
[38:16] pray for them
[38:17] if they've got a test at school or
[38:19] something coming up pray with them
[38:21] that's right
[38:22] oh my
[38:24] and having a homeschool doesn't give you
[38:25] an excuse to not pray for your children
[38:27] either
[38:29] right homeschool doesn't cure everything
[38:32] right and and
[38:34] you know that you all know that and many
[38:35] of our kids go to public school but
[38:36] whether they go to public school or
[38:37] homeschool they're gonna have to fight
[38:39] battles
[38:40] and we still need to pray for our
[38:41] children and pray with our children
[38:45] now brother branham says look at this
[38:47] little story right here now he's reading
[38:49] the story of elisha and he comes to the
[38:52] part about the bear you remember the
[38:53] story where elisha comes out it's a
[38:54] scary story there's another one for you
[38:56] to look up it's kind of a scary story
[38:58] because elisha goes out and and some
[39:00] children come out and mock him say go up
[39:03] that bald head go up that bald head and
[39:04] elisha comes out
[39:06] and rebukes him he gets in the flesh the
[39:08] brain said it was not the spirit of
[39:10] christ
[39:11] but he gets in the flesh remember again
[39:13] even prophets in the old testament did
[39:15] not have the holy ghost of token the way
[39:17] we do
[39:18] right so now he gets in the flesh and he
[39:21] and he speaks that
[39:23] and then he uh then the she bear god
[39:26] honors the prophet and a she-bear comes
[39:28] out of the wilderness and eats those
[39:30] children yeah
[39:32] well there's a scary thing don't don't
[39:34] laugh at the preacher now
[39:40] i'm getting some some big eyes here on
[39:42] the front row
[39:44] huh a bear literally come out of the
[39:46] wilderness and ate these kids
[39:49] but look
[39:50] they've been raised wrong aren't you
[39:51] glad you're raised right
[39:53] i said dad i'm so thankful for all those
[39:56] weapons i got because
[39:58] mom i'm so thankful for all the times
[40:00] you corrected me because i've never been
[40:01] eaten by a bear
[40:07] it's true
[40:08] so now brother brahman said he said look
[40:10] between the lines he said look at these
[40:12] little children going out making fun of
[40:13] this preacher that was bald-headed
[40:15] my goodness i could stop and stay there
[40:17] for a while
[40:19] he said look what they said to him go up
[40:20] now bald head like elijah but look what
[40:22] they were making fun of it wasn't just
[40:24] his bald head they were making fun of
[40:25] the supernatural
[40:28] that's a dangerous thing to do
[40:31] he said won't you he said they didn't
[40:33] believe that elijah went up they doubted
[40:35] it
[40:37] their priest and them had told them
[40:39] perhaps
[40:40] or he didn't go up it's just some
[40:42] fanaticism and that guy is supposed to
[40:44] be anointed with the same anointing that
[40:46] he was anointed oh it's nonsense tell
[40:49] him to go up
[40:50] and here with the little kids
[40:53] little innocent children but they've
[40:54] been brought up wrong
[40:56] he said bring up a child in the way that
[40:58] it should go and here they went down
[40:59] because the parents didn't believe it
[41:01] and how can you expect your children to
[41:02] go to sunday school and serve the lord
[41:04] when you yourself don't even go
[41:07] how can you expect your children to be
[41:09] something when you're nothing that's
[41:10] right that's a harsh statement
[41:12] he said but that's a little sassy about
[41:14] he said i don't mean it that way he said
[41:15] but he had me say it
[41:17] he said all right he said but i didn't
[41:19] mean you wasn't nothing i mean when you
[41:20] knew when you know that you make no
[41:22] profession
[41:23] how can you expect your children to be
[41:25] righteous
[41:27] when you're putting such an example
[41:28] before them that's right how can they do
[41:31] it how can you do it he said you're the
[41:33] best example that they have
[41:35] they're going to look to you
[41:37] when they won't look for no one else
[41:40] because your nature is in them that's
[41:43] right oh if we can only realize that
[41:46] they're going to look to you and they
[41:47] won't look for no one else because your
[41:49] nature is in them
[41:51] now he takes this now to satan he said
[41:54] like satan he knows a whole lot about
[41:55] human beings he said to god to job he
[41:57] said what would a man give for his skin
[41:59] sure he knows something about human
[42:01] nature he helped pervert it he knows he
[42:03] had a hand in it he knows a whole lot
[42:04] about it he still knows what to do to
[42:06] cause people to fall he knows human
[42:08] nature he knows human nature he knows
[42:11] how to catch you
[42:12] and you can look around all you want to
[42:14] and say well somebody else so and so
[42:16] they fell they did this or that but he
[42:17] knows how to get you
[42:21] and that's just the truth of it
[42:23] thank god for the holy ghost
[42:25] because the devil knows how to get you
[42:29] right
[42:30] he knows all about you he knows human
[42:32] nature
[42:33] he knows he's been he's been studying
[42:35] for thousands of years
[42:36] he knows how to catch you in it too and
[42:38] he's awake day and night
[42:40] he's he's going about like a roaring
[42:42] lion devouring what he will certainly he
[42:43] is so there he knows just how to do that
[42:45] but god turned around in elisha he
[42:47] cursed those children and 42 of them was
[42:50] killed by bears that ran out of the
[42:51] woods killed 42 of the children because
[42:53] they were disobedient and had been
[42:55] raised in the wrong kind of a home
[42:56] aren't you glad for the right kind of a
[42:58] home
[42:59] had been raised in the wrong kind of a
[43:01] home hey man he said in the wrong
[43:03] schooling to make fun of god's prophet
[43:05] instead of respecting god's prophet
[43:06] listen if the only thing my parents
[43:08] taught me was to respect this message
[43:10] that was something
[43:13] right they did teach me that
[43:16] yeah right and so i was never eaten by a
[43:18] bear
[43:21] and you teach them disrespect
[43:24] and they'll have the opposite problem
[43:27] try they'll they'll
[43:28] they'll get eaten as we would say maybe
[43:30] not in a natural sense today but they'll
[43:31] be eaten up by the world
[43:33] when they're taught to disrespect
[43:34] ministry and they're taught to
[43:35] disrespect especially the supernatural
[43:39] now
[43:40] he said isaac was raised as a now
[43:43] let me go back there he said to make fun
[43:45] of god's prophet instead of respecting
[43:47] god's prophet he said i tell you as you
[43:49] respect god's servants you respect god
[43:51] as you respect christ you respect god so
[43:54] and then he goes into the supernatural
[43:55] how that you respect what god does
[43:58] now isaac was raised as an only child
[44:02] and and i say that because the others
[44:03] were born later ishmael was expelled
[44:06] isaac was abraham's favorite
[44:09] obviously he was the promised son
[44:12] right if you go around and if you went
[44:14] around that home you knew who the
[44:15] promised son was
[44:17] right and and he made sure sarah made
[44:19] sure that everybody knew and everybody
[44:20] who thought any different was kicked out
[44:23] so now and he was a good child but he
[44:25] was raised up that way
[44:27] and jacob was his mother's favorite
[44:30] benjamin and joseph were jacob's
[44:32] favorites look how it goes on down
[44:33] through the
[44:34] channel and
[44:36] and then you can go even back further
[44:38] and go back to abraham and see how the
[44:40] good and the bad from abraham come right
[44:42] down through the family line
[44:45] right he taught them the bible says
[44:46] shall i hide from abraham the thing that
[44:48] which i do seeing that abraham should
[44:50] surely become a great and mighty nation
[44:52] all the nations of the earth shall be
[44:53] blessed in him for i know him he will
[44:55] command his children his household after
[44:57] him that it shall keep the way of the
[44:58] lord to do justice and judgment the lord
[45:00] may bring upon abraham that which he has
[45:01] spoken of him god speaks out about
[45:03] abraham and it comes out and isaac comes
[45:05] out and jacob they all serve the lord
[45:07] that's right right they don't go after
[45:09] other gods
[45:10] they serve the lord
[45:12] but at the same time they make some of
[45:14] the same mistakes that he did
[45:18] isaac makes the literal same mistake
[45:20] after his daddy made it twice yeah
[45:22] that's right
[45:24] going down and lying about his wife what
[45:26] a strange mistake to make but it run in
[45:28] the family
[45:30] right he lies about his wife because now
[45:32] watch here
[45:34] and are you still with me tonight i just
[45:35] got a few more minutes
[45:37] see there's a gene in abraham that was
[45:39] weak
[45:41] fearful so let's say that was a feared
[45:43] gene in abraham just in his flesh he was
[45:46] afraid now he wasn't afraid in faith he
[45:48] wasn't fearful in faith but there was
[45:50] something inside of him something in his
[45:51] body rather that
[45:53] that would make him afraid and so he
[45:55] went up into egypt and he went to the
[45:57] king of abimelech and he went up there
[45:59] and he thought well my goodness
[46:01] these people are going to kill me to get
[46:03] her because sarah's beautiful he thought
[46:05] a lot of his wife didn't he
[46:07] but it actually happened
[46:09] or pretty near happened like he thought
[46:12] sometimes what you fear will come upon
[46:13] you but that gene of fear come down in
[46:15] his own in his family
[46:18] he couldn't get away from it
[46:20] and and yet now he does it
[46:23] and and god punishes the the household
[46:25] there and causes them problems he was
[46:27] backslid he goes back
[46:29] and guess what happens later he does the
[46:30] same thing again
[46:32] he's done it twice i'm sure he told
[46:34] isaac the story don't do that
[46:37] and isaac comes back later gets in the
[46:39] same situation and that gene expresses
[46:41] itself
[46:43] right in that same situation
[46:45] you you know that in a lesser way
[46:47] right because maybe you're a person that
[46:49] talks a lot when you get in the corner
[46:52] right you get you get stressed out and
[46:54] you start talking or maybe you're a
[46:55] person that clams up
[46:57] when you talk a lot or when you rather
[47:00] when you get in the corner
[47:01] if you're a person maybe your dad may
[47:03] have done that you watch it you said i
[47:04] won't be like that but you get in that
[47:06] same situation you do the same
[47:08] thing all right them jeans pass
[47:11] themselves on
[47:12] along with what you're taught i can talk
[47:14] about brother harvey and his water
[47:15] bottles now but
[47:17] we won't
[47:18] those genes pass along
[47:20] from generation to generation right
[47:23] now but it's something that we carry
[47:25] with us so you got to watch that
[47:28] right if you know that it's in your
[47:29] family you got to watch that
[47:31] so now
[47:32] uh abraham backs in egypt isaac did the
[47:35] same thing
[47:36] now benjamin is born and i just wanted
[47:38] to lay a great big foundation for this
[47:40] and we'll get it
[47:41] maybe the week after next when i get
[47:42] back the lord willing but benjamin is
[47:45] born when jacob is backslid
[47:47] and but he's had a great experience with
[47:50] god
[47:50] he's wrestled with an angel he's been to
[47:53] bethel
[47:54] he's been face to face with god
[47:57] he's seen angels coming down out of the
[47:59] heavens he's wrestled with the with god
[48:02] in in a incarnate body form
[48:05] i mean jacob's seen some supernatural
[48:07] things
[48:09] but here he is he backslides and you see
[48:11] that's the pattern of his life
[48:13] jacob never breaks the family curse
[48:16] right
[48:17] he just keeps backsliding
[48:19] he journeys away from bethel and he
[48:21] comes after this great experience with
[48:23] god
[48:24] and
[48:25] and and you realize now it's never they
[48:27] always had a reason for leaving canaan
[48:29] if you go to abraham's family they were
[48:31] always leaving canaan
[48:32] and they always had a reason
[48:35] there was always a famine or there was
[48:37] something going on in the church are you
[48:39] with me now there's always a reason to
[48:41] leave
[48:43] but every time they left they back sin
[48:46] see when it comes to spiritual things
[48:48] the end never justifies the means
[48:51] you do the right thing in the right way
[48:53] so that your children know what the
[48:55] right way is
[48:57] and you'll find that even in even in
[48:59] ruth later on in naomi
[49:02] you'll find that they did the same thing
[49:03] they let naomi's family left
[49:07] now look
[49:08] every time abraham left canaan he had a
[49:10] good excuse every time jacob left
[49:12] bethlehem he had a good excuse naomi's
[49:14] husband left israel he had a good excuse
[49:15] but it still resulted in the loss of his
[49:17] sons
[49:18] jacob was constantly backsliding and
[49:20] you'll find it it says he journeyed from
[49:22] bethel he journeyed from bethel he'd
[49:24] have an experience with god and he'd
[49:26] journey away
[49:28] oh how many times have we done that in
[49:30] the flesh
[49:31] right but there's something that keeps
[49:33] holding me amen what is that the holy
[49:35] ghost the life of christ
[49:37] he was always backsiding but i want you
[49:39] to notice tonight before we close there
[49:41] had to come someone who would break that
[49:42] cycle
[49:44] and here you find that favoritism run
[49:45] down through the family until finally it
[49:47] got down into joseph
[49:50] benjamin doesn't break the cycle
[49:52] until literally thousands of years later
[49:56] oh my god
[49:58] amen
[49:59] because paul finally breaks it
[50:03] think about it every one of them acted
[50:05] the same way and paul finally breaks it
[50:10] but now
[50:11] here there would be a in this in this
[50:12] abraham isaac and jacob in this family
[50:14] line there would be someone who would
[50:16] break that
[50:17] and it wouldn't be
[50:19] jacob but it was joseph
[50:23] joseph broke it he was a favorite he was
[50:26] raised that way
[50:28] amen but he goes down to egypt
[50:32] hallelujah jacob was always backsliding
[50:35] but but here joseph served the lord in
[50:38] egypt
[50:40] it took joseph who was a type of christ
[50:43] because jacob kept trusting the arm of
[50:45] flesh in his own ability to get things
[50:47] done but joseph a type of christ breaks
[50:50] the cycle he becomes the prince of egypt
[50:52] which is a type of sin and overcome sin
[50:54] in egypt
[50:56] don't you see that's who we have inside
[50:57] of us no wonder he said greater is he
[50:59] that's in you than he that's in the
[51:01] world
[51:02] joseph breaks the top the type yes
[51:05] or he breaks rather the cycle and
[51:07] becomes the type of christ
[51:10] to where he's almost perfect brother
[51:11] said the only reason he wasn't is
[51:12] because to show it wasn't him
[51:15] amen
[51:16] because finally christ is the one who
[51:18] breaks it
[51:19] amen in the line of judah but now watch
[51:23] we have to overcome sin in egypt
[51:27] that's our type too
[51:29] he come to be the firstborn among many
[51:31] brethren how many believe that tonight
[51:33] among many brethren and so romans 7 21
[51:36] paul says i find then a law that when i
[51:38] would do good evil is present with me
[51:41] i delight in the law of god after the
[51:43] inward man but i see another law in my
[51:44] members warring against the law of my
[51:46] mind bringing me into captivity to the
[51:48] law of sin which is in my members all
[51:51] wretched man that i am
[51:53] who shall deliver me from the body
[51:56] of this death
[51:58] and that body was a
[52:00] body like a the illusionist to a dead
[52:02] body they would strap to a living man
[52:05] with chains that couldn't be broken
[52:06] until the rottenness from the body
[52:08] actually crept into the life of the
[52:11] living man
[52:14] oh my
[52:16] he said i want to do right but i can't
[52:17] do right because i'm a regimen who
[52:20] should deliver me from the body of this
[52:22] death it doesn't stop there though i'm
[52:23] so glad that the next verse is there
[52:26] i'm so glad for romans 7 25 he said who
[52:29] shall deliver me from the body of this
[52:31] death i thank god through jesus christ
[52:34] our lord joseph breaks the cycle
[52:38] amen
[52:39] hallelujah he breaks the cycle jesus
[52:42] broke the cycle i thank god through
[52:43] jesus christ our lord so then with the
[52:45] mind i myself serve the law of god but
[52:48] with the flesh the law of sin
[52:51] and it doesn't stop there either but it
[52:53] goes on into romans chapter eight and
[52:55] you remember the way the letter was
[52:56] written it was a letter that wasn't
[52:57] broken up into chapters like we have it
[52:59] today just to make it easier to find but
[53:02] romans chapter 8 and verse 1 there is
[53:03] therefore now
[53:05] because he broke the cycle
[53:08] because amen because jesus christ our
[53:11] lord live without sin in egypt
[53:14] are you with me now
[53:16] there is therefore now no condemnation
[53:18] to them which are in christ jesus who
[53:19] walk not after the flesh but after the
[53:22] spirit when you follow that example when
[53:24] you walk according to the spirit you
[53:26] walk in freedom
[53:27] and you break the cycle that has a hold
[53:29] over your family right
[53:32] hallelujah
[53:33] i believe i'm looking at some people
[53:35] that have broken that tonight yes
[53:37] i told some people here in hong kong i
[53:39] said you're going to have a difference
[53:40] because it's generation sometimes the
[53:42] cycle was broken and generations ago for
[53:44] some of you for some of us it was our
[53:46] generation
[53:47] but somebody's got to do it
[53:49] because the previous generation didn't
[53:51] break it doesn't mean it gives you an
[53:52] excuse to not break it that's right
[53:55] break the cycle make it better for your
[53:56] kids
[53:57] if the lord gives you kids make it
[53:59] better in your own life amen he said
[54:01] well i can't do that i thank god through
[54:03] jesus christ our lord
[54:05] who will deliver me from the body of
[54:06] this death oh it's still there you'll
[54:08] always carry it but you can have control
[54:11] over it
[54:12] instead of it having control over you
[54:14] yes sir
[54:15] i love this he said for the law of the
[54:18] spirit of life in christ jesus has made
[54:21] me free from the law of sin and death
[54:24] for what the law could not do
[54:26] in that it was weak through the flesh
[54:29] it tried to do it by fleshly means it
[54:31] tried to do it by self-help by
[54:33] psychology
[54:34] it couldn't do it but god sending his
[54:36] own son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[54:39] and forth sin condemned sin in the flesh
[54:42] in egypt
[54:44] hallelujah in a body just like yours and
[54:47] mine
[54:48] are you with me now he condemned sin in
[54:50] the flesh
[54:52] and the body built like ours where he
[54:54] could have sinned but yet he was christ
[54:56] he you realized he he was not going to
[54:58] god wasn't going to let him he wasn't
[55:00] going to do it because of who he was
[55:03] but he had the po he had the all the
[55:04] potential but the reynolds said he was
[55:05] tempted with uh the bible says he's
[55:07] tempted in all light points like we are
[55:08] but the reynolds said he was tempted
[55:09] with women
[55:11] but he didn't sin
[55:13] never gave in to the thought
[55:17] oh i thank god for a savior like that
[55:22] but listen we don't have to either
[55:25] sorry
[55:28] but if a man sinned
[55:29] he has an advocate a perfect advocate
[55:31] with the father
[55:33] yes hallelujah
[55:35] but he condemned sin in the flesh that
[55:37] the righteousness of the law
[55:39] might be fulfilled in
[55:41] us
[55:43] walk not after the flesh
[55:45] but after the spirit yes

[57:53] i can't do that
[57:54] i'm about to study on this i'd had these

[58:03] buying expensive drinks but i went up
[58:05] there and bought my wife a drink i knew

[58:21] that's that body of death
[58:23] but just the holy spirit i thank god for
[58:25] the holy spirit because that's the thing
[58:27] inside of you that tells you don't do
[58:28] that
[58:30] see and as we yield ourselves to that
[58:31] still small voice of the holy spirit in
[58:33] our lives we begin to act like christ
[58:36] we begin to break disciples
[58:38] we begin to live in egypt
[58:41] but not of egypt
[58:42] we become the king of it
[58:45] amen aren't you glad for that greater is
[58:47] he that is in you
[58:49] than he that is in the world
[58:51] amen let's bow our heads together
[58:53] heavenly father
[58:56] i
[58:58] i don't know how to say it in a way that
[59:01] maybe the people would understand but
[59:03] lord
[59:05] i want them to know that every one of
[59:07] them have the potential
[59:09] to break a cycle
[59:11] maybe it's already been done in their
[59:13] families but yet they have to be like
[59:14] paul
[59:15] broke that cycle of benjamin that cycle
[59:19] of of a wolf a ravening wolf
[59:22] even though earlier in his life he it
[59:24] had been expressed in his life in his
[59:26] his walk
[59:27] but he broke it one day
[59:30] no wonder he could write about who
[59:31] should deliver me from the body of this
[59:33] death
[59:34] he knew who he was named after and how
[59:36] solid failed
[59:38] but he broke that cycle and yet he said
[59:41] i keep under my body
[59:43] bring it in subjection even after i have
[59:46] the holy ghost i
[59:48] i keep working on it i keep
[59:50] sanctification in my life
[59:52] i keep listening to the right things and
[59:55] going to church
[59:57] and giving in to the voice of the holy
[59:59] spirit in my life
[1:00:01] oh god would you help us to be the same
[1:00:03] way tonight
[1:00:04] lord we don't want to ever sit back
[1:00:07] into what we used to be
[1:00:09] we don't want to become lord just a
[1:00:13] juxtaposition of our families
[1:00:15] just a a strange brew of
[1:00:18] of our mothers and our fathers expressed
[1:00:21] in genes in our life
[1:00:23] but lord may we be more than that may
[1:00:25] the genes that are expressed lord be
[1:00:28] love and joy and peace the fruits of the
[1:00:30] spirit
[1:00:31] lord which don't come from a natural
[1:00:33] genealogy but from a spiritual gene seed
[1:00:37] on the inside awakened by the holy
[1:00:38] spirit
[1:00:40] may it be so in our lives today
[1:00:42] lord i pray you would forgive us where
[1:00:44] we've expressed the wrong things

[1:04:20] there's
[1:04:23] satan's like a roaring lion
[1:04:28] roaming to and fro
[1:04:32] seeking whom he may devour
[1:04:36] the bible tells the soul
[1:04:40] many souls have been as prey
[1:04:44] to fall in some weak hour
[1:04:48] but god has promised us today
[1:04:52] is
[1:04:54] overcoming power
[1:04:57] greater is he that is in me
[1:05:01] the greater is he that is in me
[1:05:05] greater is he that isn't me
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:10] amen you're free to go in the name of
[1:05:11] the lord
[1:05:13] and on the day
[1:05:15] of pentecost
[1:05:17] a rushing mighty wind
[1:05:22] it blew into the upper room
[1:05:26] and baptized all of them
[1:05:30] with the power
[1:05:32] greater than

[1:05:49] in me
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:06:30] you
