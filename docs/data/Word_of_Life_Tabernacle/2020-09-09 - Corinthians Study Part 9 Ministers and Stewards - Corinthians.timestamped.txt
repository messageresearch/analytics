[24:57] jesus than silver or gold
[25:00] i'd rather have your presence in my life

[25:05] offer i believe that holds true for each
[25:08] one of us
[25:10] they're here on a wednesday night i pray
[25:11] you would come and
[25:13] that you would just touch every heart
[25:15] [Music]
[25:16] lord i can only do so much by speaking
[25:18] and by saying the things that i'm saying
[25:20] but lord
[25:22] you can do all things you're not limited
[25:25] lord in any way and so i ask you to come
[25:27] and just speak to each one those that
[25:29] are watching tonight and
[25:30] and couldn't make it for whatever reason
[25:32] i pray lord that you would bless them
[25:34] lord give them strength and
[25:36] also by the hearing of the word of god i
[25:39] pray lord that you would help us lord to
[25:41] keep fighting that battle that brother
[25:43] daryl talked about sunday night to be
[25:45] soldiers lord
[25:47] and to be willing to to fight for you
[25:50] because
[25:50] you are more precious to us than
[25:52] anything else thank you for all that you
[25:54] do
[25:54] heal the sick lord touch every afflicted
[25:57] person
[25:58] believe lord that you can do all things
[26:00] in jesus name
[26:02] amen amen god bless you
[26:05] we're going to be reading from first
[26:08] corinthians and i'll explain that in a
[26:10] moment first corinthians chapter 4
[26:13] while you're turning there
[26:17] it's good to be back in the house of the
[26:18] lord
[26:21] there's several people missing tonight
[26:23] and there's reasons for that i
[26:25] had gotten a call from another local
[26:28] pastor
[26:29] before church and having to shut down
[26:32] again due to chronovirus and it seems
[26:35] like it's kind of spreading through this
[26:37] area now
[26:38] and so we're watching it we're being
[26:40] just as careful careful as we can be i
[26:42] would remind you
[26:44] to continue to do the things that we've
[26:45] been doing because it's kept us from
[26:48] having to shut the church down for many
[26:49] many weeks now and we want to keep that
[26:52] keep that going so you all have been
[26:54] very mature about those things and i
[26:56] appreciate that
[26:57] and doing what you've done and it's a
[27:00] blessing to work with you on that and i
[27:02] know it's tedious and i know you get
[27:04] tired i do and
[27:06] i'm usually the first one to forget to
[27:07] do something and i
[27:10] kind of set a bad example but you remind
[27:12] me if you see me doing something i
[27:14] shouldn't be doing as far as
[27:15] taking the measures we need to take wash
[27:18] your hands and
[27:19] and try not to get too close to somebody
[27:22] if you don't have a mask on things like
[27:23] that
[27:24] if you're sick stay home and we're just
[27:27] trying to get through this
[27:28] and and make sure we protect those that
[27:30] are vulnerable
[27:32] uh eventually just a lot of people are
[27:33] going to get it you know it's just the
[27:35] way it is and
[27:36] and uh but it's just part of it we
[27:38] believe god can protect us and keep us
[27:40] safe and keep it from being serious and
[27:42] even
[27:43] all the cases that are out there there's
[27:45] none in the church
[27:46] but there's people that have maybe been
[27:48] around somebody who has tested positive
[27:50] and so they're kind of staying away
[27:52] until they find out for sure what's
[27:53] going on so
[27:55] we're taking every precaution we can and
[27:57] again i really appreciate the effort
[27:59] but let's just continue to do that i
[28:02] know allergies are really bad right now
[28:04] too so if you see me sniffling remember
[28:06] i've already had it
[28:08] so i can't spread it to anybody
[28:12] but i know several kids and things have
[28:15] got allergies and things and then
[28:17] it's just there's no way around that but
[28:19] god bless you for being faithful tonight
[28:21] and we're the faithful few in the house
[28:23] of god
[28:24] but we're gonna we're gonna treat it as
[28:26] if there's a hundred people sitting here
[28:28] or 500 people sitting here doesn't
[28:29] matter
[28:30] you're here and i'm here and the lord's
[28:32] here and that's what's important
[28:34] i want to pick up tonight on our
[28:36] corinthians study
[28:38] i have not done this in the church with
[28:40] people present
[28:41] this would be the ninth part and we'll
[28:44] be beginning the fourth
[28:45] chapter of first corinthians and i feel
[28:48] like we're reaching a place in this that
[28:51] i needed to address the whole church
[28:53] when we talked about these things i
[28:55] believe it'd be beneficial to us
[28:57] and so i trust the lord would just have
[28:59] his his way in that and
[29:01] and that i have the leading of the lord
[29:02] on that we're gonna read from first
[29:04] corinthians chapter four and verse one
[29:06] and then we'll read on down as we go
[29:08] through the sermon tonight
[29:10] verse one says let a man sow account of
[29:12] us
[29:13] as of the ministers of christ
[29:16] and stewards of the mysteries
[29:20] of god i pray the lord would add his
[29:23] blessing to the reading of the word you
[29:25] may be seated
[29:31] if you followed along and and there's
[29:35] eight previous videos that we've done
[29:37] through the during the week and
[29:38] taken some weeks off on the book of
[29:42] corinthians and went through the first
[29:43] three chapters
[29:45] if you followed along you found that
[29:47] paul deals with dissension in the church
[29:49] caused by colts of personality
[29:52] which had raised up because of carnal
[29:54] preferences of one minister over another
[29:57] now we would never deal with anything
[29:59] like that would we
[30:02] but they did these people did and
[30:05] corinth was a place and just kind of lay
[30:07] a little background here because i
[30:09] haven't
[30:10] dealt some of you may not have had an
[30:11] opportunity to to go back and listen to
[30:14] the rest of what we did so
[30:16] corinth was a city that was much like
[30:19] america is today they had
[30:21] things they had wealth they had the
[30:24] ability to
[30:25] do what they needed to do they lived
[30:27] comfortably in that time and
[30:29] they say that that was one of the
[30:30] greatest eras in history to live was
[30:32] during the the pax romana during that
[30:35] time when there was
[30:36] no wars at least close by and the people
[30:39] that were living there had wealth and
[30:40] all the money and things pouring in but
[30:42] it was a very wicked city
[30:44] and so it was amazing that there was a
[30:46] church there at all
[30:47] but there was some people who overcome
[30:49] that and and who were real believers and
[30:51] so paul addresses the letter to the
[30:53] saints
[30:54] at in corinth to the sanctified ones
[30:58] there was people there really lived
[30:59] godly lives in spite of all the
[31:01] excess around them and i think that's us
[31:04] today
[31:06] i believe that is i believe i'm talking
[31:08] to saints tonight
[31:10] so paul deals with that he deals with
[31:14] how that there's dissension in the
[31:15] church and he tells them he said hey
[31:16] we're all working on the same
[31:18] team he said i've planted apollos is
[31:20] watered
[31:21] but god gave the increase and and he
[31:25] tells the people he said you belong to
[31:26] god
[31:28] you don't belong to any certain preacher
[31:30] and we use kind of as a shorthand you
[31:32] know and
[31:33] so and so is church brothers so-and-so's
[31:35] church but you're really not
[31:37] you belong to god and so
[31:41] when we belong to god then god places
[31:44] ministry
[31:45] there to help us and they're not there
[31:48] as our overlords they're there to help
[31:50] us and they're responsible to god for us
[31:54] and so these calls of personality had
[31:56] come up because one liked
[31:57] the way this one did things and one like
[31:59] the way someone else did things
[32:01] but the thing is that we have to know
[32:04] how to
[32:05] what our attitude should be towards
[32:08] ministry and towards preachers
[32:10] and there's a biblical way that we
[32:13] should view
[32:14] ministry there's a biblical way to view
[32:17] ministers as individuals as as people
[32:21] and as differences in gifts and paul
[32:24] deals with that in
[32:25] in chapter four and so he starts off by
[32:29] saying
[32:29] let a man sow account of us or this is
[32:31] how you should
[32:32] view us this is the way that
[32:35] what your mindset should be towards us
[32:39] account of us as the ministers of christ
[32:42] and stewards of the mysteries of god
[32:46] so there's two things there ministers of
[32:48] christ and stewards of the mysteries of
[32:50] god the ministers
[32:52] it literally means a servant and and if
[32:54] you'll go back and watch some of what
[32:56] we've done previously you'll find paul
[32:58] calls
[32:58] uh ministers servants before but he
[33:02] doesn't use this same word
[33:04] and that's kind of messed up but you can
[33:06] see a servant is an
[33:08] under rower an under rower now
[33:11] an underrower is a subordinate rower
[33:15] and that's the word he uses here he
[33:16] doesn't use it anywhere else in his
[33:18] in his writings a subordinate rower
[33:22] john wesley said this about it he said
[33:25] let a man
[33:26] account us as servants of christ
[33:29] and you can't see the whole quote but he
[33:30] says the original word properly
[33:32] signifies such servants as labored at
[33:34] the ore and rowing vessels
[33:36] and accordingly intimates the pains
[33:38] which every faithful minister takes in
[33:40] his lord's work
[33:41] and wesley ends it with oh god where
[33:44] are these ministers to be found
[33:49] and isn't that the truth
[33:53] if you've ever seen the old movie been
[33:54] her have you ever seen the 1956 i think
[33:57] movie it was
[33:58] when paul used the word underwear that's
[34:00] the word for the person at the bottom of
[34:02] the ship
[34:04] so paul says let a man account of us as
[34:06] ministers as
[34:07] under rowers as the the guys at the
[34:10] bottom that keep the ship afloat
[34:14] but there's two things about the under
[34:16] rowers that
[34:17] is very true that number one they they
[34:20] don't go
[34:21] they don't or they don't make movements
[34:23] to their own
[34:24] beat but there's a guy beating the drum
[34:26] and
[34:27] they make the movement according to the
[34:29] guy that's beating the drum
[34:31] and the second thing is that when one of
[34:33] them falls out from overwork
[34:36] they just replace him
[34:40] that's true it's true i guess that tells
[34:44] us
[34:45] we're expendable
[34:48] now these underwearers would go down
[34:50] with the ship if the ship went down the
[34:52] underwears went down
[34:53] they had a vested interest in keeping
[34:55] the thing going
[34:57] and ramming as hard as they could
[34:58] because they were chained
[35:00] there and you know we're not slaves in
[35:02] that way but we're loved slaves to
[35:03] christ
[35:05] and so paul said this is how you should
[35:07] view ministry as
[35:08] under rowers underrowers a subordinate
[35:12] rower
[35:13] and so he also says
[35:16] it's not a flattering description but
[35:19] then he says stewards
[35:21] stewards economos which is the manager
[35:24] of a household or household affairs
[35:28] especially a manager or a superintendent
[35:31] a freedman or a slave to whom the head
[35:33] of the house or proprietor has entrusted
[35:35] the management of his affairs the care
[35:37] of receipts and expenditures the duty of
[35:39] dealing out
[35:40] the proper portion to every servant and
[35:42] even to the children not yet of age so
[35:45] in relation this is how you should view
[35:46] ministry in relation
[35:48] to the people you are ministers under
[35:51] rowers
[35:52] in relation to god you are stewards
[35:56] god has he's hired us for lack of a
[35:58] better term he's gifted us
[36:00] and placed us in a position to be
[36:03] responsible for his property
[36:06] right and so you would understand
[36:08] stewardship maybe in finances
[36:10] or something like that but stewardship
[36:12] in ministry is we're stewards of a
[36:14] specific thing of the mysteries of god
[36:18] we're stewards of the mysteries of god
[36:20] the things that have been handed to us
[36:23] from god and we are stewards of those
[36:25] things we have to care
[36:26] for those things and to dispense those
[36:28] things at the proper time so adam clark
[36:30] says
[36:31] this he said the steward or oconomos was
[36:33] the master's deputy
[36:35] in regulating the concerns of the family
[36:38] providing food for the household seeing
[36:40] it served out at the proper times and
[36:42] seasons
[36:42] and in proper quantities he received all
[36:45] the cash expended what was necessary for
[36:47] the support of the family
[36:48] kept exact accounts which he was obliged
[36:50] at certain times to lay before
[36:53] the master he was responsible for it
[36:57] and so he had to think at certain times
[36:58] he was the steward of the mystery of god
[37:00] and
[37:01] we had to think at certain times in what
[37:03] manner he would dispense that and at
[37:05] what time
[37:07] because you've been given certain things
[37:09] certain revelations certain
[37:11] this whole book has been opened to us
[37:14] right but a steward takes the book and
[37:16] he paul says i've not shunned to declare
[37:18] unto you the whole council of god
[37:21] right so you can't just take one thing
[37:23] and say well i'll just feed the people
[37:24] this one thing the rest of their lives
[37:26] that's not how it works but every
[37:29] service you get the mind of the lord you
[37:31] you come before god and say god what
[37:33] what did the people need
[37:35] what what needs and so the steward would
[37:37] look at the house he'd see there needs
[37:38] to be a
[37:39] certain proportion of wheat given a
[37:41] certain proportion of corn certain
[37:42] proportion of oil a certain proportion
[37:44] of this
[37:45] at a certain time because something was
[37:47] about to happen
[37:48] so at this hour a minister has to be
[37:50] under the influence of
[37:52] the age that he's living in so he comes
[37:55] under the messenger of the age and
[37:56] and he begins to look and see what what
[37:58] does the church need
[38:00] right now and i believe god can make
[38:02] that so specific as to
[38:04] speak to us specifically at a certain
[38:06] time exactly what we needed
[38:09] and some of you experienced that sunday
[38:12] when
[38:12] a a steward of the mysteries of god come
[38:15] by
[38:16] and begin to dispense something and
[38:18] preach on sleeping at night and you
[38:20] think that's an odd thing to
[38:22] but but some of you are dealing with
[38:23] that
[38:25] huh and then about soldiers and so
[38:29] different things that we're dealing with
[38:30] and it just hits us
[38:32] because the the minister has gotten in
[38:35] the spirit of the master
[38:37] of the house to know what he wants
[38:40] to to be dispersed to the people it's
[38:43] all available
[38:44] but what needs to be given at each time
[38:46] i'll be honest with you i agonize over
[38:48] that
[38:50] because it don't matter if there's five
[38:51] here or 50 or a hundred it doesn't
[38:54] matter it's it's
[38:55] it's still important what needs to be
[38:57] fed because there could be somebody
[38:58] there
[38:59] that's the last time they ever come to
[39:01] church
[39:02] it could be somebody that's the last
[39:03] opportunity they ever have to hear the
[39:05] gospel so
[39:06] maybe i'd say something that would be
[39:07] different than what you might think that
[39:09] the church needs but
[39:10] but maybe it'll be something that
[39:12] actually i don't even know about
[39:14] but it's something that's a real need in
[39:16] somebody's life
[39:18] so we pray that way that god would would
[39:20] give our stewards wisdom
[39:23] in the mysteries of god to preach the
[39:24] things that we need
[39:26] now brother branham says it this way and
[39:29] i apologize some of these got messed up
[39:30] and i'm sorry i did that
[39:32] i'm not real good at using that program
[39:35] yet so i'm
[39:36] some of these you're only reading the
[39:37] first half and i apologize for that
[39:40] it's not brother robert's fault it's my
[39:42] fault
[39:43] it worked earlier but it's just
[39:46] the way that i put it in there and i
[39:48] knew better now
[39:50] he says and now this is brother branham
[39:52] talking about stewardship he said now
[39:53] while we're here together and all of us
[39:55] longing the same thing
[39:57] he said make us true stewards
[40:00] and i love what he says here he said may
[40:02] we shape our lives by self-control
[40:07] shape our lives by self-control
[40:10] that will know by the help of the holy
[40:12] spirit to have a full
[40:13] confidence that jesus will say well done
[40:16] my good and faithful servant
[40:18] at that day he said may we shape our
[40:21] lives by self-control i love that that
[40:23] that
[40:24] image that provides to my mind of a
[40:26] steward sitting there and saying
[40:27] i could do this but i'm going to control
[40:30] myself because i know
[40:31] that these needs are here right and so
[40:35] i'm going to bring under my body as paul
[40:37] says later in corinthians
[40:38] and bring it under subjection because i
[40:41] don't want to be a castaway after having
[40:42] preached to others
[40:44] so brother branham says may we be
[40:47] upright
[40:48] honest and true may we be the kind of
[40:51] christian so this just doesn't apply to
[40:52] ministers but to each one of us
[40:54] may we be the kind of christian that
[40:56] would be a credit to any community
[40:58] may we be men and women such as you
[41:01] could lay your hands upon and say my
[41:03] servant behold this is my servant
[41:05] in whom i am delighted i can send them
[41:08] they'll go
[41:10] they know how to speak and when to speak
[41:12] and i can be with them
[41:15] he says oh father grant that blessing to
[41:17] every one of us
[41:20] we're stewards of the mysteries of god
[41:23] and again i have a right to preach any
[41:25] part of the word
[41:27] but i've got to be a faithful steward to
[41:29] know how much doctrine how much
[41:31] correction how much encouragement
[41:34] i feed the fathers the mothers the
[41:35] children the new christians the mature
[41:37] christian the milk and the meat
[41:43] that's a big job a man couldn't do it on
[41:44] his own he needs to
[41:46] listen to the master
[41:49] verse two of first corinthians chapter
[41:52] four says moreover it is required in
[41:53] stewards that a man be found faithful
[41:58] matthew henry put it this way that he
[41:59] act according to his commission neither
[42:02] withhold any privilege or any part of
[42:04] god's will from the people
[42:06] nor deliver his own notions as the will
[42:08] of god
[42:09] nor take more authority upon him than
[42:12] god has given him
[42:13] as also that he discover and communicate
[42:16] divine truths and blessings
[42:18] as the hearers are able to receive them
[42:22] another commentary puts it this way he
[42:23] says they are in relation to the truth
[42:26] stewards that is to say the truth is not
[42:29] revealed by them speaking of preachers
[42:31] but to them that's an important
[42:34] distinction
[42:35] the truth is not revealed to or or by
[42:38] the preachers revealed to the preacher
[42:40] right and and this is important because
[42:43] even in the message
[42:44] you know we say well brother branham
[42:46] broke the seals well that's not what the
[42:47] bible says
[42:49] the bible says the lamb opened the seals
[42:53] right and then he brother branham put it
[42:54] this way like he took it and gave it to
[42:57] us
[42:57] the seventh angel right and then he gave
[43:00] it to us
[43:02] right so it was revealed to him it was
[43:04] not revealed by him
[43:06] that's the steward he said so it's held
[43:09] not as their property but as their trust
[43:13] it is not appropriated to their own use
[43:17] right that's a you have what we call in
[43:19] the title business the fiduciary
[43:21] responsibility to the word
[43:23] right so it says that i will not take
[43:26] the word
[43:27] and use it to promote myself
[43:31] or to prove myself right or to fight
[43:34] with you about something
[43:37] right because that to do that is though
[43:40] it's the word though it's true
[43:42] but to do that is to use it for my own
[43:44] purposes and i don't have a right to do
[43:47] that
[43:50] it's not held as my property but as my
[43:53] trust as a trust it's not appropriate to
[43:55] their own use
[43:55] but it's dispensed by them for the
[43:57] benefit of others they're not at liberty
[43:59] to do as they like with it they are
[44:01] accountable to the lord of all
[44:03] for the way in which they deal with it
[44:09] paul says in first corinthians 4 3 but
[44:11] with me is a very small thing that i
[44:12] should be judged of you
[44:15] or of man's judgment yeah i judge not my
[44:17] own self now paul begins dealing here
[44:19] with
[44:20] something that we call man's day versus
[44:22] the day of the lord
[44:24] the day of man is put before us as a
[44:26] person and that where it says man's
[44:28] judgment that's literally translated
[44:29] man's day
[44:31] paul says i won't be judged in man's day
[44:36] this is the day of man
[44:39] all days previous to the day of the lord
[44:41] is the day of man
[44:43] this is man's day but i'm not going to
[44:45] be judged in man's day
[44:47] and be judged in the day of the lord and
[44:50] paul deals with that over the next few
[44:51] verses but brother branham says this he
[44:53] says
[44:54] he said he's here he said oh it seems
[44:57] crazy to the world
[44:58] i know it's driving you crazy to read
[45:00] the first half of these and i'm sorry
[45:03] he said it seems crazy to the world sure
[45:04] it did in all ages and it will in this
[45:06] age but just wait for that age that is
[45:08] to come
[45:09] he said this is man's day the day of the
[45:12] lord will come he said let us serve him
[45:14] so now
[45:16] that in the day when he does come we'll
[45:18] be found
[45:19] faithful whether we live he said or
[45:22] whether we sleep we'll be awakened by
[45:24] the sound of the trumpet
[45:26] and will rise in the beauty of his
[45:27] resurrection shall be partakers of his
[45:29] holiness and
[45:29] of his power and of his resurrection
[45:33] so paul continues in that vein he said i
[45:35] won't be judged
[45:36] in man's day he said for i know nothing
[45:38] by myself
[45:40] and what that means it sounds like he's
[45:42] saying i'm ignorant but that's not what
[45:43] he's saying he says i'm ignorant of
[45:45] anything that would offend my conscience
[45:47] that word to know nothing is his
[45:49] conscience
[45:50] he said i'm not conscious of anything
[45:52] that i've done that where i would have
[45:54] failed as a minister as a steward
[45:56] no he's probably better off than i am
[46:00] but paul has a clear conscience before
[46:01] the people
[46:03] he said i haven't failed you in any way
[46:05] as a minister as a steward to my
[46:06] knowledge
[46:08] he says my conscience is clear i know
[46:10] nothing by myself
[46:12] but i'm not justified by my conscience
[46:16] now think about that as an individual
[46:18] but jt you think about that my
[46:19] conscience is clear
[46:20] i know i've lived right i've done right
[46:22] before the people but i'm not justified
[46:24] by my conscience
[46:26] god will be the judge because i could be
[46:29] sincerely wrong
[46:32] i could be ever so sincere and be wrong
[46:34] but he says
[46:35] he that judges me is the lord that's the
[46:39] one in the end that'll
[46:40] provide the judgment so he says i'm not
[46:43] aware of anything and that's the way we
[46:44] should be he said but i'm not justified
[46:46] by that alone
[46:48] especially as a minister of the gospel
[46:50] so in verse 5 he says therefore judge
[46:52] nothing before the time until the lord
[46:55] come now this is the day of the lord
[46:56] he's talking about man's day man's
[46:58] judgment
[46:59] now he says until the lord come judge
[47:00] nothing until the lord come
[47:02] who both will bring to light the hidden
[47:04] things of darkness and will make
[47:05] manifest the councils of their hearts
[47:07] then shall every man have praise of god
[47:11] so don't superinvest yourself in any
[47:14] ministry to the point where the ministry
[47:16] gets bigger than the word
[47:18] because you may have invested in
[47:20] something that's not even true in the
[47:22] end
[47:24] even maybe if it preached true things
[47:27] but what'll matter is at the end
[47:29] not anytime in man's day but at the end
[47:32] all the works will be made manifested
[47:34] and that he dealt with that in
[47:36] first corinthians three now brother
[47:38] brown says the day we're living is
[47:39] called in the bible the day of man man's
[47:41] day this is not
[47:42] god's day god is not the god of this
[47:45] earth
[47:46] he says the bible says he isn't he's the
[47:48] god of heaven but this is not god's day
[47:49] this is choosing day he said
[47:52] either live for today and die choose god
[47:54] and live
[47:55] god is the word and the word is the word
[47:57] manifested for the hour and the day
[48:01] now he goes on he said notice the day of
[48:02] man and this is in the god of this evil
[48:04] age if you want to look it up later
[48:06] he says if you want to put that down i
[48:08] was going to read it but first
[48:09] corinthians 5
[48:10] 4 1-5 he said was paul speaking of being
[48:13] judged by man in man's day he said the
[48:15] day
[48:16] he said what do you call it man's day
[48:18] for he said you would say it's the day
[48:20] that listen
[48:21] it's the day that the works but the
[48:23] knowledge of man is glorified
[48:25] now have you ever seen a day like that
[48:27] today
[48:29] the works by the knowledge of man is
[48:31] glorified look what we can do as a
[48:33] society
[48:35] works by the knowledge of man look what
[48:37] how we can provide for all the people
[48:39] look what we can do it works for the
[48:41] it works from the mind of a man works by
[48:44] the knowledge of man
[48:46] he said look what all the brag of the
[48:47] communist somebody
[48:49] trying to get somebody to the moon he
[48:50] said god is trying to get somebody to
[48:52] heaven
[48:53] he said but they're spending millions
[48:55] and billions and trillions of dollars in
[48:56] a wasted effort
[48:58] he didn't say they wouldn't get there in
[49:00] this place he says when they get there
[49:01] they ain't going
[49:02] to find nothing that's true
[49:05] he said what's the matter with him he
[49:06] said i don't care about the moon i want
[49:08] to pass the moon so fast i won't even
[49:09] see it
[49:11] amen it's just going to keep going
[49:13] higher he said i want to
[49:15] pass the milky way go on just keep going
[49:20] he said in the world today is dedicating
[49:22] themselves to the knowledge which came
[49:24] by satan
[49:25] and man's day is glorified
[49:31] not by the word of god but by the
[49:32] knowledge that he has
[49:34] remember that when you're evaluating
[49:36] ministry
[49:37] man stays glorified not by the word of
[49:39] god but by the knowledge that he has he
[49:41] said now think let that soak in he said
[49:44] when you play this tape back on this
[49:45] point here
[49:46] stop for a while and think
[49:50] he really wanted to get that across
[49:53] man's day is glorified not by the word
[49:55] of god but by the knowledge that he has
[50:00] first corinthians 4 6 and these things
[50:02] brother and i have in a figure
[50:03] transferred to myself into apollos for
[50:05] your sakes now
[50:06] he's saying it's really not just being
[50:09] apollos that i'm dealing with but it's
[50:12] the ministers
[50:13] in corinth that the people we're holding
[50:16] to is higher than the word of god
[50:19] or putting one up against the other
[50:23] and so he says i've just named apollos
[50:25] and myself because
[50:26] you're going to learn in us not to think
[50:28] of men above that which is written
[50:31] no one of you be puffed up for one
[50:34] against
[50:34] another so he says don't think more of a
[50:38] minister than is allowed by the
[50:40] scripture
[50:41] don't make him a god don't invest all
[50:43] truth in him or all knowledge or
[50:45] infallibility
[50:47] because that's above what is written and
[50:49] we've dealt with this i'm sure before
[50:51] but i'll go back over it because it fits
[50:53] here brother branham says
[50:55] talking about people who made him jesus
[50:57] christ he says because of it it forces
[50:59] me to say i'm leaving the ministries
[51:00] because there's something rose up
[51:01] amongst the people
[51:02] that's caused me to do it as i've been
[51:04] taken he said from my bracket
[51:07] been taken from my bracket what is his
[51:09] bracket it's what the word said about
[51:11] him
[51:12] right he he fulfilled that revelation 10
[51:15] 7 malachi
[51:16] 4 5 and 6. he he fulfilled that
[51:19] then in luke 17 30 was fulfilled in his
[51:22] ministry but he was not jesus christ
[51:25] right and so he says i've been taken
[51:28] from my bracket of a minister or brother
[51:30] and being called jesus christ he said
[51:33] that would bring me as antichrist and
[51:34] i'll meet god as a quitter before i
[51:35] would meet him
[51:36] as an antichrist to take away from him
[51:39] and so again
[51:40] towards the end of that where he's
[51:41] talking and dealing with this problem
[51:44] he says remember he said if you've ever
[51:45] believed me if you've ever believed me
[51:47] to be a servant of christ remember
[51:48] that's an error it's false
[51:50] he said thus saith the lord it is wrong
[51:52] he said have nothing to do with it
[51:55] he said i am your brother.
[51:59] now paul says you you puffed up for one
[52:03] he said you think above men what's
[52:04] written and then you're puffed up for
[52:05] one against another
[52:08] puffed up paul likes to use that word in
[52:10] corinth they must have been really
[52:12] arrogant
[52:15] you know i i'm for paul and here's why
[52:19] and here you had another group i'm for
[52:22] peter and this is why
[52:23] peter was with jesus another one said
[52:26] well
[52:27] i'm for christ i just don't do nothing
[52:29] with those preachers just leave them
[52:30] alone
[52:32] i just take the words of christ and paul
[52:34] says you're all babies
[52:38] right you're immature you're puffed up
[52:41] you're arrogant
[52:43] he says for verse seven for whom make it
[52:45] three to differ from another
[52:47] and what hostile that thou didst not
[52:49] receive
[52:50] now if thou just receive it why dost
[52:52] thou glory as if thou hast not
[52:54] received it it's a gift
[52:57] not an attribute all right if you're
[53:00] able to preach that way wonderful i
[53:02] i've always wanted to preach like
[53:03] brother daryl warden i've never been
[53:05] able to do it
[53:06] but it's a gift right not an attribute
[53:10] it's not something that
[53:11] it just comes from our nature but god
[53:14] places a gift in a man's life to do that
[53:16] and so we take it as that what do you
[53:18] have that was not received you did not
[53:19] receive
[53:20] he said why if thou just receive it why
[53:23] does thou glory as if thou hast not
[53:24] received it
[53:25] we could say that about the message of
[53:26] the hour if we are in the message we say
[53:28] well i'm in the message well
[53:30] what do we have that we have not
[53:31] received
[53:33] the message had to come to us for us to
[53:35] be in it
[53:36] we didn't invent it we didn't make it up
[53:40] right come from god we don't have a
[53:43] message from
[53:44] us any certain place we have a message
[53:46] from god
[53:48] come from the throne room and so if it
[53:50] comes from god then
[53:51] it's a gift what do we have that we did
[53:53] not receive
[53:54] and verse 8 he says now you're full now
[53:56] you're rich
[53:58] you've reigned as kings without us he
[54:00] said and i would to god that you did
[54:02] reign that we also might reign with you
[54:05] for i think that god has said set forth
[54:08] us the apostles last
[54:10] as as it were appointed to death
[54:14] for we are made a spectacle unto the
[54:16] world and to angels
[54:18] and to men and paul is relating to a
[54:22] something they would understand and
[54:24] called the roman spectacle which was a
[54:26] part of the roman games
[54:28] where the gladiators would be brought
[54:30] out in the morning and
[54:32] they would have armor on and have swords
[54:34] and they would fight against the wild
[54:36] beasts
[54:37] and the ones that survived would have a
[54:39] pretty good chance of beating the animal
[54:41] the lion or whatever and they would go
[54:42] back
[54:43] but then at noon time they would bring
[54:44] out certain ones that would be brought
[54:46] out naked
[54:48] with nothing to defend themselves with
[54:52] these were appointed to death they were
[54:55] the ones that
[54:56] they just wanted to get rid of they were
[54:58] tired of feeding them
[55:00] so they'd bring them out into the arena
[55:02] at noon time and then they would set the
[55:04] wild beasts on them and watch them and
[55:06] for entertainment
[55:07] get torn apart and paul says that
[55:12] god has made the apostles like those
[55:14] noonday
[55:16] spectacles those gladiators that had to
[55:19] go out and fight the wild beasts and and
[55:21] for sport demons tore them up
[55:26] and the world tore them up and spit on
[55:28] them and put them to death and
[55:29] everything else
[55:30] and became their death become the
[55:31] entertainment for the masses he said god
[55:34] has
[55:34] put us in that place we're made a
[55:38] spectacle into the world to angels
[55:40] and to men and he goes on to say we are
[55:42] fools for christ's sake
[55:45] but you're wise in christ we are weak
[55:48] but you're strong you're honorable but
[55:50] we are despised
[55:51] and this presents a different view of
[55:54] ministry than what the pharisees had
[55:57] and a different view than what the
[55:58] denominations had in a different view
[56:02] than what many people today have
[56:05] and a minister is a fool for christ's
[56:07] sake
[56:08] sometimes he's got to be the bad person
[56:12] and say things that he doesn't want to
[56:13] say why he's a fool for
[56:16] christ's sake but you're wise in christ
[56:19] sometimes the minister's got to speak so
[56:23] sure of things that he can't prove
[56:28] he's got to stand there and declare
[56:30] there is a heaven there's a hell
[56:34] you either going to one or the other
[56:38] right he's got he got to speak of things
[56:40] that are more you know
[56:41] whenever someone gets up and talks about
[56:43] the economy they can say well it could
[56:44] be this way it could be that way
[56:46] this is my educated opinion we have to
[56:48] speak of eternal things
[56:50] as if we are absolutely sure that they
[56:53] are true
[56:56] and he says speakers the oracles of god
[56:58] as if it was god himself what is it
[57:00] we're made fools for christ's sake i
[57:02] remember years ago i
[57:03] shared the church age book with a man
[57:05] from the church of christ and
[57:08] and he was a good man but he uh was a
[57:10] county tax collector actually
[57:12] and i shared it with him because i told
[57:13] him i was going to convert the publicans
[57:17] tax collectors and i shared this with
[57:21] him and he was a good man but
[57:22] he read it he read the whole book and he
[57:24] called him and brought it back to me he
[57:25] said
[57:26] he got a lot of good things to say he
[57:28] said but he speaks with such authority
[57:31] he said how does he speak with such
[57:32] authority
[57:34] he just couldn't wrap his mind wrap his
[57:36] mind around that
[57:37] why could he say these things as if why
[57:39] we're fools for christ
[57:42] he said he shouldn't talk like that he
[57:43] shouldn't talk with such authority but
[57:45] remember what they said about jesus
[57:46] he said he don't speak like the scribes
[57:48] do well it could be this way it might be
[57:50] this way he said this
[57:51] he said is the day of salvation
[57:56] he said i am the way the truth and the
[57:58] life no man comes to the father but by
[58:00] me that's a bold statement
[58:02] and on some level as ministers we're
[58:05] truth declarers that's
[58:07] that's what we we have to do is declare
[58:09] the truth and not just
[58:11] make it where it'll fit in with the
[58:13] modern culture that we live in
[58:15] we're fools for christ's sake but you're
[58:17] wise in christ we are weak but you're
[58:19] strong you're honorable but we are
[58:21] despised
[58:23] brother madam says then to the world he
[58:25] was a fool speaking of
[58:26] paul and to the church he was a fool
[58:29] he said to the denominational church he
[58:31] was actually a fool
[58:33] he said that's what he said he'd become
[58:34] a fool he's a fool to those people but
[58:36] he was the instrument that god used
[58:40] and i just pray that god would would
[58:42] help me in this way
[58:43] listen because you can't read it on the
[58:44] board but he said he he was the
[58:46] instrument that god used
[58:48] to hold the church together
[58:51] to hold the body as it was in that day
[58:54] together
[58:55] he'd become a fool for that for the sake
[58:57] of that
[59:00] god help me to be a fool then that don't
[59:04] just apply to ministry that applies to
[59:05] all of us
[59:07] we we become an instrument that god uses
[59:10] even though we look foolish to hold the
[59:12] church together
[59:15] what a good definition that is first
[59:18] corinthians 4 11 even unto this present
[59:20] hour we both hunger and thirst
[59:23] and are naked and are buffeted
[59:27] and have no certain dwelling place
[59:31] labor working with our own hands being
[59:33] reviled we bless being persecuted we
[59:35] suffer it
[59:36] we don't realize how much we owe to
[59:37] those who have gone on before us
[59:40] we can have church here today because
[59:42] some because christians over
[59:44] centuries died to meet together so we
[59:47] get to have church we take it lightly
[59:51] but they died for that privilege of
[59:54] being able to come together and in some
[59:55] foreign countries in places they still
[59:57] do
[59:59] millions have died for the privilege of
[1:00:01] being able to sit with their brothers
[1:00:02] and sisters and hear the word of god
[1:00:05] and so he says in in this time he said
[1:00:08] we
[1:00:09] labor he said we work with our own hands
[1:00:10] being reviled we blessed being
[1:00:11] persecuted we suffer it being defamed we
[1:00:13] entreat
[1:00:14] he said we are made as the filth of the
[1:00:16] world
[1:00:18] are the all-scouring of all things and
[1:00:20] to this day that
[1:00:21] filth and off-scaring that's what what
[1:00:23] is not even useful
[1:00:24] to be burnt by the heathens as a
[1:00:27] sacrifice
[1:00:29] the heathens would use about anything as
[1:00:31] a sacrifice
[1:00:33] even it alludes also to a custom that
[1:00:36] they had that they would bring out
[1:00:38] the very worst men in the city and they
[1:00:41] call that the filth of the city the off
[1:00:43] scouring of the city
[1:00:45] probably some of my relatives in there
[1:00:46] somewhere but they'd bring them out and
[1:00:49] and they would put them
[1:00:52] at a certain time of the feast day there
[1:00:53] were certain gods that could only be
[1:00:55] satisfied by human sacrifice
[1:00:57] so they would bring the very worst
[1:00:59] people in the city the drunk on the
[1:01:00] street
[1:01:01] bring him in and sacrifice him to the
[1:01:03] gods
[1:01:04] and paul said that's what we've been
[1:01:06] made like
[1:01:08] like a sacrifice that like the lowest
[1:01:10] man in the city like a sacrifice that
[1:01:12] even the gods wouldn't accept
[1:01:16] paul said he had to forget everything he
[1:01:18] knew
[1:01:22] to have christ
[1:01:25] you know our mind gets in our way of
[1:01:28] accepting christ
[1:01:30] we begin to think and begin to think
[1:01:32] well you know
[1:01:34] i don't know if that's true i don't know
[1:01:36] you know people can talk their way out
[1:01:37] of anything
[1:01:38] i'm i'm reading i haven't finished it
[1:01:40] yet but i'm reading a a book
[1:01:42] an old book and it's it's a case to be
[1:01:45] made that somebody made about 50 years
[1:01:47] after napoleon
[1:01:49] left the scene and someone is a member
[1:01:52] of the clergy wrote a book
[1:01:53] making the case for the fact that
[1:01:55] napoleon was a legend
[1:01:57] that he never existed and what it was is
[1:02:01] this satirical work where
[1:02:02] the man makes that case because he says
[1:02:05] that
[1:02:06] he says i can prove to you he said these
[1:02:08] accounts are unreliable
[1:02:10] the things that napoleon did a man
[1:02:12] couldn't do
[1:02:14] it's too supernatural and people do the
[1:02:18] same thing today with the message
[1:02:22] and he basically by the end of that they
[1:02:23] said many people who read that book
[1:02:25] really come out thinking
[1:02:26] and it wasn't his purpose at all but
[1:02:28] many people come out thinking
[1:02:29] napoleon didn't even exist can't prove
[1:02:32] it to me
[1:02:33] and people think the same way about
[1:02:34] jesus in the same way about the word of
[1:02:36] god but
[1:02:37] but it still doesn't make it any less
[1:02:39] true
[1:02:41] you can talk your way out of anything
[1:02:44] right but our mind gets in the way and
[1:02:45] paul says i had to forget all these
[1:02:47] things and
[1:02:48] one of the early church fathers who knew
[1:02:50] paul wrote later about him and said his
[1:02:52] words indeed
[1:02:53] seem to be those of a simple and
[1:02:56] innocent and a rustic
[1:02:57] man who knows neither how to frame
[1:03:00] nor to avoid wilds in other words he
[1:03:02] just wasn't good at
[1:03:04] at putting things and i think paul was
[1:03:07] wonderful at how he put things but he
[1:03:08] was blunt he was bold
[1:03:11] he said his words were like an innocent
[1:03:13] and a rustic man
[1:03:15] he said but wherever you look there are
[1:03:17] thunderbolts
[1:03:21] and what he means by that is paul spoke
[1:03:24] with power
[1:03:26] and he backed it up and he stands up
[1:03:29] here and he says if any man
[1:03:31] says anything different than what i've
[1:03:32] said let him be accursed
[1:03:35] why could he say that because he of the
[1:03:37] uniqueness of his ministry
[1:03:39] and so paul begins to deal with that in
[1:03:41] the last part of this
[1:03:42] chapter 4 or in this next part that
[1:03:44] we're going through now in verse 14 he
[1:03:46] said i write not these things to shame
[1:03:48] you
[1:03:48] but as my beloved sons i warn you
[1:03:51] for though you have 10 000 instructors
[1:03:53] in christ yet have you not many fathers
[1:03:56] for in christ jesus have i begotten you
[1:03:58] the gospel he said that's the uniqueness
[1:04:00] of my ministry
[1:04:01] you're a product of my message
[1:04:04] and we have a prophet on this day we are
[1:04:06] a product of that message
[1:04:09] that's a unique ministry none of us as
[1:04:11] ministers can take that place
[1:04:14] so in our attitude about ministers we
[1:04:16] don't raise one man above another in the
[1:04:18] flesh but we do recognize that god has
[1:04:20] different callings for different people
[1:04:22] and no one can fit that calling except
[1:04:24] the messenger of the hour
[1:04:27] that's the stars that held in his hand
[1:04:29] that's the one
[1:04:30] the seven golden candlesticks that's the
[1:04:32] one that was there with him and
[1:04:34] the the the lamp stand to the h
[1:04:37] and paul says you don't have many
[1:04:39] fathers
[1:04:40] i've begotten you through the gospel he
[1:04:43] says verse 16 wherefore i beseech you be
[1:04:46] followers of me word followers is
[1:04:48] literally imitators
[1:04:50] the word is minds
[1:04:57] brother branham says this he said you're
[1:04:58] going to follow somebody
[1:05:01] he said you remember that you're going
[1:05:03] to follow somebody
[1:05:05] say i don't follow anybody brother perry
[1:05:07] green you tell a story about a man that
[1:05:09] insisted he didn't follow a man he said
[1:05:10] he come to find out he followed his wife
[1:05:16] people who don't follow a man true but
[1:05:19] you're going to be a follower of
[1:05:20] somebody
[1:05:23] he says you just remember that he said
[1:05:25] you're going to follow somebody the way
[1:05:26] you follow that person
[1:05:27] he said is be sure that who this person
[1:05:30] is following
[1:05:32] you can't follow somebody who can't be
[1:05:34] led
[1:05:36] right and so he says be sure who this
[1:05:39] person is following
[1:05:40] paul one time said be followers of me as
[1:05:43] i am of christ
[1:05:45] in other words just as i follow christ
[1:05:48] you follow me
[1:05:52] and he says and speaking of paul and
[1:05:55] brother branham calls him the pattern he
[1:05:57] said his manner of ministering
[1:05:59] and i want us to notice that because
[1:06:00] we've had a pattern
[1:06:02] paul set the pattern even for brother
[1:06:04] branham
[1:06:06] he had to brother brown said that he did
[1:06:09] for all other ages
[1:06:10] but what we've had in this day at the
[1:06:12] end time is someone who followed the
[1:06:13] pattern exactly
[1:06:15] in in their manner of ministry so we
[1:06:17] have a pattern
[1:06:18] a modern day way of looking at what
[1:06:20] paul's message and what his manner of
[1:06:23] ministering was brother branham followed
[1:06:25] that pattern
[1:06:26] so we have a unique insight into that
[1:06:29] maybe other ages kind of lost that
[1:06:31] pattern we've got
[1:06:32] it we're able to do that and so
[1:06:35] we could say we're imitators of the
[1:06:36] messenger in that way we are imitators
[1:06:38] he said be an imitator of me
[1:06:40] not an imitator of how i hold my bible
[1:06:43] not an imitate imitator of how i speak
[1:06:46] but an imitator of my manner of ministry
[1:06:50] he said his manner of ministering set
[1:06:53] the pattern
[1:06:54] manner of ministering that's not just
[1:06:56] doctrine
[1:06:57] but it's how you handle the word and how
[1:06:59] you handle yourself
[1:07:02] so when we look at ministers
[1:07:05] and i thought this was important to
[1:07:07] bring to us as a church because
[1:07:09] when we look at ministers when we
[1:07:10] evaluate ministries when we
[1:07:12] haven't asked what should our attitude
[1:07:14] be towards a minister
[1:07:16] well it should be more than just he
[1:07:18] brings me the word yes that's true
[1:07:20] but it should be that he his manner of
[1:07:24] ministering matches
[1:07:26] paul's how was that he denies himself
[1:07:30] he follows the word he doesn't
[1:07:33] he doesn't do things to his own benefit
[1:07:37] right all these things that paul talks
[1:07:39] about that he did
[1:07:40] he said this is what we do then we
[1:07:42] become imitators of that
[1:07:45] right not not in a carnal way but but in
[1:07:48] a way of saying lord help me
[1:07:50] to match the pattern now
[1:07:53] so he said he was to be the pattern of
[1:07:55] all future messengers
[1:07:56] and actually sets the pattern he said
[1:07:59] all future messengers would aspire to
[1:08:01] and actually sets the pattern for every
[1:08:03] true minister of god
[1:08:05] though he would not attain to such
[1:08:07] heights in the prophetic realm as did
[1:08:08] paul and paul in first corinthians 4 17
[1:08:11] said for this cause
[1:08:13] have i sent unto you timotheus
[1:08:17] for what cause so you can see what my
[1:08:20] pattern looks like
[1:08:23] be followers of me because i'm going to
[1:08:25] send you someone who imitates me
[1:08:28] right someone who mimics me in ministry
[1:08:32] timothy who is my beloved son and
[1:08:34] faithful in the lord who shall bring you
[1:08:35] into remembrance of my ways
[1:08:38] my ways how i handle the word how i
[1:08:41] handle the people
[1:08:43] right which be in christ as i teach
[1:08:45] everywhere in every
[1:08:47] church he's an imitator of me and so i'm
[1:08:50] going to send him
[1:08:52] and it's important because he didn't
[1:08:55] just say
[1:08:56] this letter will be sufficient but he
[1:08:58] said i'm going to send timothy
[1:09:00] because he's going to show you he's
[1:09:02] going to be an example to you
[1:09:04] of my manner of ministry god helped me
[1:09:07] to do that as a minister
[1:09:09] but that's the way we should think about
[1:09:10] ministry how does his ministry match up
[1:09:13] to the apostle paul how does he match up
[1:09:14] to the messenger of this age
[1:09:16] not in prophetic utterance not in the
[1:09:19] heights
[1:09:20] of of revelation and visions and things
[1:09:22] like that but the way he treats people
[1:09:25] the way he treats the church the way he
[1:09:27] treats the word
[1:09:29] i hope i'm not boring you tonight
[1:09:33] so he says he's an imitator of me i've
[1:09:35] sent him this for this cause
[1:09:37] and this is what paul told timothy in
[1:09:39] second timothy 2 2
[1:09:41] he says the things that thou hast heard
[1:09:43] of me
[1:09:44] and now listen and this is where people
[1:09:47] get off
[1:09:48] because we've all heard personal
[1:09:49] testimonies right and i'll even tell
[1:09:51] sometimes i'll tell one but it's just
[1:09:54] that it's a personal testimony
[1:09:56] so paul tells timothy specifically he
[1:09:58] said the things you have heard of me
[1:09:59] among many witnesses
[1:10:02] and the reason he's telling him that is
[1:10:03] because no one could then say that
[1:10:06] timothy you're making that up he only
[1:10:09] told that to you
[1:10:11] but paul says commit the things that
[1:10:14] you've heard of me among many witnesses
[1:10:17] in other words you heard me say this
[1:10:18] publicly
[1:10:20] right you know what he's saying say what
[1:10:23] the tapes say
[1:10:26] that's what he's saying and people will
[1:10:28] say that and they don't they won't say
[1:10:30] what the tapes actually say
[1:10:34] but because just repeating it doesn't
[1:10:35] mean you do it
[1:10:37] right but now he's saying timothy
[1:10:41] say the things that i said publicly
[1:10:44] not just the the stories that you heard
[1:10:47] don't build doctrines on the stories
[1:10:49] that you heard but say the things that
[1:10:51] you heard of me among many witnesses
[1:10:53] the same commit thou to faithful men
[1:10:56] who shall be able to teach others also
[1:11:00] teach what you've heard me say publicly
[1:11:04] brother branham says in the church age
[1:11:06] book again he said in every age we have
[1:11:07] exactly the same pattern
[1:11:09] that is why the light comes through some
[1:11:11] god-given messenger in a certain area
[1:11:13] and then from that messenger there
[1:11:15] spreads the light
[1:11:16] through the ministry of others who have
[1:11:17] been faithfully taught
[1:11:19] he said but of course all those who go
[1:11:21] out don't always learn how necessary it
[1:11:23] is to speak only
[1:11:25] what the messenger has spoken
[1:11:29] let's go on down to the end of this real
[1:11:30] quickly
[1:11:32] i won't spend much more time verse 18
[1:11:34] now some are puffed up as though i would
[1:11:36] not come to you
[1:11:38] but i will come to you shortly you talk
[1:11:40] about a return ministry now paul was
[1:11:42] coming back
[1:11:43] but he wasn't dead yet but
[1:11:46] he said i'm going to come back you know
[1:11:48] and people think they want
[1:11:50] a messenger to come back but you wonder
[1:11:51] what would happen if one did
[1:11:54] because paul kind of puts it bluntly to
[1:11:56] them he said i will come to you shortly
[1:11:57] if the lord will
[1:11:59] and we'll know not the speech of them
[1:12:01] which are puffed up
[1:12:02] but the power paul says i'm about to
[1:12:06] bring the hammer down
[1:12:09] i'm going to show up and you're going to
[1:12:10] have to prove
[1:12:12] huh what you're talking about anybody
[1:12:14] can talk
[1:12:16] right so paul says there's more to my
[1:12:20] ministry than words
[1:12:24] because verse 20 says for the kingdom of
[1:12:26] god is not in word but in power
[1:12:30] another place he says word only it's not
[1:12:31] in word only it's not just that but it's
[1:12:33] power and almost anybody can talk but
[1:12:37] few can manifest the power of god in
[1:12:38] their lives
[1:12:39] and this was the age of ananias and
[1:12:40] sapphira this is the time when the
[1:12:42] people knew
[1:12:43] he could back it up that the apostles
[1:12:46] had the authority
[1:12:49] right and and there's an authority that
[1:12:52] comes with the word
[1:12:53] but we that authority is in our lives
[1:12:56] can we manifest the power of god in our
[1:12:57] lives it's not just talk
[1:13:00] verse 21 what will he
[1:13:04] i come into you with a rod or in love
[1:13:09] and in the spirit of meekness now
[1:13:12] the lord will and i'm not sure how we'll
[1:13:14] handle it but the lord willing we'll get
[1:13:15] into chapter 5. next week and
[1:13:19] paul deals with some hard things in the
[1:13:21] church
[1:13:22] in the corinthian church but he says you
[1:13:25] want me to come with a rod
[1:13:27] or in love and a spirit of meekness and
[1:13:29] and what he's saying is your attitude
[1:13:30] towards this letter
[1:13:32] will determine how i come what my
[1:13:36] attitude will be when i come
[1:13:39] you know we're going to make mistakes
[1:13:43] we're going to bear too long with some
[1:13:44] and not bear long enough with others
[1:13:46] and as a church you make mistakes as
[1:13:48] individuals you make me say you're going
[1:13:50] to make mistakes
[1:13:53] but our attitudes when we find out what
[1:13:55] the mistake is
[1:13:57] when we find out what the word says
[1:13:58] about something our reaction
[1:14:00] to that is determines
[1:14:04] how god deals with us
[1:14:07] you see paul's not the only one he
[1:14:09] wasn't the only one coming to corinth
[1:14:10] jesus
[1:14:11] is coming
[1:14:14] he's coming and and we live in that day
[1:14:17] we live at the time when the day of the
[1:14:19] lord is at hand this is the day of man
[1:14:20] but
[1:14:21] there's coming a day when it's the day
[1:14:22] of the lord the lord's day
[1:14:24] the lord's day is coming and he'll judge
[1:14:26] everything according to the way it ought
[1:14:28] to be
[1:14:28] he sees everything how it should be
[1:14:31] right and so the day of the lord is
[1:14:33] coming and
[1:14:33] and so we our attitude towards the word
[1:14:35] today will determine
[1:14:37] what his attitude towards us is
[1:14:40] when he comes
[1:14:46] what is paul doing he's laying an
[1:14:47] example paul laid an example in
[1:14:49] corinthians
[1:14:51] of what our attitude should be towards
[1:14:53] ministry how we should think what our
[1:14:55] mindset should be
[1:14:57] towards ministry not to elevate one
[1:14:58] against the other not to puff one up
[1:15:00] against another
[1:15:04] but to say i realize that the real value
[1:15:06] is in the word
[1:15:08] and the power of god manifested in the
[1:15:10] life
[1:15:13] you see as ministers and i think we
[1:15:14] could say this as christians too
[1:15:17] we have to recognize that everything we
[1:15:20] have is god's we are ministers and
[1:15:22] stewards that's what we're doing here on
[1:15:23] this earth
[1:15:24] we're low slaves to god and we're
[1:15:26] stewards we
[1:15:28] god's given us something whether it's
[1:15:29] money or or a talent of some kind he's
[1:15:32] given us some ability he's giving you
[1:15:34] something you say well i can't i don't
[1:15:36] know much about that
[1:15:37] i don't have much but you have something
[1:15:40] whatever that thing is has been given to
[1:15:42] you as a steward
[1:15:44] and you have an opportunity to give you
[1:15:46] have an opportunity to
[1:15:47] to love you have an opportunity to to
[1:15:50] reach out
[1:15:51] or to just hold it in bury it under the
[1:15:53] earth
[1:15:56] david livingston the great missionary to
[1:15:58] africa and musicians go ahead and come
[1:15:59] i'm finished this evening
[1:16:02] but the great missionary to africa
[1:16:06] he said this he said i place no value on
[1:16:08] anything i have or may possess
[1:16:11] except in relation to the kingdom of god
[1:16:14] he said if anything will advance the
[1:16:16] interests of the kingdom it shall be
[1:16:18] given away or kept
[1:16:20] only as by giving or keeping it
[1:16:23] i shall most promote the glory of him to
[1:16:27] whom i owe all my hopes
[1:16:29] in time or eternity paul put it this way
[1:16:32] he said for me to live is christ
[1:16:34] to die is gain if i give it away or i
[1:16:38] keep it
[1:16:40] how will that promote his glory that's
[1:16:43] what i want
[1:16:44] i've given everything up i can't go back
[1:16:47] to the problem with ministers that go
[1:16:49] back
[1:16:49] is that they haven't sold out because if
[1:16:52] you
[1:16:53] if you sold out like paul did you can't
[1:16:54] go back
[1:16:56] paul couldn't become a pharisee again he
[1:16:59] doesn't burn those bridges
[1:17:02] he wasn't going back to denominations he
[1:17:04] wasn't going back to the old life
[1:17:07] that was all gone why because everything
[1:17:10] that he had and everything that he was
[1:17:12] was in the service of god brother
[1:17:14] darrell said something
[1:17:15] sunday night that just really struck me
[1:17:18] when he talked about how that
[1:17:20] we don't give a part of our life to the
[1:17:23] church our life
[1:17:24] is the church our life is church and
[1:17:27] that's not this building
[1:17:29] but that's the body of christ god help
[1:17:32] me to be that way
[1:17:33] place no value on anything other than
[1:17:35] the glory that it can bring god
[1:17:37] that's what we want in our lives isn't
[1:17:39] it amen let's bow our heads together
[1:17:41] heavenly father thank you for the
[1:17:43] service tonight i i pray that in some
[1:17:45] way i know it's different lord in a
[1:17:47] teaching message but
[1:17:48] i pray god that in some way you would
[1:17:50] just move into our hearts and begin to
[1:17:53] water the word that's been planted
[1:17:56] help me lord as a minister these words
[1:17:59] surely apply to me if they apply to no
[1:18:01] one else i must be a minister and a
[1:18:03] steward
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:05] a minister lord an under under row
[1:18:08] under rower a person who's chained to
[1:18:11] the work that i'm doing
[1:18:13] by chains of love i pray it would be so
[1:18:16] in my life lord
[1:18:18] to one day you see fit from maybe i'm
[1:18:21] grown too weak to keep the ore going
[1:18:23] like i should i just get taken out of
[1:18:27] the way
[1:18:28] and another takes my place if you tarry
[1:18:30] lord that it may happen
[1:18:32] but lord i want to give everything that
[1:18:34] i've got
[1:18:36] may we be that way as christians
[1:18:39] whatever value we place in something may
[1:18:41] be the value of
[1:18:43] giving glory to god
[1:18:44] [Music]
[1:18:46] i don't want it if it won't bring glory
[1:18:48] to you i'm not going to have it
[1:18:51] if it's just you know maybe i could get
[1:18:54] it
[1:18:55] but by fighting to get it i i mar my
[1:18:57] testimony
[1:18:59] help me lord not not to be selfish
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:04] we could we could conduct ourselves in a
[1:19:06] way such a way as ministers that would
[1:19:08] that would make it where we could we
[1:19:11] could have
[1:19:12] more but we'd have to give up our
[1:19:15] conscience
[1:19:16] we'd have to give up what we know is
[1:19:18] right we'd have to do things in the
[1:19:20] wrong way and we know that when it comes
[1:19:22] to ministry when it comes to the word of
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] it's never right to do the supposedly
[1:19:26] right thing the wrong way
[1:19:30] it matters how we handle the word
[1:19:33] you will only accept a sacrifice made in
[1:19:36] a certain manner
[1:19:38] lord the only door the only place we can
[1:19:41] worship is at the door of christ jesus
[1:19:44] we thank you
[1:19:45] lord for that and we thank you for
[1:19:47] making the way clear for us i pray god
[1:19:50] that you would help us
[1:19:51] each one to give up all things only
[1:19:54] those things keep only those things that
[1:19:56] would bring glory to god by us keeping
[1:19:57] them
[1:19:58] i pray you grant it now in jesus name
[1:20:02] amen amen let's stand together and sing
[1:20:05] this
[1:20:05] i want to live
[1:20:09] the way he wants
