[1:00:22] branham's text

[1:00:26] in colossians 1
[1:00:28] and verse 25
[1:00:30] we want to look here paul writing to the
[1:00:32] church
[1:00:34] he says whereof i am made a minister
[1:00:36] according to the dispensation of god
[1:00:39] which is given to me for you
[1:00:42] to fulfill the word of god how many
[1:00:44] knows that brother said the mind of
[1:00:46] christ is to fulfill his word amen to
[1:00:49] fulfill the word of god even the mystery
[1:00:52] which has been hid from ages and from
[1:00:55] generations
[1:00:56] but now is made manifest to his saints
[1:01:00] to whom god would make known what is the
[1:01:02] riches of the glory of the mystery among
[1:01:05] the gentiles
[1:01:06] here it is
[1:01:07] which is christ
[1:01:09] in you
[1:01:10] the hope of glory amen to make known
[1:01:13] what the riches of the glory of the
[1:01:15] mystery among the gentiles
[1:01:17] which is christ in you
[1:01:20] the hope of glory we ask the lord this
[1:01:21] evening to add the blessing to the
[1:01:23] reading of his word as you can be seated
[1:01:25] here this afternoon
[1:01:26] for a few moments here tonight i want to
[1:01:28] speak to you if i can if i title this
[1:01:30] thought tonight i want to speak to you
[1:01:32] on living images of true christianity
[1:01:36] living images of true christianity i i
[1:01:38] tell you if there's ever been a time to
[1:01:41] be identified as a christian i believe
[1:01:43] we're now living in the hour we should
[1:01:45] be identified as christians and brother
[1:01:47] branham would preach a message right
[1:01:48] around this time of year in 1959 he
[1:01:51] would title that sermon images of christ
[1:01:54] 1959 images of christ and he says i want
[1:01:56] to take for a text tonight just for a
[1:01:58] short time he said the subject of images
[1:02:01] of christ he said and i want for a
[1:02:03] subject what does it take to make a
[1:02:06] christian amen what does it take to make
[1:02:08] a christian now we know that according
[1:02:10] to colossians 1 paul writing to the
[1:02:12] church he says that christ would be in
[1:02:14] you the hope of glory now we know that
[1:02:16] paul amen was a church age messenger who
[1:02:19] was preaching a message of the gospel of
[1:02:21] the truth which was of christ and we
[1:02:23] know that according to paul it meant
[1:02:25] that he would have a ministry but
[1:02:27] brother branham would come and he would
[1:02:29] not preach something different than paul
[1:02:31] but he would preach the same thing paul
[1:02:32] preached and he would restore to the
[1:02:34] church amen everything that had been
[1:02:36] lost to the dark ages and we believe
[1:02:38] amen that the message of malachi 4 will
[1:02:41] be amen a message of restoration now
[1:02:44] it's not a mystery tonight amen that
[1:02:46] we're living in the hour when all things
[1:02:48] have been restored right and we believe
[1:02:50] that the message has restored the way we
[1:02:52] baptize we believe it's restored the way
[1:02:54] we we conduct our services it's restored
[1:02:57] the way we we
[1:02:58] conduct our communion services it's
[1:03:00] restored the way that we dress and amen
[1:03:02] the way we preach the message of the
[1:03:04] hour amen is a message of restoration
[1:03:07] now i happen to believe amen that the
[1:03:09] message did not just restore to us the
[1:03:11] truth of water baptism or the truth of
[1:03:14] the godhead or the truth of
[1:03:15] predestination
[1:03:16] amen but i believe the message of the
[1:03:18] hour has restored to us he meant what it
[1:03:21] means to be a true christian now amen
[1:03:23] i'll just share a few tapes with you
[1:03:25] that i've been studying in i'm actually
[1:03:27] pulling from several of them tonight one
[1:03:28] of them is images of christ iran
[1:03:30] preaches christianity versus idolatry a
[1:03:33] christ is the mystery of god revealed is
[1:03:35] your life worthy of the gospel amen then
[1:03:37] he'll preach a message called the
[1:03:38] oddball and if you listen to those
[1:03:40] sermons amen you'll be hearing the
[1:03:42] prophet of god dealing with he meant a
[1:03:44] christian life now it is your life
[1:03:46] worthy of the gospel in his prayer he
[1:03:47] said lord jesus any man physically or
[1:03:49] woman or child can move back the pages
[1:03:52] of this bible but there's no one can
[1:03:54] reveal it but you so i pray lord of
[1:03:57] taken this text that's placed upon my
[1:03:58] heart he been descended out across the
[1:04:01] nation for the people that they might
[1:04:03] know what type of life is required of
[1:04:05] them to live amen then there's a life
[1:04:07] amen and it's a life that god is
[1:04:09] requiring the church to live he said for
[1:04:12] so many has asked me is the christian
[1:04:14] life he meant a life of church service
[1:04:17] he says is it helping the poor and the
[1:04:19] needy or is it a constant a member or is
[1:04:22] it a loyal loyalty to the church and he
[1:04:24] said such questions he said now father
[1:04:26] may the correct answer come tonight
[1:04:28] through these words as we make an
[1:04:29] endeavor he meant to bring them to the
[1:04:32] people another place in question answer
[1:04:33] 64. he said we have a symbol tonight
[1:04:36] lord for no other purpose but to know
[1:04:38] how and to learn how by the help to be
[1:04:41] better christians amen how many could
[1:04:43] say that's why i'm here tonight amen is
[1:04:45] to leave here a better christian now a
[1:04:47] prophet of god told us amen you're going
[1:04:49] to leave one way or the other you'll
[1:04:50] either leave better amen or you'll leave
[1:04:53] worse and i'll say this i happen to
[1:04:55] believe amen that we have received a
[1:04:57] message in this generation amen that we
[1:04:59] don't have to leave one service the same
[1:05:02] way we came he said we don't have to
[1:05:03] leave one meeting the same way we came i
[1:05:06] believe we received a message that has
[1:05:08] the power he meant to make us more than
[1:05:10] loyal church members i believe we've
[1:05:12] received a message amen that has the
[1:05:14] power to make us more amen than a bunch
[1:05:16] of people that gather us together three
[1:05:18] times a week amen and studies a few
[1:05:20] ideas amen but we have received a
[1:05:23] message and then that's not a false
[1:05:24] message but it's a real message and the
[1:05:27] thinking the age we're living in he
[1:05:29] meant that the world is hungry for
[1:05:30] something real the prophet said i'm
[1:05:32] hungry for real thanks i'm hungry to see
[1:05:35] a church stand amen in this last days
[1:05:38] i'm hungry to see a good old-fashioned
[1:05:40] amen pentecostal body of christ rise in
[1:05:43] the power of the holy ghost calling
[1:05:45] right right and wrong wrong my heart
[1:05:47] longs to see it he said there's a little
[1:05:49] remnant that's waiting he said they're
[1:05:51] not waiting to see how big we can make
[1:05:53] our denomination how well we can dress
[1:05:56] how big a church we can build amen
[1:05:58] they're waiting to see us manifest amen
[1:06:01] the life of the lord jesus christ in
[1:06:03] love and in power amen i'll stay i'll go
[1:06:05] a step further and say amen they're not
[1:06:07] waiting to see how much we can how much
[1:06:09] we can learn and how best we can
[1:06:11] approach amen the mysteries of this
[1:06:13] message amen but the world is looking to
[1:06:15] see something real amen i think it's
[1:06:17] time to be quit being just church
[1:06:19] members i think it's time to quit just
[1:06:21] coming together and say well we believe
[1:06:22] a message amen but i believe that the
[1:06:25] time has come amen that the father must
[1:06:27] be glorified again and he's not going to
[1:06:29] raise up paul and he's not going to
[1:06:31] raise up peter and james he's not going
[1:06:33] to bring brother branham back he meant
[1:06:35] to manifest the lion amen but he is
[1:06:38] raising up a pentecostal body in the
[1:06:40] power of the holy ghost who will not
[1:06:42] just manifest him on sunday morning will
[1:06:44] not just manifest him in a meeting amen
[1:06:46] but anywhere anytime anyplace under any
[1:06:49] condition amen they will manifest him as
[1:06:52] a born-again son and daughter of god
[1:06:54] listen i'm not just a preacher amen
[1:06:56] before i was a preacher i was a
[1:06:57] christian amen you're not just a church
[1:07:00] member amen before you're a church
[1:07:01] member you're a christian well we might
[1:07:03] as well preach amen you're not just a
[1:07:05] deacon and a sunday school teacher amen
[1:07:07] and an evangelist ain't that your
[1:07:09] priority up on the earth he managed to
[1:07:11] be a christian amen and to manifest
[1:07:13] jesus christ amen with the same love and
[1:07:16] the same zeal and the same power that he
[1:07:19] manifested when he walked here upon the
[1:07:21] earth we have not come together to see
[1:07:23] who can be the best preacher who can be
[1:07:25] the best singer who can build the
[1:07:27] biggest church who can get the greatest
[1:07:29] following we have come here ain't meant
[1:07:31] to let a dying world amen in a dying
[1:07:33] generation know that we have received a
[1:07:36] message of life and it's the message of
[1:07:38] the son of man that has returned in this
[1:07:40] generation my we're not here ain't meant
[1:07:43] to manifest our abilities and to
[1:07:45] manifest our talents and to manifest our
[1:07:47] ideas we have been placed here amen to
[1:07:50] manifest jesus christ which under this
[1:07:52] message amen is a restoration amen i'll
[1:07:55] tell you this i don't believe god has
[1:07:57] called us amen to stay where we are i
[1:07:59] believe he's called us to advance
[1:08:02] come on i believe every service ought to
[1:08:04] be an advancement the problem of god
[1:08:06] said this is the advancement of the
[1:08:08] gospel amen i believe every service
[1:08:11] listen i believe that you ought to be
[1:08:13] further tonight than you were sunday
[1:08:15] morning and i believe next service
[1:08:16] you're in you ought to be further than
[1:08:18] and you are here tonight amen this is
[1:08:20] not he meant a bunch of people gathered
[1:08:22] in a building they've been talking about
[1:08:24] what god used to do amen and becoming
[1:08:26] stale amen by past experiences but this
[1:08:30] is the restoration of truth which is
[1:08:32] essential he meant for the church to
[1:08:34] advance the prophet said the church can
[1:08:36] never progress until it knows what's
[1:08:38] ground just progressing on and i believe
[1:08:40] that before anybody can ever move or
[1:08:43] have real confidential faith it's first
[1:08:45] they have to know amen where they stand
[1:08:48] and how to stand after they make their
[1:08:50] stand then a christian's got to know
[1:08:52] where they stand they've got to know how
[1:08:54] to make a stand and they got to know how
[1:08:56] to stand after they made the stand i
[1:08:58] believe that's essential for you cannot
[1:09:00] just head long plunge into something
[1:09:02] with faith when you don't know where
[1:09:04] you're punching he said you've got to
[1:09:06] know and if our faith is set right and
[1:09:09] in the right position amen it gives a
[1:09:11] constant satisfaction amen that's why a
[1:09:14] real christian under no matter what
[1:09:16] circumstances amen by the frank they
[1:09:18] find themselves under amen they are a
[1:09:20] real christian amen if they're sick
[1:09:22] they're a christian if they're broke
[1:09:24] they're a christian if they're happy
[1:09:26] they're a christian if the church is
[1:09:27] warm they're a christian if the church
[1:09:29] is cold they're a christian listen
[1:09:31] friends we're not a bunch of
[1:09:32] denominational amen hatched out hybrid
[1:09:35] chickens amen that don't know who our
[1:09:37] papa mama is amen we are eagles that's
[1:09:39] been born amen by the mama and papa
[1:09:42] eagle we are come here amen not to let
[1:09:44] every little thing that comes along
[1:09:46] ain't meant to move us out of our place
[1:09:48] of satisfaction amen is there anybody
[1:09:50] satisfied here tonight is there anybody
[1:09:52] satisfied with this message is there
[1:09:54] anybody satisfied with the holy ghost is
[1:09:57] there anybody satisfied amen that this
[1:09:59] day this scripture has been fulfilled in
[1:10:01] our generation i am not a dissatisfied
[1:10:04] christian i am satisfied by the message
[1:10:07] of the hour that no matter how low we
[1:10:09] are we are a christian no matter how sad
[1:10:11] we are we are a christian that's what
[1:10:14] separates you amen from 3 000 plus
[1:10:16] denominations it's no matter what you go
[1:10:19] through when you come out of it you're
[1:10:20] still a christian no matter how dark it
[1:10:23] gets you're still a christian it's a
[1:10:25] position by faith amen real confidential
[1:10:28] faith that has given us a constant
[1:10:30] satisfaction and may i say tonight amen
[1:10:33] i personally believe amen that the most
[1:10:35] solemn confession that you can make in
[1:10:37] this life is that you are a christian
[1:10:40] i don't believe the most solemn
[1:10:41] confession you can make is that you are
[1:10:43] a preacher i don't believe in those
[1:10:45] psalm confession you can make is that
[1:10:47] you preach 52 weekends out of the year
[1:10:49] or you sing 17 different conventions
[1:10:51] amen i believe that the most solemn
[1:10:53] confession ain't been that somebody can
[1:10:55] make in this generation and an untoward
[1:10:58] generation when they're a bunch of god
[1:11:00] denied ain't been fussing fighting
[1:11:02] people amen somebody can be alive on a
[1:11:04] city amen that is on a hillside and then
[1:11:07] they cannot be put out by the pressures
[1:11:09] of the day they're living in amen let me
[1:11:11] just go and say it i am a christian i'm
[1:11:14] proud to be a christian i'm honored to
[1:11:16] be a christian i'm thankful to be
[1:11:18] identified amen as a follower of jesus
[1:11:21] christ in the age i'm living in now to
[1:11:24] thank that we are created amen in the
[1:11:26] image of god now you know you that study
[1:11:28] know amen that the image of god amen is
[1:11:31] not a natural image it is a divine image
[1:11:34] and according to genesis 5 1 the bible
[1:11:37] says this is the book of the generations
[1:11:40] of adam amen i feel good here tonight
[1:11:42] amen this is the book of the generations
[1:11:45] of adam in the day that god created man
[1:11:49] notice it doesn't say man created god
[1:11:51] amen but in the day that god created man
[1:11:54] notice the next words in the likeness of
[1:11:56] god made he him in the likeness that
[1:11:59] word likeness can also be transferred he
[1:12:02] meant to the word image or figure or
[1:12:04] likeness it is an image of things it is
[1:12:07] the heavenly things they've been used to
[1:12:09] the moral likeness of renewed men amen
[1:12:12] to god somebody say renewed
[1:12:14] renewed men to god it is the image of
[1:12:16] the son of god into which true
[1:12:18] christians are transformed it's the
[1:12:21] image of the son of god into which two
[1:12:23] christians are transformed is likeness
[1:12:26] not unto the heavenly body but also to
[1:12:28] the most holy and blessed state of mind
[1:12:31] which christ possesses amen it means the
[1:12:33] image of one it is one in whom the
[1:12:35] likeness of anyone has seen is applied
[1:12:38] to man on account of this power of
[1:12:41] command it is of christ on account of
[1:12:43] this divine nature and his absolute
[1:12:46] moral excellence
[1:12:49] that god created man in the likeness of
[1:12:51] god in the in the transformation of god
[1:12:54] amen in the image of god amen created he
[1:12:57] both male and female right but here the
[1:13:00] bible's showing us amen that god has
[1:13:02] created a people to be transformed into
[1:13:05] the image of his son amen i'll say it
[1:13:07] like this as christians amen we are to
[1:13:10] manifest amen jesus christ amen in every
[1:13:13] aspect of our lives amen in our in our
[1:13:16] marriages we all manifest christ in our
[1:13:18] families we ought to manifest christ in
[1:13:20] our business affairs we all manifest
[1:13:22] christ in the way we treat one another
[1:13:25] we ought to manifest christ in the way
[1:13:27] we approach these services we ought to
[1:13:29] manifest christ amen as christians we
[1:13:31] have been put here to manifest the life
[1:13:34] of jesus christ that the world may know
[1:13:36] that there has been a uniting between
[1:13:38] god and his bride now if you look in the
[1:13:41] bible you'll see the word christian or
[1:13:42] the word christians there it's used
[1:13:44] about three times in acts 11 26 it says
[1:13:47] when he which is speaking about a
[1:13:49] barnabas had found him he besought him
[1:13:52] unto antioch brought him into antioch
[1:13:54] and it came to pass that a whole year
[1:13:56] they assembled themselves with the
[1:13:57] church and taught much people and the
[1:14:00] disciples were called christians first
[1:14:02] in antioch
[1:14:04] think about this the disciples were
[1:14:06] called christians first in antioch and
[1:14:09] in acts 26 28 then agrippa said unto
[1:14:11] paul amen almost thou persuades me amen
[1:14:15] to be a christian in first peter 4 16
[1:14:18] the bible says if any man suffer as a
[1:14:21] christian amen let him not be ashamed
[1:14:24] but let him glorify god on this behalf
[1:14:27] what i'm saying is your life worthy of
[1:14:29] the gospel he said a christian is not a
[1:14:31] tool it's not some
[1:14:33] mechanical wrench amen to a great big
[1:14:35] religious regime amen a christian is not
[1:14:38] some kind of tool that keeps a religious
[1:14:40] organization moving amen that is not a
[1:14:44] christian he said a christian is to be
[1:14:46] christ-like he meant that the
[1:14:48] identifying characteristic of a
[1:14:50] christian is not the ability to debate
[1:14:53] it is not the ability to fuss it is not
[1:14:55] the ability to keep things always tore
[1:14:57] up and divided
[1:14:59] but the identifying mark of a christian
[1:15:01] is the ability to be christ-like and a
[1:15:04] christian cannot be a christian until
[1:15:06] christ comes into the man and the life
[1:15:09] of christ is in him he said then it
[1:15:11] produces the life that christ lived and
[1:15:13] you do the things that christ did he
[1:15:15] says what am i talking about amen
[1:15:18] personal relationship to christ amen he
[1:15:21] didn't say brotherdale personal
[1:15:22] membership to the church he didn't say
[1:15:24] personal personalities to the people he
[1:15:27] said i'm talking about a personal
[1:15:29] relationship to christ you know the only
[1:15:31] way that you can come to a personal
[1:15:33] relationship is through a new birth they
[1:15:35] meant church membership won't do it amen
[1:15:38] learning quotes won't do it memorizing
[1:15:40] things won't do it the only route to a
[1:15:42] personal relationship with christ is the
[1:15:45] new birth amen i'll say to you like this
[1:15:47] a christian amen means to be a follower
[1:15:50] of christ it means to be christ-like or
[1:15:52] it means to be like christ amen do you
[1:15:55] realize we have so many amen
[1:15:57] explanations and definitions today of
[1:16:00] what a christian is amen the problem god
[1:16:02] will tell us in his day that there was
[1:16:04] around 900 different denominations do
[1:16:06] you realize tonight amen around the
[1:16:08] world there is some 3 000 plus amen
[1:16:11] denominations they've been trying to
[1:16:13] identify you they've been the baptists
[1:16:16] are trying to identify you the
[1:16:17] presbyterians are trying to identify you
[1:16:19] ain't been they're all trying to give
[1:16:21] you a definition or explanation amen
[1:16:23] what a christian is amen but let us be
[1:16:26] glad and rejoice that we have been given
[1:16:28] a message of restoration he meant to
[1:16:31] restore us back amen to what the bible
[1:16:33] definition of a christian is listen
[1:16:35] we're not just a bunch of bible
[1:16:37] preachers and a bunch of bible singers
[1:16:39] amen we're bible christians we've been
[1:16:41] restored by the voice of malachi 4 we
[1:16:44] have been restored back to what the true
[1:16:46] identity of a christian really is
[1:16:48] remember said many times amen is this
[1:16:51] okay
[1:16:52] he says we hear the expression oh what
[1:16:55] is a christian amen some people limit it
[1:16:58] to joining a church amen someone said
[1:17:00] well a christian is a church member it's
[1:17:02] someone who takes up their affiliations
[1:17:04] with the church i believe that all
[1:17:06] christians should do that amen but i
[1:17:08] don't believe that's christianity amen
[1:17:10] that's what a christian does after
[1:17:12] somebody shout after he becomes a
[1:17:14] christian it doesn't mean that because
[1:17:17] he does it that he is a christian then
[1:17:19] some will say no it's going to church
[1:17:21] and serving a declaration of creeds and
[1:17:24] being loyal to those things with the
[1:17:25] churches teach and then there are others
[1:17:27] that say perhaps they've meant packing a
[1:17:29] little something on them a little cross
[1:17:31] or something amen that that is the sign
[1:17:34] of a christian now i'm going to take the
[1:17:35] breaks off and preacher for a second hey
[1:17:37] because if you saw a catholic event
[1:17:40] packing a cross around you'd say well
[1:17:41] they're trying to have a sign of a
[1:17:43] christian amen if you if you've seen a
[1:17:45] baptist they've been wearing a pen on
[1:17:47] their coat and identifying there was a
[1:17:49] southern baptist you'd say well they're
[1:17:51] trying to have a sign of a christian
[1:17:52] well i'm going to take the gloves off
[1:17:54] and say amen packing around the suitcase
[1:17:56] of a replica of brother branham's amen
[1:17:59] is no different than some baptist
[1:18:00] they've been wearing a sign on their
[1:18:02] shirt listen we're not identified by
[1:18:04] brother branham's suitcase we're not
[1:18:06] identified by pen and says i'm a tape
[1:18:08] follower we are identified by the life
[1:18:10] of jesus christ that was poured out on
[1:18:12] the day of pentecost you want to be
[1:18:14] identified as a christian it ain't what
[1:18:16] pen you wear it ain't what camp you
[1:18:18] associate around it's can you go to the
[1:18:20] upper room can you go with 120 when can
[1:18:24] you go and be baptized in my name for
[1:18:26] the remission of sin and receive the
[1:18:28] mark of the christian which is the
[1:18:30] baptism of the holy ghost empire i say
[1:18:33] tonight friends our young people need to
[1:18:35] know that their identification is more
[1:18:37] than their long hair and their long
[1:18:39] dress and a spoken word book under their
[1:18:41] arm their identification is the same god
[1:18:44] that was in jesus has returned in this
[1:18:46] generation and by a new birth has taken
[1:18:49] possession in a vessel that the world
[1:18:52] may know that they're not just a young
[1:18:54] man and they're not just a young woman
[1:18:56] they're a living identified christian
[1:19:00] the almighty god in the age they're
[1:19:03] living in the sign of a christian it's
[1:19:05] not the color of coach you wear it's not
[1:19:07] the pen you wear on your coat it's a
[1:19:10] life you live yes
[1:19:14] i think that devil got out of here
[1:19:17] that's the sign of a christian yeah come
[1:19:19] on wait a minute we ain't a bunch of
[1:19:21] cultures people ain't been running
[1:19:23] around trying to tip our hat like
[1:19:24] brother random and wear a belt buckle
[1:19:26] like he oh god
[1:19:28] well it's the truth anyhow amen we're
[1:19:31] christians here tonight we're not a
[1:19:32] bunch of heretics we're christians here
[1:19:34] tonight we're real believers in jesus
[1:19:38] christ
[1:19:40] the sign of a christian then there's
[1:19:42] others who believe amen that perhaps
[1:19:44] maybe if they would burn a candle or do
[1:19:46] some kind of penance amen that's a
[1:19:48] christian if they'll merely be immersed
[1:19:50] in water or they'll do some sacrifice or
[1:19:52] they'll give some good to the church or
[1:19:54] they'll help the neighbor well i pick
[1:19:56] that up sometimes we'll preach even
[1:19:58] people say well amen i really can't live
[1:20:00] the word so i'll just be good to the
[1:20:02] bride and i'll make it as one that was
[1:20:04] good in the bride well that's ok that's
[1:20:06] all well and good but the problem i've
[1:20:08] got with that amen is jesus said and
[1:20:11] that day they'll say amen when did we do
[1:20:13] this amen so they was unknowledgeable of
[1:20:16] what they was doing amen being good to
[1:20:18] the bride amen was not another route to
[1:20:20] salvation being good to the bride was
[1:20:23] not the opening of the door even for
[1:20:25] somebody who didn't want to die out to
[1:20:27] themselves and let the flesh be
[1:20:29] mortified amen by the spirit of god but
[1:20:32] i say tonight there's a pride on the
[1:20:34] earth who's not an immature bride she's
[1:20:36] a mature bride and she can take the heat
[1:20:39] brother danny or the sunlight and it can
[1:20:41] bake all the greenness out of it oh god
[1:20:44] have mercy we ain't a bunch of babies
[1:20:46] around here we're some real rugged
[1:20:48] christians we're some real world born
[1:20:50] believers you can't preach it too hot
[1:20:52] and you can't preach it too easy amen
[1:20:54] you can shut the heart off of us amen
[1:20:57] but we'll still be here amen because we
[1:20:59] didn't come in by handshake and we can't
[1:21:01] go out by hurt feeling we came in by the
[1:21:04] baptism of the holy ghost and fire and
[1:21:06] you can't preach this message hot enough
[1:21:09] to run an eagle off
[1:21:11] well somebody might as well say amen if
[1:21:13] you come in by a handshake you'll go out
[1:21:15] by a hurt feeling if you come in by your
[1:21:17] favorite singer you'll go out by
[1:21:19] somebody that can't carry a tune in a
[1:21:21] bucket but if you come in by the baptism
[1:21:24] of the holy ghosted power when the world
[1:21:26] is shifting sand you'll be standing on
[1:21:29] christ the solid rock yes sir
[1:21:32] come on
[1:21:33] i'm not talking about church members i'm
[1:21:35] talking about christians
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] true christians yeah well we'll just
[1:21:41] want to speak good to our neighbor we'll
[1:21:43] buy some coal for the winter we'll we'll
[1:21:44] buy some shoes for the orphanage he said
[1:21:46] that's acts of a christian yeah he said
[1:21:48] those are the things that you should do
[1:21:51] but that steel doesn't make you a
[1:21:53] christian
[1:21:55] well let's keep on going can we can we
[1:21:57] stay in the presence of god amen then
[1:21:59] some says that if you pack an image of
[1:22:01] christ in your car or on your wall that
[1:22:04] is a sign of a christian amen well then
[1:22:06] things are all right amen but i don't
[1:22:08] believe amen that packing an image
[1:22:10] somebody say pack in an image
[1:22:13] i don't believe that packing an image
[1:22:16] makes you a christian he said i believe
[1:22:19] that being an image of christ amen makes
[1:22:22] you a christian now we're going to turn
[1:22:24] a corner okay he says it's not what we
[1:22:26] do outwardly it's what happened inwardly
[1:22:30] that makes us what we are yeah
[1:22:33] well that kicks legalism right out the
[1:22:35] door don't it amen and there goes the
[1:22:37] measuring stick right out the door
[1:22:39] because if you get the holy ghost them
[1:22:41] skirts will get longer and if you get
[1:22:43] the holy ghost then heels will get lower
[1:22:45] to the ground and if you get the holy
[1:22:47] ghost that makeup will go out the door
[1:22:49] well godly mouse will preach if you get
[1:22:51] the holy ghost you won't have to worry
[1:22:53] about that television in your living
[1:22:55] room if you get the holy ghost it won't
[1:22:57] be the preacher preaching on you it'll
[1:22:59] be the holy ghost inside of you they've
[1:23:01] been burning sin out of you by an
[1:23:03] experience of a new birth
[1:23:07] well that's the truth any house we might
[1:23:09] as well preach i think it's time to
[1:23:10] bring a standard back to the house of
[1:23:12] god i think it's time to get rid of
[1:23:14] these sissified amen panty-wasted
[1:23:16] preachers that ain't got the guts to
[1:23:18] stand up and say what a prophet said i
[1:23:20] think our young girls need to know it's
[1:23:22] a sin to wear makeup i think our young
[1:23:24] boys need to know what you're saying
[1:23:26] ain't been to run around in a pair of
[1:23:27] swords like some big find society
[1:23:30] well we might as well preach anyhow i
[1:23:32] think our women ought to know amen that
[1:23:34] you're out of the will of god trying to
[1:23:35] tell your husband how to run the house i
[1:23:38] think our husbands ought to know you've
[1:23:39] got a position not to be a dominating
[1:23:41] male anything but to be a leader in your
[1:23:43] household what did this message come to
[1:23:45] do did it come together something to
[1:23:47] shout about did it come together
[1:23:49] something to be puffed up about i seen
[1:23:51] this message come ain't meant to restore
[1:23:53] the image of what a true christian is in
[1:23:55] the age we're living here it ain't a
[1:23:57] bunch of fights and then
[1:23:59] dominating females running the church
[1:24:01] it's the bride of jesus christ in
[1:24:03] submission to her lord by the spirit of
[1:24:05] god
[1:24:07] well it's a truth anyhow amen i'll tell
[1:24:09] you what's well god have mercy might as
[1:24:12] well preach amen amen that's going on so
[1:24:14] we might as well preach and because we
[1:24:16] got kids growing up that never saw him
[1:24:19] in the order of the house now they grow
[1:24:21] up and think that's the way things ought
[1:24:22] to be and then we got young girls
[1:24:24] getting married in fact the first time
[1:24:26] the preacher preaches on makeup they
[1:24:28] tell their husbands we ain't going back
[1:24:30] i tell you what they mean we need some
[1:24:31] boys to get a backbone and be a leader
[1:24:34] in this generation and quit being a
[1:24:36] liberal that wouldn't know a
[1:24:37] backbone if you met in a 10-acre field
[1:24:42] i'm not a politician i'm a preacher
[1:24:45] are you hearing me this message come to
[1:24:46] restore true christianity
[1:24:52] well brother andrew that's whole school
[1:24:53] will you tell me how cumberland was
[1:24:55] preached on after the seals was open
[1:24:59] well glory to god it's getting hot in
[1:25:01] here but we're going to preach right
[1:25:02] through you tell me how come the prophet
[1:25:04] of god was still saying then pain and
[1:25:06] face jezebel's not one of those two acts
[1:25:09] 238 hollering screaming youngins it
[1:25:11] would be a miserable embarrassment to
[1:25:13] her i'll tell you why it's because they
[1:25:14] wanted church without the holy ghost
[1:25:16] they wanted religion without the holy
[1:25:18] ghost they wanted a happy sound time
[1:25:20] without the holy ghost remember this
[1:25:23] message has restored and then the holy
[1:25:25] ghost to the church and for the first
[1:25:27] time in two thousand years we ain't a
[1:25:28] bunch of bubble banks and church members
[1:25:30] we are some anthocon we are some team
[1:25:33] seeds of god who has been known from the
[1:25:35] mind of god and if we shout we're
[1:25:37] shouting because we're restored if we
[1:25:40] dance we're dancing because we're
[1:25:41] restored if we run the aisles we're
[1:25:44] running the aisles because we've been
[1:25:45] restored yes
[1:25:47] we ain't here playing church we are the
[1:25:50] church we ain't here playing the holy
[1:25:52] ghost the holy ghost just come in and we
[1:25:54] give him right away in our lives
[1:25:58] something's going to happen on the
[1:25:59] inside and it'll move to the outside
[1:26:03] right good oh
[1:26:05] preacher you're old school you didn't
[1:26:06] have to tell me i already knew that
[1:26:09] and what you don't know is what old
[1:26:10] school is is what's on them tapes
[1:26:15] come on you wanna you wanna go there
[1:26:16] we'll go there please pray and just play
[1:26:18] tapes we'll do that amen but if you're
[1:26:20] gonna do it do what's on the tapes
[1:26:23] come on now if you're going to say that
[1:26:25] then say what's on the page and the
[1:26:27] prophet said what the church needs is a
[1:26:29] good old-fashioned saint paul's revival
[1:26:31] and the bible holy ghost back in the
[1:26:33] church he said we need some preachers it
[1:26:35] won't be a bunch of hollywood lads but
[1:26:37] they'll stand in the pulpit and they'll
[1:26:39] call black black and white white and
[1:26:41] wrong wrong and right right and will
[1:26:43] produce a change in the lives of the
[1:26:45] hearers by the word of god
[1:26:49] [Music]
[1:26:51] somebody ought to say amen
[1:26:53] we're not a bunch of church members
[1:26:54] we're christians
[1:26:56] come on we're not we're not here tonight
[1:26:58] y'all didn't gather up here tonight
[1:27:00] ain't been to pay your monthly news to
[1:27:01] the church you gathered here to receive
[1:27:03] something from god you gathered here to
[1:27:05] receive a change to receive a power to
[1:27:08] receive a zeal in your life
[1:27:10] it means something going to happen on
[1:27:12] the inside and it'll move to the outside
[1:27:13] well then you get people say well amen
[1:27:15] it's all grace and it's all oh god have
[1:27:18] mercy brother man i'm trying to preach
[1:27:20] but i can't get out of this they say
[1:27:21] well it's all grace now and so it don't
[1:27:23] matter
[1:27:24] i'll tell you this amen you can't get
[1:27:26] something on the inside and it not
[1:27:28] reflect on the outside come on
[1:27:32] come on amen you you can't get something
[1:27:34] inside and not move to the outside then
[1:27:37] the prophet said christianity is not
[1:27:39] what happened outwardly it's what
[1:27:41] happened inwardly that makes us what we
[1:27:43] are then therefore if he is our image
[1:27:46] and we are in his likeness and members
[1:27:49] of his body then we should be images
[1:27:51] like him that our lives somebody say our
[1:27:54] lives not our sermons not our songs not
[1:27:57] our quote books our lives should reflect
[1:28:00] the image of christ not in our joining
[1:28:02] church or in our in our packing of
[1:28:04] crucifix or our emotions but it should
[1:28:07] be in the living presence of the living
[1:28:10] god that's reflected through our lives
[1:28:12] you say preacher our emotions
[1:28:14] pentecostals are a prime example of of a
[1:28:18] person that's identifying their
[1:28:20] identification as a christian upon their
[1:28:22] emotions because you crank up the music
[1:28:25] and you get the guitar hot and they'll
[1:28:27] shout the house down but you meet him on
[1:28:29] monday morning amen and the prophet god
[1:28:31] said you'll hear some good old-fashioned
[1:28:33] pentecostal cuts and he said you know
[1:28:35] why even because their experience didn't
[1:28:37] go no further than as loud as the music
[1:28:39] went amen but i rebuke every devil it's
[1:28:42] trying to shut the move of god down
[1:28:44] around the bride of jesus christ we are
[1:28:46] not shouting because somebody's playing
[1:28:49] our favorite song we are shouting
[1:28:51] because we've been changed it's jesus on
[1:28:53] the inside and he's working on the
[1:28:55] outside i'm talking about a bunch of
[1:28:57] drunks that's been made real fathers i'm
[1:29:00] talking about a bunch of gossipers
[1:29:01] that's been set free by the power of the
[1:29:04] holy ghost i'm talking about somebody
[1:29:06] that's met god for themselves and they
[1:29:08] know him in the power of his
[1:29:09] regeneration
[1:29:12] made a bunch of bubble dancers it's
[1:29:14] jesus on the inside
[1:29:16] and he's working on the outside
[1:29:19] oh what a change
[1:29:21] glory to god it's jesus on the inside
[1:29:23] and he's working on the outside what a
[1:29:26] change is in our lives the father said
[1:29:28] church membership is all right i have
[1:29:30] nothing against it but brother to be a
[1:29:32] christian means to be conformed to the
[1:29:35] image of christ we are to be living
[1:29:37] images not pack an image but be an image
[1:29:41] of the lord jesus christianity versus
[1:29:43] idolatry we are made partakers of his
[1:29:46] holiness
[1:29:48] we the bride are made partakers of his
[1:29:51] holiness we in his image we are living
[1:29:54] images of a living god are you ready for
[1:29:57] this then dead to self

[1:30:07] tell you what amen i'm born again holy
[1:30:09] ghost field fire baptized christian and
[1:30:12] you're the center i've ever been in
[1:30:13] trouble that happens in the church your
[1:30:15] name is associated with every bit of
[1:30:17] division around the community i'll tell
[1:30:20] you what something went wrong somewhere
[1:30:21] even because the prophet of god said if
[1:30:24] you ever get the holy ghost he said
[1:30:26] somebody come around you're trying to
[1:30:27] talk negative and you'll say don't come
[1:30:29] around me talking like that amen i'm not

[1:30:33] cesspool either

[1:30:57] yourself and i'll just go ahead and tell

[1:31:00] a little bit too loud here amen if you
[1:31:02] ever make it to hell come on now yeah if
[1:31:05] you think it's a little too
[1:31:06] uncomfortable here if you ever make it
[1:31:08] to heaven amen you'll remember this was
[1:31:11] the quietest place amen you ever was
[1:31:13] because brother harvey you get a bunch
[1:31:15] of redeemed vessels of god to care on
[1:31:18] the streets of gold beholding the tree
[1:31:20] of life you think i shout down here you
[1:31:23] ain't seen nothing yet you think with
[1:31:25] dance down here you ain't seen nothing
[1:31:27] yet listen if you go to hell they're
[1:31:29] going to be hollering and screaming and
[1:31:31] wailing and gnashing teeth and they're
[1:31:33] going to be doing it because they missed
[1:31:35] it and if you go to heaven we're going
[1:31:37] to be shouting and we're going to be
[1:31:39] hollering and we're going to be
[1:31:40] rejoicing amen not because we missed it
[1:31:43] but brother danny because we made it we
[1:31:45] made it out of laodicea we made it to
[1:31:48] the other side our family made it our
[1:31:50] church made it our family members that
[1:31:53] we never thought would make it are there
[1:31:55] yes sir
[1:31:56] well glory to god i think it's time to
[1:31:58] break out with all this church hannity
[1:32:00] and come back to what a real christian
[1:32:02] is
[1:32:04] yes
[1:32:06] well preacher we've died to ourselves
[1:32:08] the part of god said dead to yourself
[1:32:10] and his word made flesh again somebody
[1:32:13] say again
[1:32:15] his word made flesh again
[1:32:17] in us
[1:32:18] now watch what is it not the mythical
[1:32:22] imaginary god setting out there but the
[1:32:25] living god are you ready for this what
[1:32:27] is the living god
[1:32:28] it's the word
[1:32:30] in you
[1:32:31] making itself real yes
[1:32:34] brother joe that's a mouthful for the
[1:32:36] word in you
[1:32:38] making itself real then the world is
[1:32:40] hungering for something real
[1:32:42] the world is waiting for somebody amen
[1:32:46] brother to manifest the life of christ
[1:32:48] yes
[1:32:49] the prodigal said what is the living god
[1:32:51] it's the word in you making itself real
[1:32:53] everybody said woo glory to god i know
[1:32:56] you think i'm a holy roller and maybe i
[1:32:58] am but brother do you see it he said do
[1:33:02] you see it amen triumph over every
[1:33:04] denomination that's why we're shouting
[1:33:07] as we escaped the damnable heresies of
[1:33:10] three thousand plus denominations that's
[1:33:12] why we're rejoicing as we escaped amen
[1:33:15] the grip of babylon by the voice of the
[1:33:17] seventh angel that's why we're running
[1:33:19] the aisles it's because we heard a
[1:33:21] prophet saying that you're not going to
[1:33:23] tribulation for perfection amen but the
[1:33:25] blood of jesus christ had the power of
[1:33:27] atonement and the power of perfection
[1:33:30] that puts you out of time back into
[1:33:32] eternity
[1:33:33] triumph over every denomination triumph
[1:33:36] over all paganism a living god may
[1:33:38] manifest in a living temple and the word
[1:33:41] of god which his god is made flesh in
[1:33:43] you he said why you are seated in
[1:33:46] heavenly places triumphed over all
[1:33:49] things in christ jesus brother ben we
[1:33:53] are not going to heavenly places we are
[1:33:56] in heavenly places
[1:33:58] brother harvey hey we're there we're not
[1:34:01] looking for it we're right in the middle
[1:34:02] of it
[1:34:04] oh you want another one here it is oh
[1:34:06] it's silly to the people they don't get
[1:34:08] it but they were not born somebody said
[1:34:10] born they were not born to get it so
[1:34:13] they won't get it even the bible said so
[1:34:15] amen but god always feels his temple
[1:34:18] somebody say it the day of dedication
[1:34:21] as the day of dedication he fills his
[1:34:24] temple he fills it with himself the same
[1:34:27] thing today amen god will feel somebody
[1:34:29] say god will fail he will fill every
[1:34:31] temple that will thoroughly dedicate
[1:34:34] itself to him any person that will
[1:34:37] brother brother dale i mean when this
[1:34:39] when this when this quote come alive to
[1:34:40] me i'm sitting in a hotel room in
[1:34:42] stillwater oklahoma let's get ready for
[1:34:44] win the brother when martin's dedication
[1:34:46] means and i was just the prophet
[1:34:47] preached on the dedication and he said
[1:34:49] they built the temple he said they had
[1:34:51] all the furniture in there but he said
[1:34:54] they had all the curtains there he said
[1:34:56] everything was just right he said but
[1:34:58] now watch he said they all gathered
[1:35:00] there for a dedication service he said
[1:35:02] but the dedication was not the gathering
[1:35:05] of the people it was the feeling of the
[1:35:07] vessels with the presence of god he said
[1:35:10] see they could have everything finished
[1:35:12] and not the sound of the hammer or the
[1:35:14] buzz of a saw but unless god come down
[1:35:17] with his presence and then it was
[1:35:19] another building with another bunch of
[1:35:21] furniture but it was an undedicated
[1:35:23] temple i said oh god amen don't ever let
[1:35:26] our churches and then be fancy buildings
[1:35:28] with fancy instruments and fancy
[1:35:30] furniture but the presence of the living
[1:35:32] god listen i say tonight oh god if we
[1:35:35] lose all of our music and we lose all of
[1:35:37] our technology don't ever let us lose
[1:35:39] your presence it'll be another building
[1:35:42] with another bunch of people but if the
[1:35:44] presence of god comes in it'll change
[1:35:46] young people it'll heal our sick it'll
[1:35:49] raise the dead it'll save the laws it'll
[1:35:51] restore the backslider it'll feel the
[1:35:53] empty mess so i'm talking about the
[1:35:55] original dedication christ coming in the
[1:35:58] temple with his very presence
[1:36:01] this temple is not this little building
[1:36:03] here the temple is not the one in salt
[1:36:05] lake city the temple's not in rome the
[1:36:08] temple is you
[1:36:12] since that's a powerful fault the temple
[1:36:14] is you you are the temple that god wants
[1:36:18] to dwell in come on now you'll all agree
[1:36:21] that god wants to dwell in you amen but
[1:36:23] will you amend the rest of this quote
[1:36:25] and express himself amen through you
[1:36:29] that all nations might know him yes
[1:36:32] then what was the prayer of the one god
[1:36:35] and the one church in john 17. it was
[1:36:38] father that i would be in them and they
[1:36:40] would be in me that the world may know
[1:36:46] that the world may know that they're not
[1:36:48] just a bunch of church members they're
[1:36:50] not just a bunch of deacons of trustees
[1:36:52] they are the living breathing epistles
[1:36:54] by the almighty god and the age they're
[1:36:56] living in
[1:36:58] that the world may know sisterhead the
[1:37:00] world may know that you are living
[1:37:02] images of god that god wants to work
[1:37:04] through come on friends you let god fill
[1:37:07] you when you as a 15 year old girl you
[1:37:09] let god fill you when you as a 40 year
[1:37:11] old man but when in god's name are you
[1:37:13] gonna let him express himself through
[1:37:15] you he did not just feel you ain't then
[1:37:18] just so you can walk around full he
[1:37:20] filled you because he has no hands but
[1:37:22] your hands he has no ears but your ears
[1:37:25] he has no eyes but your eyes he has no
[1:37:28] mouth but you're about come on friends

[1:37:32] of busters and fighters we have been
[1:37:34] dedicated that on our jobs and our
[1:37:36] schools and our communities the world
[1:37:38] may know that religion is not a bunch of
[1:37:41] scamming ain't been perverting me and
[1:37:43] trying to swindle people out of money

[1:37:47] generation

[1:37:51] oh god somebody give him some praise
[1:37:54] somebody give him some praise let the
[1:37:56] alpha god that's on the inside of you

[1:45:02] that's why your favorite preacher can
[1:45:03] leave the message and you're still
[1:45:05] following it because you were not a man
[1:45:07] chosen to be a christian by a man's
[1:45:10] desire you were not put in by a man's
[1:45:12] personality the prophet of god said we
[1:45:15] were elected to be christians all the
[1:45:18] father has given me will come to me the
[1:45:21] bible says send unto you that no man can
[1:45:24] come unto me except that we're given
[1:45:26] unto him of my father remember it says
[1:45:28] how many christians are here raise up
[1:45:31] your hand
[1:45:32] how many christians are here he says
[1:45:34] raise up your hand you're not a
[1:45:36] christian by your desire you're a
[1:45:39] christian by god's desire
[1:45:42] brother brother but justin that's worth
[1:45:44] repeating you're not a christian by your
[1:45:47] desire you're a christian by god's
[1:45:49] desire no man can come to me except my
[1:45:53] father draws him first you oh god you
[1:45:56] was elected by god before the foundation
[1:46:00] of the world to be a christian then the
[1:46:02] prophet takes that and turns it to a
[1:46:04] little boy named david what did david
[1:46:07] write he said though my father forsake
[1:46:09] me and my mother forsake me the lord
[1:46:11] will take me up david said i once was
[1:46:14] young but now i'm old and i've never
[1:46:16] seen the righteous forsaken or received
[1:46:19] begging for brother perez there was
[1:46:21] something in my heart that tells me
[1:46:23] david didn't have an easy life david
[1:46:25] didn't always have a sunny sky amen
[1:46:28] and a steel brook to sit by david had
[1:46:30] some rough days david brother david
[1:46:32] david had some rough days but there was
[1:46:34] one thing about david amen david was
[1:46:37] positionally placed by the desire of
[1:46:39] almighty god that's why he could slay
[1:46:41] the bear and he could slay the line and
[1:46:43] when goliath raised up his head he could
[1:46:46] say listen here i've done killed a bear
[1:46:48] i didn't kill the lion you might as well
[1:46:50] get in line because you're next there
[1:46:52] was no condition that david found
[1:46:54] himself in that could remove his
[1:46:56] constant satisfaction that god was
[1:46:59] jehovah and his strength was from
[1:47:01] everlasting unto everlasting mind and to
[1:47:03] think tonight friends we're not a bunch
[1:47:05] of we're not a bunch of finicky
[1:47:06] christians what's that thing the world

[1:47:19] ridiculed mocked
[1:47:21] fun of amen but brother harold we're
[1:47:24] still in that glorious number we're
[1:47:26] still following the pillar of power

[1:59:50] mimics of christianity
[1:59:56] well come on it's in the message brother
[1:59:58] said where did them kids come under a
[2:00:00] spirit to call elijah old bald head he
[2:00:02] said because her mom and daddy had been
[2:00:05] talking about elijah and they're oh god
[2:00:09] their conversation had amen cheapened
[2:00:11] elijah's influence over the life of
[2:00:14] their kids and they went out there and
[2:00:16] they saw elijah and they said old bald
[2:00:18] head yes
[2:00:21] and 42 she bears come out of the woods
[2:00:24] and killed them innocent kids you know
[2:00:26] what they felt oh god have mercy

[2:00:33] parents that they should have dealt with
[2:00:35] 20 years ago
[2:00:37] well come on friends i'm just following
[2:00:39] god right now i think it's time that our
[2:00:41] kids are not a part of church
[2:00:43] disagreements that happened 50 years ago
[2:00:46] i don't think our 10 year old kids ought
[2:00:48] to be able to rehearse church splits
[2:00:50] that happened 20 years ago i think
[2:00:52] somewhere sometimes we ought to take a
[2:00:54] sword and we ought to bury that hatchet
[2:00:56] we're not about come on you know what
[2:00:58] that generation was divided but come on
[2:01:00] young people you've not been brought up
[2:01:02] under a spirit of mission this is a
[2:01:04] message of unity this is a message of
[2:01:06] agreement i'm all i know they have their
[2:01:08] questions i know they had their parents
[2:01:10] but somewhere somehow their old founders
[2:01:13] died off and a new generation rose up
[2:01:15] you're saying preacher are you saying
[2:01:17] i'm too old to be a part of this new
[2:01:18] generation this ju new generation is not
[2:01:22] based upon age number it's based upon
[2:01:24] attitude caleb was 80 years old and he
[2:01:27] still had a good attitude towards the
[2:01:29] mental promise of god and it come to
[2:01:32] pass
[2:01:33] you want to change the way your kids act
[2:01:35] in the house of god quit second guessing
[2:01:37] everything the pastor said
[2:01:39] come on

[2:01:48] yeah i'm closer right here
[2:01:50] what else could they be
[2:01:54] i'm a hominid instead of a
[2:01:58] that's his religion no matter how he
[2:02:00] lives it
[2:02:01] because he subscribes
[2:02:03] in theory
[2:02:06] to what the quran teaches
[2:02:08] but to theorize christians
[2:02:11] in the same way a christian is a
[2:02:12] christian
[2:02:13] as long as he subscribes to the fact
[2:02:16] that jesus is the son of god
[2:02:20] born of a virgin
[2:02:22] crucified died and rose again
[2:02:25] he's the savior of mankind now here's
[2:02:27] where i'm closing it
[2:02:28] in fact
[2:02:30] in the laodicean age there will be those
[2:02:32] who call themselves christians
[2:02:35] because they subscribe to the fine
[2:02:37] qualities of jesus
[2:02:39] but here's the point
[2:02:41] while reserving brother david
[2:02:43] to themselves the right
[2:02:45] to deny
[2:02:46] his deity
[2:02:48] christian scientists have done that
[2:02:50] already as well here it is as well as
[2:02:54] multitudes who preach
[2:02:56] a social
[2:02:58] gospel
[2:03:01] he's a nominal christian
[2:03:02] he belongs to the church
[2:03:05] but he is not a true
[2:03:07] or spiritual
[2:03:09] believer
[2:03:13] then you pray tell me what a true
[2:03:14] spiritual believer is
[2:03:18] well i got malachi 4 on record
[2:03:22] a believer
[2:03:24] who has been baptized
[2:03:26] into the body of christ and is a member
[2:03:29] of him
[2:03:30] but nonetheless it's god's order the
[2:03:32] tares grow up with the wheat and they
[2:03:33] are not to be uprooted that is the
[2:03:35] command of god their day for binding and
[2:03:37] burning is coming but not yet
[2:03:40] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[2:03:43] group
[2:03:44] on one hand he is praising
[2:03:46] on the other
[2:03:47] he is rebuking
[2:03:49] he is told
[2:03:50] what is right
[2:03:52] with the true believer
[2:03:55] well there are me about here tonight
[2:03:56] could say preacher
[2:03:57] i want to be a true believer
[2:04:00] i don't want to be a cheap
[2:04:02] reproduction
[2:04:05] a mimic of christianity
[2:04:06] yes i want to be a real christian yes i
[2:04:10] wanna i want the way i conduct myself
[2:04:13] to be a living image
[2:04:15] of jesus christ
[2:04:17] yes i want our musician to come
[2:04:21] he said with
[2:04:22] andrew it's hard
[2:04:25] it's hard
[2:04:27] to be a real christian
[2:04:30] the prophet god said watch
[2:04:32] he said we're living images
[2:04:34] expressing god
[2:04:36] he said every man that didn't believe
[2:04:38] god was considered an oddball
[2:04:41] now i'm going to slow down right here
[2:04:42] and lay some
[2:04:43] lay some word in here strong
[2:04:46] don't you let
[2:04:48] what a social
[2:04:49] lay on a scene
[2:04:51] backslidden denominational group
[2:04:53] identifies a christian intimidates you
[2:04:56] for your conviction
[2:05:00] don't you let what laodicea says a
[2:05:03] christian is intimidate what a
[2:05:06] god-called christian is
[2:05:10] they've already defined what a family is
[2:05:12] it's a man married to a man and they
[2:05:14] have a child by some by some by some
[2:05:16] perverted something it's a woman married
[2:05:18] to amen now come on friends
[2:05:20] that's what that that's what they say a
[2:05:22] fam that's the modern family
[2:05:26] and for you to teach your boy he's a boy
[2:05:28] you're an oddball
[2:05:31] well a few days back god's grace we're
[2:05:33] going to have a boy and that boy's going
[2:05:34] to know he is a boy
[2:05:39] my convictions ain't coming from a
[2:05:41] preacher they're coming from a prophet
[2:05:43] [Applause]
[2:05:44] where's your convictions coming from
[2:05:48] i think our young girls ought to know
[2:05:49] they're not a bunch of tomboys they're
[2:05:50] young ladies
[2:05:55] well let's stand we might as well
[2:05:58] how many can say tonight i want to be a
[2:06:00] real christian
[2:06:02] are you willing
[2:06:04] to be a christian
[2:06:06] a real
[2:06:07] spiritual christian
[2:06:09] even though it's classified as an
[2:06:11] oddball
[2:06:14] are you willing to hold your convictions
[2:06:18] are you willing to
[2:06:23] as a young man i'll share this with you
[2:06:24] i'll open up a little bit about my life
[2:06:26] tonight
[2:06:28] as a young man not growing up rather
[2:06:30] than with the influence of a father
[2:06:33] in my heart
[2:06:35] as a young man as a teenage boy when i
[2:06:38] would hear
[2:06:39] what i considered real holy ghost field
[2:06:41] meant examples that i saw
[2:06:43] give a little piece of advice i'd say
[2:06:45] i'm going to keep that
[2:06:47] i'm going to rest for that one
[2:06:49] and brother joel i got to doing
[2:06:51] something one time i got to take it some
[2:06:53] of those things
[2:06:54] and i got to look at the message and
[2:06:56] brother frank what they were living by
[2:06:58] is what a prophet taught
[2:07:02] and then i found the cult where a
[2:07:04] prophet of god said an evening time
[2:07:05] message will produce even time results
[2:07:07] i said that's why their kids are serving
[2:07:09] god
[2:07:11] that's why their families saved
[2:07:13] it's been
[2:07:14] listen i know this ain't popular but i'm
[2:07:16] preaching to you from my heart i think
[2:07:18] it's time there ought to be a difference
[2:07:19] between message churches and
[2:07:20] denominational churches
[2:07:23] and i think it's a time we stop bowing
[2:07:25] our head and being embarrassed to say we
[2:07:26] believe malachi 4.
[2:07:29] i think it's time to quit being ashamed
[2:07:31] to say that we pattern our lives after
[2:07:33] the voice of the seventh angel come on
[2:07:36] the prophet god said who is this
[2:07:38] melchizedek he said when you heard the
[2:07:40] word for your day
[2:07:42] he said the living image of the living
[2:07:43] god he said you left the other thing
[2:07:46] you heard
[2:07:47] from your theophany i don't know about
[2:07:49] you all but tonight i'm gonna follow a
[2:07:50] message you can tell me where my
[2:07:52] theophany is
[2:07:54] i'm gonna follow a message brother frank
[2:07:56] it can lead me back to my theophany
[2:08:01] will there be one here tonight i can say
[2:08:03] god
[2:08:04] i want to be a real christian
[2:08:10] you know the only way you can have that
[2:08:13] is by a new birth
[2:08:15] and you was elected before the
[2:08:16] foundation of the world
[2:08:18] to be born again
[2:08:20] it's your turn brother says in this
[2:08:22] quote he says by heart you know what
[2:08:24] he said even so we in his eter in his
[2:08:26] thoughts in our turn
[2:08:28] became the many members spoken word seed
[2:08:30] manifested in flesh and those eternal
[2:08:32] faults now manifested flesh are the sons
[2:08:36] of god
[2:08:37] even
[2:08:38] as we are so called
[2:08:39] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[2:08:43] we were seed and therefore we
[2:08:46] were reborn for only the elect can be
[2:08:48] reborn because we were seed is the
[2:08:51] reason we can be quickened
[2:08:53] in non-seed
[2:08:55] there's nothing
[2:08:56] to quicken
[2:08:59] i don't know about you tonight friends
[2:09:01] but this is my heart's prayer
[2:09:04] i want to be a living image
[2:09:07] of true christianity
[2:09:10] i don't want to have a reputation within
[2:09:12] the four walls of this building
[2:09:14] and a different one in school
[2:09:18] i don't want to have a good reputation
[2:09:20] here and a different one on my on my job
[2:09:22] on my workforce what about you
[2:09:25] i'm abusing you as an illustration can

[2:09:30] christian
[2:09:31] let the biggest drunk on my job so i'll
[2:09:33] be able to say that's a real christian
[2:09:37] i know i'm preaching long you forgive me
[2:09:40] but i gotta leave you fish
[2:09:42] a real christian
