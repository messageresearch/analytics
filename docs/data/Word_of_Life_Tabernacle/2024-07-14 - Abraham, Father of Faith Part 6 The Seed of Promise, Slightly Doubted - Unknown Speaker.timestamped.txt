[49:29] have one service on Sunday we will not
[49:32] have service this Wednesday night so
[49:34] service will start on Thursday night and
[49:37] uh we got a a good number of people

[49:46] lot of people coming from out of town
[49:47] different states to come in and uh so we

[49:58] Holy Spirit and Revival would break Out
[50:01] Among Us I'm so thankful for what he has
[50:03] been doing Among Us I uh the service
[50:06] Wednesday night I just thought was was
[50:08] good tonight brother Joel's going to
[50:09] speak to us we're going to have uh our
[50:11] youth Focus tonight as we usually do and
[50:14] uh this morning after the service if the
[50:16] deacons could meet with me immediately
[50:18] after the service uh we've been trying
[50:20] to work on security and things we live
[50:22] in a crazy world and uh some terrible
[50:25] things happening in the world world and
[50:27] uh we've done everything we can do to
[50:30] help make the church secure in that way
[50:32] there's only so much you can do uh but
[50:35] we want you to know that we're doing
[50:36] everything we can do and trusting the
[50:38] Lord to help keep us safe as we have
[50:41] people here and and church is a soft
[50:44] target uh I think anybody with any
[50:46] Authority today uh the devil's out to
[50:49] get them people are out to get them but
[50:51] we got to stand on the word don't we we
[50:53] we want to stand on the word and and
[50:55] stay with the with the Bible
[50:57] and say the things that need to be said
[51:00] and God help us to do that Genesis or
[51:03] Galatians rather chapter 4 I've been in
[51:05] Genesis so much I can't I can't get out
[51:07] of it this morning Galatians chapter 4:
[51:10] 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the
[51:13] children of Promise how many believe
[51:15] you're the children of promise this
[51:17] morning but as then he that was born
[51:20] after the flesh persecuted him that was
[51:22] born after the spirit even so it is now
[51:26] nevertheless what saith the scripture
[51:29] cast out the Bond woman and her son the
[51:32] son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir
[51:35] with the son of the free woman so then
[51:38] brethren we are not children of the Bond
[51:41] woman but of the free pray the Lord
[51:44] would add his Blessing to the word you
[51:45] may be seated I want to speak to you
[51:47] this morning on the seed of a slightly
[51:49] doubted
[51:52] promise one of the reasons that we see
[51:55] Abraham making
[51:57] mistakes uh the way that he did in his
[52:00] life and and brother brandham taught us
[52:02] we read the quotes where brother
[52:03] brandham said that Abraham was a was a
[52:06] man full of mistakes and I think we all
[52:08] could say we're full of mistakes and yet
[52:11] by the grace of God we're here this
[52:12] morning but God didn't count his
[52:15] mistakes to him because of his faith but
[52:18] many of the mistakes that he made was
[52:20] because his Revelation that he had was
[52:22] Progressive so he didn't know at first
[52:26] exactly ly how God would move and what
[52:28] God would do in his life and I think
[52:31] that's true of all of us many times it's
[52:33] a lack of Revelation in our lives is why
[52:35] we make some of the mistakes that we do
[52:38] but as God unfolds himself to us we have
[52:41] to be willing to accept the furtherance
[52:43] of the revelation of God in our lives
[52:46] and and and at some point in our lives
[52:48] we've got to he must be revealed to us
[52:50] in such a way that we begin to walk as
[52:53] mature Christians and we see Abraham
[52:55] reaching that point where he had to
[52:57] reach a place where a where God could
[52:59] look at Abraham and say I know how he'll
[53:01] lead his family I know what he'll do so
[53:04] I'll reveal myself to him in a way that
[53:06] I can't reveal myself to anyone else on
[53:08] the earth because I know Abraham will
[53:11] keep my word and I want to be a a person
[53:13] like that today I want to be a Son of
[53:15] God like that that though I'm called by
[53:17] faith and by election but I want to be
[53:19] somebody that keeps the word of God
[53:22] somebody who believes the promise of God
[53:24] and yet if we've made mistakes we don't
[53:26] just quit believing we don't we don't
[53:29] give up we don't well the thing to do is
[53:31] put another foot forward and I've seen
[53:33] people well I made a mistake I should
[53:35] quit Church no Now's the Time to go to
[53:37] church now's the time you need to be in
[53:39] the presence of God now's the time you
[53:41] need to accept what God's done for you
[53:44] let it be a lesson in your life let
[53:46] Revelation come to you let it be
[53:48] unfolded in a further way in your life
[53:50] and if you go if you study the message
[53:52] you'll find brother Bram uses that word
[53:53] unfolded when he talks about the nature
[53:56] of God and how he reveals himself to us
[53:58] he doesn't reveal himself all at once
[54:00] but he unfolds himself he even said that
[54:02] the revealing of the son of man was the
[54:05] unfolding of the son of man he's he's
[54:07] slowly revealing himself to us and as he
[54:10] reveals himself we come closer and we
[54:13] come closer and closer to him now
[54:16] Abraham made these mistakes because his
[54:18] Revelation wasn't what it should have
[54:20] been now look first he's told that he'll
[54:23] be a great nation go in your scriptures
[54:25] to Genesis chapter 12 if you have your
[54:27] Bible with with you this morning and
[54:30] I'll show you we we'll go over some of
[54:32] the things we've went over but then
[54:33] we're going to move on but I want to see
[54:35] I want you to see what God promised him
[54:38] what God showed him and what God didn't
[54:39] show him yeah Genesis 12:1 now the Lord
[54:42] said to Abram get out of thy country and
[54:45] from thy Kindred from thy Father's House
[54:47] unto a land that I will show you so the
[54:50] promise at this time is of a land that
[54:53] he's not shown yet but he knows it's
[54:55] there yeah he said 'I will make of thee
[54:57] a great nation I Will Bless thee make
[55:00] thy name Great Thou shalt be a blessing
[55:01] I will bless them that bless thee curse
[55:04] him that curseth thee and in thee shall
[55:06] all families of the earth be blessed he
[55:07] tells him what he's going to do but he
[55:09] doesn't tell him how he's going to do it
[55:13] right so go to Genesis 13 Genesis
[55:16] 13:14 so next he is shown the land in
[55:20] Genesis 13 the Lord said to Abram after
[55:23] that lot was separated from him lift up
[55:26] now now thine eyes so now he's fully
[55:28] obeyed God you remember he comes out
[55:31] he's fully obeyed God he's separated
[55:33] from unbelief he's walking in the land
[55:35] and now after lot is separated from him
[55:38] lift up your eyes and look from the
[55:40] place where thou art northward and
[55:42] Southward and Eastward and Westward for
[55:44] all the land which thou seest to thee
[55:47] will I give it and to thy seed forever I
[55:50] will make thy seed as the dust of the
[55:52] earth so that if a man can number the
[55:53] dust of the earth then shall thy seed
[55:56] also be numbered this is new information
[55:58] that he didn't give him before he had a
[56:00] promise he would make him great but he
[56:02] didn't know how he would make him great
[56:04] but now there's more information there's
[56:05] more Revelation that he's getting in his
[56:08] experience with God now he said I'll
[56:10] make your seed as the dust of the earth
[56:12] arise he said walk through the land in
[56:14] the length of it and in the breadth of
[56:16] it for I will give it unto thee so there
[56:18] was a time when the land was just a
[56:20] concept to Abraham there was a time when
[56:22] it seemed like that as we would say
[56:24] today living a Christian Life was just
[56:26] something that he could hope for
[56:27] something he wanted to do something that
[56:29] was a desire to him but now he could
[56:31] walk it he could he could go down the
[56:33] land and he could walk around it and see
[56:35] what it was and there Comes A Time In
[56:37] Our Lives when we are mature enough we
[56:39] begin to walk through the land that he's
[56:41] given us it's no longer just a promise
[56:44] but it's becoming a reality that we have
[56:46] what God promised
[56:48] us right but yet the it still wasn't
[56:51] complete the unfolding wasn't complete
[56:53] of what he wanted to do so he said I'm
[56:55] going to walk you you need to walk
[56:56] through the land and he said I've given
[56:58] it to you next in Genesis 15 Genesis
[57:03] 15:4 he shown that his air would come
[57:07] from him now this is important because
[57:10] it it means it's not going to be a proxy
[57:13] or in other words a uh it's not going to
[57:15] be his uh his Heir that he just gives
[57:18] his property to it's not going to be a
[57:20] elzer is trusted servant but his Heir
[57:23] would come from him Genesis 154 behold
[57:26] the word of the Lord came unto him
[57:27] saying this shall not be thine Heir the
[57:30] words elzer is trusted servant but he
[57:32] that shall come forth out of thine own
[57:35] bowels shall be thine Heir and he
[57:38] brought him forth AB Broad and said look
[57:40] now toward Heaven tell the Stars if thou
[57:43] be able to number them he said unto him
[57:46] so shall thy seed be so it's a further
[57:48] Revelation he's showing him oh Abraham
[57:51] Abraham this is going to be your seed
[57:53] all right your children yeah amen Wonder
[57:58] but now there's still something missing
[57:59] at this time from the story yeah and
[58:03] what's missing what is missing is
[58:06] Sarah's part in the
[58:09] Revelation Abraham's part has become
[58:12] clear but God has never spoken to Sarah
[58:17] yeah right now think about it he always
[58:19] spoke to Abraham and Sarah followed What
[58:23] Abraham said but God never spoke
[58:26] directly to Sarah until he revealed the
[58:29] secrets of her heart there in the tent
[58:32] yeah right before that she had never
[58:35] seen or heard the supernatural voice of
[58:40] God so she had to her part had to be
[58:43] revealed now we know Sarah had to have a
[58:46] body change right but she had not heard
[58:48] directly from God and she had to hear
[58:51] she had to see the sign of the son of
[58:53] man she had to see God revealed in flesh
[58:57] or she could not believe because we know
[58:59] Sarah had faith it wasn't just Abraham
[59:01] that had Faith but the Bible tells us in
[59:03] Hebrews 1111 through faith also Sarah
[59:07] herself look look at the language Paul
[59:09] uses he said not just Abraham not just
[59:12] cuz she's his wife although that's why
[59:13] she didn't die when she left but that's
[59:15] not the only thing but Sarah herself
[59:18] received strength oh I'm so happy that
[59:21] the bride is not just a bystander she's
[59:23] not just somebody this is the devil
[59:26] wants to attack you personally because
[59:28] he wants to say you're just going to be
[59:29] a bystander you don't really have a part
[59:31] you don't really have a a place to a
[59:33] role to play in the message of the hour
[59:35] the message is for preachers or the
[59:37] message is for uh for old people the
[59:39] message for somebody else but the
[59:40] message is for you this morning the
[59:43] promise is for every one of us can we
[59:46] believe that this morning it's for every
[59:48] one of us to grab a hold of and Satan
[59:50] attacks that Revelation yes but Sarah
[59:54] through faith Sarah herself
[59:56] received strength to conceive seed and
[59:59] was delivered of a child oh my when she
[1:00:02] was past age because she judged him
[1:00:05] faithful who had promised she judged him
[1:00:08] faithful it wasn't enough just for
[1:00:10] Abraham to judge him faithful right are
[1:00:12] you with me now she had to judge him
[1:00:15] faithful now we know that in this hour
[1:00:21] that whatever false Doctrine is taught
[1:00:23] and this is just my observation but
[1:00:26] believe that it's true it's taught in
[1:00:28] the absence of the opening of the word
[1:00:32] right because it's the opening of the
[1:00:34] word the the open book that teaches us
[1:00:36] the bride's part in the Revelation are
[1:00:41] you with me so far this morning right
[1:00:43] you have a part and Satan wants to
[1:00:46] attack your part what did the message
[1:00:47] come to do the message did not come to
[1:00:50] make us better at argument
[1:00:53] right right the message didn't come to
[1:00:57] make us more knowledgeable all
[1:00:59] right right why did the message come it
[1:01:03] comes so we ourselves yeah could receive
[1:01:07] strength yeah to
[1:01:10] conceive are you with me now we had to
[1:01:13] the bride had to receive strength to
[1:01:16] become the word in the hour that we live
[1:01:19] in this is the age when the bride would
[1:01:22] produce or become the manifestation of
[1:01:25] the fullness of the word so there was a
[1:01:28] partial unveiling where God spoke to
[1:01:30] Luther a certain thing and there was a
[1:01:32] partial unveiling where God spoke to
[1:01:34] Wesley a certain thing but then there
[1:01:35] had to come a fullness of the unveiling
[1:01:38] when God spoke in this age and what did
[1:01:40] he tell us it wasn't just for a prophet
[1:01:42] if it was just for a prophet how could
[1:01:44] oh my how could Sarah receive strength
[1:01:47] but he gave it to a prophet to give it
[1:01:49] to
[1:01:50] us so that we could receive strength to
[1:01:53] do what needed to be done in this hour
[1:01:56] so we could receive strength to be a
[1:01:58] Mark 16 church are you with me now so we
[1:02:01] could receive strength to do the Greater
[1:02:03] Works so we can receive strength to live
[1:02:05] in leoda and not be overcome by it so we
[1:02:08] could receive strength to overcome the
[1:02:09] anxiety that's in the land today so we
[1:02:11] can receive strength to overcome every
[1:02:14] bit of the depression and the and the
[1:02:16] nonsense that's out there in the world
[1:02:18] we had to overcome
[1:02:20] something so God said I'm going to send
[1:02:22] a fullness of the word so Sarah Rec
[1:02:25] recognizes her part yeah in the promise
[1:02:29] oh that's good yeah are you with me now
[1:02:32] that's why Satan hates the opening of
[1:02:34] the
[1:02:35] word right and whenever you see false
[1:02:38] Doctrine being taught usually it's not
[1:02:40] so much what they're teaching but what
[1:02:42] they're not
[1:02:45] teaching right because what what they're
[1:02:48] teaching may be an error but what
[1:02:51] they're not teaching is important
[1:02:54] because when you're not teaching the
[1:02:55] opening of the book and that the and
[1:02:57] that the message is complete and we have
[1:03:00] what we need then you're leaving out the
[1:03:03] bride's part you're waiting on a prophet
[1:03:05] to come and redo what happened on the
[1:03:08] plane of mamory right but we're not
[1:03:10] waiting on that we're on the other side
[1:03:13] what are we waiting on a body
[1:03:15] change are you with me
[1:03:17] now so it's the open book through that
[1:03:21] son of man Ministry that reveals the
[1:03:23] bride's part in
[1:03:26] Redemption without it the seed of
[1:03:28] Promise can be slightly
[1:03:31] doubted and denominations will form
[1:03:34] right right right and this is very
[1:03:37] important church I know it's teaching
[1:03:38] but it's really important you just hang
[1:03:40] with me for a
[1:03:41] minute if we could understand that thing
[1:03:43] it would really help
[1:03:44] us you know brother brandham talks about
[1:03:47] it this way he said remember that was
[1:03:48] not Jesus talking to Abraham there that
[1:03:51] could discern the thoughts and Sarah's
[1:03:52] mind behind him that was not Jesus he
[1:03:55] had not yet been born but was a man in
[1:03:56] human flesh that Abraham called Elohim
[1:03:58] the great Almighty showing Jesus said as
[1:04:00] it was in the days of Sodom watch
[1:04:02] closely in the days of Sodom so will it
[1:04:04] be at the coming of the son of man when
[1:04:05] the son of man is being revealed not no
[1:04:07] more as a church not no more the bride
[1:04:11] is called all right right so when
[1:04:13] brother brandom comes down to about the
[1:04:15] last three years of his ministry he
[1:04:16] begins to separate the bride and the
[1:04:20] church right he begins to show us the
[1:04:22] difference between the wise and the
[1:04:24] foolish between the bride in the church
[1:04:26] between those who go in a Rapture and
[1:04:28] those who remain here are you with me
[1:04:31] now between Abraham and lot and it
[1:04:33] begins to show us what the bride part is
[1:04:37] because there is a part for every one of
[1:04:39] us to play see I want to challenge you
[1:04:43] see we just don't want numbers although
[1:04:44] we want numbers empty pews never
[1:04:47] inspired anybody we want people to come
[1:04:48] to church I'd rather you be in church
[1:04:50] than out of church you're much better
[1:04:53] off coming to the house of God but but
[1:04:55] what I really would like to see is
[1:04:57] people becoming the word and I believe
[1:04:59] we're seeing that I I I don't give up on
[1:05:01] yourself Abraham was becoming the he
[1:05:03] made a lot of mistakes but he was still
[1:05:05] in the program of God all right and if
[1:05:08] you beat yourself up too much what you
[1:05:09] end up doing is you end up putting
[1:05:11] yourself out because you see the part
[1:05:14] the bride's part but you say it can't be
[1:05:16] me because if Satan can't keep you from
[1:05:18] believing in the opening of the word
[1:05:19] he'll try to get you to believe it's not
[1:05:21] for you and that it doesn't matter to
[1:05:24] you but I'll say we need to take every
[1:05:25] bit of this message we need to take what
[1:05:27] a prophet said and we need to begin to
[1:05:29] apply it in our lives why because this
[1:05:32] is the hour when we've got to become the
[1:05:34] word yes right we're going to be living
[1:05:37] examples living Bibles walking through
[1:05:39] the Earth that we live in now he said
[1:05:41] not no more as a church but the bride is
[1:05:43] called yeah in that day the son of man
[1:05:45] will be revealed what to join the church
[1:05:48] to the Head unite the marriage of the
[1:05:51] Bride the bridegroom call will come
[1:05:54] right through this when the son of man
[1:05:55] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:05:58] to unite the two together the church has
[1:06:03] to be the word how many believe that
[1:06:05] today he is the word and the two unites
[1:06:09] together and to do that it'll take the
[1:06:12] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:06:15] son of man yes oh my not a clergyman he
[1:06:18] said I don't know did you see what I
[1:06:20] mean see it son of man Jesus Christ will
[1:06:22] come down in human flesh Among Us will
[1:06:24] make his word so real that it'll unite
[1:06:27] now we recognize he did that in a
[1:06:29] prophet right in a prophet's body but he
[1:06:32] didn't stop revealing
[1:06:34] himself Oh my he didn't stop the son of
[1:06:37] man Ministry was not just a prophet
[1:06:40] standing there revealing the secrets of
[1:06:41] the heart are you with me now but the
[1:06:44] son of man is revealed in the bride sir
[1:06:47] because the son of man is the word so
[1:06:50] he'll make his words so real that it'll
[1:06:51] unite the church and him as one the
[1:06:53] bride and then she'll go home to the
[1:06:54] wedding supper she's already United he
[1:06:57] said see we go to the wedding supper not
[1:06:59] to the marriage he said the marriage of
[1:07:01] the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[1:07:02] going to the wedding supper when the
[1:07:03] word here unites with the person they
[1:07:07] two become
[1:07:08] one and then what does it do then it
[1:07:11] manifests what the son of man
[1:07:14] again when oh church when the word and
[1:07:18] the person become one it manifests the
[1:07:21] son of man again not the church
[1:07:24] theologians the son of man the word and
[1:07:27] and what the church yes becomes
[1:07:30] one oh my oh we could we can preach on
[1:07:33] that all day the word and the church
[1:07:36] right becomes one and what does that
[1:07:38] make you the
[1:07:40] bride Hallelujah flesh of his flesh bone
[1:07:43] of his bone power of his power are you
[1:07:46] with me now yes the word and the church
[1:07:49] becomes one whatever the son of man done
[1:07:51] he was the word the church does the same
[1:07:54] thing right oh Hallelujah so it is the
[1:07:58] opening of the word the revealing of the
[1:08:00] son of man that opens up the bride's
[1:08:03] part and separates the bride from the
[1:08:05] church turn with me to Revelation 61
[1:08:08] we'll read that one verse but you young
[1:08:10] people you need to understand this and
[1:08:12] all of us do we need to understand this
[1:08:14] what what was the opening of the
[1:08:16] seals look at Revelation 61 he said I
[1:08:19] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[1:08:20] seals and I heard as were the noise of
[1:08:22] Thunder one of the four Beast saying
[1:08:24] come and see
[1:08:26] now so you mark that and and now listen
[1:08:29] close he said notice the first seal open
[1:08:31] the first seal when it was open in the
[1:08:33] symbol form it thundered now what about
[1:08:37] when it's open in its reality form all
[1:08:39] right oh my people are waiting on the
[1:08:40] Thunders come on but it's already it's
[1:08:43] already happened he said the Thunders uh
[1:08:45] were the Revelation contained in the
[1:08:48] seals and watch but there was a symbol
[1:08:51] form and a reality form he said my it
[1:08:54] thundered as soon as the the lamb struck
[1:08:56] back the seal and what did it reveal not
[1:08:59] all of itself all right oh my so just
[1:09:03] like what happened with Abraham he
[1:09:05] didn't immediately reveal all of
[1:09:08] himself right there was a point where
[1:09:10] Abraham but he was it was revealed to
[1:09:12] Abraham as Abraham needed it hallelujah
[1:09:15] oh I believe he'll do the same thing for
[1:09:17] you he didn't always know God was
[1:09:19] Jehovah Gyra he didn't always know God
[1:09:22] was elai he didn't always know those
[1:09:24] things but there come a time it was
[1:09:26] revealed to him I believe we ought to
[1:09:27] trust God in our own lives you may not
[1:09:29] know what you want to know now you may
[1:09:31] not be able to see the rhyme or the
[1:09:32] reason for why things happen but as you
[1:09:34] need it he'll reveal himself to you yes
[1:09:37] sir through the opening of the word in
[1:09:39] this hour and I believe that we're
[1:09:41] living in a time when there's nothing
[1:09:42] held back yeah all right Hallelujah now
[1:09:46] look he said he said it thundered he
[1:09:49] said first it's with go it's with God
[1:09:52] next it's an ass symbol then it's
[1:09:56] revealed so watch the steps first it's
[1:09:58] with God Only God knows
[1:10:01] it right next it's in a symbol John sees
[1:10:05] it right right we have it written in the
[1:10:08] word then it's revealed three things he
[1:10:12] said see it's coming forth from the
[1:10:14] throne right first it can't be seen
[1:10:18] heard or nothing it's sealed up see
[1:10:21] there are people who still believe that
[1:10:23] that's the condition we're in M right
[1:10:26] that the Thunders have not come forth
[1:10:28] the the word has not been opened but and
[1:10:31] I'll say again I
[1:10:33] just I'm not hammering those people if a
[1:10:35] person believes that you just haven't
[1:10:37] come if you sit there today and say I
[1:10:38] don't have a clue what he's talking
[1:10:39] about well you will one day just store
[1:10:41] it in your memory
[1:10:43] in I believe God will lead you to that
[1:10:46] and it's not because I know more than
[1:10:48] you do it's just I I I've been benefited
[1:10:50] by sitting under a prophet's message and
[1:10:53] many of us can say Amen to that we
[1:10:54] benefit from sitting under a prophet's
[1:10:56] message and we know where we're
[1:10:59] at amen so first it can't be seen or
[1:11:02] heard or nothing it sealed up the Lamb's
[1:11:05] blood paid the price yeah it thundered
[1:11:09] when he spoke it out when he did a white
[1:11:11] horse rider started out and it still was
[1:11:14] a symbol he said now watch he said it
[1:11:16] would be known in the last day but it
[1:11:18] comes forth watch in a church symbol
[1:11:22] right a church symbol he said do you
[1:11:26] understand it church and the
[1:11:27] congregation says amen it comes forth in
[1:11:29] a symbol of a church that they know
[1:11:31] there is a seal so so the way it comes
[1:11:35] to the church is
[1:11:39] as wow I want to get real excited about
[1:11:43] this and You' think I was crazy but it
[1:11:45] comes to the church as a
[1:11:47] symbol yeah are you with me now it's a
[1:11:50] white horse riding a man riding on a
[1:11:52] white horse they don't know what it is
[1:11:55] they just have to guess at it it comes
[1:11:57] to the church as a symbol Oh my he said
[1:12:01] and they know that there is a seal but
[1:12:03] just what it is yet they don't know
[1:12:05] because it's a white horse rider and
[1:12:07] only is to be revealed at the last day
[1:12:10] when this actual seal is broken broken
[1:12:13] to who not to Christ but to the church
[1:12:16] yeah he said notice now oh my that just
[1:12:19] makes me tremble he said I hope that the
[1:12:22] church and I watch how he keeps calling
[1:12:23] the church the church it was a symol to
[1:12:25] the church he said I hope that the
[1:12:27] church truly understands it what I mean
[1:12:29] you people he said I'm going to call you
[1:12:31] bride yes sir that you'll understand it
[1:12:35] what's God doing he's showing Abraham
[1:12:37] her Sarah's part in the
[1:12:40] promise are you with me now he's showing
[1:12:43] to Sarah her part in the promise yeah
[1:12:46] and people just miss it yes but it's
[1:12:48] there yeah and what that means is that
[1:12:51] that now I can receive strength where
[1:12:54] before I could not produce the right
[1:12:57] thing yeah I could only by effort
[1:12:59] produce a wild man I could only by
[1:13:01] effort produce a denomination listen I
[1:13:03] can put the same before the opening of
[1:13:05] the word I can put the same effort in I
[1:13:07] do now and it would produce a
[1:13:09] denominational
[1:13:11] system right it would produce another
[1:13:13] organization but brother JT once the
[1:13:15] seals have been open and the Bible
[1:13:17] becomes a new book what happens now by
[1:13:19] the effort we put forth when you raise
[1:13:21] your hands in church when you come to
[1:13:22] the house of God when you preach when
[1:13:24] you sing what whatever it is that you do
[1:13:26] when you put forth that effort you're
[1:13:27] not working towards the denominational
[1:13:29] system what are you working for you're
[1:13:30] working towards the revelation of Who
[1:13:33] You Are God has shown you you're not
[1:13:36] church anymore you're the
[1:13:38] bride Oh Glory to God I'm going to call
[1:13:41] you
[1:13:42] bride so you'll understand it
[1:13:46] yes
[1:13:48] Hallelujah
[1:13:51] good now before the seals that's a good
[1:13:55] background for what we want to say and
[1:13:56] I'm halfway my time's halfway
[1:14:00] over God help us today before the seals
[1:14:04] Joel will be real short tonight so we
[1:14:05] don't have to worry about
[1:14:08] that before the seals were open to
[1:14:11] Abraham Sarah a type of the church
[1:14:14] before the bride part was revealed came
[1:14:16] up with an
[1:14:18] idea right now she didn't know her part
[1:14:21] so we want to blame Sarah and but she
[1:14:23] didn't realize Abraham knew his part
[1:14:26] she didn't know
[1:14:27] hers Genesis 16
[1:14:30] And1 now Sarah Abram's wife bear him no
[1:14:33] children she had a handmaid an Egyptian
[1:14:36] whose name was Hagar now during this
[1:14:40] time the word of God had been trying
[1:14:43] Sarah right the Bible tells us the word
[1:14:46] his word Joseph's word tried him right
[1:14:49] because it was the very promise that
[1:14:51] made his life
[1:14:53] difficult right right I'm just going to
[1:14:56] tell you this morning that's what gets
[1:14:58] you that's why you go through
[1:14:59] difficulties many times and when you're
[1:15:01] not a Christian you can just kind of do
[1:15:02] whatever you want to do but when you
[1:15:04] become a Christian Satan trains his guns
[1:15:06] right on
[1:15:07] you right because you're you're doing
[1:15:10] something so Satan's trying to destroy
[1:15:12] you as a Christian why but what's he
[1:15:14] trying to do he's trying to he's trying
[1:15:16] to make you doubt the promise and so the
[1:15:18] any delay of the promise without the
[1:15:21] proper
[1:15:23] Revelation yeah are you with me now now
[1:15:25] a delay of the promise without an open
[1:15:28] book with oh god without the message of
[1:15:31] the hour without something that tells us
[1:15:33] who we are yeah a delay of the promise
[1:15:36] will cause us to begin to
[1:15:38] fidget spiritually and we begin to look
[1:15:41] for an exit we begin to look for a way
[1:15:43] out we begin to look for something else
[1:15:45] to come we begin to look for another
[1:15:47] Prophet or another messenger or
[1:15:48] something else because there's been a
[1:15:50] delay in what in how we perceive and so
[1:15:52] there's a pressure on those who who must
[1:15:56] fulfill their part but they don't
[1:15:58] realize what that part really is because
[1:16:01] and so she's waiting there there's this
[1:16:03] pressure and she said well maybe if I
[1:16:06] just left the
[1:16:08] picture maybe I'm the problem all
[1:16:13] right all right now come on Church you
[1:16:15] know you think like that sometimes well
[1:16:18] the message is okay I believe a prophet
[1:16:20] came maybe I'm the problem come
[1:16:25] maybe I can't make it maybe I'm no good
[1:16:30] right come on we're human beings we
[1:16:32] think like that don't we the devil come
[1:16:34] to you and tell you you you don't have a
[1:16:36] part in it what you need is a revelation
[1:16:39] of this message that no matter how many
[1:16:41] mistakes I make no matter what happens
[1:16:43] in my life no matter what comes or what
[1:16:45] goes I know that God is has his hand on
[1:16:48] my life I know I'm his bride I know I
[1:16:50] love him I know I love his voice I know
[1:16:52] I love to go to the house of God I may
[1:16:54] be going through hell and back but I
[1:16:56] know that God is still with me I know
[1:16:58] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:00] forever he never leaves me he never
[1:17:02] forsakes me oh church we ought to grab a
[1:17:04] hold of that promise today he never
[1:17:06] leaves me he never gives up on me he
[1:17:10] never oh though I might struggle he
[1:17:12] never gives up on
[1:17:14] me hallelujah it's this message that
[1:17:17] teaches us
[1:17:18] that Hallelujah you were called you were
[1:17:21] elected you were a seed of God you see
[1:17:24] why that's important cuz the devil's
[1:17:27] trying to get you to form another
[1:17:29] denomination
[1:17:31] yeah oh my and Sarah said to Abraham
[1:17:35] behold now the Lord hath restrained me
[1:17:38] from bearing oh it might work in
[1:17:40] somebody else but not for
[1:17:43] me I pray that go in unto my maid maybe
[1:17:47] that I may obtain children by her and
[1:17:49] Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah
[1:17:53] and Sarah Abram's wife took took Hagar
[1:17:55] her maid the Egyptian after Abram had
[1:17:57] dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and
[1:17:59] gave her to her husband Abram to be his
[1:18:03] wife oh my what a terrible
[1:18:06] mistake out of this Union comes ishmail
[1:18:10] and ishma was a wild man and still is to
[1:18:14] this day amen this was the
[1:18:17] beginning oh Church yeah now look
[1:18:22] brother brandom looks at this in a
[1:18:23] unique way he he re
[1:18:25] recognizes that what they did was wrong
[1:18:29] and was out of the will of God it was
[1:18:30] the permissive will of God not the
[1:18:32] perfect will of God and God would not
[1:18:34] allow ishmail to be Heir with
[1:18:37] Isaac but he also recognizes something
[1:18:40] in it that I wouldn't
[1:18:43] see without a
[1:18:45] prophet he said it's the beginning of
[1:18:47] the
[1:18:50] promise a lot of you have been through
[1:18:52] some things you you've walked down a
[1:18:54] road you and you realize there's all
[1:18:56] kinds of trouble and strife and maybe
[1:18:58] you've done some things you're not proud
[1:18:59] of and I'm sure we all have but listen
[1:19:02] he recognizes something in this
[1:19:04] mistake that was more than just oh my
[1:19:08] not more than just uh it was more than
[1:19:11] just a a mistake or or something like
[1:19:13] that but it was the beginning of the
[1:19:16] Fulfillment of the
[1:19:19] promise yeah we'll get to the quote in a
[1:19:22] minute look he said here we are
[1:19:24] presented with a picture oh the seed
[1:19:28] started yeah oh my the seed of Promise
[1:19:34] started in a slightly doubted doubt of
[1:19:38] the original promise see how it starts
[1:19:42] low oh my in doubt in the original
[1:19:45] promise now listen you're not you may
[1:19:48] you say well I know brother Ben I
[1:19:49] haven't always been in the perfect will
[1:19:50] of God and maybe to be bride you have to
[1:19:53] have always been the perfect will of God
[1:19:55] well you won't find that in the
[1:19:56] scripture oh
[1:19:58] my no Prophet was ever always in the
[1:20:01] perfect will of
[1:20:04] God we can look at the scripture and
[1:20:06] find that right no no no no member of
[1:20:09] the bride was ever always in the perfect
[1:20:12] will of God but God uses the permissive
[1:20:16] will yeah brother brand teaches us is to
[1:20:19] glorify his perfect will now we can't
[1:20:21] even hardly comprehend that but he does
[1:20:24] it now that doesn't give us an excuse
[1:20:27] because once we have the revelation we
[1:20:29] got to walk in it we can't back up on it
[1:20:32] right so it doesn't doesn't give us an
[1:20:34] excuse but it does allow us in our lives
[1:20:38] to
[1:20:39] not to not say well my life has been
[1:20:42] useless my life has been worthless
[1:20:44] everything I went through was just a it
[1:20:46] was just terrible and then then I got
[1:20:47] saved and everything was better but
[1:20:49] everything back there didn't matter no
[1:20:50] it did matter because God used that
[1:20:53] somehow he's big up that he used even
[1:20:55] your mistakes to glorify his
[1:20:59] will good oh church now look he said it
[1:21:04] started low God promised Abraham through
[1:21:07] Sarah to have this child but now watch
[1:21:09] the first seat of Abraham by the bonds
[1:21:11] woman came by Sarah doubting that this
[1:21:13] could happen because she was old and
[1:21:15] past the age of bearing now that's how
[1:21:17] the church starts yeah that's how it
[1:21:20] always starts you start from the bottom
[1:21:22] yeah you don't start from the top a man
[1:21:25] trying to climb a ladder tries to get on
[1:21:26] top first he'll break his
[1:21:30] neck are you with me now yeah you got to
[1:21:33] start somewhere yeah say brother Ben I
[1:21:35] don't know where to start start right
[1:21:36] now all right start right here do you
[1:21:38] believe Jesus saved start there you
[1:21:41] believe that that you ought to be
[1:21:42] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:44] Christ for remission of your sins start
[1:21:46] there start with acts 238 start there
[1:21:50] and begin to believe
[1:21:52] God Amen you not going to be don't beat
[1:21:55] yourself up because you're not what
[1:21:57] somebody else is I know sometimes kids
[1:21:58] will backslide and go out in the world
[1:22:00] and then their parents maybe are there
[1:22:01] in church and and they come back to the
[1:22:03] church and they realize well my parents
[1:22:05] are pretty good people well I wish I
[1:22:08] could but I could never be what they are
[1:22:09] well they always weren't always what
[1:22:11] they
[1:22:15] are right I think I can speak for all of
[1:22:18] us in the most mature members in this
[1:22:20] church when I say that we were not
[1:22:21] always what we are and we hope that we
[1:22:24] won't always be what we are right right
[1:22:28] we trust that every service we're being
[1:22:30] changed and we're being remade and we're
[1:22:32] being built and we're and we're growing
[1:22:34] and we're becoming something different
[1:22:36] and we're becoming a better worshipper
[1:22:37] and we're becoming a better we're
[1:22:39] becoming more tuned into the service and
[1:22:40] we're getting more on fire for God and
[1:22:42] we're receiving baptism after baptism of
[1:22:44] the Holy Ghost are you with me
[1:22:46] now everybody's got to go through
[1:22:49] that so the seed starts with a slightly
[1:22:52] doubted promise that's how it always
[1:22:55] starts and here we find the beginning of
[1:22:57] the promise there it is of god being
[1:23:00] made manifest through a slightly doubted
[1:23:04] interrupted program of
[1:23:07] God see but that's the same way oh
[1:23:11] church that's the same way that
[1:23:13] denominations come up and Luther come up
[1:23:15] Luther did a lot of things we wouldn't
[1:23:17] allow today said a lot of things we
[1:23:19] don't believe today but he had one thing
[1:23:22] the just shall live by faith
[1:23:24] and the seed of Promise
[1:23:26] started but it wasn't fully revealed yet
[1:23:29] what it would be and it become a wild
[1:23:30] man become a denomination but the sced
[1:23:32] moved on the life moved on and it come
[1:23:35] through Wesley and it come through
[1:23:37] Pentecost every age they slightly
[1:23:38] doubted the promise but it come to an
[1:23:40] age when there will be a bride who will
[1:23:42] not
[1:23:43] fall who will not doubt the promise at
[1:23:45] all oh I believe that's us today
[1:23:49] yeah you believe that you got to believe
[1:23:52] that that's you yeah at some point you
[1:23:54] got to well I go to church but do you
[1:23:56] believe that that's you come on amen
[1:24:00] amen now ishmail was a Seed of Abraham
[1:24:04] the seed of Promise slightly doubted but
[1:24:07] Isaac was the full seed of
[1:24:10] promise right Paul says that the law was
[1:24:14] the same thing it was the promise
[1:24:16] slightly doubted Galatians 4:23 tell me
[1:24:19] ye that desire to be under the law do
[1:24:22] you not hear the law
[1:24:26] oh we could stop and preach there for a
[1:24:27] little
[1:24:28] while right now you may start there you
[1:24:32] may start with I just want to get over
[1:24:33] this and I just want to stop doing this
[1:24:35] and it may start
[1:24:37] legally but that's not where God wants
[1:24:39] to take
[1:24:41] you now look if you desire to be under
[1:24:43] the law do you not hear the law in other
[1:24:44] words if you're going to impose the law
[1:24:46] on
[1:24:47] others you better be ready to fulfill
[1:24:51] all the law yourself
[1:24:55] right and a person that's guilty of one
[1:24:57] is guilty of the whole right so that's
[1:25:00] why we don't come under the law right
[1:25:02] all we can do is surrender young people
[1:25:05] are you hearing me if you want to be
[1:25:07] closer to God all you can do is
[1:25:09] surrender to him just give into him just
[1:25:12] find you an altar find a place where you
[1:25:14] can pray you you people if you've been
[1:25:16] in a place that's bad and you've made a
[1:25:18] lot of mistakes find a place where you
[1:25:20] can pray surrender yourself to God it's
[1:25:23] not about God wants to give you the Holy
[1:25:25] Ghost he wants to fill your life he
[1:25:26] wants to help you but you just got to
[1:25:28] let go of yourself you got to let go of
[1:25:31] that doubt you got to separate from
[1:25:33] it but you can't you sit there say well
[1:25:36] once I live the law then I'll be a
[1:25:37] Christian nobody lives the
[1:25:41] law right we live Grace but the reason
[1:25:44] we live like we do we don't believe in
[1:25:46] living like a bunch of a bunch of
[1:25:49] heathens but the reason we live the way
[1:25:51] we do is because the seed of promise
[1:25:54] it's the seed of Promise Isa oh my Isaac
[1:25:57] was the seed of promise and we are the
[1:25:59] seed of promise not the seed of a
[1:26:01] slightly doubted promise but the seed of
[1:26:02] promise we are not under the law but
[1:26:04] under grace and grace is what produces
[1:26:07] the right Works in our lives listen to
[1:26:10] me if you hold your spouse to a standard
[1:26:14] of the law they'll never measure
[1:26:19] up boy got
[1:26:22] quiet what are we doing dur
[1:26:24] ourselves if you hold your pastor to a
[1:26:27] standard of the law he'll never measure
[1:26:30] up yet Jesus came to fulfill the law are
[1:26:33] you with me but he was the only one who
[1:26:35] ever lived like that right but now his
[1:26:38] life comes back into us and everything
[1:26:40] good we do is attributes to that yeah
[1:26:44] right it attributes to that you cannot
[1:26:46] live under the law because if you do
[1:26:49] your expectations of others you begin to
[1:26:51] make
[1:26:52] lists right people under the law were
[1:26:55] great at making lists yeah right and if
[1:26:58] you keep this keep my list you're in
[1:27:00] yeah right but the problem is somebody
[1:27:02] else has a different list yeah with your
[1:27:05] name on it and when I see brother Jeff
[1:27:08] do all of these things then I'll
[1:27:11] know when I see brother Danny do all
[1:27:13] these things I don't know come on don't
[1:27:16] you realize we're not called to that
[1:27:18] we're not called to be under the law
[1:27:20] we're called to be under
[1:27:22] grace and and the the key is surrender
[1:27:25] and that's why what I look for in
[1:27:26] somebody that comes is not what they're
[1:27:29] doing I don't look at that what I'm
[1:27:31] looking for is not what they're doing or
[1:27:33] what they have done what I'm looking for
[1:27:35] is their willingness to acknowledge I'm
[1:27:37] a sinner I need help I want to come
[1:27:39] under Authority I want to come under
[1:27:41] headship not the authority of the church
[1:27:42] or the headship of the church the
[1:27:43] headship of God I want to come under the
[1:27:46] power of God I want to see a move in my
[1:27:49] life if you want that that it's there
[1:27:51] for
[1:27:52] you amen
[1:27:54] good yes
[1:27:56] sir so Isaac is birthed by the will of
[1:28:00] God he's not he's not under the law he
[1:28:03] said it written that Abraham had two
[1:28:04] sons the one by a bondade the other by a
[1:28:06] free woman yeah but he who was of the
[1:28:08] Bond woman was born after the flesh but
[1:28:11] he of the free woman was by
[1:28:13] promise Isaac is birthed by the will of
[1:28:15] God ishma is birthed by Abraham's effort
[1:28:18] listen the Bible tells us to wait on the
[1:28:21] Lord it says even the youths how many
[1:28:24] youths do we have here if you consider
[1:28:25] yourself young raise your hand praise
[1:28:28] God I see some white-headed people with
[1:28:29] their hands
[1:28:31] up listen listen if if you're a youth
[1:28:34] today it said even the youth shall be
[1:28:37] shall faint and be weary the young men
[1:28:40] shall utterly fall
[1:28:43] allach oh but look at the next verse but
[1:28:46] they young or old that wait upon the
[1:28:48] Lord shall renew their strength they
[1:28:51] shall Mount up with wings like eagles
[1:28:53] they shall run in be weary they shall
[1:28:55] walk and not F why because the power of
[1:28:57] God moves you to the direction you need
[1:28:59] to go
[1:29:01] amen all you got to do be is willing
[1:29:04] yeah that's right I challenge you today
[1:29:08] you say I can't live it I can't do it I
[1:29:10] can't be a believer I can't there's no
[1:29:12] way I can ever accept the message I
[1:29:13] challenge you today on now you just
[1:29:15] surrender yourself and see what God does
[1:29:17] that's right thank you Lord that's right
[1:29:20] oh my he said how don't you know that
[1:29:22] because he did it for me and do it for
[1:29:24] you but you got to be willing to
[1:29:26] surrender yourself very
[1:29:32] good Sarah got in a hurry and produced a
[1:29:35] wild man Eve did the same thing got in a
[1:29:39] hurry before Adam get to her in the
[1:29:41] proper way eve took another route David
[1:29:45] did the same thing bringing back the ark
[1:29:47] yeah it was right to bring back the ark
[1:29:49] it was right to have a meeting it was
[1:29:51] right to worship yeah but the way he did
[1:29:54] did it brother BR said there wasn't a
[1:29:55] place prepared for it yet yeah and he
[1:29:57] didn't consult a
[1:29:59] prophet oh my brother BR Ties That to
[1:30:01] the opening of the word he said in
[1:30:02] denominational ages there was no place
[1:30:04] prepared for it but now there is yeah
[1:30:07] amen so David did that thing now he
[1:30:10] brought back the ark and he did the same
[1:30:11] thing that Abra or that Sarah did they
[1:30:13] that have the spirit of God wait for
[1:30:15] these things he says And when they see
[1:30:17] those things they believe those things
[1:30:21] oh how he's talking about the the signs
[1:30:23] and and the the cloud and the pillar of
[1:30:24] fire and he said they that wait on the
[1:30:26] Lord that that ought to be every one of
[1:30:27] us to this morning we must wait on the
[1:30:29] Lord or we'll fall but if we wait on the
[1:30:31] Lord we wait for those things and when
[1:30:33] we see those things they believe those
[1:30:35] things again he said they wait on the
[1:30:36] Lord waiting and when they do and they
[1:30:38] see the promise of today being
[1:30:40] Vindicated it renews their faith in his
[1:30:42] word because he promised to do it and
[1:30:45] here he is doing it glory to God oh it
[1:30:48] does my heart good when I see the word
[1:30:50] Vindicated this message isn't all just
[1:30:52] Theory all right come on right but it
[1:30:55] works it works listen if you believe it
[1:30:58] works yeah there's some wonderful
[1:30:59] testimonies some of y'all don't even
[1:31:01] know about yet but God's working right
[1:31:02] now God's doing things right now he's
[1:31:06] moving right now Sister Sandra's been
[1:31:08] sending me testimony seems like every
[1:31:10] other day she s me she said I know I've
[1:31:12] been healed I know I was healed the
[1:31:14] ringing in my ear I know I was healed my
[1:31:15] blood sugar is better today than it was
[1:31:17] yesterday that's the faith of Abraham
[1:31:19] you believe that hold on to that make a
[1:31:22] positive confession I know I'm going to
[1:31:24] make it I know I'm going to I'll just
[1:31:26] put one foot in front of another I can
[1:31:28] do this not by my own effort but by the
[1:31:31] power of God in Me
[1:31:33] Yeah renews faith in the word because we
[1:31:37] see it and here he is doing it yeah
[1:31:40] Hallelujah brother brand said then
[1:31:42] there's no doubt God speaks his word
[1:31:45] first speaks and then the spirit that's
[1:31:47] bringing it does the thing that the word
[1:31:50] said it would do yeah Hallelujah brother
[1:31:54] brandom says this again about waiting on
[1:31:55] the Lord he said move just as far as God
[1:31:58] let you
[1:31:59] move and then wait on the lord it's not
[1:32:02] that you don't make any effort it's not
[1:32:04] that you don't try to serve God in the
[1:32:06] best of your capacity but move as far as
[1:32:08] you can move right good and then wait on
[1:32:11] the
[1:32:12] Lord they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:32:14] renew their strength Abraham and Sarah
[1:32:16] didn't
[1:32:17] wait most ishs are born out of Good
[1:32:22] Intentions right brother brandom taught
[1:32:24] that the church like
[1:32:26] Israel chose law for grace in other
[1:32:29] words they tried to protect what they
[1:32:31] had and they organized it made a law out
[1:32:34] of it
[1:32:35] died sometimes we do the same thing we
[1:32:39] get a legalistic attitude and and and
[1:32:42] maybe it's because we knew that we were
[1:32:44] saved from a life of sin we know how bad
[1:32:46] sin is yeah so we begin to get we want
[1:32:49] to be extra careful with our children we
[1:32:50] want to be extra careful with with those
[1:32:52] in the in the church that go to church
[1:32:54] with us we got to be careful with
[1:32:56] that because ultimately it's going to
[1:32:59] take the strength of the Lord if they're
[1:33:02] going to make it yeah because if we're
[1:33:04] not careful see we know you how do you
[1:33:07] know that you've applied legalistic
[1:33:09] ideas well it's because you blame other
[1:33:11] people for
[1:33:13] failing in other words you blame other
[1:33:15] people for you failing that's good when
[1:33:17] you blame someone else for the failures
[1:33:19] of your own life what is that it shows
[1:33:21] that you had a legalistic mindset
[1:33:23] towards the wor
[1:33:25] because if you had if you if you really
[1:33:27] understood how God works you'd know God
[1:33:29] I know you're working in my life I can't
[1:33:31] see it but I know you're
[1:33:33] working right and so you begin to get
[1:33:36] these expectations of others well I'll
[1:33:37] go to church as long as no one ever
[1:33:39] offends me
[1:33:42] well all right you won't last long
[1:33:46] yeah right yes sir or I'll go to church
[1:33:50] as long as I don't ever offend
[1:33:52] nobody you won't last
[1:33:57] song see and and God still deals with us
[1:34:00] he loves us but we're just trying to
[1:34:02] produce something by our own efforts
[1:34:04] yeah but maybe you're raised in church
[1:34:07] you just want to keep those standards
[1:34:08] high and we should keep our standards
[1:34:11] high but be careful not to wrap the word
[1:34:14] in your opinion amen right because there
[1:34:18] is a word that's true and we believe it
[1:34:20] but we need to be careful not to wrap it
[1:34:22] in our opinion
[1:34:24] listen the Bible speaks about the
[1:34:25] Pharisees said they bind heavy burdens
[1:34:27] Grievous to be born lay them on men's
[1:34:29] shoulders but they themselves will not
[1:34:30] move them with one of their fingers see
[1:34:33] legalism doesn't produce Holiness it
[1:34:35] produces Hypocrites
[1:34:37] amen ask me how I
[1:34:42] know I see preachers I know preachers
[1:34:45] have left the message and gone back to
[1:34:46] Pentecost and they've gone back to a
[1:34:47] Pentecostal idea of Salvation if I can
[1:34:49] just make enough effort God will see my
[1:34:51] effort and and and and save me listen I
[1:34:54] I was raised around that
[1:34:56] stuff right we come up in the wesland
[1:34:58] Holiness Church and and but dad found
[1:35:00] out about the message but that was our
[1:35:01] still our Doctrine was Wesley and
[1:35:03] Holiness that's the way I was raised and
[1:35:05] I'll say this it did not produce
[1:35:06] Holiness right It produced outward
[1:35:09] Holiness and inward corruption right
[1:35:12] produced
[1:35:13] Hypocrites again I got personal
[1:35:15] knowledge of that listen brother Bram
[1:35:17] said Jesus said man shall not live by
[1:35:19] bread alone but by every word that
[1:35:21] proceedeth out of the mouth of God you
[1:35:23] say well he didn't mean it he was
[1:35:25] talking to people who were theologians
[1:35:26] those priests great great great great
[1:35:28] great grandfathers had to be priests to
[1:35:30] misconstrue one word of it absolutely a
[1:35:32] death penalty that had to be stoned for
[1:35:34] one word to be missed and people are so
[1:35:35] worried about that oh if I go hear that
[1:35:37] preacher I might hear something that's
[1:35:38] wrong if I go hear that preacher at the
[1:35:40] meeting I he might be a little bit
[1:35:41] emotional more emotional than me and
[1:35:44] I've wrapped the word in my opinion so I
[1:35:46] can't receive from anything that's more
[1:35:48] emotional than
[1:35:50] me huh or less emotional than me all
[1:35:53] right what is the word wrapped in an
[1:35:55] opinion right and that might be the very
[1:35:57] person that could help you cuz they're
[1:35:59] different enough from you to help you
[1:36:01] out right right but to miscon through
[1:36:04] one word to these priests they had to be
[1:36:06] stoned they they knew the message yeah
[1:36:09] they knew Moses word yeah but listen
[1:36:12] what they did but they had the wrong
[1:36:14] interpretation of it therefore when the
[1:36:16] word itself when God promised to send
[1:36:18] the Messiah and send it in the very
[1:36:20] swaddling cloth that he promised it
[1:36:22] would come in in they had a different
[1:36:25] swaddling for it to be wrapped in it was
[1:36:29] wrapped in a
[1:36:31] pinion oh church I I got to take a few
[1:36:34] more minutes I've got nine minutes left
[1:36:35] but I'm going take a few more minutes
[1:36:36] and get through this just bear with me
[1:36:38] he said let me say this so it is today
[1:36:41] that they don't get it it's not in the
[1:36:43] swaddling of denominationalism or
[1:36:46] intellectual you'll never be able to
[1:36:48] please God intellectually that's not how
[1:36:50] you do it it's in the swaddling of the
[1:36:52] power and the resur ction and the
[1:36:54] manifestation of the Risen Christ all
[1:36:56] right the way God promised it not in the
[1:36:58] swaddling you know what the swaddling
[1:37:00] was the cloth they wrapped around the
[1:37:02] baby Jesus and because you come in the
[1:37:05] form wrapped in the way that he was
[1:37:07] God's wrapped gift you've heard brother
[1:37:09] Brandon preach on it God's WRA gift he
[1:37:11] come in a way that they did not expect
[1:37:13] him to come because of their opinions
[1:37:15] but he come exactly how the word said he
[1:37:17] would come but it wasn't in the
[1:37:19] swaddling of people's thoughts listen
[1:37:21] brother Brandon was dealing with our
[1:37:22] subject I hav haven't gotten off my
[1:37:24] subject he said Hagar by one little
[1:37:27] slight difference through woman not
[1:37:29] through Abraham now Abraham didn't want
[1:37:31] to do it but God let him do it same
[1:37:33] thing he let balam go on yeah right now
[1:37:36] notice by slightly differing with it she
[1:37:39] brought forth ishmail on which was a
[1:37:42] wild man never conquered live by his bow
[1:37:45] he was a wild man he is yet today I said
[1:37:50] we need to let God be God are you with
[1:37:53] me now yeah I'm not going to preach at
[1:37:55] you again till the meeting so you just
[1:37:56] hang with me a
[1:37:59] minute now it's a serious
[1:38:02] thing when we get brother brand talks
[1:38:04] about getting in a hurry in our personal
[1:38:06] lives he said it's a serious thing when
[1:38:07] we go to choose a wife I use this
[1:38:10] because I know there's several of our
[1:38:11] kids starting to get older and they need
[1:38:13] to start hearing it now amen he said am
[1:38:17] man for the vows here is until death do
[1:38:19] we part that's how we should keep it you
[1:38:21] take that vow before God the only death
[1:38:23] will separate you he said I think we
[1:38:25] should a man in his right mind is
[1:38:26] planning a future he should choose that
[1:38:28] wife very careful be careful what you're
[1:38:31] doing and a woman choosing a husband or
[1:38:33] accepting the choice of a husband should
[1:38:35] be real careful what she's doing
[1:38:37] especially said in these days a man
[1:38:39] should think and pray before he chooses
[1:38:42] a
[1:38:43] wife now you say what does that have to
[1:38:45] do with Abraham and Sarah well they got
[1:38:47] in a
[1:38:48] hurry and messed up God's program that's
[1:38:51] right amen and yet we see the grace in
[1:38:53] that yeah that he used it to the
[1:38:55] beginning of the starting of the seed
[1:38:57] right and many of you have you know if
[1:39:00] you're saved you're saved God don't see
[1:39:02] none of it but yet you made those
[1:39:04] mistakes you got to deal with the scars
[1:39:06] and you've made those mistakes and I
[1:39:08] think a person who really understands
[1:39:09] what that is you'd never want your
[1:39:11] children to go through the same thing
[1:39:12] right right and so that's why we we we
[1:39:15] we we stress to our children we want
[1:39:17] God's perfect will your marriage will be
[1:39:19] so much better if you want God's perfect
[1:39:21] will find somebody who's qual ified and
[1:39:24] full of the Holy
[1:39:26] Ghost find somebody and that you know
[1:39:29] that is before you get too invested in
[1:39:31] the relationship oh my yeah right and
[1:39:35] I'm GNA embarrass Gabe because he's back
[1:39:37] and they've been gone for a while so I
[1:39:38] haven't been able to embarrass him and
[1:39:39] Millie but but what was it three years
[1:39:42] ago that that we had meetings and and so
[1:39:45] this is their kind of their third
[1:39:46] anniversary of meeting but I think it
[1:39:47] was in May the first time but three
[1:39:50] years ago Gabe was looking for a wife
[1:39:53] and he had had some different
[1:39:55] relationships and he told me he said I'm
[1:39:57] not looking for a girlfriend I'm looking
[1:39:59] for a
[1:40:01] wife M's turning so red back there sorry
[1:40:04] sorry guys I know you can take
[1:40:09] it and God's working in their lives I
[1:40:12] thank God for
[1:40:13] that but he but he did the right thing
[1:40:16] yes sir what he do he didn't just sit
[1:40:18] there and stew about it or go out in the
[1:40:20] world and run away from church and I
[1:40:22] just go marry somebody in the world and
[1:40:23] I hope it works sir oh but what did he
[1:40:25] do he he come to his Pastor he said look
[1:40:28] I I I need I need some get some things
[1:40:30] right in my own life I need to I need I
[1:40:32] need to get down to business with God
[1:40:34] and I need a wife I said we'll just pray
[1:40:36] that way and and it wasn't very long at
[1:40:38] all until Here Comes Millie of course we
[1:40:41] all got en encourage them to talk to one
[1:40:43] another CU sometimes you have to do
[1:40:47] that but you see what happens when God's
[1:40:51] in it yes sir you'll still go through
[1:40:54] things you will still
[1:40:56] suffer and suffering is part of life you
[1:40:59] may suffer more than others much more
[1:41:02] than others but you don't you realize
[1:41:04] God put us together we we we come God's
[1:41:08] provided way and did what God wanted us
[1:41:10] to do and when God puts us together what
[1:41:12] God puts together let no man put us
[1:41:15] son right and so I guess the moral of
[1:41:17] that story is go to meetings
[1:41:19] [Laughter]
[1:41:26] I can think of worse reasons to go to
[1:41:30] meetings right look but let's think
[1:41:34] spiritually now see if we get invested
[1:41:36] in a relationship with an idea or a
[1:41:39] Doctrine or a
[1:41:40] church that isn't right but we see it we
[1:41:43] it makes us happy we think oh they've
[1:41:45] got an intellectual twist they got a
[1:41:47] certain Doctrine or certain something we
[1:41:49] want to see what kind of child would be
[1:41:51] born from it all right ishmail was
[1:41:53] Abraham's seed but he was born of a
[1:41:56] slightly doubted promise yeah we are not
[1:41:58] just any Seed of Abraham we are seed of
[1:42:01] the promise the book is open we don't
[1:42:04] have to make those mistakes again why
[1:42:07] we've got an open book yeah now look
[1:42:10] haar Hagar was an Egyptian and we know
[1:42:11] she'd probably come from Pharaoh's house
[1:42:13] when Abraham and Sarah were backslid in
[1:42:15] Genesis 12:16 he entreated Abram well
[1:42:17] for for Sarah's sake and he had sheep
[1:42:20] and oxen and he asses and Men servants
[1:42:22] and Maid servants and she asses and
[1:42:24] camels and and so he began to give
[1:42:26] Abraham stuff and that's probably how he
[1:42:27] got it in a back sting condition right
[1:42:30] that's why we need to stay close to God
[1:42:32] because we end up with a Hagar in our
[1:42:35] life look at how God deals with Hagar
[1:42:38] now I want you to see something and
[1:42:40] you're going to see the grace of
[1:42:42] God
[1:42:43] Hagar is told to do what she did wasn't
[1:42:47] her fault brother random says
[1:42:50] that and but ishmail was born and is was
[1:42:53] Abraham's natural seed just as much as
[1:42:56] Isaac's but he was didn't come in the
[1:42:57] proper
[1:42:58] channel right and that's why ishma still
[1:43:01] survives today the children of ishmail
[1:43:03] yes when ishmail was conceived Sarah
[1:43:06] began to be despised by Hagar so there
[1:43:09] was trouble in the home and if you're
[1:43:11] thinking about polygamy don't do
[1:43:14] it because every time we see polygamy in
[1:43:16] the scripture you see Strife in the
[1:43:19] home right so what does Hagar do Hagar
[1:43:22] Hagar runs away
[1:43:23] and the angel of the Lord appears to her
[1:43:26] remember the story Sarah treated her she
[1:43:30] treated Sarah badly she in other words
[1:43:32] she began to think well I could you know
[1:43:35] I had a baby you couldn't and so and so
[1:43:38] she begins to treat Sarah badly so Sarah
[1:43:40] runs her
[1:43:41] off now we know and I want you to
[1:43:44] understand this today God doesn't only
[1:43:46] speak to message people
[1:43:49] right he doesn't only deal with people
[1:43:51] who have a revelation right like we have
[1:43:55] he deals with whoever will cry out to
[1:43:58] him right but even the church though it
[1:44:01] come wrong right but even that God still
[1:44:04] sends this presence anoints y right the
[1:44:08] same anointing maybe that we would have
[1:44:10] right but they don't have they don't
[1:44:12] have the word that's the difference yeah
[1:44:14] but they have an anointing because
[1:44:16] they're still Abraham seed if we say it
[1:44:18] that way just not the right one now God
[1:44:21] doesn't only speak to message people in
[1:44:22] Genesis 169 the angel of the Lord come
[1:44:25] down to Hagar said un her return to thy
[1:44:28] mistress and submit thyself under her
[1:44:30] hand yeah and the angel of the Lord said
[1:44:32] I will multiply thy seed exceedingly it
[1:44:35] shall not be numbered for multitude and
[1:44:37] the angel of the Lord said God spoke
[1:44:39] more to Hagar during this period than he
[1:44:42] did to
[1:44:44] Abraham now that's the truth go look it
[1:44:46] up yeah right until eventually ishmail
[1:44:49] is 13 years old yes the next time we
[1:44:52] it's recorded that Abraham's God speaks
[1:44:54] with Abraham yeah but he spoke to Hagar
[1:44:57] he said because the Lord has heard thy
[1:44:59] Affliction he will be a wild man every
[1:45:01] man's hand against him he shall dwell in
[1:45:02] the presence of all his Brethren and she
[1:45:04] called the name of the Lord that spake
[1:45:05] unto her thou God seest me yeah do you
[1:45:09] believe he sees you
[1:45:11] today he sees you if he can see her he
[1:45:15] can see you yes now look and and she
[1:45:19] said for she said I have I also here
[1:45:21] looked after him that seeth me and she
[1:45:22] goes back and submits herself to Sarah
[1:45:24] it says Genesis 16:15 Hagar bear Abram a
[1:45:27] son Abram called his son's name which
[1:45:29] Hagar bear ishmail Abram was four scor
[1:45:31] and6 years old that's 86 when Hagar bear
[1:45:34] ishmail to Abraham to Abram and when
[1:45:36] Abram was 90 years old in nine the Lord
[1:45:39] appeared to
[1:45:40] Abraham and said unto him I am the
[1:45:43] almighty God walk before me and be thou
[1:45:46] perfect now here's a further Revelation
[1:45:47] what's he trying to show him he said I'm
[1:45:49] the almighty God I'm El should I look he
[1:45:52] had not spoke to him for 13 years he had
[1:45:55] to walk by faith even when God didn't
[1:45:57] speak all right yeah I'm going to skip
[1:46:00] down a couple I'm sorry there's some
[1:46:02] good things about that but let's just go
[1:46:04] on down yeah Abraham still loved ishmail
[1:46:10] yeah but a prophet's desire is not thus
[1:46:13] sayith the Lord yeah the word of the
[1:46:15] Lord is thus sayith the Lord right and
[1:46:18] Abraham said unto God all that Ishmael
[1:46:20] might live before thee and God said
[1:46:22] Sarah thy wife now here comes the
[1:46:25] Revelation it's going to come to him and
[1:46:27] then Sarah is going to have the secret
[1:46:29] of her Hearts revealed and she'll know
[1:46:30] that it's true yes what Abraham told her
[1:46:33] Hallelujah and God said Sarah thy wife
[1:46:36] this is the first time that Abraham
[1:46:38] knows this yeah Sarah thy wife shall
[1:46:41] bear thee a son indeed thou sh call his
[1:46:43] name Isaac and I will establish my
[1:46:44] Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[1:46:46] Covenant with his seed after him and as
[1:46:47] for ishmail I have heard thee behold I
[1:46:50] have bless him and will make him
[1:46:51] fruitful multiply him exceedingly 12
[1:46:53] princes shall he beg get I will make him
[1:46:55] a great nation but my Covenant will I
[1:46:57] establish with Isaac which Sarah shall
[1:46:59] bear unto thee at this set time in the
[1:47:00] next year God has not forsaken the
[1:47:03] church but this is the bride time are
[1:47:06] you with me now he is on the outside of
[1:47:09] the church knocking trying to get in to
[1:47:12] all to see an age that's kicked him out
[1:47:14] yeah he's not forsaken them come on but
[1:47:17] they won't let him in right but we've
[1:47:19] let him in yeah the book has been open
[1:47:22] we see
[1:47:23] we know what our part is to
[1:47:26] play fast forward to chapter 21 and you
[1:47:30] find that Isaac has been born he's being
[1:47:32] weaned and Sarah catches Hagar
[1:47:34] persecuting and mocking
[1:47:36] Isaac and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
[1:47:39] Egyptian which he had born unto Abraham
[1:47:42] mocking she saw ishmail and Hagar
[1:47:46] mocking Isaac wherefore she said unto
[1:47:49] Abraham cast out this Bond woman her son
[1:47:52] the son of this this Bond woman should
[1:47:53] not be air with my son even with Isaac
[1:47:56] the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's
[1:47:58] sight because of his son and God said to
[1:48:01] Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy
[1:48:02] sight because the lad because the Bond
[1:48:04] woman and all that Sarah has said unto
[1:48:05] thee hearkened to her voice for and
[1:48:07] Isaac shall thy seed be called and also
[1:48:10] of the son of the Bond woman will I make
[1:48:11] a
[1:48:12] nation this is
[1:48:14] powerful because he is thy seed yeah
[1:48:18] right so important hang with me for just
[1:48:20] a minute I preach about the same amount
[1:48:22] of time every Sunday and that's
[1:48:23] dangerous because if I go over
[1:48:25] everybody's waiting on
[1:48:29] lunch Abraham sends Hagar out in the
[1:48:32] desert that's his own son today he would
[1:48:36] be guilty of child
[1:48:39] abandonment he sends a baby or a young
[1:48:42] man rather at this time 13 years
[1:48:45] old and he sends he sends uh Hagar out
[1:48:50] in the wilderness into the desert
[1:48:57] alone into the desert they would almost
[1:48:59] certainly die but God said I'll make him
[1:49:03] a great nation all right I'll take care
[1:49:05] of him why because he's your seed yeah
[1:49:09] go to those next scriptures on there
[1:49:11] because he's your seed and she went she
[1:49:14] got down to her last drop of water yeah
[1:49:18] and she had no ability to make it one
[1:49:21] step further have you ever been been
[1:49:22] there yeah you get down to your last
[1:49:26] little bit of water with no ability to
[1:49:28] take it any further yeah and she went
[1:49:31] and set her down over against him a good
[1:49:33] way off as it were a bow shot for she
[1:49:36] said let me not see the death of the
[1:49:37] child and she set over against him and
[1:49:39] lifted up her voice and wept yeah oh
[1:49:43] church and God heard now it says she
[1:49:47] wept but God heard the voice of the lad
[1:49:51] because he said
[1:49:53] seed right and the angel of God Called
[1:49:56] to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her
[1:49:57] what ilth thee Hagar fear not for God ha
[1:50:01] heard the voice of the lad where he is
[1:50:05] he was not the promised seed he was not
[1:50:08] Abraham's Faith seed but he was
[1:50:10] Abraham's seed and God provided a way
[1:50:13] through tribulation you could say of him
[1:50:16] being
[1:50:17] saved look and God heard the voice of
[1:50:20] the lad arise lift up the lad hold him
[1:50:23] in thine hand I will make him a great
[1:50:25] nation and God opened her eyes she saw a
[1:50:27] well of water and she went and filled
[1:50:29] the bottle with water and gave the lad
[1:50:31] drink why because ishmail was Abraham's
[1:50:34] seed yes oh I hope you're hear me today
[1:50:38] listen if he was Abraham's seed just in
[1:50:40] the natural not even the promised seed
[1:50:42] how much more when we cry out to God are
[1:50:45] we be to be able to expect God to meet
[1:50:47] our
[1:50:48] needs yes Amen brother brand said I'm
[1:50:50] closing he said I know where there's
[1:50:52] another well that was put down on the
[1:50:53] day of Pentecost he said it's just as
[1:50:56] open tonight as it was the time when it
[1:50:58] was open back there when it was open for
[1:51:00] Hagar and the waters is just as fresh to
[1:51:02] every man or woman that wants to take
[1:51:04] the right road with God's word and walk
[1:51:06] with him you say I'm not sure if I'm Bri
[1:51:08] you just cry out to God and let God Open
[1:51:11] up The Well of water he said I'm not
[1:51:13] sure I can believe I'm not sure I can do
[1:51:15] it you just open up your cry out to God
[1:51:18] and let God open up that well am he'll
[1:51:21] still do it today yes amen he'll still
[1:51:24] do it do you believe it Church he'll
[1:51:26] still do it today if he would do it for
[1:51:28] the seed of a slightly doubted Pro
[1:51:30] musicians go ahead and come how much
[1:51:32] more would he give Waters of life to the
[1:51:34] fully believed seed of Promise how much
[1:51:37] more to those who really believe the
[1:51:39] word of God he give his
[1:51:42] promise now the book has been open we
[1:51:45] know Sarah's part the son of man has
[1:51:48] been
[1:51:50] revealed listen Jes Jesus in the
[1:51:53] scripture uses the analogy of an unjust
[1:51:55] judge you remember the story an unjust
[1:51:58] judge and a widow and he said the
[1:52:01] Widow was crying out for her inheritance
[1:52:04] she would have been given like a life
[1:52:06] estate just a an ability to live on the
[1:52:09] property she was crying out for that cuz
[1:52:11] people had taken it away from her and
[1:52:13] she kept coming back to the
[1:52:15] judge and the judge was an unjust judge
[1:52:18] he took bribes and everything else Our
[1:52:20] God's not like that but Jesus used an
[1:52:23] extreme example here comes a woman
[1:52:25] knocks on the door knocks on the door
[1:52:28] and Jesus said the judge the judge is
[1:52:30] not just and he doesn't care about her
[1:52:33] you don't fear God or regard man but
[1:52:36] because she knocks and and the Bible the
[1:52:38] King James used the word importunity
[1:52:40] because of her importunity it means she
[1:52:42] kept coming back she didn't she didn't
[1:52:44] quit she didn't give up she didn't walk
[1:52:46] out she just kept coming
[1:52:47] back knocking yes when she did God said
[1:52:52] the judge said okay let her have
[1:52:55] whatever she wants amen he said if the
[1:52:57] unjust judge would do that how much more
[1:53:00] will God do for those of his children
[1:53:02] who he loves so
[1:53:04] much amen and he ends that he said will
[1:53:07] we find faith will he find faith when he
[1:53:09] returns brother Brandon picks that up
[1:53:11] and says will Malachi 4 be revealed
[1:53:14] Revelation 10 1-7 well Luke 1730 I
[1:53:17] believe there's a bride today we are not
[1:53:19] a widow we are a bride and we're not
[1:53:20] coming to an unjust judge we're walking
[1:53:23] before the one who knows our hearts he
[1:53:25] knows all about us knock on that door
[1:53:27] cry out to him in the desert and there
[1:53:29] will be a well of water would you stand
[1:53:31] with me this
[1:53:32] morning oh I I believe that Well's here
[1:53:35] this morning I don't believe we have to
[1:53:36] wait on the meetings to have that well
[1:53:38] of water I believe it's here this
[1:53:39] morning he's the same yesterday today
[1:53:43] and
[1:53:44] forever if he would do that for a widow
[1:53:49] what about his wife
[1:53:52] if he would do that for Hagar what about
[1:53:56] me what about
[1:53:59] you you get thinking well I'm not good
[1:54:01] enough Hagar wasn't good enough but
[1:54:04] there was she was found in the desert
[1:54:06] and she cried out to God and God heard
[1:54:08] the voice of the seed even though it
[1:54:12] wasn't Isaac I say God will hear your
[1:54:14] voice
[1:54:15] today give you water from the rock the
[1:54:19] driest thing in the desert driest place
[1:54:21] you've ever been in
[1:54:23] but he'll still fill your life if you
[1:54:25] let him would you bow your heads with me
[1:54:32] today my heart hurts many
[1:54:39] times I don't want to preach
[1:54:42] legalism yet I have to tell the
[1:54:46] truth we want to do the right
[1:54:49] things go the right way
[1:54:52] my heart hurts for people because many
[1:54:54] times the only reason why people are
[1:54:57] making the mistakes they make they just
[1:54:59] haven't realized who they are in the
[1:55:02] word that's just never been revealed to
[1:55:05] them and if you could just ever really
[1:55:07] get a revelation of that I know who I
[1:55:11] am nothing can move me from what I am
[1:55:16] and who I am that's what we want church
[1:55:19] if you cry out to him today
[1:55:23] if you cry out to him you've got that
[1:55:24] Revelation in your heart even a glimpse
[1:55:27] of it brother so what we have here is a
[1:55:29] shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a
[1:55:31] shadow of the love of
[1:55:34] God what will it be like when we see the
[1:55:37] full
[1:55:38] thing the whole
[1:55:42] thing I believe it will happen one
[1:55:45] day maybe you've made mistakes in your
[1:55:47] life but you say right now God I I
[1:55:49] believe you'll Hear My
[1:55:50] Cry maybe you
[1:55:53] maybe you haven't had the right attitude
[1:55:54] towards the word but today Lord that's
[1:55:56] going to change right now Lord right now
[1:56:00] I'm I believe that I'm going to be I'm
[1:56:02] going to be well my family is going to
[1:56:04] be
[1:56:05] healed things are going to be
[1:56:08] right maybe you've taken God's
[1:56:10] permissive will but today Lord I want to
[1:56:13] follow your perfect
[1:56:14] will I want to go forward I'm going to
[1:56:17] let those things that are in the past be
[1:56:19] in the past and let God move in my
[1:56:23] life would you just do that this morning
[1:56:26] I don't know your situation but God
[1:56:28] knows and if you'll cry out to him
[1:56:30] there's a well that'll open up and you
[1:56:33] can be saved you can be healed you can
[1:56:35] have water if you're dry spiritually
[1:56:37] today there's a well here for you
