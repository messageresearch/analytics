or sick or in need lord i i pray that you'd help them strengthen them lord heal them or those that weren't able to come tonight and are sick and body i pray you bless them lord i pray you'd heal them lord and for all of these things will give you the glory and the honor and the praise believing it was you that did it in jesus name amen amen we love the lord tonight amen isn't he a good god amen romans chapter five we'll go to romans chapter five and verse one romans chapter 5 and verse 1 it feels good to be in church tonight it's hot outside but the spirit of the lord is here and it's nice and cool and we have a good building to be thankful for and we have a congregation to be thankful for i step up there sometimes and i have to think uh i'm grateful that i get to preach to you and i have to sit in there and i think lord i i don't deserve that but there must be a reason that god has allowed me to speak to you and so i pray the word would just speak to your heart tonight in a special way i think of all these what a responsibility that we have all these children the ones that sang so wonderfully tonight and young ladies growing up in a world that just wants to tear them apart and and just a broken world but yet we see them growing up and the fear and admission of the lord and their parents doing a good job and we're so thankful for that and pray that would continue and as they grow older you just think what a youth group you know one of these days and god don't do things overnight it's not a microwave it's enough and it takes a while to to get things done but we believe that our god is building something and if we go home tomorrow that'll be good but if he tarries for 20 years that'll be good too because there's good things coming amen you believe that if we don't believe that we might as well just give up we're not going to give up we are not of those who go back paul says i feel like encouraging you tonight i i better get to my sermon i'm we're not of those who go back we're those who believe amen how many believers do we have here tonight amen romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but we glory in tribulations also and i want you to notice that word tribulations we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and that word experience in the original is final proof final proof i like that and experience hope or expectation and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us i pray the lord with his blessing to the word you may be seated i'd like to speak to you tonight on the bride's tribulation the bride's tribulation and i know that let me get this out of the way at the beginning i know that all of you that are here and that are tuning in you if you've thought of the same thing well the bride don't go through tribulation you know well but the bible don't actually say that the bride don't go through the great yes right they don't go through when brother branham says the bride doesn't go through tribulation he's talking about the great tribulation the bride does have tribulations right and there is a difference and i want to talk to you about that tonight but the bride does not go through the great tribulation you say brother ben that the bride don't have go through great tribulation that's true and i thank god for that that we're called to escape that aren't you glad that you're called to escape that hour i don't want to go through it i don't want my kids to go through it i don't want the church to go through it i don't want anything to do with the events of the great tribulation want nothing to do with that and yet there is tribulation and i'm not talking necessarily about anything special to us because it's been going on since the very beginning of the church there is tribulation that comes to the believer and yet we don't experience that great tribulation and and we find it that that's shown in the parable of the ten virgins i don't have time to go into it tonight but the five that uh that that uh do not go in with with the groom when when he calls for them at the midnight cry the five that do not go in must be purged because they lack the oil to keep their lamps burning while they went to buy the bridegroom came and so they they were cast into outer darkness they could not see their day or their hour their lamps were not burning but ours are burning today our lamps are not dim they're not put out but we have the message of the hour and we have the holy spirit to anoint that word that we're ready when he comes aren't you glad for that tonight so i agree with you the bride does not go through the event known as the great tribulation but we do have tribulation in this life and that's why paul tells us in romans 5 and 3 not only so but we glory in tribulations also now he's not just talking about a future people a church that'll come and and the bride's going to get off scot-free no the bride all through history has had tribulations knowing that tribulation worketh patience so he says this tribulation that we have we glory in it because it does something for us it gives us patience oh my and patience gives us experience which is final proof of what we're talking about so without the tribulation we could never be really sure who we are so that's why the bible says be thankful for your tribulation be thankful for the trials that you go through count it all joy he says he said it's more precious to you than gold and we look at that how could that possibly be because it's by the tribulation the experience of going through tribulation and coming out a believer oh god what tells us that job was who he said he was god even told satan and satan didn't even believe god you think satan's going to believe believe you you tell him well i'm a believer god told job that god job was a believer god told satan that job was a believer and he still didn't believe him but when he went through it and he said i came naked into the world i'll go naked out of it bless he said i i didn't receive anything from god but it was just a blessing to me he said i will not curse god oh aren't you glad you can be like that tonight i will not curse god though he slays me i'll trust him and that brought proof to us and that's the simple meaning of that and we'll go we're going to go much deeper into it tonight but the simple meaning is the tribulation in life produces the experience of having passed through the tribulation and i'm still standing i came to the fire i was not burned i didn't smell like smoke i come out of it on the other side of believer i went in a believer i come out a believer i came to the cancer i came through the high blood pressure i came through the split in the church i came through false teaching i came through everything else and i'm still a believer i still am one of god's i still stand for god i came through all these things and i i come through great tribulations in my own life not the great tribulation but great tribulation amen and i'm still a believer so experienced brings expectation if he did it for me once he'll do it for me again do you believe that tonight amen and so god allows you to go through these things for your own good for my own good so there's two related greek words in the new testament for tribulation and it's the level which is to crush or oppress to compress it's the idea of a crowd pressing together when related to the concept of suffering it refers to oppression or to affliction and it it functions in a metaphorical sense to denote being hard-pressed distressed harassed or troubled and then the next word is delipsis it's a very similar word from the same root word which means treble tribulation oppression trouble or affliction that causes pressure causes pressure when you say tribulation you could say pressure there's coming a time of a great pressure on the earth but even now there's pressure right just not to that extent but there's pressure now pressure and it's the idea of being hard-pressed to being distressed it denotes tribulation unique to the period prior to judgment so the same word is used same word paul uses here it's the same word it just uses the modifier great tribulation there's coming a time when there will be a tribulation we're going to miss right he won't tempt you more than you're able he won't put his bride through that time i'm so thankful that he cares for us and he loves us but yet so we'll miss that time but we do have tribulations and all they do is just prove to us who we are so now the term can also describe troubles in everyday life jesus uses the word in matthew 13. matthew 13 and 20 he speaks of the different types of ground that the seed fell in the word fell in he said he that receiveth the seed into stony places and what that means is as i've studied on that before is it's not so much rocks that you see but it's a thin a film of dirt if you could say it like that about an inch of dirt that looks good but when you throw the seed on it it can only go down a little ways and it hits the rock so he he throws the seed down and it and it it takes a little bit of root but only only so far because the rock's there so it can't go deep yeah right and he said the same is he that heareth the word and with joy receiveth it yet hath he not root in himself see that's where your root has to be if you're going to make it through tribulation there's got to be a root and i'm talking again just so you don't don't think i'm preaching false doctrine not talking about the great tribulation i'm talking about what you went through today what you'll go through tomorrow what you'll go through next week you go through tribulation right if you've been a christian very long you know what i'm talking about you go through tribulation you feel like you're surrounded by trouble surrounded by trials every one of us have been there and he said but this the seed this this word that was cast into the earth the earth it wasn't good earth and so it had a rock under it and so it could not take root but it lasted a little while but when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended you'll see them come to church for a while until they start saying did you know you go to a cult you look better if you start to cut that hair right that's what happens he after a while he's offended that's why you see him come for a while but there's nothing but thank god there's something in us he prepared good soil there's a seed inside of it something that can take root that can go down and and won't be affected by tribulation right it's the idea of being in a crowd of enemies you ever felt like you were in a crowd of enemies yeah surrounded by difficulties afflicted on every side here's another word you could use for it and you'll see where i'm going after a little bit squeezed yeah sure yes sir squeeze that's what the word is squeezed surrounded compressed squeezed by trouble squeezed by persecution oh you better have root in this hour you better have root you better know what you believe you better have the holy ghost because if you don't you'll pretty soon you're going to be offended that's it's tribulation is to be squeezed you know but that's nothing new righteous men have always stood in a crowd of enemies that's nothing new in hebrews 11 37 it speaks of the heb the heroes of faith it says they were stoned they were sown asunder we're tempted we're slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins destitute afflicted tormented that word afflicted is the same word tribulation they went through tribulation they had tribulations they were afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and we look at what they went through and we wonder will we escape the pressing now think about it will we escape the pressing yes we escape the great tribulation but are we going to escape what every hero of faith went through i say we won't but there's pressure unique to our hour and so when i'm talking about the bride's tribulation i'm talking about that unique pressure are you with me tonight that comes in our hour to try to make you disbelieve the word to try to take away the effect of the word out of your life that unique pressure that comes to you but it's the pressure itself that reveals to you who you are because you made it some of you were alive in 1977 when the word become a pressure to you because you said well i believe everything a prophet taught and then you looked at that and you didn't catch maybe or maybe you did but some didn't catch that he that he said that it was a prediction and and that he was just uh he couldn't see beyond 1977. some people didn't catch that yeah and so they went back there and and they said well i believe what the prophet said and it will become a persecution it become a pressure but some of you made it through that and after a while you begin to say i really do believe the message you know it would have been easy to walk away some of you lost spouses i know what i'm talking about tonight talk to some of the older people some of you some of you i lost churches lost family members i'm not i'm talking about people that left because of the word some of you lost a lot of friends some of you have been through some things you you had a pressure but what happened in the end when you come out of it brother david you come out the other side and you say hey i wouldn't have made it through that if i wasn't a seed of god if there wasn't some roots for the paul i would not have made it through what i made it through oh i survived difficulty in marriage i've survived difficulty at my job i've survived difficulty in the church i've survived difficulty in preaching come on you all can make that that tonight that same declaration i know who i am i'm not saying that out of arrogance i'm saying it because i went through the pressure and i come out the other side and the pressure revealed what metal was on the inside it wasn't dross it wasn't just fool's gold but it was real gold the pressure revealed that yes amen the tribulation worked patience amen the patient's experience and the experience expectation and so we say well we we won't have to put up with that not our age we're predestined well they were too they were too they still had the pressing to go and the scripture says this in hebrews 12 and 1 right after that heroes of faith chapter says wherefore seeing we also we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses all that are telling us i made it by the grace of god i made it i was one of those ones who lived in the dens and the caves of the earth but i made it i think about brother branham said that there was some that come to the nicean council he said them prophets come out of the wilderness with sheepskin and goat skin on them he said they come out of the wilderness and they threw him out of the nicene council but they come there and stood against that thing they were persecuted and run out of the church and everything else but they believed and they they'll see them one day and that's that great cloud of witnesses that says i was there i know what pressure's like right i know what it's like to be in the ox age i know what it's like to be in a man the mind age i know what it's like to have pressure but i stood anyway and i know i couldn't have done that by myself so it produced a an experience and produced a faith in my life that i am who i said i am it's one thing to say it is another thing to look back and say hey yeah that's me hallelujah and so he says we're surrounded by this great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight so he said if we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let's do like they did let's get ready for the race let's let's get ready for the pressure of the race let's let's get ready for that event he said the sin which just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us how will we have patience to run right yeah well he's already told you by tribulations your brother ben i don't like that no one ever has if you go to do something for god the devil's going to stand up and and oppose you a hundred times out of a hundred everything you do i've noticed this in mitch doing missions work that we've done the little bit that i've done overseas i've noticed every time there's opposition not half the time every time there's extreme opposition but it's like during that opposition you'll get little handfuls of of bright spots that you can look at and say hey he wants me to go that's the way your life is isn't it you get little handfuls little bright spots or maybe a sermon on a wednesday night or a song someone sings or a tape that you listen to or something will happen and somebody will say something to you this little bright spot that said hey you're gonna make it it's gonna be okay even though you're the darkest part of your life but it's just working patience it's working patience tribulation produces patience it does not tribulation does not produce patience and though in the non-elect right it doesn't produce patience the great tribulation will not produce patience because there won't be any elect there to receive it but our tribulation produces patience the bible says during the tribulation period that they'll call for the stones and the rocks to fall on them and i say hide us from the wrath of the lamb it also says that they they will curse god and say that they and refuse to repent even though they know god's doing it tribulation produces patience but not in the non-elect jesus taught his disciples they would have tribulation in john chapter 16 and verse 33 he said these things have spoken unto you in me you might have peace in the world i love how he says that in me you might have peace so many times we don't have peace because we're looking at the wrong things but he said in me you might have peace in the world you shall have tribulation it's the same word tribulation pressure but be of good cheer i have overcome the world he was under the greatest pressure you talk about tribulation he stood under the greatest pressure that had ever been there at golgotha he knew what he was talking about when he was there on the mount of olives he knew at gethsemane what he was talking about but he said i have overcome the world be of good cheer i have overcome the world amen and even he had to learn by the things he suffered what was it patience with god if it be so let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done yes amen now the apostles taught this as well i just want to show you there's nothing new before we move on the apostles taught this in acts chapter 14 and verse 21 that when they had preached the gospel to that city and the top many they returned again to lystra to iconium and antioch confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith that's what i'm doing tonight exhorting you to continue in the faith that we must go through listen what they were telling them they weren't sitting there patting them on the back and saying oh my you guys are so wonderful and we're just gonna make it so easy for you they said no they said listen you're going to have tribulation you're new believers but one day you're going to look back and realize there was much tribulation he said you're going to have to go through much tribulation we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god that's the only way in there's one door into the kingdom of god and the only way into it is through much tribulation so if that's the only way in amen let me go ahead oh my let me take that city let me go into the door if that's where the door is and there's much tribulation let me go through the door but remember it's pressure and the story i believe it's pilgrim's progress that that told the story about the lion that was there at the gate but it was chained and timid and fearful ran away but christian realized that the lion could only go so far he could not come to the middle of the road oh my the lion cannot come to the middle of the road stay in the middle of the road with god and the lion can't get you but it'll sure enough pressure you it'll scare you it'll roar at you but it can't take you oh my that's the door i want to find we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god paul taught it to his people first thessalonians 3 and 1. he said wherefore when we could no longer forebear we thought it good to be left at athens alone and timotheus our brother and minister of god our fellow laborer in the gospel of christ to establish you notice he didn't just send his letters to establish the people but he sent his fellow laborer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should be moved by these tribulations it's the same word afflictions tribulations for yourselves know that we are appointed there unto we weren't kidding when we told you that the way to the kingdom was by much tribulation but aren't you glad you went anyway aren't you glad you're where you're at you know there will still be tribulation as long as you're on the earth but i think some of us older people could look at these young people and say hey you're going to go through much tribulation but you'll be much better off if you'll stay in the middle of the road if you'll stay where i'm at amen because i can look at my own life and i can see that i'm much better off than i would have been had i cut cut and run if i'd just run away i would have been in much worse shape but today i'm living for jesus and i'm nearing the kingdom amen and you can say if you'll do if you'll act like that i didn't do everything perfect but i stayed with the word and when i stayed with the word he backed me up right hallelujah i don't think it's strange when there's tribulation i remember i've told you this before but i remember when we we left west plains and we went to gibson and we were there for 10 years because i felt like i needed that seasoning and while we were there when we first got there an older gentleman told me he said it's kind of a brother's passed away now he's he's a good brother wonderful brother but he just had kind of a way about him kind of uh curmudgeon and uh he told me i said well he said how things have been going i said well it's been difficult we had trouble getting rid of our home and we moved and cut our income was cut in half and we had to we had to suffer during that time we lived in an apartment for a while but we wanted to be there i felt like that's what god told me to do and it was nothing against the church that i was in but it was just a i felt it was a necessity and this proved out to be true but but you know it was we wouldn't be where we're at today without it but the man told me he said well he said if the lord was was in it he said it'd be easy hey man i want to say man you're 80 years old you should know better than that if the lord was in it it'd be easy no i i don't think so many times what the lord's in it's harder what do you what did he tell uh what did he tell paul or brother branham he said because you've chosen the harder way amen you've chosen the more difficult path and the more difficult path is always to stay with the word right yes amen so now he says he says i want you to know that we're appointed to these afflictions these tribulations for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass yes and you know so now you begin to experience it hold on yeah sent timothy down there to tell him hold on it's all right to preach an encouraging message every now and then you're going to make it yeah why because there's something in you you're made of the stuff that don't bluff you're made of something that can make it yes hold on timothy told the people you're going to suffer tribulation and we told you that and it happened but keep holding on god's going to bless you and the writer isaac watched years ago wrote the song brother branham quote said over and over and over again in the message he said am i a soldier of the cross the follower of the lamb and shall i fear to own his cause or blessed to speak his name must not be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others fought to win the price and sailed through bloody seas wouldn't that look odd if we made it with no pressure and they went through what they went through and we just sailed in and said well thank you all we made you made it easy for us you realize it's going to be the other way around they without us could not be made perfect so the greatest pressure the greatest darkness is at the end time but it's in a different form than what people perceive it to be in so the bride's tribulation that goes on around her is in a different form than the worlds is and so people don't perceive it to be pressure and they're deceived but there's a great pressure in this hour mustabi carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas there are no foes for me to face must i not stem the flood is this vile world a friend has it suddenly become a friend i say no is this vow a world a friend to grace to help me unto god sure i must fight if i would reign increase my courage lord

but he will not be able to amen he said in this hour the elect would he said if it were possible oh i love that if it were possible the elect would be deceived but it is not possible amen brother branham quoted that song when he talked about peter cartwright and the bully you remember the story how that the bully come in there he was in there washing windows am i going to make it without washing windows ever with a joel in the church probably not there was a minister a great great evangelist washing windows he was there washing the windows getting ready for the service and and i said that to brother joel because that sometimes what you end up doing especially overseas you just don't have all that help and so you end up doing that and and that's what he was doing and here come the bully of the town in he'd heard he was there he said if you're going to preach you've got to get by me first brother brandon said peter cartwright put down his towel rolled up his sleeves and said okay he said you got to go through me first okay he said lord increase my courage lord if i'm gonna reign i gotta fight increase my courage lord he said quoted that song and he said he went to beating on that man he said until he until he beat him under submission i'm not telling you to do that naturally tonight but you got some things there's some thoughts you need to beat under submission tonight

going to fight till my family can be saved i'm going to fight until for my healing i'm going to fight for my salvation lord if i must fight let me fight right brother brother said the bully got saved

said you know my conscience tells me brother branham that i well you might as well cut that thing away yeah all right the devil can come to you and try to tell you well you're not a seed of god it's

you with me tonight yes oh my get your next job done i'm going to win i can't lose i'm going to win we don't baby people to get them in church or to keep them in church brandon taught us that there's much more to this quote but i'm just going to read you parts of it because i got somewhere else i want to go tonight but he said could you imagine genuine christians being that being baby to get in church he said they were rugged they were burly could you imagine saint paul being that type of a christian could you imagine saint peter now he's if you don't make me general overseer well i don't know i might go join so-and-so they were rugged men they were men of faith they lived with god they walked with god they were men a few words i think you know what i think that means i think it means they didn't complain all the time the bible said there meant a few words they served god day and night constantly oh god you didn't have to spray them and baby them and offer them this side or the other they were men rugged they were genuine seeds not hybrid and denominations they he went on to say that you don't keep them sprayed with titles and and jobs and things like that if you go back if you remember back in the 90s there was a purpose-driven church and all the things that have come out i've got something to say maybe about that later but ever give everybody a job make them happy give them something to do send them overseas and the founder of that just bragged the other day he said i i trained a 1.1 million preachers where are they why isn't the world a better place well you just give them titles paddled them on the back and said go preach the gospel until finally he started patting women on the back telling them to preach the gospel completely outside the word but brother branham and then quotes isaac watts again and he says this must not be patted on the back and this side and the other babies i expect my place out yonder with the rugged i expect not to come up there with no trophy scars at all i don't mean you're stupid right a lot of would be heroes are dead today because they were just stupid they don't mean you you're stupid you don't just take abuse but when you have to fight you fight are you with me now i don't expect to go with those scars i'm not stupid i'm not going to stand up and let them shoot at me but i'm sure going to shoot back i'm going to get behind something get behind the word be with me now and i'm sure enough's going to fire back not at the people but at the devil see i expect not to come up there with no trophy scars at all i must fight if i must train increase my courage lord see let me stand like a christian not to be a hybrid plant have to be babied and painted brought into something you're not brought in anyhow christianity you're born in it you become a new creature you're a seed of god that comes into the earth you weren't born of corruptible seed as the bible says but incorruptible you can't lose you might as well fight why would you refuse to fight a fight that you can't lose now look there is a a squeeze a pressure a tribulation for the bride right i think we've established that and and so each age if you go through each age you'll find they have their own sorts of pressures and i believe there's things peculiar to this age because we have an eagle anointing to be able to overcome our earth is not an ox age or a lion age ours is not a man age wisdom of man but it's an eagle age right where we fly over these things there's tribulation now again i do believe in a squeeze but i think people have a mistaken concept of what that is yes because there's all kinds of tribulations but now again tribulation is what works patience experience hope expectation and that makes us unashamed when he comes because our expectation will be met when we see him in the flesh if we endure the trial we possess the gate of the enemy after the trial how many heard that sermon yes brother branham preached that we possess the gate of the enemy after trial why because he preached that took it from abraham it was after the trial he went down amen to after a lot you remember and fought the kings he had to fight and when he got done he met melchizedek oh my after the trial so there's a trial for every age there's a squeeze the bible tells us in the raptured psalm and i won't read all of it to save time tonight i'll just read this one verse verse three he said though a host should encamp against me though a host shouldn't camp against me that's pressure at the rapture think about it pressure at the rapture though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will i be confident i'm hidden away in the secret of the coming you understand in the in the mystery of going he says now this is the rapture condition let's go to revelation chapter 9. you remember that there were some trumpets that sounded and brother branham doesn't tell us what each one of the trumpets are he doesn't preach the trumpets you remember because he said he preached the feast of the trumpets because he said that wasn't for us for the jews but he did tie in to the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal and ties into the sixth and seventh trumpet the sixth and seventh seal and he talks about how all the trumpets blow under the sixth seal but then he says that in the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal has something in common and and it's just revelation 13 he said the six angels sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel that's the sixth trumpeting angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year to say the third part of men and the number of the army the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them now i'm gonna skim through it brother branham taught us about this scripture because it's very long if you go and listen to it in the feast of the trumpets it's where it's located but i want to and you can read or listen to the entire thing when you get home but i want to dwell on just statements that brother branham made during this teaching and he taught us that these were turned loose again under the sixth trumpet he said there wasn't natural horses it was spiritual horses spiritual devils chargers found in the river euphrates he talked about the old roman empire being revived under fascism yeah you've heard him talk about it if you haven't you go back and listen to that tape again and because brother branham says a lot in the in feast of the trumpets he said and notice what happens under that sixth trumpet we're turned loose on the juice the persecution of the jews supernatural devils now again if you try to make the seals line up and i'm getting into doctrine here so just bear with me for a moment but if you try to make the seals line up like the church agents say well one two three four five six seven and then so the seventh one would be the third coming of christ and that has to be on the other side of the rapture we've got to go up in the forest seal and and there's truths to all of that but think about it if you try to line them up like that how are the jews under hitler nightman killed under the sixth trumpet when all the trumpets sound into the sixth seal i think about it that some of y'all think about that and chew on it for a while but that that's it did that's what he taught us so it's evidently there's things that are released under that trumpet it's almost like a preview of what's going to happen but there's also a preview for the bride what's going to happen during the tribulation to the church under those trumpets now look and and so there's something that's turned loose on the spiritual side and on the natural side but the brown said they turn loose on the jews the persecution of the jews supernatural devils nearly 2 000 years loosed by stalin hitler upon the jews that's been many years ago now he said you say well that isn't roman it's the same spirit they've done the same things they did to the christians in the old pagan roman days watch the natural israel in the spiritual spiritual church now he said as we separate it here i love that and so he talks about the fifth seal souls under the altar he talks about uh and you'll have to watch because in this sermon brother brown talks about the fifth seal then he calls it the sixth seal talks about the sixth trumpet calls it seventh trump but he goes back and forth but that's not what was important what was important is what happened right it's not necessarily the number we get caught up on numbers and names and that's not what's important what's important is what happens manifestation not theology are you with me yeah manifestation enough y'all what did god do that's important in your life too what did god do not not what did you figure out but what did he do in your life it's more important and and so then you'll find it matches with the word if it's a true conversion now he talked again about the roman empire how it was identified uh there were under pagan principles he said which still exists today the holidays and things that they did he said and they were loosed upon the jew who knew nothing of the spirit he said there's your mysteries that's hid under that seal there he said these trumpets are let loose on the jews he said don't you see not on the gentiles he said the gentiles when them seals was open is sealed away time has ended the church is called now watch he talks about the preview of the bride the sudden secret going away the seven visions in 1933 and i want you to understand that we're talking about when the finality of the seventh seal is realized that's when we go home it's a mystery of going so there's a part of that that we don't know and that's what day day and time he's coming we don't know that and so that that it doesn't get wrapped up so you could say that he doesn't take the book in that sense until we go home so there's there's two sides of it god always does things in uh in a spiritual way and then he does it in a real way in a reality way you understand and so he does it like he takes the book but then later he takes us we're still looking for that right and that's why we don't get off on a doctor and we say well the rapture's over because the seals have been revealed right there's still mercy you believe that tonight now stay with me you kids i'm talking about supernatural devils go read revelation chapter 9 and and look at this you'll ask your parents about it that's that's the thing to do is go read about these and ask your parents about what all that means because it's supernatural devils that look like look like horses right and they ha but they have certain other animal or beast elements to them now brother branham talked about these he said they they were dictators he said remember hitler or not when we're dictators i'm going somewhere tonight just hang with me dictators had power as kings and their king was from the bottomless pit brother branham talked about how that they'd done everything they could do they cremated their bodies and everything hung on fences children and all innocent people because they were jews they were done that way but god said to give each one of them a robe remember that's under that fifth seal undeserving as it was but his grace to blind them so that we could see and so he now he says here he said the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know and you'll have people challenge you on that well how do you believe the book is open the seven steel hasn't opened well we're not gone right we're not gone that's it's coming there's a part of it we don't know the day and hour he's coming to me it's simple but people will get all confused about this because they want something else to happen before we go home but we're not promised anything else but the actual rapture of the church and the change of our bodies now he said that's his coming he said so while they're still under there but he shows us here in a preview now watch he said notice we find now that the natural power and of the natural to a natural nation israel was loosed there what what did it it went and made war and how it murdered and persecuted he said now now think about this here was in 1940 1938 through 1945 the second world war those 200 million demons were released in a natural way right that's what brother branham taught and he said now this is in 1963. i believe was 1963 or 1964. about it here at the end but he said now he said he said it's now it's loosed he said now the ecclesiastical realm has been opened has been opened he said now and from the natural revival the old pagan realm went forth on those jews which was always been their enemy and it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world because the religious system was still holding now it's been loosed go back and listen to it brother branham ties it to the pope visiting rome in total darkness the eclipse coming what do you realize what age we live in you said there's no pressure think about it it's tribulation but not the great tribulation but all that are live godly in christ jesus are going to suffer persecution tribulation you're all you're always going to suffer and this is what we're called to in this hour now it's an ecclesiastical realm he said it has been opened he said it was turned loose in the same spirit by the dictators of the world he said the religious system was still holding now it's being loosed now it's been loosed he said what has it done in cunningness he said he'd come in like flatteries and what has he done what has he done he is bringing the protestant ecumenical council of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them you realize what a sea change there was in the 60s now think about it god was doing something on one side he's saying there'll be no more delay here we see a mighty angel come down with an open book right here the pope visits rome all this is going on during that same time frame if you look at culture since the 60s what's happened the world's gone insane why the demons have been loosed oh god they were loosed in the natural but they've been loosed in the spiritual in the ecclesiastical church he said now he said he's bringing the protestant economical council what the word ecumenical that's we're all the same let's just all get along he said of the world churches the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter just like they did the other so there's going to be some in the end that will result in the slaughter of the church right during the tribulation he said just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride he said how loose in the ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon what not upon the denominations upon the bride you think there's not pressure but there's something different about this age because every other age when there came this amount of pressure only one escaped that was jesus christ only one man didn't fall are you with me now but there was a bridegroom who didn't fall so there had to be a pride who didn't fall i noticed a lot for a wednesday night but a bridegroom didn't fall so there had to be a bride that didn't fall and so now there's coming a pressure on the bride it's not coming against the denominations it's coming against the bride that's what he said but he said here you'll get it oh god the bride will not go through that time what there's a slaughter coming but the bride will not go through that time when the antichrist becomes incarnate when these things that we see in a preview now these plagues begin to fall on the earth the bride oh god aren't you glad for god that has rescued you from great tribulation the church will but not the bride he said you say the church has to go through persecution for the perfection of it the blood of jesus christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife listen we do not go through trials do not look at your trials as perfection you're already perfect he's not making you perfect you can't be any more perfect but what's he doing with the trial giving you experience giving you patience making you realize who you are he already knows who you are but he's making you realize who you are so he allows the pressure to come to bring experience and to bring hope to bring expectation and to bring finally love the love of god shall have brought in your heart by the holy ghost amen he said a man who chooses his wife don't put her through a lot of punishment amen he's already found grace with her she has found grace with him he engages to her and if there's anything he'll keep her from every place to turn her hand his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so it is on the bride so is it on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it and in the hour when i see all the churches they're great glamour and rich and have need of nothing they say and see the miserable wretched blind then patting you on the shoulders now watch this pressure coming on i i really believe we will not see the pressure in a form of persecution physical persecution i believe we go home before that happens now there may be some individuals when i say we there will be individuals who are persecuted we understand that we're fixing to go to a country that you can't build churches in or some countries where it's illegal to be a christian that's pressure right there are there are cases where people are under pressure but the main pressure of the age you understand the main pressure of the age is not physical persecution but it's spiritual persecution now watch he said patting you on the shoulders i want you to compromise with them i hope you can see it tonight see that's the bride's tribulation but he said i was born for a purpose that's to condemn that thing and to call out this i do amen he said notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit now 20 years later it had been 20 years almost since that loosing of those 200 million demons and hitler and eightman and stalin under those dictators oh my those ones with power is kings he said but after that war he said now 20 years later after that war we see the loosening of the ecclesiastical spirit what under the seventh seal the seventh trumpet to the jew he said look at the moon darkening out we're under where under the moon darkened out see it drawn out the son of man being drove from the church what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical bunch the economical move oh church if we just recognize that's what the lord laid on my heart yes you'll suffer persecution don't think you'll escape but there'll be natural hardships in your life but look at this spiritual hardship that's on the age that's what satan wants to do to you he wants to make you cold he wants to make you pull back he wants to make you say it's all the same it doesn't matter anyway it doesn't matter what a prophet said it doesn't matter what the pastor says it doesn't matter just just we'll just do what we want that's what he wants you to do oh god he don't care if you still call yourself a believer he just wants you to melt back into that ecumenical move to drift back into that place where you're comfortable but the bride's under pressure what kind of pressure is it now you'll be honest with me what's the pressure that you face every day what kind of pressure are they coming into your house searching your home for message books and throwing them away might be somebody doing that again there might be an individual going through that but as a whole what do we see we got all the books we want i got every message book on every device i own i got the prophet's voice on everything we're going to preach in a nation where they don't have it at all in their language none we've had to translate a couple of books so we can hand something out and and there's nothing but now here comes and it's not just that nation but the whole arabic speaking world but now look at this look what's happening i've got it right here what pressure am i under not to throw it away not to somebody take it from me i think it would be more dear to us if someone tried to take it from us yes i've seen them in africa take books and tear them apart i've seen it and take one page and read that one page there's a brother here who's here because the testimony in the message because the testimony of an african believer well some of those brothers really believe it they may not have shoes on their feet but they really believe it well paul understands that different ones of you understand that if you've been there and you know it they really believe it they're under a different kind of pressure in many places in the world what pressure are we under and i think it's getting this way everywhere not just here it's getting this way everywhere what pressure we under just to not read it it doesn't matter anymore the message doesn't matter men have given their lives literally to see the message get to the world and we have it all of it yeah and i'll when i have to study or when i have when someone challenges me on something i'll go look it up otherwise i'll leave it i don't say that y'all do that i know you're good people i know you study but that's the temptation same thing with the scripture places where they don't have the scripture the way we do in china they take everything out that doesn't fit with communism they don't have much of a scripture and so we have to smuggle in king james version bibles translated into chinese into china because they persecute them holding the scripture but we have it i've got four or five different bible labs what is the pressure on me an ecclesiastical spirit yes sure hear me now it doesn't matter oh god that's been loosed on this age that's been here now for 50 years more than 50 years he said notice the loosing of this ecclesiastical spirit look at the moon darkening out he said what is it joining in with the ecclesiastical budget economical move with the world council of churches has drove every man what does that thing stand for he said why you have to surrender all your evangelical teachings and things how can two walk together unless they be agreed they can't jesus said they can't how can a church watch a prophet foretelling what's happening right now he said the methodist and baptist walk together how can the church of christ walk with the presbyterians how can the catholic walk with the protestant how can protestant walk with protestant the biggest denomination in the world just had a convention biggest protestant denomination southern baptist convention just had a convention where they have to decide whether or not they're going to allow women preachers they've always stood against that and they brought it before an executive committee you know what they did they said let's do a year-long study on the meaning of the word pastor because we really don't know what a pastor is aren't you glad to be in the message of the hour that's that ecumenical move they don't dare stand against it because the biggest church in the ecumenical convention or in that southern baptist convention is saddleback church rick warren who stood up in the convention and said we should not be fighting over secondary issues like women preachers because he started just a few months ago ordaining women preachers in a church protestant can't walk with protestants but the bride oh my can't walk with the word how many believe that today i'm closing in just a moment he said which is christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word you have to agree with the word to walk with the word notice there she is he said now she's loosed to do what loose to call all these little loose ends oh well don't make any difference anyhow that's what satan said to eve don't make any difference it's all right surely god is a good god he loves us all he doesn't that's a strong statement i mean you don't love your sin or mine you hear so much about it being a good god he is a good god but being good he has to be just remember his love is elective love he has to be justified there's no goodness without justice there's no justice without no law without punishment penalty lord in that hour that we're living yes oh my later on that same message he said at the same time he said now as soon as this church the bride is drawn together she has taken up she's drawn together we've went through that that's the shout draws the bride together he said she's drawn together aren't you glad to be drawn together hey most believers all over the world were drawn together not listening to the same tape what are we drawn together by by the word in his fullness right we're drawn together she's taken up in that mystery of the seventh seal the mystery of going he said and the jews is called by the mystery of the seventh trumpet which is two prophets elijah and moses and they come back they come back see if people are looking for the wrong elijah to come that our elijah already came and did what he was supposed to do didn't you say elijah was come he said i say he's come already amen they come back and there's where the pentecostals is all mixed up they're looking for something to happen the church is done gone and that's to the jews brother brown then stands up on the next sunday morning when he preaches now recognizing your day in its message you recognize it tonight and he says i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national force will put the church in the world council he said but brother ben there's going to be a squeeze there is a squeeze it's just going to keep getting hotter but you understand there is a squeeze if there's not a squeeze now where did everybody go think about it if they started shutting tried to shut the doors today we'd have hundreds of people from this area in an underground church because they recognize the prophet said that and they would come immediately where's the squeeze i'm not trying to preach something new i believe brother branham taught this if i'm wrong bear with me in my folly this but listen what he said he said the world forces this way oh my he said the national force put the church in the world council churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way the world forces us that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my spirit word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word tribulation amen bringing an experience yes oh god you had to go through what you went through are you with me tonight because now you realize who you are and when you know who you are you're an invincible army you can't be defeated amen the spirit of god which is the word of god my word is spirit of life i know this isn't skim milk tonight but just grab hold of it if you can grab hold of the cherry pie if there's a pin in it spit it out but grab hold of it tonight grab hold of the word he said he'll put we'll put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ will put her in her place no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride and the glory out of it oh my aren't you glad to be forced by the power of god aren't you glad the little tribulation that he let you go through is just to make make you aware of who you are oh my what is it will the pressure come musicians go ahead and come will the pressure the squeeze of our day make us give in huh can you answer that tonight will it make us give in i say no will it to be too much for us to handle no it won't amen we'll be taken out before the great tribulation comes on because he said hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us the more we go through the more pressure that we see the more it comes down and says well we're all the same it doesn't matter what a prophet said the more we love him the more they say oh he was a lion prophet the more we love god are you with me the more they say oh it's just a bunch of money hungry preachers the more we love god because we aren't married to a preacher we're not married to a man we're married to christ the word we're not feeding on a preacher we're not feeding on a man we're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen amen it will only produce more love in our hearts for him paul says in romans 8 35 who shall separate us from the love of christ show tribulation it's the same word tribulation pressure will it separate us it didn't separate the first or the second or the third or the fifth was the fourth or the fifth or the sixth church age the real believer it didn't separate them from the love of christ it will not separate the bride from the love of christ in this day whatever form it takes so tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the sovereign that's just our life man all these things we are more than conquered someone say more than conquerors through him that loved us and he expresses us it this way in second corinthians 4 17 for our light tribulation oh glory our light affliction which is but for a moment it's temporary work is for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory he said when he put it on the balance the pressure by the job of being a message believer in this hour the pressure of standing for the word and having to stand for it when family doesn't doesn't stand for it when churches don't stand for it the pressure of standing amen it works for us the pressure if you put it on a scale on one side it'd be so light compared to the glory of seeing who you are you look back and say i was a christian when i went in so i was a christian when i come out oh god can you say that tonight it didn't change me it may have made me have a better understanding it may have it may have helped my character but it didn't change what i believe i'm a christian i'm a believer
