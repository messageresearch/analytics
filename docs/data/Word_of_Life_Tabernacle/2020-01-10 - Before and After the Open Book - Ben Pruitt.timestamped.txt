[34:23] you can brother Andrew is a mighty
[34:25] minister of of the gospel and and a
[34:27] great preacher of this message and so we
[34:29] want to we want to be here if you can
[34:31] for Saturday night and then Sunday
[34:33] morning Saturday at 6:00 Sunday at 10:00
[34:36] and uh the Lord willing will have those
[34:37] Services let's stand together once
[34:43] again sorry to have you up and down but
[34:45] I know for some of you it's difficult to
[34:47] stand for a long time turn with me to
[34:49] Isaiah chapter 49 Isaiah 49: 5 through
[34:55] 7 we'll we'll begin
[34:58] here if you will try to pay attention
[35:01] this morning there's some things that I
[35:03] want to say that I want to make clear to
[35:05] us and and I know that they probably are
[35:07] in your minds and your hearts already
[35:10] but there's things that we need to
[35:11] understand and and there's things that
[35:13] we need to know where we're at and and
[35:16] we've been preaching on uh issues of
[35:19] family and the mind and and and
[35:21] Christian living things like that and
[35:23] this morning I want to lift us up just a
[35:25] little bit and we're going to look at
[35:26] the word and what it means to us and and
[35:30] the word is the most important thing
[35:32] that's why we put most of our service
[35:33] towards the preaching of the word is not
[35:35] to promote a man not to promote a
[35:37] Ministry but it's because the word is
[35:39] what will change your life it's the word
[35:43] and that word is Anointed by the spirit
[35:45] of God to to do miraculous things in
[35:47] your life and so we thank God for the
[35:49] word today and and we want to we want to
[35:51] focus on that this morning I want to
[35:53] title this before and after the open
[35:55] book we'll begin with Isaiah 49 95 and
[35:59] now saith the Lord that formed me from
[36:01] the the womb to be his servant to bring
[36:03] Jacob again to him though Israel be not
[36:06] gathered yet shall I be glorious in the
[36:08] eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my
[36:11] strength now notice how he says God
[36:14] formed me and created me for this
[36:15] purpose to bring Jacob again to him and
[36:17] this is speaking of the Messiah he was
[36:19] created for this purpose to bring Jacob
[36:21] again to him to to be a redeemer for
[36:23] Israel for natural Israel but though
[36:25] Israel be not gathered yet shall I be
[36:27] glorious in the eyes of the Lord my God
[36:28] should be my strength and he said it is
[36:31] a light thing that thou should us be my
[36:33] servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob
[36:35] and to restore the preserved of Israel
[36:38] he said I will also give thee for a
[36:40] light to the Gentiles aren't you glad he
[36:42] did that we wouldn't be here if it
[36:45] wasn't for that promise so he said I
[36:46] will also give thee for a light to the
[36:49] Gentiles and that thou mayest be my
[36:52] salvation unto the end of the Earth and
[36:56] verse 7 says thus say the Lord the
[36:58] Redeemer of Israel and His Holy One to
[36:59] whom to him whom man despiseth to him
[37:03] whom the nation abh whth to a servant of
[37:05] rulers Kings shall see and arise princes
[37:09] also shall worship because the Lord that
[37:11] is faithful I'm glad that he's faithful
[37:14] today the Lord that is faithful amen and
[37:17] the Holy One of Israel and he shall
[37:20] choose Thee I pray the Lord would add
[37:22] his Blessing to the word you may be
[37:24] seated this morning
[37:29] Isaiah is obviously speaking of the
[37:31] Messiah and he gives us a glimpse of the
[37:33] Plan of Redemption in fact you can look
[37:36] in Isaiah and see the entire Plan of
[37:38] Redemption in the book of Isaiah perhaps
[37:41] more than any other book and in the 66th
[37:44] chapters I believe of the book of Isaiah
[37:46] and we see the Fulfillment of verses 5
[37:49] through 7 in Acts 13 when Paul and
[37:53] Barnabas waxed bold and said it was
[37:55] necessary that the word of God should
[37:57] first spoken to you they're talking to
[37:59] the Jewish people of that day to the
[38:01] Jewish leaders of that day he said it
[38:03] was necessary that it was first spoken
[38:05] to you but seeing you put it from you
[38:07] judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting
[38:09] life how did they do that by rejecting
[38:12] the word he said you judged yourselves
[38:14] Unworthy of everlasting life he said Lo
[38:17] we turn to the Gentiles for soath the
[38:21] Lord commanded us saying I have set thee
[38:23] to be a light of the Gentiles that thou
[38:25] should us be for salvation unto the ends
[38:28] of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard
[38:31] this they were glad and glorified the
[38:33] word of the Lord and as many as were
[38:35] ordained to eternal life believed and
[38:38] the word of the Lord was published
[38:40] throughout all the region and so if you
[38:43] go back and look in that chapter that we
[38:45] read in Isaiah uh in in chapter 49 if
[38:48] you go back and look through the entire
[38:50] book of Isaiah in fact through the
[38:52] entire Bible you'll find that Jesus
[38:54] Christ is the entire Plan of
[38:59] Redemption right he is the entire Plan
[39:02] of
[39:03] Redemption and and that's why everything
[39:05] before Christ pointed to Christ right it
[39:09] was all a type and a shadow pointing to
[39:11] something pointing to Christ everything
[39:13] after him points back to him that's
[39:15] right right and so he is the entire Plan
[39:20] of Redemption then how could we dwell on
[39:23] him too
[39:24] much how could we talk about him too
[39:26] much are you with me how could we they
[39:29] accuse brother brandom of of uh of
[39:31] talking too much about Jesus of of
[39:34] talking too much about his deity and and
[39:36] you know I wish I could be accused of
[39:38] that I hope that's all they could accuse
[39:40] me of they they talk about him uh we we
[39:42] talk about him too little if anything at
[39:44] all but when we talk about him he comes
[39:47] around and we need him don't we he is
[39:49] the entire Plan of
[39:51] Redemption he he's the whole book he
[39:53] said in the volume of the book it's
[39:55] written of me every word of it brother
[39:58] Brandon said if you don't see him there
[40:00] then go back and read it
[40:01] again right because he is the entire
[40:05] Plan of Redemption now in the unveiling
[40:08] of God and this is a sermon that people
[40:10] misunderstand so much but it's so
[40:12] wonderful to us as as the bride of
[40:13] Christ that brother Brandon preaches on
[40:16] the unveiling of God he's he's not
[40:18] unveiling himself he's showing that God
[40:20] is veiled behind
[40:22] flesh and it's the unveiling of God and
[40:26] and so he said he did it in the
[40:27] reformers taking on a veil he said
[40:29] taking on a veil until finally it come
[40:32] down to the Lutheran age down to the
[40:34] other age he said it comes out into the
[40:37] complete now he said it come down to the
[40:39] Lutheran Age come down to the other age
[40:41] just like back there it come through
[40:44] Moses and it come through Elijah and it
[40:46] come through all the prophets and it
[40:48] come out in the complete right the
[40:50] fullness of the godhead he said now it
[40:53] come through Luther and it come through
[40:55] the other age it finally comes out in
[40:56] the complete he said and just before it
[40:59] comes a prophet arises
[41:02] again now what kind of a prophet would
[41:04] that be it would be like John right they
[41:07] could say Behold the Lamb of God that
[41:10] takes away the sin of the world he said
[41:12] just before it comes a prophet arises
[41:14] again he said what it does it
[41:17] foreshadows the word it foreshadows the
[41:21] word that's what the prophet appearing
[41:23] on the scene would show us that the word
[41:25] was coming
[41:27] right a prophet appearing on the scene
[41:29] would show us that Christ was coming the
[41:31] word and so John didn't didn't come to
[41:34] promote himself he come to promote the
[41:35] word and brother bam told told it this
[41:37] way he said he didn't say behold my
[41:39] Baptist behold my Methodist behold my
[41:41] Pentecostal he said Behold the Lamb of
[41:44] God who takes away the sins of the world
[41:47] then if there's anybody that ought to be
[41:49] excited about Christ it's
[41:52] us it's us because we we see the
[41:55] fullness of him we see him for who he
[41:57] really is we see him not only as a
[41:59] savior but a Healer not only as a god of
[42:02] yesterday but a god of yesterday today
[42:03] and forever not only has a God that
[42:06] existed back 2,000 years ago but a God
[42:09] that exists
[42:10] today and he's a Healer do you believe
[42:12] that today he's a savior he's a miracle
[42:16] worker we know that that's true I see
[42:19] sister frit sitting back there this
[42:21] morning she knows today God's A Healer
[42:24] Brother David can testify out streaming
[42:26] this morning God's a healer how many of
[42:28] you can testify that he's a Healer why
[42:30] he's the same yesterday today and
[42:32] forever this message didn't take Christ
[42:34] away from you it pointed you to
[42:36] Christ it it was it was the very message
[42:39] itself that showed them who Christ
[42:41] was Behold the Lamb of God that takes
[42:44] away the sin of the world oh that ought
[42:46] to make us excited today to know that we
[42:49] we've seen him we can see who he really
[42:51] is what it does he said it foreshadows
[42:53] the word showing back here revealing
[42:55] what's been done what's been left off
[42:57] that the church will be not without
[43:00] understanding so the church had have
[43:02] understanding now he said when this then
[43:04] when this Fades out then like John said
[43:07] I must decrease he must increase then
[43:11] all it all comes into
[43:14] him amen you see what age we live in
[43:18] it's everything being wrapped up in
[43:21] Christ not in a preacher not in a church
[43:24] not in a cult not in a theology not in a
[43:26] denomination but Christ having the
[43:28] preeminence Among
[43:30] Us amen God won't let anybody else take
[43:34] that preeminent position not in the
[43:38] bride you start lifting a man up to a
[43:40] preeminent position God will bring him
[43:43] down because the now in the bride we
[43:45] won't have a preeminent man but it'll be
[43:48] the preeminence of Christ because that's
[43:50] why a prophet
[43:51] came amen amen he said then he is fully
[43:56] manifested through Luther through Wesley
[43:57] and Pentecostal age and on down on down
[44:00] he said he is fully manifested you see
[44:02] come down just the
[44:04] manifestation God unfolding he said see
[44:08] him now notice fulfilled in his promises
[44:11] for this day as they
[44:15] had amen his promises for this day he
[44:18] said he would do certain things in this
[44:20] day and he's done those
[44:23] things we should have Supreme confidence
[44:26] in the message of the
[44:27] our young people should have Supreme
[44:29] confidence in the message of the hour we
[44:32] shouldn't be easily dissuaded or
[44:34] persuaded to go some other direction why
[44:37] because this message it shows us exactly
[44:39] what God was said he would do and it did
[44:42] it and it's doing it in the bride
[44:45] today exactly what he said he would do
[44:48] now brother BR said Moses was the word
[44:50] that day he said because the word was
[44:53] given to him for that day Moses he said
[44:56] Joseph was the word in his his days
[44:58] portraying Christ exactly each one of
[45:00] them was the word he said and when Jesus
[45:02] came he was the word in its
[45:04] fullness because the whole Plan of
[45:07] Redemption laid in
[45:11] him he said the whole Plan of Redemption
[45:13] didn't lay in Moses didn't lay in Joseph
[45:16] didn't lay in Elijah see they were only
[45:19] part of the word pointing to it see he
[45:21] said now notice keep your thought he
[45:23] said here it comes as I say see the
[45:26] whole plan wasn't in them they were
[45:28] pointing to it therefore after him the
[45:30] fullness we cannot point to something
[45:33] else it points back to him the word and
[45:37] brother Brandon picks up his
[45:40] Bible he says this is the complete
[45:43] Revelation nothing can be added or taken
[45:45] away from it there is the complete
[45:48] Revelation and if there ever was a Bible
[45:50] believing people it ought to be
[45:54] us if the Bible say you say well I'm
[45:56] waiting on a special Revelation not even
[45:57] brother brandham could get a special
[45:59] Revelation outside of the
[46:01] Bible it's true brother brandom even
[46:04] said that if God would do that he said
[46:06] maybe he had the authority to do that
[46:07] but it would be
[46:09] wrong a revelation outside of the
[46:12] word right and then so whatever
[46:14] Revelation we've caught that's outside
[46:15] of the word couldn't be right it has to
[46:18] be wrong because this is the complete
[46:20] Revelation nothing can be added or taken
[46:21] away from it he said there is the
[46:23] complete
[46:24] Revelation he said all that he said a
[46:27] shadow of him to come but when he come
[46:29] he was the perfect Hebrews 1 God in
[46:31] sunry times spoke to the fathers through
[46:33] the prophets God spoke through veils the
[46:34] prophets but in this last days through
[46:37] his son Jesus Christ there you are he
[46:39] says unveiled out there on Calvary the
[46:40] Son of God unveiled he said notice Made
[46:43] Alive and today when the word I love
[46:46] this is manifested in human
[46:51] vessels amen he didn't just say the word
[46:54] manifested in a human vessel not even
[46:56] just the human vessel Christ but what
[46:57] did God do all that God was he poured
[46:59] into Christ all that Christ was he
[47:01] poured into the church and we saw God
[47:04] manifested in a human vessel in William
[47:06] brandham but now we see God in human
[47:10] vessels amen veils he said it's
[47:13] absolutely the word fulfilled in that
[47:15] day which comes back to
[47:17] God amen amen now he said being baptized
[47:22] into him according to 1 Corinthians 12
[47:24] we become identified with him
[47:27] amen now in in 1965 in events made clear
[47:31] by prophecy brother BR says for the
[47:32] Bible is a living foretold witness of
[47:34] Jesus Christ and as the Earth has grown
[47:37] into its fullness also Vines grow into
[47:40] their fullness he said the day grows
[47:42] into its fullness the Bible was
[47:44] manifested in his fullness in the person
[47:47] of Jesus Christ he was the word of God
[47:50] revealed the whole Complete Book of
[47:54] redemption
[47:57] now the Plan of Redemption is a prophecy
[48:00] in the Old Testament fulfilled in the
[48:01] New Testament you look at the Plan of
[48:03] Redemption you see the prophecy coming
[48:05] when when when God himself made a
[48:08] prophecy and he said he began to say uh
[48:11] thy seed will will bruise his his head
[48:14] and it'll bruise his heel and he made
[48:17] the prophecy over the serpent the
[48:18] serpent seed what it would do and what
[48:20] the woman seed would do and the prophecy
[48:23] come from there and it come down through
[48:24] the line of Judah and it come out
[48:27] finally in the birth of Jesus Christ and
[48:30] all these prophets in the meantime
[48:33] prefigured him and they were the word
[48:35] but they were not the fullness of the
[48:36] word and then it come down to his birth
[48:40] that's an event of of redemption and
[48:42] then to his death an event he had to be
[48:45] born he had to die an event of
[48:48] redemption his
[48:50] burial was an event of
[48:53] redemption it was a part of the Plan of
[48:55] Redemption he had to be buried for three
[48:57] days and there's things certain things
[48:59] that had to take place during that time
[49:02] we find his
[49:04] resurrection a part of redemption
[49:07] because he had to be raised so we could
[49:08] be
[49:09] raised right he was the first one the
[49:12] wave shief the first one to come up we
[49:15] find so he that was his resurrection we
[49:17] find then he went into interceding for
[49:19] us his intercession he sat on the throne
[49:23] and he made intercession for us aren't
[49:25] you glad for that part of redemption
[49:28] today he's ever interceding the Bible
[49:31] says he's there he's interceding for you
[49:35] and we have an advocate the Bible says
[49:37] with the father any man sin we have an
[49:39] advocate aren't you glad for that
[49:40] Advocate
[49:42] today so there's intercession but
[49:45] there's one more part of redemption and
[49:48] that's his claiming
[49:50] work right that's his claiming work he
[49:53] he he was he was born he was died he was
[49:58] buried he was resurrected he interceded
[50:01] and then he comes to claim those who he
[50:03] interceded
[50:06] for at some point The Plan of Redemption
[50:10] completes does that make sense this
[50:12] comes around and so now we've seen the
[50:14] Jewish part of it the Gentile part of it
[50:16] and now him claiming what he has
[50:20] redeemed and when we go and look in
[50:23] Revelation when we see the book open and
[50:25] we'll go to those scriptures in a moment
[50:26] we see the book open what is that he's
[50:29] claiming what he has
[50:32] redeemed now the opening of the book is
[50:36] the great event of redemption in the end
[50:39] times it signifies the lamb is asserting
[50:42] his rights to what he
[50:44] redeemed they're already
[50:47] his you were his before he ever was born
[50:51] death burial Resurrection all of that
[50:53] you were already his right you were in
[50:55] in the mind of God before the foundation
[50:57] of the
[50:58] world right you had to be but but now
[51:02] he's actually fulfilling just as he
[51:04] actually fulfilled the the birth the
[51:06] death the burial the Resurrection The
[51:08] intercession he's fulfilling the
[51:10] claiming work in this day he's making
[51:14] his Redemption claims see he's opening
[51:17] the book he's coming out of his
[51:20] intercession place to make a claim on
[51:24] what he has already redeemed
[51:27] how does he do
[51:29] that how do you how do you know who you
[51:33] are today as a Christian by the
[51:38] word right and there's something inside
[51:41] of you that that accepts
[51:43] that if you boil it down and you may
[51:45] have shouted you may have spoken tongues
[51:47] you may have you may have run all over
[51:48] the church and and I've done that too I
[51:51] believe in that and I will again the
[51:54] Lord willing God never took those things
[51:56] out of the church but that's not how I
[51:59] know that I've been
[52:01] redeemed how do I Know Who I Am by the
[52:05] word of the hour there's something
[52:08] inside of me that that that just
[52:10] believes that I can't be nothing
[52:13] else you could come and and bring
[52:15] another a word of another age a light of
[52:17] another age you you can't present that
[52:19] to Mary Mary knew what her age was what
[52:22] the light was why an angel come to her
[52:24] and said blessed art thou among women
[52:27] huh she knew who she was Paul knew who
[52:30] he was and and all through the church AG
[52:33] brother brand recognized who he was but
[52:35] now we have to recognize who we
[52:38] are and he Reveals His word he makes his
[52:42] claims on Earth by revealing his word
[52:46] and so during this time as he takes the
[52:48] book he opens the book and he comes to
[52:51] claim his
[52:52] subjects and then what
[52:54] happens it opens up or it begins the
[52:58] process of rapture and
[53:00] Resurrection now look that couldn't
[53:03] happen till this
[53:05] day and I'll I'll show that to you now
[53:08] brother B said in the breach he said the
[53:09] first thing that represented that
[53:11] Redemption come the lamb that had been
[53:13] slain from the foundation of the world
[53:16] he said he took the book opened the book
[53:19] tore off the seals we know it wasn't a
[53:21] book like this but a scroll seal with
[53:23] Seven Seals he tore off the seals he
[53:25] said and sent it down to the Earth to a
[53:28] seventh
[53:30] angel to reveal it to his
[53:35] people he said well where does brother
[53:37] brandham get that Revelation
[53:40] 10 right he gets that from Revelations
[53:42] 10 Revelation 10:1 I saw another Mighty
[53:44] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[53:46] the cloud and the rainbow was upon his
[53:47] head his feet was at were the Sun and
[53:49] his feet his face was as it were the sun
[53:51] his feet as pillars of fire and his hand
[53:54] a little book open and he said his right
[53:56] foot on the sea and his left foot on the
[53:58] earth and he cried with a loud voice as
[54:00] when a lion Roth and when he had cried
[54:02] seven Thunders uttered their voices and
[54:04] when the seven Thunders had uttered
[54:05] their voices he said I was about to ride
[54:07] I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto
[54:09] me seal up those things which the seven
[54:11] Thunders uttered and write them not why
[54:13] he was still
[54:15] interceding his claiming work what
[54:17] hadn't begun
[54:18] yet are you with me
[54:21] now and we we don't understand God
[54:24] sometimes because he's still interceding
[54:26] today day but the days of ignorance are
[54:29] passed right now now we have to we see
[54:32] God
[54:33] unveiled just like in the Old Testament
[54:35] he was inter they were interceded for
[54:38] they they had a priest go in and they
[54:41] God accepted a substitute but one day he
[54:43] didn't accept that anymore the ve was
[54:45] rent and there he was in plain view and
[54:47] today he's in plain view in the
[54:50] word right and that's the the time that
[54:52] we moved into into this claiming time
[54:54] not that he doesn't intercede anymore
[54:56] but we're in the claiming time does that
[54:59] make sense we're still in the latery and
[55:01] church age but yet we're in the bride
[55:04] age we're we're to be called out of that
[55:08] called up high he said come up hither
[55:11] amen amen that's the day that we're
[55:13] living in now he said and the angel
[55:17] which I saw upon the sea and upon the
[55:19] Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and
[55:21] swear by him that liveth forever and
[55:22] ever which created heaven and the things
[55:23] that there in are the earth and the
[55:25] things that there in are in the sea and
[55:26] the things which are therein that there
[55:28] should be time no longer but in the day
[55:32] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[55:34] he shall begin to sound the mystery of
[55:37] God should be finished as Heath declared
[55:39] to his servants the
[55:40] prophets where did that open book come
[55:43] from come from Revelation 5 the lamb
[55:44] came and took it he opened it up and he
[55:47] put his feet on the land and the Sea and
[55:50] he handed it to the seventh
[55:51] angel in the days of the voice of the
[55:54] seventh angel when he should begin to
[55:55] sound but the in make that up that's
[55:57] what the Bible
[56:01] says now and he brother brand says this
[56:04] in the breach again he said when the
[56:06] seals are broken the mystery is revealed
[56:07] down comes the angel the messenger
[56:10] Christ setting his foot upon the land
[56:11] upon the sea with a rainbow over his
[56:13] head he said and now remember the
[56:15] seventh angels on Earth at the time of
[56:17] this coming at the time of this coming
[56:19] so whenever that takes place I I see the
[56:24] thing is if you don't believe that the
[56:27] book is open and that's not what I'm
[56:28] preaching about this morning but I just
[56:30] want to drop this in if we don't believe
[56:32] that the book is open then we can't
[56:34] believe that we have to believe brother
[56:37] bram's coming
[56:38] back right because if the book isn't
[56:40] open brother brandham has to come back
[56:41] and be there when that angel comes
[56:44] down right because that's what he said
[56:46] the seventh angel is on Earth he comes
[56:48] down he gives it to the seventh angel
[56:49] but in the days of the voice is the
[56:50] seventh
[56:51] angel but
[56:53] now I I want to look at the difference
[56:55] that this open book
[56:57] made you see there was a time it wasn't
[57:00] open there was a time that it was and I
[57:03] believe and you're welcome to believe
[57:05] whatever you want to I won't run you off
[57:08] but I believe that the book is
[57:11] open because I see what it did for us
[57:15] and brother BR since the book opened the
[57:16] Bible become a new
[57:19] book since it was open it the Bible
[57:22] become a new book and you see how we can
[57:24] see where we are and who we are and how
[57:26] gives us Faith to live out everyday
[57:27] lives it doesn't make us some kind of
[57:29] super people and a super race somewhere
[57:31] but it just gives us the faith to
[57:33] believe and know who we
[57:36] are the book is
[57:38] open I believe that
[57:41] now you take a picture of
[57:45] Heaven if you were recording you know we
[57:47] used to have those old VHS Cam quars and
[57:49] set them right here and watch if you
[57:52] could now we have our
[57:54] phones if you could have been there in
[57:56] heaven when John was there or whatever
[57:59] that scene was that place in that Vision
[58:01] or wherever John was caught up to you
[58:04] could be there and see the throne room
[58:06] and see all the the the elders and the
[58:08] beasts and all of these wonderful
[58:11] sites and you see a bloody lamb come
[58:14] out now look look at how that that
[58:16] picture or that movie if we can say that
[58:18] video would
[58:20] change as you go
[58:22] along
[58:24] because before
[58:27] this takes
[58:29] place they don't know how that claiming
[58:33] work is to
[58:34] happen or how if he's ever going to take
[58:37] that book of names that book of
[58:40] redemption right and so there's weeping
[58:43] in
[58:44] heaven there's
[58:46] sadness right John is
[58:50] weeping everything there's a loud voice
[58:53] you can see it going out it's a serious
[58:55] time who is
[58:57] worthy right to open the
[59:00] book who is worthy and they looked at
[59:03] everything they looked at me and you and
[59:05] everybody else said he's not
[59:09] worthy Isaac's not worthy Ben's not
[59:11] worthy nobody's
[59:14] worthy who is worthy that no Prophet was
[59:18] worthy who worthy to open the book and
[59:21] to loose the seals
[59:23] thereof and what a
[59:26] a thought that was to John well H how
[59:29] can redemption ever be
[59:31] complete you see and what that does is
[59:34] before see the fullness of redemption is
[59:36] the change of our
[59:38] bodies right we haven't received the
[59:41] fullness of his claiming work yet
[59:43] because that's the fullness of it is is
[59:45] the change of our bodies but that's been
[59:48] set in
[59:49] motion before he takes the book just
[59:52] like in the Old Testament before he he
[59:54] died on Calvary they could only hope and
[59:57] look forward to something they could
[59:59] look at it and say this is what's coming
[1:00:02] we believe a messiah is coming and some
[1:00:04] of them still do that today because they
[1:00:06] don't have a revelation of who he is
[1:00:08] they say there's a messiah coming
[1:00:10] there's a messiah coming but they've
[1:00:11] been saying that for thousands of years
[1:00:12] but one day God himself testified and
[1:00:15] said he's
[1:00:16] here he he was there on a cross he was
[1:00:19] hanging there dying bleeding for our
[1:00:20] sins he's here so before that there's
[1:00:22] sadness there there's there's worry
[1:00:25] there's trouble
[1:00:26] because you know we know we're going to
[1:00:28] have trouble down here we still have
[1:00:29] trouble down here 2020 is going to
[1:00:32] happen and 2021 hasn't got off to such a
[1:00:35] great start
[1:00:37] either these things are going to
[1:00:39] happen life is full of it if you go back
[1:00:42] in history you'll find heartache after
[1:00:43] heartache after heartache but the thing
[1:00:45] about Christians Paul said if in this
[1:00:47] life only we have hope we're of all men
[1:00:49] most
[1:00:50] miserable right because if we only have
[1:00:52] hope in this life why not just eat drink
[1:00:53] and be marry you're going to die anyway
[1:00:57] right but but now he says there's a
[1:00:59] Resurrection coming but now this was a
[1:01:02] hope it was a hope to just think about
[1:01:04] those ones that were laid away in the
[1:01:06] grave there in Palestine Abraham and all
[1:01:08] those ones were laying there and and
[1:01:10] they waited in paradise whatever that it
[1:01:12] was waiting on that day and then when
[1:01:15] the graves were open here they
[1:01:17] come what it was a completely different
[1:01:20] atmosphere
[1:01:21] after than it was
[1:01:24] before the atmosphere of Heaven
[1:01:27] changed and if you look at what happened
[1:01:29] in this when the seals were open that
[1:01:31] the actual atmosphere of Heaven changed
[1:01:34] from this serious time when they were
[1:01:38] worried and concerned and John was
[1:01:40] weeping to a rejoicing and a and a and a
[1:01:44] wonder and a great a a great worship
[1:01:47] that began to take
[1:01:49] place why because the book was
[1:01:52] open now what happened here the opening
[1:01:55] of the word said in motion the events of
[1:01:57] the Rapture and
[1:01:59] Resurrection now there's one thing for
[1:02:01] the word to be spoken another thing for
[1:02:02] it to begin to come to pass you see we
[1:02:04] can look at and we'll read in a moment
[1:02:06] but we can look at the parts of the
[1:02:08] Bible that speak about the Rapture and
[1:02:09] say this part has already taken
[1:02:12] place did you know that now not that we
[1:02:15] know there's going to be a literal body
[1:02:17] change right there's going to be we'll
[1:02:20] see Jesus brother brandom said we'll see
[1:02:21] him in a literal body he said that's
[1:02:23] what Believers believe we'll see in a
[1:02:26] Corporal body but but we know that it's
[1:02:31] begun it's begun that's what a prophet
[1:02:33] taught us now look before it hadn't
[1:02:35] begun now it
[1:02:38] has this is astounding I don't think we
[1:02:40] realize what what this message means and
[1:02:44] what it means to be a believer of it and
[1:02:47] what it means to be a Christian in this
[1:02:49] day
[1:02:51] huh it puts us on the other
[1:02:54] side are you with me now here was this
[1:02:56] side was was was mourning here on this
[1:02:58] side if you look at the Old Testament
[1:03:00] was all these things but now you're not
[1:03:01] only in the New Testament with all the
[1:03:03] grace and the glory of God but now
[1:03:05] you're at the very end of his claiming
[1:03:10] work and you can see the event set in
[1:03:13] motion because the resurrection cannot
[1:03:15] happen till the lamb takes the
[1:03:19] book right that's why again if you don't
[1:03:22] believe the book is open then you have
[1:03:24] to believe brother brandom's going to
[1:03:25] come back if if he was the seventh angel
[1:03:26] Earthly messenger you have to believe
[1:03:28] he's coming back because you'd have to
[1:03:30] believe that it's got to happen yet so
[1:03:32] you're waiting on him to come back and
[1:03:33] there's no biblical proof of that right
[1:03:36] and nothing in the message to tell us
[1:03:38] that right and and it's one or the other
[1:03:40] you can't really have any in between
[1:03:43] because it has to be that
[1:03:45] Messenger right it's his message that
[1:03:48] and that's where you talk about
[1:03:49] separating the message and the messenger
[1:03:51] and and we don't want to separate that
[1:03:53] we realize he came with a message
[1:03:57] right and so he was on the earth at that
[1:03:59] time but his message was like John
[1:04:02] Behold the Lamb of God behold the word
[1:04:05] now
[1:04:06] look so the resurrection cannot happen
[1:04:08] till the lamb takes the book listen what
[1:04:10] brother Brown says in the breach he said
[1:04:11] but now he comes from here at this last
[1:04:14] seal he said he's no more mediator he's
[1:04:16] King now and what does he do if he's a
[1:04:20] king he has to have
[1:04:23] subjects brother Brandon puts it so
[1:04:24] simply here if he's a king he has to
[1:04:27] have
[1:04:28] subjects and his subjects is them that
[1:04:31] he has
[1:04:32] redeemed and they cannot come before him
[1:04:36] until he takes the rights of
[1:04:39] redemption
[1:04:42] amen how can you come before him until
[1:04:44] he takes the right don't you see it's
[1:04:46] not what you do we cannot work ourselves
[1:04:48] into into Redemption you can't do that
[1:04:51] no more than they could in the Old
[1:04:52] Testament no matter what they did they
[1:04:54] could be no more redeemed than just a
[1:04:56] covering for sin until Christ came
[1:04:58] himself and did it for them and don't
[1:05:01] you realize we could not work ourselves
[1:05:02] into Redemption today there had to come
[1:05:05] a a lamb that come and took the book and
[1:05:07] opened the book and revealed the seals
[1:05:09] there had that had to happen we couldn't
[1:05:11] work our way into
[1:05:12] Redemption and that becomes a struggle
[1:05:14] as as young people and as as we become
[1:05:17] older even sometimes it's a struggle
[1:05:19] because in our minds we think well I'm
[1:05:21] not everything that I should be but
[1:05:23] that's not what it's up to he come and
[1:05:25] took the book
[1:05:26] there was one worthy you were not worthy
[1:05:29] you couldn't begin the process of
[1:05:31] redemption neither can you bring about a
[1:05:35] resurrection that's why I get concerned
[1:05:36] whenever I see
[1:05:38] people
[1:05:39] that are looking for something to happen
[1:05:42] and I believe there will be things
[1:05:43] happen but you can't make them
[1:05:45] happen brother Brandon gives us certain
[1:05:48] things promises about about the end
[1:05:50] times about before the Rapture and
[1:05:51] certain things that'll take place and I
[1:05:53] believe to me everything that has to
[1:05:56] happen has
[1:05:57] happened right but but he talks about a
[1:05:59] move of God and the the Revival being on
[1:06:01] for the bride again we got have to
[1:06:03] participate in that right it's already
[1:06:05] on but but there's uh he talks about
[1:06:09] things there could be many things take
[1:06:11] place that we could see brother brandom
[1:06:13] talked about how in the last hour or two
[1:06:15] all those prophecies before Jesus death
[1:06:17] all those prophecies come to pass so it
[1:06:20] could all be happening today and you
[1:06:21] wouldn't know
[1:06:22] it right but but I believe that
[1:06:24] everything's ready we're living in that
[1:06:26] time it could be any day or any hour
[1:06:28] even in the things we know but but when
[1:06:31] you begin to look at those things and
[1:06:33] and realize that there's nothing that I
[1:06:34] can
[1:06:35] do I'm not going to get into a
[1:06:37] resurrection because I follow a certain
[1:06:40] preacher and listen to a certain
[1:06:43] preacher in the
[1:06:45] message that's not going to put me in
[1:06:48] Resurrection if if God would leave me
[1:06:50] God forbid I I plan on being here the
[1:06:52] rest of my life if you all will put up
[1:06:54] with me but God forbid God would lead me
[1:06:56] to go to Colorado or
[1:06:59] California I would go there and I'd
[1:07:01] stand up here in the pulpit and say now
[1:07:03] y'all that want to go with me you come
[1:07:04] on not one of you would have to
[1:07:06] go huh why your Resurrection is not
[1:07:11] dependent on
[1:07:13] me this is just an old flesh an old old
[1:07:18] uh Corpus they say this one's a little
[1:07:20] bigger than most but it's there you know
[1:07:22] it's just you know it's just the Flesh
[1:07:26] and God speaks I believe God speaks to
[1:07:28] the ministry I believe that with all my
[1:07:30] heart but if God if if I pass away if
[1:07:33] something happened to me and the
[1:07:34] resurrection hasn't taken place the
[1:07:35] Rapture hasn't taken place then I
[1:07:36] believe that it'll be somebody
[1:07:38] else someone else will stand in this
[1:07:40] pulpit and preach to you the
[1:07:42] word right and it won't be dependent on
[1:07:45] say well I have to hear this one I if I
[1:07:46] could just hear that or if I could just
[1:07:48] be under that anointing listen the
[1:07:49] anointing is on the age you're an
[1:07:54] eagle are you with me today you're an
[1:07:56] ego it's not dependent I don't want to
[1:07:59] put down coming to church because I
[1:08:00] believe in church I believe in going to
[1:08:03] church I believe that Christians go to
[1:08:06] church that's what Christians do go to
[1:08:08] church but that's not going to put you
[1:08:09] in a resurrection paying your ties is
[1:08:11] not going to Rapture you but you do that
[1:08:14] because you know the the book's been
[1:08:17] open is claiming his is redemption work
[1:08:20] has been done not just a Christ of
[1:08:23] history but he's been made real to us
[1:08:25] today
[1:08:27] now brother Brown says he comes from
[1:08:30] here he said at the last oh I backed up
[1:08:33] a little bit I'm sorry that thing
[1:08:35] actually keeps me from backing up too
[1:08:37] much so youall should be grateful for
[1:08:39] that I tend to repeat myself now and I
[1:08:42] hate that too and he said now he walks
[1:08:45] forth from a mediator where death put us
[1:08:47] in the grave now notice what he does
[1:08:50] where he from a mediator where death put
[1:08:52] us in the grave he comes forth with the
[1:08:54] rights
[1:08:57] death put us in the grave he comes forth
[1:08:59] with the rights and even those who are
[1:09:01] alive and remain till his coming shall
[1:09:04] not hinder them which are asleep for the
[1:09:07] trumpet of God shall sound at that last
[1:09:10] trumpet when the last seal is broke when
[1:09:13] the seventh angel is giving his message
[1:09:15] the last trumpet shall sound and the
[1:09:17] dead in Christ shall
[1:09:20] rise and I'm sure the people sitting
[1:09:23] there under that prophetic word thought
[1:09:24] oh it's happening right now
[1:09:26] tomorrow night we're going to be in the
[1:09:27] Rapture tomorrow morning as soon as that
[1:09:29] seven seal is open we're going to be
[1:09:32] there but the part that wasn't open is
[1:09:34] we didn't know the day or the
[1:09:36] hour right and here we are all these
[1:09:38] years later but that promise is still
[1:09:41] true we who are alive and remain will be
[1:09:45] caught up together with them to meet him
[1:09:46] in the air he said he
[1:09:48] claims that's his claiming
[1:09:51] work his claiming work is not just to
[1:09:53] make you a message believer it's to
[1:09:54] Rapture you
[1:09:55] yes it's not just to say I believe the
[1:09:58] message it's not just to say I I'm in a
[1:10:00] New Movement it's not to bring you into
[1:10:02] a new church age no church ages are
[1:10:06] over that that's
[1:10:08] before right denominations are before
[1:10:10] the opening of the word won't be another
[1:10:13] denomination now not one with that that
[1:10:15] God starts see God started those
[1:10:18] movements that became
[1:10:19] denominations but this movement that God
[1:10:21] started won't become a denomination it
[1:10:23] can't this bride can't fall all are you
[1:10:26] with me now because it's going up
[1:10:29] time amen the last cycle is has spin
[1:10:32] itself out now it's it's stopped if you
[1:10:34] ever took a top and just spun it on the
[1:10:36] ground or on a table and you take that
[1:10:38] that little top it's the thing kids used
[1:10:40] to play with and you take it and you
[1:10:41] spin that thing and when you do it spins
[1:10:43] for a while and what does it do it slows
[1:10:46] down and finally it stops where are we
[1:10:49] at we're at the last Revolution of that
[1:10:52] last turn uh as it's slowly stopping and
[1:10:57] then it falls over it's
[1:10:59] done are you with me now that's where
[1:11:02] we're
[1:11:03] at
[1:11:07] amen amen when the last seal is broke he
[1:11:10] claims he's come forth now to claim his
[1:11:13] possession 1 Thessalonians 4:13 but I
[1:11:15] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:11:17] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:11:18] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:11:20] others which have no hope for if we
[1:11:22] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:11:24] even so them also sleep in Jesus will
[1:11:26] God bring with him for this we say unto
[1:11:28] you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:11:30] which are alive and remain until the
[1:11:32] coming of the Lord shall not prevent or
[1:11:33] hinder them which are asleep for the
[1:11:35] Lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:11:37] with a shout notice how he comes he'll
[1:11:39] descend from heaven with a shout with
[1:11:41] the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:11:43] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:11:45] shall rise first amen we're going to see
[1:11:47] him one of these days the dead in Christ
[1:11:50] shall rise first and then we which are
[1:11:53] alive and remain oh I want to be one of
[1:11:55] of those he didn't just say alive but
[1:11:57] alive and remain amen Amen Alive and
[1:12:01] remain we which are alive and remain
[1:12:02] should be caught up together with them
[1:12:04] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
[1:12:06] air so shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:12:10] amen from that moment on even during the
[1:12:12] the the tribulation period we're at the
[1:12:15] marriage supper of the Lamb during the
[1:12:17] Thousand-Year Reign we're there with him
[1:12:18] in the city after that we're still with
[1:12:20] him we're ever going to be with the
[1:12:22] Lord amen wherefore Comfort one another
[1:12:27] with these
[1:12:29] words ever since Paul wrote those words
[1:12:32] Christians all down through history have
[1:12:34] been listening for that
[1:12:36] shout right because they knew if the
[1:12:38] shout took place then the voice would
[1:12:41] come and the trumpet but they were
[1:12:42] listening for the shout because the
[1:12:45] shout was the indication of his
[1:12:48] coming brother B says three things
[1:12:50] happen a voice a shout a voice of
[1:12:53] trumpet has to happen before Jesus
[1:12:54] appears he said now I shout he said
[1:12:56] Jesus does all three of them when he's
[1:12:58] descending are you still with me this
[1:13:01] morning
[1:13:02] amen I I love to preach on these things
[1:13:05] I just just bear with me if none of
[1:13:07] y'all if it doesn't help you any it
[1:13:09] helps me so y'all just pray for me this
[1:13:11] morning I'll get some help listen he
[1:13:14] says a shout he said Jesus does all
[1:13:16] three of them when he's
[1:13:18] descending a shout what is the shout
[1:13:21] it's the message going
[1:13:23] forth first the living bread of of Life
[1:13:26] bringing forth the
[1:13:29] bride amen this is the seventh Angel's
[1:13:34] message are you with me
[1:13:38] now you realize if you say well I'm in
[1:13:40] the message well when it's been turned
[1:13:43] around say well there the message in you
[1:13:45] but if that message message is in you
[1:13:48] you realize what you're saying I'm in
[1:13:50] the rapture
[1:13:55] if I go by way of the Grave I'm in the
[1:13:58] resurrection you're saying I won't
[1:14:00] partake of the second
[1:14:03] death and then people live just any way
[1:14:06] they want to say well I'm in the message
[1:14:07] you know if the message can't take you
[1:14:10] and change you from what you were to
[1:14:11] what he wants you to be how do you
[1:14:13] expect it to take you in a
[1:14:16] Rapture right and so but to be in the
[1:14:18] message is not to conform to a certain
[1:14:21] set of Creeds or dogmas but it's to
[1:14:23] actually have the living life of Christ
[1:14:25] inside of you amen this one who revealed
[1:14:28] himself to us in this age just to be
[1:14:30] that manifested word are you with me
[1:14:33] now now this is the seventh Angel's
[1:14:36] message in the first seal brother B said
[1:14:37] until it comes to that last Angel
[1:14:40] speaking of these seven Church Angel
[1:14:42] Messengers until it comes to that last
[1:14:44] angel now he has no certain mystery but
[1:14:47] he gathers up all that's been lost in
[1:14:49] them mother
[1:14:50] ages and then today people try to point
[1:14:54] things at brother brandom and say well
[1:14:55] he he plagiarized things he didn't
[1:14:58] plagiarize near as much as I
[1:15:02] do most of my sermon is quotes in
[1:15:05] scriptures I hope we can quote what the
[1:15:07] Bible
[1:15:08] says what the scripture says and brother
[1:15:11] random took all these Lo sins some of
[1:15:13] the things he he took and he said it he
[1:15:15] got went to L and he went to all these
[1:15:17] other things he didn't take word for
[1:15:18] word what they said but what did he do
[1:15:19] he come and he brought it all together
[1:15:22] because these men had Revelation they
[1:15:23] they were a part of the word for their
[1:15:25] day they were Bride for their day but
[1:15:26] not all of it right so the angel
[1:15:29] messenger at the last Church age
[1:15:30] messenger has no certain mystery but it
[1:15:32] gathers up all that's been lost in the
[1:15:34] mother ages all the truths that wasn't
[1:15:36] truly revealed yet see they had part of
[1:15:38] it they had it in a in a form or in a
[1:15:39] fashion not the truth of it he said see
[1:15:42] as the Revelation come or not all the
[1:15:44] truth of it he said as the Revelation
[1:15:45] come then he reveals those things in his
[1:15:47] day now if you want to know who the
[1:15:49] messenger is look what what happens
[1:15:51] after this message Goes Forth what
[1:15:55] result does this message have look at
[1:15:57] John Wesley John Wesley to to us would
[1:15:59] be a lesser messenger than Whitfield or
[1:16:01] Spurgeon who come
[1:16:03] later as far as what he believed
[1:16:07] doctrinally Whitfield and Spurgeon were
[1:16:09] both doctrinally greater but go and read
[1:16:12] Spurgeon you'll you'll ID he says I'm
[1:16:14] like a candle me in front of John Wesley
[1:16:16] even though he didn't agree with him
[1:16:17] doctrinally he said it's like the candle
[1:16:19] in front of the Sun as far as the impact
[1:16:22] our Ministries has
[1:16:23] had and and Whitfield was the same way
[1:16:26] Whitfield was a great preacher but his
[1:16:29] ministry had no lasting impact like John
[1:16:31] Wesley did why because God chose him
[1:16:34] John Wesley to be the messenger of the
[1:16:36] hour because he didn't need that
[1:16:38] fullness yet what he needed was
[1:16:41] sanctification right that was the part
[1:16:42] Wesley was bringing and so he brought
[1:16:44] that part in such a way and God anointed
[1:16:47] that Ministry and brought it out in such
[1:16:48] a way that that it it changed the world
[1:16:51] that then was and look what happened
[1:16:53] what did God do there was l of other
[1:16:55] healing revivalists lots of people who
[1:16:57] could speak better as far as use more
[1:16:59] proper English than brother brandham
[1:17:02] lots of people who had healings and
[1:17:03] miracles take place but what happened
[1:17:06] there was an impact there was a message
[1:17:08] that went
[1:17:08] forth and it did
[1:17:13] something and you say well it just
[1:17:15] created chaos and misunderstanding you
[1:17:17] can't tell me that that's not what it
[1:17:19] did in my
[1:17:22] life it it calmed the chaos
[1:17:25] brought understanding the message didn't
[1:17:28] do that people do that huh but the
[1:17:31] message doesn't bring chaos and
[1:17:34] misunderstanding message brings
[1:17:36] understanding because it's the light of
[1:17:37] the
[1:17:39] hour and so we need to be careful how we
[1:17:41] talk about it and how we talk about
[1:17:44] message people
[1:17:45] frankly because the Believers this hour
[1:17:47] won't be
[1:17:49] perfect nobody said they would be
[1:17:50] perfect but you're still the bride I
[1:17:53] didn't make you that he made you that
[1:17:54] now there may be three kinds of
[1:17:55] Believers but he didn't tell me which
[1:17:57] was
[1:17:59] which he never gave me an Insight on
[1:18:01] that you got to know that for
[1:18:04] yourself but it's not up to me to put
[1:18:06] you in or out that's up to God I have to
[1:18:08] preach the word the word put you in or
[1:18:11] out right you can either say I reject it
[1:18:15] and Paul like Paul said he said you took
[1:18:16] your you counted yourself Unworthy of
[1:18:18] eternal life by rejecting the word oh
[1:18:22] God help us today God it don't matter it
[1:18:24] cut us to the to the very depth of our
[1:18:26] soul but GL it may take us to a point we
[1:18:29] we don't even we're scared to see what
[1:18:30] it'll do to us but it but we've got to
[1:18:33] accept it if it's the word of God it's
[1:18:36] not just a man saying but a word of God
[1:18:39] brought by as brought under the light of
[1:18:41] the message of hour we look at that and
[1:18:42] we think God let it be let it cut me if
[1:18:45] it has to cut me let it let it tear me
[1:18:46] up if it's got to tear me up why I've
[1:18:48] got to I've got to become that
[1:18:51] word and it's not up to me to well you
[1:18:53] say I wish I could live it
[1:18:55] but it's not up to me to live it it's up
[1:18:56] to him to live it through
[1:18:58] me amen I just have to surrender to it I
[1:19:03] can't I don't want to be taken I don't
[1:19:04] want to be count myself Unworthy of
[1:19:06] eternal
[1:19:10] life God help me
[1:19:12] today now listen he
[1:19:14] says he says until it comes that last
[1:19:16] Angel there's no certain mystery we read
[1:19:17] that the next quote he says he said if
[1:19:21] you want to read it there it is
[1:19:22] Revelations 101 to about 4 he said
[1:19:24] you'll get it he said see he takes the
[1:19:25] book and seals and breaks them and shows
[1:19:28] the seventh angel listen for this alone
[1:19:32] the mysteries of God is the ministry of
[1:19:36] the seventh
[1:19:37] angel it's not my Ministry it's the
[1:19:40] ministry of the seventh angel that that
[1:19:42] was his job notice he said the very day
[1:19:46] this is in the anointed on at end time
[1:19:47] when this messenger not when he starts
[1:19:49] but when he begins to declare his
[1:19:50] message I've read this to you before you
[1:19:52] probably heard it many times but listen
[1:19:53] to it in the light of this before and
[1:19:55] after the open book he says not when he
[1:19:57] starts on but when he begins to declare
[1:19:59] his message he said see the first pole
[1:20:02] healing second pole prophesying third
[1:20:04] poll the opening of the word the
[1:20:05] Mysteries revealed he said there's no
[1:20:07] more higher order to reveal the word
[1:20:09] than prophets but the only way the
[1:20:11] prophet can be Vindicated is by the
[1:20:14] word but people don't want to leave
[1:20:16] enough time for it to be
[1:20:18] Vindicated that's right there's some
[1:20:20] things that brother Brown said that
[1:20:22] there's some things we believe in this
[1:20:23] message won't be Vindicated until the w
[1:20:24] takes place but I still believe
[1:20:26] it right because when that change of the
[1:20:29] body comes he'll be Vindicated in all
[1:20:30] that he said until then you you can you
[1:20:34] can try to prove anybody wrong say Well
[1:20:35] it hasn't come to pass yet until we're
[1:20:37] there and we have perfect understanding
[1:20:38] we don't
[1:20:40] know right and he's a prophet speaking
[1:20:43] just like this word has been opened up
[1:20:44] to us and then there's things that he
[1:20:46] said he wasn't saying about himself he
[1:20:48] was saying in Prophecy now look he said
[1:20:50] no more there's no more higher order to
[1:20:51] reveal the word than prophets but the
[1:20:53] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[1:20:54] is by the the word he said and remember
[1:20:56] the third poll was the opening of them
[1:20:57] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth
[1:21:00] that's been sealed in the word he said
[1:21:03] do you see it now brother bram's
[1:21:05] identifying that as the third poll of
[1:21:07] his
[1:21:07] ministry right it's the way I read that
[1:21:11] he's he's identifying the third poll is
[1:21:12] his ministry is the opening of them
[1:21:13] Seven Seals to reveal the hidden
[1:21:15] truth now this message is absolutely
[1:21:18] necessary for the
[1:21:22] Rapture if you ever watch a movie left
[1:21:24] behind
[1:21:26] left behind anybody no one wants to
[1:21:27] admit to
[1:21:30] that got one hand back
[1:21:34] there I heard they redid it I but the
[1:21:37] old movie left behind and and they had
[1:21:40] the Rapture taking place and they were
[1:21:43] telling how many people went and they
[1:21:44] said oh hundreds of
[1:21:46] millions right and they had all of the
[1:21:48] children under a certain age would go
[1:21:49] and all the every everybody you know all
[1:21:52] the and so airplanes were crashing all
[1:21:53] over the place and that's what they had
[1:21:55] to start in the the beginning of the
[1:21:57] tribulation
[1:21:59] period
[1:22:01] but again God doesn't do things like
[1:22:04] that when he come the first time how
[1:22:06] many received
[1:22:08] it huh and Jesus said it'll be in a day
[1:22:10] and hour you don't even you don't even
[1:22:12] think you're not even thinking about it
[1:22:13] it'll be it'll be so secret and and
[1:22:16] it'll be a sudden secret going away of
[1:22:18] the church the bride is caught away in
[1:22:21] the middle of the night brother Brown
[1:22:22] said like Romeo and Juliet caught
[1:22:26] away and there'll be people missing
[1:22:28] there will be people who will know but
[1:22:30] not
[1:22:32] many in fact I'd say there'll be a lot
[1:22:34] of churches even around the message
[1:22:36] that'll keep going right and I and I
[1:22:39] don't say that just because I want to I
[1:22:41] I hope this one will be empty especially
[1:22:44] the pastor I think on that movie the
[1:22:46] pastor didn't go with the
[1:22:48] church that's kind of
[1:22:51] sad but you know I I I I hope we're
[1:22:55] we're all there but the truth is people
[1:22:57] go on and there'll be people who know
[1:22:59] about the message that won't
[1:23:01] go absolutely will be because there's
[1:23:04] millions that know about the
[1:23:05] message right but there won't be I I
[1:23:08] can't see where there'll be that many
[1:23:09] gold brother random uses an extreme
[1:23:10] example but he talks about 500 and now
[1:23:13] that that's not brother brandom is just
[1:23:15] giving us showing us it'll be small
[1:23:17] right what's small you could take those
[1:23:19] same figures brother Brown used during
[1:23:20] that day there was a billion Christians
[1:23:22] I think he said or 500 million in the
[1:23:23] world 500 million he said one in a
[1:23:25] million be 500 well there's way more
[1:23:26] people than that that call themselves
[1:23:27] Christians today so if you want to do
[1:23:30] Mathew you say well there's more and
[1:23:31] then you can say well how many true
[1:23:33] Christians I don't think there was 500
[1:23:35] million true Christians in that
[1:23:37] day but look at how Jesus did it in the
[1:23:40] first time now I've gone off on
[1:23:42] a Lord help me I hate it when preachers
[1:23:45] chase
[1:23:49] rabbits but you know we we look at this
[1:23:52] and we realize that there won't be that
[1:23:54] many It'll be such a but what what do we
[1:23:56] need what is necessary for that well
[1:23:59] this message is
[1:24:01] necessary right it's absolutely
[1:24:04] necessary for the
[1:24:06] Rapture and now there will be many
[1:24:09] saved there will be many that will the
[1:24:12] foolish version whoever that is whatever
[1:24:14] that is however you want to you want to
[1:24:17] put that in that's not my purpose today
[1:24:19] to preach on that but but it's the elect
[1:24:22] who recognized MDC
[1:24:25] not lot coming out of
[1:24:27] Sodom but the elect group amen
[1:24:31] recognized mesic and got the body
[1:24:34] change right and so there's some people
[1:24:36] that are magnetized to it by something
[1:24:38] what makes you magnetized to it amen now
[1:24:42] brother BR sister there's a great magnet
[1:24:44] sitting in the sky that God one day will
[1:24:47] touch his fingers to now he's you know
[1:24:49] it's a type it's an allegory it's not
[1:24:50] that you're literally going to raise up
[1:24:52] like a magnet
[1:24:54] but God one day will touch his fingers
[1:24:56] to the magnet no man knows the time he's
[1:24:59] coming not even the angels of heaven
[1:25:00] doesn't know God Alone knows but there's
[1:25:03] been some trimmings that's come off of
[1:25:04] the Bible Bible Christians Believers for
[1:25:08] this hour he said one of them might have
[1:25:11] been an axle back in another day this
[1:25:13] might be some other part it's going on
[1:25:14] to make the big regime of God but it'll
[1:25:16] be molded into the pot of God's Great
[1:25:18] Cupa and poured out again into the
[1:25:21] images of God I love this and just those
[1:25:25] who are magnetized to it will be taken
[1:25:27] up now what's magnet magnetization it's
[1:25:31] attraction all right something in the
[1:25:34] object beat that is magnetized to it is
[1:25:36] attracted to the magnet there's a
[1:25:39] material there somewhere that's
[1:25:40] attracted to the
[1:25:41] magnet it's attraction there's something
[1:25:43] there it can't help it
[1:25:45] amen amen it's attraction he said now oh
[1:25:50] he said what a privilege it is to know
[1:25:53] that there's something in the
[1:25:55] resurrection that's pertaining to
[1:25:58] us amen so not just the magnet out in
[1:26:01] the sky but a magnet in here something
[1:26:04] in here a material here that's
[1:26:05] magnetized to it he said we are we are
[1:26:08] magnetized to it now what does it do it
[1:26:10] draws
[1:26:11] us what is that that's his his claiming
[1:26:15] work of redemption now we are attracted
[1:26:19] to it now we are not only attracted to
[1:26:20] the
[1:26:21] messenger but to the word
[1:26:25] right this is important we are claimed
[1:26:27] by the word now and brother BR goes into
[1:26:31] this we had to be attracted by the
[1:26:32] messenger
[1:26:34] initially or we wouldn't believe the
[1:26:37] message but the attraction changes when
[1:26:40] we realize what he's
[1:26:42] saying I'm not saying this by myself
[1:26:44] brother Bram says this look brother
[1:26:46] brand says in choosing of a bride Christ
[1:26:48] does vindicate his word which attracts
[1:26:49] the people he does
[1:26:52] that we saw brother the random do things
[1:26:55] that only God could
[1:26:57] do God living in a man and so it God
[1:27:00] does vindicate his vindicates his word
[1:27:02] which attracts the people he said he
[1:27:03] don't attract the people at churches
[1:27:04] that are attracted by big denominations
[1:27:06] and big doings and big carry-ons and
[1:27:08] fancy
[1:27:09] things H aren't you glad for
[1:27:12] that fancy we tried to make it fancy
[1:27:15] around here sometimes we
[1:27:17] fail but we're still AR
[1:27:20] arens say it that way but the word of
[1:27:23] God attracts
[1:27:24] the bride of
[1:27:25] Christ I didn't say that he said that
[1:27:29] God speaking through his Prophet the
[1:27:30] word of God attracts the attention of
[1:27:33] God he said the word of God attracts the
[1:27:36] bride of Christ he said now notice it's
[1:27:37] interesting to notice how that the
[1:27:39] church tries to attract the attention of
[1:27:41] the People by fine robes and dressed
[1:27:43] choirs and bobbed haired women and
[1:27:44] painted
[1:27:45] faces and they think it sang like an
[1:27:48] angel lie like a devil run around all
[1:27:50] night to a dance like think nothing
[1:27:52] about it and that's what they think it's
[1:27:54] all right it's beautiful they're
[1:27:57] attracted to
[1:27:58] that huh why because the flesh is
[1:28:01] attracted to
[1:28:05] that people want a pastor who does
[1:28:07] whatever he wants to so they can be a
[1:28:08] people that do whatever they want
[1:28:10] to but if the pastor is bound to the
[1:28:12] word then the people are bound to the
[1:28:14] word are you with me and vice versa now
[1:28:17] but they they like lie like a devil run
[1:28:19] around all night to a dance like think
[1:28:20] nothing about it they think that's
[1:28:22] beautiful but you see that's false made
[1:28:24] that's not the word of God he said well
[1:28:26] the true bride I love this so we are
[1:28:29] attracted to him but he said the true
[1:28:31] bride attracts the attention of God by
[1:28:34] keeping his
[1:28:38] word you ever notice how a little girl
[1:28:41] she begins to like a guy a
[1:28:44] teenager many more years from my girls
[1:28:47] where they start doing this but they
[1:28:49] like a guy and they'll start dressing up
[1:28:51] real
[1:28:52] nice maybe put on a
[1:28:54] necklace fix that messy bun up just
[1:28:58] right other times they begin to act if
[1:29:00] it's the wrong kind of guy you know a
[1:29:01] lot of times they'll act the opposite
[1:29:03] they'll start getting rebellious and and
[1:29:05] speaking bad to their parents stuff like
[1:29:07] that well they're trying to attract
[1:29:08] someone's
[1:29:09] attention right and they get attention
[1:29:11] just as a side note they get attention
[1:29:13] from
[1:29:14] somewhere and and they're going to get
[1:29:16] it from somewhere if if we as dads don't
[1:29:18] give them the attention they deserve
[1:29:19] especially our girls they'll look for it
[1:29:22] somewhere they'll get
[1:29:24] attention because there's something in
[1:29:26] in in that female species something in
[1:29:28] their psyche they they want
[1:29:30] attention
[1:29:32] huh that's why your your wife will talk
[1:29:35] to you all the
[1:29:38] time she's trying to get your
[1:29:40] attention she she wants your attention
[1:29:42] she it's not that she's it's not
[1:29:44] necessarily about what she says because
[1:29:46] she's already told you that five
[1:29:48] times she wants your attention and I
[1:29:51] have to realize this sometimes because
[1:29:53] I'm a as much as I repeat myself
[1:29:55] preaching I don't like to hear things
[1:29:59] repeated if I heard it once that's
[1:30:01] enough and my wife would tell I get very
[1:30:03] frustrated on the phone or whatever
[1:30:05] somebody's talking to me I I don't like
[1:30:06] to hear things repeated I got it the
[1:30:08] first time I'm never going to remember
[1:30:10] it no matter how many times you repeat
[1:30:11] it to me but it's just my nature I'm
[1:30:13] ready to move on to something else let's
[1:30:16] talk about something else but but you
[1:30:18] talk about about women they're wanting
[1:30:21] that attention they're they're looking
[1:30:22] for attention from a man
[1:30:25] and and look the bride of Christ is
[1:30:27] looking for attention to attract his
[1:30:30] attention how do I attract his attention
[1:30:33] the true bride attracts the attention of
[1:30:35] God by keeping his
[1:30:37] word amen not by having the biggest
[1:30:40] church not by having the greatest
[1:30:41] preacher not by having all these nice
[1:30:42] things that we have that's not how we
[1:30:44] attract God's attention we attract his
[1:30:46] attention by keeping his word and He
[1:30:49] blesses us with his presence why because
[1:30:51] we're keeping the word
[1:30:54] how how did Esther attract the attention
[1:30:56] of the king all the other girls they got
[1:30:58] all doled up and ready and here come
[1:31:00] Esther and she said whatever you tell me
[1:31:01] to put on that's what I'll put on the
[1:31:04] king's unic who knew what the king liked
[1:31:07] amen he knew what the king liked the
[1:31:09] king servant knew what the king liked
[1:31:11] and so he told her put this on put that
[1:31:13] on and she went before the king and
[1:31:14] exactly what he told her don't you
[1:31:16] realize that's the way we attract the
[1:31:17] attention of God Amen
[1:31:24] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:31:25] brother brandham love the title of that
[1:31:28] sermon brother brandham preaches that
[1:31:31] what is the attraction on the mountain
[1:31:32] it's not a very long sermon go and
[1:31:34] listen to it
[1:31:35] sometime the BR says one day an ordinary
[1:31:37] young man about 30 years old walked down
[1:31:40] and was baptized and when this man come
[1:31:43] he said there was such an attraction by
[1:31:46] the
[1:31:46] prophet in other words the prophet was
[1:31:49] attracting the attention of the people
[1:31:51] right there was such an attraction by
[1:31:53] the prophet
[1:31:55] he said the prophet acts strange that
[1:31:59] day he said and the congregation
[1:32:01] couldn't help from watching the action
[1:32:05] of that
[1:32:07] Prophet you saw it you think this is
[1:32:10] different here's a man who preaches what
[1:32:13] the word says here's a man who's
[1:32:16] different see all the other great men of
[1:32:17] that day they had great big robes and
[1:32:19] fine churches and here come John out of
[1:32:21] the wilderness
[1:32:24] he acted
[1:32:25] different different than everybody else
[1:32:27] did all the other Pentecostals got out
[1:32:30] there and and screamed and hollered and
[1:32:32] tried to cast out devils and here come a
[1:32:34] man with
[1:32:36] authority he was different and it
[1:32:39] attracted the attention of the
[1:32:41] people just it's the way he acted L he
[1:32:44] said when he was debating with the
[1:32:45] priests across the river they said God
[1:32:47] built this altar God told us to do this
[1:32:49] Moses is the prophet We Believe Moses
[1:32:51] the sacrifice will never be done away
[1:32:53] with they had word bible for that but
[1:32:56] they didn't understand it wasn't
[1:32:58] revealed to them and I can hear John
[1:33:00] answer back and said have you not read
[1:33:02] in the scriptures now notice what he
[1:33:04] begins to do he begins to tell him who
[1:33:05] he
[1:33:06] is have you not read in the scriptures
[1:33:08] what Daniel the Prophet said the daily
[1:33:10] sacrifice will be done away with and
[1:33:12] that hour has
[1:33:14] arrived amen he stood there as the
[1:33:17] Manifest the word that day he said this
[1:33:18] is that that hour has arrived the daily
[1:33:21] sacrifice will be done away with have
[1:33:22] you not read what is Isaiah said in the
[1:33:24] 40th chapter the voice of one crying in
[1:33:25] the wilderness prepare the way of the
[1:33:28] Lord how many times do we hear Brother
[1:33:30] Brown say something similar to that talk
[1:33:32] about what happened on the river talk
[1:33:33] about what happened in his own Ministry
[1:33:35] he's doing the same thing John
[1:33:37] did and the people were attracted to
[1:33:40] that he said there's two prophecies for
[1:33:42] me there is two prophecies for me so
[1:33:44] he's showing the prophecies in Scripture
[1:33:45] that pertain to his own Ministry John's
[1:33:47] Ministry he said another thing did not
[1:33:49] you recognize our Prophet 400 years ago
[1:33:52] Malachi when he spoke in the third
[1:33:54] chapter amen and he
[1:33:58] said he said behold I sent my messenger
[1:34:00] before my face to prepare the way don't
[1:34:03] you know this fulfills prophecy prophecy
[1:34:06] was being
[1:34:09] fulfilled notice he's attracting the
[1:34:11] attention of the people the first pole
[1:34:13] and the second pole and all the things
[1:34:15] in his ministry he's attracting he's
[1:34:16] different than what the world was he's
[1:34:19] different he's attracting the attention
[1:34:20] of the people and about that time the
[1:34:22] prophet turned
[1:34:24] and said behold there comes the Lamb of
[1:34:29] God the prophet turned in his ministry
[1:34:32] and said behold there comes the Lamb of
[1:34:34] God that takes away the sin of the
[1:34:37] World Church he
[1:34:40] turned amen now what's the attraction I
[1:34:44] didn't say this this brother bram's
[1:34:45] words now what's the attraction it
[1:34:47] changed from the prophet to his prophecy
[1:34:53] people would tell you every little thing
[1:34:54] that John done and that's wonderful that
[1:34:56] was part of the attraction but he turned
[1:34:58] said behold the
[1:35:02] word
[1:35:04] amen people can't see the prophet turn
[1:35:07] that's why they they can't understand
[1:35:09] the message of the hour God help us to
[1:35:11] see it today he said look how the
[1:35:14] atmosphere look how the atmosphere of
[1:35:16] Heaven changed after John saw the lamb
[1:35:18] take the book let's look at that for a
[1:35:19] moment before we
[1:35:21] close Revelation 51 and I saw the right
[1:35:23] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:35:25] book written within and on the backside
[1:35:26] seal with Seven Seals I saw a strong
[1:35:29] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who
[1:35:31] is worthy to open the book and to loose
[1:35:33] the seals thereof and no man in Heaven
[1:35:35] Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was
[1:35:36] able to open the book neither to look
[1:35:37] there on and I wept much because no man
[1:35:40] was found worthy to open and to read the
[1:35:42] book neither to look there on and one of
[1:35:44] the elders saith unto me weep not Behold
[1:35:47] The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[1:35:50] of David have
[1:35:51] prevailed amen he's conquered he's
[1:35:54] prevailed he's overcome to open the book
[1:35:56] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[1:35:59] I beheld and low in the midst of the
[1:36:01] Throne of the four beasts and in the
[1:36:02] midst of the elders stood a lamb as it
[1:36:04] had been slain having seven horns and
[1:36:06] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[1:36:08] of God sent forth into all the Earth and
[1:36:10] he came and took the book out of the
[1:36:12] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:36:14] throne notice how everything everybody's
[1:36:17] holding their breath everybody's
[1:36:18] wondering what's going to happen he came
[1:36:20] and take the book took the book out of
[1:36:22] the right hand of him that said on the
[1:36:23] throne and when he had taken the book
[1:36:26] notice when he had taken the book Things
[1:36:29] begin to
[1:36:30] change the four beasts and the 4 and20
[1:36:32] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:36:35] every one of them Harps and golden vows
[1:36:37] full of odors which are the prayers of
[1:36:40] saints amen what what was that praying
[1:36:42] for brother Bram told us he said it's
[1:36:43] for a
[1:36:44] resurrection they were praying for a
[1:36:47] resurrection amen what happened it
[1:36:51] changed before there was a hope of a
[1:36:53] resurrection now there was a reality of
[1:36:56] a
[1:36:57] resurrection amen can you see where I
[1:37:00] was Tak you with the Shout with
[1:37:01] brother's message all these things what
[1:37:02] was it doing it was bringing into a
[1:37:05] reality it was manifesting the word so
[1:37:07] we could see because there's going to be
[1:37:08] some hard times there's going to be some
[1:37:10] tough some trouble this bride this bride
[1:37:12] is going to be attacked on every side
[1:37:13] but we've been shown by God that there's
[1:37:15] something real about the
[1:37:18] Rapture
[1:37:20] amen not just a hope but a reality
[1:37:24] thank you
[1:37:25] Lord they sung a new
[1:37:28] song How Art Worthy to take the book to
[1:37:31] open the seals thereof for thou was
[1:37:33] slain and has redeemed us to God by thy
[1:37:35] blood out of every Kindred and tongue
[1:37:36] and people and nation has made us under
[1:37:39] our God Kings and Priests we shall reign
[1:37:41] on the earth and I beheld and I heard
[1:37:43] the voice of many angels round about the
[1:37:46] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[1:37:47] the number of them was 10,000 time
[1:37:49] 10,000 and thousands of thousands
[1:37:52] there's going to be some body in
[1:37:54] heaven there's already Heaven is already
[1:37:56] popul you don't have to worry about it
[1:37:57] being
[1:38:00] empty God already has it popular he
[1:38:02] knows every spot to fill notice sang
[1:38:06] with a loud voice sing with what kind of
[1:38:08] a voice loud
[1:38:11] voice amen a loud voice why because it'
[1:38:16] been just a hope you know in reality
[1:38:19] boil it down all your life what what's
[1:38:21] the greatest hope in your life
[1:38:24] well you look and say well it's to get
[1:38:25] married or to have a good job or to be
[1:38:27] able to retire with money what's the
[1:38:29] greatest hope of your life the farther
[1:38:32] along you go the more of your friends
[1:38:33] that pass
[1:38:35] away it's a
[1:38:37] resurrection it has to
[1:38:41] be and I stood by Graves I stood by
[1:38:43] different kinds of
[1:38:45] Graves and done funeral services for
[1:38:47] people that and some that you you just
[1:38:49] didn't know and you prayed for God's
[1:38:51] mercy
[1:38:54] there's others I Stood Beside their
[1:38:55] grave and I've always read that the
[1:38:58] scripture at the grave in 1
[1:38:59] Thessalonians
[1:39:01] 4 he talks about the Rapture and the
[1:39:03] resurrection I've all read that the
[1:39:05] graves that Comfort one another with
[1:39:06] these words because that's the greatest
[1:39:08] hope that I
[1:39:10] have I can't put hope in politics
[1:39:12] where's that going to take me you put
[1:39:14] all your hope in politics you end up
[1:39:16] like that guy that put the horns on his
[1:39:17] head and invaded the capital the other
[1:39:20] day you put all your hope in politics
[1:39:23] you end like these people out riding in
[1:39:25] the streets and stealing stuff from the
[1:39:26] stores they put their hopes in men and
[1:39:28] in politics in this life that's that's
[1:39:31] the the the horror of Communism is it
[1:39:33] puts all people's eggs in one basket it
[1:39:35] puts all their hope in this
[1:39:38] life all their hope in this life and
[1:39:40] then creates a horrible
[1:39:43] life but we don't have hope only in this
[1:39:45] life if God forbid this nation would
[1:39:48] become a communist Nation we would still
[1:39:50] have hope right if everything would fall
[1:39:53] around us if everybody would follow
[1:39:55] around us we'd still have hope brother
[1:39:56] the Joe why because we know that we have
[1:39:59] that promise but not only a hope we've
[1:40:01] seen it
[1:40:03] begin so when I lay someone away today
[1:40:06] I'm not just looking at what the promise
[1:40:10] was in 1 Thessalonians 4 but when he
[1:40:12] said he'll descend from heaven with a
[1:40:15] shout amen I can say he's already done
[1:40:20] it you realize how powerful that is
[1:40:24] he's already proved his word to be
[1:40:28] true oh
[1:40:30] my oh
[1:40:32] my he's he's done that as he's
[1:40:34] descending and there will come a time a
[1:40:36] sweep will go over it's a change of the
[1:40:38] body but what is it we can now we're on
[1:40:41] the other side of the open book we can
[1:40:43] say with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb
[1:40:46] that was slain to receive power and
[1:40:47] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[1:40:49] and glory and blessing he said and every
[1:40:52] creature which is in heaven and on the
[1:40:54] earth and under the Earth and such as
[1:40:55] are in the sea and all that are in them
[1:40:57] heard I saying blessing and honor and
[1:40:59] glory and power be unto him the sth upon
[1:41:01] the throne and unto the lamb forever and
[1:41:04] ever and the four Beast said amen and
[1:41:06] the four and 20 Elders fell down and
[1:41:08] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[1:41:11] ever why what had been a prophecy now
[1:41:14] become reality listen what brother Bram
[1:41:16] says I'm closing in just a moment he
[1:41:18] said now this is the time when
[1:41:20] everything must be worshiped
[1:41:24] oh you say well you worship too much we
[1:41:26] shouldn't worship that much the word's
[1:41:27] here yes the word is here but the word
[1:41:29] brings the worship when the word is open
[1:41:31] that's why you can worship at the end of
[1:41:33] the service that's why you can you can
[1:41:34] just worship God why because the word is
[1:41:36] not just something that's being repeated
[1:41:38] from thousands of years ago but it's a
[1:41:40] living reality it's something that's
[1:41:42] manifested itself in our day and it
[1:41:44] didn't just manifest itself in a prophet
[1:41:46] but that same quickening power that
[1:41:47] manifested itself in a prophet also is
[1:41:50] manifested in our lives otherwise how
[1:41:53] can we live today we'd go with all the
[1:41:55] other denominational ages we'd slide a
[1:41:57] backslide just like the world but we
[1:41:59] live today by the life of Jesus Christ
[1:42:02] we live today because this is the hour
[1:42:04] that the book has been open and this is
[1:42:06] the time when everything must be
[1:42:08] worshiped he said he said now remember
[1:42:11] and you can say well everything is
[1:42:13] worshiped today but he said everything
[1:42:15] must be
[1:42:16] worshiped
[1:42:18] amen amen go to work and I worship I go
[1:42:21] to you go to school and you worship
[1:42:23] wherever you go everything must be
[1:42:25] worshiped he said now remember how
[1:42:27] appropriate he said now don't let us
[1:42:29] miss this now listen close when all the
[1:42:32] mysteries of the church age was finished
[1:42:34] when all the mysteries of the plans of
[1:42:36] redemption them Seven Seals was open
[1:42:38] right immediately after this now look he
[1:42:42] he said it's time for all everything in
[1:42:44] heaven and everything on Earth that
[1:42:46] includes us brother the S includes me
[1:42:50] everything in heaven and everything on
[1:42:52] Earth
[1:42:53] to worship
[1:42:55] God now watch what takes place he said
[1:42:57] listen just listen at this just a minute
[1:43:00] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[1:43:01] Worthy listen what a worship it was the
[1:43:04] elders the Beast everything fell right
[1:43:05] before him like that when he made his
[1:43:07] complete plan amen it's time of worship
[1:43:13] now thank you
[1:43:16] Lord Psalms 30 and8 we'll go down to
[1:43:20] verse 10 I put verse eight let's go down
[1:43:22] to verse 10
[1:43:24] he said here oh Lord and have mercy upon
[1:43:25] me Lord be thou my helper thou has
[1:43:27] turned for me my morning into dancing
[1:43:31] that's what he did for John amen thou
[1:43:34] has turned my mour into dancing thou has
[1:43:37] put off my sackcloth GED me with
[1:43:39] gladness to the end that my glory may
[1:43:41] sing praise to thee not be silent oh
[1:43:43] Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee

[1:44:15] brother B says talk about a happy time
[1:44:16] musicians go ahead and come talk about a
[1:44:19] happy time when them seals broke John
[1:44:21] must have looked in and seen them past
[1:44:22] the curtain of time
[1:44:23] and said there is John oh he said he was
[1:44:26] so happy till he said everything in
[1:44:27] heaven brother brandom kind of makes a
[1:44:29] play on words and turns it around he
[1:44:30] said everything in heaven he must have
[1:44:32] really cried out didn't he everything in
[1:44:33] heaven everything in the earth
[1:44:34] everything beneath the Earth every
[1:44:36] creature everything else heard me saying
[1:44:38] amen blessings and glory and wisdom and
[1:44:40] power and might riches belongs to him he
[1:44:43] said why when the Revelation come that
[1:44:46] the lamb the Redeemer our Kinsman had
[1:44:50] come back from the Throne of mediatorial
[1:44:52] and had walked out here to take his
[1:44:58] possession it changes you it changes the
[1:45:02] atmosphere and you
[1:45:04] recognize the Revelation
[1:45:07] comes what I was bound to in my body I
[1:45:13] had to die this body is dust ashes to
[1:45:15] ashes and dust to dust but I'm not going
[1:45:18] to stay in that
[1:45:20] condition why because I have a
[1:45:22] revelation
[1:45:23] amen the same one that John did when he
[1:45:27] rejoiced amen what's the Revelation that
[1:45:29] the mediator has left his mediator work
[1:45:32] and walked out to take his
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:37] possession
[1:45:39] church this message has made the
[1:45:41] resurrection a
[1:45:43] reality I can say when I lay my loved
[1:45:45] ones in the grave God forbid that some
[1:45:48] of you would go by way of the Grave if I
[1:45:49] would go by way of the Grave we can say
[1:45:52] not only do we hope for Resurrection
[1:45:54] someday but the process has already
[1:45:56] started even before we laid them in the
[1:45:58] ground they're coming
[1:46:00] up amen there must be some who sleep but
[1:46:05] there must also be some who will be
[1:46:06] alive and remain I want to be one of
[1:46:08] those we've seen the evidence of that
[1:46:11] we've seen the
[1:46:12] sign we've seen the sign I had some more
[1:46:15] quotes on that but I won't read them
[1:46:17] this morning but brother BR talks about
[1:46:19] how after 2,000 years we still see Jesus
[1:46:22] Christ standing what was it in the power
[1:46:24] of his resurrection he said a wicked and
[1:46:26] adulterous generation seeks after a sign
[1:46:28] but there will be no sign given to him
[1:46:30] except for the sign of the
[1:46:33] Resurrection amen and why did he show us
[1:46:35] the sign of the Resurrection in a
[1:46:37] prophet but what does that show us that
[1:46:39] we who are alive and remain we'll be the
[1:46:43] ones it's already taken place you can't
[1:46:46] stop it the devil can't stop it it's
[1:46:49] already in motion it's already rolling
[1:46:52] down the hill
[1:46:53] it's already taken place and we can be
[1:46:56] like the ones on the road to emus Their
[1:46:58] Eyes Were were holding they couldn't see
[1:47:00] Jesus and they walked with him and he he
[1:47:02] began to reveal to them the word he be
[1:47:04] to show them who he was he began to show
[1:47:07] him that Plan of Redemption all the way
[1:47:08] through the scripture and he began to
[1:47:10] talk to him and show him how how
[1:47:11] everything happened and he finally but
[1:47:14] they don't recognize it yet just dead
[1:47:18] L amen but they finally get to a place
[1:47:22] the evening
[1:47:24] time where he does something that only
[1:47:28] he can
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:31] do are you realizing today do you
[1:47:34] recognize he's done that in this
[1:47:37] hour see
[1:47:40] I it's a dangerous time church because
[1:47:43] there's complacency comes because you in
[1:47:45] your mind you're saying I've heard this
[1:47:47] before but it's no less
[1:47:50] real but it's Satan that works Works
[1:47:53] through time to try to take you away try
[1:47:55] to make you complacent try to let that
[1:47:57] fire dim down in your heart oh God if
[1:48:00] there's a fire in my heart let it not be
[1:48:02] because somebody played music real fast
[1:48:04] or everybody was excited but let it be
[1:48:06] because of your word I know the book's
[1:48:08] been open for me I know I'm a part of it
[1:48:11] I know where I belong and you did
[1:48:13] something in this age that only you
[1:48:14] could
[1:48:15] do amen you did something you showed
[1:48:19] yourself through a prophet that only you
[1:48:20] could do and you came in my life and you
[1:48:22] did things that only you could do can
[1:48:24] you testify of that today you did
[1:48:26] something in my life that only you could
[1:48:28] do Lord only you could do it I know what
[1:48:30] I would be without his grace I know what
[1:48:32] I would be without his Mercy I hope you
[1:48:35] hear me this morning church I know what
[1:48:37] I would be without this message of the
[1:48:38] hour this message is not just a man this
[1:48:41] message is Jesus Christ revealed to us
[1:48:44] in this hour and he is the same
[1:48:46] yesterday today and forever the word
[1:48:48] made manifest dwelling Among Us brother
[1:48:51] Brown say how we should thank God for
[1:48:53] his great
[1:48:54] sign
[1:48:56] amen hallelujah do you believe it this
[1:49:00] morning heyen let's just talk to him a
[1:49:03] moment I can keep preaching I could keep
[1:49:06] preaching for a long time but I thank
[1:49:08] you got it this morning I think you you
[1:49:11] understand we have more than just a hope
[1:49:13] we have a reality before the open book
[1:49:17] it was different there was
[1:49:17] denominational ages but now
[1:49:19] denominational ages have
[1:49:21] ceased you're living in a different time
[1:49:25] living in a time of worship how we
[1:49:28] should thank God for this maybe your
[1:49:31] eyes have been
[1:49:33] clouded by the things of life and from
[1:49:36] this message and this this great thing
[1:49:38] that God has done in the show but you
[1:49:39] see people more and more over the years
[1:49:41] you see people get disgruntled with it
[1:49:43] and kind of back away from it not be as
[1:49:46] excited about it as they once were you
[1:49:49] preach the word and I believe the word
[1:49:50] is preached in a greater measure today
[1:49:52] cuz all these years he's been just
[1:49:53] revealing himself to us revealing
[1:49:55] himself to us we see the word preached
[1:49:57] in a greater measure today because then
[1:49:59] we have the words of a prophet we're
[1:50:00] able to study we're able to look at it
[1:50:01] the Holy Spirit speaks those words and
[1:50:03] it's preached to us not not me but but
[1:50:05] in a great measure through all of God's
[1:50:07] Ministry and yet we see ourselves
[1:50:09] falling back and falling back why
[1:50:11] because many times we let Satan Cloud
[1:50:13] our eyes our eyes are beholden but if we
[1:50:15] could just let him see only he could do
[1:50:17] it if we could just let him enter our
[1:50:19] hearts today we just invite him in and
[1:50:21] say Lord I know only you can do that in
[1:50:23] my
[1:50:24] life begin to worship God again thank
[1:50:27] him for what he's done thank God there's
[1:50:29] great sign in this day Heavenly Father
[1:50:32] Lord I pray even for myself every one of
[1:50:34] us your Prophet made a great admission
[1:50:37] at the end of his ministry even himself
[1:50:39] when he couldn't have church like he
[1:50:40] wanted to and that he didn't have a
[1:50:43] church home there in Tucson that even he
[1:50:45] himself he said we we get cold we
[1:50:48] backslide he talked about how in his own
[1:50:50] Spirit how that he gotten away from God
[1:50:53] and into that fervency not to be a
[1:50:56] sinner but just that fervency oh God you
[1:50:59] help every one of us to hunger and
[1:51:01] thirst for that today Lord may we
[1:51:03] recognize what you've done in this hour
[1:51:06] may we realize that there's a time of
[1:51:08] worship not because a preacher pumped us
[1:51:10] up into it or or a song leader or
[1:51:12] somebody else but because the book has
[1:51:15] been open we're on the we're standing on
[1:51:17] the other side of the chasm Redemption
[1:51:19] has been the process of the fullness of
[1:51:22] redemption as been completed in our hour
[1:51:24] we're so thankful for that we see Lord
[1:51:27] not only your death burial and
[1:51:28] Resurrection not only your birth but
[1:51:29] also your coming as you descend Lord the
[1:51:33] clouds and we thank you for that I pray
[1:51:36] God that you would move in our midst
[1:51:39] Lord bring a a fire in the middle of us
[1:51:42] Lord in the midst of our beings that
[1:51:44] would just consume us Lord with your
[1:51:47] word until all the little petty things
[1:51:50] would fall away we know that you were
[1:51:53] real and that only you could do that in
[1:51:55] our lives Grant it father we pray I pray
