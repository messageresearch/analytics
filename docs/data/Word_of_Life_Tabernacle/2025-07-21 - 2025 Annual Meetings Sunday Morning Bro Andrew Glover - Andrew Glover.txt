Heavenly Father, we are so grateful in our hearts that we can call you father. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord Jesus for all that you have given us, Lord. And Father God, we know Lord that in this journey of life there's many trials and there's many valleys. Lord, you never said that we wouldn't have afflictions, that we wouldn't have trials, that we wouldn't suffer. But Lord, you did say that you'd never leave us, nor would you forsake us. &gt;&gt; And you said, Lord, that you would be our healer and our deliverer and our sustainer. So Lord, we look to you this morning for these needs, dear God, that's written down. Lord, it's someone's loved one that's suffering. But I pray, Lord, at the anointing that raised my Lord, from the grave, may that anointing move upon each knee. Dear God, we pray, Lord, even before the service is over. May they call in or say, "I was sick, but I'm well. I was burdened, but I've been released." Lord, we ask you for big things because we believe you're a big God. &gt;&gt; Lord, we pray that you would come one more time in these services. Dear God, as you've done this week, speak to the hearts of your people, Lord, and anoint our hearts to receive. Thank you, dear God, for this church and this labor and for all that they've done to minister to your bride. We ask your blessings upon them as we commit these things into your hands for your glory.

I believe we are rising up. &gt;&gt; I like it on present tense. Don't you? Yes, sir. A sister in my church texted me and she said, "Brother Bo, would you please share this testimony at the meeting?" So, she was stricken with breast cancer and the doctor removed the surgeon removed the cancer and she went through six months of horror of chemotherapy. So, long story short, every year she goes for an MRI to see if it's returned. So, on July the 4th, Brother Andrew and Brother Josh Martin held a prayer line in our church and she got in it and she went for the MRI on July the 7th and everything come out clean. &gt;&gt; She said, "Maybe this could help someone." &gt;&gt; Oh, I still believe in prayer lines, don't you?

[Music] Okay. &gt;&gt; How nice have to be in the house with the Lord this morning? &gt;&gt; I know. I sure am. I'm I'm trying to be real good. Usually I my people get on me. You talk too much. So I'm I'm trying to hold it in there. Hold. But I will say one of my brothers told me, he's like, "Man, Sam, the only reason you got a teaching is you got a captive audience. They can't get away." So that's that's true story. So the word, I mean, I'm just thrilled to be here in the house of the Lord with you all and thrilled to play the Lord together with you. I tried actually not to sing this song, but it it kept coming back in different ways. So, I thought, well, I guess we'll we'll try it again here. And we're in Bflat. This is this is about the bride and who we are. And I think that's one thing we've heard over and over again this weekend. Uh it's who we are. Faith, it's who we are. Healing, it's who we are. Praise is who we are because it's who our father is. &gt;&gt; We're our father's children. Anyway, anyway, don't give it. This is a war song. It's not for peace. It's a song of violence. Out in the streets, rulers of darkness, they're rising up. This bride is here to meet them. Our time is come and this bride is speaking. Words of the sun. Revelation's power. Soul of our tongue. And this world is fine. And I feel it sweet down in my hands, down in my feet. Let it burn, let it roll. Now this war won't rage on. I won't give in. I won't let go. Until the breaking of the dark sword of sphere, this sh these weapons I've got. I'm on the front lines, marching forward. I am a child of God and I'm marching. I'm marching home. Children sorrow. I hear them we lost in the darkness looking for peace. Set me on fire. Just let me turn until the whole world sees children's hearts are turned. Your bleed inside your broken heart and broke my chains. Shout out my tongue from my source of strength to my source of hope. The Jesus Christ of great warrior I know. Let it burn. Let it roll. Let him for age. I won't let go. I won't give in till I'm breaking of the dark sword of fear. The shield of faith weapons I've got. I'm on the front line marching forward. I held it and I'm marching. [Music] I'm marching home. I'm maring on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I'm marching on. Hallelujah. [Music] I'm marching on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I'm marching on. [Music] I'm maring on. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. [Music] Their [Music] heads were low. Their steps were slow. As they walked along that long may road, then a man appeared. And as he drew near, he said, "Why are you so sad? Are things really that bad?" They said, "Sir, have you not heard? [Music] You must be a stranger in this town. For the one who came in the father's name, he has been cut down. They laid his body in the ground. As they walked and talked, he began to explain about this Jesus and why he came. He opened the scriptures and began to teach. The preacher of preachers, he began to preach. In the wilderness, the children had nothing there to eat. With mana from heaven fell down at their feet, but they were dry and thirsty. In a foreign lamb, living water came forth. Out of a rock in the sand, when the three Hebrew children were thrown in the flames, a fourth man appeared, nominus, [Music] to say, it was me. Oh, it was me. I am the one who back there on Calvary. It was me. [Music] Who do you think hung the stars in the sky? Who do you think made the day and the night? Who made the flowers? Who made the trees? Who made the sun and the moon in the seas? Who gives life to all who believe? Who do you think made the blind to see? And who made the very air that you breathe? Who defeated death and won the victory. It was me. Oh, it was me. I am the one who died for you on Calvary. It was me. Who do you think was the voice in the tree? Who do you think told the prophet to speak? Who created worlds and paint the storms to cease? And who drove Hady's voice right down to their knees? Tell me, who do you think brought you here today? Who's coming back to take your road someday? And who left his throne to fellowship with you, to make himself known to me of you? It was me. [Music] Oh, it's me. I am the one you left back there on Calvary. It was me. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; It was me. [Applause] Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Kobe, Sister Mary, come on.

Brother Kobe was singing just a few sitting here worshiping and and the presence of the Lord just fell and and they were just sitting there worshiping in that presence. I thought, what a what a blessing that is. &gt;&gt; We we shouldn't take that for granted. We've got a little bit of time here today. We're not going to rush and it's the last service, but if you have a need today, God can meet that need. &gt;&gt; He's here. &gt;&gt; He promised he would be with us. You may be going through something this morning. You don't see a way out. But he said where there is no way, he'd make a way. &gt;&gt; We believe that today. God bless you, Brother Windle, as you sing. And then, Brother Andrew, if you'd come, just Are you glad to have Brother Andrew Glover with us this morning? Amen. So happy to have our friend, our brother with us. God bless you forever to come. &gt;&gt; It has truly been good to to be here and uh &gt;&gt; you know a meeting like this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for leadership. &gt;&gt; How many appreciates brother Ben? Amen. We appreciate brother Ben and and um the deacons, trustees, those that are are working with him to make this possible and and truly I believe the Lord will there'll be many rewards on the other side. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been requested I sing this. It's been a it's been a while since I've sung it. I've been many places. I've seen many faces as I've gone. I've seen the ruins that used to burn with fire all night long. [Music] I've cried as I've looked upon shattered dreams and broken homes. Ashes of the flames that used to be. But now I'm looking through a different light. There's a fire that still can burn so bright. There's an apple of hope burning through. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's a flame [Music] burning in the night. There's a fire every right. There's a bright coming in tonight. There is a flame burning in the night. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] You may feel your fire's grown dim. Your chances are so slim and gone. Come on. And you get the fire to go when good then someone throws in a law. Whoa. But there must be to every flame that will grow in his great name a chunk of wood that seems to put it out. And God has put it in our life. Though it seems we won't survive. That our flame may grow in his might. [Music] There's a flame burning in the night. There's a fire kitchen [Music] There's a bride coming in my There is a flame burning in the [Music] There is a flame burning in the night. The hair is flying burning in the night.

Everything we've been through, everything the enemy's tried to use to take us out. Amen. The flame of the love of God is still burning in our hearts this morning. I don't know about you, but I love him more this morning than I've ever loved him before. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I remember when I first got saved and some of y'all remember that you didn't think you can love the Lord any more than you did that moment. But Amen. what he done for you and now you start looking back over all the things he's done and all the things he's brought you through and you're standing in his presence this morning. And Amen. I'll say this to you. There's nothing you can do to change the love of God. Amen. We want to say God bless you all this morning. And it is a a real honor to be here. We bring you greetings from our home church there, Grace Tabernacle. Brother Matt uh Morris is our pastor there and he wanted me to extend greetings to you for him.

I'm thankful we serve the same God that if he's in Tennessee or if he's in Arkansas or Oklahoma, Virginia, Arizona, wherever, he's the same God. And amen. We we want to say it is an honor to be here. And I I know there's a few folks here from the church this morning. God bless you all for being here. And appreciate your support today. And brother Ben, we do thank you. I don't know where he slipped off to, but we we thank brother Ben for his hospitality. And uh I don't think it could have been said any better than what brother Wendell said. Amen. All this is possible because of leadership. And amen. We we thank the Lord for the man of God to surrender his heart to the Lord and to be led of God. Amen. To have these meetings and to host this weekend.

Just every one of them a special relationship. Brother Wendell, Brother Daryl. Amen. Brother Josh. And just sure appreciate their stand for this message. Amen. How many appreciates the men of God and their stand for this message? Amen. It's not getting easier to stand, folks. Amen. But but there's some men of God that are standing and we sure appreciate them and of course all the ministering brothers here. God bless you all and amen your ministries and your stand for this word. And amen. This morning we have a few things here on our heart. We pray be a blessing to you. But before we open the word, let's just bow our hearts before him today. Amen. I don't think we've gathered here for just another service. I don't think we've gathered here for just another gathering or a final service. But I believe we've gathered here for the Lord to speak to us this morning. Now let's approach him. Heavenly Father, Lord, as we gather here this morning, we are indeed grateful to be here this morning. Lord, any opportunity that we get in your presence and to be with believers of like precious faith. And Lord, to fellowship around the revealed word of this hour, it's always a blessing, Lord. It's always a privilege. And Lord, it seems as if we plan a long time for these moments and look forward to them. And then Lord, so quickly they go by. And Lord, I'm so thankful this morning that there's a great eternal meeting coming. Lord, where time will not hinder it. There'll be no tiredness. There'll be no limitations. But Lord, we'll just be in your presence forever. Lord, we'll never have to part. We'll never Lord, no any fear or any pain or any sorrow. Lord, we're looking forward to that day. And Lord, while we have these opportunities, Lord, we pray you come by our way this morning. Lord, you see the needs of your children. Father, how your word is just come in such power and demonstration here this weekend, Lord. A laserg guided sermon, every service, Lord, to the needs of our hearts, Lord. Father, I know you've done mighty things here this weekend, Lord. I know you've done great things and marvelous things. And this morning, I pray, Lord, that you would give us the grace in your word that these things that have been done, Lord, would be fed. Lord, may the power of God move among us this morning in a special way. Lord, I bind the hand of Satan. I bind the hand of the enemy in any way that he would try to come into these meetings. Satan, you are defeated in the name of Jesus this morning. Now Lord, if there be anyone here with their needs unmet, I pray this morning, God, you would help me, Lord, to get myself out of the way, that you could come and you could speak to hearts and lives, that you could you could transform lives here this morning by the preaching of your word. Now, Father, we surrender into thy faithful hands, have your way among us, forgive us of our failures, forgive us of our shortcomings, and draw us closer unto thyself. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And all the believers says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. And amen. God bless you this morning. If you have your Bibles, while you're standing, we want to go to the book of Numbers, the 16th chapter. Amen. Do want to say it is an honor to be here with brother Ben Beard and his family and the church from Galina. God bless you all and all those represented from there. Amen. Just uh I was sitting over there last the other night in one of the services and I got to thinking, brother Wendle is like a family reunion. Amen. When all the believers get together, Amen. We we sure sure thank the Lord for these opportunities. And Amen. I I do want to say it's a real special honor to have our friend, Brother Thomas, here with us, a young man of God, that he's giving his heart to the Lord and preaching this message. And Amen. We appreciate these young men raising up and preaching this word. And amen, I've I've had the privilege of traveling with him a little bit and being together and fellowshipping. And I tell you, this young man loves this message. And amen, he's g us give his heart to study it. We we say God bless you. May the Lord use you in a special way. Amen. The book of numbers the 16th chapter and then the third verse of number 16. The Bible here says and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. Now that's two people you don't want to gather yourself against. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; and said unto them, Ye too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy. Every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Now, wherefore then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord? How many knows that was false accusations? &gt;&gt; You lift yourself up above the congregations of the Lord. Now, watch watch what an effect this had. And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. When Moses heard these accusations, it so it done something to him that he just fell upon his face. Now also want to go in the New Testament in the book of Ephesians the fourth chapter. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians the fourth chapter. I have been studying and praying for these meetings and had other things on my heart and this morning just what I was going to preach. The inspiration left me and uh the Lord just settled this on my heart and amen I I struggled with it and wrestled with it and I finally told him I said Lord you know best. I'll surrender to you. And amen. Ephesians chapter 4. Those of you all from the church there at home you have to forgive me. You've heard this before, but Amen. then just help me the same. Amen. Ephesians chapter 4 and verse number 17. Paul here writing, he says, "This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them." Now watch this. because of the blindness of their heart. Who being, now look what he says, who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness. But ye have not so learned Christ. If so be that ye have heard of him, how many's heard of him? &gt;&gt; Amen. and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put off concerning the former conversation of the old man &gt;&gt; which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust. Now watch what he says. And be renewed in the spirit of your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. We're for putting away lying, speaking every man truth with his neighbor. Wouldn't that Wouldn't that just fix a lot of problems? &gt;&gt; Amen. Speaking truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. &gt;&gt; Amen. We ask the Lord this morning to bless the reading of his word. As you can have your seat here this morning, I I want to uh just to take a few moments here and if I would if I would title this today, I want to speak to you on this. Lose not the feeling of and for the people. Lose not the feeling of and for the people. You know, after a meeting like this, I can I wonder with a show of hands how many can testify you've got a fresh feeling. Amen. There's just a a freshness over your heart. There's a freshness over your mind. I'll say this. The devil will do everything he can, amen, to see that that fresh feeling does not remain, Amen. in your heart and in your spirit and in your home and in your churches and in your family. Amen. The devil will do everything he can to see, amen, that what has become fresh will become stale. Now, amen. I believe that if we've, how many's had an experience with God here this weekend? I believe if we've had an experience with God, Amen. then we must feed that experience. And the prophet of God would say, "Eagles only live meat." Amen. They're vulture. They don't eat a carrying like the vulture. He said, "But a real eagle kills his own meat. He has to have it fresh." Amen. Amen. Like the grizzly bear and the black bear is a scavenger. He eats carryon. But the grizzly bear, he has to kill fresh night. Amen. Or when he's going to eat, he eats. Brother Ram said, "And so is the eagle." He said, "An eagle gets fresh meat. He don't want anything that's stale or anything that's left over or handme-downs." Amen. He wants to get his own meat. Amen. Amen. I think it's a powerful thing that the prophet of God, amen, does not liken us to stale Christians, amen, or animals that can live on stale experiences, amen, but rather he likens us unto eagles, amen, that have to live on the freshness of the word of God. You know, as the as the Lord just inspired this thought to my heart some time ago, I was listening to this tape and brother said, "An unchangeable God." He said, "What we want is born again Christians." Amen. with salvation in their heart and the power of the Holy Ghost in there. Amen. To love one another and and to stretch out. Now listen, and to have feelings for one another. Amen. Glorious feelings, hopes of feelings. Amen. And brotherly affections that binds us together. Amen. That's what God wants us to have. Amen. I don't know about you, but when I hear a prophet tell us something, Amen. that God wants us to have, Amen. It ignites something in my heart. Amen. To pursue the thing that God is desiring us to have. And I love what the prophet of God said. He said, "That's what we need today." Amen. Is a church that we wouldn't be ashamed for anyone to come into. Amen. It is perfectly governed by the Holy Spirit. There is no fanaticism. There is no starchy. Amen. It's just a good warm church and it's filled with God's spirit. Amen. Watch that good solid gospel teaching pastor. Amen. That's what we have need. Amen. and God help us to have it. Amen. God wants us to have it. Now, amen. You all have to agree with me that there's a big difference in what we want and what God wants. Amen. Amen. I know some that want a formal church and a starchy church and amen, a fundamental church. And I know some that want a fanatical church and a amen. But I don't want what they want and I don't want what I want. Amen. But rather, I want what God wants. And and the prophet of God said, "God wants us to have faith." Amen. Amen. Unbelief won't destroy his plans. I I know the devil wants us to have unbelief. Amen. The devil wants us to have doubt, but God, Amen, wants us to have faith. And And I, as I begin to think upon this, I I begin to realize that you all, you all know we preach a lot against feelings. Amen. Amen. We preach a lot against serving God by feelings. And Amen. being led by feelings. And Amen. judging our experience by feelings. Amen. But I want to show you something. Amen. We're not preaching against having feelings though. Amen. We're preaching against the leadership of the soul. Amen. Being the sense of feeling. But we are not preaching against the sense of feeling. Amen. Being in the soul towards one another. Amen. I find it amazing that it is important. Amen. To have feelings. Brother Bram's down there in Mexico. Amen. And there's an older man come up in the prayer line. Remember? Amen. He didn't have no shoes on. Amen. His hat was torn off. His clothes was ragged. He said, "I put my arm around him." He said, "He was somebody's daddy. He was almost naked." Maybe, amen. And worked many days to raise some little child. He said he was blind. Amen. I tried to give him my suit or I tried to give him my shoes. He said, "I realized nothing I had would fit him." He said, "Now I put my arm around him and I thought, poor old fella." He said, "You know, you have to enter into the suffering of the person." Amen. To have feelings for them. If it ever, now listen to a prophet. If it ever gets to a place that I cannot feel sorry for the sick, Amen. then it's time for me to leave the platform. Amen. And quit praying for them. He didn't say if it ever gets to the time that I can't preach Isaiah 55 or 53 like anybody else. Or if I can't if I can't preach a good sermon on divine healing, amen, like anybody else. He said, "If it ever gets to the place that I cannot enter into the feeling, Amen, it's time for me to leave the pull pit." He said, "It's when I get to a place that I cannot feel the burden of sin on the people. Then it's time for me to get away from here because I could never do no good for God. It's the feeling you have to have for the people." You know, it's a love that you can project to the people that they know you love them and they love you and you can feel it. Amen. And there's something that happens then. See, and when I was praying for the old fella, he said a vision came and he had his head laying over on my shoulder and he was patting me when I was praying. Now listen, he could not understand what I was saying because he could not speak English. Amen. I want y'all to get this. He could not understand, Amen. the words of the prayer, but he could feel the feeling that was behind the prayer. He could not understand what a prophet was saying, but he could feel the feeling that was behind what he was saying. And I say this morning, oh God, give us a church. And if somebody comes in and they don't know who Brother Brandham is, and they don't know what the seventh seal is, and they don't know what the third bull is, they can hear a preacher preaching and say, "I may not understand what he's talking about, but there's some feeling behind what he's saying. There's some enthusiasm behind what he's preaching because he's not there, amen, for his own reputation. He's not there for his own kingdom. He's there that the power of God might come into the church of God and move in power and authority. Hey, I believe it. I believe it's time, amen, to quit trying to get all our all our educations right and Amen. Get all our cliches right. Amen. And get some feeling back in our preaching. Amen. Get some feeling back in our singing. Get some feeling back in our Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. I say this, behind everything, there's a spirit. And the prophet of God said the church was put here for a purpose. He said there's a spirit behind this church. He said there's a spirit behind your home. He said behind everything there's a spirit, a motive and an objective. Behind everything there is a spirit there's a motive and an objective. Amen. He said see the church comes here amen to to exalt some human system or something then its motives is not right. But if it's put here, amen, to try to achieve something for the kingdom of God, then the motive and the objective, amen, is right. If the motives is directed that way, amen. I want to say this, amen, behind every ministry, there is a spirit, there is a motive, and there is an objective. And I know we got a lot of young men setting out, amen, to preach this message. Amen. I tell you what you need before you need an iPad and before you need a MacBook and before you need a computer and before you need a new suit, you need the right spirit and the right motive and the right objective. Amen. It ain't about who can out preach who and who can out quote who. It's about who, Amen. can lose themselves in the presence of God and become a vessel that the Holy Ghost can move into and bless somebody through. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's brother Mson. Can't you see America? Amen. has fell for the glamour and the goddess. Amen. It's paid the devil in the realm of flesh. Amen. Making a way for the devil to present himself. He said, "I hope you understand this. Stay clear from it. I don't care how many DDs and PhDs or whatever is behind it. It's a lie." Amen. Brother, don't leave no room for the devil, folks. He said, "See, we're prone, Amen, to go after the gift." Amen. Instead of the giver. He said when you see signs and wonders take place, Amen. Don't you notice the sign so much? Amen. But look at what's behind it. Amen. It's still small voice that speaks. He said that's the reason that we can't have revivals in America is because people go after gifts instead of the giver. Amen. Now, brother said many people are following signs. It isn't the sign. Amen. It's the voice that is with the sign. Amen. Man has gifts and things. Amen. But watch what's behind it. Amen. Satan can impersonate anything. He can impersonate. But what kind of voice, Amen, is behind the sign. He said, "Oh, take a person walk up." Amen. Big what they can do and all this thing. Amen. Don't you pay no attention to that. Amen. God's spirit is a meek spirit. It's a humble spirit. It's full of love and compassion. And it's looking to all people. Amen. Bringing all people to a knowledge of Christ. Amen. I'll just say this. Amen. We don't just want to do something. Amen. We want there to be something behind what we're doing. &gt;&gt; Can you agree? Amen. We don't just want to have meetings. Amen. Let there be something behind the meetings. Amen. We don't just want to sing songs. Amen. Let there be something behind the songs. Amen. We don't want to just preach sermons. Amen. Let there be something behind the sermon. Oh, God. Amen. We don't just want to, Amen. just have youth meetings. Let there be something behind it. The prophet of God said, "Amen. There's nothing in a man or woman that can be desired." Amen. It's what's in behind there. Amen. There's nothing in Andrew Glover that any of you all should desire in my flesh, but it's what's behind the flesh. Amen. There's nothing in Brother Daryl or Brother Windler or Brother Josh or any other preacher that we should desire, amen, in the flesh. But there should be something behind the flesh that everyone ought to be desiring. And it shouldn't be the way they talk or the way they sing. It ought to be the way they project the love of God as an instrument in the hand of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it. I'll say this. Amen. We put our eyes on the wrong things, folks. We put our goals on the wrong things. And we've left off somewhere that it ain't about who's who. It's about who's here. It ain't about I'm here or you're here. It's about Jesus Christ. The son of God is right here in this building this morning to help the needs of his people. &gt;&gt; I don't care what he used to be. Now, come on. Amen. Amen. I just got to say it. Amen. Amen. Some people get the greatest blessings from preachers and they don't have a clue what their background was. Amen. But can I tell you why? Because it's not what they used to be. It's what's behind there now. Amen. The skin blinds the people. He said, "I remember that woman used to be this or that man used to be that." He said, "The skins that was once on the badger, but it's now hiding the glory of God. It's got God housed behind it. It was an old animal. It was an old animal, but now it is housing the glory of God. And so, can your skin be changed?" Amen. to be made a housing place for God. Listen, God dwelling in humility. Somebody say, "Why aren't you arrogant?" I tell you why I'm not arrogant. Amen. Is because I know where I come from and I know where I should have been. And I know the grace of God chose this old patch of skin. Amen. To transform me by the water and the blood and the spirit. This ain't about Andrew Glover's kid. It ain't about any other preacher's kid. It's about the revelation that the glory of God has come into the flesh of his people. Come on. Amen. Amen. Quit letting the devil talk you out of the testimony. Quit letting the devil talk you out. Amen. Of being what God's called you to be because one time you was a drunk. One time you was this and one time you was that. I know what I used to be. Amen. But I ain't what I used to be. And thank God there's a grace that can transform me into what God ordained me to be. Yes, sir. Amen. I'm talking about the power of God restoring the feeling of God in the church of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll just go ahead and get it out there. Amen. People will never care how much you know until they know how much you care. &gt;&gt; Well, we might as well preach. &gt;&gt; People will never care how much you know until they know how much you care. Amen. I I'm going to borrow something from brother Daryl. He told me one time when I I just started out preaching. He we were discussing something. He told me he said, "But Andrew," he said, "here was a brother preaching and he went and preached a meeting and I followed him the next weekend and he said, "I knew the brother, knew how he preached and he said, I went in there and I said, man, y'all probably had a good meeting cuz brother so and so was here last weekend and they looked, Brother Daryl, remember that?" They looked at Brother Daryl and they said, "Well, brother, he done a really good job, but we didn't understand anything he was saying." &gt;&gt; You realize that guy today ain't even serving God. &gt;&gt; He's out in the world somewhere. Amen. Because it's not about how much you know, it's about how much do you care. &gt;&gt; Jude said, "Some have compassion and they make a difference." Brother Ram said, "Look, people don't know what compassion is." He said, "Compassion and love is the will of God." And you can only exercise that as God gives it. It's not human emotional passion. It's not emotional love, but it's divine love, which can only be rendered and given by God. So, if a man ain't met God, he don't know what to give God's people. But if he's met God, he's become a channel of communication between God and his people to deliver the things of God to their heart. Amen. I'll say this there. There's a big difference in human compassion, folks. Amen. And divine compassion. The prophet of God said, "Real divine compassion is to do the will of him that sent you to do it." Now, let me just ask you this. Amen. Who sent you to do what you're doing? &gt;&gt; Who sent you to do what you're doing? Amen. Who sent you into this age to overcome the god of this evil age? I'll tell you who sent you was the Lord Jesus Christ. Reverend said the people are so bound. Amen. They don't understand heavenly things. He said we don't see. Amen. Compassion is to do the will of God. &gt;&gt; Compassion is to do the will of God. Now, how many will agree that Jesus was a God man? Amen. Amen. He was a God man, right? He was God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said this, he was a man full of the compassion of God. Ain't that something? Amen. In John chapter 5, Jesus, he walks by the pool of Bethesda and there's multitudes of sick there, but he goes by the lame and the hauled and the withered and the blind and he goes to a little man who's had a trouble. Brotherson, could have been a prostate trouble for about 38 years and he said, "Look what he done." Amen. He healed him and said, "Rise up and take your bed." And the others sat there. He said now back then they said the same thing they say now that God is not a loving God and God don't care said no he came to do one thing and that was the will of God for the people and then Jesus came for one purpose that was to do the will of God for the people of God. Oh can I say this to you this morning when I speak of this the people I want I want to say this to you I'm talking about you. I'm talking about the people of God. I want to say this. I don't think Amen. that you're just the you're just the Oh, God. Can I preach? I don't think you're just the just the outcast or just Amen. talk to you any kind of way and preach to you any kind Amen. I think you're very important people because my prophet said, Amen. If I had two drops of the literal blood of Jesus in a charger, he said, what would I do with it? He said, "But tonight I have before me in the sight of the Lord." Amen. A greater price than the two drops of the literal blood of our Lord. I have the purchase of his blood. His people that he gave his blood that his people might live. Brother said he could think more of the people than he did of his own life. He gave his life that his people could live. So, I hold this my audience tonight in the greatest respects because it's the purchase of the blood of the Lord. I'm just going to preach here for a second. Amen. I don't think that ought to just be for the preacher. Amen. Approaching the congregation. I think that ought to be for the congregation approaching the congregation beside them. That these are not just crazy people you go to church with. These are not just fanatics. These are not just people that are that are religious people. This is the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ. This is the most powerful force of people on the face of the earth that you're sitting next to. &gt;&gt; Amen, man. He said, "How close I must be to tell you exactly the truth." Because God will make me answer for it at the day of judgment more than if I took the blood, the literal blood, and threw it on the ground. But Chris, he said it would be a greater penalty to mislead the people. the purchase of his blood than it would be to throw the blood from the charger that I had in it. &gt;&gt; God cares more about you knowing truth than he cared about his own blood being in a literal charger. There is a greater penalty to mislead a child of God than there is to pour the blood upon the ground. Oh, I'll say this. We ought to take recompense this morning and say, "Dear God, Amen. Don't ever let me get so cold. Don't ever let me get so hard that I can't recognize that I'm not talking to just another piece of humanity. I'm talking, amen, to the queen of heaven itself. &gt;&gt; In this age we're living, you Amen. Y'all forgive me. I'm I'm under a burden. I'm just preaching this morning. In this age we're living in. Amen. It's easy to lose the feeling. It's easy to lose the feeling for the people. It's easy to lose the feeling of the people. But I want to say this morning, amen, we must fight, amen, to keep the feeling. We must fight, amen, to keep the channels open. We must fight, amen, to stay in constant fellowship. &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm telling the truth because the devil's doing everything he can to make it a stale church and a starchy church and a fanatical church and a cold church. But I want to tell that devil this morning, he has had his way long enough. This is not just another people and I'm not just another preacher. We are the bride of Jesus Christ and we refuse to let the devil steal from us what God gave us. If he gave you the Holy Ghost, you ought to fight to keep the freshness of the Holy Ghost. If he gave you victory over sin, you ought to fight to keep the victory over sin. If he gave you joy in the place of sorrow, you ought to fight to keep the joy. If he gave you peace in the place of confusion, you ought to lay down and let the devil take your peace. You ought to draw your sword as a son of God, as a daughter of God, and fight back against the thief. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. God done too much in these meetings to just let it be another meeting on the books. &gt;&gt; God done too much. Amen. I might as well preach out here. God's done too much in your churches. He's done too much in your lives. He's done too much in your families. He's done too much in your ministry just to become another statistic on a church roster somewhere. I say fight for the freshness of the Holy Ghost. I say fight for the liberty of the power of God in the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It ain't worth weighing down. It's worth fighting for. &gt;&gt; It ain't worth weighing down. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It ain't worth just walking away and say, "Well, I went through the prayer line and I felt good last night and I feel worse this morning." Get up, Job, and fight for your healing. &gt;&gt; Well, I went through the prayer line last night and they laid their hands on me and I I felt the presence of God. I wish I could feel it again. You can, but you got to fight for it because the devil is doing everything he can that you cannot feel what God wants you to feel. &gt;&gt; Stands there in 1963 and preaches what I believe is a key sermon in the ministry of the seventh angel. And he calls it standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; But what he does is I'm going to show you how that Moses and Jesus and Paul. Now he don't say this, but he says it, brother Kobe, and myself all had ministries of standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; Now I don't want to get too far out there in this, but I want to say the bride has a ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's a ministry of standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; Can I tell you what it is? It's the gap between the Leodysian age and the rapture of the church, which is what we call the bride age. And the devil's done everything he can, amen, to take that away from the church because he knows where the mercy seat is in this hour. Brother said the mercy seat is in the heart of the bride. So, Brother Bam shows you that standing in the gap is not something that is easy to do. I actually took time and looked up, Amen. the the phrase standing in the gap. You know what it is? It's an idiom most often used in a religious context, which is meaning to intercede for someone. Amen. Often in prayer by taking on their burden. Amen. So, you got burdens. Brother Allen and I got burdens. Brother David, you got burdens. And brother Stewart, you got burdens. And Amen. I don't, brother Ben. I'm just going to preach if that's okay. Amen. This whole entire congregation of word of life has burdens. Amen. But can I tell you something else? Ben Puit has burdens and he has burdens for his family has burdens for his life. Amen. But as a pastor, he is standing in the gap and he can't just bear his burdens and sister Britney's burdens and his baby's burdens, but he's got to bear your burdens. And it's real easy when you're bearing another person's burden. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; to get wore out. Now you all know what I'm talking about. Fathers, &gt;&gt; bearing burdens. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not saying I'm not saying Ben's wore out. No, I know you just turned 40, buddy. &gt;&gt; But but but you got to realize this is not just playing church. &gt;&gt; See, when you're bearing bird and you're acting, now listen to this. You're acting as a protective force on their behalf. It signifies a person who sees judgment coming. But brother Kenny, they step in to advert the judgment that's coming. It means to intercede for those in danger or plead for repentance. Now that phrase standing in the gap originated in Ezekiel 22:30 when the Bible says, "I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it, but I found none." You realize that chapter closes by asking who will stand in the gap? Amen. To intercede for Jerusalem. Amen. Highlighting the abn the absence of anyone willing to take a stand against the prevailing wickedness. I want to say this and I want to say it with everything within me. If you got a pastor, a man of God who's got a backbone and not a panty waist and is willing to stand in the gap for your family and stand in the gap for your babies, you ought to stand behind that man. He's not just there to preach you a sermon. He's a protective force between you and the judgment that's on its way to your house. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand in the gap. I'll say it. Amen. And and and and you all forgive me. Amen. Amen. But I God, I just picked it up. I think we ought to get past the days of second-guessing everything the man of God says. I think we ought to get past the days of having the preacher for lunch on the way to the restaurant on Sunday. I think we ought to get past the days and say, "God, I don't want to lose the feeling of God. I don't want to lose the one who you placed to stand in the gap." &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand in the gap, in my opinion, is probably one of the most transparent messages that we have of a prophet on tape. Come on, folks. He didn't run somewhere and hide when he was going through his problem. He come to a pullpit &gt;&gt; and he stood on a platform and recorded his problem and sent it around the world. &gt;&gt; Now, now what he said is, I think if it is this okay, &gt;&gt; he said, I think if it be the will of God, I would like to kindly brief you on things that's happened. And he goes to number 16 and he begins to show how that David and Kora has interfered with the commission of Moses. Now what he was showing them is God was going to kill them and he was going to start a whole new generation unless someone stood in the gap. Remember said if God was going to liquidate the church, the people and there was a time when God had gotten tired of fooling with our sin. We constantly going wrong. Who would stand like Moses for the people? Amen. Moses was not standing for himself, church. He was standing for the people. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now Moses in act was in every way substituting. He was a type of Jesus Christ." Now, can I tell you what Jesus Christ was? He was our burdenbearer. Let's take it a step higher than just brother Ben bearing his burdens in the churches. Let's go up to the savior of mankind. When he knelt there in the garden, brother Josh and he prayed and he said, "Father, if it be thy will, let this cup pass from me." Brother said, "The entire burden of the world was resting upon those shoulders." He said, "And today, he took our sins to Calvary." Come on. We didn't have to go to Calvary. He went there for us. He took our sins to Calvary. You know what else he done? He took them to hell. Hallelujah. He took our sins to Calvary and then he took him to hell so we don't have to go there. And God raised him up on the third day for a propitiation of our sins. And today he is the only mediator between God and man. He said if the love of God ever strikes your heart in the tenderness of Jesus Christ, you would be so in love with him that the world would be dead as your sin. That's how you know you have the Holy Spirit. Not because you can scream, not because you can shout, not because you can speak in tongues, but when sin becomes dead and you become alive in Jesus Christ. Oh love of God, how rich. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, the love of God. Amen. Oh, the love of God. How rich. Thank you, buddy. How poor. How rich. Sorry, it's not poor. How rich the blood of God. How rich the promises of God. Oh, love of God. How rich and how pure. Amen. I think about how we're living in Revelation 3 in the Leodysian church age. You know what this age is? It's poor. &gt;&gt; It's miserable. It's wretched. It's naked and blind. Re said, "Here's the worst part about it and don't know it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if a man was in this condition and you could tell him his condition, he would try to help himself if he was mentally right. But when he's in that condition and you can't tell him any different, he just don't believe he's naked. He don't believe he's in that shape, then it shows here that he is blind. Now watch a prophet. He said, "Now I'm preaching to myself." Now, can I just preach this morning? &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm preaching to myself. Could we stand and see a human being that's blind, physically blind, and know that he's walking over a cliff?" And he said, "Could we in our stall state of mind that we're in this morning, could we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff and not try to warn him?" It would be there would be so cruel. We would be so indifferent in our heart. Could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he can almost laugh and see a blind man that cannot see, that cannot help himself, and deliberately let him walk over a cliff. He said that would be a bad thing to do. Amen. Nothing about it. Amen. Now, can I say something to you? Amen. A stall state of mind is a very dangerous place to get to. Amen. When you get a stall state of mind, look what a stall state of mind refers to. It's a mental or emotional state where someone feels stuck. Amen. They're unable to move forward or make progress towards their goals. It's a feeling of being in a rut where motivation and creativity and productivity are hindered. So when someone gets in a stall state of mind, amen, they didn't get there by themselves. Amen. But something happened to them and it put them in that condition and they lose their ability to move forward. Amen. Can I preach to you? Because I've seen it. I've seen people go through things. Amen. and get in a stall state of mind and waste 5 years and 10 years and 20 years of their life. Amen. Because of something that happened, Amen. 5 years ago and 10 years ago. But can I tell you what it's time to do? It's time to let it go and get the creativity and the progression of the Holy Ghost back in your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. I've seen I've seen preachers go through things. Amen. And for five and 10 years, they live in this rut and and everything's negative and everything's bad and everything's poor pitiful. But somewhere or another, you've got to realize this is more than about you. It's more than about me. It's about a people. And God has called us to be preachers. Amen. And I say this, I salute every one of these men of God because they've come to the pullpit and they preached healing to you when they were bleeding. They preached healing to you and the power of God to fix things when they were broken. I say, "Oh God, let it move out of the poop pits and let it move into the pews that we can back the word of God even when we're hurting. We can back the word of God even when we're bleeding on the inside because there's a feeling of divine compassion that is moved into our souls. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Stall state of mind. &gt;&gt; It's a dangerous place, brother Ben. It's a dangerous place for a father to get." Amen. Hear me this morning. Amen. And it ain't just going to affect you. It'll affect that wife. It'll affect them babies. It'll affect them grandb babies. It'll affect generations somewhere or another. You've got to get in the presence of God. And let the power of God shake you out of that spiritual amnesia and remind you who you are. &gt;&gt; You're not a defeated person. You're a son of God. You're a daughter of God. Yeah, there was a mistake. Yeah, there was a failure. But if you forgot there's a blood. And if there's a blood, then there's a chance for a second chance. &gt;&gt; Get up. Get up in Jesus name. Get up out of that stall state of mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. You got somewhere to go. &gt;&gt; Come on. You got somewhere to go. Your name is on the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to preach. That's okay. Your name is on the lamb's book of life. And according to the prophet I study, there's nothing you can do to take your name off the lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Preach it now. &gt;&gt; A stall state of mind. Now, I know I know when people get in stall states of mind cuz church attendance gets &gt;&gt; stalled. &gt;&gt; I may never be asked to close a meeting again after this, but I'm going to preach what's on my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise gets stalled. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enthusiasm gets stalled. Watch a prophet of God. He said, "Now, I'm going to make a confession to you." My I'm going to read this to you. Well, my brethren world over, I want to make this confession. I humbly say it. That just been what I was doing or fixing to do. I had been preaching for years and I become an old man and an old veteran preacher and I had a lot of hard battles and maybe I'm scarred. I'm all cut up on the inside from fights. Now listen to this. Because my lot the Lord gave me was not to kiss the babies and to marry the young and to bury the old, but it was to hold a twohanded sword at the battlefront. Amen. Against the ws of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of God till I can see the enemy defeated. Listen, he says, I've been cut deep many times. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. Here's a prophet. He's not in sin. He's not running women. He's not gambling at the casino. Amen. He's not down at the bar. Amen. He's in the pull pit and he's doing what God called him to do. He's doing what God anointed him to do and he gets hurt and he gets cut. Amen. I'm just going to preach my heart to you this morning. Amen. He said, "Listen," and I thought this, "If this people that call themselves Christians, if they don't want to listen to the message and I'm preaching, then let them alone. I'll just stop it all together and I'll go up into the mountains. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that's what a a preacher said. Amen. But I tell you what, sometimes we say, "Amen. Well, if this is the way it's going to be, I'll just stay home. If this is the way it's going to be, if there ain't no love in the church, huh, I'll just go home." Amen. Well, why don't you put some love in the church? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you change the situation? If you're so spiritual, I guess it's the evangelist coming out. If you're so spiritual, Amen. Why don't you change the atmosphere? If you're an amateur god and you're a messiah and you're a creator, amen, then exercise your authority to do more than speak cancer out of existence, but use it to change the atmosphere in your home and in your churches. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. Amen. It's time to quit just letting every excuse take us out of the house of God and back us in a corner in a stalled state of mind. It's time to shake ourselves and remember who we are and remember why we're here. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We ain't here for just a shout hallelujah time and a picnic. We're here to defeat demons. We're here to get blood on our sword. We're here to overcome 200,000,000 demons that have released themselves from the river Euphrates. &gt;&gt; But I'll just go be a hunter and I'll just go be a trapper and I'll just go be a woodsman and I'll just go fish. You know what the prophet of God called that? He called that a selfish attitude. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Woo. God have mercy. &gt;&gt; A selfish attitude. &gt;&gt; Now, that was a preacher. But what about our selfish attitude? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Preacher, preach a little correction on Sunday morning. I'll show him. I won't show up on Sunday night. And if I do show up next Sunday, I'll sit on him. Well, bless God, honey. You're going to be in for a bumpy ride because you ain't going to stop what God has ordained. You ain't going to find what the Holy Ghost has put his seal of approval upon. This ain't just a church. This ain't just a people. This is the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ. And all the authority that was in that blood is in every member who is underneath that blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I tell you this morning, folks, it's time to say, Lord, Amen. I don't want my ways. I want your ways. Amen. I don't want my thoughts because your thoughts are higher than my thoughts. &gt;&gt; Now, I might as well just get it out there cuz there ain't a one of us sitting in this building that hadn't battled a selfish attitude. &gt;&gt; Somewhere, &gt;&gt; brother David, just me and you, buddy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Harvey, me and you, buddy. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God bless you, sis. Come on with &gt;&gt; everyone battling it. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we care more about ourselves sometimes. &gt;&gt; But said, "Here I am. I'm just going to leave. I'm just going to I'm just going to go up in the mountains." Remember said, "Look," he said, "but I'm sitting in a restaurant." And he said, "While I'm sitting there," he said, "I made up my mind. I'm running out of time." He said, "I made up my mind." He said, "I I was just going to go be a real man. You know, I was just going to go up in the mountains. I was going to hunt. I was going to fish. I was going to trap. He said, "And I was just going to be done with all this." He said, "And I went in there and here come a big woodsman." Now, amen. Can I tell you the dangerous thing about getting in a stall state of mind is the devil will put things in front of you to interpret what you can be if you remain in that condition. And the devil forgets that he don't have the power to bring to pass the false interpretation of your life he's trying to hand you. He handed brother Brandham a woodsman and he come remember he said he come in there at brother Chris he let out a big sneeze and he said it was not a little shoe it was a big coui and he said I looked at Billy Paul and I said that's a real man he said that's the man I'll be he said that's what I and listen what he says he says that's what I'll be in the future but here's the problem he did not have the power to control his future because Jesus Christ is every believer's future. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what I'll be." He said, "But then the Lord," Now, I'm telling y'all something. The Lord begin to deal with him and I can raise my hand and say, "Thank God. After I've had my selfish attitudes and I've had my agendas and my plans and what I'll be and where I'll go and what I'll do and how I'll quit preaching and how I'll just be this, then all of a sudden the Lord begins to deal with my heart and the Lord begins to show me, boy, you don't have the power to bring to pass what you think you do. But you got to surrender to me. Hallelujah. You got to surrender to me because I'm the only one who has the power to control your future. If you try to control it, Brilliant Brandon, here's what you're going to be. You're going to be like your brother-in-law, Fletcher Roy, without his wife and a drunk without enough money to buy a cup of coffee. &gt;&gt; I'll carry out your plans. He said, "Carry out your plans and you'll be like that." &gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and tell you. Amen. carry out your plans and you'll be like every wretched, miserable, blind, naked, lay out of sin. &gt;&gt; But there was a seed inside of him and he said, "Lord, I don't want to be like that. I don't want to be like that. I want to be something different. I told you you called me to be a prophet. I want to live in the wilderness like a prophet." But now listen. But I was using my own excuse so I could hunt. &gt;&gt; Come on now. see my own good. &gt;&gt; I don't want to preach. I I don't want to be up here holding the sword. I'm tired of getting deep cuts. I'm tired of praying. I'm tired of getting wore out and you preach against sin and you go back the next year and there's more makeup on the faces and there's more pits on the women and there's more cut hair. I don't want to do it no more, God. You preach against this and preach against that and they make fun of you. I just want to go be a prophet and come out in television and go back in the woods. But William Brandom, that was not what you was born to be. &gt;&gt; And bride of Jesus Christ, you was not born to be a casual lukewarm half-living Christian. You were not born to be a Leodysa. You were born to be a son of God, but daughter of God with dominion over every devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then he gets in that spot. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And the Lord comes by &gt;&gt; and the Lord shows him how he got here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know how he got here? You forgot the feeling. &gt;&gt; I know I'm sweating. Let me &gt;&gt; Kenny, let me wipe my eyes. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; You forgot the feeling of your people. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Am I reading that right? &gt;&gt; You forgot the call &gt;&gt; that I called you to. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You forgot that I'm your alpha. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm your omega. &gt;&gt; You forgot I'm the one that saved you. You forgot I'm the one that started you. You forgot I'm the one that gave you the Holy Ghost. You forgot I'm the one that gave you that wife. You're the one. You forgot I'm the one that gave you them babies. You forgot I'm the one that gave you that ministry because you got hurt. Now &gt;&gt; I'm this I'm I'm this far into it. I might as well go on. &gt;&gt; And because of the hurt, he said, I begin to build a complex. &gt;&gt; Now watch what he said. I let the sick lay. I want the the same man that brought Georgia Carter out of the bed by the power of God. The same man that brought Upshaw out of the wheelchair after 66 years by the power of God said, "I let the sick lay. I want the Lord to tell me where to go and not to. I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message. And God forbid that I'll try to compare my life of now like Moses. But it's exactly [Music] &gt;&gt; what Moses did. &gt;&gt; The people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them. So he just left him alone and went in the wilderness. But he God turned him around. Let me put my shouting shoes on. When he forgot the needs and when he got so hurt that he just turned to walk away. Sorry, Joe. Amen. I got to quit doing that. And God turned him around. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I tell you why I'm shouting is cuz this is a house full of people that we've ever been. We've everyone been there and we've ever been on our way and doing our own thing. But it's been God who is rich in mercy. Brother, brother, brother, brother, brother, sister, sister, sister. But God, rich in mercy, come down with his mighty hand. And he turned us around and he said, "Forget the hurts and forget the cuts and forget the complexes and forget the false accusations and forget the game sayings and remember I am the Lord and I called you and I predestinated you and I ordained you, Esther, &gt;&gt; for a time such as this." &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm going to go ahead and bust that devil square in the face. &gt;&gt; That okay, Roth. &gt;&gt; Sincere people &gt;&gt; can get hurt. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And make mistakes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "I want to bring this to you so that you would see and show you the mistake a man can make." Yet being sincere. See, Moses lost the feeling of his people &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't listen to him. &gt;&gt; True. Now folks, I'm studying this and I'm sitting in my office doing more praying than I am studying. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I'm saying Lord, how many times I'm just preaching &gt;&gt; have we got the spot and said, "Well, bless God. If they won't hear me, I'll just preach it anyhow." &gt;&gt; Do you do you realize that's losing the feeling? &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; Brother Roy, you see your dream? I cannot go with a ministry like that until I feel different in my heart about it. No. Now, now folks, &gt;&gt; no matter if God did tell me there's got to be a change. I want to tell you this weekend, there's been a change. &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this weekend, I want to tell you that prayer line last night, it was not just another prayer line. Some of you all couldn't even get in the prayer line because you got about right here and the anointing like to swept you off your feet. You know why? Because it was not just another prayer line. It was not just another time you were going to walk through the former preachers. It was a change. It was a revealing. It was a refreshing. It was a renewing. It was a revival in your soul to pull you out of the complex, to pull you out of the situation. And remember who put you where you are. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it as plain as I know how. If a man starts you, a man can stop you. &gt;&gt; But if God starts you, it'll take God to stop you. &gt;&gt; Well, I've had him tell me, "Do this and do that and you're finished." Well, listen here. You didn't start me, so you can't finish me. But my Bible says, "He is my alpha, and he is my omega, and he is my beginning, and he is my ending. And you may have a destination for me, but he has an expected end. And you don't have the power to put another believer in their destination. It takes God to put them in their expected end. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm opening up my heart to you from a prophet of God. &gt;&gt; He said they ought heard my message. I don't have the feeling for the people I should. Until I get that feeling, there's no need in me going cuz I'd just be a hypocrite. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Miguel, I'm sweating bad, but am I reading this right? &gt;&gt; I be &gt;&gt; a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now I'm turning the corner. I'm going to preach here. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; All these years I've tried to serve him with a true heart. And I won't grare and be a hypocrite. Now watch. He said, "I got to feel it." &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm calling them Ricky's and Ricettas." &gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere with this folks. &gt;&gt; I'm calling them this bunch. &gt;&gt; But it's God's children that's in bondage &gt;&gt; and I must go to them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's like somebody getting in jail and calling you to get them out and you making fun of them for being in jail. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I ought to use a different illustration, Josh. &gt;&gt; Like somebody calling you from the hospital. &gt;&gt; I'm down here. I'm down here dying. Come see me. And you laugh at him. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; See, I till I can feel that way, I'll just woof around and preach some conventions and things, but I'll wait. &gt;&gt; Brother Brother Wendle, I love that. I'll wait. He didn't say I'll quit. He said, "I'll wait." You know why? Because he was a word prophet. And there was a revelation in his soul that they that wait upon the Lord. He shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with the wings like an eagle. They shall walk and not be weary. They shall run and not faint. Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. This ain't just another church. This is some eagles who have been waiting on God and they've been renewed this weekend in the presence of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't I'll say this. I'm just preaching. I don't want to be a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be hypocrites, folks. My Bible says a hypocrite with his mouth. &gt;&gt; Destroyth his neighbor. &gt;&gt; But through knowledge shall the just be delivered. Now &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; I got to say what brother said. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He said, "God knows what's in your heart. And if you don't speak from your heart, &gt;&gt; it is &gt;&gt; we'll look at the cross and preach this one. &gt;&gt; Then you're a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So someone comes to you and they ask you something wrong, something something between us, right? and you say, "Oh, no, no, everything's fine." And then you pick up the phone and call somebody and tell them what's between you and the person on it. &gt;&gt; That just come to you about the situation. &gt;&gt; I'm following the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just I'm just meek and I'm just a I'm just I'm just a meek Christian. I just &gt;&gt; No, let's just call what brother calling a hypocrite. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the Pharisees, "You hypocrites, how can you say these things?" Made them a hypocrite. They fought one thing in their heart and expressed their lips with something else. I'll just say what he said. A hypocrite is a deceiver. &gt;&gt; I just feel that someone's just not exactly honest with yourself. He said, "And if you won't be honest with yourself, then how can you ever be honest with God? How could you? If you in your own heart know that you're not living a joyful, peaceful life of the spirit, and you're yielded to the potter, everything just wonderful, God's on the scene, and you won't be honest enough with yourself to come and receive it. How could you be honest with God? &gt;&gt; Now, come on, folks. We might as well just have some Bible preaching here. How can you be honest with God whom you've not seen when you can't even be honest with your brother whom you see every day? &gt;&gt; My brother said, "See, Amen. I'm just going to say this. Regardless of the consequences, speak the truth. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "That's what we want is the truth. Regardless of where it hurts, where it circumcises, or who cuts it off, we want the truth." He said, "What we need is an old-fashioned God-scent heaven-born preachers who will tell the truth regardless of who it hurts. What we need is men of God who will stand and tell the truth regardless of who it hurts. If it takes deacons, trustees, and everything else out, you just be honest. &gt;&gt; But I'll just say this. Anything the truth takes out of the church ought to be taken out. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Baby, I got that John the Baptist anointing on me this morning. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; What are you saying, preacher? I'm saying I believe God's word to be the truth. &gt;&gt; And I don't know how popular it is. That don't make any difference how popular you become here. It's how popular are you up there. &gt;&gt; You know what Paul said? He said, "Speak the truth in love." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, y'all know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind. Now, I'm I'm here. Can I preach? &gt;&gt; You henceforth not walk like Leotans walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just aimlessly. &gt;&gt; Look what he says. Having the understanding darkened. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now look at verse 19. Now this is this is this is in my spirit. Who being past feeling have given themselves over untoiousness to work all uncleanliness with greediness. &gt;&gt; You know what that word feeling means? &gt;&gt; It means to become callous. insensible &gt;&gt; to pain. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; You know what a prophet of God said? &gt;&gt; He said, "America has become &gt;&gt; callous." &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; With an old intellectual idea. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'll just say this because I find it amazing because I don't think our young people ought to just be in the church and just be passed by and looked at as, well, they're just babies. &gt;&gt; Come on in. In prayer lines, you and I'm and when I'm in a prayer line, you'll hear me pray over the young children. I'll say these words, "Lord, build a hedge of protection around them &gt;&gt; and keep them from the evils of the day. Fill every fiber of their being with the Holy Ghost and keep their hearts tender towards you." &gt;&gt; You know why? Because brother said, "You find a good streak of faith like that. That poor little boy a while ago standing here with his little legs walking like that. Little fella looked up at me, the tears come to his little eyes, kind of smiled like that." Why? The faith was just a moving. I know something had to take place. You see what happened? Sure you did. Satan knew he had to give away because that little child was a callous &gt;&gt; like many of the adults. &gt;&gt; You say, "What about them children?" Sure, Jesus is talking to their hearts. Sometimes the adults &gt;&gt; is so callous that the Holy Spirit just can't speak to them. Now, I'm going somewhere. God bless you. Sweet little curly-headed, bondheaded little girl sitting here with her little hand up, her little eyes watered, looking this way. You say, "God's not speaking to that child." He sure is. &gt;&gt; She hasn't calloused her heart with the things of the world yet. She's innocent. She's just a baby about six or seven years old. Here's another one. Look at that little fella coming down about 12 years old. Shame on some of you old people. Now, &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach a second here. Your heart is callous and smutty and black. Statistics show that 98% of people are saved are saved before they're 21 years old. &gt;&gt; You get set in your ways, &gt;&gt; brother. That's &gt;&gt; all right. &gt;&gt; And you think you're right. &gt;&gt; Jesus, &gt;&gt; that is the truth. I've seen many times the callous saints come through prayer lines, men and women live godly and fail to be healed. When prostitutes on the street would come through and be healed instantly. &gt;&gt; He said, "See what's happened now?" Here it is. I'm I'm &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Y'all thought I was going to beat you. No, I'm going to preach to you. &gt;&gt; We've seen so many disappointments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And things that it's hard for our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; You all know I'm telling the truth this morning. &gt;&gt; And many times we put it through old truth story magazines and stuff of the world and it should have never been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it calloused it. &gt;&gt; Now I'll say this. Brother talked about a young girl. He said the Holy Spirit's deal with Y'all remember that. He said the Holy Spirit's dealing with you. He said tonight's your night. God's deal with your heart. And she'd come out of the meeting said don't you ever embarrass me like that. Two years later, Brother Bram comes back to the same town and he said, "I ran into her and she said these words. I could see my mom's soul frying hell like a pancake. &gt;&gt; And laugh at her." &gt;&gt; Now, that's said that's the danger of rejecting Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You get so hard and so calloused, you don't want nothing about it. And that's what this world is today. It's getting so callous. It don't want Christ. Now I'm bringing it out in the world in the church now. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; He said, "Now here's some of you women sitting here with short hair and don't have your hand up. What's the matter with you? You're wrong. See, don't try to meet God like that. You'll be condemned as certain as I'm standing in this pull pit. You mean the Pentecostal church has got in such a shape that it's got so callous till it's ashamed to admit it's wrong. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; Well, we might as well not leave that out there. We might as well bring it right here. We've got to the same spot where you can show scriptures and you can show quotes and you can prove where this was wrong and it was just a misunderstanding or you misheard what I said. I pray to God we never get to the place that we can't say, "Lord, I'm wrong and your word is right." And for the sake of the atmosphere of the church, for the sake of brotherhood, for the sake of fellowship, Lord, I'm wrong and you're right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Oh, don't you lay your heart and become callous." Friends, Leoa is a callous age. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to put on the on the preaching boots and preach a second because brother Brandham got callous, folks. He got hurt. He had been seen disappointments. But I got to thinking about this, brother. If there's a callous, brother Danny, there's got to be a remedy to heal it. &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I went looked up the scientific remedy, brother Miguel, to heal a callous. You know what they say, reduce the pressure and friction, soften the thickened skin, and protect the area from further irritation, and soak the callus in warm water. I said, "Oh, God, give me a pull pit. I can't wait to give that devil a black eye because if science has a way to heal a natural callous, my prophet has come in this hour with a spiritual way to heal a spiritual callous. &gt;&gt; I found it, brother Wendle. I found it. Amen. Let off the pressure and the friction and then soften the heart to receive the engrafted word which is able to save the soul and get behind the protection of the word and let the callous be washed in the water of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, hear my heart this morning. You don't have to live calloused. You don't have to live hard. You don't have to live broken. You don't have to live without a feeling for God and a feeling for the church and a feeling for the people. There's a wider this morning. There's a place you can go. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The callous can be washed away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm following you this morning. So it is every callous church member falls beneath the cross and he rots to his or her own intellectual thinking. That's &gt;&gt; right. when new life comes out of that condition. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; Don't get mad at me. &gt;&gt; William Brandham had intellectual faking when he said, "I'll just go be a trapper. &gt;&gt; I'll just go be a hunter. I'll just go be a woodsman." But thank God &gt;&gt; that the intellectual thinking found the waters of the word and he was able to wash it and he said these words. He said, "New life comes out of that condition." &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Give me some preaching room in the house of God. That's why the devil don't want you to get out of that condition because there's a testimony. Hallelujah. There's a testimony that's going to come out of that condition. There's a miracle going to come out of that condition. There's a breakthrough going to come out of that condition. And the devil presses and the devil presses and the devil presses. But I say this morning, we're going to press back. We're going to press back. We're going to press back against every coldness. We're going to press back against every cut. We're going to press back against every disappointment because we know if we just keep standing before long, Brother Josh, the sun is going to shine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's going to write a testimony out of your hurt. &gt;&gt; I'm talking to you this morning. God is going to write a testimony out of your situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. powerful sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God will take every callous off of you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you just let him &gt;&gt; and make you tender &gt;&gt; and sweet &gt;&gt; and kind-hearted, loving, &gt;&gt; oh God. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; Forgiving one another. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you'll just have faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say this. Complexes cause &gt;&gt; and calluses paralyze faith. &gt;&gt; Can I leave you with something? &gt;&gt; You know how people get calluses? &gt;&gt; By the regular routine. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Heard brother Donnie say one time he said you take a man plays a guitar every day of his life &gt;&gt; before long I think he even said maybe back in Pentecost when he played in the tent meetings that he would get calluses on his fingers &gt;&gt; now come on somebody &gt;&gt; was he out doing something wrong &gt;&gt; was he out running around &gt;&gt; he was doing what he was called to do &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you this morning &gt;&gt; people can do what they're called to do and sometimes still get hurt. &gt;&gt; And still get calluses just from the regular routine. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that devil, calluses have been healed this weekend. &gt;&gt; Complexes have been broken this weekend. And I want to tell that devil, we refuse to let him form another one. &gt;&gt; We refuse to let him put another callous on our praise. We refuse to let him put another callus on our worship. We are not a bunch of vultures. We are not a bunch of black bears and grizzly bear. We are eagles who have been called to eat on the fresh meat of the world. &gt;&gt; That's good preaching. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to take my liberty this morning and I'm going to say God bless everyone of Well, I'm going to back up real quick and say this. &gt;&gt; The world today is full, brother says, of callous clergymen. All right. &gt;&gt; But I want to say God bless every one of you pastors here today. &gt;&gt; I say God bless you, Ben, and God bless you, Brother Ben Beard. God bless you, brother Bo. God bless you, brother Wendle, brother Josh. I say God bless every one of these pastors that have been hurt. They've been cut. They've been stomped on. They've been broken. They've been talked about, falsely accused, but they come here this weekend. And you wouldn't know it unless they told you because they found some bomb and Gilead to let the washing of the water of the word heal the callous because they know if I don't have no feeling I'm wasting my time so they stay before God to keep the feeling of God in their hearts for the people of God. &gt;&gt; I say God bless you shepherds. Amen. I'm going to go ahead and just preach since I'm here. I say God bless every one of you pastor's wives. God bless every one of you pastors and ministers wives. I say God bless you. I say God bless you for seeing your husbands hurt, seeing them broken, seeing them disappointed, but you never got cold and you never got calloused and you didn't keep them in that condition. But you said, "Get up, honey, and go preach like you never preached before." Because there's some people out there and they need some help. There's families need some help. There's young people need an answer. Hallelujah. I say God bless sister Cheryl, brother Daryl for all the years. All the years. Amen. I say God bless you young people who are ministers kids. &gt;&gt; I say God bless you. You've seen things you should have never seen. You've heard things you should have never heard. You've been involved in things and had to endure things that you should have never had to. But I say God bless you because you know that there's more to serving God than a bunch of fussing and fighting. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm feeling good cuz the devil's nervous. Hallelujah. I say God bless every one of you deacons. &gt;&gt; I say God bless our deacons. I say God bless them. They see things. They hear things. They have to put up with things. Come on, folks. They have to go through. Brother Danny Ward, I say God bless you. I say God bless you and God bless you, Sister Vicki. And I say God bless you. God bless your health. God bless your family. God bless your everything. Cuz that man seen more than some people should ever see. But he's not here this morning. And he's not critically complex and all countless. But he's got a love for God in his soul. And he still loves the people. You know how that is? Because somewhere he found a place for the word to heal the calluses. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you want to be a deacon, I may be taking liberty here. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But if you want to be a deacon, go find an elder &gt;&gt; who's been through hell and high water and they still love the church and they still love God's people and they still love the atmosphere being right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I say God bless our song leaders. &gt;&gt; I say God bless our song leaders. Get criticized if they sing a fast song. Get criticized if they sing a slow song. Get talked about if they sing a new song. Get praised if they sing an ancient song. I say God bless you. God bless you song leaders who take your position in the house of God with a feeling in your heart and not just a song in your mouth or the right key on the piano but a love to see the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost move into the building. I'm sorry I'm under a burden this morning. I say hallelujah. I say God give us churches where the power of God can move without complexes and calluses and hurt feelings and bitterness. &gt;&gt; God bless you musicians. &gt;&gt; God bless you &gt;&gt; and especially God bless you drummers. Drums. No drums. Play drums. Don't play. Have drums of the devil. Drums are from God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As Doug Baker says, it's a drum. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; The drum. &gt;&gt; Y'all know I'm in the message. God bless you sound people. &gt;&gt; Get run sound in your churches. Too loud, too quiet. &gt;&gt; Too high, too low. Don't sound y'all know what I'm preaching. But they still show up because it's more than just one weekend. &gt;&gt; Come on. I told our church back home and I tell this church right here, the reason you have meetings like we have is not because everything magically happens one weekend out of the year. It's because service after service after service after service, flesh is being crucified, feelings are being let go of, problems are being fixed, the word is being preached, and then when everybody comes together, there's an atmosphere conducive for a refreshing from the presence of the Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, this is what the message means to me. This is what class means to me is the power of God. &gt;&gt; Moving freely. Yeah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I say this, &gt;&gt; I left somebody out. Forgive me. God bless every one of you. &gt;&gt; God bless you daddies. God bless you mamas. God bless you trustees. Spent too money, didn't spend enough. Paid too much for this, didn't pay enough. God bless you anyhow. Feeling good this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Why are you feeling good?" Cuz there's a fresh feeling in the church. There's a fresh feeling in the hearts of God's people. And Judah, we're not going to let it become stale. We're not going to let it become negative and let it become critical. We're going to stand on our inaliable right as a son of God, as a daughter of God, for the power of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shake it off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do it again, Bo. &gt;&gt; Just shake it off, brother Bo. &gt;&gt; Just Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to read it to you. I'm going to preach it to you. &gt;&gt; A complex is like a is like a rattlesnake. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It just lays there. Tanalyze it. Tanalyze it. Tanalyze it. And it'll never affect you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; As long as you turn around and you walk off. &gt;&gt; As long as you hang the phone up. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory. As long as you hang the phone up and you turn around and you walk off. You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind." No, I haven't. Because I know the necessity of the power of God in our churches. I know the need for liberty in our churches. And I'm going to tell you what Paul said. He said, "The time will come." He said, "When I come to you," he said, "I never was chargeable and I never was burdensome." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I ain't got no friends." It's cuz you're chargeable and burdensome. Yes, &gt;&gt; I ain't got no friends. Cuz every time somebody gets around you, you talk about hope. Nobody likes you and everybody's against you and so and so told this on you and so and so done that and then somebody breaks through again to give you some grace to take you out to supper and maybe this is a different time and maybe things will be different and you no more and sit down and you start talking about well if I was a good preacher if I was a powerful preacher and I was a good singer I'm going to tell you what that is it ain't spiritual it's a complex and it makes you chargeable and burdensome fellowship. &gt;&gt; You all know I'm telling the truth. Amen. Well, oh God have mercy. &gt;&gt; I got to get out of here, man. I got to get out of here. But I got to say it. Clear the atmosphere of complexes. &gt;&gt; Josh, brother Josh said, "What kind of church would we have if we got some churches like the woman in Memphis and the woman in Mexico?" You know when I say what kind of churches would we have if we got a woman like Memphis, a woman like Mexico, and a spirit like a prophet in standing in the gap and say, "I'm done with this complex. I crucify this thing. I'm going to let it go. I'm going on with Jesus. I'm coming out of this stall state of mind. I've lost too many services. I've passed up too many blessings. I've been robbed of too many opportunities. I'm going to shake it off in the fire. I'm going on with Jesus just the same. Amen. I got my feeling back. Hey, I know they going to talk about me. Hey, I got my feeling back this morning. We got our feeling back over here. You make fun of us if you want to, but don't it feel good to feel God? &gt;&gt; Don't it feel good to feel the power of God? Don't it feel good to feel that freshness? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] God, I could sing right now, Kobe, but I know I can't. I'm free. I'm free. Praise the Lord. I'm free. There's no more complexes. There's no more shackles. There's no more inferior complexes. There's no more smart complexes. &gt;&gt; I'm free. I've been in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; that's good. &gt;&gt; I'm out of time. That was weak. &gt;&gt; You build up a complex. Brother said because you hear something. &gt;&gt; You know what else he said? &gt;&gt; He said you start thinking something. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you keep thinking it. &gt;&gt; He said let it go. &gt;&gt; Let it go. &gt;&gt; I'm closing on this. &gt;&gt; There's been a purge in here this weekend. I can raise my hand. &gt;&gt; Brother Nate been a purging. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The 11's gone. &gt;&gt; It ain't coming back. &gt;&gt; It's gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't coming back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Look, with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, instead of now, now I'm going to skip over this. &gt;&gt; Bring some sincerity back in there." &gt;&gt; Yes. Look, because there's something in you pulsating and you want to do it. Paul says this, "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind." Paul in the in the Amplified Bible says, "Having be continually renewed in the spirit of your mind, having a fresh &gt;&gt; untarnished mental &gt;&gt; and spiritual attitude." &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to say what he said. How many How many wants this revival to leave this building and go to your churches? &gt;&gt; How many wants this revival word of life to stay in your church word of life &gt;&gt; in your people &gt;&gt; moving fresh in your hearts &gt;&gt; if we could just get the church in a real spiritual attitude then there will be a revival really. It'll be so much better for our prayers for the sick as long as our conditions are slumping. Then we just don't seem to pick it up like we should. But when everybody's just prayed up, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Can I say it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And keyed high. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And a great expectation. I've walked to the platform and many times be five and six, 7,000 people and not be one feeble person as soon as you walked out on the platform. everyone get up out of their wheelchairs, their cotss, and their stretchers and walk right away because you're under such an expectation. &gt;&gt; He said, "Listen this morning." Amen. If you're either saved or you're not, you're either a saint or a sinner. You're either spiritual attitude towards God or not. And your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies exactly where you're standing. &gt;&gt; It is. That's right. &gt;&gt; And your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual amnesia or not. What are you saying, preacher? I'm saying this. Say it with me. Lord &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; put the feeling back in my sink. &gt;&gt; Put the feeling back in it. Lord, &gt;&gt; I don't want to go another day without that feeling. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you this and I'm done. &gt;&gt; When you got feeling Other people will know it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When you got feeling, other people will know it. I'll prove it to you. They'll know it by your handshake. &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Me and my wife were going down the road the other day and he said, "There was a lady passed by and she said, "How do Miss Brandham?" Sister Brandham, Brother said, "I looked over and said we kept going and my wife, I said to my wife, honey, them people spoke to you. Why didn't you say nothing?" She said, "Oh, I smiled. I smiled. You know what brother M said? He said, "Honey, I'm sitting next to you and didn't hear what you said and smiled. She was on the other side of the road. I know she didn't hear it." You know what he said? He said, "You know what I like?" Amen. I don't like a little old silly grin. I like a good old pump handle handshake. &gt;&gt; I say, "God, bring back the pump handle handshakes to the house of God. Let's get rid of these little silly grins and these little silly nods. And let's bring back the love of God with a good oldfashioned pump handle hand. Say, "Brother, I love you. I love you with all my heart. I pray the Holy Ghost bless you. Josh, I pray the Holy Ghost use you." Brother Wimble, I pray you bless Paul knee. Brother Daryl, I pray you shake the world through you. Brother Aaron, I pray God use you. I pray God shake Virginia with you. Judah, I pray the Holy Ghost move in the power of his love and the power of unity and the power of the spirit. Come on, church. I'm closing on this. It's worth fighting for. It's worth fighting for. And sometimes to fight for it. We got to crucify our flesh. We got to die to our carnal thinking. We got to die to our own intellectual agenda. But let the love of God Hallelujah. Stand on your feet and give God praise. Let the love of God, &gt;&gt; let it flow. &gt;&gt; Let it flow. &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Ghost shake Dyresburg through you. &gt;&gt; I pray the Holy Ghost heal your body and move through you like he's never moved before. &gt;&gt; Miguel, I pray this is just the beginning of your family being saved. I pray more come in. I pray that everyone come home, buddy. I pray God open this message to you like it's never been open to anybody else. &gt;&gt; This is the feeling of God for the people of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to get by, but I can't. &gt;&gt; It's right there in front of me. &gt;&gt; All right. But it's on the end. Paul Raider got up one morning and had a little spat with his wife. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Went through the regular routine, hugged her, &gt;&gt; kissed her. &gt;&gt; Went out the door and got down the road and got to thinking, &gt;&gt; "What if this is the last time I ever see her? &gt;&gt; What if something happens to the mom of my babies? What if something happens to the to the wife of my home, the the lady of my life? &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Turned around and drove back home. Got out, went back in, did the same thing over. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; brother Chris, they asked him. They said, "What was the difference?" He said, "That time there was feeling in it, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, Lord, bring back the feeling. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. I got to say what a prophet of God said. He said, "I pray God will place in your heart that's something that I lost out there in that complex. &gt;&gt; It's so easy to build one." &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't lose the feeling of the people." See, you must remember they're not made out of sawdust. &gt;&gt; They are flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; They're human beings &gt;&gt; and they have a soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you this morning, but I just want to get somewhere and weep. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just want to get somewhere and say, "Lord, don't ever let the routine cause me to build a complex." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you this morning? &gt;&gt; How about you say this morning, Lord, in my heart, I feel that freshness. &gt;&gt; How can you be in a meeting like we had here this weekend and not feel that freshness? But you're going to have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to fight to keep it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil ain't going to just go down the road and leave you alone. &gt;&gt; He'll follow you home, &gt;&gt; follow you back to your churches on Wednesday night. &gt;&gt; He'll do everything he can to take that freshness out of your life &gt;&gt; and make that feeling stale. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; But this is a different generation. &gt;&gt; That's right. This is a different people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil don't know what to do with this people &gt;&gt; because they let things go &gt;&gt; and they love &gt;&gt; and they forgive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They look beyond the present &gt;&gt; into the future and they strive. I don't know about you this morning. I I'm sorry. And I know this probably wasn't a closing shout meeting, &gt;&gt; but I I I pray that from the depths of my heart. You can see, you're the people of God. &gt;&gt; The person sitting next to you is the purchase of his blood. &gt;&gt; They're not just some crazy person you go to church with. And they're not just that holy roller you try to avoid at Walmart. &gt;&gt; No, for the queen of heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you lose your feeling for them, &gt;&gt; you'll lose it for the church. &gt;&gt; And then you'll lose it for your position. &gt;&gt; And then you'll lose it for what God's called you to do. &gt;&gt; But you say, "Lord, whatever I got to do, &gt;&gt; I want to keep it." I &gt;&gt; heard brother Josh say one time, brother Josh Bennett here. He said, "I've crucified my flesh too many times to let the enemy have his way now." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And folks, I'm standing on the authority of this word this morning. And I think that's a very powerful and profound statement. I think it's time to keep crucifying our flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let the life of Christ &gt;&gt; be manifested. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. How many say, "Lord, I give myself &gt;&gt; I give myself to you." &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been hurt, but there's a bomb in Gilead this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, I've been disappointed, but I'm not going to let that control my feeling. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to let that control the way I praise you, Lord. &gt;&gt; These meetings have broke things off in my life, and I know the devil's going to try to put it back on there, but Lord, I'm not letting it come back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to walk every day in faith. &gt;&gt; Whether I feel like it in my whether I feel like it in my flesh or not. I'm not going by my feelings of being led by feelings. I'm going by the love the feelings. The love of God in my heart. Oh God. How many this morning say, "Lord, keep me fresh." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're here. You're an officer in your local church or you're an officer in this church. You say, "Lord, keep me fresh. People need me. Lord, I need the people. Say, "God bless you this morning. God bless you this morning. I need you. You need me. We need each other. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We don't have time for losing the feeling of God. &gt;&gt; We got a message to be preached. &gt;&gt; We got demons to be defeated. &gt;&gt; We got a rapture to take. &gt;&gt; We got a sword to hold right there at the head of that devil and say, "Satan, you won't control me another day. Would &gt;&gt; you this morning just lay your hand on someone standing next to you, &gt;&gt; brother to brother, sister to sister, husband to wife in godly order this morning. As we lay our hands up on one another today, I wonder if there be one can say, "Lord, I join my faith with my brother. &gt;&gt; I join my faith with my sister. &gt;&gt; I join with them today. Lord, &gt;&gt; I'm joining with them in this battle. They're not bad people. I'm not a bad person. We're not a bunch of sinners. We're not a We're not a bunch of backsliders. We're not a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of people renegades or rickettes or rickers or rickettas or Ricky's or whatever this bunch. We're none of that. We're brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're the children of God. We're the people of God. We're the purchase of the blood of God. And you've been hurt and I've been hurt. You've been cut and I've been cut. We've been wounded. But we're going to lay that aside today. We're not going to let this callous take over our praise. We're not going to become a complex church member. We're going to keep the fresh feeling of God in our souls. We're going to we're going to look past the faults and the mistakes. And we're going to find the good in situations. We're going to find the positive in situations. We're going to die out to our own ambitions. We want the right spirit, Lord. We want the right motive. We want the right objective, Lord. I know today there's many there's many here from other churches. You say, "Lord, Amen. Let our church have a feeling behind it, Lord." Amen. Let our singing and let our preaching, let there be a feeling behind it. Amen. The Holy Ghost right now is settling over the congregation. He's moving right now in a special way. He's healing and he's he's bringing bomb to to hurts and cuts right now. Won't you join with me today? Heavenly Father, Lord, as we come to the close of these meetings, Lord, Father, as we stand here today, Lord, as your servant, Lord, delivered what you so burdened my heart with this morning, dear God. Father, I believe that your word is true. And I believe that truth has been preached here this weekend, Lord. Father, I know the devil has done everything he can, Lord, to defeat every one of these believers and to defeat every one of these preachers and to defeat every one of these musicians and song leaders and deacons and trustees and and ministers families and lay members and and Sunday school teachers and and Lord, all the I'm sorry, Lord, I'm failing to mention some I know, but Lord, you know my heart. And Lord, you know they're not out gambling. They're they're not out running women and and corrals and they're not out chasing men and and and drugs and stuff, Lord. They're serving you faithfully, Lord. They're at their posted duty faithfully. And Lord, sometimes we get hurt, Lord. Sometimes we get cut. And Lord, sometimes it's not just a flesh wound. It's not just a skin wound, but oh God, it becomes a deep cut. And the devil wants to pour confession in there. But today, Lord, as the body of Jesus Christ, as the believers of Jesus Christ, as the sons and daughters of God, we stand upon the authority of the love of God, we stand upon the power of the elective love of God. And we say, Satan, in the name of Jesus, we rebuke you. We drive you out of our homes. We drive you out of marriages. We drive you out of families. We drive you out of churches. Satan, in the name of Jesus, you have been defeated here this weekend. And may the power of the Holy Ghost may it accompany every one of these believers when they leave here. Lord, may there if they've lost their feeling, Lord, if they've lost their feeling and their passion and the passion of this revival, Lord, if the fire in this message has become cold and Lord, it's dried up on them. Lord, I pray this weekend, dear God, that a cold of fire has come up off the altar and has ignited their hearts, has it reignited their ministries, oh God, has refreshed their talents, has anointed their gifts, oh God. Lord, I pray for every fifth gospel here, Lord. I know sometimes, amen, that mamas can go through things, Lord, and it takes the very life out of them, but oh God, I pray by the power of the Holy Spirit, Lord, may you refresh every mama here. May you refresh the little the little pastor of them children that little fifth gospel in the name of Jesus. Lord, may the desires of the hearts of the mothers, Lord, may they become testimonies in the lives of their children, oh God. Father, I pray for the fathers here today, Lord. They stand in the gap near God, between the outside world and that little family, that little home you've given them. But oh God, I pray I pray a blessing upon them, Lord. I pray the power of God upon them. I pray the strength of God. I pray the leadership of God and the wisdom of God would be their portion. Lord, in the name of Jesus, may you bind us together, Lord. May you bind us together, Lord, with a cord that cannot easily be broken, Lord. In the name of Jesus, we receive the victory today. We receive the victory today. We receive the victory today. The victory and love divine. Oh, because they've chosen the harder way. There's a great portion laying ahead for them. And father, I pray today, dear God, as we close these meetings out as we go our separate ways. Lord, take our hand and lead us in the harder way. Lord, let us stay behind the pillar of fire. Let us stay behind what your prophet taught. Let us stay behind the message of the hour. For Lord, your prophet said those that follow the pillar of fire, they'll have a hard way. Oh, but they'll be ready for the translation on that morning. And Lord, just any day now, just any day now, our bodies are going to be changed. We're going to lay down our swords. We're going to lay down our shields. We're going to lay down our weapons. We're going to put on a new body. We're going to walk down the streets of cold. We're going to be rejoined for our loved ones. Oh, Father, may the fight of God remain in the hearts of your children. In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. I give myself to you this morning. I give this congregation to you this morning. In the name of Jesus, we stand as the bride of Jesus Christ, pursuing the promises of Christ. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. In the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, these are good people, Lord. These are your people, Lord. Father, they've been through things and seen things. Been through beatating sessions, Lord, and legalistic sermons and hard things. Seen things they should have never seen, Lord. but your word still prevails in their life. And Lord, I thank you for this congregation of people, Lord, that your character and forgiveness and love and flexibility is still on display in their lives. Father, may it never leave, Lord. Lord, may it never leave our hearts. Oh God, in the name of Jesus, &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How many just want to raise your hands this morning and love him? How many just want to raise your hands this morning and love him? Say, Lord, I thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you for the freshness. Lord, I thank you for the refilling of the Holy Spirit here this weekend. Lord, I thank you for it. Lord, I thank you for it this morning. Brother Kobe, whatever's on your heart this morning, I thank you for it, Lord. I love you for the love of the Lord, folks. God bless you. God richly bless you. I pray something's been said this morning to help you. I pray I pray you know my heart this morning. Brother Dan, I thank you. I thank you for the opportunity to stand here once again. Let's fight the battles. Let's move forward. Thank you for your attention this morning. God bless you today. Oh, there is he that is the presence. [Music] [Music] in the presence. Seeing in the presence, you just lift your hands and sing that this morning. [Music] There's deliverance in the presence. Thank you, Lord. Every single [Music] delivery presence. Oh, deliverance in the presence. Deliverance in the presence of Lord. Oh, there is peace. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for your peace. Peace in the presence. Oh, peace in the presence of the Lord. Oh, there is peace in Oh, I thank you for peace. Oh, peace in the presence of I'm happy. Oh, in his presence. I'm free. I'm free. Oh, his presence. [Music] I'm free. [Music] Oh, I'm not perfect. Oh, I'm changed forever in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for his presence this morning? Give him a hand clap of praise. I told someone this week I was talking about complexes and they said, "Well, they gave me a complex." I said, "No one can give you a complex. They can give you a materials to build a complex, but you have to build it." If you could ever just walk away and say, "I I refuse to build." &gt;&gt; People are going to hurt you. You're going to get hurt. &gt;&gt; I've always prayed, "God, help me not to hurt people." Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I come from a background, brother Joel did as well, that we've seen people get hurt and we were hurt as children. We didn't want to hurt people. &gt;&gt; And and yet you do inadvertently at times you say things that maybe a little sharp or something. God help the people to know that I love them, you know, and they'll overlook that. I might inadvertently hand you the material to build a complex, but just say, Lord, I'm not going to build it. I'm going to be free in his presence. I I'm going to I'm going to walk free from these meetings. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be a Christian today? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I think from the very beginning, the everything that's been done, the the messages that have been preached has just been ordered by the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; And uh my goodness, what was preached on Thursday and Friday and Saturday morning, Saturday night, and this morning, I believe we could take that home and and just believe it and it'd be enough word to last. I I told Brother Joel, I said, "My flesh wants to cancel Wednesday night service, but we're not going to. We're going to have church." Come on. That's all right. And uh the reason I said that is because number one, I'm tired. Number two, I these brothers preach so well. Thought what am I going to do? But uh I believe there'll be an expectation of the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. I And you you miss always miss people. But brother Joel, come up here a minute. And I uh had him written down this morning to to thank brother Joel for what he does here for the church. And I didn't do it. I I failed to do it. It's one thing when you forget and you don't write it down. It's another thing when you write it down, you still forget it. But I am getting old. But brother Joel and I kid each other. Come here, Brother Joel. We kid each other a lot. But what we do here, we do as a team. And brother Joel, the reason he walks funny is because he fell through the roof of the building. You really did helping us put uh wires in the roof so you could have sound. and and I really I love my brother and God gave him to me to to be I I believe I've been a help to him and he's been a help to me. And don't we love Brother Joel here in the church? I glad to have him. [Music] And uh I'll say this, he works harder than I do on these meetings and we would not have been able to do it over the past 5 years without brother Joel. So I love you buddy. Thank you for being He's my associate pastor here at the church and we love him very much. Thank you for being with us. Those of you sitting back in the foyer, I'm sorry you got to sit back there, but we sure appreciate you coming. And I know some have said even uh at the fellowship hall and during different nights and and listened and things, thank you for coming. Thank your pastors once again for allowing you to come. Let's just worship in his presence. Again, what we've done in every service is we just allowed you time to worship and yet if you need to go, you can go. So, we'll do that again this morning. Let's bow our heads one more time and and just ask the Lord to bless the food and bless your travels. If some of you have to go home today, let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful to be in your presence once again. I pray God that you just move and Lord, may the word settle into our hearts. Lord, may we not be forgetful hearers of the word, but doers of the word. Lord, that we would not just say it, Lord, as many times that we we tend to say things, but Lord, may we do it, Lord. May we really forgive and really love and really press the battle and really do what's been taught us to do, what we've been what we've heard over this weekend. I pray you'd bless these pastors, Lord. Brother Josh and Brother Wendell and these evangelists, Brother Daryl and and Brother Andrew. Lord, I pray you would give them, Lord, a furtherance of their ministry. May they preach things that, Lord, deeper than they ever have before, with more fire than they ever have before. Pray you'd strengthen their bodies and their minds. Pray your spirit would be with them. We thank you for their their dedication, their service this weekend. I pray you bless each one. I pray you just move, bless the food, nourish it to our bodies. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. God bless you. You're free to stay and worship or if you need to go and go ahead and get something to eat, you're welcome to do that as well. God bless you. There'll be food at the fellowship hall. Thank you for coming. Aren't you glad to be in the house of the Lord? Give him another hand of praise. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm free. &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
