every thought of man every every worry every every struggle Lord every fear Lord may you move this morning and may your spirit be real in this place may you brood over us Lord and produce in our lives what you would have for us to be and we'll give you the thanks and the glory and the honor we ask in Jesus name amen amen thank the lord it's good to be back with you this morning Hebrews chapter 3 and verse 1 we'll also read Hebrews 4:14 and Hebrews 10:23 so we'll stay in the book of Hebrews this morning Hebrews 3:1 Hebrews 4:14 and Hebrews 10:23 uh I want to apologize for the late notice for the Tuesday night service I uh uh threw that on you I know quickly just kind of come together quickly and I forgot all about ball games and all of those things I know a lot of kids are in ball and softball and and people have work schedules and things so we don't change our our service schedule very often but we will have church on Tuesday night instead of Wednesday and so you just bear with me on that I apologize for doing that I I just but you know we just want the we want to help you that's what we're here for and that's why we do what we do it's why I make the decisions that I do to try to help people and so if we can help you in any way that's what we want to do and I do believe an evangelist like brother Andrew that that helps the church and and so we want to be provide all the help that we can I believe the spirit of the Lord will just move if you can be here on Tuesday night and whoever else can be here I trust the spirit of the Lord will just be here with us that he said where two or three are gathered together he said I am in the midst and so we're believing that and trusting his word uh for to for this morning for tonight for Tuesday night tonight I've got to go to uh Gibson preach for brother IV you haven't been back there uh for almost well been over four years now and so y'all pray for me and and going and doing that he asked me to come was again a last minute thing but felt like I needed to do that I'm going to do that at while you're having church here at 3:00 I'll be over there my kids uh my older two Peter and Esther they decided to stay here I don't know how to feel about that they'd rather stay here at church with y'all than go with their dads so I guess they're getting to that age but tonight's going to be our youth focused night and and so where you always come and support the youth and we're so glad of that it's good to see the pry back with us this morning God bless you guys they've been gallivanting around the country and and it's good to have them back and and I seen Brother Bruce back there God bless you Brother Bruce good to have you back in the house of the Lord and and each one that's here this morning Hebrews chapter 3 verse one wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus Hebrews 4:14 seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession again Hebrews 10:23 if just a moment to turn there while I put this jacket on in the first place let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering how many want to do that this morning for he is faithful that promised pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning the best definition I have of positive is the best definition that I found is the definite existence of a thing rather than its absence which is negative so if something is positive it means it exists if something is negative it means it doesn't exist the word positive comes from a Latin word which means a question of law settled by agreement so it's a settled question a positive answer something that you know and something that you possess and profession in the King James version in the Bible is the same as our word confession something you say it's a statement belief about something so I I want to speak this morning on unleashing the power of a positive confession unleashing the power of a positive confession now a confession again is a statement of belief about something and if I would say this morning uh if I would say I'm going home after the service or I would say I'm going to Gibson and after the service that's a positive statement I'm I'm saying I'm going to do something and and I believe that right I I really believe that I'm going to go now many things could happen that could keep me from going many things could happen uh but you know when you tell somebody you're going to do something you don't sit there and say well you know uh if my car runs if it uh you know why why do you not do that because you have a a confidence a level of confidence in the vehicle that you're driving that you just expected to work when you go home and you you expect just to be able to go and and maybe some of yall don't I haven't always uh had Vehicles like that there's been times I I felt like that maybe I wouldn't make it home and and and maybe more often than not they were broke down but the vehicles I have now I I have for a reason and the reason I have these vehicles because I believe they'll get me from where I am to where I'm going and and so I can make a positive statement about them now the reason I can make that positive statement is also because I have the key to the vehicle right already in my possession and so I couldn't make a positive statement well I'm going to go home in brother David's vehicle today I I'm going to go home in brother Jared's vehicle today I can't make a positive statement about that because I don't possess the key to your possession right but I do possess the key to my possession and that key is it makes me positive that I can make it on well don't you realize when you have faith today you already have possession faith is what we possess that allows us to to recognize and to know I'm going home one of these days I'm not going to be in this body forever I'm going home I'm going to make it in a Rapture my body is going to be healed I'm going to be Chang in a moment in the twinkling of an eye what are we saying brother Joe I I'm positive I'm going to make it because I already have the key in my possession faith is my possession though I don't possess my body yet I don't possess maybe you you've been praying for healing and you don't possess your healing yet but you know it's coming right you know it's coming you're positive it's coming why can you be sure it's coming because you have faith right that's what you possess brother brandom said it was like having 25 cents now that won't buy you a loaf of bread today but back then it would he said if you gave me 25 cents if I was hungry and I needed a loaf of bread and I knew where there was a store that had bread for 25 cents and you gave me a quarter he said I could be just as happy with the quarter as I could with the loaf of bread because it's the purchase price of the bread and faith is the purchase price of every Redemptive blessing of God everything he died for under the atonement is bought by faith right and it's accessed by a positive confession towards the word yeah and of the word now we can only positively confess what we have right right we we can't confess what we don't have and what do we have again we don't have you know if I could tell you this morning prove to me that you're saved give me something to prove to me that you're saved none of us could have anything that would prove that you could say look at my life well I could show you a life of someone who who uh did everything right yeah and maybe went died and went to hell right because you're not saved you don't make it on good behavior right right so we can't physically prove that we're saved well I'm saved because I believe the message well there it be those who say they believe they don't don't make it right I'm I'm saved because what you can't prove that what proves it to you your faith right right faith is what you possess oh church that tells you now you might have you might have been saved off a bar stool you might say well I can see what I was I can see what I am now but what actually tells you that you're saved is the faith that you have in the promise of God that if you would come to him in a certain way if you would repent if you'd be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you say that wasn't just a feeling it wasn't just an emotion it wasn't just any experience that was God moving in my life and it becomes faith in your life are you with me so far what we possess is Faith right it it's all that we have it's the purchase price it's all that we have it's all that we need it's the purchase price of everything contained in the atonement the Bible tells us that faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen it's the substance or the support or the reality or the actual uality of things hoped for and it's the evidence or the proof of Things Not Seen brother B said now here's where many people fail to receive their healing or what they're asking for because they take Faith to be something that is not they don't believe it see it's not he said it's not imagination it's actual substance he said now listen closely it's not what you imagine it's just as real to you as any sense of your body would declare anything else he said it's just as real as my eyes says this is a piece of paper it's just as real as to say that's a light it's just as real as to say I feel my coat yeah right what what is that what makes me what makes me say that I can make a positive statement I feel my coat what is that it's a sense of touch right right I know I feel something yeah and and faith is just like that I know it yeah right I know it I know it's s he said it's just as real as I hear that baby talking or making its noise just as real as music playing just as real as I taste anything in my mouth it's that real listen only you can't show it to somebody else yes right that's why we got to have an individual uh experience with God every one of us do our children do we do every one of you kids you got to have an individual experience with God you need to know for yourself where no one can shake you away from that you need to have something that you possess that nobody can come and take it away because people can people will say all kinds of things about you but you got to be willing and you got to be able to say within yourself I know what I possess I know in whom I believe in like Paul said and I'm persuaded he's able to keep that what I've committed unto him against that day so faith is a reality it's a substance he said you have it alone it's yours faith is a substance not just a myth it's something you possess not imagination he said if you really have it it's just as real to you as any other thing could be just as real as you know that you're riding in your automobile you see I have confidence again in my car that it's going to take me where I want to go I don't even think about it maybe I should think more about it because it's a Ford both of my cards are Ford so maybe I should have more thoughts about that but and but at least it's not a Chevy right so but it's it's it's something I have a confidence right I believe it works and I got enough confidence in it even though it's a for I got enough confidence in it that it'll make it to its destination oh church and you just realize that's the kind of confidence you got to have between you and God there's got to be that confidence that says I know I'm going to make it I know that no matter what anybody says no matter what the devil says no matter what my kids say no matter what my parents say no matter what anybody else says I'm going to make it why because faith is the substance I believe it that's and I'll tell you this my car failed me there had been times I went out there and I turned the key and it didn't work because it needed a battery or or it needed the motor rebuilt or needed something else but this word of God always works it's never failed if you put the key of faith in it it will work 100 times out of a hundred it never fails that's good do you realize young people what that means realize what that means sister Jasper when you put the key of faith in the word word of God you turn it it it'll work when you begin to pray and ask God for what you have need of he said what I'm going through struggles in my life but just ask God for what you have need of and when you do you believe that in faith it will work a hundred times out of a hundred you said well I didn't have an immediate response I didn't immediately feel better no but but listen it's not what happens to you immediately but you know it's going to happen it works 100% all right of the time now watch it's substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of God and that only oh I think no matter what else we make time for in our lives we need to make time for hearing the word of God whether we hear it here in the church or hear it at home or hear it wherever it is we need to hear the word of God we need to be listening to the word we need to be listening to the voice of the spirit in our lives which will always speak the word am it comes to you by hearing the word of God and that only Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God he said that puts it back to where your faith in it's not in some individual it's not in a man it's not in an organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is the word your faith is in God now the Bible tells us that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God yeah or by the confession of God yeah right what God spoke I want you I want you to see the power of faith God believed his own word and he didn't say well there may be light he didn't say well I hope there's light he said let there be light right having faith in his own word and it came to pass he said the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things things which do appear so in other words things that we think of as reality if you think about the eclipse that passed the other day and we think about how that how that everything was set in order and and they knew about that eclipse for years before it happened and they they told us about it when the last eclipse come through they told us about this one what was that they've known about it for years people have actually been predicting eclipses for for thousands of years for at least 2600 years people have been predicting when the sun and the moon will cross one another why can they do that because God when God puts something in order it always works come it doesn't work just part of the time it always works it always happens just exactly when he's when it's supposed to happen listen if he can do that with the sun and the moon how much more can he order the events of Our Lives to come together at the right time in the right place you say I know people we don't our young people here aren't really old enough most of you but I know you get worried as you get older and brother Isaac I know you get you know as you begin to get in your 20s you know what that's like in your 20s you begin to worry well I'm ever going to find a wife but planets had to cross right and God knew when that would happen but we didn't know there was somebody for Isaac there was somebody for Catherine we didn't even know Catherine but there was somebody for Catherine and somebody for Isaac what was it the plan is crossed at the right time at the time God knew they would cross yet all the worry and the struggle and the heartache that we look at that and we think man how how would it ever happen I'm not good enough I'm not I'm not handsome enough no brother brother Isaac never thought that but but some of us thought well I I'm not handsome enough I'm not you know I wouldn't be able but God caused us to come together at the right to oh don't you believe if he brought you to your husband or he brought you to your wife don't you believe he'll bring you to the right job he'll bring you to the right Church he'll he'll bring you to the right place at the right time we just got to have confidence in him believe his word that's good amen amen now so how does a sinner or a sick person Unleash the Power of a positive confession by possessing faith and confessing what you possess now medicine doesn't heal brother BR said you take the life out of there there's no healing he said life is the Healer life is the Healer and life is God Jesus came that you might have abundance of life he said more life than what your normal life is to believe on him to be healed by faith he said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass there it is he said now and brother BR says that over and over again in the message but then he says say what are you talking about gifts for and he was telling them teaching them about gifts particularly uh the gift that God had put in his life and he said what are you talking about gifts for he said gifts are to edify they additions he said here is the first and only foundation for Divine Healing or anything from God is the Bible he said if you get off of that you're out of God's will can we say Amen to that you can't have a positive confession with the justing about something that's not in the word if it's not in the word you can't say this is what I'm going to do this is what I believe this is you might you might say it but it won't come to pass right because it's not in the word right he said if you get off of that you're out of God's Will and Divine Healing isn't a Hocus Pocus Affair it isn't saying a few mystery words over somebody and hypnotizing come on church it's the truth sir I love the way brother Bram defines Divine Healing it's the truth revealed through Jesus Christ is Divine Healing the truth revealed through Jesus Christ brother re said Faith again I'm reading a lot this morning but I just want you to really want I want to teach us teach this to us in a way that we can understand it way that I can understand it and you can understand it notice he said Faith you must believe he said it upon believing the only way that faith can be based sanely and sensibly for Divine Healing is upon the written word of God this is the foundation the foundation of faith is God's word that is the absolute of Faith yeah is whatever God says right right so then we got to believe if we're going to have faith we got to believe this is the infallible word of God right if you got to have faith in it you say well what about the message well I believe the message is the word of God I got to believe that to have faith in it I don't mean that everything a prophet said was thus sayith the Lord but what it does mean is that what a prophet phet said matters that's right what a prophet said matters he was a prophet when he said it right and so we we got to have faith in or confidence in won't do us any good right and not everything Moses said was thus sayith the Lord CU he said at one point you know he didn't circumcise his own Sons not everything he said or did was thus sayith the Lord but he was still God's man right right and God backed him up and so we believe we had a messenger like Moses in this day and hour in fact there were only uh three Messengers like that it was Moses in the in the Old Testament it was Paul in the New Testament and it was William brandom at the end time that actually had the the pillar of fire with them right during their Ministry and so we know they were Vindicated Prophet it wasn't just like any other Prophet that's got a vision or a dream or or a sensation or a feeling it wasn't like that at all it wasn't like these prophets today that come out and say well I'm a prophet and and then someone has a back ache somebody has a a neck that that's aching well it's aching cuz you they've been looking at you uh jumping around and so uh but that's not what kind of a prophet it is it's a prophet that could stand there and reveal the secrets of the heart and fulfilled the word of God right so so it's our faith has got to be upon the word that there is a scripture brother BR didn't come to replace the scripture what did he come to do to fulfill the scripture brother B didn't come to write another Bible what did he do he come to he come to live it out right and to speak it it become the message for our day the light for our day is the message of the hour right and we got to walk in that light or no light right right if we don't walk in the light of the message hour we walk in darkness that's how important the message is but now watch Faith got to be upon the written word of God this is the foundation everything in the message comes from the scriptures yes he's a word Prophet right and then everything in the message in whatever a prophet taught we can believe yeah right again that doesn't mean he couldn't stumble over his words and be human that's that he was human but we believe God hid himself right behind human flesh if I didn't believe that how could I not how could I believe in God hiding himself behind my flesh how could you believe in God hiding yourself behind your flesh he does he hides himself behind flesh even today but he hid himself there for the purpose of vindicating a Vindicated Prophet for the purpose of shining the light on the word for our day how many believe that so the foundation of faith is word of God you got to believe the message right right and we're a message church right if you don't believe the message you're not going to have faith in what I'm saying to you because what I'm saying to you comes from the message you might say well I you know brother bram's okay but I just you know he was he was good Divine healer but I just stay with the Bible Well if you don't believe what God said about the Bible in our day right how can you how can you how can you have any faith so it's got to come back to Lord I believe everything you say whatever you have to say is right I may not always be able to do it like I'd like to but I believe what you say is the truth how many can say that this morning I believe what you say Lord is the absolute truth that's what I believe so then I can make a positive confession about the word because a positive postive confession is a scriptural confession whatever the word says is true about me faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God oh yeah so now I possess faith that the word of God will materialize in my life now what did he do at the beginning he spoke said let there be light and there was light so now when God says something his word becomes material in his creation right his word with you you can't see what's in his mind you can't see his word you can't see Faith but you see the results of faith and what you see in your life is actually the results of Faith your healing your your we thank God for the wonderful testimonies of healing that we've seen and we we thank God for wonderful testimonies of Salvation and and your testimony this morning what God can do and so what's God doing God is saying something about his word and then it becomes material in your life that's when you say it now when God says something it's already accomplished he's Eternal but now we're creatures of time right right we're creatures of time and the way I one way I know that is because if I go over a certain amount of time on Sunday morning we're all going to be in trouble right because I got to leave here and be two hours away by 3:00 so if I preach to 1:30 this morning which I've never done breathe a little bit this morning you all right I've never preached to 1:30 but I could right and we could preach all day if we just let ourselves go you know but but but we could you know the spirit of the Lord might move but then I'd have a problem with time right because I promis to be somewhere else so I believe I have the ability to stop the service and to close the service at a certain time and I can keep worshiping if you want to but then I'll go on to another place right why because I'm a creature of time but God don't work like that right God's not subject to time right right whatever he already whatever he said has already happened whatever is in the future with God has already happened because he's Eternal right does that make sense yeah he's not worried about you right because you're already in his you are oh my you're already saved you have already made it you're his child he's not concerned about you not making it that's because he does not exist in time and I've always taken this you can take it for what it's worth but I've always taken this as a type you know uh we uh we actually sinned in time we sinned in time but God is eternal right and so we can be forgiven or redeemed because we sinned in time but God is eternal but the Satan sinned before there was time you understand he was created and he was in in heaven where it's Eternal and he sinned Before Time and he could never repent right you realize even if he wanted to he couldn't repent because time is what gives us a space all right to repent oh I thank God for that today time gives us a space so that we can repent I said we ought to use our time we ought to use our time to repent and come back to God and give him all of all of our life every bit of our time that's good now Peter tells us in the Bible that scoffers would rise saying that his word isn't true because time has passed and it hasn't happened yet he said knowing this first those are come in the last day scoffers walking after their own lust or their own desire and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old now watch what he's saying the Earth standing out of the water and in the water he said by the word that's why the planets are there that's why the eclipse happened the way that it did that's why things happen the way that they do and that's by the word that's why the heavens are in order that's why the Earth was separated from the water that's by the word that's why the sun and the moon were separated and put in their spots by the word amen I got to thinking about that Brother David while we watching that Eclipse I told somebody I think I said if that son was just a little bit further away we would all freeze to death if it was just a little bit closer we would all we would all burn up but it just happens to be where it is and if you look at all the other planets none of them they you would have to artificially support life on Mars you would have to artificially support life on any of the other planets you'd have to artificially you couldn't support life on the sun it's too hot but this planet supports life why does it because God said for this planet to be the one that had life in the beginning he made the heavens and the Earth right and the Earth was the one he singled out of all the planets don't you realize everybody else in the world may not have life we're living in a time of Darkness but you are the planet that he separated out from the before the foundation of the world you're in the habitable zone the part where there's life where the where the sun won't burn you up that's good but it produces just enough life amen so you can make it now watch 2 Peter 3:6 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the Earth which are now now the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store kept in store in other words why did they hang there because God said so reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly Men by the same word verse 8 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day he says in verse n the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness so if you're believing for your healing today if you're believing for the Salvation of your children if you're believing for whatever it is that you have need of I don't want to limit just to those things whatever you have need of today if you're believing for it the Lord is not slack concerning his promise but is longsuffering aren't you glad he's longsuffering aren't you glad he puts up with us that's what time is it's the longsuffering of God not willing that any should perish he puts up with stuff out of us that that that he probably shouldn't put up with by our own standards we'd say we we should just do away with it we you should just do away with them brother said if I was God if they wouldn't take my word for it I just let him go but he said no he sent prophets he sent pastors he sent teachers he sent people to the Earth he's through all time why because he loves you he's longsuffering to us word I'm so glad he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance people say why don't you deal with this deal with that because we're we we hope we have the attribute of God we believe we have the attribute of God that belongs suffering there will come a time to deal with it but in our own lives we're longsuffering because we want to make sure we want to make sure that the person is in a place where they can respond to that right you you can do that with your own children they got to be in a place best thing you do for your children get them in the house of God put them in an atmosphere where they can respond to the word they won't always hear it you know there's things you can say to your wife that the timing's just wrong sometimes you need to wait on different timing to speak that word over her right brother BR talk about going casting a devil man trying to cast The Devil out of his wife he said he he said that's not the way to do it he said go love her the timing's not right the the timing matters because we're creatures of time we don't we don't just grow we don't just get saved all of a sudden we're perfect we don't even get the Holy Ghost all of a sudden we're perfect brother BR said you become a target of the devil then come on now amen but you got to reach a place where you got to reach a place where he wants you to be and how you're going to reach that place is by his longsuffering towards you yes so time doesn't matter to Faith it it matters to us as human beings but it doesn't matter to Faith because faith is part of who he is Faith is not a human attribute faith is a Divine attribute that's what Peter tells us it's the very first of the Divine attributes that Peter lists that come from the divine nature the foundation of all other Divine attributes is Faith so time doesn't matter to Faith because faith is a part of who he is it's an attribute of the Eternal God so we we find then that to Faith our Salvation is already paid for our healing was already bought and paid for even before the lamb came here on the earth physically Christ came we know that we were he was crucified he was he was slain before the foundation of the world so even before we ever sin before we before Moses ever sin before David ever sinned before any of the others ever did anything wrong he was already slain in the mind of God in the Eternal in The Eternity so they could believe and have faith looking forward to what would happen and we have faith and believe Looking Back Time doesn't matter right to Faith yeah good very see the Bible tells us that Heaven and Earth shall pass away sir amen but my words shall not pass away Jesus said he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life someone say has that's past tense brother random always points that out has eternal life and shall never come into the Judgment but has passed from death into life he said on that rock I stand tonight no matter how I feel or what the devil says am and we get all caught up in what the devil says that people come brother Ben the devil's just been beating up on me this week and I feel for you he'd been beating up on me too but that's his job right you realize he'd be out of work if he didn't have Christians to beat up on right and some you know he's going to be unemployed for a thousand years you might as well let him you might as well you know he he's going to he got to that's his job but you don't have to let him do it to you right he's got plenty of people to work on let him go work on somebody else but to you you believe the word yeah he said well well the devil makes me feel bad that again that's his job but it's the word that makes you feel better again it's your faith in the word of God that no matter how you feel yeah you still believe right he said no matter what the devil says God's word Heaven and Earth will pass away but that word will never pass away he said I trust his word nothing else I know but his word that's what I believe in yeah oh Hallelujah do you believe it this morning I don't know how I feel he said the devil would make me feel sometimes I wasn't saved and the devil makes me feel I wasn't healed I don't care what he says I can beat him on that word every time right so it's just like you know I I talked to you about playing chess before I like to play chess and it's always funny to me when you get somebody trash talking you before they play chess I'm sorry some of y'all play Real Sports I play chess you get somebody trash talking before you get to play in chess like some of y'all do with volleyball or something and it'd be the equivalent excuse me of me trash talking somebody on volleyball right or basketball y'all know I can't play you can look at me and see I can't play right and in chess they have ratings right so I I this guy you he's trash talking me and I'm sitting there thinking you know I'm I know that my rating is 100 points higher than yours you are not going to beat me if you do it's because I got distracted right or somebody called or somebody you're not going to beat me just just on your merits alone right if you beat me it's going to be my fault because your Score says what you are oh God and listen to me when it comes to the word of God when it comes to the devil when he tries to tempt you and he tries come what did Jesus do Jesus didn't have to do a miracle he didn't have to stand there and say well I'm I'm going to pray for a while have an all night pray no what did he do when the devil come to tempt him what did he say he said he said but it it's also written he brought the word of God to the fight why because he knew that the word of God Amen was was always defeat the devil on every place every time under every condition right so are you with your little 200 rating right you're going to come trash talk me and say well I'm going to beat you well no you're not and I'm not going to beat the guys that have a 1500 rating I'm not going to do it it would be a it would be an accident if I did and the only way the devil can beat you is because of what we let him do oh my you you you have a word that's Ed so much higher than what his word is what he says so Jesus proved that in the wilderness now brother B said I say it's thus sayith the Lord look at that boy yes sir you can't move that so you can come to the devil and say devil look at that you can't move that you might be able to make me feel bad but you can't move that you might be able to make me feel down about everything going on but you can't move I wish somebody would preach with me this morning you can't move that we got to come to that place he said take him at his word believe it confess it no matter how you feel believe it anyhow he said so Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness the baby never come till 25 years later but he still give God praise for it before it came he was strong in faith giving praise to God he said that's it but you look at your symptoms said just a minute you look at your symptom you say well look here I was prayed for for a crippled hand my hand is no better that's no sign you're not healed God said so that's it no matter what that hand takes place it's what God Said It Ain't from my hand it's what God Said I accepted it I'll stay with it that's all so now he could open it up for today tomorrow might be 25 years but you let your testimony be positive all right every time you get sick you were prayed for you go out and get a little sick you say well I guess I lost my healing then your testimony becomes negative listen to this church and Jesus can't say no more for you now what does the scripture say he's the high priest of our confession so he can only intercede for us when we confess what we possess that's right which is faith which is based on the word so he can only intercede when we make a positive confession on the word amen and and you say well I don't know why he hasn't healed me well I wonder if you've allowed him the opportunity to intercede for you or if it's just constant negativity I'm preaching to myself too I I've told you before my nickname growing up was eore and not because I look like a donkey but because because of how sad I was all the time and and it that was my nickname and so I I I realize what a difficult thing it can be to look at the positive and to believe the the right thing but he's still the high priest of My Confession and I F found out brother JT when I begin to confess the word of God when I begin to not look at the symptoms listen if if I look just at the people in the church I might get discouraged yeah right just being honest with you if you just look at your pastor you might get discouraged right but if you look at the word the word is Right 100 times out of a 100 come on 100 times out of a 100 not 99 out of 100 100 times out of 100 look at the word the pastor might be wrong he might say something wrong the church might be wrong they might say or do something wrong but the word is always right and so we speak in a way so that he can intercede for us right right right when you say well I'm not I'm not worthy he can't intercede on that I'm I I I'm I've been too I've done too many bad things I can't be saved he can't intercede on that what does he intercede on our faith our confession are you still with me this morning I got a few more minutes he's the high priest of our confession sitting there making in intercession on your confession what you believe brother brandom said all of you in here that's saved tonight you just get in your head you're not saved and go around saying no I'm not saved no more he said then you're not saved come on he said that's a big word for a Baptist isn't it but that's true your backslid whenever you do that right that's right he said I believe you can backslide see but you've got to have your testimony your confession positive not according to my feelings but according to what he said good look planets materialized based on what he said now we either believe that or we don't right everything we saw the other day happened because God said let there be light and there was right now if planets respond to a positive confession of the word what will our body do which is made from the dust of the earth when we have a a positive uh confession of the word now brother now it's a strange thing that this is so much the thought of people they say well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you mustn't never say that I believe we got to be positive not just about ourselves but about our church body let's be positive about one another don't let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time someone say all the time I am saved I have God in my heart I believe him with all my heart you believe in Divine Healing with all of my heart you said my brother Ben I struggle with depression so did brother brandom he called it the blues every seven years he'd struggle with that but he said I'm saved anyway I'm Healed anyway I believe anyway I'm going to keep preaching anyway I'm going to do what's right anyway God didn't cast him away from being a prophet because he got down sometimes we all get down sometimes but it's what we believe it's what we confess sir he said let your testimony always your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it sir he said when it starts that don't entertain it so in other words set up boundaries where for to come in if you can help in other words don't listen to bad stuff on purpose right worst thing you can do sometimes when you got something wrong with you is go on the internet and research it that cold can turn into cancer real quick right and you can really there could be a real problem for you he said don't ENT don't don't don't let it come in now but if you if it comes in because we all know the devil has access to our minds it's a Battleground he says if it comes in don't entertain it right and I preached about that many times but you get that thought flies over and you set up a nest for it got a little birdhouse for negative thoughts right we had a squirrel problem here a while ago at our house squirrel problem you know why we had a squirrel problem we had a squirrel feeder that's why we had a squirrel problem and so the squirrels were messing up everything brother Danny and I finally said why are we putting corn in the squirrel feeder they got they got stuff all over the porch they it just made a mess of everything made the dogs bark all the time and all we had to do brother Caleb is quit putting corn in the squirrel feeder and the bird or the squirrels didn't come back no more quit making a bird house for that negative thought to fly in and come take possession right don't entertain it pass it on amen he said you can't help you can't help thoughts when they come he said well you say I can't help the thoughts from coming said be like the farmer said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but it could sure stop them from roosting you can't help the thoughts when they come but don't entertain them just pass it on no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm going to testify of them and God can only bless you as you confessed it he has done it for you see he's the high priest of our confession is that right he said he's the high priest of our confession he can only do for us as we accept it and believe it and confess it amen hallelujah he say Well when Jesus was here people didn't have to have faith well that's not true what would he tell them he said according to your faith right they were only healed according to their faith in the word he was the word now watch when Jesus departed then in Matthew 9:27 two blind men fought him crying saying thou son of David have mercy on us and when he was coming to the house the Blind Men came to him and Jesus said unto them believe you that I'm able to do this they said to him yay Lord then touch ye their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you according to your faith be it unto you and you might say this this morning you might say well if Faith was enough why why did he touch them now hang with me for just a minute have you got a few more minutes I've got a a few more minutes so why did he touch them why do the woman have to touch the himem of His Garment now we know she touched you by faith why do we have prayer claws why do we have prayer lines Why why do we do that we just take it all by faith now we know in the beginning before the spoken word could take effect there was something else happening how how many know Genesis 1:1 right in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God Amen moved moved upon the face of the waters that word moved and I preached it many times but that word is the same word you find in Deuteronomy where it says as the eagle stirreth its nest yeah flut over her young fluth is moved Broods Broods over amen the eagle Broods over young the spirit of God rooted over the Earth and God said let there be light and there was light now brother brandom says your bodies was laying here when the Holy Ghost began to brood in the first place if it didn't where did it come from your your all these materials he said Patrol life here on the earth God has put you together no one else could do it you can't get potes and calcium and pull it together and make a man it takes the spirit of the life of God to come into the man to make him what he is he said my friends don't you be deceived God doesn't run his church upon intellectuals it's the brooding of the Holy Ghost so it's not you just saying well I I have faith I have faith I have faith no God Broods by the Holy Spirit In Our Lives what is he doing he's creating an atmosphere of Faith right now watch it's the brooding of the Holy Ghost trying to say Do You Love Me Do You Believe Me Hallelujah and he said if he brought me what I am without me having any choice how much more will he give me back my life with eternal life with it if I brood back to him and say Yes Holy Spirit I don't care what the world says I love you I love you I love you oh if we can only do that this morning Lord I love you I'm brooding back to you if there's a response if he could bring me here naturally without a response how much more could he bring me spiritually with a response when I respond to the word of God I say yes Lord do you realize how much better Services you could have if you just respond with a positive confession to the word and say I believe what the prophet said I believe what my pastor's preaching I believe what the word says I believe it's the truth if you have a positive confession say Amen once in a while I know in the back I can't hear their amens so they've made amen signs back there there it is what is that it's a positive confession and Y all sitting out here you don't have to have a sign but you can you can sit here and say Amen what am I saying I'm broing back to him I'm not saying that for the preacher I'm saying that for the to the word word Jesus I love you Holy Spirit I don't care what the world says I love you I love you I love you how much more will he watch the calcium and poish in that great day he will speak and that body flash back again every hair on the head every bit of the oh I love that let me just stop there a while I don't mean as much to some of y'all as it does to me oh but every hair on my head if listen if he's brooding over the if he brooded over the the Earth without my choice without me having a choice to respond he broed over the Earth and brought me out of the Earth how much more can he brw over my body and bring my hair back like it was Hallelujah did you believe he can do that absolutely he can I've seen him do it I've seen him do it naturally and I believe one day he'll do it by the by a new body he'll do it that way every hair on my head every bit of the strength that was in my body when The Immortal Life will come forth again he said yes brother God gave the Holy Ghost a job of taking care of the church right we can only speak Faith as his spirit moves us right does that make sense we our positive confession is not just a dry-eyed confession it's not just saying well it's not a it's not an intellectual confession but it's a confession being moved being inspired by the brooding of the Holy Ghost and we know when the evil spirit goes out of a man he walks in dry places and brother Bram talks about that he said the reason you have your ups and downs is when the unclean Spirit goes out that's just as far as you go you get a new heart or something other words you clean things up you got a face to show you got something you put on a little something outside and when he comes back he finds you still living in an old Tin Can Alley with all your temper all your indifference yes and everything now I'm just going to illustrate this we had a a man when I was growing up named Bob ma bob ma may have been the the smartest man and the wealthiest man in Vernon County he was he was quite a man and he he was a if you talk to him he was a very intellectual man he was a college graduate and he he was a a nice man had a good character about him but I watched Bob maber over the years growing up yeah and he inherited a house from his parents yeah and Bob ma had a problem and thus said he couldn't quit picking up other people's trash so what he would do is he would go and he would go down the street and he had an old station wagon that he drove uh and and had a bike rack on top of it I believe if I'm remembering correctly an old car and he would drive down the road whenever he'd see trash he felt compelled to pick it up so he picked up 10 cans and he picked up he picked up garbage and he picked up newspapers hundreds and hundreds of newspapers and he picked up he picked up soda cans and he was always by the side of the road and it obsessed him so much he never got married he never his house literally fell down around him as the as the piles of trash got bigger his house got smaller or at least it appeared that way and his roof fell in he put a tarp over it and kept picking up trash that's right his his electricity got turned off he he he just lit a candle and kept picking up trash his car quit working he rode a bike and kept picking up trash and he lived to be I think 80 something years old and he finally died by getting hit by a car ironically on the side of the road picking up trash not his own trash other people's trash now I'm going somewhere with this see the devil finds us living in tenan alley and the reason we can't keep the victory is because we go around picking up everybody else is trash woo I had some amens what is that negative thoughts negative testimonies they don't they don't love me they don't care about me yeah the preach that old preacher he don't he probably don't live it anyway that old that old song leader they don't like me they don't ever call on me that that old person you know what you're doing you're picking up trash it's trash it's not doing you any good all them people back there they hurt me it's just trash come on why why do you feel compelled to hold on to it all right why do you feel compelled to hold on to live among the trash oh God I pray that somebody get a revelation today and begin to burn the thing down Let the Fire of the Holy Ghost come by and set fire to that pile of trash and burn it down all them negative thoughts what what mama said what daddy said what somebody else said about me burn it down let the Holy Spirit come and take that away from your life brother Bron when the Holy Ghost moves in oh I'd like to seen the Holy Ghost move in Bob May house when the Holy Ghost Moves In God sends his big bulldozer down from heaven and he turns that thing upside down scrapes it all off tees it out and you know because he's there there ain't no more 10 cans there there ain't no more hatred there come on Church there ain't no more malice there oh you don't know what so and so did to me let the Holy Ghost burn it out let that great bulldozer of the Holy Ghost come in and scrape it out of your life start making a positive confession paint that house put a roof on it we're collecting 10 cans are you with me now amen the BR City he finds a great big mansion that the Holy Ghost is living in and because it's there his presence there brings up oh I love that his presence there the atmosphere that he creates once he abides brings up big beautiful flowers all around on the Terrace flowers of love and joy and peace you want to collect something let some flowers grow in your yard flowers of love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness so that's not a pig pin any longer it's a place where the Holy Ghost [Applause] dwells Hallelujah Bob mayy couldn't keep the victory because he had to collect trash it was just it was a compels or compulsion whatever whatever it is that that that is but it's something that he was compelled to do but you and I we don't collect trash we want love joy and peace in our lives we've been taught to get rid of that thing somebody know throws on 10 can in your yard what do you do well first you get mad who were they throw a ten can myard sometimes I get a little upset people throw stuff off the you wait till you get to the church and then throw out your trash you throw it in the neighbor's yards you know throw it down in the marijuana store somewhere forgive me for say that but they throw it right out here why do you throw your trash out in the churchyard but what do you do you go pick it up you don't hold on to it well I'll tell you what that that's the one they threw at me what would you think of me I'm just preaching this morning I I'm gonna quit just a minute what would you think of me if I if I had all the trash we'd ever collected out here in the yard just brought it up here and I just start airing it out see that one I threw that out 10 years ago I wasn't even here 10 years ago but it was passed on to me 10 years ago every's one they threw out when I first my first day here somebody threw cigarette pack out here and here it is well I tell you what them people are bad I just keep it there to remind me how bad they are oh we got a dumpster that's where the trash goes is in the dumpster oh I pray that we take the dumpster today and drag it up to our houses and our lives and every every every negative thought Paul said cast It Down cast it away throw it in the trash it's garbage Let It Go where garbage goes qu holding on to it the rest of your life let God Purge it out of your life hallelujah it's not a pig pin any longer it's a place where the Holy Ghost dwells yes but the BR is going to show you how to unleash your positive confession let's look at this and I'll skip through this brother Robert I'm sorry but I got to save time the brand talked to him he said how many of you Believers is Believers raise your hand now this morning how many of you are believers I didn't ask if you were perfect but are you Believers God bless you for saying that he said then he he talked about how he said raise your hand and he talked he told them to put their hands on one another and and he's going to have them do as they told as he told them now he told them to be real quiet my brother BR says quiet in the message he said be be still be quiet a lot of times what he's talking about is he didn't want people moving around because the Holy Ghost was about to do something and I'll say this to in a service I know a lot of people don't want to interrupt the word so they wait till the till the altar call and then go out to the bathroom and I understand sometimes you have to do that but if you can it'd be better to go earlier interrupt me and interrupt the altar call if there is one because it's the spirit of God is moving at that time we need to be we need to recognize that try not to move around and that to you kids I I know sometimes we we we want to make sure that we don't interrupt the word and or but especially when the Holy Spirit is moving you watch that God might do something Supernatural someone's being prayed for close your close your eyes bow your head that's pray with them God might be doing something Supernatural I believe he does Supernatural things so he said brother Brown talked about how he's going to say the prayer he going to have them repeat it and he had them repeat this Lord God creator of heavens and earth author of everlasting life Giver of every good gift forgive my sins of unbelief give to me of thy mercy I believe in thee I accept the as my savior my only salvation I need your strength for my health I can't go forward without you I now accept you as my healer he said I renounce the devil in all of his works from this time hence forth I will think positive I will believe every promise the scripture that says by his stripes I was healed I now accept it I believe it it's mine said I thank you Lord I will continue to testifying of my healing until I'm perfectly [Applause] well now but he told him now they were testifying and they were saying it they repeated it but he said there was still something they needed to do he said now hold still keep your hands on one another you pray he said now shut yourself in with God you're going to see something happen he said all right brotherr ministers everybody are you ready if God will hear my prayer here he hears it anywhere he said now you prayed you made your confession just like you would coming as a Christian watch He's teaching healing the same way you believe as a Christian he said if if you're ready now he said if you was a sinner you're ready for baptism now being that you're a Christian you've made your confession right and now you're ready for healing so what what is it a confession you repent then you're baptized and then you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you confess your healing it's already been paid for and then you receive your healing right now he said what does it take now God is ready to give it to you there's just one thing above you that's a little thin Shadow of Doubt yeah now if we can break through that now he talked about how planes had to break through the jet Jets had to break through the sound barrier he said if they could ever get through he said they might wiggle and wobble but when they get through the sound barrier they fly smooth he said now if you can just rise yourself above that little doubt barrier there oh church that's what we that's what we need to do in our church services that's what we need to do in our homes rise up above that little doubt barrier oh brother what will take place you will run free you will be be healed he said I want you to be real reverent hold your hands to one another keep shut in with Christ like nobody is around you but him and just imagine your heart now you see him come walking right down to you standing right in front of you now open your heart and let him in he said well I pray and Cast Away this little Shadow Of Darkness over you when it breaks you out of the sound barrier then just rise and give him praise every time he said you when you feel your soul pass through that unbelief then you're free in Christ and he said heavenly father thank you for all that you've done for the many he and the fellowship and All Above All Things The Fellowship of the Holy Ghost he said you have not failed us one time but has told us the truth every time confirms your word with signs and wonders following he said now this little group of staggered to be here tonight he said to come here to see Jesus we've seen you we felt you we know you're here we got your word in our hearts he said they have confessed they have openly publicly confessed that they believe you confess that you believe and have accepted you as their healer he said now their souls are struggling Lord to get through that little barrier there little thing Yonder that's shaking them wonder if it could be me wonder if I'll be lost he said oh Lord May the power of Jesus Christ raise him up right now break away that barrier Satan get back you're losing the battle Let the church come through in the name of Jesus Christ Satan rise away from here he said I cast you out he said in the name of Jesus Christ rise to your feet and claim your healing claim your healing and all the barriers will go I wonder if we could do that this morning whatever we have let's make a positive confession let's stand to our feet and claim our healing amen this is the hour when we can accept it his spirit is here he's brooded over our lives let's just raise our hands to him and claim our healing in the name of the Lord oh you say if only brother Brandon was here to Cast Away that shadow of a doubt don't you realize the pillar of fire is here he said it would be the spirit and the word can't be separated if the word is here and his fullness he is the Holy Ghost he is here he said the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always and we
