[43:14] here Psalm 73 And1 a Psalm of Asaf truly
[43:18] God is good to Israel even to such as
[43:21] are of a clean heart but as for me my
[43:24] feet were almost gone my steps had well
[43:28] n slipped for I was envious at the
[43:31] foolish when I saw the prosperity of the
[43:34] wicked may the Lord bless his word this
[43:36] evening you can be
[43:38] seated just the thought of of centered
[43:40] upon the Revelation you know there's so
[43:43] many things that we can look at um even
[43:46] though God's a good God and has done so
[43:48] much for us there's things that we can
[43:50] look at and take our eyes off of that
[43:53] and so we must stay centered on Christ
[43:56] do you believe that there's so much uh
[44:00] to take our attention away from him
[44:03] right but there's a people I believe
[44:05] that and you give me just a little bit
[44:07] more monitor if it's too loud out there
[44:08] then don't do it but it might help me a
[44:10] little bit but there's a people I
[44:13] believe that is looking away from the
[44:16] sin and the systems and the kingdoms of
[44:18] this world and they are looking away to
[44:21] Jesus is that who you're looking to
[44:23] tonight we're not looking to A A Man A
[44:26] personality or someone that can figure
[44:28] something out amen we're looking away to
[44:30] Jesus amen and the Bible says that uh
[44:33] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[44:36] finisher of our faith amen he that that
[44:39] began a good work he will finish it and
[44:41] so that's who we're looking to tonight
[44:43] amen
[44:45] amen but the the Bible says here that
[44:48] that he's a a good God to those who are
[44:51] of a clean heart I believe that's who
[44:54] I'm preaching to tonight amen the the
[44:56] the clean and hard the sincere amen
[44:59] those that have been purified by the
[45:01] blood amen emptied themselves out from
[45:04] the world from the things of the world
[45:06] that God could come and feel that God
[45:08] could come and move and so he's a good
[45:10] God to those that are clean in heart and
[45:13] that word heart there is the inner man
[45:15] it's the will that inner man that part
[45:18] of you the soul the understanding amen
[45:22] it's it's the heart of man where where
[45:24] where uh the mind and the knowledge and
[45:27] thinking the reflection the memory there
[45:28] the the definition is it's it's who you
[45:31] are it's the inside of you and so that's
[45:34] where God come and meets the man he
[45:36] chose the heart of man uh Satan chose
[45:39] the the Mind amen but God chose the
[45:42] heart and that's where God will come and
[45:44] meet you is in that inner part of that
[45:47] man that inner part of that Soul amen
[45:50] and that Soul feeds upon the word of God
[45:53] that's the only thing that a that a born
[45:55] again believer Soul that's that's the
[45:58] only nourishment that it can get us from
[46:00] the word of God Amen we we can feed our
[46:03] bodies with with with food and we've got
[46:05] to do that and and these spirits that we
[46:07] have you know we we like to enjoy things
[46:09] of life and entertainment different
[46:11] things there's nothing wrong with that
[46:12] but too much of that amen the inner man
[46:15] it just don't do nothing for him right
[46:18] and so but but God is a good god to
[46:20] those that are of a clean
[46:23] heart but we look here Christ is the
[46:26] mystery of God revealed he said he
[46:29] should be then he should be the
[46:31] Principal yes and if that's what he is
[46:33] and and we don't believe we believe it
[46:35] don't we he says then if he is that then
[46:37] he should be the Principal theme of our
[46:39] talking of our thinking of our singing
[46:42] our walks he should be the Principal
[46:44] theme of our life and he if he's the
[46:46] principal theme of The Bible and the
[46:49] Bible's in us then he should be the
[46:51] Principal thing of everything we do it
[46:54] should be Christ he said is that right
[46:57] is that is that what you think tonight
[46:59] is that what you believe tonight amen
[47:01] amen amen he is the principal theme of
[47:04] the scripture amen if you look at the
[47:06] scripture it's Redemption all the way
[47:08] through and he's the only one that could
[47:10] bring Redemption to you and I amen he is
[47:13] the principal thing every every
[47:15] individual in the Bible everything they
[47:17] lived out was a shadow and a
[47:19] representation of him amen and you and I
[47:22] as a bride in this last days amen amen
[47:25] he's got to live through you he's got to
[47:27] reflect himself through you and
[47:29] I sir come on yes so he should be the
[47:34] Principal thing I I just I think that's
[47:36] so good amen centered upon Christ it's
[47:39] about him it's it must be about him
[47:43] good we look here this Psalm written by
[47:48] Asaf and Asaf there if if you read he
[47:52] was a chief levite musician under King
[47:55] David and so he was a minister of
[47:59] worship and of the law of Moses and
[48:02] there at the right hand of Authority
[48:04] Under The King under King David he led
[48:07] the people in worship and understanding
[48:10] of the law of Moses and so I I believe
[48:13] that amen there's power when we worship
[48:16] under God's revelation of the day that
[48:19] we live and under that is a power Amen
[48:21] to to change lives under that is a is a
[48:24] power and an atmosphere like none under
[48:27] that as a is a power to bring us amen
[48:29] from down here to up here to bring us
[48:32] higher into what we should be under
[48:34] God's revelation of the hour right and
[48:38] so but Satan wants to destroy that come
[48:42] on now Satan hates Revelation and we'll
[48:44] get into that just a little bit sat and
[48:47] Satan understands worship yeah and knows
[48:51] what it means to be at God's right hand
[48:54] of authority and power he's held that
[48:56] position
[48:57] so he understands that but the iniquity
[49:00] in him caused him to fall from that
[49:04] estate and so Satan did not have the
[49:08] character to handle his position and so
[49:11] he will attack those in leadership even
[49:13] differently than others because he has
[49:16] been in that place of authority amen
[49:18] he's been in a place where he's LED
[49:20] worship so he understands these things
[49:22] and he knows how to attack and try to
[49:25] pull on those people that's why the
[49:27] Bible says we should pray for our
[49:28] leaders we should pray for pray for your
[49:31] pastor pray for those that are in
[49:32] authority and Leadership roles but in
[49:35] that position he deceived and caused
[49:38] many to fall from their place that God
[49:40] had called them to
[49:41] be and so we're talking about being
[49:44] staying centered and we've got to stay
[49:46] centered on on what God has called us to
[49:48] be he got those angels that were created
[49:51] to
[49:52] worship God that's what they were
[49:54] created to do and to be was to worship
[49:56] ship God he got their eyes on something
[49:59] that seemed better than what the
[50:02] Perfection God had designed for them and
[50:06] so just go along with me here a little
[50:07] bit like Joel said this morning we we
[50:09] got an extra hour of sleep so nobody
[50:11] should be tired nobody don't don't go to
[50:14] sleep on me this early and so I I will
[50:17] read everything in here all the way
[50:19] through if I got to go ahead so don't
[50:23] just stay with
[50:25] me so in that position he deceived and
[50:29] caused many to fall from their place
[50:31] that God had called them to be he got
[50:33] their their eyes on something different
[50:35] than what God had designed for them he
[50:37] defiled their hearts and got them away
[50:40] from the worship of God and so I believe
[50:43] we are by God's design here this evening
[50:47] we are here by God's predestinated plan
[50:50] amen as those fell as those fell amen
[50:54] under that Authority that he had being
[50:56] at the right hand of God and the
[50:57] influence that he had I believe we are
[51:00] here to stand in this hour we are
[51:02] predestinated to stand and not to fall
[51:04] from our position amen and I believe
[51:07] tonight if we get knocked down amen if
[51:10] we get knocked down there's a Grace
[51:12] there's Grace and there's Redemption
[51:13] Amen to pick us all back up amen you
[51:16] don't have to stay down you don't have
[51:18] to stay down if Satan brings you down
[51:20] amen there's a way up amen Grace has
[51:22] provided a way back up for each and
[51:24] every one of us do you believe that amen
[51:27] but we look here and I just appreciated
[51:30] our sister singing tonight and and did
[51:32] didn't you enjoy that amen let's give
[51:34] them a hand clap I I just appreciate
[51:37] these these young people and and their
[51:39] desire to to worship and to sing amen
[51:42] Praises but we look here and brother
[51:44] Joel said something this that triggered
[51:46] this and I added this in my notes but
[51:48] you know brother randam had a vision and
[51:51] a preview of the bride and so in that
[51:54] vision and in that preview there he saw
[51:57] he describes it he saw the Asian church
[51:59] and and as it would come by it was just
[52:01] filth right and as it goes on there
[52:05] there the European Church came by and it
[52:07] was just it was just filth and and there
[52:10] then he describes Miss America in the
[52:12] beauty that she was but there she came
[52:15] dancing and and to the beat of rock and
[52:17] roll he said it was just absolute filth
[52:20] and there he be to describe of of of the
[52:23] feeling that he had and that that this
[52:24] was all that we could produce as men
[52:26] ministers and amen this is this is all
[52:28] that we could that we've got to present
[52:30] to him and so yes sir come on now we
[52:34] look there and and as the vision goes on
[52:36] he says and as they marched they dropped
[52:38] off they begin to drop off to a certain
[52:41] place and I so appreciated our sisters
[52:43] singing and I this just uh it does good
[52:47] to my heart to see them but and that I
[52:49] added this in there but in the Rapture
[52:51] he said then I heard something like
[52:52] Onward Christian Soldiers and I looked
[52:55] and here come a sainted bunch of girls
[52:57] just exactly like they was all correctly
[52:59] dressed their hair hanging down way down
[53:02] on their back smooth and clean marching
[53:04] to the step of the Gospel amen I'm
[53:07] thankful to have a young people like
[53:09] that a church of people that believe the
[53:11] word that can that can stand in this
[53:13] part of the vision amen and he said they
[53:16] were stepping to the step of the Gospel
[53:18] he said she was the word amen they look
[53:21] like one out of every nation amen and I
[53:23] was looking as it passed by and seen
[53:25] them pass by and instead of set instead
[53:28] of going down they started to go up and
[53:30] he said I noticed get listen to this I
[53:32] noticed one of them two or three of them
[53:34] trying to get out of line I scream stay
[53:37] in line and the vision left me and he
[53:39] said the vision left me and I was still
[53:41] screaming stay in line if we can
[53:44] reiterate that tonight stay in line stay
[53:47] centered upon the revelation of god of
[53:49] what he's called you to be and and who
[53:51] he is and who he's called you to be stay
[53:54] in line yes sir don't look at the world
[53:58] take your eyes off the world Amen look
[54:01] unto Jesus the author and the finish of
[54:03] your faith amen amen as that church as
[54:06] that church was dropping off I believe
[54:08] I'm I'm preaching to individuals tonight
[54:10] that's going up amen amen they they've
[54:13] been dressed in the word they are the
[54:14] word and we're going
[54:16] up
[54:18] amen yes sir yes sir stay in line yes
[54:22] sir amen but we look at America
[54:26] 1956 brother R said America rejected the
[54:29] gospel right amen as bad as we wanted I
[54:33] I went and voted for Donald
[54:35] Trump as bad as we want it I don't even
[54:39] know if he can do any good now that's
[54:41] right I mean what's it
[54:43] matter you know it's going it's leaning
[54:47] more towards evil as time goes on right
[54:51] we want to try to have as the best life
[54:53] we can we understand that's why went
[54:54] voted for the man but
[54:56] but it's all in God's control right but
[55:00] we know that this nation has rejected
[55:02] the gospel there's no Revival coming for
[55:04] it there's no coming back amen we can
[55:07] try to hold on to the little bit of of
[55:09] the idea of of America and what what it
[55:12] what it was when we grew up but those
[55:14] days are really long
[55:17] gone and so they turn down the gospel
[55:21] they turn down their Revival and we look
[55:24] at America America America the American
[55:28] Spirit is the spirit of of laughter and
[55:30] Frolic and entertainment and so if we
[55:33] get caught up in that and you can get
[55:35] caught up in that I can get caught up in
[55:36] it you can get caught up in it amen if
[55:39] you find yourself caught up in it amen
[55:41] begin to direct your attention back to
[55:44] the Revelation begin to uh direct your
[55:46] attention back to the vision amen that I
[55:49] just read read amen and realize that
[55:51] you're living in that Vision right now
[55:53] we're living and we're walking amen
[55:56] making footsteps amen walking in that
[55:58] Vision so stay in line don't get caught
[56:01] up in the spirit the American
[56:06] Spirit in
[56:08] 1955 he says but you take the the people
[56:11] of a whole in America they're wellfed
[56:14] per purred he said they don't have to
[56:16] worry about anything they've got all the
[56:18] money they thousands of millions of
[56:19] dollars big Fine Cars summer homes
[56:22] they've got everything they don't have
[56:24] to worry
[56:27] well what's religion to them just a
[56:28] place to sit around well and say well I
[56:30] belong to a church and he said and
[56:32] they'll find the highest and most
[56:34] practical church that they can they they
[56:37] they can go to yeah you know they're not
[56:39] going to drive an hour and a half to go
[56:41] to church they're going to go to the the
[56:43] nearest one they can find that's got the
[56:46] class of people that they want to be
[56:48] identified with what's most practical
[56:51] what makes the most sense what where am
[56:53] I going to go that I'm not going to get
[56:54] preached at that I'm not going to get
[56:56] hammered at and and chastised and amen
[56:59] and shaped up to be a son or daughter of
[57:00] God they don't want nothing to do with
[57:02] that because they've got everything they
[57:04] need and that's the spirit of this age
[57:06] amen they're rich and increased with
[57:08] goods and have need of nothing amen
[57:10] that's the spirit that we're that that
[57:13] of the age and the age that we live in
[57:15] that's the effects amen that Tred to
[57:16] come upon us but Center be centered on
[57:20] the Revelation in this hour don't don't
[57:22] fall for that yes but it brother says
[57:26] here he says and did you know that's the
[57:28] very sign of Satan I hope we don't get
[57:31] too rough about it he said in heaven
[57:33] what made Lucifer jealous he goes into
[57:35] the the North and puts up a better
[57:37] Kingdom he wanted a bigger uh Kingdom a
[57:39] more broader better prettier he said the
[57:42] devil always works in Beauty he said
[57:44] that's the reason Cain offered what he
[57:47] did for his offering so Cain what did
[57:49] Cain do he brought the fruits of the
[57:51] field he he brought what he could bring
[57:54] what he could produce and and no doubt
[57:55] it looked beautiful it looked pretty but
[57:58] it wasn't the spiritual Revelation that
[58:00] God desired and that God wanted and he
[58:02] goes on to say but there was no Beauty
[58:04] in Abel bringing his lamb but Abel had a
[58:07] spiritual revelation of God and that's
[58:10] what would that God would be pleased
[58:12] with and as and as he said only through
[58:15] spiritual Revelation can you ever know
[58:17] God you'll never know him by knowledge
[58:20] and you look there even when when uh
[58:23] when Kain killed his brother and he said
[58:26] if you'll not do right will you not be
[58:28] accepted also but it wasn't in that
[58:31] serpent seed to be able to do what was
[58:34] right he could look upon what what Abel
[58:36] his brother done by spiritual Revelation
[58:39] he could look at it but he could never
[58:41] do it and brother Brandon would say
[58:43] Satan knows the will of God but he
[58:45] refuses to do
[58:47] it right oh my so it's not for them it's
[58:52] hidden from the eyes of the wise and
[58:54] prudent we're talking about Revelation
[58:55] here spiritual Revelation can only be
[58:58] received Amen to babes such as would
[59:01] learn be thankful tonight amen that you
[59:03] can learn from the revelation of God
[59:05] amen amen and that's the only way to
[59:07] know Jesus Christ is by the revelation
[59:11] of the Holy Spirit he's not known by
[59:13] Flesh and Blood right right amen and
[59:15] that's the evidence of the day amen of
[59:18] the Holy Ghost that you can receive the
[59:20] word for your day amen that in itself is
[59:23] the evidence that you can receive the
[59:25] revelation of the hour that you live in
[59:28] and that he is truly the same yesterday

[1:00:12] scriptures there Asaf he he was envious
[1:00:15] when he saw the foolish when he saw the
[1:00:18] prosperity of the wicked and so Satan
[1:00:21] wants us to take our sight off of God's
[1:00:24] Will and program for our lives but you
[1:00:27] can't look and that's s we it's too late

[1:19:56] now well not slipped he began to look
[1:19:59] look at the world look at the
[1:20:01] wickedness and the Bible says he became
[1:20:03] envious at the foolish when he saw the
[1:20:06] prosperity of the wicked he said how
[1:20:08] they're not troubled and plagued as
[1:20:10] other men he said goes on in that in
[1:20:13] that chapter he said the pride their
[1:20:14] pride compasse them about as a
[1:20:17] chain so what happened ASAP begin to
[1:20:21] take his eyes off the goodness and the
[1:20:23] blessing of God to his people he began
[1:20:27] to look at the hardness of the people
[1:20:28] who didn't know or serve God and things
[1:20:31] always seem to go their
[1:20:33] way you you know what I'm talking about
[1:20:37] they go there and in in that in that
[1:20:39] chapter it says they say how does God
[1:20:42] know is there knowledge in the most high
[1:20:45] so this is the attitude of the world
[1:20:47] this is the attitude of of the world and
[1:20:49] and the and and what they're living in
[1:20:51] and what they're
[1:20:53] portraying on
[1:20:55] but he said behold these are the ungodly
[1:20:57] who prosper in the world who increase in
[1:21:00] riches and and he goes on he said within
[1:21:03] himself verily I have cleansed my heart
[1:21:05] in vain for all the day long I have been
[1:21:08] plagued and chastened every morning that
[1:21:12] word chasing there is rebuke correction
[1:21:14] punishment
[1:21:16] Ching right you ever you ever feel like
[1:21:18] that that's just all it is to you
[1:21:20] sometimes amen but that's a sign that
[1:21:22] you're a son or a daughter of God
[1:21:24] because every son or daughter of God
[1:21:26] amen amen amen must must come under this
[1:21:29] chastisement must come under this
[1:21:31] correctiv of God amen amen the Bible
[1:21:34] says when we are judged when we are
[1:21:35] chasen of the Lord amen that word chasen
[1:21:38] when you're taught when you're
[1:21:40] instructed that we should not be
[1:21:42] condemned with the
[1:21:44] world Amen I'm chastised they're always
[1:21:48] telling me what I'm doing wrong and but
[1:21:50] that's God's corrective love because he
[1:21:52] doesn't want you to be judged by the
[1:21:54] world or with the
[1:21:59] world so he was troubled Asaf was
[1:22:02] troubled at the thought of the wicked
[1:22:04] just being able to get get by with
[1:22:06] anything questioning God and yet still
[1:22:09] being
[1:22:11] prosperous it bothered
[1:22:13] him and but the pure and heart are
[1:22:15] always are always um the pure in heart
[1:22:19] are always rebuked and ched they're
[1:22:21] always going to receive that
[1:22:23] chastisement because God God Amen God's
[1:22:25] love is corrective amen sometimes amen
[1:22:28] do you ever do you ever just stop and
[1:22:29] think what's really going on here you
[1:22:31] know what's really going I'm trying to
[1:22:33] live a Christian life according to the
[1:22:34] word and the message amen Things become
[1:22:36] so hard amen Things become so hard and
[1:22:40] we begin to look more at the seen than
[1:22:42] the Unseen amen but that's when our
[1:22:45] faith must be centered back on the word
[1:22:47] of God back on God's promise for our day
[1:22:49] I say quit looking at the things that's
[1:22:51] going on around you amen look to the
[1:22:53] inner man amen let that inner man amen
[1:22:56] be strengthened amen keep that inner Man
[1:22:58] strengthened by the word of God and of
[1:23:02] understanding I'll try to hurry
[1:23:06] here Psalm 73 and
[1:23:11] 16 he just ASAP just couldn't understand
[1:23:15] I go through all this I'm corrected
[1:23:17] constantly these people just have any
[1:23:19] old attitude and and they're they're
[1:23:22] continuously prospering
[1:23:25] but he says here when I thought to know
[1:23:27] this it was too painful for me until I
[1:23:30] went into the sanctuary of God then I
[1:23:33] understood
[1:23:35] therein therein amen he went into the
[1:23:38] sanctuary of God he went into the
[1:23:40] Tabernacle of God Amen he went into that
[1:23:43] secret place to get understanding Amen
[1:23:46] to settle the trouble that he had within
[1:23:48] himself amen he went to that sanctuary
[1:23:50] of God and there received understanding
[1:23:53] amen he shut himself self in Amen to get
[1:23:56] understanding amen and he's seen there
[1:23:58] he said there're set in Slippery places
[1:24:01] amen they will be cast down destruction
[1:24:03] he begin to see their End Amen they are
[1:24:05] brought into desolation as in a moment
[1:24:08] they are consumed with tears amen and
[1:24:10] the Bible says that God despises the
[1:24:12] image amen of the life that is hid away
[1:24:14] from them from him he despises their
[1:24:16] wickedness and their question against
[1:24:19] his knowledge and who he
[1:24:21] is he went to the temple of God he went
[1:24:24] to the Sanctuary to get understanding
[1:24:25] and he seen their end though their lives
[1:24:28] seem prosperous though this world
[1:24:30] continues to go on like it does Amen
[1:24:32] their end is destruction sir oh
[1:24:37] my Ephesians 515 see that you walk
[1:24:41] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[1:24:44] Redeeming the time because the days are
[1:24:48] evil wherefore be not unwise but
[1:24:50] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:24:52] is that word circumspectly means to walk
[1:24:54] diligently to walk perfect Amen to walk
[1:24:57] accurately Amen to walk in perfect faith
[1:25:00] and perfect love in
[1:25:03] him y'all got a little bit more
[1:25:08] time praise the Lord how much more time
[1:25:11] you
[1:25:12] got I ain't got my watch is that did we
[1:25:15] set that one up yes yeah I'm sure I'm
[1:25:19] sure we
[1:25:20] did so we wouldn't be messed up
[1:25:24] you love the Lord tonight amen It Ain't
[1:25:27] Easy getting up here preaching I'll tell
[1:25:29] you that right now it ain't
[1:25:34] easy
[1:25:36] amen love the Lord
[1:25:38] amen but brother BR says here the reason
[1:25:41] we don't have spiritual blessings he
[1:25:43] said we have too much time to watch
[1:25:45] television too much time to read the
[1:25:46] newspaper and to listen or to something
[1:25:48] that we ought not to be listening to and
[1:25:51] we're not Redeeming the time but we're
[1:25:53] giving into the things of the world
[1:25:55] instead of our time to the Lord Jesus
[1:25:57] and the Bible said that man shall not
[1:25:59] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:26:01] that proceedeth proceeded from the mouth
[1:26:03] of God he said Christians live on the
[1:26:06] word so redeem the time because the days
[1:26:08] are are evil but what is it today it's
[1:26:10] not so much newspapers and certainly
[1:26:13] television but but what is it it's the
[1:26:16] internet Facebook Instagram Snapchat
[1:26:20] I've got I've got every bit of that but
[1:26:23] we spend too much time time we spend too
[1:26:25] much time looking at other people's
[1:26:27] perfect life seems like it's perfect and
[1:26:31] thinking how everyone has it so good and
[1:26:33] and their lives are so perfect and
[1:26:35] Problem free and it brings a negative
[1:26:37] effect upon your spirit amen and I I say
[1:26:40] tonight that there's no strength there's
[1:26:42] no virtues in those things amen it's a
[1:26:45] complete waste of time amen those things
[1:26:48] I mean it offers no strength to the
[1:26:49] inner man there's no virtue there's no
[1:26:52] Grace anden there's no rapturing faith
[1:26:54] faith in any of
[1:26:55] that but Philippians 4 said finally
[1:26:58] Brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:26:59] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:27:02] things are just whatsoever things are
[1:27:03] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[1:27:05] whatsoever things of a good report if
[1:27:07] there being any virtue if there being
[1:27:08] any praise think on these things amen if
[1:27:11] you want to come out of the negative
[1:27:13] amen you've got to you've got to you've
[1:27:14] got to push towards the positive in this
[1:27:16] hour amen and these things amen that we
[1:27:19] spend too much time on we waste too much
[1:27:22] time on it's nothing but the negative
[1:27:24] amen there's no virtue there's no
[1:27:26] strength in it I say push tonight to the
[1:27:28] positive push towards the revelation of
[1:27:31] the hour amen medit meditate on Jesus
[1:27:34] Christ amen not just his word amen not
[1:27:36] just your favorite scripture but uh
[1:27:39] meditate on who he is who his power is
[1:27:42] who he's personally revealed himself to
[1:27:44] you
[1:27:46] sir we want to see more of God we want
[1:27:49] more of the blessings of God brother
[1:27:50] said he said meditate on him yes than
[1:27:54] about him and watch him come on the
[1:27:57] scene
[1:28:00] amen do we have time for
[1:28:03] that do I have time for it do we have
[1:28:06] time to sit still long enough and to
[1:28:09] come into the
[1:28:10] sanctuary come into His presence amen
[1:28:13] because there is where the blessings lie
[1:28:15] that's where rapturing Faith amen amen
[1:28:17] the faith and the strength that you need
[1:28:19] to walk in this hour you won't find it
[1:28:21] on the external but it will be in the
[1:28:23] internal on is where we find that that
[1:28:26] strength
[1:28:29] amen I say drop the negatives of this
[1:28:32] life drop the negative amen don't stay
[1:28:36] so much in the negative come into the
[1:28:40] positive I read this this morning I
[1:28:43] thought I thought it was so
[1:28:46] good brother Rand said here in questions
[1:28:48] and answer I'll try to hurry up all
[1:28:50] right I'll try to hurry up I'm lean over
[1:28:53] here like I'm
[1:28:54] about to be done but I'm really
[1:28:57] not all
[1:28:58] right this is pretty good all right
[1:29:01] listen to it okay don't go to
[1:29:04] sleep if you're older I understand if
[1:29:07] you're a little kid had too much candy
[1:29:11] you're coming off that Sugar I
[1:29:13] understand it's all
[1:29:15] right everybody else is not okay wake
[1:29:21] up he says here
[1:29:24] the question is an answer brother what
[1:29:25] shall we do something is settled over me
[1:29:27] that I cannot break through last fall I
[1:29:30] dreamed I was lost in white sand it was
[1:29:33] getting dark and I couldn't find my way
[1:29:36] and this dream has stayed with me since
[1:29:38] last fall I was as as one groping in
[1:29:40] darkness my son Irvin and wife were
[1:29:43] included in my dream they were also in
[1:29:45] darkness and we're in desperation I
[1:29:48] believe God will show you what it is
[1:29:49] what is in our hearts now he said if
[1:29:52] we're wrong or s in sinning places say
[1:29:54] tell us we want to be right sincere
[1:29:57] honest in heart pure in heart he said I
[1:30:01] I don't know the lady but I just feel
[1:30:03] that you're in here lady that here is
[1:30:06] your trouble you have let something
[1:30:08] happen to you that's just made you
[1:30:09] nervous because being in White Sands
[1:30:12] represents Purity and righteous and
[1:30:14] you're just letting Satan put one over
[1:30:16] on you you dream your dream prove that
[1:30:18] there's nothing wrong you're only
[1:30:20] nervous and by doing this and thinking
[1:30:22] this you're making the rest of your
[1:30:24] family nervous stop doing it claim your
[1:30:26] god-given rights your dream proves by
[1:30:29] the interpretation that you're in white
[1:30:31] sand everything's all right come on it's
[1:30:34] you yourself
[1:30:35] nervous he said you let one family
[1:30:38] member uh uh member of the family get
[1:30:39] nervous it goes right to the next member
[1:30:41] and the next member and the first thing
[1:30:43] you know we're all fussing and going on
[1:30:46] and one member of the family gets kind
[1:30:47] of upset about something he upsets the
[1:30:49] other and the other and the other the
[1:30:50] first thing you know the whole family's
[1:30:51] upset it's Satan yeah then if one member
[1:30:54] of the family rejoices let the rest of
[1:30:56] them Rejoice with it so every one of the
[1:30:58] family must try to do that you got to
[1:31:00] come out of the negative into the
[1:31:03] positive anden we she was spending too
[1:31:05] much time in that negative she had said
[1:31:07] last fall I had this dream I've been in
[1:31:09] this condition she was dwelling in the
[1:31:11] negative she was dwelling in that
[1:31:12] nervousness and that's all it was there
[1:31:14] wasn't no no sin or nothing like that
[1:31:17] they were in pure Sands they were in
[1:31:18] pureness in
[1:31:20] righteousness but she let it go on too
[1:31:23] long I hear a prophet explaining so good
[1:31:26] here he said try each one of you
[1:31:28] children to help your papa your mama
[1:31:30] mama papa you try to help your children
[1:31:32] don't let that gloomy unbelieving Spirit
[1:31:34] get around you you're Christians you're
[1:31:37] born of the spirit of God you're the
[1:31:39] salt of the earth you have god-given
[1:31:41] rights am me he said in the Bible said
[1:31:43] if there be any praise if there be any
[1:31:45] virtue think on these things amen don't
[1:31:48] think about the wrong sister I think
[1:31:50] that's your trouble sister dear she was
[1:31:52] thinking too much about the wrong amen
[1:31:54] come out of the negative in this hour
[1:31:56] Asaf begin to look at the negative amen
[1:31:58] but but there he he starts out amen

[1:32:03] is good amen to the pure in heart amen
