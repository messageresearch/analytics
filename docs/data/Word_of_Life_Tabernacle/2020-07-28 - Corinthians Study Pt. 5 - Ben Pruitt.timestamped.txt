[2:49] all right
[3:15] hello welcome to our bible study on
[3:18] first corinthians we've been
[3:20] doing these had been doing these for a
[3:21] while before
[3:24] when we were shut down for a little
[3:26] while as a church from being able to
[3:28] meet together
[3:28] but they were a blessing i think to some
[3:30] people we made it through chapter one
[3:33] uh last time so what i want to try to do
[3:35] is
[3:36] go through uh start at chapter two
[3:40] and uh if you wanna go back and review
[3:42] chapter one
[3:43] uh there's four videos on that uh that
[3:46] you can go
[3:47] and it's just titled corinthians chapter
[3:49] um
[3:50] our corinthian study parts one through
[3:53] four
[3:54] but that's chapter one uh chapter one uh
[3:57] taught us that god was faithful to
[4:00] correct the corinthian church
[4:02] that there were parties in that church
[4:05] so
[4:06] so we need to understand that this was a
[4:08] church that
[4:11] was god's church this was not a
[4:15] apostate church this was a true church
[4:18] but it was a church that had problems
[4:20] and i think we all want to be the
[4:23] ephesian church as i said before but i
[4:25] think the corinthian church
[4:26] is often where we find ourself living
[4:29] and the ephesian church was a model
[4:31] church but the corinthian church was
[4:33] also
[4:34] a church that belonged to god and so god
[4:36] was faithful to correct that church
[4:39] we found that the parties of paul and
[4:41] apollos and peter and christ were
[4:43] equally wrong
[4:45] um all of these and it was not that paul
[4:47] was wrong or
[4:49] apollos was wrong or that peter was
[4:51] wrong or especially we know christ
[4:53] we know he wasn't wrong but these
[4:56] men that followed them had made a
[4:59] division or a schism as paul says in the
[5:01] body and and the schism was wrong
[5:04] and so the book of corinthians deals
[5:06] with that and you'll see it all the way
[5:08] through the book from the beginning to
[5:09] the end
[5:10] that paul is constantly dealing with one
[5:13] of these
[5:14] factions in the church paul apollos
[5:17] peter and christ
[5:20] we found that the world already has
[5:22] entertainment
[5:23] they already have the ability to
[5:26] entertain themselves and we find that's
[5:28] true today
[5:29] and that greek world that paul was
[5:31] speaking to writing to was that way as
[5:33] well
[5:33] they don't need entertainment they need
[5:35] jesus
[5:36] so we have what they need and brother
[5:38] branham taught us that and we went
[5:40] through that
[5:40] we found that god does not call many
[5:42] wives noble or mighty not many
[5:44] philosophers not many
[5:46] great men so-called in the world today
[5:49] he doesn't call many strong men but he
[5:51] calls the weak and he calls the ignorant
[5:53] the unlearned and he calls them to
[5:56] proclaim his gospel
[5:57] to preach the gospel and so we thank god
[6:01] for that
[6:02] as jesus said he didn't call the the
[6:04] wise and the prudent but he
[6:06] called babies that would learn and so we
[6:08] thank god for that
[6:10] let's start with first corinthians
[6:12] chapter
[6:13] two first corinthians chapter two and
[6:16] verse one and hopefully uh some have
[6:17] been able to join us by now
[6:19] first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[6:21] if you're not able to join us live
[6:22] this will be archived later on you'll
[6:25] notice we're in a new location
[6:27] i'm at the church at the office in the
[6:30] church and i've got peter and esther
[6:32] here helping me do this today let's have
[6:34] a word of prayer before i begin reading
[6:35] in first corinthians chapter 2 and verse
[6:37] 1 heavenly father
[6:38] thank you for all that you do for us
[6:40] every day thank you for bringing us
[6:42] together again
[6:43] lord and through this bible study and i
[6:45] pray that those that would hear it
[6:47] and would watch it lord in the church
[6:49] would be blessed by it
[6:51] and that it would just give us a better
[6:52] understanding and a depth to our
[6:54] understanding of
[6:55] of the things that you brought us in the
[6:56] scriptures we thank you for all that you
[6:58] do
[6:59] we pray for each one that each one will
[7:00] be blessed in jesus name
[7:02] amen first corinthians chapter 2 and
[7:05] verse 1
[7:06] paul says and i brethren when i came to
[7:08] you came not with excellency of speech
[7:11] or of wisdom
[7:12] declaring unto you the testimony of god
[7:17] that word excellency is interesting it's
[7:20] an elevation preeminent superiority
[7:24] metaphorically excellent he said i
[7:26] didn't come to you in a way
[7:28] that would be described as anything
[7:30] special if we could put it like that
[7:33] anything out of the ordinary as far as
[7:36] my speech
[7:38] now the corinthian church had been
[7:39] exposed at this time to
[7:41] a man named apollos who was
[7:45] an extraordinary speaker and
[7:48] apollos and i don't want us to get the
[7:50] idea that apollos was a bad man
[7:53] because he was not he was a great uh
[7:56] preacher and a great evangelist of that
[7:58] time a great teacher of the word he was
[8:00] not a bad man but he wasn't paul
[8:02] and that's kind of what we'll be dealing
[8:04] with this and paul is defending himself
[8:06] and the way that he came
[8:07] he came in a certain way for a purpose
[8:10] because he was the messenger of that age
[8:12] and let's look at apollos for a moment
[8:14] apollos was
[8:16] um a certain jew in acts chapter 18 and
[8:19] verse 24 it calls him a certain jew
[8:20] named apollos and that's an interesting
[8:22] thing because
[8:23] apollos is a greek name so he must of
[8:26] like timothy had a had a greek influence
[8:29] in his life and he says he was born in
[8:31] alexandria which was the center of
[8:33] learning for the
[8:34] ancient world so he was born there where
[8:37] all of the wisdom of the ancient world
[8:39] would have been available to him
[8:42] and so it says that he was an eloquent
[8:44] man it means he spoke well
[8:46] and he was mighty in the scriptures that
[8:48] means that he knew
[8:49] what he was talking about as far as
[8:51] being a jew
[8:53] and it says that he came to ephesus so
[8:56] this is one of the factions in the
[8:58] corinthian church and we'll find out why
[9:01] in verse 25 it says this man was
[9:03] instructed in the way of the lord
[9:05] and this is acts 18 25. this man was
[9:08] instructed in the way of the lord
[9:10] so he had been taught well and he was
[9:12] fervent in the spirit which means that
[9:14] he was easy to listen to or
[9:16] he was exciting he spoke with passion
[9:19] about the things of god
[9:20] and that's the way we should speak and
[9:22] that's how apollos
[9:24] spoke to the people he spake and taught
[9:26] diligently on the things of the lord
[9:29] but he knew only the baptism of
[9:32] john so we did not recognize
[9:36] what had been done through christ and he
[9:38] did not recognize
[9:40] the authority or the power of being
[9:42] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[9:44] so he did not recognize these things he
[9:46] needed to be he needed to learn he
[9:47] needed to be taught
[9:48] there's two reasons why that people
[9:51] don't believe the message
[9:52] and some because they don't know many
[9:55] many because they don't know and some
[9:57] because they reject it
[9:58] and so apollos was not a rejecter he was
[10:01] not an apostate
[10:02] but he was a man who taught everything
[10:04] that he knew he was a good
[10:06] follower of john the baptist and his
[10:09] followers you find where paul later
[10:11] found some of his follower followers at
[10:13] i believe it was at ephesus
[10:14] he found his followers and he found that
[10:17] these
[10:18] followers had not come to the holy ghost
[10:20] because they didn't know that there was
[10:22] a holy ghost
[10:22] because they only knew john's baptism
[10:26] and so
[10:27] paul comes and challenges them and he
[10:28] says have you received the holy ghost
[10:30] since you believed and so that's an
[10:33] important thing now
[10:35] apollos though was a great speaker
[10:38] and in verse 26 it says he began to
[10:40] speak boldly in the synagogue
[10:43] whom when aquila and priscilla had heard
[10:45] so it's interesting because
[10:47] you can imagine that they're in this
[10:48] setting of
[10:50] of going to the synagogue and they come
[10:52] and they had a special speaker that
[10:54] saturday and it was a alexandrian jew
[10:58] and i'm sure they were excited to hear
[11:00] him was an eloquent man
[11:01] and come with much with
[11:05] much acclaim and he had much
[11:10] many people that thought well of him but
[11:12] when they went to hear him
[11:14] then they realized he doesn't know about
[11:16] jesus
[11:17] and so what did they do they brought him
[11:19] home for dinner and they began to talk
[11:21] to him and they expounded unto him the
[11:22] bible says the way of god more perfectly
[11:25] and brother branham kind of puts it like
[11:27] this and i'm paraphrasing but he said
[11:30] that aquila and priscilla found apollos
[11:33] and they said
[11:34] hang on a little bit paul's going to be
[11:35] in town after a while and he'll be able
[11:37] to tell you
[11:38] some things about about jesus that you
[11:41] just don't realize yet and
[11:43] and show you how the gospel has gone
[11:44] further and how light has
[11:46] has come further than what you
[11:48] understood
[11:50] so in verse 27 apollos and again this is
[11:53] important because this is one of those
[11:54] factions in the corinthian church if
[11:56] you're going to understand the book of
[11:57] corinthians
[11:58] you have to understand apollos and why
[12:01] they were so
[12:02] tied to him and it's a lot of what paul
[12:04] deals with
[12:06] in acts 18 27 it says when he was
[12:09] disposed to pass into ikaya
[12:11] the brethren wrote exhorting the
[12:12] disciples to receive him
[12:15] who when he was come helped them much
[12:18] so he was not just an eloquent speaker
[12:20] he was not just a
[12:22] a great speaker in that way but he was
[12:25] an
[12:25] effective speaker
[12:28] and in going back it said that he was
[12:31] instructed in the way of the lord he was
[12:32] fervent in spirit and he taught
[12:33] diligently the things of the lord
[12:35] and now it's saying that he helped him
[12:37] much so he was
[12:38] educated we could say he was revelated
[12:41] we could say he was dedicated he was
[12:44] fervent
[12:44] and we could also say that he was
[12:46] effective so he was a great he was a
[12:48] great minister there's no doubt about
[12:49] that
[12:51] so he helped them much who had believed
[12:54] through grace
[12:54] that's the kind of preacher that you
[12:55] want to have by now
[12:59] in acts 18 28
[13:02] it says for he might mightily he
[13:05] mightily convinced the jews
[13:07] he mightily convinced the jews so he was
[13:09] effective in his ministry
[13:11] in getting people to believe in christ
[13:12] that publicly showing by the scriptures
[13:15] that jesus was the christ
[13:20] you know apollos was a great preacher
[13:23] and i think it this really bears on on
[13:26] what we have today in
[13:27] in the message he's a great preacher but
[13:30] he wasn't paul
[13:32] and not being paul made
[13:35] a difference there's only one messenger
[13:37] to the age and no matter how much you
[13:39] respect your pastor or
[13:41] how much and i appreciate that or some
[13:43] other pastor you respect some man that
[13:45] preaches they are not the messenger to
[13:47] the age
[13:48] so no matter who might come after the
[13:51] messenger
[13:52] and who might be able to preach
[13:53] eloquently and help you understand the
[13:55] things of god
[13:56] they're not the messenger and to
[13:58] apollos's credit he never tried to make
[14:00] himself the messenger
[14:02] he never did that there was one
[14:03] messenger to the age and only one
[14:06] and there was only one man who could
[14:07] stand there and say if an angel
[14:10] from heaven preaches any other thing
[14:12] than what i've preached
[14:13] let him be accursed only one man could
[14:16] say that
[14:18] and that was paul but apollos
[14:21] willingly followed the message of paul
[14:23] as soon as he
[14:24] was aware of it now we don't know much
[14:28] about apollos after this
[14:31] there is a a note of in titus 3
[14:34] 13 that paul and apollos were working
[14:38] together and and most
[14:39] uh theologians believe that titus was
[14:42] written the book of titus was written
[14:45] from
[14:46] corinth so paul this is later after he's
[14:49] written the book of
[14:50] books of corinthians he comes back to
[14:52] corinth
[14:53] and apollos at that time was also back
[14:55] at corinth
[14:58] and paul gives him the letter to titus
[15:00] and so it says bring zenus the lawyer
[15:03] and apollos on their journey diligently
[15:05] so they were the carriers of the letter
[15:07] to titus
[15:08] nothing be wanting unto them it's
[15:10] interesting because we find that paul
[15:12] and apollos are still working together
[15:14] and it speaks greatly to the character
[15:16] of apollos that he understood and knew
[15:18] that he was not the messenger to the age
[15:21] but he stood behind the messenger of the
[15:23] age
[15:24] he was a great preacher he didn't quit
[15:25] preaching he didn't stop proclaiming the
[15:27] gospel
[15:28] but he wasn't paul and he understood
[15:30] that uh
[15:32] we'll find out later in the corinthian
[15:34] book of corinthians first corinthians
[15:36] that
[15:37] apollos actually would not come to
[15:40] corinth when paul wanted him to
[15:43] and the reason historians believe the
[15:45] reason was because he was so disgusted
[15:47] by the attitude of the people
[15:49] towards himself that they had elevated
[15:51] him to a position that he didn't want
[15:54] and so he refused to come to corinth
[15:55] even though paul desired him to
[15:58] said he wasn't his his desire to do that
[16:00] um
[16:01] the ancient writer jerome says that
[16:03] apollos was so disgusted by that
[16:04] attitude
[16:05] that he actually retired from ministry
[16:08] for a while
[16:09] but we know he and again we know he
[16:11] refused to come to corinth but he says
[16:12] he actually retired from ministry
[16:14] went away to his home for a while and
[16:17] then he eventually come back and and
[16:19] ended up back in corinth with paul so
[16:22] apollos was a great man
[16:23] he just wasn't paul and it's interesting
[16:26] that again in titus 3 13 that
[16:29] he's found carrying the message of paul
[16:32] so even though he was a great preacher
[16:34] and probably a better preacher than paul
[16:36] probably more eloquent than paul as far
[16:38] as the speaker
[16:40] but he carried the message of paul paul
[16:43] was the messenger of the age
[16:44] and even peter and apollos and all these
[16:47] other
[16:48] ones that certain ones that brought
[16:50] factions in their name
[16:52] recognize that paul had was given a
[16:55] dispensation of grace to the gentiles
[16:57] and was the messenger to that age
[17:02] first corinthians 2 2 verse 2 says for i
[17:05] determined
[17:06] and and we'll just go down a couple more
[17:08] verses here
[17:09] he says for i determined to not to know
[17:11] anything among you
[17:13] save jesus christ and him crucified
[17:17] we think i purposefully put everything
[17:20] else out of my mind
[17:21] except for jesus christ
[17:25] and him crucified
[17:28] now the greek implies there that the
[17:30] only
[17:32] definite thing that i made it my
[17:33] business to know among you
[17:36] this is that next slide the only
[17:39] definite thing that i made it my
[17:40] business to know among you was to know
[17:42] jesus christ and i put this on here so
[17:45] you would see
[17:46] there's two things i want to know christ
[17:49] that's the person
[17:50] and him crucified is the office so paul
[17:53] says i
[17:54] i let everything else go except for
[17:57] christ and his present work this was the
[18:01] focus of his ministry
[18:02] christ and his present mediatorial work
[18:05] that's what he wanted to focus on and we
[18:08] find that in our prophet as well that
[18:09] there was a focus
[18:10] on christ in his present office now
[18:14] paul does not even focus on christ in
[18:16] his future office
[18:17] he does not focus on him as the son of
[18:19] david sitting on a throne
[18:21] but he focuses on him in his present
[18:24] work
[18:25] not his future work but in his present
[18:27] office christ and him crucified
[18:29] that was the focus of paul's ministry
[18:32] and i'm sure some of the others
[18:34] might have come through and preached
[18:35] about the millennium preached about
[18:36] things that were coming and paul
[18:38] preached about things to come
[18:39] as they as they were relevant to the
[18:42] believers of that age
[18:44] but he preached christ and him crucified
[18:46] to the corinthians
[18:47] that was his focus the person of christ
[18:50] and the office of christ brother branham
[18:54] says this about that he says we have
[18:55] life through christ
[18:57] and him alone our organizations
[19:01] our denominations our differences only
[19:04] separates us from god
[19:06] we have one access to god and that's
[19:08] through jesus christ
[19:10] there's not another way that we can come
[19:12] through him
[19:13] by no priest no preacher no system
[19:17] so just saying well i believe the
[19:19] message or i'm a baptist or i'm a
[19:21] pentecostal that won't bring you to
[19:22] christ
[19:23] you have to come through christ no
[19:25] preacher no priest no system or nothing
[19:27] else
[19:28] only jesus christ and him crucified
[19:32] and another message called the absolute
[19:34] brother branham said he's my absolute
[19:35] he's my all
[19:37] anything outside of that nothing in my
[19:39] arms i bring
[19:40] i know nothing else besides christ and
[19:43] him crucified
[19:45] he says i don't want to hear nothing
[19:47] else but christ and him crucified
[19:50] my heart says amen to every one of his
[19:53] promises
[19:54] that's why i know his holy spirit is a
[19:56] compass
[19:57] it guides me to the word and so he says
[20:01] that's my absolute the person and the
[20:03] work
[20:03] the present work of jesus christ
[20:07] so he says christ and him crucified and
[20:10] that word crucified in vincent's word
[20:12] studies it says this that
[20:14] that word is emphatic and
[20:18] it's interesting that that which would
[20:19] be the main stumbling block to the
[20:21] corinthians
[20:22] is what paul would emphasize because he
[20:25] says the cross was a stumbling block to
[20:27] the
[20:27] to the corinthians to the greeks in
[20:29] general because
[20:31] they saw it as something horrible a
[20:33] shameful
[20:34] death and so they tried to bypass that
[20:36] and just preach the parts of the
[20:38] scripture that weren't so
[20:39] so ugly in their eyes but paul says
[20:42] christ and him crucified i want to
[20:44] emphasize the very thing
[20:46] that would be a stumbling block because
[20:48] this is what you need to come to
[20:50] this is what you need to do
[20:56] and so paul says i was with you
[21:00] in weakness and in fear
[21:03] and in much trembling i was with you in
[21:06] weakness
[21:07] and in fear and much trembling and the
[21:10] word i was with you it says
[21:11] when i came to you this is the way that
[21:13] i was
[21:14] i think this is interesting because
[21:18] it helps me as a preacher
[21:21] to know that even the great apostle paul
[21:24] had to deal with that
[21:26] i was with you in weakness i was with
[21:28] you in fear and weakness would be
[21:30] physical weakness
[21:31] he said i was physically weak when i was
[21:33] with you
[21:34] he said i was with you in fear and in
[21:37] much
[21:37] trembling and the god's word version
[21:40] which i like
[21:42] it's a more recent translation but it's
[21:44] sometimes i'll go to it just to kind of
[21:46] get a
[21:47] a different uh take on the original
[21:49] greek and
[21:50] he said this when i came to you i was
[21:53] weak
[21:54] i was afraid and very nervous
[21:57] and i think all of us preachers can
[21:59] identify with that to some extent
[22:01] but paul said that's the way i came to
[22:03] you and paul could be different
[22:05] he could be eloquent he had been taught
[22:07] all these things and brother branham
[22:09] speaks of it as if paul did this
[22:11] purposefully
[22:12] that he purposefully came to him in that
[22:15] way
[22:17] acts chapter 18 and verse 3 we found
[22:20] that while he was there
[22:21] and this is this is interesting if you
[22:23] go back and read acts chapter 18 it's a
[22:25] good thing to go back and help you
[22:26] understand how paul
[22:27] came to the city of corinth we found
[22:30] that he actually worked when he came
[22:32] there when he said he was with him in
[22:33] weakness
[22:34] he was a working preacher while he was
[22:36] there in a in acts 18 3 it says because
[22:38] he was of the same craft he abode with
[22:40] them it was priscilla and aquila
[22:42] and wrought in other words he worked for
[22:44] them by their occupation they were tempt
[22:46] makers he
[22:47] we could put it this way he worked in
[22:48] their factory he was a worker
[22:51] just another worker he wasn't didn't
[22:52] come as a rich man but he come as a
[22:54] worker
[22:56] and then if you go down in acts chapter
[22:58] 18 it talks about how he come to corinth
[23:00] and some of the things that he went
[23:01] through in verse 8 it says that
[23:03] crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue
[23:05] believed on the lord with all his house
[23:07] many of the corinthians hearing believed
[23:09] and were baptized
[23:11] and then in in verse 9
[23:15] there's an interesting side note it says
[23:17] then spake the lord to paul in the night
[23:19] by a vision
[23:20] be not afraid remember he said i was
[23:23] with you in fear
[23:24] and so the lord spoke to him in a vision
[23:27] and said be not afraid but speak
[23:29] hold not by peace and so paul had come
[23:32] to
[23:33] the corinthians which would have been
[23:34] the wealthiest city in the world
[23:36] or one of the wealthiest cities in the
[23:38] world at that time one of the most
[23:40] decadent
[23:41] one of the most sinful cities in the
[23:43] world at that time
[23:44] and you'll find where paul goes to the
[23:46] jews and many of the jews won't believe
[23:48] although the ruler of the synagogue did
[23:50] many of the jews did not believe and so
[23:52] he shook the dust off his feet he went
[23:54] to the gentiles in that city
[23:56] and and and he's going to a new group of
[23:59] people and
[24:00] people that he's never met he's afraid
[24:02] he's with them in weakness and fear and
[24:03] trembling
[24:04] and the angel says be not afraid but
[24:06] speak and hold not thy peace
[24:08] for i am with thee that no man shall set
[24:11] on thee to hurt thee
[24:12] for i have much people in this city so
[24:15] he tells him he says
[24:16] i'm going to be with you and there's a
[24:18] reason why you're here
[24:20] may not seem like it now but i have much
[24:22] people in this city
[24:24] and the bible tells us he continued
[24:26] there a year and six months a year and a
[24:27] half is a long time
[24:29] for paul in fact he only stayed at one
[24:30] place longer in his life
[24:32] as far as working in a church and that
[24:34] was at the church with the church at
[24:35] ephesus
[24:36] i believe he was there for three years
[24:44] first corinthians 2 4 let's look at this
[24:47] my speech and my preaching was not with
[24:49] enticing words of man's wisdom
[24:51] so he said i could have come like this
[24:53] but i didn't he said but in
[24:55] demonstration of the spirit
[24:57] and the power
[25:00] i'll just read what brother branham says
[25:02] about this is so wonderful in perfect
[25:03] strength by perfect weakness brother
[25:05] random says could you imagine a man
[25:07] a pharisee of the pharisees a teacher of
[25:09] the teachers
[25:10] a man that was trained from childhood
[25:12] for the ministry
[25:13] to be an eloquent man that was smart and
[25:15] brilliant to come before a class of
[25:17] people like the corinthians to say
[25:18] i was with you in weakness with you in
[25:21] fear and much trembling
[25:22] he said the man who turned the world
[25:24] upside down the greatest missionary
[25:25] that's ever been known
[25:27] confessed that he common weakness not as
[25:29] a trained scholar but in
[25:31] weakness and fear lest he would step off
[25:34] the path somewhere
[25:35] and much trembling because he could not
[25:38] trust in his own ability
[25:40] brother brando said the reason he was
[25:42] fearing not because he was scared of
[25:43] anything
[25:44] but he was scared he would displease god
[25:47] in some way
[25:48] god help us to be in fear of that his
[25:51] ministry
[25:52] he said he was scared of that he would
[25:54] displease god in some way that he'd get
[25:56] his own ability mixed up into it
[25:59] he said something that he had learned he
[26:01] was telling them i didn't come to you
[26:03] with these excellency of speech
[26:06] brother adam turns it around he said i
[26:08] come to you in fear
[26:10] that i would come that way so i was
[26:12] actually
[26:13] in fear not in fear of the people but i
[26:15] was in fear
[26:16] that i would come to you with my natural
[26:18] ability
[26:19] instead of coming to you with the word
[26:21] of god
[26:22] wow what an example paul says for us
[26:25] today
[26:26] he said i come to you in fear that i
[26:27] would come that way but i come to you
[26:28] knowing nothing but christ
[26:31] and him crucified
[26:34] brother branham in christ is the mystery
[26:36] of god revealed he reads this
[26:38] where paul says i come to you in
[26:40] demonstration of the spirit and the
[26:41] power and he said there
[26:43] see there is the gospel
[26:46] there is the gospel and you'll find all
[26:48] the way through the message brother
[26:49] branham says the gospel is not teaching
[26:52] only
[26:53] but it's demonstration of the spirit and
[26:55] power he said there you see there is the
[26:57] gospel jesus said go
[26:58] into all the world and preach the gospel
[27:00] he didn't say go
[27:01] teach he said go preach in other words
[27:05] demonstrate the power these signs shall
[27:08] follow them
[27:09] just teaching doesn't do it
[27:12] now not that teaching is wrong that's
[27:14] what we're doing today teaching is not
[27:15] wrong we have to have teaching but that
[27:17] doesn't do it by itself it takes the
[27:20] actual spirit
[27:22] itself demonstrating these signs
[27:26] now why did paul come to them like that
[27:28] verse 5 that your faith
[27:30] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[27:33] but in the power of god
[27:36] adam clark says of that verse that your
[27:38] face should not stand that the
[27:40] illumination of your souls
[27:41] listen to this your conversion to god
[27:45] might appear to have nothing human in it
[27:49] your belief therefore of the truths
[27:52] which have been proposed to you is
[27:54] founded
[27:54] so he says this he said your faith won't
[27:57] stand it won't be
[27:59] founded on the wisdom of men so
[28:02] your belief is not founded the truths
[28:05] that have been proposed to you is not
[28:06] founded in human wisdom
[28:08] but in divine power human wisdom was not
[28:11] employed
[28:12] and human power if it had been employed
[28:14] it could not have produced
[28:16] the change and you'll find out that
[28:18] brother branham deals with that as well
[28:20] that what paul's talking about when he
[28:21] talks about the power
[28:23] it's the power to change you can go back
[28:26] and look at it he says
[28:27] my speech was in demonstration of the
[28:29] spirit and the power
[28:31] that your faith should not stand what
[28:34] your faith the change that has come to
[28:36] you the
[28:37] what made you a christian the foundation
[28:40] of who you are as a christian
[28:42] would not be because a man talked you
[28:44] into it
[28:46] but in the power of god
[28:49] not in the wisdom of men but the power
[28:51] of god the power
[28:52] of what the power to change and that's
[28:55] why we need life preaching today because
[28:57] we display when we preach not only the
[29:00] signs and the wonders and that's that's
[29:02] we do that that's a demonstration of the
[29:04] spirit
[29:04] but a power a power to change paul from
[29:08] a jew
[29:09] that hated christianity to a follower of
[29:12] christ
[29:12] he said we display the power of the
[29:15] gospel to change a life
[29:17] how powerful is that every one of us do
[29:20] that as ministers we do that
[29:21] and as lay people we do that we display
[29:23] in our lives the power of god to change
[29:26] a life
[29:28] i'll leave you with this today i think
[29:31] we i think we need to rethink
[29:33] what powerful preaching is
[29:36] paul said our brother branham says the
[29:37] world won't be converted
[29:39] by money the world will be converted by
[29:43] the holy ghost
[29:44] he said powerful preaching of the holy
[29:47] ghost and the cross
[29:49] will be the only thing that will convert
[29:51] the world
[29:52] powerful preaching power to do what
[29:54] again to change
[29:56] paul understood the power of the gospel
[29:58] to change
[30:00] everything about him everything that he
[30:02] stood for everything that he was from
[30:04] the
[30:04] worst sinner pharisee that there was to
[30:08] the messenger of the age
[30:10] he says that will be the only thing the
[30:13] powerful preaching of the holy ghost on
[30:15] the cross will be the only thing that
[30:16] will convert the world
[30:17] god's program is not money it's the holy
[30:19] ghost
[30:20] that's what god's program is is for the
[30:22] laodicean church age
[30:24] or any other church age it was that for
[30:27] the ephesian church age
[30:28] it's that for the laodicean church age
[30:31] it's still that
[30:32] the program of god is still the powerful
[30:34] preaching
[30:36] of the holy ghost and the cross and
[30:38] that'll be the only thing that'll
[30:39] convert the world what is powerful
[30:40] preaching it's not eloquence or fervents
[30:42] of spirit
[30:43] those things are wonderful we love it
[30:44] when an apology is able to come and
[30:47] preach to us
[30:48] but it's a focus on the person and work
[30:51] of christ
[30:52] and a demonstration of the power of the
[30:54] gospel
[30:55] to change lives and that's what we need
[30:57] more than anything else in the message
[30:58] of the hour
[30:59] and whatever denomination you might
[31:00] belong to that's what you need is the
[31:03] power of the gospel
[31:04] to change lives i got a note from a
[31:07] brother while i was here
[31:08] a very special unspoken prayer request
[31:11] and could use some prayers i want to
[31:13] pray for him if you have a need today
[31:16] and you want to be prayed for and then
[31:18] tomorrow night

[32:16] ability to know what to do father and
[32:19] and whatever the situation is we know
[32:21] that you're god

[32:30] one of our services that you'd pray
[32:31] every one of our prayers
[32:32] that you'd walk in every one of our
[32:34] lives if we're not a preacher
[32:36] or may we come and preach by the lives
[32:38] that we live to the people that we're
[32:40] around
[32:40] i pray you'd grant it bless us now as we
