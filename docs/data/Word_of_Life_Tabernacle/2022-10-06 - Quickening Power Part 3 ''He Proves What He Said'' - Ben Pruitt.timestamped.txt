[49:08] good preachers over there what we're
[49:09] going to do make that a little bit
[49:11] easier on you is let out church next
[49:13] Wednesday night now I know that not all
[49:16] of us can go and it's in a tent so
[49:18] there'll be plenty of room but it might
[49:20] be a little bit cool and I understand
[49:21] that some of you won't be able to go
[49:23] because of the distance or the fact it's
[49:25] outdoors or whatever but in the tent but
[49:28] I'm sure it'll be fine and maybe several
[49:30] of us could go and and kind of support
[49:32] them in the meetings so we'll uh we'll
[49:36] we'll do that so no service here next
[49:37] Wednesday night and I didn't tell nobody
[49:40] that because I just decided that right
[49:41] on the right tonight so no service next
[49:44] Wednesday night we'll go down there to
[49:46] the tent meeting and support those
[49:48] Ministries I know whether Andrew Glover
[49:49] will be there and and uh brother uh
[49:52] Wayne Lawson and Brother David Seiler
[49:55] and I think they have another Minister
[49:57] as well so it'll be good meetings good
[49:59] meetings down there and uh let's try to
[50:01] do that and we'll just have our regular
[50:03] Sunday Services though this Sunday
[50:05] and next Sunday
[50:07] so we're looking forward to that and if
[50:10] you get to go I'm sure it'll be a
[50:11] blessing I might attend I wouldn't want
[50:13] to have to try to put on a tent meeting
[50:15] in this day and age but I'm glad they're
[50:17] doing it and maybe it'll attract someone
[50:19] from the outside and you know when that
[50:21] last one comes in we get to go home
[50:24] so if that last one comes in through a
[50:26] tent meeting I want to put all my my
[50:27] shoulder to the wheel and put all the
[50:29] effort that we can to support them in
[50:32] doing that we're brothers and sisters in
[50:34] Christ and and we ought to treat one
[50:36] another like that amen let's stand
[50:39] together we'll go right into the word
[50:40] tonight
[50:42] so no service next Wednesday here but
[50:45] we'll be at brother Matt's meetings if
[50:47] you want to come to that and they'll go
[50:49] Wednesday through Sunday but of course
[50:51] we'll have our regular Sunday services
[50:55] let's go to Romans 8 8.
[50:58] we'll continue on our series on
[51:01] quickening power I hope you've been
[51:02] enjoying this I know I have we're just
[51:05] getting into the meat of this message
[51:07] brother brand I'm always prefaces it
[51:10] with many things and we're getting to
[51:12] the last of that tonight and then he
[51:14] really gets into the meat of the wave
[51:16] Chief and the mechanics and the Dynamics
[51:19] so many of the doctrines we understand
[51:20] of the of the buzzwords we say it that
[51:24] way around the message that you've heard
[51:26] for years come out of this one sermon
[51:28] and uh and some of the best quotes that
[51:31] we've quoted over the years and so I
[51:33] thought it would be good that we'd see
[51:34] them in context and and kind of go into
[51:36] it in depth and it's just a wonderful
[51:39] sermon it is the rising of the sun
[51:41] Romans 8 and 8 so then they that are in
[51:43] the flesh cannot please God but you're
[51:46] not in the flesh but in the spirit how
[51:48] many are in the spirit tonight
[51:50] he said you are in the spirit he said if
[51:53] so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[51:55] you now if any man have not the spirit
[51:58] of Christ he is none of his
[52:01] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[52:03] because of sin but the spirit is life
[52:06] because of righteousness but if the
[52:09] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[52:11] the dead dwell in you he that raised up
[52:14] Christ from the dead shall also Quicken
[52:17] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[52:19] dwelleth in you amen pray the Lord
[52:22] without his Blessing to the word you may
[52:24] be seated once again
[52:27] I want to go back to the last quote that
[52:29] we read from last Wednesday night
[52:30] brother Branham said I'm afraid today
[52:32] but too many of us are not giving people
[52:35] to Christ we're getting them to a church
[52:38] to a theory but we must get them to
[52:41] Christ he is the only one how many
[52:43] believe that tonight he is the only one
[52:46] and the only one that has life he that
[52:49] has the son has life so we must have
[52:52] Christ in order to have life so Paul
[52:55] tells us that he says if you don't have
[52:57] the Holy Ghost you're none of his
[53:00] you don't have the spirit of God of
[53:01] Christ you're none of his and so we have
[53:04] a different teaching in the message of
[53:05] the hour than they do in denominational
[53:07] circles especially when it comes to
[53:10] Holiness circles or or Pentecostal
[53:13] circles or even Baptists for that matter
[53:15] because they believe that when you're
[53:17] saved and you're born again when you
[53:19] accept Jesus into your heart and then
[53:22] later on you receive the gift of the
[53:23] Holy Ghost but that's not actually what
[53:25] brother Branham taught that he taught
[53:27] that the new birth was actually not
[53:29] complete until you receive the baptism
[53:32] of the Holy Ghost so unless you have the
[53:34] spirit of Christ you are none of his
[53:37] right and so when I say we must get
[53:39] people to Christ that's what we're
[53:41] saying You must get people to the Holy
[53:43] Ghost we must I want to dwell on this a
[53:46] moment and then we'll move on into it is
[53:48] the rising of the Sun but you cannot
[53:50] have true baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[53:53] go to hell how many understand that
[53:55] tonight it's a seal to your Eternal
[53:57] destination once you once you have it
[54:00] you can't unhave it
[54:02] right you can't not have it it's yours
[54:05] it belongs to you it's a seal it's a
[54:08] sign you're going there and so to say
[54:11] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:12] it's a great thing the true baptism of
[54:15] the Holy Ghost and that's why brother
[54:15] Brandon stood so hard against sensation
[54:18] or or again speaking in tongues as the
[54:21] evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not an
[54:23] Evidence of the Holy Ghost it's not the
[54:26] evidence of the Holy Ghost why because
[54:28] there's got to be a change that takes
[54:30] place anybody Anointed with the Holy
[54:33] Ghost could speak in tongues anybody
[54:35] Anointed with the Holy Ghost could shout
[54:37] but there's got to be a new birth
[54:39] there's got to be a a new life a growth
[54:42] that comes from that and and that's what
[54:44] it is and so he said that the it was not
[54:47] the speaking in tongues but that your
[54:49] life copes with every word
[54:51] right and and that is evidence of the
[54:54] Holy Ghost now you can have that Holy
[54:56] Ghost anointing on your flesh brother
[54:58] random taught that clearly it's the same
[55:00] Holy Ghost by the way the same Holy
[55:03] Ghost not a different anointing but the
[55:04] same one but but if there's no seed
[55:07] there it won't Quicken it
[55:08] but here's the other side to that if
[55:10] there is a seed there it will Quicken it
[55:13] and when it does Quicken it it's
[55:16] awakened and that once it's awakened
[55:18] it's it's finished
[55:20] you're still living the Flesh and so the
[55:22] body is still dead because of sin but
[55:24] the spirit is life through Jesus Christ
[55:28] so again you cannot have the baptism of
[55:31] the Holy Ghost the true baptism in this
[55:33] hour the way we understand it to be the
[55:36] new birth of God and go to hell
[55:38] you can't do it and I will go this far
[55:40] you can't have it and be and not be a
[55:43] seed of God
[55:44] because how can you be birthed to be a
[55:46] son
[55:47] or daughter of God if you if you're not
[55:49] a seed of God
[55:51] you had to be in his thoughts to receive
[55:54] the token in this hour
[55:56] amen and so now but what is it why why
[56:00] does so many say well not everybody has
[56:03] it that's true because the Kingdom of
[56:05] Heaven is like a net the Bible says it
[56:07] was cast into the sea
[56:09] and gathered of every kind
[56:12] every kind
[56:14] and when it was full they drew it to
[56:16] Shore and sat down and gathered the good
[56:18] into vessels but cast the bat away and
[56:20] he said so shall it be at the end of the
[56:22] world now brother random says there's
[56:24] only one thing that we know to do
[56:27] is to follow the instructions that our
[56:30] Lord left us preach the gospel to Every
[56:32] Creature are you with me tonight I'm
[56:34] going to push through it so y'all just
[56:36] hang with me tonight he says he knows
[56:38] who is saved and who is not so our job
[56:40] is to preach the gospel to how many
[56:43] every creature
[56:45] right preaching the gospel is is
[56:47] throwing out the net
[56:49] I'm going to throw out the net that's
[56:51] what I'm doing tonight I'm throwing out
[56:52] the net now when I pull the net in
[56:54] there's all kinds of fish in the net
[56:57] right and so now he said he knows who
[57:01] has saved and who is not we do not that
[57:03] we just cast The Net into the sea bring
[57:06] forth of all kinds but God knows who is
[57:08] saved and who is not and no man can come
[57:12] to him except the father has drawn him
[57:13] and all the father has given him someone
[57:16] say all all the father has given him
[57:20] will come he said we know that so we
[57:23] can't say this one is a Christian and
[57:25] that one isn't
[57:27] when you're casting the net because
[57:29] nothing's manifested itself yet
[57:32] right they might have all spoke with
[57:34] tongues or all ran the aisles or all
[57:35] jumped and shouted or all done none of
[57:37] those things
[57:38] right but they're all in the net
[57:41] they all had some response to the word
[57:43] I'll say that if you haven't if you've
[57:45] had no response to the word you're not
[57:47] even in the net
[57:49] right but these have had a response to
[57:51] the word they believed if we could say
[57:53] it that way they're all believers
[57:56] they're all at least what they think
[57:58] believing is they're all believers at
[58:00] least in the intellectual way because
[58:03] they're in the net
[58:04] and he said when you've taken the net in
[58:06] he had all kinds of things in there
[58:09] he said and there would be water spiders
[58:12] bugs snakes fish scavenger fish good
[58:17] fish
[58:18] he said but you see the water bugs and
[58:20] things finally oh I love this they
[58:22] finally crawl back in the water again
[58:25] let me let me encourage you tonight the
[58:28] fact that you're here the fact that
[58:30] you're still caught
[58:32] that you're still in the net is a very
[58:35] good indication
[58:37] that you're a fish
[58:39] quit letting the devil beat you up oh
[58:41] I'm not saved I'm Not Elected I'm not
[58:43] the Bride of Jesus Christ the fact that
[58:46] you're here when so many water bugs
[58:49] crawled back and so many lobsters
[58:51] crawled back and so many other things
[58:53] crawled back in but you're a fish
[58:57] you're what he was fishing for
[59:00] amen you're the one the gospel came to
[59:03] and you're still caught by him you're
[59:05] still in the net it's still there's
[59:07] something about it you might have made
[59:08] mistakes you might have had all kinds of
[59:10] problems but there's something about it
[59:12] when you hear the gospel preach there's
[59:14] just something in you but Alan the
[59:16] response to that you're still in the net
[59:18] the tears still flow down your cheeks
[59:20] you still there's something there right
[59:23] you're still in the net yeah
[59:25] God help us if we ever get to the place
[59:27] where we have no faith and we just say
[59:28] well I go to church but no if you're in
[59:30] the net there's a response to the word
[59:33] you're still in the net hold on to that
[59:37] don't let the devil take that away from
[59:39] you
[59:40] you're in the net a good indication that
[59:42] you're a child of God
[59:45] amen
[59:46] now watch
[59:48] the good fish was Kept For The Master
[59:49] now we don't know which is we just
[59:51] casting out
[59:52] remember that water bug was the water
[59:54] bug when the net went over him
[59:56] the influence of the meeting was what
[59:58] caught him
[1:00:00] the snake was still a snake
[1:00:02] the gospel net just pulled him in
[1:00:06] and the scavenger fish was a scavenger
[1:00:09] fish
[1:00:10] and the turtle was a turtle
[1:00:12] crawfish was a crawfish we could go a
[1:00:14] little bit farther and say the Baptist
[1:00:16] was a Baptist
[1:00:18] right
[1:00:19] he said but then I was a Baptist but
[1:00:20] inside you were something different
[1:00:22] the Church of Christ was the Church of
[1:00:24] Christ the smoker was a smoker the
[1:00:26] drunker was a drunkard and they all went
[1:00:28] back where they come from
[1:00:30] but we're here we're still in the net on
[1:00:32] a Wednesday night
[1:00:34] where are we still on the net we were a
[1:00:35] real fish
[1:00:37] he said the Crawfish was a crawfish but
[1:00:39] the real fish was the fish to begin with
[1:00:42] so he knows which is he has their names
[1:00:44] on his book put there when the lamb was
[1:00:46] saying before the foundation of the
[1:00:47] world so that when I'm talking about
[1:00:49] getting people to Christ that's what I'm
[1:00:50] talking about we want to draw the net
[1:00:52] and pull them to Christ
[1:00:54] and then the ones that are are Creole
[1:00:57] seed of God can receive the true baptism
[1:00:59] the Holy Ghost and go on in
[1:01:01] now brother random deals with that and I
[1:01:04] don't have time tonight but if you go
[1:01:05] and read in the smyrnian church age in
[1:01:08] the church age book there's a part of
[1:01:09] that titled the new birth in every age
[1:01:12] how many has ever read that
[1:01:15] a few of you have the new birth in every
[1:01:16] age go read that and you'll understand
[1:01:18] what brother Branham means by receiving
[1:01:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:23] it's not just a sensation or not just
[1:01:26] something like that but it's a new birth
[1:01:28] it's being born again
[1:01:30] so believing it's not the Holy Ghost
[1:01:32] that's just being caught in the net we
[1:01:35] find that in Acts 237 they were pricked
[1:01:37] in their heart what does that mean it
[1:01:39] means they were caught in the net
[1:01:41] and so they said what shall we do
[1:01:43] they were in the net now Peter draws
[1:01:45] them in he said repent and be baptized
[1:01:47] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:01:48] Christ for the remission of sins you
[1:01:50] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:52] Paul found some that were caught in
[1:01:54] John's net
[1:01:56] you remember he threw out the John
[1:01:58] throughout the net of repentance and and
[1:02:00] pointing them to belief in Christ and it
[1:02:03] came to pass while Apollos was at
[1:02:05] Corinth I'll pass through the upper
[1:02:06] coast and came to emphasis and found
[1:02:08] certain disciples and said to them have
[1:02:10] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:02:12] were caught in the net
[1:02:14] now think about it since you believed
[1:02:17] and they said unto him we have not so
[1:02:19] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:02:21] Ghost
[1:02:21] and he said it to them and to what then
[1:02:23] were you baptized they said unto John's
[1:02:25] baptism
[1:02:26] and then said Paul John barely baptized
[1:02:28] with the baptism of repentance saying
[1:02:30] unto the people that they should believe
[1:02:31] on him which should come after him on
[1:02:34] Christ Jesus and when they heard this
[1:02:35] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:02:37] Lord Jesus and when Paul had laid his
[1:02:40] hands on them the Holy Ghost came on
[1:02:42] them and they spake with tongues and
[1:02:43] prophesied they were real fish
[1:02:46] right they were real fish so they began
[1:02:48] to manifest
[1:02:50] they begin to manifest what a fish does
[1:02:54] Glory
[1:02:56] now
[1:02:58] so if we go back to the rising of the
[1:03:01] Sun so we want to get people to Christ
[1:03:03] don't we how do we do that preach the
[1:03:05] word
[1:03:06] preach the gospel and bring people to
[1:03:08] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:10] because if you get people to the baptism
[1:03:12] the Holy Ghost you're literally getting
[1:03:14] them to Christ
[1:03:16] oh we need the Holy Ghost tonight
[1:03:19] how we need it we need it we need him to
[1:03:21] be our counselor we need him to be our
[1:03:23] guide we need him to be our friend we
[1:03:25] need him to be the one that carries us
[1:03:27] through life we can't make it without
[1:03:28] the Holy Ghost we were not meant to make
[1:03:30] it without the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[1:03:32] well it's needful for you it's expedient
[1:03:35] that I go away because when I go away
[1:03:37] I'm going to send the Holy Ghost
[1:03:39] and when I come back in that form he
[1:03:42] said I'm coming back to you when I do
[1:03:44] I'm going to be your counselor I'm going
[1:03:45] to be your guide I'm going to lead and
[1:03:47] guide you into all truth that's what we
[1:03:48] need tonight
[1:03:50] trust that's what we have now
[1:03:53] brother said it's the life of a man
[1:03:55] that's dead be projected in you you will
[1:03:56] live the same life he lived
[1:03:58] so again I'm not taking this out of
[1:04:00] context in this random says we've got to
[1:04:02] get them to Christ and this is what
[1:04:04] Christ is if the life of a man that's
[1:04:06] dead be projected and you will live
[1:04:08] you'll live the same life he lived he
[1:04:09] spoke in other places of Beethoven or
[1:04:11] John Dillinger he would do what they do
[1:04:14] the token it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ lived through the believer we
[1:04:18] understand that
[1:04:20] so brother Branham goes on he said if
[1:04:21] the blood of a man was a certain type
[1:04:23] and you took the blood from one man and
[1:04:24] changed the blood of one man into
[1:04:26] another he would absolutely be that type
[1:04:29] blood and if your spirit that's in you
[1:04:31] is reckoned dead and you are anointed
[1:04:33] with the life that was in Christ is upon
[1:04:35] you
[1:04:36] he said Romans 8 11 said if the spirit
[1:04:38] the race Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:04:40] you will also Quicken your mortal body
[1:04:42] that same life them same powers and them
[1:04:45] same beneficiary he saw somebody ought
[1:04:47] to preach with me tonight he said that
[1:04:48] he had here on Earth from God he
[1:04:50] redeemed you a seed that was foreknown
[1:04:52] by God whose name was put on the Lamb's
[1:04:55] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:04:56] the world
[1:04:57] and that Gospel Light of the
[1:04:59] Resurrection the confirmation of the
[1:05:01] word he said how did we know he was the
[1:05:03] Christ
[1:05:04] what's a good question isn't it
[1:05:07] how did we know he was the anointed word
[1:05:10] how did we know he was the Christ
[1:05:12] because he proved what he talked about
[1:05:15] how will people know that we are Messiah
[1:05:17] yes little Christ
[1:05:19] right how will people know because we
[1:05:21] proved by our daily life what we're
[1:05:24] talking about
[1:05:26] Genesis 1 11 and God said let the Earth
[1:05:28] bring forth grass
[1:05:30] herb yielding seed in the fruit tree
[1:05:32] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[1:05:35] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[1:05:36] so so he's saying let everything bring
[1:05:38] forth after its kind that was God's
[1:05:40] method let the seed bring forth its kind
[1:05:43] and the Earth brought forth how do we
[1:05:46] know what a grass is
[1:05:49] talking about Blades of grass
[1:05:52] how do we know what a fruit tree is what
[1:05:55] an apple is
[1:05:57] right you've seen an apple that's how
[1:06:00] you know the fruit of it
[1:06:02] yeah that's how you know what an apple
[1:06:03] is because you've seen it
[1:06:06] it's been manifested in front of you
[1:06:08] when you plant it in the ground you you
[1:06:10] know they always put something on the
[1:06:11] package
[1:06:12] but how do you know that that's the
[1:06:14] truth
[1:06:15] you can tell anybody you're a Christian
[1:06:17] it can be written right there on the
[1:06:18] package and you can sit in your little
[1:06:20] Row in church
[1:06:22] you know how when we planted a garden we
[1:06:23] used to put the seed packet over the
[1:06:25] over the little stick at the end of the
[1:06:27] row some of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:06:29] about and you can put that right on the
[1:06:31] end of your row and it can say Christian
[1:06:32] right on it message believer
[1:06:36] right but the seed will prove what it is
[1:06:39] coming up
[1:06:42] Lord and the ultimate proof of what oh
[1:06:45] God if we could just see it that the
[1:06:47] ultimate proof it's one of these days
[1:06:48] your body is going to change and you're
[1:06:50] going to come up
[1:06:52] if you go by way of the Grave you're
[1:06:53] going to be in a resurrection you'll
[1:06:55] come up
[1:06:56] to proof
[1:06:57] we were dead in trespasses and sins but
[1:07:00] around spring of the year at the rising
[1:07:02] of the sun when the message light began
[1:07:04] to come on us it warmed the Earth and we
[1:07:06] begin to come up
[1:07:08] and that's the proof of what we are and
[1:07:09] Who We Are
[1:07:11] right oh glory to God
[1:07:13] the Earth brought forth grass an herb
[1:07:16] yielding seed after his kind the tree
[1:07:18] yielding fruit whose seed was in itself
[1:07:20] after his kind and God saw
[1:07:22] said it's good
[1:07:24] amen Howell again brother I'm asking a
[1:07:27] question how will I know the message of
[1:07:29] the hour
[1:07:30] How will I know the message of the hour
[1:07:33] and I want to challenge you with this
[1:07:34] there's been other people that said they
[1:07:36] were Elijah
[1:07:39] how do we know that this one's right
[1:07:42] How will I know the message of the ri
[1:07:44] was listening to English History the
[1:07:47] other day
[1:07:48] and as I was listening to this podcast
[1:07:50] on Ancient English not ancient really
[1:07:54] but Middle Middle Ages English History
[1:07:56] the last man who was ever burned at the
[1:07:58] stake in England was born at the stake
[1:08:00] for saying he was Elijah
[1:08:03] that was to come Malachi 4.
[1:08:06] but he didn't manifest Elijah if you go
[1:08:08] read about his life
[1:08:10] How will I know the message of the hour
[1:08:13] the aunt proves what he promised
[1:08:18] Glory and he talks about it every time
[1:08:20] you hear some a little preacher that
[1:08:22] comes around and I don't think that
[1:08:24] screen's on back there brother Peter oh
[1:08:27] there it goes um you know every time
[1:08:29] some little two-bit preacher comes
[1:08:31] around claims to be something you know
[1:08:33] and and it's something that they're not
[1:08:35] just watch and see what they bring forth
[1:08:38] God's not going to do this thing in the
[1:08:40] corner
[1:08:41] but when God sent the message of the
[1:08:43] hour he produced something
[1:08:45] why did he produce you and I
[1:08:48] yeah amen
[1:08:50] he said God proves what he promised and
[1:08:52] he talks about it he said that is the
[1:08:54] identification that we are beneficiaries
[1:08:56] with him in the resurrection he proves
[1:08:58] what he has talked about
[1:09:01] you you could come and tell him he said
[1:09:02] brother Ben I know I'm getting off here
[1:09:04] but I think it's it's good to illustrate
[1:09:05] it so we'll understand you can come and
[1:09:07] tell me say I'm a good Carpenter
[1:09:10] all right I can tell you that I'm a good
[1:09:12] Carpenter but at some point you begin to
[1:09:14] say where's the proof
[1:09:17] but the joke come up to me and say I can
[1:09:18] paint where's the proof we know brother
[1:09:21] Caleb can paint because he painted this
[1:09:23] church
[1:09:24] right it's the proof of it we know
[1:09:26] brother Joel can paint because we've
[1:09:28] seen him paint we know some of you can
[1:09:30] sing because we've heard you sing we
[1:09:31] know some of you can't
[1:09:36] huh
[1:09:38] right the proof is what you are
[1:09:41] oh God and I know I'm a Christian I know
[1:09:44] I'm a Child of God because I came up and
[1:09:47] I began to live as a child of God and I
[1:09:49] began to worship God and I begin to
[1:09:51] desire God and I hungered and thirsted
[1:09:53] after God what was it I was a child of
[1:09:56] God Amen nothing could take that away
[1:09:58] from me don't let the devil steal away
[1:10:00] your joy trying to tell you well you're
[1:10:02] not a Believer you're not a child of God
[1:10:04] you are a son or daughter of God why
[1:10:07] because you came up
[1:10:09] you come up out of a message house or
[1:10:11] you come up out of a dead Church system
[1:10:13] or you come up out of the world but you
[1:10:15] came up
[1:10:16] and begin to worship God
[1:10:19] Oh Glory to God
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:23] he proves what he's proves what he has
[1:10:26] talked about what he promised to do in
[1:10:28] Christ
[1:10:29] amen he proved it on the resurrection
[1:10:33] what he promised to do in the days of
[1:10:34] Moses he proved it what he promised in
[1:10:37] the days of Enoch he proved it and all
[1:10:40] the days of the Apostles he proved it
[1:10:42] now in this day he proves what he said
[1:10:45] be because they are a part of that seed
[1:10:47] they are
[1:10:48] a part of that seed that was represented
[1:10:51] on the book of life that he came to
[1:10:53] redeem back to God again he said oh what
[1:10:55] a message
[1:10:56] see the message is not it's not books
[1:10:59] and tapes the message is proof
[1:11:02] Hallelujah you said on Easter morning
[1:11:05] not only did he raise but his
[1:11:07] beneficiaries raised with him they were
[1:11:09] in Christ at his crucifixion they were
[1:11:12] in him at his resurrection we are his
[1:11:14] beneficiaries quickened after being dead
[1:11:16] in darkness the darkened world of
[1:11:18] unbelief were churches and denominations
[1:11:20] and so forth has drawn us out he said
[1:11:22] and there's something in his calling oh
[1:11:24] we want God we're hungry and thirsty for
[1:11:27] God is that why you're here on a
[1:11:28] Wednesday night there's something in you
[1:11:30] calling we want God we're hungry and
[1:11:32] thirsting for God what is that proof of
[1:11:35] Who You Are
[1:11:36] right we joined the Methodist Baptist
[1:11:39] Pentecostals Presbyterians and what more
[1:11:40] and still there was something wrong we
[1:11:42] just couldn't find it yet and all of a
[1:11:45] sudden while we was groping in darkness
[1:11:46] the great Resurrection came to us in the
[1:11:49] manifestation of the promised word of
[1:11:51] God
[1:11:52] said like he was the manifestation of
[1:11:54] the promised word of God I will not
[1:11:55] leave his soul in Hell neither will I
[1:11:57] suffer my Holy One to seek corruption he
[1:12:00] manifested every word of God that was
[1:12:02] promised to him he proved it when he
[1:12:04] raised on the Easter morning
[1:12:05] he said now them who were once groping
[1:12:07] in darkness and wandering around he said
[1:12:09] if they should wash feet on this day or
[1:12:12] if they should keep a certain day or do
[1:12:15] a certain set of rules
[1:12:16] now look all those things passed away
[1:12:21] because the proof that you're a message
[1:12:22] believer is not how many tapes you
[1:12:24] listen to and it's not even how many
[1:12:26] services you attend or not who your
[1:12:29] pastor is
[1:12:31] right or what day you wash feed on
[1:12:35] are you hear me today whether you have
[1:12:37] two or three services or one service or
[1:12:39] once a month or once a year that's not
[1:12:41] the proof of it
[1:12:42] now I believe you'll follow the word but
[1:12:44] what's the proof of it what is it what
[1:12:47] is it you were wandering around but all
[1:12:49] those things passed away why because the
[1:12:51] resurrection something raised in you
[1:12:54] he said for there was a glorious
[1:12:55] resurrection that defied every man-made
[1:12:58] thing that man had ever done every man
[1:13:00] made reason he said there had never been
[1:13:02] to that time a man that could lay his
[1:13:04] life down and pick it up again he defied
[1:13:07] that scientific proof they had by
[1:13:09] raising again there will be people come
[1:13:11] and tell you listen to me young people
[1:13:13] there will be people come and tell you
[1:13:14] they can prove the message wrong they'll
[1:13:16] tell you by scientific proof we can
[1:13:18] prove it wrong they told Noah in his day
[1:13:20] we can prove there will be no rain we
[1:13:22] can prove there won't be a Rapture but
[1:13:24] he said he defied the scientific proof
[1:13:26] that they had by raising again
[1:13:29] when they say that Jesus Christ isn't
[1:13:32] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:33] that his power isn't the same that his
[1:13:36] gospel is the same when the Bible says
[1:13:39] it's the same
[1:13:40] he said God defied every denomination
[1:13:42] every Creed and he moved forth with his
[1:13:45] holy spirit as he promised and proved it
[1:13:48] to us
[1:13:49] that he is alive
[1:13:51] as he proved it to you
[1:13:54] and and so
[1:13:57] and I'm going to go on but there's two
[1:13:59] sides to this you know there's a
[1:14:00] historical side we can look back and we
[1:14:02] can see God proved it in the message of
[1:14:03] the hour
[1:14:04] and I think that's important by the way
[1:14:07] because we don't want our kids to forget
[1:14:10] what God did in this hour
[1:14:12] and we're we're in a junction time right
[1:14:14] now where many new brother Brandman
[1:14:16] walked with him were passing off the
[1:14:18] scene
[1:14:19] and some of the we had the opportunity
[1:14:21] as older folks many of us knew people
[1:14:23] who were in the meetings
[1:14:25] we fellowship with them we talked to
[1:14:26] them we knew what it was we believed
[1:14:29] their stories
[1:14:30] now we're getting to a place but the
[1:14:32] Bible says more blessed or they have not
[1:14:34] seen
[1:14:35] all right but even my generation we
[1:14:37] didn't see directly but we we could talk
[1:14:39] to them but my kids will never have that
[1:14:41] opportunity
[1:14:43] you think about it they have very little
[1:14:44] opportunity to ever meet somebody who
[1:14:45] was in the meeting so that becomes a
[1:14:47] historical thing so I think we ought to
[1:14:49] keep that alive we ought to remind them
[1:14:51] of those things we had to show them the
[1:14:53] video we ought to do those things for
[1:14:55] them but it can't stop there
[1:14:57] because it just becomes a dead religion
[1:15:00] of 40 years ago or 50 years ago now but
[1:15:03] but it's just a dead religion if that's
[1:15:05] all it is
[1:15:06] but not only did he prove himself 50
[1:15:09] years ago but he proved himself in my
[1:15:12] generation
[1:15:13] he changed me he quickened me and he's
[1:15:16] leading me away from the world and
[1:15:17] straight to Calvary it leads me away
[1:15:20] from the way this world culture is going
[1:15:22] and leads me to himself
[1:15:25] we are the benefactors of his
[1:15:27] resurrection he's proved to us that he's
[1:15:29] alive not only in a prophet but also in
[1:15:31] a bride
[1:15:33] thank you Lord
[1:15:35] we are the benefactors of his
[1:15:37] resurrection quick and after being dead
[1:15:38] in the world in sin and trespasses he's
[1:15:40] Quicken us together with him raised with
[1:15:42] him now sitting in Heavenly places
[1:15:45] Christ Jesus his Spirit brings his same
[1:15:48] life again on the Earth
[1:15:50] now watch he says if the spirit of God
[1:15:54] raised up Christ the body the anointed
[1:15:57] body what did the spirit do it raised up
[1:16:01] the anointed body the Christ
[1:16:04] what does the spirit do today
[1:16:07] that's why you can't have it only in
[1:16:09] mechanics
[1:16:10] he said you can't can't be just word
[1:16:12] only
[1:16:13] right because the spirit raises the
[1:16:16] anointed body
[1:16:17] if the spirit of God anointed that body
[1:16:20] in such a way
[1:16:21] when that seed fell into the Earth he
[1:16:25] just wouldn't let him rest there
[1:16:28] glory and we could all go back to our
[1:16:31] own lives and see that when the spirit
[1:16:33] of God Anointed The the anointed body
[1:16:36] which is us
[1:16:38] when it anointed us what did it do it
[1:16:40] wouldn't let us just lay there
[1:16:43] oh we've been through that but again we
[1:16:46] know what it's like to fail we know what
[1:16:47] it's like to be in a dead cold grave we
[1:16:49] know what it's like in dead trespasses
[1:16:51] and says even if you've been raised in a
[1:16:53] message you know what that's like if
[1:16:54] you've ever been born again you know
[1:16:56] what it's like to not be able to live an
[1:16:58] overcoming life but you've been raised
[1:17:00] you've been raised searching God for
[1:17:03] that today
[1:17:04] he wouldn't let him rest there
[1:17:07] quickened him and raised him up that
[1:17:10] same spirit
[1:17:11] by the same works
[1:17:13] by the same Signs by the same power but
[1:17:17] the same signs being you it'll also
[1:17:19] raise you up
[1:17:21] aren't you glad for that promise today
[1:17:25] now watch brother Branham
[1:17:28] and it is the rising of the sun then
[1:17:30] goes into teaching on the wave sheath
[1:17:32] and I'll have to hold that back for next
[1:17:33] time because it's a wonderful thing
[1:17:36] but this is a resurrection message
[1:17:39] proof that God is alive after two
[1:17:41] thousand years
[1:17:43] but I want to present this to you
[1:17:45] tonight before we close
[1:17:46] see what was proof he keeps his word
[1:17:51] right he kept his word
[1:17:53] and we can say that he kept his word
[1:17:55] 2000 years ago
[1:17:57] right we can say that he kept his word
[1:17:59] on the day of Pentecost
[1:18:01] he kept his word even to Lutheran to
[1:18:03] Wesley at the Pentecost
[1:18:05] he kept his word in a prophet
[1:18:08] I think we could say he kept his word on
[1:18:10] Malachi 4.
[1:18:12] behold I sent unto you Elijah he kept
[1:18:14] his word on Revelation 10. a mighty
[1:18:16] Angel come down with an open book
[1:18:19] he kept his word on Luke 17 30. and the
[1:18:22] day when the son of man is revealed
[1:18:25] but if he kept his word about that
[1:18:28] he also keeps his word about me
[1:18:31] and about you about the bride
[1:18:34] now what position are we in in this hour
[1:18:37] under this are we a dead body laying
[1:18:40] there waiting on a prophet to come back
[1:18:42] to bring us up out of the Grave or are
[1:18:45] we a quickened bride
[1:18:47] right and we we get to decide that in
[1:18:50] Europe because what you believe is what
[1:18:51] you are you can't you can't be nothing
[1:18:53] you don't believe you are
[1:18:55] right so you've got to believe you're a
[1:18:57] quick and body and if you're a quick and
[1:18:59] body what are you you're Washed by the
[1:19:01] Water of the word listen he tells in in
[1:19:04] Ephesians 5 25 Paul's talking to
[1:19:06] husbands and wives but it's such a
[1:19:08] greater mystery than that but yet that's
[1:19:10] a mystery in itself
[1:19:12] but now Ephesians 5 25 husbands love
[1:19:15] your wives even as Christ also loved the
[1:19:17] church and gave himself for it that he
[1:19:19] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[1:19:21] washing of Water by the word so we stand
[1:19:24] today what sanctified
[1:19:27] the same message that promised Malachi
[1:19:29] for the same scripture that promised
[1:19:31] that is promising this
[1:19:33] that he might present it to himself
[1:19:37] a glorious Church
[1:19:39] I love the word glorious
[1:19:42] what that means is shiny
[1:19:45] sparkly
[1:19:48] glorious is over and over the top
[1:19:54] now what's he saying he's not going to
[1:19:56] present a church that's barely dressed
[1:20:00] barely ready barely clean
[1:20:03] and oh God got in by the skin of their
[1:20:06] teeth
[1:20:07] but a church with quickening power
[1:20:09] he might present it Oh Glory to God a
[1:20:12] glorious Church
[1:20:14] and look at somebody tell them if
[1:20:15] there's anybody beside you look at
[1:20:17] somebody and tell them you're a glorious
[1:20:19] Church
[1:20:21] you're a glorious Church
[1:20:23] a glorious Church what else does it say
[1:20:25] not having spot
[1:20:28] yes sir yes sir you can quit saying it
[1:20:30] now Gabe that's enough
[1:20:37] sorry
[1:20:38] not having a spot
[1:20:41] are you with me tonight not having spot
[1:20:48] he's going to look at one another and
[1:20:49] say you don't have a spot
[1:20:52] or a wrinkle
[1:20:54] and we're not talking about the outside
[1:20:58] but you don't go by this is how he sees
[1:21:01] you he said he he presented to himself
[1:21:03] when is this supposed to happen in this
[1:21:06] age
[1:21:07] he might present it to himself
[1:21:11] I love that
[1:21:13] you realize it was the message that
[1:21:14] presents us to Christ Christ is the
[1:21:17] message
[1:21:18] amen presenting himself a bride
[1:21:23] glory to God presuming himself a
[1:21:26] glorious church not having spot a
[1:21:29] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:21:31] should be holy and without blemish
[1:21:35] a faultless bride completely sinless
[1:21:39] amen oh is that what he said about you
[1:21:42] Hallelujah
[1:21:44] now watch he kept his word
[1:21:47] how many could say Amen to that tonight
[1:21:49] he
[1:21:53] glorious Church
[1:21:58] I am without spot or wrinkle
[1:22:01] but Paul or brother Branham rather took
[1:22:03] that and he said you are the pure
[1:22:05] virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ
[1:22:08] ready and waiting for a rapture
[1:22:12] Hallelujah
[1:22:13] I just take that I'll take the word of a
[1:22:16] prophet over the word of India of
[1:22:18] anybody else in this age
[1:22:20] he said I was complete pure virtuous
[1:22:23] sinless
[1:22:24] he didn't say I needed somebody else's
[1:22:26] Ministry to come along and make me that
[1:22:28] but he said you are that
[1:22:31] but then if he kept his word about that
[1:22:33] let me believe that tonight
[1:22:36] I'm gonna close in just a minute we'll
[1:22:37] be right on time he will keep his word
[1:22:39] in First Corinthians 15.
[1:22:42] now this I say brother verse 50. this I
[1:22:45] say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot
[1:22:46] inherit the kingdom of God neither does
[1:22:49] corruption inherit incorruption
[1:22:51] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[1:22:54] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:22:57] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[1:22:59] the last truck for the trumpet shall
[1:23:01] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:23:03] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:23:06] for this corruptor will must put on
[1:23:08] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[1:23:10] immortality listen to the word of the
[1:23:12] scriptures we get ready to close so in
[1:23:14] this corruptible shall it put on
[1:23:15] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[1:23:17] put on immortality then shall be brought
[1:23:20] to pass the saying that is written death
[1:23:22] is swallowed up in Victory he said oh
[1:23:24] death where is thy sting why do you have
[1:23:27] to be scared of church own grave where
[1:23:30] is thy Victory The Sting of death is sin
[1:23:32] and the strength of sin is the law but
[1:23:34] thanks be to God which giveth us the
[1:23:36] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:23:39] therefore my beloved Brethren be
[1:23:41] steadfast unmovable always abounding in
[1:23:44] the work of the Lord for as much as you
[1:23:46] know that your labor is not in vain in
[1:23:49] the Lord
[1:23:50] if he kept his word about Malachi 4 if
[1:23:54] he kept his word about Ephesians 5.
[1:23:57] then he'll keep his word in First
[1:23:59] Corinthians 15. and first Thessalonians
[1:24:01] 4 and all the other scriptures that
[1:24:03] speak of a rapture
[1:24:05] and a body change
[1:24:07] musicians go ahead and come I
[1:24:12] I read a story that when Wellington
[1:24:15] one of his great victory over Napoleon
[1:24:17] at Waterloo
[1:24:19] they set up signal flags signal back
[1:24:22] home
[1:24:23] what they were trying to Signal back was
[1:24:27] Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo
[1:24:31] that was the message
[1:24:33] Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo
[1:24:36] but you know what happens across the
[1:24:37] English Channel it gets real foggy
[1:24:40] and the people receiving the message on
[1:24:42] the other end didn't get the whole
[1:24:43] message
[1:24:45] they only got the first two words
[1:24:47] Wellington defeated
[1:24:51] so all night long while the fog
[1:24:54] persisted
[1:24:56] they thought Wellington was defeated
[1:24:59] but when the sun came up
[1:25:03] Glory
[1:25:04] when the sun came up
[1:25:06] are you hearing me tonight that's that's
[1:25:08] the hour that we live in I know it's
[1:25:11] been very simple tonight and not much
[1:25:12] but if you just see it on a Wednesday
[1:25:14] night the sun has come up it is the
[1:25:17] rising of the sun he didn't say it might
[1:25:19] be it could be it is the rising of the
[1:25:22] sun when the sun come up we could see
[1:25:25] that Wellington defeated Napoleon at
[1:25:27] Waterloo it looked like it looked like
[1:25:30] Jesus had been defeated they had killed
[1:25:32] him put his body in a grave but when the
[1:25:34] sun came up on Sunday morning they've
[1:25:36] got the whole message
[1:25:38] and can I say to you as we close here
[1:25:41] today that when it may be it may be look
[1:25:44] like it may be foggy everywhere that you
[1:25:46] are you may look out here and see
[1:25:47] Darkness everywhere but when you see the
[1:25:49] signal when you see the message and
[1:25:51] begin to read it as the sun comes up and
[1:25:53] begins to burn the fog out of your brain
[1:25:55] begins to burn it out of your soul you
[1:25:57] begin to realize I am not defeated but I
