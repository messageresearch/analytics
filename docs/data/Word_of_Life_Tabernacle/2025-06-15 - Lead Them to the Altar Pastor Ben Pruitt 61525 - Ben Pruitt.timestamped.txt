[6:01] Somebody give him a praise offering this

[6:07] Well, I feel like praising praising him.
[6:12] [Music]
[6:14] Oh, I feel like praising praising him.
[6:21] Oh, praise him in the morning.
[6:26] Praise him all day long. Oh, I feel
[6:32] like praising praising him.

[7:28] Well, I feel I feel like praising.
[7:33] Praising him. If you feel like praising
[7:36] him, give him some praise this morning.
[7:39] Amen. Want to say we welcome any
[7:41] visitors we have this morning. God bless
[7:42] you. Amen. We're going to change the
[7:44] order of the service now. Amen. How
[7:46] many's ready for the word of the Lord
[7:47] this morning? Amen. Man, I believe that
[7:49] you're ready. You're you're worshiping
[7:51] good. And I believe that's the way God
[7:52] expects it. God wants your worship. You
[7:54] believe that this morning? I mean, he
[7:56] wants your worship. He He He made you to
[7:58] worship. Before there was you, there
[8:02] were angels crying, "Holy, holy." But
[8:04] they didn't even know what they were
[8:05] singing about because they'd never been
[8:06] redeemed. But there's some redeemed
[8:08] people in the building this morning that
[8:10] knows how to worship. Because you know
[8:11] what you were, but you know what you are
[8:14] now because of him. And because of that,
[8:16] we can worship this morning. Do you
[8:17] believe it? Give the Lord a big hand
[8:19] clap of praise.
[8:21] Amen. Let's think about his love and his
[8:23] goodness as our pastor comes this
[8:24] morning.
[8:26] Oh, think about his love.
[8:33] Oh, think about his goodness.
[8:40] Think about his grace
[8:46] that has brought us through.
[8:50] [Music]
[8:52] For as high as the heavens above,
[9:00] so great is the measure
[9:04] of our father's love.
[9:09] [Music]
[9:12] Oh, great is the measure
[9:16] of our father's
[9:20] love.
[9:21] [Music]
[9:24] Oh, think about his love.
[9:30] Won't you think about his goodness?
[9:34] Has he been good to you?
[9:36] Oh, think about his grace
[9:42] that has brought us through.
[9:46] [Music]
[9:49] For as high as the heavens above us,
[9:57] so great is the measure
[10:00] of our Father's
[10:03] love.
[10:07] [Music]
[10:08] Oh, great is the measure
[10:13] of our fathers. Amen. Can you just think
[10:17] about it this morning as you worship him
[10:18] one more time? Oh, think about his love.
[10:26] Won't you think about his goodness?
[10:33] Think about his grace
[10:39] that has brought us through.
[10:43] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[10:45] For as high as the heavens above.
[10:52] Oh, great is the measure
[10:57] of our father's love.
[11:04] Oh, we're singing and great is the
[11:08] measure
[11:09] of our father's
[11:13] love.
[11:15] Thank you, Lord. Let's bow our heads
[11:17] together.
[11:19] Heavenly Father, we're so great.
[11:21] Thankful, Lord, for your great love. So
[11:24] thankful for, Lord, that it cannot be
[11:27] measured. Lord, how deep is the sea and
[11:30] how high are the heavens? Lord, we
[11:32] cannot measure your love. We thank you
[11:33] for that. Thank you, Lord, that it
[11:36] extends beyond our frailties as human
[11:38] beings. It extends beyond our abilities,
[11:41] Lord, or our Lord, our our disability,
[11:44] what our inability, whatever it is,
[11:46] Father, you your love is greater. And we
[11:48] thank you for that, Lord. We thank you
[11:51] that you have elective love towards us,
[11:53] that you chose us. No matter what
[11:55] happens in this earth, we know that
[11:58] we're still your chosen people. We thank
[12:00] you for that. We love you. We ask you to
[12:02] come in this service. Lord, I pray that
[12:04] you'd move me out of the way. Lord,
[12:07] speak directly to the people as you
[12:09] would speak to them, Lord, individually.
[12:11] We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God
[12:16] bless you. Turn with me if you would to
[12:18] Genesis chapter 35.
[12:20] Genesis chapter 35 and verse 2. It's
[12:23] good to be with you on Father's Day.
[12:25] Happy Father's Day to all of our
[12:26] fathers. I know that we got some
[12:28] visitors today and then several that are
[12:30] missing uh out honoring their fathers
[12:32] and going other places. And brother
[12:35] Harvey's over at uh Brother Mass this
[12:37] morning. They had a grandbaby being
[12:39] dedicated. So, it's always a a blessed
[12:41] time. But it's good to have you all here
[12:44] this morning. Genesis chapter 35 and
[12:46] verse two. Then Jacob said unto his
[12:49] household and to all that were with him,
[12:52] "Put away the strange gods that are
[12:54] among you, and be clean, and change your
[12:58] garments."
[12:59] If you can imagine Jacob getting his
[13:02] family up, like many of you did this
[13:04] morning, and some of you wives did this
[13:06] to your husbands, but Jacob did this to
[13:09] his family. He got them up. He said,
[13:10] "Let's go to church."
[13:13] He said, "Put away the strange gods that
[13:14] are among you. Be clean. change your
[13:17] garments. Let us arise and go up to
[13:19] Bethl, and I will make there an altar
[13:23] unto God, who answered me in the day of
[13:26] my distress, and was with me in the way
[13:30] which I went. Aren't you glad he's been
[13:32] with you? Amen. God bless you. I want to
[13:34] speak to you this morning on lead them
[13:36] to the altar. You may have your seats
[13:38] this morning.
[13:40] There's three basic biblical roles that
[13:45] a father plays that are expressions of a
[13:48] divine attribute that God chose to be
[13:51] displayed in fatherhood and and in in
[13:55] the in a man and especially as a father.
[13:58] And there are uh you know we're all
[14:01] uniquely made and we all serve a purpose
[14:04] and there's not one above another in
[14:06] that the mother serves a special
[14:08] purpose. You can't replace that. That's
[14:10] why you can't make a man a woman or a
[14:12] woman a man. You just can't do that. You
[14:14] can call yourself whatever you want to
[14:16] call yourself. God made you for
[14:19] something specific, for a specific role.
[14:22] And and and that that expresses a part
[14:24] of him because we are made in the image
[14:27] of God. And so there's something about
[14:30] motherhood that expresses a certain
[14:32] divine attribute of God as we talked
[14:34] about on Mother's Day. And there's
[14:36] something about fatherhood that
[14:37] expresses another divine attribute of
[14:40] God. It's something that's that's uh uh
[14:42] that God wanted to show in the earth as
[14:45] an attribute of himself. And the first
[14:48] attribute of of fatherhood that we find
[14:50] in the scripture is the attribute of
[14:52] protector. Protector. In Proverbs 14:26,
[14:56] it tells us about the Lord being our
[14:58] protector. And the fear of the Lord is
[15:00] strong confidence. and his children
[15:03] shall have a place of refuge. I'm not
[15:06] going to spend very long on this because
[15:07] I think most of us get this pretty
[15:09] pretty well that we would do just about
[15:12] anything to protect our our wives and
[15:14] our children as a husband, as a father,
[15:17] uh even just as a man here in the
[15:19] church, you would do just about anything
[15:21] to protect those that God has given you
[15:24] to protect. And and secondly, uh one of
[15:27] the things the attributes that comes out
[15:29] in a man is a provider. In Matthew 7 and
[15:33] verse 9, he talks about he said, "What
[15:35] man is there of you?" Notice what it
[15:38] says. What man is there of you? So, what
[15:40] kind of a a father, what father is
[15:43] there? What husband is there? Uh whom if
[15:45] his son asks bread, will he give him a
[15:47] stone? So, he's saying this is just your
[15:50] by nature, God has put something in you.
[15:52] If your son asks for bread, if he's
[15:54] hungry, you want to give him bread. And
[15:56] if he ask a fish, will he give him a
[15:58] serpent? If ye then, being evil, know
[16:02] how to give good gifts unto your
[16:03] children. So other words, there's
[16:05] something just innately about you, even
[16:07] though you're born in sin, shapen in
[16:09] iniquity, that wants to give good things
[16:11] to your children. How much more does
[16:13] God, your father, which is in heaven,
[16:16] will give good things to them that ask
[16:18] him. The Bible says, "You have not
[16:20] because you ask not." I think we ought
[16:22] to ask this morning if we need
[16:24] something. Our heavenly father, he his
[16:26] ear is not shut up to us. He's not He
[16:29] doesn't just discount what we ask for,
[16:31] but he wants to give us those things
[16:33] when they're for our good. Yeah. So, a
[16:36] good man is a provider. And I'll just
[16:38] hit on that for a moment because it's
[16:41] very important in 1 Timothy 5'8. But if
[16:43] any provide not for his own, and
[16:45] especially for those of his own house,
[16:48] he hath denied the faith and is worse
[16:50] than an infidel. In other words, worse
[16:52] than a denier of the faith. Even worse
[16:54] than an unbeliever, he's counted as an
[16:56] apostate actually to the word if he will
[16:59] not provide for his family. I think if
[17:01] we're if you're an able-bodied man
[17:03] living in this country and and the the
[17:06] mother of your children has to worry
[17:07] about where her next meal is coming from
[17:10] or the children's next meal is coming
[17:12] from, you got a problem.
[17:14] That we should be able to say amen to
[17:16] that. Right? And yet at the same time, I
[17:19] realize we, you know, that there's no
[17:21] calling. There's no sin in being poor.
[17:23] There's no sin in living simply. Amen.
[17:26] But but I wish more folks would do that.
[17:29] But a Christian father will provide for
[17:31] his children because that's the
[17:33] attribute of our father in heaven. He
[17:35] provides for us and we provide for those
[17:38] whom God has given us.
[17:41] So the third attribute of fatherhood is
[17:42] the one I want to focus on today. So we
[17:45] are protectors. We are providers and we
[17:49] are priests.
[17:52] A real father will lead his family to
[17:56] the altar. Yeah. Jacob said, "Let's get
[17:59] up this morning." Yeah. And get ready to
[18:02] go to church. And and not just go to
[18:05] church, but he said, "Let's clean
[18:07] ourselves up. Let's let's make ourselves
[18:09] ready." So a real father is not dragged
[18:12] by someone else to the house of the
[18:15] Lord. He's not dragged by uh by well the
[18:19] preacher will think bad of me or or the
[18:22] people you know they they'll think I'm
[18:24] backsided or something like that. A real
[18:26] father he he wants to go to the house of
[18:28] the Lord. There's something in him. He
[18:30] wants to lead his family. He's not going
[18:32] to follow his family to the altar, but
[18:34] he's actually going to build the altar
[18:36] that his family worships at and he's
[18:39] going to lead them to worship at that
[18:40] altar. Oh God, give us more fathers like
[18:43] that today that will lead their families
[18:45] to the altar. I think it's time we had
[18:47] some real men. I'm just going to preach
[18:49] to you this morning. But I get tired of
[18:51] of seeing a man following everybody
[18:53] around and every little wind of doctrine
[18:55] that comes by and every little thing
[18:57] comes along and every little
[18:58] discouragement he gets he he starts
[19:00] hanging out of church and and leaving
[19:02] his family and leading them in a wrong
[19:04] direction. It's time for some real men
[19:06] that will stand up and say, "I'm going
[19:08] to be a man in my house. I believe that
[19:10] God, no matter what happens, I believe
[19:12] God is right. I believe this message is
[19:14] right. I believe we're going to live for
[19:15] the Lord. We're going to do what's
[19:16] right. Time we had some real men. I know
[19:19] we want to put a lot of the blame on
[19:20] women. And I know on Mother's Day, we
[19:22] lift up the women and sometimes and the
[19:24] mothers and we should and and we lift up
[19:26] our fathers as well. But I want to
[19:28] challenge our fathers this morning. I
[19:30] want to challenge myself this morning to
[19:32] be a real man and lead my family to the
[19:35] altar.
[19:36] Not just at church, but to lead them at
[19:38] worship in my home. To make my home a
[19:40] place where the token is on display.
[19:42] That's something I can do.
[19:47] See, we know that Adam led his family to
[19:50] worship in the beginning because his
[19:53] adult sons both worshiped God.
[19:57] One of them did it wrong. One of them
[19:59] had a revelation and one didn't. But
[20:02] they both come and built an altar. Where
[20:04] did they learn to do that? Adam led his
[20:07] family to the altar.
[20:10] See, as God led him to the altar, as
[20:14] brother Ben talked about last week, how
[20:16] that how that they they they needed a
[20:18] savior and God provided a way. Aren't
[20:20] you glad that he did a way of blood that
[20:23] they could be saved? So, Adam led his
[20:25] family to worship. Though Cain worshiped
[20:29] because of of who he was, he had no
[20:31] revelation. But yet they led them to
[20:34] worship. Men do not only lead in worship
[20:37] though because of the fall. I know that
[20:40] the fall changed the uh the balance
[20:43] between the man and the woman. But a man
[20:46] men do not only lead in worship because
[20:48] of the fall. Leadership and worship was
[20:51] already established in the garden by who
[20:54] Adam was. When God made you a man, he
[20:57] made you a leader in worship. If you are
[21:00] a man and you have a wife and and
[21:03] children, you're obligated to lead your
[21:05] family to the altar by virtue of what
[21:08] God made you. And you say, "Well, what
[21:11] is that, Brother Ben? I'm I'm short. I'm
[21:13] fat. I'm skinny. I'm tall." Whatever it
[21:15] might be. That's not what I'm talking
[21:16] about. I'm talking about the image of
[21:18] God that he put in you that would lead
[21:20] your family to worship, that would lead
[21:22] your family to the altar, that would
[21:24] lead your family to the word of God, and
[21:27] and lead them in the right direction.
[21:29] not not be uh driven by the whims of
[21:33] what somebody wants to do or what your
[21:35] even your children would want to do or
[21:37] something else, but you you lead your
[21:39] family. You get them to buy into it. You
[21:43] you make it to where they they their
[21:45] expectation is that they would worship
[21:47] God. And this is a family that's going
[21:50] to stay in the house of God and do what
[21:52] God says
[21:54] right now. And that's that's what we
[21:56] want. I think most of the our women
[21:58] would would acknowledge and would would
[22:00] testify today that they want a man like
[22:02] that. They they want a husband like
[22:05] that. They want a father like that that
[22:07] would lead them to worship where they
[22:09] don't have to always remind them to pray
[22:10] and remind them to do this that or the
[22:12] other, but a man that'll lead his family
[22:14] into the house of the Lord. Yes.
[22:17] See, no matter how weak or ineffective
[22:19] you might be, and I know sometimes when
[22:21] we lose a job or or or sometimes men
[22:23] just they're raised in a culture that
[22:25] that that emasculates men and takes them
[22:28] to a place where they're just a bunch of
[22:30] idiots. Really, excuse the language, but
[22:32] that's what the culture makes a man just
[22:34] some kind of a bumbling fool. and and
[22:37] and men are are taken to that point and
[22:40] where they don't have any ability to do
[22:41] anything for themselves and and they're
[22:43] just led around everywhere. But no
[22:46] matter how weak or ineffective you might
[22:48] have been, no matter what you've done in
[22:49] your past, no matter what what you were
[22:52] before you become a Christian, you're
[22:54] still a man,
[22:56] right? And you still have the ability to
[22:58] lead your family in worship. You say,
[23:00] "Well, I've never done that." Well,
[23:01] today's the day to start doing it,
[23:05] right?
[23:06] So we we find the first worship that was
[23:09] Adam leading his family. Brother
[23:11] Brandham describes it so well. He said,
[23:13] "Now when God made man in the beginning
[23:14] to fellowship with him, then this man
[23:16] was in perfect fellowship in the garden
[23:19] of Eden. He was in perfect fellowship
[23:21] with God." Oh, I long for that. There's
[23:23] just something about a Christian, a real
[23:25] Christian, I believe, brother Bruce,
[23:26] that wants that perfect fellowship with
[23:28] God. You don't want anything in the way.
[23:30] You just want to you want to have that
[23:32] that that back and forth, that communion
[23:35] with God. And so you strive for that. He
[23:38] said, "How it must have been on that day
[23:39] when God would come down in the cool of
[23:42] the evening and call Adam and he and Eve
[23:46] would come up and they would worship God
[23:49] and they would fellowship and commune
[23:52] one with the other." He said, "That's
[23:55] the very thing that calls us together
[23:58] like this." Yeah. Remember they heard
[24:00] the voice of the Lord God in the midst
[24:03] of the garden and they hid themselves.
[24:05] Now listen, that's the very voice that
[24:07] calls us together today like this
[24:09] sitting together in heavenly places in
[24:12] Christ Jesus, fellowshipping in the Holy
[24:14] Spirit. No difference in us. We're all
[24:16] one in Christ Jesus in that perfect
[24:19] harmony of fellowship. He said there's
[24:21] nothing like it I've ever found on
[24:23] earth. It's to come together in heavenly
[24:24] places and have communion, fellowship
[24:26] with God, with each other. He said, "No,
[24:29] that's what God intended in the Garden
[24:31] of Eden." I believe if he intended to
[24:32] have that fellowship, that that church
[24:35] service, if you will, in the Garden of
[24:36] Eden, he still intends to have one
[24:38] today.
[24:40] Right. And he's still calling Adam to
[24:42] lead his family to worship. Yes.
[24:46] Good. He said, "What a beautiful
[24:48] picture. No harm, nothing could harm
[24:51] them. No sickness could ever come to
[24:53] them. They didn't even know what
[24:54] sickness was. They didn't know what old
[24:56] age was. They didn't know what being
[24:57] hurt was. They couldn't be hurt. They
[25:00] was in the presence of the omnipotent
[25:01] powers of God which held them in control
[25:04] and guided them by his spirit. There was
[25:06] nothing could harm them. Oh church, if
[25:09] you realize you're still in his power
[25:11] today, you're still in his presence
[25:13] today. There's nothing can harm you even
[25:16] now. We we think there is. We get scared
[25:18] by what's going on in the world. We get
[25:20] scared by sometimes even what happens in
[25:22] our own families. But there's nothing
[25:24] that can harm a child of God. Brother
[25:26] said, "There's nothing out of cater."
[25:29] Amen. He He said, "I believe that this
[25:32] little group of believers this morning
[25:34] could ever one time lay aside every
[25:36] thought and get down to the fact to know
[25:38] that the great Jehovah God that created
[25:41] you in the beginning, come on." Oh, I
[25:44] love this. You know, Brother Danny, it
[25:45] gives us as a pastor, it gives me
[25:47] courage when I see deacons in their
[25:49] position. When I see a song leader in
[25:51] his position, I see people in their
[25:53] position. It gives me courage because I
[25:55] know if they're in their position, then
[25:57] good can come from that. But don't you
[25:58] realize it's not just the preacher in
[26:00] his position, the pastor in his or the
[26:02] deacon in his. But God is in his
[26:04] position this morning. He's still on the
[26:07] throne. He's still the same yesterday,
[26:09] today, and forever. He can still take
[26:11] care of your problems. He can still heal
[26:13] the sick. He can still cleanse the
[26:15] leper. Do you believe that today?
[26:19] Hallelujah.
[26:21] He's here in his position in this
[26:24] tabernacle at the heart of every
[26:25] believer.
[26:27] He said, "Now in the beginning when God
[26:29] come down in the evening and talked to
[26:30] Adam and Eve in the cool of the day, his
[26:32] great voice whispered to them and they
[26:35] had fellowship, loved one another how
[26:38] the moving of the spirit went through
[26:39] the bushes. The lions come up, the
[26:42] tigers, all of them, and they worshiped
[26:46] the Lord." Yeah.
[26:48] Man was conscious at all times
[26:52] that his presence
[26:54] was with him.
[26:57] Before the fall, they were God
[27:00] conscious.
[27:02] When they fell, they immediately became
[27:05] self-conscious.
[27:07] You ever notice that? Before the fall,
[27:10] they were conscious that God was
[27:11] present. But after the fall, they become
[27:14] self-conscious. Yeah. So, you know where
[27:17] our self-consciousness in worship comes
[27:19] from. We be we begin to look at what
[27:21] somebody else is doing or how some other
[27:24] church does it or or how our brother our
[27:26] sister worships. But if we could just
[27:28] lose that this morning and and just
[27:30] worship God ourselves in the way that
[27:32] God made us and and just lift our hands
[27:35] to him or whatever way that God
[27:37] influences us to worship. Listen, if
[27:39] some of us would break out and begin to
[27:41] worship, things might be change even in
[27:43] the service. Might change for somebody
[27:45] else. If you'd become God conscious
[27:47] instead of self-conscious and realize he
[27:50] promised he would be here, Brother
[27:51] Jaden, and he is here this morning. He's
[27:53] here because he said he would be here.
[27:56] If you could become God conscious this
[27:58] morning and realize that he's right here
[28:00] to heal the sick. We don't have to wait.
[28:02] We got meetings coming up, but we don't
[28:04] have to wait on the meeting. We got we
[28:06] got uh we got some service coming up
[28:08] next week, but we don't have to wait on
[28:09] next week. We can this morning on a
[28:11] Father's Day. We can receive what we
[28:13] have need of because he's here. He's
[28:16] come down in the cool of the evening to
[28:18] fellowship with his children again. He's
[28:21] right at his position. He hasn't lost a
[28:23] step.
[28:25] Yes. They made themselves figs because
[28:28] they become self-conscious
[28:31] in worship.
[28:33] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[28:35] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[28:36] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[28:38] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[28:40] God amongst the trees of the garden. And
[28:42] the Lord God called unto Adam and said
[28:46] unto him, "Where art thou?"
[28:50] Because even though Eve had sinned, it
[28:52] was Adam who was responsible to lead his
[28:55] family to the altar.
[28:58] There there's no record in scripture of
[29:00] any mother,
[29:03] any woman actually. And just you ladies,
[29:07] hold on for just a minute. I got
[29:09] something for you, too. It'll I believe
[29:11] it'll encourage you. But there's no
[29:13] record in scripture of any woman
[29:15] building an altar. Do you know that?
[29:17] That never it was never
[29:21] Abraham built four altars.
[29:23] Noah built an altar. the first altar in
[29:25] Genesis 8:20. He built an altar and and
[29:28] offered. In Genesis 12:7 and 8, Abraham
[29:31] built an altar and the Lord appeared to
[29:32] him and he removed from then to Bethl
[29:34] built another altar to the Lord and
[29:36] called upon the name of the Lord.
[29:38] Abraham built a total of four altars.
[29:40] Sarah never built an altar. Why? She
[29:43] didn't have to.
[29:45] Abraham took care of that.
[29:50] Aren't you glad God's your father today?
[29:53] Amen. But Father Abraham took care of
[29:55] building the altars and leading his
[29:58] family to worship. He didn't leave it up
[30:01] to somebody else to pull him out of bed
[30:03] on Sunday morning, make him go to
[30:05] church. I've told you before that that
[30:09] one husband was not want to go to church
[30:11] and he was just all upset and and he he
[30:15] the wife woke him up and said, "Honey,
[30:16] it's time to go to church." And he said,
[30:18] "Well, the people don't like me." and
[30:20] and he said, "The preaching's terrible
[30:22] and the singing's terrible." He said, "I
[30:24] think I'll just stay in bed." He said,
[30:25] "But honey, you're the pastor.
[30:33] We got responsibilities, don't we?
[30:35] Somebody's got to lead the people to
[30:37] worship."
[30:40] Look, Sarah again, she didn't have to
[30:43] build an altar because Abraham took care
[30:45] of that.
[30:47] Now each one worshiped,
[30:49] right? Each one had to come individually
[30:51] and place his hand on the head of the
[30:54] lamb,
[30:55] right? As it was dying and get covered
[30:57] by the blood. Each one of them had to do
[30:59] that, right? But it was Abraham. It was
[31:02] the father who led his family to that
[31:05] place.
[31:07] Right. Because that's a divine attribute
[31:09] of God, how he led his children in the
[31:12] Garden of Eden to worship. Yes. And it's
[31:15] something that is in the heart of a man.
[31:17] And when he becomes a Christian, he
[31:19] wants to lead his family to worship. All
[31:22] right? And Satan has co-opted that and
[31:25] tried to take that away because he
[31:27] realizes the value of it.
[31:30] They each one had to worship. Each one
[31:32] had to become identified. Listen, you
[31:34] children can't go in because you have a
[31:35] good father. You got to have the Holy
[31:37] Ghost for yourself. You got to have the
[31:39] token for yourself. But the father's job
[31:41] is to lead you to that place. Lead them
[31:44] to that place. Get them in that
[31:46] atmosphere where they can feel the
[31:47] presence of God. Get them in that place
[31:49] where they can lay their hands on the
[31:51] head of the lamb.
[31:53] It ought to be our number one priority
[31:55] in life. Our number one our our number
[31:57] one desire in life. Yes, we want our
[31:59] children I want my children to marry
[32:00] good people. I want them to to survive.
[32:03] I want them to thrive. I want them to
[32:05] get good jobs. I want them to
[32:06] financially be secure. But my number one
[32:09] priority as a man is to be a priest in
[32:11] my family and lead my family to the
[32:13] altar and say, "This is where you find
[32:15] happiness. This is where you find joy.
[32:18] This is where you find the peace of God.
[32:20] This is where you find something that
[32:22] even if everything else falls apart,
[32:23] there'll be something that'll hold you
[32:25] through the hard times." Anybody testify
[32:27] with you this morning? You find
[32:29] something at the altar. A place where
[32:31] you can worship. Yes, sir.
[32:35] A place where your sins can be forgiven.
[32:38] A place where you can be clean. Yeah.
[32:42] And stand before God and come boldly
[32:45] before the throne of God.
[32:49] It was the man's responsibility in
[32:51] Exodus
[32:53] to dip the hissip in the blood of the
[32:55] lamb and offer it and strike it on the
[32:59] door of the house.
[33:03] But as I said, I want to encourage our
[33:05] sisters today because sometimes you
[33:08] might feel bad because you think, well,
[33:09] there's no father in the home to apply
[33:12] the token. But we have a heavenly
[33:14] father. Yeah.
[33:16] And God in his infinite mercy
[33:19] makes a provision.
[33:21] We find even in the Old Testament,
[33:23] there's three women, there's more than
[33:25] that, but there's but there's three
[33:26] women that I'm thinking of this morning
[33:28] that re type the gentile bride. And it's
[33:31] it's Rahab and and it's Esther and it's
[33:35] Ruth.
[33:36] And you'll find that Rahab come first.
[33:39] And God in his infinite mercy made a
[33:43] provision for Rahab.
[33:46] In Joshua 21:18 said, "Behold, when we
[33:48] come into the land, the the men are
[33:50] telling her, the spies are telling her,
[33:51] "This is what you need to do. When we
[33:53] come into the land, thou sh thou shalt
[33:55] bind this line of scarlet thread." There
[33:57] was no man there who was a believer.
[33:58] There was no father in the home that
[34:00] would help help her do it. There was
[34:02] nobody there to lead her to the altar.
[34:04] But what did she do? Come on, church.
[34:06] This ought to encourage you. The the
[34:08] spies told her, the preachers told her,
[34:10] they said, "Take this token and apply it
[34:13] to your house anyway." You say, "Well, I
[34:15] don't have a man to apply." You apply it
[34:17] anyway because God's going to keep your
[34:19] house. Amen.
[34:22] Hallelujah. And she said in verse 21,
[34:24] "According to your words, so be it."
[34:27] Where do you find? Brother said, "Full
[34:29] obedience to the full word of God
[34:31] entitles you to the token. According to
[34:33] your words, so be it." And she sent them
[34:35] away and they departed and she bound the
[34:38] scarlet line in the window. What do you
[34:40] do, mothers, when you don't have
[34:41] somebody there with you? What do you do
[34:43] if you're a widow and you don't have
[34:44] anybody there with you to help you? Or
[34:46] if you're a single woman, you don't have
[34:47] nobody there to help you. You take that
[34:49] token and apply it because God will see
[34:51] your token and he will pass over you.
[34:54] And she even saved her own father.
[34:58] Thank the Lord. God made a way. Men had
[35:02] let her down. They let her in the wrong
[35:03] way. They led her away from the altar.
[35:05] But she obeyed the word and saved her
[35:08] house.
[35:10] Yes.
[35:11] Hallelujah.
[35:13] How God hears your prayers. He sees you
[35:16] when you put that token, apply that
[35:18] token over your house. Yeah. Hey, don't
[35:20] you don't make it an excuse either and
[35:22] say, "Well, I don't have a man in the
[35:23] home, so I can't really lead my Yes, you
[35:25] can. You can lead your children to the
[35:27] house of God." Rahab did it. God made a
[35:29] way for her to come under the token.
[35:34] Hallelujah. He said he's a father of the
[35:36] fathers, a judge of the widows. is God
[35:39] in his holy habitation. Amen. I'm so
[35:42] thankful for that today.
[35:45] Amen. I'm so thankful for that. I think
[35:47] of Rahab. And then you find Esther, just
[35:50] to drop this in here before we go along.
[35:52] Esther was uh or Ruth rather was the
[35:55] next one. And and Esther or Rahab was a
[35:58] harlot. Ruth was somebody who had been
[36:00] married before, but her husband had
[36:01] died. And Ruth goes in. Notice that God
[36:05] allowed these women were a type of the
[36:07] Gentile bride. And the gentile bride is
[36:09] to come boldly. Whether you're a man,
[36:10] whether you're a woman, whether you're a
[36:12] boy, whether you're a girl, you're to
[36:13] come boldly to the throne of God. Yeah.
[36:16] Right. Right. We're not to hold back at
[36:17] all. No matter what gender you are, no
[36:19] matter what what what it is, you you
[36:21] come boldly to the throne of God. Yeah.
[36:24] Right. Because you individually are a
[36:26] child of God.
[36:28] Can we understand that today? It's not
[36:30] just the preacher or somebody else. We
[36:32] can each individually come boldly to the
[36:34] altar because Rahab, it was Rahab who
[36:37] tied the scarlet thread. It was Ruth who
[36:39] went down to the threshing floor. Come
[36:41] on.
[36:43] God showing us something about a gentile
[36:45] bride. The Lord was speaking to me this
[36:48] morning. I believe it was him. And just
[36:49] these things begin to come to me. I
[36:51] don't have it in my notes, but God was
[36:53] showing us something that there's a
[36:54] gentile bride that's not going to take
[36:57] make any excuses. They're going to come
[36:59] and do what's necessary to rechieve what
[37:01] God's given them. Ruth went down to the
[37:04] threshing floor. And when you come now
[37:06] to you got Rahab and then Ruth and you
[37:08] come down to to Esther. Esther was a a
[37:11] virgin and she come to be married to a
[37:14] king. You see the process of redemption
[37:16] coming through as it builds up and you
[37:18] find then that she's a virgin. You're a
[37:20] virgin bride. Your old marriage has been
[37:22] enulled. It's been a done away with and
[37:25] you come a virgin bride. She never did
[37:26] it in the first place. Esther comes as a
[37:29] virgin bride. What does she do? She
[37:32] doesn't wait. But she goes into the king
[37:36] and she touched he extends the golden
[37:38] scepter. You remember? She might have
[37:40] died, but she went anyway. So God is
[37:43] showing us there's something about us as
[37:45] Gentiles that we don't, you know, we
[37:47] don't we we don't have to wait on
[37:48] nobody. We can go for ourselves. Listen,
[37:50] you young people, you can go to the
[37:52] altar of God yourself and receive help
[37:54] in time of need. You you widows can go
[37:57] to the house of God, to the altar of
[37:58] God, and find help in time of need. You
[38:00] don't you don't have to wait on anybody
[38:02] else. Yeah. You can make it if nobody
[38:05] else makes it. Yeah. Are you with me
[38:08] now?
[38:10] I got to move on. There's a whole sermon
[38:11] in that somewhere, Brother Stewart.
[38:16] But that was our type, our our gentile
[38:18] type. In the New Testament, we're all
[38:19] made kings and priests.
[38:23] Revelation 5:9 tells us,
[38:26] we're going to come back to the role of
[38:27] the man in a moment, but it tells us
[38:29] they sung a new song, saying, "Thou art
[38:31] worthy to take the book." Do you believe
[38:33] he's worthy today? To open the seals
[38:36] thereof, for that was saint. See, we
[38:37] don't worship because we feel good. We
[38:39] worship because he's worthy. Well, we
[38:42] don't want we don't want to just have a
[38:43] good atmosphere when we feel good. We
[38:45] don't shout just when we feel good. We
[38:47] don't go We don't get excited when the
[38:49] preaching gets loud. But what is it?
[38:51] He's worthy of our praise. He's worthy
[38:53] every day of the week, every hour of the
[38:55] day. Thou was are worthy to take the
[38:59] book, and has redeemed us to God by thy
[39:01] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[39:02] and people and nation, and hast made us
[39:05] unto our God, kings and priests, and we
[39:09] shall reign on the earth. 1 Peter 2:9.
[39:10] that you are a chosen generation, a
[39:13] royal priesthood, a king and a priest, a
[39:16] priest king, a holy nation, a peculiar
[39:18] people, that you should show forth the
[39:20] praises of him who has called you out of
[39:22] darkness into his marvelous light.
[39:24] Hebrews 13:15, by him, therefore, let us
[39:27] offer the sacrifice of praise to God
[39:29] continually. That is the fruit of our
[39:31] lips, giving thanks to his name. What is
[39:33] it? You because of him. By him, because
[39:36] of his sacrifice, he is a great high
[39:38] priest who can be touched by the feeling
[39:40] of our infirmity. And because of him, we
[39:42] can enter into the holy of holies and
[39:44] offer our sacrifice of praise. That's
[39:47] not limited to men. It's a priesthood of
[39:50] believers.
[39:52] Are you with me now?
[39:55] Brother says, "What a high priest we
[39:56] have. What a priesthood that we're in.
[40:00] The priesthood of the circumcision, not
[40:01] of flesh, but of the heart. the heart
[40:04] circumcised by the Holy Ghost. That's
[40:06] right. Then you can offer praise and
[40:08] adorations to God, the spiritual
[40:10] sacrifice. Your lips pouring out praise
[40:14] unto him.
[40:16] I wonder, church, when was the last time
[40:17] your lips,
[40:20] poured out praise.
[40:24] Come on, church. I'm not I I'm not
[40:26] knocking you this morning. I'm preaching
[40:28] to myself, too. I say, "God, when I come
[40:30] to your altar, let me stand there and
[40:32] say, Lord, you're worthy. My lips pour
[40:34] out praise. Let my lips pour out
[40:37] praise." Not a little trickle, not a
[40:39] little, not not a not not a word now and
[40:40] then, but a pouring out of praise.
[40:44] Said the other night when the people
[40:45] were standing there, he said, "Where a
[40:47] little blind baby laying in the mother's
[40:48] arms, his little eyes were blind. But
[40:50] after being prayed for, holding the
[40:52] little baby in my own arms like that,
[40:54] looking at, I was looking out. I said,
[40:55] "Mother, it sees the light." She looked
[40:58] at it. She put her hands before it. It
[41:00] batted to the lies and I took my hand.
[41:02] It followed my hand around like that. He
[41:03] said, "While the people just rose, those
[41:05] rafters rang with the praises." Somebody
[41:07] stood there and said, "They make a lot
[41:09] of noise." I said, "If they'd hold their
[41:10] peace, then I believe the rafters would
[41:12] praise God. Something's got to take
[41:15] place." Have we had stuff shaken in
[41:17] front of us so much we can't even
[41:19] respond anymore? Come on, church. We
[41:21] need We need to recognize who's here.
[41:23] But he's still the same God. The same
[41:25] God that healed that blind baby in 1947
[41:28] is the same God that's in Word of Life
[41:30] tabernacle this morning. I know he's
[41:33] God. I've seen him work. I've seen him
[41:34] heal the sick. We've got testimonies
[41:36] right here in this building when he's
[41:38] healed the sick and and healed cancer
[41:40] and healed and brought babies when there
[41:42] shouldn't have been a baby. We've got
[41:44] things that have happened right here
[41:45] among us. I held in my own arms a baby
[41:48] with a cleft lip who was healed in
[41:49] Africa. The same God that was in Africa
[41:52] that morning. It's the same God that's
[41:54] here this morning.
[41:56] [Applause]
[41:58] Hallelujah.
[42:02] Every priest,
[42:04] how many kings and priests have we got
[42:05] here this morning? Are you born again?
[42:07] That's what you are. Every priest ought
[42:08] to go beyond behind the holy of holies.
[42:10] Brother Brandon said it was death to go
[42:12] in back then. Now it's death to stay
[42:13] out. Every priest ought to go behind the
[42:15] holy of holies and pour out praise.
[42:19] I'm not talking about being loud in
[42:21] church. That that that's part of it. I'm
[42:23] talking about an everyday walk. I'm
[42:24] talking about every day. Lord, I thank
[42:26] you. I love you. I worship you today.
[42:32] True.
[42:35] Brother said every priest in the Old
[42:37] Testament could go behind the Holy of
[42:38] Holies and get a mouthful of original
[42:41] mana. Yeah.
[42:44] Because that mana was kept an armor of
[42:47] mana was kept and reproduced itself in
[42:50] the Holy of Holies. It's still there.
[42:55] Come on, church. If you hadn't had if
[42:56] you hadn't had worship for a while, if
[42:58] you've been dry and and and you felt
[43:00] like a desert for a while, maybe you
[43:02] gotten back sit on God, but behind the
[43:04] Holy of Holies, behind the curtain
[43:06] that's been rent, is a place where you
[43:08] can go and find the Pentecostal blessing
[43:10] again. It's still there for you. The
[43:13] original word has been restored back to
[43:15] us. You can have that in your life
[43:17] again. You can know the presence of God.
[43:19] You can live for God. You can be
[43:21] forgiven of everything. You can live
[43:23] there in the Holy of Holies. You don't
[43:25] have to live on the outside wishing you
[43:26] could get inside. Brother Brandon said
[43:28] in the Old Testament, they long to go
[43:30] inside. And now the doors been thrown
[43:32] open and the veil's been ripped from top
[43:34] to bottom. And we can go inside. Oh,
[43:37] what a privilege it is this morning to
[43:39] go behind this the veil into the Holy of
[43:42] Holies.
[43:45] Brother said when they went behind
[43:47] there, they could taste where they had a
[43:48] pot full of original full of mana that
[43:51] fell at the beginning was kept in there
[43:53] only for the priesthood. He said, "We
[43:55] know that, but now the veil is rent. Not
[43:58] only the priesthood, but every one of
[43:59] us." Someone say it with me. Every one
[44:01] of us can be royal priests.
[44:04] come in and take a taste of the original
[44:06] mana. The kind that fell on the day of
[44:09] Pentecost, the mana for the church, the
[44:10] Holy Ghost, the armor, what we're
[44:12] fortified, not with intellectual
[44:14] education, doctor's degree, but we are
[44:16] fortified with the baptism of the Holy
[44:18] Ghost to prove the word of God is the
[44:20] truth. Listen, you can have an
[44:21] intellectual conception of this message
[44:23] and know all the ins and outs of it, but
[44:25] you got to have something in your heart
[44:26] that you believe that there's something
[44:28] inside of you responds to the word of
[44:30] God. It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[44:32] That's the original man. Good.
[44:38] Excuse me. Say, "Well, I'd go to the
[44:41] church."
[44:43] I'm just reading now. I'd praise the
[44:46] Lord if I felt like it. Well, now
[44:50] a priest is to make a sacrifice.
[44:55] Hallelujah.
[44:56] [Laughter]
[44:57] You realize what he did? That role in
[44:59] the Old Testament was reserved just for
[45:01] a man. Not just a man, but one man, a
[45:03] certain man, the high priest of that
[45:05] year is the only one who could go behind
[45:07] the Holy of Holies.
[45:10] But now he's
[45:13] the great high priest come and he rent
[45:15] the veil and the mercy seat was in plain
[45:17] view hanging on the cross. Go listen to
[45:21] the unveiling of of God. Brother said,
[45:23] "The mercy seat, the mighty God unveiled
[45:25] before us." Mercy seats hanging there
[45:28] between heavens and earth. And when it
[45:30] did, we were we were able to go behind
[45:31] the veil. And what he did is he made a
[45:34] way for every one of us to put on those
[45:36] priests robes and and let that that
[45:38] aroma come over us and walk into the
[45:41] holy of holies.
[45:45] That'll be better than any movie you
[45:46] could watch.
[45:49] It'd be better than a silver dollar
[45:50] city. And I like Silver Dollar City.
[45:53] It's better than Dollywood. Brother
[45:54] Andrew Glover happens to hear this.
[46:01] I'm sorry, guys.
[46:04] Some of our folks from Tennessee over
[46:05] here.
[46:08] I happen to like that place, but I know
[46:10] a place that's better.
[46:13] It don't cost near as much to get into.
[46:15] He said, "Come without money, without
[46:17] price." Oh, come on, church. Don't you
[46:20] want to go in? Don't you want to go
[46:21] behind the Holy of Holies again? Don't
[46:23] you want to know what it's like to make
[46:25] a spiritual sacrifice? Today I'm going
[46:27] to serve God with all of my heart. Today
[46:29] I'm going to go in and take advantage.
[46:32] Yes. Hallelujah.
[46:35] All right.
[46:39] You go down. He said
[46:42] he said a priest is making a sacrifice.
[46:44] You, the congregation, are high priests
[46:46] of God to make a spiritual sacrifice.
[46:48] It's the fruit of your lips giving
[46:49] praise to God. You go down and say,
[46:51] "Well, if I felt like it, I'd go over
[46:53] and testify to somebody." Well, do it
[46:55] anyhow.
[46:56] If you're a high priest, brother, it's
[46:58] burning in your heart whether you feel
[47:00] like doing it or not. Go do it anyhow
[47:02] because you got to make a sacrifice.
[47:05] Something that's hard to do.
[47:07] Come on. I know men like to challenge
[47:09] themselves,
[47:10] right? We like to find out,
[47:13] brother Logan, how much we can bench
[47:15] press. You know, we like to challenge
[47:18] ourselves. Well, some of y'all do.
[47:21] How many miles you can walk, how many
[47:23] holes you can dig. Brother Harvey
[47:25] outworked me yesterday out here digging
[47:27] holes for the landscaping
[47:30] and he he's not here this morning. So I
[47:32] say he's not old, but that man can work
[47:35] and he's quite a bit older than I am.
[47:37] And I'm out there, my heart's racing and
[47:39] I'm panting, you know, and
[47:43] because I'm out of shape. But men like
[47:45] to challenge themselves.
[47:48] We like We like That's why they climb
[47:50] mountains. That's why they ask why do
[47:53] men climb mountains? because they're
[47:54] there,
[47:56] right? You guys just climb some
[47:58] mountains, didn't you? It's just
[47:59] something to do. We were all asking
[48:01] ourselves, why would people go hiking on
[48:02] their honeymoon? Like that's
[48:05] Sorry,
[48:07] but it's just it's just there, right?
[48:09] You want to do it. You want to challenge
[48:11] yourself. Challenge yourself with this.
[48:14] I want to be a real man today. I want to
[48:17] flex my spiritual muscles. I want to
[48:19] walk in behind the veil. I want to go to
[48:21] the Holy of Holies. I want to worship
[48:23] him like never before. I want to lead my
[48:25] family to the house of God.
[48:31] With the same kind of ferveny, some of
[48:32] you would do anything to protect your
[48:34] family. You would do anything to provide
[48:37] for your family. But will you be a
[48:39] priest this morning and go in?
[48:44] Very good. Brother Brand, a little
[48:46] confusion.
[48:48] He said comes in the church, you don't
[48:49] run over to one side and pout now. Oh
[48:52] my.
[48:54] He said, "You you if you are, you sure
[48:56] ain't a priest." See, he said, "See, you
[48:58] pray through spiritual sacrifice, the
[49:00] fruits of our lips, giving praise to his
[49:02] name."
[49:04] Well, you say, "I just don't feel like
[49:06] going to church." But you're a priest.
[49:08] It's your duty. You've got to be there.
[49:09] I feel for some of our technical workers
[49:11] in the church. Because some of y'all,
[49:13] they're hiding behind them screens back
[49:15] there now. But some of y'all, you know,
[49:16] they work so hard on the technical
[49:18] aspects and many of you guys don't ever
[49:20] know what goes on in that. And that's
[49:22] not your fault. It's just cuz you're not
[49:23] doing it. And and so our young people
[49:25] take the brunt of that. And sometimes
[49:27] they we're going back and forth for the
[49:29] service trying to get everything
[49:30] working. And and and those of you
[49:31] deacons, you know what I'm talking
[49:33] about. Some of you trustees know what
[49:34] I'm talking about. You're worried about
[49:35] other things, thinking about other
[49:36] things, and you got to fix things and do
[49:38] things and protect people and and help
[49:40] people during the service.
[49:43] But listen, we're still preached
[49:46] when you get done doing that. Brother
[49:48] Peter, you got to still go in
[49:51] them. Come on. When you get done, and
[49:54] again, I feel for them because so that's
[49:56] why I try to rotate them and things
[49:57] where we can we can make it where they
[49:59] don't have to be back there all the
[50:00] time, but you're still a priest.
[50:02] You still belong in the house of God.
[50:04] Whether you're back behind the screen or
[50:06] or or you're up in the sound booth,
[50:07] Brother Robert, or or you're sitting
[50:09] here in the sanctuary, whether you feel
[50:11] good or you don't feel good, we're going
[50:12] in behind the veil today. It's a pouring
[50:15] out of praise, offering our sacrifice of
[50:17] praise to God. So, well, you say, "I
[50:20] just don't feel like going to church."
[50:21] But you're a priest. It's your duty.
[50:23] You've got to be there.
[50:27] I'm challenging us today, right?
[50:32] He said,
[50:34] he said, "Well, I just don't feel like
[50:36] taking a part in the service. You're He
[50:39] said, "You're a priest making a
[50:41] sacrifice, a spiritual sacrifice, not
[50:44] giving somebody some hand me down." He
[50:46] said, "As they call it today, that's all
[50:48] good. Have nothing against it." Not
[50:49] going to get somebody to come to church.
[50:50] It's all good. I have nothing against
[50:52] it. But it's you, you making the
[50:55] spiritual sacrifice, the fruit of your
[50:57] lips giving praise to his name.
[50:59] He said when you see a time coming
[51:02] listen that everybody blaspheing
[51:05] saying these things doing things wrong.
[51:11] Can I can I be very direct today? We're
[51:13] living in that time. I believe a prophet
[51:16] of God spoke these things for for now.
[51:19] When you see a time coming
[51:22] what are we living in that time?
[51:25] Everybody blaspheming, saying these
[51:27] things, doing things wrong. What do you
[51:30] do? Come on. Come on. Walk away.
[51:34] Come on, buddy.
[51:36] Come on, church. The greater the sin
[51:39] there is, the greater problems in the
[51:40] church, the greater struggles going on
[51:42] in the message of the hour, the greater
[51:44] desire there ought to be in our hearts
[51:46] to walk into the Holy of Holies,
[51:49] come in behind the veil. Good. When we
[51:52] see a time coming, when there's websites
[51:54] everywhere, people saying the message
[51:55] isn't true and this isn't true and that
[51:57] isn't true. When we see a time coming,
[51:59] when people are are claiming the message
[52:01] and don't live it anymore, when people
[52:03] are claiming to do this, that, and the
[52:04] other, but they don't really have a
[52:06] desire in their heart anymore, what do
[52:07] you do? Go in behind the Holy of Holies,
[52:10] make a sacrifice of praise. You're
[52:12] supposed to stand there with a spiritual
[52:14] sacrifice, saying, "The blood of Jesus
[52:16] Christ cleanses from all sin, makes me a
[52:18] new creature in Christ Jesus." Yes. He
[52:20] said, they say you're crazy fellow.
[52:22] According to what you say, it's all
[52:23] right. But to me, it's the power of God
[52:25] to salvation. I believe it. They say you
[52:28] believe in divine healing. Oh, I I don't
[52:30] know. You better ask our pastor. He
[52:31] said, "What do you think about it?"
[52:33] You're the priest now. Yeah. Come on,
[52:36] church. We don't believe in nickelism.
[52:39] We don't put it all behind the pullpit,
[52:41] but it's out in the congregation. What
[52:43] do you think about it? You're the
[52:44] priest. You're the guy. Yes, sir. I
[52:46] believe it because God's word says it's
[52:48] so. You believe in the baptism of the
[52:49] Holy Spirit? Yes, sir. How do you know
[52:51] I've received it? Listen, you don't have
[52:53] to wait on your pastor to tell you that
[52:55] God's still God. You don't have to wait
[52:56] on your pastor to tell you you can be
[52:58] healed. You don't have to wait on some
[52:59] other man to speak some word over you.
[53:01] You can be healed. The Bible says he was
[53:03] he was wounded for my from my oh my from
[53:07] my transgression. By his stripes, I'm
[53:09] healed.
[53:11] I'm a priest.
[53:13] I've eaten that man. I can go in.
[53:19] Both men and women are priests today.
[53:21] Spiritual priests in the royal
[53:23] priesthood. Neither Jew nor Greek.
[53:25] Neither bond nor free. Neither male nor
[53:27] female. For you are all one in Christ
[53:30] Jesus. And yet men have not lost
[53:34] that that standard and that image of God
[53:37] to lead their families
[53:39] to worship.
[53:41] Right? Because Paul says in 1
[53:42] Corinthians 11:3, the same one who says
[53:44] there's neither male nor female, he
[53:46] said, I would have you know the head of
[53:48] every man is Christ, and the head of the
[53:50] woman is the man, and the head of Christ
[53:53] is God.
[53:58] Come on, church. Head means more than
[54:01] saying, "I'm going to decide where we go
[54:03] to dinner tonight. Bless God."
[54:08] Now, you know, you don't get to do that.
[54:13] cuz it ain't worth it.
[54:17] I'm sorry. I'm just messing with you.
[54:21] But that's not what it's about. I'm
[54:23] going to be head of my house when I come
[54:25] in. Bless God. I don't know what it is
[54:27] about being a man. Makes you want to
[54:28] pull your pants up, you know. But
[54:34] feel like brother Wendle standing up
[54:35] here pulling my pants up.
[54:38] [Laughter]
[54:40] Bless God. I'm going to be a man today
[54:42] and their dishes are going to be washed
[54:43] and the and the floors are going to be
[54:46] mopped and I'm going to sit in my chair
[54:48] and rule as a king in my castle.
[54:51] That's not what a head is.
[54:55] A head is somebody who leads his family.
[55:00] Brother Brandon puts on an apron. He was
[55:01] ahead.
[55:03] He was being the head of his home,
[55:04] exercising his headship.
[55:07] By putting on an apron and helping his
[55:09] wife wash the dishes.
[55:11] Are you with me now? He's exercising.
[55:14] How did God do it to you? How did the
[55:17] bridegroom woo you to him? Did he come
[55:20] in and
[55:22] you know smite you? Exercise his
[55:25] headship in that way. He didn't do it.
[55:27] What did he do? He wooed you to him. He
[55:30] called you to him. He led you to him.
[55:34] Being a man is not going out and and
[55:37] knocking things around and going in and
[55:40] throwing things and punching a hole in a
[55:41] wall. A man is somebody who will lead
[55:44] his family by the word, who will submit
[55:46] to the headship of God himself and then
[55:48] sub and cause his family to come under
[55:50] headship.
[55:52] And you can't abdicate that
[55:53] responsibility to anybody else.
[55:56] The truth.
[55:58] I'm not going to be able to blame my
[56:00] wife
[56:01] if my if my kids get to the point where
[56:04] they just they can't stand being at home
[56:06] because there's abuse at home or there's
[56:08] there's not. But if it that was the
[56:10] case, there's abuse at home or there's I
[56:13] can't blame my wife. There's a bad
[56:15] atmosphere in the house and they just
[56:16] want to soon as they get good old enough
[56:18] they want to leave. That is that's not
[56:19] my wife's fault. It's not my kids'
[56:21] fault. That's on me. Right. Right.
[56:24] Because I'm the head. Yeah. Are you with
[56:27] me now? I can't blame them for that. I I
[56:30] I've got to do that. I I got a
[56:31] responsibility
[56:33] to raise them right. They may leave when
[56:35] they get old enough and try to go out
[56:37] and and sew their wild oats and do their
[56:39] own thing. But I'll tell you this, if
[56:40] I've I've got a promise, if I've raised
[56:42] them right, that they will return. Oh,
[56:45] thank God for that promise today. They
[56:48] will return. But I don't believe we have
[56:49] to lose our families. I believe we can
[56:50] raise them right. Yeah. Do the right
[56:53] things. Be a man. be a leader. Yes, sir.
[56:58] Listen, Paul says, "I suffer not a woman
[57:00] to teach, nor to usurp authority over
[57:01] the man, but to be in silence." Again,
[57:03] that's not because she's lower. It's
[57:05] because she's given a different role.
[57:08] Right? For Adam, he said, was first
[57:10] formed and then Eve and Adam, so this is
[57:14] predates the fall,
[57:16] he doesn't go back immediately to the
[57:18] fall. He goes back to the creation and
[57:19] then to the fall. Adam was not deceived,
[57:22] but the woman being being deceived was
[57:23] in the transgression. So, it's a man's
[57:25] job to lead his family to the altar.
[57:29] Not just any altar, but one where the
[57:32] blood is.
[57:34] And the modern church, if you just
[57:36] excuse me for a moment, but it's led by
[57:38] women. And brother Brandon talked about
[57:40] that in the preview of the bride. He saw
[57:41] that coming where the the American
[57:43] church, he said, was led by a witch.
[57:45] Yeah. And and but you remember the bride
[57:48] was not led by man at all, but they were
[57:50] looking towards the the prophet and the
[57:53] one standing by him, right? They were
[57:55] following the message and looking to
[57:56] Christ. Are you with me now? So, but the
[58:00] modern church is led by women. In fact,
[58:02] in 1960, there was 2% of the clergy
[58:05] overall in America were women. Today,
[58:07] it's 20%. And in uh in in most major
[58:12] churches, liberal churches, half of the
[58:14] pastors or more are women. And and if
[58:17] you look at most Lutheran, Methodist,
[58:18] and even Pentecostal churches, the
[58:20] churches are controlled by women. Even
[58:22] our local Catholic church, I've watched
[58:24] that dynamic. And there's a few women
[58:26] that really they kind of run that show.
[58:29] And they can't be priests in the
[58:30] Catholic church, but they do that. And
[58:32] so that's that's everywhere. and and and
[58:35] but we can't abdicate our responsibility
[58:37] as men in this message,
[58:40] right? Where where are men who will take
[58:42] their role seriously? Listen, if you're
[58:43] the only one that can preach and teach,
[58:45] you ought to take that seriously,
[58:48] right?
[58:50] Listen, none of us, again, we wouldn't
[58:52] let our wife go out and fight an
[58:53] intruder. I hope not anyway.
[58:57] And I don't like to be woke up, but and
[59:00] some of you may be better shots than
[59:01] your husband, so I guess that's okay.
[59:02] You know, kind of equalizes it. But but
[59:06] you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't let my
[59:08] wife go out if I really thought there
[59:09] was a danger.
[59:12] If I really thought there was a danger
[59:13] to my home, she's not going to stand
[59:15] between me and an intruder.
[59:18] I'm not just saying that. That's just a
[59:19] fact. I think all of you men could agree
[59:21] with that, right? Because you're a
[59:24] protector,
[59:26] right? I if you can't like listen,
[59:28] you're going to do everything you can to
[59:29] provide for your family if you're a man
[59:31] because you're a provider.
[59:34] But what what will you do when it comes
[59:35] to being a priest? You see, you wouldn't
[59:38] let you wouldn't volunteer your wife to
[59:40] serve in the military.
[59:42] To come down to it, don't take me. She's
[59:44] man, she fights all the time. She's good
[59:46] at it.
[59:51] You wouldn't do that. You wouldn't send
[59:53] her out there. It was one of the shames
[59:56] of this country is when they started
[59:57] putting women in battlefield roles in
[59:59] the military. It's a shame we didn't
[1:00:01] need it for over 200 years. Why do we
[1:00:03] need it now?
[1:00:05] Because the men have abdicated the
[1:00:06] responsibility
[1:00:08] to lead on the battlefield and
[1:00:09] everywhere else.
[1:00:11] But the altar, what is it? It's a
[1:00:13] spiritual battleground. Yeah. When we
[1:00:15] come to church, we don't come to play
[1:00:17] church. We come to lead our families
[1:00:19] into battle. Come on. We're not going to
[1:00:21] abdicate our responsibility. Listen what
[1:00:24] Joshua tells his family and and and the
[1:00:27] nation. In that day, he said, "Now
[1:00:28] therefore, fear the Lord. Serve him in
[1:00:30] sincerity and in truth. Put away the
[1:00:32] gods which your father served on the
[1:00:33] other side of the flood in Egypt. Serve
[1:00:35] you the Lord. If it seem evil unto you
[1:00:37] to serve the Lord, choose you this day
[1:00:39] whom you will serve, whether the gods
[1:00:41] which your fathers served were on the
[1:00:42] other side of the flood, or the gods of
[1:00:44] the Amorites in whose land you dwell.
[1:00:46] But as for me and my house, we will
[1:00:49] serve the Lord." What did he do? He led
[1:00:52] them to the altar of God. said, "My
[1:00:53] family's going to stay here at the
[1:00:55] altar."
[1:00:57] You say, "Well, I have to be a great
[1:01:01] forceful man to do that." No, you don't.
[1:01:05] You don't have to be. We don't lead by
[1:01:07] force. We lead by example.
[1:01:10] Brother Brandon told the story about the
[1:01:12] father was delivering Christmas
[1:01:13] presents. You all know the story. He He
[1:01:15] was delivering Christmas presents.
[1:01:16] everywhere he'd go, he'd get a little
[1:01:17] bit of eggnog. Yeah. And before long, he
[1:01:20] got tipsy
[1:01:22] and he's staggering in the snow
[1:01:25] going like this. You know, y'all thought
[1:01:27] it was going to fall off, didn't you?
[1:01:30] He's just staggering.
[1:01:32] And when he did,
[1:01:34] he he said he he's making a crooked path
[1:01:37] in the snow like this. And his little
[1:01:40] boy wanted to follow him and help
[1:01:42] deliver the Christmas presents. And he
[1:01:43] was following him. He looked back and
[1:01:45] this little boy was walking like this.
[1:01:47] He's just following his daddy's
[1:01:49] footsteps.
[1:01:50] He couldn't make it on his own. Listen,
[1:01:52] it's our example that leads our
[1:01:54] families, not what we say. That's right.
[1:01:57] It's what we do. Yeah.
[1:02:00] It's what we do.
[1:02:03] Our example, we lead our family to the
[1:02:06] altar by example.
[1:02:09] See, the greatest man who ever lived was
[1:02:11] Jesus. He was the example of men. And he
[1:02:14] said, "Take my yoke upon you and learn
[1:02:16] of me, for I am meek and lowly in
[1:02:20] heart." He was not some outspoken, you
[1:02:23] know, brash He-Man sort of a guy.
[1:02:29] He was a man of sorrows and acquainted
[1:02:31] with grief.
[1:02:33] A man who wept at the grave of Lazarus.
[1:02:37] A man who wept over Jerusalem.
[1:02:41] Come on. Real men weep for their
[1:02:43] families.
[1:02:45] They may be stoic in public for the sake
[1:02:47] of their wives and their children, but
[1:02:49] in their hearts, tears are dropping.
[1:02:52] Real men are moved by the word of God.
[1:02:58] Moved to action by the word of God. like
[1:03:01] Shamgar was when he sat there that day
[1:03:03] and he and he he saw his wives and his
[1:03:05] family in that that or his wife and his
[1:03:07] children in that in that condition and
[1:03:09] he looked at him and he said he said I I
[1:03:12] there's something in my heart. I know
[1:03:13] I'm a son of God. The word moved him. I
[1:03:17] know I'm a son of Abraham and the and
[1:03:18] the and and the Bible or or I've been
[1:03:21] taught that that I'll possess the gate
[1:03:23] of my enemies. So he jumped out in the
[1:03:25] middle of 600 Philistines with a with an
[1:03:27] ox goat and beat them all to death. Why?
[1:03:30] He was moved by the word to a response
[1:03:33] to the word. Oh, that there could be men
[1:03:35] in the house of God this morning that
[1:03:37] could be moved by the word to make a
[1:03:39] response.
[1:03:43] It's not muscles. Somebody said he isn't
[1:03:45] a man. He's got shoulders that wide and
[1:03:46] arms that big. He said he might be a
[1:03:48] brute. He might not have an ounce of man
[1:03:51] in him. You don't judge a man by muscle.
[1:03:54] You judge a man by character. Amen. You
[1:03:56] don't judge a man by the callous in his
[1:03:58] hand, but by the bags in the knees of
[1:04:00] his pants when he's been praying.
[1:04:04] Oh God, help me today. I'm preaching to
[1:04:06] myself, too. I don't mean to make it too
[1:04:08] heavy for you on Father's Day, but I
[1:04:10] just want to challenge us.
[1:04:12] That's what we need today. Some more men
[1:04:14] like that got real godly, oldfashioned
[1:04:16] Holy Ghost conviction.
[1:04:20] I'm gonna preach it myself now. He said,
[1:04:23] 'Oh, brother, when the weakling's a
[1:04:25] preacher.' I like the way he put that.
[1:04:27] When I first saw that, I thought he got
[1:04:28] that backwards, but he didn't say when
[1:04:31] the preacher's a weakling. He said, '
[1:04:32] But when the weakling's a preacher, got
[1:04:34] a meal ticket in view. He said, you
[1:04:37] ought to have the cross in view. Christ
[1:04:39] in view to know God's going to make you
[1:04:41] pay for your little sissified ways
[1:04:42] you're doing.
[1:04:44] Ouch.
[1:04:46] God wants men. Yes, that's right. Man's
[1:04:49] measured by character. Certainly. Big
[1:04:51] man's a brute. I've seen men that
[1:04:53] weighed 200 lb didn't have an ounce of
[1:04:54] man in him. But man is measured by
[1:04:56] character. So is women measured by
[1:04:58] character. And if we are sons and
[1:05:00] daughters of God, what type of character
[1:05:02] ought we to be? Come on. Oh, that ought
[1:05:05] to be a challenge to us this morning,
[1:05:06] church. Listen, men, any man that'll let
[1:05:09] his wife smoke cigarettes, wear shorts,
[1:05:11] shows what he's made out of. He's no
[1:05:14] man. He ain't got an ounce in him. A son
[1:05:15] of God, the head of the house. That's
[1:05:17] right. He said, you know, that's the
[1:05:18] truth. It shows what you're made out of.
[1:05:20] more concerned about what other people
[1:05:22] think. What God thinks, right? Man is
[1:05:25] not measured by muscles. That's beast,
[1:05:27] brute. Man is measured by character. And
[1:05:29] if you're a son of God, you're measured
[1:05:30] by your character. And you're supposed
[1:05:32] to be the ruler of the house. And God
[1:05:33] will hold you responsible
[1:05:36] for what she does. Listen, a real man
[1:05:39] has got power with God. Yeah. Are you
[1:05:41] with me now? Jesus was the was so meek
[1:05:44] and lowly. He was just a little man.
[1:05:46] Brother say he didn't look like a
[1:05:47] leader. And he walks onto the shores of
[1:05:50] Gera.
[1:05:52] And here's Legion who is a brute. Yeah.
[1:05:55] Who's broken every chain they put on
[1:05:57] him. Strength beyond measure in worldly
[1:06:01] strength. And here comes a little little
[1:06:04] man that didn't hardly have any strength
[1:06:06] at all. And he comes over weak from
[1:06:09] preaching and doing what God called him
[1:06:11] to do. And he comes by. But he had power
[1:06:13] with God. And when he come by, Legion
[1:06:16] lost that struggle. Legion lost that
[1:06:18] wrestling man. Those that thousand
[1:06:20] demons lost to the word and the voice of
[1:06:23] Jesus. Listen, he still loses today.
[1:06:25] Every demon's got to fall in the name of
[1:06:27] Jesus.
[1:06:29] Amen. That's the kind of power I want. I
[1:06:31] don't want natural power. I want
[1:06:33] spiritual power with God. Being a man, I
[1:06:36] know there's preachers who think being a
[1:06:37] man is just terrorizing your church.
[1:06:39] That's not what being a man's about.
[1:06:41] Being a man is about weeping at the
[1:06:43] altar. Being a man is about the tears
[1:06:45] that you're crying before you have to
[1:06:47] say something harsh. Yeah.
[1:06:54] So many people want this job. I know
[1:06:56] people want to be a pastor. They want to
[1:06:58] be an evangelist. They want some job as
[1:07:00] a preacher. I said, "God, help us." If
[1:07:03] they knew what it took.
[1:07:07] If they knew what it took.
[1:07:11] I have to I sit there and weep over my
[1:07:14] computer while I'm while I'm preparing
[1:07:16] these things. I don't I'm just not just
[1:07:18] emotional about it in the pulpit, but
[1:07:20] I'm actually emotional about it at home
[1:07:22] or or in the office when I'm working
[1:07:24] because I know that I I know what it's
[1:07:26] going to be to have to stand here and
[1:07:28] preach to you. And I know I I realize
[1:07:30] you're the purchase of Jesus Christ. I
[1:07:32] wouldn't want to say anything to offend
[1:07:33] you. Wouldn't want to say anything to
[1:07:35] hurt you. But a real man can weep for
[1:07:38] the people. A real man can intercede for
[1:07:40] the people. A real man cares about
[1:07:42] people.
[1:07:48] But a priest in the Old Testament,
[1:07:49] excuse me, I we just got one service
[1:07:50] today, but I got just a few more minutes
[1:07:52] and we'll close.
[1:07:54] But a real priest in the Old Testament,
[1:07:56] when he went into the Holy of Holies,
[1:07:58] he went carefully.
[1:08:01] He didn't just barge in. It'd be his own
[1:08:04] death if he did.
[1:08:06] He knew the sins of the people were on
[1:08:08] his shoulders.
[1:08:10] So he wore certain clothes,
[1:08:13] walked a certain way.
[1:08:15] He had to have on certain clothes. Was
[1:08:17] made with certain hands. The B had said
[1:08:20] a peculiar type of clothes. He had to be
[1:08:22] dressed in such a way. He had a
[1:08:24] pomegranate and a bell that every time
[1:08:26] he walked it played holy, holy, holy
[1:08:30] unto the Lord. He was approaching the
[1:08:32] mercy seat with the blood. Yeah. And if
[1:08:37] listen, they were living under the law,
[1:08:39] they every single item had to be just
[1:08:42] right.
[1:08:45] If someone mixed the anointing oil
[1:08:46] wrong, they would die.
[1:08:50] If they walked wrong, they would die. If
[1:08:53] they wore just the wrong mixture of
[1:08:55] linen or wool in their clothes, they
[1:08:58] would die. Yes, sir. So, the priest
[1:09:01] stood for the people. The people could
[1:09:03] get by with it because of the sacrifice,
[1:09:05] but the priest couldn't. He had a place
[1:09:07] of responsibility.
[1:09:09] So, he had to walk in such a way that it
[1:09:12] made noise.
[1:09:15] And but it wasn't just noise for the
[1:09:17] sake of noise. It was noise with a
[1:09:19] purpose. Come on. It cried holy, holy,
[1:09:23] holy to the Lord. Listen to me, young
[1:09:25] men. That's the way we ought to come to
[1:09:26] the house of God. I want to challenge
[1:09:27] you young men. You young men that want
[1:09:29] to marry a girl, I you you need to be
[1:09:32] challenged by this this morning. You be
[1:09:33] a leader. If you can't lead yourself to
[1:09:35] the altar, you won't be able to lead a a
[1:09:38] a woman to the altar.
[1:09:40] If you can't lead yourself to the house
[1:09:42] of God, you won't be able to lead
[1:09:45] children and a family to the house of
[1:09:47] God.
[1:09:48] You young men sit up here, you remember
[1:09:50] this. Let it be imprinted in your heart.
[1:09:52] And you want to be a leader in your
[1:09:53] home. Lead yourself now to the baptism
[1:09:56] of the Holy Ghost. Find your place at
[1:09:58] the altar. Find your place in the word
[1:10:00] of God. Find out what God says a young
[1:10:02] man ought to be.
[1:10:05] Lead them to the altar. Yes. I'm so
[1:10:09] grateful for our young men because we
[1:10:10] got young men. I believe they've been
[1:10:12] filled with the Holy Ghost. And I thank
[1:10:13] you for that. The success of our young
[1:10:16] marriages. And I know you've had your
[1:10:17] struggles and things, but I've watched
[1:10:18] some of our young people get older and
[1:10:20] get married. And I'm so grateful that
[1:10:23] they've stayed in the house of God. And
[1:10:25] you young man, you you take this as a
[1:10:27] challenge. I want to be a priest in my
[1:10:29] home. We're going to stay in church.
[1:10:31] We're going to stay in the house of God.
[1:10:32] We're not going to let anything shake us
[1:10:34] where, yeah, you'll have trouble in
[1:10:36] life. There will be struggles. There'll
[1:10:37] be fusses and fights and failures. And
[1:10:39] you'll fail many times, but you got to
[1:10:41] get back up. Somebody's got to stand
[1:10:43] guard at the door. Somebody's got to be
[1:10:46] there to keep the devil out of your
[1:10:47] house.
[1:10:52] lead your family to the altar.
[1:10:58] He had to wear a certain perfume. He had
[1:11:02] to smell a certain way. And the perfume
[1:11:05] oil that he wore was the rose of Sharon.
[1:11:10] Brother Brandham said the rose of Sharon
[1:11:11] had to be crushed before it could admit
[1:11:14] it's perfume.
[1:11:16] So sometimes God will put you through
[1:11:18] some things. Men, fathers, some of y'all
[1:11:20] know what I'm talking about. You've been
[1:11:21] through some things. You've lost some
[1:11:23] jobs. You've been through some things.
[1:11:24] You've had to stand when nobody else
[1:11:26] would stand. You've had to believe the
[1:11:28] message when others forsook it. You've
[1:11:29] had to stand for God in the church. You
[1:11:31] had to stand for God in your home. But
[1:11:33] God, what was happening? It was crushing
[1:11:35] you, but it was producing the rose of
[1:11:37] Sharon was producing an anointing in
[1:11:40] your life. An ointment in your life.
[1:11:42] Listen to me, you young men. I know
[1:11:44] you've been through some things. Some of
[1:11:45] you been through some things. I I know
[1:11:47] Peter's dealt with some things. And I I
[1:11:49] know uh Landon and Trip have dealt with
[1:11:51] some things. And all these young men,
[1:11:52] you'll deal with things in life. But let
[1:11:54] me tell you this. Every time you get
[1:11:56] crushed, you remember that that's God
[1:11:58] bringing the anointing out of your life.
[1:12:00] He's making you to a place where you can
[1:12:02] walk in and cry, "Holy, holy, holy to
[1:12:04] the Lord."
[1:12:06] He won't fail you. Will he fail? Come
[1:12:08] on, you older men. You men that have
[1:12:09] been through you older ladies, have he
[1:12:11] ever failed you? David said, "I've never
[1:12:13] seen the righteous forsaken or his seed
[1:12:16] begging bread." I think we can testify
[1:12:17] this morning, he has never failed us,
[1:12:20] though we've failed him many times.
[1:12:28] But the B said, "The person that's
[1:12:29] approaching into this holiest of holies
[1:12:31] has to be anointed with the same Holy
[1:12:34] Spirit." And as he walks, holy, holy,
[1:12:39] holy. He wasn't just anointed for
[1:12:41] himself.
[1:12:44] Men,
[1:12:45] when we backslide,
[1:12:48] and we will,
[1:12:50] we have a responsibility
[1:12:53] to come back to the altar. That's right.
[1:12:58] Because if we don't, our families will
[1:13:00] suffer.
[1:13:02] Right. Say, "Well, I know I'm elected. I
[1:13:04] know God called me and did something for
[1:13:05] me, but I'm just cold right now."
[1:13:08] But if you don't come back,
[1:13:11] your families will suffer.
[1:13:14] Look what happened when Jacob left
[1:13:15] Bethl.
[1:13:18] Jacob left Bethl, went down to another
[1:13:22] out of the land of Israel. He was called
[1:13:24] to his daughter got raped. His sons
[1:13:27] destroyed a whole city of men. Affected
[1:13:29] their lives for generations. We just
[1:13:31] went through that
[1:13:33] because he left Bethl.
[1:13:36] But there's always Bethl to come back
[1:13:37] to.
[1:13:39] When Jacob got done, as we started with
[1:13:41] Jacob this morning, as Jacob got done,
[1:13:44] what did he do? He didn't he didn't go
[1:13:46] and forsake everything. Said, "Well, God
[1:13:47] didn't didn't keep me." No, he realized
[1:13:49] he had backsid on God, but he said,
[1:13:51] "We're going back to Bethl. We're going
[1:13:53] back to the place where we built an
[1:13:54] altar at the beginning. Put away your
[1:13:56] gods. Put away the idols and let's go
[1:13:58] back
[1:14:00] to the house of God.
[1:14:06] Even Ahab as the musicians come, even
[1:14:09] Ahab went softly
[1:14:12] when he heard the voice of Elijah say,
[1:14:13] "You're going to die and your family's
[1:14:15] going to be destroyed."
[1:14:17] And the Bible said Ahab, that old
[1:14:19] hypocrite,
[1:14:21] believed the word enough that he walked
[1:14:23] softly
[1:14:25] before God.
[1:14:27] He put on sackcloth,
[1:14:29] walked softly. And God comes to Elijah.
[1:14:32] He said, "Do you see how he walks
[1:14:34] softly?"
[1:14:35] Said it won't happen in his generation.
[1:14:39] Oh, God.
[1:14:43] Men,
[1:14:44] preaching to myself too,
[1:14:47] fathers,
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:51] are you willing
[1:14:53] to lead your families to the altar?
[1:14:57] [Music]
[1:14:59] I don't necessarily mean this altar this
[1:15:01] morning. I mean the altar of worship.
[1:15:05] The place where they can find help. Have
[1:15:08] you put your hands on the lamb on the
[1:15:10] head of the lamb and identified with it?
[1:15:13] Does your family have to beg you to come
[1:15:14] to church
[1:15:16] or pray with them at home?
[1:15:22] God help us today.
[1:15:25] We get so busy providing and protecting.
[1:15:30] But we are also priests.
[1:15:34] Today would be a good day to make a
[1:15:35] commitment as you every head bowed,
[1:15:37] every eye closed
[1:15:39] to lead your family to the altar. Would
[1:15:40] you make that commitment this morning? I
[1:15:43] thank God for every father who leads his
[1:15:45] family in worship. Why don't we make a
[1:15:47] real commitment? If you could do that by
[1:15:49] just a sign of your up raise hand, say,
[1:15:51] "Lord, I I want to make a commitment.
[1:15:53] and no one looking around. God bless
[1:15:54] those hands. I want to make a commitment
[1:15:57] today
[1:15:58] to lead my family to the altar.
[1:16:03] I'm going to set an example of real
[1:16:05] fatherhood,
[1:16:07] express the attribute of God in my life,
[1:16:08] and I'm going to surrender to the word.
[1:16:12] I'm going to submit myself to the word.
[1:16:13] My hands are up this morning. I I want
[1:16:16] to do that with all of my heart. I want
[1:16:19] to submit myself to the word.
[1:16:23] Oh, help me Lord.
[1:16:26] Help me Lord not to be afraid to go in
[1:16:29] behind the Holy of Holies.
[1:16:33] If it causes tears, if it causes the my
[1:16:36] lips to begin to pour out praise,
[1:16:39] oh God, let me not be afraid to lead my
[1:16:42] family. I won't allow Hollywood to
[1:16:45] affect how how I believe a man ought to
[1:16:47] be, but I'm going to stand for God in a
[1:16:50] biblical way and set an example of real
[1:16:53] fatherhood and a real husband, a real
[1:16:56] man to my family. I know some of you are
[1:16:58] not fathers. Maybe your children have
[1:16:59] passed away or your wife has passed
[1:17:02] away. Some of you are not not
[1:17:06] husbands anymore, but you're leading
[1:17:09] somebody. your experience, your your
[1:17:12] leadership means something to someone.
[1:17:14] Won't you just ask him to make you a
[1:17:16] real example, a real example of
[1:17:19] fatherhood? You ladies, a real example
[1:17:20] of motherhood and what a woman ought to
[1:17:23] be, that image of God that he made you
[1:17:26] in. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, as we
[1:17:29] come to the end of the service this
[1:17:30] morning, I pray God that you'd move in a
[1:17:33] mighty way. I pray Lord that you'd just
[1:17:36] you just change our hearts. Oh God,
[1:17:39] change my heart. Lord, let me lead my
[1:17:42] family to the altar.
[1:17:45] Lead, Lord, in whatever capacity I have
[1:17:47] to influence the people, let me lead
[1:17:49] them in worship. Oh God, I pray that it
[1:17:52] would be so. Lord, we we we can't make
[1:17:55] the individual receive the baptism of
[1:17:58] the Holy Ghost, but we can lead them to
[1:17:59] the place where they can receive it. I
[1:18:02] pray you'd help us to do it today. Oh
[1:18:05] God, I pray your Holy Spirit would go
[1:18:08] down and arrest every every man,
[1:18:11] every father. Lord, as many times we
[1:18:15] challenge our fathers, but it's not
[1:18:16] because we don't love them. It's because
[1:18:18] we know that that's where the the home
[1:18:20] begins. I pray God you'd help us to to
[1:18:23] stand firm in our place today. Oh God,
[1:18:28] we love you today. We thank you. I thank
[1:18:30] you for these real men of God who stood
[1:18:32] over the years, Lord. Stood for you.
[1:18:34] That's the reason there's a church here
[1:18:36] this morning. A place, an altar. We can
[1:18:38] come and worship God. Let us build,
[1:18:41] Lord. That That's what we're called to
[1:18:43] do. Let us build this altar. Make it a
[1:18:47] place, oh God, where your presence is,
[1:18:49] where the fire can fall. Oh God, may
[1:18:53] this message be the fire of our hearts,
[1:18:56] the zeal of our hearts, the zeal of the
[1:18:58] hour. We pray in Jesus name.
