handclap of praise this evening aren't you thankful for the sins that are buried in the sea of god's forgetfulness tonight amen it's good to see every one of you out here tonight good to be back in in the states and with the people that i can preach to that understand english now if i can just preach english we'll be all right and uh it's good it's good to be back with you all and and uh i tell you what it was fun to preach over there it was it was easy to preach over there because the people were expecting but i believe you came expecting tonight and i believe that the lord has something for you nothing i can give but if i can get myself out of the way then i believe god can use use somebody that's nothing right to bring something so phenomenal to you that it can change your complete outlook on life if we'll only believe what a service this morning we had by our pastor i'll tell you what i i told him in the office i said i like to preach after you've had a bad day it's hard to preach after he hit a home run so come up and do some cleanup duty tonight but i tell you what it's good to be in the house the lord if we could turn to jude chapter 1 verse 3. do you love the lord tonight amen jude chapter 1 verse 3 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints and one more scripture before you're seated joel chapter 2 25-26 very familiar scripture here joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed we're not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ we're not ashamed to be associated with that book of acts church tonight can you say amen amen may the lord add his blessings to the words you may be seated i just had this thought come on my mind that we cannot allow the common conception of church entity to stop us from having a book of acts experience we cannot ex we can't take on the spirit of the age where you'll see the two spirits come up so close and you'll see the church that'll have a form of godliness but they deny the power of the first church brother branham says it like this he says i will restore saith the lord i will restore all the days of the caterpillar all the blessings of the lutheran had the baptist had the methodist had i will restore saith the lord a tree that won't stand stiff but when the holy ghost falls they're flexible we might be green but we're flexible that's one thing about us we may not be doctors of divinity have all the theology but we're green enough to bend to the power of god and rejoice and have a real good old-fashioned holy ghost meeting that's what we need brother more than anything else more than a head knowledge more than somebody to get up here and give you an intellectual talk is the power of the holy ghost preached in the pulpits again he goes on to say that's the way an old-fashioned revival is when you reach down and get a better hold step off of that old cold formal creed over here and get over here on the vine of the lord and go to eating the fruits and grapes off the vine of the lord he said i will restore remember a restoration a restoration is to bring back something to its original condition something that was that was once good and had had lost itself down through the dark ages you'll see that the book of acts church is what we strive for but throughout the ages you'll have the lutherans and you have the baptist and and the catholics and so forth and they took something away that that would fit with their creed or their organization but what we have now is a message of restoration we have a message that came to restore all the things that were eat off the tree back to the tree this bride tree that we have now and we go on brother brown says restore what all the beauty that she was at one time i will restore the same church that i had at pentecost i will restore the gifts of the spirit i will restore signs and wonders i will restore speaking in tongues i will restore the prophet i will restore all saith the lord all is restored in this day we have need of nothing in this day because what we have is the fullness of the restored word of god for the hour can you say amen this is not a day where we have need of revelation the revelation is there what we have is we have to it has to be revealed to us by the holy spirit but there's not going to come another prophet with another revelation to tell us what we need to do the revelation is there if we'll just grab hold of it and i think today we get we're always looking for something in the future brother branham says we're looking for something far off and we fail to see what god is doing right now but church i'm here to tell you there is a revival going on in the bride right now we're not looking for a bride's revival it's here the bride's revival is happening now and we we get so caught up with the things of the world and the distractions but remember this church will be restored this true church this bride will be restored back to the book of acts back to the gifts they had then and you think about it it takes a faith to be restored to that condition because what what the church had and the original when they went up to the upper room they didn't go up there for a few minutes and say well the lord didn't bless me so i'm going to leave no they stayed until the power came and in this day we don't we don't go to church and if the first 15 minutes don't give us goosebumps we just say well this is a bad service but stay there hold on accept something that god has to give for you today i think we get a little bit too caught up in the the worldly attitude and and we get into the tv and sports and things and and it kind of blinds us our pastor taught us this morning about being blinded and the the father would put would put a blindfold over the sun and then that father would put a blindfold over the next one so that they would he said next thing you know they're born blind what is it because you're accepting the blindness that you're in you accept the world and its condition but we need to move past that this world and its condition is going to perish but there will be a bride that will come out of this world and not be partakers of the plagues that are coming on this world we need to have something new something refreshed in our lives something restored the message that came was not a message to keep us in our condition it was not a message that told us stay in your baptist church and you're just okay no he did tell people to go to church but he said if you'll you go in there and if you make a stand for something they'll get rid of you they'll kick you out of that denominational system but i wonder today if we haven't done the same thing in the message ranks we're sitting in a church and we say this is good enough what we have is enough and they're dead they're cold they're formal and they have some kind of a creed or they'll preach your doctrine about the return of a prophet we're looking for the coming of the lord not looking for the return of a prophet i'd love to see a prophet return but church we're looking for the return of jesus christ to take a bride out of here the prophet came to get you ready for that psalms 51 10 created me a clean heart oh god renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence take not thy holy spirit from me restore unto me the joy of thy salvation restore the joy he didn't lose his salvation but he lost the joy of his salvation we were not a brother brandon will say this in a message and i was just listening to the restoration of the bride tree and he talks about how we would lose uh we would the bride was lost in catholicism he said because they cut off the gifts of the spirit and water baptism in jesus name he said that was the bride coming down and they cut it off there they lost it right there why because you took off some of the word but if that same people that are called by the name of god called by the name of jesus christ can take a hold of the promises of god he never took away the blessings we lost the blessings when we left the word the blessings were always there if you would stay with the word restore unto me the joy of thy salvation he said uh brother branham goes on he's and i and i don't i've got too many quotes i won't be able to get to all of them he said we find them insects are the same insects only in a different stage what the lutheran had the methodist eight what the methodist left the baptist state what the beb what the baptist left the pentecostals eight the whole thing is cut down he said he said but god said i will restore saith the lord all the years all the years that were taken away will be restored in this last day he said i'll send back another church i believe he sent another church today we are the church we are the bride of christ there's not coming another bride you're it this is the end time if you could ever see if you could see what the prophet came and and prophesied to us the things that would happen and i i mentioned this to a brother this afternoon when brother branham had the vision he was sitting there in jcpenney's about how bad it would get how vulgar the women would get i'm telling you church this is the last age and in this age there would come a bride out of this worldly age somebody who could withstand the very test of time somebody who wouldn't walk away just because it got a little tough somebody who would who would stand when there was those who'd go against the message somebody who said i believe the message of the hour i have the faith of abraham i don't care if it's 25 more years to a rapture i'll be here waiting for it i'll send back another church in the last days he said i will restore that original power again in the evening time it shall be light he said down in the heart of that tree no matter how many branches is pruned there will come forth the royal seed of abraham god promised it god will do it he said he would do it he said i will restore all the years that the denominations took from you all that the denominations ate i will restore back to that church i love it i believe if we could recognize that we are that church the true church we wouldn't let no denominational creed creep in among us we wouldn't let no message creed come in among us and try to steal the joy that we have restore unto me the joy of my salvation i believe that if a church can get really really into the message of the hour you say we need the word the word i believe if you can get that word of the original church that brother branham said he preached the same thing paul taught the same thing peter taught is the same thing that was taught now but that will not produce a dead church it will produce another book of acts church these the signs and wonders will follow if you'll get back in line with the word of god we're not looking for something it's here he said he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water a man that meditates in the word of god day and night not a creed or a denomination but meditates in the word day and night he'll be like a tree planted by the water branches shall not wither he'll bring forth his fruit in the season and he said no matter how far you stooped in sin you're still sons and daughters of god because you're fallen degenerated in your soul and mind but god is your creator and in your fallen estate you're a lost undone creation of god dominated by the devil you were never not his but your spirit was dominated by him he said that's right you're still sons and daughters of god he is not willing that any of you should perish but all might come unto repentance see and he's done everything that lays possible for only god himself could do this to give the opportunities to the creature of his to accept and be what he wants you to be back in your right estate again he said now here it is and it's pretty sharp but no person is in their right mental status until they have accepted the lord jesus no person is in your right mental status you say the world's insane of course they're insane because they've never accepted what we have today there's a reason there's a difference there's a reason why we don't live like the world there's a reason why we're not groping in insanity like the world is today it's because we have accepted the very spirit of christ in our day when they went into the upper room they accepted something that would change them from the inside out and we have waited and we have waited and now on this day they have the same spirit has been restored to the church and we have now the same power of the book of acts brother branham goes on he says it's not just a power but it's an authority given see you can look at me and say brother joel you don't look very strong but there's an authority given to me by the word of god i may not be able to fight off a devil by myself but there's something on the inside of me that can withstand every devil because why it's an authority given to the body of christ it's an authority given to you in this day because he knew how bad it would be he knew how dark it would get but he knew that you would be a light in this day he knew that you would be somebody that could withstand the darkest hour he didn't call you in luther's age he didn't call you in wesley's age but he called you in the darkest age of all of them because he knew you were made of that stuff that could withstand all the devils he knew you were made of something that wouldn't bluff from the devil he knew you were made out of something pretty tough because why the spirit of christ himself had to come and be in you in this day you had to accept the fullness of the godhead in his day in order to withstand all the tactics the devil would send i believe the devil has got all kinds of tactics i believe he changes them when we start understanding the tactics think about it like this when the devil knows he can't get you to keep stay out of church he'll get you to quit praying he'll get you to quit reading your bible he'll get you to do something and he'll have a really sneaky way to do it he'll have a way to do it that'll just it'll seem like nothing changed in your life but if you'll ever look back to where you were when you were really on fire for god and then you see in the cold condition that we sometimes get into church if we could ever get back to where we were get back to our first love back to what we had at the beginning remember when you were on fire for god and there was something inside of you that would just stand up and worship in church something that was just so glad that god could save a sinner like me and then you become a good church member and then you're acting like you're too good to stand up and worship god i'm telling you this will restore you back to the condition of worship this will restore you back to where you have been excited about god this will take you from being being so so just you just seem like christians the word i'm looking for i believe it's like this i believe we have become so so slothful in our worship but you know what it is it's not just the worship it's not just that we can come and raise our hand but there's something on the inside that we lack and what happens is we lose it because of the condition we're living in what you are at home will show up the stuff you watch the stuff you read i'll tell you if you're in the bible if you're listening to the message of the hour that'll show too and satan will fight you harder when you do that he'll make less time for you to read he'll make less time for you to hear the tapes he'll make plenty of time for you to watch the latest movie that's out but if you'll just stand up for the truth one time and watch that devil flee away from you watch that devil run from you watch him when you stand up when you get out of bed and you put your feet on the floor and all hell shakes because they know that you got up out of bed and you're there to torment the devil i'll tell you i think we need some more tormentors here today that'll tell the devil you cannot take my joy you are not going to keep me out of the house of god you are not going to keep me out of the word of god you can't stop me there's nothing going to make me give up because i was not born to lose but i was born to win i wonder if somebody in the church could stand up today and say i was born to win can't nobody keep the joy away from me can't nobody stop me from worshiping god nobody nothing there's not enough devils in hell not enough devils in hell to make me stop i'll tell you what he can take me to the grave he could ruin me in any way he wants to but i'm not giving up my battle and fighting him i'll get up every day and as long as i've got breath i'll say boo devil you have no right in my body healing is mine i'll tell you something ever since i've been go back from egypt satan has fought me in my health has been i can still can't hardly eat but i'm going to tell you right now it won't stop me from telling the people of the world about god won't tell it won't stop me you know i'd rather i'll tell you what i would rather be in this fight than sitting back at my lazy boy watching football because the devil's got you sitting there if you get up and you just do what he wants you to do every day he's got you but if there's something fighting you remember you if you're a young christian think about this if satan's fighting you on what to dress how to act who to hang out with remember that's not that's not the right spirit trying to get you to do bad things that's satan trying to get in there and trying to steal your joy because you've come under something that is an anointing for this generation you are anointed to win but satan sees that knows that you've taken your side with jesus and he wants to fight you with everything he's got and he's got a lot but we've got more there's more with us than be with them greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world no weapon formed against me shall prosper no weapon nothing shall prosper against you why because you were born to win there was a seed on the inside of you that couldn't be squashed out by the drought you were born to win when you needed the anointing and the holy spirit on your life god would send it god would send a watering rain when you had need of it there is nothing can stop you this bride of jesus will march on and prevail no matter what brother branham talks about enforcing he said what is it enforcing give it back what he said that's what it's talking about restore it bring it back to its right owner i tell you what we let satan act like the owner way too often we let him act like he owns your body your soul and your spirit but he owns nothing he owns nothing of ours god gave it to us it's his property we borrowed this flesh to walk in but it's the very spirit of god satan owns nothing remember when jesus went into hell he took those keys and he opened the lock and you are no longer shackled i believe i heard it in the meetings we're not polishing the shackles we come to loose the shackles we're not here to bring the spirit of fear upon the people but to tell you there's a release in the seventh year in the seventh age there is something in this age that'll restore everything back that you lost you say i lost family look at job he lost everything but it was all restored to him if you're one of his you can't lose if you're one of his everything you have need of is yours i believe there's spiritual food in this season we have to eat i believe there's this heat i believe there's a spirit here to make it live i believe there's a people here for it to live through do you believe it tonight you're one of his i'm not here to beat you over the head i'm here to encourage you tonight don't be distracted by the devil don't be distracted by movies and tv and all these things that would take away your time from god but if you could ever get back in love with god if you can fall in love with him all over again then nothing can take away that divine revelation that he's put in your heart this is not a head knowledge this is not something i learned i tell you what you say was you were you were raised on a message pew i was raised around the message and and the church of god and the different ones but i can tell you this i was an unbeliever or a make-believer until there was a time when i come in contact with the very spirit of god for myself and now there's nothing could take it away from me at one time i would listen to the upc on what they had to say i would go to their churches i was looking for something but there's something in me now that says there's nothing greater than the word that god has given me and the spirit that he gave me to stand for it there's nothing going to make me deny it now you say brother joel if they were going to cut your head off would you stand for this message i believe i'm too in love with the message to turn it down now i believe that i can stand in the face of it now and say do with me what you will but i serve a god who is more than able to deliver me from that i believe by revelation but see it wasn't a dead letter i heard the tapes i heard the preachers but when the spirit revealed it to me it wasn't a dead letter no more it was the spirit making the word come alive in me somebody here's experienced that before somebody has more than just a theology here today somebody has experienced god for themselves abraham says and if satan has robbed you of the privilege of being a son or daughter of god we have a right this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of god bring them back if you feel under condemnation this afternoon you don't have to leave that way if you feel like satan is robbing you of joy and peace and all the things that those worms ate off the tree in the in those days and joel said that they would but the prophet said that they would eat off the caterpillar and the locust and the palmer worm and so forth would eat these things off the tree but remember this is the day of restoration if you were in the days and the dark ages in the in those other church ages there may not have been a restoration for you maybe you would have had to live without something but in this day all things are made new everything has been restored back to the church he said if he's afflicted you made you sick we have a right before god to enforce the laws of god by his stripes we are healed he said bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him and bring him back i wonder if we can stand like a prophet of god and say we're not under you we have been brought back he said release him and bring him back in this day we allow we allow ourselves to be tied we are allow ourselves to be in bondage when there's no need for that remember johnny crow brother branham would talk about he was tied up out there and he was on a rope and he went and somebody felt sorry for him come and cut him loose and he still stayed in the same little circle because he didn't recognize his freedom it's time you recognize your freedom you can fly if you want to you can go free if you want to this is the day that you can have your freedom this is not a day of condemnation and bondage you say well it sounds pretty condemning when brother brandon preaches those things it's only condemning if you're doing them i mean come on now if you get up here and you preach something steps on your toes don't get mad at the preacher examine what you're doing maybe i'm wrong but at least you'll examine yourself stir up your mind and make sure that what you're doing is lining up with the word of god make sure it's pleasing to god that's the enforcement he says restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick a baby is sick a woman is sick he said they're out of their natural condition he said we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because god gave it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the law giver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that it's done that way he's here today the agent of god is here to see that you have been restored amen we just let we say here i tell you what we get ourselves in such a condemnation we get ourselves under condemnation because we're not living right but there is therefore now no condemnation to him who walks what after what after the spirit but if you're walking according to the flesh there will be condemnation in your heart but if you can ever get the condemnation away from you then you can have freedom to worship when you come into the service and there's no condemnation then you can expect something from god you can say there's no there's therefore no condemnation to him that passed from death into life but i'll tell you tonight there is therefore no condemnation to you that believe there's no condemnation if you'll sit here today and say lord take those things away from me you were wounded for my transgressions i don't have to pay for that you paid for that transgression that i did if you it don't matter how low in sin you were let me tell you this i don't care what you've done if you can accept jesus christ in this day and the word that he's given to you then you don't have to live under condemnation i don't care what you look like i don't care what you feel like there is therefore now no condemnation to you if you'll walk not after the flesh i don't think we live like we should but many times when satan will distract us and he'll get us out of fellowship with god out of communion with god remember there's a way back there's a way back sometimes it requires humility sometimes it requires us to give up something that we are doing sometimes it requires us to make something right with somebody even though it may embarrass us but if there's something there that's hindering your worship make it right it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it because you sitting there with the wrong spirit can hinder the person next to you in the church but if you can make that thing right if you can go to god and repent of your sin and then if he says go make it right with your brother maybe there's something you have against somebody go make it right and watch god moving that next service for you come expecting why because there's no condemnation and what is it it's a restoration it's making things new making things right restoring back if you take an old car that needs to be restored it may look like a piece of junk it may be sitting out there just resting away but brother it can be restored to its original condition and you may have backslid into a place where you just seem like you can't find god no more but there is a restoring agent here today he can restore you back to your right condition back to a right mind again brother brandon said the natural eve fell in the eden by listening to satan's reasoning against god's word that's how she fell spiritual eve now that's the church christ's bride she fell not in eden but in rome she at the night see a council when she rejected that pentecostal church that sin i've got some feedback brother peter that pentecostal church that went down to nicea and listening to roman's reasoning instead of holding onto the word she fell and everything away from her died with her around her now just as natural eve fell spiritual eve fell god's bride fell in the garden christ's bride fell in rome see notice by the same reasoning against god's word she also forfeited her rights of virtue to satan which we found in the breaking of these seals that was satan and still a satan there the bible said it's the very seed of satan and as eve forfeited her virtuous rites and give them over to satan in the garden of eden the church the bride of christ did the same thing at rome when they forfeited the bible of their for their dogmas and their reasonings now she fell not in eden but in rome remember and he said and he goes on down here is anything standing in our way of serving god he said when we separated eve from adam eve fell by disbelieving the word that's right that's where the church failed today disbelieving the word but in this case to the royal seed called predestinated to eternal life the royal seat of abraham they believe that word i don't care what comes or goes how much they laugh who says this that or the other they are ordained to eternal life and she goes right straight back to her lover christ is the one he said the life the spirit that's in christ is in the church he said that's their eternal covenant here see god took the spirit of christ tore it apart and the sacrifice at calvary and took that spirit lifted up the body and set it on the right hand of the throne of god and majesty on high that's everything in heaven is controlled by him and then the spirit that was on on him come back the same spirit not another spirit the same spirit come upon him to confirm the covenant to the royal seed and in the last days we are supposed to see it according to the scripture and before the bride of christ can ever be taken up there has to be a ministry that just dovetails exactly he said i'm so glad to say tonight that i know that's the truth dovetailing confirming confirming the covenant amen the ministry came that ministry came and dovetailed perfectly with that first church what did he do he proved that the signs and wonders were still here he proved that healing was back in the church he proved christ was alive there's no reason for us to doubt in this day we have we can see it brother brother ben talked about this the five senses this morning and the sixth sense and if we think about it we can see it on the film deep calls to the deep you can see god in action you can hear it on the tapes we can use those senses to know in this age you don't even have to go strictly by your sixth sense to know that there's a living god even your human natural senses can tell you that there's a living god today if you don't try to reason it away but he said now the ministry came was exactly like the bible days well i'll skip down here look god in his body christ and christ in his body the bride oh my god made manifest in christ christ made manifest in the bride and as god took from the body of adam the woman she fell then god is took from the body of christ his flesh his body which is his word and is bringing a bride out that won't fall by denomination or creed no sir but she is coming back with the pure unadulterated word of god being manifested i'd like for you to catch that right there being manifested we're not putting it back on the prophet anymore it's manifested here and now this is not a time when we're looking for the manifestation in something in the future we're looking for something to be manifested in a tent but it's being manifested right here and now what the problem is the reason we miss it it goes over our heads is because we're not looking for it but if you're looking for the manifestation now you will see the manifestation in this body called the bride nothing can stop it satan may attack us but we are being restored back back to what to the faith of the pentecostal fathers back to the faith that they had this is not something afar off but it's here can we recognize it in our day have you recognized your day and its message have you recognized that we are not just another denomination we are not just another church or creed but we are the very body of christ today we are the ones called out we are the generation we are the chosen generation you may look like a normal human being but there's never been a greater body in all the ages than now because they didn't stay for a rapture but you were called out for a rapture i believe there's a generation on earth now that will not see death i believe there's a generation on earth that will be caught away by the quickening power that christ put in his church i'm about done here so i'll try not to hold you much longer but we are ordained to be restored we are ordained not to fall we are ordained to be restored in this day brother branham says if that tree ever puts forth another branch it will bear its original fruit there's got to be a restoration of these things right at the end of the vine there has to come forth a restoration an evening light to light it up and make it right but it will come out of the vine not a denomination that's grafted into it but an original production of the word i believe that i believe what we had this day was an original production of the word right this was not another healing evangelist this was a man that had more than just a healing ministry he could show you that christ was alive but what he had was the vindication that god was alive so we don't serve a dead god today we are following a vindicated prophet and we are doing what he said do that's why we don't sit down and just hear the tapes we actually have live ministry in the pulpit because he said to do it we're not hearers only in this day but we've been restored to doers also we have been restored from those that could sit in denominational thinking and been restored back to a complete look at the at the whole entire word when he came and opened the seals that wasn't just just so he could do it but it was to show you who you could be it was to show you what we needed to be restored to to restore us back it's to come forth for the evening time there will be a light in the evening time it takes the light to ripen it see how perfectly the scripture is a day that won't be called day or night fruit cannot ripen unless the sun ripens it no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be vindicated only by him who said i am the light of the world the word so there has to come forth a power the holy spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested that what he's predicted would happen in this day the evening light produces that he says what a time i would say today what a time to be alive what a time to be a christian what a time to know what we know what a time to be called out of denominations what a time to understand that we don't have to die in our sins but we have been given authority by the word of god to be taken from that denomination and to be renewed and to have eternal life we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the earth to know that we don't have to live like the world but we are more than conquerors through christ he made us free he set us free he has taken me from what i was to what i can be when i looked there in egypt and i saw those people i saw so many of them and i saw him bound there was a man come forward and he said he'd been living a fake christian life for i think 12 or 13 years and to see that man come forward stand up right after the preaching was over stood up and says i'm done being a fake christian it's time for me to be a real christian i'll tell you what confession's good for the soul maybe you need to tell god say lord i'm tired of living the halfway life but i'm ready to surrender all to you i'm tired of being a halfway christian but i'm ready to come forward if it takes an altar if it takes me snotting and spitting and crying and whatever it takes i'm willing to surrender my pride so that i can be made new i can be restored back there is a restoration for you but you must accept the restoration message it is for us they waited in the upper room until not just until they felt like they'd that maybe they felt like well it's time to go eat dinner we're done we've been here 15 minutes and there's there's no rushing mighty wind but they weren't given up and you know what the great thing about it is god knew they weren't giving up and he knew it and so he had already prepared a great moving and shaking to go on in that room and the prophet tells us that we must have the same experience now you can say and you can try to say that was a theological thing all you want to you can say it was a little breeze that come through you can say that i i've been in tent meetings where there's been big breezes coming through if that was it i don't want it big hot air come through the tent and and it makes all the stink come from one side or the other but let me just tell you this i don't want just a little breeze i want a rushing mighty wind on my life i want more than what the denominations can offer they can tell you well you can speak in tongues and that's good they can tell you you can come over here and just shake hands and that's good but i want something that will make me live the christian life i want something that will excite me on the inside to when i come to church i expect to hear from god i don't care who's preaching i don't care who's standing there i don't care who's here who's not here but i do expect to hear from god you can look around remember there will be distractions there will always come distractions that's satan's job and he'll come at your weakest point maybe you don't do maybe you're not a sinner but maybe on sunday afternoon you have to rush home to watch the ball game remember that may be the weakness that you have that you have to go against maybe that's the area that you have to protect because satan is there trying to tell you hey hey this is this is okay and maybe maybe it's fine but remember that may be where he's keeping you out of prayer or maybe you're not getting much out of the end of that service because you got to rush off maybe he wants you to stay just a little bit longer maybe there's something on the inside that's talking to you but you've quieted that voice because of how loud the world has gotten but i wonder today if we could quiet ourselves enough to hear from the voice of god again and he will tell you all that i was all that i ever will be i give to you all the spirit i ever had is in you i he separated himself at calvary he said and divided himself so that you could be part of him this is this message is not just to make you feel good this is not a message just to come and and pump you up but it's something that'll change your life it's something that'll make you live different you'll act different you're a different creature it changes your whole nature i once was in the pig pen but i don't go there no more i don't eat with the pigs no more because i went back to my father's house and at my father's house he had a fatted calf for me to eat he had the message of the hour there he gave me some new clothes i don't have to look like a dirty old uh big pen person anymore but i've been brought back i have been changed into my garments that god gave me i have the truth now so i don't have to live like the world amen there'll be scars to overcome there'll be things in your life that maybe overnight won't change but if you hear the word of god hasten to obey run and repent when you need to quickly apologize when it's necessary to apologize and it's probably a lot more than what we do quickly go to the altar if god's calling you don't wait if there's something on the inside talking to you yield to the voice today what is it it's a voice of restoration he wants to restore you he wants to take you back remember in the garden of eden where they could musicians go ahead and come i've got to quit in the in the garden of eden there was a communion going on and they could sit there and they could talk to god and he could talk back to him but remember when eve got out of fellowship and started talking to the world she started listening to too much tv too many worldly voices got in her head and it caused her to fall there is a message here today that is trying to commune with you in the stillness in the peace of the garden but you're going after something flashy you're going after something that looks good that'll tell you you won't surely die but i'm here to tell you if you can turn back to god i believe you are ordained to not fall like the first eve i believe there's something that will stop you before you ever get that far there is something that will keep you in the days we're living in can somebody say amen today there's something here that can keep you there is a holy ghost here today they didn't have the holy ghost then they had to rely on a sacrifice but today if you can accept the holy ghost in your life it will keep you and seal you until the day of your redemption there's nothing that can make you fall this is a restoration message if you believe it can you stand to your feet this afternoon with every head bowed i believe it's a promise that there's a restoration message but we don't have to look for it in this hour the restoration message is here can you believe it today if there's something hindering the voice of god that's trying to speak to you i challenge you today to go back to where you lost your first love and find out what you need to do in your own life to get you back in fellowship with god say lord i need a renewing of your spirit i need a refilling of the holy ghost i need more of you today that's the way it's got to be that's not the way that i just want it to be but lord i've got to have a renewing of your spirit today i need something that the world can't give i need something that's been taken away but lord today i want more of you i want your presence to be near me i don't want to grieve you lord but may that dove-like spirit be on my life when somebody wrongs me lord help me to reply in a sweet spirit with a spirit of love and humility oh god if there's a sickness in the building today if there's something in the mind of somebody that is battling them and about to take them farther than they want to go lord i believe you're here to take that away from them and restore them back to their right condition today lord help them to recognize the message we have the power that is in this message we have today help us to come under the word for the day and help us to receive the restoration message that has been sent i ask for every one of these people that have come out on this sunday afternoon lord whatever the need is here today may they accept it right now may they not leave until that need is met it don't matter how far you've come today can be your day to come back in jesus name if there's one that needs prayer today i'm

hours but god has promised us today his overcoming power and greater is he that is in me greater is he that is in me greater is he that isn't me amen you're free to go in the name of the lord oh on

know
