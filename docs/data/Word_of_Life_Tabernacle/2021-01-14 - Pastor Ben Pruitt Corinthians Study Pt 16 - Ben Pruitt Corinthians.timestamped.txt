[38:11] chapter 5 and verse 5
[38:14] blessed are the meek for they shall
[38:16] inherit the earth
[38:18] sounds like a pretty good inheritance
[38:20] doesn't it
[38:21] the whole earth that sounds like a
[38:23] pretty good one let's bow our heads for
[38:25] a word of prayer
[38:26] heavenly father i'm so grateful to be in
[38:28] your house again tonight
[38:31] there's just something in my heart lord
[38:33] that
[38:34] that longs to be in the house of god
[38:38] i was sitting there lord at the funeral
[38:39] in hot springs yesterday and
[38:42] thinking and our brother that passed
[38:44] away and how he had a desire to go to
[38:46] church and how his
[38:47] kids talked about that and lord that it
[38:50] would be so
[38:51] for every one of us i i trust that it is
[38:54] lord especially for those here on a
[38:55] wednesday night
[38:56] just something in our hearts we want to
[38:58] be in the house of the lord
[39:00] and we want to hear your word we hunger
[39:02] lord for it we hunger for fellowship
[39:04] with one another
[39:05] but more than that lord we hunger for
[39:07] fellowship with you
[39:09] lord so we asked you to come down today
[39:12] like you did
[39:13] with adam and eve in the cool of the
[39:15] evening lord and
[39:17] and spoke to them father and just had
[39:19] communion with them
[39:20] what a what a church service that must
[39:22] have been when you were there with them
[39:24] would you just do that with us here
[39:25] tonight we take just a simple subject
[39:28] and teach from your word but oh god
[39:30] would you just come and if there's
[39:32] something that needs to be said would
[39:33] you say it tonight lord
[39:35] and move me out of the way and speak
[39:37] through lips of clay we pray
[39:39] help us to hear help us to understand
[39:41] lord and help us to always
[39:43] lord remember that your word is the most
[39:46] important thing in our lives
[39:47] we thank you for it in jesus name amen
[39:51] amen god bless you you could be seated
[39:53] this evening
[39:56] blessed are the meek for they shall
[39:58] inherit the earth the definition of meek
[40:00] is
[40:01] they that hold all their passions and
[40:03] affections
[40:05] evenly balanced it doesn't just mean
[40:07] somebody that's quiet
[40:09] but it's someone who's in control
[40:12] someone who has it under control now
[40:16] paul uses the idea of self-control or
[40:19] keeping under the body is how he puts it
[40:20] in first corinthians chapter nine
[40:23] and that comes through meekness and
[40:25] temperance
[40:26] meekness is attitude temperance is
[40:29] action
[40:30] you find the two together in galatians 5
[40:32] 23 that meekness
[40:33] and temperance are two of the fruits of
[40:35] the spirit
[40:37] meekness is as i said attitude
[40:39] temperance is
[40:40] action and and they go together now
[40:43] temperance is also a virtue in second
[40:45] peter one and six and brother branham
[40:47] says this about that
[40:49] he says to my knowledge he said i had
[40:51] temperance
[40:52] that's a good place to add it it's to
[40:54] our knowledge because we
[40:56] we generally tend to be into more
[40:58] intemperate the more knowledgeable we
[41:00] become
[41:02] and he said to my knowledge i add
[41:04] temperance self-control
[41:06] he said i like that and and brother
[41:08] branham quotes
[41:09] a a song a patriotic
[41:12] song he says my country tits of thee
[41:15] crown my soul with self-control
[41:18] from sea to shining c and brother brown
[41:20] doesn't quote the entire
[41:22] entire verse but that comes from the
[41:23] second verse the original second verse
[41:25] of america the beautiful
[41:27] and it read like this it said oh
[41:29] beautiful for pilgrim feet who's stern
[41:31] in passion
[41:32] stress a thoroughfare of freedom beat
[41:34] across the wilderness
[41:36] america america god mend thine every
[41:38] flaw
[41:39] confirm thy soul in self-control
[41:43] by liberty and law yeah that's something
[41:46] america doesn't do today
[41:49] we look around us and we can see
[41:50] america's lost its self-control
[41:53] just collectively as a bunch they've
[41:55] just lost
[41:56] the whole idea of self-control that that
[41:59] they've reached a place where
[42:01] if i don't like your politics i'll kill
[42:03] you if i don't like the way
[42:05] the way you comb your hair i might kill
[42:07] you and
[42:08] that's the place that the world's
[42:10] reached today it's a lack of
[42:12] temperance it's a lack of meekness
[42:15] lack of self-control there's no
[42:17] self-control in
[42:18] the world's ministry today if you look
[42:20] at the worldly church there's no
[42:22] self-control in the ministry it's gain
[42:24] as much as i can by
[42:25] all the means that i can and then keep
[42:28] all i can
[42:29] remember john wesley said gain all you
[42:31] can keep all you can save all you can
[42:33] and give all you can and john wesley
[42:36] made a practice of
[42:37] at the end of the year that he would
[42:39] take all the he'd make sure he had
[42:40] nothing left
[42:42] at the end of the year and i don't say
[42:43] that we should emulate that but he
[42:44] always did that because
[42:46] he wanted to make sure that he was being
[42:48] temperate with his finances and
[42:51] we need we need to gain our self-control
[42:53] back
[42:54] and it's hard because we can get
[42:56] anything we at a moment's notice
[43:00] right you can go to amazon if you don't
[43:01] want it fast enough i i was able to text
[43:04] fedex today brother joe and that package
[43:06] i had sent to your house and
[43:07] have it sent to dollar general to be
[43:09] waiting on me so it would be quicker
[43:12] so i could get up here to the church and
[43:13] get a camera put in you know that's
[43:16] that that's having stuff at your
[43:17] fingertips
[43:19] we get upset if it's delayed we're used
[43:22] to
[43:22] instant gratification it's the culture
[43:24] and that's not what i'm completely
[43:26] preaching on tonight but paul
[43:28] deals with that in the ministry in 1st
[43:30] corinthians chapter 9
[43:32] but he's not dealing with ministers he's
[43:34] not preaching at ministers he's using it
[43:35] as an example
[43:37] to the people at corinth who were
[43:38] intemperate in the way they treated one
[43:40] another
[43:42] and he's using his own temperance and
[43:44] his own meekness
[43:45] and saying that this is how i've
[43:47] controlled
[43:48] the ministry that i'm in and this is how
[43:50] the self-control that i've used in
[43:52] how i've preached to you and how i
[43:54] presented myself to you how i've lived
[43:56] around you
[43:57] and you use that as an example to them
[44:00] because he's saying here you guys can't
[44:02] even agree on what meat to eat and
[44:05] and whether or not to do this thing or
[44:06] to do that thing he said
[44:08] i have given everything up for the
[44:10] gospel
[44:11] and i think we need some more of that i
[44:14] i would just say that to you tonight and
[44:16] just before we get into the study but
[44:18] we need to we need some people that are
[44:20] willing to give up everything for the
[44:22] gospel
[44:23] that are willing to to be like the
[44:26] beggars were when they were there at the
[44:27] gate of jerusalem and
[44:29] and they said we're going to die if we
[44:31] stay here why sit we here till we die
[44:34] let's go on in let's let's find the camp
[44:37] let's go in and
[44:38] and try to get some let's be hungry for
[44:40] the word of god
[44:41] let's get a move on let's not just sit
[44:44] here forever and i think that would be
[44:46] every one of our hearts here tonight and
[44:48] and it's how we should be
[44:50] self-control that we would we would put
[44:52] things in their right order and we would
[44:54] we would stress on the things that need
[44:56] to be stressed on
[44:58] the branham defines temperances you can
[45:00] go look it up but he defies it
[45:02] as how to control your tongue and your
[45:04] temper
[45:07] not so much drinking is what we call
[45:10] temperance today but how to control your
[45:12] tongue
[45:13] and your temper if you can't control
[45:15] your tongue or your temper you're not
[45:17] qualified for the ministry
[45:22] it's true there's other qualifications
[45:24] beyond marriage for ministry
[45:28] and i'm saying that myself you know i'm
[45:30] preaching at myself not brother allen's
[45:31] but the other preacher's sitting here
[45:33] but
[45:33] if we can't control our temper in our
[45:35] tongues we've got problems
[45:37] i had brother david back here and you
[45:40] know if you've ever spoken before people
[45:42] you've got to control your temper in
[45:43] your tongue right you got to learn to do
[45:47] that
[45:49] now paul is setting a precedent
[45:52] you know what a precedent is if you have
[45:55] a court case the supreme court loves to
[45:57] use precedent they say well they don't
[45:59] want to do anything that hasn't been
[46:00] done before
[46:02] every once in a while they'll change a
[46:03] precedent but they don't do that lightly
[46:04] because once something is set in the law
[46:06] you just continue following that you
[46:09] know we wouldn't know without paul we
[46:10] wouldn't know how to conduct ministry at
[46:12] all
[46:13] we wouldn't know how to wash feet how to
[46:16] have communion
[46:17] we wouldn't know what we believe about
[46:19] the rapture we wouldn't know whether
[46:21] there was a resurrection
[46:23] there's a lot of things we wouldn't know
[46:24] without the apostle paul
[46:26] and that's why brother branham could
[46:27] look back at being the prophet of the
[46:29] end times he could look back at what
[46:30] paul preached and said
[46:32] if when he was there on the beyond the
[46:34] curtain of time and say i preached what
[46:35] paul preached
[46:37] and i challenge anybody to find
[46:39] something closer to what paul preached
[46:40] than this message
[46:43] right there's nothing closer to it
[46:45] because it's the very revelation of that
[46:47] and
[46:47] as it is in the light of this hour but
[46:50] but
[46:50] people you know you say well are the
[46:52] baptists close to what paul preached or
[46:54] the methodists or the pentecostals not
[46:56] to pick on anyone
[46:57] are the catholics close to what paul
[46:59] preached no
[47:00] no they're not you can just find glaring
[47:03] differences but we
[47:04] are supposed to be what paul preached
[47:08] amen and so he's setting a precedent
[47:10] brother branham talks in the church age
[47:12] book how that
[47:13] that pattern would be set for every true
[47:16] messenger down to the ages
[47:18] but it wouldn't just be the messengers
[47:20] who would also be the ministry
[47:23] down to the ages that that pattern would
[47:25] be set for
[47:27] and so paul deals with some things in
[47:28] corinthians beyond just
[47:30] the problems in the local church he sets
[47:32] the church in order
[47:34] and we're so grateful for that because
[47:35] it set us in order as well
[47:39] first corinthians 9 1 he says am i not
[47:41] an apostle
[47:43] he says am i not free have i not seen
[47:46] jesus christ our lord
[47:48] are you not ye my work in the lord now
[47:51] he's
[47:52] stressing his qualifications
[47:55] he says if i be not an apostle unto
[47:57] others yet doubtless i am to you because
[47:59] he started that church
[48:01] he said for the seal of mine apostleship
[48:03] are ye in the lord you're
[48:04] you're the results of my ministry i
[48:08] thought about that and i thought you
[48:09] know every one of us are here because of
[48:10] the message of the hour
[48:12] all right i'm a result of brother
[48:13] brown's ministry in this age i really am
[48:16] and so are you these churches are that
[48:18] we have today are a result of the
[48:20] ministry of
[48:20] of william branham we can say it this
[48:22] way the ministry of christ and william
[48:24] branham
[48:25] or the result of that and and so the
[48:28] seal the apostleship you take somebody
[48:29] now they question that say well maybe it
[48:31] was a false prophet
[48:32] but we're the results of what he
[48:34] preached and i think those results are
[48:36] good results
[48:39] i refuse to just be negative about it
[48:41] all the time
[48:42] and say everything's just just going
[48:43] downhill and everything's going to the
[48:45] bride's just going to fall apart and
[48:47] and then we'll get by the skin of our
[48:48] teeth somehow we'll go into rapture no
[48:50] we're not going down
[48:51] we're going up right not everybody's
[48:54] bright but we're going up the bride's
[48:56] going up
[48:58] he didn't say there'd be a bunch of us
[49:00] jamie just said we were going up
[49:02] and so if it's just a few if it's just
[49:04] me and you then we'll keep
[49:06] preaching you keep listening and we'll
[49:07] keep working going up
[49:09] right and no matter what what happens
[49:12] and what goes on around us and
[49:14] though the world's lost all self-control
[49:16] will still be governed by the word why
[49:18] because we're the bride of christ amen
[49:22] we're predestined to do that we're
[49:24] preordained to be here
[49:26] he said this bride would not fall could
[49:28] not fall
[49:32] amen now
[49:35] so he says i'm an apostle i'm free
[49:37] there's no hierarchy over me
[49:40] and he said that apostleship gives me
[49:41] certain rights
[49:44] as a minister of the gospel i have
[49:45] certain rights and if i use my power who
[49:48] could stop me
[49:49] he's not really talking about abusing
[49:50] though some abuse the power of ministry
[49:53] but he's talking about using it to its
[49:54] fullness there's certain rights that i
[49:57] have i can use
[49:59] and you could say that with any position
[50:02] of responsibility there's certain things
[50:04] you could do
[50:05] and brother allen and i were talking
[50:07] about being at work late you know or
[50:09] doing something like that
[50:10] you know you could leave at 4 30 every
[50:13] day
[50:13] on the dot but you don't always
[50:17] because with great freedom comes great
[50:19] responsibility
[50:21] just because you can doesn't mean you
[50:23] should
[50:25] there's times you do things that you you
[50:27] go the extra mile
[50:29] and paul is setting a a standard a gold
[50:32] standard
[50:33] of that for us that he's saying that i
[50:36] went the extra mile
[50:37] he paul went beyond what he had to do
[50:41] way beyond what he had to do and yet he
[50:44] said certain things in the church
[50:46] at the same time so he says there's no
[50:48] hierarchy over me i have certain rights
[50:50] if i use my power who could stop me
[50:52] but the fact that you exist as a church
[50:55] is proof that
[50:56] i'm an apostle now brother brown says
[50:58] this he said character is a victory not
[51:00] a gift
[51:02] and that's a profound statement you've
[51:05] heard it before but just ponder that in
[51:07] this context for a moment character is a
[51:09] victory
[51:09] not a gift a man without character can't
[51:11] reign
[51:12] he can't reign god won't let him
[51:17] right so he's going to give us character
[51:20] so brother ben how do i get character
[51:22] you go back and see where brother
[51:23] was talking about this in the context
[51:25] he's talking about about the suffering
[51:27] and how god stands by and lets him
[51:29] suffer that's how you get character
[51:32] it's through suffering sometimes there's
[51:34] no other way but harvey but through
[51:35] suffering you get character we don't
[51:37] understand that
[51:38] we don't want to suffer none of us would
[51:40] choose to suffer
[51:41] none of us would choose to go through
[51:43] some of the things that you all have
[51:44] been through
[51:45] none of us would choose to go through
[51:46] that but but the fact that you're here
[51:49] god is working on your character because
[51:52] you're going to reign one day
[51:54] and he said a man without character
[51:56] can't reign because power apart from
[51:57] character is satanic
[51:59] but power with character is fit to rule
[52:04] paul is being challenged in his
[52:06] apostleship in his ministry
[52:08] and verse 3 said my answer to them that
[52:09] do examine me is this
[52:12] he says you're examining me you're
[52:13] saying that i don't have a writer i'm
[52:15] not an apostle or i shouldn't take the
[52:17] authority that i do
[52:19] so he says my answer to them that do
[52:20] examine me is this
[52:22] you know what the fact that paul's being
[52:24] criticized puts us in good company
[52:27] because we get criticized too but that's
[52:28] just part of being a christian
[52:32] he says in verse four have not have we
[52:34] not power to eat and to drink
[52:36] in other words have we not power to
[52:38] expect
[52:40] to be fed while we feed the sheep
[52:44] and then he says this he says have we
[52:46] not power to lead about a sister a wife
[52:48] as well as other apostles
[52:50] as the brethren of the lord and cephas
[52:52] i'd always taken this to mean that
[52:54] paul was defending or saying the fact
[52:58] that he was unmarried but actually what
[53:00] he's saying if you go and look at it
[53:02] is he's saying that these other apostles
[53:05] had a wife and a family
[53:07] that the church took care of and paul
[53:10] said i have the right
[53:12] for the church to take care of my family
[53:14] because as a minister that he's setting
[53:16] that precedent
[53:17] you understand that the church would
[53:19] take care of
[53:21] his wife and his children young children
[53:24] that's that's part of it right and then
[53:27] don't get nervous on me tonight because
[53:30] if there ever was a church that did
[53:32] wonderful in their finances it's this
[53:34] one
[53:35] for the number of people that we have as
[53:36] far as tithing you all
[53:38] just just do wonderful on that and your
[53:40] tithes paying a bunch of people
[53:42] and i appreciate that i couldn't be here
[53:44] and as i am with
[53:45] just working in the church and you
[53:47] support my family and
[53:48] i'm thankful for that so that's not why
[53:50] i'm preaching this tonight but
[53:52] he's saying when you talk about
[53:54] self-control in the ministry saying i
[53:55] have a
[53:56] right to but i don't
[53:59] the right is there but i don't now
[54:03] he said so i have a right for my family
[54:04] to live off of the gospel
[54:07] the apostles not only lived off the
[54:08] tithing he spoke of cephas which is
[54:10] peter
[54:11] the other apostles the brethren of the
[54:12] lord that lived
[54:14] not only themselves but their wives and
[54:17] their children off of the gospel
[54:19] he said verse six or i only and barnabas
[54:22] have not we power to forbear working in
[54:24] other words
[54:25] we have a right as the apostles to not
[54:28] work a day job we have a right to
[54:30] as we travel to be cared for by the
[54:31] church when paul would go somewhere he'd
[54:33] go get a job
[54:35] at the tent factory because that was his
[54:37] trade
[54:38] and it's a it's amazing but look at the
[54:41] example of humility that he put before
[54:43] us
[54:44] he said i'm not too good to work
[54:48] right give us a good example you know
[54:50] they say one of the the qualifications
[54:52] for being called to preach is
[54:54] loving fried chicken wanting to quit
[54:55] your job
[54:58] but that wasn't paul paul kept working
[55:02] and i was telling the brother brother
[55:03] allen earlier that you know i feel like
[55:05] i owe
[55:06] not so much an answer for the money
[55:08] although i i do
[55:09] feel a weight of responsibility for that
[55:13] but also for my time and
[55:16] not that i would never take a vacation
[55:17] because i'll do that and my family needs
[55:19] that but
[55:21] but at the same time i have to answer
[55:23] for that i have to work
[55:25] you know if i'm going to be a pastor i
[55:27] have to work
[55:28] i just do my work here or with you or
[55:32] or whatever that it is they're studying
[55:33] and and preparing these things but
[55:36] it's still work if somebody else stands
[55:38] behind this pulpit i still worked
[55:39] that week right and and so that's
[55:43] that's my job that's what i do and if if
[55:47] something happened and we fell into a
[55:48] depression and the church was unable to
[55:50] support me
[55:50] i'd go get a job and and have two jobs
[55:54] and that's what i did for 15 years and
[55:57] and so we would we would continue to do
[56:00] that and
[56:01] and so and there's nothing wrong with
[56:02] that in fact brother branham talks about
[56:05] that a man
[56:05] a christian will work he's the only one
[56:09] that will work
[56:10] now but he said we do have the power to
[56:12] forebear working verse seven who go with
[56:14] warfare
[56:15] who go with a warfare any time at his
[56:17] own charges
[56:19] who planteth the vineyard and eateth not
[56:20] all the fruit thereof you know if you go
[56:22] to war
[56:23] you expect there to be a supply tent and
[56:25] they give you the supplies and the stuff
[56:27] to be able to fight with
[56:28] because you're you're giving your life
[56:31] right you're fighting in that arena and
[56:32] so the people pay with their taxes and
[56:34] things to provide for our soldiers and
[56:37] and thank god for somebody who's willing
[56:38] to put their life on the line in that
[56:40] way
[56:41] so he says who go for warfare any time
[56:43] at his own charges who planted the
[56:45] vineyard and he has thought of the fruit
[56:46] thereof
[56:47] who feedeth the flock and he is not of
[56:48] the milk of the flock
[56:50] he says verse 8 say i these things as a
[56:52] man or saith not the law the same also
[56:54] i love the way paul backs this up he
[56:56] said this is scriptural
[56:58] we have a scripture for this verse nine
[57:00] for it is written in the law of moses
[57:02] thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the
[57:03] ox that treadeth out the corn
[57:06] now that's a pretty fascinating
[57:07] statement because
[57:09] you know you think of some cheapskate
[57:11] that had to be written for a reason
[57:14] because somebody out there was muzzling
[57:15] the ox
[57:17] right because they didn't want him
[57:19] eating the stuff he was
[57:21] he was planting and stuff he was he was
[57:23] treading out the corn he was the one
[57:25] doing all the work
[57:26] and yet they muzzled him and written in
[57:29] the law of god said don't do that
[57:33] don't do that he deserves to eat of the
[57:36] work partake of the work that he's
[57:38] that he's doing and he says does god
[57:40] take care for oxygen in other words is
[57:42] god just saying that about
[57:43] about oxes about oxen
[57:46] or saith he al it all together for our
[57:48] sakes he said for our sakes no doubt it
[57:51] is written
[57:51] he that plowed should plow in hope he
[57:54] that thresheth in hopes should be
[57:56] partaker of his hope
[57:58] and that's why every minister will labor
[58:00] in his own field and be partakers of the
[58:02] prosperity of the people or the
[58:04] or the people the lack that the people
[58:07] have
[58:08] he's a partaker of that uh their
[58:11] struggles the minister receives tithes
[58:12] and pays tithes
[58:14] the minister doesn't pay ties he
[58:16] shouldn't receive ties
[58:18] that's right
[58:22] i have visiting ministers in and i'm i'm
[58:25] i'm going to bore you a little bit
[58:26] tonight i know but it's just where we're
[58:28] at and
[58:28] but i want to talk about self-control
[58:30] and i want to be open about these things
[58:31] brother branham was very open about
[58:32] things
[58:33] brother branham told us i think 27 times
[58:35] the message how much he made every week
[58:39] and the reason was because he wanted us
[58:41] to have confidence that he wasn't just
[58:42] taking all the money
[58:43] and people will say that today people
[58:45] slander preachers with that
[58:46] and it is a slander because the truth is
[58:50] the
[58:50] preacher the minister the pastor has a
[58:52] right to the tithes from the church
[58:54] period that's what paul taught but
[58:57] we use self-control in those things
[59:00] right now if a minister comes in that
[59:04] comes from my ties if i ever have to
[59:05] raise an offering here at the church for
[59:07] brother andrew somebody to come in we
[59:09] won't have them in
[59:10] because that's my job right and and then
[59:14] you know unless there was just so few
[59:15] here that we just couldn't do it
[59:17] but i i would i don't believe in that i
[59:20] that comes from my tithes that's that's
[59:22] my tenth i just won't have as many
[59:24] preachers in i'll save up my money until
[59:25] we're able to have them in
[59:27] brother joshua goff some time ago he may
[59:29] be listening tonight i
[59:31] uh a minister he had a really small
[59:33] church there in texas and south texas
[59:35] he's moved on to another church now but
[59:37] he had a little church here he kind of
[59:39] started and his family and
[59:41] and he saved up his money for months to
[59:43] have me come down and preach a meeting
[59:45] for him
[59:46] and i thank god for that you know that
[59:48] that's part of what we do that's what
[59:50] we're supposed to do
[59:52] that comes from my tithes evangelists
[59:54] preaching a weekend meeting here
[59:56] draw the same amount for a week's work
[59:58] as i do if they're a full-time
[59:59] evangelist
[1:00:00] because i i feel obligated i felt i
[1:00:03] don't want to muzzle the ox that treads
[1:00:05] out the corn
[1:00:06] and plus their their travel expenses
[1:00:09] brother brown says this about ties and
[1:00:11] we'll just we'll go into that let's read
[1:00:13] first corinthians 9
[1:00:14] 11 first he said if we have sown unto
[1:00:15] you spiritual things
[1:00:17] is it a great thing if we shall reap
[1:00:19] your carnal things
[1:00:20] and he says this he said would it be
[1:00:22] wrong to use tithes on church building
[1:00:24] funds
[1:00:26] and i know you understand this this is
[1:00:29] the worst church in the world to preach
[1:00:30] this to
[1:00:32] so i feel kind of self-conscious tonight
[1:00:33] because you all pay your tithes but
[1:00:36] but churches don't understand this
[1:00:38] people don't understand this all around
[1:00:40] the message they don't understand this
[1:00:42] and brother branham says well i don't
[1:00:44] say everywhere but places different
[1:00:46] places i've been they've not understood
[1:00:47] this
[1:00:48] he said well now he said here's a touchy
[1:00:50] little thing for the church now he said
[1:00:52] no correctly tithes is to go to the
[1:00:53] minister
[1:00:54] he said that's right in the bible they
[1:00:56] had a box they set up the door in the
[1:00:57] old testament
[1:00:58] he said in the building said the box was
[1:01:00] the fun with the people put in there for
[1:01:01] repairing so i don't think we're
[1:01:02] too unscriptural to have the the plates
[1:01:04] at the back during this covid time
[1:01:06] because that's what they did they put a
[1:01:08] box at the back he said but a tenth
[1:01:11] of the tithings he first has a tenth of
[1:01:13] that went and he says the tenth of the
[1:01:14] tithing but then he says all the
[1:01:16] tithings went to their priests
[1:01:17] their pastors so they had the box for
[1:01:19] the building fund tithings went to the
[1:01:21] priests
[1:01:22] he said yes tithings are to go for
[1:01:23] nothing else he said i know people take
[1:01:26] the ties give them to a widow woman
[1:01:27] that's wrong
[1:01:28] if you've got anything to give the wit a
[1:01:30] woman give her but don't give her god's
[1:01:31] money that's not yours in the first
[1:01:32] place that's god's
[1:01:34] tithings goes into the church for the
[1:01:36] pastor and so forth to live live
[1:01:38] that to live on he said like that to
[1:01:40] live on and then the building funds and
[1:01:42] things like that as a separate fund all
[1:01:43] together
[1:01:44] he said now that is scriptural and
[1:01:46] that's the way it's all i'd have to
[1:01:47] change that when i come to the church
[1:01:48] here was already set up that way
[1:01:51] and and so that's the way we do it now
[1:01:54] brother branham taught emphatically that
[1:01:55] tithe was god's program to support the
[1:01:57] ministry
[1:01:58] but it's become a common practice and
[1:02:00] i'm telling you what i know today
[1:02:02] it's become a common practice in the
[1:02:03] message for that not to happen
[1:02:05] for them to give some little amount to
[1:02:07] the preacher and send the rest to some
[1:02:08] missionary organization
[1:02:09] for the church to do that and it's not
[1:02:12] right it's not biblical
[1:02:14] if the pastor wants to do that let him
[1:02:15] do that he's got complete right to do
[1:02:17] that but the church shouldn't mandate
[1:02:19] that
[1:02:20] and so he said should a person pay
[1:02:22] tithes to an individual or should a
[1:02:24] christian work
[1:02:26] and that's a loaded question isn't it
[1:02:28] and there must have been some preacher
[1:02:29] that wasn't working much
[1:02:31] he said should a person pay attention to
[1:02:32] an individual should a christian work
[1:02:34] sure he should
[1:02:35] he's the one man that will work as a
[1:02:36] christian amen to that
[1:02:39] i've tried to teach my kids you have to
[1:02:42] work
[1:02:43] you got to go to work and you're not
[1:02:45] going to you know
[1:02:46] don't expect any money if you won't work
[1:02:49] right that's that's the magic that shows
[1:02:51] up in your bank account where you're
[1:02:52] able to go to starbucks and do the
[1:02:54] things that you do
[1:02:55] is because you worked right and
[1:02:59] people don't understand that until they
[1:03:00] actually have to do it a lot of times
[1:03:01] but
[1:03:02] he said he's the one that will work as a
[1:03:03] christian he said pay ties to an
[1:03:05] individual it depends on who the
[1:03:06] individual is
[1:03:08] see he said but when you pay tithings
[1:03:10] really where you owe tithing this is
[1:03:11] where you get your food
[1:03:13] bring you all your tithings into my
[1:03:15] storehouse saith the lord that's right
[1:03:17] and prove me i love this he said we're
[1:03:20] in saith god that if
[1:03:21] not if i'll not open the windows of
[1:03:23] heaven and pour out a blessing
[1:03:24] that you would not have enough room to
[1:03:26] receive it but i challenge any man or
[1:03:28] woman that's not a tithe player to
[1:03:29] accept that and i've seen that
[1:03:31] and i know many of you have as well and
[1:03:33] we don't have to go over that but i
[1:03:35] i've seen god do that when i would pay
[1:03:37] my tithes and do what was right first
[1:03:39] and then see god something appear
[1:03:42] not magically but by the blessing of god
[1:03:46] god would bless me because of that and
[1:03:48] first corinthians 9
[1:03:49] 12 he said if others be partakers of
[1:03:51] this power over you are not we rather
[1:03:53] in other words paul says i got a right
[1:03:55] to do to live off of the gospel
[1:03:57] and every other apostle did there was
[1:03:59] nothing wrong with that
[1:04:01] i do that brother branham did it but he
[1:04:04] says
[1:04:04] we got a right to do this he said arnold
[1:04:06] we rather nevertheless we have not
[1:04:07] used this power but suffer all things
[1:04:11] lest we should hinder the gospel of
[1:04:13] christ
[1:04:14] paul said here's how it should be done
[1:04:17] and i thank god he did that
[1:04:19] right because it's helped the ministry
[1:04:21] down through the years but
[1:04:22] he said here's how it should be done but
[1:04:24] myself i won't do that because people
[1:04:26] won't understand it right
[1:04:29] because my goal is to see souls saved
[1:04:34] i wonder when we lost our focus
[1:04:37] what's the goal what are we doing here
[1:04:41] we we keep ourselves under self-control
[1:04:43] to see souls safe we want to see
[1:04:45] somebody saved
[1:04:46] we're not here just to make ourselves
[1:04:47] feel better right we're here to see
[1:04:50] souls saved
[1:04:51] and there's got to be one left somewhere
[1:04:53] we would be gone
[1:04:55] all right when that last one comes in
[1:04:56] we'll be going so there's got to be
[1:04:58] somewhere there's got to be a soul needs
[1:05:00] to be saved might be here might be in
[1:05:01] africa might be in india
[1:05:03] it might be somewhere in china it's
[1:05:05] somewhere
[1:05:06] then let's do everything we can here
[1:05:07] everything we can in africa everything
[1:05:09] we can
[1:05:09] across the ocean wherever it is see one
[1:05:12] soul saved
[1:05:14] it's worth it and and god will the
[1:05:17] gospel come to them at the right time
[1:05:18] now
[1:05:19] he said we suffer all things lest we
[1:05:21] should hinder the gospel of christ
[1:05:24] verse 13 do you not know that they which
[1:05:26] minister about holy things live of the
[1:05:28] things of the temple
[1:05:29] just driving this this idea home that
[1:05:31] the ministry have a right to these
[1:05:33] things
[1:05:34] he said they which weighed at the altar
[1:05:36] of partakers with the altar
[1:05:37] even so hath the lord ordained that they
[1:05:39] which preached the gospel should live
[1:05:40] with the gospel he says the lord
[1:05:42] ordained
[1:05:43] now people will tell you that tithes are
[1:05:44] not in the new testament that's wrong
[1:05:46] so if anybody ever tells you that i've
[1:05:48] been told that i was told that by church
[1:05:49] of christ
[1:05:50] minister one time he told me tithes are
[1:05:52] not in the new testament well that's
[1:05:54] wrong
[1:05:54] not only does paul deal with it in this
[1:05:56] chapter and other places
[1:05:59] but jesus instituted it
[1:06:02] jesus instituted the idea of of
[1:06:05] tithing or the ministry uh living off
[1:06:08] of uh the things the the the
[1:06:11] things that the people had now uh that's
[1:06:14] matthew 10 10. you can go look that up
[1:06:16] he said don't take anything with you
[1:06:18] because the workman is worthy of his
[1:06:19] meat
[1:06:21] all right and that's what paul says the
[1:06:22] ox don't muzzle the ox that treads out
[1:06:24] the corn
[1:06:25] all right so jesus instituted that
[1:06:27] that's not so if anybody ever tells you
[1:06:29] it's not in the new testament
[1:06:30] it is in the new testament first
[1:06:32] corinthians 9
[1:06:33] 15 but i have used none of these things
[1:06:37] neither have i written these things that
[1:06:38] it should be so done unto me
[1:06:40] for it were better for me to die than
[1:06:42] that any man should make my glory
[1:06:44] void for though i preached the gospel i
[1:06:47] have nothing to glory of
[1:06:49] necessity is laid upon me yay woe is
[1:06:51] unto me if i preached not the gospel in
[1:06:53] other words he said i have to preach
[1:06:55] i can't help but preach that's why
[1:06:58] brother brandon said if you
[1:06:59] if you're called to preach you're going
[1:07:00] to preach right and
[1:07:02] and he told the evangelist that talked
[1:07:04] about a pulpit he said the world is your
[1:07:06] pulpit
[1:07:07] the world is your pulpit because you're
[1:07:09] going to talk to somebody about the
[1:07:11] gospel
[1:07:12] if you're called you're going to do that
[1:07:14] i would go a little farther say if
[1:07:16] you're a christian you're going to talk
[1:07:17] to somebody about the gospel
[1:07:19] even if it's just your own family but
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:22] he says i have nothing to glory of if i
[1:07:24] preach the gospel for necessity is laid
[1:07:26] upon me yay
[1:07:27] woe is unto me if i preach not the
[1:07:29] gospel
[1:07:30] i've tried to quit it don't work very
[1:07:33] well
[1:07:36] he said for if i do this thing willingly
[1:07:38] i have a reward
[1:07:39] but if against my will and dispensation
[1:07:41] of the gospel is committed unto me
[1:07:43] what is my reward then verily when i
[1:07:45] preach the gospel i may make the gospel
[1:07:47] of christ without
[1:07:48] charge that i abused not my power
[1:07:52] in the gospel
[1:07:55] he's so careful to make sure that the
[1:07:58] people would have nothing on him
[1:08:00] they couldn't say he was doing it for
[1:08:01] money
[1:08:04] look at that example that he says i
[1:08:05] don't just say about money but about
[1:08:06] everything
[1:08:08] why because he's concerned with the main
[1:08:10] thing
[1:08:11] he wants to see souls saved this is
[1:08:14] paul's self-sacrifice he said i have the
[1:08:16] power
[1:08:16] but i don't abuse it
[1:08:20] brother branham spoke of us arkansas
[1:08:24] people when he talked about things like
[1:08:26] this and
[1:08:27] he said someone offered me here not long
[1:08:28] ago said brother branham we'll buy you a
[1:08:30] nice cadillac to ride
[1:08:32] i said a cadillac i said me go down
[1:08:33] through arkansas some of them poor
[1:08:35] little old arkansas
[1:08:36] down there picking cotton and
[1:08:39] some of you may have come from families
[1:08:41] like that and i knew people
[1:08:42] many people there but ivy church had
[1:08:44] picked cotton themselves old the elderly
[1:08:47] they knew what that was like it wasn't a
[1:08:49] slave thing it was
[1:08:51] the folks that were there they picked
[1:08:53] the cotton you live right out there
[1:08:55] in a little house and a lot of little
[1:08:57] houses are still there
[1:08:59] you see the little houses with uh maybe
[1:09:01] some shingles on the side and holes in
[1:09:03] the walls and
[1:09:05] and some people still try to rent those
[1:09:06] houses we went in one looked at it and
[1:09:08] it's like
[1:09:09] man i we couldn't believe they were
[1:09:10] still trying to rent that thing but
[1:09:12] i guess somebody would live in it and
[1:09:15] but that's the kind of people that they
[1:09:16] were they're poor people
[1:09:18] very poor people people around here know
[1:09:20] what poverty is
[1:09:22] especially those from years past his
[1:09:25] little mothers with their hands stuck up
[1:09:27] with cocker birds and things birds off
[1:09:28] that cotton picking pulling a sack
[1:09:30] half dead with female trouble and things
[1:09:32] like that is it eating fat bacon and
[1:09:35] cornbread for breakfast that actually
[1:09:36] sounds pretty good
[1:09:39] he said come put a dollar in my meeting
[1:09:41] and me riding a cadillac
[1:09:43] no sir no indeedy he said it no indeed
[1:09:45] he said i will never do that now again
[1:09:48] brother branham drove a new ford
[1:09:51] that the church gave him a brand new
[1:09:52] ford but you know
[1:09:54] he's temperate he understands that how
[1:09:56] this would appear to those people
[1:09:59] even though brother branham wouldn't
[1:10:00] have bought it with his own money but
[1:10:02] just be given to him
[1:10:03] he said i don't want to do it i'll abuse
[1:10:06] my power in the gospel
[1:10:07] first corinthians 9 19 for though i be
[1:10:09] free from all men
[1:10:11] i am free from all men he said no one no
[1:10:13] one has the right to tell me
[1:10:15] this is what you have to do paul this is
[1:10:18] way
[1:10:18] you shouldn't drive a cadillac paul no
[1:10:21] one has the right to tell me that
[1:10:23] there's no one higher than the apostle
[1:10:25] paul in that age no messenger
[1:10:27] higher than him he said i'm free from
[1:10:28] all men yet have i made myself
[1:10:30] servant unto all that i might gain the
[1:10:33] more
[1:10:36] god help us to have that kind of an
[1:10:38] attitude don't you want that kind of an
[1:10:40] attitude about the gospel
[1:10:42] lord whatever it takes
[1:10:45] whatever it takes i'm not i'll you can
[1:10:47] walk over me you can do whatever you can
[1:10:50] you can be right i don't care if it can
[1:10:53] win a soul
[1:10:55] i'll let you be right go on believe in
[1:10:56] what you believe if it'll win a soul
[1:11:00] now we preach the word of god from the
[1:11:02] pulpit you understand that
[1:11:03] but i'm not going to argue with you
[1:11:04] about it
[1:11:07] that's not my job our job is not an
[1:11:09] argument our job is to
[1:11:11] preach the word huh
[1:11:15] i've made myself a servant unto all
[1:11:17] means i'm going to treat everybody right
[1:11:20] i'm going to treat them how i would want
[1:11:22] to be treated that i might gain the more
[1:11:25] unto the jews he said i became as a jew
[1:11:28] that i might gain the jews
[1:11:30] to them that are under the laws under
[1:11:32] the law that i might gain them that are
[1:11:33] under the law
[1:11:35] listen you have to be careful
[1:11:38] some people are black and white in their
[1:11:40] nature they're just black and white
[1:11:43] i don't mean to pick on the deacons but
[1:11:44] i've known deacons like that black and
[1:11:46] white
[1:11:47] everything's black and white we had a
[1:11:50] deacon
[1:11:51] lester's hard to probably watch tonight
[1:11:53] but or watch it later but
[1:11:54] we had a deacon that if you had to seat
[1:11:56] people if you see certain people in
[1:11:58] certain places you had to see
[1:11:59] the same that same class of people you
[1:12:02] had to seat them there too
[1:12:03] you couldn't take anything else into
[1:12:05] account well the world's not black and
[1:12:06] white
[1:12:07] there's a reason why i don't like people
[1:12:08] sitting in the back but there's a reason
[1:12:10] why you sit in the back sometimes
[1:12:12] i get that i understand that
[1:12:15] i'd rather you sit right up here on the
[1:12:17] front row every one of you
[1:12:19] at least we probably got enough chairs
[1:12:21] right here on the front
[1:12:22] for almost everybody on a wednesday
[1:12:24] night
[1:12:25] but you know that's me but but there's a
[1:12:28] reason why you wouldn't do that
[1:12:31] right we had three of those reasons
[1:12:34] and sometimes the elderly have a reason
[1:12:36] there's different reasons why you would
[1:12:37] you wouldn't do that
[1:12:39] but man i went off the reservation
[1:12:42] didn't i
[1:12:45] but everything's not black and white the
[1:12:48] same apostle that told the galatians
[1:12:50] they were traitors to the message of
[1:12:52] grace
[1:12:53] if they went back to circumcision went
[1:12:55] to jerusalem and had timothy circumcised
[1:12:59] to try to get along with people that
[1:13:00] hated him and when they found out he was
[1:13:03] a greek they arrested him anyway
[1:13:08] and but what is paul doing now if
[1:13:11] someone had come and told paul you've
[1:13:12] got to circumcise timothy he wouldn't
[1:13:14] have done it
[1:13:16] right but he did it in the interest of
[1:13:18] trying to get along
[1:13:22] and we would look that oh you
[1:13:24] compromised no he didn't
[1:13:27] no one told him to do it he did it
[1:13:28] voluntarily you understand he wasn't
[1:13:31] doing it because
[1:13:32] it was doing it to fulfill the law the
[1:13:34] law was nothing law had been done away
[1:13:36] with
[1:13:37] right the law was wrapped up in christ
[1:13:40] but he did it he become a jew to the
[1:13:42] jews
[1:13:43] that i might gain the jews he said to
[1:13:46] them to the under the law
[1:13:47] as under the law that i might gain them
[1:13:49] that are under the law
[1:13:51] you'll find where paul shaved his head
[1:13:52] for a vow he didn't have to do that
[1:13:55] that's what the jews did so he did it
[1:13:57] paul would operate as a jew around the
[1:13:59] jews
[1:14:00] because that's what they were he said
[1:14:02] and he didn't
[1:14:03] he didn't purposely offend them we
[1:14:04] didn't have to
[1:14:07] and yet he would not separate from the
[1:14:08] gentiles either
[1:14:10] because he told peter that was wrong now
[1:14:14] he said to them that are without laws
[1:14:16] without law
[1:14:17] being not without law to god so he said
[1:14:19] i still lived right
[1:14:22] but under the law to christ that i might
[1:14:25] gain them that are without law
[1:14:28] and it's paul's message to the sanhedrin
[1:14:30] he identifies as a pharisee
[1:14:33] go and read it he talks to the sanhedrin
[1:14:34] counselor he says hey it's for the hope
[1:14:36] of the resurrection i'm called in
[1:14:38] into question and he's telling the truth
[1:14:41] but not all of it
[1:14:42] right but and the pharisees and
[1:14:44] sadducees rose up against each other
[1:14:46] then
[1:14:47] because the sadducees didn't believe in
[1:14:49] the resurrection but he identified
[1:14:51] himself as a pharisee but in his sermon
[1:14:53] on mars hill
[1:14:54] he quoted dead greek poets
[1:14:58] and people probably criticized him just
[1:15:00] like they do today well you
[1:15:02] quote other people too much and not
[1:15:03] brother branham enough well
[1:15:05] i i quote brother branham more than you
[1:15:07] all is to use one of paul's phrases
[1:15:10] i probably do but if i have to
[1:15:13] quote a dead greek poet to win a soul
[1:15:16] i'll do it
[1:15:20] are you with me now
[1:15:23] he said to the weak became as weak that
[1:15:26] i might gain the weak
[1:15:28] in other words those that didn't eat
[1:15:29] meat and wouldn't wouldn't do things on
[1:15:31] sunday wouldn't wouldn't do things you
[1:15:32] know
[1:15:33] they they lived every day they had holy
[1:15:35] days and things when paul was around him
[1:15:36] he observed that
[1:15:39] when he was around the greeks if they
[1:15:40] ate things offered idols he didn't ask
[1:15:42] about it
[1:15:43] he didn't seek it out find out where it
[1:15:46] came from
[1:15:48] he says i became weak to the week that i
[1:15:50] might gain the weak i am made
[1:15:52] all things to all men that i might by
[1:15:55] all
[1:15:56] means if you have your bibles you can
[1:15:58] underline that all means
[1:15:59] all means save some you can
[1:16:03] you can be an instrument in saving
[1:16:04] somebody by all means i
[1:16:06] made all things to all men that i might
[1:16:08] by all means save some
[1:16:10] if whether it's by helping out at the
[1:16:12] fellowship hall whether it's by cleaning
[1:16:14] the church whether it's by
[1:16:15] helping brother joe has been helping
[1:16:17] with the with the music and
[1:16:19] maybe you get out of your position
[1:16:21] sometimes and uncomfortable
[1:16:22] but by all all beings
[1:16:26] all means we're on the internet because
[1:16:28] of all means
[1:16:30] i made all things to all men that i
[1:16:32] might by all means save some
[1:16:35] he said can the internet be used wrong
[1:16:37] it is used wrong
[1:16:39] there's people watching tonight that
[1:16:40] should be in church probably somewhere
[1:16:43] i'm not talking about our congregation
[1:16:44] but other folks that that watch it don't
[1:16:47] go to church they probably should be in
[1:16:48] church but you know what
[1:16:49] by all means but i might by all means
[1:16:53] save some
[1:16:56] this is my aim this is my goal he says
[1:16:59] and i will let nothing distract me
[1:17:01] from that goal i wonder if we could
[1:17:04] gather
[1:17:04] get that kind of an attitude towards the
[1:17:07] gospel
[1:17:08] this is the kind of attitude that maybe
[1:17:10] we once had towards the message
[1:17:12] whatever it takes to spread the message
[1:17:15] i think brother robert
[1:17:16] wilson and and he's going to africa this
[1:17:18] spring again and
[1:17:19] trying to get into ghana and and i went
[1:17:22] to africa with him once and his whole
[1:17:23] family worked
[1:17:25] from the time they were little kind of
[1:17:26] like mine are doing now but they worked
[1:17:28] and they did uh the websites and
[1:17:31] different things for him that
[1:17:32] so he could promote the message and that
[1:17:35] whole family their whole life
[1:17:36] they were doctors and lawyers and
[1:17:38] engineers there in chicago
[1:17:39] their entire lives was focused on
[1:17:41] spreading the gospel
[1:17:43] every thought every time you were around
[1:17:45] them it was what can we do
[1:17:46] to get this message into a place where
[1:17:48] it's not been
[1:17:50] thank god for that somebody's got to do
[1:17:54] that and not everybody can do that all
[1:17:55] the time but if you can't
[1:17:56] you can support somebody who does
[1:17:59] right it's my aim it's my goal i don't
[1:18:02] want to let nothing distract me from
[1:18:03] that goal
[1:18:04] see i could i could go over here and i
[1:18:06] could live a certain way that
[1:18:07] would be in my right my freedom remember
[1:18:09] paul has just got done talking about how
[1:18:11] those
[1:18:12] eight things that were sacrificed to
[1:18:13] idols and they used abuse their freedom
[1:18:16] he says i could do that but i will let
[1:18:19] nothing distract me from my goal of
[1:18:21] winning souls
[1:18:22] and if i have to give up a little bit if
[1:18:24] i have to give up a little money if i
[1:18:25] have to give up a little prestige
[1:18:27] whatever it takes let me let them talk
[1:18:30] about me if they want to
[1:18:31] but i'm going to win a soul to christ
[1:18:34] that's my goal that's what i want that's
[1:18:36] my desire
[1:18:37] we're living in a time when that's hard
[1:18:40] we don't have to see as many baptisms as
[1:18:42] we used to
[1:18:43] i watch my brothers overseas but then i
[1:18:46] get a little bit jealous sometimes you
[1:18:47] watch them they're still baptizing
[1:18:49] people every week
[1:18:50] every week i've got friends overseas
[1:18:52] that baptize people
[1:18:54] and we look around here and you think
[1:18:56] you just don't baptize people that often
[1:18:59] but if there's one
[1:19:02] if there's one if there's one
[1:19:06] person you say well how do you know that
[1:19:08] there
[1:19:09] is one maybe there's not well you
[1:19:10] weren't always a christian
[1:19:14] our kids aren't born christians
[1:19:17] they have they have to give their hearts
[1:19:19] to christ they have to receive the holy
[1:19:20] ghost they have to be baptized
[1:19:24] and so by all means that's my aim it's
[1:19:27] my goal i want to read some
[1:19:29] brother brown said this in desperation
[1:19:30] he said on the lamb's book of life i
[1:19:32] want my name wrote
[1:19:33] i want him to remember me when the roll
[1:19:35] call he said and it throws me into
[1:19:37] desperation
[1:19:39] that is like paul said after i have
[1:19:40] preached the gospel shall i be a
[1:19:42] stowaway
[1:19:42] shall be a cast off he said it could
[1:19:44] happen
[1:19:46] so it throws me into a desperate stage
[1:19:50] desperation to think of after all these
[1:19:53] years of preaching
[1:19:55] he said could i a place come where i
[1:19:57] could fail him
[1:19:59] what's the next move what must i do next
[1:20:03] he said and it throws me into a nervous
[1:20:05] stage
[1:20:06] and what can i do he said it throws me
[1:20:08] to the mountains and to the valleys
[1:20:10] he said it's hard because when i'm with
[1:20:13] the people
[1:20:14] i've got to be all things to all men
[1:20:17] that i might win some to christ
[1:20:20] yet with that token always before me
[1:20:24] he's desperate he wants to do the right
[1:20:26] thing see but but yet he's got to
[1:20:29] he understands when he's around the
[1:20:30] people he's got to be all things to all
[1:20:32] men
[1:20:33] so when he's at home sometimes he's got
[1:20:35] to put on an apron help do the dishes
[1:20:38] all things to all men that by all means
[1:20:41] i might read some brother branham uses
[1:20:42] that and talks about hunting
[1:20:44] he says sometimes hunting a person has a
[1:20:46] similar interest you talk about hunting
[1:20:48] all things to all men that i might reach
[1:20:51] some huh maybe you go to a car auction
[1:20:55] maybe you go to a
[1:20:56] livestock auction maybe you may be
[1:20:58] around people at work but all things oh
[1:20:59] man you're looking for that opportunity
[1:21:01] to
[1:21:02] talk to somebody about jesus because you
[1:21:04] know they're not gonna make it not in
[1:21:06] this age you're not gonna make it
[1:21:06] without him
[1:21:10] god help us yet with that token he said
[1:21:12] always before me so we don't we don't
[1:21:14] transgress
[1:21:15] in that we don't we don't go down to the
[1:21:16] bar and sit in the bar room and talk to
[1:21:18] the drunks because
[1:21:19] that would be the wrong place we don't
[1:21:20] go on their grounds
[1:21:22] but whenever we have opportunity we're
[1:21:24] all things to all men
[1:21:26] we might reach some and paul says in
[1:21:29] verse 23 this i do for the gospel's sake
[1:21:32] that i might be partaker thereof with
[1:21:34] you
[1:21:37] the great scottish preacher alexander
[1:21:38] mclaren said said it this way he said we
[1:21:40] can do no good
[1:21:41] by standing on a height and fleeing down
[1:21:43] the gospel to the people below
[1:21:46] they must feel that we enter into their
[1:21:48] circumstances prejudices ways of
[1:21:50] thinking and the like
[1:21:51] if our words are to have power he said
[1:21:53] that is true
[1:21:54] about all christian teachers whether of
[1:21:56] old or young you must be a boy among
[1:21:58] boys and try to show that you enter into
[1:21:59] the boy's nature
[1:22:01] or you may lecture till doomsday and do
[1:22:03] no good
[1:22:04] that's true i watch that with young
[1:22:08] people
[1:22:09] for years we run that that youth banquet
[1:22:13] at brother ivy's and i watched that over
[1:22:14] the years
[1:22:15] that the young people and preachers
[1:22:18] would come in and
[1:22:19] you know us message preachers have
[1:22:21] convenient ways of doing things and
[1:22:23] we're used to being in the back nobody
[1:22:24] bothering us come out here and preach
[1:22:26] and at the banquet we have a lot of fun
[1:22:29] we had a lot of fun and then we would
[1:22:31] have a few songs and go into the message
[1:22:33] but you know what it did it relaxed the
[1:22:34] young people
[1:22:36] it was we were being all things to all
[1:22:38] people
[1:22:39] that we might reach some and
[1:22:42] alexander mclaren said you can't stand
[1:22:44] and fling the gospel from the heights
[1:22:45] you've got to enter into a boy's nature
[1:22:48] or you can lecture till doomsday and do
[1:22:50] no good verse 24 know you not that they
[1:22:52] which run on a race run all
[1:22:54] one receiveth the prize so run that you
[1:22:56] may obtain
[1:22:59] don't you want to obtain don't you want
[1:23:01] to reach that goal
[1:23:03] he said to run you can't reach that goal
[1:23:06] sitting still
[1:23:06] there's got to be something in there
[1:23:08] church there's got to be some desire on
[1:23:10] the inside of it
[1:23:10] but david i want to reach it i'm
[1:23:13] pressing toward that goal paul says i
[1:23:15] pressed toward the mark
[1:23:16] of the high calling in christ there's
[1:23:18] got to be a hunger
[1:23:20] there and i got troubled by it in my
[1:23:23] mind today because i don't see that
[1:23:25] hunger everywhere
[1:23:26] i don't see i look forward to every
[1:23:28] service not just because i'm a preacher
[1:23:30] i want to be with the in the house of
[1:23:32] god because i've seen miracles happen in
[1:23:34] the house of god
[1:23:36] but it seems like people take any excuse
[1:23:38] they can take to
[1:23:39] to be out of the house of god and i
[1:23:41] don't understand it because
[1:23:43] there's got to be a hunger there if
[1:23:45] we're going to see something from god
[1:23:46] there's got to be a desire
[1:23:48] on the inside to reach reaching out for
[1:23:50] that mark
[1:23:51] if you want to reach the goal if you
[1:23:54] want to obtain
[1:23:55] run i mean to yell at you just a
[1:23:59] a few of us here tonight but run that
[1:24:02] you may obtain
[1:24:05] you want to obtain you want to achieve a
[1:24:06] goal you say well i've gotten older
[1:24:09] i've kind of rested on what i did back
[1:24:10] in the past no run
[1:24:13] that you may obtain run put some effort
[1:24:16] in it
[1:24:18] you can tell if somebody puts an effort
[1:24:20] into it put some effort into it
[1:24:23] run that you may obtain he said and
[1:24:25] every man there's trivis for the mastery
[1:24:27] it's temperate in all things he showed
[1:24:30] them his own temperance when it comes to
[1:24:32] money
[1:24:33] when it comes to having a family he said
[1:24:34] every man that striveth for the master
[1:24:36] is tempered in all things
[1:24:37] he said no they do it to obtain a
[1:24:38] corruptable crown but we are
[1:24:40] incorruptable
[1:24:42] i therefore so run not as uncertainly
[1:24:46] so in other words i'm not just in a days
[1:24:48] running around
[1:24:49] wondering where i'm going i know what
[1:24:50] i'm what my goal is
[1:24:53] i know where the finish line is what i
[1:24:55] thought we in this stage we can say that
[1:24:57] more than ever
[1:24:58] the rapture that shouts already went out
[1:25:01] we've already heard the message of the
[1:25:02] hour i run not uncertainly
[1:25:05] i don't just beat the air i fight i'm
[1:25:08] not shadow boxing
[1:25:10] i'm fighting against the enemy because i
[1:25:12] know
[1:25:13] there's a goal right in front of me and
[1:25:15] this is the age that'll reach it do you
[1:25:17] believe that tonight church
[1:25:19] this is the age that i'm reaching i run
[1:25:22] not as one that beateth the air i fight
[1:25:23] and i just want to be the fear but i
[1:25:25] keep
[1:25:25] under my body and bring it into
[1:25:28] subjection
[1:25:30] unless that by any means when i preach
[1:25:33] to my
[1:25:34] when i preach to others i myself should
[1:25:37] be a castaway
[1:25:39] word is disapproved not that he would be
[1:25:41] lost but that he would be disapproved
[1:25:43] before god for his ministry
[1:25:46] he said i keep under my body bring it
[1:25:49] into subjection
[1:25:50] god help us today i i'm temperate i
[1:25:53] don't
[1:25:54] always reply i don't always the way i
[1:25:56] want to
[1:25:57] i don't respond in hurt to people that
[1:26:00] hurt me
[1:26:02] they said about jesus peter said when he
[1:26:04] was reviled he reviled not again
[1:26:07] i keep my my temper and i keep my tongue
[1:26:11] and temperance and meekness i'm not just
[1:26:14] saying that about me but that's what
[1:26:15] paul's saying
[1:26:16] he said i do that because i'm reaching
[1:26:19] i'm reaching for a goal
[1:26:20] i want to reach that goal i don't want
[1:26:23] to
[1:26:24] get in by the skin of my teeth
[1:26:28] why do we preach you ever thought about
[1:26:31] that
[1:26:33] well number one as paul says
[1:26:37] he says woe unto me if i don't preach
[1:26:38] the gospel
[1:26:41] i if you can get by you say well i'm a
[1:26:44] preacher but i'm just not going to
[1:26:46] preach i'll let somebody else preach if
[1:26:47] you can get by with that go ahead
[1:26:50] but for me and i don't say you have to
[1:26:51] have a pulpit to preach you preach out
[1:26:53] on the street if you have to but you
[1:26:54] preach somewhere
[1:26:56] for me i have to preach i could have
[1:26:59] someone else stand here but this is my
[1:27:01] opportunity to present the gospel to you
[1:27:07] why do i preach because there's a goal
[1:27:11] and there's a certain amount of ability
[1:27:12] that i have and no more i can't make
[1:27:15] myself a better preacher in that sense
[1:27:17] i can study i can work i can lose weight
[1:27:19] there's a lot of things i can do but i
[1:27:21] can't
[1:27:21] i can't just give myself a better gift
[1:27:24] does that make sense
[1:27:25] can't do it and there's some men that
[1:27:27] have a gift that only feed five people
[1:27:29] some have gifts to feed hundreds
[1:27:31] thousands
[1:27:32] some only have a gift to talk to just
[1:27:34] somebody on the street
[1:27:36] but it's still a gift and to use that
[1:27:39] gift
[1:27:39] but their award told me years ago and
[1:27:41] i've always i pondered this over and
[1:27:43] over he said
[1:27:44] he said if you're nothing but a 10-cent
[1:27:45] preacher he said you only give god five
[1:27:48] cents
[1:27:48] you stole five cents from god
[1:27:54] and maybe others are dollar preachers
[1:27:55] you look at them and get discouraged and
[1:27:56] say well
[1:27:57] if i'm not gonna be like that i might as
[1:27:59] well just not do it no run
[1:28:01] that you may obtain
[1:28:05] keep under my body bring it into
[1:28:06] subjection unless by any means
[1:28:08] when i preach to others i myself should
[1:28:10] be a castaway why do we preach
[1:28:11] we preach because of the goal why did
[1:28:13] jesus endure the suffering that he
[1:28:15] that he did he said for the joy that was
[1:28:18] set before him
[1:28:20] amen what joy was that fellowship with
[1:28:22] you
[1:28:24] fellowship with me brother bill it what
[1:28:26] joy that was his joy
[1:28:28] he wanted to fellowship with us so for
[1:28:30] the joy that was set before him he
[1:28:32] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:28:35] amen brother brown says this and beyond
[1:28:38] the curtain of time he said the voice
[1:28:39] spoke to me
[1:28:41] you know it was written in the bible
[1:28:42] that the prophets were gathered with
[1:28:43] their people
[1:28:45] i said yes i remember that in the
[1:28:47] scriptures but there are
[1:28:48] not this many brahms voice replied these
[1:28:52] are not brahms
[1:28:53] these are your converts the ones you've
[1:28:56] led to the lord
[1:28:58] some of these women you think are so
[1:29:00] young and beautiful were more than 90
[1:29:01] years old
[1:29:03] when you led them to the lord no wonder
[1:29:06] they're crying out
[1:29:08] my precious brother
[1:29:12] don't you think it'll be worth it
[1:29:15] when you get there maybe that person you
[1:29:17] talk to in the street maybe that person
[1:29:19] maybe it's the money you sent overseas
[1:29:21] or something that helped and that person
[1:29:23] will
[1:29:24] will be there because of that and maybe
[1:29:26] because that person you talk to maybe
[1:29:28] some of you met down at the
[1:29:29] at the garage or the filling station or
[1:29:31] whatever that it was
[1:29:32] you realize what satan's doing today
[1:29:35] he's making it to where
[1:29:36] no one actually meets anybody
[1:29:39] all you fellowship with is what's on
[1:29:41] facebook and that isn't even real
[1:29:44] and it's i love being able to contact
[1:29:46] with people on that but you can't
[1:29:47] fellowship with somebody's spirit on
[1:29:48] there
[1:29:49] you fellowship with what they present
[1:29:52] right and here when i'm talking to you i
[1:29:54] can fellowship with you
[1:29:55] spirits we fellowship with one another
[1:29:58] right i can see your face
[1:30:00] i can see if you're mad at me if you're
[1:30:02] happy
[1:30:03] right i can see it some of you some of
[1:30:05] you i can't tell
[1:30:07] i'll learn one of these days but but
[1:30:10] that can you you can usually tell by
[1:30:12] people's faces what's going on whether
[1:30:14] they're listening
[1:30:15] you ever you know how it's same thing
[1:30:17] for a preacher is this when you're
[1:30:18] talking to somebody you know if they're
[1:30:19] listening or not
[1:30:21] all right most of the time if you're not
[1:30:22] looking at somebody you're not listening
[1:30:25] it's true and so and i've got a bad
[1:30:28] habit of doing that because you'll be
[1:30:29] talking to me and suddenly my mind will
[1:30:30] drift and i'll turn away and i've gotten
[1:30:32] in trouble for that before
[1:30:34] mostly from my wife but from other
[1:30:35] people too
[1:30:37] because if i'm not careful my mind will
[1:30:38] drift and i'll i'll think of something
[1:30:40] else i might walk away
[1:30:41] but if i'm really paying attention i'm
[1:30:42] looking at you
[1:30:44] and there's the faces that you can
[1:30:47] fellowship with the people satan's
[1:30:49] trying to take that away from us that
[1:30:50] personal fellowship but i think we
[1:30:52] should take every opportunity
[1:30:54] to spread the gospel in that way huh
[1:30:57] listen what they told brother brown said
[1:30:58] no wonder they're crying out
[1:31:00] my precious brother so you might see him
[1:31:02] there
[1:31:03] that person that you reach for the
[1:31:05] gospel
[1:31:07] he said then the multitude cried
[1:31:08] together if you hadn't gone forth with
[1:31:11] the gospel
[1:31:12] we wouldn't be here you say brother
[1:31:16] ben explain that to me how that works
[1:31:17] with predestination i can't explain that
[1:31:21] but he said it god
[1:31:24] the same god that predestinated the
[1:31:26] person to receive the gospel
[1:31:27] predestinated the one to preach it
[1:31:31] right he said if you hadn't gone forth
[1:31:33] with the gospel
[1:31:34] we wouldn't be here will there be
[1:31:37] anybody on that day
[1:31:39] i'd like to encourage you with this
[1:31:40] brother branham said that he said
[1:31:43] whenever you pray or
[1:31:46] send money or participate in some way in
[1:31:48] missions
[1:31:50] or something like that i'm paraphrasing
[1:31:51] but he says your name will
[1:31:53] always be associated with the souls that
[1:31:56] are won
[1:31:58] [Laughter]
[1:32:01] i don't want my name's never gonna be on
[1:32:03] anything they ain't gonna put my name on
[1:32:04] this church when i'm gone at the lord
[1:32:06] terry's
[1:32:07] it won't it won't have my name the
[1:32:08] memorial auditorium but i'll tell you
[1:32:10] this
[1:32:10] i want my name associated with some
[1:32:12] souls
[1:32:15] don't you would you want your name
[1:32:17] associated with some souls even if it
[1:32:18] was just
[1:32:19] a penny that you had to give but you
[1:32:21] gave it even if it was just i'm not
[1:32:22] trying to get your money but you
[1:32:23] understand i want you to be encouraged
[1:32:25] by that
[1:32:26] no wonder they're crying out my precious
[1:32:28] brother and the multitude cried out if
[1:32:30] you hadn't gone forth with the gospel
[1:32:32] we wouldn't be here thank the lord
[1:32:36] somebody will be there because of us
[1:32:37] there's a story that brother branham
[1:32:40] told about a magic flower
[1:32:44] and he told it i think in the message
[1:32:45] come follow me to some young people
[1:32:47] always struck me he said it was like a
[1:32:50] fairy tale he said a magic
[1:32:52] flower he said a man found a magic
[1:32:54] flower and the flower said if you'll
[1:32:55] keep me with you
[1:32:58] all the time wherever you go said i
[1:33:00] whatever you ask you can have
[1:33:03] that's a pretty powerful thing isn't it
[1:33:06] so they went to
[1:33:08] he said okay he said i need some money
[1:33:10] he said why don't you open that mountain
[1:33:12] show me all the gold all the diamonds
[1:33:14] everything that's in that mountain
[1:33:16] and so they went to the mountain the
[1:33:18] mountain opened up side of the mountain
[1:33:20] opened up and
[1:33:21] here they walk inside and there's gold
[1:33:22] there's silver there's jewels
[1:33:25] a man walks in he lays the flower on a
[1:33:28] rock and
[1:33:28] he walks over and grabs some gold and
[1:33:30] says i'm gonna go show them
[1:33:32] what i got here show the people look
[1:33:34] look what i got i'll be rich the rest of
[1:33:35] my life he starts to go out and the
[1:33:36] flower says
[1:33:37] don't forget the main thing
[1:33:43] so he run back in he got some silver and
[1:33:45] some gold and put it together and said
[1:33:46] i'll show him just how
[1:33:47] how many riches are here and starts to
[1:33:49] run back out and the fire says don't
[1:33:50] forget the main thing
[1:33:52] the third time brother brown said he got
[1:33:53] a piece of the rock the mountain was
[1:33:55] made out of
[1:33:56] he said we'll analyze it see what kind
[1:33:58] it is so we'll always be able to find
[1:33:59] the mountain
[1:34:00] that's why some people are today well
[1:34:02] we'll go through it and just
[1:34:03] just we'll understand it intellectually
[1:34:06] he start grabbed it and he started to
[1:34:08] leave with it and the flower said for
[1:34:09] the last time don't forget the main
[1:34:11] thing
[1:34:13] he says oh shut up he walks out the door
[1:34:16] and the mountain closes behind him
[1:34:18] the main thing was the flower
[1:34:23] why are we here the main thing is jesus
[1:34:26] christ
[1:34:28] and we our purpose here is to bring
[1:34:30] souls to the kingdom of
[1:34:32] god to reach souls for christ
[1:34:35] let's not forget the main thing
[1:34:39] we get so busy and i talk about that all
[1:34:41] the time we're having meetings this
[1:34:42] weekend i'm closed in just a moment but
[1:34:44] we're having meetings this weekend and i
[1:34:47] talk all the time about this but it just
[1:34:49] strikes me
[1:34:50] that when brother branham talked about
[1:34:53] the prostitute woman that come in and
[1:34:55] wash jesus speech you remember the story
[1:34:57] brother brahm tells the story
[1:34:59] he said that the pharisees were so busy
[1:35:02] with religious things that they didn't
[1:35:05] notice
[1:35:07] that he'd come in
[1:35:10] they didn't pay any attention to the
[1:35:12] fact that he was there
[1:35:13] and he was the main thing
[1:35:17] he was the main thing then he says this
[1:35:19] he said you asked him
[1:35:20] you invited him to come then worship him
[1:35:23] when he comes
[1:35:27] let's not let's not push him aside and
[1:35:29] rush through the service and rush back
[1:35:31] out
[1:35:31] let's remember the main things
[1:35:34] what is our life without god it's
[1:35:36] nothing
[1:35:38] what are all these things we spend all
[1:35:39] this time on without god nothing
[1:35:44] let's not forget the main thing let's
[1:35:45] bow our heads together
[1:35:52] lord jesus what could we do without you
[1:35:56] we couldn't live the bible says in you
[1:35:59] we live
[1:36:00] we couldn't breathe as the bible says
[1:36:03] that we breathe
[1:36:04] in you we live and we breathe we have
[1:36:05] our being
[1:36:09] lord we want to refocus tonight on the
[1:36:12] main thing
[1:36:14] to lay aside every weight
[1:36:18] if we can have to be temperate lord as
[1:36:19] paul was and in this chapter in
[1:36:21] corinthians and it just so struck me my
[1:36:23] heart is stirred tonight
[1:36:25] lord give us that hunger for souls
[1:36:30] i found where your prophet said this one
[1:36:32] of the main signs of the church has the
[1:36:34] holy ghost is full of the holy ghost is
[1:36:35] when they're
[1:36:36] reaching for souls and he said he said
[1:36:39] in one place that if the
[1:36:41] if if no one would come and pray with
[1:36:43] those that come and pray he said then
[1:36:45] ichabod is written across the door
[1:36:48] oh god give us a hunger
[1:36:51] give us a thirst for righteousness lord
[1:36:54] a hunger to bring souls into the kingdom
[1:36:57] of god
[1:36:58] a desire lord of heart
[1:37:02] bring back the new lord if we've lost it
[1:37:04] somehow
[1:37:05] just that hunger that we have for your
[1:37:07] word that desire that we want to be in
[1:37:10] the house of god
[1:37:11] maybe we still come but it's just become
[1:37:13] a duty oh god
[1:37:14] help us tonight it's so easy to get used
[1:37:18] to just laying out
[1:37:20] so easy to get used to just being like
[1:37:22] everybody else
[1:37:23] everybody else does it why not just why
[1:37:25] not me oh god
[1:37:27] help us tonight help me lord help me to
[1:37:30] have that fervency help me to be stirred
[1:37:32] up lord
[1:37:34] help me to be help me to be on fire
[1:37:37] lord for that purpose not to promote my
[1:37:40] own ministry but to
[1:37:41] to reach souls for the gospel for the
[1:37:43] kingdom of god
[1:37:45] i pray you'd grant it lord i it drives
[1:37:48] me to desperation as it did your prophet
[1:37:50] not
[1:37:51] to the extent that it did him because he
[1:37:53] had so much
[1:37:54] more responsibility than i do oh god
[1:37:58] you've given me more responsibility
[1:38:00] maybe than what i thought i would get
[1:38:02] god would you just let me allow me to
[1:38:05] fulfill that to the best of my ability
[1:38:08] don't let me leave a thing on the table
[1:38:10] when i get done i don't want to rust out
[1:38:11] i want to wear out lord maybe so with
[1:38:14] every one of us
[1:38:16] we may get older but we don't have to
[1:38:17] give up
[1:38:19] i pray you'd grant it lord i pray you'd
[1:38:21] put a fire under every one of us to
[1:38:23] reach
[1:38:24] our neighbors our friends our families
[1:38:27] the world is not okay it's not okay the
[1:38:30] way that it is
[1:38:32] help us to understand that lord and to
[1:38:34] show people where the shelter is
[1:38:37] before the world falls apart i pray
[1:38:40] granted now we ask it in jesus name
