the story lord you want to do that by manifesting your word in our lives and i pray lord that that would be done this morning i pray that you'd move me out of the way and just begin to speak to your people as only you can i pray that you would move over every situation maybe there'd be something on the people's heart this morning that i wouldn't have lord prepared but it'd be something they need lord i pray you'd help me to to go that direction to speak directly to their need i know lord i can't do that on my own lord under the influence of the holy spirit if you just move down and we know you anoint your word i pray god that you would do that today i pray if there's a sick person here this morning that they could be healed completely lord by your by your grace i pray if there's one that is in need of you lord that needs to come close to the throne of god i pray that lord you to help them to recognize their need and may they move close to the fire today lord and give up their all to you surrender everything to your word we pray we thank you for this service and for these people let me ask it now in jesus name amen amen you love him this morning amen isn't it good to be here on a sunday a sunny sunday morning after the weather that we've had and be able to come to church and worship god amen in the fear and admission of the lord you may be seated just for a moment i've got a couple things i want to say to you before we read the scripture it's good to have my cousin khalilah here with us today sitting back there by my mom it's good to have her these are my my second cousins here uh austin and dylan it's good to have them and uh i've got a ringing up here peter if you could take care of that and they're my goodness they can do just about anything and i'm thankful for that and their pastor by the wendell martin is going to be preaching for us in july as well as whether andrew glover in our meetings so we're looking forward to that and uh good to have family that serves the lord and but you know we're all of us are promised our family is that right we're promised that and so we believe that each one of them every one of them is going to serve the lord no matter how dark it may look right now and so we believe that it's good to have sister sister pat and his family got some visitors with us today it's good to have them and uh each one of you that came today and uh we want to be praying uh especially for the bailey family brother bailey's here this morning and uh i attended that funeral on on friday i should say that celebration of life you know she's you know has a much better life now than she did here but she was loved and brother bailey is going to miss his daughter being there with him and so be praying for brother bailey and for brother john and all of the family there that they would be comforted in this moment also brother david white is gone this morning they had another wedding shower back at millennia's place so they'll be back next week uh wednesday night probably but brother uh david also lost a brother and i drove out there this week as well to be with his family and and just be praying for them as well i believe god is merciful isn't he and so we always like i said believe for our family and believe that they made it and uh and i just saw the mercy of god in that situation especially with brother mark and and god's able to do that he's able to reach right down into the situation you think well how could that person ever be saved and then all of a sudden it just something happens and it just it sets up just right for them to make it amen i believe god does that for us listen if you're going to go to hell you're going to run across every every thing that god set up in your way he's going to warn you he's going to stop you he's going to put something in front of you and he even said you know we believe we're the bride but he even said the spirit and the bride say come and whosoever will whosoever will let him come and drink of the water of life freely amen aren't you glad to serve a god like that amen god bless you this morning i i know russia's been in the news we're going to the lord willing talk about that on wednesday night there's some uh special prophecies concerning russia and just kind of remind you of some of those things and and of course they've gone into ukraine we need to be praying for ukrainian believers and russian believers there's quite a few of them the russian believers have been under persecution for quite a while this message is banned in russia at this time and and because of some things brother branham said about prophecy about russia and and ukraine is being overrun at this moment and they just don't have they fought valiantly but they just don't have there's believers there's churches in those cities with believers in them so let's be especially praying for them would you do that and we don't know what that's like we've never experienced a war here on our country since the civil war it's been 160 or 70 years ago i guess now and so so that's a it's an amazing thing to be able to uh see that and see people hold their faith and still believe god and still believe the message of the hour but they're living it they're living we talk about the end times they're living the end times right now amen so let's be praying for them and i had just to kind of keep us in balance a little bit when we look at those things you look at those things say well is this the end time and it is it is the end time it's been the end time for a long time if we can say it that way but we're getting to the end of the end and brother branham said this about russia he said russia the reason russia come to herself she had to he said just like israel had to get in the homeland god had to drive israel back to the homeland for the trumpets and so did god have to drive russia up there in communism to do exactly what's been prophesied she would do so russia has been sleeping again for a while but you think why would they have to wake up now why are they all of a sudden so aggressive under under putin they're so aggressive because god wakes them up god does that for a purpose he allows them to be that way because they have a part in end time prophecy and so let's be praying that god's will would be done in these things and if you're not right with god now's the time to get right with god you don't have much time none of us know how much time we have well each one of us we could be taken off of here off of this earth tomorrow but especially in this time let's just be right with god let's just let everything out of the way old grudges old old things that would hold us back from being where we should be with god let's just get that all out of the way just serve god and believe god and believe his word because we never know what tomorrow holds amen amen god bless you today we'll deal with that some on on wednesday night let's stand together also next week i'd like to have our election we delayed it at the beginning of the year i'd like to do that i believe next week will be the first weekend in march let's do that next week for deacons just to re-elect our deacons and and trustees and and uh also we'll try to give you a just a basic financial report next week on what we've been doing with the offering money and the missions and things like that luke chapter 1 and verse 39 luke 1 39-44 and then we'll also read from first thessalonians 4 15 it says and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation surrounded and sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and then in first thessalonians 4 15 it says for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain how many want to be alive and remain so not just to be here but to be alive to be a living body of christ at the coming of the lord we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not hinder or prevent them which are asleep the lord himself should descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are what alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word this morning he may be seated when a baby is conceived it isn't long until you begin to feel signs of life now i know that when it comes to the supernatural birth the conception there's no emotion no sensation in the conception but there is you do begin to feel signs of life and when the baby's born you know that it's something that you know and and so there are signs of life that begin to show up in the in the life and in the body of a person when the when that baby is alive now elizabeth had been pregnant for almost six months and she was worried because she never felt the baby move and so the baby was as though it was dead in the womb she was afraid because there hadn't been no movement and if there was no movement there would be a fear that would come on the mother because she began to realize that that i don't know if this baby's alive because it's not moving because life always causes movement when you have life you move listen when a church has life it's not sitting still it has movement it may not be much but it's movement are you with me this morning and so elizabeth said i'm just a little worried because she'd had no life yet and but the random said you know the baby as far as she knew was dead he said the little john must have been dead in his mother's womb and she'd felt no life as yet and she was kind of worried because now life is always pushing the boundaries life is finding a way it has detectable movement even if you were sleeping you were moving yeah right a little bit there's a movement you see the chest rise and fall you you there's a little bit of air coming out and if you've ever been a parent and you know your baby's in there sleeping and they seem so still you walk in and many times i walked into my children and i walked in and put my hand on their chest or over their mouth to see that they were breathing because you know if they're alive there's going to be some breath there's going to be some movement there's going to be something there and the same thing is true of the holy ghost if there's a holy ghost in the church there's going to be some signs of life right if the holy ghost is in our families there's going to be some signs of life if the holy ghost is among us there's going to be signs of life and just like russia had to wake up and realize who they were in in prophecy they had to wake up israel had to wake up and realize who they were in prophecy america has to realize become who they are in prophecy but the bride has got to become who they are and there's got to be a people who raise up in the last days and actually step into their position and wake up and brother madame said what happened is the denominational people miss the awakening of the bribe then if the bride is awakened there's got to be some movement there are you with me this morning so there's movement there's a there's a there's a living movement in the bride now when when the water breaks brother branham says you don't have to do very much about it when the blood comes you don't have to do much about it but in order to get life in the baby you've got to give him a spanking make him yell out now he said you take a little some kind of a shock he said maybe he wouldn't have to spank him but just shock him a little the very idea of him being born sometimes will do it grab him shake him i remember when peter was born i'd never experienced that before and peter was born and and i'm watching all that happen and and for some reason they let us men in the room anymore i don't know why we're not doing any good in there but they expect you to be in there you know and and i actually had to sit down i was about to die just just watching it and and and here's the baby being born when peter was born he didn't breathe very much he didn't make much movement and so they were roughing him up i thought they were going to kill him because they were shaking him and beating him you still have to do that to wake him up in the morning but i mean they just he just didn't move very much because he had stuff in his lungs it was a very difficult birth and but but you know they had they were doing that for a reason and god sometimes listen to me church he lets us go through things and we wonder why have i gone through this over and over again what is this movement in the water why why is the water troubled why is the church troubled why is the nation's trouble why are these things going on because sometimes god wants to wants to see wants to shake us until we begin to move he's trying to get us to go somewhere listen we're not here for the duration we're not supposed to live for this world are you with me this morning we're not here to stay here we're not building kingdoms here but we're building something that will help us in the other world we're looking forward to an eternity that's coming and so sometimes he lets us be shaken he let us be shaken by kovid by by all the things that's been taking place why is he why is the world shaking today because he wants to see movement and i believe there's movement in the bride today are you with me i believe there's movement in the bride now brother branham says he don't he says if you don't start breathing spank him a little and then he yells out in unknown tongues like to himself i guess he said but anyhow he's making a noise and i think if a baby is born just by stillbirth with no sound no emotion that's a dead baby he said that's what's the matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children he said that's right they need a gospel spanking you see to wake them up to bring them to themselves so that god can breathe the breath of life into them hallelujah listen that shock that hearing the name of jesus and mary's salutation to elizabeth when the name of jesus was spoken for the first time and she began to tell the story to elizabeth when that was spoken that was the shock that brought john to life notice brother brown said just as soon as she said jesus the first time the name of jesus christ was ever spoke through a human lip the little dead baby in its mother's womb received the holy ghost and began to jump for joy in the womb of a mother and he said what ought the name of jesus to do to a born-again church oh my george we just realized who we're talking about i wonder sometimes when we sing and when we preach and and when we do the things that we do i wonder if the if what we're saying ever goes through our brain i wonder if it ever actually we actually realized when i speak the name of jesus i'm speaking of someone who's the alpha and the omega i'm speaking of someone who's all-powerful i'm speaking of someone who has no limits to his power i'm speaking to someone who can heal i'm speaking of someone who can say i'm speaking of someone who can take away every burden and say lay them on me i'm speaking of someone who died for my sins are you with me this morning it's not just something we say but i'm speaking of something real hallelujah what about the name of jesus he said due to a born-again church hallelujah oh it ought to stir us up just to hear about his name what he did for us when we sing songs like we sung this morning about calvary and about the about what he did for us on that day and how he became us so that we might become him it ought to do something for us because we're talking not about something that we heard about 2000 years ago but we're talking about a reality in our lives we've we know our life has changed we know things were different than they were before i'm not who i was i'm something different amen and it brings a glory into the church a life into the church when the name of jesus is spoken and exalted now the body of a baby is made up of different parts so is the body of the church different parts now i want to type that this morning in kind of maybe an odd way because i'm a little bit of an odd person but i want to type it maybe in a little bit of an odd way to the physical church building because if there's life in the church then you would expect things to move now and in the body of the church you know we know we are the body of christ how many know that we are the body of christ the rest of you i you know you just have to catch up with us but the body is christ and we are the body of christ now do you expect to see different movements in different parts of the body right you expect to see that now when i'm up here under control and as much as i can be but there's certain things that are mannerisms that's when i'm right there i grab my ring is actually what i'm doing make sure it's still there i have a when i got married i never wanted to wear a ring i couldn't take off and and there's a reason i'm claustrophobic it's not because i didn't i've worn this ring every day and every night since we got married almost 16 years ago but i always touch it it's just something i do involuntarily but the things i do under the control of my brain you expect my body to move in certain ways right if my brain tells me to walk over here i'm going my my feet will move in that direction right it's a sign of controlled life does that make sense it's life controlled you expect me to move if i just stood here and and completely still you'd think there was something wrong with me now that's true you think about it how much does a person move while they're preaching a lot because you you expect a person to you know somebody walked up to you and they began to talk to you and their face never moved and their mouth never moved and their body never moved you think there's something wrong with them right even though they were talking to you but there's some something's got to move right or you think that they're dead now so there's but there's different movements i don't expect my hands to move like my eyes do or my feet to move like my hands do there's different movements in different parts of the body now you could be dead and still move we won't hear any stories today but you could be dead and still move right now but watch now your movements wouldn't be directed by the head now i can prove that we used to cut chicken's heads off right if you've been out on the farm you know what that's like brother dan you told me some of them stories we used to do that and you take a chicken and cut its head off and the blood will spurt up where the head was i'm glad we're not eating very soon the blood will come up where the head where the head was and that chicken will run around the yard just like crazy but it's it it don't make any sense and so when you see somebody just going here and there and with no sense to their movements you say well they're running around like a chicken with its head cut off because the movement of the body is not connected to the head right and there are some movements that we do involuntarily but that's the movement of the body now in the body of christ the movement should be connected to the head that's why the spirit of the prophet can be subject to the prophets that's why we can still have church order and yet worship god right because the movement of the body is connected to the head we are not off on our own doing our own thing off on the side somewhere just just playing our own game but the movement about listen listen that's why it's so dangerous when somebody gets away from the church in the sense that they they begin to drift away and they begin to say well i'll just do my own thing and it's not because we want to control people that's not it at all but you got to work within a body if you're not working with the body if i'm walking around here my foot's just shaking on its own that's a problem right my foot's supposed to be carrying me somewhere are you with me this morning so the movement of the body ought to be connected to the head right now and brother madam said this about that about the body movement he said we got the same thing he said we stay with the word we live how many believe that today and shall live by every word but if we don't we die we spiritually die he said oh we can still make noise sure kick around and holler and carry on but that ain't living sure so something could seem to be alive now listen the pentecostal church runs the aisles i've been in some of their services where there's there's much more emotion than there is maybe in our services and and i'll be okay with a little more in ours to be honest with you i'd be okay with that but you know what it's not connected to the word the head right and you take the same maybe movements but you connect it to the head it's going to produce something right two people come to the altar one comes under the influence of a story about his his mother or something like that comes under that influence another person comes because he's genuinely convicted of his sin when that movement is because of genuine conviction what does it do they come to the altar and when they get down there something happens because the movement is directed by the head not this intellectual head but the head is christ are you with me now the head is not the pastor the head is not the deacons the head is christ the holy spirit so something that makes no movement though is dead period right if it's just not making any movement it's dead so well we're in a live church okay but you're going to make some movement if you are alive in fact alive you're going to be moving now and you look at the old testament for an example of that the priest when he went into the holy of holies he had a bell and a pomegranate on his on his robe when he walked in that that bell and pomegranate would move and the movement would cause the bell to ring and and when it when it did that they would know he was still alive right and if that stopped everybody held their breath because the priest was not moving as long as he was alive those were sensitive enough to the movement of his body that as long as he was alive that would still be there that sound would still be there listen to me church brother branham typed that over and over again to the church and he said if there's no movement if there's no noise the church is dead right yeah right now he doesn't do that just once he does that many times he said it this way he said i can prove anything that hasn't got emotion in it is dead so if your religion ain't got a little emotion in it you better bury it and get something you'd have to have a motion to be alive and i've told you before you've got emotion you may just not realize him you got emotion or you couldn't have bitterness against people you got emotionally you couldn't hate on people you got emotion or you couldn't or you couldn't sit there and talk about somebody you got emotions but i want our emotions to be used in a positive way if i'm going to express my myself and my emotions let it be a praise to god a worship to god a hallelujah a song in the house of the lord let it be something that'll exalt christ instead of something that tears down my brother are you with me now now the first place if you were like i said if you're typing into a physical church the first place you would look for signs of life if you were walking into a church is signs of life in the pulpit right that's the first place you look you begin to look for signs of life in the pulpit what do we expect from preachers are they to be intellectual teachers and you preachers just bear with me for just a moment i'm not trying to to preach at you but at myself this morning well i begin to think about this what do we expect from our preachers in hebrews 1 7 it says that he makes his ministers a flame of fire a flame of fire he's talking about angels but the minister is an angel to the church right now he makes his ministers a flame of fire in first peter 4 10 and 11 it says as every man has received the gift even so minister the same one to another so they're not all going to be the same but he said as good stewards of the manifold grace of god if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god in other words let him be confident in what he says right we don't speak us one way that they knew the difference between jesus and the scribes in the new testament is when jesus walked out there when jesus walked out there they said he speaks with authority he speaks with authority like somebody that knows what he's talking about why did he say that because because that he was different from the scribes he said well it could be this way it could be that way but we've have a voice of authority in our day right we've heard the voice of authority and we have to be a voice of authority if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom he prays and dominion for every and ever and ever now brother rudolph said every denomination has these seminaries hatch out a bunch of incubator preachers he said i always felt sorry for an incubator chicken it had no mammy so it never felt the warmth of a mother's love because it was born in an incubator oh he typed that to preachers they didn't know the the comfort of the holy spirit they didn't know what it was like to be in a move with the holy spirit they didn't know what it was like to be in revival it was an incubator preacher hatched out without a move of god are you hearing me now and that kind of a preacher is never going to move god's people why because it's just an intellectual understanding no matter how much it chirped it wasn't mothered he said that's the way these machines turn out clergymen sometimes don't know more about god than a hot and taut does about egyptian nights or rabbit knows how to put on snowshoes he said what we need is an experienced preacher now he's not talking about the length of time that they've been preaching but he's talking about a preacher with an experience go listen to he said what we need is an experienced preacher that's been on the backside of the desert until he stayed in that place under god until the pillar of fire come down before him like he did with moses and nobody can take that from him an experienced preacher yeah i don't care if someone's 16 years old but give me somebody by the officer that can stand there under the influence of the holy ghost and has known what god is like has met god for himself and his life has changed that's the kind of preachers we want not somebody to just give you an intellectual talk again brother brandon says what we need is an old-fashioned god-sent scalding religion that will scald that worldliness out of the church we need to come back to the holy ghost and fire back to the thing that burns out the dross brings the old-fashioned preaching back why are people today are trying to do away with preaching in the pulpit but a prophet said we want to bring it back bring the old-fashioned preaching back make heaven high and hell hot gun barrel straight we need that kind of preaching he said but you do it today your congregation will vote you out i'm so glad i don't have a congregation like that he said your congregation will vote you out he said sometimes good preachers are led astray by their congregation he said that's the reason i have no denomination i have one headquarters that's from heaven wherever he sins there i go whatever he says i say we don't want no do not listen i don't tell these other preachers what to preach they have to hear from god themselves we don't have a denomination he said i have one headquarters that's from heaven wherever he sins there i go whatever he says i say we don't want no denomination this church ever talks about denomination you've lost your pastor right then i wouldn't hang around it not one five minutes listen if there's somebody some in some other town some other place that can tell us what time to have church that's a denomination if there's somebody in some other town some of the place that can tell me what to preach on sunday or what tapes to listen to or what to feed the people that's the denomination i don't care who it is i don't have to preach it because the church down the road preaches it much respect as i have for brother wendell or or brother tim pruitt or donnie reagan or whoever it is i've got tremendous respect for them brother bill ivy i got respect for many men but i don't have to preach something because they preach it i preached something because the word it's true it's in the word and god it's inspired to me i'll study other men's sermons to preach the word study the word of god are you with me now we have one headquarters we should never if we talk about denomination i'll say amen to that if there's ever a denomination you've lost your pastor brother members said they think you have to have curly hair i'm so glad this is in the message they think you have to have hair curly hair and wear tuxedo suits and say oh man so beautiful all like this and be a prince he said that's a woman's puppet god wants men godly men men that can shake he don't mean men that can stand up here and shake but men that can shake something right by their words are you with me now men that can shake but today we want hollywood we want something that's desirable to the eye we want something that can speak so intellectually that he can let us sleep for five minutes on sunday morning so glad to see all these kids awake this morning and bright-eyed and taking notes but that's what people want somebody can let them sleep for five minutes he said we want something so intellectually he could let us sleep for five minutes on sunday morning he said god wants separators who will send her forth like a blaze of lightning this is what god wants to see a sign of life that god wants to see in the pulpit he wants separators to send her forth like a blaze of lightning condemned sin to the roots dig it out he said but we want our intellectual pastors most of people wants a whispering pastor somebody says yes theory god wants thunderbolts i feel mad sometimes i feel like i'm yelling at you but that's god wants thunderbolts not whispering pastures you find the signs of life in the pulpit if the church is alive where else would you find signs of life it wouldn't be just in the pulpit now we're going to move down in a minute you find signs of life at the altar not traditionally you'd have an altar in the front of the church let's look at that for just a moment signs of life at the altar let's go to malachi chapter 1 and verse 6. malachi chapter 1 and verse 6. you can turn there with me if you want this morning it's just i'm going to read several verses a son honoreth his father and a servant as master if i if then i be a father where is my honor if i be a master where's my fear said the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and you say we're in if we despise thy name you offer polluted bread upon mine altar so they are offering a less than perfect sacrifice aren't you glad your sacrifice is perfect but there was trouble at the altar because the people were not willing to get into the to the service and give their all to it are you with me this morning they were offering polluted bread and you say wherein have we polluted thee so the thing they were offering what wasn't what was polluted but it's the way and the attitude that they had when they offered it think about it and then they later because they had that attitude they brought the lame and the blind and everything else to the altar but now it's the attitude he said why where have we polluted thee and that you say the table of the lord is contemptible and that means actually to regard something as worthless you can take it or leave it right and so people today and i typed this to an altar because it's at the altar in the sense that people have regarded people have regarded this the the services that we have and the time that we have around the altar specifically and we'll get to the pew in just a minute don't worry but the part about the altar is that the altar has been despised in this day as something that's worthless it's not worth coming to it's not worth having a service when somebody's praying that we just want them to let us go so and we want to just move out real quick because the altar time is there but we should not despise the altar if i could just use a play on words this morning i know they were talking about an old testament alter them but we should not despise a new testament altar a place and a time for a sinner to make his heart right there's got to be a place for you where you make your heart right there's got to be a place he said brother ben but i feel so so condemned when i come to church but listen to me i hope you can hear me today there's a place of freedom there's a place that there's a place you can come to where the word doesn't condemn you anymore when you don't feel bad about those things and it's not because you're a good person it's not because of how you live necessarily but it's because you come face to face with that burning bush and that pillar of fire and you've literally given surrendered your entire life to god and he's come and forgiven you of your sins and washed all of the things away from you and you know that regardless you may still make mistakes you may have problems in your life but you've reached a place of assurance and safety and you can come with confidence to the altar of god oh don't you want that place today oh my don't you want that place don't you want to be in that place we should bring our best to the altar he said if you offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil if you offer the lame and sick i'll think about our attitudes now but the steward's going to preach tonight so he'll he'll preach his back happy but i just want us to think about it if you offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor and we can say it this way go give that effort to your boss will he be pleased with thee will he accept thee joel's boss might because he works for himself but the effort that you put into the house of god what are we doing here church and i don't say this to false your effort but to to see it continue to see it continue because we can get to a place where the preacher is preaching his heart out and everybody just sits there and watches i don't want a church like that i don't want to be a part of a church like that i want to see a reaction it may not be people jumping and shouting and running but under the control of the head there may be something a reaction there something that's alive something that moves in the in response to the word there's got to be something there if you offer something less than your best to god if you make church secondary if you say well i might go or i might not go what does that do how does god view that he said well if you offered that effort to your boss what would it be like so now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us this has been by your means he says will he regard your person saith the lord of hosts who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught now they had reached such a place that they wouldn't even close the doors in the church wouldn't even lock up unless they were paid for it think about it neither do you kindle fire on mine altar for not you know how we get paid many times i'm just going to preach i can't help it just stay with me this morning you know how many times we get paid we expect applause i know i got to a place sometimes as a preacher you get to a place where well nobody said there was a good sermon but that's not why i preach right i'm preaching to help people just put a fire under people and i my master is upstairs right he he's not he's not so concerned about whether people said it was a good sermon but whether or not the word was preached are you with me now and so they'd reach such a place they wouldn't do nothing unless somebody oh you're good man you're good man you you just man you just bless the people you just helped but listen i've always looked at it like this you know like simon i've preached that to you before simon was standing there on the side of the road and here comes jesus with a with a cross and he's carrying it and it's going up down the road and jesus reaches a place where in his physical body where he's so tired he's so weak that he can't go on anymore and he reaches such a place that he falls down and simon is standing there by the side of the road and he just happens to see the body of christ fall and he says what am i going to do and here a roman soldier compels him said you carry his cross that's what i feel like ministry is you're standing there and the holy spirit comes and compels you to go and carry the cross to pick up the body of christ when it's sweet not to be the one that gets the most applause not to be the one that gets has the most views on facebook not to be the person to pastor the biggest church but to be somebody are you with me this morning that could be a help that can do the things that nobody sees nobody sees who sweeps the floors nobody sees who shows up early and prays nobody sees who gets down by their bed at night and prays for the pastor and the musicians and the song leader nobody sees those people but god sees it nobody sees who gives sacrificially nobody sees many of those things but god sees it amen and he appreciates that so much he said i have no pleasure in in the things that you do because of your attitude towards it you want to be paid for it you want to be noticed for him oh god help us today i know we preachers get like that too many times but god help me i know i'd rather have somebody notice me than not notice me everybody would you don't want to not be noticed but that's not why we do it amen he said neither do you kindle fire on my altar for not i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles that's us this morning hey man he said in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts but if you have profaned it in that you say the table the lord is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible it's worthless you said also behold what a weariness is it and you're snuffed at it said the lord of hosts oh it's just church again i can't i don't even want to go it's not a problem with the church it's a problem with our attitude i don't care if there's a preacher that couldn't hardly stumble over two words or a singer and musicians that could barely play or no musicians at all it's the house of the lord it's the house of the lord and the house of the lord deserves my best it deserves my reverence it deserves my effort are you with me this morning so i appreciate i enjoy seeing some of our backups placed sometimes and some of the ones that don't do it all the time and i appreciate the effort our regular musicians put into it my we have a wonderful service but when we have backups and extras and things like that and they're able to play and and the preachers who aren't the pastor you know you all are providing for my living so i'm able to study and and go and and go and do and be there for people and pray for people and y'all do that you provide for me you provide well but these other brothers aren't compensated other than just an offering now and then for what they do but i tell you what that reward many times will be greater because what i do i do it by obligation does it make sense but many of you volunteer and i'm so glad that you do but i like to see the backups many times or something it's not so great maybe what they do but they got number one they got to learn and another thing is they're doing it from their heart not because somebody said oh somebody begged him to do it so many people excuse me but people act like they don't want to do stuff well i don't want to do it really what they want you to do is beg them to do it we should not have to beg people to worship we shouldn't have to beg people to come to church shouldn't have to beg people to play the piano or to play the drums or do whatever there should be something in your heart that cries out to god every day of the lord i want to be right i want to be i want to live for you what can i do if the body of christ is weak in some area let me pick up the cross carry it to the best of my ability because not everybody has the ability to do that he said what a weariness it is you brought that with which was torn and lame and the sick he said thus you brought an offering should i accept this of your hand saith the lord but cursed be the deceiver who hath in his flock of male he has the ability to do something beyond what he's doing and voweth and sacrifice unto the lord a corrupt thing i'm a great king saith the lord of hosts my name is dreadful among the heathen see god wants your best at the altar brother said we've gone off without the old time prayer meetings and the baptism of the holy ghost coming back until the fire is burnt low you can cry out and try to get people to the altar and they just walk up like they were almost dead a dread to come and then ask ministers to come pray with them oh why did he ask me for they get down there you can't hardly get them and they'll stand there just for a few minutes look up at you go back and sit down on their feet to me he said the fire has gone out something has happened listen what we need is a revival that sinners looking upon christ repent run to the altar with their hands up screaming for mercy and the whole church is the flame of fire with the glory of god so that must have been back in the 40s known as in 1964. brother branham didn't change that with the opening of the word he said i went to places even and the people who's supposed to be spirit-filled people and see altar calls made he said why you couldn't get people to go in with anybody to pray with him he said that shows it's ichabod the spirit of the lord has departed he said but when you see that seal and fire and longing long for human souls in brother branham's tent vision we've talked about it several times recently he had his vision about a tent and he saw in the he never said he was going to come back and preach in a tent that's something somebody else said but he did have a vision about a tent in that third pole vision and when he had the vision about the tent he also saw an altar call but he saw in the first place he said they didn't have an altar call if you go back to the original place where he tells the vision in in waters of vision in 1956 they had an altar call they were begging for money instead of souls listen if i'm going to be sincere about something let it be souls not money are you with me now if i'm going to care about something let it be souls not money they're begging for money and he said i just made an altar call it seemed like down at the altar now he's talking about later he said when i was down there i looked and there was hundreds of people standing around the altar weeping because they had accepted the lord jesus and they were just weeping out loud he said and i said oh that's more like it like that well their heart was in it they weren't just begging for money that's a denominational thing listen we don't have the money to operate we'll just shut down and we do we're not short on money don't get that in your head this morning we're not short on money but you see that if we don't have the money to operate i'm not gonna beg you for it i'll go get a job and provide for it myself and i believe god would provide are you with me this morning man listen brother bran talked about coming to the altar this way he said come with the determination come that you're going to stay to there till it's over stay there until god answers and vindicates this is powerful a man that believes in god can see the presence of god feel the presence of god sense the presence of god you believe in god today a man that believes the reason you don't feel the reason you don't sin the reason you don't know he's here is because you don't believe like you should but if you believe you can sense god now it's not always going to be there there's going to be times you have to believe and you can't feel him but there will be a time when you can feel him are you with me now you believe him regardless but because you believe him a man that believes in god can see see the presence of god feel the presence of god sense the presence of god and know he's here he is here to answer everything that he made promised for in this day then cry till you get it can we do that this morning hold on to him don't leave if you have to stay day and night god don't want his children listen here we go again is there a life in the altar is there life in the pulpit god don't want his children to listen to intellectual speeches he wants them to cry out to until the promise is vindicated hey man hey man well i'll sit back and wait and see what god does and then i'll react to it no he wants you to cry for it oh we're getting to it now there's signs of life in the in the pulpit signs of life at the altar there's signs of life in the pew not just in the pulpit in the altar but in the pew where is the life in the pew listen spiritually alive people worship it's just what they do no revival in history was word only none go back and find any revival in history it wasn't word only it was a word revival that produced an emotional revival it wasn't emotion only it wasn't just an emotional revival but the word revival produced an emotion in the people listen to deuteronomy 12 and 10 moses speaking to the people he said but when you go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that you dwell in safety then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause its name to dwell there this shall you bring all that i command you your burn offerings your sacrifices your tithes the heave offering of your hand all your choice vows which you vow unto the lord and ye shall rejoice yes moses is standing there and saying i command you to rejoice people say well i don't feel like it well that wasn't what he said you shall rejoice why because you've reached the land flowing with milk and honey you can rejoice in christ amen when everything's going wrong you can still rejoice paul said again i say rejoice so that commandment in the old testament and in the new testament you shall rejoice listen to me when you're playing the instruments you shall rejoice when you're sitting in the fuse you shall rejoice well it's a sign of life in the pew it's not just about being melancholy and and and deadbeat all the time and worried and i know there's times we're worried i know there's times you can't tell a grieving person oh be happy how you gonna tell a grieving person to be happy but even in a grieving man or a woman inside of their heart there's something even though they're grieving in tears they're flowing down their face but they're still worshiping god because they're saying lord i know you give and you take away look at job he lost everything but he said the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord what was he doing grieving and he was grieving but he was worshiping he was grieving but he was celebrating amen amen many times that's the condition of our life is such that that we get to a place where we can't hardly seem like say bring a smile to our face because of the things that we've been through and some of you have lost many many things in life and you've been through many many things but i believe you can raise your hand this morning and there could be a something in your voice in your eye this morning that you can say i still know my god is good even though i've been through the fire even though i've been through the hard times even though i've been through the times when it seemed like i couldn't make it another step i couldn't put one foot in front of another but i still know my god it's good amen spiritually alive people worship god respond to the word nehemiah 8-6 esther bless the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands are some of you all about to have a stroke aren't you amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground amen amen psalms 150 says praise you the lord listen it's the sign of life in the pew not the only sign of life but a sign of life praise you the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the sultry and heart praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs amen praise him upon the loud symbols huh these are the loud symbols you can't even hear that's the loud symbols the loud says he can't have drums in the church well the loud cymbals oh my praise him on the high sounding symbols that's that little one right there probably praise him on the loud symbols on the high sounding symbols i think sometimes we forget that we worship an almighty god listen there's nothing that goes on in our life and again i'm not saying that because i feel that i feel that god allowed me to have a i have a feeling for people i empathize with people but some of you been through things i can't empathize with you've been through things i i've never been through i don't know what that's like but i do know this god is still faithful he's still the same yesterday today and forever he didn't die he's still alive it may be hard the time that you're going through the the struggle that you're going through right now maybe just sit in church it's a struggle to even be there but there's something inside of you that's still rejoicing you're still praising god i believe we can have a good service and worship god and trust god even when coven rages outside even when war rages outside david said the war rages against me in this will i be confident amen he's hidden me in the shelter he's hidden me in the secret of his tabernacle hey man aren't you glad for a god like that today hallelujah you still alive this morning oh i'm going to start looking for some signs of life in the pew amen the bible says speaking to yourself that's that's the old testament say well that's the old testament let everything have breath praise the lord it's the old testament let's look at the new testament ephesians 5 19 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs three different types of songs and we'll go into that sometime i've done it before where we talk about the different kinds of songs because not every kind of song is the same and for the same purpose and we get in the spirit of the lord and sometimes the song will make you cry sometimes the song will make you rejoice and make you happy and that's a good thing because god allows us to have music good music spiritual music for that reason he said singing and making melody in your heart to the lord verse 20 giving thanks always for all things that's difficult that's more difficult than what i thought when i was a kid because i've seen so much more it's more difficult than what you thought when you were a kid because you've seen so much more and if your life has never been touched by grief you say oh that's that's easy in all things giving thanks i thank god for my job i thank god for my car i thank god for that i thank god for that wife he gave me i thank god for my kids thank god for my money in the bank but he said all things so you have cancer then do you think god for all things you never say thank god for the cancer but you say thank god that even during cancer i know i have a god who heals cancer in all things thank giving thanks always for all things you lost your job giving thanks always for all things god must have a better job for me are you with me now god must have a better job god must have i've lost some things i've lost some friends in my lifetime i've had troubles and struggles but god must have had something better for me god's got something better giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ listen brother brandon said this about he said well music's not supposed to make you feel good i'm just going to kill that devil this morning let's put it like that people say well music's not supposed to make you feel good it's just supposed to make you well it made brother random feel good it made moses feel good it made made david feel good when he danced to it music's not supposed to make you feel good listen but the brandon said you talking to a man he said i want to be sure you get that for me if you have a little tape put it on it for me special so my children want to hear it he said when i get get kind of get down a little low i hear that it makes me feel good and i've heard it said well music don't make you feel good it's not supposed to do that it's supposed to convict you there's times it's supposed to convict you there's times it's supposed to make you feel good to hear good singing he said billy i go in the office down there and he has constantly got them tapes of singing going all the time and i think it kind of helps him i remember going in brother billy paul's office at the in jeffersonville and looking and all over his office he had cds back then we had a thing called cds a little round disc you know we put in our car and played music on and brother billy paul his office was full of southern gospel music maybe i shouldn't tell on him like that but just full of it he just loves southern gospel music and brother branham told that on him back then he said i go in the office he's constantly got them tapes of singing going all the time he said i think it kind of helps him he said you know there's something about song that's got power in it we all know that he said we're aware of that he said see he said let's look at the army when they sing the songs and play the music do you know the approach to war in the army of god is first by music the singers went before the ark rejoicing and singing he said then come the ark and then the battle that's right so that's the right approach hallelujah sometimes you feel so bad because of the things you've been through you need to be made to feel good before you can hear the word and sometimes you need to be made quiet so you can worship and so you can hear the word it just depends on what you're going through but god knows god knows and he's able and that's why when we come to play when we come to lead singing we should pray because what you do is just as important as what i do we should pray we should seek god because it's not a last-minute thing it's something that is something that matters because there's in order to be signs of life in the church there's got to be a response to the music and the music needs to be right i'm glad for the music that we have and many times most of the time it's right and i'm glad for that i'm glad for that listen that's the right approach it's through singing where else would we look for signs of life now you think brother ben you're running out of places not yet not yet you see we don't just worship together we fellowship with one another and we have a fellowship although not every church does but every church has somewhere someplace or maybe the the the all the lot outside the parking lot maybe the mcdonald's every every place every church has some place where the people fellowship together we have a fellowship host i want to look for signs of life have i got a few minutes this morning we haven't been very long there's got to be signs of life in the fellowship hall oh it's getting quiet you said well brother ben i haven't been in there in two years or five years or whatever but there's signs of life in the fellowship hall i'm so glad to see some signs of life well i told you here before brother branham he said he talked about the holy ghost he said the holy ghost he said here was a rock he said he turned over a rock and there was a little seed had grown into a little a little flower a little lily and he screamed out he said father look at this amen what was it a sign of life and all that chaos and darkness the word was working and the word doesn't just work in the in the pulpit the word doesn't just work at the altar the word doesn't just work in the pew but the word works in the fellowship hall acts 2 42 the first thing the church did very early in the church the church began to fellowship it says they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine oh that's good brother ben they all had the same doctrine oh saying the same things that's wonderful and fellowship and in breaking of bread that's eating together and just standing there and break bread but literally eating together and in prayers i am pro eating together not just because i'm fat but you fellowship around a meal many times many times you fellowship around a meal i've been uh proud of some of you because you invite people over and you do things like that and and the erskins are new with us but they've tried to make their home a place of fellowship and i tried to make mine a place of fellowship some of you all don't ever get to come and i apologize for that but we've tried to work our way through the church and have different people over and you just got people over on sunday night and my wife may kill me for saying this but if you if you want to fellowship some on sunday night come to my house because we've always got something going on after church because it takes me a little bit to kind of get out of the service a little bit and so we usually have something going on at my house on sunday night but there's a reason why we do that because we love one another it's not because somebody get up got up here and told us to do it right but if there's got to be signs of life in our fellowship in how we treat one another look in first peter 22 122 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth to the spirit unto unfeigned and what that means is when you see somebody i see brother joe i don't have to say oh brother joe i'm so glad to see you i just love you and then walk away and say i can't stand that man that's feigned love right feign love woke up to brother austin and say brother austin i just love you you're just such a wonderful person god bless you man that guy's annoying he's 16 he's got a right to be annoying right but that's what that's what we do many times that's feigned love fake love he said see that you have purified your souls from what from malice from bitterness from hate you know obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently fervently amen with it put some effort into it love one another fervently hey man he said then the first thing you know listen he's talking about brother brown was talking about the fellowship our fellowship together many times it happens at the fellowship hall but wherever you fellowship he said the first thing you know when you started doing those things you let down the bars you begin compromising then the church began to get little clicks in among them it always goes together when there's a compromise in the word and listen if there's a moral compromise there is a compromise in the word it always goes together but when you have a compromise in the word then you have a compromise in fellowship it brings down fellowship he said the church begins to get little clucks clicks in among them and this one said you know the pastor is just so-and-so or the deacon so and so and the first thing you know you listen to that and that's the reason we've had so much trouble is because you begin to listen to the devil and get a snarl instead of listening to the gentle dove the holy spirit the dove of god that would lead you and guide you love you and bless you he said first time you get one of those little temper spasms because you've been listening to that that's right the dove flies right away he said well you know it's like little clicks will rise up in the church you know it's you pastors see they like they say birds of a feather but if we're born again brethren that's not the attitude to take i ought to be able to fellowship with every one of you know there's some of us don't have so much so many things in common we won't maybe fellowship together so much outside of the church but when we're here together we ought to be able to fellowship together as much with an old person as a young person as a middle-aged person as a person with children with no children why because we're all brothers and sisters in christ no clicks now you may in your everyday life there's people you know you got your kids in school maybe your kids are in school with somebody and they become friends because they're around them but that's the reason we come to church and fellowship here because we're all together and it keeps clicks from forming he said you know it you pastors he said you know it you pastors see they say birds of a feather but if we're born again brother that's not the attitude to take if we see something wrong in our brethren listen to this god help me this morning god help me many times i'll bring it up and i'm i i'm ashamed of myself for doing that i don't spread stuff around but sometimes just around the table i get so frustrated i'll get a phone call or a text and i say why do they do it like that why do people have because i have to deal with other places other churches other ministers and and not people here but just around i'll say why do they have to do it like that and i'll say that publicly and i feel bad about that because you know but the brown said if we see something wrong in our brethren let us just pray and keep it before god and love that man till we bring him right into the presence of god he said that's really the way to do it he said but brother bennett just don't make me happy well you need to check up on your experience i don't like being around people because of something that happened or something that's taken place you need to check you need to get that out because it'll become a habit i know things you don't get over things overnight but it needs to move its way out it needs to work its way out because if it never works its way out you always have less than what you could have in fellowship brother brandon said the pleasure of a christian is serving the lord at the house of god you don't have to sign up no cards you can't open the door quick enough you ever been to a one of these concerts i i've never been to a country concert or rock and roll concert i've been to southern gospel music concerts that's the only type of concert i've ever been to outside of just you know singing in church and them old people be there early we'll go through sometimes silver dollar city and then them folks will be there in their wheelchairs and in their buggies they'll be there at uh maybe some of y'all or some of them i don't know but but they'll be there in their little buggy little cart four hours before the singing starts and they're waiting in the heat and the sun and they're sitting there and they make sure they got there right when they open that they flood in and then they sit in the heat on hard benches for four hours to see their favorite gospel singer and it always amazes me i said them people have zeal why because that's their pleasure the pleasure of a southern gospel music fan is to be there when when ernie hoss begins to sing that's their pleasure the pleasure of a ball a ball fan they'll show up early in the day and they'll go all day drinking and crowds and when they finally get to game time they'll be sure they're in the stadium buy the best seats they can find and be right among the people and they're so happy and so and and they're making noise and glad to be there why the pleasure of a baseball fan or a football fan is being in the stadium that's where they're their happiest listen to me but the pleasure of a christian is serving the lord at the house of god you don't have to sign no cards you can't open the door quick enough they'll be there why it's their pleasure amen it's their pleasure oh let it be our place many times the world drags that out of us our bodies we don't feel like it it may not be the pleasure of the flesh but it's the pleasure of the christian amen many times you don't feel like it and your body will especially around church time you begin to hurt but the pleasure of a christian is serving the lord at the house of god i know some of you sometimes you can't come but you want to be here that's your desire and i see that in your heart and in your eyes and when you are here you really worship and i appreciate that because that's your pleasure i didn't have to sign you up for that but you're here if the members of the church love one another he said enough instead of putting little clicks and pulling away from the church he said brother if you love one another so much that it just hurts your heart do you got together again it'd be less fighting if we did that i uh i've got family i'm not able to be around very much khalil lives in oklahoma and we go to meetings when we go to meetings over there you know you're always busy doing stuff so they come over when there wasn't a meeting so we spent some time together and the boys and and i'm so glad to be able to do that but i got family i'm not able to be around much i'm around you guys more but you know what i miss you more than i do some of my family i got family that serves the lord i'm thankful for that because that's double right but you know how you miss the grandkids if you haven't seen them in a while you miss somebody an aunt or an uncle or somebody that you love you haven't seen them in a while oh how much more ought you to miss one another he said brother if you love one another so much that it just hurts your heart i can remember going to meetings as a kid just a little kid and when we left i felt so bad i thought oh i don't know when i'll see those people again i didn't remember what was preached i didn't know i was so little i didn't know what was going on but i love the people so much i want to be around the people that's the way we ought to be it just hurts your heart till you got together again that's the way it should be listen to me you see well but the people aren't friendly but the people are us if the people aren't fiddling the people are us that's the problem we put so much on a preacher standing in the pulpit and i've seen it people rush in and make sure they get their good seat and rush out because the pleasure of the people is hearing the preaching but the pleasure of the pleasure of the christian is to be is serving the lord at the house of god and to be together right if you love one another so much it just hurts your heart do you got together again that's the way it should be it's not about who's preaching it's about the word it's about the fellowship we have with one another he said oh god listen to this i'm closing in just a moment he said oh god if we have to take every miracle out of the church if we have to take all the pipe organs out and the plush pews give us back to that godly love brotherly love among the people and fellowship if we have to do all that take it back to that again what's he saying i'd rather have the fellowship than the nice piano it's a nice piano in austin but i'd rather have fellowship than the nice piano i'd rather have fellowship than a nice organ we've got a nice organ top of the line but i'd rather have fellowship than a nice organ we put i think pretty nice chairs in here for you but i'd rather have fellowship than the nice chairs are you with me now if we have to take every miracle listen i believe in miracles i believe god will do a miracle for you this morning if you'll ask him i believe in a god of miracles but if we had to do without miracles i'd rather do without that than do without love are you with me now we don't have to do without miracles but i'd rather do without miracles i'd rather have to take every miracle out of the church and have love take away the good preaching take or bad preaching whatever you think take away whatever it is take away all the sound equipment and everything else strip it there if i had love i'd be okay if there were people there that wanted to be together that wanted to worship god together that weren't just waiting the first chance they could get to get out the door but wanted to love one another wanted to be together if you could just have some people that really were in love with god and in love with one another what would you have oh church i don't you know this church i don't know if we may grow we may not i don't know what the future holds but i feel like the church will grow in numbers but only may we never lose the closeness of being able to look at one another and know each other's names and being able to shake hands with one another and being able to love and hug one another and being able to know if one person is hurting that the whole church is hurting with them oh god if we don't have that we need to do a checkup in our own hearts there's a problem in the fellowship hall there's no life in it john 13 35 jesus said this is the way the world's gonna know this is the movement that they'll look for this is not how god knows god knows who's his that's how the world knows by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another they're watching like you did the little baby in the crib they're watching the baby in the crib and the baby's laying there and they walk over and they lay their hands i've done this to melody many times when she was a baby lay my hand on her head lay my hand over mouth to make sure she's breathing because they'll lay so still and the world is watching the church not to see what doctrine we preach but to see if we have loved one for another that's right they're watching when we rush out of the church and go and never be around anybody they're watching but this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you have love one to another oh god help us today musicians go ahead and come i'm gonna close there's a story of a young lady walked into a fabric shop she went up to the counter and asked the owner for some noisy rustling white material the owner owner finally found a couple bolts of fabric that would work but he was puzzled by why a young lady would want that why would anyone want several yards of noisy material finally his curiosity got the best of him and he asked the young lady why she wanted noisy cloth most people don't want that and she said you see i'm making a wedding gown my fiance is blind and when i walk down the aisle i want him to know when i've arrived at the altar so he won't be embarrassed listen we live in a blind world if you really love people you want to put the add the frills the lace whatever's going to make noise onto the dress so that people that's our love for one another so that the blind can see when we get to the church that we love one another she said he's blind he can't tell he can't tell when i when i stop so as soon as he heard the noise stop he would know she was there oh my i think that works would you bow your heads with me as this morning i think that works for us as christians too now we know jesus isn't blind he can see us but i want to make enough noise by the word that i'm wearing i want it to make enough of a difference in my life that he knows when i'm walking and he knows when i stop he can hear the rustle of the fabric oh god may my love be like that lord let my let my the cry of my heart let it be like that so that when the world looks they wouldn't have to question whether i love god they wouldn't have to question whether we love one another because they can hear the fabric rustle oh god may we be like that heavenly father lord jesus i i know every heart that's here this morning there's something in them or they want to be like that maybe they don't know how they don't know what to do lord i pray that you'd move into their hearts right now may the love of the holy spirit move into the hearts of the people lord that's when that's when john began to leap for joy when he was filled with the holy ghost as the scripture said in his mother's womb oh lord may we be full of the holy ghost and may our muscles begin to move lord may our arms begin to move a certain way into the direction of that your headship may our legs begin to move a certain way under direction of your headship lord may our life begin to move and begin to produce beautiful music a love song lord that to to you so that you would know lord when we're moving you would know you could hear the noise i pray you'd grant it lord i pray you'd move into each one of our lives help us to love one another with a pure heart fervently lord may there be signs of life in the pulpit lord may we put every effort that we have into it signs of life on the platform signs of life in the altar signs of life in the pew and signs of life at the fellowship hall oh lord so you could be pleased and the world would know we are your disciples not because we said we were message people or we believed in a prophet but because they saw the love that we have for one another in a time of hate and a time lord when the world is at enmity one against another in a time of cain may we be the apostles of love i pray you grant that lord we pray we ask it in jesus name amen do you love him this morning amen let's just worship him a moment could you just lift your hands to him this morning i believe he's here if you've got a need the altar is open but
