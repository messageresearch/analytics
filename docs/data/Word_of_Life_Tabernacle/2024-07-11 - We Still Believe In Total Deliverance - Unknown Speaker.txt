deserve in our lives with our voices with everything we love you I commit this service to your hands we pray in jesus' name amen amen God bless you turn with me to Genesis chapter 15 isn't the Lord good to us tonight Genesis 15:13 I know I've been preaching a lot out of these chapters lately but I I just can't get away from it and we've been going back and forth Genesis 15 and 13 and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full I want to title this tonight we still believe in total Deliverance pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated when Moses came to pharaoh and said let my people go he was coming as the result of a commission that he'd been given at the burning bush where God spoke directly to him and he said uh he he said uh he said I will go down and deliver my people and but it was not an isolated event it was not an anointing that did not have a backing in Prophecy or in the word because God had already told Abraham he said your seed will be in bondage for 400 years he said but I'm going to deliver them and he said they're going to come out with a great substance so he doesn't just say they're going to come out but he says how they're going to come out he said they're actually going to come out with a great substance in other words they were promised a total deliverance from Egypt a complete deliverance from Egypt and I think we've been promised the same thing today we've been promised a complete deliverance and we we won't settle for anything less than that we don't want anything less than what God has for us in the hour that we're living we don't want to settle back and become Leo toan in our ways and lukewarm in our thinking we need to press forward and recognize that God has given us a great promise of total Deliverance in the hour that we live live in so we don't want to settle young people you don't need to settle for anything less than the very best of God's will for your life you don't need to settle for the permissive will of God in the age that we live in you seek the perfect will of God the perfect will of God for a marriage the perfect will of God for where you go to church the perfect will of God for the things that you you you have in life why because you you are able to do that in the hour that we live in don't settle for permissive will and say well I'll be just a good enough Christ CH to make me miserable no I don't want to be that kind of Christian I want to be somebody who possesses all the promises of God how many can say Amen to that tonight I want to possess everyone that God has for me I want to possess all of the promises so Moses come before Pharaoh knowing that God had promised a total deliverance and so in Exodus 10 God begins fulfilling his word by plaguing Egypt that was what he said he would do and they would come out with a great substance he said that Nation will I judge and he begins to do that but now Pharaoh attempts to begin to negotiate see because the devil's not just going to say well I'm whooped you know they they got me you got me it's 400 years the devil don't give up that easy but he tries if he can't get you to totally disbelief he tries to negotiate a settlement to make you happy but not give you everything that's yours to make you settle down and not really become all that God wanted you to be so in Exodus chap 10 and verse 8 and we've read this recently but I just wanted to go over this as we get into this tonight Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh he said unto them go serve the Lord your God but who are they that shall go so in other words he's saying okay okay you win there's been eight plagues nine plagues and it's okay you know you can go but he said when you go tell me who's going to go assuming they're going to leave some of them behind and Moses said we will go with our young sir and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the Lord now we're going somewhere we're going to the supper of the lamb and in order to do that we're going to go with everything we're going to have peace we're going to have joy we're going to have healing we're going to have the salvation of our children we're going to have joy in the house of God we're going to have the presence of God Among Us we're not going to settle for anything halfway we're going to have everything God has for us oh and not what you want in your life brother Gabe it's so good to see you and Millie back in church and brother Justin back T tonight in your family don't you want everything that God has for you don't you want there's something there the God had a picture in his mind of what you would be in this hour and and and he and he wants you to become that he's helping you become that and I just want to yield to him and let let the word manifest in my life right amen I feel like I'm I'm shouting at you tonight but I just felt like I I was passionate about this I want to get it to you in a way that the way I feel it tonight listen he said they'll come out with great substance and so what is Moses saying he's saying we still believe in Genesis 15:14 yeah Moses would believe that because he wrote it right it was revealed to him he said this is what God told Abraham you'll come out with a great substance a and so Moses uh is is saying we're not going to take a slightly doubted promise see again Satan's trying to get you to disbelieve the promise in its entirety but if he can't do that he'll begin a negotiation right and I would ask you which part of the promise are you willing to give up on and I would hope that the answer would be none of it right amen none of it you don't have to and and we read this quote here a couple Services ago but just to bring it back to your memory maybe read a little bit more of it he said that's the way the devil wants a Christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't you never forgive Jones but I want forgiveness I want a complete deliverance he says you don't have to give up you're smoking you're drinking you're lying you're stealing you're fault finding backbiting you don't have to give that up just join the church but Moses wasn't a compromiser right he wanted complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind I love that he said we'll take everything that belong bels to us when we go to Worship the Lord he said and that's the way the church ought to be he said we'll take righteousness we'll take Holiness we'll take the Holy Spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the Altar and I love when brother Brandon preaches this a total Deliverance in 1959 you'll find that the church just had a vote and brother brandom deals with that all through this sermon about the church having a vote and the church had decided to do something and evidently there was a whole lot of attention in the church she said could that happen in a church where a prophet uh was the overseer of that church and a pastor there would that happen that church sure it could yeah right because people are human beings and there was a lot of dissension in the church over whether they should build a new church or not and I'm glad we don't have that tonight right we don't have that problem yet but but but you know things like that happen things come up they put in new deacons new trustees and so brother Brandon was challenging them he said we don't want to leave anybody behind he said whatever the church decides we need to follow that we need to we need to put up get behind it and and support it he said let's take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group we'll leave nothing behind someone say nothing we'll leave nothing behind we'll take everything there won't be one hoof stay back here you know he said and people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give in don't you want to pray that way we ought to pray that way about these meetings we ought to pray that way about our children I'm going to pray in such a way that the devil have to give in Lord I'm not taking anything for granted I'm taking everything that you have given me sir now we have total Deliverance tonight through the blood of Jesus Christ that's how we have Deliverance brother brandom says all Jesus Works was complete everything was complete total delivered he totally delivered the leper from leprosy he to totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue see the gospel is not a 12-step program right it's not getting better yeah right it's overcoming it's not putting up with our sin it's becoming what he wants us to be it's being purged being cleansed from our sin so it's not a it's not just well if we if we treat them right and if we baby him and we we pamper them a little bit then they'll eventually become Christians you know that's not the way it works at all but a real there's something about somebody who's got a seed of God on the inside that that when that word strikes it it begins to grow and you could put concrete over the top of it that seed will push right up to the middle of it why because because there's a seed of God there and so we don't have to baby that we can just preach the word of God and it comes up and so he said he totally delivered the woman with the blood issue from her issue he totally delivered the world from sin when he died at the day of atonement do you believe that a total deliverance from sin he totally delivered every sin he delivered the church so there's no need for us to live under privilege right there's no need you said what my brother Ben you don't understand my situation there is no need for us to live in under privilege do we believe the words that God said or not right we're going to believe what God said there's no need for us to live under privilege there's no need for us to live in a defeated State because he defeated the devil and took all the principalities and Powers subdued them under his feet and they have no legal rights to rule over you yeah right now you wouldn't let somebody uh somebody take all your guns out of your house most of you wouldn't Harvey said amen some of y'all you never let the you never let the government come in take all your guns but we let the devil come in and just take whatever he wants well there's 's my joy but you know I'm I'm going through a hard time so I can't have that no he promised a total Deliverance you got a right to have joy you got a right to have peace you got a right and it doesn't matter what's happened in your life you still have that right to take what God promised you the promise doesn't change listen no matter how hard they they whip the Israelites no matter how much they put them under bondage no matter how many they killed the promise didn't change no matter how heavy the bricks were no matter how hard the work was no matter how hot the sun was no matter how horrible a condition they were in for the Joe the promise still didn't change and I'm here to tell you tonight no matter what the devil does in your life no matter how hard he makes it no matter how stressed out you are no matter how worried you are about what's going to happen tomorrow the promis has never changed he still said I want to bring a total Deliverance to your life I want to help you I want to make you what I want you to be right do you believe it tonight yes amen hallelujah we are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost we don't have to have the devil dictate to us right all right I've told some of y'all a story I may have told it from the pulpit I don't remember but I come up here one time and and uh there was a a guy that was walking down the highway and he was actually walking up the highway walking up towards uh to the north but he' stopped here on one of our benches and I was ready for him to move on and I said something about it he'd been here a while and and he said uh he said well he said I would he said but I'm just taking a break he said I just live over here about five miles away and so I said well I'll take you home and so he uh I he got in the truck you know and my truck isn't always clean on the inside sometimes and I but it was pretty clean that day it was pretty good and and it but it had a few papers around maybe a Coke from Sonic or something like that and he he gets in that truck now remember he don't have a car he gets in my truck he said he said you know I always put a trash bag in my truck I thought well that's a good idea but you're getting a ride for me sit here tell me how dirty my truck is you realize what we let the devil do to us that's ridiculous isn't it we realize what we let the devil do to us he gets in the ride with us and says well you know you know I you ought to do better you're not much of a Christian well he's not much of one either he said well you might go to hell well he's definitely going to hell right you're not going to make it well I know you're not going to make it we don't need him in in our lives dictating the terms to us and telling us what we can have and what we can't have no we need to have a total Deliverance in our lives he said Christ delivered us total Deliverance delivered us from evil delivered us from sin delivered us from Habits delivered us from Talking oh there's a Deliverance right there delivered us from blacku guard he said whatever that is delivered us from all kinds of smudy things he totally delivered us and put us in his holy hands aren't you glad for a total Deliverance today a complete total Deliverance he delivered our sickness he delivered us from sickness for we have an abstract deed to that for he was wounded for our transgression with his Tripes we were healed he is our healer if you need healing tonight he is your healer amen the same God that promised total Deliverance to Abraham promised total Deliverance to us I want you to understand we're not living in the age of a partial Deliverance we're living in the age of a total Deliverance we're living in a Rapture age what that means is that there's a Rapture on and and one of these days our bodies are going to change and and it's going to be a total change a complete change we're going to this body is not going to stay like it is not one cell will be left unchanged praise God for that right not one Incorruptible cannot inherit Incorruptible so there can't be one corrupt oh God not one bit of DNA will be left unchanged right it'll be changed from the natural to the supernatural this is the age of 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all someone say all we shall all be changed verse 52 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed just as real of a promise as the one that said you'll be in uh Egypt for 400 years but you're going to be delivered with a great with a great Deliverance amen amen we still believe in the Rapture how many believe in the rapture we still believe that God is is uh is working among us and one of these days our bodies are going to be changed we still believe in restoration right that we have been restored according to Joel 2:25 I will restore to you the years that the Locust ha eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the Palmer worm my great armony which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed what what is he saying he's saying you're you're going to be restored we believe that happened in our day yeah we believe that's more than just a promise it's a reality we believe it's time to go knocking on Pharaoh's door right right say let my people go because this is the hour of restoration now if we were to be restored what would we be restored to we'd be restored to Jude three where he says I I exhorted you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints so we would be restored back to the faith it was once delivered to the Saints what faith is that brother BR says it's the same one that come down on the day of Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's manifested today from glory to glory to glory right remember Paul says we're all changed into that same image from glory to glory and brother brand picks up on that and he says it's from one age to another from glory to glory but they could see partially in Luther and partially in Wesley and partially with the gifts in Pentecost but now we see him face to face now look we've been changed this isn't the age of the stalk this isn't the age of the tossel this isn't the age of the hus this is the age of the wheat coming back again the original grain how many know that the original grain so that original grain that Original Seed is a restoration back to the one that went down into the ground he said it's back to its original seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost with the same signs same wonders same baptism same kind of people acting the same way with the same power come on the same sens all right it's from glory to glory right he said and the next will be changed from this Glory into a body like his own glorious body where we shall see him right we still believe that Malachi 4 was effective behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn listen there's no ambivalence about it there's he might turn maybe if they if everybody cooperates right that's not what he said it's just as oh my it's just the same way he told Abraham he said your seed will be as a Stranger in a Strange Land but after 400 years they'll be they'll come out with a mighty hand right there will be a complete deliverance and in this hour what did he say he said they he he said the heart of the children will be turned to the heart of the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse he shall turn yeah now watch he said brother brand said now we are promising Malachi 4 but the same system he always did as prophets that we would be restored back to the original Faith oh oh my back to the original seed back to the seed like it began on the day of Pentecost back to the same Doctrine on right word by word Power by power Spirit by Spirit the same thing just exactly like it was back in the beginning through S signs and wonders of the living presence of Jesus Christ after 2,000 years oh I believe a prophet's declaring something to us after 2,000 years he is still alive he said brother Ben what does that have to do with me listen if he's alive he can he's alive when you need him he's alive in your job he's alive at home he's alive when you're struggling with your children he's alive when you feel like you can't make it anymore he's alive when you get down to your lowest moment of Life he's still there young people he'll be there for you and with you he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he's still alive after 2000 years a prophet stood here and declared he's still alive didn't just say it but he proved it yeah right are you with me so far so that same Doctrine same power Same Spirit after 2,000 years he's the same yesterday today and forever we still believe yeah in Mark 16 yes go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature we still believe in Acts two right when they staggered out like drunk men tongues of fire separated on each one of them we still believe in that kind of an experience right we still believe God's God does that sir we still believe in 1 John 1:7 you know how much we believe we believe in all of of it but let me just read a few things that we believe we still believe 1 John 1:7 if we walk in the light how many are walking in the light tonight W boy that's almost total participation right there if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another oh we we can stop right there and preach listen the the scriptures declare that we would have Fellowship one with another yeah right and brother Brandon back set up and said if God is in your heart you'll want to be there every time the doors are open I realize things keep us out of church sometimes I'm not preaching about that but there'll be a desire in our heart to be with God's people there will be a desire to fellowship with God's you're not going to sit off by yourself Serve Yourself communion that's not what the Bible teaches right we still believe amen if we walk in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from how much sin all sin all sin amen we'll have fellowship with one another and he cleanses us from all sin we still believe in Mark 11:23 huh where he said verily I say unto you whosoever shall say to this mountain this mountain say what mountain is that brother Ben whichever one's in front of you yeah whichever one you happen to be facing at the moment yeah I didn't know if you look on certain Maps do some of these Hills have names did you know that some of these Hills Hills have names this one over here is called bigger's Hill I don't know where they got that name somebody just gave it that name there's Hills all around it's got names oh but I'll tell you this it don't matter if they're named or not which one can you overcome the one you're standing in front of the one that's in your way that's the one you speak to amen little or big that's the one you speak to be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he sayth shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever ever he saith that was manifested in our day we still believe and had he right spoke the word right after William brandham come there and talked to her and told her those things and and she said it's nothing but the truth and the presence of God moved down and she said it's nothing but the truth and he said you can have whatever you ask for and she asked for her children we still believe that that happened don't don't we we still believe it we're not going to take a partial Deliverance or or say well maybe it didn't really happen that way we believe yeah right are you with me now yeah we believe that he shall have whatsoever he say we still believe in Revelation we believe that God come down and opened the book in our day we believe in Revelation 10 1-7 we believe the book has been open we believe that when seven angels formed a cloud on Sunset Mountain fulfilling Revelation 10:1 brother Brandon was sent back to Tucson to preach the Seven Seals and we don't believe that he has to preach anything else I'm just speaking for you tonight but I know I know this is what you believe we don't believe he has to come back and preach anything else why because we believe we got a total Deliverance he was sent back to Tucson to preach the Seven Seals we still believe when the seventh Angels sounded the mystery was finished why the Bible said it would be the book was open we believe the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals brother said when those Seven Seals was open that opened up the entire Bible the Seven Seals was seal with seven Mysteries and in these Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it again he said but since the opening of those Seven Seals them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book yeah do you still believe it church do you believe it's a total Deliverance it's a completely new book it's an open book oh my oh my the Revelation I know sometimes you think well that's too deep for me I don't know if the seals are open or not you need to understand that the book is open let me tell you why because anything that's closed or or that you say well I that's just too deep for me I can't understand that the devil can attack you there right the devil come after you there but there's a people on the Earth today who believe the book has been open and because the book has been open all the power in it been released all everything that was written for our day can come to pass are you with me now yeah so it's important to believe the book has been opened since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book it's the things that's been hid as being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen of the earth that we might see and understand these things oh the devil trying to tell you you can't understand it but it's not really that complicated because it's not a mystery anymore it was a mystery yeah that's not a mystery anymore that we might see who's he talking about that's me I identify brother steart I identify with that that me I can see and understand these things not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up right it's the word of God made manifest proven that it's right proven not by science but by God that it's right again we still believe this don't we again he said the very day when this messenger not when he starts on when he begins to declare his message the first poll healing second poll prophesying third pole the opening of the word the Mysteries revealed no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way the prophet can be Vindicated is by the word and remember you know if the book's not open the prophet hasn't been Vindicated yet because this Prophet was to open all the mysteries of God so if the book's still closed the prophet's still not Vindicated but if the book is open the prophet's been Vindicated amen hallelujah no notice he he said he'll turn the uh he said to reveal the hidden truth been sealed in the word he told us this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals that's just as plain as you can preach it right he said it will be these divinely revealed it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers so if we believe that the book is open then we believe the what has come the Original Seed has come and has been restored back and listen if it was just meant for brother brandham why did he have to preach it right why did he spend the last three years of his life preaching these things if we weren't able to receive it sir but there's got to be somebody on the earth that can receive it there's got to be somebody we still believe that the church was totally delivered from dogmas and Creeds into the blessing and the liberty of God yeah we still believe the book has been open and if the book is opened we will not leave here a week cast off right depressed halfway dressed are you with me now we will not leave here A bunch of people that have not received any kind of Revelation wondering whether we're going to make it or not we will not leave here at just a dwindling man bunch of people that don't know anything about the message we will leave here as a bride fully dressed the bride has made herself ready amen we will not leave as someone who is just uh uh has has not heard a clear Voice or a clear sound wondering what they believe we will leave here having the word in our hearts we will We Still Believe We Still Believe in a bride that has made herself ready we still believe in a Perfect sinless Bride not one word failing anywhere that's a quote go look it up not one word failing anywhere we still believe in that kind of bride now I know you say brother Ben you're crazy you're fanatical no this is the truth yeah right and no amount of Pharaoh's negotiation can change that yeah right and he negotiates with you every day try to get you to disbelieve some part of it say well you don't have to do this you don't have to do that you you got to settle you got to settle life's different now than it used to be no we still believe in a complete and a total deliverance we won't leave one hoof behind are you with me now we still believe that he is the word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled man in faith takes that word into his heart and places it upon his lips it's the same as deity speaking most of this St I'm saying is quotes but I just don't have time to go through all the quotes we still believe that a man can live so close to God till the devil don't know what to do with it come on Hallelujah the devil tried to kill you and he just can't do it the devil try to bring you down and you just can't do it the devil try to make you depressed and he just can't do it that's the kind of Christian I want to be I don't want to be a weak halfway kind of kind of person you say well I am weak well it's time to get strong then this hour let the weak say I am strong are you with me now we still believe in a complete deliverance we still believe the power of God can so change a person here at the altar that they can make him a completely new person in a moment we still believe that and if a person has been changed their attitude changes the way they the way they deal with people changes the way they deal with the church changes and something about it there's something about them that's different than what it was we still believe in a changed life right and it'll be evident you won't have to try to convince me that you're a Christian or convince somebody else are you with me now we still believe in a good oldfashioned sky blue skin sin killing religion right you ever heard brother Brandon say that we still believe in that we still we still believe we need preaching that makes Heaven high and Hell hot Gun Barrel straight right we still believe that we still believe the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness we become sons and daughters of God by confessing our sins and accepting this Blood no matter what church you belong to and we believe that with all of our heart amen we still believe in screaming shouting and speaking in tongues say well we don't want that well that's the modern Church doesn't want that that's just identifies what church you're part of come on church we about have some meetings I get so tired of people say well it's just Pentecost no we've got a open book or something real we got something to shout about and not everybody's going to shout and run the aisles not everybody should but I tell you what if if there's something in your heart it begins to rejoice and bubble over because you feel the presence of God and you ought to be free to do what God has dictated for you to do we believe it'll be in order we still believe in church orders yeah but we still believe in screaming shouting and speaking in tongues yeah right you see brother Ben you still believe in tongues I thought you were against that no sir I believe in it I just believe it'll be in order and I'm not willing to negotiate a settlement say we got to be like Pentecost no we don't have to go back to Babylon we don't have to go back to confusion to have the presence of God in our midst we still believe that God's able to do what God does and we won't we won't sit here and try to Manu facture it we'll we'll just let God do what he does see we don't want to be identified with the modern Church do we he said the modern Church see if you say well I don't want any of that screaming and shouting and tongue speaking well then that means you agree with the modern church because the modern Church doesn't want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young and around her she don't want any them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah said why such a child would it mean medely put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches why they throw her out right quick why you letting such stuff as this go along but you don't want none of them screaming hollering this is still a part of the message yeah blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her in her educated ethical scientific Society Church she belonged to here she can't have it so she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth that's why some people are so scared of the moving of the presence of God they're so scared of the move of God because they're afraid of what it'll do to them and what it'll make them give up Sir because the presence of God does more than make you scream does more than make you shout but it'll make you live right are you with me now if it's received in the heart and not just on the emotions look he said that's the only she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church joining and creedo bobbed hair painted face no such thing as that in all of it you don't find that in the word of God you find an oldfashioned you still believe in the oldtime religion right brother B we don't have a new religion he said we have an old case or new case of the old time religion because they were shouting even before time began in the mind of God we were shouting the sons of God shouted for Joy yes and he said you don't find that in the word of God you find an oldfashioned Sanctified Sanctified that's the key to your screaming and you're shouting and you're running is to make sure you live just as high as you jump right he said we believe in oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born in the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting praising God yes we still believe so well I don't see much of that don't change what you will what you negotiate don't don't start to negotiate it away hold out for the promises of God right that's why people end up in terrible situations where they try to make themselves believe that somehow God has spoken to them to go against the word it's because they've negotiated away the perfect will of God in their life we don't want to do that we want what God wants for us I've heard people say well brother brandom only preached that at brother Moore's Church to make the Pentecostals happy well what can you believe but you know what it is it's an attempt to negotiate huh but I want to be like Moses and S said let my people go and believe all the word not everybody's going to run do all speak with tongues no do all shout fact tongues is the least of the gifts do all do those things no but I still believe it's there all right I still believe it's part of the church huh how many are with me tonight we still believe in a total Deliverance a a blood that can cleanse from sin and take it away as far away as from the East to the West Amen brother Brandon preached this at Jeffersonville just in case you care where it was preached at he said today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups has tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion see it just don't stand up according to their scientific theory he said I would like to ask them this what makes them change it's a good question isn't it what makes makes the drunker stop drinking what makes the prostitute cease her evil life what makes the cancer and the diseases depart from the people and the deaf dumb and blind and the dead to raise up explain that is that emotion it has emotion with it certainly anything that's alive has emotion anything that doesn't have emotion is dead excuse the expression he said I think we ought to bury some of our emotionless religion then because it's dead it has no emotion to it any religion has not emotion should be buried because it is emotional he said Jesus when he entered the city the children and all of them all of his friends crying hosan his friends were crying out all his enemies were crying out crucify him but his friends Cried Out hosan Hallelujah I want to be one of his friends don't you don't you want to be a friend of God Amen he said if they hold their peace he said those religionists of that day couldn't stand it was too emotional he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something must cry out because life was there oh I want life among us I want life among us I've told people before I I I don't want I don't want over emotionalism I don't want to see Pentecostalism run rampant but I'm scared to death of being dead all right there no life at all when there's a when there's emotion and and things happening in the church look it could be wrong it could be right but being Dead's never right all right right we still believe in Fellowship among Believers we're fixing to have some fellowship bunch of people coming I I just want that to increase brother Ben why do you want that for the size of the crowd no I want that because I realize how important it is for us for me and for you to fellowship with people we don't normally see that's right and you can't fellowship with people on Facebook not like you should I there's some amount of Fellowship there but not not real kindred Fellowship where you feel somebody's Spirit right and sometimes in coming together like this we break down walls and I've had people testify to me from other churches that come and said we've been told this about your church or we've been told this but we went there and we found that it was just you just wanted to serve the Lord and you wanted wanted people to be happy and you wanted to promote the message and that's what we want and so we find out we're not that different right we still believe in Fellowship yes we still believe in Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more you see the day approaching now it we've always limited that to one Church in my mind I've always limited that with not forsaking the assemblying ourselves together that means show up on Wednesday night right and that's the way we preach it a lot of times but Paul didn't limit it to one church he never said Let the church at Ephesus come together and let Let the church at at Corinthians come together and I'm sure they did whenever they could but he said not forsaking the assembling of ourselves and I take that to mean whoever can whoever is a Believer and has the ability to not everybody's able to come to a meeting so we'll have one here so some people can still participate in a meeting maybe you could never go to another state and participate in a meeting but you can participate in one here what is that Fellowship it helps you Heen listen Paul didn't limit it to one church and so I say when you have the opportunity assemble brother Brandon when he was at Tucson Tabernacle right towards the end of his life he talked about how he used to have to go to Jeffersonville and let everyone listen in on the telephone hookup I know they're promoting that today as as being the the end thing so well we've restored the telephone hookup and everybody just sits at home and listens to tapes but that's not what brother brandham said he he he said it used to be that you had to be spread out go listen to it he said' it used to be that we had to just have you in a telephone hookup he said 'well we don't have to do that no more God gives me a message I can walk right here to the pulpit and preach it and feel free to do it so brother br's elevating brother Perry's Church having an actual church over the telephone hookup yes sir right he said I can walk right here to the pulpit and preach it feel free to do it and I believe by that that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church now this group of people all right there's a blessing in that church if just stand by it you say well I don't understand everything that goes on just stand by it just stand by it you won't understand everything that goes on you may not agree with everything I preach but if I if if if you believe that God is here if you believe that we're preaching the word and you can take a little cherry out of it or a little pit out of it and spit that out but if you believe I'm preaching the word let's stand together let's stand for this church because it's more than me it's more than me it's people that have given their lives to see that Hardy Arkansas that there was a lighthouse in Hardy Arkansas right some of you have given your incomes and your lives and everything else over years to see that there was a church on this spot let's let's get our put our shoulder to the wheel get behind it he said let's speak not only that he said but let's go out and see if we can't get others to come in let's speak to others everywhere speak to them about our church and what it means what our church he said we're here we want you to come bring in strangers I'm sure it'll be good for all of us see we have a building which we are thankful for we're thankful for this place GA together but the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands for Heaven is my Throne Earth is my foot stol where is the place of my rest but a body hast thou prepared me and we are a body of Christ so as we move from one building to another building now if you know anything about the history of the message what's happened buildings have sprung up people sprung up different places different groups different bodies of Believers he said we moved from one building to another building I believe in bringing our messages he didn't say just my messages he said our messages we'll come down and have healing services and anything the Lord reveals to us to do we'll have it right here in the church until it swells out so big you'll have to take it somewhere else and somewhere else until Jesus comes I say let's let's let's believe what a prophet said let's fellowship with everybody we can fellowship with there's plenty that we can't right two can't walk together unless they be agreed but let's make sure that what we're disagreeing on is actually important my grandpa used to say we can't all be right but we could all be wrong a lot of Truth to that see Jesus is here do we believe that tonight I'm closing in just a moment a lot of folks we want to try to have a prayer line this year and we we will if we have room a purpose to do that if we just have the room to be able to do it but I guarantee you all these folks who don't believe in prayer lines if brother brandom come back and stood here every one of them would have a prayer line right you think they'd keep brother brandom from having a prayer line in their Church oh we don't believe in prayer lines until brother brandom comes back right and then some of them aren't they're not return Ministry people but if brother Brandon was standing there they would have prayer lines well don't we believe Jesus is still here he's still here so he still works in prayer lines he still works by the preaching of the word he's still heals he never left oh my and what I want to do I I want to stand for a total Deliverance for a complete deliverance until we as message people start to act like children of God until being message people is not a pejorative anymore are you with me now let the world call us what they want to but the fact that we're message people I think there ought to be something in us that yeah I I identify with that that's not a bad thing I believe it's a good thing you say Well it hasn't been well let's change that then let's let's stand for a total Deliverance a complete belief in the message of the hour amen what are you going to do he said when you get all that group together right where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest that's what Moses stood for he said I want all the group together not one hoof to be left behind and brother BR said what are you going to do when you get all that group together yes oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rap Rapture will go when it knows what it is we put a lot of work into this meeting I tell you what I hope we don't have to have it I hope the Rapture comes before but if it don't we'll gather on Sunday for another taste of heaven and Sunday night for another taste to heaven and next Thursday for another taste to heaven with a few more Believers we may not be able to bring the bride together around the world we can do our part in our area to see a total Deliverance we don't want to leave one behind we don't want to compromise on any promise of the word let's believe for a total deliverance we still believe musicians go ahead and come we still believe in eating the entire book what did he say in Revelation 108 after the seventh angel had come with his message the mystery of God had been finished he said the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth brother brand said that word has to come to pass it's God's word that's what Moses felt when he stood there he wasn't just going on what had happened recently although that had changed him and made him able to stand there it he had to have a burning bush experience but he wasn't only looking at that he was looking at what God had promised God promised him that after 400 years they would be delivered he said that word has to come to pass it's God's word plant it in your heart if you want to go in a Rapture how many want to go in a rapture I know that we all do plant it in your heart if you want to be Christians genuine place this word you said I I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet and the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed I say let's stand for a total Deliverance let's if we stand before let's stand together if we stand before Pharaoh let's stand for a total Deliverance I will not accept a partial Revelation I believe in the opening of the word I will not accept a partial healing I believe a Rapture is coming I will not accept just a partial deliverance from denominationalism I believe in a complete total Deliverance by the message of the hour let me stand for that you young people stand for that you've got an experience with God some of you older young people I know you've had an experience with God God you stand for that don't let the devil talk you out of what you got you stand for if you have to stand by yourself you stand for it till Mom and Dad catch on fire stand for it till the church around you catches on fire stand for it and Believe It Believe in a total Deliverance if it doesn't happen in my generation it'll happen in your generation or it'll happen in the next Generation but there's coming a day when we will not all sleep but we will all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye let's stand Before the Throne of pharaoh the
