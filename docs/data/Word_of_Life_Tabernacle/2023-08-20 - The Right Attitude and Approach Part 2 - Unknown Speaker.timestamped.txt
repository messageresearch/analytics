[41:47] that's all the
[41:49] morning and we'll take just a minute
[41:51] make a couple of announcements before we
[41:53] read our scripture this morning
[41:55] don't forget that fish fry on Saturday
[41:58] September 2nd I don't know how you could
[41:59] forget that but
[42:01] just in case they'll have some chicken
[42:04] there for the kids and stuff too for
[42:06] those of you adults who don't like fish
[42:07] so welcome to come to that and try to
[42:10] let brother Harvey or sister Jackie know
[42:12] if you're going to come we don't know
[42:13] how many to plan for we were going to
[42:16] have a baptism today but the the sister
[42:19] didn't wasn't able to come and but I
[42:22] appreciate brother Robert Smith
[42:24] witnessing to his co-worker and uh I
[42:27] believe that that'll bear fruit brother
[42:29] Robert and it'll be a blessing to them I
[42:32] you know we just live our life that's
[42:34] the main way that we witness is just by
[42:35] living and just by being who we are and
[42:38] people see that's a Christian and and
[42:40] that's what we want to do more than we
[42:42] don't want to push a Doctrine on anybody
[42:43] that's not our our desire our goal we
[42:46] want to just live and and be Christians
[42:48] and love people and and be a part of our
[42:51] communities I've never wanted to be
[42:52] hidden but we want to be a light but
[42:54] Jesus said a city set on a hill it
[42:57] cannot be hit he said you don't put a
[42:59] light a Candlestick under a bushel so
[43:01] bushel basket so we're thankful that
[43:04] brother Robert was able to witness to
[43:06] his co-worker and I pray the Lord will
[43:07] just work in that situation but the tank
[43:10] is filled if anyone needs to be baptized
[43:12] wants to be baptized we'd be glad to do
[43:15] that for you today
[43:17] um brother Stewart's going to be at
[43:19] Gibson this evening at work brother Ivey
[43:22] said Living Word Tabernacle preaching

[43:33] wonderful I'm still chewing on some of
[43:36] those things so brother Stewart I I
[43:38] might have to steal some of that at some
[43:40] point and so we're um I was glad to hear
[43:44] that and he's going over there and maybe
[43:46] wants to support him you're welcome to
[43:47] do that but the Joel will be preaching

[44:02] little bit special I'm always praying
[44:03] about ways that we can help as a church
[44:06] we don't want to be we don't want to
[44:09] tell people what to do that's not what
[44:11] we do this isn't a forced religion we
[44:13] don't we don't force things on people or
[44:15] tell them what to do what we want to do
[44:16] is give you the material that if you
[44:18] want to live according to the scriptures
[44:20] that you can because we want to teach
[44:22] you the things of God and and that's our
[44:25] role and that goes down to every area of
[44:27] our life well I've been praying about
[44:30] about for a while but something we could
[44:32] do for the couples and what we're going
[44:34] to do is have a for the Allen price is
[44:37] here with us and he's a wonderful uh
[44:41] Financial guy he's a bank president
[44:43] Community Bank president at fnbc and uh
[44:46] just uh done a marvelous job in that way
[44:48] I'm not good with money so for me to
[44:50] teach you about money I can tell you
[44:52] what the Bible says but but I have to I
[44:55] have to be reminded of things like that
[44:56] every once in a while so like we all do
[44:59] but brother Alan is going to be teaching
[45:00] a financial uh from the scriptures and
[45:03] things he's going to be teaching on
[45:05] finances in the afternoons starting at 1
[45:08] 30 next Sunday so I would encourage
[45:10] especially younger couples to be there
[45:12] and uh and listen to that if you can I
[45:15] know that's a little bit difficult being
[45:17] here all day but like I said you
[45:18] probably at the fellowship hall talking
[45:20] about that next that buck you're going
[45:22] to get or something like that anyway so
[45:23] if you can come and everyone's welcome
[45:25] but especially geared to the younger
[45:27] couples and the couples in general I'm
[45:30] looking forward to it because I need to
[45:31] be reminded you know to make a budget
[45:34] number one and and to stay on it but
[45:37] that's optional again we just want to
[45:39] provide you with the tools to be able to
[45:41] do what God has called us to do and like
[45:43] I said that's the way we live our lives
[45:45] is to just be Christians not to tell
[45:48] people about it as much although that's
[45:50] part of it but just to be Christians in
[45:52] the world that we live in and and that's
[45:54] part of that so we're going to try that
[45:55] he'll probably do that probably taking
[45:57] more than one Sunday because he'll only
[45:58] have about an hour to do that in before
[46:01] the next service so he'll do that over
[46:03] two or three Sundays the Lord willing
[46:06] and we're looking forward to that do you
[46:08] love the Lord this morning how many are
[46:10] glad to be in the house of God Amen good
[46:12] to have our visitors with us this
[46:13] morning God bless you guys thank you for
[46:15] coming and each one that's here and
[46:17] those that are watching this morning
[46:18] unable to be here I pray the Lord would
[46:20] bless you let's Stand Together Matthew
[46:22] chapter 15 and verse 21.
[46:25] Matthew chapter 15 and verse 21.
[46:29] how many believe God is good
[46:31] all the time isn't he amen Matthew 15 21
[46:39] it says then Jesus went Vents and
[46:43] departed into the coast of tire and
[46:45] sidon
[46:47] and behold a woman of Canaan came out of
[46:49] the same Coast
[46:51] and Cried unto him saying have mercy on
[46:54] me O Lord
[46:56] thou son of David
[46:57] my daughter is grievously vexed with the
[47:00] Devil
[47:02] but he answered her not a word
[47:04] and his disciples came and besought him
[47:06] saying send her away for she crieth
[47:09] after us
[47:11] but he answered and said I am not sent
[47:13] but unto the lost sheep of the House of
[47:16] Israel
[47:17] then came she and worshiped him saying
[47:19] Lord help me
[47:22] but he answered and said it is not meat
[47:24] to take the children's bread in other
[47:25] words it's not appropriate take the
[47:28] children's bread and to cast it to dogs
[47:30] and she said truth Lord look at her
[47:33] attitude
[47:34] truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the
[47:37] crumbs which fall from their masters
[47:40] table
[47:41] then Jesus answered and said unto her
[47:43] old woman great is thy faith
[47:46] be it unto thee even as thou Wilt and
[47:49] her daughter was made whole from that
[47:52] very hour amen let's bow our heads
[47:54] together for a word of prayer if you
[47:55] have a special need you'd like to make
[47:57] known by wave uplifted a hand I'm sure
[47:59] God sees each and every heart Heavenly
[48:01] Father Lord as we approach your word
[48:04] this morning we don't want to approach
[48:06] it in a way of Lord just a mental
[48:08] understanding but Lord we want your
[48:10] spirit to be here and to begin to reveal
[48:12] it to us Lord help us to know you or in
[48:16] a greater way when we leave here than
[48:17] when we came in Lord I pray for these
[48:20] requests that were made each uplifted
[48:22] hand there's something behind that some
[48:24] reason why they raised their hand Lord I
[48:27] pray you whatever's on their minds their
[48:28] hearts I pray you'd meet those needs
[48:30] today we believe you are an almighty God
[48:33] or we are nothing but you are everything
[48:35] the creator of the universe or you
[48:38] promised you would be here with us where
[48:40] two or three are gathered in your name
[48:41] we're here this morning and we're
[48:44] trusting you Lord to just just come in
[48:46] and meet ever need physical Financial
[48:48] spiritual whatever that need would be we
[48:51] believe that you are Jehovah Jireh or
[48:53] you can create something out of nothing
[48:55] and we thank you for that today Lord oh
[48:57] God be with us in this service today
[48:59] Lord I pray that every everything would
[49:02] be cast down that is unlike you move me
[49:05] out of the way Lord may may only your
[49:07] your word come out Lord not not any of
[49:10] me but God may your word be preached
[49:12] Lord and may we believe it because it is
[49:14] your word because your spirit quickens
[49:16] it to our hearts we pray we you we ask
[49:19] these things in the precious name of
[49:21] Jesus amen amen God bless you you can be
[49:24] seated this morning
[49:30] attitude is defined as a settled way of
[49:34] thinking or feeling about someone or
[49:37] something
[49:38] typically one that is reflected in a
[49:41] person's Behavior
[49:43] and even the world knows that attitude
[49:47] matters Thomas Jefferson says nothing
[49:48] can Thomas Jefferson says nothing can
[49:51] stop the man with the right mental
[49:54] attitude from achieving the goal nothing
[49:57] on Earth can help the man with the wrong
[49:59] mental attitude so we know that even
[50:02] even men in their own minds can think of
[50:05] that that if you have the right attitude
[50:07] towards something that you'll get a
[50:10] better response from it so I want to
[50:12] talk about attitude the right
[50:15] attitude and approach again because we
[50:18] want to have the right attitude don't we
[50:19] towards the word of God now uh and we
[50:22] begin to speak about this on Wednesday
[50:24] night I I thought about the deserts you
[50:27] know and how the birds fly across the
[50:29] desert the vulture flies across the
[50:31] desert as he goes he he goes across the
[50:34] bear and Wasteland of desert he's
[50:36] looking for something he he's in a
[50:38] certain posture a certain attitude
[50:40] what's he looking for dead flesh
[50:43] right and so he's looking for dead
[50:45] things and or nearly dead things that he
[50:48] can wait till they die and then he can
[50:49] have himself a feast so he flies across
[50:52] the desert looking for those things and
[50:54] partaking of those things and yet a
[50:56] hummingbird flies across the same desert
[50:59] and they travel hundreds of miles across
[51:03] the desert and a hummingbird is not
[51:05] looking for dead things but what they're
[51:07] looking for is bright flowers and each
[51:10] one because of their attitude what
[51:12] they're looking for what they are in
[51:14] their nature each one of them each one
[51:17] of them finds what they're looking for
[51:19] if you're in a desert so they say but
[51:21] brother Ben my life is bad and I've had
[51:23] so many bad things happen to me you
[51:25] might be in a desert but if you have the
[51:27] right attitude towards the things of God
[51:29] you'll be looking for things that'll
[51:31] help you things that will sustain you on
[51:34] your journey but if you're a buzzard to
[51:36] begin with in other words if if you
[51:38] don't have the right attitude if you if
[51:39] you've never been born again if you've
[51:42] never received Christ in your heart
[51:43] what's going to happen is you actually
[51:45] look for dead things and that's what you
[51:48] find
[51:49] sir amen now
[51:52] I I appreciate you back in the word this
[51:54] morning I just love you for that I
[51:56] appreciate it glad we we will have a
[52:00] church where people is not afraid to say
[52:01] Amen
[52:03] so brother Branham taught us this that
[52:05] he said God's word is a seed and if you
[52:08] put it in the right kind of ground of
[52:10] faith and treat it right
[52:13] come on I'd treat it right have the
[52:15] right kind of attitude about it you know
[52:19] the attitude that we have to have
[52:20] towards the promises of God is is
[52:23] totally to be totally wrapped up in the
[52:26] will of God you realize that when Jesus
[52:28] comes to the cross the promise of God
[52:31] for for him and for us had to be
[52:33] fulfilled by him going to the cross and
[52:35] many times the promises of God in our
[52:38] lives come through disappointment they
[52:40] come through hardship many times the Way
[52:42] Up Is Down and in order to reach a place
[52:45] of of prominence in order to reach a
[52:48] place where we're in the clear and
[52:50] everything's going good first you've got
[52:52] to go through some struggles and you've
[52:53] got to go through some trials anybody
[52:55] anybody identify with that today you got
[52:58] to go through some things in your life
[52:59] in order to reach a place where God
[53:01] begins to bless you and so Jesus had to
[53:04] come to a place where he said not my
[53:06] will but thine be done
[53:08] not what I think but what you think Lord
[53:11] let me be that person that that
[53:14] surrenders to the will of God completely
[53:16] in my life
[53:18] so he said it'll produce just what it is
[53:20] if it's for healing it'll produce
[53:22] healing salvation Salvation joy joy and
[53:26] every promise in the Bible is true
[53:29] he said and just remember you can take
[53:31] me to record for this that the right
[53:33] mental attitude towards any Divine
[53:35] promise of God will bring it to pass
[53:38] if you can take the right attitude
[53:40] towards that promise what did the woman
[53:42] say we preached about Wednesday night
[53:44] she said if I can butt Touch the Hem of
[53:47] His Garment
[53:48] the promise was that he was the Messiah
[53:50] and he would be a Healer but what she
[53:53] said was if I can just come in contact
[53:55] with him he don't have to speak to me it
[53:58] don't have to be a great thing it may
[54:00] not be an emotional thing but if I can
[54:01] Touch the Hem of His Garment
[54:03] I'll behold her attitude was such that I
[54:06] don't even have to make contact he don't
[54:09] even have to see me
[54:11] and I'll still be blessed
[54:13] who am I and that's the kind of attitude
[54:15] that she had now I we find that attitude
[54:19] in the early church that the Believers
[54:21] had that kind of attitude in Acts
[54:22] chapter 5 and verse 14. it says and
[54:25] Believers were the more added to the
[54:27] Lord multitudes both of men and women in
[54:31] so much that they brought forth the sick
[54:32] into the streets and laid them on beds
[54:35] and couches that at the least the shadow
[54:38] of Peter
[54:39] this is Faith Church that they just come
[54:43] by they had a need they had a real need
[54:45] now brother Branham says when you're in
[54:46] the line of duty and you have a need a
[54:49] real need God will meet that need yes
[54:52] you just speak it and go forward
[54:54] but now Believers were added to the Lord
[54:57] and and they begin to lay their sick on
[54:59] beds and couches so the shadow of Peter
[55:02] as he walked by now Peter never told
[55:04] them to do that
[55:05] right but just their attitudes was so
[55:08] strong towards the things of God but
[55:10] adjusted that they begin to just walk
[55:12] right into it and they actually receive
[55:14] their healing even though they didn't
[55:15] have any promise of doing that but they
[55:17] received their healing because of their
[55:19] attitude
[55:20] towards the things of God and the man of
[55:22] God
[55:23] so now it says There came also a
[55:26] multitude out of the Cities Round Up to
[55:28] Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them
[55:30] which were vexed with unclean spirits
[55:32] and they were healed everyone
[55:34] I believe every one of us could be
[55:36] healed this morning I believe every
[55:38] person in here can be saved I believe
[55:39] every person can be filled with the Holy
[55:41] Ghost why because if your attitude was
[55:44] towards the word was right he is here he
[55:46] can do anything
[55:48] all things are possible to them that
[55:50] believe
[55:52] so so in that first age they had that
[55:56] attitude in Acts 1911
[55:59] it says God wrote brought special
[56:01] special Miracles by the hands of Paul so
[56:04] that from his body we're brought into
[56:07] the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the
[56:10] diseases departed from them
[56:13] and the evil spirits went out of them
[56:16] so the attitude of the people was such
[56:19] that they said if I can just get a
[56:21] handkerchief
[56:24] I'll actually be well there was no power
[56:28] in the handkerchief there was no power
[56:29] in the clothes but it was their attitude
[56:31] towards the word of God
[56:34] Hallelujah
[56:36] no
[56:38] the woman in our text she had to
[56:39] overcome something very difficult
[56:42] she had to overcome who she was
[56:45] yeah I want us to listen this morning
[56:46] not because it's me saying it because
[56:49] all I want to do is help you you got to
[56:51] believe that if you don't believe that I
[56:53] can't help you but all I want to do is
[56:55] help somebody and if I can help you this
[56:57] morning be by the word of God so I want
[57:00] you to listen because it's the word of
[57:01] God I believe that it's the word of God
[57:03] now the woman she had to overcome
[57:06] something what what is it it was
[57:08] something very difficult it was who she
[57:10] was
[57:12] right she was a gentile
[57:14] and it was not a gentile age
[57:17] right they were not the elect people
[57:19] they were not the call of God they were
[57:22] not Grace had not yet been given to the
[57:25] Gentiles the gospel had not been sent to
[57:27] them
[57:28] so she had to overcome that fact in
[57:32] order for her daughter to be healed
[57:34] and so she comes to Jesus and Jesus
[57:37] refuses to pray for her daughter
[57:40] absolutely refuses it
[57:43] to pray for her daughter based on the
[57:46] impropriety of bestowing spiritual
[57:49] blessings
[57:50] I feel like this is just a little bit
[57:52] too loud for the game it
[57:54] Friday I don't I don't want to bust your
[57:56] eardrums this morning and I want to be
[57:58] able to preach so
[58:00] he says
[58:01] [Music]
[58:02] he said that you're you're people
[58:06] don't treat the things of God correctly
[58:09] now think deeply with me for just a
[58:11] moment he says he's not being racist
[58:15] right saying the Gentiles are dogs
[58:17] although it would have appeared to her
[58:18] that way
[58:20] right but he's saying the Gentiles don't
[58:22] treat sacred things with the proper
[58:26] respect
[58:28] sure they don't have the right attitude
[58:32] oh God
[58:33] towards the things of God
[58:36] you ever thought about that he's saying
[58:38] he's saying I can't take the children's
[58:40] bread this healing was for the children
[58:43] God's people God's elect he said I can't
[58:46] take the children's bread and give it to
[58:47] people who won't appreciate it
[58:49] won't even recognize where it come from
[58:51] yeah
[58:52] oh my God so and this was in accordance
[58:55] with this earlier teaching where he told
[58:57] the disciples give not that which is
[58:59] holy unto the dogs
[59:01] neither cast you ask you Euros Before
[59:04] Swine lest they trample them under their
[59:07] feet and turn again and Rend you
[59:11] so he's saying the what he calls for a
[59:13] dog he's saying he's not he's not just
[59:15] being mean but he's saying that these
[59:18] people do not understand the things of
[59:21] God they don't comprehend the things of
[59:23] God they don't appreciate the things of
[59:25] God
[59:26] now look
[59:28] dogs and Swine
[59:30] do not look
[59:32] and see where their blessings are coming
[59:34] from
[59:35] like the proverb that brother Branham
[59:37] told about the pig standing under the
[59:39] apple tree sit there and eat apples all
[59:42] day never once look up see where it was
[59:44] coming from
[59:45] he don't try to care for it he's not
[59:47] going to prune it he's not going to take
[59:49] care of it he just eats yeah
[59:51] he don't ever look see where oh my I
[59:53] don't want to be like that do you I want
[59:55] to look up and see the one that it came
[59:57] from
[59:58] so the Gentiles received the blessings
[1:00:01] of God by being human beings and not
[1:00:03] being wiped off the Earth
[1:00:05] right the long-suffering of God the rain
[1:00:08] falls on the just and the unjust they've
[1:00:10] built great civilization they built
[1:00:12] great a great countries and things and
[1:00:14] yet they never saw they never even
[1:00:16] looked at the things of God in fact they
[1:00:18] created Gods out of their own hands that
[1:00:21] they could worship and so it was the
[1:00:23] nature of Gentiles to trample the
[1:00:25] blessings of God under their feet
[1:00:28] you put a an untrained dog
[1:00:31] or a pig
[1:00:33] in the most beautiful place you can
[1:00:35] think of
[1:00:37] and they'll not act any differently
[1:00:39] than they would in the street
[1:00:41] or in a pigsty
[1:00:44] right because they don't know they don't
[1:00:46] appreciate it
[1:00:49] they just they don't appreciate your
[1:00:51] carpet
[1:00:53] right they don't appreciate it I see
[1:00:55] people take pigs in and if you have a
[1:00:57] pet pig that's fine I don't have I'm not
[1:00:59] preaching against pet pigs but hopefully
[1:01:02] you've trained it
[1:01:04] foreign
[1:01:05] because a pig doesn't have appreciation
[1:01:07] for Finer Things
[1:01:09] right
[1:01:11] you realize that's the way we're all
[1:01:12] born
[1:01:13] that's our name naturally we don't have
[1:01:15] an appreciation that's why many times
[1:01:17] God has to tell us no we have to go
[1:01:19] through some things
[1:01:21] oh God many times he don't just dump
[1:01:24] things in our lap because he wants us
[1:01:26] when we get it to be able to appreciate
[1:01:28] it in the right way
[1:01:32] so he said don't don't just give the
[1:01:34] holy things
[1:01:36] to people that won't appreciate it
[1:01:39] oh my now the message to the Gentiles
[1:01:43] was a message of Grace
[1:01:46] it had to be
[1:01:48] they hadn't been taught
[1:01:50] they didn't have a Moses
[1:01:52] they didn't have a Jeremiah they didn't
[1:01:54] have an Isaiah look at the at the
[1:01:56] history of God's people and their their
[1:01:58] prophets and things and still they
[1:02:00] rejected God still they rejected the
[1:02:03] word when it came but yet to the
[1:02:06] Gentiles they they never had that right
[1:02:08] they never had a Moses they never had
[1:02:10] they weren't promised to Messiah brother
[1:02:12] Brandon said the Messiah did not come to
[1:02:13] them he come to the Samaritans and to
[1:02:15] the Jews because he did not come to the
[1:02:17] Gentiles because they weren't looking
[1:02:19] for him he said that's why the sign of
[1:02:21] the Messiah had to wait until this day
[1:02:23] he said because now he'd been looking
[1:02:25] for him for two thousand years and he
[1:02:27] had to show his sign
[1:02:29] right but he did not show it to the
[1:02:31] Gentiles in that day because they
[1:02:33] weren't looking for him he said he only
[1:02:34] comes to those who are looking for him
[1:02:37] so the message to the Gentiles was a
[1:02:39] message of Grace listen to Jeremiah
[1:02:40] prophesying of it in Jeremiah 16 19. he
[1:02:43] said oh Lord my strength and my Fortress
[1:02:45] my refuge in the day of Affliction the
[1:02:47] Gentiles shall come unto thee from the
[1:02:49] ends of the Earth and shall say surely
[1:02:51] our fathers have inherited
[1:02:54] lies
[1:02:56] vanity and things were in there is no
[1:02:59] prophet
[1:03:01] I think we could all as Gentiles
[1:03:04] As Americans if we could put it that way
[1:03:06] today
[1:03:07] we can all say surely our fathers have
[1:03:10] inherited lies vanity and things oh you
[1:03:12] say we have a great civilization the
[1:03:14] Roman civilization was a great
[1:03:15] civilization the Chinese had a great
[1:03:17] civilization it was many great
[1:03:19] civilizations great Indian civilizations
[1:03:21] and different things that there were
[1:03:22] many great civilizations have come and
[1:03:24] gone
[1:03:25] this is a great I believe this country
[1:03:27] is the best country on the face of the
[1:03:28] Earth if you don't believe that I'll
[1:03:29] take you with me to Togo sometime or
[1:03:31] over in West Africa and you'll begin to
[1:03:34] appreciate the country that we have
[1:03:36] and yet all of our fathers yeah
[1:03:39] inherited lies
[1:03:41] the vanity and things wherein there is
[1:03:43] no prophet
[1:03:45] because the Gentile way was not to look
[1:03:48] to God but to make God's
[1:03:51] Jeremiah 16 and 20 shall a man make Gods
[1:03:54] unto himself
[1:03:55] and they are no gods he said therefore
[1:03:58] behold
[1:03:59] Hallelujah I will this once cause them
[1:04:02] to know
[1:04:03] amen I will cause him to know my hand
[1:04:06] and my might and they shall know that my
[1:04:08] name is the Lord
[1:04:09] so there's going to be a gentile
[1:04:11] dispensation where they'll know
[1:04:14] but this woman was outside of that
[1:04:16] Gentile dispensation and still received
[1:04:19] a blessing from God because she
[1:04:20] approached it in the right way she had
[1:04:22] the right attitude towards the things of
[1:04:24] God somehow she overcame her very nature
[1:04:27] she wasn't like the whole mind she
[1:04:29] wasn't like the other Gentiles why was
[1:04:31] that because she was a predestinated
[1:04:33] seed of God listen to me you aren't like
[1:04:36] all the rest of the people you weren't
[1:04:37] like all the rest of your family there
[1:04:39] was something different about you what
[1:04:41] was it it was the predestination of God
[1:04:44] it was the election of almighty God that
[1:04:47] made you the way that you are
[1:04:50] Hallelujah
[1:04:54] he never went to the Gentiles right
[1:04:56] while he was on the earth Jesus was
[1:04:58] walking on the Earth
[1:05:00] we were worshiping frogs and snails
[1:05:03] that's right
[1:05:05] he said buddy I'm proud to be an
[1:05:06] Anglo-Saxon from England I'm as English
[1:05:08] as they come by the way I looked at my
[1:05:10] DNA because it's all it's all from one
[1:05:12] place
[1:05:15] and my family tree just moves together
[1:05:17] across
[1:05:19] from Europe over here
[1:05:21] and I got to looking at that and as I
[1:05:23] began to look at the DNA and things I
[1:05:25] don't have very much to be proud of
[1:05:28] not in the flesh I don't have very much
[1:05:30] to be proud of but but I I my I'm a
[1:05:34] gentile I'm an Anglo-Saxon you know what
[1:05:36] the Anglo-Saxons were doing
[1:05:40] you talk about heathens
[1:05:44] right back in the day the Angels Angles
[1:05:46] fan everybody said well I won't have
[1:05:48] white pride or or
[1:05:50] whatever other color probably get myself
[1:05:52] in trouble here
[1:05:53] whatever color Pride you want we
[1:05:55] shouldn't have pride in our skin color
[1:05:58] we should have pride and Grace
[1:06:00] that God found us in spite of who we
[1:06:02] were
[1:06:03] huh but now these Anglo-Saxons walk
[1:06:07] around with clubs on their back
[1:06:08] you know killing each other tribal
[1:06:11] Warfare and and all of those things we
[1:06:13] weren't we weren't any better off than
[1:06:15] anybody else
[1:06:16] we were just like everybody else and so
[1:06:19] we were we were worshiping snails
[1:06:21] worshiping frogs
[1:06:22] worshiping the Sun
[1:06:24] worshiping the moon painting our faces
[1:06:27] carrying clubs
[1:06:29] come on not too different from today
[1:06:31] actually
[1:06:35] but Romans 9 30 says what shall we say
[1:06:38] then that the Gentiles which followed
[1:06:41] not after righteousness have attained to
[1:06:43] righteousness wow what kind of righteous
[1:06:46] even the righteousness which is of faith
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] so the message and now you have been
[1:06:52] sent to the Gentiles when this woman's
[1:06:54] daughter got sick it she overcame the
[1:06:56] natural attitude of a gentile and her
[1:06:59] daughter was healed yes and nature is
[1:07:01] the hardest thing to overcome it's what
[1:07:03] we're it's our DNA it's what we're
[1:07:05] what's built into us it's just built
[1:07:08] into us and some people struggle with
[1:07:10] different things and and sometimes
[1:07:12] people struggle with a certain thing and
[1:07:14] you think well that person must be just
[1:07:15] a terrible person well they may be okay
[1:07:17] in every other area of their life but
[1:07:19] there's that one thing but the random
[1:07:20] said that the devil has one one punch
[1:07:22] coming and many times we uh we we we sit
[1:07:25] there and we just take that punch over
[1:07:27] and over again and so some people might
[1:07:29] struggle with sickness some people might
[1:07:31] struggle with unbelief some people might
[1:07:32] struggle with this side or the other but
[1:07:34] but it just runs kind of in the family
[1:07:36] it's just built in and so those are the
[1:07:38] things we have to overcome in order to
[1:07:41] receive from Christ and have the right
[1:07:42] attitude to come to God are you with
[1:07:45] them so far
[1:07:46] so so this is the hardest thing to
[1:07:48] overcome your natural attitude now think
[1:07:51] about this is the way you would act
[1:07:54] without thinking about it
[1:07:57] right yeah
[1:07:59] how you would treat people without
[1:08:01] thinking about it
[1:08:03] see this is why you have to be filled
[1:08:04] with the Holy Spirit yes because if
[1:08:06] you're not filled with God
[1:08:08] you're not you'll just display your
[1:08:10] natural attitude now some people are
[1:08:12] better than others in that sense like
[1:08:14] they act better than others but we all
[1:08:17] have some attitudes that are not
[1:08:18] according to the word
[1:08:19] all of us do yeah
[1:08:21] I some people are are more fiery some
[1:08:24] people are more laid back but we still
[1:08:26] have attitudes that are not according to
[1:08:28] the word yeah and we have to correct
[1:08:30] those by the word
[1:08:31] so we find that in the attitude passes
[1:08:33] through families brother random tells us
[1:08:35] that your attitude towards Christ will
[1:08:37] make a great impression on what your
[1:08:39] children will be yeah
[1:08:41] yeah oh my aren't you glad that aren't
[1:08:43] you glad you didn't just follow your mom
[1:08:45] and dad's attitude or your grandma and
[1:08:47] grandpa's attitude but you took an
[1:08:49] attitude towards Christ you say brother
[1:08:50] Ben I forgot a mess I've I've been
[1:08:53] involved in a lot of bad things but
[1:08:54] don't you realize you can change that
[1:08:56] today that the spirit of God can come in
[1:08:58] your life and change you and you can
[1:09:01] change your family history
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:04] it's good hallelujah what was brother
[1:09:07] Stewart said something that last week
[1:09:09] that that just stuck with me he said
[1:09:11] Ruth overcame
[1:09:13] the fact that her it was in her family
[1:09:15] DNA
[1:09:17] put into my own words but it was in her
[1:09:19] family DNA to turn back
[1:09:22] because she was a lullaby and the mother
[1:09:24] of the moabites was lost wife who turned
[1:09:27] back and become a pillar of salt and yet
[1:09:29] when the opportunity came to turn back
[1:09:30] Ruth did not why she was predestined by
[1:09:33] God
[1:09:33] [Music]
[1:09:35] aren't you glad she was predestined to
[1:09:37] Redemption why didn't you turn back when
[1:09:40] others turned back why didn't you leave
[1:09:41] the message when others left why didn't
[1:09:43] you quit being a Christian when others
[1:09:45] quit why are you still here this morning
[1:09:47] because of the predestined elect power
[1:09:49] of God it's a seed of God inside of you
[1:09:52] that made the difference
[1:09:55] family would have turned back you people
[1:09:57] would have turned back you were a
[1:09:58] gentile she was a gentile but she said
[1:10:01] your people be my people
[1:10:04] your God will be my God oh God
[1:10:06] let me let me be led by the god of the
[1:10:09] Bible
[1:10:10] Lord let me go where you go let me let
[1:10:12] me be a part of what you're doing
[1:10:18] so Ruth overcame her family attitude and
[1:10:21] orpa continued
[1:10:23] turning back
[1:10:25] see the difference now we're called and
[1:10:27] chosen by God
[1:10:29] to overcome those things in our natural
[1:10:31] disposition which are against the word
[1:10:35] so we can have an attitude of humble
[1:10:37] expectation as we talked about Wednesday
[1:10:39] night towards the promises of God that's
[1:10:42] the attitude that we should have
[1:10:43] so first Peter two one let's look at
[1:10:45] that for just a moment he's speaking to
[1:10:47] Gentiles here he said wherefore laying
[1:10:49] is tight on malice all guile and
[1:10:52] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[1:10:53] speakings as newborn babes desire the
[1:10:57] sincere milk of the word that you may
[1:10:59] grow thereby it was so be that you have
[1:11:01] tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom
[1:11:04] coming is unto a living Stone disallowed
[1:11:06] indeed of men but chosen of God and
[1:11:09] precious so we weren't the only ones who
[1:11:11] were Outcast he was an outcast
[1:11:15] he said disallowed of men but chosen of
[1:11:18] God and precious ye also as Lively
[1:11:21] stones are built up a spiritual house
[1:11:24] and holy priesthood to offer up
[1:11:27] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:11:30] by Jesus Christ I love that wherefore
[1:11:33] also it is contained in the scripture
[1:11:35] behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone
[1:11:37] elect precious and he that believeth on
[1:11:40] him shall not be confounded unto you
[1:11:42] therefore unto you which believe he is
[1:11:45] precious
[1:11:46] he has great value to you
[1:11:49] in spite of you being a gentile
[1:11:52] in spite of you being an American just
[1:11:55] like everybody other American in spite
[1:11:57] of you being just like anybody else but
[1:11:59] to you who believe he is precious unto
[1:12:03] them which be disobedient the stone
[1:12:04] which the builders disallowed the same
[1:12:06] is made the head of the corner a stone
[1:12:09] of stumbling a rock of offense even to
[1:12:10] them would stumble at the word being
[1:12:12] disobedient were unto also they were
[1:12:14] appointed but ye are a chosen generation
[1:12:16] a royal priesthood a holy nation A
[1:12:20] peculiar people
[1:12:21] that you should show forth the Praises
[1:12:23] of him who have called you out of
[1:12:25] Darkness into his marvelous life
[1:12:27] which in time past were not a people but
[1:12:29] are now the people of God aren't you
[1:12:31] glad for the grace of God today which
[1:12:34] had not obtained Mercy but now have
[1:12:36] obtained Mercy
[1:12:40] see my ancestors your ancestors most of
[1:12:43] you most of you come I I'm assuming this
[1:12:46] morning from gentiles
[1:12:48] and God Saves both Gentiles and Jews
[1:12:51] during the Gentile age if they believe
[1:12:53] by faith and come according to Faith but
[1:12:56] the Jews were saved as a nation
[1:12:58] but Gentiles and Jews during the Gentile
[1:13:00] dispensation are both saved if they come
[1:13:02] to Christ by faith
[1:13:04] so but the Gentiles did not place a
[1:13:06] proper value on sacred things
[1:13:09] the Jews were taught to approach god
[1:13:11] with reverence
[1:13:13] even to the point of when they would
[1:13:15] come into the holy of holies the high
[1:13:17] priests the most the person who was the
[1:13:20] highest in the land as far as this walk
[1:13:22] is the way he held himself he was a good
[1:13:25] man
[1:13:26] but when he went into the holy of holies
[1:13:28] he had a a skirt that had a bell and a
[1:13:31] pomegranate on it yeah right and when he
[1:13:33] went in and he moved his skirts would
[1:13:35] would ring
[1:13:37] because the pomegranate would ring
[1:13:39] against the belt and the reason they did
[1:13:41] that because they approached the things
[1:13:43] of God with such fear and reverence that
[1:13:46] they knew that if he did something just
[1:13:49] a little bit wrong he would actually not
[1:13:51] make it he would he would he would die
[1:13:52] right there in the holy of holies so in
[1:13:56] the presence of that light in the
[1:13:57] presence of the Shekinah in the presence
[1:13:59] of the shoe bread and the holy things he
[1:14:01] he if when he moved every move had to be
[1:14:03] right
[1:14:05] and you knew that he was still alive
[1:14:07] because he was making noise
[1:14:10] right so but he would move and he'd make
[1:14:13] noise and so that was their attitude
[1:14:15] towards holy things the Gentiles didn't
[1:14:17] care
[1:14:19] the Gentiles idiotic and Antiochus
[1:14:21] epiphanes I think I'm saying that right
[1:14:23] if I'm not brother Justin will correct
[1:14:25] me later but Antiochus epiphanes he was
[1:14:28] he was a man who set himself up to be
[1:14:30] God he was a Greek and when he took over
[1:14:32] when he took over uh the land of Israel
[1:14:36] when the Greeks ruled there his father
[1:14:38] had taken him and they let the Jews
[1:14:39] continue to Worship in the temple and do
[1:14:41] the things that they did but when he
[1:14:43] took over he decided he was going to
[1:14:45] squelch that so he goes down to
[1:14:46] Jerusalem and takes pigs and offers Pig
[1:14:50] blood swine Blood on the altar of God
[1:14:53] absolutely had no had absolutely no
[1:14:57] regard
[1:14:58] for the holy things of God
[1:15:00] he was a gentile that's just the way
[1:15:02] they were
[1:15:03] the Romans had no regard for the holy
[1:15:06] things of God when Titus coming to
[1:15:08] Jerusalem in 70 A.D when he comes into
[1:15:10] Jerusalem he actually destroys the
[1:15:13] temple they burn the temple to the
[1:15:14] ground
[1:15:15] and they come in and take out the sacred
[1:15:17] things out of the temple and they take
[1:15:19] them back to Rome and they take they
[1:15:22] take the menorah and the table the shoe
[1:15:24] bread you can see them on titus's Arch
[1:15:27] they're in Rome where they took them
[1:15:29] back which still stands today they took
[1:15:31] them back and they actually paraded it
[1:15:33] through the streets
[1:15:35] and the fact is that no one had ever
[1:15:37] seen that
[1:15:39] but the high priest
[1:15:41] so it goes from the Jews treating it
[1:15:42] with such reverence that no one had ever
[1:15:45] seen it to the Gentiles take it and
[1:15:47] parade it through the streets of the
[1:15:48] biggest city in the Earth
[1:15:50] you see the difference
[1:15:53] that attitude still exists today
[1:15:56] people mock the things of God
[1:15:59] and we shouldn't do that church right
[1:16:01] right even if we don't understand it we
[1:16:03] shouldn't do it
[1:16:04] right brother Brandon talks about those
[1:16:06] some boys were mocking communion they
[1:16:07] went up and drank whiskey and and things
[1:16:09] in their room and said this is communion
[1:16:11] took it and two of them end up in the
[1:16:13] insane asylum and one of them ended up
[1:16:15] dead
[1:16:16] I don't say that would happen to you but
[1:16:18] I'll say this if it doesn't it's just
[1:16:20] the goodness of God giving you a space
[1:16:21] to repent
[1:16:25] you can't disrespect God you've got to
[1:16:28] respect God he said if you don't believe
[1:16:29] it just keep still keep away from it
[1:16:31] either do that or come reverently and
[1:16:32] respect it don't make fun of people in
[1:16:34] the spirit don't talk about people
[1:16:36] that's worshiping in the spirit of God
[1:16:38] let them alone
[1:16:41] the Bible doesn't tell us see
[1:16:44] if you think about this now I want us to
[1:16:46] I want us to dig deep here and begin to
[1:16:48] think about our attitude towards the
[1:16:49] sacred things of God because it's our
[1:16:51] natural way for the Isaac to be to just
[1:16:53] treat them as nothing right but when the
[1:16:55] spirit of God comes in our life we begin
[1:16:57] to treat church as different we we treat
[1:17:00] the Bible differently we treat the
[1:17:01] message of the hour differently yes
[1:17:03] right not because there's any Holiness
[1:17:05] in the book itself but because we
[1:17:07] believe the word that's on it right we
[1:17:09] believe that it's not anything about a
[1:17:11] picture or a sign or anything like that
[1:17:13] it's not a name it's not a person but we
[1:17:16] believe we reference God and we worship
[1:17:19] Him in spirit and in truth yeah so we
[1:17:21] treat the things of God with reverence
[1:17:23] now the Bible doesn't just tell us to
[1:17:26] love God how many know this the Bible
[1:17:29] doesn't just tell us to love God he
[1:17:31] tells us how to love God
[1:17:34] right Mark 12 29 Jesus to ask Jesus what
[1:17:37] are the greatest Commandments in the law
[1:17:39] and Jesus answered him to the first of
[1:17:40] all the Commandments is hear o Israel
[1:17:42] the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:17:44] and thou shalt love
[1:17:46] the Lord thy God
[1:17:48] he doesn't stop there
[1:17:50] with all that heart
[1:17:52] with all thy soul with all thy mind with
[1:17:55] all thy strength
[1:17:57] this is the first commandment he said
[1:17:59] brother Ben why do you you do the things
[1:18:00] that you do why do the people do the
[1:18:02] things that they do not because I tell
[1:18:03] them to do it not because even a prophet
[1:18:05] tells us to do it we do it because we
[1:18:08] value the things of God we value the
[1:18:10] word of God we want to do what God Said
[1:18:14] we want to live as close to the word of
[1:18:16] God as we can if you don't feel that way
[1:18:17] that's fine you go you go live your life
[1:18:19] before us let's live just as close to
[1:18:22] God as we can
[1:18:24] huh
[1:18:25] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[1:18:28] with all thy soul with all thy mind with
[1:18:30] all thy strength
[1:18:32] in every area of your life
[1:18:35] he said this is the first commandment
[1:18:36] and the second is like namely this Thou
[1:18:40] shalt Love Thy Neighbor he tells us how
[1:18:42] to do that too as thyself
[1:18:45] so love God with all of your heart all
[1:18:49] your strength all your mind and then
[1:18:50] love your neighbor
[1:18:51] to who is your neighbor
[1:18:53] who is your neighbor everyone you have
[1:18:54] an opportunity to do good into
[1:18:57] that was Samaritan he said who was
[1:18:58] neighbor to the Samaritan
[1:19:00] right it's everyone you have an
[1:19:01] opportunity to do something good for you
[1:19:03] do it as you have opportunity right we
[1:19:06] don't always have opportunity many times
[1:19:07] I wish I could do things for people and
[1:19:08] I can't do it I just don't have time and
[1:19:10] you experience the same thing you're a
[1:19:12] human being but when you do have
[1:19:13] opportunity do good yeah the people and
[1:19:16] sometimes doing good to people is
[1:19:18] corrective sometimes doing good to
[1:19:19] people is it requires you to to say
[1:19:22] something to people that I mean they
[1:19:23] don't want to hear but but you still
[1:19:25] have to you still have to do that
[1:19:26] because you want to see good come out of
[1:19:28] their life
[1:19:29] so let's put it in other words like this
[1:19:32] do not love God in a casual way yeah
[1:19:40] I'm gonna let that sink in a minute
[1:19:44] God
[1:19:45] casual way
[1:19:48] now in all of your attitudes towards God
[1:19:50] the all of your approaches to God
[1:19:52] we live in an age where everything is
[1:19:54] casual and I don't mind that so much in
[1:19:56] the dress and things like that it's not
[1:19:58] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:19:59] in our attitudes towards the things of
[1:20:01] God
[1:20:02] talking about I'm talking about in our
[1:20:04] in our worship and our praise and in our
[1:20:07] attitude towards church itself towards
[1:20:09] the house of God towards the Bible our
[1:20:12] attitude towards one another
[1:20:13] do not love God
[1:20:16] in a casual way
[1:20:18] look at John chapter 12. now Jesus at
[1:20:21] least twice in his ministry he was
[1:20:23] anointed for death
[1:20:25] he was anointed for death very similar
[1:20:28] stories but this was actually different
[1:20:30] from the woman at least it appears to be
[1:20:32] different from the woman who watched
[1:20:34] Jesus feet with her hair who you
[1:20:35] remember was a prostitute a woman of ill
[1:20:37] a repute and she come and washed his his
[1:20:39] feet and brother man who tells the story
[1:20:41] so well but there's another place where
[1:20:42] Jesus is Anointed in John chapter 12 and
[1:20:45] verse 1 and he's actually anointed by
[1:20:47] Mary Lazarus sister
[1:20:49] and so it says in Jesus six days before
[1:20:52] the Passover came to Bethany where
[1:20:54] Lazarus was which had been dead whom he
[1:20:56] raised from the dead
[1:20:57] there they made him a supper and Martha
[1:21:00] served but Lazarus I love this was one
[1:21:03] of them that sat at the table with him
[1:21:06] I just love that brother Bill
[1:21:08] Jesus was coming to dinner just an
[1:21:10] everyday occurrence but there was
[1:21:11] something special about it the man that
[1:21:14] had been raised from the dead
[1:21:16] a man whose life had been forever
[1:21:19] altered by the word from that man's lift
[1:21:21] was sitting right beside him eating too
[1:21:24] how are you it'd be hard to deny well
[1:21:27] that Jesus was the Messiah it would be
[1:21:29] hard to deny because here was a man who
[1:21:31] was dead let me tell you today when we
[1:21:33] sit together we sit here and we sit
[1:21:35] around round people who have been raised
[1:21:37] from the dead I'm not talking about
[1:21:39] naturally although that could happen I'm
[1:21:41] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:21:42] being raised from dead trespasses and
[1:21:45] sins you've come from the dead
[1:21:48] go ahead Lazarus if you want to worship
[1:21:51] worship you got a right to
[1:21:55] yeah you were dead but you lived today
[1:21:59] you say brother Ben why do you put all
[1:22:00] your heart into it why do you put up and
[1:22:02] you don't have to you don't have to do
[1:22:03] that to be a Christian maybe not but I
[1:22:05] want to love him the most I can because
[1:22:07] I recognize I'm sitting at the table and
[1:22:10] I have no right to be here brother Danny
[1:22:11] I should have been dead I should have
[1:22:13] been passed over I should have been
[1:22:15] rotten away amen Lazarus might have sat
[1:22:17] there and thought I should have been
[1:22:18] dead already I was rotten away it was
[1:22:21] four days late but he came and spoke to
[1:22:23] me yeah
[1:22:27] from shouting come on now
[1:22:30] reach
[1:22:31] are you with me now I'm not gonna put
[1:22:34] down on Lazarus or call him names
[1:22:36] because he worships God why he sat right
[1:22:38] down at the table and he said oh my I
[1:22:40] was dead but now I'm living how many can
[1:22:43] say Amen to that today I was dead but
[1:22:45] now I'm alive
[1:22:49] go ahead Lazarus
[1:22:50] worship God
[1:22:55] oh God
[1:22:57] Lazarus set at the table
[1:23:01] we don't I don't think we comprehend
[1:23:03] what it means to sit down with one
[1:23:05] another and eat a meal or sit down
[1:23:07] together in church
[1:23:09] I was dead
[1:23:11] but now I'm alive
[1:23:15] and of course that family was so
[1:23:16] appreciative of what Jesus did
[1:23:19] they didn't treat him just like any
[1:23:21] other person they didn't treat him like
[1:23:22] they did at Simon's house
[1:23:24] he went down to Simon's house they
[1:23:25] didn't kiss him they didn't annoy him
[1:23:27] but they were so appreciative of what he
[1:23:29] did
[1:23:30] that Mary comes out since then took Mary
[1:23:33] a pound of ointment of spikenard
[1:23:36] which is pure nard which comes from
[1:23:39] India
[1:23:40] and even today to get pure nard from
[1:23:43] India it costs something like 800 for a
[1:23:46] little bitty vial of pure nard from
[1:23:49] India because it's so rare and it's
[1:23:52] grown up in the mountains and they had
[1:23:53] to ship it you can imagine that day what
[1:23:55] it took to get it there yeah
[1:23:57] yeah and so it says a pound of ointment
[1:23:59] of spiking are very costly
[1:24:01] and anointed the feet of Jesus
[1:24:04] and wiped his feet with her hair
[1:24:06] and the house was filled with the odor
[1:24:09] of the ointment
[1:24:12] oh God
[1:24:14] speightner had a unique
[1:24:16] fragrance
[1:24:18] and the presence of its aroma was an
[1:24:21] indication that the very best had been
[1:24:23] offered
[1:24:26] when you walked into the house
[1:24:29] and you smelled spitnered you knew that
[1:24:33] only the very best
[1:24:36] all that our church services would be
[1:24:38] like that all that our homes would be
[1:24:41] like that that when when we come to
[1:24:44] worship God that it's not just any old
[1:24:46] thing it's not just any old service but
[1:24:49] it's our very best
[1:24:52] she took her very best
[1:24:54] and she give it to Jesus she didn't just
[1:24:57] give it to him she poured it on his head
[1:24:59] she anointed his feet another place and
[1:25:01] said she poured it on his head she broke
[1:25:03] the bottle
[1:25:06] the house was filled with the odor of
[1:25:09] the ointment Mark says some of those
[1:25:11] presidents were saying indignantly to
[1:25:13] one another why this waste of perfume it
[1:25:16] could have been sold for more than a
[1:25:17] Year's wages and the money given to the
[1:25:19] poor
[1:25:20] and they rebuked her harshly Judas had a
[1:25:23] calculator in his hand
[1:25:25] he did a man who knew the price of
[1:25:28] everything and the value of nothing
[1:25:30] and he instantly calculated the waste in
[1:25:33] terms of today's economy something like
[1:25:35] 25 to 30 thousand dollars
[1:25:43] someone come to you and they said I
[1:25:45] won't buy some perfume for the church
[1:25:48] make it smell good
[1:25:51] because Jesus is there
[1:25:54] think about it
[1:25:56] now if you come to me and said brother
[1:25:57] Ben I'm gonna buy some 25 000 perfume
[1:25:59] I'd say you don't have to do that
[1:26:03] because the thing of greater value to
[1:26:05] him
[1:26:08] it's the hand
[1:26:10] yeah
[1:26:11] of a redeemed child of God
[1:26:14] The Voice
[1:26:15] of a redeemed child of God who has been
[1:26:18] blessed beyond measure yes
[1:26:20] well I hope you hear me this morning
[1:26:22] you've been we've been blessed beyond
[1:26:24] measure we weren't supposed to be here
[1:26:26] but we're here we're seated at the table
[1:26:28] and the Hand of us redeemed child of God
[1:26:31] means so much more to him yes than the
[1:26:34] very best spikner
[1:26:37] see they tried to tell her oh she should
[1:26:39] do that she shouldn't worship like that
[1:26:41] she shouldn't get involved in church
[1:26:43] like that she shouldn't give everything
[1:26:45] like that she shouldn't do that yes sir
[1:26:47] and what Jesus said he when they asked
[1:26:49] him about it he said she did what she
[1:26:51] could
[1:26:53] oh I love that you may not be able to do
[1:26:55] what somebody else can do but you coming
[1:26:57] this morning you did what you could just
[1:26:59] to bury your sister Chris sitting back
[1:27:01] there you did what you could by coming
[1:27:02] to the house of God that's all we can do
[1:27:04] sometimes just the strength to come to
[1:27:07] the house of God we did what we could
[1:27:08] those of you who are sitting there
[1:27:10] watching this morning you're doing what
[1:27:12] you can you're sitting here this morning
[1:27:13] do what you can
[1:27:15] if you can raise your hand raise your
[1:27:16] hand if you can lift your voice lift
[1:27:18] your voice do what you can since she did
[1:27:20] what she could she could never repay him
[1:27:23] for bringing her brother back she could
[1:27:24] never repay him for the gift of
[1:27:26] Resurrection I could never repay him for
[1:27:28] the resurrection that's happened in my
[1:27:30] life what a resurrection that was but
[1:27:32] what a resurrection this is
[1:27:34] I could never repaint for the message of
[1:27:35] the hour but I'll do what I can
[1:27:40] it is within my power
[1:27:42] she said to buy the best ointment
[1:27:45] and anoint him with it so I will not
[1:27:47] give him less
[1:27:50] you see the attitude towards the word
[1:27:51] towards the holy things of God
[1:27:54] she didn't go up to the five and nine
[1:27:55] store
[1:27:57] she didn't go to the discount store and
[1:27:58] find a
[1:28:00] come on
[1:28:04] she didn't go to the discount store and
[1:28:05] find the the smells like spiknerd
[1:28:12] she didn't go down and find the the ax
[1:28:14] cologne
[1:28:17] laughs
[1:28:21] walk in the house
[1:28:24] spread that stuff I know some young
[1:28:26] people think that smells good but one of
[1:28:28] these days you'll grow up
[1:28:30] foreign
[1:28:40] Services stale
[1:28:42] come on
[1:28:46] oh well what's the point of worshiping
[1:28:48] today just you know for God nothing
[1:28:52] dead oh my God whatever the best is that
[1:28:55] we have we need to give that to God yeah
[1:29:00] if the best we have is what we're doing
[1:29:02] that's wonderful but what if we could do
[1:29:04] more and we don't I'm not talking about
[1:29:06] money today I'm talking about our life
[1:29:09] to him it means way more to him than
[1:29:11] money I don't need your money the church
[1:29:13] doesn't need your money
[1:29:15] we're going to make it because we're
[1:29:17] we're called by God to make it
[1:29:19] right you do what you feel is right but
[1:29:21] the church is not out for your money but
[1:29:23] what we're trying to do is build
[1:29:24] children women and men of God children
[1:29:27] of God the bride of Christ the edify the
[1:29:29] bride of Christ at the end time we're
[1:29:31] called to do that and I will not
[1:29:33] apologize for giving our best to God
[1:29:37] if we can provide a nice Sanctuary for
[1:29:39] you to for you to Worship in I think we
[1:29:41] ought to do it
[1:29:43] I want to apologize for that
[1:29:46] brother Madam said there's nothing too
[1:29:48] good for Jesus giving her best we may
[1:29:50] not be able to give him with the church
[1:29:51] down the road will but we can give him
[1:29:53] our best
[1:29:54] we can do our best he said he said
[1:29:56] whatever we give him it ought to be our
[1:29:57] best he said there's nothing too good
[1:29:59] for him give him everything you got your
[1:30:01] life your soul your being your time all
[1:30:04] that you have give it to him
[1:30:07] whatever we give him it ought to be our
[1:30:08] best we shouldn't go down to the
[1:30:10] discount store and give him part of our
[1:30:11] time when we happen to not be doing
[1:30:14] something we'll go to church that's not
[1:30:15] what we give God we give God our best
[1:30:17] why we've been redeemed from that
[1:30:19] Gentile way of thinking we're coming
[1:30:21] like the woman she said I'm willing to
[1:30:23] even eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:30:25] master's table
[1:30:26] I'm gonna give God my best
[1:30:29] whatever we give him we should I believe
[1:30:32] we should give him our best
[1:30:33] if we're going to play instruments we
[1:30:35] ought to we ought to learn how to play
[1:30:36] it well
[1:30:38] give God our best
[1:30:40] right my son's learning to play
[1:30:42] different instruments and and brother
[1:30:44] Wendell said something that because he's
[1:30:45] a musician I'm really not but brother
[1:30:47] Wendell's a musician but Wendell Martin
[1:30:48] and he said if a young man gets starting
[1:30:50] doing something he needs to focus on one
[1:30:52] thing why is that because you can give
[1:30:54] God your best
[1:30:55] sure you want to give God your best at
[1:30:57] something it if you're going to do it if
[1:30:59] you're going to run the video room give
[1:31:00] him your best I thank God for the people
[1:31:01] that we have to do that and giving my
[1:31:03] kids a break every now and then I
[1:31:05] appreciate that but if you're going to
[1:31:06] do it give God your best
[1:31:08] if you're going to be a deacon give God
[1:31:09] your best brother Brown so we should put
[1:31:11] our best people on the Deacon board
[1:31:13] we whatever we do whatever our trustees
[1:31:16] everything that we do we ought to give
[1:31:18] God our best I don't mean we have to be
[1:31:20] extravagant it just means we need to do
[1:31:22] whatever we can
[1:31:24] whatever we can do we should do if
[1:31:26] there's trash on the parking lot we
[1:31:27] ought to pick it up
[1:31:28] whatever we can goes for me and you and
[1:31:30] everybody else whatever we can do we
[1:31:32] should do yeah are you with me this
[1:31:34] morning
[1:31:35] I'm preaching to you this to you because
[1:31:36] you do that I I feel like most of you do
[1:31:39] that but if there's an ounce more that I
[1:31:40] can give Let Me Be Inspired this morning
[1:31:42] to give him my best
[1:31:47] why do it halfway
[1:31:49] let's give him our best
[1:31:51] let's make sure there's an atmosphere up
[1:31:53] here every service
[1:31:55] be my best
[1:31:57] and if there's a whatever position we
[1:32:00] find ourselves then we ought to do our
[1:32:01] best
[1:32:02] in that position not halfway but do our
[1:32:05] best
[1:32:06] and if if we see that if if I see that
[1:32:09] somebody else can help I you know I
[1:32:10] don't have these other preachers in I
[1:32:12] can preach three times a week
[1:32:13] but we do we use these Ministries
[1:32:15] because I believe they're some of the
[1:32:16] best God's Got
[1:32:18] we give the church the best
[1:32:21] and sometimes we give them room to
[1:32:23] become the best
[1:32:25] right because they've got to work in
[1:32:27] that office until they can get better
[1:32:28] yeah
[1:32:29] yeah right so we do that we let our
[1:32:31] young people play and sing and do things
[1:32:33] because we want them to become the best
[1:32:35] it's not about me it's about God it's
[1:32:37] about him getting the best worship out
[1:32:39] of the service
[1:32:41] and and I would say this as we move
[1:32:44] along now
[1:32:45] it shouldn't be just in our church it
[1:32:47] should be in our homes
[1:32:49] we give God first place in our home
[1:32:51] first place in our work
[1:32:54] first place among the people and then
[1:32:56] they'll see but Robert what kind of a
[1:32:57] Christian we are when they go looking
[1:32:59] for God they'll ask us
[1:33:02] right now look
[1:33:05] when we do wrong
[1:33:07] we should do our best to repent
[1:33:11] yeah
[1:33:12] think about the story of the Pharisee
[1:33:14] and the public and the Pharisee walks up
[1:33:15] there to God
[1:33:16] he gotten accustomed to Sacred things
[1:33:19] he was a priest he could come up to the
[1:33:21] temple he felt good about it
[1:33:23] he walks into church and says bless God
[1:33:25] I thank God I'm not like this other
[1:33:27] person
[1:33:29] you ever felt that way secretly I won't
[1:33:31] make you raise your hand but
[1:33:34] come to church and say I'm a pretty good
[1:33:36] person you know thank God that I'm not
[1:33:38] like all these other people out here you
[1:33:40] know
[1:33:42] but by the grace of God but for the
[1:33:44] grace of God
[1:33:46] Apostles by the grace of God I am what I
[1:33:48] am
[1:33:51] perishly walks up here and says I give
[1:33:54] tithes of all that I possess he's
[1:33:56] boasting to God
[1:33:58] of what he does
[1:34:00] and the public and the tax collector I
[1:34:02] love this he comes before God but he
[1:34:04] gives God his best in Repentance
[1:34:08] he gives God his best in Repentance he
[1:34:10] comes to God
[1:34:12] Paris is closed and spice himself on the
[1:34:14] breast and he says he says I'm not
[1:34:16] worthy
[1:34:17] to come before you Lord I'm not worthy
[1:34:20] to stand in this house but Lord if you
[1:34:23] would please forgive me and Jesus said
[1:34:25] which one of them went away Justified
[1:34:27] the Publican did
[1:34:30] the Publican went away Justified because
[1:34:32] God saw his attitude and approach
[1:34:34] towards the holy things of God
[1:34:36] Revelation 3 18 we live in an age where
[1:34:39] people don't repent it's hard for people
[1:34:40] to repent because they don't see that
[1:34:42] they're wrong we live in the age of
[1:34:43] laodicea in Revelation 3 and he tells
[1:34:45] that age he said I counsel thee to buy
[1:34:47] of me gold try it in the fire that thou
[1:34:49] mayest to be rich white Rhema to tell me
[1:34:52] is to be clothed at the shame of thy
[1:34:53] nakedness do not appear anoint thine
[1:34:55] eyes with eyes have the dumbass see as
[1:34:58] many as I love I rebuke and Chase and be
[1:35:00] zealous therefore and repent
[1:35:03] I'm gonna skip down
[1:35:05] brother Brandon talks about intellectual
[1:35:06] Giants coming around to prove that all
[1:35:09] this shouting and saying amen going to
[1:35:10] the altar breaking up because of your
[1:35:12] sins that it's just all emotion
[1:35:14] he said that's a scientific giant
[1:35:16] intellectual giant saying there's no
[1:35:18] such thing woke up dry eyed
[1:35:20] what's that mean no no there's no heart
[1:35:23] in it
[1:35:25] I love what brother Daryl Ward says he
[1:35:27] says sometimes God squeezes the heart
[1:35:28] and the juice comes out your eyes
[1:35:31] huh
[1:35:33] some people aren't criers I understand
[1:35:35] that but when you approach the things of
[1:35:37] God there ought to be something about
[1:35:40] you yeah that just and everybody
[1:35:42] worships in their own way everybody
[1:35:43] comes to God in their own way but
[1:35:45] there's got to be something serious
[1:35:46] about it something sincere about it
[1:35:48] something real about it not just a dried
[1:35:51] confession say I'll join this church and
[1:35:53] I believe Jesus Christ the son of God he
[1:35:55] said Satan does too no sign he's saved
[1:35:56] it takes more than that it takes a New
[1:35:58] Birth come on it takes the word it takes
[1:36:00] a new birth not just saying that it
[1:36:02] takes something that happens in here
[1:36:03] makes you different
[1:36:06] second Corinthians 7 10 the Bible says
[1:36:09] Godly sorrow worketh repentance
[1:36:12] I get worried about people who don't
[1:36:14] know how to repent
[1:36:15] because you're going to do something
[1:36:17] wrong
[1:36:21] all of us are
[1:36:23] The Herald at some point I know this is
[1:36:25] shocking to people
[1:36:27] I'll pick on brother Harold at some
[1:36:28] point where the hell is going to do
[1:36:29] something he has to repent of
[1:36:31] right
[1:36:33] he's been in the way in the message a
[1:36:35] long time
[1:36:37] decades it's been on a church view but
[1:36:40] every once in a while the herald I know
[1:36:42] you have to talk to God and say God
[1:36:43] forgive me
[1:36:45] I did something today I shouldn't have
[1:36:47] done I said something today I shouldn't
[1:36:48] have said
[1:36:50] if you don't know how to repent yeah
[1:36:52] it's a problem
[1:36:54] and if you come to God if we even if we
[1:36:56] come to our spouses like that if you
[1:36:58] come to your spouse after doing
[1:36:59] something that you shouldn't have done
[1:37:01] and it's flip it and it's arrogant
[1:37:04] you're not going to get forgiveness
[1:37:07] you're sure not going to get
[1:37:08] forgetfulness
[1:37:13] why because
[1:37:14] because you you didn't you don't know
[1:37:16] how to repent
[1:37:19] and it's hard because that's the Gentile
[1:37:21] way it's just built into our family not
[1:37:23] to be able to repent but God help me
[1:37:25] today
[1:37:26] God help me today to be able to still
[1:37:29] call out to God when I'm in trouble when
[1:37:31] I have a need to be able to be like
[1:37:33] David and say God forgive me
[1:37:36] oh God
[1:37:39] see the gospel even has to be sowed in
[1:37:41] tears you know that even when he
[1:37:43] preached the gospel we don't just preach
[1:37:45] it we don't just say it
[1:37:47] it'll just come out and scream at people
[1:37:50] right this kind of mean something to us
[1:37:52] I've told people I don't care how
[1:37:53] emotional you are in the Pulpit that's
[1:37:55] not a sign of anointing
[1:37:57] right that's not if Jesus sat down and
[1:37:59] spoke gracious words
[1:38:00] right but what is it there's something
[1:38:02] if you don't care about it the people
[1:38:04] won't care about it
[1:38:06] right if they can't see that you care
[1:38:08] about what you're saying how can I get
[1:38:10] you interested in what I'm selling if I
[1:38:12] was selling something if I'm not
[1:38:13] interested in it myself
[1:38:16] during the pandemic I went to look at a
[1:38:18] new vehicle and I went to one dealer and
[1:38:21] you know how everything was there's like
[1:38:22] three cars on the lot he saw sized me up
[1:38:25] and saw I didn't maybe wasn't the best
[1:38:27] customer he would ever have and and so
[1:38:29] he sized me up I might have been better
[1:38:31] than he thought but he sized me up and
[1:38:33] said and you know what so we don't
[1:38:35] really have anything for you I've never
[1:38:37] been to a Salesman like that
[1:38:42] this is a Car Lot usually it's like
[1:38:43] flies man they just
[1:38:46] they just swarm you
[1:38:48] ever drove around
[1:38:50] A Car Lot you gotta remember the
[1:38:52] building you sell cars didn't you you
[1:38:55] you did and you and Joel
[1:38:57] that's why well they get along so well I
[1:39:00] just realized that
[1:39:03] bless God God can even say the car
[1:39:04] dealer
[1:39:07] but but you take a uh you take a a used
[1:39:11] car they swarm you like that this guy
[1:39:12] wasn't interested
[1:39:14] I said well I'm not interested in buying
[1:39:15] what you got either
[1:39:18] huh
[1:39:19] you think somebody don't that's not
[1:39:21] interested in his Ford I'm not
[1:39:22] interested in the Ford I go down to
[1:39:24] Toyota and see what they got
[1:39:26] all right
[1:39:27] if you're going to sow the gospel sow it
[1:39:29] in tears
[1:39:32] show it in tears show it with some heart
[1:39:36] yeah oh God help us today I'm preaching
[1:39:38] to myself
[1:39:42] tell people about the message but you
[1:39:43] can take it or leave it
[1:39:45] and convinced
[1:39:49] but the Bible says Psalm 126-5 they that
[1:39:52] sow in tears shall reap in joy
[1:39:55] he that goeth forth you got somebody
[1:39:56] that you really care about you got
[1:39:58] somebody that you got on your heart Lord
[1:39:59] I'd like to see this person turn to God
[1:40:01] I'd like to see them really saved really
[1:40:03] born again if you've got some of you in
[1:40:05] your heart and you're thinking of
[1:40:06] somebody right now somebody in your
[1:40:07] heart don't have to have discernment to
[1:40:08] say that it's just the truth you got
[1:40:09] something in your heart you say I'd like
[1:40:10] to see them saved
[1:40:12] well what do you do yeah sometimes
[1:40:14] you've got to you've got to express that
[1:40:17] and you've got to say Lord help me to
[1:40:20] sow in tears help me to sow in tears in
[1:40:22] my prayer closet help me to sow in tears
[1:40:25] at the altar Elman is so in tears oh God
[1:40:27] help me to help me to put everything
[1:40:29] I've got into it help me to be a real
[1:40:32] Christian
[1:40:33] and if I become a real Christian that's
[1:40:35] going to help that person be how can
[1:40:38] they be saved if I've not really
[1:40:40] committed my own life to God
[1:40:42] let me commit my own life and God will
[1:40:44] take care of the people that I love
[1:40:46] come on do you believe that today I can
[1:40:48] I have to have faith for myself first
[1:40:50] and then I have faith for my family
[1:40:52] but they'll be okay they they're so in
[1:40:55] tears shall reap enjoy he that goeth
[1:40:57] forth and weep is bearing precious seed
[1:40:59] he knows how precious the seed is the
[1:41:02] farmer in ancient times he couldn't go
[1:41:03] down the market and buy more seed
[1:41:06] seed was all that he had it was his life
[1:41:09] so he did not carry it lightly he
[1:41:11] carried it as precious seed this is my
[1:41:14] life and he sowed it in such a way that
[1:41:16] he believed it would come up he didn't
[1:41:17] sow among the weeds and the thorns and
[1:41:19] things like that but he sowed it until
[1:41:21] ground because he believed it would come
[1:41:23] up
[1:41:25] he took care of it he went forth weeping
[1:41:27] bearing precious seed in the hardship in
[1:41:30] the In the Heat of the day in the toil
[1:41:32] of the hour
[1:41:33] so that he could come doubtless come
[1:41:35] again with rejoicing bringing his shoes
[1:41:37] with him
[1:41:39] if you don't put in the work
[1:41:41] you can't reap the benefit
[1:41:43] just the law of God
[1:41:45] you blame me but George Whitfield said
[1:41:48] this you blame me for weeping how can I
[1:41:50] help it when you will not weep for
[1:41:51] yourselves
[1:41:52] if you we live in a hardened age
[1:41:56] people are so hard
[1:41:58] they see things and do things
[1:42:00] and just don't bother them
[1:42:03] but if you want weep George Whitfield
[1:42:04] said let me weep for you yeah
[1:42:08] yeah you will not weep for yourselves
[1:42:09] though your Immortal Souls are on the
[1:42:10] verge of Destruction
[1:42:13] Paul said in Acts 20 31 therefore watch
[1:42:15] and remember by the space of three years
[1:42:17] I cease not to warn everyone night and
[1:42:19] day with tears
[1:42:21] taught us he said don't worry about the
[1:42:23] tears they won't hurt nothing come on
[1:42:26] come on that don't hurt see he that
[1:42:28] goeth for sowing in tears will doubt
[1:42:30] this return again bringing precious
[1:42:32] cheese
[1:42:33] see God wants us to repent because his
[1:42:35] attitude towards us is that we're
[1:42:36] valuable you're gonna have about five
[1:42:38] more minutes I want to turn this just a
[1:42:40] little bit
[1:42:42] you see sometimes it's hard for us as
[1:42:43] Gentiles to see ourselves with any value
[1:42:48] because Gentiles didn't value life
[1:42:51] they take their babies and just throw
[1:42:53] them out by the side of the road
[1:42:55] but it's the Jewish tradition the the
[1:42:58] judeo-christian is what we call today
[1:42:59] tradition that causes even our nation to
[1:43:01] Value life that's where it comes from
[1:43:03] but the Communists and things like they
[1:43:05] don't value life just a number you're
[1:43:08] just an oh God just a number but
[1:43:11] sometimes it's hard for us to Value
[1:43:12] ourselves in the proper way yeah
[1:43:16] yeah it's hard for us to see that we are
[1:43:19] valuable to God Jesus taught his
[1:43:21] disciples are not too Sparrow sold for a
[1:43:23] farthing one of them shall not fall on
[1:43:25] the ground without your father but the
[1:43:27] very hairs of your head are all numbered
[1:43:29] he said you're more value than many
[1:43:31] sparrows Paul has to remind the Gentiles
[1:43:34] they were valuable in First Corinthians
[1:43:35] 3 16 he said no you're not you are the
[1:43:38] temple of God
[1:43:39] remember the Gentiles would come into
[1:43:41] the temple and would just offer swine
[1:43:43] and everything else but Jews understood
[1:43:46] that the temple of God was holy and
[1:43:49] Paul's trying to teach the Gentiles he
[1:43:50] said don't you know that your body is
[1:43:52] the temple of God
[1:43:55] oh God that the spirit of God well is in
[1:43:57] you
[1:43:59] now think about that you are valuable to
[1:44:01] God he chose you as his Dwelling Place
[1:44:05] our natural inclination is to think of
[1:44:07] ourselves as worthless and hopeless but
[1:44:09] you are so much more than that
[1:44:12] if I could just get you to see that
[1:44:14] today you are not hopeless you are not
[1:44:16] you don't have to do anything to earn
[1:44:18] God's favor listen you don't have to
[1:44:20] work you don't have to go out and be a
[1:44:22] great Supernatural hero to be worth
[1:44:25] something to God
[1:44:26] you don't have to do anything you cannot
[1:44:29] earn salvation you cannot earn your
[1:44:31] blessing but it comes from God
[1:44:34] so we give him our best because of who
[1:44:36] we are and what he's done we love him
[1:44:38] because he first loved us
[1:44:41] Penny man defiled the temple he says him
[1:44:44] shall God destroy for the temple of God
[1:44:46] is Holy which Temple you are
[1:44:49] Jesus his attitude towards the church
[1:44:52] was to knock at the door even on the
[1:44:53] laodocian church who had put him out
[1:44:56] and would never open the door to him but
[1:44:57] he said behold I stand at the door and
[1:44:59] knock If any man hear my voice and open
[1:45:01] the door I will come into him and we'll
[1:45:03] sup with him and he with me
[1:45:05] what is his attitude towards us what
[1:45:07] should our attitude be towards other
[1:45:08] people
[1:45:09] we should we should season our words
[1:45:12] with salt
[1:45:14] God help me today
[1:45:16] you know what that means
[1:45:18] be careful that everything you say even
[1:45:20] if it's on the internet
[1:45:22] is seasoned with salt because you might
[1:45:25] be keeping someone away from the kingdom
[1:45:27] of God
[1:45:30] you might cause an unbeliever to take a
[1:45:34] bad attitude towards you
[1:45:35] which will keep them out of the Kingdom
[1:45:39] so we season everything we say with the
[1:45:42] understanding
[1:45:44] of the power of God's vested in us we
[1:45:47] are the temples of God
[1:45:49] what is his attitude towards us Jesus
[1:45:52] was born for one purpose that was for
[1:45:54] God to manifest himself through that
[1:45:56] body God was in Christ reconciling the
[1:45:59] world to himself
[1:46:00] he was a body that was made physical
[1:46:02] that men and women could see what he
[1:46:03] thought and his expression to the people
[1:46:05] in his gratefulness and his attitude
[1:46:07] towards all mankind he expressed it
[1:46:09] through Jesus Christ the Bible said for
[1:46:10] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:46:12] only begotten son that whosoever
[1:46:14] believeth in him should not perish but
[1:46:16] have everlasting life for God sent not
[1:46:18] his son into the world to condemn the
[1:46:20] world but that the world through him
[1:46:21] might be saved this is his attitude
[1:46:23] towards you
[1:46:25] and the prophet of God taught us he
[1:46:27] cannot change his attitude
[1:46:30] oh I love that he cannot change he is
[1:46:32] not a man that he should change he
[1:46:34] cannot change his attitude when he said
[1:46:36] I know the thoughts I think towards you
[1:46:37] nothing you could do could change that
[1:46:39] attitude
[1:46:41] he oh God he cannot change his attitude
[1:46:44] he's still Jehovah
[1:46:46] I don't care how many he says that he
[1:46:48] changes people have changed but he
[1:46:50] hasn't changed
[1:46:53] what is his attitude towards us
[1:46:57] let me just read this and I'm done
[1:46:59] Romans 8 31 what should we say then to
[1:47:01] these things if God before us who can be
[1:47:03] against us he despair not his own son
[1:47:06] but delivered him up for us all how
[1:47:07] shall he not with him also freely give
[1:47:10] us all things
[1:47:11] someone say all things who shall lay
[1:47:14] anything to the charge of God so that it
[1:47:16] is God that justifies who is he that
[1:47:18] condemneth it is Christ that died yeah
[1:47:19] rather than his risen again who is even
[1:47:21] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[1:47:24] intercession for us who shall separate
[1:47:26] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:47:29] tribulation under stress or persecution
[1:47:30] or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword
[1:47:33] as it is written for thy sake we are
[1:47:35] killed all the day long we are a
[1:47:36] countless sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:47:38] and all these things we are more than
[1:47:40] conquered through him that loved us this
[1:47:42] is his attitude towards us you are not
[1:47:45] forsaken you are not despised you are
[1:47:47] not a cult you are not what the world
[1:47:49] says you are you are the bride The
[1:47:51] Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ
[1:47:54] Hallelujah I'm persuaded that neither
[1:47:57] death nor life nor angels or
[1:47:58] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:48:00] present nor things to come musicians go
[1:48:02] ahead and come nor height nor depth nor
[1:48:04] any other creature shall be able to
[1:48:06] separate us from the love of God
[1:48:08] which is in Christ Jesus our lord he
[1:48:11] doesn't love us because we're deacons or
[1:48:12] trustees or song leaders he doesn't love
[1:48:14] us because we go to church he doesn't
[1:48:16] love us he loves us before we ever did
[1:48:18] any of that
[1:48:19] he loves us he loves you he wants to
[1:48:22] make you this Temple that's his attitude
[1:48:25] towards you I'll ask you what is your
[1:48:27] attitude towards him he cares do you
[1:48:29] care with every head bowed every eye
[1:48:31] closed this morning
[1:48:35] have you approached him
[1:48:37] with humble expectation
[1:48:40] believing in what he said in John 6 37
[1:48:42] all that the father giveth me shall come
[1:48:46] to me
[1:48:48] and him that cometh to me how will he
[1:48:50] know Wise

[1:49:02] a pass all of us have a past of some
[1:49:04] kind
[1:49:05] all of us may have messed up at some
[1:49:08] point in our lives

[1:49:14] cometh to me all the father giveth me
[1:49:18] shall come me in him that cometh to me I
[1:49:19] will in no wise
[1:49:21] cast out
[1:49:24] stands with open arms his attitude
[1:49:26] towards you is to receive you
[1:49:29] to make you a temple of the Living God
[1:49:32] what is your attitude towards him so I I
[1:49:34] don't want to be like that I
[1:49:37] you know you the people are different
[1:49:39] and holding us in their lifestyle and
[1:49:41] things but why do we do that not because
[1:49:43] some Creed tells us too we don't have
[1:49:45] any written statement only the
[1:49:47] scriptures no creeds no law but love no
[1:49:51] Creed but Christ no book but the Bible
[1:49:54] why do we do those things because

[1:59:47] my face yesterday
[1:59:48] [Music]
[2:00:02] with all the pictures
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:06] it's already done
[2:00:14] my heart's full this morning
[2:00:16] brother Robert you don't know what you
[2:00:18] did today
[2:00:19] a sister Millie sartin asked us to be
[2:00:23] baptized today we had the baptism pool
[2:00:26] ready for somebody else
[2:00:28] God that's the way God works
[2:00:34] that God laid it on that little girl's
[2:00:35] heart to be baptized today he has a way
[2:00:39] he has a way God has a way a method by
[2:00:42] which he works so we filled the pool
[2:00:44] today and we're disappointed that no one
[2:00:46] came but but now there's fruit of it
[2:00:50] because it really and I pray that God
[2:00:53] would fill every one of these children
[2:00:55] with the Holy Spirit at a young age they
[2:00:57] would never have to experience what some
[2:00:58] of us had to experience but if they do
[2:01:02] they do come on they would make a
[2:01:04] mistake they would know there's a God
[2:01:07] connected with something as a child
[2:01:09] there's a God that can come back to
[2:01:11] there's a reality of a living God
[2:01:14] and you love him today amen let's sing
[2:01:16] that I've already made it and and we'll
[2:01:18] go but Alan will have us go to the
[2:01:20] baptism service the way that we usually
[2:01:22] do God bless you this morning
[2:01:27] praise the Lord the Battle Is Over
[2:01:34] Victory is one it's already
[2:01:39] done I'm already healed oh

[2:01:49] Hallelujah
[2:01:51] I'm already here
[2:01:56] praise the Lord the Battle Is Over
[2:02:03] Victory is one it's already
[2:02:08] done give me your lord a handclap or
