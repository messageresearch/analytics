[33:52] Just right after she's done of Sister
[33:54] Ashley. Good to have you, sis. Sister
[33:56] Ashley comes and sings right after this.
[34:06] I try to pray,
[34:10] but the words aren't coming out the way
[34:13] they used to.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Did I lose my faith? God, do I still
[34:21] trust you?
[34:26] I try to worship.
[34:30] But when I lift my hand, it all just
[34:33] feels so empty.
[34:37] Is it the heavy of the world or is it
[34:41] just me
[34:47] for
[34:49] a thousand
[34:51] times?
[34:53] You're perfect and you'll never
[34:56] leave my side.
[35:00] Can I be hest?
[35:04] I just want to know that you still got
[35:08] this
[35:11] when all I'm holding on to is a promise.
[35:17] And God, you promised
[35:20] that you'll never leave me.
[35:24] When I'm scared of the dark, you're
[35:27] right there with me.
[35:30] Your kindness never fails. It's always
[35:34] reaching
[35:36] after me.
[35:40] But right now, God, all I need
[35:46] is to be honest.
[35:52] Oh, I've heard stories
[35:56] of you showing up when it was least
[36:00] expected.
[36:03] Every time you prove your time was
[36:06] always perfect
[36:09] in the way it was worth it.
[36:13] And again and again and again. See your
[36:17] power coming through. You see life to
[36:22] death. There's nothing you can do. I
[36:27] believe you did it.
[36:30] So won't you do it now? Can I be honest?
[36:37] I just want to know that you still got
[36:40] this.
[36:43] All I'm holding on to is the promise.
[36:49] And God, you promise
[36:52] that you'll never leave me.
[36:56] But I'm scared of the dark. You're right
[36:59] there with me.
[37:02] Your kindness never fails. It's always
[37:06] reaching
[37:08] after me.
[37:12] But right now, girl, all I need
[37:18] is your breath and I can't breathe. Your
[37:22] eyes mean I can't see. an anchor that
[37:27] the waves crash on.
[37:31] Be my heart when I can feel and show me
[37:36] something real.
[37:38] Just one taste of heaven in here now.
[37:44] Can I be hest?
[37:48] Oh,
[37:51] can I be hest?
[37:55] I just want to know that you still got
[37:58] this.
[38:01] When all I'm holding on to is a promise.
[38:06] And God, you promise
[38:10] that you never leave me.
[38:13] When I'm scared of the dark, you're
[38:16] right with me.
[38:20] Your kindness never fails. is always
[38:24] reaching
[38:26] after me.
[38:30] But I now got all I need.
[38:36] Yeah, I now got all I need
[38:42] is to be honest.
[39:55] the weapon may be formed, but it won't
[39:58] prosper.
[40:02] When the darkness falls, it won't
[40:04] prevail.
[40:08] For the God I serve knows only how to
[40:11] triumph.
[40:15] My God will never fail.
[40:21] My God will never fail.

[44:25] We had a request for Sister Anna to sing
[44:27] this song. Have you enjoyed the specials
[44:29] tonight? I believe this is the last one.
[44:31] And then you want to sing, too? No.
[44:33] Okay. All right. Well, I just open it
[44:36] up. Hey, you know, we won't be here all
[44:38] night. I told Jason though, he text me
[44:40] earlier and he said, "I've got 27
[44:42] pages." I said, "Well, uh, you're going
[44:44] to have to cut some of them off cuz I
[44:45] got a lot of songs." And uh hopefully
[44:48] hopefully he will
[44:51] go ahead and sing sis. Do you enjoy all
[44:52] of them tonight? I mean give all of our
[44:54] singers a wonderful hand if you would.
[45:06] Strong winds are blowing
[45:09] withered unreenting folks.
[45:14] People running to and fro. They don't
[45:18] know what's going on.
[45:22] Lands are failing because of turmoil in
[45:27] the land.
[45:30] Tes are closing.
[45:33] Free just can't take a stand. But it's
[45:37] going to take us all the way on the lips
[45:41] to keep me from my promises. Going to
[45:45] take all the way in the lips
[45:49] to turn me around. Going to take a
[45:54] lips because my feet are on
[46:00] solid ground.
[46:05] People are living
[46:08] no different than the world
[46:13] claiming to know the Lord
[46:17] but truly serving other gods.
[46:21] They go on day and night but they don't
[46:25] produce the light.
[46:29] anointed words at the end time. They're
[46:33] rejecting the Holy Cross. It's going to
[46:36] take a stronger than this
[46:40] to keep me from my promises. Going to
[46:44] take a stronger than this
[46:48] to turn me around. Going to take it
[46:52] stronger in the grips because my feet
[46:57] are on solid ground.
[47:04] Even searching
[47:07] for the true and living God.
[47:12] There's a famine in the land and the
[47:16] word seems nothing more.
[47:20] They have eyes we cannot see. They have
[47:24] ears we cannot hear.
[47:28] If they only knew scripture, they know
[47:31] that Jesus Christ is here. And it's
[47:34] going to take a stronger win than this
[47:39] to keep me from my promises. Going to
[47:43] take a stronger win than this
[47:47] to turn me around. Going to take a
[47:51] stronger than this because my feet are
[47:56] on solid ground.
[48:01] Oh, it's going to take it stronger in
[48:04] the
[48:06] keep me from my promises. Going to take
[48:10] it stronger in the lips
[48:14] to turn me around. Going to take it
[48:18] stronger in the lips
[48:22] to keep this eagle
[48:26] down.
[48:45] Let's stand together. Amen. Would you
[48:47] give the Lord another hand clap of
[48:48] praise tonight?
[48:53] Anybody lost glasses here at the local
[48:55] church? We found glasses over the
[48:56] weekend. So, just uh I'll have them if
[48:59] you lost them. Amen.
[49:02] Did you come to see Jesus tonight? Amen.
[49:05] And there's nothing we can do to help
[49:07] you. We can try to set an atmosphere and
[49:10] try to invite him here, but if he don't
[49:12] show up, it's all in vain. But I believe
[49:14] he's here tonight. Amen. I believe he
[49:17] loves to be worshiped. So, let's just
[49:18] worship him. Amen. I'm going to have our
[49:20] pastor come and and introduce brother
[49:22] Jason tonight. Amen. How many's looking
[49:24] forward to the word of the Lord this
[49:26] evening? Amen. Let's just sing this as
[49:28] we turn it to our pastor. I really want
[49:33] to see.
[49:37] Oh yes,
[49:40] it's Jesus
[49:43] I really
[49:45] want
[49:47] to see.
[49:51] Oh, this is Jesus
[49:57] I really
[49:59] want to sing.
[50:06] Oh yes, the more I see
[50:11] of this old world,
[50:14] the less it means to me.
[50:20] for it's Jesus
[50:25] I really
[50:27] want.
[50:28] If you want to see him, would you just
[50:30] slip a hand up to him here tonight?
[50:32] Oh yes,
[50:35] it's Jesus
[50:38] I
[50:45] sing it with all of your heart now. Oh,
[50:49] it's Jesus.
[50:51] Oh, I really want to see.
[50:58] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[51:01] Oh, the more I see
[51:06] of this sorrowless
[51:11] it means to me.
[51:15] Oh, it's Jesus.
[51:19] Oh, I really
[51:22] want
[51:24] to see Jes.
[51:27] Oh, don't you love him tonight? Aren't
[51:30] you glad you can see him? It has been
[51:32] revealed to us in this hour by the word
[51:35] of the Lord. Amen. I I just want to say
[51:38] how special this night is for me as a
[51:41] pastor. I when I kind of on a whim
[51:44] invited brother Jason to come and then
[51:46] he said he would let out his service
[51:48] tonight. I it just was so uh such an
[51:52] honor for me to to be able to fellowship
[51:55] with brother Jason. Over the years I
[51:58] some of y'all that are here um you don't
[52:02] think of yourselves as old-timers but I
[52:04] do. When I came among you 25 years ago,
[52:08] I guess I I uh y'all welcomed me with
[52:12] open arms and was watching Brother Danny
[52:14] sing tonight. His precious daddy's gone
[52:16] on to be with the Lord, but brother Herb
[52:19] taught me to fish and here in this area
[52:22] and fish for trout and and uh people
[52:26] like that that we believe we're going to
[52:28] see him one of these days.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; If we see Jesus now, we're going to see
[52:32] our loved ones then. And you know,
[52:34] brother Brandham told us, he said he
[52:36] thought so much of us. He said he knew
[52:38] that we'd be wondering if our loved ones
[52:40] made it. So before we see him, we're
[52:43] going to get to see one another. We're
[52:45] going to get to see the people we've
[52:46] we've loved and that we knew. And I
[52:50] believe that day is coming.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; I believe it's real soon.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; This year, a lot has happened. Brother
[52:59] Brandham talked about a pope coming from
[53:01] America, from the United States that
[53:03] happened, I believe, this year was
[53:05] fulfilled. There's a second part to that
[53:07] quote. He talks about how the bride
[53:09] would come together and love one
[53:11] another. And I believe tonight we can
[53:13] fulfill our part of that.
[53:16] Maybe 2026 doesn't ever have to get here
[53:18] before the service is over. Maybe we can
[53:21] just all go home. Wouldn't that be
[53:22] wonderful? Wouldn't it be wonderful? I
[53:25] don't believe that's just a story. One
[53:26] of these days it's going to happen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; And when it does, I'm ready for it. What
[53:31] about you?
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you love him tonight? Do you
[53:34] love the Lord? Do you love one another
[53:36] tonight? Thank you so much for coming.
[53:38] We sure appreciate you being here
[53:41] tonight. Let's give our attention to the
[53:43] word as brother Jason Jackson comes. And
[53:46] the Jason and I have been friends, I
[53:47] guess, for 25, 30 years, something like
[53:50] that. And uh he was at my wedding and
[53:53] we've always been close. and I sure
[53:55] appreciate his friendship and it's an
[53:57] honor to have him speak here at the
[53:59] church for us. Just pray the Lord will
[54:01] use him tonight and and uh that he'll
[54:04] speak directly to us. Let's sing this
[54:06] once again. It's Jesus I really came to
[54:08] see as brother Jason comes tonight.
[54:11] Amen. Let's sing it now with all of our
[54:12] heart. Oh yes, it's Jesus.
[54:19] I really
[54:21] want
[54:22] you to see. Thank you, Lord. Oh, thank
[54:27] you, Jesus. Oh, it's Jesus.
[54:32] Oh, I really want
[54:36] to see.
[54:39] The more I see. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh,
[54:43] the more I see
[54:47] of this old world, oh, the less
[54:52] it means to me.
[54:56] Oh,
[54:57] Jesus.
[55:00] I really
[55:02] want to sing.
[55:08] Oh, yes,
[55:10] it's Jesus.
[55:14] I really
[55:16] want to see.
[55:22] Hallelujah.
[55:23] Oh, it's Jesus
[55:27] that I really
[55:30] want to see.
[55:37] And the more I see
[55:41] of this world,
[55:45] the less it mean to me.
[55:50] For is Jesus
[55:54] that I really
[55:57] want to see.
[56:02] I trust that's who you come to see
[56:04] tonight.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Not me, Lord. come to see him.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Let's just go to the Lord in prayer.
[56:10] Gracious heavenly father, we come to you
[56:12] now, Lord God, tonight. We we count it
[56:15] an honor, Lord, to be standing here
[56:18] behind the sacred desk, Lord, and
[56:22] remember the words of the prophet of God
[56:23] where he said, "We'd never be no closer
[56:26] to heaven than we are when we're
[56:28] standing behind this desk."
[56:32] No closer, Lord. No, we can't be any
[56:34] closer to you than just now. So Lord,
[56:37] let us take that, Lord. And don't just
[56:40] let it be behind this desk, Lord. Let it
[56:42] be down each aisle and around each
[56:45] person here tonight, Lord. And may you
[56:47] give us strength tonight, Lord God, just
[56:49] to get oursel out of the way. And may
[56:52] the Holy Spirit now come, Lord. May you
[56:54] minister to hearts. May you change
[56:56] lives, Lord. May you give us victory in
[56:58] our lives, Lord God. I pray. And may
[57:01] Lord you start an oldfashioned revival.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Lord may you start one here in Hardy.
[57:06] Lord
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Father and Worth. And God MAY IT JUST
[57:10] BLEED OUT INTO the neighborhoods. LORD
[57:13] BLEED OUT INTO our job sites and change
[57:16] lives around us. Lord God we come
[57:19] tonight not to see a man other than the
[57:22] Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord we know
[57:24] you're here. You promised you would be
[57:26] here where two or three would be
[57:27] gathered. Lord we're gathered in your
[57:29] name. We've invited you. We've sang the
[57:32] songs of Zion, Lord. We've we know
[57:34] you're here, God. So now, may you take
[57:36] the word, take the reading of the word,
[57:38] Lord. Take take the vessel, God. Get the
[57:40] vessel out of the way, Lord, that you
[57:42] could come minister to hearts and lives.
[57:44] We pray now. We give you all the glory,
[57:46] honor, and praise. Thank you for it in
[57:49] Jesus Christ's name. And the saints of
[57:51] God said,
[57:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen. Good to see everyone
[57:55] tonight. and and uh
[57:59] good crowd, brother Ben.
[58:01] Real good Wednesday night crowd. Yes,
[58:03] sir.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Took two churches to get it, but
[58:06] we got it.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly appreciate Brother Ben's
[58:11] invite. And uh we've known him for a
[58:14] long long time. I don't know how many
[58:15] years. He said 25 or 30 years. That's
[58:17] that's quite possible. we were pretty
[58:19] young and we was reminiscing about a
[58:22] time and I won't tell all the story but
[58:24] reminiscing about a time when we went to
[58:26] a uh took the young people from our
[58:28] church to Eureka Springs to see the
[58:30] Passion play and uh me and brother Ben
[58:34] we seen this church at the top of the
[58:35] hill and there was a bunch of cars there
[58:37] so we thought we'd go check it out and
[58:40] they were practicing church
[58:43] &gt;&gt; it was a biker church I think it was
[58:45] they were practicing for the service and
[58:48] when they kindly dismissed I, brother
[58:50] Ben said that I act like I got a phone
[58:53] call and we hight tailed it out of there
[58:54] and ran down the hill. But uh it was
[58:57] very odd.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And we were thankful to to u for the
[59:01] message of the hour.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that we don't have to come and
[59:05] practice church,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; we come and live church.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles this
[59:12] evening, I'd like to turn to Psalms
[59:15] chapter 27 and verse 5 and then Matthew
[59:18] chap 7 and verse 24.
[59:28] Brother Ben used to preach at our church
[59:30] when he was young a whole lot
[59:33] &gt;&gt; when we were younger and then when he
[59:34] got a little older when he was at
[59:35] brother Ivy's he'd come up and preach
[59:36] for us and and uh it's just good to be
[59:41] together again in church that where we
[59:43] can press the battle
[59:45] &gt;&gt; and try to get out of here. Maybe 2026
[59:49] will be the year of the rapture.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; The finishing of the rapture.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Be wonderful.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; For in the time of trouble, he shall
[59:58] hide me in his pavilion. In the secret
[1:00:01] of his tabernacle shall he hide me. He
[1:00:04] shall set me upon a rock.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Or a revelation.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 7 verse 24.
[1:00:13] If you don't mind me taking my jacket
[1:00:15] off, it's
[1:00:18] but warm.
[1:00:24] People in my church complain about being
[1:00:25] cold.
[1:00:28] That's no joke.
[1:00:31] Matthew 20 Matthew 7 and 24. Therefore,
[1:00:34] whosoever heareth these sayings of mine
[1:00:36] and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise
[1:00:38] man, which built this house upon a rock.
[1:00:41] And the rain descended, and the floods
[1:00:43] came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
[1:00:46] that house, and it fell not, for it was
[1:00:48] founded upon a rock.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Excuse me. And everyone that heareth
[1:00:53] these sayings of mine, and doeth them
[1:00:55] not, shall be likened unto a foolish
[1:00:57] man, which built this house upon the
[1:00:59] sand. And the rain descended, and the
[1:01:01] floods came, and the winds blew, and
[1:01:04] beat upon that house, and it fell, and
[1:01:07] great was the fall of it. May the Lord
[1:01:10] Jesus add his blessing tonight. You can
[1:01:12] be seated.
[1:01:19] Thank you for all the specials tonight.
[1:01:21] And thank you, Sister Anna, for that
[1:01:24] last song.
[1:01:26] It goes with what I'm speaking on, Lord
[1:01:28] willing. And I want to speak tonight if
[1:01:31] I can on the winds of change.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And somebody had asked me today, they
[1:01:38] said, "Well, are you you're going to
[1:01:39] have to preach a different thought than
[1:01:40] what you normally preach. Uh you can't
[1:01:43] you can't warm one up cuz half your
[1:01:46] church will be there." I said, "Well,
[1:01:47] I'm not warming one up." I was actually
[1:01:50] driving down the road the other day and
[1:01:52] Brother Jimmy, where are you at? Right
[1:01:53] there you are. you actually mentioned
[1:01:55] this title to me when brother Bryce
[1:01:57] Collins was at the church and the wind
[1:01:59] was really blowing hard outside and I
[1:02:01] gave him the title and he said well I
[1:02:03] was going to write down the winds of
[1:02:04] change but I'll go with his title
[1:02:06] instead and as I was driving down the
[1:02:08] road a couple of weeks ago after brother
[1:02:09] Ben had asked me to preach this thought
[1:02:11] just struck in my head and I I started
[1:02:14] studying and and you know the scripture
[1:02:16] here talks ABOUT THAT WE HAD TO BE BUILT
[1:02:18] ON A ROCK
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD TELL US
[1:02:21] THAT A ROCK IS A REVELATION
[1:02:24] AND JESUS HERE IN THE SCRIPTURE was
[1:02:26] actually speaking of A STORM WHICH WAS
[1:02:30] GOING TO STRIKE. THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:02:32] "EVERY MAN and woman that's born in the
[1:02:34] world, THERE IS NO WAY OUT OF IT. NO WAY
[1:02:38] OF ESCAPE. WE ALL WILL HAVE A STORM TO
[1:02:42] STRIKE US
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; SOMETIME OR ANOTHER."
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. AND IT JUST DEPENDS ON
[1:02:48] WHAT KIND OF FOUNDATION YOU HAVE WHETHER
[1:02:51] YOUR HOUSE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAND
[1:02:53] IT OR NOT.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; I say, LORD, LET ME BE UPON THE SOLID
[1:02:57] ROCK. THE REVELATION OF MALACHI 4'S
[1:03:00] MESSAGE.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; LET ME BE IN THIS WORD.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; A PART OF IT.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Pardon me. Brother Ben said I didn't
[1:03:07] need monitors, so I didn't I don't mean
[1:03:10] to scream. It's just who I is. Come on.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN MANY LIVES
[1:03:16] SAVED BY preparations for storms.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WINDS COME, and we
[1:03:23] we've had a lot of wind lately, and it
[1:03:26] changes the weather,
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; AND IT BRINGS A CHANGE. WHEN FALL BEGINS
[1:03:30] TO COME, a lot of wind comes and the
[1:03:33] leaves fall. AND WIND IS ALWAYS BRINGING
[1:03:36] SOMETHING BEHIND IT OF A CHANGE. Come
[1:03:39] on.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU'RE MADE, IF YOU'RE PREPARED
[1:03:42] FOR WHAT'S COMING, THEN YOU CAN SURVIVE
[1:03:45] WHAT IS COMING BEHIND IT.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, MANY LIVES ARE LOST BECAUSE
[1:03:50] OF FAILING TO TAKE HEED TO THE WARNING
[1:03:52] OF THE STORMS.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. BROTHER tells us of the story,
[1:03:56] and most of us probably know it, and if
[1:03:58] you don't, I'll just skip through it for
[1:04:00] a moment, of what happened in Florida
[1:04:02] one time.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; There was a great, he called it a
[1:04:05] typhoon. We know it today as hurricanes.
[1:04:08] that was fixing to sweep the land and
[1:04:10] and they were TOLD BY THEIR WEATHER
[1:04:13] PROPHETS THAT IT WAS COMING.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; I thought that was kind of astounding.
[1:04:16] Brother Ben, Brother Brandham called
[1:04:18] them weather prophets
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY COULD LOOK OUT AND SEE
[1:04:21] SOMETHING.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; BY WHAT INTELLIGENCE THEY HAD GIVEN TO
[1:04:25] THEM BY SCIENCE. AND WE'VE HAD PROPHET
[1:04:29] IN THIS DAY WHO DIDN'T HAVE NEED
[1:04:31] SCIENCE, BUT HE HAD THE EYES OF ALMIGHTY
[1:04:34] GOD TO LOOK INTO THE WORD AND BRING A
[1:04:37] REVELATION
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; FOR US TO STAND UPON THE ROCK.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, buddy.
[1:04:47] Is that your kid, Joel? He's a He's
[1:04:50] going to be a backer.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; I love it when the kids start helping.
[1:04:57] Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; So they had this storm coming and and he
[1:05:00] said, "I'm told the weather prophets,
[1:05:02] you know, you they were telling them how
[1:05:03] it was all going to happen and and then
[1:05:05] by calling ahead, they heard all the
[1:05:07] storms and the wind that was coming and
[1:05:08] when a hurricane comes in, it actually
[1:05:10] sucks up the water that is in the ocean
[1:05:13] or that is in was in this case was in
[1:05:15] partly in Lake Okachchobee and
[1:05:19] and and it takes a higher wind
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; to turn the storm." The prophet said,
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; "So, the storm was coming, BUT IF
[1:05:27] THERE'S NOT A HIGHER WIND TO COME
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; TO TURN THE ONCOMING STORM, THEN YOU'RE
[1:05:32] going to meet it head on."
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, "SO IS IT TODAY."
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; AND WE ALL KNOW THERE'S AN ONCOMING
[1:05:41] STORM. HE SAID, "AND THE ONLY WIND THAT
[1:05:43] I KNOW THAT CAN TURN THE STORM WILL BE A
[1:05:46] RUSHING WIND THAT FELL ON THE DAY OF
[1:05:48] PENTECOST. THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT
[1:05:50] CAN SAVE US
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; IN THIS HOUR.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; SO, THE STORM, YOU KNOW, WAS RAGING and
[1:05:57] the neighbor, one of them was a
[1:05:58] Christian man, a devout Christian, well
[1:06:01] known in his area, and he had uh he'd
[1:06:04] heard the weather. So, he went over to
[1:06:05] his neighbor
[1:06:08] who was a chicken farmer and he said,
[1:06:11] "Gather all your chickens, put them in
[1:06:12] your storm shelter, and come to mine."
[1:06:14] He said, "There's a storm coming." He
[1:06:16] said, "I ain't got time for that. I'm
[1:06:18] trying to make a living.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Watch now. He's got a warning.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OH, THERE'S BEEN WARNINGS AND
[1:06:24] WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND
[1:06:26] THERE'S BEEN TOLD US THERE WERE STORMS
[1:06:27] COMING BEFORE AND STORMS NEVER CAME." HE
[1:06:29] SAID, "BUT WHAT IF IT DOES COME?"
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; OH MY,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; BROTHER. LISTEN, WE'VE BEEN BEING TOLD
[1:06:35] FOR 30, 40 YEARS THAT THE RAPTURE'S
[1:06:37] COMING AND IT MIGHT COME THE NEXT YEAR.
[1:06:39] WHAT IF IT DOES COME?
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT COMES IN 2026? ARE WE GOING
[1:06:44] TO BE READY?
[1:06:46] YEAH, that's it.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, if you're not going to
[1:06:50] come, at least let your family come." He
[1:06:52] said, "I'll have you to know my family's
[1:06:53] going to do exactly what I tell them."
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the bread winner. They're my wife's
[1:06:58] going to do what I tell her. The kids
[1:06:59] are going to do what I tell them. So, he
[1:07:02] pretty much ran the old guy off. And he
[1:07:03] gets home. And
[1:07:06] there's a lot of people still like that
[1:07:07] today.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; I remember a sermon one time, Brother
[1:07:10] Danny Steam preached for us, and it was
[1:07:12] hearkening to thy wife Sarah. It's what
[1:07:15] God told Abraham. Sometimes it's good to
[1:07:17] listen to your wife
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; as long as it ain't contrary to the
[1:07:20] word.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Well, that was for whoever.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT DOES HAPPEN? WHAT IF THERE IS
[1:07:28] A STORM COMING?
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT BLOWS AWAY YOUR CHICKEN
[1:07:31] HOUSE? WHAT IF IT BLOWS AWAY YOUR
[1:07:32] FAMILY? THIS MAN WAS ONLY CONCERNED
[1:07:36] ABOUT HIS SELFISH MOTIVES.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIS WIFE. HE
[1:07:41] WAS NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN.
[1:07:44] IF HE HAD HAVE BEEN, HE WOULD HAVE
[1:07:45] HEEDED THE WARNING.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; So the neighbor, he has to turn and
[1:07:49] leave. And before you know it, the storm
[1:07:51] struck.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "And all of a
[1:07:54] sudden, the clouds was up on him before
[1:07:56] they knew it." He said, "That's the way
[1:07:57] judgment strikes.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S ON YOU BEFORE YOU EVEN know it."
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you might laugh at THE
[1:08:06] MESSENGER AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO KILL
[1:08:08] HIM, BUT YOU CANNOT KILL THE MESSAGE."
[1:08:10] COME ON.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THEY MAY HAVE BROUGHT THEY MAY
[1:08:13] HAVE TRIED TO CRITICIZE BROTHER
[1:08:15] BRANDHAM. THEY MAY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE
[1:08:16] WEBSITES AGAINST HIM. THEY'VE TRIED TO
[1:08:18] DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DISCREDIT HIM.
[1:08:21] BUT YOU CAN'T KILL THE MESSAGE.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Message lives.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; I had a man challenge me a younger guy
[1:08:34] one time. He was starting to question
[1:08:37] me. You know, he sent me all this text
[1:08:39] about all this bunch of nonsense and
[1:08:43] I said, "I ain't got time for it."
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you afraid of it?" I said,
[1:08:46] "I'm not afraid of anything you've got,
[1:08:49] buddy.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Not afraid of none of the questions."
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; But I ain't here to ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS AN UNBELIEVER
[1:08:58] TRYING to bring TRYING TO DOING NOTHING
[1:09:00] BUT BRINGING A REPROACH
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; AND TRYING TO BRING DOWN WHAT I BELIEVE.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THAT. THE
[1:09:06] WORD WILL DEFEND ITSELF,
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO DEFEND THIS MESSAGE. GOD
[1:09:12] DEFENDS THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR,
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; SO, I took my little phone and I went
[1:09:20] block
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; ain't got time to entertain the devil.
[1:09:30] Right.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Had a pastor friend one time, brother
[1:09:34] Jason, my daughters, they got questions
[1:09:35] about all these things on, you know, all
[1:09:37] that junk. And I said, you ain't got all
[1:09:39] the answers for it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; THIS IS A FAITH WALK.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, SOMEWHERE ANOTHER, YOU
[1:09:47] GOT TO GET A REVELATION UPON THE ROCK
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; THAT IT DON'T MATTER WHAT ANYBODY ELSE
[1:09:52] SAYS. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT ANY WEBSITE
[1:09:54] SAYS. IT MATTERS WHAT DID THUS SAYETH
[1:09:57] THE LORD SAY.
[1:10:01] YOU CAN KILL THE MESSAGE, but you can
[1:10:03] kill the messenger. You can't kill the
[1:10:04] message.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; It'll go on just the same. GOD'S MESSAGE
[1:10:08] IS ETERNAL.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; AND HIS WORDS NEVER FAIL.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; PAUL WAS SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING STEPHVEN
[1:10:18] STONE,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; but all through his life, he
[1:10:21] surrendered. When he until he
[1:10:23] surrendered to Christ was he he was
[1:10:25] never able to get away from that
[1:10:27] message. Come on.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; When Steven said, "I see heavens open."
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And I see Jesus sitting at the right
[1:10:34] HAND OF GOD,
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; THAT HAUNTED HIM UNTIL HE GAVE HIS LIFE
[1:10:38] TO GOD.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, SOMETHING HAD TO GET A
[1:10:42] HOLD OF HIM. AND IT WASN'T THE
[1:10:43] MESSENGER, IT WAS THE MESSAGE.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; SO, while the storms are sweeping on and
[1:10:53] the country and caught the guy's chicken
[1:10:55] house and blew it away and blew him away
[1:10:57] and they never found his body, his wife
[1:10:59] was frantic and fighting and she she got
[1:11:03] up on top of the roof of her house, her
[1:11:04] and her kids, and you know, she was
[1:11:06] there on Lake Okachchobee. And the lake
[1:11:09] itself is the deepest part is only nine
[1:11:11] foot deep. It's about average of three
[1:11:13] or four feet
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; and it's massive. one of the biggest
[1:11:17] natural lakes there are. And and uh
[1:11:20] there's lots of the rocks and everything
[1:11:23] else sticking up and and don't ask me
[1:11:25] how I know that. I happened to hit a
[1:11:28] pile of them one time in a rented boat.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:35] But there's always danger where you
[1:11:37] don't expect it sometimes.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; And here a man is warning a MAN OF
[1:11:41] ONCOMING DANGER AND HE REJECTS the
[1:11:44] warning. AND THEN HIS WIFE IS CAUGHT ON
[1:11:46] TOP OF THE ROOF WITH ALL OF HER KIDS.
[1:11:48] AND THEN BROTHER TELLS A STORY THAT
[1:11:50] COTTON MOUSE OR MOXICANS BEGAN TO BITE
[1:11:52] THE CHILDREN UNTIL THEY DIED. AND THEN
[1:11:54] THEY BIT HER UP UNTIL SHE DIED. AND THEY
[1:11:56] FOUND THEIR BODIES LAYING TOGETHER ON
[1:11:58] THE ROOF.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T TAKE A WARNING.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE, LISTEN CHURCH, BEFORE YOU
[1:12:09] CAN BE SAVED, THERE HAS TO BE A WARNING.
[1:12:12] THERE HAS TO BE A PREPARATION MADE FOR
[1:12:14] YOUR SAFETY OR THERE'S NO NEED OF
[1:12:16] SENDING OUT THE WARNING.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; AND THE WARNING IS ONLY A VOICE OF ONE
[1:12:22] HAVING YOU TO PREPARE FOR THE DANGER.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Then you have to make the choice.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Either you believe it,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; the warning or you ignore it.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. Do
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; you remember brother said I went back
[1:12:37] and forth across this land preaching the
[1:12:39] gospel over and over and over and he was
[1:12:40] blasting bobbed women and and he would
[1:12:42] blast them and he'd come back and he go
[1:12:44] well it's worse this year than it was
[1:12:46] last year.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; LISTEN CHURCH, WE OUGHT TO BE FURTHER
[1:12:49] THAN THAT UP THE ROAD.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; OUR CHURCHES OUGHT TO BE GETTING BETTER
[1:12:54] YEAR BY YEAR, BROTHER BEN, AND NOT WORSE
[1:12:56] YEAR. I TRUST THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
[1:12:58] TONIGHT IS WE'RE GETTING STRONGER AND
[1:13:00] STRONGER AND MORE READY TO LEAVE THIS
[1:13:03] WORLD. AMEN.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; You're either going to be a believer or
[1:13:10] an unbeliever. That's
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Or Brother Jason, what about the
[1:13:12] makebeliever? He's an unbeliever, too.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; He just make beliefs for a while.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; You can't be both.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Or one or the other.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; The problem is is we got too much
[1:13:26] profession without a possession.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; We got too many saying it and not enough
[1:13:30] living it. Right?
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; We got too many practice sermons and not
[1:13:33] enough live sermons.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; It'd be a lot BETTER IF WE LIVED OUR
[1:13:37] SERMON AND THEN EACH ONE OF US WOULD BE
[1:13:39] A MINISTER. FOR THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE
[1:13:42] ARE WRITTEN EPISTLES READ OF ALL MEN.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; LISTEN. AND ONCE WE'VE BEEN WARNED,
[1:13:47] THERE'S AN ONCOMING STORM. THE WINDS ARE
[1:13:50] HIGHLY.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; MAN JUST TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE
[1:13:53] CHANGES WE SEEN IN 2025 WITH A NEW POPE
[1:13:56] AND things
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; and a lot of other things. Uh-huh.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Perversion
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; like crazy.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; The wind's blowing.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; There's changes happening.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Which side of the fence YOU GOING TO
[1:14:14] FALL ON?
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; HUH? The winds ARE HOWLING IN THIS VERY
[1:14:17] HOUR. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
[1:14:19] UNCERTAINTY EVERYWHERE.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE SHOULDN'T BE UNCERTAINTY IN
[1:14:23] THE CHURCH.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; THIS OUGHT TO BE A PLACE WE CAN TIE DOWN
[1:14:28] TO. LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE WIND MAY KNOCK
[1:14:31] YOU DOWN IN A BLOWDOWN.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; BUT THOUGH YOU'RE IN THE BLOWDOWN,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT A CHATTER CHATTER PINE
[1:14:44] SQUIRREL.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; OH, NO. YOU'RE AN EAGLE AND YOU'RE NOT
[1:14:49] BORN TO BE IN THE BLOWDOWN.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You're born to soar in the heavens.
[1:14:55] Right.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; And when you get in a blowdown
[1:14:59] sometimes,
[1:15:01] Brother Harvey, you've been in blowdowns
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; out in Colorado. Some of you that's
[1:15:05] hunted out there, you can't walk through
[1:15:08] them.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; You can't hardly get around them.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; There trees just falling everywhere and
[1:15:13] you can't make your way through it.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "I was standing there
[1:15:17] and he said, I I looked around." Most of
[1:15:20] you probably know this story, but
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; it's good.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It's good. Come on.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I I just began looking
[1:15:28] around and looking at all the great
[1:15:30] things of God and and I just began
[1:15:32] shouting."
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I and a rainstorm blew
[1:15:35] IN AND I GOT BEHIND A TREE, BROTHER."
[1:15:38] AND I WAS SITTING THERE AND I WAS HIDING
[1:15:39] BEHIND THE TREE AND HE SAID, "ALL OF A
[1:15:41] SUDDEN, THE WINDS BE
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; WIND BLOWS AND BLOWS THE STORM OUT AND
[1:15:46] THE SUN BEGINS TO SHINE." AND HE SAID,
[1:15:48] "THE BEAUTIFUL MOST BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW
[1:15:51] BEGIN TO COME ACROSS THE VALLEY."
[1:15:53] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE
[1:15:54] AND SEEN THOSE, BUT THERE'S AIN'T
[1:15:56] NOTHING LIKE IT
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE STANDING THERE LOOKING
[1:15:58] ACROSS THE VALLEY AND THERE'S SUCH A
[1:16:00] PEACE THAT COMES DOWN AND THERE'S
[1:16:02] RAINBOW. WE HAD THAT HAPPEN ABOUT TWO OR
[1:16:04] THREE YEARS ago in Colorado and I just
[1:16:06] sat there
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; and you just have to weep.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I got I didn't get
[1:16:15] quite as excited as he did.
[1:16:18] It'd have been good to have probably,
[1:16:20] but I'd probably scared the other three
[1:16:22] guys to death.
[1:16:25] Brother B said, "I looked out there and
[1:16:26] I seen that rainbow and he said I was
[1:16:29] half Indian. Anyhow, my mother was a
[1:16:31] half breed and he said I had that Indian
[1:16:32] but in me and he said something began
[1:16:35] screaming out on the inside and I heard
[1:16:37] the old greywolf howl and I heard his
[1:16:39] mate howl down in the valley AND I
[1:16:41] COULDN'T STOP FROM CRYING
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I SEEN GOD EVERYWHERE." AND HE
[1:16:46] SAID, "AS I BEGIN TO SHOUT AROUND THE
[1:16:48] TREE," AND THEN I'D STOP AND THEN I'D
[1:16:49] SHOUT, ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD SOMETHING
[1:16:52] CHATTERING.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; We don't need none of this screaming.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; We don't need none of this shouting,
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; chitter chatter.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, you get the young people too worked
[1:17:09] up.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Well, you get them worked up at A BALL
[1:17:12] GAME.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THEM IN CHURCH. WE'RE GOING TO
[1:17:15] LET THE SPIRIT WORK THEM UP. WE'RE NOT
[1:17:16] WORKING THEM UP BY MUSIC. WE WANT THE
[1:17:18] SPIRIT OF GOD TO FALL DOWN UPON THEIR
[1:17:21] LIVES AND FOREVER CHANGE THEM.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Jason, I've seen people get too
[1:17:29] wild. And
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I ain't ever
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; I ain't ever seen anybody in here get
[1:17:38] too wild.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. I've seen people shout
[1:17:44] that ain't never shouted before since.
[1:17:46] And when I see that, I say, "Yep, that's
[1:17:48] God."
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Fall down on a person. We was at youth
[1:17:51] camp one year and there was a wind come
[1:17:52] through that building. Some of you kids
[1:17:54] were probably there. And all of a
[1:17:55] sudden, young man from Florida, he takes
[1:17:57] off running around the building. The
[1:17:58] next thing I know, there's a lady
[1:18:00] standing beside me and she went to
[1:18:01] dancing.
[1:18:03] And I just blocked the aisle
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; and let her dance.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; Couple others in front of us got to
[1:18:09] dancing. The power of God begin moving,
[1:18:12] begin changing. There's a wind. YOU
[1:18:14] COULD LITERALLY FEEL SOMETHING GO
[1:18:16] THROUGH THE BUILDING.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU, CHURCH, IT'S NOT JUST A
[1:18:20] WIND ON THE OUTSIDE. THERE'S A HOLY
[1:18:22] GHOST WIND THAT OUGHT TO BE FLOWING IN
[1:18:24] OUR LIVES.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; IT OUGHT TO GIVE US SOMETHING TO SHOUT
[1:18:30] ABOUT.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody, you know, we you know,
[1:18:35] you got too much noise.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; It hurts my ears.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Come on. They got earbuds, ear earplugs
[1:18:42] and things of that nature. If your ears
[1:18:44] are sensitive, we
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; get you some.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Help you.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; But don't try shutting down the moving
[1:18:52] of the spirit.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz not everybody shouts like I get
[1:18:55] loud. Some people's quiet. Some people
[1:18:57] just raise their hand.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I used to watch my dad worship. He'd sit
[1:19:00] over in my far right corner. He just
[1:19:02] raised his hands and tears just streamed
[1:19:04] down his eyes.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That was as good to me as to
[1:19:08] run the aisles and swung from the fans
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; cuz I knew there WAS SOMETHING GENUINE.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
[1:19:15] TALKING ABOUT. IF SOMEBODY GETS EXCITED
[1:19:17] IS WHO CARES IF IT'S GENUINE, LET THEM
[1:19:19] SHOUT.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; AND I AIN'T THE JUDGE IF IT'S GENUINE.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Truth, sir.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to go there, but anyhow,
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the wind blowing.
[1:19:34] Yeah.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; There's a change happening.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; I'm trying not to go down a rabbit
[1:19:41] trail, but
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the Lord kind of directs you
[1:19:47] ways. You just have to kind of follow.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandon was up
[1:19:50] there in that forest and it was burnt
[1:19:52] over and he said he got out there and he
[1:19:53] was riding on the horse and he got off
[1:19:55] and he heard all those old trees. They
[1:19:57] begin to creek and moan.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; An old weary
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; sound.
[1:20:07] He goes, "This days of miracles are
[1:20:09] passed.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; There's no more healing."
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Hey, he was kindly feeling a little
[1:20:17] depressed.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; No doubt. HE'S LOOKING AT ALL THAT, BUT
[1:20:20] HE SAID, "ALL OF A SUDDEN, I LOOK DOWN
[1:20:22] UNDERNEATH AT THE UNDERGROWTH."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; If you've ever seen A FORCE BURN OVER,
[1:20:26] YOU SEE THE UNDERGROWTH WILL BEGIN TO
[1:20:28] GROW IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE. AND HE
[1:20:30] SAID, "I NOTICED WHEN THAT SAME WIND
[1:20:32] WOULD GO THROUGH THERE, THAT UNDERGROWTH
[1:20:34] WOULD BEGIN TO THEY BEGIN TO WAVE AND
[1:20:37] THEY WERE FROLICKING IN THE HOLY
[1:20:39] SPIRIT."
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; GOD, LET OUR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE
[1:20:45] AT A REVIVAL.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; The prophet said it would be that way.
[1:20:53] So, we just believe that's how it's
[1:20:55] going to be.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; And I just believe they're catching it.
[1:20:59] Come on.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUNG PEOPLE CATCHING IT.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; THERE'S YOUNG PEOPLE WHO LOVE TO BE AT
[1:21:05] CHURCH. THEY SIT ON THE FRONT ROWS OR
[1:21:07] SECOND ROWS AND THEY'RE NOT BACK THERE
[1:21:09] ON THE BACK ROW OUT THE BACK DOOR.
[1:21:11] LISTEN THAT.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SIT THERE. BUT IT
[1:21:15] AIN'T GOT TO BE ME OR THE YOUNG PEOPLE.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, brother Stewart. I ain't
[1:21:19] preaching at you, buddy.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; There's a place for it.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; But you GOT MEN LIKE THIS SITTING ON THE
[1:21:25] FRONT.
[1:21:27] Come on. Come on now. Huh?
[1:21:29] Don't get nervous. I ain't decided to
[1:21:31] use you yet.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; They going they got something to be
[1:21:38] happy about. Yes,
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Some of us are like, "Well, you know,
[1:21:41] when I when I when I first got saved, I
[1:21:43] jumped and shouted." Well, what does
[1:21:45] hinder you now?
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; WHAT CHANGED?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; DID THE WORD CHANGE OR DID GOD CHANGE OR
[1:21:51] DID YOU CHANGE?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I'LL TELL YOU WHAT DIDN'T CHANGE. HE IS
[1:21:55] THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER.
[1:21:58] AND HIS WORD DON'T EVER CHANGE. THANK
[1:22:01] YOU,
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; LORD.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; SO, I began wondering, what's that
[1:22:03] little chitter chattered pine squirrel
[1:22:05] doing?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I looked over there and I seen
[1:22:10] this great big eagle in a blowdown."
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Yep.
[1:22:19] He said, "That's why he seen that
[1:22:21] eagle." And he said, "And that eagle
[1:22:24] just looked at him. And then the eagle
[1:22:26] jumped up on the branch and he looked at
[1:22:27] me and he said, I said, "You know what,
[1:22:29] God? Why did you stop me from shouting
[1:22:32] to look at this eagle?"
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I began to admire him because
[1:22:36] he had courage."
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, YEAH.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; LIKE ALL GOD'S children's got.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T FEAR HIM. HE SAID, "DON'T YOU
[1:22:42] KNOW, LITTLE EAGLE? I COULD SHOOT YOU
[1:22:44] BEFORE YOU COULD LEAVE." And the eagle
[1:22:46] just kept pulling on his wings.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; And he said, "And I wondered, what did
[1:22:52] you stop me for?"
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, "All of a sudden, God
[1:22:55] showed me."
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; When he was pulling at those wings, he
[1:22:59] was trusting in the gift that God had
[1:23:02] given him.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT A RIFLE. HE
[1:23:07] WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT A CHATTERING
[1:23:08] SQUIRREL. HE WAS TRUSTING IN THE GIFT
[1:23:11] GOD HAD GIVEN HIM.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT YOU AND I GOT TO DO WHEN
[1:23:15] YOU'RE IN A BLOW. NOW, TRUST IN WHAT
[1:23:17] GOD'S GIVEN YOU.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Lord J. God didn't give me no gift. You
[1:23:22] got the Holy Ghost. That is a gift.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "And all of a sudden, that
[1:23:30] eagle got tired of looking at me.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; He flopped his wings
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; twice."
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Tuck off through the woods.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Never had to hit his wings again. And he
[1:23:41] said he just begin soaring. And he'd
[1:23:43] catch a wave of wind and he'd soar a
[1:23:45] little higher. And he'd catch another
[1:23:47] wave of wind.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. And he just kept
[1:23:50] soaring a little higher. And he set HIS
[1:23:52] WINGS TO THE WIND OF FAITH.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; G
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN SOARING UP INTO THE
[1:23:57] HEAVENLIES.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, JESUS.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; HE LEFT ALL THE EARTHBOUND CHATTER.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Well, don't you know?
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Our message church is better than yours.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on now.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Come here, brother.
[1:24:22] we're going to go to this one or this
[1:24:24] one because they're better. Well, let me
[1:24:26] just tell you something. You go wherever
[1:24:27] you want to go. We really we don't care.
[1:24:29] We've done talked about this. We don't
[1:24:31] mind where you go to church.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; So, as long as you go
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; because we got one thing in mind. That's
[1:24:37] to make you AND US IN THE GLORY.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; IS THAT RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; WE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WE
[1:24:44] WANT A UNITY CUZ HOW BLESSED IS IT WHEN
[1:24:47] BROTHERS CAN DWELL TOGETHER IN THE
[1:24:49] SPIRIT OF UNITY.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE OIL.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you very
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; We're one big family.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You might be in Hardy and I might be at
[1:25:03] worth. We're still family.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; You know why? We're not family of Ben.
[1:25:07] We're not family of Jason. We're family
[1:25:09] of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:11] So, DON'T LET THE CHATTER
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; CHATTER STARTS IN CHURCHES.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's good.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I don't know what goes on here. They
[1:25:22] didn't tell me.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; But I know humans.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; And we all battle the same bite fights.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; And this one,
[1:25:32] listen, let me just tell you something.
[1:25:35] We're one. And there ain't one person in
[1:25:38] this building that I wouldn't want to
[1:25:39] set across from the marriage supper of
[1:25:41] the lamb with.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; I don't KNOW OF ONE PERSON ON THE ENTIRE
[1:25:44] PLANET THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO SET
[1:25:46] ACROSS FROM THE MARRIAGE supper of the
[1:25:47] lamb with.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; I told my church a couple of years ago,
[1:25:51] I think it was, I SAID, "WE DON'T KNOW.
[1:25:53] MAYBE GOD SAVED ADOLF HITLER before he
[1:25:55] died. AND IF HE DID, I WOULDN'T CARE TO
[1:25:57] SIT ACROSS THE TABLE WITH HIM. I DON'T
[1:25:59] CARE. SO, AS LONG AS WE MAKE IT,
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; come on." Yeah.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; COME ON. PRAISE.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; FLY UP, LITTLE BRIDE.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; DON'T LISTEN TO ALL THE GOSSIP OF THE
[1:26:14] WORLD. LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE WORD.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. GOOD.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; And the word says right away above every
[1:26:21] wave that comes. Just move up. Raise up
[1:26:24] higher.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Higher. And just move out.
[1:26:31] I know it's the conditions of late Oian
[1:26:33] age that we live in that we're not
[1:26:34] supposed to be a part of, but we're in
[1:26:36] it
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; that knocks us down in the blowdowns.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; You lose your job.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; you get knocked down.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; You lose your health sometimes and you
[1:26:49] get knocked down. Yeah,
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; you might lose a loved one sometimes and
[1:26:53] you get your feet knocked down after you
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; and you're laying there and you're
[1:26:57] thinking, "God, do you do you even love
[1:26:58] me anymore?" Let me tell you,
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; he loves you.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; His love is not by how
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; by how much you're BLESSED HERE
[1:27:07] NATURALLY. HIS LOVE IS THROUGH ELECTION.
[1:27:10] HE ELECTED YOU. THEREFORE, HE CALLED
[1:27:12] YOU. HE CHOSE YOU. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
[1:27:15] HIS LOVE IS BECAUSE HE SAID SO.
[1:27:21] IT DOESN'T MATTER NECESSARILY HOW I FEEL
[1:27:24] ABOUT IT.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; I JUST NEED TO START SOARING AGAIN.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; OH, there's times I
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; How many in here's ever fell in a
[1:27:34] blowdown
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; spiritually? Okay,
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I know most of you hadn't naturally
[1:27:38] spiritually.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; You've been down in there
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; and you're struggling and some of you
[1:27:42] struggling right now.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; You don't know where you're going to go.
[1:27:45] Your your mind is tormented. LET ME JUST
[1:27:47] TELL YOU, THERE IS A MAN HERE
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; WHO CAN TURN ON THE LIGHT.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A MAN HERE WHO CAN DRIVE OUT
[1:27:53] THE ENEMY. THERE'S A MAN HERE WHO CAN
[1:27:56] PUT THE DEVIL ON A FLEA.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And there's a man here who wants to give
[1:28:01] you a testimony in 2026 that it'll be
[1:28:05] greater than your testimony in 2025.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Good.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Read you this quote out of the oncoming
[1:28:12] storm.
[1:28:17] Prophet said, "We need some good
[1:28:19] old-fashioned backwood preachers
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; that's got the Holy Spirit."
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT AFRAID TO PREACH THE GOSPEL
[1:28:24] WITH bare hands
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; and not cover up with some kind of a
[1:28:27] rubber glove,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; BUT PREACH THE COMING OF THE LORD Jesus
[1:28:31] and judgment for THE WICKED AND HEAVEN
[1:28:33] FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND THE NEAR
[1:28:34] APPROACHING.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT SEASON?
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Season of change.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW. NO ONE ELSE KNOWS. BUT
[1:28:44] I'LL WARN MY generation if it comes now.
[1:28:47] I want them to be warned. And if the
[1:28:49] prophet wanted his generation to war be
[1:28:51] warned, we ought to want our generation
[1:28:52] to be warned.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Lot was warned.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE GOT THE MESSAGE FROM THE
[1:28:58] ANGEL. HE WAS WARNED.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF THE SINFUL PLACE. AND JESUS
[1:29:02] Christ compared Sodom to this day.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; To this very day.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Sinful.
[1:29:13] Oh, what we need is somebody to call
[1:29:16] people back to the word,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; BACK TO THE GOSPEL OF THIS HOUR, NOT
[1:29:21] BACK TO A DENOMINATION. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:29:23] SOMETHING, CHURCH. You can belong to
[1:29:24] every denomination IN THE PLANET. IT
[1:29:26] WILL NOT SAVE YOU. YOU CAN GO TO EVERY
[1:29:28] CAMP MEETING. IT WILL NOT SAVE YOU. I
[1:29:30] LIKE GOING. YOU CAN GO TO EVERY CHURCH
[1:29:32] SERVICE. IT WILL NOT SAVE YOU. BUT WHAT
[1:29:34] WILL SAVE YOU IS WHEN YOU MEET JESUS
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; FACE TO FACE.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; He changes you.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; He gives you victory. He gives you hope.
[1:29:47] He gives you peace.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; We need to call on him in the middle of
[1:29:52] the storm.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; In the MIDDLE OF THIS STORM, WE NEED
[1:29:54] STABILITY.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; WE NEED PEOPLE WHO'S NOT WISHY-WASHY.
[1:29:59] BROTHER, WE NEED CHURCH MEMBERS AND
[1:30:01] PREACHERS AND PASTORS WHO'S NOT
[1:30:03] WISHY-WASHY, BUT WE STAND ON TRUTH.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Stabilizers have been put on the ship.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to this.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I won't preach two hours. Joel,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Joel's done quit pulling. And he told me
[1:30:29] he was going to quit at 8:15.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Preach, buddy.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Stabilizers been put on the ship. Great
[1:30:39] fearful waves are out here before us.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW JUST BEYOND the wave, we're
[1:30:45] nearing the shore.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NEARING THE STORM.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO his words. JUST STAY STABLE.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE WORD. STAY WITH GOD NO
[1:30:56] MATTER HOW YOU FEEL.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; WHAT ANYTHING ELSE? STAY RIGHT with the
[1:31:02] word.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Let it stay stable.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Stay balanced.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; When you see ALL THESE GREAT BIG OLD
[1:31:10] CLOUDS AROUND US, THE STORMS ARE COMING
[1:31:11] AND ATOMIC BOMBS AND EVERYTHING ELSE
[1:31:13] THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT OUR
[1:31:14] STABILIZER IS STRAIGHT IN THE WORD.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IT WOULD BE THERE. WE'LL CREST
[1:31:21] EVERY ONE OF THEM.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:31:24] I like this promise. We'll go right over
[1:31:26] the top of them.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; They can't sink us. They can't drown us.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; You can put us in the grave. We're
[1:31:32] coming out again.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; And there ain't no way in the world TO
[1:31:35] KEEP IT DOWN THERE. WE'LL CREST EVERY
[1:31:37] ONE OF THEM BECAUSE OUR GREAT CHIEF
[1:31:39] CAPTAIN IS CALLING FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; COME UP HIGHER.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Reminds me of the
[1:31:49] scripture in Matthew chapter 8 where
[1:31:51] they called Jesus on the scene in the
[1:31:52] middle of the storm.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Peace,
[1:31:57] be still."
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; And they marveled.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; But then they marveled at a man whom
[1:32:03] they'd been around for three years
[1:32:04] almost.
[1:32:06] Why do we marvel when God does a
[1:32:08] miraculous?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; We ask him.
[1:32:15] Probably everybody in here has had a
[1:32:16] miracle
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; and we see God move and and yet when he
[1:32:20] does it, we're just astounded. And then
[1:32:22] we had one little sister years ago, man,
[1:32:25] every time we'd go to pray for at the
[1:32:27] hospital, she'd get a miracle. And then
[1:32:29] one time she didn't. And she said,
[1:32:31] "Brother Jason, what's wrong? I'm not
[1:32:32] getting a miracle."
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I said, "Sister, sometimes God gives a
[1:32:36] healing."
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And then you got to hang on.
[1:32:41] You got to wait then for God to come on.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Listen church, we all like miracles, but
[1:32:46] what if God decides just to heal you?
[1:32:48] AND WHAT IF HE DECIDES TO LET US WALK
[1:32:50] THROUGH THIS BLOWDOWN FOR A WHILE AND BE
[1:32:53] HUNG UP IN THE TREES FOR A WHILE?
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S A BRIDE RISING UP WHO'S
[1:32:58] GOING TO RECOGNIZE WHO SHE IS.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD. RIGHT.
[1:33:05] And he rose and he rebuked the winds in
[1:33:07] the sea. And there was a great call. And
[1:33:10] they marveled that even the winds in the
[1:33:12] seas obeyed him. The ship is rocking.
[1:33:15] The winds are blowing. Satan's buffing
[1:33:17] him. And he's blow blow to blow and wave
[1:33:20] after wave
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; AND YOU WENT THROUGH TRIAL AFTER TRIAL.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Am I the only one that had trial after
[1:33:29] trial?
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. We all did. Yeah.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Trial after trial. Brother Joe, you
[1:33:33] didn't even know
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; what to do many times
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; cuz we don't always know what to do.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And no, I'm not trying to discern
[1:33:42] Brother Joe. I just We're humans.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; That's what happens.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; We don't always know which decision to
[1:33:47] make.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; But we know one thing. THE FOOTSTEPS OF
[1:33:50] A GOOD MAN ARE ORDERED OF THE LORD.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; SO YOU WALK IN HOW GOD LEADS YOU.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:33:58] WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE ALL HOPES OF A
[1:34:00] REVIVAL WAS GONE,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; THEN JESUS COME ON THE SCENE,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; testimonies were dying
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; out. He said people'd rather stay home
[1:34:11] on Wednesday night.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; Watch television. He said,
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; "Come on."
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Someone told me you couldn't preach
[1:34:17] against television anymore
[1:34:20] because everybody had them on their
[1:34:21] phones.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; I said, "Well, I guess we subtract 500
[1:34:24] quotes."
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Come on.
[1:34:27] I don't know what you do with them, but
[1:34:28] anyhow,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; do with them what you want.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Then they said, "Well, would Brother
[1:34:36] Brandham have a smartphone if he was
[1:34:37] here?" We don't know. He's not here.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; So, what do we got to do? We got to keep
[1:34:42] believing the gospel.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Listen, don't get hung up on STUFF LIKE
[1:34:46] THAT. STAY WITH THE MESSAGE.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, JUST SAY WHAT HE SAID AND HE'LL
[1:34:52] BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.
[1:34:55] TESTIMONIES IS DYING OUT. THEY'D RATHER
[1:34:57] STAY HOME. NO MORE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
[1:34:59] TESTIMONY MEETINGS AND THINGS. NO MORE
[1:35:01] PRAYER MEETINGS.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE ORES ARE BROKE.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; THE MASS HAS FELL. THE WINDS DONE
[1:35:07] KNOCKED THE SAILS DOWN.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; AND THE CARES of the WORLD WILL SOON
[1:35:11] KNOCK OUT YOUR TESTIMONY.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Then I tell you what we need. He said is
[1:35:16] a revival. This is 1963. What you need
[1:35:19] is A REVIVAL.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; BROTHER DIXON, WHAT IS A REVIVAL? A TRUE
[1:35:24] REVIVAL IS WHEN MEN AND WOMEN COME BACK
[1:35:27] AND LINE UP WITH THE WORD OF THEIR DAY.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; And there will be a message to sweep out
[1:35:37] then.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to catch her.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And there's been a message, has there
[1:35:46] not?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; And all hell may be breaking loose in
[1:35:51] your life right now.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, there's a real change
[1:35:56] coming, too.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; And it ain't just a change of the
[1:35:59] weather. IT'S A CHANGE OF YOUR BODY.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BODY CHANGE COMING.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T GOING TO BE TOO MUCH LONGER.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Psalms 27:5, "For in the time of
[1:36:11] trouble,
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; he shall hide me in his pavilion.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; In the secret of his tabernacle shall he
[1:36:19] hide me. YEAH.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; HE SHALL SET ME upon a rock.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; It's pretty astounding to me, brother
[1:36:26] takes that verse and preaches the
[1:36:28] rapture sermon.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you tonight, there's a
[1:36:33] change in the air.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; It's rapture time.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; We're in the season of rapture.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; We're in the rapture,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; right? Three things had to happen when
[1:36:42] the rapture COMES. THERE WAS A SHOUT.
[1:36:44] WHAT WAS THE SHOUT? THERE'S A MESSAGE TO
[1:36:46] BRING FORTH THE LIVING BREAD TO CATCH
[1:36:49] THE BRIDE.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THEN THE SECOND WAS A VOICE OF
[1:36:52] RESURRECTION.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; He said the same loud voice of St. John
[1:36:56] 11:38 and 44-44 THAT CALLED LAZARUS FROM
[1:37:00] THE GRAVE GETTING THE BRIDE TOGETHER.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE AT, CHURCH?
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Wind's blowing. Yeah,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Jason, there's going to be a rapture.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you know I'm in it?
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Well, how you in it? I'm part of it.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Well, how can you be part of it? Because
[1:37:23] the prophet of God said when I received
[1:37:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:37:26] everything I had need of was in me right
[1:37:28] then. Even the rapture.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; SO, DON'T TELL ME THE RAPTURE IS A
[1:37:32] FUTURE DATE. THE RAPTURE IS A PROCESS
[1:37:35] THAT WE ARE IN TONIGHT.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; AND THE THIRD THING IS A TRUMPET WILL
[1:37:40] SOUND.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; YES. AND THE FEAST OF TRUMPET IS ALWAYS
[1:37:43] CALLING THE PEOPLE TO a supper.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Soon the lamb will take his bride
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; to be ever at his side.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; All the hosts of heaven will assemble
[1:37:54] me.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; A shout and a voice and a trump. And
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; oh my brother Ben, I like this part when
[1:38:02] he says it. And Jesus does all three of
[1:38:05] them while he's descending.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:11] Yes, sir.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; So, where are we at?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; How close are we to the finishing of the
[1:38:17] rapture?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH. THE WINDS ARE HOWLING
[1:38:20] AND AND THEIR ONCOMING STORM IS UPON US.
[1:38:22] BUT WE'RE GOING TO RISE
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; AND WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS OVER DEATH,
[1:38:28] HELL, AND THE GRAVE.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST TELL YOU, IT'S GOING TO TAKE
[1:38:31] A STRONGER WIND
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; THAN WHAT WAS IN 2025 TO BRING ME DOWN.
[1:38:39] IT'S NOT GOING TO BRING ME DOWN.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; I'VE RECOGNIZED WHO WE ARE.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And by God's grace,
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; let us be anchored
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; deeper than we've ever been anchored.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; 2026, let this be the year of jubilee.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; SOME OF US HAVE BEEN BOUND. LET IT BE
[1:39:01] THE YEAR OF JUBILEE. SOME OF YOU IS
[1:39:03] BOUND BY SICKNESS AND DEPRESSION AND
[1:39:05] ANXIETY AND FEAR OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT
[1:39:06] BE. LET THIS BE THE YEAR YOU'RE SET FREE
[1:39:09] FROM IT.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; LET THIS BE YOUR VICTORY.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; And there will be a sweep.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; You know what a sweep does? It makes
[1:39:20] another wind.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Brother said, "Can't you see we're at
[1:39:26] the end time? It's all over. The next
[1:39:28] thing will be a sweep that'll grab that
[1:39:31] little group together."
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And in a month or so, SHE'LL BE GONE.
[1:39:36] OH,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; where are we at?
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Right here, brother Jeremy.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; At the end.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; I still remember that your you God got a
[1:39:47] hold of you, buddy.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; It's kind of a good thing your brother,
[1:39:53] your what is he? What's your uncle
[1:39:55] deceived you a little bit?
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Deceived him and got him saved.
[1:40:00] Told him they was going camping and they
[1:40:02] went to youth camp.
[1:40:06] And
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I remember, listen, this powerful
[1:40:08] testimony.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; He didn't expect the wind of change to
[1:40:11] come.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; HE THOUGHT HE'S GOING TO A PARTY.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; It was a party. All right.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Going on in glory.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; First night, he's back there in the
[1:40:25] middle of the tent,
[1:40:28] sunglasses on his head.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Danny Seaman's preaching. And you're
[1:40:32] sitting back there like that with the
[1:40:33] sunglasses on your head. Everybody knew
[1:40:35] who he was talking about.
[1:40:38] Next day he's up closer. I think ABOUT
[1:40:41] THE THIRD NIGHT HE'S RIGHT DOWN THERE.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; AND YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD CHANGED HIM.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WIND OF CHANGE I'M TALKING
[1:40:48] ABOUT. IT'S WHEN THE WIND OF THE HOLY
[1:40:50] SPIRIT COMES OVER A PERSON'S LIFE AND
[1:40:53] TRANSFORMS THEM.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; God so saved him, he got to marry the
[1:40:59] deacon's daughter.
[1:41:03] That's what God can do for you.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; It's going to take a stronger wind.
[1:41:08] Shake him off.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; preacher. Yes, sir.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Jo, there might be a lot of problems,
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; BUT NOTHING'S GOING TO SHAKE US
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; OFF FROM SERVING GOD.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, THIS MESSAGE IS OUR LIFE.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Let this be a warning tonight.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Let us run to Christ,
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; church. Let us RUN TO HIM. LET US GIVE
[1:41:31] HIM EVERYTHING WE GOT. LET US GIVE HIM
[1:41:33] OUR ALL, LORD. LORD, LET US FALL IN LOVE
[1:41:36] WITH YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; OH, PREACHER, you don't KNOW HOW BAD I
[1:41:41] HAD IT this year, but you don't know how
[1:41:43] great God is.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Greater than all my trouble.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to sing for you.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; But God is greater.
[1:41:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; There's young people sitting here right
[1:42:01] now God's dealing with.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; They've had a lot of storms,
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:13] But
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; there's a God here tonight
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; who can take your storm
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; and take your blow down and make you
[1:42:21] soar into the heavenly so high till
[1:42:23] everybody around you be like, "OH MY
[1:42:25] GOODNESS, WHATEVER THEY GOT, I WANT."
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IS
[1:42:30] TO LET WHAT YOU GOT GET ON YOUR NEIGHBOR
[1:42:32] AND ON YOUR OTHER NEIGHBOR. AND BEFORE
[1:42:34] LONG IT'S DOWN EVERY AISLE OF THE CHURCH
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; TILL WE ALL
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; FALL IN LOVE WITH JESUS.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; I say tonight God
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; let us be ready.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; 2026
[1:42:54] here the bride comes.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Remember what brother Brandham said to
[1:42:59] Satan? Satan
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; be careful. COME ON.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; BE CAREFUL, SATAN.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU'RE NOT MESSING WITH JUST
[1:43:08] ANYBODY. YOU'RE MESSING WITH GOD'S
[1:43:11] CHOSEN PEOPLE. AND IF THEY'RE GOD'S
[1:43:13] CHOSEN, GOD WILL FIGHT FOR THEM. HE'LL
[1:43:15] BACK THEM UP. HE'LL GO TO THE GULLY FOR
[1:43:18] THEM. HE'LL GO TO THE MOUNTAIN FOR THEM.
[1:43:19] HE THEM WAY DOWN TO HELL FOR YOU.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; He's God all the time.
[1:43:30] Would
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; you sing that song again, Sister Anna?
[1:43:33] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; That very song could have been my whole
[1:43:38] message tonight.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Don't let nothing and come on up. Shake
[1:43:44] you down.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You stick with this word.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, people of the word of
[1:43:50] life tabernacle, you stay with your
[1:43:53] pastor.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; He's ordained of God to see you through.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:03] I mean that.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; And those aren't my words. Those are the
[1:44:09] prophet's words.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; And if God called you here, you stay
[1:44:14] here and you get behind him. And don't
[1:44:16] be a drag.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Rod, if I drink this bottle.
[1:44:30] We're buddies.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; We're not going to let what anybody else
[1:44:34] does get between us.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, you're in a storm right
[1:44:40] now.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; There's a God here.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; That can fix the heart problem.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; That can fix the blockages.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:58] Thank you, Lord.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Good friend of mine the other night, we
[1:45:02] had prayer for him at church.
[1:45:04] Doctor said, "If you live the Tuesday,
[1:45:06] we'll do surgery on you."
[1:45:08] Tuesday, he goes and run the calf in.
[1:45:11] They said, "If if there's too many,
[1:45:13] we'll just do open heart surgery." They
[1:45:14] just knew he was plugged up. They said
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; they got in there, see,
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; no stance, no surgery. and they sent him
[1:45:26] home. Well,
[1:45:30] that same Lord Jesus can touch anybody
[1:45:34] in this building tonight.
[1:45:38] Let's
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; stand.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; Withered
[1:45:52] force.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. People
[1:45:56] running to and fro. They don't know
[1:45:59] what's going on.
[1:46:04] Hearts are failing
[1:46:06] because of turmoil in the land.
[1:46:14] We just can't take a stand. But it's
[1:46:17] going to take a stronger wind than this
[1:46:21] to keep me from my promises. Going to
[1:46:25] take a stronger wind
[1:46:30] to turn me around. Going to take a
[1:46:34] stronger wind than this
[1:46:37] to keep this evil
[1:46:41] down.
[1:46:45] People are living
[1:46:48] no different than the world
[1:46:53] claiming to know the love but truly
[1:46:57] serving other gods.
[1:47:01] They call on him day and night but they
[1:47:05] don't produce no life.
[1:47:09] anointed on words at the end time.
[1:47:12] They're rejecting the Holy Ghost. But
[1:47:15] it's going to take a stronger
[1:47:20] to keep me from my promises. Going to
[1:47:23] take a stronger
[1:47:28] to turn me around. Going to take a
[1:47:31] stronger win
[1:47:34] cuz my feet are on solid ground.
[1:47:43] People are searching
[1:47:46] for the true and living God.
[1:47:51] There's a famine in the land and the
[1:47:54] word seems no more.
[1:47:59] They have eyes but cannot see. They have
[1:48:02] ears but cannot hear.
[1:48:07] If they only sp
[1:48:17] to keep me from my promises going to
[1:48:21] take a str
[1:48:25] to turn me around. Going to take a
[1:48:29] stronger wind
[1:48:32] to keep this eagle
[1:48:37] down.
[1:48:44] People are searching
[1:48:47] for the true and living God.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; There's a famine in the land. And the
[1:48:56] world seems nothing more.
[1:49:00] They have eyes but cannot see. They have
[1:49:04] ears we cannot hear.
[1:49:08] If they only description they know that
[1:49:12] Jesus Christ is here. It's going to take
[1:49:15] a strong
[1:49:27] to turn me around. Going to take a
[1:49:30] strong
[1:49:33] cuz my feet are on
[1:49:37] solid ground.
[1:49:48] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord
[1:49:51] Jesus. If you just start to play
[1:49:53] something, I just want to give you an
[1:49:54] opportunity tonight. And I believe the
[1:49:56] presence of the Lord is here.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; It's a new year. We're going to start
[1:50:00] another year. And I've never ended a
[1:50:02] year that I didn't think, well, I could
[1:50:05] do this better or that better.
[1:50:08] And brother Jason said something
[1:50:09] tonight. And he said, "You know, we
[1:50:10] should be getting better,
[1:50:15] getting better every year."
[1:50:20] Now, I want us to have a just a season
[1:50:22] of prayer tonight. And if you want to
[1:50:23] come and pray, you're welcome to do
[1:50:25] that. This altar's open tonight. You're
[1:50:27] welcome to come pray.
[1:50:30] The Lord has touched you tonight through
[1:50:31] our brother's ministry. You're welcome
[1:50:33] to do that. Just kneel at the altar and
[1:50:35] pray if you want to come pray.
[1:50:39] But we're going to pray together and
[1:50:40] just have a season of prayer and just
[1:50:42] believe that,
[1:50:45] you know, 2026, we're going to be more
[1:50:47] dedicated.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to love people more.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; We're going to love each other, but
[1:50:52] we're going to forget about the past.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Let it go. It's not helping you. Quit
[1:50:58] holding on to it. Just let it go.
[1:51:01] Move forward. Brother Bren said we don't
[1:51:03] turn over a new leaf in the new year,
[1:51:05] but we want the Lord to just come and
[1:51:07] and just use us more.
[1:51:10] And if there's anything in our lives
[1:51:12] that's not right, it's time to just let
[1:51:14] go of it, church, and and quit doing it
[1:51:17] and move on. Wouldn't that be good?
[1:51:20] Wouldn't that be good if we're doing
[1:51:21] something we know is wrong? Let's just
[1:51:23] quit doing it and be a Christian. If you
[1:51:26] need something from him tonight, why why
[1:51:28] don't you lay hands on one another
[1:51:30] tonight as you're standing there? And
[1:51:31] there's quite a few of us in the
[1:51:32] building tonight. Just lay hands on one
[1:51:34] another,
[1:51:35] brother to brother and sister to sister.
[1:51:37] I husband to wife.
[1:51:42] When you The Bible says they shall lay
[1:51:44] hands on the sick and thus shall
[1:51:45] recover. So if you're sick tonight, I
[1:51:47] believe there's healing in the building
[1:51:48] for you.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; And all of us need a closer walk with
[1:51:52] God, a rededication. Why don't Why don't
[1:51:54] you just ask him for it tonight in your
[1:51:56] own way as we pray? Heavenly Father,
[1:51:59] Lord Jesus, as brother Jason preached
[1:52:01] tonight, a a voice of warning, Lord, and
[1:52:04] also Lord, a a call to a rapture, Lord,
[1:52:08] that we know has already begun within
[1:52:10] us. I pray God you would help us. We
[1:52:13] want to be more committed in the new
[1:52:14] year, Lord. We don't want to be the same
[1:52:16] as what we've been. We want to love
[1:52:18] more. We want to treat one another
[1:52:20] better. We Lord, we we don't want to
[1:52:22] repeat the failures of the past. Lord,
[1:52:24] there's young people here who may have
[1:52:26] failed in some way, but Lord, may this
[1:52:28] year be a year, oh God, that maturity
[1:52:31] begins to show up in their life and the
[1:52:32] Holy Ghost gets a hold of them, oh God.
[1:52:35] I pray you'd grant it today, Lord. I
[1:52:37] pray you would improve every home, Lord,
[1:52:39] that your spirit would be there. Maybe
[1:52:41] where there's been fussing and fighting,
[1:52:43] may it end tonight, Lord. and may your
[1:52:45] may may there be peace and harmony, oh
[1:52:47] God. Lord, where there's been a
[1:52:49] struggle, Lord, and and a trial, oh God,
[1:52:51] may you begin to bring victory in their
[1:52:53] lives. Lord, I pray for those that are
[1:52:55] sick. I think of several in the church
[1:52:57] tonight that wanted to be here and
[1:52:58] couldn't be. Lord, if they're watching
[1:53:00] this service, I pray, God, that you'd
[1:53:02] bless them tonight. I pray you'd heal
[1:53:04] them completely. We know cancer is
[1:53:06] nothing to God. We know diabetes is
[1:53:09] nothing to God. We we know heart trouble
[1:53:11] is nothing to you, Lord. And we pray,
[1:53:13] God, right now that you'd reach down and
[1:53:15] you'd heal those those that are sick, oh
[1:53:17] God. I pray for our our sister churches
[1:53:20] in the area, Lord. Especially those that
[1:53:22] have gathered with us tonight from
[1:53:24] Christian Tabernacle. I pray you'd
[1:53:26] anoint brother Jason, Lord. And I pray
[1:53:28] you'd anoint the services at the church,
[1:53:30] Lord. Bring a revival there. Oh God, we
[1:53:33] want one here as well, Lord. We want to
[1:53:35] see you move in this area, Lord. There's
[1:53:38] been so much the devil has gotten so
[1:53:40] much glory. We don't want to give him
[1:53:41] any more glory. We want you to get the
[1:53:43] glory in the coming years. I pray you'd
[1:53:45] grant it. Lord, I thank you for your
[1:53:48] presence tonight. Lord, we don't take it
[1:53:50] lightly. Lord, as brother Jason was
[1:53:53] talking about his father's as he was
[1:53:55] stood there in the corner and his hand
[1:53:57] would go up and tears would flow down
[1:53:58] his face cuz he had something on the
[1:54:01] inside that Lord that was touched by the
[1:54:03] hearing of the word. Lord, may it be so
[1:54:06] in every heart tonight. Lord, I pray you
[1:54:08] grant it. Oh God, may we worship you
[1:54:10] like never before, Lord, as we
[1:54:13] fellowship together. There's some food
[1:54:14] and things. I pray you'd bless it
[1:54:16] tonight and I thank you for it. Thank
[1:54:19] you for these people, Lord. We love them
[1:54:20] with all of our heart. Pray you bless
[1:54:22] them, Lord. And grant peace and strength
[1:54:25] in their homes in the coming year. We
[1:54:27] pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Do you
[1:54:31] love him tonight? You believe you've
[1:54:33] been helped tonight by the preaching of
[1:54:34] the word, by the worship? Let's just
[1:54:37] lift our hands.
[1:54:39] Spread your wings
[1:54:41] to the wind.
[1:54:44] Sing it now.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can fly
[1:54:50] in a higher place.
[1:54:54] Oh, do not struggle.
[1:54:57] Oh, thank you, Lord. It's by grace. Sing
[1:55:01] it now, brother.
[1:55:03] Set your wings.
[1:55:07] to the winds of faith.
[1:55:11] Oh, set your wings
[1:55:15] to the winds of faith
[1:55:20] and you won't fly
[1:55:24] in a higher place.
[1:55:28] Oh, do not struggle.
[1:55:32] It's by grace.
[1:55:36] Set your wings
[1:55:40] to the wings.
[1:55:44] There are two roads
[1:55:49] that you may take.
[1:55:53] One by side
[1:55:57] and one by faith.
[1:56:01] Just take the word of God.
[1:56:06] For what you see,
[1:56:10] what you believe
[1:56:14] is what will be.
[1:56:18] So send your wings
[1:56:22] to the wings of faith
[1:56:27] and you can fly
[1:56:31] in a higher place.
[1:56:35] Oh, do not struggle.
[1:56:39] It's by grace.
[1:56:44] Set your wings
[1:56:47] to the wings of faith. I like this one.
[1:56:51] Oh, watch your knees
[1:56:56] and watch your cry.
[1:57:00] Oh, watch your mountain
[1:57:05] much too high.
[1:57:08] Just speak the word of God
[1:57:12] and by and by
[1:57:16] oh it will move
[1:57:21] or you will fly.
[1:57:25] So send your wings
[1:57:29] to the wings of faith
[1:57:33] and you can fly
[1:57:37] in a higher place.
[1:57:41] Oh do not struggle.
[1:57:46] It's by grace
[1:57:50] set your wings
[1:57:54] to the winds of faith.
[1:57:58] Oh, watch the eagle
[1:58:02] up in the sky.
[1:58:07] He does not struggle.
[1:58:11] He does not strive
[1:58:15] for the power
[1:58:19] that makes him rise.
[1:58:23] Oh, it's already
[1:58:28] in the sky. With all your hearts now set
[1:58:32] your way
[1:58:36] to the wind of faith.
[1:58:40] Oh, you can fly
[1:58:44] in a higher place.
[1:58:48] Oh, do not sty
[1:58:57] your wings
[1:59:00] to the wind. Sing the chorus with all
[1:59:03] your hearts now. Oh, just sold
[1:59:13] you
[1:59:17] in a higher place.
[1:59:21] Oh, do not struggle.

[2:01:51] this evening? Amen. Aren't you thankful
[2:01:53] that no matter what kind of wind blows,

[2:01:58] Amen. We're thankful for the word of the
[2:01:59] Lord, Brother Jason brought to us this
[2:02:01] evening. Thankful for the unity we feel
[2:02:03] in the building here tonight. I want to
[2:02:04] just say uh I wonder if Word of Life
[2:02:06] could just give Christian Tabernacle a
[2:02:08] great big hand for coming out tonight.
[2:02:11] We love you all. Thank you for coming
[2:02:14] and appreciate your pastor coming and

[2:02:25] to thank you Lord G. We'll sing this one
[2:02:29] just before we go. There's some uh food
[2:02:30] and stuff in the fellowship hall. If we

[2:02:34] open. So, God bless you. Let's sing this
[2:02:38] before you go, though. And I just want

[2:03:40] And then I heard recognizing your name.
