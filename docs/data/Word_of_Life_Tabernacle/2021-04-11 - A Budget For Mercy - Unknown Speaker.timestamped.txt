[38:59] our heads together for a word of prayer
[39:02] maybe you'd have a special need you'd
[39:03] like to make known by way of uplifted
[39:05] hand
[39:06] i believe his presence is here today and
[39:08] he promised he'd be here and
[39:10] we know his word is here and so we're
[39:12] going to ask him and believe that he'll
[39:14] meet every need
[39:15] heavenly father you see the raised hands
[39:18] lord and you see the need behind every
[39:20] one of them
[39:21] i pray god that you would just meet
[39:23] those needs today
[39:25] the lord is as we know you're here we
[39:28] don't have to feel you to know that
[39:29] you're here because you promised to be
[39:31] here
[39:32] but lord i'm so thankful that we can
[39:34] feel you
[39:36] i'm so thankful that you can still warm
[39:38] our hearts
[39:40] lord through all the trials and the
[39:42] tests of life
[39:43] and through time sometimes we can become
[39:46] a little hardened
[39:48] lord we we know today that you have
[39:50] warmed our hearts and we thank you for
[39:52] that
[39:53] just warm lord where we can receive the
[39:55] word
[39:57] we thank you for all that you've done
[39:58] thank you for meeting every one of these
[40:00] needs today
[40:02] lord perhaps while the preaching is
[40:04] going on or the word is
[40:06] is coming lord there be needs maybe we
[40:09] didn't even know
[40:10] about things that we didn't know that
[40:13] would you reveal that to us lord things
[40:16] that we need to do
[40:18] things that we should have said or maybe
[40:19] shouldn't have said
[40:21] i pray you'd grant it lord god i pray
[40:24] you'd heal every sick person lord
[40:27] thank you for your goodness the lord is
[40:30] beyond anything that we could ever
[40:32] imagine could have ever thought would be
[40:35] we thank you for that today lord we
[40:38] thank you for all you do and we ask you
[40:40] to bless this service now and
[40:42] take me out of the way and speak to your
[40:44] people we pray in jesus name
[40:47] amen amen
[40:50] god bless you you love him this morning
[40:54] amen i know you do that's why you're
[40:56] here uh turn with me if you would
[40:59] we'll read from ephesians chapter two
[41:01] and verse one to begin today
[41:04] we'll have a lot of scriptures today
[41:06] ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[41:12] we're going to have a baptism
[41:14] immediately after the service today
[41:17] my two girls wanted to be baptized
[41:20] today and um
[41:23] i can't tell you how that makes me feel
[41:25] as a father some of you have experienced
[41:27] that and
[41:28] you know you worry about your kids
[41:30] especially in the age that we live in
[41:32] now
[41:33] you know as they they're still young but
[41:35] as they get older there's less and less
[41:37] control that you have over things and
[41:39] and you wish you could they could still
[41:41] be young again
[41:43] you want them to be that baby where you
[41:44] care for them and they can't always be
[41:46] that but i'm so grateful that god has
[41:49] touched our hearts and
[41:53] i apologize maybe too much for being
[41:56] sentimental about things like that but
[41:58] you know
[42:00] if we can't be touched by the presence
[42:02] of god what can we be touched by
[42:06] by people uh you know there's there's
[42:08] joy in the presence of the angels when a
[42:09] sinner repents and
[42:11] every one of these children i'd like to
[42:13] see them come to christ before they get
[42:15] to that place and just really get solid
[42:18] in christ
[42:21] jason was baptized last week
[42:24] and joel's little boy and
[42:28] he began to testify to melody and she
[42:30] wanted to be baptized and
[42:32] and uh but he told her when he he said
[42:34] when i come up out of the water he said
[42:36] it was like
[42:37] he said i thought i was walking up to
[42:39] heaven
[42:41] i thought that's what every one of us
[42:43] are doing
[42:45] that's what we're doing we're walking up
[42:47] to heaven you just keep walking
[42:49] keep walking god will lead you and we're
[42:51] so grateful for that today
[42:53] and we know that god will add to the
[42:56] church
[42:57] the ones that need to be here but i'm so
[42:58] thankful for these little ones and i
[43:00] pray that god would just set a revival
[43:02] fire
[43:03] among our children and maybe they can
[43:05] teach us a few things about the grace of
[43:07] god and
[43:08] amen ephesians chapter 2 and verse 1.
[43:11] isn't god good
[43:12] to us today it says in you hath he
[43:15] quickened
[43:16] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[43:19] well that's enough to shout about right
[43:21] there isn't it
[43:22] he's made you alive he didn't stop with
[43:24] raising from the dead but he made you
[43:26] alive
[43:27] wherein in time past ye walked according
[43:30] to the course of this world according to
[43:31] the prince of the power of the air
[43:34] the spirit that now worketh in the
[43:36] children of disobedience
[43:38] among whom also we all had our
[43:40] conversation our
[43:42] our manner of life in times past in the
[43:45] lust of our flesh
[43:47] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[43:49] of the mind
[43:50] we're by nature the children of wrath
[43:52] even as others
[43:54] but god who was rich in mercy
[43:58] for his great love were with theeth
[44:00] loved us
[44:02] even when we were dead in sins hath
[44:04] quickened us together with christ
[44:06] by grace you're saved and hath raised us
[44:09] up together and made us
[44:11] sit together in heavenly places in
[44:14] christ jesus
[44:15] that in the ages to come he might show
[44:17] the exceeding
[44:19] riches of his grace and his kindness
[44:21] toward us
[44:22] through christ jesus by grace are you
[44:25] saved through faith
[44:27] and that not of yourselves it is the
[44:29] gift of god
[44:31] not of works lest any man should boast
[44:33] for we are
[44:35] his workmanship cr aided in christ
[44:39] jesus unto good works which god hath
[44:42] before ordained that we should walk
[44:45] in them i pray the lord would add his
[44:47] blessing to the word you may be seated
[44:48] this morning
[44:54] we know that god is
[44:58] has unlimited ability
[45:02] his his ability whatever he would want
[45:05] to do
[45:06] he would be able to do right
[45:09] but if god had a budget and then we
[45:11] think about that like
[45:13] if you have a budget you have a certain
[45:14] amount of income
[45:16] a certain amount of money coming in and
[45:19] and that's
[45:19] what you're going to have and so you
[45:22] maybe you have so much for groceries so
[45:24] much for rent so much for
[45:26] uh for the mortgage and as you budget
[45:29] that out then you realize that maybe you
[45:31] need a little more
[45:32] and so you take some money off the
[45:34] grocery budget or
[45:35] you take some money off the budget for
[45:37] going out to eat because
[45:40] you got to have that budget's got to be
[45:42] right or if god had a budget it wouldn't
[45:44] be like ours
[45:46] because it would be unlimited in its
[45:48] income
[45:50] if you we can't even imagine that we
[45:53] can't even imagine that but in
[45:54] you know in this nation there's some
[45:56] people that are so rich
[45:58] that money is almost meaningless
[46:01] and we we live in a very wealthy nation
[46:03] but to god
[46:05] you know how would what kind of budget
[46:06] would he have if he had one
[46:09] it wouldn't be limited by resources but
[46:11] it would be limited
[46:12] because he limits the display of his
[46:15] attributes to a particular person
[46:18] place and time so there is a budget if
[46:22] we could say it that way a certain
[46:23] amount
[46:24] a certain time for mercy a certain time
[46:28] for for grace to be shown in your life
[46:30] and you can see that because
[46:32] you were called out when others weren't
[46:34] and you heard the message when others
[46:37] didn't
[46:38] even among the non-elect there's a
[46:40] different levels of
[46:42] mercy you think about it people in this
[46:44] nation have heard
[46:46] the gospel and there's some nations
[46:48] where they went hundreds of years
[46:51] before they ever even knew about christ
[46:54] and and they'll be judged based on their
[46:57] actions
[46:58] towards even the their own conscience
[47:01] and paul tells us that in romans chapter
[47:02] 1
[47:03] that they'll the world the whole world
[47:05] was guilty before god
[47:07] right even those that are not heard but
[47:09] yet there was a certain
[47:11] amount of mercy that was given to them
[47:14] but so much more to us because we have
[47:18] heard
[47:19] because we do know and then you bring
[47:21] that down
[47:22] into the message of the hour and think
[47:24] there's so many people
[47:25] sam that don't know or haven't heard but
[47:27] i heard
[47:29] and you heard and maybe you were born in
[47:31] a message family maybe
[47:32] maybe you were born in an area where
[47:34] there were people maybe you heard about
[47:35] it
[47:36] in africa or wherever that you were
[47:37] where you were working
[47:39] you heard about the message of the hour
[47:40] and and it was mercy to you
[47:43] and to your life and but someone else
[47:46] didn't receive that mercy
[47:48] it comes to a particular person place
[47:51] and time
[47:53] and so we should never when we have the
[47:55] opportunity
[47:56] to so that he's given me opportunity and
[47:58] he's given you opportunity after
[48:00] opportunity after opportunity
[48:02] to hear from him i we should approach
[48:05] every service that way it's such a
[48:07] blessing to be able just to receive the
[48:09] mercy of god
[48:11] david tells us about the riches of god
[48:13] in psalms 104 and 1.
[48:15] he says bless the lord o my soul o lord
[48:18] my god thou art very great
[48:21] our clothed with honor and majesty who
[48:24] covers thyself with light as with a
[48:26] garment
[48:27] who stretches out the heavens like a
[48:29] curtain
[48:30] it's just a curtain in his house
[48:33] amen who layeth the beams of his
[48:35] chambers in the water you know how proud
[48:37] you'd be if you built your own house
[48:38] with your own hands
[48:40] some of you are probably able to do that
[48:43] i built that with my hands how proud you
[48:45] would be
[48:45] that you were able to do that god laid
[48:47] the foundations of the earth
[48:51] that it should not be removed forever
[48:52] thou covered it with the deepest of the
[48:54] garment
[48:54] the waters stood above the mountains
[48:56] that thy rebuke they fled
[48:58] the voice of thy thunder they hasted
[48:59] away and he goes on now and you can read
[49:02] that maybe
[49:03] this week when you get home psalms
[49:05] chapter 104
[49:06] in truth a wealthy god
[49:11] verse psalm 103 8 the lord is merciful
[49:14] and gracious
[49:16] so to anger and plenty is rich
[49:19] in mercy aren't you glad he is
[49:24] well he didn't have to be for me i beg
[49:26] to differ
[49:28] he had to be for me he said but you
[49:31] don't realize i was religious when i got
[49:33] saved that's the worst
[49:34] kind of a sinner this is a religious one
[49:38] the worst sinner in simon's house simon
[49:40] the pharisee's house was simon
[49:44] he was the worst sinner in the whole
[49:45] place but god
[49:48] rich in mercy extended mercy but he
[49:50] didn't accept it
[49:52] but a little prostitute
[49:56] down on the wrong side of the tracks
[49:59] god rich in mercy come at simon's
[50:02] invitation
[50:03] to sit right there among the people and
[50:05] they didn't wash his feet they didn't
[50:07] take care of him
[50:08] but god rich in mercy
[50:11] man there was a little a little
[50:13] prostitute down the street
[50:14] and she saw what was going on and she
[50:16] saw how mistreated he was
[50:18] and she sat there in the corner and got
[50:20] rich in mercy
[50:21] sitting in the corner with unwashed feet
[50:23] and she said i'll praise him
[50:25] i'll wash his feet i may not be worthy
[50:27] but i'll get down and worship him
[50:30] somebody's got to do it she saw a need
[50:33] that he had and god
[50:34] rich in mercy forgave her of her sins
[50:36] and set her on the right path
[50:38] god rich in mercy rich in mercy wealthy
[50:42] able to reach out even even with the
[50:44] ability to reach out to simon who he
[50:46] knew
[50:46] hated him had him there for the wrong
[50:48] reasons
[50:50] but he still showed up and he got that
[50:53] predestinated seed
[50:56] amen hallelujah
[51:00] the lord is merciful and gracious so to
[51:02] anger plenteous and mercy
[51:05] amen he says he will not always shine
[51:09] neither will he keep his anger forever i
[51:11] love the way he says this
[51:13] he says he hath not dealt with us after
[51:15] our sins
[51:17] nor rewarded us according to our
[51:19] iniquities
[51:21] as the heaven is high above the earth so
[51:23] great is his mercy
[51:25] toward them that fear him so
[51:29] now he's giving us an understanding
[51:32] that god is great in mercy but he's it's
[51:36] the greatness of his mercy is reserved
[51:38] for those that fear him now
[51:40] and it doesn't mean that because they
[51:41] did everything wrong
[51:43] but they had respect to that god
[51:46] they had a fear for that god that was
[51:48] rich in mercy
[51:50] now and again he knew he would they
[51:53] would by foreknowledge but look
[51:55] there is i want to deal with this and
[51:59] you forgive me i'm trying to i've got so
[52:01] much on the on a plate today and i'm not
[52:03] going to hold you forever
[52:04] but i just want to try to get this as
[52:06] the lord revealed it to me
[52:08] but god is is so rich in his mercy
[52:12] and yet at times he will he don't deal
[52:16] with us according to our sins
[52:18] but he will extend mercy to those that
[52:20] fear him in other words those that will
[52:21] repent
[52:23] those that will acknowledge when his
[52:26] mercy is extended
[52:28] they get more mercy
[52:33] and that's why we should never sit and
[52:35] and
[52:36] and say well god's been good to me but
[52:38] then sit back on that and
[52:39] and not if something is revealed to us
[52:41] we need to repent quickly
[52:44] because if we hold on to that that that
[52:46] richness of that mercy is extended more
[52:48] to those who fear him
[52:51] those who respect him those who will
[52:53] acknowledge their need of mercy
[52:55] get more mercy and you can look at the
[52:58] example of david and saul and i don't
[53:00] have time to go into it today but
[53:02] those who will repent more mercy
[53:05] almost an unbelievable amount of mercy
[53:09] amen hallelujah
[53:12] now he says as far as the east
[53:17] is from the west so far hath you removed
[53:19] our transgressions from us
[53:22] he says like as a father pitteth his
[53:24] children
[53:26] so the lord pitteth them that fear him
[53:29] i feel that there are many dads here
[53:31] today you understand that
[53:33] you get that because you love your kids
[53:37] as a father loves his children pities
[53:40] his children
[53:41] has compassion on his children so the
[53:44] lord pitteth them that fear him
[53:47] for he knoweth our frame amen
[53:50] in other words he knows i'm human he
[53:53] remembers that we are dust
[53:56] hallelujah we don't remember that
[53:58] sometimes but god does
[54:00] god knows that we're dust god knows that
[54:02] we're not made up
[54:03] of much it just brother daryl said maybe
[54:05] five dollars worth of
[54:07] worth of materials god knows
[54:10] who we are he remembers that we're dust
[54:13] as for man his days are as grass as the
[54:15] flower of the field so he flourisheth
[54:17] and the wind passes over it and it is
[54:19] gone and the place there shall know it
[54:21] no more
[54:22] but the mercy of the lord is from
[54:24] everlasting to everlasting
[54:26] upon them that fear him amen
[54:29] and his righteousness unto children's
[54:32] children
[54:33] to such as keep his covenant to those
[54:35] that remember his commandments
[54:37] to do them now i want us to look this
[54:41] morning
[54:42] at god's mercy that he had for jacob in
[54:45] particular
[54:46] and you look at jacob and you think he
[54:48] didn't do a lot to deserve that
[54:55] why didn't god put up with jacob because
[54:58] he loved him
[55:00] same reason you put up with your kids
[55:04] you put up with your own children a lot
[55:06] more and you put up with somebody else
[55:10] you you may not have much mercy for
[55:12] somebody else but when it's your kids
[55:15] huh right it means something
[55:18] to be to be family it means something to
[55:21] be children of god
[55:23] and jacob was his son that was the one
[55:26] he loved that was the one he chose
[55:28] he loved jacob psalms 47 and 1
[55:32] and i'm going to go through some things
[55:33] and talk to you about how god loved
[55:35] israel and loves
[55:36] israel today in fact he even says if you
[55:40] if you bless them i'll bless you if you
[55:43] curse them i'll curse you
[55:45] and you can even see that in nations
[55:46] today when they turn against israel god
[55:49] turns against them
[55:52] even today because he loved his
[55:56] jacob so much and so
[55:59] psalms 47 1 oh clap your hands all you
[56:01] people shout out to god with the voice
[56:03] of triumph for the lord most highest
[56:04] terrible
[56:05] he's a great king over all the earth he
[56:08] shall subdue the people under us and the
[56:10] nations under our feet
[56:12] why us in other words why israel why
[56:16] jacob
[56:18] he said he shall choose our inheritance
[56:20] for us
[56:22] amen the excellency of jacob whom he
[56:25] loved
[56:27] he chooses the inheritance of jacob he
[56:30] put the reason there they exist today
[56:32] and they're in their land
[56:33] because god loves them
[56:36] and they they told him even in the old
[56:38] testament they said how have you loved
[56:40] us
[56:42] he said i love jacob and i hated esau
[56:45] and his love brother said they didn't
[56:47] understand his love was elected love now
[56:49] elective love now how have you loved us
[56:52] and we have to see that today he extends
[56:54] his mercy
[56:56] as
[57:06] not because they know more or can do
[57:09] more but because they're his family
[57:12] amen amen so now
[57:16] in romans 9 13 paul picks it up he says
[57:18] as it is written jacob have a love but
[57:20] he saw have a hated
[57:21] what shall we say then is there
[57:23] unrighteousness with god god forbid for
[57:26] he saith to moses i will have mercy
[57:28] on whom i will have mercy there in the
[57:31] budget
[57:34] these others weren't in the budget they
[57:36] didn't get
[57:37] budgeted for and so when they may got
[57:41] one chance
[57:42] amen but this one got chance after
[57:45] chance
[57:45] after chance you realize
[57:49] esau the bible says he saw a place of
[57:51] repentance with tears
[57:53] one chance that's all he got
[57:58] but jacob had angels appeared to him
[58:02] and he saw visions and dreams and god
[58:04] corrected him and brought him to
[58:06] and worked all of his life until finally
[58:08] when he's 70 years old he's done
[58:10] everything wrong
[58:11] all his life and he finally comes and
[58:13] wrestles with the angel
[58:17] amen god appears oh my inner theophany
[58:21] form
[58:22] to those who he loves
[58:25] amen don't you realize he still appears
[58:28] today to those that he loves
[58:30] he appeared to us in this age in the
[58:33] message of the hour
[58:34] to those who he loved amen
[58:38] now so he says i'll have compassion on
[58:41] whom i have compassion and he says so
[58:42] then it is not of him that willeth
[58:44] nor of him that runneth but god that
[58:47] showeth mercy
[58:48] was in the budget
[58:52] amen you were in the budget
[58:57] you didn't have to add an extra line
[58:58] later
[59:01] amen hallelujah
[59:04] amen now in the first temple when they
[59:09] and i'm just showing you how god had
[59:10] mercy to israel and how they understood
[59:12] that
[59:13] they recognized during the times and you
[59:16] look at it
[59:16] israel didn't serve god much if you look
[59:20] at the thousands of years of jewish
[59:21] history
[59:22] they serve probably other gods more than
[59:24] they serve god
[59:25] at different points in their history
[59:28] they never did they never
[59:29] were completely surrendered to god the
[59:32] way that they should have been
[59:34] but now they recognize during those
[59:37] moments when they would
[59:39] praise god and worship him for the mercy
[59:41] he extended to them
[59:42] they would recognize this that his mercy
[59:44] endures
[59:46] it wasn't a one-time thing or a
[59:49] one-time opportunity because when the
[59:51] first temple was built
[59:53] in second chronicles 7 6 it says the
[59:55] priests waited on their offices
[59:57] the levites also with instruments of
[59:58] music of the lord
[1:00:00] which david the king had made to praise
[1:00:02] the lord
[1:00:03] because his why because his mercy
[1:00:06] endureth forever
[1:00:08] amen so david made
[1:00:11] instruments for the purpose
[1:00:15] of worshiping the lord because his mercy
[1:00:18] endures forever
[1:00:22] and he said when david praised by their
[1:00:24] ministry
[1:00:25] david praised by their ministry and
[1:00:27] that's why we believe in music
[1:00:28] david would worship through the music
[1:00:32] and the musicians the songs that he'd
[1:00:33] written the musical instruments that he
[1:00:36] made
[1:00:36] was a worship to god and so when we play
[1:00:40] an
[1:00:40] instrument when you play an instrument
[1:00:42] you do that with all of your heart
[1:00:43] because
[1:00:44] it's a worship to god it's worship and
[1:00:48] and david praised by their ministry and
[1:00:51] we even
[1:00:51] will find ourselves we praised by the
[1:00:53] ministry of the musicians
[1:00:56] that's true and the priests sounded
[1:00:58] trumpets before them and all israel
[1:01:00] stood
[1:01:01] in the second temple in ezra chapter 3
[1:01:03] and verse 10 it says when the builders
[1:01:05] laid the foundation of the temple of the
[1:01:06] lord
[1:01:07] they set the priests in their apparel
[1:01:08] with trumpets and the levites the sons
[1:01:11] of asaph with symbols
[1:01:14] so there you go they had i guess part of
[1:01:17] the drums said anyway
[1:01:19] they had symbols to praise the lord
[1:01:24] can you imagine that that levite and i
[1:01:26] don't want to get too far off on this
[1:01:27] but that levite standing there with his
[1:01:28] symbols his only job maybe was to clash
[1:01:30] those symbols
[1:01:31] once a day but his whole life was
[1:01:34] trained for that
[1:01:36] everything about him was trained just to
[1:01:38] clash just to play that instrument
[1:01:39] one time a day it had to be just so
[1:01:42] right and so perfect why
[1:01:44] because that was his ministry amen
[1:01:48] amen now he said after the ordinance of
[1:01:50] david king of israel and they sang
[1:01:52] together by course
[1:01:53] in praising and giving thanks unto the
[1:01:55] lord
[1:01:57] so this one would sing and then this one
[1:01:58] would sing and and so there's
[1:02:00] it's right to have an order they had an
[1:02:03] order but it was worship to god
[1:02:05] right and so they sang together by
[1:02:07] course see you don't have to
[1:02:09] sing badly to worship god
[1:02:13] now you can sing badly and still worship
[1:02:15] god
[1:02:16] right but you don't have to sing badly
[1:02:18] to worship god
[1:02:20] you can sing good and worship god thank
[1:02:23] the lord
[1:02:23] play it good brother david
[1:02:27] and they sang together by course in
[1:02:29] praise and giving thanks to the lord
[1:02:30] because he is good
[1:02:31] for his mercy endureth forever toward
[1:02:33] israel they could look back at that
[1:02:35] first temple and say look what we've
[1:02:36] come through
[1:02:38] from then till now
[1:02:42] look what he's brought us to brother
[1:02:43] glenn you can look back when you got
[1:02:44] saved and you could say
[1:02:45] you were good then but your mercy
[1:02:48] endures forever
[1:02:51] look how much much mercy was budgeted
[1:02:53] toward israel
[1:02:54] that they denied him they turned their
[1:02:56] back on and go read the prophets how
[1:02:57] that they
[1:02:58] turned away from god and when they
[1:03:00] completely turned away from god
[1:03:02] god give them another temple amen
[1:03:06] amen another opportunity and they sang
[1:03:09] together and they
[1:03:10] worshipped god and all the people
[1:03:11] shouted with a great shout when they
[1:03:13] praised the lord because the foundation
[1:03:15] of the house of the lord was laid see
[1:03:18] they could count on god's mercy even
[1:03:19] when they didn't deserve it
[1:03:22] listen to isaiah chapter 54 and 4 fear
[1:03:24] not for thou shalt not be ashamed
[1:03:26] neither be thou confounded
[1:03:27] for thou shalt not be put to shame for
[1:03:29] thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth
[1:03:32] and shall not remember the reproach of
[1:03:34] thy widowhood anymore
[1:03:36] for thy maker he said is thy husband
[1:03:40] the lord of hosts is his name and the
[1:03:42] redeemer the holy one of israel
[1:03:44] the god of the whole earth shall be
[1:03:46] called shall he be called
[1:03:48] now watch he said for the lord hath
[1:03:49] called thee as a woman forsaken and
[1:03:52] grieved in spirit
[1:03:53] a wife of youth when thou hast refused
[1:03:56] saith thy god for a small moment have i
[1:03:59] forsaken thee
[1:04:01] that's why they can see his mercy
[1:04:02] endures forever for a small moment have
[1:04:04] i forsaken thee
[1:04:05] but with great mercies will i gather
[1:04:07] thee
[1:04:10] and even his forsaking them was a part
[1:04:13] of his mercy
[1:04:20] now look he said i've done that for a
[1:04:23] small moment now in a little wrath
[1:04:25] i hid my face from me for a moment i
[1:04:28] said so expressive in
[1:04:29] making this contrast for a small moment
[1:04:32] with a little wrath
[1:04:35] but with everlasting kindness will i
[1:04:37] have mercy on thee saith the lord thy
[1:04:39] redeemer
[1:04:41] he said for this is as the waters of
[1:04:42] noah unto me
[1:04:44] as i have sworn that the waters of noah
[1:04:46] should no more go over the earth so have
[1:04:48] i sworn
[1:04:48] that i would not be wrath with thee nor
[1:04:50] rebuke thee
[1:04:51] for the mountain shall depart and the
[1:04:53] hills will be removed but my kindness
[1:04:55] shall not depart from thee
[1:04:56] neither shall the covenant of my peace
[1:04:58] be removed saith the lord that hath
[1:05:00] mercy
[1:05:02] on thee no weapon
[1:05:05] he goes on to say in verse 17 no weapon
[1:05:07] that is formed against thee shall
[1:05:09] prosper
[1:05:10] every tongue that shall rise against the
[1:05:12] unjudgment thou shalt condemn
[1:05:13] he said this is the heritage of the
[1:05:15] servants of the lord what did we read
[1:05:17] earlier where do they get that heritage
[1:05:19] their inheritance comes from god he will
[1:05:22] make our inheritance for us because he
[1:05:24] loves us
[1:05:26] this is the heritage of the servants of
[1:05:27] the lord and their righteousness is of
[1:05:29] me
[1:05:30] saith the lord he said well how much
[1:05:33] mercy would they use how would he ever
[1:05:35] know
[1:05:36] how much of his character how much to
[1:05:39] apportion
[1:05:40] to israel of mercy well
[1:05:43] he knew how much they would need
[1:05:48] and the budget for mercy to israel was
[1:05:51] as much as they needed
[1:05:56] now you understand that god gives you
[1:05:58] what you need now look
[1:06:01] in hosea chapter one let's look at this
[1:06:03] real quick
[1:06:04] look at the mercies of god i wonder
[1:06:08] today
[1:06:09] and thinking about mercy and just we
[1:06:11] have mercy god has mercy on us we have
[1:06:13] mercy to others
[1:06:14] i wonder what our budget for mercy is
[1:06:18] towards others boy it's quiet
[1:06:22] right i wonder how limited our budget
[1:06:25] for mercy is
[1:06:28] i'll go this far peter says peter's
[1:06:32] trying to make his budget you know
[1:06:34] how often should i forgive my brother
[1:06:38] seven times people thought he was being
[1:06:40] so generous you know
[1:06:43] no 70 times seven
[1:06:47] he said peter just blew peter's budget
[1:06:48] all out of the water
[1:06:51] what's our budget for mercy well if it
[1:06:54] resembles
[1:06:55] be like if we're like god if we're to be
[1:06:58] like christ
[1:06:59] it ought to be huge
[1:07:03] it shouldn't be small it shouldn't be an
[1:07:05] afterthought
[1:07:07] look at how the tender hand of jehovah
[1:07:10] worked to israel and he he magnifies
[1:07:13] this or he
[1:07:14] he shows this manifested in the life of
[1:07:16] the prophet jose
[1:07:18] it says the beginning of the word of the
[1:07:19] lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea
[1:07:21] go
[1:07:22] taken to be a wife of whoredoms and
[1:07:25] children of whoredoms
[1:07:26] for the land hath committed great
[1:07:28] whoredom departed departing
[1:07:30] from the lord so he tells a prophet
[1:07:34] and and you say brother ben can you
[1:07:35] explain all this no i can't
[1:07:37] he tells a prophet to go marry a woman
[1:07:40] who he knew
[1:07:42] had an adulterous spirit
[1:07:45] he said go and marry her
[1:07:50] now again you would never do that i'd
[1:07:52] never advise someone to do that
[1:07:54] because the person that's done it once
[1:07:55] would do it again but god's
[1:07:57] showing look he's showing his mercy
[1:08:05] now he goes on he does deal with them
[1:08:07] harshly and
[1:08:08] and the proof that we are gods is that
[1:08:11] he deals with us as children
[1:08:13] right you know most of the time if you
[1:08:17] see somebody spanking a kid
[1:08:19] that's probably a parent maybe a
[1:08:23] grandparent
[1:08:26] but most of the time that's a parent
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:29] you just don't go up to random kids as
[1:08:31] much as you might want to
[1:08:36] take a belt to them and you know but but
[1:08:40] you do that to your own kids
[1:08:42] say well why would i treat my own kids
[1:08:44] worse than all these others
[1:08:45] you're not treating them worse you love
[1:08:48] them
[1:08:49] and the fact that you love them displays
[1:08:51] itself in
[1:08:52] your your level of correction toward
[1:08:54] them
[1:08:55] and so in jose two and four and you
[1:08:58] again you can go read this to
[1:08:59] later at home but he's she he tells jose
[1:09:04] he says i will not have mercy upon her
[1:09:05] children speaking of this woman
[1:09:07] maybe the children of whoredoms their
[1:09:09] mother has played the harlot she that
[1:09:11] conceived them have done shamefully
[1:09:13] for she said i will go after my lovers
[1:09:15] they give me my bread and my water my
[1:09:16] wall and my flax
[1:09:17] my oil and my drink in other words they
[1:09:19] did things that would make them
[1:09:20] successful in the natural
[1:09:22] instead of leaning on god who would
[1:09:25] provide for them
[1:09:29] he said therefore behold i will hedge up
[1:09:32] thy way with thorns
[1:09:34] and make a wall that she shall not find
[1:09:38] her paths now here's a straying wife
[1:09:42] and jehovah says i'm going to make it
[1:09:44] where everywhere she goes she runs into
[1:09:46] trouble
[1:09:48] because she's looking for other lovers
[1:09:51] how many times have we been corrected
[1:09:53] like this
[1:09:55] we're looking for you get your mind off
[1:09:57] of god you get a little backslid and
[1:09:58] things begin to start happening and god
[1:10:00] begins to bring correction into your
[1:10:01] life
[1:10:03] why is he doing that because he loves
[1:10:05] you
[1:10:09] she shall not find her past and she
[1:10:11] shall follow after her lovers but she
[1:10:13] shall not overtake them
[1:10:15] she shall seek them but shall not find
[1:10:16] them then shall she say
[1:10:18] i will go and return to my first husband
[1:10:21] for then was it better with me
[1:10:23] than now now look they were punished
[1:10:27] for straying but god doesn't take
[1:10:30] revenge
[1:10:34] i hope you you get this today god
[1:10:36] doesn't take revenge
[1:10:40] he doesn't come out and and bring
[1:10:44] retribution on you
[1:10:45] because you did this i'm going to do
[1:10:46] this to you neither should we do that to
[1:10:49] our children
[1:10:51] god doesn't bring revenge what does he
[1:10:53] bring
[1:10:54] amen he comes with correction
[1:10:58] even his harshness towards her is the
[1:11:00] tender hand
[1:11:01] of jehovah and in jose 2 11 he says i
[1:11:05] will also cause all her mirth to cease
[1:11:07] her feast days
[1:11:08] her new moons her sabbath he said and
[1:11:12] the he said and her solemn feasts and i
[1:11:14] will destroy her vines and her fig trees
[1:11:17] wherever she has said these are my
[1:11:18] rewards that my lovers have given me
[1:11:20] and i will make them a forest and the
[1:11:22] beasts of the field shall eat them
[1:11:24] and i will visit upon her the day so
[1:11:26] bailum when she burned infants to them
[1:11:28] and she decked herself with earrings and
[1:11:31] she went after her lovers
[1:11:33] and for forgot me saith the lord
[1:11:36] so he said i'm going to deal harshly
[1:11:37] with her. but look at the next verse
[1:11:40] therefore behold i will allure her
[1:11:47] it's a beautiful picture church
[1:11:51] i'm going to win her back
[1:11:55] even though she left me and it was all
[1:11:58] her in the wrong
[1:12:00] i'm going to win her back look at the
[1:12:02] heart of jehovah towards israel remember
[1:12:04] he's dealing with israel now
[1:12:07] i'm going to win her back even though
[1:12:08] she's the one
[1:12:10] who left me i know i'm taking my time
[1:12:12] but i'm i'm going to stop if we get
[1:12:13] beyond time so you just hang with me
[1:12:16] he says i will win her back i will
[1:12:19] allure her i'm going to flirt with
[1:12:22] her huh that's what he's saying
[1:12:27] i'm going to treat her like we were just
[1:12:30] getting married again
[1:12:33] amen i'm going to treat her like that i
[1:12:35] will allure her
[1:12:38] and bring her into the wilderness and
[1:12:40] speak comfortably unto her
[1:12:42] she don't deserve it no but that's what
[1:12:44] i'm going to do
[1:12:45] i will give her her vineyards from then
[1:12:47] from the valley of acor
[1:12:49] for a door of hope now you remember acor
[1:12:51] is where aiken was judged
[1:12:54] acor that is a place of judgment
[1:12:58] but it's also the entrance to canaan
[1:13:01] because remember they went to take
[1:13:03] jericho and they couldn't take it
[1:13:05] because of the sin
[1:13:07] and they went to take ai and they so
[1:13:09] many were ai rather and so
[1:13:10] it was after jericho but they went to
[1:13:12] take ai and and they couldn't take it
[1:13:14] because
[1:13:14] of aiken sin and so the valley of acre
[1:13:17] there was stones piled up there showing
[1:13:19] the judgment that had come on aiken
[1:13:21] but in the place where aiken was judged
[1:13:23] he said i'll make that a door of hope
[1:13:27] i'll make the valley of judgment a place
[1:13:30] of opportunity
[1:13:32] and she shall sing there is in the days
[1:13:34] of her youth and as in the day
[1:13:36] when she came up out of the land of
[1:13:38] egypt
[1:13:41] verse 16 and it shall be at that day
[1:13:42] saith the lord that thou shalt call me
[1:13:44] is she and she'll call me no more bailey
[1:13:46] my husband shall call me you're my
[1:13:49] husband not my lord
[1:13:51] verse 19 we're skipping through this at
[1:13:54] the same time he said i will betroth
[1:13:55] thee unto me forever
[1:13:56] yeah i will betroth thee unto me in
[1:13:58] righteousness and in judgment
[1:14:00] and in loving kindness and mercies i
[1:14:03] will even
[1:14:04] betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and
[1:14:07] thou
[1:14:07] shalt know the lord he says i'm going to
[1:14:10] be so good to you
[1:14:12] that you'll be faithful
[1:14:16] can you imagine a god like that this
[1:14:18] morning church a god that would be so
[1:14:20] good to you it should be faithful
[1:14:24] that's what he did with israel now look
[1:14:27] he wanted her back so badly that in jose
[1:14:29] 3-1
[1:14:30] didn't say it the lord unto me go yet
[1:14:33] imagine the heart of god he's telling
[1:14:35] jose to do this but in his own heart
[1:14:36] he's doing this for his own children go
[1:14:39] yet love a woman beloved of her friend
[1:14:42] her husband loves her but yet an
[1:14:45] adulteress according to the love of the
[1:14:47] lord toward the children of israel
[1:14:49] who looked to other gods and loved
[1:14:51] flagons
[1:14:52] of wine so i bought her to me for 15
[1:14:55] pieces of silver for a home or a barley
[1:14:57] a half homer barley is half the price of
[1:14:59] a slave
[1:15:00] she wasn't worth much to the world but
[1:15:02] he said i love her
[1:15:04] i said unto her thou shall abide for me
[1:15:07] many days i shall not play the heart
[1:15:08] thou shalt not be for another man so
[1:15:09] will i also be for thee
[1:15:13] but you know there came a time when
[1:15:14] mercy was suspended for israel as a
[1:15:16] nation
[1:15:18] i want us to think about this for a
[1:15:20] moment because
[1:15:21] even though there would be mercy for
[1:15:23] them in the future there came a time
[1:15:24] when the door of mercy to israel as a
[1:15:27] nation
[1:15:27] closed though his mercy endures forever
[1:15:32] though all these things were true
[1:15:35] mercy towards israel because remember
[1:15:36] his budget is for a certain time
[1:15:39] at a certain place and a certain people
[1:15:44] amen and so paul says not all israel is
[1:15:48] israel
[1:15:48] right a certain time a certain people
[1:15:51] a certain place now
[1:15:56] in in jesus time
[1:15:59] he wept over jerusalem and he cried out
[1:16:02] he said oh jerusalem how often i have
[1:16:05] hovered over but you would not
[1:16:08] and and they opposed their own mercy and
[1:16:10] they cried out
[1:16:12] in in such a a fashion as to say his
[1:16:16] blood be on us
[1:16:18] and on our children what a thing to say
[1:16:23] his blood be on us and on our children
[1:16:27] now look in luke 23 33 and when they
[1:16:31] were come to the place which is called
[1:16:32] calvary
[1:16:33] there they crucified him brother branham
[1:16:36] takes those those words there
[1:16:38] there they crucified him four words he
[1:16:41] said it's for the greatest words in
[1:16:42] jerusalem
[1:16:43] the most holy city in the world the most
[1:16:46] holy people
[1:16:47] they the most holy people in the world
[1:16:49] crucified the most brutal death in the
[1:16:50] world
[1:16:52] him the most important person in the
[1:16:53] world
[1:16:55] and they offended against their own
[1:16:58] mercy
[1:16:59] god even even god in flesh wept over
[1:17:02] jerusalem and they said no we don't want
[1:17:03] it
[1:17:07] and so brother brown said it was the
[1:17:08] only true religion in the world
[1:17:11] think about that the only true religion
[1:17:13] in the world
[1:17:14] standing there crucifying the very god
[1:17:17] that their bible said would come
[1:17:23] now when god closes the door he opens
[1:17:26] another one
[1:17:28] when god closed the door of mercy to the
[1:17:30] jews he opened it to the gentiles
[1:17:34] and the jews didn't understand that and
[1:17:36] it was shown
[1:17:38] that it was shown in the story of the
[1:17:40] woman who was caught in the act of
[1:17:41] adultery
[1:17:42] they they condemned her they said that's
[1:17:44] all the mercy god has
[1:17:46] there's no mercy for this woman god said
[1:17:49] there's mercy
[1:17:50] because when she come before jesus he
[1:17:52] said
[1:17:53] who condemns you and she said no man
[1:17:55] lord and jesus said neither do i condemn
[1:17:56] thee go and sin no more
[1:17:59] it didn't make sense to the jews that he
[1:18:02] would have mercy on her
[1:18:06] and sometimes you look at something and
[1:18:07] you look at somebody you say why are you
[1:18:09] even being nice to them
[1:18:10] well because we're supposed to be nice
[1:18:12] to everybody
[1:18:15] why even bother with them because
[1:18:19] i don't know they may be a seed of god
[1:18:24] why even bother why even bother with
[1:18:27] that person why be nice why be
[1:18:29] why be friendly amen
[1:18:32] he was friendly to us see the gentiles
[1:18:37] have been left for thousands of years in
[1:18:40] darkness
[1:18:41] but god was going to have a bride a
[1:18:44] people
[1:18:45] who he would extend his mercy towards
[1:18:48] amen that would not
[1:18:52] praise him and worship him just because
[1:18:54] of what he did
[1:18:55] but they would love him and they would
[1:18:58] not stray
[1:18:59] even though the denomination is time and
[1:19:00] time against straight but he said i'll
[1:19:02] have a bride who will not stray
[1:19:05] and that's us
[1:19:10] now look he says in romans
[1:19:14] it didn't make sense to the jews romans
[1:19:15] 9 and 30. what shall we say then the
[1:19:17] gentiles
[1:19:18] which follow not after righteousness
[1:19:20] have attained to righteousness
[1:19:22] even the righteousness which is of faith
[1:19:24] but israel which followed after the law
[1:19:25] of righteousness hath not attained
[1:19:27] to the law of righteousness wherefore he
[1:19:30] said because they sought it not by faith
[1:19:32] but as it were by the works of the law
[1:19:34] they stumbled at that stumbling stone
[1:19:36] they didn't understand how could god
[1:19:38] have mercy
[1:19:39] on people who don't deserve it they
[1:19:41] stumbled at that stumbling stone
[1:19:44] and as it is written behold i lay inside
[1:19:46] a stumbling stone in a rock of a fence
[1:19:48] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:19:50] be ashamed
[1:19:52] now look at this mercy extended down
[1:19:54] through seven church ages now
[1:19:55] he extended it from generation to
[1:19:58] generation and he extended mercy even to
[1:20:00] the non-elect
[1:20:01] because he said whosoever will may come
[1:20:04] so there's even a group of people that
[1:20:05] can be saved or can come to christ and
[1:20:08] come under that atonement because his
[1:20:10] budget for mercy
[1:20:12] but he budgeted especially for you
[1:20:16] [Music]
[1:20:17] but now we're coming down to the mercy
[1:20:20] for his bride now look
[1:20:22] god's mercy doesn't leave you in your
[1:20:23] condition
[1:20:26] amen it redeems you back
[1:20:29] what are you saying you have to be
[1:20:30] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:20:33] and sins
[1:20:35] amen brother branham and god rich and
[1:20:37] mercy and i'm
[1:20:38] i'm quoting some of this running through
[1:20:40] it without showing some of the quotes
[1:20:41] because it's just
[1:20:42] too much and you forgive me this morning
[1:20:45] but he says
[1:20:46] you were dead and many of you can look
[1:20:48] back and know that you were dead but you
[1:20:50] aren't dead tonight
[1:20:52] he said that was god rich and mercy
[1:20:55] amen amen you were a sinner but god who
[1:20:58] is rich in mercy
[1:21:00] and even talked about how when you were
[1:21:01] a child things were different and
[1:21:03] you felt that pull that tug on your
[1:21:05] heart why god rich in mercy
[1:21:08] amen amen and he talked about a duck
[1:21:12] born in a chicken house and how the duck
[1:21:16] would
[1:21:16] was born as a chicken and like was like
[1:21:18] the other chickens and one day
[1:21:20] he went out by the barn and he caught a
[1:21:22] smell of water
[1:21:24] and the day he caught that smell of
[1:21:25] water he immediately
[1:21:27] ran to the point because he was born to
[1:21:31] swim
[1:21:32] amen and so he says you have to be quick
[1:21:35] and it's like that duck
[1:21:37] that was in him already and it was
[1:21:39] quickened to life for the smell of water
[1:21:42] oh you know that's all we have to do
[1:21:44] that's all we have to do let's just get
[1:21:46] the smell of water in the air
[1:21:47] let's get the atmosphere right and
[1:21:49] children can be born ducks will run to
[1:21:51] it
[1:21:53] amen and some of the brandon picks that
[1:21:55] up and i will read this he said that's
[1:21:56] the same thing the believer is there's
[1:21:58] something in him
[1:21:58] that when he meets god face to face he
[1:22:01] comes to himself
[1:22:02] that seed is in him and it's quick and
[1:22:04] he said my that's right and he flies
[1:22:06] away from the things of the world
[1:22:08] they become dead to him he doesn't stay
[1:22:11] like that
[1:22:12] they become dead to him he said my i
[1:22:14] remember we all had our life in the past
[1:22:16] and those things of the world we all did
[1:22:18] every one of us
[1:22:19] did we had our life in the past of those
[1:22:22] things of the world
[1:22:23] none of us can say that we come to this
[1:22:25] message pure
[1:22:28] none of us can even if we were born in a
[1:22:31] message home
[1:22:32] even if we were raised on a church pew
[1:22:35] none of us come in pure
[1:22:37] every one of us was we were all found in
[1:22:40] sin born in sin shaping in iniquity
[1:22:42] amen but something quickened us
[1:22:46] and brother member says once we got a
[1:22:47] hold of the real thing something that
[1:22:49] quickened us a little seed to come to
[1:22:50] life
[1:22:51] and all the things of the world rotted
[1:22:53] right there we had no more desire of it
[1:22:56] amen he said he that's born of god does
[1:22:59] not commit sin the worshiper once
[1:23:00] purged has no more conscience of sin no
[1:23:02] more desire to sin
[1:23:04] the sin question is over yes you make
[1:23:06] mistakes yes you mess up but there's no
[1:23:08] more desire there to do it
[1:23:10] you don't want to go against god you
[1:23:11] don't want to run through the roadblocks
[1:23:13] you want to come towards
[1:23:14] god the sin question is over either
[1:23:18] it's not a question should i do it or
[1:23:19] should i not you know you shouldn't do
[1:23:21] it
[1:23:21] and you don't do it when you when you
[1:23:23] buy when you make a mistake you you
[1:23:25] repent quickly
[1:23:27] you can make a great mistake but you'll
[1:23:29] repent quickly
[1:23:33] now he says he says to
[1:23:38] the sin question is over you become a
[1:23:39] part of god in christ christ died to
[1:23:40] redeem you
[1:23:42] and just think and but the random talks
[1:23:43] about that in this sermon just think of
[1:23:45] all we would have been if it hadn't been
[1:23:46] for god
[1:23:48] but god in his rich mercy how he
[1:23:50] redeemed us out
[1:23:52] and where would we be if it hadn't been
[1:23:53] for that rich mercy
[1:23:55] amen but you know that's why god sent us
[1:23:59] a message
[1:24:00] this message was more than just do's and
[1:24:02] don'ts
[1:24:04] it was mercy
[1:24:07] it was mercy i don't want to reject
[1:24:09] mercy
[1:24:10] i don't want to live a holiness
[1:24:14] lifestyle even in dress and actions
[1:24:16] things like that
[1:24:16] just because just because well that's
[1:24:20] just what we do it's our tradition
[1:24:22] no we do it because we love
[1:24:25] god and we we don't have any desire to
[1:24:30] not do it anymore and the problem is the
[1:24:33] desire has to change
[1:24:36] the desire has to say there's got to be
[1:24:37] something in you you don't want
[1:24:39] well you don't have to tell a person
[1:24:40] with no desire you take a woman with no
[1:24:43] desire
[1:24:44] to attract the eye of a man you don't
[1:24:46] have to tell her to dress right
[1:24:49] huh she's got no desire she don't have a
[1:24:53] lust fail anymore
[1:24:55] she got a the veil of the holy spirit on
[1:24:58] her life
[1:25:01] amen and god sent us an end time message
[1:25:05] and told us those things even those
[1:25:07] little things about how we dress how we
[1:25:08] live
[1:25:08] things like that we think why would he
[1:25:09] tell us that because it's his mercy
[1:25:14] this mercy that can hold a family
[1:25:16] together
[1:25:17] this mercy that can bring you that can
[1:25:19] redeem you from a horrible background
[1:25:21] drugs alcohol whatever that is
[1:25:22] redeem you and bring you up to a
[1:25:24] full-fledged child of god
[1:25:27] let me tell you this this morning no
[1:25:28] matter what you've done where you've
[1:25:30] been you don't become a lesser child of
[1:25:31] god
[1:25:33] because of what you've done or what you
[1:25:36] might have struggled with and i know
[1:25:37] there's people
[1:25:38] i know that some of you have confessed
[1:25:40] things that
[1:25:41] and you talk to me about things and and
[1:25:43] you think well this is what i used to be
[1:25:45] and you struggle with that sometimes for
[1:25:46] years
[1:25:47] i know people sometimes struggle with
[1:25:48] different things in their life sometimes
[1:25:50] minor things but see it's no difference
[1:25:53] to god
[1:25:54] but but he'll make you a lesser son of
[1:25:56] god or lester daughter of god because of
[1:25:58] the way you were
[1:26:00] you're a full son of god or you're not
[1:26:03] at all
[1:26:05] his mercy endures for you or you're not
[1:26:07] elect at all
[1:26:08] does that make sense
[1:26:12] and we've talked about that before who's
[1:26:13] qualified to be the elect
[1:26:16] well you weren't if you want to take it
[1:26:19] by what you did
[1:26:21] why because the gentiles who followed
[1:26:23] not after righteousness
[1:26:24] have attained to righteousness amen
[1:26:28] amen and yet that mercy
[1:26:32] on the gentiles will not last forever
[1:26:35] it's limited in fact it's almost
[1:26:39] empty
[1:26:43] think about that the the age of mercy to
[1:26:47] the gentiles there's a limit on it
[1:26:50] and it's almost up
[1:26:54] that ought to make us want to reach out
[1:26:56] to every person
[1:26:59] don't you realize it's almost up and yet
[1:27:02] we live in such an age of hardness
[1:27:05] people can't be touched
[1:27:08] but here while there's still mercy the
[1:27:11] gentiles account is
[1:27:12] we know that it is because the age we
[1:27:14] live in we've been talking on wednesday
[1:27:15] night about
[1:27:16] we started last wednesday night about
[1:27:18] the breach and as we get into that you
[1:27:19] realize
[1:27:20] this is the time of transition this is
[1:27:22] it
[1:27:23] during the seventh angel sounding this
[1:27:26] is when the lamb leaves the mercy seat
[1:27:27] this is it
[1:27:30] somehow during this time you say you
[1:27:32] know every in and out every day and
[1:27:33] everything like this
[1:27:34] no but i know this he has mercy on me
[1:27:38] he'll have mercy on you but not
[1:27:42] unlimited in time
[1:27:45] there will come a day when it's over
[1:27:54] listen what paul tells the gentiles he
[1:27:55] said if god spared not the natural
[1:27:57] branches stay he lest he also spare not
[1:27:59] thee
[1:28:02] behold therefore the goodness and
[1:28:04] severity of god
[1:28:06] on them that fail severity towards the
[1:28:08] jews
[1:28:09] god was severe but toward thee goodness
[1:28:12] if thou continue in his goodness
[1:28:15] otherwise thou shalt be cut off
[1:28:17] the true understanding of election
[1:28:19] predestination and mercy
[1:28:20] doesn't make you sin more
[1:28:24] it doesn't make you make it easy for you
[1:28:27] to sin it makes it horrible
[1:28:29] it makes it hard because you realize
[1:28:32] what great love that's been shown toward
[1:28:34] you
[1:28:38] you see we shouldn't be arrogant because
[1:28:40] there is a limit of god's mercy to this
[1:28:42] age hebrews 6 and 4
[1:28:44] it says it speaks of a limit of mercy
[1:28:46] even on a personal level
[1:28:47] he said for it is impossible for those
[1:28:49] who are once enlightened and have tasted
[1:28:50] of the heavenly gift
[1:28:51] and were made partakers of the holy
[1:28:53] ghost and
[1:28:54] have tasted the good word of god
[1:28:57] and you know when they taste it they
[1:28:59] recognize it's the word of god
[1:29:02] and the powers of the world to come if
[1:29:04] they shall fall away to renew them again
[1:29:06] to repentance it's impossible
[1:29:08] seeing they crucified to themselves the
[1:29:10] son of god afresh put him to an open
[1:29:12] shame
[1:29:13] we could say it like this to jacob god
[1:29:15] gave
[1:29:16] opportunity after opportunity after
[1:29:18] opportunity
[1:29:19] the gentiles get seven church ages
[1:29:22] that's it
[1:29:24] it won't the door won't close and open
[1:29:26] back up again
[1:29:29] i know it's a sobering thought
[1:29:32] but that's why you don't speak against
[1:29:34] the holy ghost in this age
[1:29:37] right it's all you don't blaspheme
[1:29:41] because when you do you you get to where
[1:29:44] you say well
[1:29:45] how would i know well you wouldn't want
[1:29:47] to you wouldn't want to come back
[1:29:49] have no desire that's what's scary
[1:29:52] i'm not worried about those who struggle
[1:29:55] want to come back i want to come want to
[1:29:57] do right
[1:29:57] you worry about those who don't want to
[1:29:59] no more
[1:30:02] i don't want to no more i worked with
[1:30:03] two young people in a church not long
[1:30:05] ago and
[1:30:06] i worked with two young men and i
[1:30:07] watched those two young men's life
[1:30:09] and i've watched them over the years and
[1:30:11] the one young man was in the same family
[1:30:13] one of them was
[1:30:14] was just did some horrible things he was
[1:30:17] always messing up
[1:30:18] but there's something about his life
[1:30:20] that there's something about him i
[1:30:22] believe god's gonna working in his life
[1:30:24] and you can see that up and down in and
[1:30:26] out but god's working
[1:30:28] i saw another young man that was a good
[1:30:29] young man he just had no desire
[1:30:33] and as soon as he was old enough to quit
[1:30:34] church he just stopped coming to church
[1:30:35] didn't stop coming around and
[1:30:37] and fellowship and all those things just
[1:30:38] no desire that's a scary thing
[1:30:44] falling is not the problem it's when
[1:30:46] they don't get back
[1:30:47] up
[1:30:51] and again there won't be a second
[1:30:53] gentile age it's not like you get an
[1:30:54] opportunity and then god gives you
[1:30:56] another
[1:30:56] and then you get in this secret band of
[1:30:58] people who an airline pilot and a few
[1:31:00] other people in the movie and
[1:31:01] you know and and left behind and all
[1:31:03] these things that's not how god does
[1:31:05] things
[1:31:06] huh once it's over it's over
[1:31:11] but the member said i'd like to stop
[1:31:12] here on noah's witness and let you know
[1:31:14] this that there will come a time when
[1:31:16] men and women the church will be going
[1:31:18] right ahead preaching and believing
[1:31:19] they're getting saved
[1:31:20] and the door will be closed just like it
[1:31:23] was then
[1:31:25] he said if you're not in you get in now
[1:31:28] when would have been now he said brother
[1:31:30] ben you're preaching to the choir but
[1:31:31] every one of us needs to have an urgency
[1:31:33] in our lives
[1:31:34] now today is the day of salvation if i'm
[1:31:36] ever going to worship him now's the time
[1:31:38] if i'm ever going to
[1:31:39] get my kids and testify to my kids if
[1:31:41] i'm ever going to live a life
[1:31:42] today is today
[1:31:47] amen and so he says if you're not in
[1:31:50] getting now
[1:31:52] and so with the random goes on to talk
[1:31:54] about how elijah they said elias must
[1:31:56] first come and he said one day you
[1:31:57] realize what you're looking for has
[1:31:58] already passed
[1:32:01] and he said one of these days men and
[1:32:03] women will cry out it'll be too far be
[1:32:04] too late
[1:32:05] the door will be closed jesus said it
[1:32:06] would be that way the virgins come and
[1:32:08] knocked on the door and said let us in
[1:32:10] they wanted to get some of the oil but
[1:32:12] they ought to have got the oil
[1:32:13] got oil when oil was being given out
[1:32:18] mexico they ought to have got oil and
[1:32:20] oil was being given out they knocked on
[1:32:21] the door
[1:32:22] it said they were cast into outer
[1:32:24] darkness where they'll be weeping and
[1:32:25] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[1:32:26] look at romans chapter 11 verse 25 look
[1:32:29] at this for just a moment before we
[1:32:30] close
[1:32:31] he said for i would not brethren that
[1:32:32] you should be ignorant of this mystery
[1:32:34] unless you should be wise in your own
[1:32:36] conceits the blindness in part has
[1:32:38] happened to israel
[1:32:40] until the fullness of the gentiles
[1:32:41] become in the fullness the last one
[1:32:44] and so all israel should be saved as it
[1:32:46] is written there shall come out of zion
[1:32:48] the deliverer
[1:32:49] and he shall turn away ungodliness from
[1:32:50] jacob but this is my covenant unto them
[1:32:53] when i shall take away their sins as
[1:32:55] concerning the gospel their enemies for
[1:32:57] your sakes but as touching the election
[1:32:59] they are beloved for the father's sakes
[1:33:02] think about that statement people could
[1:33:05] be enemies to you
[1:33:07] for the gospel's sake i'm still elected
[1:33:11] it's true because that's the way the
[1:33:14] jews were
[1:33:16] he said for the gifts and callings of
[1:33:17] god are without repentance
[1:33:19] for as ye in times past have not
[1:33:21] believed god yet have now obtained mercy
[1:33:23] through their unbelief
[1:33:25] even so have these also now not believed
[1:33:27] that through your mercy
[1:33:29] they also may obtain mercy for god hath
[1:33:33] concluded them all in unbelief
[1:33:35] that he might have mercy upon all amen
[1:33:39] when does this happen when that last one
[1:33:41] comes in
[1:33:42] brother branham talks about how we
[1:33:43] believe in the coming of the lord we're
[1:33:44] looking forward to that but we don't
[1:33:45] know the day or the hour
[1:33:47] and he says this when the last one is
[1:33:48] saved there will not be
[1:33:50] one extra
[1:33:54] it'll be just so many and when that last
[1:33:57] one is brought in
[1:33:58] the body of christ is completed the
[1:34:00] rapture will come you say when will that
[1:34:02] be
[1:34:02] i don't know no one else knows
[1:34:07] could be today
[1:34:12] i might come out of the water and walk
[1:34:14] up to heaven
[1:34:18] we don't know none of us no i hope it's
[1:34:22] not because i've got other
[1:34:23] loved ones i want to see in the bride
[1:34:25] you understand i want to see them saved
[1:34:27] i know god will take care of my claim to
[1:34:29] them but i've got other loved ones i
[1:34:30] want to see saved
[1:34:31] but one day it will be the last one
[1:34:34] and none extra that's the budget that's
[1:34:36] it
[1:34:38] amen he came to redeem to bring back
[1:34:41] redeemers to bring back
[1:34:42] he says and when he brings the last one
[1:34:44] in he said at the right hand of god
[1:34:45] tonight doing his mediatorial work
[1:34:48] amen and when that last soul is saved
[1:34:51] that was redeemed and seen and known by
[1:34:53] god before the foundation of the world
[1:34:54] when the last soul is saved that closes
[1:34:58] the book it's over
[1:35:05] paul's thinking about these things in
[1:35:06] romans 11 and it begins to crowd like
[1:35:08] this
[1:35:09] he said all the depth of the riches amen
[1:35:13] both of the wisdom and knowledge of god
[1:35:17] how unsearchable are his judgments his
[1:35:19] way is past finding out
[1:35:21] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[1:35:22] who hath been his counselor who gives
[1:35:24] him advice
[1:35:25] who is first given to him and it shall
[1:35:27] be recompensed unto him again
[1:35:29] he'll never owe you anything
[1:35:33] who's first given to him and it shall be
[1:35:35] recommended unto him again for of him
[1:35:37] and through him and to him are all
[1:35:39] things
[1:35:40] to whom be glory forever
[1:35:44] you see there is enough mercy in the
[1:35:46] bank for every seed
[1:35:49] to be quickened and then the account is
[1:35:54] closed
[1:35:56] if you're in the budget
[1:36:00] you can't have not have enough mercy
[1:36:05] amen to make it in the rapture
[1:36:08] it's just impossible you understand
[1:36:12] it's just impossible so quit worrying
[1:36:13] well i've done too much no there's not
[1:36:16] that that's that's not even a thing
[1:36:19] even the whosoever will
[1:36:22] however many will can come
[1:36:26] how much more to the bride they knew you
[1:36:29] exactly where you would be what you
[1:36:31] would be and everything about your life
[1:36:33] and he says
[1:36:33] i've got so much grace for ben pruitt i
[1:36:36] did it
[1:36:37] and i said well i made stupid mistakes
[1:36:39] he said but i've got enough mercy enough
[1:36:41] grace
[1:36:41] to fill out that budget
[1:36:45] when i draw my last breath whether it's
[1:36:46] by way of the rapture or whether
[1:36:48] i go home by way of death when i draw
[1:36:51] that last breath
[1:36:52] the budget is complete
[1:36:56] with a zero balance
[1:37:00] you'll never run out before then
[1:37:03] if your gods
[1:37:07] how much is left you see the amount of
[1:37:10] mercy budgeted to your life is the
[1:37:11] amount you would need
[1:37:13] how about ought to make you want to cry
[1:37:14] like david worship with david
[1:37:18] but he said your mercy endures forever
[1:37:23] musicians go ahead and come there was a
[1:37:25] woman by the name of annie johnson flint
[1:37:31] she was a songwriter
[1:37:35] writer poems poetry
[1:37:38] and she got to a point
[1:37:41] where she couldn't write hardly anymore
[1:37:43] she had arthritis
[1:37:45] i watched people that suffer with that
[1:37:46] is such a horrible disease
[1:37:48] she got to the point where she was
[1:37:49] disabled she was unable to hardly do
[1:37:51] anything
[1:37:53] but she would still write her poetry and
[1:37:55] she wrote this song
[1:37:56] he giveth more grace when the burdens
[1:37:59] grow greater
[1:38:01] she knew something about that how much
[1:38:04] mercy would there be extended for annie
[1:38:05] johnson flint
[1:38:07] as much as she needed
[1:38:10] he sendeth more strength when the labors
[1:38:13] increase
[1:38:15] added afflictions he added his mercy
[1:38:18] to multiplied trials is multiplied peace
[1:38:22] you just keep going back to the atm of
[1:38:24] mercy and it's still there
[1:38:26] amen amen
[1:38:30] the course says his love has no limits
[1:38:33] his grace has no measure it's power
[1:38:36] no boundary known unto men for out of
[1:38:37] his infinite riches
[1:38:39] in jesus he giveth and giveth and giveth
[1:38:42] again
[1:38:44] and she went on to write when we have
[1:38:45] exhausted our store of endurance
[1:38:47] when our strength has failed when the
[1:38:50] day is half done
[1:38:51] when we reach the end of our hoarded
[1:38:53] resources
[1:38:54] our father's full giving has only begun
[1:38:57] fear not that thy need shall exceed his
[1:38:59] provision or god ever yearns
[1:39:01] his resources to share lean hard on the
[1:39:04] arm everlasting availing
[1:39:06] the father both be in that load will up
[1:39:09] bear
[1:39:09] would you bow your heads with me for
[1:39:11] just a moment
[1:39:14] he giveth the more grace when the
[1:39:17] burdens go greater
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:21] more mercy you say when brother ben when
[1:39:23] the mercy is needed
[1:39:27] but there will come a day when there's
[1:39:29] no more mercy
[1:39:31] and you don't know you don't know
[1:39:34] listen church i believe i'm the elect of
[1:39:36] god but if i'm not i want to be
[1:39:39] whosoever
[1:39:40] [Music]
[1:39:43] lord let me focus on your grace and your
[1:39:45] mercy
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:48] whatever part you would have for me to
[1:39:50] play i'd do it lord
[1:39:53] it won't be because i neglected to come
[1:39:56] it won't be because i neglected when you
[1:39:58] dealt with me you see if esau
[1:40:00] had been dealt with had come when he was
[1:40:02] dealt with the first time had not
[1:40:04] given up his birthright for a mess of
[1:40:06] pottage
[1:40:08] he could have had something some part
[1:40:11] but god knew that he wouldn't he said
[1:40:14] how do you know that because
[1:40:16] he told cain he said if you would do
[1:40:19] well
[1:40:21] take your brother's revelation and do
[1:40:23] what your brother does
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:27] you didn't have it for yourself but even
[1:40:29] cain he gave a choice but cain wouldn't
[1:40:30] do it because the seed that was in him
[1:40:33] every one of us have an opportunity have
[1:40:35] an opportunity for mercy today
[1:40:37] god rich in mercy you think about that
[1:40:40] don't think your kids have sinned
[1:40:42] past the point of them being right don't
[1:40:44] think that your family has gone past
[1:40:46] maybe
[1:40:47] somebody in your family well they've
[1:40:48] gone past the point they couldn't be
[1:40:50] bribed maybe there'd be something else
[1:40:51] don't think that
[1:40:52] because you don't know how much mercy
[1:40:54] god has
[1:40:55] for his elect you don't know what the
[1:40:57] budget is
[1:40:59] if that's the elect of god it'll be
[1:41:00] however much they need
[1:41:03] amen jacob had however much you needed
[1:41:06] david had however much you needed
[1:41:08] amen god help me today
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:14] he'll take you if you take advantage of
[1:41:16] that mercy he'll take you and seal you
[1:41:18] with the holy ghost
[1:41:20] amen so you can be sealed to your
[1:41:23] destination you won't ever want
[1:41:25] to go past his mercy again
[1:41:29] just talk to him a moment while we pray
[1:41:31] heavenly father
[1:41:33] lord we thank you for your mercy today
[1:41:35] i'm so grateful lord this
[1:41:38] service has gone differently than i
[1:41:39] thought it would
[1:41:41] but lord i'm so grateful for your mercy
[1:41:44] sometimes in these different moments
[1:41:46] you've got a reason for why things
[1:41:47] happen the way that they do
[1:41:50] i know i wish i could be like other
[1:41:52] preachers lord but i'm just myself i
[1:41:53] have to be myself and
[1:41:55] lord come before these people with my
[1:41:57] heart that's all i can bring i can't
[1:41:59] do any great thing but lord if i can
[1:42:02] just get out of the way enough to allow
[1:42:03] your mercy to flow
[1:42:05] oh god would you just do that in every
[1:42:08] one of us lord
[1:42:10] until we come in this last age and
[1:42:12] realize that mercy isn't for
[1:42:14] maybe for everybody but even for the
[1:42:16] bride the mercy flows from the bride
[1:42:20] oh god may we never
[1:42:23] get a spirit of harshness about us
[1:42:27] the time will be over soon enough lord
[1:42:30] while mercy is flowing
[1:42:32] would you help us lord to be merciful
[1:42:36] to be merciful to those around us lord
[1:42:39] to love those around us to
[1:42:41] treat them correctly and to respond
[1:42:44] quickly
[1:42:47] oh god it ought to be such an urgency in
[1:42:50] our hearts
[1:42:51] but the age is such a drag on us it's
[1:42:53] such a
[1:42:55] it causes us to become lethargic in our
[1:42:57] response
[1:42:58] like a person who's very sick and when
[1:43:01] your presence comes and things happen
[1:43:04] we just sit and not respond and
[1:43:07] lord if something happened like that we
[1:43:10] think that person is very sick and we
[1:43:11] see
[1:43:12] a world very sick today not responding
[1:43:15] to your mercy
[1:43:16] but lord when your mercy is shown may we
[1:43:18] be like even if we're like that
[1:43:19] prostitute woman
[1:43:20] lord that said i see that simon didn't
[1:43:22] wash his feet
[1:43:23] let me be the one let me be the one who
[1:43:25] worships you if no one else does
[1:43:27] i'm going to come to church i'm going to
[1:43:29] live for god i'm going to work
[1:43:30] i'm going to put my all into the service
[1:43:33] because i believe
[1:43:34] your mercy endures forever i know it
[1:43:37] endured for me
[1:43:38] i believe it will endure for others for
[1:43:41] you granted lord
[1:43:42] we're living even past the time we look
[1:43:45] merciest
[1:43:46] shut up to the denominations they've
[1:43:47] crucified you afresh

[1:43:51] still that could have mercy you could
[1:43:53] have mercy on i pray you'd grant it
[1:43:55] today
[1:43:56] i pray you'd move lord in our midst lord

[1:44:08] that moment comes we'll go home

[1:46:20] i believe god is able to keep us all
[1:46:22] don't you
[1:46:24] aren't you glad he has you look back
[1:46:27] down in your life and say every time you
[1:46:28] stumble
[1:46:29] god lifted you up
[1:46:32] and every time you something might have
[1:46:34] happened and
[1:46:36] you just you could have destroyed your
[1:46:38] life and god brought you out maybe you
[1:46:40] did destroy your life

[1:46:45] anyway
[1:46:47] how wonderful he is his mercy endures
[1:46:50] forever
[1:46:52] david i can see them clashing the
[1:46:54] symbols and worshiping god that is mercy
[1:46:56] endures forever
[1:46:58] we had a temple and we didn't serve god
[1:47:00] we didn't live for god we didn't do what
[1:47:02] was right
[1:47:03] and so the temple was burned down but
[1:47:04] now we got another temple
[1:47:06] amen hallelujah
[1:47:10] can you imagine how they'll feel on that
[1:47:12] day of atonement when those jews realize
[1:47:14] what they've done
[1:47:16] he said they realized that we crucified
[1:47:18] him he said where'd you get those scars
[1:47:19] in the house of my friends
[1:47:21] you imagine what that'll be like for the
[1:47:23] job of the steward to
[1:47:25] just when they stand there and realize
[1:47:26] what they've done and how they rejected
[1:47:28] him all these years
[1:47:29] with that 144 000 you think there won't
[1:47:31] be some worship going on
[1:47:33] you think there won't be some rejoicing
[1:47:35] going on the jews know how to worship
[1:47:37] they know how to dance before the lord
[1:47:39] and i believe they'll be doing it why
[1:47:41] because his mercy
[1:47:42] endures forever from generation to
[1:47:45] generation through a holy ghost through
[1:47:46] all these things
[1:47:47] all this persecution his mercy into us

[1:47:57] heart lord i worship you
[1:47:58] because your mercy endures forever amen
