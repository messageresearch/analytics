[44:50] but you've probably noticed and uh
[44:53] that uh
[44:54] sister noli uh jackson and levi
[44:58] eucla have been coming to church and uh
[45:00] and they've been uh
[45:02] going with one another for a while i
[45:04] actually grew up together i've known
[45:06] these kids for a long time i think of
[45:08] them as kids because
[45:10] they were i think both about six years
[45:11] old when i met them and uh was in church
[45:14] with them for about a decade and and boy
[45:16] they got old fast i don't age at all
[45:18] during that time i didn't age at all but
[45:20] they got old fast but
[45:22] but they're they've grown up and it's
[45:24] it's been my privilege to work with them
[45:27] as they're uh contemplating marriage and
[45:30] so they are now officially engaged so
[45:32] let's let's give them a hand tonight
[45:40] it's always a blessing to see a young
[45:42] couple start to come to church and and
[45:45] they wanted to stay in church and
[45:46] they've decided to make this their
[45:47] church home and so we're we want to
[45:50] welcome them and if there's anything we
[45:51] can do for you and uh
[45:54] we'll be here for you and as a church i
[45:56] think they're going to try to do their
[45:57] wedding here
[45:58] and so we'll just try to
[46:00] be a part and and they don't have other
[46:02] family here so let's try to be as
[46:04] friendly as we can and support this
[46:06] young couple and be a part of their
[46:08] lives we're family aren't we
[46:10] and uh we we are closer sometimes to
[46:12] people we go to church with than we are
[46:13] to our own families and and there's a
[46:16] reason for that we have something in
[46:17] common and that something is the lord
[46:19] jesus amen and that's a god bless you
[46:21] guys i i wish you the best and
[46:24] congratulations from for me and my wife
[46:27] uh
[46:28] we uh had a little work done peter if
[46:30] you can pull up brother robert hill
[46:32] brother robert there pull up that uh
[46:34] slide it's not in my sermon notes but uh
[46:38] there's a slide there from uh of a
[46:40] sermon that we translated into
[46:43] arabic
[46:44] and so this is our first one we've done
[46:46] first full sermon we did a couple of
[46:47] booklets while we were there
[46:49] but this one's got done just a couple of
[46:51] days ago so i was so excited
[46:53] to see this for the believers there
[46:56] you're we're reaching a part of the
[46:58] world that has never been reached with
[46:59] the message and as far as i know is the
[47:01] first time this sermon's ever been
[47:03] translated into arabic and so thank you
[47:06] for that thank you for being a part and
[47:08] for putting
[47:09] your finances behind it your prayers
[47:11] behind it and this church is as small as
[47:14] we are but we've really uh had an impact
[47:17] in the country of egypt you have and and
[47:20] by being able me and brother joel were
[47:21] able to go because of you and so we're
[47:23] grateful for that and they're trying to
[47:25] get us to come back i'm trying to find a
[47:27] way for me not to go and maybe send
[47:29] brother joel but they're going to have
[47:30] some meetings in february
[47:32] and we'll be praying just keep them in
[47:34] your prayers there's some good people
[47:36] there and they're poor people but they
[47:38] really love the lord and so i wanted to
[47:40] show that to you let you know there's
[47:41] work ongoing and actually another pastor
[47:44] just this week has let me know he's
[47:46] going to be supporting it as well and
[47:48] other pastors are looking at it so we're
[47:50] we're excited about that and we can't do
[47:52] it all ourselves
[47:53] we run out of money pretty quick we
[47:55] found out on that trip but but the lord
[47:57] has blessed us and i i thank you for
[47:59] that and and for your giving
[48:02] spirit and and for your prayers we thank
[48:04] you beyond our expectations and now
[48:07] we're beginning to get the message in a
[48:09] place uh where it's not been and so
[48:11] we're thankful for that when that last
[48:13] one comes in we get to go home
[48:16] and there ain't nothing bigger than that
[48:19] all right
[48:20] amen i want to see this young couple get
[48:22] married but if the lord comes ahead of
[48:24] time hey
[48:25] i'm okay with that
[48:27] amen i i want to see the last one come
[48:30] in and so maybe they'll read that book
[48:33] and you've had a hand in translating it
[48:36] so you remember that
[48:39] we have another a
[48:41] couple of services probably on jonah but
[48:43] i'm going to go away from that tonight
[48:44] and touch on something else this weekend
[48:46] i won't be here
[48:48] brother
[48:50] stewart will be here sunday morning by
[48:51] the malachi got on sunday afternoon if
[48:53] you can to stay for that sunday
[48:54] afternoon service i know it's hard right
[48:56] now it's not going to be that hot we are
[48:58] getting a new ac unit probably next week
[49:01] i believe something like that what's
[49:03] that tomorrow praise god so if he's able
[49:06] to do that tomorrow you'll have air
[49:08] conditioning so you won't have any
[49:09] excuse to be be here with brother
[49:11] malachi and i just since i'm not going
[49:14] to be here he's a young minister and i
[49:16] feel like that we should support
[49:18] him as a church he seems like a real
[49:20] determined young man he's got family
[49:22] here in the church so let's
[49:23] be praying for that
[49:25] and then we'll be gone this weekend but
[49:26] we'll be coming back
[49:28] and i'll be here next wednesday let's
[49:30] stand together
[49:32] do you love the lord tonight
[49:34] isn't god good to us
[49:36] beyond our wildest expectations and
[49:39] dreams and
[49:40] you don't know what tomorrow holds we
[49:42] found that out as studying jonah and
[49:44] will continue to do that we found out
[49:46] that we don't have control over the big
[49:48] picture god does
[49:50] god does and they we may find ourselves
[49:52] in the belly of a fish
[49:54] but god knows why we're there
[49:56] and he's going to make it work for our
[49:58] good and i'm so grateful for that let's
[50:00] bow our heads once again for a word of
[50:02] prayer heavenly father
[50:04] lord we're so grateful to be here in
[50:05] your presence and to know that you're
[50:08] near and you're you're with us every
[50:10] every day and we thank you for that lord
[50:12] especially with this group of people how
[50:14] it warms my heart on a wednesday night
[50:16] to see them come together and and lord
[50:19] some of them elderly some of them young
[50:21] but lord a group of people that can come
[50:22] together and hear your word and those
[50:24] also that are watching tonight i i pray
[50:27] you give them a special blessing lord
[50:29] that you give us strength to to fight
[50:31] the battle lord to keep pressing lord
[50:33] spreading the light lord we didn't bring
[50:35] the light but we can spread it lord and
[50:37] we can become the word lord revealed
[50:40] word to our generation i pray you'd help
[50:42] us to do that lord we pray until that
[50:44] great day that you come and take us home
[50:47] we ask it in jesus name amen amen
[50:50] matthew 23 23 i just want to read this
[50:53] one verse of scripture just something i
[50:55] had them on my heart you just bear with
[50:57] me in my folly tonight if you will and i
[51:00] want to speak to you tonight
[51:02] uh about keeping our balance keeping our
[51:05] balance we sure want to do that don't we
[51:07] in the word of god matthew 23 23 woe
[51:10] unto you
[51:11] scribes and pharisees hypocrites
[51:14] for you pay tithes of mint
[51:16] and anees and cumin and have omitted the
[51:20] weightier matters of the law
[51:22] judgment mercy and faith
[51:26] these ought you to have done
[51:28] and not to leave the other
[51:30] undone for the lord would add his
[51:32] blessing to the word you may be seated
[51:35] this evening
[51:39] men die but spirits don't
[51:42] the pharisees were
[51:44] almost like the pentecostals of their
[51:46] day they
[51:48] they believed in miracles and the
[51:49] sadducees did not they were more like
[51:51] the fundamentalist group of the day that
[51:54] we live in today we might identify that
[51:56] with the baptist church or the lutheran
[51:58] church something like that with the
[52:00] old-line protestantism
[52:02] and and the pharisees were more like the
[52:04] pentecostals of their day
[52:06] and you see that and why jesus spent
[52:09] more time with the pharisees because
[52:11] i they they actually had more interest
[52:14] in his ministry than the sadducees did
[52:16] the sadducees were actually the ruling
[52:18] party in that day the pharisees didn't
[52:20] even run the country the high priest was
[52:23] a sadducee but the pharisees were the
[52:25] ones if we could put it that way closest
[52:27] to the light and they were also the ones
[52:29] that were the most wrong
[52:31] because they were closer but they
[52:33] couldn't see that christ was there in
[52:36] flesh and and so
[52:38] jesus tells them he says you you've
[52:40] neglected the weightier matters of the
[52:42] law you've omitted or you failed to deal
[52:46] with
[52:47] the weightier matters of the law and the
[52:50] reason why you've omitted the weight of
[52:52] your matters which he identifies as as
[52:55] judgment mercy and faith
[52:58] he said you failed to identify or to
[53:01] include that in your preaching
[53:03] in your practice in your teaching you
[53:05] failed to include that and instead
[53:07] you've included uh you've included these
[53:10] things that are in the law that are just
[53:13] maybe on the edges of it and you've made
[53:15] your opinions to be gospel and when you
[53:17] make your opinions the gospel you've
[53:20] added to the word
[53:21] what the pharisees did is they did
[53:23] something that
[53:24] theologians call they fenced the law
[53:27] they fenced the law and what that means
[53:30] is that they they would put fences
[53:32] around the law so a good example is is
[53:34] thou shalt not take the name of thy lord
[53:36] thy god in vain they would take that and
[53:39] not only would they not do that
[53:40] consciously but they said well if we say
[53:42] god's name we may be taking it in vain
[53:45] so what they would do is they would just
[53:47] remove all the vowels
[53:49] they actually did that they removed all
[53:51] the vowels from the name of god and so
[53:54] they would not say and even today a a
[53:56] conservative jew will not say god's name
[54:00] even when they write it there will be a
[54:01] g and a slash and a d there won't be a a
[54:06] vowel there because they built a fence
[54:08] around that commandment and you say well
[54:10] that's a good thing well but he didn't
[54:12] just say if you take away from the word
[54:15] but if you add to it
[54:17] so jesus goes on and we'll read it later
[54:19] to talk about how that they
[54:21] bound up heavy burdens
[54:23] and what that is is they would actually
[54:25] create a law they would create word
[54:29] things that had to be followed and judge
[54:31] people based off of that instead of
[54:33] looking at the weightier matters of the
[54:35] law
[54:36] so you find again one party denied
[54:38] miracles and the resurrection the other
[54:41] believed they were saved by their works
[54:43] both were wrong
[54:45] now
[54:46] the pharisees in particular lacked
[54:49] balance
[54:50] because they neglected these weightier
[54:51] matters
[54:53] and
[54:54] i just preached to you from my heart
[54:55] tonight it's disheartening to see folks
[54:58] today settling into those camps and i
[55:00] don't want us to ever do that and if we
[55:02] have done that at times i know what
[55:04] times the church will go a certain
[55:06] direction and and then it'll move back
[55:08] another direction and that's normal you
[55:10] don't hold a steering wheel steel when
[55:12] you're going down the highway
[55:14] right it moves
[55:16] and so you're actually constantly
[55:18] there's play in the steering wheel and
[55:20] in order for you to go straight
[55:22] and so many times you'll go back and
[55:24] forth but we want to stay as close as we
[55:26] can with the scriptures how many agree
[55:29] with that tonight we just want to stay
[55:31] just as close as we can with the word we
[55:33] want to stay as close to the message of
[55:34] the hour as we can stay because god did
[55:37] not call me to bring a message
[55:40] and i don't want to put that burden on
[55:42] myself
[55:44] or put that burden on you
[55:46] god called a prophet in this day
[55:49] a prophet in this day one messenger to
[55:51] bring a message to the age
[55:54] now
[55:56] we can take scriptures and quotes and
[55:57] fight one another with it
[56:00] we can become extremists
[56:02] who fight with other extremists
[56:05] right in the other ditch
[56:08] right and i've preached on some of these
[56:09] things before but i just wanted it was
[56:11] on my heart tonight i just wanted to
[56:13] kind of deal with it
[56:14] as i was going to be going over the
[56:16] weekend now
[56:18] it's a serious issue though it's not say
[56:20] well it doesn't really matter but it
[56:21] does matter because our children are
[56:24] watching
[56:25] and they have to deal with the effects
[56:28] of our fights of our of our fusses of
[56:32] our of our constant aggravations on one
[56:35] another they deal with that and
[56:37] and what happens many times is when
[56:39] you're a legalist and you just bear with
[56:41] me tonight but when you're illegal it's
[56:43] what happens is you put yourself in a in
[56:45] a trap
[56:46] you actually trap yourself because what
[56:49] you've done is you've presented a gospel
[56:51] that has to be lived a certain way and
[56:54] your children can see past that and they
[56:55] can say well you don't fit this part of
[56:57] the scripture your life fails in this
[56:59] way and yet in this one thing you've
[57:02] made a legalistic doctrine out of it and
[57:04] maybe you won't have a christmas tree
[57:06] but you'll
[57:07] you'll do everything else you'll scream
[57:09] and holler and get angry and all these
[57:11] things and and do things you shouldn't
[57:13] do well everybody makes mistakes right
[57:16] but what you do by becoming legalistic
[57:18] on one point say well then people can't
[57:19] be saved if they do that
[57:22] when you do that you've actually backed
[57:24] yourself into a trap
[57:26] right because your children look at that
[57:28] and say well you did things that were
[57:29] wrong
[57:31] aren't you glad for the grace of god
[57:34] aren't you glad for the mercy of
[57:35] almighty god
[57:37] and many times good brothers and sisters
[57:39] do that and and i preached to you when i
[57:41] first came here or a few months after
[57:43] about how we shouldn't demonize the
[57:46] person
[57:47] we should always look at we don't want
[57:49] to become what we hate
[57:51] right we should always we should always
[57:53] leave for the personal matter out of it
[57:55] and just try to stay with the word and
[57:57] and not demonize people because a person
[57:59] can be wrong and yet be a child of god
[58:02] a person even a preacher can be wrong at
[58:05] times
[58:06] and still be a child of god
[58:08] still be a son of god still be a man of
[58:10] god
[58:11] and if we're not careful we
[58:13] we build up so many things and destroy
[58:15] so many people by our actions by our
[58:17] words that we end up with no one that
[58:19] our children can have any confidence in
[58:21] at all and what's going to happen
[58:24] in the future if they grow up and
[58:25] there's no one alive that's right
[58:28] you see the problem with me being the
[58:29] last minister that's correct is that
[58:32] what are my children going to do if the
[58:33] lord tarries
[58:36] do i have to anoint the next one
[58:38] like they do in some groups that's not
[58:40] how god works
[58:42] somebody out there has got it right and
[58:43] probably more right than me
[58:46] are you with me now
[58:48] because it wasn't up to me i didn't
[58:49] bring the message
[58:51] the message come to the age
[58:53] but branham said i was just reading the
[58:55] history of martin luther and one of his
[58:57] books was wrote on him here not long ago
[58:59] they said it wasn't so mysterious that
[59:01] martin luther could protest the catholic
[59:02] church and get by with him but to hold
[59:04] his head above all the fanaticism that
[59:06] followed his revival
[59:08] he said as that there goes there's a
[59:09] mixed multitude with every revival you
[59:11] know that he said but now remember that
[59:13] only indicates that there's a real one
[59:15] when you see a bogus dollar or
[59:17] somebody's making out like they got
[59:18] something just remember there's one
[59:20] genuine kids remember that
[59:23] young people young couple remember that
[59:25] if you see a bogus dollar don't get
[59:27] discouraged there's a real one somewhere
[59:30] you see somebody that don't live it
[59:31] don't get discouraged there's a real one
[59:33] somewhere but remember even good genuine
[59:35] articles make mistakes we don't we
[59:37] cannot live the law
[59:40] that's why we have grace
[59:42] and we are supposed to live a life
[59:44] worthy of the gospel but we only do that
[59:46] by the holy spirit
[59:48] we can't do that by our own effort
[59:51] now
[59:53] so he said that original so you know
[59:55] that can't be the original so there has
[59:56] to be an original he said and that
[59:58] original is the real jesus christ
[1:00:02] he said the one that's here that knows
[1:00:04] every secret in your heart right now
[1:00:06] aren't you glad for the original one
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] what is balance
[1:00:13] is maintaining your position in the
[1:00:16] middle of truth
[1:00:18] not between the two extremes
[1:00:21] and it's a mistaken idea and i've
[1:00:23] probably said it before but people say
[1:00:25] well i'm going to be in the middle of
[1:00:26] the road between the liberal and the
[1:00:28] conservative between no the balance is
[1:00:30] in the middle of the word
[1:00:32] the middle of the scripture says brother
[1:00:34] branham put it we want to stay in the
[1:00:36] middle of the bible
[1:00:37] in other words we want to be able to run
[1:00:39] what we believe all the way through the
[1:00:40] scriptures
[1:00:41] all the way through the message
[1:00:43] not just take one quote here or one
[1:00:45] there not just take one scripture here
[1:00:47] but to take the whole thing
[1:00:50] we're not offended by any quote
[1:00:53] we're not offended by any a man could
[1:00:55] stand here and preach the word to us so
[1:00:56] we'd say amen and another man come
[1:00:58] preach another side of it we could say
[1:01:00] amen
[1:01:01] we're not offended by it because what is
[1:01:03] it it's a
[1:01:04] it's the middle of truth
[1:01:07] right and and we have to present that
[1:01:09] now
[1:01:11] brother brown said we pray
[1:01:13] he's praying for pastors and officers of
[1:01:15] the church
[1:01:16] he said we pray that he'll give these
[1:01:18] men understanding
[1:01:20] we need understanding tonight
[1:01:22] not only as a pastor but also the
[1:01:24] officers of the church he's praying for
[1:01:26] trustees and deacons he said we pray
[1:01:29] he'll give these men understanding that
[1:01:30] they'll never get off on the wrong side
[1:01:32] but stay right straight in the middle of
[1:01:34] the road with it
[1:01:36] never be exalted or anything whenever
[1:01:37] you do you're finished right there just
[1:01:40] stay humble with it
[1:01:42] when you handle the word with humility
[1:01:44] it's a whole lot easier to stay in the
[1:01:46] middle of the road it's hard to keep
[1:01:47] your balance when your head is swollen
[1:01:51] when your ego is swollen
[1:01:53] when you feel like you're the only one
[1:01:55] that's got it right it's hard to keep
[1:01:57] your balance
[1:01:58] paul put it this way in second timothy 2
[1:02:00] 15 study that word is to work to be
[1:02:03] diligent to show yourself approved unto
[1:02:06] god a workman that needeth not to be
[1:02:08] ashamed
[1:02:09] rightly dividing
[1:02:11] the word of truth and we've dealt with
[1:02:13] that before how that's proportioning the
[1:02:16] word to the age to the correct age that
[1:02:18] we're in
[1:02:19] now if we if we want to do a service for
[1:02:21] god
[1:02:22] and all of us want to anyone do a
[1:02:23] service for god we should all want to
[1:02:26] and when we do that we've got to
[1:02:28] consider what we're doing and make sure
[1:02:30] that we're not just doing something
[1:02:32] because sometimes just doing something
[1:02:34] can get you in trouble that's where
[1:02:35] david he got in trouble even what he was
[1:02:37] doing was right but he did it in the
[1:02:38] wrong way
[1:02:40] so we want to consider what we're doing
[1:02:43] right not not just take it and and well
[1:02:45] these are quotes these are scriptures
[1:02:47] we'll do it no it's got to be under the
[1:02:48] leadership of the holy ghost and there's
[1:02:50] got to be some things in place first
[1:02:52] brother branham said there was five must
[1:02:54] he said it's got to be
[1:02:56] his time his season
[1:02:58] when he when he said it would be the man
[1:03:00] that he chose
[1:03:01] he said it must come to the prophet and
[1:03:03] the prophet must be a vindicated prophet
[1:03:06] so his time his season when he said it
[1:03:09] would be or his time is season that's
[1:03:11] when he said it would be the man that he
[1:03:13] chose must come to the prophet the
[1:03:15] prophet must be a vindicated prophet he
[1:03:17] said we find many of them in the bible
[1:03:19] he said it come to the prophets and it
[1:03:20] wasn't vindicated he said our prophet is
[1:03:23] jesus christ
[1:03:25] i like that we we know he's vindicated
[1:03:28] but we know we had a messenger in our
[1:03:30] day now
[1:03:31] brother branham uses the example of
[1:03:33] moses building an ark
[1:03:35] right if he had built an ark in his day
[1:03:36] it wouldn't have been the right season
[1:03:38] right
[1:03:39] it was in the word
[1:03:41] but it was only
[1:03:42] a light for a certain day
[1:03:45] right now he also used the example of
[1:03:47] jesus bringing the law
[1:03:49] he said jesus didn't have to go out
[1:03:51] there and and take ten commandments and
[1:03:53] tablets of stone and throw him on the
[1:03:55] ground why because he was the law
[1:03:58] right he was the fulfillment of the law
[1:04:01] and i think a lot of our balanced
[1:04:04] problems and again i'm speaking to us
[1:04:06] here tonight
[1:04:07] i think a lot of our problems with
[1:04:09] balance would be solved if we knew where
[1:04:11] we were at
[1:04:13] and what message we were listening to
[1:04:17] and again i think it's so important we
[1:04:18] understand the book has been open
[1:04:20] notice brother brown said the book
[1:04:22] written he said when this angel finishes
[1:04:24] all these loose end mysteries that
[1:04:26] through the battle they fought luther
[1:04:28] fought so there's always been a battle
[1:04:30] right there's always a battle for the
[1:04:32] middle of the road
[1:04:34] always always will be that's not a bad
[1:04:37] thing
[1:04:38] we want to know where the middle of the
[1:04:39] road is
[1:04:40] right we have to fight for that
[1:04:43] but it don't mean we have to we don't
[1:04:44] have to kill our brothers and sisters
[1:04:46] but we fight the devil
[1:04:49] right and so we fight a battle for the
[1:04:50] middle of the road he said the battle
[1:04:52] they fought luther fought wesley fought
[1:04:54] the pentecostals fought but there's
[1:04:55] coming one says the bible in the days of
[1:04:58] his sounding all these mysteries he said
[1:05:00] the oneness run off on jesus name the
[1:05:02] trinity went off on father son and holy
[1:05:04] ghost just like they did at the nicea
[1:05:06] council same thing they both was wrong
[1:05:08] but now in the middle of the road in the
[1:05:10] scriptures lays out the truth
[1:05:13] but you'll find this applies to every
[1:05:15] area and so then you can say it this way
[1:05:18] the balance is the message
[1:05:22] right the book wasn't open it they had
[1:05:24] an unbalanced luther had an unbalanced
[1:05:26] wesley had it unbalanced
[1:05:29] right but when the book come open it it
[1:05:30] was balanced
[1:05:32] right so the message is the balance
[1:05:34] oh i'm so glad for a message today
[1:05:37] and so now we should have a balance and
[1:05:40] that balance should extend not only to
[1:05:41] our doctrine but to our families to our
[1:05:44] home life to the way we do courtship and
[1:05:46] dating to the way we do
[1:05:49] the way we do
[1:05:50] christmas to the way we the way we treat
[1:05:52] one another are you with me
[1:05:54] the way husbands treat their wives and
[1:05:56] wives treat their husbands that balance
[1:05:58] should be there
[1:05:59] and it should extend into every area why
[1:06:01] because the message touches on all of
[1:06:04] those things
[1:06:05] and it brings it down it doesn't bring a
[1:06:07] new bible a new scripture but it opens
[1:06:09] it up and it balances it to where we can
[1:06:11] see what it is in our day
[1:06:14] are you with me now
[1:06:16] uh because here was somebody god had to
[1:06:18] call somebody who wouldn't balance the
[1:06:20] word according to his own prejudice
[1:06:24] are you hear me because if i had been
[1:06:26] called to do that or if i had done it i
[1:06:28] would have actually balanced it
[1:06:30] according to the prejudices i was raised
[1:06:32] up in but god had to call a kentucky
[1:06:33] hillbilly who didn't know anything he
[1:06:36] wasn't raised in church
[1:06:38] are you with me now and he revealed to
[1:06:40] him the truth what was it so he could
[1:06:42] have the right balance
[1:06:44] so we could have the right balance
[1:06:47] hope you hear me now
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:51] and i think in in saying that then
[1:06:53] in keeping our balance if we keep our
[1:06:56] focus on the message
[1:06:58] instead of on what everybody else is
[1:06:59] doing we would maintain our balance
[1:07:02] and i've had conversations with other
[1:07:03] ministers about that and i had one admit
[1:07:06] to me said you know he said when when i
[1:07:07] get my eyes off of the message i begin
[1:07:09] to get skewed one way or another but
[1:07:12] when i stay in the message when i keep
[1:07:14] when i stay with a prophet he said
[1:07:17] and feed off of that and take my my
[1:07:18] messages from the scriptures and from
[1:07:20] the and from the prophet and from the
[1:07:22] things that have been brought to us in
[1:07:24] our day he said i stay balanced and i
[1:07:26] thought well that's that's right because
[1:07:28] what we do is we get our eyes on what
[1:07:30] everybody else is doing and it caused us
[1:07:32] to to begin to tip over and begin to get
[1:07:34] a little maybe legalistic in this area
[1:07:36] or a little bit off in this area the
[1:07:38] pharisees thought they were doing a good
[1:07:39] thing they thought they were saving the
[1:07:41] world from the liberal sadducees
[1:07:44] all right they they thought they were
[1:07:46] they thought oh them sadducees they're
[1:07:48] so liberal they don't even believe in we
[1:07:50] we believe in a resurrection we believe
[1:07:51] in miracles they thought they were doing
[1:07:52] a good thing but they actually could not
[1:07:54] even recognize christ when he came
[1:07:56] because their tradition made the word of
[1:07:58] none effect
[1:08:02] now
[1:08:03] you know if you've been around for very
[1:08:05] long but j.t has been around a long time
[1:08:06] some of you other brothers have been
[1:08:07] around a long time
[1:08:09] and i won't say how long but harvey and
[1:08:12] and brother bill curtis some of you
[1:08:13] brother danny i you've been around along
[1:08:15] some of you young people have been
[1:08:16] around a long time brother alan you know
[1:08:18] it feels like we're being raised in this
[1:08:19] message sometimes that we've you know
[1:08:21] we've been around a long time and we're
[1:08:24] young men but but we've seen just about
[1:08:26] everything i know brother allen has and
[1:08:28] i have and and and we've seen uh
[1:08:31] thunder's movements and
[1:08:33] and we've seen uh we've seen uh uh
[1:08:35] people that were emotional and people
[1:08:37] that were unemotional and people that
[1:08:39] were
[1:08:39] people that were one way or another in
[1:08:41] different kinds of doctrines and we
[1:08:43] fought skirmishes over christmas trees
[1:08:46] and and battles over the seventh seal
[1:08:48] and
[1:08:49] wars over the son of man ministry and
[1:08:52] and and world wars over whether or not
[1:08:53] we should play tapes in church and
[1:08:56] and most of those have been put behind
[1:08:58] us
[1:09:00] and but but the battle is always there
[1:09:02] and again it's not necessarily a bad
[1:09:03] thing when you see that don't get
[1:09:04] discouraged but just try to find your
[1:09:07] balance in the message
[1:09:09] and in the scripture
[1:09:10] so
[1:09:11] we've seen all of that and we begin to
[1:09:13] put it behind us as as you begin to get
[1:09:16] older and you begin to realize that some
[1:09:18] things you some things are not as
[1:09:20] necessary as others
[1:09:22] and that word when jesus says he said
[1:09:24] the waiter matters that word is
[1:09:26] important
[1:09:28] the important things
[1:09:31] like love and faith and mercy
[1:09:34] and judgment
[1:09:36] important things
[1:09:38] right those things are important some
[1:09:39] things are not
[1:09:42] right and that's where a lot of the
[1:09:43] battle comes in now is what's important
[1:09:46] well again if we just stay in the
[1:09:48] message
[1:09:48] and be willing to surrender ourselves to
[1:09:50] all of it to the open book
[1:09:53] in our day i think we'd have a lot
[1:09:54] better balance but sometimes we we let
[1:09:57] our prejudices come in
[1:09:59] and if we're a person that likes a
[1:10:01] certain thing we we want to find a quote
[1:10:03] to to like it
[1:10:05] you know and for a person that don't
[1:10:06] like a certain thing we want to find a
[1:10:07] quote to dislike it
[1:10:09] and chances are over time you will
[1:10:12] because a prophet in balancing this
[1:10:13] message he'd bring one side and he'd
[1:10:15] bring the other and and he'd preach
[1:10:17] different things at different times to
[1:10:18] different people he wasn't being
[1:10:21] being disreputable or lying to people
[1:10:23] what was he doing balancing it out
[1:10:26] and you've got to take the whole thing
[1:10:29] right not just part of it
[1:10:31] now
[1:10:32] these things are necessary you got to
[1:10:34] work to keep your balance if you're
[1:10:35] walking a tightrope you're not standing
[1:10:37] up there just running along it some
[1:10:39] people might but if you're walking a
[1:10:41] tightrope over the grand canyon you're
[1:10:42] going to be working at it
[1:10:44] constantly moving to keep your balance
[1:10:47] and that's what we want to do now
[1:10:49] but we have to have some absolute
[1:10:52] right
[1:10:53] because if there's not anything that's
[1:10:54] correct
[1:10:56] how can we ever if there's no
[1:10:58] median if there's no balance point
[1:11:02] how can we ever keep a balance
[1:11:05] right there's got to be a balance point
[1:11:08] there's got to be something where we can
[1:11:10] come in agreement on the major things
[1:11:13] is when we realize that the balance
[1:11:15] point is the message of the hour
[1:11:18] it has to be
[1:11:20] and when we talk about the message i
[1:11:21] know there's been a lot of over the
[1:11:23] years back and forth on that is the
[1:11:24] message the absolute is the bible the
[1:11:25] absolute well the bible
[1:11:27] if we could say it that way it's not
[1:11:29] this book that's the absolute the
[1:11:30] absolute is what god says
[1:11:33] right but what god says is written down
[1:11:35] in the bible
[1:11:36] right right this is what god says so we
[1:11:39] can say this is our absolute but the
[1:11:41] message of the hour when we understand
[1:11:43] the message to be the light on that book
[1:11:45] it's not anything different
[1:11:47] right so when we come to an absolute of
[1:11:50] balance we come to the message of the
[1:11:52] hour
[1:11:53] because there's got to be something
[1:11:54] that's balanced
[1:11:56] something's got to be right
[1:11:59] and it's not going to be the way i have
[1:12:00] church or the way somebody else does or
[1:12:02] or the way so and so down the street or
[1:12:04] or even the most famous preacher in the
[1:12:06] message you know as much as i love and
[1:12:09] appreciate all of them that's not my
[1:12:11] balance
[1:12:12] right
[1:12:13] because there may be something different
[1:12:15] that they're called to than what i'm
[1:12:16] called to but i've got to preach to you
[1:12:19] and i've got to be called to you and so
[1:12:20] there's got to be a balance what is it
[1:12:22] the message of the hour this word
[1:12:24] revealed for our day
[1:12:27] right now it's the revealed word
[1:12:29] now
[1:12:31] if there's nothing to agree on see the
[1:12:32] nominal church fights the same battles
[1:12:34] we
[1:12:34] do sure many times right now there's a
[1:12:37] great battle going on in the church in
[1:12:38] the nominal church it's the same one
[1:12:39] we're fighting
[1:12:41] among the baptists and the reformed
[1:12:43] and some of those people they're the
[1:12:45] same battles going on out there and you
[1:12:46] think how how could that be well it's
[1:12:48] because it's because the spirit is in
[1:12:51] the land
[1:12:52] the same spirits are in the land but if
[1:12:53] you watch those people if you watch it
[1:12:55] they've got nothing to come back to
[1:12:57] and so they end up dividing
[1:12:59] we ought to have something to come back
[1:13:01] to
[1:13:02] and whenever you see somebody leave and
[1:13:03] go off by themselves and it's us foreign
[1:13:05] no more
[1:13:06] they never did find a balance
[1:13:09] right and usually it's because there was
[1:13:10] nothing to balance too
[1:13:12] because they've taken the word of a man
[1:13:14] over the message of the hour
[1:13:16] we don't even take brother branham's
[1:13:17] word for it if we can say it like that
[1:13:19] it's the word of god
[1:13:22] right but brother branham happened to be
[1:13:23] the mouthpiece that god used in our day
[1:13:27] right
[1:13:28] so we're not taking the word of a man
[1:13:29] brother brandon said you're not feeding
[1:13:30] on the words of a man you're feeding on
[1:13:32] the body word of the son of man
[1:13:35] so we're not just taking a man's word
[1:13:37] for it we're we're staying with the
[1:13:38] scriptures and then when we find balance
[1:13:40] like that when something i try to do
[1:13:42] when i come and preach something is i
[1:13:43] try to run it all the way through are
[1:13:45] you still with me tonight i don't want
[1:13:47] to lose you but i try to run it all the
[1:13:49] way through the message and all the way
[1:13:50] through the scriptures
[1:13:52] and if i find something disagrees with
[1:13:53] it i put it on the shelf until i
[1:13:55] understand it because sometimes you
[1:13:57] realize well brother random had a
[1:13:58] progressive revelation and here he says
[1:14:00] it differently than he did back there
[1:14:02] and sometimes that's the case sometimes
[1:14:03] that's not sometimes he's given
[1:14:05] different views of the same thing
[1:14:08] and and other times even in the
[1:14:09] scriptures brother brown said you take
[1:14:10] the scripture and say yes
[1:14:13] and say judas hanged himself you go do
[1:14:14] the same
[1:14:16] if you take two scriptures and put them
[1:14:17] together without any context
[1:14:19] right so we've got to be careful with
[1:14:21] that but god called a prophet to come
[1:14:23] now we've got to take someone's word for
[1:14:25] it
[1:14:25] in paul's day he said if any man think
[1:14:27] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:14:30] him acknowledge that the things that i
[1:14:32] write unto you are the commandments of
[1:14:33] the lord now he writes this after the
[1:14:35] great battle they had in corinthians
[1:14:38] about women's hair
[1:14:39] and about the gifts and all those things
[1:14:41] he said let them acknowledge
[1:14:43] they're going to be people that say it
[1:14:45] don't matter if a woman cuts their hair
[1:14:46] but he said let him acknowledge what i
[1:14:47] write unto you is the commandment of the
[1:14:49] lord yes that's right
[1:14:51] right moses did the same thing in
[1:14:53] deuteronomy 4 2. he said you shall not
[1:14:54] add to the word which i command you
[1:14:56] neither shall you diminish ought from it
[1:14:59] or he said don't fence it
[1:15:02] in an effort to protect it don't do it
[1:15:04] but the jews have thousands you know
[1:15:06] there's there's only there's ten
[1:15:08] commandments and then the jews have a
[1:15:09] certain number of laws i forget how many
[1:15:11] there are but it's a finite number but
[1:15:13] the the number of explanations is
[1:15:15] infinite
[1:15:17] the number of things they've added to it
[1:15:19] is infinite
[1:15:21] they don't even know what being a good
[1:15:22] jew is it depends on which teacher you
[1:15:24] follow
[1:15:25] oh god help us not to be that way
[1:15:29] we need to stay with what god said and
[1:15:30] if it's something that
[1:15:32] that can't be clearly taught or clearly
[1:15:35] seen in the message now if you want to
[1:15:36] live by that i say go ahead because you
[1:15:39] don't want to violate your conscience
[1:15:41] if you want to live by that you don't
[1:15:42] want to do certain things there's
[1:15:43] certain things that you see in in the
[1:15:44] message and maybe i don't see it that's
[1:15:46] fine you go ahead
[1:15:48] don't don't violate your conscience but
[1:15:50] don't take away another brother's
[1:15:52] liberty either
[1:15:54] if it's something that's not clear
[1:15:56] so he said you won't don't diminish all
[1:15:58] right from it that you may keep the
[1:15:59] commandments of the lord your god which
[1:16:00] i command you but the branham said this
[1:16:03] was moses speaking to israel after he
[1:16:04] had been vindicated by god by a pillar
[1:16:06] of fire and knew he was proved to be
[1:16:08] god's servant to lead them out and
[1:16:10] before they went into the land before
[1:16:11] they entered moses said now the words
[1:16:13] that i've spoken to you he said i call
[1:16:15] heaven and earth to witness against you
[1:16:16] if you add one thing to it take one word
[1:16:19] from it you'll not stay in the land
[1:16:20] where the lord gives you
[1:16:22] he said so say i in the name of jesus
[1:16:24] christ
[1:16:25] don't you add one thing
[1:16:27] don't take put your own ideas in it you
[1:16:30] just say what it said on those tapes
[1:16:32] you just do exactly what the lord god
[1:16:34] has commanded to do
[1:16:36] don't add to it
[1:16:40] see
[1:16:41] the reason why i don't believe that the
[1:16:43] thunders are the virtues which is the
[1:16:44] thunders doctrine that we talk about
[1:16:46] they thought the thunders were the
[1:16:47] virtues
[1:16:49] and the reason why i don't believe the
[1:16:50] thunders are the virtues is because
[1:16:51] brother branham never said it
[1:16:54] right i mean just ultimately you could
[1:16:56] prove by the scripture and different
[1:16:58] things but ultimately he just never said
[1:17:00] it
[1:17:01] right so you could have a great idea and
[1:17:03] come up with a great theory but if you
[1:17:04] didn't say it i'm gonna have a hard time
[1:17:06] making doctrine out of it
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:10] and so
[1:17:11] that's the reason i don't believe that
[1:17:12] the reason i don't believe
[1:17:13] uh in uh uh press play
[1:17:17] it's because brother branham never said
[1:17:19] it
[1:17:21] now i believe you can press play that's
[1:17:23] fine if you still have a tape player or
[1:17:25] however it is that you that you listen i
[1:17:26] want you to listen to the message we
[1:17:28] ought to be digging into it today more
[1:17:30] than ever before
[1:17:32] and i'm glad that many of you do
[1:17:34] but when they say press play and obey
[1:17:36] brother branham didn't say it
[1:17:39] he never said it go look it up he never
[1:17:41] said the words press play
[1:17:44] never did that's been added to it
[1:17:46] and but we could you know we we
[1:17:48] understand that but there's many things
[1:17:49] that if we're not careful
[1:17:51] we've added things that brother branham
[1:17:53] didn't actually say
[1:17:55] and again there's some things that are
[1:17:57] revealed and you've got to be careful
[1:17:58] because you're going to say well brother
[1:18:00] branham didn't say that but there's some
[1:18:01] things that are there i'll give you a
[1:18:02] good example in the scripture it's the
[1:18:04] rapture
[1:18:05] the word rapture is not in the bible
[1:18:08] right but the caught up is in the
[1:18:10] scriptures
[1:18:11] and that could be translated rapture but
[1:18:13] if you take the king james version of
[1:18:14] the bible and say well the rapture is
[1:18:15] not in the bible i can't use the word
[1:18:16] rapture but
[1:18:18] why do we know the rapture that's a good
[1:18:19] word to use brother branham used it
[1:18:22] so when god sent a prophet on this age
[1:18:24] to open up the seals i'm just a simple
[1:18:26] man when god sent a prophet to open up
[1:18:28] the book or the lamb opened the book and
[1:18:30] sent it to the prophet and to open it up
[1:18:32] to us
[1:18:33] right then what happened when the book
[1:18:35] was open we got to see what god would
[1:18:37] call it
[1:18:40] are you hearing me
[1:18:42] and so it would be permissible
[1:18:44] for us to do that so we're not adding to
[1:18:46] by doing that
[1:18:47] we're we've got the idea of what he's
[1:18:49] saying
[1:18:50] so now
[1:18:51] he said don't put your own ideas to it
[1:18:52] he said he has ever keeps his promise to
[1:18:55] us
[1:18:56] every promise he has made he's kept it
[1:18:57] could you say amen to that tonight i
[1:18:59] believe we could rejoice over that he's
[1:19:01] always kept his word oh as i get brother
[1:19:04] harvey i'm not very old but as i get
[1:19:06] older i begin to want to point people
[1:19:08] back to the scripture and back to the
[1:19:10] word and say he keeps his promises he
[1:19:12] keeps his promises if you'll just follow
[1:19:14] the word he keeps his word
[1:19:17] don't you don't have to get off on one
[1:19:18] side or the other and get discouraged
[1:19:20] and get down and the press say well i'm
[1:19:22] the only one that believes it no he
[1:19:23] keeps his word
[1:19:26] he ever keeps his promise to us every
[1:19:29] promise that he's made he's kept it as
[1:19:31] he told you what would happen and did it
[1:19:33] happen he said i bring heavens and earth
[1:19:34] before you today in a challenge has god
[1:19:37] ever said anything that he has not
[1:19:38] fulfilled and done exactly what he said
[1:19:40] he would do for us
[1:19:42] hadn't he done it just the way he said
[1:19:44] he would do it he said that's exactly so
[1:19:46] will he continue to do it
[1:19:49] that's why we want to stay with this
[1:19:50] prophet that's why we want to stay with
[1:19:52] this message that's why we want to say
[1:19:54] with this open book
[1:19:56] because what he promised he's fulfilling
[1:19:59] he's doing what he said
[1:20:01] you hear me tonight
[1:20:03] he said don't ad just don't add to it
[1:20:05] don't take from it just believe it and
[1:20:07] walk humble before the lord your god for
[1:20:08] we're nearing the going
[1:20:10] into the land
[1:20:12] again people might say well the best way
[1:20:13] to to not add to it is just by having no
[1:20:16] preachers but that is literally adding
[1:20:17] to it
[1:20:20] right
[1:20:21] just
[1:20:22] he says do what you've been commanded to
[1:20:24] do
[1:20:25] right
[1:20:27] now
[1:20:28] i've presented people with things the
[1:20:30] prophet said and at times and the
[1:20:32] response was well i know you have quotes
[1:20:35] as if that didn't matter
[1:20:38] right and he said well i have other
[1:20:39] quotes well yeah but these matter too
[1:20:43] right it's like saying well i know you
[1:20:44] have scripture for that but i have other
[1:20:46] scriptures
[1:20:47] and that's the way the denominations
[1:20:49] handle baptism
[1:20:50] brother branham didn't handle it that
[1:20:52] way
[1:20:53] it had to both be right
[1:20:55] and and again there's a progressive
[1:20:57] revelation in the message i understand
[1:20:58] that there's some things that you don't
[1:21:00] have to try to pull 19 some things by
[1:21:02] the random taught in 1947 through 1965
[1:21:05] because he learned it as he went along
[1:21:07] because brother branham was human so i
[1:21:09] understand that but when it comes to the
[1:21:11] prophet he was always a prophet when he
[1:21:13] said it
[1:21:14] and so it's not a big deal to me if you
[1:21:16] bring me a quote from 1962 and i've got
[1:21:18] one from 1964 i'm okay with that
[1:21:21] i believe all of it
[1:21:26] that may be too simple for some people
[1:21:28] he said well but but but you're saying
[1:21:30] brother brandon didn't make any mistakes
[1:21:32] no because he said he did
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:37] but sometime we just got to quit trying
[1:21:39] to
[1:21:40] mess this thing up
[1:21:42] it's like god's given us this great gift
[1:21:44] in this age
[1:21:46] you know what a gift this message is to
[1:21:48] us
[1:21:49] it's a great gift
[1:21:50] and here we are we're going overseas and
[1:21:52] we're trying to get other people and and
[1:21:54] here's these people in egypt they don't
[1:21:55] have this gift that we have of the
[1:21:57] message of the hour in a form that we
[1:21:58] can listen to we can read it they don't
[1:22:00] have that and so they they struggle and
[1:22:03] with different things with how to dress
[1:22:04] and how to act and how to have church
[1:22:06] and all we shouldn't have to struggle
[1:22:08] with that
[1:22:09] cause we've got it
[1:22:11] right
[1:22:12] but but they struggle with that but they
[1:22:14] don't have that gift but we have no
[1:22:16] excuse
[1:22:18] we do have it
[1:22:20] but it's a gift
[1:22:21] why why do we try so hard to mess it up
[1:22:25] it's true
[1:22:27] god gave us pastors for a reason
[1:22:30] he sent us a prophet for a reason
[1:22:33] he gives us a church to go to for a
[1:22:34] reason
[1:22:36] he put us in a position we're in in the
[1:22:38] place we're in i've watched god
[1:22:40] supernaturally work in this church over
[1:22:42] the last couple of years i don't have
[1:22:44] much confidence in my own ability as a
[1:22:46] minister as a pastor but i do have
[1:22:48] confidence in what god has done here
[1:22:50] over the last two years and i say thank
[1:22:52] god for that he said brother ben i don't
[1:22:54] see a lot of the fruits of it i do i see
[1:22:56] the lives of people and i see how we're
[1:22:58] progressing and maturing and i see
[1:23:00] people coming and being a part and and
[1:23:02] sometimes you work for years
[1:23:04] we don't want to do things overnight
[1:23:06] a church that comes overnight comes easy
[1:23:08] will leave overnight
[1:23:10] but we want to see people built up in
[1:23:12] the faith and then if they move on
[1:23:13] somewhere else god bless them let's
[1:23:15] build someone else up
[1:23:17] let's build our children up let's build
[1:23:18] our young people up let's get them into
[1:23:20] the message of the hour what did the
[1:23:22] prophet say
[1:23:24] what what does the bible say
[1:23:26] and even when they're very young we try
[1:23:28] to teach them the scriptures
[1:23:30] because what did the scripture say about
[1:23:32] it you can find out when you have a
[1:23:34] question to go back to the word
[1:23:36] and then when you come old enough you
[1:23:38] understand the message you can go and
[1:23:39] run the message right through the
[1:23:41] scripture and it'll all add up
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:44] now
[1:23:45] but it's like well you have quotes it's
[1:23:47] like that's not a big deal
[1:23:50] and
[1:23:51] we we should respect all of it
[1:23:54] not just the parts that are
[1:23:56] whoever we listen to or even myself
[1:23:58] if i'm the your favorite preacher praise
[1:24:00] god
[1:24:02] i'm probably not any of your favorite
[1:24:04] preacher but if i am
[1:24:06] if i am then then don't don't just
[1:24:09] listen to what i say because i said it
[1:24:11] and take it for gospel
[1:24:13] line it up with the word
[1:24:17] and
[1:24:19] so but each pastor has the right to
[1:24:20] preach what his church will listen to
[1:24:23] and it's on you right
[1:24:27] it's on you to come back to me and tell
[1:24:29] me if i did it if i preached it wrong i
[1:24:31] understand i'll make mistakes and say
[1:24:33] things you don't have to come and tell
[1:24:34] me every every little thing like i do
[1:24:36] for brother joel i'll take care of that
[1:24:38] but
[1:24:40] but uh but but but as far as it's the
[1:24:42] the doctrine and things that we teach if
[1:24:44] it's wrong come and tell me maybe we can
[1:24:46] come to an understanding of it you you
[1:24:49] got a responsibility for what you listen
[1:24:51] to
[1:24:52] it's too late of an hour to be listening
[1:24:53] just anything
[1:24:56] and
[1:24:57] so but we every church is sovereign in
[1:24:59] that way
[1:25:00] all of us
[1:25:01] the messenger
[1:25:03] to the age came brought the word the
[1:25:05] word is here christ the word present in
[1:25:07] our day right the messenger is gone the
[1:25:09] word is here every other minister stands
[1:25:11] under that word
[1:25:14] uh even brother joel i'm his pastor but
[1:25:16] he stands under that word
[1:25:18] i can't tell him what to preach
[1:25:20] i can give him hints but
[1:25:24] i can teach him i can't tell him what to
[1:25:25] preach i can't tell by the alan what to
[1:25:26] preach
[1:25:28] right because they stand under that
[1:25:29] message
[1:25:30] under that messenger every church
[1:25:32] especially every every local church and
[1:25:35] every pastor has his own uh his own
[1:25:38] ability to get into the word and to find
[1:25:40] out what a prophet said romans 14 and 4
[1:25:42] says who art thou that judges to another
[1:25:43] man's servant do his own mastery
[1:25:45] standeth their falleth yeah he shall be
[1:25:47] holding up for god is able to make him
[1:25:49] stand
[1:25:51] now
[1:25:52] again like i said we could go in several
[1:25:54] different directions tonight but i just
[1:25:55] want to show you an an example if i
[1:25:58] could just for a few minutes then we'll
[1:25:59] go
[1:26:00] and and
[1:26:01] we'll you just be patient with me just
[1:26:03] for a minute i gave myself five more
[1:26:04] minutes on my clock i gave myself 50
[1:26:06] minutes instead of 45 tonight and then i
[1:26:09] forgot to turn it on so
[1:26:11] but we'll be okay
[1:26:13] now
[1:26:14] i'll stop when it's time to stop now
[1:26:18] even in the early church now think about
[1:26:20] it not all the early church was in the
[1:26:22] same place spiritually
[1:26:24] not all the early churches
[1:26:27] were in the same place
[1:26:29] there was a church in corinth that was
[1:26:30] so different from the church in
[1:26:31] ephesians but they were
[1:26:33] god's church
[1:26:35] you don't want to forget that when you
[1:26:36] read corinthians because sometimes the
[1:26:37] way paul talks to them
[1:26:39] you might forget that they were even
[1:26:40] christians
[1:26:42] but they were god's church
[1:26:45] he said to the to the sanctified to the
[1:26:47] called out to the elect the galatians
[1:26:50] were in a certain place the ephesians
[1:26:52] were in a certain place the corinthians
[1:26:54] were in a certain place all of them
[1:26:55] dealing with different things and paul
[1:26:57] writes very different letters to
[1:26:59] different churches
[1:27:01] and yet it all ties together
[1:27:04] and so
[1:27:05] every church is affected by its history
[1:27:07] its culture its location its pastors and
[1:27:12] brother brown said even its name
[1:27:14] i think i read that quote to you sunday
[1:27:16] he talked about how a church even is
[1:27:18] affected by the name it has
[1:27:20] and so there's a lot of little things
[1:27:22] that go into bringing and making a
[1:27:24] church what it is we are very different
[1:27:27] even churches in the same area can't be
[1:27:30] lumped together and i get a little
[1:27:31] aggravated when people do
[1:27:33] because obviously i think we're the best
[1:27:37] but then other pastors might get
[1:27:38] aggravated too and they lump us with
[1:27:40] them
[1:27:41] because we ought to feel that way
[1:27:43] and so we're very different and let me
[1:27:45] say something that might shock you god
[1:27:47] wants it that way
[1:27:50] he don't want cookie-cutter
[1:27:51] denominational churches
[1:27:53] and denominational congregations
[1:27:56] where everybody does it the way
[1:27:57] headquarters says to do it that's what
[1:27:59] not what god wants
[1:28:01] he's a god of variety
[1:28:03] and and you might say well why don't we
[1:28:05] just do it the way this other church
[1:28:07] does it's successful for them it might
[1:28:09] not be successful for us
[1:28:11] and we're not responsible for them what
[1:28:14] if they're wrong our standard again the
[1:28:16] balance point is the word
[1:28:19] and yet we should not use our
[1:28:21] differences even if we feel someone else
[1:28:22] is out of balance to destroy one another
[1:28:26] and and again the pharisees they use
[1:28:28] their traditions for that purpose it's
[1:28:30] okay to have tradition
[1:28:32] the pharisees problem was they elevated
[1:28:33] their tradition to word status
[1:28:36] let's go to matthew 23 and look at it
[1:28:37] for just a moment
[1:28:39] and i'll have to quit for him through
[1:28:41] matthew 23 then spake jesus to the
[1:28:43] multitude and to his disciples
[1:28:45] saying the scribes and the pharisees sit
[1:28:47] in moses seed
[1:28:49] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[1:28:51] observe
[1:28:52] that observe and do
[1:28:54] in other words they're in a seat of
[1:28:55] authority
[1:28:56] they understand the law
[1:28:59] but do not ye after their works
[1:29:02] what an indictment
[1:29:04] for they say and do not again this is
[1:29:06] where
[1:29:07] trying to build fences extra fences
[1:29:10] around what we know and what has been
[1:29:12] revealed
[1:29:14] gets you in trouble and brings you into
[1:29:15] a trap
[1:29:17] because you can't live it
[1:29:20] because the holy spirit won't help you
[1:29:22] and i preached to you about that before
[1:29:23] the holy spirit will not help you in
[1:29:25] your legalism
[1:29:27] and you'll find yourself defeated and
[1:29:29] down and depressed
[1:29:32] because the holy spirit's not going to
[1:29:33] help you live that
[1:29:34] he only helps you live the word
[1:29:38] now so he said don't don't do after
[1:29:40] their works for they say and do not
[1:29:43] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[1:29:44] to be born and lay them on men's
[1:29:46] shoulders but they themselves will not
[1:29:48] move them with one of their fingers
[1:29:51] heavy burdens
[1:29:53] and so the problem with legalism again
[1:29:56] one of the problems with it is that it
[1:29:57] forces you to make allowances for your
[1:29:59] own particular brand of sin
[1:30:05] that may sound kind of harsh but it's
[1:30:07] you know we we all make mistakes
[1:30:11] and so it forces you to make allowances
[1:30:12] for your own
[1:30:14] but no allowance for anyone else
[1:30:17] and jesus gives us several examples of
[1:30:19] that we'll take one he said well until
[1:30:20] you blind guides which say whosoever
[1:30:22] shall swear by the temple and it's
[1:30:24] nothing but whosoever shall swear but
[1:30:26] the gold of the temple he's a deader
[1:30:28] because they wanted something to make an
[1:30:29] oath by
[1:30:30] so they said well the temple is nothing
[1:30:33] but boy if they swear by the gold we'll
[1:30:35] put them out of the church
[1:30:37] and and jesus said you fools and blind
[1:30:40] whether it's greater the gold or the
[1:30:42] temple that sanctifieth the gold
[1:30:45] you're not even thinking it doesn't make
[1:30:47] sense
[1:30:48] and they made allowances for themselves
[1:30:50] they were pros at this i i've heard that
[1:30:53] they would actually on the sabbath they
[1:30:55] couldn't walk only a certain distance
[1:30:56] from their home on the sabbath so what
[1:30:58] they would do is they would take
[1:30:59] articles of clothing they would have a
[1:31:01] servant who wasn't a jew
[1:31:03] go out and and run ahead of them and
[1:31:05] drop an article of clothing or something
[1:31:06] that belonged to them so every so far
[1:31:09] however far they could go on the sabbath
[1:31:11] because they consider that their home
[1:31:14] the teacher interpreted that to be their
[1:31:16] home so then they could feel
[1:31:18] righteous and go as far as they wanted
[1:31:20] to on the sabbath
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:23] legalism is a strange bird
[1:31:27] and it make you one
[1:31:29] me one
[1:31:32] and matthew 15 1 he deals with one of
[1:31:34] these traditions then came to jesus
[1:31:36] scribes and pharisees which of jerusalem
[1:31:38] saying why did thy disciples transgress
[1:31:40] the tradition of the elders for they
[1:31:42] wash not their hands when they eat bread
[1:31:44] and these guys were like the mask people
[1:31:46] today you know people and i know if you
[1:31:48] want to wear a mask that's that's fine
[1:31:49] but some people go
[1:31:51] we were in walmart one day and after the
[1:31:52] mask man they'd been lifted and this
[1:31:54] woman man she was determined we would
[1:31:55] wear one if we were going to be around
[1:31:57] her we were like well we don't have to
[1:31:59] be around you you can move on
[1:32:02] but she was just determined and i if i
[1:32:05] remember correctly we put one on because
[1:32:06] we weren't going to make a fuss but
[1:32:08] but you know
[1:32:10] it was they were like that with this
[1:32:11] they're like we wash our hands why don't
[1:32:14] your disciples wash their hands well the
[1:32:15] truth is it would have been a good thing
[1:32:18] for the disciples to wash their hands
[1:32:22] don't you think so
[1:32:23] you imagine the dirt and the grime the
[1:32:25] disciples walking through the cornfield
[1:32:27] just picking corn and eating it
[1:32:29] and we've been in that kind of a country
[1:32:31] where they walk where they with the
[1:32:32] animal uh dung and stuff on the roads
[1:32:34] and you it's just nasty some of our
[1:32:37] clothes went in the trash
[1:32:39] because it's just nasty constantly and
[1:32:42] washing feet would have been a whole
[1:32:43] nother experience
[1:32:46] and and so
[1:32:47] but that's the kind of country they
[1:32:48] lived in so it had been a good thing
[1:32:51] it wasn't a bad thing to wash your hands
[1:32:53] but they elevated it to doctrine
[1:32:57] and when they elevate it to doctrine you
[1:32:59] know how you know when someone elevates
[1:33:00] something to doctrine they say if you
[1:33:02] don't do it you'll end up in hell
[1:33:05] and they've elevated it to doctrine they
[1:33:07] said it's weighty it matters
[1:33:10] and jesus said you didn't have to leave
[1:33:11] the other undone
[1:33:13] but you should have
[1:33:14] focused on the weightier matters of the
[1:33:16] law
[1:33:18] he said
[1:33:19] he said the tradition of the elders they
[1:33:21] washed off their hands when they read
[1:33:22] but he answered and said unto them why
[1:33:24] do you also transgress the commandment
[1:33:25] of god by your tradition and he gives
[1:33:28] the example of honoring parents which
[1:33:29] i've given to you before how that they
[1:33:31] would
[1:33:32] give a gift to their parents they
[1:33:33] basically give them a bribe
[1:33:35] say now i've honored my parents i don't
[1:33:36] ever have to see you again
[1:33:38] i think some kids are like that today
[1:33:42] that's basically what they did stuck
[1:33:43] them in a nursing home paid for the
[1:33:44] nursing home and said okay it's yours
[1:33:47] it's gone
[1:33:48] and again sometimes i realize that has
[1:33:50] to happen but but it's just uh just as
[1:33:52] an example they've tried to pay them off
[1:33:54] that's not honoring our parents
[1:33:57] and he used that example and then he
[1:33:58] said you hypocrites
[1:34:00] well did isaiah prophesy of you saying
[1:34:03] this people draw nine to me with their
[1:34:04] mouth and honor me with their lips but
[1:34:06] their heart is far from me
[1:34:08] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:34:11] for doctrines
[1:34:12] the commandments of men
[1:34:14] washing hands
[1:34:16] it's a good thing
[1:34:18] but you don't teach it for doctrine
[1:34:21] are you with me
[1:34:23] god bless all you that wash your hands
[1:34:25] praise god
[1:34:27] don't just don't make a doctrine out of
[1:34:28] it
[1:34:30] they made their personal preferences
[1:34:32] doctrine and doctrine isn't something
[1:34:34] you play with like that
[1:34:36] because it's life
[1:34:38] you understand the word is life to us
[1:34:40] some of you know that
[1:34:41] the word is life
[1:34:44] we must have the balance in the word
[1:34:47] that brings life
[1:34:48] so we find things again and i'll just
[1:34:51] use this one example you know our
[1:34:53] services cause controversy because of
[1:34:55] how we have church and how emotional one
[1:34:58] church is and one is not and i've been
[1:35:00] working i think i could i could get by
[1:35:03] for the next year or maybe the next 10
[1:35:05] years without preaching against
[1:35:06] emotionalism because y'all aren't
[1:35:08] greatly emotional but we've come a long
[1:35:10] ways and and maybe there'll be a time i
[1:35:12] have to come out and settle things down
[1:35:14] that day has not arrived yet
[1:35:17] but there may come a time when i'd have
[1:35:19] to do that why because we believe in all
[1:35:20] of it
[1:35:22] right but but you got to be careful with
[1:35:24] that because if we're not careful all we
[1:35:26] do is just take quotes at each other
[1:35:28] and fight one another with it
[1:35:31] when brother branham said both things
[1:35:35] you know i think most of us could agree
[1:35:36] that preaching should always take
[1:35:37] precedence in a service somebody could
[1:35:39] say amen to that
[1:35:41] we love music
[1:35:43] but the preaching should take precedence
[1:35:45] in that
[1:35:46] some some will tell you only old songs
[1:35:48] bring the presence of the lord some will
[1:35:49] say only new some say only fast song
[1:35:52] some say only slow i know there's some
[1:35:54] of you and i won't look at you but
[1:35:57] some of you folks would love it if we
[1:35:59] sang old hymns every song that we've
[1:36:02] sang and i would be right there with you
[1:36:06] just being honest with you
[1:36:08] i love it
[1:36:09] i also like some new songs
[1:36:12] but some of you would love only to have
[1:36:14] old songs and others of you would love
[1:36:15] to have only new songs i won't look at
[1:36:17] you either
[1:36:21] you know who you are i'll look at you
[1:36:24] out on the stream tonight
[1:36:27] but
[1:36:28] you know why can't we have both
[1:36:31] again and judge the song on its own
[1:36:33] merits if it's rock and roll it doesn't
[1:36:35] belong in the church
[1:36:37] right that's simple enough
[1:36:39] and uh you know but i'm not going to
[1:36:41] throw out the baby with the bathwater
[1:36:43] elvis sang amazing grapes
[1:36:46] i'm not going to quit singing it because
[1:36:48] of that it's just silly
[1:36:52] and but brother branham you know you
[1:36:53] find your quotes and here's a quote it's
[1:36:55] going to sting a little bit
[1:36:56] brother brown said but today we say
[1:36:58] everybody have a big time everybody clap
[1:37:00] their hands
[1:37:01] we like to do that don't we everybody
[1:37:03] holler hallelujah everybody do this he
[1:37:05] said oh how we got a bunch of fuss
[1:37:07] he said we get these new songs out and
[1:37:09] seeing them so fast it looks like we're
[1:37:10] going to run through the wall with them
[1:37:11] or something like that
[1:37:14] he said when i think if we'd be singing
[1:37:15] nearer my god to thee would be a whole
[1:37:17] lot better for the church
[1:37:19] the old-fashioned hymns boy some of you
[1:37:21] feel good right now you know
[1:37:24] brother ben's on my side
[1:37:32] oh that's a quote that brother brother
[1:37:34] said that amen
[1:37:37] the same prophet
[1:37:39] said oh my he said don't you feel good
[1:37:41] think friends this is pentecost
[1:37:44] worship
[1:37:45] this is pentecost let's clap our hands
[1:37:49] and sing it
[1:37:50] pentecostal people everybody he said now
[1:37:53] loosen up get that old methodist
[1:37:54] formality out of you now
[1:38:02] same prophet preached in the same church
[1:38:05] both sermons preached in the tabernacle
[1:38:09] and
[1:38:10] so now again
[1:38:12] he says
[1:38:13] it kind of gets on both here he says he
[1:38:15] says now may god bless this little group
[1:38:16] here that gathers and just keep having
[1:38:18] these breakfasts and above everything
[1:38:20] else keep it spiritual he said never let
[1:38:22] that spirit die
[1:38:24] sing those old-fashioned songs
[1:38:27] and clap your
[1:38:28] hands praise the lord he said that's the
[1:38:31] way you got to keep he said i'm a
[1:38:32] southerner it's the same quote
[1:38:35] i'm emotional he said i can prove to you
[1:38:37] anything without emotion is dead
[1:38:40] he said and if your religion hasn't got
[1:38:42] a little emotion in it you better bury
[1:38:43] it and get one that has
[1:38:45] it's dead he said so we got to have
[1:38:47] emotions jesus said if they hold their
[1:38:49] peace the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:38:52] sure
[1:38:53] he said well how could a prophet say
[1:38:56] both of those things well we're going to
[1:38:58] take a little bit farther
[1:39:00] you see sometimes it's not appropriate
[1:39:02] to sing nearer my god to thee do you
[1:39:04] know that that's a good song but there's
[1:39:07] times that's not appropriate brother
[1:39:08] brown talked about paul rayder he said
[1:39:10] he was dying and the moody bible school
[1:39:11] sent down a quartet he said they were
[1:39:13] standing there with the shades all down
[1:39:14] in the hospital singing near my god to
[1:39:16] thee and paul raised up and said hey
[1:39:18] who's dying me or you
[1:39:24] he said raise them shades and sing me
[1:39:25] some good snappy gospel songs
[1:39:29] there's a time and a place for both
[1:39:31] aren't you glad god sent a prophet
[1:39:36] and
[1:39:37] again brother brown said there is also
[1:39:39] just people who live upon the emotion
[1:39:41] some people say well we got a lot of
[1:39:42] that in our pentecostal movement he said
[1:39:44] and they will go in which is fine
[1:39:45] they'll pat their hands and play the
[1:39:47] music but random claps his hands
[1:39:49] music stops shoo a bucket of water went
[1:39:52] over everything
[1:39:54] he said now we do that he said we got in
[1:39:55] the habit of doing that he said it's
[1:39:57] just become one of our customs let me
[1:39:59] tell you something when you're
[1:40:00] worshiping god in the spirit and in
[1:40:02] truth when it becomes a custom for you
[1:40:04] to do it because you think you ought to
[1:40:05] do it because you think if you don't
[1:40:07] shout or jump up and down or dance with
[1:40:09] the music your neighbor is going to
[1:40:10] think you're backslid you're drinking
[1:40:11] from a stagnated stream
[1:40:16] and even preachers will get into that at
[1:40:17] times you know we all get in each
[1:40:19] other's spirits you know and and do the
[1:40:21] same things but we ought to do it
[1:40:22] because of the love of god in our hearts
[1:40:24] not because we think somebody's going to
[1:40:25] look down on us because we didn't shout
[1:40:27] that service maybe you didn't feel like
[1:40:29] shouting maybe you felt like crying but
[1:40:31] there's some response that you add to
[1:40:33] the word of god that's what we want to
[1:40:34] see it's a response
[1:40:36] when i talk about a church being alive
[1:40:38] i'm not talking about about having a
[1:40:40] great big band and strobe lights and
[1:40:41] people jumping up and down i'm talking
[1:40:43] about response and life
[1:40:45] and movement
[1:40:47] so when the word is preached there's a
[1:40:49] there's a reality to it it's not just
[1:40:51] some dead cold formal thing right
[1:40:55] now
[1:40:56] and so he said your neighbor is going to
[1:40:58] take your backseat he said until until
[1:40:59] it fills every fiber until the holy
[1:41:02] spirit itself bubbling in you
[1:41:05] he said i don't care whether the music
[1:41:07] is playing
[1:41:08] whether they're playing
[1:41:10] near my god to thee
[1:41:12] or whatever it is
[1:41:15] the holy spirit is still ringing the
[1:41:16] glory bells in your heart
[1:41:18] that
[1:41:19] satisfies
[1:41:21] that's god's satisfying portion anything
[1:41:24] less than that
[1:41:26] you're done
[1:41:27] we want the real thing don't we yes
[1:41:30] why can't we have one service that's
[1:41:31] solemn with an altar call another where
[1:41:33] people are rejoicing another when the
[1:41:34] gifts are operating another where we are
[1:41:36] encouraged
[1:41:40] and brother branham brings it all kind
[1:41:41] of together and god hiding himself in
[1:41:43] simplicity he said he said there's one
[1:41:45] side that's highly intellectual cold and
[1:41:47] indifferent they deny everything there
[1:41:49] the others get on the other side on the
[1:41:51] other side with a radical bunch of an
[1:41:52] emotion and deny the word
[1:41:55] the key is not the emotion but denying
[1:41:56] the word both of them deny the word
[1:41:59] right one denies everything one denies
[1:42:01] takes the emotion but denies the word
[1:42:03] but the real true church stays right in
[1:42:04] the middle of the road
[1:42:06] he said now if you notice it's got the
[1:42:07] bible knowledge of what god said and
[1:42:09] it's spiritual enough to be warm in its
[1:42:11] heart
[1:42:12] and it's just the road oh isn't that the
[1:42:14] road you want to be on tonight
[1:42:16] amen
[1:42:17] even if you're singing near my god to
[1:42:19] thee i don't even know if we know how to
[1:42:20] play it
[1:42:21] but if if you're singing near my god to
[1:42:23] thee it's a great old hymn but even if
[1:42:25] you're seeing that there ought to be joy
[1:42:26] bells in your heart
[1:42:28] but again like i said there's sometimes
[1:42:30] it's not appropriate sometimes we need
[1:42:31] to clap our hands sometimes we need to
[1:42:33] get up when you're feeling down brandon
[1:42:35] said you'll begin to patch your foot
[1:42:36] with the music and we've read all those
[1:42:38] quotes before
[1:42:39] and then david said praise the lord with
[1:42:40] the symbols praise him with the dance
[1:42:42] and that's biblical stuff yeah sure but
[1:42:45] there's times you don't need that
[1:42:46] there's times you need to sit there and
[1:42:47] cry
[1:42:50] and there's some people who don't do
[1:42:52] much of any of that
[1:42:53] one of these days i'm going to see by
[1:42:55] the levi nod
[1:42:57] i'm going to run all over this church
[1:43:01] but i've been preaching levi since he
[1:43:02] was six years old so i i understand some
[1:43:05] people just don't move much
[1:43:07] but let there be a response in your
[1:43:09] heart
[1:43:11] let it come where you where you know
[1:43:12] it's been preached and the best response
[1:43:15] is to live it right
[1:43:16] that's the best response
[1:43:19] lord help us to be spiritual enough to
[1:43:21] respond to the word
[1:43:22] and again what should be our litmus test
[1:43:24] well can we say amen to all of it
[1:43:27] or do we just dis-fellowship people who
[1:43:29] disagree with us or do it a little bit
[1:43:31] differently maybe god called their
[1:43:33] church to be runners of the isles
[1:43:36] runners on the backs of the pew some of
[1:43:38] you if you run on the back of your break
[1:43:39] a hip
[1:43:44] i would too
[1:43:46] maybe god hasn't called us to that but
[1:43:47] we can be warm in our heart
[1:43:50] let's be that
[1:43:52] let's be that with all that we have and
[1:43:54] when god when a revival spirit does come
[1:43:56] through let's not stifle it let's give
[1:43:58] it the freedom to operate it let god be
[1:44:00] able to do what god does
[1:44:07] can you say amen to all of it or do you
[1:44:08] try to explain it away based on your
[1:44:10] prejudice
[1:44:12] all right
[1:44:13] i want you to look at brother branham
[1:44:14] sermon titles as we close this is the
[1:44:16] odd sermon i know
[1:44:18] i want you to look at brother branham
[1:44:19] sermon titles i've already taken too
[1:44:21] much time
[1:44:22] this is between the seals into the seals
[1:44:25] and crisis of mystery now this had been
[1:44:26] me brother danny i would have preached
[1:44:28] the seventh steel part 1 through 100
[1:44:31] during this time i'm honest with you
[1:44:33] brother branham didn't do that
[1:44:36] because you know generally when you're a
[1:44:37] preacher you get that good one with alan
[1:44:39] you want to keep keep going with it
[1:44:41] right so you just keep explaining it
[1:44:43] keep explaining keep explaining brother
[1:44:44] doesn't do that he goes on the field for
[1:44:46] a while he preaches the world is falling
[1:44:48] apart god hiding himself in simplicity
[1:44:50] victory day look
[1:44:52] come follow me aren't those great titles
[1:44:54] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:44:56] and forever he preaches that twice
[1:44:58] preaches a greater than solomon is here
[1:44:59] twice
[1:45:01] show us the father be not afraid
[1:45:03] conferences
[1:45:04] standing in the gap that's the first
[1:45:06] sermon he preaches when he gets back to
[1:45:07] jeffersonville
[1:45:09] the flashing red light of the sign of
[1:45:10] his coming completely different it seems
[1:45:13] like from the seals but it's all the
[1:45:14] opening of the word
[1:45:16] why
[1:45:17] there's a sermon you go back and listen
[1:45:19] to
[1:45:20] why
[1:45:21] oh lord just once more
[1:45:23] the third exodus
[1:45:25] see they drop that that magnificent
[1:45:27] sermon just full of the of the deep
[1:45:29] things of the word of god and then
[1:45:31] preaches is your life worthy of the
[1:45:32] gospel
[1:45:34] the indictment
[1:45:36] communion
[1:45:37] why christ speak
[1:45:39] humble thyself a prisoner he cares do
[1:45:41] you care
[1:45:42] god doesn't call a man to judgment
[1:45:44] without first warning him and wraps it
[1:45:45] up with christ as the mystery of god
[1:45:47] revealed
[1:45:48] now think about that just for a minute i
[1:45:50] don't say we all have to do it like that
[1:45:52] i can't i'm not creative enough to title
[1:45:54] my sermons like brother branham did plus
[1:45:56] he already used all those titles but
[1:45:59] that's balance
[1:46:02] let's quit trying to hatch out preachers
[1:46:03] and churches in our own image
[1:46:06] let's see what god will do
[1:46:09] see god is not a god of one thought
[1:46:12] turn to psalm chapter 40. we'll close
[1:46:15] god is not a god of one thought
[1:46:18] he said many o lord my god are thy
[1:46:20] wonderful works which thou hast done
[1:46:24] and thy thoughts plural which are to us
[1:46:26] word
[1:46:27] they cannot be reckoned up in order unto
[1:46:30] thee
[1:46:31] if i would declare and speak of them
[1:46:33] they are more than can be numbered
[1:46:36] he said sacrifice an offering thou does
[1:46:38] not desire so god said i want to give
[1:46:41] you my thoughts realize that's what it
[1:46:43] was in our day
[1:46:45] god thought it he had some thoughts he
[1:46:48] wanted to express
[1:46:50] how could he do that a prophet had to
[1:46:52] come in our day
[1:46:53] and bring us the thoughts of god
[1:46:56] are you with me the commentary that god
[1:46:57] had when he spoke the word this is the
[1:46:59] word of god but he wanted us to know his
[1:47:01] thoughts
[1:47:02] and we are his thoughts
[1:47:05] right
[1:47:06] but now he says you didn't want burnt
[1:47:08] offerings but he said mine ears has to
[1:47:10] have opened
[1:47:12] psalm 47 then said i lo i come
[1:47:15] now speaking of christ said in the
[1:47:17] volume of the book
[1:47:19] the volume the whole thing
[1:47:21] it is written to me i've got lots of
[1:47:23] thoughts god says aren't you glad he
[1:47:25] does
[1:47:26] lots of different thoughts
[1:47:28] lots of things but they all tie together
[1:47:31] i got lots of different people lots of
[1:47:33] different preachers lots of different
[1:47:35] churches but they all tie together
[1:47:38] lots of thoughts
[1:47:39] but in the volume of the book it is
[1:47:41] written to me this bride's the story of
[1:47:43] this bride is not just written in hardy
[1:47:46] it's written in egypt it's written in
[1:47:48] africa it's written in tennessee it's
[1:47:50] written in in missouri it's written all
[1:47:52] over the place
[1:47:55] it's god's thoughts many kinds of
[1:47:57] thoughts
[1:48:01] and i think we should come down to verse
[1:48:03] 8 i delight to do thy will oh my god
[1:48:05] whatever thoughts you want me to express
[1:48:07] to hear and to express let me hear that
[1:48:10] yea thy law is within
[1:48:12] my heart musicians go ahead and come
[1:48:20] i could preach that a hundred times make
[1:48:22] 100 parts out of it but we'll leave it
[1:48:24] rest there
[1:48:25] for now
[1:48:28] i've told you the story before but
[1:48:30] i read where the devil was walking along
[1:48:32] with one of his courts okay joel i
[1:48:33] didn't go too long
[1:48:36] devil was walking along with one of his
[1:48:37] cohorts i caught him looking at his
[1:48:38] watch
[1:48:41] he saw a man ahead of him pick up
[1:48:42] something shiny

[1:49:51] what was on my heart and

[1:49:55] humanity that crept in i know it's
[1:49:57] possible
[1:49:58] i know it happens sometimes and i pray
[1:50:01] you'd help them to spit aside any seeds
[1:50:03] and just take what's true
[1:50:05] or may we all learn to do that
[1:50:08] not to discount the vessel because of
[1:50:10] the mistakes
[1:50:12] the lord to recognize that you use
[1:50:14] messengers to bring your word

[1:50:31] your word to have it
[1:50:33] i pray god that you'd move in a mighty
[1:50:35] way in this church
[1:50:36] lord that we would never stifle the move
[1:50:38] of the spirit
[1:50:40] but that we would not be
[1:50:41] lord addicted to the candy of of running
[1:50:44] and shouting but lord that when it comes
[1:50:47] lord it would be natural it would be
[1:50:49] something that just flows oh god may it
[1:50:51] be so
[1:50:53] but lord and sometimes maybe in the
[1:50:55] quietness of the moment in the teaching

[1:50:59] that too lord in the valleys help us to
