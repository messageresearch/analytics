[42:06] and you're a well and you're living
[42:08] among us fathers
[42:09] we love you now and appreciate you and
[42:11] you
[42:13] [Music]
[42:14] and Jesus
[42:16] amen let's turn the Bibles to Exodus 23
[42:19] if you would I just like to say it's
[42:21] quite an honor to be here with you this
[42:24] morning and and uh
[42:26] we appreciate all the prayers that you
[42:30] have prayed for us through the loss of
[42:32] my mom in situations that we've been
[42:34] through been a difficult time but the
[42:37] Lord's been good to us and we're
[42:39] thankful for that and he's been there
[42:41] for us and you know and we're also going
[42:43] through a lot of other changes in life
[42:45] um yeah we're getting a lot older and
[42:48] that's not fun because you get older
[42:51] you're not only are you getting older
[42:52] your kids are getting older and so now
[42:54] I'm in just a little over a year my
[42:56] third and one is getting married and
[42:58] it's next weekend and a lot of changes
[43:00] happening so I'm getting ready to be a
[43:02] grandpa that's what I'm that's what I'm
[43:04] I heard that's a pretty good deal and so
[43:07] that's what I'm looking for the next
[43:09] steps and so I told him that's the only
[43:11] reason why I was letting them get
[43:13] married so I can have grandchildren so
[43:14] amen but uh you know it's real real
[43:17] privilege to be here it's a special
[43:19] place to me here at this uh church
[43:22] because it's back years ago when I first
[43:24] started ministering the Brother John
[43:26] lafonte
[43:27] and brother Mike also would let me come
[43:29] up here and Minister as a young man and
[43:31] Minister and uh always a real good
[43:34] atmosphere and easy place to preach and
[43:36] I'm looking forward to that again this
[43:39] morning
[43:40] amen so uh amen God bless you today
[43:43] bring you greetings from our church and
[43:45] my my pastor and father brother Tim said
[43:48] to be sure and tell everyone hello for
[43:51] him and it's in his greetings and it's
[43:54] just good to be in the house of the Lord
[43:55] amen it's always good I was glad when
[43:58] they said unto me do you have that
[44:00] gladness in your heart today to be in
[44:02] his presence Exodus chapter 23 and verse
[44:05] 20 also John 16 and verse 7. could turn
[44:09] there but this scripture is hard to read
[44:11] without just becoming emotional about it
[44:14] because
[44:15] this is to know where we're at and what
[44:19] time we're in and to know that there's a
[44:22] first Exodus the second Exodus and now
[44:24] we're in the Third Exodus and and just
[44:26] know these words also pertain to us
[44:29] and he says here in verse 20 he said
[44:31] behold I sent an angel before thee to
[44:35] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[44:38] and to the place which I have prepared
[44:41] Amen to keep thee to bring thee to a
[44:44] place that I have prepared John chapter
[44:46] 16 and verse 7 says nevertheless I tell
[44:50] you the truth it is expedient for you
[44:52] that I go away for if I go not away the
[44:55] comforter will not come unto you but if
[44:58] I depart I will send him unto you and
[45:01] when he has come he will reprove the
[45:03] world of sin and of righteousness and of
[45:05] Judgment of sin because they believe not
[45:07] on me of righteousness because I go to
[45:09] my father and you see me no more of
[45:12] judgment because the prince of this
[45:14] world is judged I have yet many things
[45:17] to say unto you but you cannot bear them
[45:19] now how be it when he the spirit of
[45:22] Truth has come
[45:23] he will guide you into all Truth for he
[45:27] shall not speak of himself but
[45:28] whatsoever he shall hear that he shall
[45:31] speak and he will show you things to
[45:33] come and he shall glorify me for he
[45:35] shall receive a mind and shall show it
[45:38] unto you amen God bless you can be
[45:41] seated
[45:50] I like to I've been on this thought for
[45:52] some time at home on the light
[45:55] uh because I look at the darkness that
[45:59] we're in and we're in a great time of
[46:01] Darkness but we're also in a great time
[46:03] of light and a lot of times it's a lot
[46:07] easier to see the darkness that's around
[46:08] you and the things that's going on
[46:10] around you in the situations and
[46:12] sometimes it begins to begin to look
[46:15] hopeless and and you look helpless but
[46:17] they may have to remember we're not
[46:19] alone That We're Not Alone by ourselves
[46:21] but there is someone that is with us and
[46:24] this morning I'd like to speak to you
[46:25] about that someone on the light the
[46:28] guide because I believe he is a God and
[46:31] he promised that he would never leave us
[46:32] or he would never forsake us but he
[46:34] would be with us even in us until the
[46:37] end of the world and that's a promise
[46:39] that I can depend on and you can depend
[46:41] on and it's a wonderful thing to realize
[46:43] amen that no matter what you're going
[46:45] through the situations in your life
[46:46] you're not alone amen it's one thing to
[46:49] have a father it's one thing to have a
[46:50] mother but this was not your father
[46:52] telling you this it was not your mother
[46:54] telling you this was this was not some
[46:57] great friend of their of yours telling
[46:58] you this this was Jesus Christ himself
[47:01] saying I will never leave you alone but
[47:04] I'll be with you even in you and and you
[47:06] know he's there not to just be us
[47:08] bystander or or just a spectator but he
[47:11] is there walking among the candlesticks
[47:13] he is involved he is he is moving he is
[47:16] touching he's orchestrating you know
[47:18] many times we think that that it's all
[47:20] out of catering it's all out of control
[47:22] but there's nothing in this world that's
[47:24] out of his control it doesn't matter
[47:27] who's in power whether to be Democrat
[47:29] Republican or this that and the other
[47:30] dictators it doesn't matter they're all
[47:33] under the control amen the ultimate
[47:35] control of him is because he's working
[47:37] everything according to his plan so
[47:39] therefore we cannot get so skewed in our
[47:42] thinking that the devil's got this and
[47:44] he's doing this and we give him so much
[47:46] credit but God is moving and he's
[47:48] touching and he's changing and he's
[47:50] moving he'll raise up kingdoms for a
[47:52] while and tear him down and he'll raise
[47:54] up another and put him in down because
[47:56] he's moving according to his word and
[47:59] he's a God he said you know a guide is
[48:01] someone to show you around you have to
[48:03] have a god when you don't know where
[48:04] you're going and a God is someone who's
[48:07] been there before they they have went
[48:09] through that before they have dealt with
[48:11] that before they have made choices there
[48:13] in that moment before and they know
[48:15] exactly where to move or how to do and
[48:17] that's why they're called to God you
[48:19] know one time I was in Paris and I went
[48:21] there with my wife and brother Danny
[48:22] Steam and sister Michelle and you know
[48:24] we we you get there and it's a total
[48:26] different language it's a total
[48:28] different culture it's a big huge City a
[48:30] bunch of bunch of conquer I call it a
[48:32] concrete jungle but it's a beautiful
[48:33] place in a lot of ways and a lot of
[48:35] architect but I didn't want to go there
[48:37] by myself I I ain't that kind of guy
[48:39] that wants to just drop in a city and
[48:41] learn all about it myself I wanted
[48:43] somebody who had been there before I
[48:45] wanted somebody who knew the language
[48:46] who knew the routes who knew where we
[48:48] needed to be and what time we needed to
[48:50] be there and how we needed to get there
[48:51] and so I I got a guide and there was a
[48:54] sister that went to a church and that
[48:56] was able to come over and be there with
[48:58] us and she knew the language she'd been
[48:59] there many times amen it made things a
[49:01] lot more enjoyable and a lot more easily
[49:04] because there was somebody who had been
[49:06] there before there was somebody could
[49:07] say no we don't want to go that way no
[49:09] this is shut down today we can't go
[49:11] there they knew all the languages they
[49:13] could speak to the taxi drivers they
[49:15] could tell us if it was a good she could
[49:16] say no this is not a good path or no
[49:18] that's a dangerous place you don't want
[49:20] to go she had been there before and this
[49:22] is God you know he's he's been here
[49:24] before he was here before you ever got
[49:27] here he knows exactly the climate you're
[49:30] in he knows exactly the situation you're
[49:32] in amen whatever situation you're in
[49:34] this morning he's already got somebody
[49:36] else out of that situation he's already
[49:39] dealt with things in life and situations
[49:41] that you think sometimes are so hard and
[49:44] so impossible but God has already been
[49:46] there he's already directed lives down
[49:49] that path you're not the first one to go
[49:51] through what you're going through you're
[49:52] not the first one to face difficulties
[49:54] you're not the first one to go through
[49:56] trials there's many that he has led
[49:58] through these past before and he has not
[50:01] lost one of them amen amen what a God I
[50:04] mean there might be gods that lost
[50:05] Hunters they might have lost passengers
[50:07] they might have lost this or that but
[50:09] this God has never lost to one but he
[50:12] has brought every one of them safely to
[50:14] their destination and this is the god
[50:16] that was speaking he said I'm bringing
[50:18] I'm sending my angel before you and he's
[50:20] going to lead you and guide you you're
[50:22] going he's going to go through great he
[50:24] didn't tell him about the Red Sea he
[50:25] didn't tell them about all the
[50:26] situations they was going to face he
[50:28] said but I'm going to be with you and
[50:31] not only am I going to lead you and
[50:32] guide you but I'm going to bring you to
[50:34] a prepared Place amen I'm so thankful
[50:37] for that that we have come in this time
[50:39] in this great time of darkness and
[50:41] darkness all around us and situations of
[50:43] every kind and it seems impossible that
[50:45] somehow we're going to get out of here
[50:47] but God said we're going to get out of
[50:49] here God said there's going to be a
[50:50] Rapture God said he's going to have a
[50:52] people for a Rapture and so he's going
[50:54] to guide he's going to direct he's going
[50:56] to move he's going to move obstacles
[50:58] he's going to move you around obstacles
[50:59] he's going if he can't take you round it
[51:01] above it or right he'll take you through
[51:03] it whatever he's got to do God's gonna
[51:05] get you to the destination to the place
[51:08] that he has prepared for you amen a God
[51:11] must know the way he must know exactly
[51:13] where the dangers are he must know
[51:15] exactly where the pitfalls are he must
[51:18] know exactly what trails you need to
[51:20] build on what trails you don't need to
[51:21] be on he has to be studied he has to
[51:24] listen to God when he got them out of
[51:25] the he got the children of Israel out of
[51:27] Egypt you know it looked like maybe he
[51:29] didn't know what he was doing it looked
[51:31] like he had got him lost it looked like
[51:33] they were entangled in the wilderness
[51:34] but God knew exactly what he was doing
[51:37] he was taking them down a certain paths
[51:39] and and so that I so the thought or the
[51:41] their path would get back to pharaoh and
[51:43] Pharaoh was like man they're lost they
[51:45] had look they supposed to be going this
[51:47] way they're going that way didn't Moses
[51:49] learn anything while he was in Egypt
[51:51] didn't he learned how to guide by the
[51:53] Stars didn't he learn but it wasn't
[51:54] Moses it was God now it was the pillar
[51:57] of fire that was God lived it was a
[51:59] pillar of fire who had already been
[52:01] there before he had made the mountains
[52:03] he had put the Red Sea where it was and
[52:06] he had placed it there amen not for
[52:08] their destruction but for Egypt's
[52:10] destruction and he had brought them to
[52:12] that place not for their destruction but
[52:15] for Egypt's destruction Hallelujah when
[52:18] you begin to realize God has brought you
[52:20] to a place not for your downfall not for
[52:23] your destruction not for your amen for
[52:26] you to go down but for you're the devil
[52:28] that is tormenting you for his
[52:30] destruction he's allowed this age to
[52:33] become what it is and he's opened the
[52:35] river's Euphrates and he's allowed every
[52:38] devil to infiltrate this place and to
[52:40] bring them into this place that we're in
[52:43] why not for your Destruction for his
[52:46] destruction not for your demise for his
[52:48] demise to bring you to a prepared Place
[52:52] amen a God is a select man if anything
[52:55] happens to you it's his responsibility
[52:59] Hallelujah he's got to take care of you
[53:01] he's got to see that you don't get lost
[53:04] it is his responsibility
[53:08] come on preach God has signed himself up
[53:12] to you
[53:13] he is concerned about the path that
[53:15] you're on he's watching over you he's
[53:18] leading you he's guiding you amen the
[53:20] Church of the Living God is not being
[53:22] led by the mental the mental ability of
[53:25] a man this church is not being led by a
[53:28] man this church is to be led by the
[53:30] pillar of Fire
[53:32] and it's what is leading the Church of
[53:34] the Living God it ain't a man it ain't
[53:36] my seventh grade Kentuckian preacher
[53:38] that's leading this church it is the
[53:40] pillar of fire this lit it wasn't Moses
[53:42] that was leading the children of Israel
[53:44] it was the pillar of fire that was
[53:46] leading he was the god
[53:48] and he's still the God today and
[53:50] therefore it is his responsibility it's
[53:53] not my responsibility amen so much to
[53:55] get a people amen for to make a people
[53:58] he came and to get people ready for a
[54:00] rapture
[54:02] amen amen is him that it's going to take
[54:05] care of you he's going to make sure you
[54:06] don't get lost he's going to make sure
[54:08] that he can come and move in the right
[54:10] moments he knows exactly where he's at
[54:13] regardless of the weather
[54:16] I don't know regardless of the storms
[54:19] that are around you he knows exactly
[54:21] where he's at regardless of the
[54:24] situation you're in he knows exactly
[54:26] where you're at
[54:27] Hallelujah aren't you glad you got a god
[54:30] like that that he don't ever get lost
[54:33] there might be Gods out there that get
[54:35] lost but this guy has never been lost
[54:37] this God knows exactly no matter how
[54:40] dark it gets how stormy it gets amen
[54:43] that he was out there on the Sea of
[54:44] Galilee and it got all stormy but he
[54:46] knew exactly where he was at
[54:49] come on somebody you might your boat
[54:51] this morning might be rocking and
[54:53] rolling and waves crashing all over you
[54:55] but the God knows exactly where you're
[54:57] at and he knows exactly how to get you
[55:00] out of where you're at
[55:03] he's a wonderful God
[55:05] you know what brother I don't talk about
[55:06] that in the God he said you know he said
[55:08] that we the guides they look at the
[55:10] stars they they they look at the North
[55:13] Star they pull that out and of course
[55:15] you know the North Star represents
[55:16] Christ the same yesterday today and
[55:18] forever others might wonder away but he
[55:20] Remains the Same and he said so they
[55:23] watched that but he said just in case
[55:25] there's clouds over that there's other
[55:27] ways that God can look he can look at a
[55:29] tree and he can see the bark and he can
[55:30] see which side it's on he can look at
[55:32] the Moss he can try and if he said if he
[55:34] can't even see it he can reach over
[55:36] there and he can feel it
[55:38] amen he puts his fingers upon it amen
[55:40] aren't you glad this God can put his
[55:43] finger on your life amen he knows
[55:45] exactly where things are going and which
[55:47] way they're heading amen he said you see
[55:49] on this an ordinary man can go up there
[55:51] and fill that tree and don't feel no
[55:52] difference in it he said but the God has
[55:55] been trained for he said he ever he said
[55:57] you ever see a man that was lost that
[55:59] every Everybody ever experience of being
[56:02] lost if have you ever been lost out in
[56:04] the woods
[56:05] it ain't a fun experience I remember as
[56:07] a little boy me and my dad went squirrel
[56:09] hunting one time and and we got turned
[56:11] around and we kept coming out and we
[56:13] thought for sure the truck is this way
[56:14] and and we'd come out on another Highway
[56:16] way way and like man how do we do that
[56:18] go back in the woods and come back out
[56:19] in the same place it's crazy you get on
[56:23] this walk and you keep going around
[56:24] brother Brandon talked about it on
[56:25] Superstition Mountain and all and then
[56:27] you get get it what's called an Indian
[56:29] death walk and that's what the world we
[56:31] see the world or you know they're
[56:34] walking around in a circle they're
[56:35] walking in a death march why because of
[56:38] Darkness they're lost you wonder why the
[56:40] world is going insane he goes in there
[56:42] and he talks about a man that went out
[56:44] in the wilderness and became so lost and
[56:46] lost his way and he said he actually
[56:48] went completely insane to where he
[56:50] didn't even know who he was he didn't
[56:52] even he thought he was an animal he
[56:53] thought it's all kinds of things he lost
[56:55] his ability to even think properly and
[56:58] this is exactly where we see the world
[57:00] why are we seeing the world in the
[57:02] condition that they're in it's because
[57:04] they've been in dark is too long
[57:06] they've been walking in darkness and the
[57:09] longer you're in darkness the more you
[57:10] lose your mind the longer in darkness
[57:12] and the longer you're lost the worse it
[57:14] gets and they've lost their mind to
[57:16] where they don't know if a man's a man
[57:18] or a woman's a woman they don't know
[57:19] they can identify as a cat and put a
[57:21] litter box listen this is the world that
[57:24] we're living in why are they in the
[57:25] condition because they went off without
[57:27] the guide and they have lost their mind
[57:30] and they've lost their ability to even
[57:32] think as a normal human being can think
[57:35] they can't even think they've lost their
[57:37] Compass to where they don't even know
[57:39] moralities no more to the point they've
[57:41] lost themselves and they can't even tell
[57:43] if they're a man or a woman or a dog or
[57:46] a cat I mean it's crazy
[57:48] oh we got people in rural Louisiana and
[57:52] Rural schools that you thought they
[57:54] wouldn't even be possible identifying as
[57:56] cats and dogs and doing I mean why
[57:59] because they've been in darkness too
[58:01] long they're going to preach and they've
[58:03] lost their minds to where they can't
[58:05] even reasonably figure things out as a
[58:08] human being
[58:09] it ought to be reasonable enough as a
[58:11] human being to know if a man's a man or
[58:13] a woman's a woman that ought not be too
[58:15] hard but they've lost their abilities
[58:18] because they've been in darkness because

[1:01:49] thing there ain't gonna be a tables
[1:01:50] Place set and not a person sitting there
[1:01:55] somebody every place that has been
[1:01:58] determined it shall be set that has been
[1:02:01] predestinated as a place there and
[1:02:04] there's going to be a body sitting there
[1:02:06] there's going to be a person sitting
[1:02:08] there and neither is there going to be a
[1:02:10] person show up that didn't know they was

[1:02:14] coming he knows everyone he has placed
[1:02:17] them there he put them there before the
[1:02:19] foundation of the world and the devil
[1:02:21] has tried to stop you the devil's trying
[1:02:23] to hinder you the devil said you're not
[1:02:25] going to make it but God said I got a
[1:02:27] place prepared for you and there ain't
[1:02:29] no devil in hell it's going to keep you
[1:02:31] from it I don't know about you but that
[1:02:33] gets me worked up
[1:02:35] that's me stimulated to realize I got a
[1:02:37] place and my name has been put there and
[1:02:40] the devil can try to rub it off and he
[1:02:42] can try to say it ain't so but God wrote
[1:02:45] my name on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:02:47] there ain't nothing the devil can do
[1:02:49] about it and the God is going to get me
[1:02:51] all the way

[1:03:11] well I've been sent to do this and they
[1:03:13] try to put their way in

[1:04:21] but brother Branham was not the guide
[1:04:23] he was a star

[1:04:29] was not the guide
[1:04:31] amen but the God was is there leading
[1:04:34] the church all the way
[1:04:39] he still repeats conversation he's still
[1:04:41] to the discerner the thoughts and
[1:04:43] intents of the heart
[1:04:46] you know we we it's just too good to
[1:04:48] leave out we had a sister one time that
[1:04:50] had been a beautician you know and she
[1:04:52] had it in mind that she needed you know
[1:04:55] cut her hair and things and so
[1:04:57] she she comes gave her heart to the Lord
[1:05:00] and and baptized in things a few few
[1:05:03] years or so down the road she got up one
[1:05:05] Sunday morning and she said you know to
[1:05:07] her husband she said I don't think God
[1:05:09] really cares said I got these dead ends
[1:05:10] here on my hair I need to clip them off
[1:05:13] so my hair grow right you know and
[1:05:14] things and so her husband was like ah
[1:05:16] you know what the word says about that
[1:05:18] and trying to talk to her and he's got
[1:05:19] to go to work and and he's
[1:05:22] he's like uh you know I I you don't need
[1:05:26] to do that please don't do that and she
[1:05:27] said well I just don't think God cares
[1:05:29] I'll tell you what he said I'm gonna go
[1:05:30] to church this morning and if God cares
[1:05:32] about it brother Tim will say something
[1:05:33] about cutting hair and if God don't care
[1:05:35] he won't say anything at all now it
[1:05:37] ain't like we get up every surface and
[1:05:38] preach about cutting hair
[1:05:41] you know I don't and so but that service
[1:05:44] by the town's preaching on he ain't
[1:05:45] preaching on hair and he's going down
[1:05:47] the road and all of a sudden he stops he
[1:05:49] says Sister Mary he said just like I
[1:05:51] told you when you gave your heart to God
[1:05:52] no more snippy snip sniff that still
[1:05:54] goes today wow
[1:05:58] tears just flooded out of her heart she
[1:06:01] knew God cared about that
[1:06:03] amen and God does still care about his
[1:06:05] word
[1:06:06] amen he's going to make sure that it's
[1:06:08] fulfilled he's going to make sure he's
[1:06:10] got somebody there that he can fulfill
[1:06:12] it through amen when Israel left Egypt
[1:06:16] to go to the promised land god knew they
[1:06:18] had never traveled that way before amen
[1:06:21] but they needed something to go with
[1:06:23] them or they'd lose their way so he sent
[1:06:25] them a God he said I'll send my angel
[1:06:27] the pillar of fire to keep you in the
[1:06:29] way to guide you to the promised land
[1:06:31] and the children of Israel followed to
[1:06:34] God
[1:06:35] the pillar of fire Cloud by day about
[1:06:38] pillar Fire by Night Cloud by day amen
[1:06:41] when it stopped they stopped
[1:06:44] when it Journey they journeyed Moses
[1:06:47] couldn't do this with all his learning
[1:06:48] he tried and all he did was produce one
[1:06:51] dead Egyptian he couldn't he couldn't
[1:06:53] deliver them with all of his learning he
[1:06:55] couldn't deliver them with his
[1:06:56] intellectual abilities
[1:06:57] and neither will any man deliver a child
[1:07:00] of God by intellectual abilities it
[1:07:03] won't happen the only way there's true
[1:07:04] freedom in the house of God is when the
[1:07:07] god comes the holy spirit is let loose
[1:07:10] to be going to move and to touch and to
[1:07:13] change hearts
[1:07:15] and this God was not was to come to
[1:07:17] provide all that he knew what was
[1:07:19] already needed
[1:07:21] yes sir listen to this I this is quite
[1:07:23] amazing
[1:07:25] excuse me I've been having little issues
[1:07:27] with my voice but we're going to go on
[1:07:29] through it says Moses and the people
[1:07:32] this was sent to me by Brother Andrew
[1:07:34] Spencer and it's quite quite amazing
[1:07:36] most of the people are in the desert and
[1:07:39] what was he going to do with all these
[1:07:40] people that had to be fed
[1:07:42] and feeding two and two or three million
[1:07:45] people requires a lot of food
[1:07:48] it requires a lot of food for just what
[1:07:50] we got in here
[1:07:52] it's just what it is it takes a lot of a
[1:07:54] lot of efforts
[1:07:55] and it's not just you know just
[1:07:57] something really but can you imagine two
[1:07:59] or three million people
[1:08:01] according to the quartermaster General
[1:08:03] in the Army it is reported that Moses
[1:08:06] would have had 15 had to have 1500 tons
[1:08:10] of food each day
[1:08:13] to feed this many people do you know
[1:08:16] that to bring that much food each day
[1:08:18] requires two freight trains at least a
[1:08:21] mile long each
[1:08:24] remember you they were in a desert so
[1:08:27] they'd have to have firewood to use to
[1:08:29] cook the food this is going to take 4
[1:08:32] 000 tons of wood and a few more freight
[1:08:35] trains each a mile long just for one day
[1:08:39] and to think they were 40 years in
[1:08:42] transit oh yeah they was going to have
[1:08:43] to have water so to have enough water to
[1:08:46] drink and to wash the dishes that they
[1:08:48] had it was going to take 11 million
[1:08:50] gallons each day and a freight train
[1:08:53] with tank cars 18 1800 miles long just
[1:08:56] to bring enough water for one day
[1:09:00] they had to get across the Red Sea at
[1:09:03] night
[1:09:04] if it was a narrow path double file this
[1:09:07] line would be 800 miles long and will
[1:09:10] require 35 days and nights to get
[1:09:12] through it
[1:09:15] so there had to be space in the Red Sea
[1:09:18] three miles wide so that they could walk
[1:09:21] five thousand the breasts to get over in
[1:09:24] one night
[1:09:25] but then there's another problem each
[1:09:27] time they camped at the end of the day
[1:09:29] the campground was two-thirds the size
[1:09:32] of State of Rhode Island was required a
[1:09:34] total of
[1:09:35] 750 square miles think of it this much
[1:09:39] space just for camping
[1:09:41] do you think Moses had all this figured
[1:09:43] out before he left Egypt
[1:09:47] you think you think he thought well I I
[1:09:49] okay I got this plan over here we're
[1:09:51] gonna make this you know when you go on
[1:09:53] a trip many times you got a lot of
[1:09:54] things planned
[1:09:56] well I'm gonna stay here this night or
[1:09:57] I'm gonna stop here I'm gonna do Moses
[1:09:59] didn't have all that figured out
[1:10:01] matter of fact when they left Egypt they
[1:10:03] apparently went the wrong direction
[1:10:07] he you know anyway it wasn't because
[1:10:10] Moses chose to go this way it's because
[1:10:12] the pillar of fire went that way
[1:10:15] amen so do you think God has any so with
[1:10:17] all of this if you think of all this you
[1:10:19] think God has any problem taking care of
[1:10:22] your need come on
[1:10:23] yeah and we can supply all of that and
[1:10:27] he supplied water out of a rock
[1:10:31] the most impossible place to get water
[1:10:35] and he brings that then people think
[1:10:37] well you know brother I'm talking about
[1:10:38] he said people get a mental thought of a
[1:10:40] rock having a little trickle he said
[1:10:42] this wasn't no little trickle this was a
[1:10:44] gusher
[1:10:45] it had to be to feel fulfill the desires
[1:10:48] of almost two whatever million people
[1:10:52] and then they're livestock and then all
[1:10:54] the things had to do with it do you
[1:10:56] think God could could take care of that
[1:10:58] that he can't take care of you
[1:11:00] oh yeah amen he can take care of all
[1:11:03] your needs
[1:11:06] or if they're physical Financial
[1:11:07] spiritual God is more than enough
[1:11:12] he's got it already figured out he's
[1:11:15] already done this before
[1:11:21] it's quite amazing
[1:11:23] when you think about it the parallels
[1:11:26] between the three Exodus
[1:11:28] you see where we're at the first second
[1:11:31] Exodus we'll read about it a little bit
[1:11:33] later too it was the killing of the uh
[1:11:36] was the killing of the of the newborns
[1:11:38] killing of children what have we got in
[1:11:41] this day people don't care if you kill
[1:11:43] an unborn child
[1:11:46] they're right in the streets for their
[1:11:48] rights to kill babies
[1:11:51] how dark are we
[1:11:54] when a person would get out and ride in
[1:11:56] a street to kill a baby and not only
[1:11:59] they wanting that they're wanting the
[1:12:01] ability to choose to either kill them or
[1:12:04] whatever amen even after birth
[1:12:07] and we got message people that's kind of
[1:12:10] went along with this idea of a woman's
[1:12:12] rights of choice
[1:12:13] come on people hurry come on how dark
[1:12:17] are we
[1:12:20] down people have become so affected by
[1:12:22] the darkness that their thoughts even go
[1:12:24] that way right and we see it right on
[1:12:28] the first second and third Exodus the
[1:12:30] killing of The Unborn
[1:12:31] or the new other babies and then we see
[1:12:34] then we see also in the first second
[1:12:36] third Exodus was also amen great
[1:12:39] Darkness
[1:12:41] it was darkness in Egypt it was Darkness
[1:12:44] there amen at the death of the Cross and
[1:12:46] it's also Darkness now
[1:12:49] but also I want you to understand that
[1:12:52] every Exodus there was the pillar of
[1:12:54] fire there was the angel of God to come
[1:12:57] and Lead his children
[1:12:59] and he's not going to give up now
[1:13:07] you know nature
[1:13:09] needs a guide people with science calls
[1:13:11] it instincts but is actually the guide
[1:13:14] they call it you know you know somehow
[1:13:16] it's pretty amazing that people can
[1:13:19] become so educated to become so stupid
[1:13:22] is I mean that they think that that that
[1:13:25] these animals do what they do because
[1:13:27] they somehow evolved from a little blob
[1:13:31] and they got the abilities to do what
[1:13:33] they do because of evolution
[1:13:36] that's pretty amazing it takes a lot of
[1:13:39] faith to believe that
[1:13:42] it takes a lot of faith to believe that
[1:13:44] what we're living in right now started
[1:13:45] with a
[1:13:48] that takes a lot of faith it takes more
[1:13:50] faith actually I think or to believe
[1:13:52] than a creator
[1:13:54] but they think that it could be just a
[1:13:56] just a bit just somehow in this vast
[1:13:59] Mast of nothingness
[1:14:02] Unlimited
[1:14:03] vast of nothingness these two little
[1:14:06] pieces of something come together
[1:14:08] and somehow they somehow they got
[1:14:10] together somehow in this vast mass of
[1:14:13] nothingness and they
[1:14:16] there wasn't a big bang all right
[1:14:18] did you know that there was a big bang
[1:14:21] but it was the voice of God that said
[1:14:23] let there be
[1:14:25] yes sir amen and he said let there be
[1:14:28] light and it was and so and God created
[1:14:33] he created male and female he created
[1:14:37] all the things that are upon the he
[1:14:39] created these things it was out of
[1:14:41] something more than our little p brains
[1:14:44] it was a vast mind of almighty God that
[1:14:47] he can make things so seems like that
[1:14:50] they're still yet today discovering
[1:14:52] man is so smart that they're still today
[1:14:55] discovering things that have been here
[1:14:58] for years and thousands whatever our
[1:15:01] many kind of years
[1:15:03] yeah they're still discovering them yeah
[1:15:06] and they think they got this all figured
[1:15:08] out come on now
[1:15:10] and they think that you know well this
[1:15:13] one does this because it evolved that
[1:15:15] way no it does that because God put it
[1:15:17] in there
[1:15:18] yeah brother Brian talked about the
[1:15:19] geese he said they ain't never been to
[1:15:21] the South the Ducks they ain't never
[1:15:23] been to this all they they were born in
[1:15:24] the Frozen North yeah
[1:15:26] and up in the 90s it wasn't Frozen when
[1:15:29] they was born but they was born up in
[1:15:30] that area amen that you'd think that
[1:15:32] wasn't possible in here they're born up
[1:15:34] in here but all of a sudden he said he
[1:15:37] said all of a sudden something will

[1:24:15] come on let's go
[1:24:16] you know I I was one time riding the
[1:24:19] bicycle
[1:24:20] I had this stupid idea of riding
[1:24:22] bicycles
[1:24:23] [Music]
[1:24:25] amen well anyway brother Tim Winters
[1:24:27] we're gonna ride with him and my dad was
[1:24:29] making this lupus about a five mile Loop
[1:24:31] and it was no easy Loop you know we
[1:24:33] ain't got no mountains we've got some
[1:24:34] pretty good Hills ourselves down there
[1:24:35] where we live
[1:24:36] and it don't take much of a hill to make
[1:24:38] it a bad Hill on a bicycle
[1:24:41] I've been up that hill all my life in
[1:24:43] the car and it wasn't never a big deal
[1:24:44] but on a bicycle that's a different
[1:24:47] story and we'd make him several I mean
[1:24:49] months we was riding this thing you know
[1:24:51] and we remember the Tim one day was
[1:24:52] hoofing up this one this last Hill that
[1:24:54] turned into my drive or our road pretty
[1:24:57] big old Hill and it seemed like it lasts
[1:24:59] forever
[1:25:00] and you're you're puffing and you're
[1:25:02] puffing and you're determined I'm not
[1:25:03] getting off my bike and pushing I'm
[1:25:05] gonna make it all the way up this hill
[1:25:07] and you're pushing I looked over brother
[1:25:09] Tim I said you know brother Tim this is
[1:25:11] the last Hill home
[1:25:13] this is the last one we've been around a
[1:25:15] lot of Curves and hills and things I
[1:25:18] said but this is the last deal I know
[1:25:20] I've been this way before

[1:25:27] make that last turn down there there's a
[1:25:28] house down there we can go sit on the
[1:25:30] couch and we can cool off and have a
[1:25:32] glass of ice too this is the last Hill
[1:25:35] and I said wouldn't it be something if
[1:25:37] we realized today is the last day
[1:25:40] how hard would we push
[1:25:43] how hard will we press when we thought
[1:25:45] man this is the last trial this is the
[1:25:49] last Mountain this is the last moment

[1:31:55] of what was taking place because there
[1:31:56] was a light that stood there and spoke
[1:31:58] that come and out of that light step to
[1:32:00] man no doubt about six foot tall and
[1:32:02] Olive complexion spoke to Mary there was
[1:32:05] a light that's shown on the hill to
[1:32:06] Shepherds amen it was lights that were
[1:32:09] shining and you know brother talks about
[1:32:11] this and it's a wonderful sermon and
[1:32:12] especially to listen to in this time
[1:32:14] that we're in it's a great Shining Light
[1:32:16] he said as we this time of season as we
[1:32:19] focus our thinking towards Christmas he
[1:32:21] said it's too bad a lot of the myths
[1:32:23] that we've allowed in called Santa Claus
[1:32:25] instead of the real Christmas of what
[1:32:27] it's supposed to be he said many little
[1:32:29] children in the land today know nothing
[1:32:31] more about Christmas the slave full of
[1:32:33] toys and some Mystic reindeers pouncing
[1:32:35] on the house to only learn later of that
[1:32:37] it was nothing but a myth that will
[1:32:39] eventually hurt their faith he said but
[1:32:41] when it comes to know the true Christmas
[1:32:43] that had nothing to do with reindeers or
[1:32:46] a man smoking a pipe or a fur coat he
[1:32:48] said it was the birth of our Lord's
[1:32:50] blessed Lord Jesus and the most usual to
[1:32:53] see how God worked in this manner
[1:32:55] because no other time would have ever
[1:32:57] worked in all the history of the world
[1:32:59] but this time
[1:33:02] notice another thing that parallels in
[1:33:05] this time is taxation
[1:33:08] money becomes worthless
[1:33:11] in the first accident was you build
[1:33:13] bricks without straw
[1:33:16] made it harder on their labors and
[1:33:18] things amen the second it was taxation
[1:33:20] and it seemed like this is ridiculous
[1:33:23] that we have to go and we got to move
[1:33:25] from this area over to here in my wife's
[1:33:28] pregnant and she's heavy with child and
[1:33:30] I got a loader on a donkey and go
[1:33:32] through the Wilderness and and you know
[1:33:34] it could have had a lot of gripes
[1:33:36] what's God allowing this
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:41] why is God allowing for certain people
[1:33:44] to be in power that we're living through
[1:33:46] his word listen another another thing
[1:33:47] that was that's a parallel is there was
[1:33:49] a pharaoh there was a king and now we
[1:33:52] got it again of people in power that
[1:33:54] don't know God right
[1:33:57] Pharaoh didn't know Moses amen Herod
[1:34:00] apparently didn't didn't believe in the
[1:34:02] in the king I mean he wanted to act like
[1:34:04] it but just enough to get close enough
[1:34:06] to kill him
[1:34:09] amen this is where we're at we're we're
[1:34:11] exactly parallel along the same lines
[1:34:14] it's coming and there's no other time in
[1:34:18] history
[1:34:19] would it work for a Rapture to take
[1:34:21] place in the time that we're living in
[1:34:25] great Darkness it'll be a lot of
[1:34:27] confusion people are caught up and you
[1:34:30] know things are taking place
[1:34:32] it's a time when Herod a murderer was a
[1:34:35] king it had to be this heartless man had
[1:34:39] to be king at that time
[1:34:41] there's brother Brown we're acquainted
[1:34:43] with the scriptures that said he slew
[1:34:45] all the children from two-year-old down
[1:34:46] trying to kill the Christ it had to be
[1:34:49] just at their time there had to be at
[1:34:52] that time a raise of Taxation that would
[1:34:55] cause Mary and Joseph to go back to
[1:34:58] their hometown of Bethlehem where they
[1:35:00] were registered and their birth was on
[1:35:02] record of the courts in the temple to be
[1:35:04] taxed that Christ had to be born in
[1:35:07] Bethlehem
[1:35:08] so it had to be
[1:35:11] now man thought Pharaoh thought I'm
[1:35:14] doing this Harry thought I'm doing this
[1:35:16] but God was doing this
[1:35:19] Biden I don't know what he thinks but he
[1:35:21] thinks maybe he's doing this or whoever
[1:35:24] behind him thinks they're doing is no
[1:35:25] God is doing this
[1:35:28] God is Raising Powers up
[1:35:31] God has allowed Russia to be what it is
[1:35:35] never before in history have man had the
[1:35:39] ability to burn the whole world
[1:35:44] come on
[1:35:47] maybe I guess maybe a Noah's day they
[1:35:50] might have had that kind of power but
[1:35:52] God didn't it wasn't time for that but
[1:35:54] here we are again
[1:35:58] and why because there's scriptures that
[1:36:00] says the Earth's going to burn with fire
[1:36:03] of course he's going to burn it with his
[1:36:04] fire too but it's going to be a fire of
[1:36:06] nuclear explosion
[1:36:08] this world is going to burn
[1:36:12] by the time of that I got this house and
[1:36:14] I it's all going to burn
[1:36:17] and we get so concerned about something
[1:36:19] that's gonna
[1:36:20] burn
[1:36:22] get so caught up in in building this and
[1:36:24] doing this and doing that I'm guilty of
[1:36:27] it we'll get so caught up in everyday
[1:36:29] life
[1:36:31] all of a sudden the news breaks and says
[1:36:34] this and we think why is it going to be
[1:36:37] going to be so stupid
[1:36:38] why why couldn't
[1:36:40] I couldn't steal him Trump but he should
[1:36:41] have got internet
[1:36:43] because God allowed it
[1:36:48] God allowed it to be so as American yeah
[1:36:51] it makes me angry
[1:36:53] to see what America's become but I know
[1:36:56] as a Christian and the message that we
[1:36:58] receive it has to be thus
[1:37:01] God has allowed it to be thus God had to
[1:37:04] bring her from a lamb to a dragon yeah
[1:37:06] it's in his word amen it started out as
[1:37:10] freedom of religion and his spoke as a
[1:37:12] lamb but it's going to speak as a dragon
[1:37:17] and you'll think man why are we going
[1:37:20] through what we're going God's allowed
[1:37:22] it yeah why am I going God's allowed it
[1:37:26] yeah it ain't easy to take may it
[1:37:28] probably wasn't easy for Joseph to load
[1:37:30] his nine months just about to pop
[1:37:32] pregnant woman on a donkey
[1:37:35] that's not a good idea
[1:37:40] it's barely a good idea to put her in a
[1:37:42] in a car during that time and get her
[1:37:44] down a bumpy road especially in
[1:37:45] Louisiana she'd love to have the baby on
[1:37:47] the way
[1:37:48] because of our our road system is
[1:37:51] terrible could you imagine as a husband
[1:37:53] in here saying
[1:37:56] we got to go to Bethlehem
[1:37:58] stupid
[1:38:00] Herod
[1:38:03] what a how is he I
[1:38:06] stupid Biden
[1:38:12] I can't believe Kamala God allowed it
[1:38:16] come on and we get so tore up about what
[1:38:19] God allowed come on and God's bringing
[1:38:22] it down to a certain place
[1:38:25] that a Rapture can take place
[1:38:28] that a birth can take place that a son
[1:38:31] can be welcomed
[1:38:34] and it seems so hard and it's a that's
[1:38:37] to tell you what this inflation if we'd
[1:38:38] had Trump we wouldn't be there and God
[1:38:41] allowed it
[1:38:42] and God brought it to this place I tell
[1:38:45] you what these gas prices wouldn't be
[1:38:47] this way maybe not but God allowed it
[1:38:52] [Music]
[1:38:53] so that his word could be fulfilled
[1:38:55] listen God is more concerned about his
[1:38:58] word being fulfilled than your
[1:39:00] pocketbook
[1:39:02] because he's already provided food and
[1:39:04] water before and if you need it again
[1:39:06] he'll provide it again
[1:39:09] he's the god
[1:39:12] thank you Lord
[1:39:15] and he puts him on a donkey
[1:39:17] it was a rough ride
[1:39:19] it wasn't in no Cadillac
[1:39:22] I don't know if anybody I I ain't never
[1:39:24] rode a donkey but horse is bad enough
[1:39:28] I couldn't imagine riding a donkey dumb
[1:39:30] stupid animal why am I on this donkey
[1:39:33] going down to Bethlehem this is so
[1:39:34] stupid
[1:39:38] I know I'm probably repeating a lot of
[1:39:40] conversations maybe a little different
[1:39:41] way
[1:39:43] why am I going through this
[1:39:47] so stupid
[1:39:50] God allowed it
[1:39:52] that his word can be fulfilled
[1:39:54] so he can bring his attributes to pass
[1:39:58] amen you're not in control God's in
[1:40:00] control it was a rough rugged Road
[1:40:04] the donkey would act up
[1:40:10] I can just imagine a sweat was pouring
[1:40:12] off of him and he's dragging his donkey
[1:40:14] I mean listen to donkey usually ain't
[1:40:15] real willing
[1:40:17] and and they you know dragging along and
[1:40:20] she's trying to keep her balance and
[1:40:21] holding her stomach like what in the
[1:40:23] world
[1:40:24] why am I
[1:40:27] he said but you know they got just on
[1:40:29] the outskirts just where they could kind
[1:40:31] of run around painting a picture he said
[1:40:33] they just got on the outskirts and
[1:40:34] they're looking over and they could see
[1:40:36] little lights of Bethlehem yeah yeah
[1:40:37] couldn't quite make it there that night
[1:40:39] he said because it wasn't good to travel
[1:40:40] at night because of robbers
[1:40:44] people that could murder them and kill
[1:40:46] them and take from them wouldn't he said
[1:40:48] there wasn't a whole lot of man could do
[1:40:49] just him and his wife and a donkey to
[1:40:52] keep the Predators and the robbers away
[1:40:54] from me it wasn't it didn't look like
[1:40:56] this made sense but there was a prophet
[1:40:59] that has spoke and said out of Bethlehem
[1:41:02] maybe oh yes
[1:41:05] so Herod said you know what he woke up
[1:41:07] one morning said I got a good idea I
[1:41:09] need some more money let's tax something
[1:41:11] you know what we're going to do we're
[1:41:12] going to get a census and we're going to
[1:41:13] make them go back to where they was born
[1:41:16] I have come up with a good idea
[1:41:21] greetings today Americans I have come up
[1:41:23] with something
[1:41:26] and this nonsense flows out of his mouth
[1:41:28] and you're looking like what
[1:41:33] I'll give you the money I just don't
[1:41:34] want to go to Bethlehem
[1:41:37] yeah but God said so
[1:41:41] I'm laboring this for a reason because
[1:41:43] we get so caught up in things that are
[1:41:45] going around us and God has allowed it
[1:41:49] God puts people in power he allows it to
[1:41:52] be that way
[1:41:53] because he's bringing it according to
[1:41:55] his word
[1:41:57] he said what if a wild beast would have
[1:41:59] took after that little party all Joseph
[1:42:01] had was a little stick in his hand and
[1:42:04] his wife could hardly move
[1:42:06] he said they had a lot to face he said
[1:42:09] but you know what that gives us a lot of
[1:42:11] consolation to know that we do not hold
[1:42:14] our destiny god holds our destiny he has
[1:42:18] ordained it to be so and there's nothing
[1:42:20] that'll ever interrupt the program of
[1:42:23] God we are bound to arrive
[1:42:27] Hallelujah it doesn't matter if
[1:42:29] inflation goes out the roof and you
[1:42:31] can't afford a hamburger we're bound to
[1:42:34] arise
[1:42:36] God's more interested in a Rapture than
[1:42:38] he is your daily bread and the things
[1:42:41] that you go through that are so
[1:42:42] concerning to us God is trying to get a
[1:42:45] people ready for a body change
[1:42:48] that's true yes
[1:42:50] so the world's an atmosphere
[1:42:53] because of Destruction and they're in
[1:42:55] the atmosphere for Destruction
[1:42:58] [Music]
[1:43:00] they had they it has to be because amen
[1:43:04] he said if God doesn't judge this
[1:43:05] generation he'll have to raise up Sodom
[1:43:08] and Gomorrah and apologize
[1:43:11] it's going to be judged
[1:43:15] he said looking at all these things
[1:43:19] he said to see this dark enveloping of
[1:43:22] time but God's hand is steadily moving
[1:43:24] on and nothing shall stop it he said I
[1:43:27] see today this little donkey two
[1:43:30] Travelers finally arrived and they come
[1:43:31] by night over the deserts they're
[1:43:33] setting just on a little mountain to the
[1:43:35] east of Bethlehem bethlehem's in a
[1:43:37] valley and there's a little mountain the
[1:43:39] road that comes in the Bethlehem curves
[1:43:40] east of Bethlehem goes down to the city
[1:43:42] near the corner I don't know if he
[1:43:44] actually ever been there but he knows
[1:43:46] what he's talking about
[1:43:49] Brother Brad has ever really showed I
[1:43:52] know when we was in Israel the guide
[1:43:53] there the brother that had been there
[1:43:55] Israel many times he said he never
[1:43:56] actually has found where brother Brown
[1:43:58] said yes I've been there I've looked
[1:44:01] forward too and I hadn't really found it
[1:44:02] yet either maybe you said it maybe he
[1:44:04] didn't but he sure described a lot of
[1:44:06] things about it
[1:44:08] you know brother brother Tim was talking
[1:44:10] about this he said one time he was
[1:44:12] listening to brother Branham in
[1:44:13] chronological order in the message and
[1:44:16] he said brother Brandon would have a
[1:44:18] discussion with his uh with his uh
[1:44:20] what's that what's the doctor there
[1:44:21] they've come up under I can't think of
[1:44:23] his name Dr Davis is that it anyway he's
[1:44:26] talking to him about and Dr Davis was
[1:44:28] adamant that John the Baptist baptized
[1:44:31] Jesus and Jesus baptized John the
[1:44:33] Baptist
[1:44:34] and he said brother man said no it
[1:44:35] didn't happen that way and Dad's like
[1:44:37] well how does he know it didn't happen
[1:44:38] that way and he goes next tape and he'd
[1:44:41] bring it up again and he said but it
[1:44:42] didn't happen that way he's ahead of me
[1:44:44] it didn't happen that way and he said
[1:44:46] well how does he know how does he know
[1:44:48] that it didn't happen what happened how
[1:44:49] does he know and when the next couple
[1:44:51] tapes down and he said it didn't happen
[1:44:53] that way he said the reason I know is
[1:44:54] because one day God set me there and I
[1:44:56] saw the whole thing
[1:44:59] it's kind of hard to argue with somebody
[1:45:01] who saw it
[1:45:03] amen so I don't know if he's actually
[1:45:04] there or just saw it but he describes it
[1:45:06] pretty good because I've been there and
[1:45:08] I went into Bethlehem Jagged rocks and
[1:45:10] things laying all around amen and so
[1:45:13] here they are he said I can see Joseph
[1:45:15] handling his wife real tender getting
[1:45:17] her off the donkey helps her to the
[1:45:19] ground deer with his little city we're
[1:45:21] just about there he said but I can see
[1:45:23] he said at that moment I see some stars
[1:45:25] that begin to twinkle a little brighter
[1:45:27] and he said looking up over Bethlehem to
[1:45:29] the east as they were there wondering as
[1:45:32] they gazed at the stars he said I can
[1:45:34] see him as they begin to line up and
[1:45:36] they begin to shine brighter and
[1:45:37] brighter and brighter and another place
[1:45:40] he said I see Joseph look at it and
[1:45:41] smiled a little bit oh yes he said but
[1:45:45] why was that light there he said because
[1:45:46] of thousands of miles over there was
[1:45:49] these Magis
[1:45:50] and brother let's go listen to this tape
[1:45:52] it's quite amazing he talks about he
[1:45:54] said there was some major eyes that were
[1:45:56] looking for that star
[1:45:58] he said why were they even looking how'd
[1:46:00] they even know to look he said because
[1:46:02] years before that the children of Israel
[1:46:05] were taken down there
[1:46:07] and he said Daniel begin to tell them
[1:46:10] and to reveal things to them and he said
[1:46:12] the very reason they were ready for the
[1:46:15] star was because a prophet was sent down
[1:46:17] to them
[1:46:19] and to think about that here they're
[1:46:21] thinking they're taking being taken down
[1:46:23] the bondage but why because God is there
[1:46:26] to fulfill his work he had to have some
[1:46:29] Magis down there ready to receive the
[1:46:32] word so when they saw the star they
[1:46:34] wouldn't just say well what is that and
[1:46:36] go about their business but they'll say
[1:46:38] there it is that's what we've been
[1:46:40] looking for
[1:46:41] yeah and they would load their camels
[1:46:43] and they would make a journey to go
[1:46:45] worship the king of kings
[1:46:47] because there had to be scriptures
[1:46:49] fulfilled so God's moving and doing it
[1:46:52] and it looks like all things are out of
[1:46:54] control look at what Israel done they're
[1:46:56] taking down the bondage but God's got a
[1:46:59] reason for it right
[1:47:01] so amazing when you see the what the the
[1:47:04] work of God and how he does things
[1:47:08] he said they watched diligently for it
[1:47:11] and he said if Christians would do the
[1:47:13] same thing not watch the stars but Watch
[1:47:16] God's word unfold him he said if we'd
[1:47:19] only notice it today and see how God is
[1:47:21] Promised in this day things we so
[1:47:23] gallantly stand for and God has promised
[1:47:25] to do him such as Healing The Sick and
[1:47:28] doing miracles
[1:47:29] he said if you notice God only reveals
[1:47:31] to those himself to those who search and
[1:47:34] long to see him draw an eye to me and
[1:47:36] I'll draw an eye to you saith the Lord
[1:47:38] sometimes sometimes God will let things
[1:47:40] happen so you will draw nigh to him
[1:47:44] oh yes he will
[1:47:46] he will yeah and them things ain't
[1:47:47] always easy
[1:47:49] amen they're hard yeah
[1:47:52] yeah one of the hardest trials I just
[1:47:54] had was with my mom passing away it
[1:47:57] wasn't easy
[1:47:58] very close to my mom
[1:48:00] I was her favorite preacher
[1:48:05] I'm proud of that
[1:48:07] my mom she supported me uh I went
[1:48:11] actually right after her passing and her
[1:48:13] funeral I was already scheduled to be up
[1:48:14] in Ohio at a youth meeting and I go out
[1:48:17] for my first service brother leaned over
[1:48:19] and said You Preach how your mama would
[1:48:21] want you to preach I said buddy that's
[1:48:23] dangerous
[1:48:25] because she she loved it she loved the
[1:48:28] word of God but God is guided
[1:48:31] he's used it
[1:48:32] yeah he's moved yes
[1:48:35] he never leaves you alone thank you Lord
[1:48:37] he never leaves you by yourself I don't
[1:48:39] care where you're at how dark it may
[1:48:42] seem how impossible it may be God is
[1:48:45] always there for you
[1:48:48] I'll just tell you the personal
[1:48:50] testimony of that as we bring this down
[1:48:52] I don't even know what my goodness
[1:48:56] I was at brother Ron Spencer's my mom
[1:48:59] was had been in and out of the hospital
[1:49:00] May a year ago
[1:49:03] was declining Decline and Decline and we
[1:49:05] we thought maybe our medicine got mixed
[1:49:07] up we didn't know what was happening but
[1:49:09] we didn't realize it was her on coming
[1:49:11] moments of passing
[1:49:15] and so she had been in the hospital

[1:51:01] next morning I get our that night I
[1:51:03] preached the next morning I'd get up me
[1:51:04] and sister Ruth to fly out the doctor
[1:51:06] called that that evening and said look
[1:51:08] we need her back at the hospital we
[1:51:10] actually found something that we need to
[1:51:12] do in her heart to check things out so
[1:51:14] I'm flying out she's going back to the
[1:51:16] hospital and I'm worried and tore up
[1:51:18] about it and I fly up to brother Ron's
[1:51:21] and go go up there and we spend a few
[1:51:23] days with him and Saturday night service
[1:51:25] Sunday morning service I'm preaching on
[1:51:27] a God who answers
[1:51:29] and I was speaking about the children of
[1:51:31] Israel and brother Brown talks about he
[1:51:33] said God always answers he said many
[1:51:34] times it's in an unexpected Place
[1:51:36] unexpected time an unexpected way he
[1:51:39] said but he always answers you just got
[1:51:40] to recognize this God
[1:51:42] and so I'm going along that way along
[1:51:44] that lines and I come down to the
[1:51:45] children of the three Hebrew children in
[1:51:47] the fire and I walk away and the brother
[1:51:48] Ron's got a little round spot of his
[1:51:51] platform that goes out and I walk out
[1:51:53] there and and I'm standing there talking
[1:51:55] for a while and preaching on the three
[1:51:57] Hebrew children in the fire and and my
[1:52:00] iPad had actually shut off and and it's
[1:52:02] black and and I I ain't paying no
[1:52:04] attention to it no more and I'm telling
[1:52:05] about that and I I said You know here
[1:52:07] they are there in this situation and
[1:52:09] they're they're down and down about to
[1:52:11] go in this fire I said but God never
[1:52:13] left them God was watching over them he
[1:52:16] was he was actually guiding Amen in that
[1:52:19] moment and that time it seemed like
[1:52:21] chaos was about to take place but God
[1:52:23] was watching brother Brown talks about
[1:52:25] this angel came and that angel came and
[1:52:27] he said but God said no he'd been good
[1:52:29] angels He said but this is a job for me
[1:52:32] and he said he grabbed the East Wind
[1:52:34] Called for the East Wind the West Wind
[1:52:35] and grabbed a zigzag of lighting and
[1:52:37] down in that fire he went and just as
[1:52:39] that they stepped in there there was the
[1:52:41] Fourth Man
[1:52:43] do you know you got to go through a fire
[1:52:45] to produce the fourth man yes you go
[1:52:47] through some hard trials it's only to
[1:52:49] bring God to you
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:52] and here they are and I said you know
[1:52:54] and that King he stopped and he's like
[1:52:56] well didn't I put three and now there's
[1:52:58] four and just as I said that I Heard a
[1:53:01] Voice begin to speak uh what in the
[1:53:03] world and I'm looking around trying to
[1:53:05] figure out where it come from and
[1:53:06] brother Ron sitting behind over there
[1:53:08] and another brother that plays the bass
[1:53:09] they had seen my iPad flash open they've
[1:53:12] seen it turn off my notes move over to
[1:53:15] the table or the uh or the tapes are and
[1:53:19] it's seen his flash through the tapes
[1:53:21] push the tape and push a spot to play
[1:53:24] and my iPad began to play and brother
[1:53:27] branham's voice begins to speak and he
[1:53:29] said I always loved that song he spent
[1:53:31] it especially in the time and day that
[1:53:33] we're living in he said they were he
[1:53:35] said he talks about Cleburne and they're
[1:53:37] the one that wrote it and I didn't catch
[1:53:38] it at the moment I didn't realize what
[1:53:40] song it was but but he said but he said
[1:53:43] that song speaks to me he said because
[1:53:44] it expresses the extreme deity of the
[1:53:47] Lord Jesus Christ especially in the day
[1:53:50] that we're living in he said they want
[1:53:52] to just make him a man but he was more
[1:53:54] than a man he was God
[1:53:57] and that voice spoke and uh and then God
[1:53:59] answered now I went back and I realized
[1:54:02] he was speaking about down from his
[1:54:04] glory
[1:54:05] here I'm speaking about he came down
[1:54:07] into the fire and the voice begins to
[1:54:10] speak about a song down from his glory I
[1:54:13] thought my mama was healed I thought it
[1:54:15] was over with God had spoke God had
[1:54:17] answered he's in the fire he's walking
[1:54:19] with me and just a few weeks later she
[1:54:21] would go down and she would continue
[1:54:23] down that spiral until we put her in a
[1:54:26] cold dark grave but God spoke to me
[1:54:28] right after that and he said you know
[1:54:30] what I didn't send that for you Mama I
[1:54:32] sent that for you I wanted you to know
[1:54:35] you was about to go through a fire but I
[1:54:38] wasn't Gonna Leave You but I was going
[1:54:40] to be with you and I was going to guide
[1:54:42] you and I was going to be with you every
[1:54:44] step of the way and I'm here to testify
[1:54:47] this God has not left me
[1:54:50] I may have been through a fire I may
[1:54:53] have been through a trial but he's
[1:54:55] walked with me every step of the way and
[1:54:57] I want you to know he's still a God for
[1:54:59] you
[1:55:00] he'll guide you through a fire he'll
[1:55:03] guide you through a storm he'll guide
[1:55:05] you he knows exactly he's such a God he
[1:55:08] knows where your children are at on he
[1:55:11] knows how to bring him back he knows
[1:55:13] exactly how to touch him how to touch
[1:55:15] their hearts and amend them in such a
[1:55:17] way that he'll rewrite all wrongs and
[1:55:19] change your heart and bring him back to
[1:55:22] the house of God I've seen him do it
[1:55:24] before and he's done It Before He'll Do
[1:55:27] It Again
[1:55:33] he knows exactly how to move he knows
[1:55:36] exactly how to orchestrate he knows
[1:55:38] exactly what he's doing
[1:55:43] you probably heard it but it's good to
[1:55:45] tell it again our bass player brother

[2:01:44] read a couple last things and we're
[2:01:45] going to bring it right on down right
[2:01:47] here this I got to bring this last part
[2:01:49] of you you ought to go listen to this
[2:01:50] tape it's incredible he said what are we
[2:01:52] today we are stars yeah he said every
[2:01:56] born-again Christian is a testimony to
[2:01:59] the Lord Jesus Christ a star to reflect
[2:02:02] the power and Holiness of the Lord Jesus
[2:02:05] to reflect him in his life to perfect to
[2:02:08] perfect him in his speech to perfect him
[2:02:10] and he in his healing power to perfect
[2:02:12] him in his resurrection Amen to reflect
[2:02:15] him in every way that he was reflected
[2:02:17] To Us by God the Father We Are Stars
[2:02:20] what kind of star should you be this
[2:02:23] star was not Guided by its own power it
[2:02:25] was Guided by the celestial powers of
[2:02:27] almighty God and if we're ever going to
[2:02:30] reflect Sinners to Christ we've got to
[2:02:32] be guided by the holy spirit amen we
[2:02:35] cannot be an ordinary people we have to
[2:02:37] be an unusual people we cannot be usual
[2:02:41] because God's people are peculiar people
[2:02:43] they've been down through all the ages
[2:02:45] although peculiar yet the star was
[2:02:47] brilliant not brilliant in the world's
[2:02:50] education not brilliant in the world's
[2:02:52] Affair but brilliant as sacrifice is
[2:02:55] before the Lord we prostate ourselves as
[2:02:59] the magias did in the presence of the
[2:03:00] king of kings to reflect his life
[2:03:04] yes sir you are a star every Christian
[2:03:08] is a star to guide the laws to guide the
[2:03:11] weary the foot of the traveler to those
[2:03:13] who are seeking then the star cannot be
[2:03:15] guided by itself it must be led by the
[2:03:19] spirit
[2:03:20] it must reflect the bridency of God in
[2:03:22] his life to abstain from the things of
[2:03:25] the world to live Godly and soberly it
[2:03:27] must reflect the light of a great one
[2:03:28] who shine what are we to do then to Rise
[2:03:31] and Shine the Light Of God to the Dying
[2:03:34] World in depths of Darkness of this
[2:03:37] world we were to reflect and Shine the
[2:03:39] presence of the Lord Jesus in his
[2:03:41] resurrecting power he is just as he was
[2:03:44] yesterday so he is today and we are to
[2:03:47] reflect him but remember when the start
[2:03:49] then the star again when it finished its
[2:03:51] course it takes no honor the star just
[2:03:55] brought men to their destination and to
[2:03:57] show them that perfect life and we as
[2:03:59] members of the body of Christ this
[2:04:01] morning we are God's lights and we but
[2:04:04] we take no honor to ourselves all honor
[2:04:08] belongs to him
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:11] he says as they were reading talking
[2:04:13] about the wise men and the sacred fire
