[18:03] [Music]
[18:07] heavenly father we thank you that we're
[18:09] yours tonight
[18:12] lord ownership means so much
[18:15] think of the scripture where you said in
[18:17] the day when you
[18:18] set aside your jewels lord and if you're
[18:21] doing that in this day i believe we are
[18:24] your peculiar treasure and
[18:26] we thank you for that it's not because
[18:28] of of anything we've done or any
[18:30] merit that we might have in our own
[18:32] selves but lord it's because you chose
[18:34] us to be that
[18:35] and i'm so grateful for that today
[18:38] lord it gives us such rest and peace to
[18:40] know that we're yours
[18:42] i pray that you would move in this
[18:44] audience tonight and
[18:46] lord i pray that each one that would
[18:48] that come lord to the house of god on a
[18:50] wednesday night would
[18:51] have a special blessing lord that you
[18:53] would just come down and
[18:55] anoint the word lord may you speak
[18:57] directly to those that are hearing or
[18:59] watching
[19:00] listening lord and i pray god that you
[19:03] would meet every need here tonight
[19:04] whatever is represented you know what it
[19:06] is
[19:07] i pray god you would meet it tonight we
[19:09] believe you will
[19:10] thank you for all you do in jesus name
[19:13] amen amen amen do you love the lord this
[19:17] evening
[19:19] turn with me to hebrews chapter 1 and
[19:20] verse 14.
[19:22] hebrews chapter 1 verse 14.
[19:26] read that verse one verse of the text
[19:29] that we read last
[19:30] wednesday night i want to
[19:33] remind you about our meetings coming up
[19:36] on saturday
[19:37] and sunday saturday night at six o'clock
[19:40] and sunday at 10 30.
[19:41] so i'll be ready for that and i'm trust
[19:44] will have some visitors as well but
[19:46] if you've got somebody that you'd like
[19:48] to invite to church this would be a good
[19:50] time to do it this weekend
[19:52] and i'm sure it'll be a blessing to us
[19:54] as well
[19:55] we always need revival you know that we
[19:58] constantly are in need of revival and
[20:00] that's the cry that we have in our
[20:02] hearts lord revive
[20:04] me and set me on fire let me be
[20:07] that one that sparked that sets off a
[20:09] fire
[20:10] a wildfire amen amen so i believe that
[20:14] we've seen god moving lately church i i
[20:17] can't tell you how pleased i am with the
[20:19] way the lord
[20:20] is moving in our midst and i believe
[20:22] there's more for us
[20:24] now's not the time to lay let our foot
[20:27] off the accelerator now is the time to
[20:28] push down harder and press that much
[20:31] harder we believe god
[20:33] is doing what he said he would do and
[20:34] meeting with us and
[20:36] we're grateful for that today hebrews
[20:37] chapter 1 and verse 14
[20:42] it says are they not all ministering
[20:44] spirits
[20:45] speaking of the angels sent forth to
[20:48] minister for them
[20:50] who shall be heirs of salvation
[20:53] and that's us amen i pray the lord
[20:56] without his blessing to the word you may
[20:57] be seated
[21:03] i'm going to finish this at some point i
[21:04] may not yet finish it tonight
[21:08] we found out that last wednesday that
[21:10] new testament angels come for the
[21:11] purpose of revealing hidden secrets
[21:14] they come to the disciples and said this
[21:16] same jesus
[21:17] will come again and like manners you've
[21:19] seen him go
[21:20] so they they explained the the the
[21:23] manner of his return
[21:25] they also came to philip to commission
[21:27] him in a ministry
[21:29] uh an angel come to him and told him to
[21:31] go down into
[21:32] uh to meet the uh the man in the desert
[21:35] and so we know that an angel came to him
[21:37] there for that purpose and we
[21:39] showed how that brother branham being
[21:41] commissioned by an angel wouldn't have
[21:43] been a strange thing to the new
[21:44] testament church because
[21:46] they believed in the supernatural and
[21:48] those kind of things and
[21:50] then we found that in cornelius's house
[21:52] that the angel come to cornelius
[21:54] for the purpose of instruction to let
[21:56] him know how to receive
[21:58] the holy ghost and how to receive the
[22:00] word from
[22:01] from the ministry of that day and we
[22:04] found
[22:04] that they're both earthly and heavenly
[22:06] angels that
[22:08] both of them have authority but both are
[22:10] sent as servants and i like the way that
[22:13] uh that in malachi 4 it says behold i
[22:16] send you
[22:17] elijah the prophet he come for us
[22:21] he didn't come for himself he come for
[22:22] us
[22:24] and so there's a reason why god sends an
[22:26] angel there always is a reason
[22:28] whether that's an earthly or a heavenly
[22:30] angel
[22:32] now i want to emphasize tonight that
[22:34] before we get started that angels do not
[22:36] replace the preeminence of the word
[22:39] the word is always preeminent the word
[22:41] is number one
[22:43] and and galatians one and eight says
[22:45] this but though we
[22:47] he said the we now that's the earthly
[22:49] messenger or an angel a heavenly
[22:50] messenger
[22:51] from heaven preach any other gospel unto
[22:54] you then that which you
[22:55] which we have preached unto you let him
[22:58] be accursed
[23:01] so it can't come with something
[23:03] different than what we already
[23:04] have in the scriptures in
[23:07] in 1963 brother branham says this this
[23:10] gives me
[23:11] such confidence in the message that we
[23:12] have he said not
[23:14] one time as that angel of the lord stand
[23:17] there
[23:17] has every one time told me anything but
[23:20] what went right back in the bible
[23:23] and proved it by the bible
[23:26] amen the heavenly angel was never wrong
[23:32] that ought to give us confidence
[23:33] shouldn't it he said but i
[23:36] saw where the earthly messenger was
[23:37] wrong wait a minute the heavenly angel
[23:39] was never wrong right so the message is
[23:42] right
[23:44] in fact you can say the message is
[23:45] perfect but earthly messengers of course
[23:47] are human
[23:48] right and so we make human mistakes but
[23:51] the heavenly angel was never wrong
[23:53] so we can have confidence in the message
[23:55] today like we have confidence in the
[23:57] scriptures now
[23:58] he says he told me he said he never told
[24:01] me anything but what went right back in
[24:03] the bible and proved it by the bible he
[24:04] said if it ever told me
[24:06] anything was contrary to the bible i
[24:08] would not believe it
[24:10] he said this bible is first any kind of
[24:13] an angel
[24:14] or anything else that would testify
[24:17] anything contrary to this word
[24:19] don't you listen to it he says i don't
[24:22] care how real it seems this is right
[24:26] and so i wanted to preface this tonight
[24:27] because we're going to talk about
[24:28] supernatural and
[24:30] i believe that god wants to move in a
[24:32] supernatural way
[24:33] in our midst but it wouldn't matter how
[24:35] supernatural it was if it
[24:37] didn't go back to the word it wouldn't
[24:38] be right so the word always comes first
[24:42] and that's god's primary method of
[24:44] speaking to you is just
[24:45] by his word he wants you just to believe
[24:48] it to take him at his word
[24:50] but brother branham put it in such a
[24:51] great way he said if i was god he said
[24:53] and you refused my word i'd just
[24:55] forget you you know i'm paraphrasing but
[24:57] he said
[24:58] god didn't stop there he sent angels he
[25:00] sent gifts into the
[25:01] into the world so that he might be able
[25:04] to persuade you
[25:06] amen i'm so glad that that god did that
[25:10] for us
[25:11] he didn't just leave us just with the
[25:13] word only but he sent the spirit
[25:15] to teach us the word now also messengers
[25:19] to come now
[25:20] he says don't you listen to it i don't
[25:22] care how real it seems this is right
[25:23] it's always right
[25:25] again in 1964 he said if i tell you
[25:27] anything that's not in the scripture
[25:29] and a promise for the hour your duty
[25:32] bound to see the manager here and come
[25:33] tell me about it
[25:35] he said that's right i teach nothing but
[25:37] what's in the word
[25:40] he said did he really well i'll tell you
[25:42] that's what the ones beyond the curtain
[25:44] of time were resting on
[25:48] hallelujah they said we're resting on
[25:51] the fact that
[25:52] you preach what paul preached
[25:55] and we could go pick apart all day and
[25:57] try to find all the faults and
[25:58] everything else in it
[25:59] but if you preach what paul preached we
[26:00] ought to be able to have confidence in
[26:02] the message
[26:03] you understand that we know brother
[26:04] branham was a man but we have confidence
[26:06] in this message that
[26:07] god sent it to us and we're able a full
[26:10] on air therein
[26:11] even those of us brother danny that
[26:13] aren't very smart
[26:15] not you but me but those of us who are
[26:18] country folk
[26:19] those of us with a limited education
[26:21] those of us who can't hurt
[26:22] we won't err they're in it was simple
[26:24] enough that we could understand it
[26:27] amen so he says
[26:31] he said i teach nothing but what's in
[26:33] the word and if i say right with that
[26:34] word and if i say it's that way and god
[26:36] it's in the bible
[26:37] he said if the angel of the lord told me
[26:38] something that wasn't in the bible
[26:40] it wouldn't be the angel of the lord
[26:44] right he said he has never one time told
[26:46] me anything but what was in that word
[26:49] he said if you bear me record he's never
[26:51] said one thing out of the hundreds of
[26:53] thousands and thousands
[26:55] and the languages of the world has he
[26:57] ever one time
[26:58] said anything wrong or said anything
[27:00] that didn't come to pass
[27:03] you go back and watch the discernment
[27:05] over and over and over again it was
[27:06] accurate and sometimes
[27:07] brother branham would slip up and he
[27:09] would have to spell it because he
[27:11] couldn't pronounce the name or
[27:12] or he would get something wrong because
[27:14] he'd see it he'd interpret it wrong but
[27:16] the angel was always right
[27:20] that's true we're mature we can handle
[27:22] that the angel was always right go look
[27:25] at it
[27:25] and you know if you've got something
[27:27] that's polished you have to wonder
[27:29] what somebody did to polish it but
[27:31] brother madam didn't come to us in a
[27:32] polished way paul said
[27:34] i didn't come to you with the words of
[27:35] men's wisdom he said but i come to you
[27:37] in the power and demonstration of the
[27:38] spirit
[27:40] brother didn't come to us in a polished
[27:42] way and you can sit and pick apart his
[27:43] words and his
[27:44] english and his lack of education but
[27:46] i'll tell you this the angel the lord
[27:48] stood there
[27:49] and vindicated it to be right
[27:54] hallelujah he said he's never one time
[27:57] said anything wrong or said anything
[27:58] that didn't come to pass
[28:00] now let's look at this angel this next
[28:03] time
[28:03] in acts chapter 12 and there are others
[28:07] that i'm going to skip
[28:08] other angelic events or visitations in
[28:10] the book of acts but
[28:12] i wanted to deal with this one in acts
[28:14] chapter 12 and verse 1
[28:17] and we find that at this time
[28:21] that in the book of acts that they've
[28:22] had a great revival and
[28:24] the gospel has left the jewish church
[28:28] or them alone and went to the gentiles
[28:31] so you'll find in chapter 10
[28:32] chapter 11 that there's a great revival
[28:35] in the and the gentiles
[28:36] in antioch the message is just booming
[28:39] if you can say it that way everything
[28:41] everybody's believing it
[28:43] it's just a wonderful time a great
[28:44] revival that how that spread like
[28:46] wildfire through that ancient world
[28:49] and here different ones went out and
[28:51] paul went out in different ones and
[28:53] cornelius house how that they received
[28:55] the holy ghost and all these things that
[28:57] happened
[28:58] and it's right about that time that we
[29:01] see
[29:02] herod the king stretching forth his hand
[29:05] to vex
[29:05] certain of the church and it proves to
[29:08] us the biblical principle that evil is
[29:11] always present wherever there's good
[29:14] whenever you have a revival there's
[29:16] going to be
[29:17] evil there whenever you try to do
[29:20] something as a church the satan's going
[29:22] to
[29:22] oppose you you know that because he
[29:25] stands and opposes god the old testament
[29:27] tells us that
[29:28] he when in job when he come before the
[29:30] sons of god he stands and argues with
[29:32] god
[29:33] he's not afraid to argue with you
[29:37] right because he argues with god
[29:40] and so it's always there evil is always
[29:43] present but don't look at the evil
[29:45] recognize that god uses that for the for
[29:47] a purpose of
[29:48] showing his power acts chapter 12 and
[29:51] verse 2
[29:51] it says herod killed james the brother
[29:53] of john with the sword
[29:55] and i thought it was striking that james
[29:57] and john had asked to sit at the side of
[30:00] jesus you remember
[30:01] the sons of thunder had their mother go
[30:03] and ask
[30:05] and i had mama go and ask for them to
[30:07] see if if they could sit by the
[30:09] by his side one on the right hand and
[30:10] one on the left
[30:12] and jesus said this he said are you able
[30:14] to be baptized with the baptism that
[30:16] i'll be baptized with
[30:18] are you able to drink from the cup that
[30:20] i'm drinking from
[30:25] and what's interesting is that james and
[30:27] john
[30:28] james is the first to die
[30:31] john is the last you talk about the
[30:34] sovereignty of god
[30:38] you would have thought from what jesus
[30:39] said but see that's where he said what's
[30:41] that to you
[30:43] he'll stand and fall before his own
[30:45] master james is the first
[30:47] apostle to die john is the last apostle
[30:49] to die and they had asked you but he
[30:51] said can you be
[30:52] baptized with the baptism i'm baptized
[30:54] with but god
[30:55] in his sovereignty had a different
[30:57] purpose for james than he did for john
[31:00] james had to be the first martyr john
[31:03] had to be the on the isle of patmos
[31:07] see that's the sovereignty of god god
[31:09] knows what your life is supposed to be
[31:11] like
[31:13] and we think we know but we don't know
[31:16] and we get in so much
[31:17] trouble when we when we bull rush it if
[31:20] that makes sense when we go headlong
[31:21] into it and we think well i can make it
[31:23] happen i can do this i can do this no
[31:26] stay with god because god knows what
[31:28] you're he knows what's around the corner
[31:30] you don't know what's around the corner
[31:32] you don't know and i've told you before
[31:34] i had a job one time sitting in a
[31:36] in a uh email attachment that was
[31:38] actually in my spam email at work it was
[31:41] set there for like a month
[31:43] before i actually opened up but it was
[31:44] the will of god
[31:46] but i didn't realize it was around the
[31:48] corner
[31:49] and if i had gotten frustrated and done
[31:51] something different i wouldn't have been
[31:52] in the will of god you understand
[31:54] god had something that he wanted to do
[31:56] and god's got something for you tonight
[31:58] every one of us
[32:00] that's the sovereignty of god acts
[32:03] chapter 12 and verse 3
[32:05] it says because he saw it please the
[32:07] jews he proceeded further to take peter
[32:10] also
[32:11] then were the days of unleavened bread
[32:14] and so that was about this time
[32:16] of the year actually it would have been
[32:20] pretty much this week all of those years
[32:24] ago
[32:25] and when he had apprehended him he put
[32:27] him in prison
[32:29] and see you know peter's probably
[32:31] thinking well
[32:33] this is it they already killed james
[32:37] if god didn't spare his life he probably
[32:38] won't spare mine
[32:41] you know how people get you see somebody
[32:43] down the road who got cancer and they
[32:45] died and then you get it and
[32:46] well that's probably it for me somebody
[32:49] had a stroke somebody did this
[32:50] and it killed them it took them down to
[32:52] see god
[32:54] god got something different for you
[32:57] god's sovereign will in your life is
[32:59] unique to your life
[33:02] absolutely unique and that's why it's so
[33:06] hard to
[33:06] tell somebody else to say brother ben
[33:08] what should i do well it's hard for me
[33:09] to tell you
[33:11] because god's sovereign will for your
[33:13] life is unique to you
[33:16] he don't always reveal that to me
[33:19] all i know is what the word says there's
[33:21] things that are right to do things that
[33:23] are wrong to do
[33:24] but i can't tell you what the sovereign
[33:25] will of god is for your life that's
[33:27] something you've got to get to down to
[33:28] business with god on
[33:32] so peter didn't know he probably thought
[33:34] that was the end he put him in prison
[33:35] delivered him to four quaternions of
[33:37] soldiers at 16
[33:39] soldiers working it was four soldiers
[33:41] working six hour shifts
[33:43] for 24 hours so he always had soldiers
[33:46] four soldiers there with him four
[33:47] quaternions
[33:49] to keep him intending after easter
[33:52] to bring him forth to the people
[33:56] verse 5 peter therefore was kept in
[33:58] prison
[33:59] oh i love this but prayer
[34:03] was made without ceasing of the church
[34:06] unto god for him they didn't give up
[34:11] amen you come on a wednesday night
[34:13] because you haven't give up
[34:15] it may look bad it may look like there's
[34:17] there's a terrible bondage and
[34:19] may look like that that situation will
[34:21] never change but you didn't give up
[34:25] hallelujah and brother branham tells us
[34:28] when he's talking to the prayer line he
[34:29] says now the power
[34:30] of the church this is that that next
[34:33] quote if i put it on there
[34:34] he said the power of the church is to
[34:37] come together
[34:39] and pray now think about that the power
[34:43] of the church
[34:44] is to come together and pray matthew 18
[34:48] and 18
[34:49] is jesus speaking this is where brother
[34:51] branham gets that remember he's a word
[34:53] prophet so the power of the church is to
[34:56] come together and pray matthew 18
[34:57] 18 verily i say unto you who's
[34:59] whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall
[35:02] be bound in heaven
[35:03] and whatsoever you shall loose on earth
[35:05] shall be loosed in heaven
[35:07] amen the church was about to release
[35:09] peter
[35:12] they were about to lose peter
[35:15] that's right the church praying was
[35:17] about to
[35:18] cause an angel to come to peter
[35:22] amen whatever you loose on earth shall
[35:24] be loosed in heaven again i say to you
[35:26] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[35:28] two of you you see why it's so important
[35:30] to be together
[35:32] so important and satan has attacked that
[35:34] today but if two of you can get together
[35:39] amen it's important to get together even
[35:42] in your own home
[35:44] you say well i have my prayers and he
[35:45] has his she has her prayers and i have
[35:47] mine
[35:48] but it's important because if two you
[35:49] can come together
[35:51] whatever you bind on earth will be bound
[35:53] in heaven
[35:55] if two of you agree on earth amen
[35:58] so we don't have to have agreement from
[36:00] everybody but if we can get two people
[36:05] that's a majority amen because god's
[36:08] with us
[36:09] but he wants us to come together that's
[36:11] the way he designed it for us to come
[36:12] together
[36:13] if two of you will agree on earth as
[36:14] touching anything that they shall ask it
[36:16] shall be done for them
[36:18] but my father which is in heaven do we
[36:20] believe that tonight
[36:22] that's what jesus said that's written
[36:24] and read matthew 18 and 24 where two or
[36:26] three
[36:27] are gathered together in my name there
[36:29] am i in the midst of him
[36:32] he promised to be here
[36:36] hallelujah brother branham and the
[36:38] easter seal now watch this
[36:40] because we've got these meetings coming
[36:41] up so i'm kind of i'm going to kind of
[36:42] dwell on this for a moment
[36:44] because i believe it's important it's
[36:46] important what atmosphere that we create
[36:48] if we're going to sing if we're going to
[36:49] come if we're going to be in the house
[36:51] of god
[36:52] if we could just take a few minutes
[36:53] before we come and kind of clear
[36:55] everything out
[36:55] or come a little early where we can sit
[36:57] down and sit in the presence of god
[36:59] because it takes a few minutes sometimes
[37:01] to get everything out of the way and so
[37:04] we're not lagging behind the atmosphere
[37:07] so when you come you're still you're in
[37:08] that same atmosphere because atmosphere
[37:11] does something and brother madam says
[37:13] the presbyterian church the methodist
[37:15] church the baptist church
[37:17] any of them can bring forth these eagles
[37:20] we'll say brother branham why can't we
[37:22] be a denomination then but now listen
[37:24] listen there's a reason why they don't
[37:27] but any of them could
[37:30] right he said sure it's the atmosphere
[37:32] that does it
[37:33] as dr bosworth used to say you could
[37:35] take a hen egg and put it under a pup
[37:37] and tie him down
[37:38] a pup would hatch out a chicken why it's
[37:41] the atmosphere
[37:43] and when any church
[37:47] you reckon word of life tabernacle is
[37:49] included in that
[37:51] now we've already seen the scripture he
[37:52] said well i don't i won't take that
[37:54] quote well look at the scripture
[37:55] if any two of you any two
[38:00] amen when any church or
[38:04] any group hallelujah that will assemble
[38:07] themselves together
[38:09] now that's something they've got to do
[38:12] any church or any group that will ascend
[38:14] themselves together and pray until now
[38:17] watch he said
[38:18] pray until they throw away their creeds
[38:19] and things that's why it don't happen in
[38:21] the baptist church the methodist church
[38:22] the presbyterian church because they
[38:25] can't come together and pray and throw
[38:26] away their cretes
[38:29] right that's why it don't happen it
[38:30] could if they would come together god
[38:33] don't care what name's outside there
[38:34] it don't help us any to have word of
[38:36] life tabernacle
[38:38] we could put message church we could put
[38:40] brother branham's name on the side we
[38:41] could do all that it wouldn't do us any
[38:43] good be nothing wrong with it but it
[38:44] wouldn't do us any good
[38:46] wouldn't mean anything more than baptist
[38:48] or methodist unless we come together
[38:49] lest we assemble together and pray and
[38:51] throw away our creeds and things
[38:53] and look straight in the face of god he
[38:55] said it'll bring forth eagles just as
[38:56] certain as i'm standing there
[38:59] hey man he said that's what i think this
[39:02] businessman's group has done he's
[39:03] speaking the full gospel businessmen
[39:05] he said trying to break up the
[39:07] atmosphere we're getting too clannish
[39:11] one belongs to this and that well i
[39:13] wonder what he'd say today about us
[39:15] message people
[39:19] but if you why you say brother ben why
[39:20] do you want fellowship it's because you
[39:22] want that atmosphere
[39:23] and when you know when you can get those
[39:24] licks of fire together you get people
[39:26] together
[39:26] it's not because i want sure i want this
[39:28] place to be full but that's not why i
[39:30] want fellowship
[39:31] i want fellowship because i know when
[39:32] people come together with
[39:34] needs god you know sometimes there has
[39:36] to be a need
[39:39] see for god to meet it there had to be a
[39:40] blind man there and the disciples said
[39:42] who sinned him or his parents he said
[39:44] neither he said that the glory of god
[39:45] might be
[39:46] known i might be shown in his life and
[39:49] and so sometimes somebody has to come
[39:51] just so they can be delivered
[39:54] amen so the church can see it so that
[39:57] they can get on fire for god
[40:00] so we come together he said let's break
[40:02] up the atmosphere
[40:03] and get the atmosphere in a heavenly
[40:05] worship don't you like an atmosphere
[40:07] like that
[40:08] don't you feel good when you get an
[40:09] atmosphere like that i'll tell you what
[40:12] i've told you lately i believe god's
[40:13] doing something i'm not just saying that
[40:15] lightly
[40:16] i've had more freedom to preach over the
[40:17] last few weeks than i've had in years
[40:19] and i have to say god's doing something
[40:22] so let's break up the atmosphere and get
[40:24] the atmosphere in a heavenly worship
[40:26] get the atmosphere right eagles will be
[40:28] born
[40:29] hallelujah listen out of any church
[40:33] anywhere hallelujah
[40:37] even in hardy arkansas yes in hardy
[40:39] arkansas
[40:41] any church anywhere
[40:45] brother branham talks about how a
[40:47] soldier will be so disciplined for his
[40:48] country
[40:50] he'll expose himself to enemy fire and
[40:53] give his life stick his head up out of
[40:54] the trench
[40:56] because his sergeant says go
[40:59] and he goes because of his training
[41:04] and love for his country and brother
[41:06] branham follows that up he said but a
[41:08] man
[41:08] seldom will you ever find one that will
[41:11] lay down his life for the cause of
[41:12] christ
[41:14] listen to this he said he won't even
[41:16] crawl out of his shade tree and go to
[41:18] church
[41:20] won't even get out from behind the
[41:21] television long enough to attend a
[41:23] wednesday night prayer meeting
[41:25] he said that's right amen it's a shame
[41:27] disgrace he said that's the reason the
[41:29] angels don't visit the churches
[41:31] that's the reason the angels don't visit
[41:33] homes we've got to get down to deep
[41:36] sincerity of this thing
[41:38] the angels of god are here listen on
[41:40] earth tonight
[41:42] just the same as they always been
[41:46] it's not an accident that they were
[41:48] praying when the angel came
[41:52] let's look at daniel chapter 9 and verse
[41:53] 20.
[41:57] it says in wiles i was speaking and
[42:00] praying and you can go read the prayer
[42:01] later
[42:02] but daniel makes a prayer before god we
[42:04] know daniel was a praying man
[42:06] but he's troubled because he doesn't
[42:07] understand he said while i was speaking
[42:10] and praying
[42:11] and confessing my sin and the sin of my
[42:14] people israel
[42:15] and presenting my supplication before
[42:17] the lord my god
[42:18] for the holy mountain of my god yay
[42:20] while i was speaking in prayer
[42:23] even the man gabriel whom i had seen in
[42:25] the vision at the beginning
[42:27] being caused to fly swiftly touch me
[42:31] about the time of the evening oblation
[42:34] watch we're going to get to a moment
[42:36] when an angel was delayed but in this
[42:37] instance the angel come quickly
[42:40] he was caused to fly swiftly why the son
[42:42] of god was on his knees in prayer
[42:46] you believe god could still do that
[42:47] today you believe god still wants to do
[42:50] that today
[42:51] when a son or daughter of god gets on
[42:53] their knees in prayer
[42:54] an angel come and flew swiftly and
[42:58] touched him
[42:59] informed me and talked with me and said
[43:02] oh daniel i've now come forth to give
[43:03] this skill and understanding
[43:05] at the beginning of thy supplications
[43:07] the commandment came forth and i am come
[43:09] to show thee
[43:10] for thou art greatly beloved therefore
[43:13] understand the matter
[43:15] and consider the vision now sometimes
[43:19] the angel is delayed and it's not
[43:21] because god is not powerful enough to
[43:23] send you
[43:24] send it right away but there's a purpose
[43:26] in the delay
[43:27] there's a time that's meant for it to be
[43:29] known
[43:30] and so sometimes you pray and you don't
[43:32] get an answer right away
[43:34] but you keep praying anyway daniel 10 10
[43:37] and behold the hand touched me
[43:39] which set me upon my knees and upon the
[43:41] palms of my hands
[43:42] and he said unto me oh daniel man
[43:44] greatly beloved understand the words
[43:46] that i speak unto thee
[43:48] and stand upright unto them i now sent
[43:51] when he had spoken this word unto me i
[43:53] stood trembling and then said he unto me
[43:55] fear not daniel
[43:56] for from the first day the doubt thou
[43:59] had set thine heart to understand
[44:01] and to chasten thyself before thy god
[44:03] thy words were heard
[44:04] and i am come for thy words
[44:08] i am come for thy words
[44:14] realize an angel could come because you
[44:16] prayed
[44:20] because you pray not because the
[44:21] preacher prayed or the preacher preached
[44:25] but because you prayed because a child
[44:28] prayed
[44:29] an angel might come
[44:33] you realize when we come to church what
[44:35] a powerful thing it is
[44:36] when we come together brother said
[44:38] that's the power of the church is to
[44:40] come together and pray
[44:41] not just that we would be here for hours
[44:43] and hours praying that's not what he's
[44:44] saying
[44:45] when we come together and we we ask we
[44:47] give our petitions to god there's a
[44:48] power in that of agreement
[44:50] and even as we're hearing the word
[44:52] angels could be coming
[44:55] why they're come for our words
[44:59] because we ask them to come
[45:03] sometimes you need to hear yourself ask
[45:08] you need to hear yourself ask you need
[45:10] to hear yourself pray
[45:13] you need to hear yourself there's
[45:14] something about speaking the word you
[45:16] know there's people they've proven this
[45:17] in psychology
[45:18] that if you'll speak something you're
[45:20] more likely to do it
[45:22] as long as it remains a thought you're
[45:23] not as likely to do it
[45:25] but if you'll speak it you're more
[45:26] likely to see it fulfilled
[45:29] how many times have you done that where
[45:30] you speak something and it comes to pass
[45:33] that's just the truth church you've seen
[45:35] it you'll speak something as long as it
[45:37] remains just a thought
[45:38] then it just don't nothing happens but
[45:39] when you speak it something happens
[45:41] if you could speak to god say god i
[45:43] believe we're going to have revival
[45:45] i believe you're coming i believe i
[45:47] repent of my sins i ask you to come and
[45:49] when we ask god to come he comes
[45:52] brother brandon preached the sermon go
[45:54] jesus keeps all his appointments
[45:57] very bad aren't you glad he does
[46:02] amen he said thy words were heard i've
[46:05] come for thy words but the prince of the
[46:06] kingdom of persia which stood me one in
[46:08] 20 days
[46:10] but don't mean there won't be a battle
[46:12] but he's coming
[46:14] oh michael one of the chief princes came
[46:16] to help me and i remain there with the
[46:17] kings of persia
[46:19] and now i am come to make thee
[46:21] understand what shall befall thy people
[46:23] in the latter days
[46:25] for yet the vision is for many days
[46:28] now this this vision it he had a certain
[46:31] time for it to be revealed
[46:32] and he even said about this part seal it
[46:34] up
[46:35] until the end right when it'll be made
[46:38] known
[46:40] seal it up into the end because and so
[46:42] there's no
[46:43] if god needed daniel to hear that the
[46:45] day he prayed he would have done it
[46:48] right but he allowed that
[46:51] he allowed the battle to take place
[46:54] because the time wasn't right yet
[46:58] now look brother branham tells the story
[47:02] you know the story
[47:03] there's two women from the same
[47:04] neighborhood that got prayed for
[47:06] both received their healing both went on
[47:09] testifying of their healing
[47:11] both still had symptoms
[47:15] and quite a while after that the
[47:17] meetings already moved on but the
[47:18] rhythms left the city
[47:20] this woman is standing at her sink
[47:22] thinking about these things
[47:25] and saying well the prophet of god told
[47:26] me that if i would if i would believe
[47:29] if i'd hold on to my testimony if i'd
[47:31] let that go then a worse thing would
[47:32] come on me so i have to hold on
[47:34] and she's thinking about these things i
[47:36] believe i'm healed
[47:38] and she was thinking about these things
[47:41] she decided to try a piece of toast
[47:43] and it it stayed down remember she had
[47:45] the stomach trouble
[47:47] it stayed down so she tried some oatmeal
[47:50] it stayed down she tried some coffee
[47:52] it stayed down at this point she was so
[47:56] excited she ran
[47:57] down to her neighbor's house who went to
[47:59] the meeting
[48:00] and she said when i got there she was
[48:02] screaming at the top of her voice
[48:04] and said the growth had just left her
[48:06] throat what was it it was the angel of
[48:08] god
[48:08] passing through the neighborhood he said
[48:12] god don't work like that i believe he
[48:13] does
[48:15] i believe he could do that tonight i
[48:16] believe he could do that this weekend
[48:18] but we've got to be under expectation
[48:20] lord if nobody else is there i'm going
[48:22] to gather myself together
[48:23] with the people of god and be expecting
[48:26] an angel to pass through
[48:29] god still does those things he said that
[48:31] blessings has been pronounced amen
[48:34] he said sometimes they can't get to you
[48:36] just as they wish
[48:38] he said how many times remember when
[48:40] daniel the angel come to him and said 21
[48:41] days he'd withstood
[48:43] you remember that he said daniel prayed
[48:44] but the angel said that he had trouble
[48:46] there and couldn't get to him for 21
[48:47] days after he made the prayer
[48:49] so don't be in a hurry just believe have
[48:52] faith
[48:53] he said if you accept jesus tonight as
[48:55] your healer have faith
[48:56] it's got to come to pass habakkuk 2 3
[48:59] said for the vision is yet for an
[49:01] appointed time
[49:02] but at the end it shall speak and not
[49:04] lie though it tarry wait for it
[49:06] because it will surely come it will not
[49:08] tarry in other words when the time is
[49:10] right the vision
[49:11] will be fulfilled
[49:15] an angel come to bring deliverance acts
[49:16] 12 and 6 and when herod
[49:18] would have brought him forth the same
[49:20] night peter was sleeping between two
[49:22] soldiers
[49:23] bound with two chains and the keepers
[49:26] before the door kept the prison
[49:28] and behold the angel of the lord came
[49:30] upon him noticed the level of bondage he
[49:33] was in
[49:34] he was bound with two chains
[49:37] one on one soldier one attached to the
[49:40] other soldier
[49:41] there was no way humanly speaking that
[49:45] he could possibly get out
[49:49] the keepers before the door kept the
[49:50] prison not only were there walls not
[49:52] only were there gates but there were
[49:54] soldiers
[49:56] there just to keep peter in prison
[50:00] and behold the angel of the lord came
[50:02] upon him
[50:05] now look i i wonder what the devil's
[50:07] using to guard your
[50:08] your jail cell
[50:12] what if he's scared enough that you
[50:15] might get out
[50:20] do you ever think about that you say
[50:21] well this got me bound awful tight i
[50:23] wonder if the devil
[50:24] is just scared that you might get out
[50:28] that's why every time you come to church
[50:30] something goes wrong
[50:31] that's why every time you get a little
[50:33] bit up he beats you back down
[50:36] why because he knows that if he could
[50:38] ever get free amen
[50:41] what havoc that would cost and he knows
[50:44] he's lost
[50:45] a lot of people out of prison the devil
[50:47] doesn't have a good record of keeping
[50:49] people in tombs
[50:51] or keeping people in jail
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:58] he doesn't have a good record at all
[51:01] everybody puts in prison gets out
[51:03] everybody puts in in a tomb raises up
[51:08] hallelujah he does everything he can
[51:11] imagine how much it must have frustrated
[51:13] the prince of darkness to know that
[51:15] these men he just couldn't seem to kill
[51:17] him
[51:17] and here he was rejoicing over james and
[51:19] he still said let's make sure
[51:21] let's inspire the romans to make sure
[51:23] that these these
[51:24] romans are these soldiers are all around
[51:26] them make sure they don't get out
[51:28] because they have a habit
[51:30] of getting out amen
[51:34] i wonder if he could say that about us
[51:36] that when we get we may get sick we may
[51:37] get down
[51:38] we may get depressed at times sure you
[51:40] live in the flesh you may get down but
[51:42] i'm telling you that there's a god
[51:44] that is so powerful in your life that
[51:46] the devil has to guard you extra close
[51:54] and behold the angel of the lord came
[51:56] upon him and a light shined in the
[51:58] prison
[51:59] and he smoked peter on the side i have
[52:02] kind of a funny picture of that because
[52:04] that's how i wake up peter every morning
[52:09] wake up i don't hit him but
[52:13] grab a blanket off of him my son doesn't
[52:16] take
[52:17] after his dad he takes after his mom he
[52:18] likes his sleep and
[52:20] he's a teenager so he wants to sleep in
[52:21] he wants to stay up all night and sleep
[52:23] in
[52:24] and i get ready to get up i want
[52:25] everybody in the house up you know
[52:29] and you know you're fighting a war of
[52:31] attrition when it comes to
[52:33] when you're homeschooled we're
[52:34] homeschooling the kids right now and
[52:36] trying to keep them trying to get them
[52:37] up in the morning and
[52:38] keep a schedule going it's hard it's
[52:40] really hard to do and so i'm
[52:41] going in there and sometimes you have to
[52:43] you have to peter get up
[52:47] because he's so so asleep that's what
[52:49] the angel of the lord did
[52:51] that's right he come in and he smote him
[52:53] on the side
[52:54] and raised him up saying rise up quickly
[52:58] and his chains fell off from his hands
[53:02] hallelujah his chains fell off of his
[53:04] hands
[53:05] and the angel said unto him gird thyself
[53:07] and bind all thy sandals
[53:08] and so he did and he saith unto him cast
[53:10] thy garment about thee
[53:12] and follow me imagine how peter felt
[53:16] somebody come hit him in the side his
[53:19] chains fall off they're sleeping
[53:20] soldiers on either side of him
[53:23] he said man i wish that angel wouldn't
[53:25] make so much noise
[53:28] the chain's rattling on the floor peter
[53:31] waking up in a start
[53:33] and the angel comes to him and says
[53:35] follow me
[53:39] he probably didn't realize where he was
[53:40] for 20 minutes
[53:43] in fact the bible kind of talks like
[53:44] that he didn't even know he's kind of in
[53:46] a daze
[53:47] see sometimes the message of deliverance
[53:49] catches us off guard
[53:52] it was an angel of deliverance with a
[53:53] message of deliverance the angel of god
[53:56] brother brother said these pictures back
[53:58] there if it doesn't bear record of
[53:59] christ then it's the wrong angel
[54:01] he said that about joseph smith seeing
[54:02] an angel who didn't bear the record of
[54:04] christ
[54:04] but a true angel of god will bear the
[54:06] record of christ the true grapevine
[54:08] will bear grace and a true spirit of god
[54:10] will manifest jesus christ
[54:13] if it doesn't then don't answer the
[54:14] european author but notice what he says
[54:16] this is so powerful church when i saw it
[54:19] it's like he's speaking directly to me
[54:21] speaking directly to you
[54:22] he said i defy the devil in all of his
[54:24] words
[54:25] it's the hour of the church's
[54:27] deliverance
[54:29] it's as if an angel come in and smote us
[54:31] on the side
[54:32] making some noise it's the hour of the
[54:34] church's deliverance and they're sitting
[54:36] under creeds and denominations
[54:37] and fussing and going on till they don't
[54:40] know their day
[54:42] amen fussing and fighting with one
[54:44] another will make you
[54:45] not recognize your day and hour but the
[54:48] hour of deliverance has come
[54:49] he said rise you to sleep and shake
[54:51] yourself
[54:53] call on god amen
[54:57] amen now is not the time to keep
[54:59] sleeping in the prison
[55:00] keep being bound to the chains now's the
[55:02] time to get up
[55:03] wake up the angel said get up follow me
[55:06] that's what a word come in our hour to
[55:08] say
[55:08] get up and follow the message of the
[55:11] hour all the way to the rapture
[55:13] rise you to sleep and shake yourself and
[55:16] call on god
[55:17] hallelujah he went out and followed him
[55:21] and wished not that it was true which
[55:24] was done by the angel
[55:26] but thought he saw a vision
[55:30] didn't even know that it was real
[55:33] what is strange is that the apostles had
[55:35] been delivered from prison by an angel
[55:37] already in the book of acts
[55:39] we didn't go go there but if you go back
[55:41] to chapter 5
[55:42] you find that the angels had already
[55:45] delivered the apostles out of the prison
[55:46] like i said there's a reason why they
[55:47] had so many
[55:48] because that time they put them in the
[55:50] common prison and they just got out
[55:52] and said the angel lord delivered them
[55:54] but it don't say how
[55:56] so they just disappeared and then the
[55:59] pharisees were looking for them so now
[56:01] herod must have heard about that and
[56:02] said well i'm going to make sure i keep
[56:03] him in prison
[56:07] because he's got a habit of escaping
[56:11] hallelujah and so
[56:14] pete but peter you know it's like it's
[56:16] as if human beings are hardwired to
[56:18] doubt the supernatural
[56:21] we just are now
[56:24] you know that it's true you see
[56:25] something you think well it may not be
[56:27] god
[56:29] what if it is god
[56:33] you begin to feel a little freedom you
[56:34] say well i don't want to get in the
[56:35] flesh i don't want to get
[56:36] i don't want to become a radical but
[56:39] what if it is god
[56:41] what if he wants to you know wake up
[56:46] amen what if he wants you to shake
[56:48] yourself
[56:50] now see if it's not of god it'll go
[56:52] against the word every time you watch it
[56:55] you watch it for a while don't that's
[56:57] why you don't lay hands on no man
[56:59] suddenly the bible says that don't mean
[57:01] don't don't
[57:02] lose your temper and grab somebody it
[57:03] means don't endorse someone suddenly
[57:07] because things you know flashes in the
[57:10] pan campground revivals can come and go
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:13] right but but something that's of god
[57:14] will have some results to it
[57:18] amen amen but yet you better not
[57:22] if you if you're a person of a cynical
[57:23] nature and you begin to doubt the
[57:25] supernatural
[57:26] you won't recognize when it when the
[57:27] angel comes
[57:29] jesus constantly had to rebuke his
[57:31] disciples for their lack of faith
[57:32] even after they saw him raise the dead
[57:37] they they still couldn't believe that
[57:40] he'd actually raised himself
[57:42] after they saw him raise lazarus
[57:46] do you ever think about that it was
[57:48] still hard for them to believe
[57:50] and thomas said i won't even believe it
[57:52] unless i stick my hand in that hole in
[57:54] his side
[57:58] and jesus being so gracious because
[58:00] thomas was a doubter but he was a real
[58:02] christian
[58:03] and jesus comes and said here's the nail
[58:05] prince he said i don't have to see him
[58:09] but they it was their nature it's our
[58:11] nature today to doubt
[58:13] but if we could just begin to expect god
[58:16] to be god what a difference it would
[58:20] make
[58:22] verse 10 says when they were past the
[58:23] first and second ward
[58:25] they come into the iron gate that
[58:26] leadeth into the city which opened to
[58:28] them of his own accord and they went out
[58:30] and passed on through one street and
[58:32] fourth with the angel departed from him
[58:35] and when peter was come to himself
[58:39] amen he woke up he finally got fully
[58:41] woke up
[58:43] he'd been stumbling along through the
[58:45] city the prisons open the guards are
[58:47] still sleeping the chains are rattling
[58:48] he finally gets outside the city the
[58:51] gates open up by themselves
[58:53] thinking boy that's strange walks
[58:56] through and kind of wakes up and says
[58:58] wait a minute
[59:01] i'm free
[59:05] i didn't do anything to set myself free
[59:09] but i'm free now i know for sure
[59:13] that the lord has sent his angel
[59:16] don't you realize every one of us have
[59:18] to come to that place
[59:20] you say well i've been in the message
[59:21] for all this time i believe the word of
[59:23] god for this time
[59:24] but you need to find that supernatural
[59:26] place where you know
[59:28] you're outside of the wall something
[59:30] brought me from there to here
[59:32] some power had to bring me out from the
[59:35] prison
[59:35] into the place where i am today amen
[59:39] listen brother baron talked about the
[59:40] token he said how do you know you have
[59:41] it what where are you and what
[59:43] are you now amen where were you you were
[59:47] in bondage
[59:47] now you're free what happened to you it
[59:50] was a supernatural intervention of god
[59:53] now i'm sure that the lord has sent his
[59:54] angel that delivered me out of the hand
[59:56] of herod
[59:57] and from all the expectation of the
[59:59] people of the jews
[1:00:01] i know something supernatural took place
[1:00:03] because i'm not in the prison anymore
[1:00:06] you see evidence of the supernatural is
[1:00:07] not what you feel
[1:00:09] when it takes place but it's what
[1:00:10] happens afterwards
[1:00:13] may not even recognize it while god's
[1:00:15] doing it but later you're going to see
[1:00:17] some fruit from him
[1:00:20] verse 12 and when he had considered the
[1:00:21] thing he come to the house of mary the
[1:00:24] mother of john
[1:00:25] whose surname was mark i love the fact
[1:00:28] that the first thing he does is go to
[1:00:30] church
[1:00:32] he knew they'd be meeting knew where the
[1:00:35] secret meeting place was
[1:00:37] during that persecution and the first
[1:00:40] thing he does is go to church
[1:00:42] where many were gathered together
[1:00:44] praying that's what free people do
[1:00:46] by the way he starts seeing them at
[1:00:49] church
[1:00:52] hallelujah and as peter knocked at the
[1:00:56] door of the gate
[1:00:56] well i could just stay on that for a
[1:00:58] while but i'm not going to god bless you
[1:01:00] if i preach that on wednesday night i'll
[1:01:02] be preaching to the choir
[1:01:04] and as peter knocked at the door of the
[1:01:05] gate a damn shall come to hark and name
[1:01:07] rhoda
[1:01:08] i love this when she knew peter's voice
[1:01:11] she opened not the gate for gladness
[1:01:15] but ran in and peter's out there kind of
[1:01:18] trying to be quiet to him soldiers right
[1:01:20] there looking for him somewhere
[1:01:22] because he's missing from prison he's an
[1:01:23] escapee
[1:01:25] so he's trying to be quiet knock on the
[1:01:27] door
[1:01:28] hey it's me
[1:01:32] i heard peter she runs back in the house
[1:01:36] i wish she'd opened the door
[1:01:40] says she opened not the gate for
[1:01:42] gladness you know sometimes people
[1:01:43] that recognize god's doing something
[1:01:45] supernatural act in ways that people
[1:01:47] think are inappropriate but it's just
[1:01:48] because of gladness
[1:01:51] but ran in and told how peter stood
[1:01:53] before the gate and they said unto her
[1:01:55] you're crazy
[1:01:58] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[1:02:00] even so
[1:02:02] and then said they it's his angel or in
[1:02:03] other words in our modern terms that's a
[1:02:05] ghost
[1:02:07] they must already killed him they
[1:02:10] already had him dead
[1:02:13] oh church but they kept praying anyway
[1:02:17] oh church if we can only understand the
[1:02:19] power of prayer of people gathering
[1:02:21] together and praying
[1:02:22] because and putting their licks of fire
[1:02:24] together just coming to the house of god
[1:02:26] and praying
[1:02:27] and they already they had already
[1:02:28] supposed that he was dead they said it's
[1:02:30] his ghost but peter continued knocking
[1:02:32] and when they had opened the door and
[1:02:33] saw him they were astonished
[1:02:37] hey you might be astonished to see
[1:02:39] somebody come
[1:02:41] that had the hardest heart in the world
[1:02:44] and all of a sudden they show up at the
[1:02:45] house of god why
[1:02:46] they've been delivered from bondage
[1:02:49] you've been praying but there's nothing
[1:02:50] else you could do
[1:02:51] but that's the time that god likes to
[1:02:53] work
[1:02:55] you see for deliverance to take place an
[1:02:58] angel must be recognized and his message
[1:03:00] must be obeyed
[1:03:02] watch what peter had to do he had to
[1:03:04] recognize he was an angel even though he
[1:03:06] was kind of in his stupor
[1:03:07] he followed him he wasn't fully awake
[1:03:10] but he followed him
[1:03:12] had to recognize what it was we find the
[1:03:14] children of israel in the wilderness
[1:03:15] if you'll give me just a few more
[1:03:16] minutes we'll finish this up the
[1:03:18] children of israel in the wilderness did
[1:03:20] not recognize their deliverance
[1:03:22] brother branham says it this way he said
[1:03:24] just as their time was for deliverance
[1:03:26] and they failed to see it so it's the
[1:03:29] time for the deliverance
[1:03:30] the marching orders for the church it's
[1:03:31] at hand
[1:03:33] he said look my friend they had what
[1:03:34] first the word
[1:03:36] second a prophet third an angel to lead
[1:03:39] them
[1:03:40] he said to guide them everyone agreed
[1:03:42] with the other the three of them
[1:03:45] watch the agreement the angel agreed
[1:03:48] with the prophet
[1:03:49] agree with the word the prophet agreed
[1:03:51] with the word agreed with the angel
[1:03:53] right there's no cow picking grass in
[1:03:56] the top of the tree
[1:03:58] it's the right time it's the right
[1:03:59] season they had all of that
[1:04:02] it was the hour of their deliverance but
[1:04:04] they failed to see it
[1:04:06] that's right remember that's why they so
[1:04:09] many of them died in the wilderness
[1:04:11] because they failed to see that the word
[1:04:13] agreed with the prophet
[1:04:15] he said and the prophet agreed with the
[1:04:17] word
[1:04:18] the angel agreed with all of them he
[1:04:20] said the word the prophet and angel they
[1:04:22] were ready for the march
[1:04:23] hope that should be the name of the lord
[1:04:24] god he said we're at the end time
[1:04:27] the word the prophet and the angel all
[1:04:29] three of them together one great
[1:04:31] testimony
[1:04:32] why would god do that why would god send
[1:04:34] a prophet in this age why would he send
[1:04:35] an angel the lord in this hour
[1:04:37] to commission a prophet to come and
[1:04:39] preach to us why would he do that
[1:04:41] why the supernatural at brother
[1:04:42] branham's ministry because he was
[1:04:44] sending the angel and the prophet in the
[1:04:46] word
[1:04:46] to come in agreement for the hour of
[1:04:48] deliverance
[1:04:50] amen and make us ready for the march
[1:04:53] into heaven now
[1:04:54] he says all three of them together one
[1:04:57] great testament god always said in the
[1:04:58] mouth of two or three witnesses let
[1:04:59] every word be established
[1:05:01] and a true prophet will always agree
[1:05:02] with the word and any angel will testify
[1:05:05] truth
[1:05:06] he said amen we're ready for marching
[1:05:08] orders
[1:05:09] sure he said he brought the people out
[1:05:11] on the road up they started rebelling
[1:05:13] against the prophet
[1:05:15] notice what happens when they rebel
[1:05:16] against the prophet they rebel against
[1:05:18] the angel
[1:05:20] and they rebel against god against the
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:26] now that's a sober thing to think about
[1:05:28] it always happens in that order
[1:05:30] they rebel against the prophet he must
[1:05:32] not know what he's talking about
[1:05:34] when they do they're really rebelling
[1:05:36] against the angel
[1:05:39] and then when they do they rebel against
[1:05:41] the word and you'll find out that it is
[1:05:43] biblical but they won't acknowledge that
[1:05:45] it is
[1:05:48] sobering thought church you want to be
[1:05:49] released from prison
[1:05:51] like peter was you want to have angelic
[1:05:52] visitation
[1:05:54] you've got to come in agreement with the
[1:05:55] angel and the prophet and the word
[1:06:00] that's right you say well that that part
[1:06:02] of it you know that's hard on me
[1:06:04] that's hard on me but that he sent an
[1:06:06] angel to tell us that
[1:06:08] it must have been important you
[1:06:10] understand
[1:06:12] it wasn't me it wasn't your pastor
[1:06:14] because all your pastor can do is point
[1:06:15] you to the prophet the angel in the word
[1:06:18] right and all of them lined up and he
[1:06:20] said well i don't think they line up
[1:06:22] well you need to go look again
[1:06:25] right and and maybe you haven't let
[1:06:26] brother branham be a man
[1:06:29] and it's made your focus off maybe
[1:06:32] you've ma maybe you've made him
[1:06:34] just a man and not a prophet that'll
[1:06:36] take your focus off too
[1:06:39] right because he was a prophet of god he
[1:06:41] was the prophet for this age you
[1:06:43] you've made your own word as important
[1:06:44] as a mess prophet messenger
[1:06:48] that's happened in a lot of churches
[1:06:51] now we want the supernatural don't we
[1:06:54] but when you don't stay with the angel
[1:06:56] in the word
[1:06:57] see as much as i want something
[1:06:58] supernatural to happen i've got to stay
[1:07:00] in those boundaries
[1:07:02] you understand if i don't but harvey i'm
[1:07:03] in trouble as a pastor i've got to
[1:07:06] as much as i would like to get excited
[1:07:08] and go outside of it
[1:07:10] but i got to stay with the angel and the
[1:07:12] prophet and the word
[1:07:14] we're going home
[1:07:18] the bible said there was a mixed
[1:07:20] multitude that went with them and that's
[1:07:22] the ones that generally rebel against
[1:07:23] the prophet and the angel in the word is
[1:07:24] the mixed multitude those who were not
[1:07:27] called they just came
[1:07:30] now look acts 12 and 17 but he beckoning
[1:07:33] unto them with the hand to hold their
[1:07:34] peace
[1:07:35] imagine what a tumult it was when they
[1:07:37] recognized it was him
[1:07:39] he'd been freed he says wait a minute he
[1:07:42] declared unto them how the lord had
[1:07:43] brought him out of the prison
[1:07:45] and said go show these things unto james
[1:07:47] and to the brethren that would be the
[1:07:48] james brother of jesus and he departed
[1:07:51] and went into another place
[1:07:53] now as soon as it was day there was no
[1:07:55] small stir
[1:07:57] among the soldiers hallelujah
[1:08:01] we're closing in just a minute but watch
[1:08:03] this there was no small stir i like the
[1:08:06] understated way that the writer puts it
[1:08:07] there
[1:08:08] no small stir among the soldiers
[1:08:11] what was become of peter
[1:08:16] remember there was a soldier on one side
[1:08:20] a soldier on the other side they're both
[1:08:22] chained to him
[1:08:24] huh their whole purpose in life
[1:08:28] was keeping peter in prison
[1:08:31] and there's there sleeping one on one
[1:08:32] side and one on the other
[1:08:35] and somehow during the night they missed
[1:08:38] the awakening of the bride
[1:08:42] think about it they missed the awakening
[1:08:46] of the bride
[1:08:47] they thought to keep him bound to keep a
[1:08:50] man of god that the people of god
[1:08:52] bound in within their denominational
[1:08:54] realms
[1:08:56] and somehow in the middle of the night
[1:08:57] they missed
[1:08:59] the awakening of the bride that's
[1:09:01] exactly what's happened in our time
[1:09:06] and so they started looking for him said
[1:09:07] we need a prophet to return
[1:09:09] and the prophet said they've already had
[1:09:11] it and they've missed the awakening of
[1:09:12] the bride
[1:09:13] they failed to see a supernatural angel
[1:09:16] bringing a message of deliverance
[1:09:19] amen when herod had sought him and found
[1:09:21] him not he examined the keepers and
[1:09:22] commanded that they should be put to
[1:09:24] death
[1:09:25] ichabod be written across the doors why
[1:09:27] because they let him out
[1:09:29] amen but you can't keep jesus in a tomb
[1:09:32] you can't keep the bride in a prison
[1:09:35] amen and he went down from judea to
[1:09:38] caesarea in their abode
[1:09:40] listen after this message of deliverance
[1:09:42] peter is missing from prison
[1:09:44] amen amen brother branham and i read
[1:09:47] this to you not long ago but i'll just
[1:09:48] read part of it now
[1:09:50] and works his faith expressed he said
[1:09:51] i've seen some lights flickering around
[1:09:53] in there
[1:09:53] i looked up and there stood the lord
[1:09:55] jesus with lights of rainbow around him
[1:09:57] he was looking right straight to me he
[1:09:59] said deliver those people and he went
[1:10:00] away
[1:10:02] and i thought well how could i deliver
[1:10:03] them i haven't got strength enough in my
[1:10:05] arms to break those bars
[1:10:07] so i said house of hell give way to the
[1:10:10] name of jesus christ
[1:10:13] pretty bad oh and the prisoners started
[1:10:16] to wake up
[1:10:18] all the creaking and popping and rocks
[1:10:20] rolling and bars falling
[1:10:22] and people running and screaming
[1:10:23] delivered and screaming at the top of
[1:10:25] their voice and was all delivered
[1:10:28] you see satan doesn't understand your
[1:10:30] deliverance
[1:10:33] he don't get it why you could be free
[1:10:37] but they lost a loved one but they've
[1:10:39] had trouble in the home
[1:10:40] but their bank account is minus 499.
[1:10:45] they got problems at home they got
[1:10:46] problems at school they got problems and
[1:10:48] here they are in the house of god
[1:10:50] saying amen to the word with a smile on
[1:10:52] their face excited
[1:10:53] to about to have a revival meeting the
[1:10:56] devil don't understand
[1:10:57] see he's looking for you he's wondering
[1:10:59] how did they escape denominationalism
[1:11:01] how did they escape laodicea
[1:11:03] how are they not bound how are they not
[1:11:05] in the same state everybody else is in
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:08] how are what are these people doing
[1:11:09] running around screaming at bars falling
[1:11:12] everywhere screaming delivered what are
[1:11:13] they doing you don't understand it
[1:11:15] why because you're hid under the mystery
[1:11:17] listen to me church you know
[1:11:19] as i'm closing your head under the
[1:11:20] mystery of the seventh seal
[1:11:23] amen the secret of his tabernacle shall
[1:11:25] he hide me
[1:11:26] hallelujah amen you're hid under the
[1:11:29] mystery of the seventh seal and the
[1:11:30] devil don't know
[1:11:31] why you can keep your joy he don't know
[1:11:33] why you can keep your salvation he don't
[1:11:35] know
[1:11:36] how you can make it through the hard
[1:11:37] times you've already been delivered
[1:11:40] hallelujah during the night an angel a
[1:11:43] message of deliverance came
[1:11:45] and the devil don't didn't even know
[1:11:47] when you were released
[1:11:52] musicians come and brother brano said
[1:11:56] this
[1:11:57] and just kind of get us primed up for
[1:11:59] the weekend now
[1:12:00] brother branham said this here he's
[1:12:03] being asked a question
[1:12:05] i feel really bad for the person that
[1:12:06] asked this question he was in a bad
[1:12:08] place
[1:12:09] he said i lived many years in sin until
[1:12:10] i found the lord
[1:12:12] please brother branham i have sinned
[1:12:13] again and i'm not worthy to come before
[1:12:15] you in this holy place
[1:12:16] please tell me if i can be restored holy
[1:12:18] again
[1:12:19] i think that would fit with a lot of
[1:12:21] people's lives
[1:12:23] please tell me if i can be fully
[1:12:24] restored please tell me if i can be
[1:12:27] restored holy again
[1:12:29] please help me brother brandon i have a
[1:12:30] devil in me help me will you lay your
[1:12:32] hands upon me
[1:12:34] and restore me again brother branham
[1:12:37] gives him a long answer
[1:12:38] and in the middle of that he begins to
[1:12:40] talk about johnny crow you remember the
[1:12:41] story
[1:12:43] johnny crow is flying around a man's got
[1:12:46] him tied up
[1:12:47] with a string around his foot just
[1:12:50] two days ago i was at my house and
[1:12:52] there's a robin
[1:12:54] in a tree and he's got a string
[1:12:58] somebody's flown a kite or something
[1:12:59] and got it in one of the trees and he's
[1:13:01] got that kite string wrapped around his
[1:13:03] foot
[1:13:04] and he can't get loose he can't get
[1:13:07] loose and so he's just
[1:13:08] he's flying we could see him fluttering
[1:13:10] up there we thought something was wrong
[1:13:11] with him we got closer he got that kite
[1:13:12] string on him
[1:13:13] so i we pulled up the truck and i got up
[1:13:15] there with a with a pair of scissors and
[1:13:17] i well as soon as i clipped that string
[1:13:19] he was gone
[1:13:21] i mean he was in the next yard in two
[1:13:22] seconds
[1:13:26] he was free she hadn't been there very
[1:13:30] long
[1:13:31] so he knew what freedom was like
[1:13:34] amen it's important not to stay in
[1:13:37] bondage
[1:13:39] because you don't have to
[1:13:43] because the more you say in bodies the
[1:13:45] more the habit of bondage gets on you
[1:13:50] you get stockholm syndrome you begin
[1:13:52] sympathizing with the devil
[1:13:56] he said i'd lay hands on you but that
[1:13:57] wouldn't free you
[1:13:59] what did freed johnny crow a good man
[1:14:01] come by one day and clip the string
[1:14:06] but johnny crow had flown for so many
[1:14:09] years
[1:14:09] in that same circuit
[1:14:12] that monday morning he woke up he said
[1:14:15] well here i go again
[1:14:19] got a monday morning flew in that same
[1:14:22] circuit not realizing he'd been freed
[1:14:23] he'd heard a message of deliverance and
[1:14:26] the message come by and said you're free
[1:14:28] a good man set him free and johnny crow
[1:14:30] just kept flying that same circle
[1:14:33] over and over again why he never
[1:14:36] recognized his deliverance
[1:14:38] because he'd gotten into the habit of
[1:14:40] bondage
[1:14:42] and so brother branham tells this person
[1:14:43] he says he relates that story to him he
[1:14:45] said i'd lay hands on you but that
[1:14:47] wouldn't free you
[1:14:48] what would for you is to understand that
[1:14:51] you're already free
[1:14:58] amen amen no graves going to hold your
[1:15:01] body down
[1:15:03] there's already a promise of
[1:15:05] resurrection i don't have to come and
[1:15:07] summon so much power
[1:15:08] that these ministers don't have to come
[1:15:10] and preach with such authority that
[1:15:12] would raise you out of the grace the
[1:15:13] words already spoken
[1:15:15] and the anointing is already here we
[1:15:17] just have to believe it
[1:15:19] he said you're already untied you don't
[1:15:22] have to worry about being free
[1:15:24] you're already free jesus made you free
[1:15:27] do we believe that tonight hey man let's
[1:15:30] stand together
[1:15:32] amen hallelujah give the lord a hand of
[1:15:35] praise
[1:15:36] you're already untied amen
[1:15:39] you don't have to be bound you can be
[1:15:42] free
[1:15:43] [Applause]
[1:15:44] amen hallelujah would you bow your heads
[1:15:48] with me for just a moment heavenly
[1:15:49] father
[1:15:50] lord jesus there's nothing i could do i
[1:15:53] could lay hands on the people as
[1:15:55] your prophet went on to explain to
[1:15:56] fulfill the word
[1:15:58] but it wouldn't set the people free
[1:16:01] they're already free
[1:16:03] lord may we recognize a message of
[1:16:06] deliverance that's come
[1:16:08] i pray you would help us to recognize it

[1:16:12] lord in our church as we come to this
[1:16:13] weekend lord we expect you to move

[1:16:35] waiting on another one to come

[1:19:59] greater is he that is
[1:20:04] is he that is in me
[1:20:07] the greater is he that is in me
[1:20:11] than he that is in the world
[1:20:16] and satan's like a roaring lion
[1:20:21] roaming to and fro
[1:20:25] seeking whom he may devour
[1:20:29] the bible tells us so
[1:20:34] many souls have been his pray
[1:20:38] to fall in some weak hour

[1:20:55] greater is he that is in me
[1:21:00] greater is he that isn't me
[1:21:03] than he that is in the world
[1:21:08] and on the day of pentecost
[1:21:12] rushing mighty wind
