[47:18] Exodus chapter 6 and verse 1.
[47:24] we're gonna kind of continue a little
[47:27] bit from what we preached Wednesday
[47:28] night if you weren't here weren't able
[47:30] to hear that you can go back and watch
[47:32] it if you want to we'll just kind of
[47:34] pick that up this morning and I want to
[47:37] talk about God's promises for today
[47:41] it says then the Lord said unto Moses
[47:43] now shalt thou see what I will do to
[47:46] pharaoh
[47:47] for with a strong hand shall he let them
[47:49] go and with a strong hand shall he drive
[47:52] them out of his land
[47:54] and God spake unto Moses and said unto
[47:56] him I am the Lord
[47:58] I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and
[48:02] unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty
[48:04] by my name Jehovah was I not known to
[48:07] them and I have also established my
[48:10] Covenant with them to give them the land
[48:11] of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage
[48:14] wherein they were strangers
[48:16] I have also heard the groaning of the
[48:18] children of Israel whom the Egyptians
[48:19] keep in bondage and I have remembered my
[48:23] Covenant
[48:24] he said wherefore say unto the children
[48:26] of Israel I am the Lord
[48:28] he said I will bring you out from under
[48:31] the burdens of the Egyptians I will rid
[48:34] you out of their bondage I will redeem
[48:36] you with a stretched out armor with
[48:38] great judgments I will take you to me
[48:41] for a people I will be to you a god you
[48:44] shall know that I am the Lord your God
[48:46] which bringeth you out from under the
[48:47] burdens of the Egyptians he said I will
[48:50] bring you in unto the land concerning
[48:53] the which I did swear to give it to
[48:55] Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will
[48:58] give it to you for an Heritage he said I
[49:02] am the Lord and Moses spakes so unto the
[49:05] children of Israel but they hearken not
[49:07] unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for
[49:11] cruel bondage I pray the Lord would add
[49:13] his Blessing to the word you may be
[49:14] seated
[49:15] this morning
[49:18] Wednesday night we spoke on anguish of
[49:21] spirit
[49:22] and the word anguish means to be short
[49:24] of spirit to be impatient in patience
[49:28] brought on by circumstances by things
[49:32] that were going on around them they were
[49:34] impatient with God because of the way
[49:36] things had worked out and so God they
[49:39] come to Moses we we relate the story to
[49:42] you and they told him why why have
[49:45] things gotten harder why why is it worse
[49:48] now than it was when we first came into
[49:51] the land why why here you brought the
[49:54] message to us and we believed it and and
[49:56] and we agreed with it but now now it
[50:00] seems like things have just gotten worse
[50:02] they didn't work out the way that we
[50:04] thought that they would and and then in
[50:06] Exodus 6 God responds and and he says I
[50:09] gave them seven promises seven seven I
[50:13] Wills that he gave them he said I will
[50:15] bring you out from under the burdens of
[50:17] the Egyptians I will rid you out of
[50:19] their bondage I I will redeem you I will
[50:21] tell thank you to me for a people I will
[50:24] be to you a God I will bring in you in
[50:26] unto the land I will give it to you for
[50:28] inheritage listen he was he was
[50:30] reinforcing to them the promises that he
[50:33] was revealing to them the promises that
[50:35] pertain to their day and their hour and
[50:38] yet they could not see that those
[50:40] promises were relevant because of the
[50:42] task Masters because of the hard bondage
[50:45] because of the struggles that they were
[50:46] going through they could not see oh my
[50:49] how many times has anguished of spirit
[50:51] has the shortness of our of our
[50:54] spiritual sight that kept us from seeing
[50:57] what God promised us in this day there
[50:59] are promises specific to our day not
[51:02] just for 40 years ago not just for
[51:04] tomorrow but promises specific for today
[51:07] he said I will redeem you I will bring
[51:10] you out I'm going to give you the land
[51:13] and that's the time that we live in
[51:15] today
[51:16] he said I will it was a positive promise
[51:19] this is a positive message but many
[51:23] people only see the restrictions they
[51:25] only see what they can't do and the
[51:27] reason why that's all that they see is
[51:29] because they of Anguish a spirit of they
[51:31] see the bondage they can't look by faith
[51:33] and so we found out Wednesday night that
[51:35] the the antidote to that was to wait on
[51:38] the Lord they wait on the Lord shall
[51:39] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[51:41] with wings like Eagle they shall run and
[51:43] not be weary they shall walk and not
[51:45] faint
[51:47] so we wait on God
[51:49] brother Branham tells us that man is
[51:51] always praising God religious man for
[51:55] what he done and always pointing people
[51:58] to what he's going to do and then
[52:01] ignoring what he's doing that's right
[52:03] isn't that just the nature of man he
[52:06] said that's just man he's made that way
[52:07] he's always been that way so we find
[52:12] that that was the case when Jesus come
[52:13] to the Earth that all of the promises
[52:16] were fulfilled in him yet people could
[52:20] not see the Fulfillment of the promise
[52:22] because he was walking in flesh there's
[52:26] something about the fact that God
[52:28] manifests his promise in flesh you
[52:30] realize he only manifests his promise
[52:33] through flesh how many know that this
[52:35] morning God could have chosen to use
[52:37] anything he wanted to use that manifest
[52:39] his promise but his promised word is
[52:41] manifested in flesh
[52:43] and so his promised word was manifested
[52:46] in the flesh of Jesus and they could not
[52:48] see it because they knew that Jesus was
[52:51] a man he was a man but he was also God
[52:54] right but they could see that he was a
[52:56] man brother Stewart so they could not
[52:57] recognize the promises of God in that
[53:00] man
[53:01] and so now when Jesus come to the Earth
[53:04] and and he began to he began to speak
[53:07] and he began to do he began to act what
[53:09] was it all the promises of the Old
[53:12] Testament someone say all this morning
[53:15] every promise
[53:17] of the Old Testament was fulfilled in
[53:20] the body of Jesus Christ
[53:24] every one of them
[53:26] oh my all the types
[53:29] all the ceremony there's a reason why we
[53:32] don't drag goats up here and sacrifice
[53:34] them
[53:35] there's a reason why I don't wear a
[53:36] linen ephod and walk up here and do all
[53:39] kinds of things and and we I don't have
[53:41] a holy of holy so we can go into it or
[53:43] Tabernacle or shoe bread there's a
[53:45] reason why we don't do those things
[53:46] because all of the types were fulfilled
[53:49] in Christ
[53:50] all of the Old Testament was wrapped up
[53:52] in a body of Flesh and was displayed he
[53:56] said I didn't come to do away with the
[53:58] law but I come to fulfill the law
[54:01] he was the Old Testament manifested this
[54:04] is what God meant this is what God
[54:06] intended this is what God was
[54:09] right
[54:11] so now but people looking back looking
[54:13] forward could not see what was going on
[54:16] right then yeah
[54:18] that God hidden failed in flesh go
[54:22] listen to the unveiling of God
[54:24] when you have time go go sit in your
[54:27] home or in the car or somewhere listen
[54:29] to the unveiling of God body God
[54:30] unveiled before us and you'll find
[54:32] brother Brandon talking about these
[54:34] things now
[54:35] when when he came to the Earth all these
[54:37] promises were fulfilled
[54:39] the promise of that day was fulfilled in
[54:42] Christ Psalms 40 and 7 he said lo I come
[54:45] in the volume of the book
[54:47] in other words in the entirety of the
[54:49] book it is written of me
[54:52] and Hebrews in Hebrews Paul lets us know
[54:54] that he's speaking of himself
[54:56] a speaking of Christ look 421 he began
[54:59] to say unto them this day
[55:01] and wouldn't you like to have been there
[55:02] that morning what a positive message
[55:06] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[55:09] your ears
[55:10] that's a positive message right there
[55:13] but they couldn't see it
[55:15] because they said this is Joseph's son
[55:17] this is the carpenter we grew up around
[55:20] him we some of us went to school with
[55:21] him we uh you know or whatever that it
[55:23] was that they did we played in the dirt
[55:25] with him
[55:26] and they couldn't see past the veil of
[55:28] the flesh oh God if we could only see it
[55:31] this morning
[55:32] so he was the manifestation of all the
[55:35] promises of the Old Testament all the
[55:37] types all the Shadows all the ceremonies
[55:40] all was manifested in Jesus Christ
[55:43] now in the New Testament so our the
[55:46] Bible is made up of two Testaments or
[55:48] two covenants the Old Testament was was
[55:51] wrapped up in Christ and then we have a
[55:54] new testament now the New Testament or
[55:56] the New Covenant also contains promises
[56:00] right and this is what they they were
[56:03] trying to understand well why are we
[56:04] under bondage why are we going through
[56:06] these things but he said the promises
[56:07] are still true God's still doing what he
[56:10] does
[56:11] and remember when you get sick when you
[56:13] get lonely when you get discouraged when
[56:15] there's people's like nothing's working
[56:16] out remember God still keeps his word he
[56:20] keeps his word today he'll keep his word
[56:22] tomorrow he kept his word yesterday he
[56:25] has not changed because you messed up he
[56:27] has not changed because you're different
[56:28] than he used to be or if I could drive
[56:30] that home to you today he has not
[56:32] changed because you're different he
[56:34] didn't change me oh God because you made
[56:36] a mistake he did not change because you
[56:39] got old he did not change because we
[56:41] live in another time he said I'm God and
[56:43] I change the heart
[56:45] Hallelujah so the unchanging God the
[56:48] same yesterday today and forever is
[56:51] still God today and any promise of the
[56:53] word is able to be manifested in your
[56:55] flesh today
[56:58] now we don't manifest the Old Testament
[57:00] ceremony but what do we manifest the New
[57:03] Testament
[57:04] right
[57:06] oh my
[57:07] God I'm going to show you that in just a
[57:08] moment
[57:09] so now
[57:11] in the New Testament all these promises
[57:13] were made
[57:14] but all to be revealed at the time of
[57:16] the end
[57:17] God Reveals His word how
[57:20] you've all heard brother Brown say it
[57:22] how does he fulfill his word by bringing
[57:25] it to pass
[57:26] God interprets his word by bringing it
[57:29] to pass
[57:31] right so now we find in the scripture if
[57:34] you just permit me for a moment to go
[57:36] over some things that you know but just
[57:38] to reinforce our faith we find a
[57:40] scripture in Daniel 12 and 4. he says
[57:43] Thou Daniel shut up the worse and seal
[57:46] the book
[57:47] now what was this the Old Testament was
[57:49] revealed the Seal of the Old Testament
[57:52] was broke in Jesus Christ
[57:54] but the Seal of the whole thing the
[57:57] whole the entire book was filled with
[57:58] Seven Seals
[58:00] right and it was sealed with Seven Seals
[58:02] and and so there were things pertaining
[58:04] to the end time that would be sealed and
[58:06] would only be made known at the end time
[58:10] right so he said Daniel shut up the word
[58:12] seal the book even to win to the time of
[58:15] the end
[58:16] I think even a fool could see today
[58:18] we're at the time of the end
[58:21] and so he says many will run to and fro
[58:24] there will be all kinds of programs on
[58:26] the internet there will be all kinds of
[58:28] programs on on TV they'll tell you about
[58:30] the end times and and they'll they'll
[58:33] pretend to speak for God and many of
[58:35] them they have good ideas they have good
[58:37] things but we would have to have an
[58:39] authoritative word there's got to be an
[58:41] opening at the end time there's got to
[58:42] be a something we can rely on we got to
[58:45] have an absolute somewhere something we
[58:47] can we can put our hat on and say this
[58:49] is the truth
[58:51] God could just leave us without any
[58:54] ability to say this is true
[58:56] oh God we don't realize what this
[58:58] message did for us now look
[59:00] so now
[59:01] when the Mania run to and from knowledge
[59:03] will be increased
[59:05] and then but down in verse 9 the same
[59:07] chapter he said go that way Daniel
[59:09] for the words they're closed up
[59:11] and sealed till the time of the end
[59:16] these words pertaining to New Testament
[59:18] promises now
[59:19] we live in the end time
[59:21] we have seen the Fulfillment of this
[59:25] scripture of Daniel 12. how many believe
[59:27] that
[59:29] we have seen that
[59:31] he said how can you say that well
[59:33] because God interpreted his word by
[59:36] bringing it to pass look at Revelation
[59:38] chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10 and
[59:40] verse 1. what happens at the end time we
[59:43] know this is the end time because he
[59:45] cried time will be no longer there'll be
[59:46] no more delay so there comes a time when
[59:49] the Last Promise is unveiled
[59:52] hey man amen I will I will I will you
[59:56] see where I'm going now I will I will I
[59:59] will bring you out I will give you a
[1:00:01] future home I will bring you into a land
[1:00:03] I will I will I will and finally The
[1:00:05] Last Promise is unveiled
[1:00:08] oh look at what happens in Revelation
[1:00:10] 10-1 I saw another Mighty Angel come
[1:00:13] down from heaven close with the cloud a
[1:00:15] rainbow is upon his head his face was
[1:00:17] says it worth a son his feet is pillars
[1:00:19] of fire he had in his hand a little book
[1:00:22] sir the same book brother Branham tells
[1:00:25] us
[1:00:26] right that was that was what was sealed
[1:00:28] with Seven Seals
[1:00:30] but when this angel had that book it was
[1:00:32] open
[1:00:33] he had a little book open he had his
[1:00:34] hand a little book open he sent his
[1:00:36] right foot upon the sea his left foot on
[1:00:39] the earth we talked about that how that
[1:00:41] one Beast would come out of the sea one
[1:00:43] Beast would come out of the earth you
[1:00:44] remember
[1:00:45] and he'd put his right foot on Hollywood
[1:00:47] if we could say it that way but his left
[1:00:49] foot on on uh on denominational systems
[1:00:52] he he stood there and put his feet
[1:00:54] showing he had Authority
[1:00:57] oh my don't tell me you can't live this
[1:00:59] message this message was there's an
[1:01:01] authority come in our hour that an
[1:01:03] anointing that's coming our hour that
[1:01:05] allows us to live it
[1:01:07] lets us live it so he puts his right
[1:01:09] foot on the on the land he's left foot
[1:01:11] on the sheer vice versa however it was
[1:01:12] and and now when he stands down there
[1:01:15] his right foot on the feet his left foot
[1:01:17] on the earth and he cried with a loud
[1:01:18] voice
[1:01:20] that's when a lion roarth when he'd
[1:01:23] cried seven Thunders uttered their
[1:01:24] voices
[1:01:25] when the seven Thunders had uttered
[1:01:27] their voices I was about to write I
[1:01:30] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[1:01:32] fill up those things which the seven
[1:01:34] Thunders uttered right them not and the
[1:01:37] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[1:01:39] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[1:01:40] heaven and swear by him to liveth
[1:01:42] Forever and Ever who created heaven and
[1:01:44] the things that there in our and the
[1:01:46] earth and the things that they're in our
[1:01:47] and the Sea and the things which are
[1:01:49] there that there should be time no
[1:01:51] longer
[1:01:52] if you go look in the original list no
[1:01:53] more delay
[1:01:55] right time no longer
[1:01:58] oh I'm glad I live in that hour
[1:02:01] because what that means is
[1:02:04] ahead of myself now what it means is
[1:02:06] that the promises are available today
[1:02:12] I'm not waiting on him to tell me what
[1:02:14] he will do
[1:02:16] are you with me now
[1:02:19] I can have my healing because he's
[1:02:20] already told me
[1:02:22] that's been revealed to me I can have
[1:02:24] the salvation of my children because he
[1:02:26] already told me
[1:02:27] I can have a Rapture because he already
[1:02:29] told me
[1:02:30] it's already been revealed I'm not
[1:02:32] waiting on somebody else to come and
[1:02:34] reveal it to me oh do you realize what
[1:02:35] God did for us with the message of the
[1:02:37] hour he said you can you I will I will I
[1:02:39] will and he did it
[1:02:42] right
[1:02:43] Hallelujah
[1:02:45] now so we can we can take advantage of
[1:02:47] those promises today now look he said
[1:02:49] and they swear by him that liveth
[1:02:50] forever and ever time will be no longer
[1:02:53] now
[1:02:54] but verse 7 . this is familiar isn't it
[1:02:58] in the days of The Voice
[1:03:00] of the seventh angel
[1:03:02] when he shall begin to sound
[1:03:04] so he's saying seal up these things
[1:03:07] seal them up don't tell nobody
[1:03:10] don't don't write it down
[1:03:13] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:03:15] seventh angel
[1:03:16] when he shall begin to sound brother
[1:03:18] says when he starts on his ministry
[1:03:21] right he said it's real Menace he's not
[1:03:22] not at the beginning he said but when he
[1:03:24] starts on his ministry he said when he
[1:03:26] should begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:03:28] should be finished yes
[1:03:31] yes so there's both an opening and
[1:03:33] closing and I'll show that to you in a
[1:03:34] moment the book is open but it's also
[1:03:37] complete or closed
[1:03:38] in the sense that in the sense that is
[1:03:41] complete yeah
[1:03:42] yeah Hallelujah
[1:03:44] no more promises to be written
[1:03:48] no more Mysteries
[1:03:52] that we need to know to get out of here
[1:03:57] right your life will adjusting what
[1:03:58] confidence that gives us as Believers in
[1:04:00] this message
[1:04:01] that whatever God wanted to tell me
[1:04:04] whatever he said he would do he said I
[1:04:06] will bring you out I will do this I will
[1:04:07] do that whatever he wanted to tell me he
[1:04:09] told me
[1:04:11] by the voice of the seventh angel
[1:04:13] Revelation 10 7 The Mystery of God would
[1:04:16] be finished that means I can't add to it
[1:04:18] somebody else can't add to it that means
[1:04:20] your favorite preacher won't add to it
[1:04:22] now there won't be another person to say
[1:04:23] well we're going to change it do it this
[1:04:25] way now whatever that Prophet said it's
[1:04:27] the promise that we have
[1:04:29] this message is not a drudgery it's not
[1:04:32] a bondage it's not a it's not some kind
[1:04:34] of do's and don'ts or a list of do's and
[1:04:36] don'ts but it's a reality of the Living
[1:04:37] Word of God living inside of us it's the
[1:04:41] very presence of God himself
[1:04:43] I'm not what I am I've told you this
[1:04:45] before I'm not what I am I don't do what
[1:04:47] I do in spite of the message I do what I
[1:04:49] do because of the message my family is
[1:04:52] safe because of the message
[1:04:54] our church is what it is because of the
[1:04:57] message
[1:04:59] yes sir
[1:05:01] nobody tell you that the message doesn't
[1:05:03] work no more
[1:05:04] or you need some man to come and add
[1:05:07] another promise
[1:05:10] you just need to see what's there
[1:05:15] you just need to turn on the lights
[1:05:17] yeah the brown said it was like a like a
[1:05:19] supermarket or we'd call it today like a
[1:05:21] Walmart he calls it an arcade but it's a
[1:05:24] place where you go in and you look in
[1:05:26] you you flip on the light and you look
[1:05:28] around her stuff all over the place
[1:05:30] everything in it's yours
[1:05:32] do we can't we really see that today up
[1:05:35] on this shelf is healing it's yours on
[1:05:37] this shelf is peace it's yours on this
[1:05:39] shelf is is an absence of strife in your
[1:05:41] home that's yours
[1:05:43] on this shelf is your children that's
[1:05:45] yours
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:50] joy in the in the house of God that's
[1:05:52] yours
[1:05:54] whatever he said that's why we don't
[1:05:55] want to change it we don't want to make
[1:05:57] it different because what it means so
[1:05:58] much to us
[1:06:00] it's ours and so we just look around
[1:06:02] take it down
[1:06:03] we just take it down now
[1:06:05] and and we begin to manifest it now
[1:06:09] there's no more delay
[1:06:11] when the mystery of God is finished as
[1:06:12] it declared to a Servants of prophets
[1:06:14] there's now no more delay no more
[1:06:17] mystery everything that God said he
[1:06:19] would do
[1:06:20] now watch he has done
[1:06:23] in seed form
[1:06:27] no more seeds to be planted
[1:06:31] God help us today I'm talking about word
[1:06:33] seeds at the end time Martin Luther
[1:06:35] there had to be a certain thing it was
[1:06:37] cultivated and planted in his age a
[1:06:39] certain thing it was cultivated and
[1:06:40] planted in West these days in the
[1:06:41] Pentecostals at the end time but finally
[1:06:44] the last seeds came up
[1:06:47] there were Brides churches churches
[1:06:49] Brides brides
[1:06:51] right but there's got to come one
[1:06:54] he said well brother Ben where is it
[1:06:56] you're it
[1:06:59] yeah it's got to be us
[1:07:03] oh God help us today
[1:07:06] see everything that God said he would do
[1:07:09] is done so we're waiting on the maturity
[1:07:10] and that's why brother random said if
[1:07:12] you go back to what we've preached
[1:07:13] Wednesday night he said patience
[1:07:14] patience he said you preachers listen to
[1:07:17] me
[1:07:18] right have patience don't try to force
[1:07:21] something that God didn't say
[1:07:23] you see why it's so important why did I
[1:07:25] why do I come preach even about the
[1:07:26] gifts and things why what will the
[1:07:28] writers to do because we want to make
[1:07:30] sure that we stay with the message of
[1:07:32] the hour because that's our that's our
[1:07:33] food that's what was stored up for
[1:07:35] that's what we live on that's what makes
[1:07:37] us alive that's what makes it anytime we
[1:07:39] begin even if it looks like we need to
[1:07:41] do it yeah
[1:07:42] we don't want to get off what a prophet
[1:07:44] said because when we get away from what
[1:07:46] a prophet said what we're doing is we're
[1:07:48] actually cutting ourselves off from the
[1:07:49] life
[1:07:50] the life is in the word
[1:07:54] that's good
[1:07:56] amen but now watch in the days of the
[1:07:58] voice all these things will be finished
[1:08:00] so now now it's complete now there's uh
[1:08:04] I hope I can get this across you this
[1:08:06] morning now there's a bride on the Earth
[1:08:09] brother random called it an infant bride
[1:08:11] yes yes which will manifest Every Word
[1:08:14] of Promise of the New Testament yeah
[1:08:16] as a mature bride yeah
[1:08:19] yeah right so now brother Brown's
[1:08:21] thinking about that promise of the New
[1:08:22] Testament I may not have time to get to
[1:08:23] all this this morning
[1:08:25] but he said it's just the New Testament
[1:08:27] that's all
[1:08:28] he said he fulfilled the Old Testament
[1:08:29] now it's the New Testament another piece
[1:08:32] to be fulfilled he said see the new and
[1:08:34] oldest husband and wife
[1:08:37] I like that the groom fulfilled the old
[1:08:40] and the bride will fulfill the new yes
[1:08:43] watch it taken the old to foreshow the
[1:08:46] new Christ come the Masterpiece to
[1:08:49] fulfill that
[1:08:50] now his bride someone say his bride
[1:08:54] now his bride will fulfill everything
[1:08:57] that's in the New Testament
[1:09:00] amen hallelujah another Masterpiece is
[1:09:04] in making yeah
[1:09:08] but you know why people can't see it's a
[1:09:10] masterpiece because it's the chip off
[1:09:14] think about this for a minute what did
[1:09:16] Brother random teach us about the bride
[1:09:18] he said Michelangelo built a masterpiece
[1:09:20] and he was so inspired by that he hit it
[1:09:22] with a hammer
[1:09:24] right he chipped off a piece of it and
[1:09:27] the bride is that ship
[1:09:30] that's what he taught us
[1:09:33] so the bride can we say it this way is
[1:09:36] seen as the flaw
[1:09:41] s oh my but brother rather said that's
[1:09:43] what makes it a masterpiece
[1:09:46] he was wounded he said no man that's why
[1:09:48] he was bruised for our iniquity well
[1:09:51] it's seen as weakness in Christ is
[1:09:53] actually the very thing that makes us
[1:09:55] strong
[1:09:57] don't you see it you can't see well I
[1:09:59] could never be the bride I could never
[1:10:00] come up to what you're preaching I could
[1:10:02] never do those things but can you can't
[1:10:04] you see that the very fact that you are
[1:10:06] weak God needed something that was weak
[1:10:08] that's why he created man to begin with
[1:10:10] he needed something that was weak so he
[1:10:12] could put he had that flaw had to be
[1:10:14] there it's what made the Masterpiece but
[1:10:16] he said Michelangelo couldn't pick up
[1:10:18] that piece and make it part of the whole
[1:10:20] again but Christ picked up the piece and
[1:10:22] put it back in its place
[1:10:28] served
[1:10:31] I'm gonna have to calm down a little bit
[1:10:33] get through this
[1:10:36] foreign
[1:10:38] I started to say I'm getting too old and
[1:10:40] I looked over there by the bill no I'm
[1:10:41] not
[1:10:45] getting too fat that's what it is
[1:10:50] you're a masterpiece not when I watch
[1:10:53] but how do you know you might ask that
[1:10:56] question how do I know that I'm his
[1:10:57] bride
[1:10:58] how do I know I
[1:11:01] people tell me oh you're the bride well
[1:11:04] how do I know
[1:11:06] brother Brandon says this he said you
[1:11:07] are known
[1:11:09] when Jesus Christ lives in you
[1:11:12] by his life and the promised word of
[1:11:15] this day reflects itself
[1:11:19] yes sir I love that
[1:11:21] he said now the same word that was
[1:11:23] reflected in Moses could not be
[1:11:25] reflected in Elijah because that was
[1:11:27] another day the same one that was
[1:11:29] reflected Noah could not be in Moses
[1:11:31] because say Noah built an ark Moses say
[1:11:33] to people that's exactly what was
[1:11:35] promised the same light was reflected in
[1:11:37] one wasn't in the other but one told of
[1:11:39] the other one
[1:11:40] all the New Testament speaks of this
[1:11:43] hour
[1:11:44] do we believe that today Jesus Christ
[1:11:47] speaks of this hour
[1:11:49] he said who is it then some man
[1:11:53] oh God who is it some man it's Jesus
[1:11:56] Christ the son of God manifesting
[1:11:59] reflecting the light on the word that he
[1:12:02] promised for this day
[1:12:04] he said when man see you living like him
[1:12:06] when he sees your character and your
[1:12:08] conduct with the word just exactly like
[1:12:11] he was the word being manifested then
[1:12:13] man will see Jesus Christ
[1:12:16] they won't have to look around anywhere
[1:12:18] else and say what does this Creed teach
[1:12:20] what does that Creed teach they'll know
[1:12:22] what God is
[1:12:23] when they see you
[1:12:26] why you've been brought back
[1:12:29] you've been brought back to the
[1:12:30] Masterpiece the the flaw has been
[1:12:33] restored see God didn't call us to leave
[1:12:35] us out in the world and leave us in sin
[1:12:37] we were there one day all of us were he
[1:12:40] said such were some of you but God did
[1:12:42] not call us to leave us there
[1:12:44] he called some from the very lowest of
[1:12:46] the low but he didn't call you to leave
[1:12:48] you there he called you to bring you out
[1:12:51] and restore you back to the masterpiece
[1:12:55] they'll know what God is when they see
[1:12:58] you
[1:12:59] so you manifest you and I manifest the
[1:13:03] fullness of the book
[1:13:06] Hallelujah
[1:13:07] do you see why the seals were so
[1:13:10] important in the message
[1:13:12] because it's the opening of those seals
[1:13:14] of the word
[1:13:16] that tells us who we are
[1:13:19] and it doesn't tell us by saying Stuart
[1:13:21] Duckworth is a preacher at the end time
[1:13:23] the seals don't say that but what they
[1:13:25] do is identify brother Stewart's
[1:13:26] character in the word yeah
[1:13:29] what a bride would be doing
[1:13:33] and our name is there
[1:13:36] and so when we look at that we see what
[1:13:38] God's done in our life we begin to see
[1:13:40] Mama that's me
[1:13:44] so the message of the Seven Seals now
[1:13:47] watch brother Bible says something
[1:13:48] interesting he's here he says in their
[1:13:50] closing I referenced it a minute ago in
[1:13:52] their closing
[1:13:53] so the book was open but in a sense it
[1:13:56] was closed because the message was
[1:13:58] finished
[1:13:59] does that make sense
[1:14:01] the book is open but we're not writing
[1:14:03] new chapters
[1:14:05] that makes sense
[1:14:07] no he said the seventh seals closes the
[1:14:10] New Testament
[1:14:13] oh my
[1:14:14] God sealed it up
[1:14:17] don't you see what that means
[1:14:19] somebody can't bring to you something
[1:14:21] outside of the New Testament
[1:14:23] if there was a New Testament Church
[1:14:25] that's the way this church has to be yes
[1:14:27] because if it's something outside of the
[1:14:28] New Testament it's not what it's not
[1:14:30] what a prophet said it's not what the
[1:14:31] Bible says
[1:14:33] right it would have to be wrong because
[1:14:35] the book has been sealed and closed up
[1:14:40] the Revelation is complete
[1:14:42] now your Revelation may not be complete
[1:14:45] you're not pure I'm not to my full level
[1:14:47] of maturity yet you're not fearful level
[1:14:48] of maturity yet but you you gain
[1:14:50] Revelation but it's Revelation that's
[1:14:52] already in the book
[1:14:54] are you with me now
[1:14:57] so
[1:14:58] the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals he
[1:15:02] says I hope I'm not boring you this
[1:15:04] morning
[1:15:04] he said when these Seven Seals was open
[1:15:07] that opened up the entire Bible
[1:15:10] the Seven Seals it was still with seven
[1:15:12] mysteries in those Seven Seals held the
[1:15:14] entire mystery of it and it was the book
[1:15:17] of redemption
[1:15:19] New Testament I watch these are not the
[1:15:22] old it only proclaimed for the New
[1:15:23] Testament
[1:15:24] he said they cannot be made perfect
[1:15:26] without us
[1:15:27] so now having the Old Testament revealed
[1:15:30] in Christ the New Testament revealed by
[1:15:32] the message of the hour which you're
[1:15:35] going to find out in a minute what what
[1:15:36] that is right that's in flesh
[1:15:39] right God didn't just send us a message
[1:15:45] how to put this and make it clear God
[1:15:47] didn't just sent us a message of voice
[1:15:50] he sent us a man
[1:15:53] that makes sense
[1:15:55] he didn't just send us a voice
[1:15:57] he sent a man William Branham
[1:16:01] there's a reason why he sent a man
[1:16:03] because God was going to manifest in
[1:16:05] that man and show the sign of the son of
[1:16:08] man
[1:16:10] Jehovah was going to live in that man
[1:16:12] yeah
[1:16:15] yeah and I'm not but the thing is we
[1:16:18] don't want to limit it to that we want
[1:16:19] to say all the brothers said about that
[1:16:21] because he told us it wouldn't be just
[1:16:23] limited to that now we won't show the
[1:16:24] sign of the son of man because him being
[1:16:26] a part of the Bride that's already been
[1:16:27] shown
[1:16:29] right we don't have to show that against
[1:16:30] once to a generation what are we shall
[1:16:33] we we fulfill our part of the body
[1:16:35] whatever our part of the body is we
[1:16:37] fulfill that in our hour
[1:16:39] right he already fulfilled his part
[1:16:41] we're fulfilling our part but he did not
[1:16:43] call just a voice he called a man
[1:16:45] and the man that God called manifested
[1:16:49] it wasn't he didn't just tell us
[1:16:52] but he actually lived it
[1:16:57] you see why he we see why his whole life
[1:17:00] and things that the things that he did
[1:17:02] it was so mysterious to people because
[1:17:04] God was allowing a man to come to that
[1:17:07] maturity
[1:17:08] somebody had to come to that maturity he
[1:17:11] was allowing a man to come to that
[1:17:12] maturity where he could speak to the
[1:17:14] storm yeah he could speak to uh he could
[1:17:16] speak to the to the cancer yeah
[1:17:19] but then he he gave us a clue of what's
[1:17:21] coming because what does he do he goes
[1:17:23] in to have he writes house and had he
[1:17:25] writes speaks
[1:17:27] because she here oh my she hears the
[1:17:29] word and he's telling her what was
[1:17:31] manifested in his life and she said it's
[1:17:33] nothing but the truth
[1:17:36] right you see what I'm saying
[1:17:39] so we don't just spend all our time
[1:17:40] glorifying that man but what do we do
[1:17:42] God make me fulfill my part
[1:17:47] right
[1:17:50] now
[1:17:52] the Mysteries within the Seven Seals
[1:17:54] when the Seven Seals often opened up the
[1:17:56] entire Bible it was the book of
[1:17:57] redemption New Testament they could not
[1:17:58] be made perfect without us so what that
[1:18:00] means is we are now subject to every
[1:18:02] promise someone say every promise
[1:18:04] of the word
[1:18:06] now
[1:18:07] he said God's only provided plan for his
[1:18:10] age his sons in the word age quickened
[1:18:13] by the spirit
[1:18:15] like a spark
[1:18:17] this is a living thing
[1:18:20] not some dead cold formal Creed
[1:18:23] but a living God his sons in the word
[1:18:26] age quickened by the spirit like a spark
[1:18:28] that's lit off of something to make it
[1:18:30] alive
[1:18:32] and seated now in Heavenly places in
[1:18:34] present tense
[1:18:36] already alive
[1:18:39] Hallelujah and subject to every promise
[1:18:43] in the world
[1:18:45] then what does that do you being a part
[1:18:48] of God's Gene a part of the word other
[1:18:50] men a part of God's word seated together
[1:18:53] manifest the entire body of Christ
[1:18:55] because there's no leaven among you
[1:18:57] you're manifesting but see we miss it
[1:19:00] because what does God do whatever the
[1:19:01] man preach before the opening of the
[1:19:02] seals God hiding himself in Simplicity
[1:19:05] and revealing himself in the same you
[1:19:07] realize that by doing what you do and
[1:19:10] when I come out I just had my mind on
[1:19:11] this message but I meant to say
[1:19:13] something about kids days yesterday and
[1:19:14] how much we appreciated what was done
[1:19:17] there and we appreciate the Sunday
[1:19:18] School teachers for doing that sister
[1:19:19] Rebecca and sister Sophie and all the
[1:19:21] helpers because what you're doing you
[1:19:24] don't realize what you're doing you're
[1:19:26] fulfilling a part
[1:19:28] yeah
[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] you realize you are the revelation of
[1:19:33] the word made flesh for those kids
[1:19:40] god with skin on it
[1:19:42] and by fulfilling your part in doing
[1:19:45] what God in Godly order in a church that
[1:19:48] God has set up a way for us to have
[1:19:50] church and I'm glad that he did I'm glad
[1:19:52] he didn't leave it to my idea your idea
[1:19:54] he said a place for us to have church a
[1:19:56] way for us to do these things and and so
[1:19:58] when he set that up then we have it uh
[1:20:01] here all we have to do is fill our part
[1:20:03] the play's already been written yeah
[1:20:06] I don't have to go rewrite it I don't
[1:20:07] have to go but I'm an actor in the play
[1:20:09] Oh My and I'm stepping into my part and
[1:20:12] if that part's taking care of the young
[1:20:13] people taking care of the children let
[1:20:15] me do that with all of my heart
[1:20:19] so we're thankful we're thankful for
[1:20:20] deacons and trustees and people because
[1:20:21] you don't realize what you're doing yeah
[1:20:23] I'm thankful for people like brother
[1:20:25] Harold I'll pick on him that just come
[1:20:27] and sit in the service
[1:20:29] but I I Harold I see him on the screen
[1:20:31] because of where he sits don't move
[1:20:33] brother Harold but
[1:20:34] I see that white head sitting back there
[1:20:37] and every time I'm blessed
[1:20:41] because I
[1:20:43] I know my own weaknesses
[1:20:45] I'm aware that I'm a man
[1:20:48] I'm aware that we these things we have
[1:20:51] are so precious because they could all
[1:20:52] fall apart in a minute but Danny
[1:20:55] we realize that people could get hurt
[1:20:57] but when I see a faithful person a
[1:20:59] faithful member of the body of Christ
[1:21:00] may not do anything else but just sit in
[1:21:03] the presence of God but when they come
[1:21:04] to the house of God on Wednesday night
[1:21:06] and Sunday morning and Sunday night and
[1:21:07] Wednesday night and Sunday morning and
[1:21:08] Sunday night and I see them there but
[1:21:10] her that inspires me it says be faithful
[1:21:13] in your part but the Herald's doing his
[1:21:15] part you go do your part
[1:21:17] are you with me now
[1:21:19] they've done their part oh God let me do
[1:21:22] my part some of you have filled your
[1:21:24] part you've been manifesting the word
[1:21:26] for 40 50 years let me do my part today
[1:21:29] there's a part for me
[1:21:32] let me fulfill it
[1:21:35] let me be an encouragement to somebody
[1:21:37] else
[1:21:40] eternal life is living for others
[1:21:42] how could we ever do away with the body
[1:21:45] of God's people
[1:21:47] when all of eternal life is living for
[1:21:49] others and that's what we do here that's
[1:21:51] why we have church
[1:21:57] you don't this church
[1:21:59] does not and should not exist to support
[1:22:01] my lifestyle
[1:22:05] should not exist solely
[1:22:07] to have a place for people to be deacons
[1:22:10] or a place for people to be trustees or
[1:22:12] a place for people to be song leaders it
[1:22:14] does not exist for our egos
[1:22:16] it does not exist to Pat us on the back
[1:22:19] but this church exists because the Bride
[1:22:22] of Jesus Christ are worthy of being of
[1:22:25] having a preacher they're worthy of
[1:22:27] feeling the presence of God they're
[1:22:29] worthy brother said if I had a drop of
[1:22:30] blood and a charger he said he wouldn't
[1:22:32] mean as much as the body of Christ he
[1:22:34] said because you're the purchase of that
[1:22:36] blood
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:38] we don't come here together to to build
[1:22:41] each other as egos up we come here
[1:22:42] together because we're the body of Jesus
[1:22:45] Christ and somebody's got to preach
[1:22:47] somebody's got to think somebody's got
[1:22:49] to work
[1:22:51] that's right so we can sit in Heavenly
[1:22:53] places in Christ
[1:22:57] seated together manifest the entire body
[1:22:59] of Christ there's no leaven among you
[1:23:01] that's the age we're living in there was
[1:23:03] always leaven
[1:23:05] there was listen there was always leaven
[1:23:08] until the time to go home
[1:23:10] but in this hour the the shuck is being
[1:23:14] separated from the wheat
[1:23:16] there's always leaven until the end time
[1:23:20] and at the end time a prophet of God
[1:23:22] declared there's no leaven among you
[1:23:23] right
[1:23:25] just the word only seated in Heavenly
[1:23:27] places in the door where he puts his
[1:23:30] name Christ Jesus
[1:23:32] then you might ask me brother Ben
[1:23:34] if I'm subject to all of God's promises
[1:23:37] for today
[1:23:38] why do I struggle for my healing
[1:23:41] why is it difficult to go to church
[1:23:44] somebody said amen
[1:23:47] why do I struggle with besetting sin
[1:23:50] somebody said oh me
[1:23:55] brother Ben you know we're message
[1:23:57] Believers we don't
[1:24:00] we do
[1:24:04] why do we struggle with thoughts
[1:24:06] sometimes we can't control
[1:24:08] why do we struggle with the settings and
[1:24:10] why do we struggle with disobedience
[1:24:13] sometimes a disobedient nature
[1:24:16] why do I have trouble in my home with
[1:24:17] the benefit if this is how if this is
[1:24:19] who I am or what I'm subject to why do I
[1:24:21] have trouble
[1:24:23] the children of Israel might have
[1:24:24] thought the same thing
[1:24:26] and it they got they dwelled on it so
[1:24:28] much
[1:24:29] that they could not hearken to what
[1:24:31] Moses was saying yeah
[1:24:33] when he began to preach and then
[1:24:35] promises they couldn't see it they just
[1:24:38] couldn't grab a hold of it
[1:24:39] the gap between what they were hearing
[1:24:41] and what they were seeing caused them to
[1:24:43] be disillusioned you ever heard that
[1:24:45] word disillusioned I thought of that
[1:24:47] when I thought of these people in in
[1:24:49] Exodus 6 they were disillusioned with
[1:24:52] the prophet and the message
[1:24:54] to be disillusioned needs to be
[1:24:56] disappointed in someone or something
[1:24:58] that one discovers to be less good than
[1:25:01] one had believed
[1:25:03] now he's not any less good
[1:25:06] right than what we believed
[1:25:09] but it looks like it
[1:25:12] yeah so we're disillusioned because
[1:25:14] maybe we had in our minds an illusion to
[1:25:17] begin with to be disillusioned means to
[1:25:19] have the illusion taken away
[1:25:21] and maybe we had an illusion in our mind
[1:25:23] to begin with that everything would be
[1:25:24] easy and and because we're in the
[1:25:27] message that everything would work just
[1:25:28] like it's supposed to and that's not
[1:25:30] what happens at all
[1:25:33] right everything sometimes falls apart
[1:25:34] sometimes everything falls apart
[1:25:37] though both those statements are true
[1:25:40] everything we're human beings
[1:25:43] we live in a condition even though in
[1:25:47] one sense we've come into the promised
[1:25:48] land we're living in the land where all
[1:25:49] the promises lay in another sense we're
[1:25:51] still in the bondage of Flesh
[1:25:54] so both of those types can hold true
[1:25:57] and so now
[1:25:59] the the the dictionary Again State said
[1:26:02] disillusionment is having lost faith or
[1:26:04] trust in something formally regarded as
[1:26:07] good or valuable
[1:26:10] why people don't go to church anymore
[1:26:11] you want to know the real reason
[1:26:17] they lost trust in its value
[1:26:21] and when when a prophet of God very
[1:26:24] clearly tells you to do something and
[1:26:27] you don't do it anymore
[1:26:28] what is why you've lost some amount of
[1:26:31] trust in the prophet of God right
[1:26:34] listen to me church just because you say
[1:26:38] you believe the message
[1:26:39] doesn't mean you live it
[1:26:45] yeah there was a gap
[1:26:47] here was Moses right in front of him God
[1:26:49] veiled himself in Moses
[1:26:52] stood in front of them walked in front
[1:26:54] of them and they said
[1:26:56] they said we don't we can't
[1:26:59] Moses we we believe you're a prophet but
[1:27:02] we just can't grab a hold
[1:27:04] of these promises because of these
[1:27:07] situations
[1:27:09] right
[1:27:10] so someone I said well my job keeps me
[1:27:13] from it my my my uh my marriage my
[1:27:17] relationship is my you don't understand
[1:27:19] I'm I'm sick in my body but don't you
[1:27:22] realize that that promise is for your
[1:27:24] healing yeah
[1:27:26] don't you realize that promises for your
[1:27:28] finances don't you don't mind it's all
[1:27:31] included this is not the hour of a
[1:27:33] partial fulfillment this is not the hour
[1:27:35] of a partial problem but every promise
[1:27:37] in the book is is wrapped up in the
[1:27:41] bride
[1:27:42] every promise of God
[1:27:46] so you in other words like this becoming
[1:27:48] disillusioned people become
[1:27:49] disillusioned with the message even
[1:27:51] though they would fight you
[1:27:53] over you if you said you did not you
[1:27:55] don't believe the message anymore
[1:27:58] but what do they do they lost the value
[1:28:00] of what he was saying yeah
[1:28:02] yeah what he was telling them
[1:28:04] lost faith or trust
[1:28:06] people lose Faith or trust in Preachers
[1:28:07] yeah
[1:28:09] yeah and so it just becomes white noise
[1:28:12] and I know I realize that only so much
[1:28:15] of what I say gets through the veil
[1:28:18] because everything has to pass through
[1:28:20] my veil in your Veil flesh
[1:28:24] right
[1:28:25] so only so much gets out because it's my
[1:28:28] veil and I don't always do things right
[1:28:31] all right
[1:28:32] so you look at you look at me and say
[1:28:34] brother Ben especially if you've known
[1:28:35] me a long time but then I I
[1:28:38] saw you one time and you you were you
[1:28:41] you know you you snapped at your
[1:28:43] children
[1:28:44] you snapped at your wife you did
[1:28:45] something that see that's a veil of
[1:28:47] Flesh
[1:28:48] they don't make it right
[1:28:51] it's wrong I have to repent of those
[1:28:52] things just like you do
[1:28:54] but you see what happens because of that
[1:28:56] Veil that word that I preach has to pass
[1:28:58] through that yeah
[1:28:59] yeah and it has to pass through your
[1:29:01] Veil and so I realized that only so much
[1:29:03] gets through and that's why we just keep
[1:29:05] repeating it keep repeating it keep
[1:29:07] repeating we keep coming back you keep
[1:29:08] hearing I'm the bride I'm the bride I'm
[1:29:10] the bride wow it passes through my veil
[1:29:12] it passes through your Veil but that's
[1:29:13] the way God intended for it to happen
[1:29:15] and eventually one day you find yourself
[1:29:17] when you tell yourself over and over
[1:29:19] it's a it's a it's a faith it's up here
[1:29:21] as we talked about a couple weeks ago
[1:29:22] this and talking with some of the
[1:29:24] brothers there's an intellectual Faith
[1:29:25] it's got to be an intellectual Faith
[1:29:27] before it be can become a subconscious
[1:29:29] faith
[1:29:30] and so you you say I believe it I
[1:29:31] believe it I believe it but one day it
[1:29:33] drops in It Gets behind the veil brother
[1:29:36] said if we could if we could only press
[1:29:38] through the veil of the flesh he said we
[1:29:39] would see Angels at their positions at
[1:29:42] every pew
[1:29:43] why because and the promise is not the
[1:29:46] Angels would would come in a certain
[1:29:48] building the promises that the Angels
[1:29:50] would have Camp around those that feared
[1:29:52] the Lord
[1:29:55] he said we see Angels at every pew
[1:30:01] the message isn't what I thought it was
[1:30:03] some might say
[1:30:05] going to church hasn't helped me like I
[1:30:07] thought it would
[1:30:09] living as a Christian is much harder
[1:30:12] than I thought it would be some of you
[1:30:13] young people are going to have to face
[1:30:14] that one day because right now
[1:30:16] if you don't have the Holy Ghost mom and
[1:30:18] dad is going to be it
[1:30:20] right they're they're going
[1:30:23] but you listen to your kids listen to me
[1:30:25] for a minute they're coming you got to
[1:30:27] decide there's coming today that you've
[1:30:28] got to you've got to believe the message
[1:30:30] for yourself
[1:30:33] you've got to understand even our
[1:30:36] children understand way more than we
[1:30:37] think they do
[1:30:39] but you got I believe that the book is
[1:30:41] open I believe that that a prophet of
[1:30:44] God came I believe that the message of
[1:30:45] the hour is true I believe
[1:30:48] listen I was I was the age of Landon
[1:30:53] when I first started
[1:30:56] I was preaching at your age well anybody
[1:30:59] but I was I don't say it to intimidate
[1:31:01] you I didn't know what I was talking
[1:31:02] about
[1:31:05] but I was his age
[1:31:07] when I begin to dig into the message
[1:31:09] for myself
[1:31:11] and I got a hold of a church age book
[1:31:13] because we didn't have computers back
[1:31:14] then
[1:31:16] Peter when he was young one time I
[1:31:18] started wearing glasses and uh he was
[1:31:21] talking to me you know he was riding
[1:31:22] home from church one day and he said
[1:31:23] yeah he said he said I guess could you
[1:31:25] didn't wear glasses before because I
[1:31:27] started wearing glasses when I was 30.
[1:31:28] he said I guess you or somewhere at 27
[1:31:30] or 30 something like that he said I
[1:31:32] guess you didn't wear glasses before
[1:31:33] because they didn't have them when you
[1:31:34] were young
[1:31:40] they had glasses
[1:31:43] but what we didn't have was the message
[1:31:44] on the computer
[1:31:48] y'all remember or if they did it was
[1:31:50] that one person that could afford that
[1:31:51] high-priced computer to download all
[1:31:53] that stuff because it had to be the
[1:31:54] Gateway 2000 or whatever that it was and
[1:31:57] it cost like six thousand dollars you
[1:31:59] had to download all the folio views and
[1:32:01] everything you had to know how to use
[1:32:02] dos and all those I remember when I
[1:32:04] first started preaching out and I went
[1:32:05] to a church and they had that and I sat
[1:32:07] there just printing quotes man I could
[1:32:08] look them up and print them I was so
[1:32:10] happy
[1:32:12] look them up and pretty had to type a
[1:32:13] command to print the quotes
[1:32:16] and that's what we had to do but what
[1:32:18] was it I was that age when I began to
[1:32:19] just because you're young it doesn't
[1:32:21] mean that you can't hear that you can't
[1:32:24] feed that you can't Know Who You Are
[1:32:26] amen you can know who you are you may
[1:32:29] not have all the ins and outs figured
[1:32:30] out but you can know I'm a Believer
[1:32:34] son I'm
[1:32:35] of God do you believe that today you can
[1:32:37] know that God has been merciful to my
[1:32:39] family he's loved us he's kept us he's
[1:32:42] brought us out I want to serve him with
[1:32:44] all of my heart
[1:32:47] so he can fulfill himself even in a
[1:32:50] child you can manifest the word for your
[1:32:52] day yeah
[1:32:55] now see I want us to think about this
[1:32:58] for a minute we get disillusioned
[1:32:59] because people are human don't we
[1:33:01] isn't that mainly the reason
[1:33:04] why people don't believe in Preachers
[1:33:06] right
[1:33:07] that's right well preachers make
[1:33:08] mistakes they're human yes sir that's
[1:33:10] right
[1:33:11] but they don't make the message any less
[1:33:14] right
[1:33:16] Randall said of a Catholic priest
[1:33:17] preached the word he said I'd say Amen
[1:33:19] to it
[1:33:21] all right yeah
[1:33:22] look
[1:33:23] why wasn't God
[1:33:26] disillusioned when Adam fell have you
[1:33:29] ever thought about that
[1:33:31] and God that's sitting in heaven if we
[1:33:33] could say it that way God's sitting up
[1:33:34] there with Jason he's sitting up there
[1:33:36] and he goes he uh looks down there he
[1:33:39] says oh
[1:33:40] oh you wouldn't believe what Adam and
[1:33:41] Eve have done
[1:33:43] oh my they they made such a mess of
[1:33:45] things made such a mess of things
[1:33:47] they're just they're just uh oh my oh
[1:33:50] they've disobeyed the word I'm so
[1:33:52] disappointed
[1:33:53] oh I I'm so disappointed you know he was
[1:33:56] disappointed
[1:33:57] he was saddened
[1:34:00] he was even angered if we could put it
[1:34:03] in human emotions
[1:34:05] but he already knew it was going to
[1:34:06] happen
[1:34:08] so he was not disillusioned
[1:34:11] because God understood something that we
[1:34:13] don't understand
[1:34:15] see when you're disillusioned you quit
[1:34:18] because you're disillusioned
[1:34:20] the church let me down so I'll quit
[1:34:24] Wednesday nights on what they thought
[1:34:25] I'd be so I'll quit going on Wednesday
[1:34:26] nights
[1:34:28] it'll be better if you were there that
[1:34:30] part's free
[1:34:33] church is what I thought it would be so
[1:34:35] I'll just
[1:34:36] I just pull back
[1:34:38] I thought that reading the Bible every
[1:34:40] day would just would make everything
[1:34:42] right and I find myself falling asleep
[1:34:44] trying to read
[1:34:46] so I'll just quit I'm disillusioned see
[1:34:48] but that's that's not what God did right
[1:34:50] oh my when Adam messed up when he messed
[1:34:54] up what did God do
[1:34:56] he already had a way provided
[1:34:58] for them to come back
[1:35:01] so he was not disillusioned
[1:35:04] Hallelujah listen God wasn't
[1:35:06] disillusioned with you when you fell
[1:35:09] when something happened in your life
[1:35:10] when you made mistakes when you were a
[1:35:12] sinner he was not disillusioned he knew
[1:35:15] who you were before he ever made you he
[1:35:17] knew what you would do but he loved you
[1:35:19] anyway
[1:35:22] aren't you grateful for that today he
[1:35:25] was not disillusioned by my stubbornness
[1:35:27] by my stupidity
[1:35:30] but he loved me anyway
[1:35:33] you already knew that I was human
[1:35:35] there's the key
[1:35:37] he made us human
[1:35:39] see why people get disillusioned with
[1:35:41] the message they get disillusion with
[1:35:42] preachers they don't understand the
[1:35:44] human element
[1:35:46] he made he made us weak on purpose
[1:35:50] in fact his attributes could not be
[1:35:52] fulfilled in Adam and Eve unless they
[1:35:54] were flesh
[1:35:57] could fall
[1:36:00] see the Bible says in Psalms 103 8 the
[1:36:02] Lord is merciful and gracious are you
[1:36:04] still with me this morning just a few
[1:36:06] more minutes
[1:36:07] the Lord is merciful and gracious slow
[1:36:09] to anger I'm so glad that he is
[1:36:11] plenteous in Mercy he will not always
[1:36:14] chide neither will he keep his anger
[1:36:16] forever he hath not dealt with us after
[1:36:19] our sins
[1:36:20] I can't read that without some emotion
[1:36:22] coming up in my heart and my voice I
[1:36:25] can't read that because I know that if
[1:36:26] he dealt with me after my sins I
[1:36:28] wouldn't be here brother Paul I could
[1:36:30] not live if he dealt with me after my
[1:36:32] sin
[1:36:33] he's not dealt with us after our sins
[1:36:35] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:36:37] iniquities
[1:36:38] for as the heaven is high above the
[1:36:41] Earth so great is his Mercy toward them
[1:36:43] that fear Him
[1:36:45] as far as the East is from the West so
[1:36:48] far hath he removed our transgressions
[1:36:51] from us like as a father pityth his
[1:36:54] children so the Lord pityth them that
[1:36:56] fear Him for he knoweth our frame
[1:37:01] he remembers that we are dust and do us
[1:37:04] some good to remember that the preacher
[1:37:06] is human the deacons are human the
[1:37:08] people are human
[1:37:09] the prophet was a human
[1:37:16] the reason the Jews could not see God's
[1:37:18] promise being fulfilled in Christ
[1:37:20] they could not see past the Dust
[1:37:24] you know what our job in life is
[1:37:26] basically if you want to look at it one
[1:37:28] way is to minimize the cloud of dust
[1:37:30] around us
[1:37:32] I'm going to make an obscure pop culture
[1:37:34] reference
[1:37:36] just warning
[1:37:39] you remember Big Ben how many members
[1:37:42] the the character pig pen on peanuts
[1:37:44] some of you are brave enough to raise
[1:37:46] your hands nothing wrong with peanuts
[1:37:49] the character pigpen remember I think
[1:37:51] that was his name pigpen he wandered
[1:37:53] around everywhere he went through was
[1:37:54] just a cloud of dust
[1:37:56] and Charlie Brown tells him he said
[1:37:58] you're the only person I know that could
[1:38:00] take a bath and come out dirtier than
[1:38:01] you were
[1:38:04] he just said just a cloud of dust around
[1:38:05] him you realize what we do is we got a
[1:38:08] sticky nature we got a cloud of dust
[1:38:11] my job as a preacher to try to let the
[1:38:15] Holy Spirit of the reign of the Holy
[1:38:16] Ghost settle that dust as much as
[1:38:19] possible so that you can see Christ
[1:38:21] Living in me our job as Christians is to
[1:38:24] let the rain the water the spirit flow
[1:38:27] over us the washing of the water of the
[1:38:28] word flew over us too to settle the Dust
[1:38:32] but he said he remembers that we're dust
[1:38:34] I'm so glad for the Joe that he does
[1:38:37] he knows our frame
[1:38:42] amen John 6 41 says the Jews murmured at
[1:38:45] him because he said I'm the bread which
[1:38:46] came down from heaven and they said is
[1:38:48] not this Jesus
[1:38:50] the son of Joseph whose father and
[1:38:53] mother we know we know his dust
[1:38:57] how is it then that he saith I came down
[1:38:59] from heaven
[1:39:00] he could not see it because he became a
[1:39:02] son of man
[1:39:04] we find out here that God has always he
[1:39:06] said had skin on him when Moses seen him
[1:39:08] he had skin on him look like a man God
[1:39:10] was behind the curtains he had skin on
[1:39:11] him and God tonight in his church is
[1:39:14] failed in his church with skin on it
[1:39:18] still the same God tonight
[1:39:20] but now as ever the skin fails what
[1:39:22] catches the Traditions they just can't
[1:39:25] believe that is god making them people
[1:39:27] act like that it's because God has
[1:39:29] failed in his church in skin skin on it
[1:39:32] that's right he is hid from the
[1:39:33] unbeliever and revealed to the believer
[1:39:36] why could they not see the message of
[1:39:37] the hour because God sent it in a man he
[1:39:40] sent it through a man
[1:39:41] ifested through a man why can they not
[1:39:44] believe the move is on for the bride
[1:39:45] because it's through men and women
[1:39:49] huh
[1:39:53] when their tradition veiled traditions
[1:39:54] of the elders and the word is broke
[1:39:56] through of course they then comes in
[1:39:57] plain view we see him deity again failed
[1:40:01] in human flesh
[1:40:03] you say well that's easy for me to see
[1:40:04] and brother Branham but brother Branham
[1:40:06] was dust too
[1:40:08] he was just too just like we're dust
[1:40:12] man was born of a woman in a few days
[1:40:14] and full of trouble he was dust but yet
[1:40:17] he so subjected himself to the spirit of
[1:40:19] God that he become more than just a
[1:40:22] prophet or something like that but he
[1:40:23] become the first amen something that
[1:40:26] could be waived over the people Christ
[1:40:27] the word was waived in him but the
[1:40:29] Branham himself is not the wave sheep
[1:40:31] but it's Christ in the bread in that
[1:40:33] flesh
[1:40:35] can we see that can we separate it it's
[1:40:37] hard
[1:40:38] he was not a God but he was God in flesh
[1:40:41] you are not God but your God in flesh
[1:40:46] and he had a certain work he had to do
[1:40:48] and you have a certain work you have to
[1:40:49] do he said Hebrews 1 said so also
[1:40:52] Genesis 18 you remember God was a man
[1:40:54] sitting there eating talking with
[1:40:55] Abraham told what Sarah was doing and
[1:40:56] sent behind it and Jesus said as it was
[1:40:59] in the days of Sodom so shall it be at
[1:41:01] the coming of the son of man deity
[1:41:02] veiled again in human flesh
[1:41:04] he said now remember Jesus didn't say
[1:41:06] when the Son of God is being revealed
[1:41:09] because they might have recognized it as
[1:41:11] the son of God
[1:41:12] but they could oh my they could not
[1:41:14] recognize him as the son of man
[1:41:17] now watch he said when the son of man is
[1:41:19] being revealed the son of man back in
[1:41:20] the church again revealed in human
[1:41:22] beings not Son of God but to son of man
[1:41:24] again back in his church again in the
[1:41:26] last days we find out that he promised
[1:41:28] that in God's promises
[1:41:30] that's the promise for today
[1:41:35] I hope you hear me now the son of man
[1:41:36] fulfilled or manifested the sign of the
[1:41:38] son of man manifested by a prophet
[1:41:40] that's already been done
[1:41:42] right that don't have to happen that's
[1:41:44] already happened we're living in a late
[1:41:45] hour
[1:41:47] we're living in the time after
[1:41:49] the one came to Abraham and told him
[1:41:51] this is Sarah your wife's in the tent
[1:41:54] behind you
[1:41:55] your name won't be Sarah Sarah he'll be
[1:41:57] Sarah and she's in the tempting how did
[1:41:59] she laughed but you know in a year
[1:42:01] you're going to have a promise a
[1:42:02] promised son we're living in the time
[1:42:04] we're waiting on the on the Fulfillment
[1:42:06] of it
[1:42:07] of the Rapture the fullness of the
[1:42:09] rapture
[1:42:10] but now watch
[1:42:12] there's no way I can get through this
[1:42:13] I've gotta I've got to stop I'm gonna
[1:42:14] find a place
[1:42:15] now look
[1:42:17] brother brother we believe we're living
[1:42:18] in the hour that when God is doing
[1:42:20] something how many believe that today
[1:42:22] he said we believe we're living among
[1:42:24] them now
[1:42:25] I believe tonight I'm preaching to that
[1:42:27] congregation that's laying waiting out
[1:42:30] there just to get right
[1:42:31] I really believe that with all my heart
[1:42:33] I would say it's the same now as it's
[1:42:34] always been he said now we believe that
[1:42:36] the Hours come that Saint John 14 12
[1:42:38] must be fulfilled we believe that
[1:42:39] Malachi 4 must be fulfilled we believe
[1:42:41] that Luke 17 30 must be fulfilled we
[1:42:44] believe that all these prophecies he
[1:42:45] said would come to pass this day we
[1:42:46] believe they must be fulfilled and we
[1:42:48] believe we're seeing them fulfilled
[1:42:49] right now
[1:42:54] brother Brandon you go look it up let's
[1:42:57] if you go we talk about Revelation 10
[1:42:59] Mighty Angel you said when will that be
[1:43:01] fulfilled well the Brandon said was
[1:43:03] already fulfilled
[1:43:05] go look it up in uh in what is the
[1:43:08] attraction on the mountain he said three
[1:43:09] years ago is prophecy now it's history
[1:43:11] yes
[1:43:13] yes what is the attraction on the
[1:43:14] mountain God fulfilling his word
[1:43:17] oh my
[1:43:19] sir now look
[1:43:20] what is God's promise for today to as is
[1:43:23] for a bride to fulfill the New Testament
[1:43:25] Promises of God yeah
[1:43:27] so there's to be a spiritual bride
[1:43:29] raised up there'll be the Royal seat of
[1:43:30] the royal faith and Abraham's royal son
[1:43:32] she has to come on the scene in the last
[1:43:33] days and the time and the place is a
[1:43:36] promise that's given to her
[1:43:39] but see the devil doesn't believe that
[1:43:41] you are her
[1:43:45] right well you know but he didn't
[1:43:47] believe that he was him and he does not
[1:43:49] believe that you were her
[1:43:51] so the devil gets us disillusioned by
[1:43:53] pointing to human weakness many times he
[1:43:56] doesn't attack the word directly but he
[1:43:58] attacks the body of the word which is
[1:44:00] the church the bride
[1:44:03] right how many people have I seen leave
[1:44:05] the message I've told you this before
[1:44:06] but they end up leaving the message
[1:44:08] forsaking a prophet forsaking the
[1:44:10] message altogether but it started
[1:44:12] because they got a root of bitterness
[1:44:13] against a member of the body yeah
[1:44:16] yeah and they end almost every case
[1:44:18] they have a root of bitterness against
[1:44:20] some preacher or something that happened
[1:44:21] or the way the people treated them and
[1:44:23] they end up leaving the message all
[1:44:24] together you said that could never
[1:44:26] happen to me you better get that root of
[1:44:27] bitterness out of your heart
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:30] right so-and-so didn't treat me right
[1:44:32] so-and-so didn't forgive me when they
[1:44:33] should have forgave me so I'm so messed
[1:44:35] up and they shouldn't have messed up
[1:44:36] well that's the truth but you better get
[1:44:37] rid of that
[1:44:39] because Satan's trying to use that to
[1:44:41] get you disillusioned with the body and
[1:44:43] if he can get you disillusioned with the
[1:44:45] body eventually you'll get you
[1:44:46] disillusioned with the word itself
[1:44:50] even tries to point to our own flesh
[1:44:52] give us disillusioned with ourselves
[1:44:55] but the brown said he knew the word was
[1:44:58] for that hour but he doubted this humble
[1:45:01] little man
[1:45:02] being that word
[1:45:04] Matthew 4 and 1 Jesus was led up to the
[1:45:07] spirit of the Wilderness to be tempted
[1:45:08] of the devil when he had fasted 40 days
[1:45:10] and 40 nights he was afterward 100
[1:45:12] hungered and when and when I don't know
[1:45:15] how to say that hungered or hungered and
[1:45:18] when the tempter came to him he said if
[1:45:19] thou be the Son of God command that
[1:45:22] these Stones be made bread
[1:45:24] now he knew he was the son of man a son
[1:45:27] of man but he said if you're the son of
[1:45:29] God
[1:45:31] right he had a hard time seeing he was
[1:45:33] the son of God because he was the son of
[1:45:35] man
[1:45:36] God hid himself in the womb of a virgin
[1:45:39] Oh Glory
[1:45:41] and Satan couldn't see if that for sure
[1:45:42] if that was him or not
[1:45:44] so
[1:45:45] he might come to you and he might tell
[1:45:47] you the same thing well if you were
[1:45:48] really the Bride of Jesus Christ why do
[1:45:50] you struggle financially
[1:45:53] oh he's never talked to you like that
[1:45:57] huh
[1:45:58] if you were really the bride why'd you
[1:45:59] lose that job
[1:46:01] if you're really the bride why'd you
[1:46:02] lose your car
[1:46:04] if you really the bride why'd your house
[1:46:06] get foreclosed on
[1:46:07] well praise God
[1:46:10] he said well God and he'll point you to
[1:46:12] scripture
[1:46:13] it points you the message says you're
[1:46:15] supposed to be blessed
[1:46:17] but you live in a body of Flesh you make
[1:46:18] mistakes
[1:46:20] so do I yeah
[1:46:23] yeah but Jesus answered him correctly
[1:46:24] Jesus didn't make any mistakes
[1:46:27] but still the flesh kept Satan from
[1:46:30] seeing who he was but Jesus knew who he
[1:46:32] was
[1:46:32] so he doesn't answer through the flesh
[1:46:35] but he answers by the word he answered
[1:46:37] and said it is written man shall not
[1:46:38] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:46:40] that precedes out of the mouth of God
[1:46:42] the next time the devil tries to tell
[1:46:44] you you're a sorry no count you can't
[1:46:45] even keep a job you can't do this out of
[1:46:47] the other you just look back at the
[1:46:49] Devil and tell him man shall not live by
[1:46:51] bread alone
[1:46:52] he said if you were the Son of God why
[1:46:54] would you be hungry if you were the Son
[1:46:56] of God why do you struggle don't you see
[1:46:57] he's doing the same thing today because
[1:47:00] he can't see the veil of flesh but look
[1:47:01] back at him and say I believe the word
[1:47:03] regardless man won't live by bread alone
[1:47:05] I'm going to keep going to church I'm
[1:47:07] going to keep living for God I'm gonna
[1:47:08] keep doing what's right even if it's a
[1:47:10] struggle I'm gonna do it
[1:47:13] because man will not live by bread alone
[1:47:17] you never said it would be easy
[1:47:19] you took him to Pinnacle of the temple I
[1:47:21] just kind of heard through this so we
[1:47:23] can get done took him the Pinnacle of
[1:47:24] the temple said if you I'll be the Son
[1:47:25] of God cast myself down
[1:47:28] in other words if you're the word made
[1:47:30] flesh
[1:47:31] why do you struggle
[1:47:33] why are you tempted
[1:47:35] Jesus was tempted in all like points
[1:47:37] like we are yet without sin
[1:47:42] why didn't he just keep you from
[1:47:43] mistakes
[1:47:46] so he says
[1:47:48] if you're the word
[1:47:50] quit trying to live it quit trying to go
[1:47:53] to church just let yourself fall
[1:47:55] from the Pinnacle of the Temple
[1:47:58] because if you're really the word you'll
[1:47:59] survive
[1:48:02] realize that's a devil talking to you
[1:48:06] if you're really the bride you can do
[1:48:08] without the church
[1:48:10] you don't have to come to church you
[1:48:11] don't have to do what a prophet said
[1:48:13] you can do without you can do without
[1:48:14] those things you you can wear those
[1:48:16] pants you can if you're really the bride
[1:48:17] he'll catch you
[1:48:19] see what Satan was doing yeah
[1:48:23] he was trying to tempt him he said be
[1:48:25] any of you scripture he'll give his
[1:48:27] angels charge concerning thee why why
[1:48:29] don't you know you're predestined he
[1:48:31] won't let you fall
[1:48:33] but Jesus said it is written again
[1:48:35] thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:48:39] he tries to tell you to quit church he
[1:48:41] tries to tell you to quit on quit on him
[1:48:43] quit on the message you just say thou
[1:48:45] shall not tempt the Lord thy God website
[1:48:47] thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God
[1:48:48] because God's inside of me I can speak
[1:48:51] the word too
[1:48:55] stay well there's nothing for you to do
[1:48:57] just let yourself fall there is a part
[1:48:59] for you to play
[1:49:01] because brother Brown says he knows if
[1:49:03] the people gets the true revelation of
[1:49:04] the true church and what she is what she
[1:49:06] stands for and she can do the greater
[1:49:08] work she will be an invincible Army she
[1:49:11] will have to fight but she cannot be
[1:49:12] overcome or you listening to me today no
[1:49:14] man can stand before even the promise of
[1:49:17] the Rapture is already something that's
[1:49:18] in her
[1:49:19] Hallelujah the shout is the message and
[1:49:22] you become the message what does that
[1:49:23] make you makes you a part of the rapture
[1:49:27] brother Brandon said here you are
[1:49:28] tonight after 1900 years he's speaking
[1:49:30] of Christ he's praying he said you're
[1:49:32] just as much alive tonight as you was
[1:49:33] when you talk to the woman at the well
[1:49:35] it's God manifested in flesh now in the
[1:49:37] flesh of his bride for the bride and the
[1:49:40] husband of the same self-flash these two
[1:49:42] are one and the church is becoming the
[1:49:44] bride all the time by believing the word
[1:49:46] so that the word in the church becomes
[1:49:48] the same the word in the church making
[1:49:50] it the bride
[1:49:51] the last time God identifying himself
[1:49:54] the word are you hearing me this morning
[1:49:55] the word in the church
[1:49:58] so the Rapture begins in your flesh I'm
[1:50:00] afraid I'll miss it you can't miss it if
[1:50:02] you're already on the ride
[1:50:06] never stood in line for a roller coaster
[1:50:09] and I want to raise your hand
[1:50:13] then they start putting in people
[1:50:15] thank you miles they put them people
[1:50:17] up in front of you
[1:50:19] and you know the fast pass people they
[1:50:22] bring you up in front of you they just
[1:50:24] get to go and you're like
[1:50:25] I'm gonna miss this because this thing
[1:50:26] shuts down every 15 minutes you know
[1:50:29] or there's a thunderstorm coming and
[1:50:31] they're going to shut it down for
[1:50:31] lightning you know I'm gonna miss it I'm
[1:50:33] still in line see if you're still in
[1:50:34] line you could miss it
[1:50:36] but once you get on
[1:50:38] yeah and that thing starts to roll
[1:50:45] you're moving now going back then
[1:50:49] on a ride one time a girl decided she
[1:50:51] didn't like it she just got off
[1:50:53] it got offside they'd shut the whole
[1:50:55] thing down but my boat went through
[1:50:59] it was already in the water oh Church
[1:51:02] you just realized if you're a part of
[1:51:04] the bride of Christ you're already in
[1:51:05] the water you're already on your way
[1:51:07] you're already on the track
[1:51:09] the devil can't stop you if he wants to
[1:51:14] God's promise for today behold I show
[1:51:16] you a mystery we shall not all sleep but
[1:51:18] we shall all be changed in a moment in
[1:51:19] the twinkling but not the last Trump the
[1:51:21] trumpet shall sound the dead shall be
[1:51:23] raised Incorruptible we shall be changed
[1:51:25] God's promise for today Romans 8 11 it's
[1:51:28] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:51:29] from the dead blood these are new
[1:51:30] testament promises it's the spirit that
[1:51:33] raised up Jesus from the dead wasn't you
[1:51:34] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:51:36] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:51:38] his spirit that dwells in you
[1:51:40] Brother Bear talks about all these
[1:51:41] things Divine Healing the power of God
[1:51:42] all these other things is in every
[1:51:44] individual in here let's proceed The
[1:51:45] Bachelor of the Holy Ghost you're
[1:51:46] planted in Christ the Holy Ghost baptism
[1:51:49] yes sir everything you have neither for
[1:51:51] this life's journey even the Rapture is
[1:51:52] right in you then
[1:51:54] he said don't resent that that's the
[1:51:55] truth
[1:51:56] the Rapture is in us now how improve it
[1:51:58] by the gospel those who he called he
[1:51:59] justified those who he justified he's
[1:52:01] glorified those in heaven today were
[1:52:03] glorified in the presence of God right
[1:52:05] now
[1:52:06] and today we're glorifying the presence
[1:52:07] of God right now I'm just pushing out to
[1:52:09] it
[1:52:10] he said all you have to do is drink like
[1:52:11] a tree and you just you just push out
[1:52:13] the fruit push out the leaves but you
[1:52:16] just have to drink
[1:52:18] you're planted by a river of water drink
[1:52:21] amen
[1:52:23] don't be
[1:52:24] dissolution but your musicians go ahead
[1:52:26] and come
[1:52:28] don't be disillusioned by your own
[1:52:30] weakness
[1:52:38] I'm typing these things this week
[1:52:41] this is about the fourth version of it I
[1:52:43] went through
[1:52:44] it's been about 10 hours back in this
[1:52:45] office on Friday something like that
[1:52:48] just
[1:52:49] frustrated
[1:52:50] because I was down on myself
[1:52:54] it must have been does that happen to
[1:52:55] you because I'm human
[1:52:58] I got down on myself and I'm sitting in
[1:53:00] the office that's why God calls me in
[1:53:03] because it gives us something don't you
[1:53:04] love what brother Brandon would tell
[1:53:05] people be honest with the people and
[1:53:06] tell them this is what I went through
[1:53:07] yeah
[1:53:08] yeah I'm just being honest with you this
[1:53:11] is one of the hardest weeks of my life
[1:53:12] and there was no reason for it just just
[1:53:15] my old mind
[1:53:17] this won't leave me alone
[1:53:20] y'all experience times like that
[1:53:23] yeah I got done with Wednesday night
[1:53:24] preaching I preach hard sometimes when
[1:53:25] you preach hard you get under a
[1:53:26] different anointing and it's just like
[1:53:28] you you come out of that and you get in
[1:53:30] the moly grubs just no other way but the
[1:53:31] ram calls it on Monday he said you want
[1:53:33] to kick the cat and
[1:53:34] and we don't kick the cat but you want
[1:53:36] to and
[1:53:37] that's just
[1:53:39] not good
[1:53:40] that way Friday but I'm typing these
[1:53:42] things
[1:53:43] just while I'm being disillusioned by my
[1:53:46] own weakness
[1:53:48] if I was a real man of God I'd do better
[1:53:51] than this
[1:53:52] but I read this
[1:53:54] this is one of God's New Testament
[1:53:56] promises for today if you're struggling
[1:53:58] today I want you to hear this
[1:54:00] he said unto me because Paul struggled
[1:54:04] he didn't understand he said I got this
[1:54:06] Thorn In the Flesh and three times I've
[1:54:07] asked you to take it away from me
[1:54:10] he said unto me my grace
[1:54:13] is sufficient
[1:54:15] for thee
[1:54:17] he said brother Ben did that just wake
[1:54:18] you up and set you on fire right away no
[1:54:20] I need to go home and sleep first
[1:54:23] I needed to go through another day but
[1:54:25] then eventually it hits you or you were
[1:54:27] this is your promise
[1:54:29] I I may go through a valley but I'm
[1:54:31] coming out on the mountain
[1:54:33] I may have some hard times but I've
[1:54:35] already been strapped in I'm already in
[1:54:37] the ride I'm going home
[1:54:41] people may doubt me preachers May doubt
[1:54:43] me the church might doubt me you can say
[1:54:45] the same thing today people might doubt
[1:54:48] that you can do what God called you to
[1:54:49] do but he said my grace is sufficient
[1:54:51] for thee
[1:54:54] my strength is made perfect
[1:54:57] and weakness
[1:54:59] most gladly therefore will I rather
[1:55:02] glory in my infirmities he said if I'm
[1:55:04] going to brag about something I'm going
[1:55:05] to brag about that time that I got
[1:55:07] beaten until I was almost dead that's
[1:55:09] what Paul says if I'm going to brag
[1:55:11] about something I'm gonna brag about the
[1:55:12] times I got thrown in prison if I'm
[1:55:14] gonna brag about something see they
[1:55:15] couldn't see Brother David what was
[1:55:17] going on behind the scenes while he was
[1:55:18] in a prison house the people said his
[1:55:20] ministry is washed up he don't even have
[1:55:22] two coats he had to send for his other
[1:55:23] coach all his friends forsook him they
[1:55:25] didn't understand that the New Testament
[1:55:27] promises that we live by today we're
[1:55:30] being written while he was in prison
[1:55:33] and they could not see it because of the
[1:55:35] weakness of the flesh but he said my
[1:55:36] strength is made perfect in weakness
[1:55:39] most gladly therefore will I glory in my
[1:55:41] infirmities
[1:55:42] that the power of Christ
[1:55:45] May rest
[1:55:47] upon me
[1:55:49] I'll say this this morning
[1:55:51] if the New Testament promises were
[1:55:54] written in weakness
[1:55:55] and yet
[1:55:57] they were the promises of God that are
[1:56:00] the absolute that we rest our soul on
[1:56:04] revealed in this hour by a Prophet by
[1:56:07] the opening of the word
[1:56:09] if they could be written in weakness
[1:56:12] if they could be revealed by a prophet
[1:56:13] who was a man
[1:56:16] in weakness
[1:56:18] couldn't they be manifested the same way
[1:56:26] and you think nothing's going on
[1:56:27] nothing's happening and all the time the
[1:56:29] Rapture all the Clockwork everything's
[1:56:31] moving just the way it should be what
[1:56:33] did we say Wednesday night I read that
[1:56:34] to you three nights in a row right
[1:56:36] before brother Branham died he told the
[1:56:38] people he said everything nothing is out
[1:56:41] of cater
[1:56:42] he uses those words three times
[1:56:44] in a row the Rapture things that are to
