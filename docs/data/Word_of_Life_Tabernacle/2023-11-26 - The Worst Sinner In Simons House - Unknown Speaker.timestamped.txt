[48:08] 36 I want to speak to you this morning
[48:10] on the worst sinner in Simon's house I
[48:13] know I've approached this subject many
[48:14] times but it just was was pressed on me
[48:19] today to preach this and I just I just
[48:22] want to ask the Lord to help me today
[48:24] Luke 7:36 one of the Pharisees desired
[48:27] him that he would eat with him and he
[48:29] went into the Pharisees house and sat
[48:31] down to
[48:32] meet Behold a woman in the city which
[48:35] was a sinner when she knew that Jesus
[48:37] said at meat in the Pharisees house
[48:39] brought an alabaster box of ointment and
[48:43] stood At His Feet behind him weeping and
[48:45] began to wash his feet with tears and
[48:48] did wipe them with the hairs of her head
[48:51] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[48:52] with the ointment now when the Pharisee
[48:55] would which had bidden him saw it he
[48:57] spake within himself saying this man if
[49:00] he were a prophet would have known who
[49:02] and what manner of woman this is that
[49:05] toucheth him she is a sinner and Jesus
[49:09] answering said unto him Simon I have
[49:11] somewhat to say unto thee he saith
[49:14] Master say on there was a certain
[49:16] creditor which had two debtors the one
[49:18] owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when
[49:22] they had nothing to pay he frankly
[49:24] forgave them both
[49:26] tell me therefore which of them will
[49:28] love him most Simon answered and said I
[49:31] suppose that he to whom he forgave most
[49:33] he said unto him thou Hast rightly
[49:35] judged he turned to the woman and said
[49:37] unto Simon seest thou this woman I
[49:40] entered into thine house thou gavest me
[49:43] no water for my feet but she hath washed
[49:45] my feet with tears and wiped them with
[49:48] the hairs of her head thou gavest me no
[49:51] kiss but this woman since the time I
[49:52] came in ha not ceased to kiss my feet my
[49:56] head with oil thou D not anoint but this
[49:58] woman hath anointed my feet with
[50:00] ointment wherefore I say unto thee her
[50:03] sins which are many are forgiven for she
[50:06] loveth much she loved much but to whom
[50:10] little is Forgiven the same loveth
[50:11] little he said unto her thy sins are
[50:14] forgiven oh my they that said at meat
[50:17] with him began to say within themselves
[50:19] who is this that forgiveth sins also he
[50:21] said to the woman thy faith has saved
[50:24] thee go in peace
[50:26] amen pray the Lord would add his
[50:27] Blessing to the word you may be
[50:30] seated we've heard brother brandham
[50:32] dramatize this story many times and
[50:34] tapes like meanest man in Santa Maria
[50:37] meanest man in town the worst sinner in
[50:39] the city Pride Jesus keeps all his
[50:45] appointments many many times he preached
[50:48] we're familiar with how the the flunky
[50:51] came to Jesus to invite him to the party
[50:55] that Pharisee was going to have how that
[50:58] Pharisee had bad intentions in bringing
[51:00] Jesus to the party to the dinner but
[51:03] Jesus still came because he comes where
[51:06] he's invited aren't you glad of that
[51:08] today and brother Brandon puts it this
[51:10] way he said you asked him to come you
[51:13] invited him to come he said then worship
[51:15] him when he comes oh I'm so glad for
[51:18] that today I I think about last Sunday
[51:20] night's service how the presence of the
[51:22] Lord was so real and and I thought you
[51:24] know I I don't I don't have to run and
[51:26] jump and Shout every service but I Want
[51:29] to Be Free when I feel his presence to
[51:31] worship Him according to the way that he
[51:33] moves on me to worship and I want that
[51:36] freedom to be able to do that I want to
[51:38] be able to love him with all of my heart
[51:40] I I don't want any reservations I I
[51:42] don't want there to be anything that
[51:44] would hold me back from worshiping god
[51:46] with everything that's in
[51:48] me and he was invited so he showed up
[51:51] and when when he showed up to the to the
[51:53] party that he didn't get his feet washed
[51:56] he he didn't get his his head Anointed
[51:59] with oil they they didn't as they would
[52:01] normally do in that country he he they
[52:04] didn't do that for him they actually
[52:06] neglected him and he came anyway and he
[52:09] sat in the corner of the building
[52:11] brother B said he was in the corner of
[52:13] the church in the back corner of the
[52:16] church and he sat there with unwashed
[52:18] feet and he sat there with the dirt of
[52:21] the road and and the things people have
[52:23] been saying about him and all of those
[52:25] things he sat there with that on him and
[52:27] and yet he he he he was able to stay
[52:30] there and in the corner because there
[52:33] was somebody that he was reaching for
[52:35] there was a reason why he was there yeah
[52:38] and the Pharisees went on about their
[52:40] business and and their dinner but there
[52:42] was a little woman who who who had been
[52:44] a prostitute and she'd been someone who
[52:47] all of her life was so messed up that
[52:49] there there was no help for her so it
[52:51] seemed and and yet she'd been in the
[52:53] meeting she'd heard what he said and and
[52:56] she knew what kind of a man that he was
[52:58] she believed that he was the Messiah and
[53:02] so she comes down and she she smells the
[53:05] dinner cooking and she comes down to the
[53:07] place where he is a and she sees him
[53:10] there with brother Danel with unwashed
[53:13] feet and and when she saw him in that
[53:16] condition she brother Harold did just
[53:18] something inside of her she said I've
[53:20] got to get in there and wash his feet I
[53:24] can't leave him in that situation have
[53:26] you ever felt like that you you there
[53:28] might be Hypocrites in the church there
[53:30] there might be people that don't like
[53:32] you there might be all kinds of
[53:33] situations going on but if you could
[53:35] ever get to the place where he is and
[53:38] where his presence is it makes you want
[53:39] to go to the house of God because you
[53:41] know the word's going to be there and
[53:43] he's sitting there and they call him all
[53:45] kinds of names they say this message is
[53:47] a cult they say it's some kind of a a
[53:50] thing that should be done away with but
[53:52] for me it's life for me he is the word
[53:54] for for me he's the same yesterday today
[53:57] and forever let me go where he is let me
[54:00] wash his feet let me be identified with
[54:03] message Believers let me be identified
[54:05] with those who love this message who
[54:08] believe this message who cry out to him
[54:11] let me be identified though they call us
[54:13] Pentecostal Holy Roller or everything
[54:15] else though they call us some kind of a
[54:17] some kind of a name let me be identified
[54:19] with those who believe him who love him
[54:21] with all of their
[54:23] heart oh my
[54:25] good and so she she presses her way
[54:30] through the crowd through all the
[54:33] distractions and disappointments she
[54:35] presses her way through so she can get
[54:39] to Jesus that's what you have to do this
[54:42] morning that's what I have to do to be
[54:44] able to worship him the way we want to
[54:46] the way he wants us
[54:48] to he said there he never moved as she
[54:50] pressed her way
[54:52] through and there just something about
[54:55] about being next to Jesus brother Joel
[54:57] that you just can't act the way you
[54:59] normally do right so she probably made
[55:02] up in her mind I'm not going to make a
[55:03] scene I'm not going to do that but when
[55:07] she got close to
[55:08] him she just couldn't help it she had
[55:12] bought this alabaster box of ointment
[55:14] she spent all the money she had to go
[55:17] and and take this ointment and anointing
[55:19] because he hadn't been anointed when he
[55:21] went in Simon's house so she bought this
[55:24] Alabaster her box full of ointment and
[55:26] she's brought it up there to anoint him
[55:28] and she just can't help it she she just
[55:30] begins to weep as he's sitting there as
[55:31] they would with the his feet behind him
[55:33] and and and she's behind him she's
[55:35] trying to not make a scene but she just
[55:37] begins to weep and and as she begins to
[55:40] Weep the the tears the hot tears fell on
[55:42] his feet I'm sure he felt it but he
[55:45] didn't move because if he' done moved
[55:46] brother brand said she'd have gone up
[55:48] and left but he didn't move he stayed
[55:50] right there and she's s she's there and
[55:53] weeping and as she's weeping it drops on
[55:55] the grime and things on his feet and and
[55:58] she begins to she begins to uh take her
[56:01] took her hair was up and she it fell
[56:03] down and she began to wipe her his feet
[56:05] with her hair and she broke the
[56:07] alabaster box of ointment and anointed
[56:09] him with oil and she's standing there
[56:11] weeping by his side I want you to keep
[56:14] that picture in your mind as we in go
[56:18] into the sermon this
[56:20] morning I want I want to just freeze
[56:22] that in your mind for a moment look
[56:25] around the
[56:26] room who have we got in the
[56:29] room we've
[56:31] got Simon Pharisee Dr Pharisees as
[56:36] brother random calls him yeah we got all
[56:38] the Pharisees the the highest of that
[56:41] day Jesus himself is there we know that
[56:45] Judas is
[56:48] there we know that his disciples are
[56:51] there somewhere around
[56:53] yeah they're all there I want to ask you
[56:57] this
[56:58] morning who is the worst
[57:02] sinner in Simon's
[57:05] house now think about it for a minute
[57:08] who is the worst sinner in Simon's house
[57:12] I'll say this everyone in Simon's house
[57:15] except for Jesus was a
[57:20] sinner everyone in Simon's house except
[57:24] for Jesus was a sinner but who was the
[57:27] worst sinner in Simon's
[57:31] house think about it now as we go on
[57:33] into the
[57:35] sermon in Genesis 6:5 God saw that the
[57:38] wickedness of man was great in the earth
[57:41] that every imagination of the thoughts
[57:44] of his heart was only evil continually
[57:47] it's a striking
[57:49] phrase and and it sounds like today
[57:51] doesn't it and it repented the Lord that
[57:54] he had made man on the earth and it
[57:56] grieved him at his heart and the Lord
[57:58] said I will destroy man whom I have
[58:00] created from the face of the Earth both
[58:03] man and Beast and the creeping thing and
[58:05] the fowls of the air for repented me
[58:08] that repenteth me that I have made them
[58:11] but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the
[58:15] Lord oh in a time of leay of seea in a
[58:17] time of of utter Darkness I want my name
[58:20] to be in
[58:21] there but but but Benjamin found Grace
[58:24] in the eyes of the Lord but brother Joel
[58:26] found Grace in the whatever your name is
[58:29] put it there you found Grace in the eyes
[58:32] of the Lord now we know that the Bible
[58:34] goes on to tell us that Noah was a just
[58:36] man and perfect in his time yes did Noah
[58:40] find Grace because he was a just man or
[58:43] was he a just man because he found
[58:45] Grace brother the brandom answers the
[58:47] question for us he said the grace of God
[58:49] reached over in Noah's time Noah just an
[58:52] ordinary man he and his family but
[58:54] because Noah feared God he believed God
[58:56] he said you can't fear God without
[58:58] believing yes he said when then when the
[59:00] fear of God Came Upon Noah God called
[59:02] him by grace and saved him in his house
[59:05] because it was Grace that did it he said
[59:08] not because Noah was a great big
[59:10] handsomer man than all the rest of them
[59:12] he said not because Noah went to the
[59:14] best Church there was in the country you
[59:16] won't find Grace in the eyes of the Lord
[59:18] because you go to Word of Life
[59:20] Tabernacle though I think we're the best
[59:22] church around I I believe that but you
[59:24] won't find Grace cuz you come here to
[59:25] church you don't come find Grace because
[59:27] you say you believe a prophet you don't
[59:29] find Grace Because of Who You fellowship
[59:31] with or who your name is you find Grace
[59:34] because God chose you and he chose to
[59:36] bestow Grace on you and he put in you
[59:39] the fear of the
[59:40] Lord
[59:43] good not because Noah was a great big
[59:45] hands man not because he went to the
[59:46] best Church there was in the country not
[59:48] because he belonged to the best in
[59:49] organization not because he could dress
[59:51] better not because he had more money not
[59:54] because he was some special person but
[59:56] because of the grace of God God saved
[59:58] Noah Grace saved Noah not his works but
[1:00:01] his grace and also saved his
[1:00:05] family Paul the Apostle put it this way
[1:00:08] he said but by the grace of God I am
[1:00:10] what I am by the grace of God I can be
[1:00:14] perfect in my Generations or I can walk
[1:00:16] as a mature Christian if we could put it
[1:00:18] that way I can be what God calls me to
[1:00:21] be I don't have to live in sin I don't
[1:00:22] have to remain in the condition I was in
[1:00:25] by the grace of God I can live it I know
[1:00:27] sometimes you struggle and you think
[1:00:29] well for me there's no way I can live
[1:00:31] the word it just it's just too hard it's
[1:00:33] too much for me but I'm here to tell you
[1:00:35] this morning you can live it or he
[1:00:37] wouldn't have given it to us in the
[1:00:38] first place you can do the right thing
[1:00:41] you can I want to encourage you in that
[1:00:43] today you said but I don't see a way but
[1:00:45] he has provided a way you just do the
[1:00:48] right thing let God do the
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:52] rest good you just keep walking you keep
[1:00:54] coming to the house of God you keep
[1:00:56] loving him with all your heart you just
[1:00:58] keep moving forward you can do what God
[1:01:00] said you can do you can be a Christian
[1:01:02] in
[1:01:07] Le but he said said it was bestowed on
[1:01:10] me his grace was not in vain I labored
[1:01:13] more abundantly than they all yet not I
[1:01:16] but the grace of God which was with me
[1:01:19] oh he said even my labor wasn't because
[1:01:21] of me it was by
[1:01:23] grace now brother brandom talks about
[1:01:25] Sin he said we say sin we just call it
[1:01:27] sin break it down what is sin remember
[1:01:30] we're talking about the worst sinner in
[1:01:31] Simon's house a lot of people say
[1:01:33] drinking committing adultery no no
[1:01:36] that's the attributes of sin see that's
[1:01:37] what sin causes real Sin is unbelief
[1:01:41] that's where it's named and called out
[1:01:42] if you are a Believer you don't do those
[1:01:44] things no matter how holy you try to
[1:01:46] make yourself and how religious you try
[1:01:47] to be if you do those things you're an
[1:01:49] unbeliever that's scriptural listen to
[1:01:52] John 3:16 and we'll read it and
[1:01:54] sometimes people neglect to read on he
[1:01:56] said for God so loved the world aren't
[1:01:59] you glad he did he gave his only
[1:02:01] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:02:03] him should not perish but have
[1:02:05] everlasting life for God sent not his
[1:02:08] son into the world to condemn the world
[1:02:10] but that the world through him might be
[1:02:11] saved he that believeth on him is not
[1:02:15] condemned are you a Believer today he
[1:02:18] that believeth on him is not condemned
[1:02:20] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:02:22] already because he hath not believed in
[1:02:24] the name of the only begotten Son of God
[1:02:28] and this is the condemnation listen that
[1:02:30] light is coming to the world and Men
[1:02:33] love Darkness rather than light because
[1:02:35] their deeds were evil so men saw the
[1:02:37] light and turned from the light and
[1:02:40] that's the condemnation brother or Jesus
[1:02:43] rather talks about capernium and he
[1:02:45] cries out against capernium and he and
[1:02:47] he says it's going to be worse for Sodom
[1:02:49] on the day of judgment than it is for
[1:02:51] you or it's going to be worse for you
[1:02:52] rather than it was for Sodom
[1:02:55] right it's going to be worse for you he
[1:02:56] said because Sodom didn't have the
[1:02:58] chance that you had they just had
[1:02:59] Messengers but capernium had Christ
[1:03:02] himself the word in their midst and he
[1:03:04] lived right there in the city of
[1:03:06] capernium and yet they never even
[1:03:08] noticed anything was going on they
[1:03:10] touched shoulders with him they they
[1:03:12] walked near him brother B said that was
[1:03:13] the great tragedy of the flunky that
[1:03:15] went down to to ask him to come to the
[1:03:18] dinner he said it's because he didn't
[1:03:19] fall down when he had an audience with
[1:03:21] Jesus he had an opportunity he didn't
[1:03:23] fall down and say Lord forgive me I'm a
[1:03:26] sinner it was such an opportunity that
[1:03:28] he had but the tragedy is he didn't take
[1:03:30] it he was too busy doing other things
[1:03:33] right this is the
[1:03:35] condemnation the capernium saw the
[1:03:38] Miracles the Miracles that were done and
[1:03:40] you were done in TI and sight on they
[1:03:41] would have they would live they would
[1:03:44] repent Bram said this he said I've
[1:03:47] passed across this country I've made
[1:03:48] remarks about Mrs Kennedy with her
[1:03:50] Jezebel haircut haircut and all like
[1:03:51] that her big waterheads these women he
[1:03:54] said I wonder if Mrs Kennedy would have
[1:03:55] heard the messages I have preached she
[1:03:58] might have let her hair grow out a long
[1:03:59] time
[1:04:00] ago I know you've heard these things
[1:04:02] before but just just bear with me for a
[1:04:05] moment he said but I've crossed this
[1:04:07] country back and forth showing by the
[1:04:09] word that it's wrong a condemnation for
[1:04:12] women to cut their hair and Pentecostal
[1:04:14] women continue go on the same way he
[1:04:16] said she might rise in the day of
[1:04:18] judgment not knowing
[1:04:21] it you ever thought about that Jack
[1:04:24] Kennedy who invented the Waterhead
[1:04:26] haircut may
[1:04:29] rise in the day of judgment knowing no
[1:04:33] better but you know
[1:04:37] better Hebrews 4:1 it's a sobering
[1:04:40] thought Paul puts it this way let us
[1:04:41] therefore fear let us the promise being
[1:04:43] left of us entering into his rest any of
[1:04:45] you should seem to come short of it for
[1:04:47] unto us was the Gospel preached as well
[1:04:49] as unto them but the word preached did
[1:04:51] not profit them not being mixed with
[1:04:52] faith and them that heard it for if we
[1:04:55] sin willfully after that we've received
[1:04:56] the knowledge of the truth that
[1:04:58] remaineth no more sacrifice for sins
[1:05:00] brother brandom says th thus sayith
[1:05:01] God's holy word if we disbelieve
[1:05:03] willfully after we've seen it and heard
[1:05:05] it then we're across the line there'll
[1:05:06] never be no more forgiveness for you
[1:05:08] have you have crossed the line and I've
[1:05:09] talked to you about that before you how
[1:05:10] do I know that I've crossed the line
[1:05:12] it's because there's just no capacity to
[1:05:14] want to come anymore there's no you
[1:05:16] don't love Jesus Anymore brother BR said
[1:05:19] if you still love Jesus then you you
[1:05:21] haven't crossed the line do you love him
[1:05:24] this morning and you can say I'm not
[1:05:26] crossed the line I can
[1:05:29] come but there is a group that that
[1:05:31] comes and tastes of it and leaves and
[1:05:34] they cross the line because they they go
[1:05:36] out and and refuse to repent yeah but
[1:05:39] Paul even look at what Paul did and
[1:05:41] we're going to get back to him after a
[1:05:43] while but Paul said I did it ignorantly
[1:05:46] I did it ignorantly we've talked about
[1:05:47] that how could Paul say he did it
[1:05:49] ignorantly he had a knowledge of the law
[1:05:51] he had a memorization of the law he knew
[1:05:52] the law but he had never met he never
[1:05:55] met Christ and because he never really
[1:05:57] met him he said I everything I did
[1:05:59] before I did in ignorance that's what
[1:06:02] Jesus said father forgive them they
[1:06:04] don't know what they're doing what
[1:06:06] they're doing they're doing in blindness
[1:06:08] what I did before I become a Christian I
[1:06:10] did in
[1:06:11] blindness so it's
[1:06:14] ignorance Hebrews 6 and4 for it is
[1:06:17] impossible for those who are once
[1:06:18] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:06:19] Heavenly gift were made partakers of the
[1:06:21] Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word
[1:06:23] of God and the powers of the world to
[1:06:25] come if they shall fall away to renew
[1:06:26] them again un repentance see and they
[1:06:28] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:06:30] aresh and put him to an open shame so
[1:06:31] what we're seeing is a picture of sin
[1:06:34] that it's more it's not so much about
[1:06:35] what's done but it's more about
[1:06:37] opportunities that are
[1:06:40] rejected oh God I'm so glad he's been
[1:06:44] faithful in my
[1:06:45] life but I still feel the pull every
[1:06:48] time I'll be honest with you brother Joe
[1:06:50] every time I every time there's an altar
[1:06:51] call every time I every time I hear the
[1:06:53] train of the himym and and I begin to
[1:06:55] think about I feel that pull you you
[1:06:57] need to make sure you're right you need
[1:06:59] to you need to get right with God you
[1:07:01] need to make sure I'm a holy ghost
[1:07:02] filled Christian I'm a pastor of a
[1:07:03] church but I still feel that pull why do
[1:07:05] I feel that because there's something
[1:07:07] say he's still dealing with me he's
[1:07:09] still making me better he's still he's
[1:07:11] still working on me oh we ought to take
[1:07:14] every opportunity we can to come to the
[1:07:16] house of God and say Lord examine me
[1:07:18] make me better fix me Lord I know I'm
[1:07:21] still in a body of Flesh help me Lord I
[1:07:23] don't want to do what I've been doing I
[1:07:24] want to do better I want to walk further
[1:07:27] I want to be closer than I
[1:07:30] was
[1:07:33] good I don't want to put him to an open
[1:07:36] chain I don't want to in this hour when
[1:07:40] he's so shamed by everybody I don't want
[1:07:42] to strip him put him to an open
[1:07:44] shame let me let me be the one who
[1:07:47] washes his feet thank you Lord amen when
[1:07:50] the opportunity is
[1:07:52] given
[1:07:54] we look around the
[1:07:56] room if you looked around the room there
[1:07:58] where Jesus was you might have seen
[1:08:02] Judas and Judas is the first one that
[1:08:05] pops to mind you think of the worst
[1:08:07] sinner in Simon's house but I don't
[1:08:09] believe he
[1:08:10] was and the reason is because Judas was
[1:08:14] born for the
[1:08:16] purpose of of betraying
[1:08:19] Christ the Bible says Jesus speaking he
[1:08:23] said while with them in the world I kept
[1:08:24] them in my name those that thou gavest
[1:08:26] me have kept none of them is lost but
[1:08:28] the son of
[1:08:29] predition he was born for that purpose
[1:08:33] that the scripture might be
[1:08:34] fulfilled I don't believe that he was
[1:08:37] the worst sinner in Simon's house
[1:08:40] brother brandham said talking about
[1:08:42] Elvis Presley and Pat Boone he said they
[1:08:43] were worse than Judas so there's
[1:08:46] something worse than a Judas he said 90%
[1:08:49] of those singing choirs the Elvis
[1:08:50] Presley and Pat Boon all that tbody
[1:08:52] Ernie or every what they call him him
[1:08:53] down there he said it's worse than Judas
[1:08:55] the scaria again he said Pat Boon those
[1:08:57] people who claim to be religious rock
[1:08:59] and roll and twisting and vulgarity of
[1:09:01] the world then claim Christianity he
[1:09:02] said why is a disgrace it's worse than
[1:09:05] the bootlegger it's worse than the
[1:09:07] prostitute on the street he said God
[1:09:09] would respect the prostitute better than
[1:09:10] that so there are worse things worse
[1:09:14] sinners in the house than Judas who is
[1:09:17] pre-ordained to do what he did sure
[1:09:21] Judas left that house and immediately
[1:09:24] went to betray Jesus but he wasn't the
[1:09:27] worst sinner in Simon's
[1:09:30] house Simon probably thought that the
[1:09:32] worst sinner in Simon's house was The
[1:09:35] Sinner
[1:09:36] woman cuz they had been taught never to
[1:09:38] even touch a woman who had done things
[1:09:41] like what she had done though some of
[1:09:43] them may have been secretly her
[1:09:46] clients but they didn't not they were
[1:09:48] taught not to even not to even eat
[1:09:50] dinner with them not to be around them
[1:09:53] to to create a an air of separation
[1:09:57] between them and those people yeah I I
[1:09:59] will say this we do need to be separate
[1:10:02] but we need to be separate from the
[1:10:04] sin we need to have enough about us so
[1:10:06] we can reach to the Sinner and and and
[1:10:09] Paul or John or James I believe he says
[1:10:11] he said some saved by fear he said
[1:10:14] hating even the Garment that's spotted
[1:10:15] by the flesh he said he said pulling
[1:10:17] them from the fire there's some that you
[1:10:19] you have to you can't be identified with
[1:10:21] what they do but love that person
[1:10:25] love that person as a church there some
[1:10:27] things we just can't be identified with
[1:10:29] but we ought to love people that's what
[1:10:30] we ought to be known for is loving
[1:10:33] people amen right just by virtue of the
[1:10:37] quantity of
[1:10:40] sins this woman had a great case to be
[1:10:44] the worst sinner in Simon's house but
[1:10:47] the random taught us in in marriage and
[1:10:48] divorce that an immoral woman is the
[1:10:50] lowest thing that can be thought of in
[1:10:52] the earth that's harsh isn't it
[1:10:54] but the Bible says this a virtuous woman
[1:10:55] is a crown to her husband she that
[1:10:58] maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his
[1:11:01] bones I'll say this this woman brother B
[1:11:05] said there's something about women that
[1:11:06] he said they catch it quicker than men
[1:11:09] do that's an actual
[1:11:14] quote said they catch it quicker than
[1:11:16] men do catch the spirit or something
[1:11:19] there's something about women and and
[1:11:20] this woman did in in Simon's house so
[1:11:24] she is not oh my she is not the worst
[1:11:28] sinner in Simon's house in fact she is
[1:11:31] the heroin of the
[1:11:33] story by the end as we read earlier all
[1:11:37] of her
[1:11:39] sins oh that's what I once said about me
[1:11:42] I don't care who knows what about me I
[1:11:44] just want him to say all of my sins have
[1:11:47] been washed
[1:11:50] away you see God didn't care about her
[1:11:52] past yeah that's right right he wasn't
[1:11:55] looking at what she had done that's
[1:11:58] right oh God you know there there are
[1:12:01] seeds that you can sew in life that must
[1:12:03] be harvested did you know that and
[1:12:06] that's why we try so hard to get people
[1:12:08] not to make bad
[1:12:09] decisions because when you do that you
[1:12:11] go against the word we know what the
[1:12:13] result of that's going to be those seeds
[1:12:16] must be harvested they will be harvested
[1:12:20] in your life but if you're a child of
[1:12:22] God from the beginning
[1:12:24] yes there is nothing that you can do
[1:12:26] that will change that fact right
[1:12:30] Hallelujah no matter how much pig that
[1:12:32] the prodal son got on him he would never
[1:12:34] be a pig he might smell like a pig he
[1:12:37] might eat like a pig he might have been
[1:12:39] out with the pigs he might be doing
[1:12:41] everything that the pig was doing but he
[1:12:43] would never be a pig when he come to
[1:12:45] himself he said even the servants do
[1:12:47] better than I'm doing what was it he
[1:12:50] could not be a pig he was a son oh we
[1:12:53] might smell like a cner we might have
[1:12:55] everything going on you might have
[1:12:56] everything going on in your life that's
[1:12:57] wrong this morning but you can never be
[1:13:00] if you're being called by God God's
[1:13:02] coming to get you he's going to get a
[1:13:04] hold of you he's coming to get you
[1:13:06] that's why I believe the backsliders are
[1:13:08] coming home that's why I believe that
[1:13:10] the out people that have been out maybe
[1:13:12] for years are beginning to come back to
[1:13:14] the house of God why because I know if
[1:13:16] there's a seat of God there we're
[1:13:18] nearing the end it's time to come
[1:13:21] home you cannot you cannot do anything
[1:13:24] that can take you away from being a son
[1:13:25] or daughter of
[1:13:28] god good
[1:13:30] right
[1:13:32] Hallelujah come
[1:13:34] on the truth
[1:13:36] is some of God's children get involved
[1:13:39] in a horrible things but they do not
[1:13:42] remain in the pit
[1:13:45] right I hope you're hearing me this
[1:13:52] morning said brother Ben who you
[1:13:54] preaching I'm preaching it
[1:13:56] me you're going to see why in a
[1:14:00] minute if you have eternal life brother
[1:14:02] brand said you always
[1:14:04] was there's only one form of it that's
[1:14:06] God he said God's own life Zoe you were
[1:14:08] his attribute he thought of you and knew
[1:14:09] you before the foundation of the world
[1:14:11] yeah look at the woman at the well
[1:14:13] brother BR said she looked around look
[1:14:14] what a sinful shape she was in but see
[1:14:17] he couldn't get that priest because the
[1:14:19] priest was an educated scholar a
[1:14:22] theologian in the word but no
[1:14:24] representation in Heaven Wasn't in God's
[1:14:27] thinking at all but this woman was she
[1:14:30] said sir I perceive that you are a
[1:14:34] prophet he said that's just all he
[1:14:36] wanted her to
[1:14:37] see oh my look at that little woman he
[1:14:41] said again speaking of the woman at the
[1:14:43] well he said she had fallen from God's
[1:14:47] thoughts she could be
[1:14:52] redeemed yeah and I'll say this that
[1:14:55] none of us he will not force us to
[1:14:58] choose him right but he will overwhelm
[1:15:02] us thank you Lord all right right some
[1:15:05] of us had to fall far enough yeah that
[1:15:08] we could feel the overwhelming grace of
[1:15:10] God when he come and ask said you're
[1:15:13] still a child that's right that's right
[1:15:16] that's right amen thank you Lord all
[1:15:18] right oh God come on some of us had to
[1:15:20] had to fall so far into the pit that
[1:15:23] couldn't get out on her own effort and
[1:15:25] he had to reach now I said now you can
[1:15:26] see that's right oh now you can see
[1:15:29] you're still here and I'll say this to
[1:15:31] some of you I know some of us some of
[1:15:33] you have have fallen so far and some of
[1:15:35] you have done things that you wish you'd
[1:15:37] never done and wish you could change
[1:15:38] your story but you had to fall to a
[1:15:40] place where you could recognize he's
[1:15:43] your savior and he still loves you and
[1:15:45] he still cares about you you're still
[1:15:47] his child that's right that's that's
[1:15:51] right amen thank thank you Lord Brother
[1:15:55] Bram looked at that little woman she
[1:15:56] hadd fallen from God's thought she could
[1:15:57] be redeemed she was a subject she had
[1:15:59] representation in heaven she
[1:16:02] turned around thank you Lord the priest
[1:16:06] could not turn around Judas could not
[1:16:09] turn around but she turned
[1:16:14] around oh God her life was complete and
[1:16:18] total darkness but when she met Jesus
[1:16:21] everything changed
[1:16:23] Hallelujah I think I have a picture of
[1:16:25] this and I may have showed this to you
[1:16:27] before Jonathan do you recognize that
[1:16:30] that's on 71 highway going to you can
[1:16:33] find a picture on the internet going up
[1:16:35] Joel you you remember that it's on the
[1:16:37] side of the road going to maybe north of
[1:16:39] neveda going towards Rich Hill but it's
[1:16:41] on the it's on the right side of the
[1:16:42] road I remember seeing that growing up
[1:16:45] and one time I I drove by and I saw that
[1:16:47] P or that that Silo with a tree inside
[1:16:51] it and I thought of all the place places
[1:16:54] for a tree to grow you know that seed
[1:16:57] waited a long time to get enough light
[1:17:01] to be able to come out of the ground
[1:17:04] there's no trees around it there's no no
[1:17:07] one ever planted it and this is a thing
[1:17:10] by the way Silo
[1:17:12] trees there was nothing around it and
[1:17:14] they've cut all the trees around it
[1:17:15] they've it's just a flat field if you've
[1:17:17] ever been back home back where we come
[1:17:19] from it's all flat and and there's there
[1:17:21] was no trees around it how did the tree
[1:17:24] grow like that to be in The Silo and if
[1:17:27] you actually go into that Silo I've not
[1:17:30] been inside this one but I've seen
[1:17:31] pictures taken inside of them that
[1:17:33] actually there's no branches or anything
[1:17:35] inside The Silo that the tree is just a
[1:17:37] straight trunk and at the top it spreads
[1:17:39] out the tree has learned to to grow
[1:17:43] inside of a silo that that seed had to
[1:17:45] wait it it had it was covered over it
[1:17:49] had a roof over it it had a farmer
[1:17:51] dumping Grain on top of of
[1:17:54] it you ever felt like that it had
[1:17:57] everything in the world but the herald
[1:17:59] against it but when it got some rest
[1:18:03] yeah and finally the roof rotted
[1:18:07] off and the grain kept quit being dumped
[1:18:10] in there and it finally reached a place
[1:18:13] in its life that it could begin to begin
[1:18:15] to think about things as we would say it
[1:18:17] it began to receive
[1:18:19] warmth it couldn't receive warmth so it
[1:18:22] never Bloss aome but it finally began to
[1:18:24] receive warmth and one day it began to
[1:18:26] come up and over the years it come up
[1:18:29] and finally it come up to where you
[1:18:31] could see what it was and it actually
[1:18:33] fulfilled its purpose listen many of us
[1:18:35] were like that seed planted in a silo we
[1:18:39] were born in sin shapen in iniquity we
[1:18:41] could not receive the truth but we had
[1:18:43] to wait until everything was rotted away
[1:18:46] we had to wait until we could receive
[1:18:47] light and one day we grabbed a hold of
[1:18:49] it and when we grabbed a hold of it we
[1:18:51] became as much a tree as any other tree
[1:18:54] in the
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] field brother BR said that little Pond
[1:19:00] Lily look where it come through dirt mck
[1:19:02] mud Muddy Waters dirty
[1:19:04] Waters if you if you'll I preached on
[1:19:07] that one time if you actually go through
[1:19:09] that there there's a process dirt muck
[1:19:11] mud it's getting more and more warmth
[1:19:14] and light as it goes up dirt muck mud
[1:19:20] Muddy Waters dirty Waters
[1:19:24] and then one
[1:19:25] day pops up above
[1:19:29] it you remember that that
[1:19:32] day
[1:19:34] am that's
[1:19:36] good one day it just pops up above
[1:19:39] it it never could feel the Sun and
[1:19:43] receive the nutrients from the rain and
[1:19:45] the sun like it ought to until the day
[1:19:48] it came up above the muck and the Muddy
[1:19:52] Waters and the dirty Waters don't don't
[1:19:55] be discouraged because it's taking some
[1:19:58] time to get you where you're at that's
[1:20:00] just the Journey of the seed it's just
[1:20:02] the process of life this little germ of
[1:20:06] Life working itself from the bottom of
[1:20:08] the pond where the frogs and things are
[1:20:10] at and then brings itself up through all
[1:20:13] of that but when it gets in the presence
[1:20:16] of the sun it's born the little seed
[1:20:20] burst open into life it cannot do that
[1:20:24] until it oh God it cannot do that until
[1:20:27] it goes through all that process it's
[1:20:31] got to come through that that's what
[1:20:34] makes
[1:20:35] it and many times we think we look back
[1:20:38] and we think why did I have to go
[1:20:39] through what I went through that's what
[1:20:40] makes it is because the sun itself is
[1:20:42] what's drawing it and when it gets fully
[1:20:45] above all the dirty Waters and muck and
[1:20:46] so forth then it's so happy amen it just
[1:20:49] gives life out freely and it's a
[1:20:51] beautiful thing when it gets in the
[1:20:53] presence of that which is drawing up oh
[1:20:56] I can say Amen to that this
[1:20:59] morning that's good so if Judas wasn't
[1:21:02] the worst Sinner and I don't have time
[1:21:03] to go through each and every one we
[1:21:05] could go through the footwash funky you

[1:21:10] he had better things to
[1:21:12] do there's many others that were
[1:21:15] there we could go through all of them

[1:22:48] Sinner say was the worst sinner in the
[1:22:51] city not the woman oh
[1:22:55] my oh my he said the Pharisees sin is
[1:22:58] unbelief that woman was a Believer yes
[1:23:02] Hallelujah he said the Pharisee was all
[1:23:04] religious but he was the worst sinner in
[1:23:06] the country and it's still the worst
[1:23:08] sinner the world has got is a stiffy
[1:23:11] starch backsliding
[1:23:13] church people take comfort in their
[1:23:15] Church well it they do this that and the
[1:23:17] other for God but are they willing to
[1:23:19] surrender to the
[1:23:21] word are you willing to surrender to
[1:23:23] what the word says so of making up some
[1:23:26] denominational idea or
[1:23:28] Creed
[1:23:30] good said still this worst center of the
[1:23:32] world's got a stiffy starch backsliding
[1:23:34] Church the pastor the same
[1:23:37] way oh I preaching it
[1:23:40] myself I don't believe we're a stiffy
[1:23:42] starch backslid in church but we don't
[1:23:43] want to ever be
[1:23:45] that he said you'll hate me after this
[1:23:48] but God's the one that's telling me to
[1:23:49] say it so there it is he said that's the
[1:23:51] sinner a stuan that's right that's good
[1:23:56] the Bible tells us he was a Pharisee
[1:23:57] from his youth he was trained to do
[1:23:58] everything Moses taught plus the
[1:24:00] tradition of the elders he did more than
[1:24:03] he had to do and he was so proud that he
[1:24:06] didn't have a Christmas tree I mean he
[1:24:13] he they would drop an article of
[1:24:17] clothing on on Sabbath day they they
[1:24:20] wouldn't transgress the law so they made
[1:24:22] up Creeds to go around the laws does it
[1:24:24] sound familiar I wish people would just
[1:24:27] surrender to the word he said but it's
[1:24:29] me that it catches that's fine just
[1:24:32] acknowledge the word is right and move
[1:24:35] on he's still a savior he still has
[1:24:38] Grace for The Sinner he still wants you
[1:24:41] yes but you got to be willing to
[1:24:42] acknowledge the
[1:24:45] truth they would drop articles of
[1:24:47] clothing every so far because they can
[1:24:49] only go so far on a Sabbath day and they
[1:24:51] call that their house
[1:24:53] they put a chair down about one mile
[1:24:55] only go one mile on the Sabbath days
[1:24:56] they put a chair down there and they
[1:24:58] have a a flunky run on ahead of them so
[1:25:00] they could keep the law and still do
[1:25:03] whatever they wanted to
[1:25:05] do
[1:25:07] Pharisee he'd been trained in the
[1:25:09] message he learned to keep his house
[1:25:12] clean of people like The Sinner
[1:25:14] woman the word Pharisee today carries a
[1:25:17] negative connotation but in jesus' time
[1:25:18] they would have been respected for their
[1:25:20] Holiness they were the best the closest
[1:25:22] to the truth Paul put it this way CU he
[1:25:25] had been one he said though I might also
[1:25:27] have confidence in the flesh he said if
[1:25:30] any other man thinketh yet whereof he
[1:25:31] might Trust In the Flesh I more he said
[1:25:34] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[1:25:37] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin a
[1:25:40] Hebrew of the
[1:25:41] Hebrews as touching the law of
[1:25:45] Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the
[1:25:48] church touching the righteousness which
[1:25:50] is in the law
[1:25:53] blameless sir I remember you probably
[1:25:56] remember there was a lady got up in our
[1:25:57] church a Holiness lady one time when I
[1:25:59] was a kid I never forget her testimony
[1:26:02] her testimony was I've always been a
[1:26:04] good
[1:26:07] girl well remember Donald Trump not prot
[1:26:11] Trump or against Trump but I remember
[1:26:13] back in the 2016 campaign he said well I
[1:26:15] not really done anything to be forgiven
[1:26:19] of oh God help us today
[1:26:23] We Know Better Don't
[1:26:25] We concerning Zeal persecuting the
[1:26:28] church touching the righteousness which
[1:26:29] is in the law
[1:26:31] blameless Jesus tells us how they lived
[1:26:34] Matthew 5:24 I say to you that except
[1:26:35] your righteousness shall exceed the
[1:26:37] righteousness of the scribes and
[1:26:38] Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[1:26:40] into the Kingdom of Heaven Matthew 23:23
[1:26:44] woe unto you scribes and Pharisees

[1:26:48] anise and
[1:26:50] cumin well tell you what I put you what

[1:26:57] is you didn't think you was going to
[1:26:59] hear this today but you are you know
[1:27:01] what the secret to good chile is when
[1:27:03] they get that little bottle of cumin
[1:27:04] that they sell the store dump it all
[1:27:08] in the whole bottle you'll thank me
[1:27:12] later I have never paid Ties on
[1:27:18] that I give away more than I keep and
[1:27:20] I'm glad I'm able to do that church but
[1:27:22] glad you you make me able to do that I I
[1:27:25] I appreciate that so much but I've never
[1:27:27] paid tithe on on
[1:27:29] cumin they
[1:27:32] did but you said he said you've omitted
[1:27:35] the the weightier matters of the law yes
[1:27:38] judgment mercy and Faith these ought you
[1:27:41] to have done not to leave the other
[1:27:43] undone right he said you blind guides
[1:27:45] which strain at a n and swallow a
[1:27:48] camel it's pretty descriptive w't you
[1:27:51] scribe and Pharisees Hypocrites you may
[1:27:53] clean the outside of the cup and the
[1:27:55] platter but within they're full of
[1:27:56] extortion and excess th blind fisy he
[1:28:00] cleanse first that which is within the
[1:28:02] cup and the platter that the outside of
[1:28:04] them may be clean also yes woe unto you
[1:28:07] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[1:28:09] you're like ined septo curse which are
[1:28:12] indeed appear beautiful outward but are
[1:28:14] within full of dead men's bones and of
[1:28:16] all uncleanness even so you also
[1:28:19] outwardly appear righteous un men but
[1:28:21] within your full of hypocrisy and
[1:28:24] iniquity you know one of the marks of
[1:28:27] phariseeism is to publicize the sins of
[1:28:29] others and hide your
[1:28:32] own I'll be honest with you I've been
[1:28:34] around this area for here for years but
[1:28:36] since moving here I I found a a a large
[1:28:41] a large portion of of people who are of
[1:28:44] my former
[1:28:47] persuasion a lot of recovering Pharisees
[1:28:50] and some who need to recover
[1:28:55] amen Pharisees were grateful not for
[1:28:57] Mercy but for their own
[1:29:00] righteousness you find that with the
[1:29:02] woman caught in adultery when they
[1:29:03] caught her in the act of adultery but
[1:29:06] never even thought to question who the
[1:29:07] guy
[1:29:09] was but they caught her and so they were
[1:29:11] going to Stone her and Jesus just draws
[1:29:14] in the sand I don't know what he drew
[1:29:16] but it was something made him think he
[1:29:19] looks up he says which among you haven't
[1:29:24] sinned cast the first
[1:29:26] stone the person who without sin because
[1:29:30] you're all worthy of death right and the
[1:29:32] oldest had the most sense so they left
[1:29:34] first and the youngest stood there still
[1:29:37] clutching their Stones looking around
[1:29:38] saying you know what I better join them
[1:29:40] at the altar that's
[1:29:43] right it's good oh God he said you're
[1:29:47] inside you're full of hypocrisy and
[1:29:49] iniquity he looked up at the woman he
[1:29:50] said he said do you don't have any
[1:29:53] accusers she said none said neither do I
[1:29:56] condemn thee go sin no more don't do it
[1:29:59] again don't do it again God help us
[1:30:03] today that's what brother bandam tells
[1:30:04] us he said he said don't do it again but
[1:30:07] God is giving you
[1:30:10] Grace that's
[1:30:12] good Luke 18
[1:30:17] and10 and just bear with me a moment I I
[1:30:19] don't know why I the Lord laid this on
[1:30:21] my heart this morning but I I believe
[1:30:23] it's for me I believe it's for
[1:30:26] me as I said I was one of those Luke 18
[1:30:30] and 10 two men went up in the temple to
[1:30:31] pray the one a Pharisee the other a
[1:30:33] Publican the Pharisees stood and prayed
[1:30:35] thus with himself God I thank thee that
[1:30:37] I'm not as other men are extortioners
[1:30:40] unjust adulterers or even as this
[1:30:43] Publican I fast twice in the week he
[1:30:45] does better than I do I give tithes of
[1:30:48] all that I
[1:30:49] possess and the publicans standing a far
[1:30:52] off would not lift up so much as his
[1:30:54] eyes Under heaven but smoted upon his
[1:30:56] breast and said God be merciful to me a
[1:30:59] sinner he said I tell you this man went
[1:31:01] down to his house Justified rather than
[1:31:04] the other don't you want to be justified
[1:31:06] don't you want to leave church and know
[1:31:07] that all your sins are under the blood
[1:31:09] then you got to come like the like the
[1:31:11] Publican
[1:31:12] came God be merciful to me a sinner yeah
[1:31:16] I tell you this man went down to his
[1:31:18] house Justified rather than the other
[1:31:19] for everyone that exalteth himself shall
[1:31:21] be the based and he that humbleth
[1:31:22] himself shall be exalted brandom said
[1:31:25] people who claim to be religious go to
[1:31:26] church Pious and still rank unbelievers
[1:31:29] Sinners Jesus said you're of your father
[1:31:31] the devil yet they were just as Pious
[1:31:32] and religious as they could be he said
[1:31:34] the worst demon demon there is to deal
[1:31:36] with is a religious
[1:31:38] demon you know there's seven times more
[1:31:41] demons in a religious unbeliever than a
[1:31:43] regular unbeliever that's
[1:31:46] right what the Bible says the unclean
[1:31:50] Spirit has gone out of a man what does
[1:31:51] that me make him
[1:31:53] religious right he walks through Dry
[1:31:55] places seeking rest and finding none
[1:31:58] then he says I will return to my house
[1:32:01] to my house from whence I came out
[1:32:03] because no one else has ever taken up
[1:32:05] residence oh you need the baptism of the
[1:32:07] Holy Ghost you need something to make
[1:32:10] you think different make you make you
[1:32:11] live the word make you walk with God I
[1:32:14] need it amen all of us needed he said he
[1:32:17] walketh through Dry Place seeking rest
[1:32:18] and findeth none he said I'll return to
[1:32:20] my house once they come out when come he
[1:32:22] findeth an empty sweat garnished very
[1:32:23] religious yeah and goeth he and taketh
[1:32:26] with himself seven other Spirits more
[1:32:28] wicked than
[1:32:29] himself he's actually more than seven
[1:32:32] times more
[1:32:34] wicked than the regular unbeliever yes
[1:32:38] they enter in and dwell there in the
[1:32:39] last state of that man is worse than the
[1:32:41] first even so shall it be also unto this
[1:32:44] wicked
[1:32:46] generation I'll say this sometimes you
[1:32:49] say well I I wasn't a Pharisee I come
[1:32:51] out of a life of sin sometimes a person
[1:32:53] that's even been saved off a bar stool
[1:32:55] can become a Pharisee it's it's amazing
[1:32:57] to me how quickly someone can become a
[1:33:00] judge of someone else after having lived
[1:33:04] a life and been forgiven by
[1:33:10] God and I'll say this let the word judge
[1:33:13] you not other people just come to the
[1:33:15] word yes Peter was that way Peter very
[1:33:20] quickly after having been saved from the
[1:33:22] worst thing you can do probably is to
[1:33:24] deny Jesus Christ and he's forgiven of
[1:33:27] that and then when he comes down to the
[1:33:29] Gentiles he won't eat with them he goes
[1:33:32] with the
[1:33:33] Pharisees quickly becomes a Pharisee but
[1:33:36] I thank God as we're getting down
[1:33:39] towards the close this morning right I
[1:33:41] thank God that Pharisees can get saved
[1:33:48] yeah you say why are you so thankful of
[1:33:51] that brother Ben because I was one yeah
[1:33:54] I've been a Pharisee I know what it's
[1:33:57] like to to look down on everybody else
[1:33:59] and know what and know that I'm better
[1:34:01] than what you are because I've never
[1:34:02] done it I've been there yeah but I was
[1:34:05] like that like that uh that tree coming
[1:34:08] out of the silo I didn't realize my life
[1:34:10] was dark and I needed Jesus as much as
[1:34:13] anybody else did listen to me you young
[1:34:15] people raised in church I want you to
[1:34:16] live without the scars I want you to
[1:34:18] raise up and never go out in the world I
[1:34:20] want you to live all your life for Jesus
[1:34:22] I want you to love him with all of your
[1:34:24] heart but listen to me you've got to
[1:34:26] receive him you've got to receive the
[1:34:27] Holy Ghost like everybody else does you
[1:34:30] got to recognize you're a sinner and you
[1:34:31] got to be delivered of a religious
[1:34:33] spirit and come into the house of God
[1:34:35] and believe God for your own
[1:34:38] salvation good Paul had to be delivered
[1:34:41] of being a Pharisee that gives me
[1:34:45] hope that there's room for people in
[1:34:49] hardy people who believe believe the
[1:34:51] message in whose parents and
[1:34:52] grandparents and great-grandparents all
[1:34:54] believe the message in people who are
[1:34:56] second third fourth fifth generation
[1:34:57] Believers but they still need a savior
[1:34:59] and there's room for you recovering
[1:35:01] Pharisee there's room for you if that's
[1:35:03] what you've been there's there's a place
[1:35:05] for you
[1:35:06] too see first he could have been saved
[1:35:09] no he wasn't but he could have been sir
[1:35:11] perhaps he could have been he could have
[1:35:13] been in that number but he refuse to do
[1:35:16] it there will be many you have to say
[1:35:18] whosoever will I say this if you want to
[1:35:21] you can be
[1:35:23] saved but Judas couldn't be saved so the
[1:35:27] Pharisee was the worst
[1:35:29] sinner 1 Timothy 1:12 I thank Christ
[1:35:31] Jesus our lord who has enabled me that
[1:35:35] he counted me faithful put putting me
[1:35:38] into the ministry who was before a
[1:35:41] blasphemer and a persecutor an
[1:35:45] injurious I hurt other people I didn't
[1:35:47] mean to but I hurt people yeah but I
[1:35:50] obtained Mercy because I did it
[1:35:52] ignorantly in
[1:35:54] unbelief he wasn't hurting people by the
[1:35:56] word sometimes we and there's nothing I
[1:35:59] hate more than having to hurt people I
[1:36:00] realize that sometimes what we preach
[1:36:02] hurts sometimes like what I say to
[1:36:05] people has it has to hurt it is going to
[1:36:07] hurt because it's the word and the word
[1:36:10] sometimes hurt but Lord let me be first
[1:36:12] partaker of it let me not give to others
[1:36:15] what I won't take
[1:36:16] myself but here he was injurious not
[1:36:19] realizing he was in blindness
[1:36:22] and a
[1:36:23] Pharisee but I obtained Mercy because I
[1:36:25] did it ignorantly in unbelief oh my and
[1:36:29] the grace of our Lord was exceeding
[1:36:30] abundant with faith and love which is in
[1:36:32] Christ Jesus he said this is a faithful
[1:36:34] saying and worthy of all acceptation
[1:36:37] that Christ Jesus came into the world to
[1:36:39] save Sinners of whom who's the worst
[1:36:43] sinner in Simon's
[1:36:45] house come on now of whom I am chief yes
[1:36:50] he already told us I was a Pharisee of
[1:36:52] the Pharisees I was the best Pharisee
[1:36:54] and the worst sinner
[1:36:56] yeah we could say that today I was the
[1:36:59] best message person but also the worst
[1:37:03] sinner how be it for this cause I
[1:37:06] obtained Mercy I love this that in me
[1:37:09] first Jesus Christ might show forth all
[1:37:11] longsuffering for a pattern that's a
[1:37:14] pattern I can look at but the herald
[1:37:16] didn't say I can be saved too you can be
[1:37:18] saved too a pattern to them should
[1:37:21] Hereafter believe on him to life
[1:37:23] Everlasting
[1:37:26] yes Jesus turned to the woman in verse
[1:37:28] 44 of Luke chapter 7 he told Simon he
[1:37:31] said you you never worshiped me when you
[1:37:34] invited me in oh we ought to worship him
[1:37:37] this
[1:37:38] morning said you never you never kissed
[1:37:41] me but she's washed my feet with tears
[1:37:43] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[1:37:44] head you didn't give me no kiss but this
[1:37:47] woman since the time I came in had not
[1:37:49] ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil
[1:37:52] thou did not anoint but this woman hath
[1:37:54] anointed my feet with
[1:37:56] ointment wherefore I say unto thee you
[1:37:59] you say My Worship doesn't matter she
[1:38:01] begs to differ that's right come on this
[1:38:05] woman begs to differ you see it don't
[1:38:07] matter how I come to church it don't
[1:38:08] matter matter whether I raise my hands
[1:38:10] it don't matter whether I worship him
[1:38:11] when he comes it does matter yes sir she
[1:38:14] begs to differ but because she worshiped
[1:38:16] because she washed the feet of Jesus
[1:38:18] because she did something that was
[1:38:20] needed in the house of God and I'll say
[1:38:23] this worship is always needed in the
[1:38:25] house of God sometimes we need somebody
[1:38:27] to sweep the floors sometimes we need
[1:38:29] somebody to help with the kids sometimes
[1:38:31] we need somebody to put food on the
[1:38:32] table but always we need worship always
[1:38:35] we need the Praises of God to come from
[1:38:37] the people of God always we need the
[1:38:40] presence of
[1:38:43] God
[1:38:45] Amen said wherefore her sins which are
[1:38:48] many are forgiven
[1:38:52] for she loved
[1:38:53] much but to whom little Is
[1:38:56] Forgiven the same loveth
[1:38:59] little as the musicians come I want to
[1:39:02] ask
[1:39:06] you I've asked myself this question do I
[1:39:10] love him little or
[1:39:14] much there's a direct correlation
[1:39:17] between how I view myself whether I
[1:39:21] recognize that I am a sinner was a
[1:39:23] sinner saved by grace there a direct
[1:39:26] correlation between that and how I
[1:39:31] worship how I love
[1:39:33] him I want to love him with everything
[1:39:36] that I've got in me yes I don't want to
[1:39:39] love him a little he'll take that right
[1:39:41] brother BR said if you give him second
[1:39:43] place he'll take second place yes if you
[1:39:45] give him third place he'll take third
[1:39:47] place but of all people who ought to
[1:39:49] give him preeminence shouldn't have be
[1:39:51] us of all people who ought to give him
[1:39:54] first place who ought to entertain him
[1:39:55] when he comes in the house shouldn't it
[1:39:58] be
[1:39:59] us I'll say this with your head bowed
[1:40:02] and your eyes closed there is no worse
[1:40:05] sinner than Simon
[1:40:09] Pharisee but Paul knew
[1:40:12] that oh God he said I've done what I've
[1:40:16] done and I preached where I preach and I
[1:40:18] I I've taken persecution and all of
[1:40:20] these things
[1:40:21] because I knew that I was the chief of
[1:40:24] Sinners and God still loves
[1:40:27] Pharisees who are willing to
[1:40:31] repent I
[1:40:33] knew that I was the chief
[1:40:36] Sinner and so I loved him that much
[1:40:42] more I say God help me today you young
[1:40:44] people that have been raised in church
[1:40:47] can't you realize what he saved you from
[1:40:49] what he's kept you from
[1:40:52] you that have been decades in the house
[1:40:55] of God and you've never left you've
[1:40:56] always stood like a rock I thank you for
[1:40:59] that but don't you know that you ought
[1:41:01] to love him that much
[1:41:05] more because you could have been a
[1:41:08] Pharisee you could have been someone
[1:41:10] with no experience who just did what
[1:41:12] everybody else
[1:41:13] did but something got a hold of
[1:41:16] you if something could get a hold of me
[1:41:19] I believe that if Jesus could save me he
[1:41:22] could save the the worst prostitute the
[1:41:24] worst drunker the worst religious person
[1:41:27] in the
[1:41:29] world because he saved
[1:41:32] [Music]
[1:41:38] me I want to ask you with every head
[1:41:40] bowed and every eye
[1:41:43] closed I want to speak directly to I'll
[1:41:46] say to us Pharisees this
[1:41:49] morning
[1:41:51] maybe you became a
[1:41:56] Pharisee why don't you talk to him for a
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:01] minute if if if that's you this morning
[1:42:03] and maybe you started looking down on
[1:42:05] other people
[1:42:07] and well I'm glad I'm not like
[1:42:10] that I'm glad I'm not like
[1:42:13] them glad I didn't do that that's okay
[1:42:16] but you better be
[1:42:19] careful
[1:42:22] if you've been a Pharisee a little bit
[1:42:23] of a Pharisee why don't you just raise
[1:42:24] your hand to him yeah brother man I've
[1:42:26] heard you preach like this before I have
[1:42:29] fact I may have preached this sermon
