For all every trouble, every trial, every sickness, everything you've ever went through, everything you're ever going to go through, we have someone who cares. Amen.

Anybody else looking forward to the word of the Lord this evening? Amen. We got four or five. That's all we need, I guess. Amen. Just be sure when the pastor comes out, just pull on the gift of God, you know, because if you don't pull, it kind of shows a lack of expectation. Amen. So, if you just pull on the gift of God, it really shows that you're under anticipation to be blessed [music] uh tonight. I I tell you what, I believe if you're expecting something tonight from the Lord that he'll answer that need. Do you believe that? Amen. He absolutely said the prophet of God tells us you get what you expect. And so I say that a lot. But you know, I I believe every one of us, we need to just make sure we come with expectations every time we come inside those doors because I believe we're in for a [music] blessing and we're in for a good time. Amen. So as a pastor comes, let's just sing this with all of our hearts. Want [singing] to care. all your troubles like no other [singing] can do. And he'll [singing] come down from [music] the sky, brush the tears [music and singing] from your eyes. You're his child and [singing and music] he cares for you. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, we have someone to care. [music] Oh, someone [singing] to share all your troubles [music] like no other [singing] can do. He'll [singing] come down from the sky. Brush the tears from your eyes. You're his child and he cares for [singing and music] you. One more time. Oh, we have someone to care. We have someone in all our troubles like no other can do. Aren't you glad he's there? [music] Oh, he'll come down [singing] from the sky, brush the tears [singing] from your eyes. You're [music] his child and he cares [singing] for you. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we're so grateful that you are that [music] someone who cares, someone who shares all of our burdens. And Father, we know we can lay it over on you and you can take it. Lord, when we're so sick that we can't heal ourselves, doctors can't do anything. That you said, "I am the God who heals all your diseases." And maybe we're so weary that we can't put one foot in front of another, but you're the God who said that through you we could do all things. And so, we're trusting you today and believing you. We put our burdens over on you, knowing that you care for us. I pray that you would move tonight, Lord, speak directly to your people. I I I'm insufficient in myself to be able to speak tonight, but I know that you can and you will. And I pray that you'd do that. Move me out of the way. Speak to your people. We pray in [music] Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to Revelation chapter 2. Revelation chapter 2 and verse 14. We're going to get back to Ephesians at some point, but I just while we had a little opportunity in the meantime, I want to deal with something today just a little bit different. Revelation 2:14 says, "But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balum." This is from the Pergamus church age who taught bailac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. I want to speak to you tonight on the new pope. Kind of give you an update on that and uh also on uh the Nyian council, another Nyian council. I don't often respond to items in the news. As you know, I'm not very political, but uh you may have noticed over the last couple weeks that the new pope from the United States has been very active in the press. And I want to look at some things in the light of the scriptures and the message of the hour. I'm glad we have a message, &gt;&gt; right? I'm glad that God sent a prophet. I want to say that at the very beginning because we can understand things that are going on right now in a way that the denominational world can't. And that's not because they're they're bad people or they're evil or something like that, but it's just because we've heard a message and we heard a voice that said, "Come out of her, my people." And be not partaker of her plagues. And so, we sure want to acknowledge that. And and he told us to watch certain things. And we know that when we uh here a while back I had and I talked about it when the new pope was elected. They said there was no way a pope from the US would be elected and yet he was. And I believe it was a fulfillment of what a prophet had to say. And and you said, "Brother Ben, how can you say that's the fulfillment?" Because brother Brandham said there would be a pope from the US. And then we have one. We don't know that he'll be the one that'll become the incarnate antichrist. But we do know that time is coming. We're coming to a maturity when all all the things that have been spoken are going to come to pass at some point. &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand that. I want our young people to understand that. I think we take for granted that people know what we're talking about when we talk about these things. But we need to understand it. And we need to be able to say, "Lord, come quickly." &gt;&gt; We need to know what time we live in. We live in a time when it's not time to play church. It's not time to just uh sit around and and wait on something to happen. And things are happening, not just out there in the world in the news in the Catholic Church or something like that, but right here among the bride, things are happening and we're getting closer and closer to the end of time. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; So, if there ever was a time to be on fire for God, now's the time. &gt;&gt; If there ever was a time to live for the Lord with all of your heart and and all of your passion and everything that you've got, now's the time to do that. It's not the time to back up. It's the time to press on. Amen. the coming of the Lord. So, Brother Brandham talks about uh in the 1950s and 1960s and uh talks about communism and and everybody in that time if you went back and just took a survey of sermons during that time, you would find that uh there was a topic of most evangelical sermons and it was communism and everybody was afraid. Some of you lived through that time and and everybody was afraid of Russia. Everybody was afraid of communism. But in 1962, brother Brandham said this. He said, "Don't watch iron curtains." Right? The iron curtain was the separation between the east and the west. That was the uh Russian uh the communist government of Russia. He said, "Don't watch iron curtains and bamboo curtains." That's China. He said, "But watch the purple curtain. The purple curtain is Rome." He said, "That's the one that's going to get you." He said, "Don't you never worry about that." He said, "You just mark that down and say, "Brother Brandham said it and put it in your Bible and see if it's right." &gt;&gt; Right. This was uh 25 years, 30 years probably before communism broke apart and communist Russia was opened back up and everybody thought they were going to destroy the world. And they do have a place and Russia has a place, but maybe not what they thought it would be. But brother Brandham said this. He said, "Communism is nothing but a tool in God's hand." He said, playing right up. Why? It won't amount to nothing. He said, "That's exactly right. Don't fear about that. That's something that'd throw you off of the track of looking." He said, "But Bible readers and men who love God." How many love God tonight? He said, "Stay with what the Bible said." So, the Bible tells us about Rome. The purple curtain is Rome. She's the woman who sat on a scarlet-c colorored beast in Revelation 17. And you can go look at that and and and see that that that's Rome, a city on seven hills. Now, the first news item that come up uh this week uh was a news item that uh a headline that said that the pope declared that Mary was not a co-redeemer. And we could all say amen to that. Like we've known that for a long time. But it was very interesting that the pope would declare that Mary was not a co-redeemer because people in the Catholic Church have been pushing to give her that title for some time now because there's a cult of Mary within the Catholic Church and and and they do worship Mary. They'll tell you that they don't, but they actually do. It's only been a few months since the pope actually uh actually declared like six months before he declared that Mary was not a co-redeemer. He declared that the people should show more devotion to Mary. More devotion to Mary. So I think I have that as well. Yeah. Let us renew our devotion to Mary. And he actually venerated the icon of Mary. But I'm going to back up just a little bit. I've got some articles if you want to read them later. I I'll give them to you. whoever comes first, but you can look it up online. But uh they talk about Mary and how she's not the uh co-redeemer uh with Jesus. And yet they say things like this in that article that this one cardinal when he was looking at Mary's face, he said he saw the sorrow on Mary's face, he's looking at a statue. He said because of the death of her son, at the same time her obvious strength, he said was so beautiful. It was understandable why people would want to say everything and more about Mary. Do you see the spirit of idolatry? It just they they just love her so much. They wouldn't want to say anything bad about her, but it's a spirit of idolatry that caused them to actually worship her. [snorts] So the uh uh the new document says that the titles used for Mary should speak of her motherly care for all people and her place as the perfect disciple of Jesus. but must not create any doubt that Catholics believe Jesus is the redeemer of the world and the bestower of grace. So they're coming closer to a Protestant understanding of Mary than what they were. They're coming closer to that and yet they still worship Mary. Let us renew our devotion to Mary. They say the pope stressed the importance of having a relationship with the mother of God. Do you realize how uh how idolatrous that is? &gt;&gt; How pagan that is? Right? We don't commune with the dead. &gt;&gt; Right? I love my dad, but I don't have a relationship with him anymore. He's gone on, &gt;&gt; right? We do not commune with the dead. &gt;&gt; So, we can't have a relationship with the mother of God. She was not the mother of God. We know because God created both the blood cell and the egg. He said, "This is a wonderful moment to renew our devotion to Mary." He said in the image of Salis Papuli Romani which is the image of Mary there in Rome who has accompanied the people of Rome through so many of their trials. He said let us ask God through the intercession of his mother to bless all the families loved ones and help us journey together in the church united as one family. Boy, it sounds good doesn't it? &gt;&gt; But but we realize how pagan that is, &gt;&gt; right? It's pagan. It's idolatry. And yet they're publicly moving closer to the Protestant position on Mary. Now, what does the Bible say about that? It says about the Antichrist, says this more than one place, but let's take Daniel 11:21. It says, "In his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honor of the kingdom, but he shall come in peaceibly." Someone say, "Peaceably." I want to make sure you all stay awake tonight. And obtain the kingdom by what? Flatteries. Flatteries. So flatteries literally in the original means slickness. Slickness. He comes in with slickness. He obtains the kingdom by flatteries. What has it done? Brother Brandon says in cunningness, as he said, he comes in like flatteries. He said, and what has he done? He's bringing the Protestant ecumenical council of the world churches. Remember the the uh Catholic Church was the uh is is the mo the harlot that sits on uh the Roman beast and controls the world through that. And then we find that the there was another beast that raised up which was the United States right out of the earth. And then there was uh uh there there was a uh world council of churches which was the image to the beast. They made an image to the beast. It wasn't the beast, but it was like the beast. Brother Brandham said that was the world council of churches. He said the spirit of antichrist upon both of them, &gt;&gt; right? Both of them. Brother Stewart showed me a quote before church tonight where he said that the Protestants and the Catholics would actually fight against Jesus and the resurrected saints at the battle of Armageddon. I tell you what, church, where it's not going to be say, "Well, uh, you know, I'm bored right now. I don't have much to do." Well, there's some things you're going to be doing, right? We're going to a wedding supper. We're going to be I don't know how all that'll will turn out, but I know we're going to fight in the battle of Armageddon. There those things are real. They're going to happen. And you got to believe those things. There's a real rapture. There's a real body change. There's a real Jesus coming back. And we we need to grab a hold of that and look to those things because we know that this world is not what we see as real is not really what's real. But the reality of it is what the word says. We know what our future is, what our home's going to be. Your future is not the present condition of your body. But your future is a future home. You need to grab a hold of that. Listen, people can get so discouraged today because they can't see. But Moses, what did he do? He looked beyond the toil of the people, looked at the future, and said, "I know what they're going to be. I know that they're God's people. I know that they belong to God." And so, we have to be able to look at ourselves the same way. Are you with me so far? Amen. &gt;&gt; So he said he comes in in cunningness. He said and the spirit of antichrist upon both of them bringing them to the slaughter. That's the battle of Armageddon. And and and and yet he speaks of another slaughter as well. This is from feast of the trumpets. He said just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride. Now the other he's speaking of there is Hiller and Ikeman and the Jews, right? That the Holocaust. So there was a slaughter of the people during the holy he said in this world council of churches bringing them to the slaughter. He said just like they did the other in the hour to call the bride. So the spirit on the pope and on the ecumenical council and the church is the same spirit &gt;&gt; that is on that was on Hitler. &gt;&gt; Right? He don't look much like Hitler, does he? &gt;&gt; But that's how Satan does things. &gt;&gt; Right? the Pope. The same spirit that's on the Pope is the same spirit that was on Hitler. The same spirit that was on Stalin, the same spirit that was on Ikeman. All of those, it was loosed in the natural realm and now it's been loosed in the ecclesiastical realm. He said, and he said, just in the hour to call the bride, &gt;&gt; right? So that's when it would be loose. He said, how loosed in the ecclesiastical church spirit? Loosed upon what? Not upon the denominations, upon the bride. He said, but here you'll get it. the bride will not go through that time. So when it's loosed in a natural way, we won't be here. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. &gt;&gt; Right? A lot of people think, well, we're going to get killed. We're going to the church doors are going to shut be shut. And brother said they would be. He said, but before they can shut the church doors, we'll go up. &gt;&gt; Right? Before they can shut it, we'll go. I'm so thankful for that. So thankful. He gives us an opportunity to hear the gospel and to preach the gospel. We should take advantage of that. One day it's GOING TO BE CLOSED and that day will be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh they've proven they can do it. They proved that during co &gt;&gt; they can close the church doors, but we won't close our doors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. We're going home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If we if they close the doors of this church, we're still going to have church one way or another. &gt;&gt; I've made up my mind as a pastor. I I don't want to ever live through another time where we can't have church. &gt;&gt; Let's have church. It's too important to us. It's too precious to us. You say, "Brother Ben, there's not a whole lot of people on a Wednesday night." But do you realize what could happen in this environment when the saints of God are gathered together? We're in heavenly places in Christ. I've seen sinners come. I've seen people restored. I've seen marriages restored and children come to God AND PEOPLE CHANGE. WHAT IS IT? Because the saints of God are coming together, worshiping together. Let's keep doing that as long as we can. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so what's happening now is not repentance. Did you know that the Catholic Church is not repenting of what they believed, &gt;&gt; it's flatteries. &gt;&gt; And and because the Bible says Revelation 2:21, I gave her space to repent &gt;&gt; of her fornication and she repented not. So she she refused to repent a long time ago. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this and it directly relates to this situation. He said, 'Now don't be confused and start thinking that the church of Rome has repented of her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the Protestants by making her creeds. Is the message perfect or not? &gt;&gt; See, she's attempting to unite with the Protestants by making her creeds line up with Protestant creeds. &gt;&gt; Is that not what we saw this week? &gt;&gt; Right? Is that not what he said? that well we're going to declare Mary's not a co- redeemer. Well, the Protestants ate that up. &gt;&gt; Well, the Catholics are just like us now. They put their faith in Christ. &gt;&gt; What are they doing? Attempting to unite with the Protestants by making her creeds to line up with Protestant creeds. &gt;&gt; He said, "But not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders. And she won't either. No matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time, she will yet rise up to kill. For murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart. So there will come a day when they'll kill people physically just like they did during the dark ages. Right? That's coming. And thank God we'll be gone when that time comes. Yes. &gt;&gt; The second news item that I saw was the Pope visiting Nya. And so he he visited the spot at the 17 1700th anniversary of the Nyian council. He actually visits the very spot of Nika. And this is interesting because they they didn't find the church that they h held the council of Nika in until 2014. So they've only known about this for about 11 years. And in the last few years, there's been a drought. And what's happened is the waters have receded. So when they found it, they found it by scanning a lake. And over the last few years, the waters have receded until now, you can actually walk in that in that church where the Council of Nika was held. I believe it there's something happening right now, &gt;&gt; right? You've got an American pope, the 1700th anniversary of Nika, he's going back to the spot for the first time. It wasn't even possible for them to go back to Nika until now. Now, be honest with me tonight. All right, I want you to raise your hands. If you know the significance of Nya and the Nyian council to what we believe, raise your hand. I'm not going to make you explain it. So, so we need to explain it a little bit so that the rest of you understand. I think most of you know or at least you know kind of what it is. But the reason that Nika is significant is because it was the first worldwide council and it made significant changes. So before that the Christians were scattered all over the face of the earth. So this is about 300 years after the death of Jesus and they they pull in all the Christians all the the heads of the churches which had come to be called bishops because what happened is a spirit of nickelism. Nicolatanism means to conquer the ley. And so what nickelanism is is when uh one bishop sets themselves up over another bishop, right? Or a bishop over a deacon, a over a preacher, over a pastor. You know, they have levels of it and a hierarchy. And so uh they [snorts] called all these men in these hierarchies to come together from from the whole earth. It was the very first what they call ecumenical. Echimemenical means worldwide council. And so the word ecumenical has come to mean a worldwide gathering of believers of Christians because and this was the very first time that it was called. The council was called by Emperor Constantine. And you've heard of Emperor Constantine. He was the first so-called Christian emperor. But at this time he wasn't even a Christian. He was still a pagan offering pagan sacrifices. And he was running the church council because that's the way people defer to power. &gt;&gt; Right. And and brother Brandham typed that in some place he said it'd be like having the mayor come to your church and then you start not preaching what you used to preach [snorts] &gt;&gt; right [laughter] &gt;&gt; because somebody important has come to the church. So now the Constantine came and presided over it and he called them all together. And his his interest in it was to stop them from fighting because a great schism had broke out in the church over who God was, right? And how to baptize because Christians had always baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just like we do today. And even the the history will tell you that there's no no one in the Bible was baptized in the titles of the father, son, and holy ghost. Baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm I'm explaining this in a way even our kids, I hope, will get it. So before that time, baptism was correct mostly. And yet there had been a spirit come in a false doctrine that taught the people to baptize differently. And Constantine comes in to settle the argument being a pagan. And of course, he settles it in a pagan way, right? for father, son, and holy ghost. And so they called them all together. Uh brother Brandham said it like this. He said they didn't believe in three gods in the beginning of the church. He said you can't find that sort of belief amongst the apostles. It was after the apostolic age that this theory came in and really become an issue and a cardinal doctrine of the nian council. So the simple way to understand the nian council is that's where people started baptizing wrong. So if any of your friends ask you why do you baptize in the name of Jesus name the Lord Jesus Christ it's because that's the way the church did it right the early church did it that's the way they did it in the Bible it's what the Bible says but now they start baptizing differently and they formed a trinity doctrine which is three persons right in a godhead and so uh I don't know how to explain this to the kids uh but maybe some of you older people will help too so the trinitarian Ians believe that. Stand up, Jason. Wyatt, stand up. Uh, Peter, stand up. I need three of you to stand up. Um, you stand up for me. Yeah, there we go. So, I got three of them. That's good. They're spread out. So, so Peter be the father. She's a little bit older, got a beard, right? And then, so you're not Peter. You're a different person. You got a different name, right? So, uh, so this would be the the son and this is the Holy Ghost. I've heard a trinitarian explain it this way. He said, "The father and the son get together and talk about what to do on the earth." And they hashed that out and he said, "The Holy Ghost is the divine eavesdropper, right? That that eavesdrops on these other two people's conversations, &gt;&gt; right? So that and they believe that all all these three people are of one substance. That's the trinity doctrine. But it's three distinct separate persons. I knew people in the western church that believe they could tell which person they were praying to at which time. But we believe the Lord, the Bible says the Lord thy God is how many? &gt;&gt; One God, &gt;&gt; right? So if if pe if Peter was the father and he's God, and this is the son and he's God, and this is the Holy Spirit, and he's God, and they're three different persons, you have three gods, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; But if but if you sit down and you sit down and he's he's one, right? But what it is is the father is the son, right? I'm a father and I'm a son. Peter's not yet, but Peter's just a son, but I'm a father and I'm a son, &gt;&gt; right? And I have a spirit in me, &gt;&gt; right? And and what it is, it's God manifesting himself in three different ways. &gt;&gt; It's all God all the time. It's always the father, &gt;&gt; right? And he is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And so when he come to the earth, he just made himself a body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And come down and lived among us because he God is a spirit. You could be seated. God is a spirit. He don't he don't need uh he no man has seen him at any time, but he made himself a body. We talked about that Sunday. He condescended himself. He stepped down into our world. I'm so glad that he did. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we don't believe in three different persons. &gt;&gt; Right? We believe in one person, God. &gt;&gt; The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. He can manifest himself however he wants to. &gt;&gt; Right? He can pour himself. All of God was poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; All that Christ was was poured into the church. So, where does he live now? See, these three people can't live in you, but God lives in you. &gt;&gt; So, a trinitarian will tell you, "Well, the Holy Ghost is in your heart. The Holy Spirit's in your heart, but that's only part of God. &gt;&gt; But we believe that God lives in your heart. And he is the Lord Jesus. He is the Holy Ghost. He is the father. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Maybe that's a little bit simplistic. And some of you can correct, brother Stewart. You can correct that later. But but that's basically what it is. So that's where they chose three. And why would they choose three over one? Because they were pagan. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. They they had never been converted. right to believe in one God. And it's actually the first thing I I believe that a believer as a believer is the very first thing that you learn, the very first revelation that you understand. The Lord your God is one God, &gt;&gt; right? He's just one. And and that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We baptize in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost. Those are titles. I'm a father. I'm a son. I have a spirit. But I am Benjamin Puit. That's my name. The Lord Jesus Christ is his name. I'm so glad that the angel called his name Jesus. And said it was Emmanuel. Said that Jesus was Emanuel. Emanuel means God with us. &gt;&gt; Right? So that that's who he is. All right. Everybody understand that? &gt;&gt; So Nika is where that changed. That's where it changed the teaching on it. So brother Brandon said it was after the apostolic ages theory came in really become an issue in a cardinal doctrine of the nian council. The doctrine of godhead caused a two-way split at na. From that split there come two extremes. One went into pol pol polytheism. Did I say that right? Believing in three gods and the other went into unitarianism. But the revelation through John by the spirit to the churches was I am the lord Jesus Christ and I am all of it. You want to see the godhead? Read revelation chapter one. He said, "I'm the alpha and the omega. I'm the first and the last, the beginning and the end, &gt;&gt; right? He's all of it." &gt;&gt; He said, "There isn't any other god." And he put his seal on this revelation. So na is where it was decided that the main issue for the church was a trinitarian baptism. And those who were baptized differently would be excommunicated from the church. So they and they would still recite the Nyian creed and at every mass they still do that and and they still baptize in titles. It's a very big deal to the Catholic Church and it's a very big deal to the mainline Protestant church, right? They they all can agree on that. That's their ground of fellowship. But we don't fellowship under a trinity doctrine because it's a creed, not not the word of God. We fellowship on the fullness of the atonement, which is the revealed word of the hour. So you say, "Brother Ben, how do I know I can fellowship with someone?" What do they believe? The revealed word of the hour. That's where we fellowship. That's what our fellowship comes around. Amen. So, uh, this happened, this nine council happened during the Pergamus church age. If you look at that, I don't know if you can read it, but that's the one actually from the church age book. Brother Brandham, uh, drew or had drawn where it says Pergamum right there under Martin. Martin was the St. Martin was the, uh, messenger to that age. It started in 312. Nice council was in 3:25. So it happened during that age and that's where we read our text Revelation 2:14. He said, 'I have a few things against thee because thou hast there are them that hold the doctrine of Balum who taught Bailac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. So it's the doctrine of Balum. What was the doctrine of Balum? You get that in Numbers chapter 25. I'm going to speed up to save time, but you get that in Numbers 25. Read verses 1 through3 when you get home. And it talks about how Israel joined himself to Bel Peior. So remember, Balam went down to curse the children of Israel and he couldn't do it &gt;&gt; because he was a real He was a he was a he was a real prophet, &gt;&gt; but he was false. He He wasn't converted. He He had a real gift to be a prophet, &gt;&gt; but he was a false prophet because he was false at the bottom. Type that to anointing once at the end time, but he was a real prophet. So he couldn't curse Israel. They took him up, showed him every bad thing Israel ever did. Aren't you glad that's the way God looks at you? &gt;&gt; Man, he the devil COULD SHOW HIM EVERYTHING that you did wrong. And God says, "I can't see nothing bad in them." &gt;&gt; And that's what Balam said. And actually gave some great prophecies. In fact, uh that's how we know that Moab was an organization. Did you know that? And Israel was not. And an organization and a believer cannot walk together. Numbers 23:9. And Balam's prophecy, he said, "For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him. Lo, the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations." Other words, they weren't a nation with a king and an economy. They were a called out people of God. &gt;&gt; We're called out people of God, &gt;&gt; right? We don't have a headquarters somewhere telling us when to have church, &gt;&gt; right? We're called out people of God. And what that what what that is is denominationalism. It is. And there's nothing else I can say about it. It's a spirit. Maybe good people, but a spirit of denominationalism because that's the doctrine of Balum. Well, we're all the same and and so let's just join ourselves. But we cannot join ourselves with any word but his word. &gt;&gt; Right? Our unity comes first with the word. And that causes us to be in unity with one another. When you see a church that don't fellowship with nobody, they're the only ones that are right. is because they haven't come in unity with the word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If you come in unity with the word, you'll fellowship with your brother and sister &gt;&gt; and have a little have a little uh uh grace for them. Maybe they have a little bit different idea than you do, but you fellowship around the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Listen, it church, it's a shame when people in a local area can't fellowship together with people they believe exactly alike. &gt;&gt; It's a shame, &gt;&gt; right? That's That's not a You say, "Well, we don't fellowship with nobody." That is not a compliment. &gt;&gt; It's an embarrassment. &gt;&gt; Forgive me for being a little bit hard on that, but it's true. Like, we got to fellowship with people, but we fellowship not for the sake of unity alone. We fellowship around the word. &gt;&gt; Right? If I can't preach the message, we don't have no fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But if I can preach the message and you can preach, we may have a little bit different idea of it, but we have a ground of fellowship. Right? &gt;&gt; Something we can fellowship around. &gt;&gt; So true Christians cannot join themselves to idolatry and spiritual fornication. &gt;&gt; Constantine uh in this in this part. So if you look at Constantine, he plays the part of King Bailac in the story of Balum. Constantine bringing them up to the feast. Brother Ram called it the Nyian feast. He brings them up to the feast and calls them up and that was the Nyian council. So Constantine invited the nominal Christian brother said first Christian church of Rome. There were two churches of Rome. The second Christian church of Rome split off the first because the first became idolattors. The first Christian church of Rome he said Constantine invited them to help him get the Christians behind him as they were a very large body. The outcome was that I see council of 325 there. The Christians both true and nominal came together at the invitation of Constantine. So the true ones came too. Brother Brandon said the true Christians had no business going up to the meeting, right? No business going up to that meeting. Why? There was people there they couldn't fellowship with. THEY HOW CAN TWO WALK TOGETHER unless they be agreed? They were not believing the revealed word. They were already worshiping idols, &gt;&gt; right? [snorts] &gt;&gt; Right. Setting them up in churches. &gt;&gt; But he said the real believers, he said, knew they were out of place and left. But to those who remain, Constantine gave the state's treasury along with political and physical force. The people were introduced to idol worship and spiritism. Statues with names of saints were placed in the buildings. People were taught to commune with the dead or pray to saints which is nothing more or less than spiritism. For the food that man truly needs, even the word of God, they were given creeds and dogmas and rituals which were also enforced by the state. And above all, they were given three gods with the triple compound name of the one true God. water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ gave way to the pagan baptism of three titles. But brother Brandham re reinforces the idea that real believers ought not to have gone there. He said but watch this doctrine of Balum. He said it's the deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the people to them by leading the people deliberately into the sin of unbelief. He talked about the nickelan doctrine that being the corruption of clergy. He said, "Balamism is a subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them." I I'm moving fast now, but I want us to get to something here at the end before we go. I won't hold you long tonight. But he he said it was decreed and dogmas formed into church tenants. It was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church. So, they didn't just bring them up for a fellowship meeting and let them go home. They brought them up for a fellowship meeting and then said, "You know, we all need to say the same thing." &gt;&gt; Right? And so when they come to the meeting, then they were forced to say the same thing or be excommunicated. &gt;&gt; And many of them did not. Not everybody who came to the meeting signed up, but they were hunted down, excommunicated, and and exiled. And later on, they would even kill them because they didn't do it. And there were actual fist fights. Did you know that? Fist fights. Santa Claus got in a fist fight. St. Nicholas, who was a Catholic saint, got a this is history supposedly got in a got in a fist fight with somebody at the Nian Council over the doctrine of the Trinity. He was pro- Trinity, by the way. And uh Santa Claus is not an elf that rides around. Am I hurting anybody? I don't want to hurt your Hope you don't teach your kids that. But uh you know Santa Claus is not an elf that rides around and goes all over the world stuff like that. It St. Nicholas was a real person and but he was a Catholic. He was he was on the wrong side of history if you read it. He he actually got in a fist fight with somebody about it. I don't know who won. He had lots of extra padding. He could take a few hits. It's a joke. Sister Sandra got it. So, Brother Brandham said that he said they were not given the true food, the word. Oh, how we should thank God for hearing the word, &gt;&gt; for the hearing of the word. Be able to go to church and hear the word. Be able to turn on a tape and hear the word. We ought to thank God for that. Be able to read our Bibles and see and have the word of God. They didn't even have that. Later on in the dark ages, they even took their Bibles away from them. &gt;&gt; We've got the ability to read it. I I say let's get back into it. Let's read it again. &gt;&gt; Let's find out what's in it. &gt;&gt; So he said Babylonian paganism was wrapped up in Christian terminology. People still do that. &gt;&gt; And that very same spirit and doctrine is right amongst all someone say all &gt;&gt; Protestants and it's called denomination. Nickelanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church thereby deposing the spirit. Balumism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible. And right to this hour, many of God's people are caught in the snare of denominationalism. And God is crying to them, "Come out of her, my people, THAT YOU BE NOT PARTAKERS of her sins, that you receive not of her plagues." &gt;&gt; We're living in a time, there was a time God winked in ignorance. But brother Bram said, "Ignorance will not be a defense to those caught in that system." &gt;&gt; Right? at the end for the clergy to organize themselves with one rank over another until they're finally headed up by a president. Listen to this is a manifestation of the Antichrist spirit. Let me put that in plain language. If there's a pastor somewhere that could tell me what to do or kick me out &gt;&gt; if I didn't do it out of fellowship, then that is a Antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That makes it very plain. But if there's any leadership above the local church, it's not scriptural. &gt;&gt; It's an antichrist spirit. And even the local church as pastor, I serve the people, right? You could vote me out at any point in time. Don't get any ideas, but but you could absolutely could. Right? If the people decided not I wasn't to be the pastor anymore, I wouldn't be the pastor anymore. I I exist at the pleasure of the people and I serve the people, but I got to serve the word first. I believe that's why you would want me to be a pastor because I got to serve the word first. So, we don't cater to people, but we do serve people. &gt;&gt; But if you see someone with rank over another, one rank, so this this person is a pastor, but they're a pastor with more authority. That shouldn't be. &gt;&gt; Right. It's a manifestation of an antichrist spirit regardless of how wonderful and necessary it may seem. &gt;&gt; It is. You say, "Well, it works." It It does. Denomination works. Some of those that have left the message say, "Well, the message is a a mess sometimes because of denomination." I thank God that we're not a denomination. I thank God that I can preach the WORD AND I DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY TELL ME WHAT I'm going to preach on Sunday. I don't HAVE TO HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE TELL me where I can go to church or what I can do or or what time to have church or or what time not to have church. I I don't have anybody telling me that. And and it's up to us as A CHURCH TO DECIDE WHAT WE WANT TO DO. AND we need to stay with the word. &gt;&gt; And that means THAT NO MATTER WHAT OTHER CHURCHES in the MESSAGE DO, LET'S STAY WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; LET'S SAY WHAT A PROPHET SAID, let's believe the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; No matter what anybody else does. &gt;&gt; But thank God when we can have fellowship, right? That's wonderful. But but our church is not governed by any other church. And it's it's the Holy Spirit is to be the leader of the church. Is that right? &gt;&gt; We all we all have to submit to the Holy Spirit and leading the church and who he places in in in position in the church. Brother Bram said it's nothing but human reasoning taking the place of the word. And any person who's in the organized denomination is right in the midst of an antichrist system. He said, "Let me say this, make it very plain. I'm not against the people. I'm against the system. &gt;&gt; That doctrine of balamism led the church into a dark age. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said when any religious people embrace both nickelanism and balamism and has the political, financial, and physical power to back it up, there's only one direction they can go. Do you see? Look, go look at the dark ages. Study that and see what they became. &gt;&gt; Do you see where we're at? &gt;&gt; It's looked innocent for a while, but we're right back there again. another na, &gt;&gt; right? That's what they're trying to do. And that's the way they come in the first time. &gt;&gt; They come in with flatteries and they said, "We're all one. Let's all get along. Let's have a feast. Let's have a counsel." And they weren't. That's exactly what they're doing right now. And brother, it's a Jezebel doctrine as well. You find that in in Revelation 2 and three. But chapter 2 and chapter 3, it was now the church with the assured voice. He said that took over. So before they were scattered, but now they spoke with one voice. There's power in unity, right? There's power in unity in the local church. But they had power in a unity under a false word, under a dogma and a decree. So they they spoke with one voice and wow with power they drank the blood of the martyrs until the true Christians were all but exterminated and there was hardly any word left and little manifestation of the Holy Ghost. I love this. But the true vine struggled and survived. &gt;&gt; That's the story OF MY LIFE. STRUGGLE AND SURVIVE. YOU MIGHT BE FACING a dark TIME RIGHT NOW. YOU MIGHT HAVE EVERYTHING AGAINST YOU. But but Christianity was illegal at ONE POINT. WE COULDN'T EVEN HAVE BIBLES. We couldn't do that. BUT THE TRUE VINE STRUGGLED AND SURVIVED IN THE DARKEST PART OF THE DARK AGES. SOMEBODY MADE IT. I BELIEVE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO MAKE IT OUT OF LEODYSIA. Might as well be us. &gt;&gt; The true vine struggled and survived. Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT BE FACING THE WORST MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE, BUT THE TRUE VINE STRUGGLES and survives. Oh, I think of those in the hospital tonight and those not able to be here. THOSE THAT ARE SICK. YOU MIGHT BE SICK, BUT THE TRUE VINE struggles and survives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What's going to happen to this current push for another ecumenical council? Well, brother Brandham told us he said this ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head. &gt;&gt; Even though the people did not envision it that way. This is so because in Revelation 17:3-6, it states that the mystery Babylon, is seated on the beast. She's controlling the last or fourth empire. That's is that's Daniel's vision. Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the of the uh four gentile kingdoms. He said the fourth empire, the Roman church is doing that with the world church system under her. Rome will be controlling this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world. [snorts] He said, "Thus all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell." This is where it's headed to cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or head. This mark in the head means they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system. So, I know a lot of people say, "Well, the mark's going to be a chip. It's going to be this or that." Brother Brandham told us what it was going to be. He said it's the what it is. He said they take the doctrine of the world church system, which is trinitarianism, etc., and the mark in the hand which means to do the will of the world church with this great power the church systems will persecute the true bride listen what they'll do during the persecution this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching &gt;&gt; the image will the protestants will &gt;&gt; right people think the Catholics have to take over brother Random said in 1960 said they already have &gt;&gt; he said they already have he said this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching. Her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it. You see why we we we strike at that spirit that would do that because we we we we are commanded by the word to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Commanded to do it. &gt;&gt; And it's the image of the beast that'll try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching. &gt;&gt; But he said, "But before the antichrist in person before, that's the part I like. before takes over this complete world system of churches. The true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. THAT'S MY FUTURE. I'M NOT looking to be shut up. I'm looking to go up. &gt;&gt; Amen. The true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb. Aren't you looking forward to it? Notice brother Brand said, "Lucifer comes in cunning like he did then and by temptations and false promises of power apart from the word of God. He did the same at Na Rome. He's doing the same today. He's doing the same today at the World Council of Ecumenical Churches." I read to you, I didn't bring the uh the article tonight to save time, but I read to you back a few months ago how the World Council was gathering again this year to honor Nika. And they actually said, "Let's all unite together." and they get together and I I actually I think I did print them. They're probably laying on the printer back here, but I well I put part of it on there. The global ecumenical gathering in Egypt, advanced hopes for visible church unity. When we talked about what's going to happen this year, it happened. They gathered in Egypt and that's the council of bishops of the United Methodist Church. I found the Anglican church and different ones, all the mainline churches, even Pentecostal churches that came together in ecumenical. was the most significant gathering of the World Council of Churches since 1960. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is what brother Brandon was talking about. He saw the beginning of it. I believe we're seeing the end of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "Let's all unite together." The Pope says, "I want all my ecumenical brethren out there to unite with me. We're one." That's right. In organizations, you are one. But that has nothing to do with the bride of Christ. Not a thing, brother. You'll never wash her in anything like that. Oh, it's going home time, church. It's harvest time. I know some people say, "Well, that's boring preaching. It don't mean anything." It ought to mean something to the bride because we're not a part of that world system. WE'VE BEEN CALLED OUT OF THAT. IT OUGHT TO BRING A THANKFULNESS TO OUR heart &gt;&gt; to know where we're at, what time it is. Amen. What hour it is, it's harvest time. The seeds that have been sown, Brother said, denominational seeds were sown. An ecumenical seed was sown in the 60s and it's coming to maturity. &gt;&gt; Yes. But he told us he said IF THOSE SEEDS ARE COMING TO MATURITY THEN THE BRIDE SEED HAS GOT TO COME TO MATURITY AS WELL. THE WORD HAS GOT TO COME TO maturity at the same time. &gt;&gt; The wheat and the tears he said was from the first age until now grown side by side are harvested. What na this is powerful set out to accomplish has finally come to pass. That's where they're headed to. With all the might of organization, the false church turns away from any vestage of truth and with political might reinforces herself with state backing and sets out to eradicate forever the true believer. But just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot, oh my, the wheat is gathered into the garner. &gt;&gt; I've had people ask me, "Aren't you afraid to be on the internet, be open like you are?" Well, they got your number anyway. &gt;&gt; They know where we're at, &gt;&gt; but they know where we're at. But look, but look at it like this. Like they're I'll be glad to give them my address because when they come looking for me to do this, when their cowardly plot comes into effect, I ain't going to be here. &gt;&gt; If I'm here, we got bigger problems, &gt;&gt; right? But I thank God. I believe I'm part of the bride that's going home. Aren't you glad to be part OF THE BRIDE? SO, THIS IS NOT A NEGATIVE THING. It's a positive thing. WE DON'T PREACH FEAR AND AND JUDGMENT, ALL THESE THINGS. SAY, "WELL, you oh, you better be scared cuz the end times ARE COMING." NO, WE OUGHT TO BE REJOICE. HE SAID, "LIFT UP YOUR HEADS. LOOK UP. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD FOR YOUR redemption drawth nigh." &gt;&gt; Amen. See the Bible says, "Thou hast kept the word of thy because thou has kept the word of thy patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, &gt;&gt; which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth." Brother said, "This temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden." Exactly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me for just about five minutes, but before we close, &gt;&gt; this temptation is exactly like the temptation in Eden. What was the temptation in Eden? Surely, surely God doesn't care. Surely you won't die if you cross the word. &gt;&gt; Exactly like that. &gt;&gt; It'll be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word. And yet from the standpoint of human reasoning, oh church, young people, do you realize that if you reason with the word of God, that reasoning will seem to be right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It'll seem like, WELL, IT JUST MAKES SENSE. Brother Brandon was just oldfashioned. &gt;&gt; The message is just oldfashioned. He just lived in another. It just makes sense for us to be different than he was. And and and to have a different opinion about this or a different opinion about that or or our pastor may he's just an old fogy. But we got to this we better be careful how we reason with the word &gt;&gt; because he said it'll from the standpoint of human reasoning, IT'LL BE SO VERY RIGHT. &gt;&gt; YEAH. IT WILL MAKE SENSE. &gt;&gt; So enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world. &gt;&gt; That's why you got so-called message churches that cut their hair and wear pants. &gt;&gt; One right now that I know of, the people they say, "Well, there's nothing wrong with earrings." Just Brother Brandham's opinion. So the women are wearing earrings, &gt;&gt; cutting their hair. &gt;&gt; So-called message church. &gt;&gt; The pastor won't read quotes in the pulpit because it might offend somebody. Oh church, the temptation, the hour of temptation. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to look for some uh you know, economic hardship to come. It may come. I don't doubt that it will. But I'll say this, right now is the hardest time that's ever been because it's the most deceptive time. &gt;&gt; If the economy crashed, we wouldn't have no trouble keeping people in church. The biggest reason why people don't come to church more I didn't mean it's Wednesday night. I'm not I'm not scolding you. But you know why the biggest reason why people don't come to church is they have too much money. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about those that are sick or whatever, but it's the truth. How do you know that? Well, because I've been to Africa. I've been to the Philippines and been places where they didn't have any money and they go to church all the time because they got nothing better to do. I'm that way too, right? I'm including myself in that. We live in Leodosia. We got to live here. There's nothing wrong with with living and and enjoying your money if you have it, but make sure you do the necessary things. &gt;&gt; Because this is the hour of temptation. &gt;&gt; You y'all forgive me tonight. I don't mean to to scold you. &gt;&gt; I always hate a preacher that preaches on church attendance on Wednesday night. [snorts] To believe the devil's lie, Brother Brhamstead said, is to serve Satan. &gt;&gt; Even though you may want to call him Jehovah, but the elect will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that. It's a terrible age. It's a deceptive age. BUT THE ELECT WILL NOT BE DECEIVED. Brother Brandon said, "I'd be a very a very discouraged man if it wasn't for predestination." Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Furthermore, the elect will not only be kept, but as this move becomes the image erected to the beast, the saints will be gone &gt;&gt; in the rapture." &gt;&gt; This is the hour of temptation. 200 million demons trying to say the message doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; Why? Why do you say that, brother Ben? Well, it's because of this quote in the feast of the trumpets. Brother Brandham said, "Now she's loosed." talking about those 200 million demons that are loosed to call all these little loose ends. Oh well, don't make any difference anyhow. &gt;&gt; The loose ends. Remember what that was? If you go to Revelation 10:7 said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; is everybody awake? &gt;&gt; I'm closing. The days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, all the mysteries of God will be finished. &gt;&gt; That word finished means all the loose ends will be tied up. &gt;&gt; Right? all the loose ends will be tied up. &gt;&gt; She's loosed. You realize what that is? 200 million demons is more than one per person for message people. &gt;&gt; Think about that for a minute. They're loosed. Brother Bren said they're not loose on the church, &gt;&gt; not loosed on the world. They're loose on the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? to call all those little loose ends. Oh well, don't make any difference. Don't make any difference. We better watch before we say that. &gt;&gt; You realize you're fighting a spiritual battle. Our children are fighting a spiritual battle. Our teens are fighting a spiritual battle. Our married couples are fighting a spiritual battle. Our older saints are fighting a spiritual battle. &gt;&gt; I I I see this a lot, especially with our young people. And it seems like that we're trying to fight spiritual battles in a natural way. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we're just trying to we're just trying to bluff our way through it or or or say, "Well, I got this spirit of discouragement on me." Well, it's probably one of them demons. my wife, bless her heart, um, sorry, Britney, we were uh we were in the house today, I think, and the dogs got to fussing over food and and our little dog, he just comes after the bigger dog, and then the bigger dog could kill him, you know, so we had to pull him apart. But little dog can't do nothing, but he comes after the big dog and and because he don't know he's little and he he come after him and Britney drags that dog away and she spanks him real good, the little dog. And she says, she says, "You stop that." She said, "That's a demon." It may have been. I guess there were demons in the pigs. But I wonder how many times devils, you know, sit on our shoulder, tell us we're not good enough, we're not going to make it. &gt;&gt; Tell you young people to take your own lives. &gt;&gt; You've been driving drive driving down the road one day and you you say, "How do you know this, Brother Ben?" I've dealt with that. &gt;&gt; Drive down the road and you say, "I might as well just drive off. Nobody cares anyway." It's one of them devils. &gt;&gt; Get to a place where you think, "Well, I might as well not go to church. Nobody cares if I go to church. Doesn't matter." You're going to fight that battle. &gt;&gt; How How do you fight it? How do you fight that? You're You're not as strong as the enemy, but with him, you you're more than enough. But see, Ephesians 6 tells us how to fight it. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws. That's the deception. &gt;&gt; Word ws is deception, the ws of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. We we get to going through stuff and we want to blame somebody for it. But it may not be the pastor's fault. It may not be the church's FAULT. IT MAY NOT BE OUR husband or our wife's fault. It may just be spiritual wickedness in high places. &gt;&gt; Wherefore, how do we combat that? BUT BEN, TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE ARMOR of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day. and having done all to stand. He goes on to say, "Stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having having that shield of faith and the sword of the spirit, which is the word OF GOD." WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU PICKED UP THE SWORD of the spirit and fought A BATTLE WITH IT? WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HELD UP THAT FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD AND SAID, "I WILL NOT BE MOVED. I AM GOING TO MAKE IT. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. I'M MORE THAN ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT OUT OF THIS senior age." Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT THAT BATTLE. THIS IS THE HOUR of temptation. He said he'll keep us. He'll keep us in the hour of [snorts] temptation and he will keep us from the tribulation. What is your shield? Faith in the word. Read your Bible and pray. Those instructions come to us. If there ever been an age when we needed to run to him, &gt;&gt; it's this day. Young people, run to him. &gt;&gt; Run to him. Don't be afraid to confess your faults one to another and pray one for another. &gt;&gt; Run to him. Run to the house of God. &gt;&gt; He's our shelter. He's our peace. Run. Run to the word of God. Our elders, run to the word of God. The doctor can have their say, but run to the word of God. It says, "I'm the Lord thy God that heals all thy diseases." &gt;&gt; Run to the word of God. Run to the word of God. says, "Call for the elders of the church and a prayer of faith shall save the sick." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Run to the word of God. What's your shield? Faith in the word, read your Bible and pray. Musicians, go ahead and come. Listen to the message. There was an hour to know what's coming. You want to know what's coming? You look at the papers, see this stuff coming? I just read to you. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon told us it would come. And here we see it directly happening just like he said it would happen. Them trying to bring their doctrine down to match Protestant doctrine. Standing there at the council of Nika and they recited the Nyian creed together which states the doctrine of the trinity together the Greek church the eastern church and the western church coming together for the first time in history. It just happened this week. Where we at church? It's time to pick up that sword, pick up that shield. It's time for family to start praying together again. It's time for people to start searching their hearts. And I want to be right. I I don't want to be left out. I don't want to be in that denominational group. I want to be right. We want to love everybody. But we cannot afford to give up on the word we've been given. Cannot afford to change what the prophet said. I don't care who says it. We can't afford to change what a prophet taught us this hour because it's exactly the truth. We're predestined, brother Bram said, to this great glorious stand. He said, "There will be a bride that will not fall." Well, I believe I'm a member of that bride, brother Stewart. That's why there's something in me, SOMETHING IN YOU THAT HUNGERS for the word of God. WE WANT TO KNOW these things. We want to HEAR IT. WE WE want to be told where we're at and and what to do about it. WE WE WE HUNGER FOR THE WORD BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE. Oh my. Oh, I pray there's a hunger inside of you. Maybe the world has dealed that with every head b every head bowed and every eyes eye closed. Maybe the world has dulled that hunger for the word. But I believe it's still there. I I believe if you just take a moment and talk to him, he'll he'll talk to you and he'll say, "You're my child and it's time to get right. It's time to stop playing church. I don't know how this turned into an evangelistic thought, but I believe it's time. Run to him. Just strikes in my heart tonight. Lord, help me. Help me, Lord. Run to you, Lord. Father, there's still time, heavenly father. Lord, as we're thinking on these things and Lord, as we let the word soak in now and we begin to water it with our praise, I I pray, God, that you'd help us to run, Lord, the race with patience that you'd set before us, help us to hold up that shield of faith, Lord, to fight spiritual battles with spiritual things, comparing scriptural things with scriptural. I pray you'd help us, Lord, not to reason in our own minds, but to believe the word of God, to accept it for our lives. Lord, whatever you have for us, I pray that we would be that way and do that. And Lord, we don't want to be so odd just to be odd. But Lord, if the word makes us odd, Lord, we'll be we'll be an oddball to the world. We'll be different. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. Pray you'd keep us balanced. Keep us on the straight and narrow. Keep us ready planting our potatoes, building our church, doing the things we need to do, Lord. But we believe your coming is very close. I pray you'd grant us it today. We thank you for all that you've done. I pray the word would just sink down into every heart, Lord, that there'd be such a hunger for your word that we wouldn't have to wouldn't have to call people together. They just want to come together and fellowship around it and talk about it and call one another on the phones. It wasn't what in the word wonderful and what I just read, what I just heard. And I pray it be so, Lord. Let it be in our hearts, oh God. is the Bible says that the word of Christ dwell in you richly and all wisdom singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs may be so Lord. May it be the song of our heart, the song on our lips. I pray you'd grant it now. We thank you, Lord, as we worship you, Lord. If there's anything in us that's not right, cleanse us, oh God. Cleanse me. Forgive me, Lord. Help me, oh God. I humble myself today and Lord, forgive me if I've done anything that's wrong. I pray, Lord, that there'd be a mighty outpouring of your spirit. or maybe there'd be something that I should have done, I didn't do. I pray you'd forgive me, Lord, and show me. I'll do it. Pray you'd grant it, Lord. We thank you for your word. Thank you for the conviction that I feel here in this place. For your spirit that we feel. I pray that it would never leave us, Lord. May we never go back to dead, dry, cold, formal churches. That's what Na came and brought. Lord, may we have this presence of God right here with us. I pray you'd grant it. We thank you for it. In Jesus' name we ask. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why don't we just stand and worship him tonight? I believe he's here. &gt;&gt; If you have a need, just lift it up to him. You're welcome to come to the altar and pray. Glad to pray with you. &gt;&gt; For all is well. Oh, you believe it's well. Let them do what they want to do. They're not going to find me. I'll be gone. All is well. Oh, I thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for your word. Oh, all is well. Oh, hallelujah. We [singing] have heard. Oh, we have heard the message. Shalom. Glory [singing] to God.

[singing] &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; And if we [music] can trust him, &gt;&gt; we [singing] will find that all is well. Sing it together now with all your heart before we go. Oh, all is well.
