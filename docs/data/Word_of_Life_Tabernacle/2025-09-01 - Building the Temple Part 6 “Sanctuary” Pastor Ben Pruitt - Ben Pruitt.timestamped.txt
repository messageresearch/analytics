[43:05] Let's stand together.
[43:08] We enjoyed our specials this morning.
[43:09] Aren't you thankful?
[43:11] And I tell you,
[43:14] it's not all about feeling good in
[43:16] church, but it ain't it ain't nothing
[43:17] wrong with feeling good in church. And
[43:19] when you know he's here, aren't you
[43:20] thankful that he's here this morning.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this one here. We'll
[43:24] speed it up just for a second and then
[43:25] we'll before we change the order of the
[43:27] service. Well, I feel like praising
[43:31] praising him.
[43:34] Oh, I feel like I praise him. Praise
[43:39] him. I'll sing it now. Oh, praise him in
[43:44] the morning.
[43:46] Praise him.
[43:49] Oh, I feel like praising praising him.
[43:56] Well, why don't you praise the Lord
[43:59] while you have a chance?
[44:03] Oh, why don't you praise the Lord while
[44:07] you have a chance?
[44:10] Oh, just praise him.
[44:14] Won't you praise him?
[44:17] Oh yes, I feel like praising praising
[44:21] him.
[44:24] Oh yes, I feel like praising praising
[44:28] him.
[44:31] Oh, I feel that praise him. Praise him.
[44:37] Oh, won't you praise him?
[44:41] Won't you praise him?
[44:44] Oh, yes. I feel that praise him.
[44:50] Sing it like this. Oh, if you don't
[44:53] praise the Lord, it won't be me.
[44:58] Oh, if you don't praise the Lord, it
[45:02] won't heal me.
[45:05] Oh, just praise him.
[45:09] Won't you praise him?
[45:12] Oh yes, I feel that praise him. Oh, sing
[45:16] with all your hearts now. Oh yes, I feel
[45:21] that.
[45:23] [Music]
[45:26] I
[45:28] pray.
[45:30] [Music]
[45:36] Won't you?
[45:39] Oh yes, I
[45:42] praise him. Oh, why don't you praise the
[45:44] Lord while you have a chance this
[45:45] morning? Well, why don't you praise the
[45:48] Lord?
[45:51] Sing it now.
[45:53] Oh, why don't you praise the Lord while
[45:56] you have changed?
[45:59] Oh, just praise him.
[46:03] Won't you praise him?
[46:06] Oh yes, I
[46:08] praise him. One more time, clap your
[46:10] hands and sing it now. Oh yes, I feel
[46:15] crazy.
[46:17] Let me hear you sing it now.
[46:22] [Music]
[46:24] Yes, we do. Oh, just praise him.
[46:29] Won't you praise him?
[46:32] Oh, yes. I feel like praising praising
[46:37] him.
[46:38] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[46:40] praise this morning.
[46:43] Amen. Are you ready for the word of the
[46:44] Lord? Amen. You You've worshiped the
[46:47] Lord. Amen. And I it's a preparation to
[46:49] go into battle. Brother Bram taught us
[46:51] that when we sing songs, we're we're
[46:53] getting in the spirit to where we could
[46:56] actually go forth and we can we can
[46:57] whoop every devil this morning. When you
[46:59] when you sing songs to him, Amen, you're
[47:02] just getting your morale all built up.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Where you can get ready to worship God
[47:06] in the in the way that he would have it
[47:08] to be this morning. Amen. Do you believe
[47:10] he's here?
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you say, "Well, I don't
[47:12] feel him." Well, I guarantee you he's
[47:14] here this morning because you're here.
[47:15] And if you're here, there's a promise
[47:17] that he's here. Aren't you thankful for
[47:19] it? Somebody give the Lord a hand clap
[47:21] of praise this morning.
[47:24] Amen. I know this is kind of an altar
[47:26] call song, but I believe if he's here, I
[47:29] don't want him to pass me by. How about
[47:30] you this morning? I wonder if we could
[47:33] just make out our prayer this morning as
[47:34] the word goes forth. Lord, don't pass me
[47:36] by. Wall on others. Thou art calling. Do
[47:40] not pass me by. I want us to sing this
[47:42] with all of our hearts as our pastor
[47:44] comes to bring the word now. Amen. If
[47:46] you and if this is your prayer, I want
[47:47] you to just put a hand up to him.
[47:50] Oh, pass
[47:53] me not.
[47:56] Oh gentle
[47:58] save,
[48:04] won't you hear
[48:08] my humble
[48:12] cry?
[48:17] Oh,
[48:19] why
[48:22] all mothers
[48:25] thou
[48:26] are calling?
[48:29] [Music]
[48:32] Oh, do
[48:36] not pass
[48:39] me. If that's your prayer, sing it like
[48:42] you mean it now.
[48:44] Oh, I'm calling on you, Savior.
[48:53] Oh, my Savior.
[48:56] [Music]
[49:00] Won't you hear
[49:02] my
[49:04] heart?
[49:13] Oh, and while
[49:17] all others
[49:19] thou art.
[49:22] [Music]
[49:27] Oh, do
[49:30] not pass
[49:34] me. I like this verse here. Let's sing
[49:36] it just before we turn it to the pastor.
[49:41] Oh, let
[49:44] me be at thy throne
[49:48] of mercy.
[49:55] Find
[49:58] a sweet.
[50:02] [Music]
[50:07] Oh,
[50:09] [Applause]
[50:10] [Music]
[50:12] they
[50:14] indeed
[50:16] contrition.
[50:21] Lord, help
[50:25] my
[50:28] need.
[50:29] One more time with your hands raised to
[50:31] him now. Savior. Savior.
[50:34] Oh, I'm calling on you, Savior.
[50:38] [Music]
[50:41] Oh my precious.
[50:44] [Music]
[51:00] [Music]
[51:00] [Applause]
[51:07] other.
[51:09] [Music]
[51:14] Oh, please say that this morning

[51:29] Christ.
[51:32] [Music]
[51:36] Oh,
[51:40] Savior.
[51:46] [Music]
[51:54] Oh sing.
[51:58] Oh yes.
[52:02] Now our call
[52:06] while you're calling
[52:08] [Music]
[52:10] to
[52:13] not pass
[52:16] me
[52:17] now.
[52:20] Lord, aren't you glad that Aren't you
[52:22] glad that he is there and he won't pass
[52:25] you by if you ask him? He said, "If you
[52:27] call on me, I'll I'll hear you." I'm so
[52:30] glad for that promise today. He would
[52:32] hear our prayers. Let's just go to him
[52:34] in prayer right now. Maybe you've got a
[52:36] need by you can make by way of uplifting
[52:39] hand, make known, and God knows your
[52:41] heart. He said, "I'll hear you when you
[52:43] call on me. My people who are called by
[52:45] my name will humble themselves and pray
[52:48] and hear from heaven. I will hear from
[52:51] heaven. I will heal their land. We
[52:53] believe that today. I believe that
[52:54] promise is true. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[52:57] you see the needs rep represented by
[52:59] hands all across the building. I pray
[53:01] God that you'd just move in a mighty
[53:02] way. I pray that Lord that that people
[53:05] would know that you're with them. Oh
[53:07] God, that you're here. You hear their
[53:08] prayer, Lord. You're not a God of far
[53:11] off, but your your arm is not short.
[53:13] you're able to answer, Lord, every
[53:15] request that we would make. I pray you'd
[53:17] meet every physical need, every
[53:19] spiritual need, every financial need.
[53:22] Lord, you you know how to do it. I pray
[53:24] you would do it today. We thank you for
[53:26] what you've done for us, Lord. We thank
[53:28] you for your goodness and your mercy.
[53:30] Lord, we give you praise this morning
[53:32] for the presence that we felt. I pray we
[53:35] would do nothing to grieve that, Lord. I
[53:37] pray that you'd move now in this
[53:38] service. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[53:43] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[53:46] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[53:49] Amen. Isn't God good to us this morning?
[53:52] You're glad to be in the presence of the
[53:53] Lord, be in the house of the Lord. We
[53:56] want to go to Exodus 15:17. Exodus 15:17
[54:01] and Isaiah 8. Isaiah 8:14. Exodus 15:17.
[54:07] And then Isaiah 8:14.
[54:16] trip. I didn't have that on on my body
[54:18] pack, so that's why that wasn't working.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Sorry about that. Sometimes we we tend
[54:24] to make mistakes. I just have this on my
[54:27] mind. I got something on my heart today
[54:28] I want to get to. We won't get to it
[54:30] right at the beginning, but if you'll
[54:32] just bear with me and as we go into
[54:34] this, I just believe it'll be a blessing
[54:36] to us. Exodus 15:17. As we continue to
[54:40] talk about the building of the the
[54:41] temple,
[54:43] it says, "Thou shalt bring them in and
[54:47] plant them in the mountain of thine
[54:49] inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which
[54:52] thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in
[54:55] the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands
[54:59] have established." Isaiah 8:14
[55:04] says, "And he shall be for a sanctuary."
[55:08] Oh, I'm thankful for that today.
[55:11] But for a stone of stumbling and for a
[55:14] rock of offense to both the houses of
[55:16] Israel, to both the houses of Israel,
[55:19] for a jin, that's a trap and for a snare
[55:22] to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. He
[55:25] would be that stone that the builders
[55:27] rejected. Pray the Lord would add his
[55:28] blessing to the word. You may be seated
[55:31] this morning.
[55:33] A sanctuary is a consecrated place where
[55:37] deity dwells and where sacred objects
[55:40] are kept and worship takes place. A
[55:44] consecrated place for deity to dwell.
[55:47] It's actually a very strange uh thing if
[55:50] you think about it because it's men
[55:53] making a house,
[55:55] men who are fallible, men who make
[55:58] mistakes, men who are are limited by
[56:02] humanity making a house for a
[56:05] incomprehensible, infallible, omniresent
[56:09] God,
[56:10] &gt;&gt; right? And we're going to make a house
[56:12] for that God. And yet he allowed them to
[56:14] do that. What for? So they would have a
[56:18] place of worship, a place to worship. So
[56:22] we we know that uh our worship is in
[56:25] Christ. How many believe that today?
[56:27] That's the the only place where we can
[56:29] worship is in Christ. We found that our
[56:32] Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, was
[56:35] the sanctuary, the temple of God,
[56:38] dedicated for the purpose of redemption.
[56:40] In Acts 7:49, he said, "Heaven is my
[56:43] throne and earth is my foottool." He
[56:46] said, "What house will you build me?
[56:48] Sayeth the Lord. What is the place of my
[56:50] rest?" See, as magnificent as the temple
[56:54] was, as the sanctuary of that temple
[56:56] was, it was only a shadow of God's true
[56:59] sanctuary, who was his son. Hebrews
[57:02] 10:5, "Wherefore, when he cometh into
[57:04] the world, he saith, sacrifice an
[57:06] offering that wouldest not, but a body
[57:09] hast thou prepared me." And so, that was
[57:12] his ultimate sanctuary was Christ. And
[57:15] so the pattern o of the sanctuary was
[57:18] important because it's what God had in
[57:20] his mind and it's a type or a shadow of
[57:24] what Christ would be. So we went through
[57:26] that how that uh the pattern was given
[57:28] to Moses and then it was given to David
[57:31] by inspiration of what God uh had showed
[57:34] him what what it would be. And I think
[57:36] I've got a picture on there of the of
[57:39] the of the tabernacle in the wilderness.
[57:41] This is actually what was showed to
[57:42] Moses and he built it exactly according
[57:46] to the specifications what God told him.
[57:48] You can see that there's three parts,
[57:50] three main parts to it. There's an outer
[57:53] court uh which is the part within the uh
[57:56] the courtyard there. There's an inner
[57:59] court which or a holy place which is
[58:01] inside the the tabernacle itself. And
[58:04] inside of that is a holiest place or a
[58:07] holy of holies. the holy place was where
[58:11] uh the ark of the covenant would be and
[58:12] and the cherubam and those things. So it
[58:15] just kind of keep that that in your mind
[58:17] as a mental picture this morning.
[58:19] Brother Brandham tells us he said now
[58:21] all the feast, the holidays, the
[58:24] tabernacle, all the wood, everything in
[58:28] the tabernacle, he said everything typed
[58:32] Christ. Everything typed Christ. He is
[58:36] the tabernacle of God. He is the
[58:39] sanctuary of God. Then I believe we
[58:41] ought to worship him in that place.
[58:43] Worship in his name this morning. That's
[58:45] what we ought to do. Hebrews chapter 9
[58:48] and verse one says, "Then verily the
[58:50] first covenant had also ordinances of
[58:52] divine service and a worldly sanctuary."
[58:56] He said, "For there was a tabernacle
[58:58] made. The first wherein was the
[58:59] candlestick and the table and the
[59:01] shoebre which is called the sanctuary.
[59:04] And after the second veil, the
[59:05] tabernacle which is called the holiest
[59:07] of all." So Paul is walking you through
[59:09] the the tabernacle. He said there was a
[59:11] tabernacle. He said then there was the
[59:13] candlestick and the table and the
[59:14] shoebread. He said and then another
[59:16] veil. He said and the tabernacle which
[59:18] is called the holiest of all which had
[59:21] the golden sensor and the ark of the
[59:22] covenant overlaid round about with gold
[59:25] wherein was the golden pot that had mana
[59:27] and Aaron's rod that budded and the
[59:30] tables of the covenant. It it was within
[59:32] this sanctuary that the supernatural
[59:35] happened all the time.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Right. There was supernatural on the
[59:39] outside, things that God would do to
[59:42] show himself present. But within the
[59:44] sanctuary was where the supernatural was
[59:47] taking place all the time. You realize
[59:49] that's a type of us, body, spirit, and
[59:51] soul that that it's actually on the
[59:54] outside we feel his presence, but
[59:56] sometimes we don't feel it. Sometimes we
[59:58] we we we're affected by different
[1:00:00] things, but on the inside, in the soul,
[1:00:02] in the holy place, that's where God
[1:00:04] dwells. And in there, there's
[1:00:06] supernatural all the time. No matter if
[1:00:08] you're sick, no matter if you're going
[1:00:10] through a hard time, no matter if it's
[1:00:12] difficult right now in the place where
[1:00:14] you're living in on the the soul's okay,
[1:00:16] I want to tell you that this morning.
[1:00:18] The holy place there there's a
[1:00:19] supernatural presence of God. The
[1:00:22] shikina dwells in the holy place,
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; right? and and and when he is there, the
[1:00:27] the mana is kept fresh and the and
[1:00:30] Aaron's rod is alive and bringing forth
[1:00:33] fruit.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word is a reality, not
[1:00:38] just dead letter inside the holy place.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And over at the cherubams of glory
[1:00:45] shadowing the mercy seat, he said of
[1:00:47] which we cannot now speak particularly.
[1:00:50] And Paul goes on, I won't read all that
[1:00:52] chapter, but he goes on to say, "The
[1:00:53] priests went in once a year to offer a
[1:00:55] sacrifice which shows a way had not been
[1:00:58] made into the holy place because not all
[1:01:00] the people could go in." But tells us in
[1:01:02] I believe it's in Revelation chapter 5,
[1:01:04] he tells us that the people long to go
[1:01:06] in. He said they got so upset because
[1:01:09] they couldn't go in. They watched the
[1:01:10] priests go in and they long to do the
[1:01:12] same thing. But you and I can go in
[1:01:15] today.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Even more than that, we must go in.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. So away had not been made
[1:01:22] into the holy place, but verse 11, but
[1:01:23] Christ being come a high priest of good
[1:01:26] things to come, by a greater and more
[1:01:28] perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
[1:01:30] that is to say, not of this building,
[1:01:32] neither by the blood of goats and
[1:01:34] calves, but by his own blood, he entered
[1:01:36] in once into the holy place, having
[1:01:39] obtained eternal redemption for us.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Eternal redemption for us.
[1:01:46] for the blood of bulls and of goats and
[1:01:48] the ashes of a heer sprinkling the
[1:01:50] unclean sanctified through the purifying
[1:01:52] of the flesh. How much more shall the
[1:01:54] blood of Christ who through the eternal
[1:01:56] spirit offered himself without spot to
[1:01:58] God purge your conscience from dead
[1:02:00] works to serve the living God. The Lord
[1:02:03] give you a desire to do the right thing.
[1:02:06] And for this cause he is the mediator of
[1:02:08] the New Testament, that by means of
[1:02:10] death, for the redemption of the
[1:02:11] transgressions that were under the first
[1:02:13] testament, they which are called might
[1:02:15] receive the promise of eternal
[1:02:17] inheritance. I don't know if that means
[1:02:19] anything to you. You can look there sit
[1:02:21] there and say, "Brother Ben, what are
[1:02:22] you excited about? I'm excited that he
[1:02:24] is the temple. I'm excited about the
[1:02:26] fact he is our tabernacle. He's the
[1:02:28] place where the presence of God is. And
[1:02:30] if he is in my heart, then I become the
[1:02:32] tabernacle of God."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:35] Amen. He is the true tabernacle, the
[1:02:38] sanctuary of God. Colossians 2:9 says,
[1:02:39] "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:02:43] the godhead bodily,
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; not just a part of God, a portion of
[1:02:48] God, all of God."
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So, the tabernacle, as we said in
[1:02:53] Exodus, have been built by the hands of
[1:02:54] fallible men. Yet, we know that Jehovah
[1:02:58] was pleased to dwell in that place.
[1:03:02] How
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; how do we know that?
[1:03:05] Because when they dedicated it,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; when they finished the work, his shikina
[1:03:11] presence came down and dwelt in that
[1:03:15] tabernacle.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; See, if it hadn't happened, all their
[1:03:20] preparation would have been in vain.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen to me this morning
[1:03:26] and listen close. We can we can live a
[1:03:28] good life. if we can pay our tithes, go
[1:03:30] to church and do everything just right,
[1:03:33] but and everything think we think we got
[1:03:35] everything just the way he wants it. But
[1:03:37] if that shikina presence doesn't come
[1:03:39] down and indwell our hearts, then we
[1:03:42] need to we need to go back and find out
[1:03:44] because there's something there that's
[1:03:45] not right or or or he would come down
[1:03:47] and indwell it. And most of the time
[1:03:49] what it is, it's not a lack of works
[1:03:51] because you can't work your way in, but
[1:03:53] it's a lack of faith of really
[1:03:55] surrendering and believing and giving
[1:03:57] our all to God.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Because when we do exactly what he tells
[1:04:01] us to do, when we obey the word, brother
[1:04:04] said, full obedience to the word of God,
[1:04:06] to the full word of God entitles us to
[1:04:08] the token. So if we follow the pattern
[1:04:10] and believed on Christ, then we must
[1:04:12] have the Holy Spirit indwelling us. And
[1:04:15] and if we don't, it's usually because,
[1:04:17] you know, there's something there.
[1:04:19] There's some there's some stubbornness
[1:04:21] in our heart,
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; right? And I'm just going to
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; We talked about election and
[1:04:28] predestination on Wednesday night. And
[1:04:30] those of you that were here, you can go
[1:04:32] and listen to it. And we talked about
[1:04:33] how you can't be lost and all of those
[1:04:35] things. Now, we're going to take this
[1:04:37] morning. I'm going to challenge you just
[1:04:38] a little bit
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; because there's got to be, if you are
[1:04:42] the elected, you're going to follow the
[1:04:43] word. Yeah.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Right. We're we're the elect who follow
[1:04:46] the word
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; and and and so we got to keep the word
[1:04:49] and and and and usually it's a
[1:04:52] stubbornness in our heart that doesn't
[1:04:54] allow that presence of God to come in.
[1:04:56] But I just want to say this morning,
[1:04:58] Lord, help me to surrender. Help me to
[1:05:00] give in. Help me to help me to walk but
[1:05:02] to say Lord whatever you want me to do
[1:05:04] whatever you desire in your temple
[1:05:06] whatever you want me to do for work
[1:05:08] whatever you want me to do with my
[1:05:10] family whatever you want me to do at
[1:05:12] church whatever you want me to do that's
[1:05:14] what I want to do Lord I'm tired of
[1:05:16] living my own life I'm tire come on
[1:05:17] church I'm tired of just being what I
[1:05:19] want to be but I want to surrender to
[1:05:21] you so that shina presence that presence
[1:05:24] of God can come and dwell in my heart.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; He will not make his sanctuary
[1:05:34] in a place where his word is not kept.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Matthew 15:9. But in vain they do
[1:05:40] worship me.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:05:44] of men. Their worship was not received.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Because they would not keep the word. I
[1:05:50] know people think it's a light thing to
[1:05:52] just take the message and make it
[1:05:53] whatever they want to make it and make
[1:05:55] some doctrine out of it and and preach
[1:05:57] it when it's when brother Brandham
[1:05:58] didn't say it. It's not a light thing,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You might shout and run the aisles and
[1:06:03] speak in tongues, but the presence of
[1:06:05] God will not be there.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Unless the word is being kept.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; In vain they do worship me, teaching for
[1:06:14] doctrines the commandments of men. He
[1:06:16] will not make his sanctuary in a place
[1:06:18] where his word is not kept. Exodus
[1:06:20] chapter 40 and verse 33. Let's look at
[1:06:22] it now. As Moses had been shown the
[1:06:25] pattern and the people were willing to
[1:06:26] work and gave to for the work and all of
[1:06:29] these things and Moses finally gets it
[1:06:32] all put together, he reared up the court
[1:06:35] round about it. So he sets up the
[1:06:37] outside, if you can imagine, kind of
[1:06:38] like us setting up a tent to go camping,
[1:06:41] you know, and they set it all up, put
[1:06:42] poles on it. It was a tent and they put
[1:06:45] the poles up and and and made the
[1:06:47] courtyard and he set the court up and
[1:06:50] set up the hanging of the court gate. So
[1:06:52] Moses finished the work.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Now if if the next verse doesn't happen,
[1:07:01] this tabernacle is no better than any
[1:07:03] temple they left in Egypt. All right.
[1:07:05] All right. A
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; and if the the presence of God doesn't
[1:07:09] come down, you see, because
[1:07:12] the the Israelites, they didn't have a
[1:07:15] God they could make.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a great
[1:07:22] lesson here.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; The Israelites didn't have a God they
[1:07:25] could make
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; and put in the tabernacle and worship.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; We don't either.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Right. We we don't get to just change
[1:07:35] the word however we want to because it
[1:07:37] feels better for us.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Right. Well, it would be better for me
[1:07:41] in my life if I would just ignore that
[1:07:44] part of the word. We don't get to do
[1:07:45] that.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And if we just trust him, he'd make
[1:07:50] things work out,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; right? But many times we get in a mess
[1:07:54] because we feel like we lack the faith
[1:07:56] or the confidence in God to bring us
[1:07:58] through. And so we do things that are
[1:08:00] outside of the word,
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; thinking, well, that's the only way I
[1:08:03] can have my entertainment or that's the
[1:08:04] only way I can have fun or that's the
[1:08:06] only way I'll ever be happy. And so what
[1:08:08] we're doing, we're doing outside of the
[1:08:09] word
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; when all he wants us to do is is is do
[1:08:13] our part and do what be be faithful to
[1:08:15] what we know. You don't have to know
[1:08:17] everything. Not everything is revealed
[1:08:19] to everybody. All you got to do is what
[1:08:21] you know to do.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's all you'll be all you'll be
[1:08:25] judged by. It's all that you'll be
[1:08:27] examined by when uh when he comes by is
[1:08:30] to see that you've done what you've been
[1:08:31] told to do. And so Moses finished the
[1:08:36] work.
[1:08:38] Now watch. And then a cloud
[1:08:42] covered the tent of the congregation
[1:08:45] and the glory of the Lord
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; filled the tabernacle.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, we can do all the singing. We can do
[1:08:55] all the preaching. We can do all the
[1:08:57] work.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; We can set get the microphone set right
[1:09:02] and the music right and everything else.
[1:09:04] But if the glory of the Lord doesn't
[1:09:06] come,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; what good is all of it?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; There's got to be something that can
[1:09:12] that can move people. Got to be
[1:09:14] something that can change their hearts.
[1:09:15] Got to be something that can that can
[1:09:17] make them obey the word. There's got to
[1:09:19] be something that'll bring them to
[1:09:20] Christ.
[1:09:24] And Moses was not able to enter into the
[1:09:27] tent of the congregation because the
[1:09:29] cloud abode thereon and the glory of the
[1:09:32] Lord filled the tabernacle.
[1:09:37] Here was the proof that the sanctuary
[1:09:40] was ordained of God. The tabernacle was
[1:09:43] the word manifested.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So he gave it to Moses. He
[1:09:49] revealed it to him. But the tabernacle
[1:09:51] was the manifestation of the revelation
[1:09:54] that Moses had.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Right? Just like you, you young people,
[1:09:58] you're the manifestation of the
[1:09:59] revelation that Jesus had or or or that
[1:10:02] that we've been given of what a young
[1:10:04] person is. The revelation that you
[1:10:05] receive in your soul by the Holy Spirit.
[1:10:08] He gives that to you and then you become
[1:10:10] that. You become sweet and kind and
[1:10:11] caring and loving and and dress right
[1:10:14] and act right and do right. Why do you
[1:10:16] do that? Because you're the
[1:10:17] manifestation. Come on, church. The
[1:10:19] works don't save you, but it's a
[1:10:21] manifesting of his presence. It's
[1:10:23] showing that the word is there and it's
[1:10:25] working in your life. And then what does
[1:10:26] he do? He comes down and fills the
[1:10:28] tabernacle. He fills it with his glory.
[1:10:30] His shina presence comes down.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It's proof that the word of God has
[1:10:36] ordained this tabernacle.
[1:10:38] Oh, I pray that this would be a church
[1:10:40] that the Lord of Lord ordained that the
[1:10:42] word of God has been preached in in its
[1:10:44] puress, in its fullness, so that the
[1:10:47] kind of presence of God could come down.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me this morning?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; This was proof that the sanctuary was
[1:11:00] ordained of God. The tabernacle was the
[1:11:01] word manifested. The same was true of
[1:11:04] Solomon's temple in First Kings chapter
[1:11:05] 8 and verse 10. It came to pass when the
[1:11:09] priests were come out of the holy place.
[1:11:14] They'd come in with the
[1:11:18] come in with the ark of the covenant.
[1:11:20] They'd finished all the work. The the
[1:11:23] final piece of gold was laid and the
[1:11:25] wood and the stones that we talked about
[1:11:28] last week that were cut in different
[1:11:29] ways were all put together. And here
[1:11:32] they walked you into the temple if you
[1:11:35] can imagine what it was like. And they
[1:11:37] and the priests, there were certain
[1:11:39] priests, the the Kathites, I believe it
[1:11:42] was, that were called to carry the ark
[1:11:44] on their shoulder.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; And so they would carry the ark and and
[1:11:48] they and they and they brought it into
[1:11:50] the house of God.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; And they set it into the socket into the
[1:11:55] place that was prepared for it. And when
[1:11:58] they set it in the socket and walked
[1:12:00] back out of the holy of holies,
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; the Bible says the cloud filled the
[1:12:05] house of the Lord.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; So that the priest could not stand to
[1:12:09] minister because the because of the
[1:12:12] cloud for the glory of the Lord had
[1:12:15] filled the house of the Lord.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Then spake Solomon. The Lord said that
[1:12:20] he would dwell in the thick darkness. I
[1:12:22] have surely built thee a house to dwell
[1:12:25] in, a settled place for thee to abide
[1:12:27] in,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; forever.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Over time, the people disobeyed and went
[1:12:33] into idolatry. The temple was destroyed.
[1:12:36] The ark was lost.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice something.
[1:12:43] This is I'm not trying to make it
[1:12:45] mysterious, but I want to get to a point
[1:12:47] this morning when Zerubbabel rebuilt the
[1:12:50] temple. You remember the ark was lost,
[1:12:54] remember? And and and the Babylonians
[1:12:57] come and took away the things for the
[1:12:59] temple. They finally come and just tore
[1:13:00] it down. And
[1:13:02] and the prophet Haggi was there during
[1:13:05] the time Zerubbabel was rebuilding the
[1:13:07] temple.
[1:13:09] Now when when when he come to rebuild
[1:13:11] it, it was a it was a work of God. When
[1:13:13] Ezra was there and different ones, it
[1:13:15] was a work of God.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; God meant for it to happen. He made a
[1:13:19] way for it to happen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; But yet in in the process of time, God
[1:13:24] was already pointing to something else.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; So this second temple
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; would never have the glory in it.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; The shikina was never in the second
[1:13:38] temple.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; It was only in the first temple. But
[1:13:41] there's no record in scripture of the
[1:13:44] Shikina being in the second temple. But
[1:13:48] the prophet Haggi spoke of a time when
[1:13:50] the glory would return. Haggi 2:6. For
[1:13:52] thus sayith the Lord of hosts, "Yet once
[1:13:54] it is a little while. I will shake the
[1:13:56] heavens and the earth and the sea and
[1:13:58] the dry land." Because I'm sure there
[1:14:00] were people there that that even they
[1:14:02] could think back. They'd been told or
[1:14:04] maybe even some old enough to remember.
[1:14:05] We know that when the first temple was
[1:14:07] dedicated that the door shook
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; at the presence of God.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; The post shook at the presence of God.
[1:14:15] When Isaiah saw the vision of it, hear
[1:14:17] the the glory of God and and the and the
[1:14:19] noise of the cherubam and and and the
[1:14:21] post shook at the in the presence of
[1:14:23] God.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And here says, "Yet once I will shake
[1:14:29] the heavens,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; the earth, the sea, the dry land.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I will shake all nations,
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; and the desire of all nations shall
[1:14:37] come, and I will fill this house."
[1:14:39] Right.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; But as far as we know, that shikina was
[1:14:43] never in that second temple. What house
[1:14:45] is he talking about? He's speaking of a
[1:14:47] of a body he had prepared.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Right? There was a body coming. He would
[1:14:52] shake all nations. He said, "I will fill
[1:14:54] this house with glory, sayith the Lord
[1:14:55] of host. The silver is mine. The gold is
[1:14:57] mine, sayith the Lord of host. The glory
[1:14:59] of this latter house shall be greater
[1:15:00] than of the former, sayeth the Lord of
[1:15:02] hosts. And in this place will I give
[1:15:04] peace, sayith the Lord of hosts."
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Y. Now look,
[1:15:09] we know as we've already said, Jesus was
[1:15:11] the sanctuary of God
[1:15:13] and he was not without the glory,
[1:15:17] right? It come down like a dove on him
[1:15:20] there when he walked in obedience into
[1:15:22] the water. The word coming to the word
[1:15:25] in the water come to the prophet and the
[1:15:28] word came down upon him. the the the
[1:15:30] spirit come down upon the word. And when
[1:15:32] he did, he was filled with the Holy
[1:15:34] Ghost, with the fullness of God, right?
[1:15:37] He was God. He was God as a baby in a
[1:15:39] manger, but he was filled with the
[1:15:41] fullness of the spirit.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Now look, Matthew 17:4, we find another
[1:15:45] place where you remember Jesus takes
[1:15:48] three disciples. He brings them up on
[1:15:50] the mountain and on Mount
[1:15:51] Transfiguration and and there's three
[1:15:54] that are there. There's Jesus and Moses
[1:15:56] and Elijah. And when Peter sees that, he
[1:16:00] said, "Let's build some temples."
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; But God didn't need any more earthly
[1:16:07] temples.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't need any more temples of
[1:16:10] stone,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; any more temples of wood. He didn't even
[1:16:13] He didn't even come down into the second
[1:16:15] temple. He said, "I got a temple."
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Right? Come on.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Peter and Peter looks at him and says,
[1:16:21] "Lord, it's good for us to be here."
[1:16:25] He said, "If thou will, let's make here
[1:16:27] three tabernacles.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Let's make three temples. One for thee,
[1:16:32] one for Moses, one for Elias."
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, he didn't understand, did he? Just
[1:16:36] like a lot of people today that don't
[1:16:38] understand
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; because they elevate a prophet or a
[1:16:40] preacher or a pastor to the position of
[1:16:42] Christ.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And and he's not they're not in
[1:16:46] the position of Christ
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; because what happens while he yet spake,
[1:16:50] behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
[1:16:52] them. He a voice out of the cloud which
[1:16:55] said this is my beloved son in whom I'm
[1:16:58] well pleased hear you him. What was it?
[1:17:00] The glory coming down on the temple on
[1:17:02] the tabernacle was showing. This is my
[1:17:05] word. This is the one who kept my word.
[1:17:07] This is the one who's the the building
[1:17:09] that I have made
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; to dwell in.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; This is my sanctuary. This is the place
[1:17:16] of my rest.
[1:17:18] When he died, the veil was rent. When
[1:17:22] Jesus died, the veil was written from
[1:17:23] top to bottom
[1:17:25] showing that second temple, remember,
[1:17:28] was the one that Zerubabel built or that
[1:17:30] uh Ezra built. And yet it was the it had
[1:17:35] been remodeled and made grand by Herod.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; He'd made it very beautiful, very large.
[1:17:42] So they called it Herod's temple.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; But the presence of God wasn't there.
[1:17:49] And when Jesus died, he went the veil
[1:17:52] from the top to the bottom.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said they were even in
[1:17:56] the temple singing songs
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; about
[1:18:01] how a lamb would come
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; about the Messiah, how he would come,
[1:18:06] how he would be crucified. They sang,
[1:18:07] "My bones, they stare at me." And there
[1:18:09] he was on Calvary
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; fulfilling the word. But they they were
[1:18:13] blinded for our sake, so they couldn't
[1:18:15] see it.
[1:18:17] So here he he he was showing that there
[1:18:20] was no visible presence of the Lord when
[1:18:23] the when the veil was rent. Not only was
[1:18:25] there no mercy, no presence, there was
[1:18:27] no ark,
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; The ark had been lost.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; So where there was no word, they made
[1:18:33] men's ideas and worshiped in tradition.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you know what happened in our
[1:18:42] day.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; What was the restoration of the word? It
[1:18:46] was the ark coming back into its place.
[1:18:48] It was the fullness. That's why the
[1:18:49] fullness of the word had to come. See,
[1:18:51] if the seventh seal's not open, if
[1:18:53] brother Brandon's ministry is not
[1:18:54] complete, then we're still waiting on
[1:18:56] the ark to be put down in its place.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; So, how could the glory of the Lord fall
[1:19:01] if the word's not been fully restored?
[1:19:03] But if the word has been fully restored,
[1:19:06] if he has found the faith, I if Malachi
[1:19:08] 4 has been fulfilled, then where are we
[1:19:10] at, church? We're right there. Oh, come
[1:19:12] on, church. where the presence of the
[1:19:14] Lord is
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; living in the shina presence of God.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:22] And and and here the mercy seat was was
[1:19:25] right there. There was no effective
[1:19:27] mercy seat in in the temple at that
[1:19:30] time. There was an empty
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; oh God. An empty holy of holies.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; But the mercy seat was hanging between
[1:19:38] heavens and earth on a cross in plain
[1:19:40] view of the people. He's still in plain
[1:19:42] view today. If you want to receive him,
[1:19:44] you can receive him. You can have him
[1:19:46] for your healing. You can you can obtain
[1:19:48] it for your salvation
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; by faith in Christ.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; He hung in plain view of the people and
[1:19:55] then he ascended and told the disciples
[1:19:58] what to do. Now watch what he told them.
[1:20:01] He didn't tell them to build a house.
[1:20:04] He didn't say, "Now I want to give you
[1:20:05] some plans and you're going to go build
[1:20:06] another church, build a temple." But
[1:20:10] what did he tell him to do? Luke 24:49,
[1:20:13] "Behold, I send the promise of my father
[1:20:16] upon you." He said, "The glory is going
[1:20:18] to come down." The shininess coming
[1:20:21] down.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They were in an upper room
[1:20:26] right there in the temple, but he wasn't
[1:20:28] going to come down into the holy of
[1:20:30] holies of the temple,
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Where the veil covered it. He wasn't
[1:20:34] going to inhabit that physical temple.
[1:20:37] But there was 120 believers
[1:20:40] in that in that upper room. Hallelujah.
[1:20:44] When it filled their hearts, it filled
[1:20:45] the room.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And church, the reason we feel him in
[1:20:49] the room is because he's filled the
[1:20:51] hearts of men and women and boys and
[1:20:53] girls who are here this morning. He's
[1:20:55] not just in the room. He's in our
[1:20:57] hearts.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:00] The shikina never filled Herod's temple,
[1:21:03] but it filled the hearts of 120
[1:21:05] believers and filled the room that they
[1:21:06] were in. Acts 2:1, when the day of
[1:21:08] Pentecost was fully come, they were all
[1:21:10] with one accord in one place and
[1:21:12] suddenly there came a sound from heaven
[1:21:14] as of a rushing mighty wind and it
[1:21:16] filled the house where they were sitting
[1:21:18] and there appeared on them cloven
[1:21:19] tongues like as a fire. What was that?
[1:21:21] It was the shikina presence of God. It
[1:21:24] was God separating himself into his
[1:21:26] believers began to he said and and and
[1:21:28] it said upon each of them they were all
[1:21:30] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:21:32] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:21:33] gave them utterance.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; After the building was completed,
[1:21:39] it was oh my
[1:21:42] After the building was completed, what
[1:21:44] did he tell him to do? He said, "You're
[1:21:46] my building. You're my temples. You're
[1:21:48] my tabernacles. Go and wait for the Holy
[1:21:51] Ghost to fall."
[1:21:53] Now, we don't have to wait because the
[1:21:54] Holy Ghost is here. What do we have to
[1:21:55] do? Acts 2:38, "Repent and be baptized
[1:21:58] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:21:59] Christ. You shall receive the gift of
[1:22:00] the Holy Ghost."
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Obedience to the word.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:10] But Solomon's, let's go back to
[1:22:11] Solomon's temple for a moment. The
[1:22:14] building was completed.
[1:22:17] It was just an empty building, though.
[1:22:20] It was beautiful.
[1:22:22] But it was empty.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; There was nothing in it but furniture.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; And yet Solomon had done all that he
[1:22:33] could do.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; There you go. Good.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham says he said, "Now
[1:22:39] the great day of dedication come."
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; When they were going to dedicate this
[1:22:43] building for worshippers to worship
[1:22:46] something.
[1:22:48] Now without something there to worship,
[1:22:51] the building would have been in vain.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; But the building was now ready for
[1:22:56] dedication.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; So the Levites, as we said, went to the
[1:23:01] tabernacle where the ark was kept and
[1:23:04] they brought the word into its resting
[1:23:07] place.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon tells us the reason
[1:23:10] David the reason the ark the first time
[1:23:13] everything failed. Remember the man
[1:23:15] touched the ark and David didn't consult
[1:23:17] the prophet and he shouted and he he had
[1:23:20] a good revival but nothing happened,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right? He was trying to do God a service
[1:23:24] without it being the will of God. But if
[1:23:25] you go down in that sermon, brother
[1:23:26] Brandon said there wasn't a place
[1:23:28] prepared for it.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He said there had to be a place and
[1:23:31] Solomon's temple was the place. So there
[1:23:34] had to be a place prepared. So now they
[1:23:36] would finally enter the place that was
[1:23:38] prepared for it. He said and they picked
[1:23:40] it up from its tents. They started
[1:23:42] marching. The trumpets sounding, the
[1:23:45] sultry playing, the smoke going up from
[1:23:47] the dead animals that was being
[1:23:48] sacrificed before Jehovah down through
[1:23:51] the building of dedication that came
[1:23:53] till they brought it to its resting
[1:23:55] place where it fit down into the sockets
[1:23:57] of the great huge place that had been
[1:24:00] set for it. And when it fit down and
[1:24:04] finally come to its resting place, the
[1:24:06] ark,
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; the Bible said the Lord descended down
[1:24:10] upon the place till it filled the entire
[1:24:13] temple. See, faith comes by hearing of
[1:24:15] the word. You may sit here for service
[1:24:17] after service, but one day when the word
[1:24:19] comes to its resting place and it really
[1:24:22] gets down in your heart, it becomes more
[1:24:24] than a head knowledge, but it becomes a
[1:24:25] heart knowledge. What is that? That's
[1:24:27] when the presence of God can come down.
[1:24:30] The word had reached its final resting
[1:24:32] place, the pillar of fire. He said come
[1:24:34] in in such great glory of God till the
[1:24:37] ministers could not minister anymore
[1:24:39] because of the glory of God.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand taught us that was the
[1:24:43] true capstone of the of the temple was
[1:24:45] the shikina presence because the
[1:24:47] building was incomplete
[1:24:50] without the presence of God. So Stephen
[1:24:54] when he was preaching and we read it
[1:24:55] earlier, what house will you build me?
[1:24:57] What is the place of my rest? And
[1:24:59] brother Brandham always takes that to
[1:25:01] Hebrews 10:5 he said how beautiful
[1:25:02] Hebrews 10:5 but a body hast thou
[1:25:04] prepared me showing that God was going
[1:25:06] to dwell in a body and when this body
[1:25:08] had been made a sacrifice the correct
[1:25:10] lamb had been sacrificed there was
[1:25:12] coming forth then God came to his own
[1:25:15] body which was his bride
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; so where where did the temple move to or
[1:25:20] the tabernacle the sanctuary of God it
[1:25:23] was no longer hanging on a cross but the
[1:25:25] sanctuary
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; was 120 believers
[1:25:30] And every believer who's come that same
[1:25:32] way since then
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; they become you become the sanctuary of
[1:25:38] God. God come to his own body which was
[1:25:39] his bride. There had been 120 temples
[1:25:41] that God had created was ready for
[1:25:43] dedication had got all their unbelief
[1:25:45] beat out of them. Amen. But in the
[1:25:48] preparation time as we're preparing this
[1:25:50] temple for the Holy Ghost they all the
[1:25:52] unbelief beat out of them. They gathered
[1:25:53] in the upper room and waited for 10 days
[1:25:55] for dedicational service. Then when
[1:25:58] completely surrendered, God came down
[1:26:01] again in the shakina glory and filled
[1:26:03] all the house where they were sitting.
[1:26:05] Listen to me church. Many times we
[1:26:06] think, well, why doesn't the presence of
[1:26:08] God move? Why don't we see more prayer
[1:26:10] or worship in the service? Why don't why
[1:26:12] don't I feel better about going to the
[1:26:14] house of God? Listen, many times we're
[1:26:15] miserable in the house of God because
[1:26:17] there's something we haven't surrendered
[1:26:19] yet. There's something there and you're
[1:26:20] you're probably thinking of it right
[1:26:22] now. You just need to let it go. You
[1:26:24] need to let God have his full room in
[1:26:26] your heart, in your house.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; If there's thoughts that exalt
[1:26:32] themselves against the knowledge of
[1:26:33] Christ, you need to bring them into
[1:26:34] captivity this morning and say, "I want
[1:26:37] to be a temple filled with the Holy
[1:26:38] Ghost." If the Satan tells me I can't
[1:26:40] make it, I believe the word says I can.
[1:26:42] If he tells me there's no hope, I
[1:26:44] believe the word says there is hope. If
[1:26:46] he tells me there's no forgiveness, I
[1:26:48] believe he's forgiven my sins
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; on Calvary. If he tells me I can't, oh,
[1:26:52] come on, church. He tells me I can't
[1:26:54] make it. I know I'm going to make it.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That anxiety and depression exalts
[1:27:00] itself against God. We ought to let go
[1:27:02] of that thing.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; We're holding on to it many times out of
[1:27:06] stubbornness of our own heart, saying,
[1:27:07] "Well, I I I just, you know, I'm afraid.
[1:27:10] I'm afraid." Just let that go and say,
[1:27:11] "Lord, I'm going to enjoy the house of
[1:27:13] God. I'm going to worship God no matter
[1:27:15] how I feel. No matter what's going on in
[1:27:17] my life, I'm going to love you anyway.
[1:27:20] I'm going to worship God anyway cuz he's
[1:27:22] worthy of my praise.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; So when his shikana presence drops in is
[1:27:27] when we surrender.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Revival don't come by fast music or
[1:27:34] hyping people up.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; Revival doesn't come from from strobe
[1:27:41] lights and smoke machines.
[1:27:44] Revival comes when the word is preached
[1:27:46] and people surrender to it and people
[1:27:49] say, "Not my will but thine be done."
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; What did God do? He said like the ark
[1:28:02] dropping into its proper sockets for the
[1:28:04] message of that day, God dropped back
[1:28:07] into its proper channel. Not into a
[1:28:09] denomination or into a building made
[1:28:11] with hands, but into the heart of men.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He dropped in his place for the last
[1:28:17] day. He said, "Which said the prophet
[1:28:20] Joel, it shall come to pass in the last
[1:28:21] day. I'll pour out my shikina upon all
[1:28:23] flesh. Your sons and daughters shall
[1:28:25] prophesy. Your young men shall dream
[1:28:27] dreams. The old men shall see visions."
[1:28:29] God will come to his came to his resting
[1:28:32] place. Hallelujah. Where he finds rest,
[1:28:34] not in a building, but in the heart of
[1:28:36] his people, he finds rest.
[1:28:40] Brother Brandham talks about another
[1:28:41] temple that was made. He talks about
[1:28:42] Nimrod's temple. He He made a tower that
[1:28:46] would reach into the heavens. He thought
[1:28:49] he'd make a temple that God couldn't
[1:28:51] ignore.
[1:28:52] Oh my. But when God, you know, when that
[1:28:56] happened, what happened? God said, "I'm
[1:28:57] going to confuse their language."
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; And it brought a confusion of tongues.
[1:29:02] That's Babylon.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Right. But when God come to his own
[1:29:06] temple, hallelujah. He didn't bring a
[1:29:08] confusion of tongues, but he brought an
[1:29:12] understanding of tongues,
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; he brought interpretation. Hallelujah.
[1:29:17] So, brother Brandon said the miracle was
[1:29:18] the hearer, right? Because he said that
[1:29:20] they heard him speak in their own
[1:29:21] language.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; That's why he said to this is tough
[1:29:25] because some people want to go back to a
[1:29:26] place where everybody's just just
[1:29:28] speaking in tongues all the time.
[1:29:29] Listen, I believe in speaking in
[1:29:30] tongues. I believe there's a prayer
[1:29:31] language that you don't even understand.
[1:29:33] doesn't have to be interpreted. But in
[1:29:35] the house of God, Paul said not to do
[1:29:36] that.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Right? Because brother Brandham taught
[1:29:39] us that was Babylon again.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; It was a sign of judgment.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; People think it's a sign of God's
[1:29:45] presence. It was actually a sign of
[1:29:47] judgment. The temple built in the wrong
[1:29:49] way.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Not according to the word. It was a sign
[1:29:54] of confusion of tongues. But when that
[1:29:56] when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[1:29:57] Pentecost, it did not confuse tongues.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; That's good. Come on. or bring some kind
[1:30:03] of a vague message. But it was some it
[1:30:05] was Peter's sermon that he was preaching
[1:30:08] everyone heard in their own language.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; Brother said when God come to his own
[1:30:12] temple, the church, the people when he
[1:30:14] come to them, he filled the temples that
[1:30:15] were dedicated just like he did at
[1:30:17] Solomon's temple. He filled it not with
[1:30:18] creeds, not with denominations, but with
[1:30:20] himself. He filled the temple with the
[1:30:22] shikina glory. So did he do on the day
[1:30:24] of Pentecost? He filled them 120 pe
[1:30:26] temples. It was up there with himself
[1:30:28] with the Holy Ghost itself. The shikina
[1:30:30] glory broke through upon them. And then
[1:30:32] what Nimrod failed to do, build a temple
[1:30:34] where every man spoke contrary to what
[1:30:36] he could understand. God came down and
[1:30:39] with one Galilean language made every
[1:30:41] man understand what he was saying. And
[1:30:42] they know it was brought. What Pentecost
[1:30:44] failed to do with a confusion of tongue.
[1:30:46] This message has come and brought a
[1:30:48] clarity to the word.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me now. I I I don't
[1:30:57] want you to take that. I'm against
[1:30:58] tongues. Somebody broke out in tongues.
[1:30:59] believe in the ser I say praise God
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not against that at all
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; but that's not our focus in this age
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; God can use that brother Brandon said it
[1:31:11] was the mean times it was God
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; God that used it but it wasn't his his
[1:31:16] perfect way for the sermon to be 10
[1:31:18] minutes long
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; and the tongues just be going off in the
[1:31:21] church
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; right it wasn't God's way it was
[1:31:24] confusion it was Babylon
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen So he said the shikina of glory
[1:31:30] broke through upon him. What Nimrod
[1:31:32] failed to do. Hallelujah. God came down
[1:31:34] and did. There is God to his temple. God
[1:31:37] to his dedicated temple. Not to a
[1:31:38] man-made achievement. Not to what man
[1:31:40] done. But what God did himself.
[1:31:43] Hallelujah. But God always fills his
[1:31:45] temple at the day of dedication. He
[1:31:47] fills his temple. He fills it with
[1:31:48] himself. The same thing today. God will
[1:31:50] fill every temple. Someone say it with
[1:31:52] me. Every temple that will thoroughly
[1:31:55] dedicate itself to him. any persons that
[1:31:58] will.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If you start thinking,
[1:32:01] well, I need more of God. Well, who
[1:32:02] doesn't need more of God?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Right? We all feel that way, don't we?
[1:32:06] Many times we need more of God. We need
[1:32:08] his presence. We need his glory. We We
[1:32:11] need him to be We need more of God. I
[1:32:13] think we could all say that this
[1:32:14] morning. Every one of us, if we had an
[1:32:16] altar call for that, more of God, we we
[1:32:18] should probably all be in the altar
[1:32:19] because we all need more of God. But if
[1:32:21] you want more of God, you need to
[1:32:23] dedicate yourself. Yes.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Dedicate yourself to the things of God.
[1:32:28] Dedicate yourself to the word of God.
[1:32:30] Dedicate your temple.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; You can't go around all week
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; living in an undeedicated manner to the
[1:32:38] word
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; and then expect that to get fixed on
[1:32:40] Sunday.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And then go back to it again.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not preaching at anybody. I don't
[1:32:48] You know, I don't do that. I'm preaching
[1:32:50] to myself, too.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, we I'm a human being. I live in this
[1:32:54] world. I know what it's like. I I live
[1:32:56] in the same world you do. I I I I I
[1:32:58] There's some There's some sports that I
[1:33:00] like. There's some entertainment and
[1:33:02] things that's good. That's That's not
[1:33:04] filthy that that I like to enjoy. And I
[1:33:07] enjoy going to the theme park like
[1:33:08] anybody else. I enjoy uh fishing and
[1:33:11] hunting and or not really hunting so
[1:33:12] much as fishing, but I enjoy doing
[1:33:14] things and and doing all but listen, if
[1:33:17] we're all week we're dedicating
[1:33:18] ourselves to those things, how do we
[1:33:20] expect to be a temple filled with the
[1:33:22] Holy Ghost?
[1:33:26] He can come down on at some point. We
[1:33:28] got to dedicate ourselves to the house
[1:33:30] of God, to the things of God.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "God will fill
[1:33:39] every temple that will thoroughly
[1:33:40] dedicate itself to him. Any persons that
[1:33:42] will."
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "The temple is not this little
[1:33:44] building here. The temple is not the one
[1:33:45] in Salt Lake City. The temple is not the
[1:33:47] one in Rome. The temple is you.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; You are the temple that God wants to
[1:33:51] dwell in and express himself through
[1:33:52] it." that all nations might know him.
[1:33:54] You are living images of God that God
[1:33:56] wants to work through in any time that
[1:33:58] any man or any woman will forget all the
[1:34:01] falsehoods that they've heard in the
[1:34:02] world and come back to the line of the
[1:34:04] scriptures and we'll keep in line.
[1:34:07] Oh my, what is that? Keeping the pattern
[1:34:09] that we've been given. If we'll come
[1:34:11] back to the original dedication, we'll
[1:34:12] open up our hearts and empty ourselves.
[1:34:14] God in dedication as we give it to him,
[1:34:17] we'll fill our temple with his shikina
[1:34:18] glory. Then the living God will be
[1:34:21] moving in a living church among a living
[1:34:24] people. We'll spread forth his glory and
[1:34:26] together someday one being this way, one
[1:34:28] this way, one one part of the country,
[1:34:30] she'll come together to make up the
[1:34:31] bride.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We'll be caught up in the
[1:34:34] air to meet him. What is that? We're
[1:34:36] dedicating ourselves to him so we can be
[1:34:39] in his presence.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:44] But I I don't know about you, but I want
[1:34:47] to be his sanctuary today. Yes.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; I want to be his sanctuary.
[1:34:55] You young men.
[1:34:58] I when I was 12 years old, I wanted to
[1:35:00] be a sanctuary. I hadn't even received
[1:35:02] the Holy Ghost yet, but I wanted it so
[1:35:04] bad.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a sanctuary. You young
[1:35:07] ladies, you can be a sanctuary.
[1:35:11] I remember at 16, we got 16 year olds
[1:35:13] here and 18 year olds, 17 year olds. I I
[1:35:16] remember when I was that age and I
[1:35:18] wanted to be the sanctuary of God, when
[1:35:20] I received the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:21] Ghost, I I you know, I had more time
[1:35:23] then. I could pray and dedicate myself
[1:35:25] to the things of God. I'd go almost
[1:35:27] every day and and have nothing else to
[1:35:29] do. And so I I'd go and and and dedicate
[1:35:32] myself to the to the prayer and things.
[1:35:34] Listen, I'm not saying that because I'm
[1:35:36] saying that because there was a desire
[1:35:37] inside of me to worship God and to do
[1:35:39] those things. But you can do that, too.
[1:35:41] Yeah,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, there's not Listen,
[1:35:44] what we have today is not because of
[1:35:46] talent. What we're seeing today, the the
[1:35:48] fruit that we're seeing is not because
[1:35:50] that the musicians are talented and the
[1:35:52] preachers talented and and everything is
[1:35:54] a bunch of talent here in the church.
[1:35:56] That's not what it is. We love the
[1:35:57] talent, but that's not why we have what
[1:35:59] we have. We have what we have. We have
[1:36:01] the services we do because somebody
[1:36:04] dedicated themselves to the work of the
[1:36:06] Lord. Somebody got down to business with
[1:36:08] God and said, "I'm going to I'm going to
[1:36:10] start living for him. I'm going to do
[1:36:12] what's right." Listen, I failed many
[1:36:14] times. I've messed up many times, but
[1:36:16] I'm still dedicated to his word. I want
[1:36:18] to do the right thing. What about you
[1:36:20] young people? Why don't you dedicate
[1:36:22] yourself this morning to the word of the
[1:36:24] Lord? I'm going to quit listening to
[1:36:25] that music. I'm going to quit going on
[1:36:27] them websites. I'm going to quit going
[1:36:29] to that place. I'm going to dedicate
[1:36:30] this temple to the worship of God.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Good. Yes.
[1:36:36] He can fill your h your heart.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; And he will if you'll fully dedicate
[1:36:43] yourself
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; to him. How do we become his sanctuary
[1:36:47] today? Acts 238. I've already quoted it
[1:36:49] to you. If you'll do these things,
[1:36:51] repent and be baptized, you shall
[1:36:53] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. The
[1:36:55] glory
[1:36:57] will come
[1:36:59] to that predestined temple.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:04] Now the key to that is repentance,
[1:37:08] surrender to the word. Brother Brandham
[1:37:09] taught us that when a man is saved, he
[1:37:11] has a little button. Brother Brand said
[1:37:13] about like the white button on his
[1:37:16] shirt,
[1:37:18] a button of light.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; That comes into his heart. Now that's
[1:37:23] the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Right. It is when you receive Christ.
[1:37:28] That's the Holy Ghost
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; working in you. But it has to work
[1:37:32] through justification and
[1:37:33] sanctification,
[1:37:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:37:38] baptism after baptism
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; because he's not stopping, he's growing,
[1:37:44] right? Brother Brandon said that light
[1:37:46] as it grows, it pushes out everything
[1:37:48] that's unlike him. And so that's why
[1:37:50] it's so much easier to serve God at the
[1:37:52] beginning because the light in you is so
[1:37:54] small. You can just rejoice in that
[1:37:55] light,
[1:37:57] right? Brother Jesus even talked about
[1:37:59] that. He said, "You saw John. You
[1:38:02] rejoiced in his light, but a greater
[1:38:03] light has come."
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; What happens is that light pushes up
[1:38:07] against our carnal nature.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; And when it pushes up against our carnal
[1:38:13] nature, we start to respond and we start
[1:38:16] to hold on to things
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; that we don't we shouldn't hold on to.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; And and and so he'll stay there. He's
[1:38:22] not going to leave us. But why not just
[1:38:24] give him full possession?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Good. Huh?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Give him full possession.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; See, brother Brandham taught us a man is
[1:38:32] made up in the system of a tabernacle.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; In the outer courts, then in the holy
[1:38:37] place, and the holiest of holies, the
[1:38:39] shakina glory on the inside, the veil.
[1:38:41] He said there were five gates each to
[1:38:44] the body and to the spirit.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Right. See, taste, feel, smell, and hear
[1:38:48] in the body and imaginations and
[1:38:50] conscience and so forth. In the spirit,
[1:38:51] memory in the spirit.
[1:38:54] Then he said on the inside he has only
[1:38:56] one gate,
[1:38:58] one entrance to go into the shina glory
[1:39:01] where God can enter into him
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; and take over in the control tower and
[1:39:06] that way is through self-will.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; See, he does not force himself. The
[1:39:12] amazing thing about predestination
[1:39:15] is God elects his children but does not
[1:39:18] force himself into their heart.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Because he's so great.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. And and how does he do
[1:39:26] that? And I' I've given this to you
[1:39:28] before, but it's a lot the way that we
[1:39:29] You want to keep your children around.
[1:39:31] I'm preaching to myself here, too. I got
[1:39:33] children, you know, a kid turns 18,
[1:39:35] they're old enough to leave the home,
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; huh? Appreciate that sign back there,
[1:39:40] Peter. That old enough to They make
[1:39:43] signs back there because I can't hear
[1:39:45] them say, "Amen." But they're old enough
[1:39:48] when, you know, turn 18, they're old
[1:39:50] enough to leave the house. Yeah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; You old enough to just go out and go out
[1:39:54] in the world?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; They are.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; What makes a kid want to stay in and try
[1:39:58] to do what's right?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Huh? Are you kids going to face that
[1:40:02] decision one day?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; You can't make them not do it.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; You can't force them to stay home. You
[1:40:09] can't force them not to s go out and
[1:40:11] sin, do those things.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Can't do it. How do you get them to stay
[1:40:14] home? I always admired sister Samra
[1:40:16] because her her kids never wanted to
[1:40:18] leave the house, you know.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; But evidently there was a place there
[1:40:22] that there was something there that they
[1:40:24] there was love there.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; So what do you do? Brother Brandon said
[1:40:27] make your home a happy place,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; a place they want to be at.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; They want to bring their friends to,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; right? A place that don't mean you give
[1:40:35] into everything. It means you keep it
[1:40:37] orderly. You keep it nice. You keep the
[1:40:39] atmosphere right. You don't be critical
[1:40:40] of every little thing. And Right. Keep
[1:40:43] it nice. He said,
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; "Keep it nice for them." And
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; let all the bad attitudes go and say,
[1:40:49] "What? What are you doing? You're you're
[1:40:51] Listen, I know my kids can get old
[1:40:54] enough to leave, but I can't imagine
[1:40:55] them doing it."
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Because I just want to overwhelm them
[1:40:59] with love and with with teaching and
[1:41:01] with the things that God I just want to
[1:41:03] overwhelm them with love until they know
[1:41:05] some that they're loved, that they would
[1:41:07] never want to go against the word, that
[1:41:09] God loves them, that I love them, their
[1:41:10] mother loves them. I hope you hear me
[1:41:12] today. It it's not that I'm forcing them
[1:41:15] to stay, but I'm just it's just so much
[1:41:17] love that they can't go. They don't want
[1:41:19] to go. They want to I don't mean that
[1:41:21] they have to stay home, but they want to
[1:41:22] stay in the house of God. They want to
[1:41:24] stay in fellowship with God's people.
[1:41:26] How do we do that? By overwhelming love.
[1:41:29] How did God do it for you? He elected
[1:41:31] you. He called you. He predestinated
[1:41:33] you. And he overwhelmed you
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; until all you could do was respond,
[1:41:38] "Yes, Lord.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Oh, I I want my self-will to
[1:41:43] just be an open door. Yes, Lord.
[1:41:45] Whatever you want for me, I want to give
[1:41:48] to you.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the only way in is
[1:41:52] through self-will."
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If any man will come after
[1:41:56] me," in other words, let's say it this
[1:41:58] way, "If any man will be a tabernacle, a
[1:42:00] sanctuary for for deity,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; let him take up his cross daily
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; and follow me.
[1:42:08] He has made a way as the great high
[1:42:11] priest and entrance into the holy place.
[1:42:14] Now we have to go in. Brother said once
[1:42:18] was death to go in. Now it's death to
[1:42:20] stay out. The whole mercy seat is
[1:42:22] sitting in plain view. Anybody can see
[1:42:24] it. The veil is rent. Glory to God. The
[1:42:27] whole mercy seat comes into plain view.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:32] If we are his sanctuary in Listen, now
[1:42:35] think about that for a minute. This is
[1:42:36] where I wanted to come to.
[1:42:39] If we are his sanctuary, then everything
[1:42:42] in the that was in the sanctuary is in
[1:42:45] reality in us. Everything that was a
[1:42:48] type in the sanctuary is in a reality in
[1:42:51] us. What did the sanctuary contain? The
[1:42:53] sanctuary contained the ark and the
[1:42:56] cherubam.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Oh my. I believe there's
[1:43:00] worship.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's worship in the
[1:43:04] sanctuary. Yes.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; In the sanctuary was the ark
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; containing three things. The tablets of
[1:43:13] stone, the brother said that was the two
[1:43:16] covenants, old and new testament,
[1:43:18] the written word,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; but it wasn't just dead letter because
[1:43:22] the shikina was there.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Oh church.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; So in the sanctuary, so we could say it
[1:43:28] this way. In your heart is the word.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; If you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:43:32] Ghost, in your heart is the word. And
[1:43:35] the word is not just not just dormant,
[1:43:37] but the word is a living thing to you.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; In your heart is the golden bowl of
[1:43:43] mana,
[1:43:45] the revealed word.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; That's why Come on, church. You say, "I
[1:43:50] got the Holy Ghost." But you got no
[1:43:51] desire for the message of the hour. I
[1:43:53] wonder about that.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Because in your heart, in the sanctuary
[1:43:57] is the golden bowl of mana.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Right. The hidden mana. Hallelujah.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; In your heart. That's what in your heart
[1:44:05] and your you you want that. You desire
[1:44:07] that.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; In your heart is Aaron's rod that
[1:44:11] budded.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my. In you is the word.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; In you is also the power to make that
[1:44:18] word live.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; So that you wouldn't be just a dead dry
[1:44:21] stick, but that you would be Oh, if I
[1:44:23] never preach another sermon, I want you
[1:44:25] to hear this this morning. In you is the
[1:44:27] in you is the word and the power to make
[1:44:29] that word live. He said, "I'm waiting on
[1:44:31] the church to have a revival." Brother
[1:44:32] Brandham taught us. He said, he said,
[1:44:34] "That's not the revival for you." He
[1:44:36] said, "You pray for your church to have
[1:44:38] a revival. That's not the revival for
[1:44:40] you." He said, "But you get down on your
[1:44:41] knees and you get in your prayer closet
[1:44:43] and you say, Lord, make me the revival.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Make me the revival. Let me be a burning
[1:44:50] fire."
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me be a sanctuary for
[1:44:54] the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; If you are the sanctuary,
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; see, above that ark was a was a a shelf,
[1:45:01] a seat. a place where blood could be
[1:45:06] put,
[1:45:07] a lid if you will, on the ark of the
[1:45:09] covenant called the mercy seat.
[1:45:13] Oh my.
[1:45:16] Wood overlaid with cold deity, deity,
[1:45:21] and humanity. the mercy seat.
[1:45:27] Brother Brandham said, "Now, if if
[1:45:29] you're the sanctuary, all these things
[1:45:31] are represented in you. Then the mercy
[1:45:34] seat is represented in your heart."
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "Now the mercy
[1:45:38] seats in the heart, the seat where the
[1:45:41] shining forth of his glory in all of his
[1:45:44] children, the shakina glory in the human
[1:45:47] heart." Now, brother Bram goes to a
[1:45:49] blackboard and uses a blackboard. I
[1:45:51] don't feel bad. I know some people don't
[1:45:53] like uh powerpoints. I don't I just put
[1:45:55] quotes and scriptures on it mainly. But
[1:45:56] brother Brandham used a blackboard.
[1:45:59] And so he had a brother showed me a
[1:46:00] quote the other day where brother
[1:46:01] Brandham talked about doing some kind of
[1:46:02] digital. He didn't say digital, but he
[1:46:04] said some kind of electric thing. He
[1:46:06] said where he could just write it and it
[1:46:07] would come up on the on the screen. He
[1:46:09] was way ahead of his time. He was
[1:46:11] looking for PowerPoint, you know,
[1:46:14] but brother Brandon used a blackboard
[1:46:15] and he began to use his blackboard and
[1:46:17] he talked about he said, "How do you
[1:46:18] come through it into that through these
[1:46:20] different systems?" So he's talking
[1:46:21] about what we saw the the outer courts
[1:46:24] the inner courts the holy of holies
[1:46:27] he said through self-will. So how do you
[1:46:29] get on that inside part? Through
[1:46:31] self-will. Comes into here, through
[1:46:33] here, comes out what? Shakina glory.
[1:46:36] What is the shakina glory? It's God's
[1:46:39] presence. When a man's walking or a
[1:46:41] woman, he's reflecting the shakina
[1:46:44] glory.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; So we know that a man, can I have just a
[1:46:49] few more minutes?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; We won't have a second service today.
[1:46:53] A man who has entered the Holy of Holies
[1:46:56] is forever changed.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; How many know that?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Let's not think about time for a minute.
[1:47:05] Let's think about the word
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; just a minute.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; It's forever changed.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; See there when Moses remember what he
[1:47:16] did the here was an attraction on the
[1:47:19] mountain? It was a a burning fire, a
[1:47:22] bush that didn't burn. And he begins to
[1:47:25] go towards it and a voice spoke and
[1:47:28] said, "Take off your shoes. You're
[1:47:30] standing on holy ground." Brother
[1:47:31] Brandon taught us, he said, he didn't
[1:47:33] take off his hat. He took off his shoes
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; because that's what the voice said to
[1:47:37] do. So when he come in full obedience,
[1:47:40] the shikina invited him into its
[1:47:42] presence
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; so the word could be revealed to him and
[1:47:46] his purpose could be revealed. So we
[1:47:49] find that when he come in there, he went
[1:47:51] in there broken down, running from God,
[1:47:54] backsliden,
[1:47:56] 80year-old man, comes out on fire. His
[1:48:00] face changed. Everything about him
[1:48:03] changed. Why? He had been in the
[1:48:05] presence, Brother Brandon said, five
[1:48:06] minutes in the presence of that burning
[1:48:08] bush did more for him than 40 years
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; in a seminary.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; So the the presence of that burning bush
[1:48:16] changed him.
[1:48:18] But we know
[1:48:20] one day,
[1:48:22] listen, when you come in the presence of
[1:48:24] God, we appreciate that so much.
[1:48:27] But one day the mercy seat will become a
[1:48:29] judgment seat. How many know that?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; I believe that's when the bride is taken
[1:48:33] off the earth. I don't believe as long
[1:48:36] as we're here that the mercy seat can be
[1:48:38] taken away. We've already shown you the
[1:48:40] mercy seat's in the heart of the people.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; But the mercy seat, the mercy seat's in
[1:48:45] your heart. But now, one day the Bible
[1:48:48] says, "He that thou letteth will let
[1:48:50] until he be taken out of the way."
[1:48:51] That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Right. And then the Antichrist comes in.
[1:48:55] So one day the mercy seat becomes a
[1:48:58] judgment seat.
[1:49:00] Now hang with me just for a moment. Look
[1:49:03] at Revelation 15 and verse 5.
[1:49:07] Everybody okay this morning?
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; If you're asleep, I'll try not to wake
[1:49:13] you up. Revelation 15:5. After that, I
[1:49:16] looked and behold, the temple of the
[1:49:18] tabernacle of the testimony in heaven
[1:49:20] was open. So now watch, he's tying this.
[1:49:24] The temple, the tabernacle, the of
[1:49:25] testimony is what they had in the
[1:49:26] wilderness. So he said there was one in
[1:49:28] heaven and it was open because remember
[1:49:31] what they made on the earth was just a
[1:49:33] type of what was in heaven. He said,
[1:49:35] "And the seven angels come out of the
[1:49:36] temple having the seven plagues, clothed
[1:49:39] in pure and white linen, having their
[1:49:40] breasts girdled with golden girdles. And
[1:49:42] one of the four beasts gave unto the
[1:49:44] seven angels seven golden vials full of
[1:49:46] the wrath of God who liveth forever and
[1:49:47] ever. And the temple was filled with
[1:49:51] smoke from the glory of God from his
[1:49:55] power and no man was able to enter into
[1:49:59] the temple till the seven plagues of the
[1:50:00] seven angels were fulfilled. Now it's
[1:50:02] interesting brother Brandham takes that
[1:50:04] and and brother Brandon talks about how
[1:50:06] the sanctuary became smoky.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it wasn't at the presence of
[1:50:11] God arriving,
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; but it was when he was leaving,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; right? So he lives. Oh my,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; he lives. It was his presence.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; So do you realize this morning that most
[1:50:27] people are not God conscious?
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; They're they're not conscious of the
[1:50:33] shikina. Yeah,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; it didn't bother the Babylonians any to
[1:50:38] walk right into the Holy of Holies
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; and tear it up.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Destroy the artifacts, destroy the the
[1:50:45] art, carry it away. The Philistines
[1:50:47] didn't bother them until things started
[1:50:49] to die and idols started to fall.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; But it didn't bother them, you know, to
[1:50:53] do it. It didn't bother offend their
[1:50:55] conscience any.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Why? They were not God conscience,
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; right? That's why people can sit in
[1:51:00] church and the presence of God can be
[1:51:02] there, just sitting there chewing gum or
[1:51:03] whatever they want to do, you know, and
[1:51:05] just keep on doing what they're doing
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; because there's no God consciousness.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; But but yet, oh God, there's going to
[1:51:13] come a day when the presence of God is
[1:51:16] lifted.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; The shiny is lifted from the earth. I'm
[1:51:21] so glad I won't be here. I don't believe
[1:51:23] I'll be here.
[1:51:25] But brother Brandham taught us and he
[1:51:26] actually picks up on something Brother
[1:51:28] Neville said. Brother Neville made the
[1:51:30] statement that most people won't even
[1:51:31] know
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; that the mercy seat has been abandoned.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; This ought to show us the value of being
[1:51:41] a Christian of hearing the message of
[1:51:43] the hour of knowing that that we're in
[1:51:45] the fullness of the word has been
[1:51:46] revealed.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Most people won't even know because they
[1:51:50] never had his presence indwelling in
[1:51:52] their life.
[1:51:54] So that's why they can do the worst
[1:51:56] things. They can never repent of it. Go
[1:51:58] on and pretend to be a Christian.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; They don't even know when he's not
[1:52:03] there.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; That's like Samson
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; when he goes when he gets his hair cut
[1:52:08] off.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; He's gotten so familiar
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; with the presence of God, he just
[1:52:14] assumes it'll always be there.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says he went out as at
[1:52:19] other times before and he wished not. He
[1:52:23] didn't know that the presence of God had
[1:52:26] departed from him,
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it. He was beaten
[1:52:30] and tied up and his eyes were put out
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; because he didn't know.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; He laid in the lap of Delilah for so
[1:52:37] long that he'd become numb to the
[1:52:40] absence of the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:46] like a person would sit in a catatonic
[1:52:48] state
[1:52:49] &gt;&gt; maybe on a Netflix binge or something
[1:52:51] like that and or video gaming and just
[1:52:53] sit there wouldn't even know if someone
[1:52:55] come in the house
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; or out of the house right
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; cuz they never had his presence
[1:53:04] indwelling their life said they don't
[1:53:07] know the Holy Spirit so they won't know
[1:53:10] when it's gone and they'll just be going
[1:53:12] right on just the same.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; When the last one is sealed into the
[1:53:16] body of Christ, they'll still be going
[1:53:18] on trying to bring converts to it.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; Do you realize, church? I hope there we
[1:53:25] want to spread the message everywhere
[1:53:26] it'll go, but there will still be people
[1:53:29] trying to get books printed and tapes
[1:53:31] sent out and
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; after.
[1:53:38] He said they'll still be trying to bring
[1:53:41] people into the body of Christ, trying
[1:53:43] to bring people to the Holy Ghost,
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; not even knowing it's already gone,
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; trying to bring converts to it because
[1:53:51] they don't know what it is.
[1:53:53] And their formal religions will continue
[1:53:56] on just like they were.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on us, brother. He said,
[1:54:01] I'd like to live in this life. Could
[1:54:02] this be our prayer this morning as we're
[1:54:04] coming down to a close? Could this be
[1:54:06] our prayer? God have mercy on us. I
[1:54:08] would like to live in this life and my
[1:54:10] desire to lift even the least bit of his
[1:54:13] grieving.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; I'll know it in my heart.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; See, brother Ben, can you grieve the
[1:54:18] Holy Ghost as a Christian? Absolutely
[1:54:20] you can. Cuz Paul says, "Grieve not the
[1:54:22] Holy Spirit, whereby you're sealed till
[1:54:24] the day of your redemption."
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; You can grieve the Holy Ghost. Listen.
[1:54:29] He said, "I want to live so close to
[1:54:30] him. I'll know it in my heart. I should
[1:54:32] do something that would grieve him. I'd
[1:54:34] be able to feel it."
[1:54:36] I know that people say feelings don't
[1:54:39] count, but I want to be able to know.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; If I get cold and hard and critical,
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Gossiping and carrying
[1:54:48] on.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; I want to be able to know.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; If I get to dabbling in things of the
[1:54:55] world that aren't right,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; if I get to doing something that's not
[1:54:58] right. If I get to not treating my wife
[1:54:59] respectfully or or you you husband
[1:55:02] respectfully. Come on, church. I want to
[1:55:05] know.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; I want to be sensitive enough to the
[1:55:08] presence of God that I know he's not
[1:55:10] there anymore.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says he flies up when we
[1:55:15] take on a wolf nature. He flies up in
[1:55:17] the gable end of our soul.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll know it in my heart. If I
[1:55:23] should do something to grieve him, I'd
[1:55:25] be able to feel it
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; just in a moment." Let alone his
[1:55:29] absence.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; See, he said, "Just if I grieved him."
[1:55:33] He said, "I'd want to know it." Let
[1:55:36] alone his absence. I don't want to be
[1:55:39] here when he's not here.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all struggle with whether or
[1:55:44] not you have even have the Holy Ghost.
[1:55:45] And you struggle with that and think,
[1:55:47] "Do I even have it? Is there even any,
[1:55:50] you know,
[1:55:51] if you were did without it for a while?"
[1:55:54] If you're a real Christian, you'd know
[1:55:55] it.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; You'd know it. But yet, we can get so
[1:56:00] numb to it.
[1:56:02] You don't realize all he does for you.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; You don't recognize what he keeps you
[1:56:09] from.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; We all don't. Or we would value it more.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; We'd value time in his presence.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Not get so anxious to get up and go,
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; but value the time
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; that we have to worship.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:56:27] If we really recognize how important it
[1:56:29] was,
[1:56:30] he said, "I don't want to be here when
[1:56:32] he's not here. I want to be gone then."
[1:56:33] Yes, sir. For there will be no blood on
[1:56:36] the mercy seat.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; It'll be dark and smoky and black.
[1:56:41] The sanctuary will have no lawyer there
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; to plead our case at that time. And you
[1:56:46] know something? If I ever get ar I've
[1:56:48] never been arrested. I've never been
[1:56:50] questioned. I've never been pulled out
[1:56:51] of my vehicle. But if I ever did, you
[1:56:54] know, they ask these people, "Do you
[1:56:55] want a lawyer?" No, no. I'll answer
[1:56:57] questions. Give me a lawyer.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I don't like lawyers, but give me a
[1:57:05] lawyer.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; I want somebody on my behalf. I don't
[1:57:10] want to represent myself. I want
[1:57:11] somebody who's trained to do that to
[1:57:13] represent me. Don't you realize the Holy
[1:57:15] Ghost is your attorney?
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; And when the Holy Ghost leaves the
[1:57:18] earth, there'll be no more lawyer.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I need my pariclete. That's
[1:57:25] what that means. Our advocate, our
[1:57:27] lawyer before the father. I need my
[1:57:30] advocate with God. I need that. He said,
[1:57:33] "There'll be no more lawyer there to
[1:57:35] plead our case at that time."
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; You know, the scripture says that the
[1:57:40] sanctuary was smoking.
[1:57:44] God, not with his presence arriving, but
[1:57:46] with his presence leaving.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; No blood on the mercy seat.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Then his judgment. I want to tell you
[1:57:54] this morning as the musicians come,
[1:57:56] without the presence of God, Aaron's rod
[1:57:59] is just a dead stick.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Without the presence of God, the mana is
[1:58:06] spoiled
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; and we don't want to hear the message no
[1:58:09] more. We don't want to listen to it no
[1:58:11] more. Why the presence of God isn't
[1:58:12] there no more?
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; What's happened?
[1:58:16] Have we out of stubbornness held on to
[1:58:18] things?
[1:58:20] You're making plans. I don't know who
[1:58:22] I'm talking to this morning, but you're
[1:58:24] making plans to do things you know are
[1:58:26] against the word.
[1:58:30] Well, when I go home or I go on vacation
[1:58:33] or
[1:58:36] this is the plan for my life and you
[1:58:38] know that's not what the word wants out
[1:58:40] of your life. Some of you young men, you
[1:58:42] know that you're sitting and think I'm
[1:58:44] going to be the next rock star. I'm
[1:58:45] going to be the next football player and
[1:58:47] you know that's not what God wants out
[1:58:49] of your life. You may be a football
[1:58:50] player, but
[1:58:53] listen, I don't see how I I know every
[1:58:56] young man wants to be in the NFL, but I
[1:58:58] don't see how you could live that life
[1:59:01] and be a Christian. I don't see it,
[1:59:03] church, not a real Christian. You want
[1:59:06] to grow up and do things, you need to
[1:59:08] surrender that to God. You let God have
[1:59:10] that. Some of you older people, you you
[1:59:12] you make you're about to make decisions
[1:59:14] and we sit there, we consciously make
[1:59:16] decisions that are against the word, and
[1:59:17] we think, well, I just get by with it.
[1:59:19] know there'll come a time you don't even
[1:59:21] know that the presence of God has
[1:59:23] departed. But if you can feel that this
[1:59:26] morning, if you can know that his
[1:59:27] presence, I I just feel it, but it's not
[1:59:30] like it used to be, then it's time to
[1:59:32] dedicate ourselves again in the house of
[1:59:35] the Lord. I know it's Labor Day weekend.
[1:59:36] I know we're about to go out and have
[1:59:38] some fun and eat some food and do some
[1:59:40] things. But I'll tell you this, we ought
[1:59:42] to have a time and dedication in the
[1:59:44] house of God that said, "Lord, help me
[1:59:46] that I'll keep your word. Help me that
[1:59:48] I'll do what the message teaches me to
[1:59:50] do. Help me that I will not leave your
[1:59:52] presence and it will not leave me. I
[1:59:54] don't want to grieve you, Lord, by my
[1:59:57] actions.
[1:59:59] Say, "Well, I deserve it."
[2:00:01] Oh, you don't know what you're doing to
[2:00:03] yourself.
[2:00:06] You don't know what you're doing to
[2:00:08] yourself. I deserve that cigarette. I
[2:00:10] deserve that grudge. I deserve that
[2:00:13] bitterness. You don't know what you're
[2:00:15] doing to yourself.
[2:00:20] See, without the presence of God,
[2:00:21] Aaron's rod is just a dead stick.
[2:00:25] Without his shikina presence, the mana
[2:00:28] is spoiled.
[2:00:29] And without his presence, the tablets
[2:00:31] are just words written on stone.
[2:00:36] But we want his presence every day in
[2:00:38] the sanctuary.
[2:00:40] And I believe if he's in this sanctuary,
[2:00:43] he'll fill the room that we're in so it
[2:00:45] could be a help to others maybe who need
[2:00:47] to enter in the room we are in and in
[2:00:51] our hearts.
[2:00:52] Would you just bow your heads with me
[2:00:54] today? I I know it's been somber and
[2:00:57] maybe not a a shouting thing, but this I
[2:01:01] have to preach what God puts on my
[2:01:02] heart.
[2:01:06] Are you drifting?
[2:01:10] I'm preaching to myself, too.
[2:01:15] Are you drifting?
[2:01:17] So easy to do in Leona.
[2:01:21] I know some of y'all are struggling. I
[2:01:22] know that. I
[2:01:24] Some people are struggling and just just
[2:01:26] to make it in life. Some people
[2:01:27] financially or maybe you take on too
[2:01:30] much and you're unable to do it all.
[2:01:35] I know people struggle. That don't mean
[2:01:37] you're drifting from God. But if you are
[2:01:40] drifting from God, can you feel that
[2:01:42] separation?
[2:01:47] See, in order to be a real Christian and
[2:01:49] live for God the way we ought to, do you
[2:01:50] realize what has to happen? The pain of
[2:01:52] the separation has to be more has to be
[2:01:56] greater than the pleasure of whatever we
[2:01:59] want to do, whatever the flesh wants to
[2:02:02] do.
[2:02:04] Oh, I'd just live like the world. I'd
[2:02:06] just be a regular guy, but but Lord, I
[2:02:09] don't want to be separate from you.
[2:02:13] I'd treat my wife in that way, but I
[2:02:15] Lord, I don't want to be separate from
[2:02:16] you.
[2:02:18] Treat my husband that way, but I don't
[2:02:19] want to be separate from you.
[2:02:23] I'd tell them stories and gossip and
