my plate so we'll try to get you out of here just as soon as we can it's a good good to see you tonight and those that are watching on those several that weren't able to come tonight but I pray the Lord would bless you as well First Corinthians chapter 12 and verse 8 we're going to continue our study on spiritual gifts tonight for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit we're going to call attention to that word of knowledge tonight let's bow our heads maybe you had a special unspoken request you'd like to make known tonight I know God sees each and every one of those hands our heavenly father we're so grateful to be here in your presence Lord and to to think Lord that you've come down to be here with us we thank you for

are sick meet every one of these needs that were represented by uplifted hand I I pray that you'd meet every one of them you know what they are Lord and we thank you for that we give you the praise and the honor and the glory in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you can be seated when brother Branham came on the scene in the 1940s one of the things that the Pentecostals tried to do and were unsuccessful in doing was trying to to determine what gift that he had uh they tried to say that he had a word of knowledge or a word of discernment a gift of discernment and actually they they missed it it was actually a huge mistake on their part because they thought he was just another Gifted Man but he wasn't just another Gifted Man he was a prophet and not just a prophet but the messenger to the age and so they missed it because they were used to gifts it was an age of kiss when the gifts had been restored and they were used to these nine spiritual gifts working in the body and yet they did not see that a prophet was among them now there is again there's a difference between a prophet and the nine spiritual gifts and I want to make this clear tonight as clear as I can because my view of the gifts has actually been broadened and changed a little bit since I just since I started studying this and and I don't know if it's done you any good or not but for me I really and I've studied ahead and and I've been working on these things and reading things brother Branham said reading the scriptures and it really changed my thinking in some ways but that's what the word's supposed to do is that right we're not supposed to conform uh the word to our ideas of the way things are but we're supposed to conform our ideas to the word I mean believe that tonight so brother Branham explains to us that there are nine spiritual gifts and then there are predestined gifts I want to make sure I make this clear before I move on tonight the predestined gifts to the body fall on the body and God uses individuals in that body in different ways but they are not predestined gifts predestined to a particular person but they fall on the body they're in the body listen how brother Branham explains this he says many people gets it mixed up sometimes about gifts and callings he said gifts and callings are without repentance God for ordains those things and sends them to the Earth and then it vindicates them what they are he said here not long ago a person walked Walked to me he said many times they do and said thus saith the Lord can you imagine someone going up to a Vindicated prophet and saying thus saith the Lord I'm just that in itself would take some courage right but they didn't understand who he was so they said thus saith the Lord the Lord said do this he said if you didn't go to a certain place or a certain thing and do a certain thing the Lord's going to strike you and take this gift away from you so they they would come to brother Brandon and say you need to come to my church and hold a Revival and if you don't the Lord's going to take your gift away from you and so he said now that isn't true he said that isn't true gifts and callings are without repentance he said there is Spirits that's in the church he said that's true such as gifts of Prophecy healing and so forth but they're in the entire body he said they may fall upon one person tonight A Prophecy and it might not never fall on that person and again so you might be a person who says well I've never spoken tongues I've never prophesied I've never done that you know you just get real close to God you may never but you might right you might when you get close to God but uh you you just get in the spirit of that but but that's that's not the same as being a prophet or being a predestined gift to the church or being a minister for that matter he said it might not never fall on that person again it might be somewhere else in the body and those Spirits are supposed to be judged Brother Brad was very clear about this we'll get more into it when we get to prophecy and and the sign gifts tongues and interpretation he said let one speak and two or three judge said Paul he said now those are the spirits of the gifts that's in the church but the only person that has a right to say thus saith the Lord is a Vindicated Prophet right right to remember that someone tells you thus saith the Lord this and this is going to happen be careful because he said the one who has a right to say thus saith the Lord is a Vindicated prophet he said you never seen anybody judging Isaiah or Jeremiah or those people and that's why you can't be held by fear right if someone come to you and say if you reject me or you're going to die you're going to get in a car wreck you're going to have we've all heard that nonsense if you go against our church you're going to have all kinds of bad things happen to you it's nonsense the one who has thus saith the Lord is a prophet and and you you know you may reject my idea of what he said but you can't reject the word he brought that's what you don't want to reject and and so they brother Brandon said these prophets he said you never saw anybody judging Isaiah or Jeremiah or are those prophets he said they were prophets for ordained and born in the world to be prophets and they forced all the thing by a vision and then said thus saith the Lord for the Lord had already said it right so again brother Branham says there's nine spiritual gifts in the church they operate anywhere in the church he said for instance if this tent here tonight concealed the entire body of Christ so let's say this church concealed the entire body of Christ we know that's not true but if it was he said it might he said the Holy Spirit leads the body of Christ and in this body there's nine spiritual gifts he said they are here in the body Gifts of healing Gifts of Prophecy he said it might fall upon someone here tonight he said this lady sitting here this man or this man he may give a prophecy and it would be true but it would never work on him maybe again So when you say brother Joel might prophesy might prophesy something and it come to pass but it may never work on him again he said see that doesn't make him a prophet he said that makes we're in the body aren't you glad to be in the body tonight he said by one Spirit we're baptized in the body and subject to these gifts he said and when the body's sitting here remember what Paul said is something to be revealed to one setting by let him hold his peace and so forth like that he said that's the apostolic church that's where it should be now he said and here might be one tonight with a prayer of faith that would pray a prayer of faith that would heal someone that gift of healing might be on them tonight you see why it's so important for us to be a part of the body and to be in the house of God and to be together you realize why Satan fights that so much because those gifts operate in the body and you might have you might be the one that has a prayer a gift of faith tonight that would be able I may not have it you might have it you might have that gift of faith or that gift of healing he said it might be on them tonight he said it might be on this lady here tomorrow night upon this man over here the next night he might come back to her he said it's in the church the body he said now these are the nine spiritual gifts that's in the body now he said they work through the body but then there is gifts and callings without repentance see you see the difference tonight so one is is a gift or something that falls on you it's something that that you're enabled to do by the Holy Spirit but another is a calling or an office gift he always taught this on on down to the end of his ministry in 1962 he said now there's he said there's nine spiritual gifts that goes in each local body which is tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies and so forth he said but there's five predestinated offices of the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists he said that's what God Said in the church that's what God Said in the church he said the Holy Spirit that's an office yes yes he said the Holy Spirit might fall in one tonight and speak in tongues and the other give the prophecy and so forth and then next night it might be on somebody else and somebody else like that he said that's local gifts in the body to keep us straight he said but in the church alone five offices Apostles means missionaries Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists God sets those in the church so we know both kinds of gifts are from God remember what we read I think was last week every good gift comes from God right but and both fall on the just and the unjust right you could have a a person with a predestined office that wasn't a predestined person yes yes right they could have a calling a real Calling to be a preacher or to be even a prophet but they wouldn't be the prophet to the age you understand because the prophet to the age you cannot you can't have a prophet to the age that falls does that make sense because the very fact of his ministry we can look back and prove that it was what God said it would be but yet he's human being but he was predestined to a certain place and to finish his work but now you could be a pastor an evangelist or a prophet or an apostle or a teacher and you could you could fall from that position but you'd still have the gift but that's different from a spiritual gift another is a gift that falls in the body now again there's another difference between that and natural Talent right some people can just sing right God gave them that gift but it's not necessarily a spiritual gift that works in the body right or else it'd have to be judged should we sure would hate to have our singing judged right it would be prophecy or something like that the nine spiritual gifts had to be judged but you might have a singing gift you might have a gift to help you might have a gift of some other kind so those those are gifts that come from God but it's things that God has enabled you to do right so when we look at a word of knowledge let's look at that tonight for just a few moments now the word knowledge is gnosis which is in the Greek is something it's cognitive knowledge or understanding understanding Mary uses this word when she sings about Jesus when she's pregnant with with Christ and she sings this he said she speaks of him to give knowledge of Salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins so Jesus was to bring a kind of knowledge or an understanding that they didn't have before so that's what this kind of knowledge is now Jesus in Luke 11 52 accuses the Pharisees of taking away this kind of knowledge and the key to it he says woe unto you lawyers for you have taken away the key of knowledge you entered not in yourselves and them that we're entering in you hindered so they were they were wanting to come into the revelation of the day they were wanting to understand the word of the hour and the Pharisees were standing there locking them out of it by their traditions and their crates can't you see that same thing happening today right in the denominational Realms and even in message Realms now so we find in this age we have an understanding how many believe that tonight we have an understanding that many people don't have and it doesn't it's not to make us to to uh to Puff us up we'll get to that in a moment that's not what it's for but it's for a reason we've got to have knowledge we have to have faith and then we have to add to our faith knowledge and so we must have Godly knowledge understanding is essential now what you don't understand you still need to believe right if you don't understand it you believe it if it's the word of God yeah but you want to understand it I don't say this a true Eagle understands the things that need to be understood right they may not understand all the ins and outs and and the where forests and all the different things they may not understand all the technicalities but that's not the kind of understanding we're talking about we're talking about Godly knowledge they understand the things that they need to understand brother Branham teaches us that he goes he takes that from John chapter 5 and verse 24. you'll have to excuse me tonight I'm I'm fighting through my voice tonight so and it's not it's not really from preaching too much it's just from the uh from the trees and things and the pollen that's out there so oh just forgive me tonight John 5 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death into life now a Baptist person would say well if you if you hear the word then that's it right but brother Brown takes that and he uses the original Greek which is actually uh the original Greek is to understand it's more than just to hear but it's actually and it with an emphasis on the accurate understanding of what is spoken he said now to prove that's right he says I go down here here's a drunk coming along the street with some other man's wife on his arms and cussing and taking God's name in vain everything else like that and said say did you hear what that preacher said did you yeah I heard it he said that don't mean he's got eternal life this stuff today well if you hear the tapes here you've got it I don't give you eternal life hearing a certain preacher doesn't give you eternal life but he that understandeth my word he that is an eagle amen he is an eagle Hallelujah now we we need knowledge we need understanding and yet even Knowledge from God can be used wrong knowledge even from God can be used in the wrong way now in First Corinthians chapter 8 and verse 1 we find the Corinthians had knowledge and they were actually it caused them to be puffed up in their minds they begin to be uh instead of it causing them to love their neighbor more it actually caused them to uh cause Strife because of their knowledge he said he's speaking about things offered to Idols meat that's offered to Idols he said we know that we all have knowledge he said but knowledge puffeth up but charity edifies so even knowledge has to be guarded by love hey man all of the gifts do by the way all of the gifts have to be operated by love even the ministry gifts have to be operated by love he said speak the truth in love Lord help us tonight so knowledge has to be constrained by love now and he goes on and says are you going to let your your weak brother perish because of your knowledge through your knowledge well your weak brother perish because you just insist on doing things you know they're the right things to do but you offend somebody so knowledge got to be constrained by love Paul says in First Corinthians 13 2 though I have the gift of Prophecy and I understand all Mysteries and all knowledge wouldn't that be nice wouldn't it be nice to understand all Mysteries whether JT all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love I am nothing right brother said love God's love he said it'll take the place of speaking in tongues and that's all right in other words it's all right to speak in tongues he said but love he said we'll take that place it'll take the place of gifts and wonders and signs and everything else he said if you haven't got love to accompany that what good does the signs do he said the greatest of all the gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge he said but we've gone after gifts we've gone after this we've gone after that because the supernatural was done but brother don't seek gifts he said don't seek favor with the nomination seek the love of God or could we do that tonight seek the love of God that's what we need to seek now the word of knowledge is not again it's a gift for the edification of the body understand that tonight is it's not you understanding something although knowledge Godly knowledge could be that you understanding something but the gift the word of knowledge is is you it's basically making someone understand something they didn't understand even if you didn't understand it yourself right that's the way that gift would operate and it would operate it would always operate within boundaries and and we'll get to that in a moment because there's any of these gifts if you take if you take a gift of Prophecy it operates within certain boundaries you take a gift of tongues it operates within certain boundaries because you are your office you say uh you're a housewife well you're you're a housewife that that's your office in God you're you're a wife you're uh you're uh you were called by God to be that that's a high position that's a great position in the day and age that we live in but but you're not called to stand up here and preach the word right so your word of knowledge would be limited by what you are right we're a person a preacher with a word of knowledge could would do much more with that than someone else would so it's always going to stay at the Spirit of the prophets always going to be subject to the prophets it's always going to stay within its boundaries light of Who You Are so that's why Paul says let the older women teach the younger women right there's a place for them to give knowledge to somebody but it's not in the in the house of God are you with me now I know that's not popular today but it's the truth and so now uh brother Brown says this he says he speaks of how the word of knowledge operated within his own Ministry he said when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that is the completion of the Holy Spirit taking up its Abode in you to manifest gifts speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues Gifts of power wisdom knowledge understanding he said the man said last night said where did you get your education for these things he said well said I've come out of great seminaries we've never had such as that ever taught in a seminary I ever heard I said it don't come from Seminary I said I'm poor with a seventh grade education he said 10 15 years ago I couldn't hardly write my own name he said I can't do much better today but it comes through inspiration I said then watch it now remember first of all he's a prophet yeah right he's a prophet so that that's Works differently with him than it would with you or I but it kind of gives you an insight into how it works he said why he said he said you never watch where you're going in the Bible he said you just grab the thing and run all through the Bible and and said it just all comes right together I said an hour after I get out of the pool but I couldn't tell you what I said right see it's not me I don't know he said see it's him putting it together yeah he said I don't know see I can't tell you now that gift there was brother Branham always there was things that he would say even before the opening of the word and this great Revelation that we have at the in 1963 at the opening of the seals but you go back to 1947 brother random preaches the deity of Jesus Christ and preaches baptism in Jesus name and Divine Healing and things that the people he was years decades before his time right and people didn't even understand it but he didn't even understand it himself until later right much of it he didn't understand himself he said it's not me doing that he said it's him putting it together he said I don't know see I can't tell you he said I just get up here and something strikes me and I just know the scriptures like that he said you might ask me the scripture an hour later I wouldn't know but it just comes like that he said you watch and see if it's right or wrong once he Compares that to the discernment line how it's never wrong he said I haven't got anything to do with it he said I just yield myself to the Holy Spirit and he does the talking he said there's the whole thing he said so it isn't I it's not me he said if you judge that he said if you judge that I have the Holy Spirit then it's the Holy Spirit if you judge that it isn't the Holy Spirit you might think it was the devil but the thing of it is now watch where he takes it now this is where every gift has to come to he said compare it with this and see what it Compares with he said the Holy Spirit wrote this yes yes so if it Compares with that and brings that out truth then it must be of God right so these gifts let me say this these gifts do not operate out of fear neither do the ministry gifts right you don't operate these gifts as a way of holding fear over people we have the gifts and others don't or I have a gift and you don't see you better listen to me not even the gift of a pastor that's not what it's about right it's not out of fear but the gift because you have the Holy Ghost you know whether to accept or reject it you don't have to be afraid of tongues you don't have to be afraid of Prophecy you don't have to be afraid of a word of knowledge you don't have to be afraid of a Preacher standing in the Pulpit you're the Bride of Jesus Christ number one you can't be deceived right because you're the bride so you don't have to be afraid of that you can tell right from wrong I can't well first of all you need to be baptized with the Holy Ghost to re-baptize with the Holy Ghost because he's the one who leads you into all truth and then if you've been baptized with the Holy Spirit and you have the token on the inside of you then what you need to do is study the word find out if it's right or not study the scriptures and see whether these things are true you can do that yes every one of us can do that we ought to be studying the message this message has value it's not a second Earth it's not Spurgeon Spurgeon has value but that's not what this message is right right these other things these men have value but they're not what this message is this message is the message of the hour given for our day we need to get into it we shouldn't be afraid of that right say well if my pastor Don't Preach it I don't know if I can believe it you can believe it if God said it [Applause] right right so now again this would be done decently in an order according to the office that you have in the church or the office that you have at home or the office of Who You Are so what is Godly knowledge so let's look at that for just a moment as distinct from worldly knowledge this knowledge is a part of the divine nature it's distinct from worldly knowledge because we know that comes from Satan that's the knowledge that the serpent gave to Eve if you go to Second Peter chapter one he talks about knowledge he talks about knowledge actually several times in second Peter chapter one he said Grace and peace multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord so here he's speaking of knowledge and it must be Godly knowledge because it's not the knowledge that is against faith he said and the knowledge of God of Jesus our lord verse 3 according is his divine power is given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue so here and he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you may be partakers of the divine nature so knowledge the knowledge of God or the understanding of God comes from the divine nature of God himself he said having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust he said beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge so that's one of the steps on the pyramid that brother Branham talked about that we we're constantly adding these things now he said knowledge he said now he said that don't mean worldly knowledge he said because that's foolishness to God right but knowledge to judge Now watch how he takes this to judge right from wrong he said how do you judge it then he said if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your Creeds and all your unbelief everything that you claim that you have done he said then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie let every man's word be alive but mine be true that's a powerful quote if you can lay aside what you claim you've done yeah but it's a lie compared to the word right let my word be alive and God's word be true that's knowledge all right what is it it's knowledge and I condense these things these are the things that brother Branham said but I condensed it uh just so that if you're writing it down you can see it this actual quotes that brother Brown uses he said his knowledge and this is from the statue of a perfect man knowledge of what knowledge that what God Said God is able to perform hey man how many have that kind of knowledge tonight that is the knowledge that we're talking about so a word of knowledge would be somehow supernaturally God falling among the body and and conveying that to somebody else that that what God Said God is able to perform and he uses the type of Abraham Abraham had knowledge of God he knew that God God told him he'd have a child it was 25 years later he still believed it in fact his faith increased it didn't decrease that's true Godly knowledge right so again he says knowledge that the Bible doesn't contradict itself that's Godly knowledge right so the God said God was able to perform and the the Bible doesn't contradict itself and he uses the example of Matthew 28 19 and Acts 2 38 somebody can come to you and say well I got all kinds of knowledge but the scripture is all messed up the scripture doesn't make sense I believe this instead of the scripture they don't have Godly knowledge right that knowledge didn't come from God he said but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and concede that by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it I'm so glad for the knowledge of God in our day he said then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen he said then add that to your faith yeah yeah so he's saying make sure the knowledge that you're adding it's not the knowledge that YouTube will give you or some other thing some other platform where you've learned to doubt the word of God but it's the knowledge that confirms the word of God right so now you said add that to your faith again he says it's knowledge to judge whether I should be born again or join a church I think we all should know the answer to that one should I be born again or join a church you must be born again it's what this Bible knowledge tells you right knowledge that the days of Miracles is not past glory to God oh that's the knowledge that we have to have when we're talking even about these gifts and other things we have to have knowledge that that the days of Miracles has not passed he he said now he said next thing the preacher will tell you and many people say these things that you read in the Bible they were for another day he said now I'll tell you why he said because we don't need those things today he's quoting the the preacher that would say that he said we don't need it see we shouldn't we don't have to practice those things Divine Healing we don't we don't practice we don't practice speaking with tongues in the church to keep our church straight we don't do this now remember there's boundaries to that we're going to get to that for too long but but he said we don't practice that that's that's the knowledge of the world yeah he said I don't know we shouldn't do that today only thing I think we should do we should learn to speak properly before the crowd we should go let a psychiatrist test our mind to see if we're able to be able to present ourselves if our IQ it's high enough to do it and so forth like that he said and we hold the greatest congregations we build our organization he said Christ never sent me to build organization Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse in the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word that's Godly knowledge right but this other knowledge fee it'll it'll tell you that the Bible's not the same that God's Not the Same he said he said by uh he said by his word build up the individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to Sons and Daughters of God he said now when they begin to say well we don't have to accept that today he said you do have to yes right so wherever you're getting that Knowledge from you need to quit listening to the serpent because that's where that knowledge comes from that knowledge that tells you you're not going to make it right that understanding that tells you that you're you're not good enough you're you're you you don't qualify to be in the bride where does that come from comes from Satan yeah yeah and knowledge and accept the knowledge of God that sit by his stripes I'm Healed by I'm saved by the blood of Jesus Christ I am redeemed I'm going to heaven I'm going to make it it's the knowledge of God he says well you can't be saved you you're past the age of Salvation you need to accept the knowledge of God not the knowledge of man we're past the age of preachers that's the knowledge of man yeah well how can you say that but how can how can you say that definitively because a word Prophet came and said he was the same yesterday today and forever even and he said these were predestined gifts in the body I have to believe that that's the knowledge of God and anything else is a knowledge of man right but we can take that and apply it to every area of our life quit taking the knowledge of man yeah yeah you say well people today say well we shouldn't correct our children well what does the knowledge of God say all right people today say we we have to do certain things the world will tell you today I'll just go get a divorce just get it over with what does the knowledge of God say how we should treat one another the world will say the world will say do what's best for you huh dude whatever business deal you want to do do what's best for you but the knowledge of God says love your enemies I love them that despitefully use you love them more the more they use you that's the more that you love them that's the knowledge of God the knowledge of the world will tell you well uh you know I I got this feeling against somebody I'll just stay away from them but the knowledge of God has brotherly love in it and you'll go take care of that that's all that's that's hard isn't it but that we want the knowledge of God brother says the scriptures cannot lie oh my and they are no private interpretation the Bible said you just believe it the way it's written there he said you've got to have these things and the only way you'll ever be able to have them is to have heaven born knowledge and heaven born knowledge will vindicate the word hey man he said I believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will always someone say always will always punctuate the word with amen it might hurt me but amen it might feel bad but amen it might it might not fit with my preconceived notion but amen anyway amen thank the Lord he said when you get these things that seem to contradict themselves in the Bible he said you sit down and study it he said and prayerfully like that and the first thing you know the Holy Spirit begins to move in he said after a while you see it ties together and there you got it how many have ever experienced that where you sat down with the Bible and you prayerfully you're not rejecting it but you want to know and the holy spirit gives you knowledge he said the Holy Spirit begins to move in after a while you see it ties together and there you got it that's knowledge he said knowledge not worldly it reasons any kind of worldly knowledge reasons but faith has no reasoning he said well I got this person that I follow this psychiatrist or the psychologist that's fine as long as they have the knowledge of the word right but if it's the knowledge against the word don't follow it don't listen to it you say I've got this I've got this uh this family member they they always can they always help me and that's good it's good to take advice from people because so many people won't but don't take advice against the knowledge of the word right the blog that you read right about how to raise your family that's good that could be good as long as it's with the knowledge of the word but if it's against the knowledge of the word cast it down brother Brown says faith has no reasoning he said God reveals to you a certain certain thing is going to happen he said every scientist in the world could tell you it's contrary it could not happen you believe it anyhow isn't that what he's asked us to do with the Rapture every scientist in the world would tell you you're nuts every side belief for a change of the body shouldn't we be able to believe for these little things that we face every day shouldn't we be able to believe for our children if we believe that one day Brother David we're going to walk into a new body we believe we're going to see our loved one science would tell you you're crazy but we believe that why because of the knowledge of the word amen we need to have enough respect for the word to believe it I realize brother Branham was a man but when brother Brown talks about there will be a sweep go over you it's been all at once you'll see your loved ones walk in I don't doubt that I believe it yeah are you with me now yeah we got to come to that place we need to believe in amen because it fits with the knowledge of the scriptures and knowledge of God he said he said knowledge you know not worldly knowledge but it's Heavenly knowledge he said in Heavenly knowledge when God is the Fountain of all knowledge and God is the word he said then if you've got Heavenly knowledge you believe the word and you reason anything by the word he said now that kind of knowledge that you learn out of some book you better throw it out in the garbage can laughs remember what Paul said he said I had to count it all done to take Christ he said I come among you he said I didn't come with the men's wisdom though he could have but he said I come preaching Christ because I didn't know anything among you but Christ and him crucified Paul what do you know I know Christ oh what that would do for the world today if we could be like that what do you know I know Jesus I know Christ's been him crucified I know there's a better way I know the word is right yeah he said if it's the kind of knowledge you learn out of some book you better throw it out in the garbage can come to this knowledge when God said he's the same yesterday today and forever Say Amen he said yes sir he said not not to The Twelve in other words just it's not limited just to the disciples it's for all when you get that kind of a faith when your faith punctuates at every bit with an amen every bit he said then you say all right he said add that to it so a word of knowledge is going to tell you Godly knowledge what does the scripture say musicians go ahead and come I'm done tonight what does the scripture say cast down imaginations huh now think about this now I've read this to you a lot but think about this now in reference to gifts and especially the gift of knowledge if you have a knowledge of something a high thing something is speaking to you that exalts itself against the knowledge of God because we know Satan is in these Realms he's the prince of the power of the air right he comes and talks to you and you may not believe that but it's the truth he comes and talks to you that's why that's how he got his Eden the way that it is because he influences people he may not speak in an audible voice but he influences he uses Hollywood he uses he uses social media he uses the preachers of this world to influence the people to influence them to negativity to influence them to Suicide to influence them to these things when you have those imaginations when you when those high things begin to exalt themselves against the knowledge of God even if it's something you thought was true cast it down he said cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and let me say this about the gifts it means that my gift must be governed by the word right yes it's got to be governed even as a pastor got to be governed by the word and I can't go outside the message of the hour which is the light on the word on the Bible for our day brother Brown said don't do something I can't do it because I'm going to cast down every feeling every imagination that's not the word of God oh my oh God help us to surrender to that let's bow our heads together maybe Satan has presented some kind of knowledge to say that Christ is not the same yesterday today and forever maybe that kind of knowledge Has Come Today to you why don't you cast that down and just accept the knowledge of Christ the knowledge of Christ says I'm going to make it [Music] you don't think Satan tries to talk to me every time we have a Wednesday night service he says well you know it doesn't really matter doesn't matter what you say you don't people are just tired nothing nothing matters that's the knowledge of the world but the knowledge of God the knowledge of Christ speaks to us and said we're two or three are gathered together I am in their midst and if he's here tonight he's here to affect whatever his word says to bring it to pass to manifest you know our lives could we just accept that tonight Lord I cast down every reasoning every imagination every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God let the word be knowledge to my life may I conduct myself by the knowledge of the word Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray that you would move our thoughts Lord towards your word every moment oh God we want to understand we want to know Lord we we want your spirit to be so real in this place that spiritual gifts would come among us we want that but we want it to be right we want it to be right according to your word we cast down everything every knowledge every High thing every every Earthly Bond and we accept your word is true Lord govern us govern Our Lives by Your Word Lord that's the true thing that we know will make it will cause us to make it in the hour that we live in when there's so much deception oh God I pray Lord that we well you speak to us we would know that it's true not only by the confirmation of the spirit but by the word itself Lord may we have faith in that may we believe oh God that you're the same yesterday today and forever I pray you bless these people Lord if there's one sitting here tonight with a need myself Lord I I have needs tonight I pray God that you'd meet those needs we know that you're a prayer answering God I believe Lord that you're doing it right now you said even as the word went forth you healed them Lord may we accept our healing and move forward we pray and we accept
