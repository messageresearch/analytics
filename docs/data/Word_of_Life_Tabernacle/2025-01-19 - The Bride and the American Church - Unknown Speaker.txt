especially to you Lord we thank you for coming and being among us we ask these things in your precious name amen thank the Lord thank the Lord hallelujah good to be in the house of the Lord we're just always grateful when we can come together Revelation 18 and verse one good to have our visitors with us today it's just a little easier for us to have church over here on the highway I know it's difficult for you guys out there on in the sticks so we sure appreciate you being here and brother Jason allowing you to come Revelation 18 and verse one and then uh for those of ours that wouldn't weren't able to make it this morning this afternoon will be a youth focused service and so I hope you're able to make it this afternoon it won't be just for the Youth but it'll be focused on them I want to speak to our older Youth and uh talk about finding the right ones so I'm sure you'll all want to be hear that and and so uh I know our older youth need to hear that maybe our younger youth as well as we've got several of them coming up and the earlier you teach them the better the easier it is later on to say Hey you know you know what the truth is so we want to teach them these things uh Revelation 18:1 after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils the hold of every foul spirit and a CA a cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I appreciate brother Joel and brother Stuart holding the line for us last week and we're glad we got to give these young men opportunities and they really do a good job and even when it snows snow days are difficult because you got to decide whether to have church or not and the deacons uh do that and and uh with the input of the pastors we're so glad that we're have men that are able to do that and we were able to have church last week and this week and thankful for that I don't want youall to take any risk I uh would weigh heavily on me if somebody got hurt or something like that so y'all just be prudent in those things and so we understand if you can't get out or something like that it's good to be back with you I uh you know we were gone we're we're refreshed we're ready to uh start the year and and get rolling and uh just believe the Lord's going to be uh it's going to be a blessing to us this year and we can be a blessing as well to others on July 3rd 1964 while sitting at a shopping center in Jeffersonville brother Brandon was grieved in his heart at the immorality on display in his hometown he looked at the women and the way that they were and I think a lot of us would probably like to be transported back to 1964 and and see the way people dressed and things because it was a whole lot more decent than it is today a whole lot better than it is today but yet to brother Brandon being a prophet he saw what it was leading to and what it had become and he had lived over time uh a time when women were much more decent when men were much more decent he lived through that and he saw how it was going down he saw the spiritual implication of that he saw the way the church was it wasn't just the world but it was the church and he said while he was there he said I fell into a trance he said and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just a voice he said I looked and as I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for preview so he's standing there there's someone there with him he can't see him but there's another voice with him and it's like a review stand so it'd be like if the stand was here the people were coming from this way and passing by so he sees a group coming towards him he said I looked coming to me and I seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life he said but each one of them look like was dressed different they all had long hair they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women he said they look like kind of I'd say maybe 20 he said but when this bride she was looking the one was the one was talking to me and I were standing together her eyes he said she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more breast it wasn't just a dozen of them but a dozen wide he said there was just in a group of them and she passed by sweetly with a with a air and her eyes up watching as she passed by he said oh she was beautiful now what I want to do today I want to contrast the bride and the church specifically the American church and I want to take a look at that just kind of look very deeply at this vision and see if we can't see the difference in what makes the difference between the two he said as she passed by he said now we shall review he said that's the bride he said now we will review the churches he said and they come I noticed them coming up and when they come up each one look like got worse so he begins to see the churches he said I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life remember there was one group of bride yeah and then there were many groups of churches and he said next I heard a noise when he said next I heard a noise and it said next he said Here Comes the American group I want you to notice that the church or the the nominal church was separated by national identity right each one of them was separated by this is the American this is the German this is the African church but the bride was not separated all right by national identity even though they wore their own clothing yes right they wore the clothing but he talked like there would be a German next to a Swedish next to an American and they were all walking together I think we we could stop there for a while and preach but I think we need to recognize that the bride they weren't trying to trip one another they weren't trying to outdo one another or try to walk differently from one another but they walking in Step together because they were the bride and I think it identifies the bride when we begin to see people walk together we need to be careful that we don't get to looking so difficult at the difficulty in each other's lives look at the problems look at the situation we get to look into those things You Better Watch What Happens eventually you begin to realize that oh I wish I had that again but you destroyed Fellowship by picking up things and and tearing things apart we don't want to ever do that we we want to see Fellowship continue and if I've got to do more than my part to see Fellowship continue let me continue to do that let me forgive people let me love people let me take care of people do everything that I can because it's not about me it's about the lamb it's about the bridegroom and we are his bride we are his bride right so I don't want to pick people apart that are part of that bride are you with me he said well you don't know who is and who isn't I'll just go out on a limb and say this not every everybody in this church will be bride but I want everybody in this church to be bride and everybody here is under the preaching of the word youve got an opportunity come on church to be in that and I don't know who is and who isn't but there's the opportunity and I believe where the message of the hour is preached There's an opportunity where that voice is being heard there's an opportunity yeah are you with me now yeah that that we could be a part of that group and I don't want to do anything to tear that group apart yeah yeah we don't want to separate by national identity come on we don't want to separate by race right we don't want to separate by Church identity we don't want to separate by by well I listen to this preacher I listen to that one every one of us under a messenger yeah I may have a disagreement with another Pastor another preacher but I'm under a messenger and under my messenger I become you become the bride becomes the final voice to the final age when are we going to recognize that church and realize it's not about us and our little kingdoms that we're building but it's about Christ come on it's about the word it's about that let me do whatever good I can do for those in the bride huh so it's not just about us we can't be selfish with what we have all right right it's not about just about us we want to be a help to those who need help in our area Beyond area and Hospitality begins at home right we we want to be a help to everybody that we can but I'm not just saying that this morning I want us to really think about it and really understand that what we're doing why we do what we do why we press the way that we press and why we It won't always be perfect and people won't always respond in a good way there won't always be a reciprocal relationship where people respond the way we respond it doesn't matter we're doing what the bride does bride don't persecute right yeah come on now preach the said elect don't persecute elect right yeah are you with me now yeah I can take we can take it a little bit further see elect doesn't persecute anybody if you are a persecutor you find yourself on the wrong side of History if you're a person that loves to stir things up and persecute people and look down on them and criticize them you find yourself on the wrong side of History Jesus didn't do that we don't do that we got to preach the truth we got to tell the truth and many times that separates us from from the world and from even people that claim believe in the message we we want the truth preached across the pulpit but we do not want to treat people bad we are not here to to build ourselves up or to cut others down to put ourselves on a higher plane we're here to preach the gospel to help somebody and as long as I can do that here I'll do that right here but if I get an opportunity to do it on the street I'll do it on the street we want to help somebody yeah right I want to tell you maybe you don't understand everything about the message or you don't understand everything about what we believe but we want to help you we we want to make sure if you're bride we want to make sure you have an opportunity right to be in this bride group yes sir you're one of us and we don't know who is and who isn't because sometimes those who are bride look like they're not yeah those who are not bride look like they are are come on now but God makes the difference and the proof is in the pudding and in the end you find out who wasn't who was and he said don't separate the tears until the time of the end the church was separated I didn't mean to say all that but by National Group the bride was not but the BR said now I am an American but this made me sick he said I'm not eloquent enough in mixed audience to say what was taking place and you you'll have to read between the lines when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch and he said they had a a half inch strap on top I you talk about vulgar a a lacy like a skirt a lace paper on the bottom and nothing on the back you talk about vulgar basically the way when women dress in public now I don't mean you Godly sisters but just women in general you got to turn your head everywhere you go each one had hair cut up real short frizzy looking things all over like that real shortcut hair full of makeup he said absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the vulgarity he said now the paper was what they was holding in front of them when they passed the review stand he said in the back of them to see the way they were going on their foremost their back part how they were acting I said is that the church oh my cuz brother Brandon was thinking of you know himself as being an American having been one of the leaders of the church in America he was he was the Ley and church age messenger not just to us but to the church right he was the messenger whether they remember he said Elijah was Jezebel's Pastor whether she wanted him to be or not right so he he was the pastor to the age and he's walk watching this as they walk along as they go forward as they pass the review stand I want you to understand today we're passing review stand and a prophet's not the only one standing there come on yeah but the the the the lamb God himself was standing there the voice behind the voice when they passor review stand he said you see the way they were going on their foremost their back part how they were acting I said is that the church there she went they were singing this here twist and roll songs you know ever what you call going down singing that going by I said is that the church not all not all that's called Christian music is Christian music right and yet we we believe that uh we believe that the music that we and people say what kind of music do you play in your church God honoring music we want to keep it that way music that brings the presence of the Lord and we won't put artificial legalistic limits on what we play or what we sing yeah come on now right we'll sing what honors God what he's pleased with are you with me now right we don't sing twist and roll right rock and roll booly woly as brother B calls it or whatever that it is singing that and going by he said well excuse me this morning but brother Ben you got drums in the church you must sing Boogie wogie no we don't if we did David did come on now right and and you you you die overseas all right right it's the truth if you ever go to Africa you would die CU they have a beat they honor God with that and there's a difference in that in the beat of the world there is one right we don't listen to that we don't want our kids listen to it even if it's called Christian but we want it we want what's right yeah amen and and that's every one of us has individual responsibility to that yes but listen it's not the music and I've heard this preach that well it's the music that separates the bride from the church no it's not because you could have the wrong music can be bride and the right music can be the church right because you can be bride and be out of line yeah right are you with me now good now now again he he said I was standing there in my heart I was crying and this witch he said it's nothing in the world she is that World Council of churches leading them right straight down the road where she was going he said they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and then the other side and then like that carrying on like that walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again I want you to understand that the church had degenerated into this condition before God before the review standing brother Bram time look where they're at today and before the message came I've been in some of the Holiness groups that were there they were dying out the very few Holiness groups that survived were dying out and and and and unable to survive so they were constantly giving in the world giving into the world why are we different yeah come on now come on Church there had to be an Omega bride right he said the first bride was the alpha bride the a bride there had to be a z bride an end time bride amen he said I looked as they come again and they passed by sweet looking little ladies it was all looking right at me as they passed by remember it was a type because it's not going to be all women in the Rapture right ha to right so he's seeing he sing a type we know that uh you know you could someone said that there uh won't be any women in the first 30 minutes of heaven cuz the Bible said there'll be silence in heaven it's all right you can laugh for 30 minutes that's not Doctrine that's not true but can't believe that person said that he said they was all looking right at me these sweet ladies what were they of the Bride yeah are you with me now trying make you laugh I can't make you laugh I can't make you smile maybe I can make you cry here in a little bit he said I noticed each one was dressed differently and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watched them they weren't all the same but they were all in the same group come on are you with me now there was different churches different pastors different leader different situation maybe they had church a little bit differently but they were all part of the Bride yeah this American Church separated by denomination by Race by Nation but the bride didn't do that right yeah and it's about time we come to a place where we didn't do that anymore come on but we followed the sound of the voice of the age yes he said I watched them as they started leaving two or three of them in the back kind of get out of Step I was going to holler at them and they was trying to get back and step again and I've seen them just the vision just fade out and change from me I think if we saw the church the way God sees it yeah of course we would all want to be identified with that brid group how many can say Amen to that today I want to be part of that bride Group whatever it takes I don't want to be identified with the church with the modern Church am with the Babylonian church with mystery Babylon and her daughters I don't want to be identified with that it's why we maintain our separation we love them we we care for everyone we we should show a love for everybody but we will not become that yeah we don't want to be part of that why because we've been called out of that into something different oh church and if we saw the church the way God sees it it would not be an attractive thing but he said it was a vulgar thing he said I don't want to be a part of that I don't want to be identified with that and even even CED he said tears stopping in his heart because he could see that that group was going down he said God wouldn't marry somebody like that but but we want to be identified with the bridegroom now what does it take to be in the bride and I know people could preach all kinds of things say well the bride dresses a certain way and the bride listens to certain music and the bride does certain things and but those are results of being bride but you could be a part of that other church that other group and and do all those things right it's it's a it's it's what the difference between correlation and causation it's it's it didn't cause it wasn't you know the way you dress is not what makes you what you are amen right right you take a a sister that comes in and we've had some that come in and and come in from the world maybe they've always cut their hair and they quit cutting their hair but for a while it still looks cut but they're no less saved than anybody else right somebody coming off the street and you think well but but they're part of the Bride yeah they come they got maybe they had a hard life and done things they shouldn't have done with their bodies but yet yet they're part of the Bride just as wash and clean as anybody else is all right so you can't always look at the outside brother BR taught us you got to look at the Spirit he said I've seen a lot of women with long hair and long dresses and a long face to go with it and and in a place where you know you could be critical and or or or hateful or something like that you could be just as bad as somebody out there and so we don't want to be any of that we want to be loving and we realize we live in human bodies many times we make mistakes and and we do things that are wrong but we're thankful for the blood of Jesus because that's what makes us the bride is we've been washed by the bleeding word we've been washed by the blood yes sir right but a person might look like the church and be the bride yeah they just haven't seen the light yet come on and they might be bride that's gotten out of Step need to be called back because if that didn't happen we wouldn't need preachers that's right we wouldn't even need to listen to the message say well the message came and now we're all in the bride we're all okay no you still need the message yeah hear me this morning church I'm going to get to something after a while but you still need to hear the voice of a prophet you still need to hear and when you need to hear preachers that repeat that that tell you what a prophet said but you don't need to get away from the voice because the voice made a difference right made a difference in what we believe and what we live and Who We Are Made A Difference In Our Lives I'll tell you young people it'll make a difference in your life if you'll if you'll follow the voice of god good yes good the voice of God is not a company yeah it's not a it's not an organization it's not a church the voice of God is God himself the word are you with me now and he spoke through a prophet in our day that had the power of infallibility it was a mortal human man yall heard about it last week he spoke through a prophet but today he's speaking in and through the bride who were under their messenger the The Voice made a difference yeah so glad that it did yes because it gives me hope for tomorrow yeah good see I want to be I want to be very clear about this yeah you might say well I thank God for my pastor my pastor made a difference I'm glad you are thankful for your pastor but the pastor can only make a difference in your life in this age he can only preach you in he can only wash you by the water of the word as he is under the messenger sir right and the messenger could only do that as he was under the lamb the bridegroom the other voice that was speaking yeah are you with me now so it doesn't go back to difference in my life yeah is not do and and I met some good men and I know some good men there's some good men in this church and some good women wonderful people my mother's been a great influence in my life people in in the church have been a great influence in my life some of y'all ad meit more to me than what you even know amen but knowing you is not what made a difference in my life right right are you with me now you you you lived right and you shown the light and you were a billboard for God but that's not ultimately what made the difference what made you what you are for the best is the message of the hour it's the voice that God spoke the thing that God had to say I made a difference give me hope for tomorrow let me know that it's not we're not all going to hell in a hand basket forgive the language we're not all doing that but we're we're going to heaven we're going somewhere there's a city prepared for us there's a place we're going to it's What made a difference in my life and I want to give a testimony today that the voice made it what about you Church made a difference in our lives sir that's why I refuse to draw denominational lines and church lines and everything else it's this message that made the difference and whatever I can do to promote this message I'll do it yes amen I set in fellowship with great men in this message but they are not what made the difference every one of the greatest of them would tell you I I told Brother I was s with brother Tim fr the other day great man of God but I was sitting there with him and I told him I said this message is my life he told me he said this message is my life too yeah and we may have disagreements about things but this message is our life huh whether we're big or little or right whether we're skinny or fat or Joel's laughing how me the size of the church man no matter what we are the message made a difference I I just feel relaxed this morning able to preach my voice is Le me because I haven't preached in a while but but you know I I think about that but Justin why do you come to church because of the message you don't just come because of me but you believe what a prophet said yeah so you drive three hours to come to church come on Church you don't do it you'd do it if I wasn't here yeah yeah are you with me now I want to help you do it I want to be part of it but we got to get past personality we got to get past who's preaching we got to get past those things say Lord I believe I heard a voice calling me out of Babylon calling me away from the nonsense of the world calling me away from denominationalism and that voice called me by the message of the hour yes sir what is the bride the idea of a gentile Church being the wife of the Bride of the wife of Christ first introduced by Paul in Ephesians 5 we'll get to more of that maybe later today but Ephesians 5:23 the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body yeah so Paul introduces the idea of Christ having a bride and John expands on this idea in Revelation where he said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready the wife the bride the one who belongs to him and with him yes Revelation 21 And1 he said I saw a new Heaven in A New Earth the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea been thinking about heaven lately I'm not that old but we we on vacation we went we walked up a lighthouse we went to Florida but not to the warm part the cheap part but we went up this Lighthouse and it said 177 steps does that sound like a lot to you all I sister Curtis is nodding yes 177 steps when it's straight up it's a lot and I found myself almost unable the only thing that kept me going up them steps was my pride that was it everything else I was out of breath my heart was beating out of my chest and let me tell you it was harder to come down than it was to go up because it was so it was so steep that I was going down like this whenever I walk down my back would hurt and I I I was down for a day or two I'm just telling you the truth and so I get down and I had to go to the the SUV and I felt like I was having a heart attack and I wasn't but I felt like that my heart's beating out of my chest my face is red my blood pressure's up and I sit down in the car and we start to leave and the kids are like kind of chuckling at me you know I said kids you wouldn't think this was funny if I died Church wouldn't think it was funny if I died and Joel was in charge and and I left and but you know I'm sitting there and and uh and I told my kiss said this it's not funny you know I you know you want people to to feel bad for you and of course they weren't huffing and puffing but they're underweight so anyway they they we we were driving along and my kids start preaching at me they said brother Ben brother Ben my my daughter called me Pastor Ben Pastor Ben she says she says I you know if we die we're going to heaven and and Peter's like yeah we're going to heaven we're you know you're going to you're going to make it said what are you worried about I shouldn't have told him about that life [Applause] insurance that's what they did they're like wait you know you really have to you really have to uh and they were talking me up out I said you know what you're right you're right I can't deny that and I've been thinking even before that about heaven and think about we're going somewhere that's real going somewhere beyond this land Beyond this place beyond this Veil somewhere where there's a reality to it and I'm looking forward to it I'm only 39 years old but I'm looking forward to that land looking forward to being in that City and so the bride listen to me is everyone who was predestined by God to live in that City GL to God we don't know when when we'll go but we'll go and we'll go at least to the sixth Dimension and then eventually find ourselves in that City we don't have a promise of tomorrow right while we were on vacation I fell in the pool nearly drowned in four feet of water one of the I think the only time in my life that I've ever thought I was dying I wasn't but I thought I was cuz I don't swim and but as I'm pushing up from the bottom it was more than four feet I was pushing up from the bottom grasping for air thought well this is it you know but I thought about what my kids said I said well I'm going home you know going home you don't know when something stupid might happen somebody pulls out in front of you I don't want to make you scared but we shouldn't be scared we are those people of all people who shouldn't be scared of Tomorrow it ought to be the bride you say well the political system's going down but the bride's looking up the the the my life and I'm I'm I'm sick and maybe you're getting older and you say well I I'm I'm going through some things but look up your Redemption draws nine the worse the world gets the better the bride gets the higher she goes we're going to are you with me this morning we're going to a city right yes sir it's good Wonder Hallelujah now that y'all feel sorry for me let's continue Revelation 21 I saw a new Heaven in new Earth I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God thank you Lord hallelujah God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes thank you there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away Hallelujah and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful he said unto me it is done I love that it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and the murderers and hor mongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in a lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death and there cometh to be one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plags talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife what did he show them he showed them that City he showed him that City listen the bride are all of those who were chosen by God before the foundation of the earth to live in that City yes sir right can't nobody take you out of that group on because the to cut you out of the Bride out of the Bride would be to cut you out of the mind of God that's right amen and nobody can do that you don't church we can't affect God's thinking cuz he knows all things he always knew all things good he showed him our future home brother brandom speaks of that he said oh what will it look like did you ever think now bride what will it look like let's think about that for a minute he said it's prepared and designed by the Divine architect the the Divine architect you know that was that famous architect his his name is slipping my mind right now but he was the one who built waterfall the different houses that had the that were integrated into nature somebody knows his name but I can't think of it but it's the it's the uh the guy who who built his homes were so beautiful but and they're relics today they're built I think in the 60s and 70s but that Frank Lloyd Wright and they built his homes and they were so beautiful and the architect he was so celebrated as an architect but you know they got problems there's mold in them houses yeah because he integrated them with nature right and nature means Nature's problems and so rain gets in them water gets in them there's mold in them so the most beautiful houses in the world are also some of the least functional oh yeah but this city yeah was not Hallelujah was not designed by an architect with human failings because even the greatest architect in the world has human failing right if you've ever built a house you know when you get to the end of it there'll be something you don't like about it even though you may have designed it but there's something about it that you don't like because there just something that you weren't able to do because of finances or maybe maybe you wanted this here and the the Builder made it a little different or didn't come out of the vision like you expected it to but imagine if you had all the money that there was and you had all the time that there was and you had all the uh the knowledge that there was what kind of a house for the Joe would you build for your wife what kind of a house would you build oh church for you to live in with your wife and for you to have a home what kind of a place would it be yeah if you had everything at your disposal yes come on church and the Divine architect had all things at his disposal yes and what did he do he prepared a place right he said I go to prepare a place he has designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride what's it going to look like he said could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's abble that Abel's there I'm still waiting to build my wife a house but could you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch have you ever been I I'm just preaching freely this morning y'all just bear with me come off vacation relaxed but we were up at the Laura Engles Wilder house a few years ago up at Mansville Missouri if you go in her home she was really short and I guess he was short too and he was a custom builder and so they built everything like like it's for midgets so all the counters are low and the furniture is low it's all custom built he built it all for her like was built for children you're in a house but it's like a kid's house don't I know what you're thinking after after church tell Brother David what you were thinking and and so they she they built it all just for her and I thought about that I thought that's what he did for us yeah individually sir right because I may not like what you like but he built it Hallelujah for me just for me I don't know what Riley's will have in it you know Riley's house you know it might be a beautiful home with deer antlers and bare skin rugs and yours might be different from that there might be different kinds of houses you know one with a big kitchen one with no K I don't know but in that City he designed that entire city amen hallelujah where there's a personal spot yeah all right just for you Hallelujah we've all got places that we like to go we've got things that we like to see things we like to do we like to find that spot you know that's special to us maybe in the woods maybe driving along the road and there's a certain spot that just beautiful you wish you could live there you wish that things could you know you could just capture that moment in time but he has done that for you and he put a spot right there for you now Oh my he said exactly to her touch just what she would like how the Divine architect has designed the new city where he will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the Apostle said eyes is not seen Ear Has Not Heard neither has ever entered the heart of man the Divine architect has designed this for his beloved don't let nobody tell you you're not loved by God I don't care what you've been through what your past has been what your what what what things maybe responsibilities you didn't keep but remember right now is a new day it's a new time press toward those things that are that are ahead look reject those things that are behind forget those things huh it's good there a house place a body yeah for you right said oh what a place it must be when divine nature a Divine architect has designed it for a Divine attribute if you're the bride there's something in you that was in God's mind before the foundation of the earth that's what a Prophet come to tell us listen he come to tell the Earth the world how awful things were he come to tell the church listen how bad things were but that's not what he come to tell the bride he come to tell the bride you've been washed you've been Sanctified you've been cleansed by the blood of the lamb and you were in the mind of God before oh I'm so thankful that the message of the hour told me that if you're in that bride you've been called to that City away from Babylon to this other City the New Jerusalem Hallelujah he said what a place it must be divine architect designed for divine at there's something in you that's Divine something in you that was in God's mind don't let Satan put that out or try to I tell you you got to take your own life or TR to get you depressed and down disappointed yeah we all get depressed sometimes but you need to shake that off yeah because there's something inside of you that's Eternal something inside of you that matters you young people there's something inside of you that belongs to God don't let the devil tell you you're worth it you might as well throw your life away might as well give it to drugs and alcohol and and sex and all these things no there's something that God wants from you something in your heart that belongs to [Music] [Applause] him wonderful you can go out there and I know this preacher may not mean a lot to everybody and you can go out there and you can you can you can paint up and and and wear your clothes and do those things and act like the world all you want to but there'll be an emptiness there if you were come from God you got to go back to God there's an emptiness there just you the more you do the more you need to do and the more you have the more you want you may try to fill it with riches and try to fill it with wealth try to fill it with with money try to fill it with greed whatever it is but you're never going to be able to fill that hole because you belong to God from the beginning right good good yes sir what is the American church we know what the bride is it so with the divine nature Divine attribute divinely predestinated by a Divine God who's the author of Divine Life Word Church means called out the American churches all those who claim to be the wife of Christ but like Israel claim to be his wife yet continually flirted with idolatry the church does what she wants not what he commands Bible tells Isaiah 4:1 in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat on a bread and wear on apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach yeah the brandom sees that as a prophecy of the immorality of our day the same thing he was grieved by when he saw the vision and how he saw it as a type of the church it's a lean Church in Revelation 3:14 the angel of the Church of the leans right these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou are neither cold nor hot I would that thou W cold or hot so then because th are luk warm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich and increased with Goods have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thy that thou mayest see listen we were all a part of that church right we were all a part of that ly age brother the Paul but a voice come by our way a voice amen hallelujah reach the jungles of Africa reach out to brother Paul in his testimony how a voice something called us out why are you where you are today why do you believe what you believe today cuz something called you out an angel come and lighten the Earth and then you heard a voice from Heaven come out of her my people sir good brother brandom sees that church especially the American group he feels sick inside he said I stood there in his presence I thought oh God is a minister that's the best we could do oh he said you know how how you feel I thought God hide me if I could just get away from here if all that we've done that's what we have to produce if that's what he said then when them women pass by all doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair painted faces as they pass by like that supposed to be virgins to Christ when she passed by like that I turned my head you know with this holding in front of me it was disgraceful the back of them and there they was going like that and I turned my head to weeping like that I said I couldn't stand it in there him standing there and me no oh my a minister of the church and that's what I had produced for him his boss was standing looking over his shoulder he said here's the church I said oh God I can't look at it let me die let me fade away as soon as it went out every time one of them would come they go out to a certain place and then drop off just hear the sound of it as it went away where he was sitting on the review stand as they were passing by he said in one place he said they went up a little null little Hill and then dropped off the other side they thought they were going up yeah but a prophet could see they were going down right but this is not the end of the story I'm so glad it's not there had to be an Omega bride he said then I heard something like hward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down on their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word they looked like one out of every nation I was looking at as they passed by and seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up and noticed one of them trying he said two or three of them trying getting out of line he said in several places he said they were trying to get back in line but they were watching that other group yes be careful getting your eyes on politics be careful getting your eyes on what's going on in the world on your neighbors on even neighboring churches keep your eyes on the word keep your eyes on the message right he said I noticed two or three of them trying to get out of line I screamed stay inine line the vision left me I was standing in the room screaming stay in line listen if you go back to Isaiah chapter 4 Isaiah 4:1 is the one we read a lot of times where he talks about how that seven women would take a hold of one man but in Isaiah 4:2 it says in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious when in the same day the seven women take hold of one man and say I want your name but I don't want you to affect my life in that same day there will be a branch of the Lord that'll be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be Called holy even everyone that is written among the living in Jerusalem when oh I want to be among the living don't you everyone's written among the living when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have Purge the blood of Jerusalem from the midst by the spirit of judgment by the spirit of burning said of the B how are you tying that together a prophet did go listen to Future home he takes that scripture and says that's the bride yeah glory to God that's our future home look at the contrast the church like Israel during the Old Testament could be put away not so the bride yeah the bride's relationship with him is not transactional it's unconditional sir sir it's not if you are so good on you can be part of it I know it's hard on people because you say well how you keep people right living right well they're the bride they will and you'll warn them and cry and say get back in line they'll get out of line sometimes but the bride will'll be something in them the response to the word listen we've not come to a legalistic mountain come on we've come to a mountain of Grace The Headstone come with gr Grace Grace unto it Hebrews 12 and 18 said you're not coming to the mountain that might be touched and burned with fire nor into Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they heard they that heard and treated the word should not be spoken to them anymore oh but we love the voice that we heard why it was the voice of Grace oh Church listen they they could not endure that which was commanded if so much as a beast touched the mountain they should be stoned or thrust through of the dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but you are coming to Mount Zion how many have come to Mount Zion today you come to mount un to the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem to an innumerable company of angels glory to God more with us than be with him as the prophet said to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to God the judge of all to the spirits of just men made perfect to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than Abel oh my the bride is those who in the mind of God never did it in the first place yeah so he sends his word his Redemption to wash them brother BR tell us the word bled for you I don't have time to get into all of it this morning but you know the quot the word bled for you the word died for you yeah right what was it is the word manifested in a body of Flesh that hung on Calvary the bride was Washed by the word and Ephesians 5:25 said husbands love your your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should it be holy without blemish how does he wash it by the word how do you know which group you belong in come on now think about it for a minute how do you know yeah CU you might have lived over here with that American church group and live like they do it's real quiet but I think you're listening you might have live like that for a long time but you got something in your heart it's calling you to a different life come on yes how do you know that you belong over here yeah where the table spread yeah the Feast of the Lord is how do you know you belong in that City listen what Jesus said in John 17:6 he said I have manifested name un to the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word amen listen to what Jesus tells Peter Peter may not have felt like he was part of the elect cuz he made so many mistakes on now you may not have felt like you're part of the elect but this is what Jesus tells him he says when you're converted not if you're converted amen hallelujah he said the devil would like to take you and sift you like wheat but when you're converted go strengthen your brethren oh that's the kind of faith we ought to have whatever God gave to him he will not lose them he said thou gavest them me they have kept Thy word he said now they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are of thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I come out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me this was the difference look at the Vision the American church and all the churches of the world were behaving according to the voice that come from Babylon the voice of attraction to Babylon the voice of Hollywood the voice of the of the world that we live in today that's how they were behaving listen church but the bride yeah Hallelujah they had their eyes on the messenger and the and the one who was standing behind him what did they hear they heard a different voice the American Church their dress their attitude their music all of it result of being led by the World Council of churches led by men and man's ideas the bride had no visible leader did you notice that what but the leader was standing here by hallelujah amen so there was a prophet who was a leader but he was removed from that group why he had he passed away he says maybe this will be after I'm gone yeah right so he's removed from that group and here comes the bride by and there seems to be no visible leader men might try to make themselves a leader but the leader is the word and each one of them are watching the message yeah to God they're watching for Hallelujah watching the voice of the messenger what are they watching listening for it as they go by this other group didn't listen for it they didn't watch what they just went on but this group's watching him he said their eyes were on me they were watching me and here they were watching as they went by but he said a few of them got to look at at that other group and they fell out of Step you know how you will if you're walking in a certain beat and there's another beat yeah right if you get focused on the beat you're in you can kind of you musicians know what I'm talking about maybe the drummer's playing some his own you know pick on the drummer cuz he's my boy but he does a good job but maybe he's playing in his own world you know you're sitting over there and if you PR you'll be following him you know some of Y all the way you clap you know I'm just messing with you but you know when we clap it pretty soon you get to watch another person clap and then what were they doing watching that other group yes Joe we don't need to do that yeah we don't need to get like bam looking at the hinder parts and things watching the mixed multitude say well this one did this and this one did wrong you better be careful you get become a cynic get a critical spirit on you that's got to be washed off on by the water of the word now look at that look at the message yes look at what's being preached yeah what's being preached that's what we're coming to the people aren't always going to be doing exactly what's being preached but it's not the message's fault right come on don't look at the people look at the word look but he said what they didn't realize is there was a there was a brass serpent in the camp the shadow of the king yeah there was stuff going on but don't look at that look at the lamb who's standing the messenger standing there got a message from the lamb messenger told you he said don't look at me look at him amen good look there were two with two distinct voices watching the bride preview the voice of a prophet the voice of Elohim Revelation 18 that we already read after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and he Earth was lightened with his glory he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest fallen and become the habitation of devils the hold of every foul Spirit the cage of every unclean hateful bird brother penom taught that was his ministry he said come out of her God sent a mighty angel or messenger and his light wasn't in a corner it scattered over the Earth come out of her what her and her sisters too to lighten the Earth and call these people out of her he said now you know that's the truth the messenger was sent from heaven to call God's people out of Babylon and his light like of the Earth the great Holy Spirit he said notice this is the angel of Light remember the last Angel it's the angel in the church age of Lea it's the Lea messenger that's the last because the very next chapter is the 19th Chapter which say the coming bride yeah and this in the scripture the last angel that came to bring light before the coming of the Bride to go meet Christ was the Le to see in church age he said what was the Le to see in church age messenger calling them out of Babylon he said look churches caught in her cage with her with their dogmas denying the word and accepting dogmas again he said notice this is the last messenger for the coming of Christ in the 19th Chapter of Revelation the messenger's voice he said if we notice when he gave his voice on the earth there was a voice echoed again in heaven he said the fourth verse the 19th Chapter the messenger on the Earth was so inclined with God until when he spoke it on the earth God echoed the same thing out of Heaven what is that fourth first translation what does it mean it's God's voice speaking to his predestinated people what is it you saw past the flesh you saw past a man with w w with fults and failures and you saw there was a voice there that was eternal that spoke to your heart yeah you heard the voice of predestination yeah he said God's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying come out of her just exactly what the voice was he's got people all out there all throughout through Babylon come out of her you be not partakers of her sins yes sir how of that dogas increas to the word made spirit in life notice the 19th Chapter is the next he said after these things did you notice here in the 19th Chapter after these things watch what after what after the message have come out of her after these things oh I love this after these things well we all just sit and wait in our scared little corners and hope nobody notices that we're message people come on now huh it's not what he said after these things what things come out of her my people is the shout all right of the Bride Saints yeah Hallelujah yeah what do he say this is King lamb worship time if there ever was a time of worship it ought to be right now where we're living there was never people could worship Him it ought to be those of us who know his presence who recognize where he is that he's here yes this is the shout going to the marriage of the Lamb how close are we then brother what's the last call come out of Babylon come out of Babylon amen that's the call still going out come out of Babylon after these things he said I heard a great voice of much people in heaven say hallelujah salvation glory honor and power unto the Lord Our God we're living in that time of worship yes and is in an hour when look how Satan's co-opted that the modern worship movement because he wants people to experience the worship without knowing who they're worshiping come on brother BR said they end up worshiping the devil come on it's what he said not knowing it yeah right but we oh Church what are we worshiping it's not the worship that's wrong it's what it's to to the Creeds and the dogmas but our worship is not to that our worship is to the lamb he said is King lamb worship time the bride who's called out now hears the same voice oh can you still hear it Church you heard it one day calling you out of babyon calling you out of the world can you hear it this morning can you can you listen for it as the voice of the world drowned it out or can you still hear the voice of a messenger echoing a voice from Heaven it says come on out come into the city there's a place for you can you hear the voice can you hear the voice of many Waters the bride becoming her the final voice under her messenger calling her away from the influence of the modern Church calling her back to the message of the hour Revelation 3:18 he said I counsel you to buy me gold tried in the fire verse 19 as many as I love I rebuke and chase him be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice open the door I will come into to him what's up with him he with me we preached about that what was he doing want a conversation yeah let's sit down and have a conversation only those who hear the voice of election will hear the voice outside their door yes yes I I'm here this morning because I just don't belong in the American Church good I Heard a Voice you might struggle it might be difficult sometimes to find a job or to do what's right right you struggle and you think what's the use you struggle to do the right thing sometimes and your whole flesh just sticky all the time can you listen to The Voice have you heard it there's hope for you brother Brandon said you notice a bride comeing you twice first seed and second seed both of them exactly the same one the reason they were dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations so make up the bride each one had long hair no makeup really pretty girls they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all Nations he say she each one represented a nation as they marched perfectly in line yes with the word you realize when he saw that Vision there wasn't a bride in every nation come on now but now in 2025 we've gone to a few places where there's few but there's somebody we went to Egypt was the first ones to preach to many of them people that were there that don't make us anything big but what we were doing preaching the message people had never heard it before but there's people in Egypt believe the message in spite of persecution people I've just heard I've been communicating with a brother in Nepal at the foot of Mount Everest he said there's four churches here we've not had any American Brothers come we're just sitting here waiting and and and and he said but the churches are growing people are seeing the message what is it there's got to be a bride in every nation you didn't know it you know you give and sometimes you don't know where it goes to but your missions offering that you give we put that in a special place and I wait and watch for an opportunity and we paid the rent on one of their churches last month trying to help them out because I believe that there's got to be a bride in every nation there's got to be a place in Egypt a place in Nepal and Africa all parts of the world what is it he said then I have to watch her he said she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by oh my maybe it'll be my time when I'm over when I'm finished Whatever It Is Well he said they was getting back trying their best that's the bride was getting back just get in line cuz they was looking out somewhere else watching about that churches TN on the cha listen the bride's not a lazy bride they're not somebody just lays out in sin and Corruption but they're trying their best to get back get back in line with what the word says a man ought to be what the word says a woman ought to be amen people ought to be watching about that church that just went out into chaos the front one's never the back ones just two or three of them kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side looked like was trying to get back in line as they went by Hallelujah you might have lots of problems you might have a horrible past you might have been caught watching that other group influenced by music and dress and all the nonsense of the world Hollywood Showmanship but you're not one of them to go back you're the bride yeah you come from the mind of God because the voice calls you back and you've been washed by it you got to be washed to live in that City that's why but that's why I Don't Preach Doom and Gloom yeah come on I Don't Preach we're the only ones who have it right in the message come on now cuzz that's nonsense how am I going to produce a bride out of my Ministry in every nation I can't do it it wasn't up to me but there's a hundred other pastors like me a thousand maybe maybe 10,000 I don't know but they're out there preaching the word the best of their yeah they make mistakes yeah sometimes I get involved in things they shouldn't get involved in but there's still preaching a word going out that when the bride hears it they it'll be Washed by the Water of the word I am not discouraged by the state of the message come on I'm not discour you can point to me all the wrong things that have been done and all the things that have happened and I'll say there's been lots of bad things happened to the Baptist too but the Baptists aren't going up they're going down are you with me now there will be some saved out of tribulation but that's not what we're a part of we're a part of the those who are going up into heaven right you can show me all the bad things you want to show me I'm not I'm not an ostrich I'm not sticking my head in the sand but I tell you what I'm looking at a promise I'm looking at what God Said God said we can take the land and we will take the land come on church we ought to be we ought to be excited to be a part of the Bride of the last day we've heard a voice come out of her my people be not partaker of her plagues yes listen to this you take this you young people take this people say we have to do this to be saved you got to do this you got to jump like this and church has got to approve you or some Pastor that's not what he said he said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and brother brand takes that he said it's understand is my word yes you got to understand enough to believe and be baptized be filled with the Holy Ghost yes right I don't mean you understand every mystery but there's something in you that makes it clear it's Revelation the new birth is a revelation he that heareth my word believeth on him that sent me hath haath past tense you don't have to keep getting resaved ha everlasting life and shall not Hallelujah shall not the devil mess with your mind say well I'm part of that you're part of this other group no he that heareth my words believeth on him as in me have everlasting life shall not come in that other group shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death To Life brother B always quotes this scripture John 637 all someone say all all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out he couldn't even cast you out if he wanted to and he doesn't want to but he couldn't cast you out because how could he be yeah oh come on Church how could he be a true husband a true groom with the stain oh my of a divorce from a bride he wouldn't listen to him so he had to put her away he would not do it even the Jews he comes and takes a Remnant blinds them for our sake he will not be a husband who lost his wife he will church but he redeems her he pays the price 100% on his part I'm going to have a bride [Music] hallelujah hallelujah and the proof of who we are is our response to that voice what you look down with the chicken pen I'm closing musicians go ahead and come you look down in the chicken pen and you see a a barnyard full of birds full of birds they're all birds you got different kinds of chickens different denominations full of birds but there was one who was an eagle he was born an eagle he's always been an eagle he doesn't know he's an eagle because he's never met an eagle but they're all in that one group they're all headed for the slaughterhouse to become Fried Chicken ghost chickens in the [Laughter] sky they're all headed for Colonel Sanders just trying to lighten you up all headed for church for the tribulation period sir now we think seriously now they're all headed towards that that's right but down amongst this group good and bad and indifferent is a bird that's eating chicken food acting like a chicken ping the ground like a chicken trying to cluck like a chicken but he's different he's always been different something about him's different what makes a difference he don't know that he's different until one day oh church one day his mama knew she laid another egg and so she goes looking for him and she calls out she look down there and she can see what he can't see amongst all that bunch of chickens there's an eagle he's brown at this stage like the other chickens he hasn't gotten his white his white oh church he he hasn't got maybe there's a chicken maybe some of your some of your kids you look up so well they're just a bunch of chickens but the eagle looks kind of like a chicken when he's young but as he gets older the difference begins to materialize and they look like a chicken but but and this little boy this little chicken probably thought he was a chicken but one day she come across she saw that he was there and she screamed she screamed when she screamed he heard it and he said I recognize that voice he still look like a chicken act like said Mama what must I do she said just chop up on the post he said well I got up here what did I do spread your wings she had to be taught by the word the eagle had to be taught to be an eagle to fly like a Eagle but it was always an eagle in the mind of the mama eagle and Christ had in his mind a bride which one is the eagle which are the chickens scream and you'll know preach the word and you begin to see the Eagles line up to it Hallelujah he had his mind a bride who choose to follow his voice he chose that bride and prepared a place for her as I talked about my children and they reminded me this is not the end one day it will be but the word reminds us that death is no big deal it's taking us out of this old pest house into his father's he said my father's house a completely different picture a completely different I hope I haven't bored you this morning but don't you love him aren't you glad you heard a scream come out from among the chicken maybe you're not all the way what you ought to be but you heard a voice there's a reason for that keep climbing keep moving keep trying to get back back in line we'll keep preaching it we'll keep spread promoting the message we'll keep pointing to pointing to the voice behind the voice not pointing to ourselves but poin to what God did in our day because that's what's going to wash us is the message of the hour don't you bow your heads with me this morning maybe the devil's tried to tell you you're you're not good enough and you'll never make it just let the word walk was you of that this morning you may be an eagle in a chicken bin but you're an eagle say come out from among Babylon babylon's a way of thinking a way of [Music] doing you can brother Rand told of you said you can go to church where you're going to church he said but come out come out of that mindset here the word screaming out maybe the devil trying to tell you you're not good enough you can't do it you don't fit in but you're just maybe you got a little brown on you yet maybe you're still young but you got a future your future is not in the barnyard it's not among the dust and the dirt but it's in the skies just let him speak to you this
