[41:31] people worship him. He created you
[41:34] because he wanted to be worshiped.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; And I think that's the least we can do

[44:58] this morning. God bless you. Would you
[45:00] glad to be in the house of the Lord? If
[45:02] you can be seated for just a moment. I
[45:05] brother Harvey has a testimony want to
[45:07] give this morning and we're going to
[45:09] take time for him to do that. It's just
[45:11] a wonderful testimony of God's healing
[45:12] power. I know we got about a dozen
[45:15] testimonies or so from the meetings that
[45:18] were just amazing. And uh I want to
[45:21] thank you for sharing those with us. My
[45:23] goodness. Uh it just God just moved in
[45:26] miraculous ways. So as brother Harvey
[45:27] comes, we have him do that uh this
[45:30] morning. And uh and also I wanted to say
[45:34] to you young people, if you haven't
[45:35] signed up yet for the youth banquet, we
[45:37] got several coming from out of town. And
[45:40] so it's going to be a good time on the
[45:41] 16th of August. Um and uh we're going to
[45:45] have a good time there at the banquet
[45:47] here at the fellowship hall. So if you
[45:49] could come and and be a part of that. I
[45:51] know most of ours have signed up, but if
[45:53] you haven't signed up yet and you want
[45:54] to come to the youth banquet, you're
[45:56] welcome to do that. God bless you,
[45:57] brother Harvey.
[46:08] Amen. How many love the Lord this
[46:10] morning?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Man, I'm just rejoicing with y'all for
[46:13] what the Lord has done for us. And I
[46:16] just had a testimony. It's kind of
[46:17] burning. So, I thought I would go ahead
[46:19] and try to give it. I'll try not to take
[46:20] too much of brother Ben's time.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Uh about 12, 13 years ago, I was given
[46:26] some medicine that caused my uh joints
[46:29] to go out, caused them to be bad, and I
[46:32] had both my hips replaced. And the
[46:34] doctor told me at that time, he said,
[46:36] "Sunny, your shoulders are gone, too."
[46:39] He said, "Your your shoulder is in bad a
[46:41] shape as your hips was." So, I recovered
[46:44] from the surgeries from the hips and I
[46:47] had prayer for my shoulder. This my
[46:49] right shoulder was the worst one. And
[46:51] the Lord healed it. He just miraculously
[46:53] I had no trouble with it. I never went
[46:56] back and had any test or anything, but I
[46:58] was able to use it miraculously. But
[47:00] about three months ago, I uh injured
[47:03] myself, injured my left shoulder, and uh
[47:07] I tried everything I could to to make it
[47:09] work, and I just couldn't make it work.
[47:10] I tried physical therapy, and it just
[47:12] didn't respond. And then I fell on it,
[47:14] took a really hard fall on it, and it uh
[47:18] it went south from there. So, I decided
[47:21] I was going to have to have something
[47:22] done. So, I went to the doctor and he
[47:25] told me, he said, "Son, you got a a to
[47:29] rotor cup." He said, "I don't know how
[47:30] bad it is." He said, "I talked to
[47:32] brother Bill and I know he had went
[47:34] through that surgery." He said, "We
[47:37] might can fix it with a scope." He said,
[47:38] "We might have to go in there, but he
[47:40] said, "I'm sure that's what your problem
[47:41] is." So, we uh I got to looking and I
[47:45] looked at some pictures of what a toer
[47:47] cup looked like. And by the time I went
[47:49] to see the doctor, I pretty well knew
[47:50] what I was what he was talking about.
[47:54] So, we got in there. Sister Rebecca was
[47:56] in the hospital the day I went and had
[47:58] some tests done. this you I was in pain
[48:01] that day a lot of pain but I just
[48:04] couldn't do anything with it and it
[48:05] really hindered me because I couldn't do
[48:07] my couldn't do my job I didn't feel like
[48:09] I took care of you people I was really
[48:11] during the meetings I was like a
[48:13] one-armed person and it wasn't wasn't
[48:15] very much and I really felt bad about
[48:17] that and and so in the prayer line
[48:21] Saturday night uh I come through the
[48:23] prayer line and my thought was Lord
[48:25] however you want to do this if it's a
[48:27] big tear you can fix that. If it's a
[48:29] little one, well, that'd be good, too.
[48:31] Or just whatever your wheel is. And I
[48:33] told Brother Daryl when we started the
[48:34] line, he was at the front and I said,
[48:35] "Brother Daryl, the doctor says, I've
[48:38] got a tore rotor cup." And he stopped.
[48:40] He said, "Well, let me tell you
[48:42] something." He said, "I just got a
[48:43] report from a sister that the Lord
[48:44] healed of that."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Well, praise the Lord." You
[48:48] know, and I wasn't asking for a miracle
[48:50] or anything. I went through the line and
[48:52] uh the next morning I got up and Monday,
[48:54] Monday morning I had an MRI at 7:00 at
[48:58] Mountain Home. So I got up and I had
[49:01] half the pain was 50% was gone and I was
[49:06] just I was just amazed, you know, all
[49:08] the way over there. And I went and done
[49:09] that MRI. Immediately went to the doctor
[49:12] and they put me in a little room and
[49:14] they, you know how they do with the
[49:16] technology, they put the X-rays and then
[49:18] the MRI, they put it on the screen where
[49:20] you can see it.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; And that was I was in there 10, 15
[49:23] minutes before the doctor come in. And I
[49:25] looked at that joint. I couldn't see
[49:27] nothing.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; I knew what a tour cup looked like
[49:30] because I'd been looking at them, you
[49:32] know, and I couldn't find a thing. He
[49:35] come in and he looked over it and he
[49:37] said,
[49:38] Well, Harvey, he said, "I don't find
[49:41] anything to fix." He said, "Let me uh"
[49:44] said, "Let me see what they said about
[49:45] it over at the hospital." So, he reads
[49:47] all that. He looked at me and he said,
[49:49] "There's just nothing here to fix." He
[49:51] said, in fact, he said, "That joint," he
[49:55] said, "that joint looks better than most
[49:57] of the men at your age come in here that
[49:59] has a a joint." He said, "That joint
[50:02] looks better than most joints I've
[50:03] seen."
[50:05] He said,
[50:07] he said, "Connie protocol." He said, "We
[50:09] can give you a shot in that shoulder."
[50:11] He said, "It ain't going to do you no
[50:12] good because he said there's nothing
[50:14] wrong with it." I said, "Whatever you
[50:15] think you need to do, doctor." And I
[50:18] just I just want I throw that in because
[50:20] I want to say something here. Anyway, I
[50:23] come out of there and ever since then,
[50:26] I've been able to use that hand. I can
[50:27] do anything I want to with it. Perfect
[50:29] range of motion.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; And I just I hated it so bad. It's just
[50:34] lots of times you need more than one
[50:35] hand to praise the Lord. We come into a
[50:37] lot of those situations during the
[50:39] meetings and I just felt so bummed
[50:41] because I couldn't do what I wanted to
[50:42] do. But uh he he give me that shot and I
[50:47] witnessed to people after that and I had
[50:51] some to say you know they didn't mean it
[50:53] bad but I'd tell them my testimony and
[50:56] then the first thing they would ask well
[50:58] how long's that shot post supposed to
[50:59] last?
[51:01] And I thought, you know, devil, that's
[51:04] just like the devil. But the Lord done
[51:06] pulled one over on him because I had
[51:07] done seen what my shoulder looked like.
[51:09] I done seen the complete healed joint.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; So the devil had he had no power with
[51:14] that at all. And I just want to thank
[51:16] him this morning for what he done for
[51:17] us. There's been a lot of requests or a
[51:20] lot of testimonies that come through
[51:21] that prayer line, but I believe the Lord
[51:23] was here and I believe that he's
[51:24] confirmed what he said he would do. And
[51:26] I'm thankful for the recipant of that
[51:28] this morning. Thank you. Amen.
[51:36] You believe God the healer.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; How many believe that this morning?
[51:39] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning, he's
[51:41] able to meet our need this morning.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; He can heal you anywhere. But there was
[51:45] just such expectation for the prayer
[51:46] line. Let's stand together and sing only
[51:49] believe. Do you believe this morning?
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:54] I believe the same God is here.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have that same expectation
[51:59] this morning, my God is still a healer.
[52:02] He's still a savior. He's
[52:05] Baby's looking at me. You're going to
[52:07] make me emotional. My goodness, God's
[52:08] done such wonderful things for us.
[52:11] [Music]
[52:15] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could be like the one
[52:17] leper that came back and said, "I'm
[52:19] going worship you, Lord.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to be all like all the
[52:23] ones that just took their healing and
[52:24] went on, but I'm going to worship you.
[52:26] I'm going to praise you for what you've
[52:27] done. Let's just sing this together as
[52:29] we prepare to go to the word. Only
[52:33] believe.
[52:37] Only
[52:39] believe.
[52:42] Oh, all things
[52:47] if you'll only
[52:50] believe. Sing it now.
[52:55] Only believe.
[52:59] Only
[53:02] believe.
[53:05] All things are possible
[53:10] if you only
[53:12] believe. Lord, I believe. Oh Lord,
[53:17] [Music]
[53:18] I believe.
[53:20] Oh Lord,
[53:24] I believe.
[53:26] All things.
[53:29] [Music]
[53:33] Lord, I believe.
[53:37] Oh Lord,
[53:40] I believe. Oh yes, Lord. Oh Lord,
[53:46] I believe.
[53:50] All things are possible.
[53:55] Oh Lord, I
[53:58] believe.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Can we bow our heads together for a
[54:00] moment?
[54:02] Heavenly Father, we're so thankful,
[54:05] oh God, thankful for your healing power.
[54:08] Thankful for your grace here this
[54:10] morning. I pray, Lord, that there'd be
[54:12] one here in the sound of my voice that
[54:15] doesn't know you like they ought to. I
[54:17] pray that you'd reveal them yourself to
[54:20] them this morning. Lord, if there's one
[54:22] here in need of healing, I pray you'd
[54:24] heal them. And Lord, we all need a
[54:26] stirring in our hearts. God, we thank
[54:28] you for doing that in the meeting. But
[54:31] Lord, today is another day. We need to
[54:33] be stirred again, Lord. Our faith to be
[54:35] increased. Pray that you'd grant that
[54:37] this morning. If there's anything or
[54:40] that we do that is wrong, I pray you'd
[54:42] forgive us. We thank you for all that
[54:44] you've done in Jesus name.
[54:47] Amen.
[54:48] Amen.
[54:50] Thank the Lord. God bless you this
[54:53] morning. We're going to turn in the
[54:55] scriptures to 1 Coronicles chapter 17
[54:59] and verse one. 1 Chronicles 17 and 1. I
[55:04] don't uh mean to keep you standing this
[55:07] morning, but there's a little bit of a a
[55:08] reading. I want to read this first 14
[55:10] verses. So, just bear with us for a
[55:12] moment. 1 Chronicles 17 verse one
[55:17] says, "Now it came to pass as David sat
[55:19] in his house that David said to Nathan
[55:21] the prophet, oh, I dwell in a house of
[55:24] cedars, but the ark of the covenant of
[55:26] the Lord remainth under curtains."
[55:29] Nathan said unto David, "Do all that is
[55:31] in thine heart, for God is with thee."
[55:36] And it came to pass the same night the
[55:37] word of God came to Nathan, saying, "Go
[55:41] tell David, my servant, thus sayith the
[55:43] Lord, thou shalt not build me a house to
[55:45] dwell in. I have not dwelt in a house
[55:48] since the day that I brought up Israel
[55:50] unto this day, but have gone from tent
[55:53] to tent, and from one tabernacle to
[55:55] another. Whatsoever I have walked with
[55:57] all Israel, spake I a word to any of the
[56:00] judges of Israel, whom I commanded to
[56:02] feed my people, saying, Why have you not
[56:04] built me a house of cedars? He said,
[56:07] "Now therefore, thus shalt thou say unto
[56:09] my servant David, thus sayith the Lord
[56:10] of hosts, I took thee from the sheep
[56:12] coat, even from following the sheep,
[56:14] that thou shouldest be ruler over my
[56:16] people Israel, and I have been with
[56:19] thee, whethersoever thou hast walked,
[56:21] and have cut off all thine enemies from
[56:22] before thee, made thee a name like the
[56:24] name of the great men that are in the
[56:26] earth."
[56:28] He said, "Also, I will ordain a place
[56:29] for my people Israel, and I will plant
[56:31] them, and they shall dwell in their
[56:34] place, and shall be moved no more.
[56:36] Neither shall the children of wickedness
[56:38] waste them anymore as at the beginning.
[56:40] And since the time that I commanded
[56:41] judges to be over my people Israel,
[56:43] moreover, I will subdue all thine
[56:46] enemies. He said, "Furthermore, I tell
[56:48] thee that the Lord will build thee a
[56:49] house. It shall come to pass when thy
[56:52] days be expired that thou must go to be
[56:55] with thy fathers, I will raise up thy
[56:56] seed after thee, which shall be of thy
[56:58] sons. I will establish his kingdom, and
[57:01] he shall build me a house, and I will
[57:03] establish his throne forever." are
[57:05] speaking of Solomon also of Christ. He
[57:09] said, "I will be his father, and he
[57:10] shall be my son. I will not take my
[57:13] mercy away from him as I took it from
[57:15] him that was before thee, but I will
[57:18] settle him in my house and in my kingdom
[57:20] forever, and his throne shall be
[57:22] established forever more." God bless you
[57:25] can have your seats this morning.
[57:28] I want to speak to you this morning if
[57:30] God will give me grace and let me do it
[57:33] and if we'll listen closely and then
[57:35] tonight as well I'd like to uh speak on
[57:38] building the temple. So if you can
[57:41] listen carefully and then tonight uh
[57:43] we'll we'll continue. David had a desire
[57:46] to do something and that desire that he
[57:49] had was a good thing. It wasn't a a bad
[57:52] thing. It wasn't a evil thing but it was
[57:55] a good thing. something actually that
[57:57] needed to be done. Yeah,
[57:59] &gt;&gt; it was something that God was going to
[58:01] do. And so he wanted to build God a
[58:04] house, but God said, "No, David." He
[58:07] said, "I don't want you build the
[58:09] house." He said, he said, "Your son will
[58:12] build the house." And it's hard
[58:14] sometimes to hear that that, "Well, it's
[58:17] not going to happen in my generation,
[58:18] but the next generation is going to take
[58:21] it on." And so he told him that and
[58:24] David had learned through bringing back
[58:26] the ark that there are five musts when
[58:30] it comes to the will of the Lord and
[58:32] doing something for God because brother
[58:34] Brandon preached a sermon called trying
[58:36] to do God a service without being the
[58:38] will of God. He said it has to be his
[58:40] time his season when he said it would be
[58:43] and the man that he chose and it must
[58:45] come to the prophet and the prophet must
[58:48] be a vindicated prophet.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Right? So those are the five musts that
[58:52] had to be in order for something to be
[58:54] done. And so the job was right to do,
[58:58] but David was not the man that God
[59:00] ordained to do it. But brother said
[59:03] David desired to build him a house. But
[59:05] God seen the motive of the prophet. He
[59:08] seen the motive of the king and and
[59:10] their objectives. He said, "Go tell my
[59:13] servant David, who was he? I took him
[59:16] out of the sheep coat from following a
[59:19] few sheep. He made a king out of him. He
[59:21] said, brother Brandon says, what did he
[59:23] take you people from? I think all of us
[59:25] could look at that this morning and say,
[59:27] he brought me out of nothing into
[59:29] something.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; He brought me out of out of sin and
[59:32] darkness and the world and whatever it
[59:34] was that I was and whatever it was that
[59:36] that I was doing. And he made something
[59:39] out of my life.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that today. Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; He brought David out of the sheep coat,
[59:44] out of the barn,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; brought him to be a king of Israel.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:50] &gt;&gt; So he said, "What did he bring you
[59:52] from?" And I made him a name like great
[59:54] names. And brother Brandham gets
[59:56] personal with that. And he begins to
[59:58] talk about it from a personal
[1:00:00] perspective. He said, "When the Lord
[1:00:02] showed me that one day, I thought, oh
[1:00:04] God, what could I be? A poor little
[1:00:08] preacher back there. Never know more
[1:00:10] than Jeffersonville. One day by my cave,
[1:00:12] the Lord turned that to me and the first
[1:00:14] time I ever read it, he said, "I give
[1:00:16] you a great name like Oral Roberts or
[1:00:18] Billy Graham," he said, "Where did I get
[1:00:19] you from? What was you, but I just can't
[1:00:22] let you build a temple?"
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this for a moment.
[1:00:27] Brother Brandham didn't leave us a
[1:00:29] temple.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't leave us a great building.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't leave us a a a legacy in stone
[1:00:35] or in writing. What did he leave us? A
[1:00:38] message.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But but he said, "I can't let
[1:00:41] you build a temple."
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Because I'm going to let your son build
[1:00:45] it.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "For it was in types and
[1:00:48] shadows." Now, I know some people
[1:00:49] believe that was brother Brandham's
[1:00:50] natural son, but look what brother
[1:00:52] Brandham says.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; He said Solomon built him a temple, but
[1:00:57] the true son of David is Jesus Christ
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; that built the real temple. How many are
[1:01:03] glad for him today? that was born of
[1:01:06] virgin birth and in his body is the
[1:01:08] everlasting temple of God.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was a type. Brother Brandon,
[1:01:15] God showing brother Brandon, I'm not
[1:01:17] going to let you build the temple.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; He said, I'm going to let your son or
[1:01:20] I'm going to let the son of God, I'm
[1:01:22] going to let Jesus Christ build the
[1:01:25] temple.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; You see, David's job was to prepare for
[1:01:29] the temple. That's what I want to talk
[1:01:30] about this morning. Preparation. And
[1:01:32] we're preparing for something coming.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Preparing for something in the future.
[1:01:38] It's a very difficult thing to do. When
[1:01:40] you think about maybe not even doing
[1:01:42] something that's going to benefit your
[1:01:44] generation, but something that would
[1:01:46] benefit the next generation. Some of you
[1:01:48] older folks know what I'm talking about
[1:01:50] today. You know, your life maybe is
[1:01:51] getting close to the end. And and you
[1:01:53] realize you got more behind you than you
[1:01:55] do ahead of you. And you have to look at
[1:01:57] that and think, well, you know, maybe we
[1:01:59] just need to rest for a while and and
[1:02:01] sit still for a while. not do anything
[1:02:03] cuz it won't benefit me anyhow. But
[1:02:05] there's somebody coming behind you. It
[1:02:08] may not be for this generation to build
[1:02:10] a temple. But there's a temple being
[1:02:12] built.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; So there had to be a preparation made.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; For the temple that was coming.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist had that same job.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; He had to prepare to build to the
[1:02:29] temple. He was a preparation. In Isaiah
[1:02:32] 43, it says, "The voice of him that
[1:02:35] crith in the wilderness, prepare ye the
[1:02:38] way of the Lord."
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Make straight in the desert a
[1:02:42] highway for our God. Malachi 3:1,
[1:02:44] "Behold, I will send my messenger, and
[1:02:46] he shall prepare the way before me, and
[1:02:49] the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly
[1:02:51] come to his temple, even the messenger
[1:02:53] of the covenant whom you delight in." He
[1:02:55] said, "Behold, he shall come, sayeth the
[1:02:57] Lord of hosts." And in Matthew chapter
[1:03:00] 3, it speaks of John said, "In those
[1:03:02] days came John the Baptist preaching in
[1:03:03] the wilderness of Judea and
[1:03:05] saying,"Repent ye, for the kingdom of
[1:03:07] heaven is at hand. For this is he that
[1:03:09] was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,
[1:03:11] saying, the voice of one crying in the
[1:03:12] wilderness, prepare you the way of the
[1:03:14] Lord. Make his path straight."
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So John's message wasn't about
[1:03:20] John,
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; but it was about preparing the way for
[1:03:23] the one coming. All right.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Preparing the way for the one who was
[1:03:27] the temple of the almighty God.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So look what look what he says in John
[1:03:34] chapter 1 verse 29. The next day John
[1:03:38] sees Jesus coming unto him and sitha
[1:03:40] behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[1:03:43] the sin of the world. Look what he
[1:03:46] pointed to. He he's paved the way. He's
[1:03:48] made the way clear. He he he's
[1:03:50] reorganized the minds of the people and
[1:03:52] the hearts of the people. turn the
[1:03:54] hearts of the fathers back to the
[1:03:56] children. And there was to come one in
[1:03:58] this hour that turned the hearts of the
[1:03:59] children back to the fathers.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; But what was it? A preparation. What did
[1:04:04] he turn our hearts back for? To receive.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; The presence of God, the the the
[1:04:11] dwelling place of God.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Which was Jesus Christ himself.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Right. So to receive Christ now which
[1:04:20] the temple the earthly temple was just a
[1:04:22] a type of. So John says behold the lamb
[1:04:25] of God. John 3:26 says they came unto
[1:04:28] John and this is after he had announced
[1:04:31] him and said unto him rabbi he that was
[1:04:33] with thee beyond Jordan to whom thou
[1:04:35] beest witness behold the same baptizeth
[1:04:38] and all men come to him. Now they're
[1:04:40] looking at him. They're coming to John
[1:04:42] like this said, "Hey, your ministry is
[1:04:44] going downhill and his ministry is
[1:04:46] increasing.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Your ministry is dying." And that's the
[1:04:50] time when most men would actually begin
[1:04:53] to attack. Remember what Saul did? Saul
[1:04:56] looked at David and said, "I see my
[1:04:59] ministry going down, my kingship going
[1:05:01] down, his kingship coming up, and so now
[1:05:03] it's time to attack. Now it's the time
[1:05:05] to throw spears at him."
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Right? And we don't want to do that as
[1:05:10] an older generation as I've come to
[1:05:12] identify with you elders very much in
[1:05:15] the church. And
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; thank you, brother Gabe.
[1:05:20] You know, I identify with the young
[1:05:22] people for so long and now I come to
[1:05:24] identify more with the elders as I get
[1:05:26] older. And I found that that as elders,
[1:05:30] we we tend to uh we we tend to look at
[1:05:34] the young people coming up and say,
[1:05:35] "Well, you know, we we did it better
[1:05:39] and uh we had more and things were just
[1:05:43] better back in the day." You know, back
[1:05:45] in my day, my kids laugh whenever I get
[1:05:47] to talking about the way it was. And and
[1:05:50] the truth is, we leave some things out.
[1:05:54] Amen.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We just leave some things plum out of
[1:05:59] the picture. We tell them how hard it
[1:06:01] was, but we don't always tell them about
[1:06:02] the help we got, you know, and we tell
[1:06:04] them how we walked uphill, you know,
[1:06:07] both ways to school through 5t of snow
[1:06:09] and it was so difficult, you know, and
[1:06:11] we don't always tell them everything.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and and and we don't always
[1:06:15] recognize what they're going through.
[1:06:17] and
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; and and yet there's something for us to
[1:06:20] do because
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; we're not just concerned about our
[1:06:24] generation we're living in right now.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; But we're concerned about there's a
[1:06:29] temple coming.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Christ is coming back to the earth. You
[1:06:33] believe that?
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Right. And he's coming. We we go through
[1:06:38] the rapture and then he comes back three
[1:06:39] and a half years later. His feet step on
[1:06:41] Mount Olives. We believe that. We
[1:06:43] believe in a literal Jesus Christ. But
[1:06:44] the Bible said that's what believers
[1:06:46] believe. Yes.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; So, we're preparing a way.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; We're making a way for the rapture, a
[1:06:51] way for these things to happen. Brother
[1:06:53] Brandham taught us this. He said, "If it
[1:06:55] doesn't happen in my generation, let me
[1:06:57] help the next generation. Don't let me
[1:06:59] stand in somebody else's way that's got
[1:07:01] faith enough to grab a hold of of the
[1:07:03] rapture."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; But I believe it'll happen in our
[1:07:07] generation. I I believe that with all of
[1:07:09] my heart. I believe some of you elders
[1:07:10] going to see the coming of the Lord. I
[1:07:12] believe that's why he's let you live. I
[1:07:14] really believe that, Sister Fritz. I
[1:07:15] believe you're going to see the coming
[1:07:16] of the Lord. But if you don't, you paved
[1:07:19] the way for another generation of
[1:07:21] believers. And look, come on, church.
[1:07:22] Another generation of people that can
[1:07:24] that can be what God called them to be.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Now look,
[1:07:32] John's attitude towards this meant he
[1:07:35] was the perfect one for that job.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; They said, "All men come to him." And
[1:07:40] John answered and said, "A man can
[1:07:41] receive nothing except to be given him
[1:07:43] from heaven.
[1:07:45] He said, 'You yourselves bear me witness
[1:07:47] that I said I am not the Christ, but
[1:07:50] that I am sent before him.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; He that hath the bride is the
[1:07:54] bridegroom, but the friend of the
[1:07:56] bridegroom, which standeth and heareth
[1:07:58] him, rejoicth greatly because of the
[1:08:01] bridegroom's voice.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; This my joy therefore is fulfilled.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; He must increase,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:12] But I must
[1:08:14] decrease.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; And I want to deal with that this
[1:08:19] morning in a in a very personal way and
[1:08:21] maybe and we'll deal with the meaning of
[1:08:23] it, the actual meaning of it. But but if
[1:08:26] you want to think about it like this
[1:08:27] that every one of us as individuals, you
[1:08:31] know, brother Brandham taught us when
[1:08:32] you're 18 or 21, something in that in
[1:08:34] that realm, you begin to die. Amen.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You've increased
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; and now you decrease.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; And so when you reach an age where you
[1:08:44] begin to marry and have children and and
[1:08:46] things begin to happen in your life, you
[1:08:47] take on a different role.
[1:08:50] Instead of care being cared for, you
[1:08:53] care for others.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; You're really the rest of your life,
[1:08:58] what you're doing is setting things up
[1:09:00] for another generation to come.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; You don't just live for yourself,
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; right? You live for others,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; right? That's the way all of us do.
[1:09:09] Especially those of us who are married,
[1:09:11] have families, we live, our whole lives
[1:09:13] are for others,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; right? And that's really the way to find
[1:09:16] happiness yourself is to try to live for
[1:09:18] other people.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; That's eternal life. Brother Brandham
[1:09:21] taught us.
[1:09:23] But he said he must increase. So we have
[1:09:26] to decrease.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; To make way for him to increase.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; So we decrease. We give you. You mothers
[1:09:34] give to your children.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You give of yourselves. That's
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; And you decrease yourself
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; from your time
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; right
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; from your emotions
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; from your own body, right? When you have
[1:09:49] a child, you you decreased given of
[1:09:52] yourself,
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; So the baby can increase.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; You realize there's and I didn't intend
[1:09:57] to say this this morning, but did you
[1:09:59] realize there's a demographic crisis in
[1:10:01] America right now? because we're we're
[1:10:04] not having enough children. Not in this
[1:10:07] church. Praise God. But
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; there are I got to counting the other
[1:10:14] day. There are right now 47 children in
[1:10:17] the church younger than Peter.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I thank God for that.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's all right.
[1:10:24] I guess we're applauding the parents.
[1:10:28] But I really do, you know, I I thank God
[1:10:30] for that because but we got a great
[1:10:33] responsibility. Come on.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Right. But what you do with your
[1:10:36] children, there's this crisis of de
[1:10:38] demographics because we are not having
[1:10:41] enough children in America right now.
[1:10:43] We're below replacement level.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; And what that means is the next
[1:10:46] generation coming on is going to have to
[1:10:50] pay for more social security than what
[1:10:52] our generation did. the one after that
[1:10:54] and by 2050 it's going to go bankrupt
[1:10:57] according to the numbers.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; It'll go bankrupt because they you don't
[1:11:01] have enough children being born,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; right? To to cover for the elders. Even
[1:11:05] though it looks like the world's overpop
[1:11:07] populated, we've reached a tipping point
[1:11:08] in the world where we're actually the
[1:11:11] population starting to go down. And over
[1:11:14] the next hundred years, as the Lord
[1:11:15] carries, the population is going down.
[1:11:17] Why? They they figured they said, "Why?
[1:11:19] People have more money. People have more
[1:11:21] food. Why are they having less children?
[1:11:23] So they went out and started
[1:11:24] interviewing these these parents or
[1:11:26] these people that were married and they
[1:11:28] said,"Wh aren't you having children?"
[1:11:29] They said, "Well, we chose not to."
[1:11:32] Because we chose to live our lives
[1:11:34] without the bother
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; of children.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz children are a bother.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But what they're saying is, I'm I'm
[1:11:42] going to stay increased as long as I
[1:11:44] can. I'm gonna keep my youth and my
[1:11:46] beauty and everything as long as I can
[1:11:48] so that so that everybody else, you
[1:11:50] know, and I'm not going to decrease
[1:11:52] myself to to increase another. But
[1:11:54] that's not the way the world works. Not
[1:11:57] even in the natural is not the way it
[1:11:58] works. And it's sure not how the church
[1:12:00] works. How how the bride of Christ
[1:12:02] should look at things. We should say,
[1:12:04] "Lord, help me to decrease.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Help me to be the soil
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; that the next generation can be planted
[1:12:11] in.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Let my mistakes be stepping
[1:12:14] stones.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Let my let my life be a be a a beacon of
[1:12:18] light that other people might be able to
[1:12:20] see it. The next generation can see and
[1:12:22] say, "Yes, they made mistakes, but they
[1:12:24] overcome. They were sick, but God healed
[1:12:27] them. They were they were upset and
[1:12:29] weary, but God kept them through that
[1:12:31] time." And when they see our lives, they
[1:12:33] can step on that and go on to something
[1:12:35] greater.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Let our lives be the soul. We must
[1:12:39] decrease.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:41] So that Christ,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; the temple of God, can increase
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; even in our own children
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; in our church. What did John the Baptist
[1:12:51] do? Brother said, "The man that Jesus
[1:12:54] said there was never a man born of a
[1:12:55] woman like him or could compare with him
[1:12:58] until that time.
[1:13:00] Great prophet ordained of God before the
[1:13:02] foundation of the world." I feel his
[1:13:04] presence here this morning. I I believe
[1:13:06] he's here even in the preaching of the
[1:13:07] word.
[1:13:08] He said he's the great prophets
[1:13:10] ordained, spoke of 712 years before he
[1:13:13] came to the earth by the prophet Isaiah.
[1:13:15] What did he do when he seen a man come
[1:13:17] walking down out of the audience and he
[1:13:19] looked up above and saw that fire coming
[1:13:21] down from heaven in the form of a dove?
[1:13:23] He cried out, "I have need to be
[1:13:26] baptized of thee.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; I must decrease.
[1:13:32] He must increase." God can't have two on
[1:13:36] the earth at the same time. Only one has
[1:13:39] the message. You know, I must decrease.
[1:13:41] He is the messenger. Oh my. I've been up
[1:13:45] to this time. Now he takes my place. As
[1:13:49] Elisha, when Elijah went up and throw
[1:13:50] back his robe to Elisha, his ministry
[1:13:53] was finished. Elisha must take up where
[1:13:55] he left off. He must increase. I must
[1:13:57] decrease. John the Baptist. Brother
[1:13:59] Brandham takes that to a startling
[1:14:01] place. He says, "Be conscious of your
[1:14:04] littleness."
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; God had to have a prophet in John the
[1:14:10] Baptist who was conscious of his
[1:14:12] littleness.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; He had to have a prophet in this hour
[1:14:15] who was conscious of his littleness. Be
[1:14:18] conscious of your littleness. You're
[1:14:20] nothing.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to hear,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; right? No, I'm not saying saying that I
[1:14:26] think you're nothing. I'm telling you
[1:14:27] what the reality is of the of the gospel
[1:14:30] that these flesh bodies were nothing.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "How I'd like to dwell on that
[1:14:35] in a few minutes, but you're nothing."
[1:14:36] He said, "If you want to find out how
[1:14:37] great you are, put your finger down on a
[1:14:39] pool of water, a bucket of water, pull
[1:14:41] your finger out, try to find where you
[1:14:42] put your finger."
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're nothing. God can do
[1:14:46] without you. He can do without me."
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Look at the attitude that brother
[1:14:51] Brandham had. He didn't say, "Well, I'm
[1:14:53] the seventh angel messenger. I'm the one
[1:14:55] that God called. I'm the I'm Elijah that
[1:14:57] was to come. My ministry is to foreer
[1:14:59] the coming of Christ. God, he has to
[1:15:01] have me. That's not the attitude that he
[1:15:03] took. But he said, "Oh my," He said,
[1:15:05] "God can do without you. He can do
[1:15:07] without me, sir,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; but we can't do without him."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; We've got to have him. How many can say
[1:15:13] amen to that this morning? I've got to
[1:15:15] have him. We've got to have him.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; For he is life and he alone.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Not to know his book, not to know this
[1:15:22] or know that or know the creed, but to
[1:15:23] know him is life. Know him as the person
[1:15:26] Christ in you, the word made flesh in
[1:15:29] you. That's knowing him. When you and he
[1:15:32] become one, he said like I said in the
[1:15:34] super sign, he has to got to come in
[1:15:36] you. You God and man must become one.
[1:15:40] You're conscious
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; of your littleness.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Again, he said, look at John. No
[1:15:46] selfishness in him. He never took any
[1:15:48] glory. They tried to call him the
[1:15:50] Messiah, but he said, I'm not worthy to
[1:15:51] loose his shoes. But as soon as Jesus
[1:15:54] appeared, he had a sign, a pillar of
[1:15:55] fire, a light above him, like a dove
[1:15:57] come down, a voice saying, "This is my
[1:15:58] beloved son, whom I'm well pleased."
[1:16:00] Notice, and John immediately said, "He
[1:16:02] must increase, I must decrease." He
[1:16:05] presented the church, sir,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; to Christ.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; We're told that in the last days, he
[1:16:11] said that will repeat again.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; There is going to be a message come
[1:16:17] forth, sir.
[1:16:19] that will introduce the Messiah to the
[1:16:23] people. What did he say would introduce
[1:16:24] Messiah to the people?
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; The message.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you the question. Has
[1:16:30] it done it?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; We can testify for a little while.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Has it done it?
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Some of you all know
[1:16:43] brother JT was working in a shoe factory
[1:16:45] but the Messiah was introduced to him
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; by the message of the hour.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; When he found out about the message, he
[1:16:51] wasn't finding out just about a prophet
[1:16:53] and what he did and what his habits were
[1:16:55] and and where he lived. But what was he
[1:16:57] finding out? He was finding about a
[1:16:58] message that came through a prophet. And
[1:17:00] when he found out, come on. So many of
[1:17:02] you, you remember the time when you were
[1:17:04] you you come to the message of the hour.
[1:17:06] What were you coming to? You weren't
[1:17:08] coming to a a form or a fashion. You
[1:17:10] were coming to the word to Christ.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; It was more than just a story. The
[1:17:15] Mormons have stories. Jehovah's Witness
[1:17:17] have stories. They got a a program. They
[1:17:19] got things to say. But this was more
[1:17:21] than that. This was Christ.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And so
[1:17:29] the message
[1:17:30] came to him. A message came that would
[1:17:32] introduce the Messiah to the people. He
[1:17:34] said it'll be in such a way they'll
[1:17:35] stand dumbfounded like they did then. He
[1:17:39] said he promised it and they do and they
[1:17:41] send say well we're waiting on brother
[1:17:42] Brandham
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; to introduce us to Christ which I
[1:17:45] believe that we'll be we'll meet him
[1:17:47] with our messenger. I do believe that.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? He'll be
[1:17:51] resurrected and we'll be caught up with
[1:17:53] him
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; with all the saints
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; together in a general resurrection. Not
[1:17:57] a private resurrection,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; But in a general resurrection we'll be
[1:18:01] caught up together to meet them our Lord
[1:18:02] in the air. We're taught that.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Right. Each one will come up with his
[1:18:05] group. Right. I I believe I'll be
[1:18:07] introduced with you people.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Right. And the other brothers that have
[1:18:11] worked in your lives, the ministry that
[1:18:12] you've listened to, we'll be introduced
[1:18:14] together.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Right. As a group, and then we'll go on
[1:18:17] up and and there'll be our our messenger
[1:18:18] introduced with with the Leoian church
[1:18:20] age.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; I believe that's going to happen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; But we've already been introduced to
[1:18:25] Christ the word by the message.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Right. It has to have happened. Other
[1:18:31] words, other words, he could not have
[1:18:32] decreased.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? God couldn't have
[1:18:36] took him off the scene.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; We still needed him.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Right. But what we didn't realize is and
[1:18:42] and Lord knows if he was here this
[1:18:44] morning, if he was anywhere on the earth
[1:18:46] this morning, I'd be wherever he was.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Right? And I think many of you feel the
[1:18:50] same way. But he's not here for a reason
[1:18:52] because God said, "I'm going to let him
[1:18:54] introduce the message."
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And then a prophet said, "I must
[1:18:59] decrease that he might increase." Yes.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Now look,
[1:19:05] the message, this message was the
[1:19:08] unveiling of God. Go listen to the
[1:19:09] unveiling of God. Mighty God unveiled
[1:19:11] before us. This message unveiled God to
[1:19:14] us.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Right. And and and and the books and the
[1:19:18] tapes are not God.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; God speaks through those things.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; But that's not the God. This pulpit's
[1:19:25] not God. I'm This flesh is not God.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon's flesh was not God.
[1:19:30] That's right.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; But it was God speaking through a
[1:19:33] prophet. God speaking through the
[1:19:34] message of the hour. God speaking
[1:19:36] through a ministry today who say what he
[1:19:38] said.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Right. It's the same God. What is it?
[1:19:41] The unveiling of God. We can see God
[1:19:43] with skin on him. God tearing the veil
[1:19:46] or ripping the veil until the mercy seat
[1:19:48] which is in your heart comes in plain
[1:19:50] view.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; So he did it on the reformers taking on
[1:19:54] a veil. He said brother said he always
[1:19:56] took on a veil until finally come down
[1:19:57] through the Lutheran age down through
[1:19:59] the other age finally comes out into the
[1:20:01] complete. He said just before it comes a
[1:20:04] prophet arises again what it does it
[1:20:06] foreshadows the word showing back here
[1:20:08] revealing what's been done what's been
[1:20:09] left off that the church would not be
[1:20:11] without understanding and when this
[1:20:13] fades out he said then like John said I
[1:20:15] must decrease he must increase then all
[1:20:19] it all comes into him.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Come on
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; he is fully manifested.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh hallelujah through Luther
[1:20:26] Wesley Pentecostal age on down on down
[1:20:28] he's fully manifested you see coming
[1:20:30] down just the manifestation God
[1:20:32] unfolding see him now notice fulfilling
[1:20:34] his promises for this day as they had
[1:20:37] like this bottle be would be hid by a
[1:20:39] veil
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; right are you with me this morning
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; I know this is old to some of you but
[1:20:44] you just bear with me
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; we got a bunch of kids need to hear it
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; come on this bottle would be a veil and
[1:20:51] God veiled himself
[1:20:54] Right? And the unveiling of God. He
[1:20:56] unveiled himself, see a little bit
[1:20:58] through Wesley and a little bit through
[1:21:00] Luther.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But in our day,
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; through the message of a prophet,
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; he took the veil off.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Now we see Christ in plain view.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Now we see the word as it ought to be
[1:21:12] and as it was and as he intended for us.
[1:21:14] Now we can serve him without
[1:21:16] denomination getting in the way, without
[1:21:18] creeds getting in the way, without those
[1:21:20] things getting in the way. We can serve
[1:21:21] him. Then it's up to us how we apply
[1:21:23] that.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Right. But he decreased that the word
[1:21:27] Christ the Bible what what what he meant
[1:21:29] to show us would increase in our vision
[1:21:31] and our view.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Now look.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Now I I know a lot of people they try to
[1:21:38] decrease the prophet to increase
[1:21:40] themselves.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And when you hear that kind of
[1:21:44] preaching,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; that's a problem.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; He did not decrease to increase my
[1:21:50] ministry.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; He decreased to increase Christ.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And if I preach Christ
[1:22:01] and if you preach Christ, if you live
[1:22:03] Christ, what is it? You proclaiming the
[1:22:05] same message that he brought to us in
[1:22:07] the beginning.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:22:14] he's fully manifested in this day. Moses
[1:22:17] was the word in that day because the
[1:22:18] word was given to him for that day.
[1:22:20] Joseph was the word in his days
[1:22:21] portraying Christ. Exactly. Each one of
[1:22:23] them was the word. And when Jesus came,
[1:22:25] he was the word in its fullness. Because
[1:22:28] again, look, Moses part.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Is this making any sense?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Moses partially unveiled.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; So the other prophets, he unveiled
[1:22:39] himself more and more and more. But in
[1:22:42] Christ,
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; right? You can read the name on the
[1:22:45] bottle
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; if you can see that far.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You could see who he was. Yeah,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; he was the fullness of God manifested.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; So what was it now? He said they were
[1:22:57] only part of the word pointing to it.
[1:22:58] Notice, keep your thought. Here it
[1:22:59] comes. He said the whole plan wasn't in
[1:23:01] them. They were pointing to it.
[1:23:03] Therefore, after him the fullness. We
[1:23:05] cannot point back to something else. We
[1:23:08] don't veil the Bible again and teach
[1:23:10] denominational doctrine. We preach the
[1:23:12] message of the hour because Christ has
[1:23:15] come in plain view to us.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:20] So, so here it comes. He said, he said
[1:23:22] this is this is the complete revelation.
[1:23:24] How many believe that this he said in
[1:23:26] the volume of the book that that's what
[1:23:28] he come in the volume of the book this
[1:23:30] is the complete revelation. Nothing can
[1:23:32] be added or taken away from it. There is
[1:23:33] the complete revelation. All that a
[1:23:36] shadow of him to come. But when he come
[1:23:38] he was the perfect Hebrews 1, God in
[1:23:40] sunundry time spoke to the fathers
[1:23:42] through the prophet. God spoke through
[1:23:43] veils the prophet but in this last days
[1:23:45] through his son Jesus Christ. There you
[1:23:47] are unveiled out there on Calvary. The
[1:23:49] son of God unveiled. Listen, brother
[1:23:51] Brandham didn't come to bring us a new
[1:23:52] Bible. But what did brother Brandham
[1:23:54] come to do? The denomination had put a
[1:23:56] veil over the Bible. The message of the
[1:23:58] hour come to rip off that veil
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; so we could see what the Bible really
[1:24:03] said.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon, we do have today by
[1:24:09] God's help the perfect interpretation of
[1:24:10] the word with divine vindication. I I
[1:24:13] believe that with all of my heart.
[1:24:17] Now, we got a foundation laid this
[1:24:18] morning. We can preach.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I I don't feel much like a preacher
[1:24:25] after hearing the preaching this
[1:24:26] weekend. Last weekend, I went back and
[1:24:28] listened to that
[1:24:30] and some of what was said, especially
[1:24:33] Friday night, Saturday morning, inspired
[1:24:36] what I have to say today.
[1:24:38] In his preparation,
[1:24:40] David had to find a place,
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; right? Because if you're going to build
[1:24:44] a temple, you got to have a lot to build
[1:24:47] it on.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Right. So the the temple was built 2
[1:24:52] Chronicles 3:1. It was built. He Solomon
[1:24:54] began to build the house of the Lord at
[1:24:56] Jerusalem in Mount Mariah where the Lord
[1:24:58] appeared unto David his father in the
[1:25:01] place that David had prepared.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; In the threshing floor of Ornan the
[1:25:09] Jebusite. Now, some of you remember uh
[1:25:11] Friday night, brother Wendell at the
[1:25:13] very end. I don't believe it was in his
[1:25:15] notes. It was just something he was
[1:25:16] inspired to say, but he was preaching to
[1:25:20] us and he talked about Ornand the
[1:25:21] Jebusite who uh he uh who was with David
[1:25:27] and how they negotiated, remember, over
[1:25:29] the price of the property.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And David would not take it without
[1:25:35] paying a price.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, what David goes through to
[1:25:40] buy that property is very instructive to
[1:25:42] us because many times we go through
[1:25:43] trials, we don't understand what's going
[1:25:45] on. But God's doing something in our
[1:25:47] lives.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, David reached a point where he
[1:25:50] got kind of built up in himself and he
[1:25:53] numbered the people.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; He counted the people.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Now, they weren't supposed to do that.
[1:25:58] Now, it's not wrong to count people just
[1:26:00] in general. You don't have to not count.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; But the reason the Israelites were not
[1:26:04] supposed to count
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; is because it wasn't supposed to matter.
[1:26:08] right? How many soldiers they had,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; right? Because if they started counting
[1:26:13] how many soldiers they had, they were
[1:26:14] always going to be in the minority.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; And that'd be instructive for us, too,
[1:26:18] to understand. We're always going to be
[1:26:19] in the minority. You say, "Oh, it looks
[1:26:21] like the message in the it's always
[1:26:22] going to be."
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Jesus was when he was here. He was one
[1:26:26] man on the earth. He had 12 disciples
[1:26:28] and they all run away from him.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; But look what's happened since then.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now look, but but but the
[1:26:37] message is in the minority. Obviously,
[1:26:39] we know that that's true. And and and
[1:26:42] David though, he counted the people. He
[1:26:43] said, he said, "I'm going to find out
[1:26:46] how many we have." And God comes up to
[1:26:48] him.
[1:26:50] He says, he says, "I'm going to give you
[1:26:52] a choice
[1:26:55] of your punishment."
[1:26:57] He said, "There'd be this happen or I I
[1:27:00] believe it was your enemy would fall.
[1:27:01] They'd fall among their enemies." He
[1:27:03] said, "Or a plague by the hand of the
[1:27:06] Lord."
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; And David said, "I'd rather fall into
[1:27:11] the hands of a merciful God."
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of wisdom in that.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; You know, if I'm going to have trouble
[1:27:20] in life, I might as well just do what's
[1:27:22] right.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Do what the word says. There's going to
[1:27:24] be trouble anyway.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; I might as well just do what the word
[1:27:27] says. Fall in the hands of a merciful
[1:27:28] God.
[1:27:30] So David took that choice and a great
[1:27:32] plague fell and many people died because
[1:27:35] of David numbering the people. Don't
[1:27:36] make sense to us, but to God it was a
[1:27:39] great sin.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; And so now David, David begins to uh you
[1:27:48] know begins to plead with God and God
[1:27:50] stays the hand of the death angel. And
[1:27:53] when he does, now David goes up to the
[1:27:56] threshing floor. The angel tells him go
[1:27:58] and and and make an altar. And David
[1:27:59] goes up to the threshing floor of Orand
[1:28:03] to make to buy a place for an altar.
[1:28:06] And Ornand in 1st Chronicles 21:23,
[1:28:08] Ornand said it to David, "Take it to
[1:28:10] thee. Let my lord the king do that which
[1:28:12] is good in his eyes. Lo, I give thee the
[1:28:15] oxen also for burnt offerings, and the
[1:28:17] threshing instruments for wood, and the
[1:28:18] wheat for the meat offering. I give it
[1:28:20] all."
[1:28:21] But David had been through some things.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And David had learned he he'd been
[1:28:26] through a great a great terrible plague.
[1:28:28] And he said, "I'm going to make sure
[1:28:30] that I do everything I can do."
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I'm not going to take
[1:28:35] what doesn't cost me anything. I'm not
[1:28:37] going to offer sacrifices in a place
[1:28:39] that I didn't do anything to get it
[1:28:40] there."
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I you you'd give it to
[1:28:44] me." It's the same attitude that Abraham
[1:28:46] had when he was buying the place.
[1:28:48] Remember Mcpila, the cave of Mpila? He
[1:28:50] said, "I'm not going to take it from
[1:28:52] you. I want to pay for it." Because the
[1:28:54] price had to be paid. There could be no
[1:28:56] question about who it belonged to.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; And David
[1:29:01] comes to Orna and he said, the king
[1:29:04] David said to Orin, "Nay, I will verily
[1:29:07] buy it for the full price."
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad he paid the
[1:29:11] full price for you?
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he didn't stop short?
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he prepared a way for
[1:29:16] you to come? Sir,
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; he said, "For I will not take that which
[1:29:20] is thine for the Lord, nor offer burnt
[1:29:22] offerings without cost."
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Wendle dealt with that so
[1:29:29] eloquently.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; This is the same place, Mount Mariah,
[1:29:34] that Abraham offered Isaac
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; and was provided a ram.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And I think it teaches us something this
[1:29:41] morning that if we want to fulfill the
[1:29:42] will of God, sometimes we have to lay
[1:29:45] down our own egos.
[1:29:47] Yeah, that's right.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And and the and the idea that we built
[1:29:51] of how God's going to work in our lives.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; And what he's going to do,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; our ministry that we built in our heads.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Our church that we built in our heads,
[1:30:01] our family that we built. Some of you
[1:30:03] young people, you're going to get
[1:30:04] married. You think, and you say, "Well,
[1:30:06] I'm going to marry the prettiest girl,
[1:30:08] and we're going to have the the
[1:30:10] wonderful home, and I'm going to have
[1:30:11] the best job, and we're never going to
[1:30:13] have any trouble." Do you realize that
[1:30:15] maybe that's not what God has for you?
[1:30:17] Maybe maybe there's going to be a little
[1:30:19] house on a little street and you'll be
[1:30:21] maybe a seemingly insignificant person,
[1:30:24] but you got to be able to surrender
[1:30:25] yourself to the will of God. Cuz
[1:30:27] sometimes you got to be little before
[1:30:29] you can be big. The way up is down.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; That's why so many young people get in
[1:30:35] debt because they want to live the life
[1:30:37] their parents live and they haven't paid
[1:30:38] the price.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] How can you preach that, brother Ben?
[1:30:45] Because I did it.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; If you want to fulfill the will of God,
[1:30:53] sometimes you have to pay full price,
[1:30:55] listen to me this morning, for things
[1:30:57] you will never use.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; You got to build things for children
[1:31:04] that aren't yours.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Pray for people you'll never meet again.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Come on. Very good.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Preach to people that can give you
[1:31:14] nothing in return.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Hope you're hearing me now.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Deal with people that maybe have the
[1:31:21] worst problems and the worst situation
[1:31:23] and cause you the most trouble
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; are you with me now? But you got to be
[1:31:29] willing to pay full price because you
[1:31:31] don't know what God's going to do.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Come on
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; with the materials you're gathering. Are
[1:31:36] you with me this morning? You don't know
[1:31:38] what God's going to do with these things
[1:31:40] that you're putting together.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Pay full price for things you will never
[1:31:46] use so your children have a place to
[1:31:50] worship.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about money, church.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about our lives.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicles 22:1 said, "David said,
[1:32:01] "This is the house of the Lord God, and
[1:32:04] this is the altar of the burnt offering
[1:32:06] for Israel." David realized that
[1:32:08] threshing floor, he went through what he
[1:32:10] went through for a reason. Some of you
[1:32:11] elders know what I'm talking about. You
[1:32:13] went through what you went through for a
[1:32:14] reason. That sickness came for a reason.
[1:32:17] That pain was there for a reason. And
[1:32:19] now you bought a place to worship God.
[1:32:21] Through that pain, through that
[1:32:22] sickness, through that heartache,
[1:32:24] through that trial, there's a place
[1:32:25] there you can worship God. And you give
[1:32:27] it your all to come to the house of God.
[1:32:29] And you say, "This is the house of the
[1:32:31] Lord God."
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; This is the altar of the burnt offering
[1:32:34] for Israel.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And David commanded together the
[1:32:38] strangers that were in the land of
[1:32:39] Israel. And he sent masons to he rot
[1:32:42] stones to build the house of God. And I
[1:32:46] could just see somebody coming by after
[1:32:48] they heard the prophets na Nathan's
[1:32:50] message.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; When Nathan said, "David, you're not to
[1:32:53] build the temple."
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; And somebody comes by the next day and
[1:32:57] they hear
[1:32:59] hammering and sawing and
[1:33:02] what in the world?
[1:33:06] David, you're not supposed to build the
[1:33:07] temple. Leave it for the next
[1:33:09] generation.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; David said, "He never said I couldn't
[1:33:12] prepare."
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; There's a revelation in it, church.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't prepare the
[1:33:21] temple.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't buy the
[1:33:23] materials.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; He never said I couldn't make some
[1:33:25] nails.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; look what he says in verse three. And
[1:33:31] David prepared iron in abundance
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; for the nails,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; for the doors of the gates, for the
[1:33:40] joinings. David was collecting nails,
[1:33:44] hinges,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; for gates he would never open.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Doors he would never walk through.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; We got to expand our vision beyond our
[1:33:58] own life sometimes.
[1:34:02] for the joinings for brass in abundance
[1:34:04] without wait also cedar trees in
[1:34:06] abundance for the Zidonians and they oft
[1:34:08] brought much cedarwood
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; to David none of that benefited David at
[1:34:12] all
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; right
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; construction can't even begin until he's
[1:34:17] gone he must decrease
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; are you with me now
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; he must decrease so that Solomon can
[1:34:25] increase
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; right
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; but look at his attitude I can't build
[1:34:29] the temple But I can make the nails.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't pout. He didn't protest.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; He didn't wonder why he got used less
[1:34:37] than others.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You realize sometimes the reason we have
[1:34:42] young people play and do and and work in
[1:34:44] the church is not because we don't have
[1:34:46] elders that could do as good a job or
[1:34:48] better.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the reason we use young people
[1:34:51] is because somebody's got to train the
[1:34:53] next generation.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; They got to know how to do it.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. Because none of us are
[1:34:59] going to live forever unless we go by
[1:35:01] way of the rapture. And if we do, none
[1:35:02] of us going to matter anyway.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But if we don't, if it'll last for
[1:35:06] another generation, there'll be a
[1:35:08] generation ready to worship in the house
[1:35:10] of God.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; It's time to make some nails.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Take some brass and gather it up and
[1:35:17] make some nails. You say, "Well, I'm not
[1:35:18] a preacher." You can make some nails for
[1:35:20] the house of God.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You can start set a
[1:35:25] an atmosphere. I watch some of our older
[1:35:26] folks sit stay get in here early and
[1:35:28] worship the Lord. What does that do? It
[1:35:30] sets a pattern for our young people that
[1:35:32] when they see that they realize this is
[1:35:33] what a Christian does. This is what an
[1:35:35] elder does in the house of God. I thank
[1:35:37] you for doing that. What are you doing?
[1:35:38] Every time you come, you're you're
[1:35:40] building another nail.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; Making another nail. Putting together
[1:35:45] another hinge for a door you'll never
[1:35:47] walk through. or one day maybe after
[1:35:49] you're gone, a young person will walk
[1:35:51] through that door into freedom and oh
[1:35:53] God, walk out of drugs and alcohol and
[1:35:55] everything else into freedom because you
[1:35:57] did your part
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; in the house of God.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm not needed. I'm not
[1:36:02] wanted. I don't have to be there." Well,
[1:36:05] that kind of attitude
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; doesn't benefit you and it doesn't
[1:36:09] benefit the next generation either.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:15] Jesus knew he had to die.
[1:36:19] That was his primary purpose. What he
[1:36:21] came to do
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; was to die.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; His body
[1:36:28] would become would have to die and rot
[1:36:30] and become soil
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; that the church could be planted in.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:36:37] He said, "Verily, verily, I say to you,
[1:36:39] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:36:40] ground and die." But the brenam always
[1:36:43] adds to that and rots.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; it's good.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; It abideth alone, but if it die, it
[1:36:50] bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; So, it's necessary. And think about it
[1:36:56] just in the natural. And I'm almost out
[1:36:58] of time, but think about it just in the
[1:37:00] natural. It's necessary for us in the
[1:37:02] natural. Somebody had to go through the
[1:37:05] hard work
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; of inventing things we don't even think
[1:37:09] about today. Yeah,
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; somebody figured out how to use iron.
[1:37:16] Turn it into weapons of war. Turn it
[1:37:18] into things. This building is made out
[1:37:20] of iron.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to figure out how to do
[1:37:24] that.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; And we don't even think about it. It's
[1:37:27] so common.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; But somebody had to do it. A generation
[1:37:30] had to go into the ground.
[1:37:33] Generations of soldiers
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; have watered the fields of of Normandy
[1:37:38] and the fields of of Okinawa and the
[1:37:41] fields of the Philippines with their
[1:37:43] blood.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; The Civil War was fought right here in
[1:37:48] our country. They watered the field with
[1:37:50] their blood.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And out of that the sacrifice of them
[1:37:54] young men come a nation that we have
[1:37:56] today
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; where we can worship in freedom.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Something has to
[1:38:02] die. It's the law of God. Then if that's
[1:38:04] so L or let me die in such a way that
[1:38:08] the next generation could be increased.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If it kills me, let me stay
[1:38:14] in the house of God. Let me worship God.
[1:38:16] Let me do what God wants done. Let me be
[1:38:19] what God wants in my life.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Now is not the time to give up. Now, as
[1:38:23] you reach the last years of your life,
[1:38:25] I'm preaching to you elders, but also to
[1:38:27] our younger people, but as you elders
[1:38:28] reach the last years of your life, now's
[1:38:30] not the time to give up and say, "Well,
[1:38:32] nobody does it right anymore, and nobody
[1:38:34] No, now's the time to to let your let
[1:38:37] the things that you do become the
[1:38:39] bedding ground
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; for another generation."
[1:38:43] Good.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're afraid to talk about
[1:38:50] what we've been through. And I don't
[1:38:51] think we ought to glorify the devil, but
[1:38:52] sometimes our children need to hear.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Our young people need to hear what God
[1:38:57] brought us from.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; So that they'll know.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all got testimonies.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You need to share those. Yeah,
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not don't necessarily mean up here,
[1:39:10] although that's wonderful to do that,
[1:39:11] but but share those with our young
[1:39:13] people. Share those with our with those
[1:39:15] around you, with your children, with
[1:39:16] your grandchildren,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; cuz you've been through some things.
[1:39:19] You've seen some things and you know
[1:39:21] what God can do.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; You know what you were and you know what
[1:39:24] you are. There's no shame in that.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Let God have the glory of it.
[1:39:31] Now,
[1:39:33] God Jesus had to die. What did he have
[1:39:36] to die to? His own will. Just like
[1:39:39] David, right? David wanted to build the
[1:39:43] temple. God said, "You won't build the
[1:39:45] temple. Your son will build the temple."
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; And Jesus knew that if he stayed alive,
[1:39:50] he would be the last one of his kind.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; But if he died on a cross,
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; the blood and the water would be
[1:39:59] separated from him, forming the bride,
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; right? And that spirit would come back
[1:40:03] on the day of Pentecost. And we are the
[1:40:05] bride part of him.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Our sins were judged in his own body
[1:40:10] there on the tree.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And because of that, what
[1:40:14] what what happens? He knew he had to
[1:40:17] die. He wanted to stay there. But he
[1:40:19] knew he had to die in order to produce a
[1:40:22] temple of God.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; In order for a temple to be built, in
[1:40:25] order for a church to come forth, he had
[1:40:28] to die for a bride to be born. He had to
[1:40:30] die to his own will. Just like David,
[1:40:33] just like Abraham. Listen, the Bible
[1:40:35] said, "Though he were a son, yet learned
[1:40:36] he obedience by the things which he
[1:40:38] suffered. And being made perfect, he
[1:40:41] became the author of eternal salvation
[1:40:44] unto all them that obey him, called of
[1:40:46] God a high priest after the order of
[1:40:48] Melzdc, he had to die." But the Brandon
[1:40:50] said, "For only out of death comes
[1:40:52] life." Did you hear that? Only out of
[1:40:54] death, lest a corn wheat falls into the
[1:40:56] ground, it abides alone. If it dies, it
[1:40:58] produces life. Jesus had to die to
[1:41:01] produce eternal life. He said, "Now
[1:41:03] listen closely, Christian friends.
[1:41:04] Unless you die to yourself and your
[1:41:07] feelings."
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Your feelings act on God's word, you'll
[1:41:13] never have life.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Forget your feelings. Just take what God
[1:41:18] said. How many can do that this morning?
[1:41:20] Forget your feelings. Take what God
[1:41:21] said. Plant that seed into that life of
[1:41:24] your own death, sir.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. and life will be produced
[1:41:28] out of there and you shall live.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? The seed of God has
[1:41:34] to grow in the soil of your own death.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Or it'll never grow.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Good. Very good.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; So Paul said, "I died daily so that the
[1:41:46] seed of God might produce much fruit."
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Abraham died on that mountain to his own
[1:41:54] conception.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. of how the promise would be
[1:41:57] fulfilled.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; David died on that mountain. When the
[1:42:01] angel said gave him a choice, he let me
[1:42:03] fall into the hands of a merciful God.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And Jesus died.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; When he said, "Father, not my will but
[1:42:10] thine be done." But the Bible said he
[1:42:12] died more death in Gethsemane than he
[1:42:14] did on the cross.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; He said the Holy Ghost is the way.
[1:42:18] There's nothing will take its place. No
[1:42:20] theology, no church, no big buildings,
[1:42:22] no organizations. Nothing will ever take
[1:42:24] the place of the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:42:26] God's way, the Holy Spirit, being filled
[1:42:27] with the Holy Ghost. He said the promise
[1:42:29] is to you if you'll just receive it. God
[1:42:32] made a preparation. Aren't you glad that
[1:42:34] he did? David made a preparation. God
[1:42:37] made a preparation for whosoever will.
[1:42:39] The conference was held. Decisions was
[1:42:41] made. He said, "Men all down through the
[1:42:43] age has stumbled at that." So simple.
[1:42:47] I I've listened to that. I listen to
[1:42:49] that testimony again. I stumbled across
[1:42:50] it the other day. Brother Brandham was
[1:42:52] dealing with an elderly woman and and
[1:42:54] they they they taped the testimony. I'm
[1:42:55] glad that they did cuz brother Brandon's
[1:42:57] trying to tell her she's a Christian and
[1:42:59] she refuses to believe it.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; She just has a difficult time with that.
[1:43:05] Brother Brandham just keeps telling her,
[1:43:06] "I I know your life. I'm your pastor.
[1:43:09] I'm your shepherd.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; And God hasn't shown me anything that's
[1:43:12] wrong. You're a Christian. Just the
[1:43:13] devil trying to trouble you."
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Right? And so many times we what we do
[1:43:18] is we we think there's got to be more to
[1:43:21] it.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; So we just we frustrate the grace of God
[1:43:24] because we're always and you can hear
[1:43:26] the word of God says by his blood you're
[1:43:29] clean. By his blood you're forgiven. By
[1:43:31] his blood you've been made clean and
[1:43:32] whole. All you got to do is believe it
[1:43:34] and accept it and rejoice in it. And we
[1:43:36] want there to be something more to it.
[1:43:38] And and so we all you got to do is die
[1:43:40] to yourself.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; And sometimes that means just simply
[1:43:43] accepting what he's done.
[1:43:46] You can't cover yourself. Take God's
[1:43:47] covering. You can't learn how to do it.
[1:43:50] There's no learning about it. God does
[1:43:51] it himself. It's supernatural through
[1:43:54] life. God does the covering. He said,
[1:43:55] "You can't do it."
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not as much as you try to do
[1:43:58] it. You can no more clean yourself from
[1:44:00] sin by joining churches and taking
[1:44:02] creeds."
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, young people. Then a
[1:44:04] leopard could lick his own spots off.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine that, Melody? If a
[1:44:11] leopard with his spots
[1:44:14] I'm not going to say anything else for a
[1:44:16] minute that's worth writing down.
[1:44:18] If a leopard could take his his tongue
[1:44:22] and lick his own spots off,
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; he can't do it, can he?
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Does it sound silly? That's what it's
[1:44:28] like when we try to save ourselves.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; When we try to just be good enough to be
[1:44:33] saved,
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; say it's like a leopard trying to lick
[1:44:35] his own spots off.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You can't do it. Jesus said, "Which of
[1:44:38] you by taking thought can add one cubit
[1:44:41] to his stature?" You can't add an inch
[1:44:42] to your height. right?
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Or take an inch away.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But God made you what you are and
[1:44:50] he's given you his spirit. You've got,
[1:44:52] he said, you've got to die to yourself,
[1:44:54] your own thoughts. Give up and let the
[1:44:56] Holy Spirit cover you with his presence
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; and his power. That's God's decision.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; See, sometimes you have to die to today
[1:45:05] so tomorrow can come into existence.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; They say in finance they I think it's
[1:45:11] Dave Ramsey that says it. said, "You got
[1:45:12] to live like no one else so tomorrow you
[1:45:14] can live like no one else."
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; You got to die to yourself today
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; for the future. I know that's difficult
[1:45:22] to do,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; but but our young people, it's very hard
[1:45:26] for them to do that, especially if they
[1:45:27] don't see us doing it.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Give up and let the Holy Spirit cover
[1:45:33] you with his presence and his power.
[1:45:34] That's God's decision.
[1:45:36] See, the Greeks come when Jesus was
[1:45:38] alive and they told they they come to
[1:45:40] the disciples. They said sers we would
[1:45:42] see Jesus.
[1:45:44] Brother Brandon preaches a sermon on
[1:45:45] that many times he preached that and and
[1:45:48] Jesus that's when he said except a corn
[1:45:50] wheat fall and die it abides alone.
[1:45:53] And here what was it? He had to have a
[1:45:56] gentile body a house to dwell in but he
[1:45:59] had to die for that house to be built.
[1:46:01] But remember today we try to find him in
[1:46:03] everything. We try to find him in a
[1:46:05] church building. We try to find him in a
[1:46:06] denomination. We try to find him in
[1:46:08] saying some creed. We try to find him by
[1:46:10] keeping certain days, by obeying certain
[1:46:12] rituals. Oh, come on, church. We don't
[1:46:13] find him in legalism. We cannot find
[1:46:16] till we come to Calvary. There we are
[1:46:18] crucified, fallen into the dust of the
[1:46:20] earth, died to ourselves, then reborn
[1:46:22] again, then we find Jesus.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, so many try today to hold their self
[1:46:26] and maintain their own idea. If you have
[1:46:29] got my way of it, I believe this. But
[1:46:30] you cannot find Christ until you die to
[1:46:33] yourself and accept him, the word, then
[1:46:36] you find life.
[1:46:38] there would be a gentile church. They
[1:46:39] said, "Sir, we see Jesus." They were
[1:46:41] Gentiles. And he said, "There will be a
[1:46:43] gentile church, but first I've got to
[1:46:46] die."
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about a a
[1:46:52] converted gun that he had. You remember
[1:46:53] the Weatherbe Magnum or the gun he
[1:46:56] hadn't made like a Weatherbe Magnum,
[1:46:58] boarded out
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and had it fixed so it shoot like a
[1:47:01] Weatherbe Magnum because he didn't want
[1:47:02] to spend the money on the real thing.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to pay the price for it.
[1:47:08] So they they made him one like a
[1:47:10] Weatherbe magnum and it blew up in his
[1:47:12] face. Remember? Almost killed him.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "I learned a
[1:47:16] lesson there." Yes,
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; You're becoming a Christian or want to
[1:47:19] be a Christian. Just don't fool around
[1:47:21] with this here handshaking stuff. This
[1:47:23] here overnight conversion. It'll blow up
[1:47:25] somewhere along down the road.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "If that had been a Weatherbe
[1:47:29] Magnum, begin a Weatherbe Magnum,
[1:47:31] brought out a Weatherbe Magnum, it would
[1:47:32] have been all right. It would have been
[1:47:34] made for the shell. But when you're
[1:47:36] trying to put a big shell that goes in
[1:47:38] another gun in something that ain't able
[1:47:39] to stand it. That's why it don't work
[1:47:41] when you try to be something that you're
[1:47:42] not
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; right. But he said if you want to be a
[1:47:45] Christian, you be born again. Die to
[1:47:47] yourself. Start from the bottom and come
[1:47:49] forth. He said there won't be no blowups
[1:47:51] along the road. You'll be able to hold
[1:47:52] the charge the Holy Ghost puts in you.
[1:47:54] That's right. If you don't, you'll never
[1:47:55] be able to stand it.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want to say this in
[1:48:00] closing. We'll pick it up tonight. David
[1:48:03] would never wash his hands in the brazen
[1:48:06] sea.
[1:48:08] He would never walk on floors overlaid
[1:48:12] with pure gold.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; The floors were overlaid with pure gold.
[1:48:20] You think God don't like nice things? He
[1:48:22] does.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; But what he loves even more than that is
[1:48:25] a repentant heart.
[1:48:29] But they overlaid the the floor with
[1:48:31] gold, the walls with gold. When you walk
[1:48:34] into the temple, you they made
[1:48:37] reproductions of it, made it to the
[1:48:38] specification. You can see it. It was
[1:48:40] gold all the way around as you come into
[1:48:42] the Holy of Holies.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Cedar overlaid with gold, with ivory,
[1:48:48] even the the nails of shiny brass.
[1:48:52] Listen, David would never walk on those
[1:48:54] floors.
[1:48:56] He would never stand at the dedication
[1:48:57] and offer prayer.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; He He didn't see the smoke fill the
[1:49:06] temple.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all ought to be grateful God's
[1:49:10] let you live long enough to see this
[1:49:11] day.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; See what God's doing among his people
[1:49:14] right now
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; cuz you were a part of it.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; But there will be things happen after
[1:49:18] you're gone that the Lord carries that
[1:49:20] you never saw the results of, but you
[1:49:22] were part of it. Come on.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; You take that. Let the de when the devil
[1:49:26] tries to beat you up and say you're
[1:49:27] worthless and you don't do no good to
[1:49:29] the body of Christ. You I was a part of
[1:49:31] that. I stood through the hard times. I
[1:49:33] was there during that. I knew what what
[1:49:35] it was like to to when it was difficult.
[1:49:37] And now I've seen God begin to do
[1:49:38] miracles and things begin to happen.
[1:49:40] What is it? You you made some nails.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; You brought in some stones.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You wrote some songs.
[1:49:56] Good.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; David would never stand there.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Solomon stood there and the doorpost of
[1:50:05] the temple moved at the dedication of
[1:50:07] the temple, but David was gone. God
[1:50:09] wouldn't let him stand there.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Wasn't his part.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; But all the nails
[1:50:16] and the hinges.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't need notoriety. Come on,
[1:50:22] church. I don't want I don't I don't
[1:50:24] need my name to go down and say, "Well,
[1:50:25] he helped the message of the air." We've
[1:50:26] had brothers like that that they helped
[1:50:28] the message so much and think of some
[1:50:29] that have gone on, but they Perry Green,
[1:50:31] but they had older now and and can't
[1:50:33] preach anymore and and it's but I thank
[1:50:36] God for his contribution to the message.
[1:50:37] But I don't I don't need my name to go
[1:50:39] down as somebody who contributed greatly
[1:50:41] to the message. But let me make a nail.
[1:50:43] Let me let me forge a hinge.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; That's enough. I just want to be a part
[1:50:48] of what God's doing in our hour. Yeah.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Never would stand and see it.
[1:50:56] Brother Brandham didn't live to see the
[1:50:58] bride we have today.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; You look at the meeting that we had. You
[1:51:03] know, realize brother Brandham never got
[1:51:04] to go to meetings like that.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; He had his own meetings.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; They were filled with all kinds of
[1:51:12] people.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; There were no message people.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Now we can gather together and think
[1:51:17] about the the benefit of that. people
[1:51:20] full of the Holy Ghost and worship.
[1:51:22] Brother B never got to see it.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; But every nail
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; he made a way
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; that the Lord could suddenly come to his
[1:51:34] temple.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; David made the nails in the doors. And
[1:51:39] when they began to sing,
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Every song that they sang was one David
[1:51:47] wrote. He was writing songs for the
[1:51:50] future. Sometimes you, you know,
[1:51:52] sometimes David wrote out of what was
[1:51:53] going on in his life right then.
[1:51:55] Sometimes you you're going through life
[1:51:56] and maybe you're writing songs, so to
[1:51:58] speak. You're going through some things.
[1:52:00] You're writing songs of woe and despair.
[1:52:02] David did that at times, but sometimes
[1:52:04] he wrote songs to be sung in a temple
[1:52:06] that he would never stand in. But he
[1:52:08] still wrote them anyway. He still put in
[1:52:10] the work so they would have something to
[1:52:12] sing. Listen, you got a part today for a
[1:52:14] future generation if there is one.
[1:52:16] There's something for you to do. I say
[1:52:18] let's get up and be doing it.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; We're making preparation for something
[1:52:22] as the musicians come. Either we'll go
[1:52:24] by rapture or by the grave. There is no
[1:52:26] third option.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? We'll either go by
[1:52:29] rapture or go by way of the grave. But
[1:52:31] no matter how we go, let's tie it to
[1:52:33] ourselves first.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; So we can leave behind a big pile of
[1:52:38] nails.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:41] said, "My children,
[1:52:43] maybe my grandchildren,
[1:52:46] they could use these."
[1:52:51] [Music]
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; But Harvey, your dad's not here today,
[1:52:55] but he left behind a pile of nails. He
[1:52:57] went to church.
[1:53:00] And when Harvey Senior
[1:53:03] passed away, Brother Harvey testified at
[1:53:06] Sorry, Brother Harvey, but he testified
[1:53:07] at the funeral and said,
[1:53:10] said, "My dad went to church, took his
[1:53:12] family to church, and it made a
[1:53:14] difference in Brother Harvey's
[1:53:15] generation."
[1:53:19] And Brother Harvey that has done things
[1:53:22] here in the church, working when he
[1:53:23] didn't feel like it, doing things.
[1:53:25] Some of these el brother Danny's we
[1:53:27] talked about brother Danny the other day
[1:53:28] but Andrew and it was I couldn't have
[1:53:30] said it better
[1:53:33] and
[1:53:35] these brothers have done something and
[1:53:36] they're not old but but they're older
[1:53:39] than we are some of us younger ones they
[1:53:42] they they've made a piles of nails
[1:53:47] some of you are the result the white
[1:53:48] camp family Hoffman family the result of
[1:53:51] some some nails that were made by people
[1:53:53] in in past generations ations
[1:53:57] people that lived years ago.
[1:54:02] You You're the result of somebody who
[1:54:04] went I think of brother Don Osborne. I
[1:54:08] know Sister Phyllis listens to some of
[1:54:10] our services. Brother Dawn, you know, he
[1:54:12] was a man who he was different. He he
[1:54:14] had a different motive and things in his
[1:54:16] preaching and things. He he was just
[1:54:17] evangelistic, purely evangelistic. But
[1:54:20] there's people sitting here today that
[1:54:22] are part of our church that were a
[1:54:24] result of the dawn going and showing a
[1:54:26] video or doing something. They showed it
[1:54:28] to somebody. Somebody else showed it to
[1:54:30] somebody else. They showed it to
[1:54:31] somebody else. And eventually it got
[1:54:33] down to my generation. And we're putting
[1:54:35] together a building
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; made with nails
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; from a previous generation.
[1:54:42] And thank you for making those nails.
[1:54:45] But if there's another generation, let's
[1:54:46] keep making them. Let's keep making some
[1:54:48] hinges. Let's do for our children what
[1:54:50] was done for us.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; If we can, let's do better. Let's build
[1:54:55] more.
[1:54:58] Let's dig deeper.
[1:55:00] See, we don't just do these things for
[1:55:02] ourselves. We don't make those hard
[1:55:04] choices just for ourselves, but we do it
[1:55:07] for others.
[1:55:09] I thank you for doing that, and I thank
[1:55:11] you for being patient this morning.
[1:55:12] Would you bow your heads together?
[1:55:16] I was so stirred
[1:55:19] Wednesday night or Friday night rather
[1:55:21] when brother
[1:55:23] brother uh Wendle preached.
[1:55:27] [Music]
[1:55:28] So stirred by that message
[1:55:32] cuz brother Windle's done made some hard
[1:55:34] choices and worked very difficult. I'll
[1:55:37] say this because he's not here. He's
[1:55:39] done some
[1:55:41] some very difficult things. toiled in an
[1:55:43] area that's very poor. Preached in a
[1:55:45] place where he doesn't get a lot of a
[1:55:48] lot of gratitude I think for for what he
[1:55:50] does and what he is as a preacher.
[1:55:53] But he did the hard work so his sons and
[1:55:56] those coming on his brothers and
[1:55:58] different ones could go out and be a
[1:56:00] help to the message of the hour.
[1:56:03] He helped me other brothers coming. Then
[1:56:06] brother Daryl Ward that was here. He he
[1:56:07] made some nails.
[1:56:09] I was talking to him this week and I
[1:56:11] reminded him of some things that he had
[1:56:13] done when when he was when he was
[1:56:16] younger and I was much younger and we
[1:56:18] were sitting there at Bransville. We
[1:56:19] were doing we were working. We were
[1:56:21] putting in some work there at Bransville
[1:56:22] and not knowing what we were doing but
[1:56:24] we're preparing something and we're
[1:56:26] putting in some work and brother Daryl
[1:56:27] was willing to come and preach for us
[1:56:29] and to people maybe just a few people
[1:56:31] there but he was willing to come and I
[1:56:33] thanked him for that this week. I said,
[1:56:35] "Brother Daryl, you don't know what you
[1:56:36] did. Listen church, I want to be that
[1:56:38] kind of person. I want to help somebody
[1:56:40] else. Lord, help me not to go through
[1:56:41] life and end up it all bit was about me
[1:56:44] and and what I wanted and what I got
[1:56:45] done. Why don't you just leave that old
[1:56:47] moly grub pit and leave that old pit of
[1:56:50] self-pity and and come on out and do
[1:56:51] something for God and make some nails.
[1:56:53] Get some hinges ready and get ready for
[1:56:56] a rapture. Listen, if you go by way of
[1:56:58] the grave, you say, "Well, I might die
[1:56:59] soon." If you go by way of the grave,
[1:57:01] listen, there will be there will be a pe
[1:57:03] you'll be there first. You get to go
[1:57:05] first. The dead in Christ will rise
[1:57:06] first, and we which are alive and remain
[1:57:08] will be caught up together with them to
[1:57:10] meet our Lord in the air. You're going
[1:57:11] to see me on tomorrow morning. Amen.
[1:57:15] Hallelujah. Don't give up now. Leave
[1:57:18] behind a big pile of nails so somebody
[1:57:21] else can put it together. Heavenly
[1:57:23] Father,
[1:57:24] oh Lord Jesus, may we continue to build
[1:57:28] Lord in our lives, in our preaching, in
[1:57:30] everything that we do, not to tear down,
[1:57:32] but to edify. I pray you'd grant it,
[1:57:34] Lord God. Lord, I pray that that would
[1:57:37] be the Lord, the the the focus of this
[1:57:39] church, Lord. And I I thank you for what
[1:57:41] you've done through this body of
[1:57:43] believers. So, we're not huge, but Lord,
[1:57:46] we we've got people that are willing to
[1:57:48] put their hands to the to the shovel.
[1:57:49] And Lord, they're willing to work and do
[1:57:51] the little things that need to be done,
[1:57:53] Lord, to be a blessing to somebody else.
[1:57:56] I thank you for that, Lord. I pray you'd
[1:57:58] increase our willingness, oh God. Lord,
[1:58:01] I pray that you'd move in us. was hard
[1:58:03] sometimes. Sometimes physically, even in
[1:58:05] our bodies, we'd pay a price for the
[1:58:07] work that we put in. But Lord, we know
[1:58:10] that we could never you you'll never owe
[1:58:13] us anything cuz we could never work that
[1:58:15] we won't be repaid. We will never put
[1:58:18] anything in that won't be returned. You
[1:58:20] said cast your bread upon the water and
[1:58:22] after many days it will return again. I
[1:58:26] pray it would be so, Lord. Oh, I pray
[1:58:28] that you'd help us. Put a a sinceress in
[1:58:30] our heart, Lord, a worship within us. We
[1:58:33] can know, Lord, what you want for us and
[1:58:35] from us in this hour that we live in. I
[1:58:37] pray you'd grant it. We thank you for it
[1:58:39] in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:44] Thank you, Lord. If you need something
[1:58:45] from the Lord, be glad to pray with you
[1:58:46] this morning. Let's just worship him
[1:58:48] together. Can we have a time of worship?
