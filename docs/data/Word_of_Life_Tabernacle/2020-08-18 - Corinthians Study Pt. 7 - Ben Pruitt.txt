TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign you welcome to our study on first corinthians today um we're on part seven and we're going to go from there i'll give you just a minute while we kind of go over what we looked at last time and it's been a couple of weeks since we've done this and just bear with us we'll do this as we can from time to time i try to do it every week on tuesdays around noon or 12 30 today starting at 12 30 and i will give you just a minute to join if you want to watch live and then you can watch later of course on youtube or facebook and these are usually about 20 minutes long but uh we don't really put a time limit on it but that's usually what it comes out to and today we'll go through nine verses but i want to go over a little bit of what we talked about last time in chapter two of first corinthians we talked about how paul preached the hidden things of god and so he said i come to you not with excellency of speech or of wisdom so he's saying i didn't come with the wisdom of the world but i did preach to you hidden things i did preach to you things that you would need to know that you do know uh that are the mysteries of the gospel the good things of the gospel i i preached to you those things but i did not come to you i did not present it in a worldly manner it did not present it according to the manner of men but it did preach the hidden things of god and he taught us that those hidden things are revealed only by the spirit of god those hidden things are not revealed by me just sitting down and teaching you something but it's by the spirit of god it takes the spirit of god because what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of a man paul says what things knows the things of what man knows the things of god except the spirit of god and so he said the spirit reveals these things to us and he taught us that we should compare spiritual things together we should compare not scripture with the world not our ideas with scripture but scripture with scripture compare spiritual things with spiritual not with worldly wisdom but not the way people think in the world but according to the scripture according to the word of god and then he taught us that we have the mind of christ and what a comfort that is to know that we it's not up to us to try to figure these things out but we have the mind of christ as the bride of christ to know what he wants done with the word and how to put into action how to live the word and that's the important thing is how do we live the word it's not so much what we say but what are we going to do what are we going to do with the message that we've been given and i think that's a challenge to us today what are we going to do with it we have it we have the spirit we have the word we have all these things but what are we going to do with it how are we going to put it into action and so brother branham says something to the effect of that when he says don't jump any higher than you can live so let's go into first corinthians chapter three and paul really gets down where they live and and to the root problems root causes of the problems that they're having in corinthians and so chapter three is a very important chapter in the in the book of first corinthians i'm sure you've heard it preached on many times but let's get into it verse 1 says and i brethren let's stop for a moment i'm going to go ahead and pray i want to do that before i get into the word i forgot that let's pray heavenly father we thank you for letting us come together once again i ask you lord to uh come and and just speak to us through your word today and those that would listen i pray that they would be blessed and those who would listen later i pray that they would be blessed as well we ask in jesus name amen all right let's go out kind of a little antsy today to get into this first corinthians chapter 3 and verse 1 and thy brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ so paul identifies two different types of people one on that next slide is spiritual and spiritual people if you underline that in your bibles as i'm doing spiritual people are people and one of the definitions of that and there's a whole list of definitions but one was one who is filled with and governed by the spirit of god i like that a spiritual person is one who is filled with and governed by the spirit of god it's someone who thinks spiritually who acts spiritually that's the greek word for spiritual and then he contrasts that with carnal so he says i could not speak unto you as if you were spiritual governed by the spirit of god filled with the spirit of god he said but i had to speak unto you as if you were carnal and now they were believers as we found out they were saints sanctified ones they but they were not walking by the spirit of god they were babies in christ instead of being grown uh adults and then being governed by the spirit and so we see that there's an increase as we live and as we go and as as we become mature in christ there should be an increase in the power of the spirit in our lives and the manner in which we're governed by the spirit if we remain in a place where we're believers but our lives are not governed by the spirit of god and are not governed by the word of god there's a problem we're stunned and so he says carnal then would be the opposite of that so he sets that as a contrast spiritual and carnal and to be carnal is to be governed by mere human nature and not by the spirit of god so we want to be spiritual not carnal so paul says i could not speak unto you as as in the spiritual but as the carnal now that next slide in hearing receiving and acting on hearing receiving and acting brother preaches that sermon in 1960 and he deals with the difference between esau and jacob and he types one as a carnal believer and the other is spiritual believer and i want you to recognize that even as a spiritual believer born again of the spirit of god if we were born again of the spirit of god we have to walk by the spirit of god and there are times when a born-again believer will act like a carnal believer and there's times when a carnal believer will do certain things that may maybe a spiritual believer would do but if you look at it through the entirety of what what it is that they do and who they are you'll see one's a carnal believer another is a spiritual believer so brother branham says we find out in every revival that's ever been born in the world it produces twins he said every revival has twins they have a bunch in there that's carnal believers and a bunch of spiritual believers he said every revival produces that an esau and a jacob and as they go along he said first thing you know the colonel begins to think well these guys are getting off the deep end he said i better separate myself from them he said they go back to the intellectual part and why is that because that's how they were born that's who they are they're carnal believers so they go back to the intellectual part and brother madam then identifies a carnal believer as this and i think it'd be good for us while we're studying this to remember this he said they want a pastor that will speak to them of pleasant things they don't want that spirit-filled pastor that will obey the holy spirit from the platform just preach the word just like it is and so you identify a carnal believer or a spiritual believer based on the type of ministry that they want and that they feed from they don't want a pastor that'll speak to them the things of the lord and just preach the word like it is they want someone who'll speak to them of pleasant things and so we want to be spiritual believers today so again brother branham says in that same sermon he said as john said lay the axe to the root of the tree let the chips fall where it will he said most of the churches today will vote that out of their pulpit that's right it'll come a separation always does that it did it in the methodist age it did it in the bamboo stage it did it in the pentecostal age it'll do it in every age and so if it does it in every age it'll do it in our age that there will be a separation based on what people want to hear and i pray that we would always want to hear the word that's what we want regardless of how that word is presented or how it looks to us we want to hear the word of god and nothing else so in verse 2 he says i fed you with milk and notice he says i have fed you with milk and he uses the same language when he says i came to you when i came to you i came not with excellency of speech he says i have fed you with milk so he says i was there with you for a year and a half and i while i was there with you i fed you with milk i didn't give you any meat because he says hitherto you were not able to bear it but he says now there's a problem because it's one thing when you're new brand new in the gospel and you're not able to bear the meat he says but now you're supposed to be grown you've been down this road a few years it's been a while since i left you and he says you're still not able to bear it and you're lifted up you've heard great ministries you've had apollos and peter and and you've been influenced by all of these ministries you've had he was paul himself was their pastor for a year and a half but he said i fed you with milk i couldn't give you meat because you're not able to bear it it would have offended you and jesus said blessed is he was not offended in me he said neither yet now are you able what an indictment that is he said you haven't grown at all remember these are christians he said but you haven't grown you still want the milk in trying to do god of service without it being god's will brother branham speaks of that text that he's taking about david and how he made the difference between david and and and all the how what he should have done how he should have done things according to the word and consulted the prophet yet he had all uh the people excited and was a great revival but god wasn't in it and an innocent man died because of it and brother branham speaks of that he said now notice this it's a very treacherous text if you don't get it right he said and i feel that the hour is coming where we should be men instead of babies he said we should have strong meat instead of milk i would challenge us today in our church and that's what i'm speaking to today if you're listening today and you go to word of life tabernacle let's eat the meat of god's word let's not be offended because well we don't like the way it was said no we want to eat the meat we want what god we want something that'll put a reality in our lives of the that'll bring strength to our lives we can be mature christians we're too far down the road to still be drinking milk all the time we want the meat of god's word and if we're going to have the meat of god's word we're going to have to begin to put these things into actions not that we're not but we need to increase in that we need to grow up and i think in the message we have that you know and among us there's a vision believers there's corinthian believers i want to be an efficient believer i want to be one who can accept the meat and yet stays with it because we know we want another ephesian it's not another corinthians first corinthians 3 and verse 3 says for ye are yet carnal now he's going to show them why he's saying he's called them babies and it's a big deal to call someone a baby i i know my kids never wanted to be called babies after they got a little bit bigger i'm not a baby well he says here's why here's why i called you a baby he said for year yet carnal fleshly if he said for whereas there's among you envying and strife and divisions those three things envying strife and divisions are you not carnal and walk as men or walk like the world walks there's among you envying strife and divisions i like what adam clarke said about this he said there's three things worthy of note these people were wrong in thought word and deed envying refers to the state of their souls they had inward grudgings and disaffection toward each other envying and and that's also the word is emulations that's the same word for emulations you find that in galatians and and i've talked to you before how brother branham talked about that that emulations was competition one with another especially among the ministry so and that's a problem today we're not in competition with each other we're in competition with the devil and that's the way we should keep it but they had envying which was inward grudgings and disaffection towards each other strife or contention now so the first thing is is thought and envy or an emulation the second thing is is a word or strife what they talked about he says strife refers to their words they were continually disputing and contending whose party was the best each one endeavoring to prove that he and his party were alone in the right that sounds familiar doesn't it divisions refers to their conduct so it manifested itself in their thoughts their words and their deeds divisions refers to conduct they could not agree they contended till they separated from each other and thus rent or tore the church of christ they tore it up they tore it apart thus the envying and grudging led to strife and evil speaking and this led to divisions and fixed parties and paul continues to explain to them why they why he was saying they were carnal and they were babies he says for while one saith i am with paul notice one says i'm of paul or i listen to paul i lean on paul paul's teachings another says i'm of apollos i lean on apollos's teachings he says are you not carnal now again you say well what's wrong with being of paul well paul even includes christ in this he said there was a party of christ that said i don't listen to any man i just listen to christ well the fact that they made that an issue means that it was wrong and the because god has men so there was a party of christ but there was a party of paul but paul is identifying that party is wrong too it's not just the party of apollos which was the major problem that he deals with in the book of ephesians but it's also the party of peter and the party of paul those are wrong too these are all men of god but what's wrong is the people who say i identify with that man that's the man that's going to make get me through i know if i listen to that man and i follow that man that that that's what's going to get me through no it's not what's going to get you through is if you believe the word if you hear and you act you recognize you act on the word of god and you are the bride of christ you're the seed germ of god from the beginning that's what gets you through not because of who you listen to on a regular basis so he says are you not carnal who then is paul who is apollos he says but ministers and that word in that day would have been understood as a servant we'll get to that in a moment he said ministers by whom you believed another word for it might be messengers who's paul who's apollos they carried a message by whom he believed even he said as the lord gave to every man that word ministers again is diaconos which is the same word used for a deacon and he's not saying that the office of a minister in the office of a deacon is the same thing but he's saying that they have a similarity in in this that they're servants they serve the people they're not served by the people they're cert they serve the people and so he says that word is one who executes the commands of another it's a master a servant or other master a servant an attendant of a master a minister if you go into old government theory if you've ever studied old old world governments they had kings and then they would have ministers and the ministers in many cases might be smarter and than the king and they might be more able but they had to carry out the commands of the king and and the person that got the glory was the king not the minister and so in some cases you had kings who were considered bad in history and kings who were considered good the only difference was the ability of their ministers but the king gets all the credit so he says you're like a you're like a minister a servant the servant of a king like a deacon someone who who serves food and drink a waiter you're carrying a message you're responsible to somebody but you don't get the glory for it there's a wonderful story that jesus tells a parable in luke chapter 17 and i won't read all of it because we're studying here on corinthians but go back and read it if you get the time and luke tells this story of how that he said you know he talks or jesus tells it and luke relates it to us how that these men if you're a master and the disciples would have understood this if you're a master and you have servants if your servant gets done in the field and he's out there plowing and does all these things all day you don't say oh okay go go sit down in the house and i'll i'll fix you dinner you don't do that he's a servant so when he gets done what happens you say fix me dinner why because he's still a servant when he gets done the field belongs to the master the the what he sowed the seed that he sowed belongs to the master the increase belongs to the master he said when when you get done there's just more work to do there's not a a a reward in this life for the things that you do and so when he gets the end of that story jesus says so likewise ye when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we've done that which was our duty to do that's what we are as ministers we've done our duty if we do everything you know you know he said a dispute paul says a dispensation of the gospels committed to me we're stewards of the mysteries of god we should understand it that way it doesn't give us a right to form clicks and clubs and feel like we have a a right to live differently or uh not be exposed to the things that the people are exposed to no we we have the same requirements and more so because we represent a king brother branham speaks of this and he says in the message influence and i'm going through this slowly because it's very important it's very important to us today brother brown says we all know of men in the field today great men he says some of them gets to a spot till after they get their congregation all around them they feel so secure until they think they can even sin and get by with it and brother branham is speaking i believe he tells this a different way several times when he preaches on influence and i think he's speaking of a well-known evangelist of that time who had a drinking problem a healing evangelist and because he talks about it in different places and you get that idea but he says they think they can even ascend and get by with it he said we've been knowing of ministers taking the wrong road he said and many times that's because they feel secure security can be a danger in the ministry and it can be a danger to us to those who are in the laity what happens is you become secure because i'm a paul i'm off apollos i'm of christ you're secure in your party when you should have security in christ so it matters what you're secure in security is a great thing but don't feel secure because you have your congregation around you don't feel secure because everybody tells you you're doing the right thing because usually when everybody tells you you're doing the right thing it might be the wrong thing now he says they think they can even sin and get by with it he said we've been knowing of ministers taking the wrong road he said many times that's because they feel secured that all the people will let me get by with anything he says the people might my brother but god won't see you're going to answer to god he said you must never try as a minister to try to deceive the ears of your congregation regardless of how much they can scream or shout or carry on or pat you on the back and say the message is wonderful and i won't lie i like to hear that i love to hear that you know that was good it spoke to me but that doesn't help me any you understand it it helps me feel better but what really helps is knowing and seeing people receive the word of god and actually benefit from it but people pat you on the back many times for the wrong reasons he said regardless how much they would scream or shout or carry on or pat you on the back and say the message is wonderful he said you must be a servant to christ paul says who who are paul who is paul who is apollos but ministers servants and brother biola says you must be a servant to christ to stay honorable with that word because that word will reflect itself through you and you're going to influence somebody that's watching your life he said young people likewise businessmen the same way so each of us have a responsibility because of those that we influence one more quote on this we'll move on brother branham talks about how that and i'm running out of time brother brown talks about in the seventh seal how he had the vision of a little baby shoe and and the first pole in the second pull of fishing he's fishing and he talks about the first poll and he says when you do the fish will run after the lure he said and then watch your second pole it'll only be small fish and then the third pole will get it and then on that next slide and the seven seal he says a voice come and said you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things i think i skipped down one but he's talking about how that he always gets involved with a bunch of preachers and these preachers actually pat him on the back and say and if you go back a couple of slides you can go back to that first slide in the seventh seal and or that second slide i skipped that second slide he says all the ministers that's 292. all the ministers got around me said brother branham we know you can do it you think that'd be a good thing but brother adam never said his problems come from people telling him he couldn't do it but from people telling him he could he says all the ministers got around me and said brother branham we know you can do it hallelujah brother branham he said that's where i always get tied up with a bunch of preachers he had cheerleaders we don't need cheerleaders we need people to speak the truth he said i always get tied up with a bunch of preachers see i love people they want you to explain everything this that and then he later on says a voice come and said you can't teach pentecostal babies supernatural things these were not mature christians so they couldn't receive the third pull paul says i couldn't give you meat because you couldn't see that i was just a servant you couldn't see that apollos was just a servant you wanted to lift these men up it's wrong whether it happened in paul's day or today first corinthians 3 and 6 i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase it's not mine it's god so then neither is he that planteth anything verse 7 neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase he says now he that planets and he that watereth are one they're one they they work for the same master he says and every man should receive his own reward according to his own labor so we are one but we receive our own reward there is a reward for service he says for we are laborers together with god and so he's saying that all the gifts are from god but each man will be rewarded for his own efforts and we'll get into that more when we get to the next teaching on this he says for we are laborers together with god i love the way paul puts this he says ye are god's husbandry you're god's building what does that mean it means that both the materials that we use to build and the finished product are gods the emphasis in the original greek is on god it says we are laborers together with god he says you are god's husbandry you are god's building they're you're not mine it's not my church it's not someone else's church where laborers together should respect one another we're laborers together with god he didn't say that you could only respect those with a large congregation your laborers together with god your god's husbandry your god's building both the materials and the finished product are gods and yet each one of us as ministers will be held accountable for how we used those materials you think the same way about your family and about the people that you influence in your life you're laborers together with god in that effort your family belongs to god the people that you have influence over in your life but they belong to god but you're a laborer together with god to get the glory for god both the materials and the finished work is god's and this is the way the cambridge uh commentary puts it he said the apostles that last slide the apostle now gives the argument another turn from man's point of view the preachers of the gospel are mere instruments in god's hands not so from god's he regards them as responsible so we're responsible to him but to the people we're just instruments in god's hands we're responsible he regards them as responsible beings responsible to him for the work they do but the results are still gods and gods alone the ministers of christ may be fellow laborers with god but the husbandry the building are gods and not theirs the responsibility is still there but when we all get completely done with all the work that we have to do in life he says you're unprofitable servants you've done what you were commanded to do go and finish the work i want to really if you're watching and following along with this go and read chapter three of first corinthians and especially the next verses it's very important what we do and especially those of us involved in the ministry it matters matters how we treat people it matters how we treat one another and it matters what we're building with the material is god's the building is god's the glory is god's but there will be a reward for our service on the other side i'm thankful for that let's pray heavenly father thank you for all that you've done for us today i pray the word would just be sewn into our hearts lord and you see lord that i'm an imperfect servant i'm not doing this to gain notoriety but lord i i just want to help our church in any way that i can and i pray god that you'd move and speak to each one if there's one that's sick or in need or has a need today i pray that you would meet that need we ask it in jesus name amen god
