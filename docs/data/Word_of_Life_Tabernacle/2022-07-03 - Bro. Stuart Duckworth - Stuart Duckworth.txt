love the Lord this morning if we could just turn into Jeremiah the 38th chapter and first verse amen amen amen we love the Lord him in the first verse then the shepher time the son of Madden and get a lie of the son of pasture and Joker the son of shemalai and pursue the son of Mount Makaya heard the words of Jeremiah that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying thus saith the Lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live I mean thus saith the Lord this city shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon's army which shall take it and therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for he thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remaineth in this city in the hands of all the people and and speaking such words unto them for this man's seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt and then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do anything against you what a king that would be I mean he can't help you out a little bit amen amen then took they Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malachi the son of Hamlet that was in the court of the prison and they let down Jeremiah the chords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so Jeremiah sunk in the Meyer what a what a condition that this Prophet was in there they're sinking in the mire amen you can be seated this morning Amanda certainly happy to have my family here today and my sister and her family and just appreciated her plan this morning it's been a while since I got to here you know I I taught her everything she knows and so it's good to hear it every now and then hey man just happy to have each and every one here today it's been a while since we preached and just a little nervous probably running on adrenaline this morning you know the wife's running on adrenaline didn't get much sleep so but we're here anyways amen hey man we're just going to enjoy the presence of the Lord today amen Jeremiah is known as the weeping prophet amen he we because men would not receive the word of God and turned aside the revelation and then he wept because the people of that day they held to their Traditions amen they held to their traditions and their own ideas and the people the people thought that they were okay and you imagine being a prophet and just amen being able to see the condition and be in that voice and and dealing with the people that just thought they were okay you couldn't they he couldn't get him to move and and that's why he was the weeping prophet he's seen the condition of the people in the land of that day and because they would not turn from their wrong they would have to reap what they had sown and and that's for anybody amen if you want if you won't repent for what you're doing you you will have to pay for that amen but if you can repent God will turn his wrath Amen in a situation will be changed I mean if you can change what you're doing if a nation could change what they're doing amen God God will turn his hand amen there's Mercy amen there's mercy and Grace if you'll turn from those things and the Bible says that the Holy Spirit Will seal those in their forehead who sigh and cry for the Abominations done in the land and you can look and see how sinful things have gotten people have gotten so hardened against anything and everything that has anything to do with God or the truth they just don't want to hear it amen they're so corrupted morally and in their minds and everything and even in the church people will go on hearing the word but never truly let it take effect in their hearts they they become so hardened remember we as a people of God we we ought to look upon the land and see the things that are going on and amen amen the Bible says the Holy Spirit Will seal those that sign cry those those that see the condition they see the need and and they want to help they they want to intervene they want to pray they want to try to do all they can be because they see the coming destruction amen amen friends and loved ones that have turned aside from from God in the Revelation that we so cherish amen amen those that have left the word because of an unbelieving spirit and you know when we get to a place you you wonder why you even would waste your time why you know you know what's what why what's it worth amen what's it worth the energy even trying to just say anything or do anything or try to persuade I mean what's the use and even trying but I say there's a use this morning and man don't give up amen amen those that have gone on Amen keep praying keep sighing and crying this is Jeremiah the prophet amen he didn't give up amen he was ordained the prophet amen and worthy ordained people of God in the shower amen amen continue Amen to sign cry brother random says in forsaking all he said but then I look down through there and I see a little light here and there consecrated Christian praying all all they that sigh and cry for the Abomination that's dead in the midst of the city the angel was commissioned to put a seal upon them mark them and they was the one who that they who could not be destroyed and I pray father that there will be many be a consecrated Christian so concerned amen not afraid to call out against evil amen God in this day let's speak the right things right amen amen amen God's got a people that's concerned in this hour amen we're convinced and then we're convinced of the word we're convinced of the hour we see the condition amen as the bride is the elect of God amen amen Christ through us interceding and when that love of God ought to be in you amen you ought to be concerned amen for those around you amen amen amen God wants the people who will still be alive people who will be consecrated amen people who will Who will live right and do right amen who will be a Voice of Truth in this hour of Falling Away of sin and unbelief I mean this don't sound too encouraging this morning but we're going to try to get to a place of encouragement amen God wants the people who will cry out and not be ashamed they'll not be ashamed amen of of living the word amen they won't they won't cower back they won't be timid I mean they won't be ashamed to speak and speak for Jesus Luke 9 and 26 says who whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed and when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the Holy Angels amen I don't want to be ashamed in this hour amen I don't want to be ashamed of the truth amen amen and if we stand for him he'll stand for us do you believe that this morning I mean if we confess him now he'll confess us before the father father amen and there's an unction this morning available to you and I there's an unction I mean there's a holy ghost available to you and I there's an anointing I mean it'll take away that timidness it'll take away that fear it'll take that away that which would make you scared or try to try to cower back amen take away that part of you that would be ashamed I mean there's an unction this morning there's a power of God I mean if we'll let him come it'll take away that shame I'm going to set your heart on fire it'll make you a real Christian it'll make you to worry your your voice say man will Echo out the word of God Amen that concern will come through your voice for those around you in this condition of this day hey man he wants to make you a real Christian there's an unction this morning amen it'll help us speak it'll help us live amen that we won't just walk Amen in this earth amen this this turning our head and and just just carrying this for our foreign no more amen but you'll look at someone you'll look at their condition and then you'll look at the ones that that's pulling away and then you'll be concerned for them and then you'll live a life that they can see amen God needs someone in this hour there will be his hands man someone that will be his feet someone that will be his voice amen a thundering voice in this day and brother Branham says he says Oh how we need in Jeffersonville thousands of lit voices to the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness and Holiness and Purity undefiled lives walking around the Earth today without a blemish yes sir real Christians that's a a Thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how much you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this and Shout but it hurts the devil to see that Sanctified life a holy consecrated to God it must say anything to him call him anything and don't move him he's just as sweet as he can be he'll move right on amen amen that's what throws the devil away that's the Thunder that shakes the devil amen that's the kind of life I want to live I'm in a holy consecrated Sanctified life amen amen walking in the sweet sweetness and then an example amen and that's what the world is looking for they're looking for something that's real they're not look the fake will never move them amen the fake will never move them they'll they'll never come to nothing but many times the only Bible the only Bible people will read is your life amen and the way you walk and the way you talk they can tell there's something different about them there's a sweetness there's a humility there's a presence amen when they say something they're different than everybody else I mean that's what we've got to be in this hour I mean it's too late and then to be walking around amen back in a backsin condition and if you're in that condition this morning Shake yourselves Let the Ocean come let the Holy Ghost come let it bring that sweetness that Purity in your life bring it back amen amen amen the devil hates to see that life amen that's what shakes hell and then when you're truly living that life all hell is going to be against you amen but I say this morning if all hell's against me and I'm living that life and all Heavens For Me amen amen all Heavens For Me amen hell is against this truth it's against the teaching that we stand for it's against the life that we're trying to live amen but all Heaven is backing us this morning amen all Heaven is backing us this morning you believe that and then we got to believe that we got to believe that there's a power behind us that there's someone standing behind us that if we won't be ashamed he won't be ashamed of us hey man I'm slobbing around this morning amen but I love it hey man I want to make the devil shake this morning amen and people will hate you for what you stand for I mean they will hate you they will dislike you they will call you all kinds of things and then they'll they'll try to bring you down try to call you this and call you that and because you got long hair because you act different you don't you don't hang out with everybody else I mean they think they think you think you're better than them man but that's not what it is we're not trying to be different for the sake of being different we're being different because something's took place on the inside of us say man amen and Christians have got to stand out in this hour don't try to blend in with everybody else don't try to walk walk with everybody else and then Stand Out be a Christian be different amen and if you stand for him him in the word in his word he will stand for you in this hour amen Jeremiah 1 5. before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou came us forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations I I like Jeremiah there's so many good things and in the book of Jeremiah but you see how how concerned God was with was with life even before he was in the womb amen but what about when there's life in the womb man God's just so concerned about it and then so a prophet a prophet is Born the prophet amen they are are ordained I mean it has been assigned it has been entrusted Amen to be that for a purpose and God will keep that man and watch over him because he has a special purpose amen he will shape him a certain way amen for a certain group of people for a certain age and man when you look at brother Branham and how God spoke to him even as a child and it appeared to him in a whirlwind said don't ever smoke or drink or defile your body in in any such way amen when I when I was a kid there wasn't no voice that said that there wasn't no whirlwind and I believe I have a purpose but a prophet has such a special purpose God Is So set them apart Amen to bring the word to bring the mind of God to you and I that away when when the mind of God comes amen and we can see these things and we can believe these things then we can become we can become that voice we can become that voice to the young people and said don't I'm telling you don't smoke or drink don't defile your body don't get caught up with the world Amen we don't have no Whirlwind coming to us and then but there's a voice here in this hour there's a voice of the Bride speaking amen don't don't defile yourself you've got a purpose in this hour amen told him not to smoke a drink or defile and such his body in any such way for there will be a work for him to do Amen to bring a message Amen to bring a message for you and I Amen to call abroad amen and even though we we didn't have that type of voice amen we have still been ordained to live for him in this hour and make no mistake the bride has a voice in this hour she's got a Ministry amen that she will be the final voice to the final age a voice Blue Devil she's got a voice in this hour she's been ordained amen and God will have the last say through their bride in this hour do you believe that under her messenger she will be that final voice to the final age brother Alan you might have to get up here about to lose my voice buddy you love the Lord amen so all life has a purpose amen and God is the author of all life and he is able to take care of any amount of human beings that would be on the earth and you hear that argument well we need abortion there's too many people why why would you try to play God why would you try to step in that position amen that's what they try to do they try to play God they try to control these things amen amen but here's the author of life amen and I say that God is a just God Amen he can make a way when there is no way amen and I can't understand why why things the way they are and why life is so hard for for some folks why it's so hard amen but I believe it's mercy and his grace abounds amen he's a just God Amen life is hard for so many amen but no one has a right to choose who lives and who has a purpose and who doesn't amen because God is able to take care amen he's able to come amen and speak amen and it's many times those in a lowly condition you say look at the poverty look look at the condition it's in that condition that God comes down and he speaks to somebody and he raises him up amen amen so all life matters all life has a purpose amen no one has a right to choose I mean in poverty and wealth if you are in his economy amen you are his amen and if you have any kind of purpose God will speak to you God will speak to that person amen maybe they don't believe what you and I believe maybe they're not Broad and then but God's got a purpose for every every individual if they'll answer that call God will call call to them amen yes God will speak to you amen but I I think we ought to be thankful in this hour that he's called us I mean he's called and Us in this hour to be his bride aren't you thanks for the for that amen we have been ordained and entrusted amen Heirs of Salvation and been called to receive and believe the most glorious gospel and message that's ever struck the Earth amen I want to continue to say that all all life has a purpose every life has a purpose amen and it's not for us amen because we are the bride and and we know what we know it's not for us to say well this person has has tried and failed and tried and failed and they've been in and out and in and out who are we to deny life to someone remember we as the bride amen we are to give life we are to bring forth's life amen amen and no matter how much somebody's tried and failed amen we cannot deny if we are the bride if we if we truly believe what we have received amen we are to give out love and not deny amen that someone would have a purpose that someone would have another chance amen Jeremiah 2 and 11. hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no Gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit Jeremiah here prophesying to to Israel be astonish though he Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith the Lord for my people have committed two evils they're forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and I've hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water and brother Brown says here in the message broken cisterns and we look at Israel as an example that God was he always has to remain the same there's only one thing that God ever did and that was his provided way honor his provided way for the people and they got and they got out of that way then God was Dishonored and God made the people suffer for getting away from what he had told him to do no matter what it was he gave them a law touched our handle not taste not and he said just not because the evil of doing it but the evil of disobeying what he said to do you think well why does why does God not want me to do this why does he want me to do this amen it doesn't matter so much of that but God wants obedience from his children he wants somebody that will obey his word no matter how little it is or how big it is amen give up that little thing this morning give up that big thing obey the word and see the blessing of God see God come upon the scene but if you want if you're not willing to give that up if you're if you're going to continue to disobey God won't be in that obedience is better than sacrifice amen we we serve him we don't serve him out of fear but we serve him out of love amen amen we serve him because amen because we we honor and serve him because we love him amen and remember full obedience to the word and this hour entitles you to the Token it entitles you to God's provided way for this hour amen so they had forsaken him the Fountain of Living Waters God's provided way that was God's provided away it wasn't it wasn't that old man-made system but it was the living water and they had gotten away from that and hewed him out a man-made sister and a broken sister and brother Brown describes these cisterns and we'll go through this he says this cistern would fill up with rain water and all the trash from the Barns and the stables and every little bit of dirt from the streets and the alleys and everything Eamon would run off when the rain would come and it would fill up these cisterns and this is what the people were partaking of amen so in these sisters they would use a rag for a filter to try to catch and catch the bugs and the scum and but he said brother Brown said but some of the bug juice would still find its way in the bottom I mean I was riding down the road listening to this message I was I was sitting there eating me some chili cheese tots and and a racist blast listening to that and I was eating and I got sick of my stomach listening to describe this I had to I had to turn turn it off for a little bit so I can finish my my chili cheese ties but think of how how awful it would be to draw a drink to draw a drink from that how sick it would it would it should make you feel how sick it would make you feel he said and then in a few days of the water standing it would become stagnated and then there would be snakes and frogs and wiggle tails and these cisterns he said these systems would go dry and would be in the bottom would be mud and muck and dirt from the rain and the runoff of the water and brother Branham says here he says and that's a whole lot like the churches today I think we have left one of the great sins that the church has done just like Israel has left him the Fountain of Living Water and has chewed him out man-made cisterns and they become the habitation of everything that loves that kind of water lizards and frogs and all kinds of unclean germs live in it because it's a man-made tank and in this tank things stand it's a perfect example of our denominations this day and he said that's exactly what the people does today they refuse the word to take a denominational system because in that what they can do and what they they want to get by with it these denominational system will just let you get by with whatever he said but you can't do that in Christ you've got to come clean and clear in order to be in Christ amen Christ is that Fountain of Living Water amen amen that old that old system lets you left that old world that you left him and that that was that old stagnant water remember to come to Christ you've got to leave that old water pot you've got to leave that old that old system so anything goes in these systems and amen and there's just they're just to me there wouldn't be a good enough filter Amen to collect all that trash you might you might get part of it amen but there's there's not enough filter in that and that's how a denominational man-made system is anything goes I mean you see that in the hour that we live in they don't have the filter of the word amen to filter out I mean the things that would go across the pulpit and that that if it's not preaching the pulpit the people will just go on and there's no voice there there's no filter there and then to say that's wrong or this is wrong or this is right there's no filter of the word of the hour to do that so there's all kinds of trash that flows in the head amen it's not God's provided way amen without without the filter of the word or allow the things of the world to come in and defile make the church sick leaving the Artesian well for a man-made system could you imagine someone doing that could you imagine the mental condition he says of a person that would drink a fresh or teasing well and would leave that for a man-made sisters with frogs and lizards and wiggle tails and everything in him let's lock you and I here today amen how could we leave this water how could we leave this living Fountain and go back we can't do it you can't do it you can't go back and and draw from some man's ID in this hour and then we we've we've received the intelligence of God we we've received the mind of the hour the headship has came the mind of God is here among the people how could we go back and take anybody else's idea about it you can't do it you can't do it in this hour amen until to partake of that filth that has come into the nominal church amen could you just imagine leaving this water so what is the Fountain of Living Water brother Brown says it's an Artesian well it's a well that comes from beneath and it pushes the water out it's flowing all the time it's self-supporting it's always fresh and clean and Artesian well a Fountain of Living Water he said it's not dead and stagnated but it's living it's constantly changing bringing up something new all the time that's moving on coming from its resources and in this watering and it's self-cleansing it'll clean from the inside I mean it won't make you sick it's clean it's pure it's a clean water it's self-supporting I mean you don't have to wait for the rains to fill this tank because it's always bubbling and it gives us water free and then you don't have to pay for it it comes up for nothing amen and all you had to do this morning all you had to do is partake it don't cost you nothing it's free for the Church of God it's a living water it'll make you pure it'll make it clean it'll wash you out amen you you can be black smutty with sin amen but it'll wash you out this morning it'll clean your system out and I'll about imagine that other water clean your system out too you got a drink of it but that's not what we want what we want we don't want it to feel bad we don't want it to make us sick this water make you feel better I can be going throughout the day and not feeling good and think you know I hadn't drank no water I needed I've been drinking these Coke Zeros or this and that or whatever I got Coke Zero is going to help me if I'm drinking or eating free chili not uh chili whatever chili tots and Reese's blast and Coke Zero ain't gonna do me no good is it but you get to feeling bad you get to feeling down and I'll go back in my cooler and I'll give me a bottle of water and by the time you got how about half that that water down you start to feel better you start to you can think clear you can think think better you feel better you're not down and out hey man that water's got in your system amen I didn't go to the ditch amen out there and get me a scoop of water that'd make me sick but I got me a clean bottle of water amen something that's clean something that'll that'll go through my system and rejuvenate amen amen and bring me nourishment in my body hey man if you'll take a drink this morning if you'll just come down if you'll just come down and get your good old scoop this morning amen out of that Artesian well amen how about I believe it'll make us feel better hey man I believe it'll make us have more faith amen it'll help us love better amen we won't we won't be so down and out all the time amen amen it'll bring joy in your soul amen amen to drink from that fountain it's free this morning amen do you love the Lord amen it's always bubbling brother Brown said it's always bubbling it's always pushing forth and that old sister and he said to get a drink of water you have to crank and pump and crank and pump it's a crank and pump and try to get you a little drink from that old nasty water hey man but this is a Fountain of Living Water you ain't got to do nothing for it hey man it's just sitting there it's just waiting him and it's pushing up it's bubbling for the church this morning amen it gives it out freely brother Brown said it don't need no filter no strain or no pumping no jerking no nothing else he said it's just there bubbling up it means you don't have to pump up a Revival you don't have to pump up for nothing the only thing you have to do is just come to the Fountain it's always full of good fresh water and there's there's no end to it it just keeps going on bubbling amen there's no waiting on the next rain and I feel bad for these Farmers waiting on a rain for their crops remember there's no waiting on the rain just to get you a drink I mean there's no waiting on the next Revival the next next big preacher come through and I'm looking forward to our meetings I'm not I'm not trying to bring nobody down I believe we're going to have a good time in the Lord amen I I believe the people of God Amen need a fresh Revival a fresh anointing amen but we can have a Revival this morning amen you can have a Revival you just gotta let it bubble over in your soul and then you got to let it bubble over amen and into every part of your life amen we don't have to wait this morning amen there's a Revival here today amen we've got a source we've got a fountain church and then we've got a place so we can go and then we got a place so we we can become the source amen the source is within us the Revival is within us and it's springing up a Revival in our souls amen you love the Lord amen I certainly love him don't leave the source amen don't leave don't forsake the fountain that's what Jeremiah Was prophesying and then you you've done two evils you you've forsaken the Fountain of Living Waters and you've heard you out sister don't forsake Him this morning don't forsake that Revival don't forsake that fresh drink a Pentecostal water amen if you have forsaken it this morning if you're looking for a fountain this morning I know where to find it I know where to find it it's simple I can lead you to it I can tell you how this morning and then for Christ is that rock he's that rock that will bring forth Living Waters amen you ain't got to go to some special church somewhere to fight it you ain't got to go Lose Yourself out in the world somewhere to find it but he's here this morning he's within speaking distance and when The Rock Amen was struck on Calvary that rock was struck on Calvary to bring forth Living Waters and now all you had to do is speak to the Rock Amen this morning he's within speaking distance if you got a need I mean if you've left a thousand if you've forsaken the fountain speak to the rock this morning and he'll come give you a drink we know where he's at we know where he's at we're not lost the children of Israel and the journey even that rock was always with them amen when they got to con and murmuring and complaining and when they didn't have to do that all they had to do was speak to the Rock he's here this morning he's a he's a living well amen our original text Jeremiah had told him the word of the Lord if you're going to stay in the city you're going to die by the sword by the famine by the pestilence but if you go forth to the Chaldeans you will live and in the city he said the city is going to be taken it's going to be destroyed he he was that voice to try to tell the people amen he was that weeping prophet he was he was out the one that was sighing and crying he was the one that was concerned he was ordained for that amen but they let Jeremiah down and then with cords in the dungeon where there was no water but mire amen as we read so Jeremiah sunk in the mire and that word dungeon it means the same thing as a sister and it means pit it's a cistern so you think about that I was reading these scriptures a few few weeks ago think of that the very thing that Jeremiah Was preaching against that he was trying to tell the people that they've forsaken The Living Waters and and drinking out of this old cistern the very thing that he was preaching against that's what they threw him into and I just thought that was something you know there the prophet had found himself in the very thing that he was preaching against and I I was listening to the someone preach about Jeremiah and the pit just trying to draw a little inspiration from it and you know they they portrayed it as if as it was someone in sin that had gone down and sinned and I guess you could top it like that but I don't believe the prophet was in sin I believe he would he was doing what he was supposed to do and just just so happens that hey man these men had it out for him they hated him so much that they put him down in that pit and sometimes sometimes it is it is what you do why you're in the pit sometimes it's just for whatever reason you get thrown in the pit you had nothing to do with it and this is how it is this is how life sometimes sometimes is or there's piss that we get thrown into and so he they punished him for speaking the word trying trying to help him trying to save him from destruction by putting him into that pit trying to silence that voice and all he did was tell them the truth he was trying to tell them from the coming destruction amen they're and they're sinking into mire in the mud and probably the more that he moved the deeper he got down in the mud hey man down there left to die nothing to eat nothing to drink just watering in the mud waiting on somebody to get him out of there waiting on something to happen Amen in his mind he was probably I would think if I was down there I would think what did I do to deserve this I'm just trying to tell people what's right I'm just trying to go to school and be an example and wear a long hair and wear long dresses and and be an example I'm trying to trying to stand for the message of the hour I'm I'm trying to live for God why why does everybody hate me why what did I do to deserve this he said but you can't look and I'll say this morning you can't look at your symptoms you can't look at what's around you've got to look you've got to look to the god that can deliver amen limitations third chapter in the 53rd verse and perhaps Jeremiah wrote this because of his experience in that dungeon later in Lamentations they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me Waters flowed over my head and then I said I am cut off I called upon the name of the Lord out of the low dungeon and thou has heard my voice hiding out thy ear and my breathing at My Cry thou drew a sneer in that day that I called upon thee and thou set us fear not O Lord thou has pleaded the causes of my soul thou has redeemed my life amen Jeremiah there perhaps in the dungeon there the inspiration striking him amen and maybe he can hear the words of David out of the pit amen out of the monkey tomorrow amen you brought me out and maybe maybe he began to sing amen he brought me out of the Maori clay he set my feet on a rock just stay maybe maybe he began to draw a little inspiration from that amen and that's what that's what the word is there for amen that's what the message is there for amen for us it's your own inspiration in the hour that you and I live in amen if we'll look to it amen amen you could read something two years ago three or four years ago amen but in in this year amen it would be something that would mean something to you amen you you may read it and think nothing about it amen but you can be in a situation and that word will come back to you it'll come back to you in that time of need and perhaps he heard David amen he read what David wrote about that being in the muck in the mire but he said there in Lamentations he said I am cut off cut off amen amen there he was cut off from food and water and then he was cut off from from that well down there he was cut off from a from a cool drink of fresh water and been cut off from the living I mean he would think I've been put in this place to die I mean in there there in in no way in his own strength and ability would he be able to escape amen enable amen enable to be able to rise out of the pit and then to be able to rise out of the pit of your life and and that was our text this morning amen You've Got to Believe it meant to rise out of the pit and then you got to have faith amen and believe that you still have a purpose in this life amen that I'm I'm in this low point I'm in this dark place I'm in this Valley amen but you got to look up this morning you got to believe you got to you got to draw some inspiration from somewhere and believe that she got a purpose believe that she got a purpose believe that your life amen mean something to God and then if God's gonna do something for you amen what are you going to do for God amen if you're sick this morning and God heals you what are you going to do for him amen if you're in a low point of depression amen amen and you want God to deliver you what are you going to do for him amen you he's going to deliver and you're just going to go on your Merry way or you're going to have a testimony are you going to are you going to tell somebody about what God done for you that it would help bring them out amen when you're touched in your body from being sick amen and that God wants you to go forth amen with a testimony to try to help somebody else what are we going to do for God if he helps us today what are you going to do for him tomorrow say ah I don't have a great gift I don't have a great speaking ability I can't play I can't can't sing good but you can be a voice you can you can dedicate your life to him you can consecrate your life to him amen you can you can tell others about him and some of the greatest greatest times of my life I've probably said this before some of the greatest times of my life you think what's up here preaching or doing whatever and I I hardly get away with doing that sometimes but some of the greatest greatest times of my life is just witnessing to somebody such a such a presence comes down seems like when you do that and you just tell somebody about God and perhaps that's that's the first time anybody's ever spoke to him about those things hey man and I just remember this as a young man this this witnessing to people trying to do something you know trying to say something and just always remember this just kind of telling them what God done for you and God will come down on that because that's why he saved you that was the purpose that he saved you that you could tell somebody else and that they they might come to the Lord amen a soul was worth a thousand worlds worth more than a thousand worlds it's worth more than anything you got to believe that you have purpose even in the low amen you got to look to something greater greater than yourself greater greater than Ate Your Own Strength you've got to look to someone hey man we've been ordained in this hour to serve God to believe the message amen and in this hour I mean it's going to take more faith than ever it's going to take more faith than ever to get out of this whole world it's going to take Rapture and Faith it's going to take a faith that that only individuals have had certain individuals have had but there's going to be a multi-membered body upon the earth I mean that's going to have a enough Faith the right kind of Faith they're going to draw inspiration from the word of the hour from from the message of their day they're going to be able to draw look into that and draw inspiration amen daily feeding upon the word of the Lord and they're going to be able to journal inspiration and have enough Faith a group of people not just an individual not just Jesus but the Bride of the Lord Jesus will have enough faith and then to be raptured out of this place of Destruction yeah I believe that's where we're at amen this winding it down here trying to wind it down I'm just enjoying I'm up here slobbing around this morning amen certainly love the lord it's going to take more faith than ever amen maybe you feel cut off this morning and in a little place amen rise out of the pit this morning amen rise out of the pit of your mind amen rise out of that complex of self-pity amen where where you're just only thinking so small you're only thinking about yourself and you get in such a low place in that complex will hinder you so much it'll keep you from serving God that that complex of self-pity that pit of self-pity rise up out of that this morning let go of your fear let the junction of God come in your life let it come and anoint you afresh and that we can live for him amen how many musicians can come we only got one service today and y'all got the short-winded preacher and so enjoy your your time after we're going to worship him maybe just for a little bit here amen do you love the Lord I am in the Low Places sometimes we find ourselves and could be because of what someone else done to us it could be because of the path of life and that there was just a little place you had to be and it could be something that we've done it was the sin that we were living in amen but cry out this morning let your voice be heard as he said there are Lamentations my voice was heard and then if you draw an eye onto the Lord this morning amen he will draw now unto you is what the scripture says him in there in Jeremiah 38. I got a few more pages here than what I thought I got to read this Jeremiah 38 the seventh verse now when Abed Melech the Ethiopian one of the Enochs which was in the King's house heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ebed Malek went forth out of the King's house and spake to the king saying my Lord these men have done evil and all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet amen whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is locked to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city then the king commanded he bit my leg the Ethiopian saying take from his 30 men with thee and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die took them in with him and went to the house of the kingdom of the treasure and took that's old old cast clouds and old rotten rags and they let them down by quarters of the dungeon of Jeremiah and Eben molect the Ethiopians said unto Jeremiah putting out these old cast clouds and rotten Rags under the under your thine arm holds under the courts and Jeremiah did so so they drew Jeremiah up with the cords took him up out of the dungeon and Jeremiah remained in the court out of the prison amen the cross lifted us up he lifted us up amen but be that someone that Christ can work through to lift someone up out of their pit be that someone in this hour amen be his hands be his feet be his voice amen live for him amen I don't know what else to preach this morning and when we we all need help we all need a friend to come our way amen we all needed somebody yeah amen and we got we got to look this morning to somebody higher than us imminent is Jesus going to come off the throne he can't do that he's there interceding for you and I and but he'll send somebody amen you love the Lord let's just stand this morning ibad Malek was probably just a nobody and maybe you feel like a nobody this morning amen but be that someone be that someone that would
