[37:10] Heavenly Father,
[37:12] Lord Jesus, we come before you this
[37:14] morning, Lord, how we always need help
[37:17] from you. We we can't walk without you
[37:20] holding our hand. And we pray, God, that
[37:22] you'd be here this morning to help us,
[37:25] Lord. We know that you promised to be
[37:27] where two or three are gathered
[37:29] together. You said, "I will be in their
[37:31] midst." Lord, so we believe you are here
[37:34] this morning. Help us to recognize you.
[37:36] May we may we take advantage of the fact
[37:39] Lord that you're with us. Lord may the
[37:41] sick be healed. And Lord may those that
[37:44] are Lord weary Lord in the race. May
[37:47] they be comforted today and refreshed.
[37:50] Lord if there's a sinner here this
[37:52] morning I pray they would they would be
[37:53] saved. Come to a a knowledge of your
[37:56] grace. If there's a backslider I pray
[37:58] they would return. Lord if there's a one
[38:01] Lord maybe the devil's attacked them
[38:03] this week. I pray they would gain the
[38:05] victory this morning. Realize that
[38:07] greater is he that is in them than he
[38:09] that is in the world. Pray you'd grant
[38:11] it now. I thank you for your presence
[38:14] today. Thank you for coming and meeting
[38:16] me, Lord, and changing my life. I pray
[38:19] it would be so with every person here
[38:21] this morning, young and old. We thank
[38:23] you for it in Jesus name. Amen. Thank
[38:27] you, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. We're
[38:31] going to
[38:33] uh read this morning from the book of
[38:36] Exodus chapter 3 and verse 1. Exodus
[38:40] chapter 3 and:es 1-6.
[38:44] While you're turning there, I know we're
[38:47] all aware that brother Biscll passed
[38:49] away this week and he has uh been such a
[38:54] uh influence in all of our lives,
[38:56] especially as as ministers. uh since I
[38:59] was a young man. Hearing brother Biscll
[39:01] preach has always been a a pleasure and
[39:04] he took time to talk to you when you met
[39:07] him and things like that. It was always
[39:08] a blessing to me and and uh God used him
[39:12] in our generation and have to say this
[39:14] that the torch has been passed and
[39:17] brother Biscll hadn't preached for a
[39:18] while now. He's gotten older and lived a
[39:21] long life, but torch has passed to a new
[39:23] generation. And and where are the young
[39:26] men that will stand up and you know, I
[39:28] want to do my part. I can't do what
[39:30] brother Biscll did, but I want to do my
[39:32] part in in proclaiming the message of
[39:35] the hour and the gospel of Jesus Christ
[39:37] in the day that I'm living. How many
[39:39] want to do that? I I want to pick up the
[39:41] baton. I want to be serious about the
[39:43] message of the hour and and do what I
[39:46] can do. Uh we pray for the Biscll family
[39:48] and pray the Lord will bless them. This
[39:49] message this morning is inspired by
[39:52] something uh that brother Biscll had a
[39:54] testimony that he had told and also uh
[39:58] brother Stewart mentioned that when he
[40:00] was praying this morning and uh so I
[40:02] appreciated that. I believe we're in the
[40:04] will of the Lord this morning and just
[40:05] believe that the preaching would would
[40:08] uh God would move me out of the way and
[40:10] speak to you today. Exodus 3 and verse 1
[40:14] says, "Now Moses kept the flock of
[40:16] Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of
[40:17] Midian, and he led the flock to the
[40:20] backside of the desert, and came to the
[40:22] mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the
[40:25] angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a
[40:27] flame of fire out of the midst of the
[40:29] bush. And he looked, and behold, the
[40:31] bush burned with fire, and the bush was
[40:34] not consumed." And Moses said, "I will
[40:37] now turn aside and see this great
[40:40] sight." why the bush is not burnt. And
[40:42] when the Lord saw that he turned aside
[40:44] to see, God called unto him out of the
[40:47] midst of the bush and said, Moses,
[40:50] Moses, and he said, Here am I. He said,
[40:53] Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes
[40:56] from off thy feet, for the place whereon
[40:59] thou standest is holy ground. Moreover,
[41:02] he said, I am the God of thy father, the
[41:05] God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
[41:08] the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his
[41:11] face, for he was afraid to look upon
[41:15] God. Pray the Lord would add his
[41:17] blessing to the word. I want to title
[41:18] this this morning every time he comes.
[41:24] Moses had never met God until he met him
[41:27] in the form of the pillar of fire.
[41:30] Though he had been protected all of his
[41:32] life, he had he had made it even as a
[41:35] baby, God had protected him and kept him
[41:38] in the river and and protected him from
[41:41] destruction uh from his enemies and even
[41:44] protected him and in that he didn't uh
[41:47] when he killed a man there in Egypt, he
[41:49] he didn't die for it. He was able to uh
[41:52] to leave and and go in the backside of
[41:54] the desert, he kept him and helped him.
[41:57] And yet Moses had never really met God
[42:00] until he met him in the form of this
[42:02] fire in the bush, which we call the
[42:04] pillar of fire because that's what it's
[42:06] called later uh in the in the scripture
[42:09] that went with uh the tabernacle went
[42:11] that that set over the tabernacle, the
[42:13] pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire.
[42:16] He had heard of Jehovah from a baby. He
[42:19] had been taught about the things of God
[42:21] from a baby. But this was different. And
[42:24] I think all of us have to come to that
[42:26] that moment when it becomes personal to
[42:28] us when uh when we when we see something
[42:31] supernatural and we see something that
[42:34] is more to it than just what uh nature
[42:37] would bring or just what we could
[42:39] understand with our mind. But Moses saw
[42:42] something that was unexplainable. And
[42:43] that something was a pillar of fire
[42:45] burning a fire burning in a bush that he
[42:49] couldn't understand why the bush would
[42:51] not be consumed. So it was not a natural
[42:53] fire but it was a supernatural fire. So
[42:57] this meeting that he had would change
[42:59] the course of his life and alter the
[43:02] course of history. Of course being uh
[43:05] the foundation Moses being the
[43:08] foundation of the law being the
[43:09] foundation of the the Jewish religion
[43:12] also of the Christian religion as we
[43:14] believed on Christ and he come to
[43:17] fulfill the law. And so we know that uh
[43:20] we know that uh that it it had a real
[43:22] difference made a difference in his
[43:24] life. And I'll quote brother Brandon
[43:25] saying this. He said, "Oh, that little
[43:27] sacred place where man can meet God as
[43:30] Moses had on the back side of the
[43:32] desert. I wonder if we really believe
[43:34] today that that same God is present
[43:37] right now. And that if we could act, if
[43:39] we could by faith reach into another
[43:41] dimension, we would see that that same
[43:43] God is here with us. And he's able to do
[43:47] whatever whatever we have need of. He's
[43:49] able to meet that need this morning. How
[43:51] many of you come to church really
[43:52] believing that he's able to meet that
[43:54] need? He's not a God of history. He's
[43:57] not a God of yesterday. He's a God of
[43:59] today. And he cares about my needs. He
[44:01] cares about my family. He cares about
[44:04] the things I'm going through. He cares
[44:06] about everything in my life.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that today? Can we
[44:10] comprehend that he he's not only here,
[44:13] but he cares and he wants to reach out
[44:15] and the only way to access that is by
[44:17] faith.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; And so, brother Brandham tells us after
[44:21] 40 years of good schooling and the
[44:22] highest degrees that he could be given,
[44:24] knowing his position as a deliverer, as
[44:26] a Hebrew, we know he was taught that by
[44:28] his mother who cared for him even in
[44:30] Pharaoh's house. Knew that God had
[44:32] called him for the commission. Yet he
[44:33] knew more about God in five minutes in
[44:35] the presence of that burning bush than
[44:37] all his 40 years of theology taught him.
[44:40] He was in the presence of God. Oh, I
[44:42] tell you what, you can learn about the
[44:44] message. You can learn about the Bible.
[44:46] You can you can be taught these things,
[44:47] but five minutes in the presence of God
[44:50] will do more for you than all the years
[44:52] of theology will ever do. Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; We know that Paul experienced the same
[44:57] thing in Acts chapter nine
[45:01] as he tells the story as Luke tells the
[45:04] story, right? The writer of Acts, he
[45:06] tells the story of Paul as he journeyed,
[45:08] he came near Damascus and suddenly there
[45:11] shined round about him a light from
[45:13] heaven and he fell to the earth and
[45:16] heard a voice saying unto him, Saul,
[45:19] Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he
[45:22] said, "Who art thou, Lord?" Now, what
[45:25] what was it that caused Paul to identify
[45:29] this light and this voice as the Lord?
[45:33] Right? He he as a Jew, he would
[45:34] understand the import of that. This was
[45:36] God,
[45:38] &gt;&gt; right? It was God appearing in the form
[45:40] of a pillar of fire. What what would
[45:42] make him recognize that? He recognized
[45:44] that because he was a he was a Jew.
[45:47] understood that that pillar of fire had
[45:50] been with Moses and that God dwelt in
[45:52] that fire. And so he recognized it was a
[45:55] scriptural thing. He had read about
[45:57] Moses, but it was just a a knowledge. In
[46:00] fact, Paul said he was the Pharisee of
[46:02] the Pharisees. He knew the scriptures
[46:04] inside and out. He knew the Jewish
[46:05] religion, but he never met God until
[46:08] that moment when the pillar of fire came
[46:10] down.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; And he met him there in a pillar of
[46:14] fire. Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord
[46:16] said, "I am Jesus whom thou
[46:18] persecutest." It's always been Jesus,
[46:21] the pillar of fire, has always been
[46:23] Christ. I am Jesus whom thou persecuted.
[46:26] It is hard for thee to kick against the
[46:28] pricks. And he trembling and astonished
[46:30] said, Lord, what wil thou have me to do?
[46:33] And the Lord said unto him, arise and go
[46:35] into the city, and it shall be told thee
[46:36] that what thou must do. Now, they had
[46:38] something in common, Moses and Paul,
[46:41] because they had seen the visible
[46:42] presence of God. The Jews called that
[46:46] visible presence the shikina glory.
[46:48] Shikina means to dwell. It's a it's a
[46:51] Hebrew word means to dwell. And the
[46:54] glory was the the the presence of God.
[46:58] It literally means the face of God. So
[47:01] the pillar of fire or cloud in the Old
[47:04] Testament was an evidence of his
[47:06] dwelling in a place.
[47:09] Now, I want you to understand when we
[47:11] say he's here, we're not talking about a
[47:14] worked up emotional state. That's
[47:16] &gt;&gt; right.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Right. That's not what we're talking
[47:19] about when we say he's here.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Because he's there whether you feel him
[47:23] or whether you don't.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Right. He's there. I'm so glad he's with
[47:28] you. No matter what you feel like, no
[47:29] matter what's going on in your life, no
[47:31] matter what trouble you might be going
[47:33] through this morning, he's still there
[47:34] with you. You young people at school,
[47:36] you might you might be troubled. You
[47:38] might be feel intimidated by all the
[47:40] things going around, but when you bow
[47:42] your head there at the lunch table to
[47:43] pray, he's there with you. He promised
[47:46] he would be there with you. When you
[47:47] make a stand for Christ in a community
[47:49] that you live in, you ladies, when you
[47:51] dress the way you do, act the way that
[47:52] you do, we're different from the world.
[47:54] I know that. I know we're different, but
[47:56] there's a reason for that difference.
[47:58] We're trying to obey the word of God as
[47:59] best we can. And when when you obey the
[48:02] word of God, he's there with you. He
[48:04] said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[48:05] forsake you." I'm so thankful for that.
[48:07] But I'm also thankful that when moments
[48:09] even that we fail and when we turn our
[48:11] back on him and we don't do what's
[48:13] right, he's still there.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so glad for that today.
[48:17] I'm so glad it's not just when I'm doing
[48:19] right, when I'm thinking right, when I'm
[48:21] acting right, but even in the moments
[48:23] when I can't even seem to know what
[48:25] right is, he's still there.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; And if you'll just reach out to him this
[48:29] morning, you say, "Brother Ben, you
[48:30] don't know what I've done. You don't
[48:32] know where I've been, but he's still
[48:33] there. He wants to He wants to display
[48:36] his presence to you.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; If you just let him this morning,
[48:42] sir,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire was the visible
[48:46] manifestation.
[48:48] And Jehovah, God,
[48:51] spoke from that visible manifestation of
[48:54] his presence. God in the form of the
[48:57] logos, the pillar of fire, the
[48:59] anointing.
[49:00] And we know the pillar of fire is not
[49:02] the same as the son of man. Brother
[49:03] Brandham explained that to us. The
[49:05] scriptures teach that the son of man is
[49:07] Christ, the flesh of Christ that housed
[49:10] deity, the fullness of the godhead
[49:12] bodily, the scripture says. But the
[49:15] pillar of fire dwelt in him, right?
[49:18] That's the the spirit that was in him.
[49:20] And that pillar of fire is the logos
[49:22] that went out of God. Where do you get
[49:23] logos? John chapter 1. In the beginning
[49:25] was the word. The word was with God.
[49:26] That word is logos. In the beginning was
[49:28] the logos. Logos was with God. And the
[49:30] logos was God. The logos was made flesh
[49:33] and dwelt among us. So there was God
[49:35] dwelt in in a form. No man has seen God
[49:38] at any time, but he made himself he
[49:41] condescended and and he showed himself
[49:44] as an angel of the Lord in a in a
[49:47] theophony body. He showed himself as a
[49:49] pillar of fire. He showed himself as a
[49:52] light.
[49:53] And that was a a part of God which was
[49:55] the attribute of the fullness of God.
[49:57] And it becomes the son of God. And we
[49:59] know that because Paul said, "Lord, who
[50:01] art thou Lord?" He said, "I am Jesus." I
[50:03] hope you can follow me through that. So
[50:06] when God become into a form where it
[50:08] could be seen, it was the anointing of
[50:10] the great spirit that went forth. It's
[50:12] condescending coming down. God the
[50:14] father, the logos, was up over Israel.
[50:16] He was holy, could not bear sin. There
[50:18] had to be a blood offering in Eden. Then
[50:20] that logos became flesh and dwelt among
[50:22] us. And where this logos dwelt in a
[50:24] human body, which was a sacrifice. Now,
[50:27] the logos dwelt in Christ. Christ was
[50:29] born to die for our sins. Aren't you
[50:32] glad that he did? We don't ever get past
[50:34] that. We don't ever get too revelated
[50:36] for that. We needed a cross. We still
[50:38] need the cross today.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; And we know that Christ is the glory of
[50:42] God. In fact, in Revelation 21 23, when
[50:46] we get to that city, when we get to that
[50:48] new heavens and new earth, it says, "The
[50:50] city had no need of the sun, neither the
[50:52] moon to shine in it, for the glory of
[50:54] God did lighten it, and the lamb is the
[50:57] light thereof." So he said, "Christ is
[51:00] the glory of God. He is the attribute of
[51:02] the fullness of God. He is the pillar of
[51:05] fire."
[51:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:08] And when man was made in the image of
[51:10] God, then God come down in the image of
[51:12] man to redeem man. That brought man and
[51:14] God together. It's a great thing,
[51:16] church, because we had no way when Adam
[51:18] sinned. We had no way back into the
[51:20] presence of God. Oh my. Adam went out
[51:23] with it when when Eve uh did what she
[51:25] did and Adam did what he did and they
[51:26] went away out of the garden. We had no
[51:28] way. But a lamb's blood was spilled.
[51:30] Amen. Amen. And before the foundation of
[51:33] the world, God had made a way to bridge
[51:35] the gap in the chasm to bring you back
[51:37] into fellowship with God again. And that
[51:40] way was by was by the logos, the pillar
[51:43] of fire becoming flesh and dying for
[51:46] your sins.
[51:48] Oh my. God come down in the image of man
[51:50] to redeem man that brought man and God
[51:52] together. Heaven and earth hugged and
[51:53] kissed each other. God and man embraced
[51:55] each other. Fatherhood and sunship from
[51:56] the logos became flesh and dwelt among
[51:58] us. This logos there was in him which
[52:00] was the spirit of God. the anointing
[52:02] through the sanctifying grace of the
[52:03] blood brought many sons to God which is
[52:05] anointed with the same logos.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Right? He was the firstborn Paul says
[52:09] among many brethren
[52:11] &gt;&gt; now on the day of Pentecost. Now we're
[52:13] not Christ. We don't have the fullness
[52:14] of God but we have we we have a portion
[52:17] of his spirit. He was divided among the
[52:19] body of Christ. I'm so thankful he's
[52:22] still here today.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, he come down
[52:27] that same pillar of fire that Moses saw.
[52:30] The same pillar of fire that Paul saw
[52:32] came down on the day of Pentecost and it
[52:34] broke apart like that and tongues of
[52:36] fire set upon each of them. Not their
[52:38] tongues but tongues of fire. An elected
[52:41] selected group identified by this pillar
[52:43] of fire showing that God had separated
[52:46] himself into man. He said God the logo
[52:49] separating himself into man. God not in
[52:50] one person. He's in his church universal
[52:53] right now while God is here speaking
[52:54] with us in our hearts. He's in Africa.
[52:56] He's in Asia. He's in Europe. He's in
[52:58] England. Whoever believers are gathered
[53:00] together, there he is in the midst of
[53:02] them. And after he talks about how Paul
[53:04] was struck down by the pillar of fire,
[53:06] he said that was not the son of man.
[53:08] That was the logos. Now this great
[53:09] pillar of fire is absolutely identified
[53:11] even by cameras. We got the picture of
[53:13] it. We show there in Houston how it
[53:16] struck the lens. Psy lens won't take
[53:18] psychology. It wasn't a workup. It
[53:20] wasn't a mental kind of emotion. But God
[53:23] came down where he could be seen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I I don't think we recognize
[53:29] the importance of that this morning,
[53:30] church.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; God came down where he could be seen in
[53:33] our age.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; He was about to do something. Well, I
[53:37] believe one day, I believe soon, he's
[53:40] coming back like he promised.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; He come down on our to show us
[53:46] something.
[53:48] He said, "I called it psychology, but
[53:49] the light struck the lens, and the lens
[53:52] won't take psychology." He said, "Then
[53:53] watch the works of it among us proves
[53:55] the same Jesus that once lived in
[53:57] Palestine. The same spirit was upon him
[53:59] has come up through a body until it's
[54:01] come back to headship again. He's coming
[54:03] soon to claim the body." The head's
[54:05] coming to the body. He is the head of
[54:07] the church. Is that right? And Paul says
[54:09] he and all things. Someone say all
[54:11] things. All things he might have the
[54:14] preeminence. I want him to have the
[54:15] preeminence in our services to have the
[54:17] preeminence. What has the preeminence?
[54:19] The logos, the word, the pillar of fire,
[54:21] the presence of God. You can't have the
[54:23] presence of God without the word of God.
[54:25] That's why we put so much emphasis on
[54:27] preaching. That's why we put so much
[54:29] emphasis on the word of God because we
[54:31] believe that's what makes the presence
[54:32] of God come down and do its work.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; The word of God, the mechanics and the
[54:37] dynamics working together. He said, "I'm
[54:40] not he. I'm his servant." Amen. He said
[54:42] it's in the pillar of fire. It's not he.
[54:44] in spirit form was upon the son of man
[54:46] has come down now to anoint sons of man
[54:48] to bring back a ministry just exactly
[54:50] like he said it would be in order for
[54:52] the head and the rest of the body to
[54:53] connect together.
[54:55] Now we know whenever a major
[54:56] dispensational change came, God spoke to
[55:00] a prophet through the pillar of fire,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; right? God spoke to Moses through a
[55:06] pillar of fire because it was it was a
[55:08] change over from the Abrahamic
[55:11] over now to Moses was going to bring
[55:14] under the law because the people desired
[55:16] the law. So they had to have something
[55:18] to live by and yet yet they had grace
[55:21] but they chose the law but but they but
[55:24] they chose the law to live by and when
[55:26] they did there was a there was a pillar
[55:29] of fire that come down to identify the
[55:33] prophet and and and the the commandments
[55:36] that they were true and and it was the
[55:39] visible presence of God and and remember
[55:42] when God spoke to the people he spoke to
[55:44] them and he and I want you to think with
[55:46] me this morning how that God spoke to
[55:48] the people. He spoke to them directly.
[55:50] Remember, he come down on the pillar of
[55:51] fire and cloud. He spoke to the people
[55:53] and the people said, "Don't let God
[55:55] speak.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; It's too terrible.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; We're afraid to stand in the presence of
[56:01] God."
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; I know there's a lot of frolic today and
[56:04] people run around and I I believe in
[56:06] emotion. I believe in being happy in
[56:08] your religion. I believe in shouting and
[56:10] dancing and jumping, whatever you want
[56:11] to do. But the presence of God when you
[56:13] come into it, there ought to be a a not
[56:15] not a fear because we know we can come
[56:17] boldly before the throne of God. But
[56:18] there ought to be a a real sincerity in
[56:21] our hearts and our lives when we come to
[56:23] the house of God. It's not a place to
[56:25] make jokes and and chew gum and run
[56:27] around do things, run around the
[56:29] sanctuary uh during between services and
[56:31] things. There's a reason why we keep the
[56:33] order that we do. Because we believe
[56:35] this is where the presence of God, not
[56:37] just in this building, but all in all of
[56:39] our lives, but especially when we're
[56:40] gathered together. We believe the pillar
[56:42] of fire comes down right here in our
[56:44] midst.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; They said, "Don't let God speak. Let
[56:48] Moses speak."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; All right,
[56:52] sir.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; And so they separated themselves from
[56:56] it. And so God came down into Moses,
[57:01] veiled himself in Moses.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; We'll get to the scripture after a
[57:04] while, Lord willing. And if I can get
[57:07] through enough before we time to go, but
[57:11] he talked about how Moses was veiled
[57:14] from the people because his face was
[57:16] shown. Yes, sir.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said Moses didn't even
[57:19] realize it. But when the people saw it,
[57:21] they couldn't even look at him. So he
[57:24] had to veil his face because he had been
[57:26] in the presence of God.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Now he comes down for a purpose. When he
[57:37] come to Moses, he come down. They said,
[57:39] "Don't let God speak, let Moses speak."
[57:41] And so that was a dispensation change.
[57:43] He come down to Paul and and the message
[57:46] was going to the Gentiles, a previously
[57:49] unrevealed mystery,
[57:51] &gt;&gt; right? That was in the scripture. But
[57:52] the Jews couldn't see the the age of the
[57:55] Gentiles. But Paul recognized it by
[57:58] grace. God gave him a message to the
[58:00] Gentiles. And it was a pillar of fire
[58:02] that come down and identified it
[58:04] &gt;&gt; and changed his life. Amen. Just like it
[58:07] changed Moses. Five minutes in his
[58:09] presence. Changed his life.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Why? It was for a purpose. Every time he
[58:15] comes,
[58:18] &gt;&gt; church.
[58:22] List, you mentioned that this morning in
[58:24] your prayer is what inspired this
[58:25] message. Every time he comes,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; it's for a purpose,
[58:32] sir.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we're we're tired or we're
[58:37] weary. We've been through a lot of
[58:38] things. And I understand I I I live a
[58:41] life a normal life like everybody else.
[58:43] I'm not all the time in the presence of
[58:44] God. I realize I I live a life I get
[58:47] worried about things. I I I stress out
[58:49] about things and have to do the things
[58:51] that everybody else does in life and I'm
[58:53] grateful to be a minister and be able to
[58:55] study and do these things. That don't
[58:56] mean I'm always I'm always feel his
[58:59] presence. I believe he's always there. I
[59:01] don't always feel him. But I'll tell you
[59:03] what, when I do feel him, I want to take
[59:05] advantage of that moment in his
[59:06] presence. I want to if he wants me to
[59:08] take my shoes off, let me take my shoes
[59:10] off. I don't But that's what he asked
[59:12] him to do. But what would he ask you to
[59:14] do? I don't know. But whatever he asks
[59:15] you to do when you're in his presence,
[59:17] you ought to do it.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; We ought to take that seriously
[59:25] &gt;&gt; when he comes.
[59:27] Cuz every time he comes, something good
[59:29] happens.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Church, I don't want this just to be
[59:39] another service.
[59:43] I don't want one of our services, we
[59:44] have three services a week, and I don't
[59:46] want one of them most weeks. I don't
[59:47] want one of them to be just another
[59:50] service,
[59:52] &gt;&gt; just another box that we check, just
[59:54] another moment that we spent worshiping
[59:56] or playing instruments or preaching, but
[59:59] let it be a moment in the presence of
[1:00:01] God. I realized that without him, I
[1:00:03] can't do anything. I can't say anything.
[1:00:06] I can't be effective. I can't help
[1:00:08] nobody. So Lord, I need you. I need to
[1:00:10] be in your presence.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; And if we're not careful, brother Paul,
[1:00:16] we we get so sidetracked by everything
[1:00:19] going on in our life
[1:00:22] that the pillar of fire can come right
[1:00:24] down among us.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And be right here in the midst of the
[1:00:28] church
[1:00:32] and we walk away say, "Well, the
[1:00:34] preacher did good today or he did bad."
[1:00:39] that the songs were good,
[1:00:42] but did we spend any time
[1:00:45] sincerely in the presence of Jehovah?
[1:00:54] Brother Brandham talked about how it was
[1:00:55] identified scientifically, the pillar of
[1:00:57] fire. But I want you to notice this. He
[1:00:59] said, "And by the reaction."
[1:01:02] So the pillar of fire was identified.
[1:01:03] They took a picture of it and proved
[1:01:06] that it was genuine. And then it was
[1:01:08] identified by the reaction.
[1:01:11] By the reaction. So that would be the
[1:01:12] people's response to the pillar of fire
[1:01:16] coming. I'm taking this soul for a
[1:01:18] reason this morning. I hope that we can
[1:01:20] catch it. We can grasp it. So
[1:01:25] it was identified by the reaction by its
[1:01:28] character and everything else just the
[1:01:30] same as it was when it was dwelling in
[1:01:32] the body of God's only begotten son. So
[1:01:36] does it dwell in the body of his adopted
[1:01:40] sons for the last day.
[1:01:43] He said, "Now I know, brother. We've had
[1:01:45] a lot of this impersonation." And we've
[1:01:47] seen a lot of that there. We went
[1:01:48] through a period of time. It's not so
[1:01:50] much anymore. Now the big thing is
[1:01:52] everybody falls out on the floor. And
[1:01:54] again, God does that, but it's become a
[1:01:56] mockery of it,
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; right? Through the charismatic move.
[1:02:00] Everybody's falling out on the floor.
[1:02:01] Everybody's doing this stuff. We believe
[1:02:03] in the real thing,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; but we don't believe in the mockery of
[1:02:06] it.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; But it become there comes through a time
[1:02:08] and I remember that even in the message
[1:02:10] when everybody had the pillar of fire
[1:02:12] appearing all the time.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; But when he comes, he comes for a
[1:02:16] reason.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; When he shows himself visible, that's a
[1:02:20] big deal.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; He's making himself known.
[1:02:25] He's not just coming so some guy
[1:02:27] somewhere can can beat a bunch of people
[1:02:30] over the head and say this came to me
[1:02:31] and some
[1:02:34] come on church. I've been through it. I
[1:02:36] know I I was raised around that where
[1:02:38] people were always saying they saw the
[1:02:39] pillar of fire to try to vindicate their
[1:02:41] own ministry so they could say whatever
[1:02:42] they wanted to that was outside of the
[1:02:44] scripture. Whatever they wanted to that
[1:02:45] was outside of the message. But listen,
[1:02:47] I didn't come to bring you something new
[1:02:48] this morning. I come to tell you what a
[1:02:50] prophet said. I come tell you what the
[1:02:52] Bible says.
[1:02:54] If you want to hear something new, you
[1:02:56] you know, you don't you don't need to be
[1:02:57] here.
[1:02:59] But I tell you this, the thing that we
[1:03:01] have, the same pillar of fire, if it
[1:03:04] would inspire a prophet to preach, if it
[1:03:06] would inspire Moses to write the law and
[1:03:08] Paul to write the New Testament and a
[1:03:10] prophet to preach the word, I believe
[1:03:11] when I preach the same word that they
[1:03:14] preach, I that same pillar of fire will
[1:03:16] change your life. It'll make you new.
[1:03:18] It'll make your home different. It'll
[1:03:20] make your family new.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:27] Brother Brandon talked about how he had
[1:03:28] a loss of impersonation.
[1:03:30] He said, "But the Bible said it would
[1:03:32] happen." Janice and Jan Jambers withtood
[1:03:34] Moses. Just got to happen. But don't let
[1:03:36] that blind you. When you see a bogus
[1:03:38] dollar, remember was made off of a real
[1:03:40] one. See, if it isn't, it it's the
[1:03:41] original. But there is an original Holy
[1:03:44] Ghost, original Christ. Certainly, he is
[1:03:46] the Holy Ghost. And the pillar of fire
[1:03:48] still alive today among us all these
[1:03:50] thousands of years still is here.
[1:03:55] I know I'm reading a lot, but I just I
[1:03:57] want to just really settle this in
[1:03:58] before I get to what I want to say this
[1:04:00] morning.
[1:04:02] The Lson translation of the Bible, they
[1:04:05] had a on the cover of it a triangle
[1:04:07] light.
[1:04:08] It was showed the three attributes of
[1:04:10] God in a godhead.
[1:04:12] And it was a sign to the to the Hebrew
[1:04:15] of God light. And when Moses met him in
[1:04:18] the bush, he said, "I am." He said,
[1:04:21] "They'll they'll ask what your name is
[1:04:24] because everybody said they had a god
[1:04:25] appear to them, right? There were all
[1:04:27] kinds of desert gods, all kinds of city
[1:04:30] gods, all kinds of water god, all kinds
[1:04:32] of gods.
[1:04:34] Even the Hindus today, I forget how many
[1:04:36] millions of gods the Hindus have,
[1:04:39] but but there there's all kinds of
[1:04:41] gods." So the people being pagans and
[1:04:43] and even the children of Israel were
[1:04:45] around those pagans and they would have
[1:04:46] asked, "Well, who is this God?"
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; What's your name? He said, "I am."
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; I love that. Not I was, not I will be,
[1:04:54] but I am. Which remains the same. It
[1:04:57] means he's always
[1:04:59] there. We may not always see him, but
[1:05:01] he's always there. He's the same
[1:05:04] yesterday, today, and forever. According
[1:05:05] to Hebrews 13:8, he's still the same
[1:05:07] God. And Moses made him in the burning
[1:05:09] bush. He was a light. And when he led
[1:05:10] the children of Israel out of the
[1:05:11] wilderness, he was the angel of the
[1:05:12] covenant. Moses by face on forsook Egypt
[1:05:15] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:05:18] treasures than that of Egypt. Now that
[1:05:20] that's taken from Hebrews 11. Now think
[1:05:22] about this for a moment. Moses esteemed
[1:05:24] the reproach of Christ,
[1:05:27] right? The the reproach of Christ. And I
[1:05:29] know the immediate response to that is
[1:05:30] Paul take Paul's taking liberty there
[1:05:32] because he's just well he's just saying
[1:05:34] Christ, but really was the reproach of
[1:05:36] Jehovah. But no, Paul knew what he was
[1:05:37] talking about.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; He esteemed the reproach of Christ
[1:05:40] greater riches.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; What was he saying?
[1:05:43] Amen. The one who who revealed to him
[1:05:46] was Christ. He had a responsibility. He
[1:05:48] had seen Christ in that form of the
[1:05:51] pillar of fire. And he esteemed the
[1:05:54] reproach of Christ. Christ means the
[1:05:57] anointed one. He he esteemed the
[1:05:59] reproach of that that that moment he had
[1:06:02] greater than all the treasures of Egypt.
[1:06:05] And and to do that, he had to look by
[1:06:07] faith. Because even if you see the
[1:06:09] pillar of fire in its natural form, even
[1:06:12] if it would come this morning and hang
[1:06:13] here, though I wouldn't say that it
[1:06:15] couldn't, it could come and you could
[1:06:17] see it, but even if you did, you'd have
[1:06:18] to have faith to believe it.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; But what he wants us to do is to see
[1:06:24] what's not visible.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? When
[1:06:28] when Moses, he he led them by the pillar
[1:06:30] of fire and by the cloud. But when they
[1:06:32] entered into the promised land, there
[1:06:33] was no more pillar of fire, no more
[1:06:35] cloud, but the pillar of fire become a
[1:06:37] person, the captain of the host. And he
[1:06:39] come and met Joshua on the other side of
[1:06:41] the Jordan and told him how to take
[1:06:42] Jericho. I believe that same pillar of
[1:06:44] fire is living in bodies of flesh today.
[1:06:48] Amen. I believe he's the same yesterday,
[1:06:49] today, and forever.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That same anointing came
[1:06:54] down with his baptism. When Christ was
[1:06:56] baptized, he come in his baptism, went
[1:06:58] into Christ, and dwelt in him. John knew
[1:06:59] it was him. said, "Upon whom thou shalt
[1:07:01] see the spirit led them out of Egypt in
[1:07:04] the wilderness, out of the wilderness
[1:07:05] into the promised land, upon whom thou
[1:07:06] shalt see this triangle form of God
[1:07:09] coming down remaining on." He's the one
[1:07:10] that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:12] fire.
[1:07:13] Paul hadn't been privileged of seeing
[1:07:15] this yet, but just to make it true to
[1:07:17] you, the Jews were so forbidden to bow
[1:07:19] before an idol or anything, but when he
[1:07:21] saw this great light, he knew that was
[1:07:22] the Lord. I like this Lord means
[1:07:25] ownership, control of. He would have not
[1:07:27] just called just anything Lord that
[1:07:29] staunch Hebrew when he knew that that
[1:07:31] was that that that was spirit he said
[1:07:34] but he knew that the same pillar of fire
[1:07:36] had been the one that led his people and
[1:07:38] he comes back and said Lord who are you
[1:07:40] I want to know who you are
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; you met Moses in the name of I am
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; right
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; oh my he said Jesus when he was on earth
[1:07:48] anointed with that that they saw
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; so Jesus was anointed with what they saw
[1:07:53] he said I come from God the spirit the
[1:07:55] light the pillar fire and I returned to
[1:07:57] God. He was made flesh in order to die
[1:07:58] for our sins. And after his death,
[1:08:00] burial, resurrection, and ascension, he
[1:08:01] ascended up on the 50th day, returned
[1:08:03] back in the form of a pillar of fire.
[1:08:05] Among the people, separated himself like
[1:08:07] tongues of fire sent upon each of them.
[1:08:09] And they were all filled with the Holy
[1:08:11] Ghost and began to speak in other
[1:08:12] tongues. As the spirit gave them
[1:08:13] utterance, remembering they the the
[1:08:15] 3,000 that were outside, they asked
[1:08:17] Peter, "What could shall we what can we
[1:08:19] do to be saved?" He said, "Repent, be
[1:08:20] baptized, every one of you in the name
[1:08:22] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:08:23] sin, and you shall receive the gift of
[1:08:24] the Holy Ghost." What was that gift of
[1:08:26] the Holy Ghost? The same pillar of fire
[1:08:28] that sat down on each one of them would
[1:08:30] divide himself into every member
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; of the body of Christ. Oh, I'm so glad
[1:08:34] this morning if you got the baptism of
[1:08:36] the Holy Ghost this morning, if you
[1:08:38] really been born again, changed, you got
[1:08:40] that same anointing, that same God that
[1:08:43] was inside Moses, the same God that was
[1:08:45] in Paul, that same God is in you today.
[1:08:50] I think we ought to quit giving in to
[1:08:52] the devil.
[1:08:53] Oh, oh, my problems are too much. My
[1:08:55] struggles are too hard. I got too much
[1:08:57] going on. I can't really serve God like
[1:08:59] the word says cuz I got too You got what
[1:09:01] you got is excuses. But if you'll just
[1:09:03] recognize that the word of God is still
[1:09:05] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:09:07] It don't matter what your situation is.
[1:09:09] He's still God.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Come on. Is he still God or is he not
[1:09:12] God? I believe he is still God. He's
[1:09:15] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:16] forever. He's the same God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:19] Yeah,
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; I know your baby's not feeling well this
[1:09:23] morning, but the same God that brought
[1:09:24] her into the world is the same God
[1:09:26] that'll heal her. The same Come on,
[1:09:28] church. The same God that saved you.
[1:09:30] It's the same God that'll heal you. The
[1:09:32] same God that brought you in is the same
[1:09:34] God that'll bring your children in.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; The same God that come to you and change
[1:09:39] your life is the same God will change
[1:09:40] your body one day.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] Brother Brandon said they you see see
[1:09:51] we're not a divided people.
[1:09:53] We've got to be in unity because each
[1:09:55] one of us holding a part of God and we
[1:09:58] must come together
[1:10:01] and then the pillar of fire is
[1:10:03] manifested in the wholeness and the
[1:10:04] fullness of it when his church sets
[1:10:06] together in heavenly places. That's from
[1:10:09] Ephesians 1 that we've been studying.
[1:10:11] And the fullness of the power of God is
[1:10:13] in his church. Each one of us holding
[1:10:16] spiritual gifts and spiritual offices
[1:10:19] coming together brings that pillar of
[1:10:21] fire back again.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Whether we see it in a in this
[1:10:29] three dimensions
[1:10:31] or whether we don't,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; he said, "I'll be here."
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; He told his disciples said, "I'll never
[1:10:37] leave you." Yes,
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Said I won't leave you comfortless. That
[1:10:40] word is orphanos.
[1:10:42] Orphans.
[1:10:44] I won't leave you without help. I'll
[1:10:47] come to you. That ought to put a courage
[1:10:48] in you that you can do anything.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; If there's a calling, if there's
[1:10:53] something in your life that's calling,
[1:10:54] maybe it's calling you to be a real
[1:10:56] husband, a real provider. Maybe it's
[1:10:58] calling you to be a real wife. Maybe
[1:11:00] it's calling you to be a real preacher,
[1:11:01] a real deacon, whatever office maybe
[1:11:04] that you might hold in the church.
[1:11:06] Something in you calling you said, "I
[1:11:07] just can't do it like what I want to do
[1:11:09] it." But I'm here to tell you, if that
[1:11:11] same pillar of fire, if that same spirit
[1:11:13] dwells in you, it'll also quicken your
[1:11:16] mortal bodies, it it'll make you where
[1:11:18] you can do what you've been called to
[1:11:19] do. You you you are able to overcome
[1:11:22] every every fiery dart of the enemy. How
[1:11:24] many believe that today?
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he's here, then he can do the
[1:11:29] same things he did when he walked the
[1:11:30] shores of Galilee. He's still the same
[1:11:32] God. He said, "Greater works shall you
[1:11:34] do." He said, "Cuz I go to my father."
[1:11:36] But listen to me, church. What What is
[1:11:37] it? There's more. There's more here.
[1:11:39] this morning we can do more than what
[1:11:41] even what he did greater even in the
[1:11:43] sense that now we can speak the word
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; are you with me now
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; when we speak it means something
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; so of course you know brother Brandham
[1:11:54] having the discernment like he did being
[1:11:55] able to know what's in people's lives he
[1:11:57] said here's a lady he'd often say
[1:12:00] something like this he said sitting he
[1:12:02] said see that light can you see it and
[1:12:05] if you listen to the tapes or watch the
[1:12:06] mo the film you've seen
[1:12:09] You've seen the people sitting there.
[1:12:10] He'd say, "See that light? Everybody
[1:12:12] look." See kind of an amber looking
[1:12:13] circle. Many times they couldn't see it,
[1:12:16] but yet his picture was taken.
[1:12:19] And on Deep Calls to the Deep, it's
[1:12:20] interesting because you can actually see
[1:12:21] ministers standing up looking for it.
[1:12:26] But it it was a common thing for him,
[1:12:30] right? He would see that and and he
[1:12:32] would know that's that's why he called
[1:12:34] people out of the audience. It wasn't
[1:12:35] just picking somebody, but he'd the
[1:12:37] purifier would settle down over that
[1:12:38] person.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; It was common for him to see that.
[1:12:45] But when brother Brandham, it wouldn't
[1:12:47] be for us, but it was for him. He's a
[1:12:49] prophet. But brother Brandham was
[1:12:50] hunting in Colorado. You remember the
[1:12:52] story? And a storm begins to blow up. I
[1:12:54] know we got some brothers hunting in
[1:12:55] Colorado right now. Hope they don't have
[1:12:58] any storms.
[1:13:00] But Brother Brandham talked about this.
[1:13:01] He said, "You don't have to believe
[1:13:02] this, but it's true. A voice spoke to
[1:13:04] me. He said, "I am the Lord God. I've
[1:13:06] created the heavens and the earth.
[1:13:07] Nature obeys me."
[1:13:09] Now, this is very interesting. Brother
[1:13:11] Brandon says, "I I sat there a little
[1:13:12] bit, jerked off my hat, and the voice
[1:13:15] spoke to me and said, "I'm the Lord God.
[1:13:16] I've created the heavens, earth, nations
[1:13:17] obey me." He said, "I sat there for a
[1:13:18] little bit and and and that voice
[1:13:21] somewhere I couldn't see it." He's the
[1:13:22] only thing I could hear it. It was
[1:13:24] around there in them trees somewhere. I
[1:13:25] thought, "Well, usually you see that
[1:13:27] light that all of you know about.
[1:13:28] Usually it's there."
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; But I looked everywhere and I couldn't
[1:13:31] see the light.
[1:13:33] But even though a prophet couldn't see
[1:13:35] it,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; it was still there.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I said, "Where are you, oh God, my
[1:13:40] creator?" I looked around. I couldn't
[1:13:42] hear it no more. Hear his voice. You all
[1:13:43] know the story. Finally, the voice spoke
[1:13:45] again. And brother Brandham, he said,
[1:13:47] "Speak to your problem." Brother
[1:13:50] Brandham speaks to the storm. And the
[1:13:51] storm stopped.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; See, you don't really believe that
[1:13:55] happened. I do.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Cuz I believe the voice of God today is
[1:13:59] in his people. I believe that with all
[1:14:02] of my heart. I believe that you can
[1:14:04] speak. I'm not just saying just about
[1:14:05] anything, but when the inspiration
[1:14:07] comes, when in that time when you when
[1:14:09] you know you you're standing on his
[1:14:11] word, you're in his presence, and he
[1:14:12] inspires you to speak, you can speak to
[1:14:14] the storms in your life.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what, what I've needed
[1:14:18] most of all in my life is not a a
[1:14:20] natural storm spoken away, but most of
[1:14:22] what I've needed is to the storm in this
[1:14:25] in this earth, in this flesh, that needs
[1:14:27] to be stopped. Many times when I when my
[1:14:29] thoughts get away from me and it seemed
[1:14:31] like there's a tornado tearing up my
[1:14:33] life and it seemed like everything's
[1:14:35] going wrong, I can speak to that as a
[1:14:37] son of God and say, "I know if you steal
[1:14:39] the storm when Jesus stood on the bow of
[1:14:41] the boat and he said, "Peace be still."
[1:14:43] And you showed a prophet, it could still
[1:14:45] be done. He's the same God. And the
[1:14:46] prophet wasn't God, but Jesus is still
[1:14:49] God.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; And he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:14:52] forever. And he stood there and stopped
[1:14:53] the storm. I believe it happened cuz I
[1:14:55] believe it'll happen for me. I believe
[1:14:57] it has happened for me.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; So why wouldn't he show himself always
[1:15:09] just let you know just hang here where
[1:15:10] we could always see him? Well, he wants
[1:15:13] us to believe
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; by faith.
[1:15:17] Moses,
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; he didn't always, he wasn't always in
[1:15:22] the presence of that pillar of fire,
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; but he promised him he would be with
[1:15:26] him.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; So, he stood in the face of Pharaoh,
[1:15:29] even in opposition, even when it seemed
[1:15:31] like things were going wrong, yet he
[1:15:33] stood there and declared the word of the
[1:15:34] Lord. And God honored his word.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:40] He wants us to believe him.
[1:15:42] See, he veiled himself as we said behind
[1:15:45] Moses when they said, "Let don't let
[1:15:46] Moses speak. Let God speak." He veiled
[1:15:48] himself behind badger skins that there
[1:15:51] were skins hung over the tabernacle and
[1:15:52] over the holy of holies. A veil that was
[1:15:55] over the holy of holies. He veiled
[1:15:56] himself in the body of his son. We know
[1:15:59] when he hung there on the cross, the
[1:16:00] mercy seat was that was physically the
[1:16:03] mercy seat was there or they thought
[1:16:05] that it was, but actually the mercy
[1:16:07] seat, God's place of mercy was hanging
[1:16:09] on a cross and they couldn't see it. But
[1:16:12] so what did he do? He rent the veil from
[1:16:13] the top to the bottom showing it was the
[1:16:15] hand of God that did it. Rent the veil
[1:16:18] from the top to the bottom show that
[1:16:19] that that was not a mercy seat any
[1:16:21] longer. But you must come to Christ to
[1:16:23] be saved. Are you with me now?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; You must come to Christ to be saved. And
[1:16:27] so God hid himself in the body of his
[1:16:29] son. On the day of Pentecost, he hid
[1:16:30] himself in 120 believers. And ever since
[1:16:33] then, he's failed himself in his body,
[1:16:35] the church.
[1:16:37] But by faith, Israel knew he was back
[1:16:40] there. They knew he was there regardless
[1:16:41] what any of the heathen worlds had to
[1:16:43] say. He was hid from the unbeliever. But
[1:16:46] the believer by faith knew he was back
[1:16:47] there. Listen, in the old temple in
[1:16:48] Solomon's temple, when the presence of
[1:16:50] shikina of God was still there, we just
[1:16:52] got done preaching about it. The
[1:16:54] presence of God was still there in that
[1:16:55] temple.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And the people knew.
[1:17:00] The people knew it was there,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; but you remember they couldn't go look
[1:17:04] at it.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Only the high priest could go once a
[1:17:08] year.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And if he went wrong, he'd
[1:17:10] die.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He had to go with a pomegranate and a
[1:17:13] bail tied to his bottom of his robe. And
[1:17:15] then wherever he walked and cried holy
[1:17:17] to the Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; If he didn't walk a certain way and
[1:17:20] dress himself a certain way and anointed
[1:17:22] a certain way and he would actually die.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; They say that they actually put a rope
[1:17:26] around their leg and they would pull him
[1:17:28] out of there. They didn't dare go in and
[1:17:29] get him. If he died, they would actually
[1:17:31] pull him pull him out. But as long as
[1:17:33] they followed exactly the directions of
[1:17:36] God, they would be saved. But only one
[1:17:38] man once a year. And brother Brandham
[1:17:39] talked to us how those people must have
[1:17:41] yearned to go into the presence of God.
[1:17:43] Do you realize what he did for us on
[1:17:45] Calvary? He he he opened up the Holy of
[1:17:48] Holies so that we could go in.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; But they still believed it was there
[1:17:52] even though they couldn't see it. There
[1:17:53] will be moments in your life when you
[1:17:55] don't feel him. There will be moments in
[1:17:56] your life when you you don't see the
[1:17:57] visible pillar of fire and you can't
[1:17:59] even feel the warmth of it. But you know
[1:18:01] he's still there because he promised he
[1:18:03] would be with you. And it's during those
[1:18:05] moments you've got to believe no matter
[1:18:07] what the world says. I still believe in
[1:18:09] the God of Elijah. I still believe in
[1:18:12] the God of Moses. I still believe in the
[1:18:13] God of Paul. Hallelujah.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; I believe in the God of my fathers, the
[1:18:17] God of the Bible. Why? Hallelujah.
[1:18:21] Because I know that Shikina is there in
[1:18:24] another dimension hid behind skins.
[1:18:29] Amen.
[1:18:32] We enter into that unseen world by
[1:18:35] faith. And this is why in the same
[1:18:37] service, are y'all still with me this
[1:18:39] morning?
[1:18:40] In the same service, one person can sit
[1:18:43] there and be absolutely bored to death.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And another person sit there and and
[1:18:52] they they know he's there. And just
[1:18:55] while the preaching's going on, they
[1:18:56] just suddenly receive their healing.
[1:19:00] Maybe during a song they're they're
[1:19:02] released from spirits of depression and
[1:19:05] things like that. But it's faith that
[1:19:07] does it.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; It's not how good you live.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Although we know we have confidence with
[1:19:12] God if we don't have condemnation in our
[1:19:15] life, but it's not how good you live.
[1:19:17] Did you ever notice how much your your
[1:19:18] your flesh has to do with that?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Like if you're really tired, it's hard
[1:19:24] to enter into the presence of God.
[1:19:27] If you're really, if your mind's racing,
[1:19:31] if you just got done looking at 50 reels
[1:19:33] on Instagram
[1:19:35] or 500,
[1:19:38] I hit a cord there.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm not preaching against that. But
[1:19:46] you see what happens?
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; You just you you've been so involved in
[1:19:50] that, your flesh is keyed up.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts are in another place.
[1:19:57] And now when the presence of God settles
[1:19:59] down, you're just walking around there
[1:20:01] like, "Well, this was a good service.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Glad to be back to my reels."
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Gets so addictive, we go to it in
[1:20:14] church.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about cuz I'm a
[1:20:17] human being.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Right. I know what that's like. You get
[1:20:22] You get so addicted to it that you get
[1:20:24] to where you can't do it. You just you
[1:20:25] just sitting there scrolling or looking
[1:20:27] on social media and just going like that
[1:20:29] even during while the preaching's going
[1:20:30] on or something like that. I'm not
[1:20:32] rebuking your church, but do you realize
[1:20:34] that flesh is hindering you?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; So what we do when we come in the
[1:20:39] presence of God is we deny the flesh.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; We don't cater to it. We deny it.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; And we come into the house of God and we
[1:20:47] say, "Lord, I know you're going to meet
[1:20:48] me here today. I got a need in my life."
[1:20:51] You say, "Well, I don't have any needs.
[1:20:52] What about the others that are going to
[1:20:53] be sitting with you? What about the
[1:20:55] young people that need a real experience
[1:20:57] with God? What about our elders that
[1:20:58] need their healing? What about somebody
[1:21:00] that might be sitting there might be
[1:21:02] their last service that they're ever in
[1:21:03] that may be right on the brink of making
[1:21:05] a bad decision and going out and leaving
[1:21:07] the house of God, but the presence of
[1:21:09] God is there. And if you could enter in,
[1:21:11] it would help them to enter in.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; It's hard to enter in right after you
[1:21:17] had a fuss with your wife.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; It got quiet.
[1:21:26] It's hard to enter in right after you
[1:21:28] just yelled at the kids.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; We expect our kids to enter in and all
[1:21:32] you did was abuse them all morning
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; verbally. I hope not physically.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Then we expect them to enter into
[1:21:39] church.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Just preaching my heart this morning. Do
[1:21:47] we realize that every time he comes
[1:21:51] something good happens if we could just
[1:21:52] get beyond the veil of flesh to enter
[1:21:54] into that presence?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; See what would it feel like this morning
[1:22:02] if you could come to a presence of God
[1:22:05] that could be seen. If you could come to
[1:22:07] that, if you knew that he was somewhere
[1:22:09] and you could go to that and he could be
[1:22:12] seen, I think all of us would pack up
[1:22:13] and go wherever that was,
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; right? If if there was a presence of God
[1:22:19] would settle down in a visible way, we
[1:22:21] we would all want to be there
[1:22:24] and and I understand that. But what if
[1:22:27] you could see through eyes of faith this
[1:22:29] morning? 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and:e 7
[1:22:32] says if the ministration of death
[1:22:34] written and engraved in stones was
[1:22:36] glorious. He's talking about the law. He
[1:22:37] said so that the children of Israel
[1:22:39] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[1:22:41] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[1:22:43] which glory was to be done away. In
[1:22:45] other words is only temporary. How shall
[1:22:48] not the ministration of the spirit be
[1:22:49] rather glorious? For if the ministration
[1:22:52] of the condemnation be glory, much more
[1:22:54] the ministration of righteousness
[1:22:56] exceeding glory. For even that which was
[1:22:59] made glorious had no glory in this
[1:23:01] respect by reason of the glory that
[1:23:02] excelth. For that which is done away was
[1:23:05] glorious. So in other words, in
[1:23:07] comparison to what we have now,
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Paul's saying that wasn't even glorious
[1:23:12] at all when they could see the pillar of
[1:23:14] fire sitting over the tabernacle. He
[1:23:16] said that was not even as glorious as
[1:23:19] this is.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is the glory that
[1:23:23] excelth. For if that which is done away
[1:23:24] was glorious, much more that which
[1:23:26] remainth is glorious. Seeing then we
[1:23:28] have such hope. We use great plainness
[1:23:30] of speech, not as Moses, which put a
[1:23:32] veil over his face, that the children of
[1:23:34] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[1:23:36] end of that which is abolished. Other
[1:23:38] words, they could not see who God really
[1:23:40] was. They could not understand what the
[1:23:42] end result would be. They just knew to
[1:23:44] to please God, they had to do certain
[1:23:46] things. But this morning, you and I
[1:23:48] cannot please God in the flesh. But we
[1:23:50] found that the end of it, the end of the
[1:23:52] commandment was righteousness and love
[1:23:54] and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:57] Amen. But their minds were blinded for
[1:24:00] until this day remain at the same veil
[1:24:02] and taken away in the reading of the Old
[1:24:04] Testament, which veil is done away in
[1:24:05] Christ. But even until this day when
[1:24:08] Moses is read, the veil is upon their
[1:24:10] heart. Nevertheless, when it shall turn
[1:24:11] to the Lord, oh, I'm so glad there's
[1:24:14] hope even for the Jewish nation, at
[1:24:15] least for 144,000 that are elect, the
[1:24:18] veil should be taken away. Now, the Lord
[1:24:21] is that spirit. Where the spirit of the
[1:24:23] Lord is, there is liberty. But we all
[1:24:25] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:24:28] the glory of the Lord.
[1:24:31] Do you realize what he's saying?
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; With an unveiled face. We're looking
[1:24:36] right at the glory of the Lord in a
[1:24:38] mirror.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; That's what the word glass in the King
[1:24:44] James means. A mirror.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You know what that means?
[1:24:50] We are looking.
[1:24:53] Oh god.
[1:24:55] You can't see it by natural eyes because
[1:24:57] when you look in a mirror by natural
[1:24:58] eyes, you don't look too good. Well, I
[1:25:00] don't.
[1:25:04] I look by natural eyes and I see a man
[1:25:06] getting old,
[1:25:11] getting weaker and weaker every day. You
[1:25:12] say that's not true. Well, once you pass
[1:25:14] 21, you start to die.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; You're going downhill. But JT's known me
[1:25:20] since I was younger than 21, so he
[1:25:22] knows.
[1:25:24] We're going downhill.
[1:25:27] Oh, church. Looking in a mirror. I might
[1:25:31] look at myself said, "You got a lot to
[1:25:32] do." Brother Brandon looked at himself
[1:25:34] and said, "I" He said, "I better do
[1:25:35] something for God."
[1:25:39] That was when he was laying there, you
[1:25:40] remember? And he was transported beyond
[1:25:42] the curtain of time.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I saw millions beyond the curtain of
[1:25:46] time that said, he said, "I preached the
[1:25:47] same thing that Paul preached. He said,
[1:25:48] "We're resting on that."
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; But he was laying there looking at
[1:25:52] himself and saying, "I haven't done
[1:25:53] enough for the Lord."
[1:25:56] So Jaden, all of us can look in a mirror
[1:25:59] looking at the natural and not see the
[1:26:01] glory of God. But if you could just look
[1:26:04] at the spiritual,
[1:26:06] if you could see by faith your future in
[1:26:10] the mirror, what are you looking at?
[1:26:12] You're saying, "I've been baptized with
[1:26:14] the Holy Ghost. I've been saved. Saved
[1:26:16] from sin. I've been brought into the
[1:26:18] kingdom of God. And as I behold in a
[1:26:21] glass the glory of the Lord in a mirror.
[1:26:23] The word is like a mirror that we look
[1:26:25] at when we behold it. When we look at
[1:26:27] it, we see Christ. But as we see Christ
[1:26:30] in the mirror, if you can see by faith,
[1:26:32] not see yourself. If you can see beyond
[1:26:34] the veil of the flesh and see the the
[1:26:35] anointing, the shakina of the word.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? If you can look
[1:26:40] beyond it, you are changed into the same
[1:26:42] image from glory to glory. from from the
[1:26:45] glory of the law to the glory of grace.
[1:26:47] From the glory oh come on church from
[1:26:49] the glory of justification to
[1:26:51] sanctification to the baptism of the
[1:26:52] Holy Ghost. From glory to glory until
[1:26:54] you leave here
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; even as by the spirit of the Lord.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; You may not see it by natural eyes.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; When you enter in by faith, you feel his
[1:27:05] presence. Brother Brandon described that
[1:27:06] presence as warm,
[1:27:09] sweet, humble,
[1:27:12] welcome.
[1:27:16] He would talked to people many times and
[1:27:18] I'm just kind of rushing through this,
[1:27:20] but you can go back and find it.
[1:27:23] He said, "It's his presence." He said,
[1:27:25] "Don't be afraid. It's his presence."
[1:27:27] Now, you have a real strange odd kind of
[1:27:29] sweet, humble-like feeling. Standing in
[1:27:32] the presence of a man wouldn't make you
[1:27:33] feel that way. I mean, you ever seen
[1:27:36] that light? That pillar of fire was
[1:27:37] taken right here in Texas. First time,
[1:27:39] second time, it's hanging right by the
[1:27:40] woman, seeing this dimension now. Again,
[1:27:44] brother Brandon, another place said,
[1:27:45] "Oh, that blessed sweetness coming up
[1:27:48] near the bush now. Feel the effects of
[1:27:51] the fire on the bush. The Holy Spirit
[1:27:53] warming our souls to face. So, we're not
[1:27:55] trying to work you up. Not trying to get
[1:27:58] you to a fever pitch so that you can
[1:28:00] make a decision for Christ, but we're
[1:28:03] just trying to get out of the way
[1:28:05] so that the presence of God can manifest
[1:28:08] itself by the preaching of the word.
[1:28:10] Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the
[1:28:12] word of God. When the word is preached,
[1:28:15] what happens? It brings you in the
[1:28:17] presence of deity.
[1:28:19] Oh church, do we I'm not saying that
[1:28:22] because I'm preaching this morning. It
[1:28:23] wouldn't matter who was behind the
[1:28:25] pulpit.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; As I stand here at the as a pastor, I
[1:28:31] preach so many sermons that I feel like
[1:28:33] I love it when somebody else preaches.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; I like to hear preaching. So it don't
[1:28:38] matter who's standing up here, but when
[1:28:39] it's the word of God that's being
[1:28:41] preached and not a man's emotions or a
[1:28:43] man's sensation or a man just just just
[1:28:46] reflecting himself. But a man preaching
[1:28:49] the word, when he preaches the word,
[1:28:51] what does it do? It brings our hearts to
[1:28:53] faith. And when we believe, we can enter
[1:28:57] into the presence of God.
[1:28:59] Brother Brandon says it this way. Have
[1:29:01] you forgotten about dinner? Oh no.
[1:29:04] Every time I bring it up, people get
[1:29:05] hungry.
[1:29:09] or have dinner after church. Y'all are
[1:29:10] welcome to eat with us, whoever wants
[1:29:12] to. But have you forgotten about it?
[1:29:15] Something about being in his presence
[1:29:16] makes you forget about those things.
[1:29:18] Have you forgotten whether the kids are
[1:29:20] all right out in the car or not?
[1:29:24] That stresses me out, him even saying
[1:29:26] that. Kids out there by themselves.
[1:29:31] Have you forgotten all about the past
[1:29:34] and realize what that is you're feeling
[1:29:37] right now? It's materializing before you
[1:29:40] day by day. Let that be the center of
[1:29:43] whatever. Let the rest of the things go
[1:29:44] away. They're going to perish anyhow.
[1:29:46] Oh, just keep following after him. As
[1:29:48] Elisha followed Elijah, let's follow him
[1:29:50] for we must be taken up too someday.
[1:29:53] We've seen the chariot of fire that
[1:29:55] lifted him out of the grave. We feel it
[1:29:57] among us now. What do you feel this
[1:29:59] morning, church? I'm not trying to hype
[1:30:00] up your emotion. I'm trying to make you
[1:30:02] understand.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Tell Brother Ben, you preach
[1:30:06] passionately. I do that because I feel
[1:30:08] passionately about it.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; I don't do that just to do it. But if I
[1:30:13] don't believe it, you won't believe it.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; But we seen the chariot of fire. We feel
[1:30:19] it among us someday.
[1:30:22] We should not discount what we feel in
[1:30:25] the presence of God.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:30:29] Moses took off his shoes and said, "I'm
[1:30:32] a man that can't speak."
[1:30:35] Paul
[1:30:36] fell on the ground and the Bible said he
[1:30:39] was trembling and astonished
[1:30:41] in the presence of God. Why? By faith,
[1:30:44] they saw what that was. They recognized
[1:30:47] what it was. It didn't do much for the
[1:30:51] people that were with Paul, but it did a
[1:30:53] lot for Paul.
[1:30:57] church.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; We feel it among us now. Someday he's
[1:30:59] going to unhook the horses for I love
[1:31:01] that image.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; It's as though we're already ready to go
[1:31:04] home. We're already loaded up in that
[1:31:06] same pillar of fire where that it's in
[1:31:08] our souls. The the the the chariot that
[1:31:11] we're riding into heaven in is just
[1:31:12] hooked to the bushes.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Someday we're going up. He's referencing
[1:31:17] Elijah's chariot of fire.
[1:31:20] Look at the day we're living in. What's
[1:31:21] promised for this day? Where are we?
[1:31:23] pillar of fire moves. The children of
[1:31:24] Israel are moved with the pillar of
[1:31:25] fire. We got to move with the word.
[1:31:27] Brand talked about how the people were
[1:31:28] getting so slothful.
[1:31:30] I'm not here to beat you over the head
[1:31:32] this morning, but he said that shows
[1:31:33] where the people's hearts are. You can
[1:31:34] tell them these things are wrong. They
[1:31:36] think you're crazy. Lovers of pleasure.
[1:31:38] The Bible said more than lovers of God.
[1:31:40] He said, "But the greatest pleasure I
[1:31:41] know of is to be to pray until I can
[1:31:43] realize I'm in the presence of God and
[1:31:45] recognize it." He said, "I think that
[1:31:47] ought to be the thrill of the church is
[1:31:48] the presence of the Holy Spirit. Seeing
[1:31:50] the God that made the promise standing
[1:31:52] among us. Feel his presence. See his
[1:31:54] word. See it vindicated that ought to
[1:31:55] give faith to make cripples walk. Blind
[1:31:57] see deaf hear dumb speak.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And he talks about how the gifts of God
[1:32:03] are not something that's just played
[1:32:04] with. The gifts of God are gracious and
[1:32:05] they're weary. They're wear.
[1:32:08] And the presence of God is not shouting.
[1:32:10] The presence of God, that's just God's
[1:32:11] blessings. That's the effects of his
[1:32:13] presence. But that's not the presence of
[1:32:15] God. Presence of God is a troublesome
[1:32:17] thing. Listen, when you feel the
[1:32:20] presence of God, the first thing you
[1:32:22] might think is, "Oh, woe, it's me."
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Listen, look at Isaiah in the temple.
[1:32:33] He come in the temple because he's
[1:32:34] troubled by the things that had happened
[1:32:36] with the king Uzziah. He walks into the
[1:32:38] temple that day in Isaiah chapter 6. And
[1:32:40] the Bible said he saw the Lord high and
[1:32:42] lifted up.
[1:32:44] Can you see him that way this morning by
[1:32:46] eyes of faith? I am lifted up. Yes, sir.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; His train filled the temple. The
[1:32:52] cherubam flew crying holy, holy, holy to
[1:32:54] the Lord. Can you see that in your in
[1:32:57] your mind's eye this morning? Can you
[1:32:59] see him fly them flying in the presence
[1:33:02] of God? Isaiah entered into that
[1:33:04] presence and when he did, he said, "Woe,
[1:33:06] it's me.
[1:33:08] I'm a man of unclean lips. I dwell among
[1:33:10] a people of unclean lips."
[1:33:13] Oh, but I'm so glad that the cherubam
[1:33:15] went and took the tongs from the altar
[1:33:16] and picked up a coal and brought it to
[1:33:18] his lips and cleansed his lips.
[1:33:22] And he said, "Who will go and speak? Who
[1:33:24] will go for us?" And and Isaiah said,
[1:33:27] "Here am I. Send me." It inspired him to
[1:33:30] service. Listen, he was there all the
[1:33:32] time. He would Isaiah was a prophet. He
[1:33:35] knew the presence of God. But at that
[1:33:36] moment, it inspired something in him
[1:33:38] that he would it would always be there.
[1:33:40] Sometimes he comes in a special way to
[1:33:43] anoint our faith to show us that he's
[1:33:45] still God. He's still the same
[1:33:46] yesterday, today, and forever. Well, I
[1:33:48] trust that somebody this morning would
[1:33:50] have their burning bush experience.
[1:33:52] Maybe you serve God halfway. Maybe
[1:33:54] you've given it half of it. Half of what
[1:33:56] you got, and you just given a a short of
[1:33:58] an effort, but not all of it. I pray
[1:34:00] that this morning the Moses was 80 years
[1:34:02] old when the pillar of fire got a hold
[1:34:04] of him. I pray that same fire would get
[1:34:06] a hold of you this morning that you
[1:34:08] would recognize he's still God. It is
[1:34:10] something for you to do.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; We have not been called to just sit
[1:34:15] still.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; He has come to anoint our faith to get
[1:34:19] us to do something.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; As I was listening, as we're closing
[1:34:27] this morning,
[1:34:29] I was watching part of Brother Biscll's
[1:34:32] testimony.
[1:34:34] We'd been with Brother Brandham and he
[1:34:36] just passed away on Wednesday.
[1:34:39] And some of you watched it. I actually
[1:34:40] shared it.
[1:34:42] But it was
[1:34:45] he talked about being on the log with
[1:34:46] brother Bham and he had three questions.
[1:34:48] Brother Brandham told him what they
[1:34:49] were.
[1:34:51] Answered those questions. But he also
[1:34:54] talked about being in a car and they're
[1:34:57] hunting.
[1:34:59] See, I'm not totally against hunting.
[1:35:03] I'm not much of a hunter, but I
[1:35:07] I'm gonna try to identify with some of
[1:35:08] y'all and grow a beard. We'll see how
[1:35:09] that goes.
[1:35:16] But, you know, I know that people here
[1:35:18] love to hunt, men of the wilderness, but
[1:35:21] they were hunting. And
[1:35:23] brother Eddie said that brother Brandon
[1:35:26] was in the car and the and the spirit of
[1:35:28] the Lord came down. He said that same
[1:35:29] pillar of fire
[1:35:31] came down right in the car.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; You realize how that would change our
[1:35:36] lives if we could in ordinary moments
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; recognize the presence of God.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; And and it's it's one thing and brother
[1:35:45] Bisl wouldn't have this as part of his
[1:35:47] testimony. But it's one thing to for the
[1:35:49] prophet to feel it. It's another thing
[1:35:51] for brother Bisll to recognize it
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; because if you listen to that testimony,
[1:35:55] there was somebody else in the car,
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; but it didn't maybe affect them in the
[1:35:59] same way.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; But brother Bisc was in the car and he
[1:36:05] said, "Brother Brandon, his face
[1:36:07] changed. He's leaning back." Brother
[1:36:08] Brandon was driving and just under the
[1:36:10] influence of that presence. And you can
[1:36:12] go listen to the whole testimony. But as
[1:36:14] he's driving, a moose stepped out in
[1:36:16] front of him on the gravel road they
[1:36:17] were on in Canada. a moose stepped out
[1:36:19] in front of him. Eddie hunted at that
[1:36:21] time to have food for his family. He
[1:36:24] needed that moose. And so he he said,
[1:36:27] "Brother Brand, that's a moose that I
[1:36:29] need for my family." He said, "Let me
[1:36:31] jump out and and kill it." And he said
[1:36:33] he was afraid because even though it was
[1:36:34] a gravel road, it was the major highway
[1:36:36] to Alaska. And he was afraid that that
[1:36:39] there was uh that somebody would come
[1:36:42] along and get that moose. He said the
[1:36:44] moose, he said, stopped right in its
[1:36:46] tracks. He said he got closer to wild
[1:36:48] game than he'd ever been
[1:36:52] and he walked up into the there and he
[1:36:54] shot that moose and then he he and the
[1:36:57] other brother they drag or they dragged
[1:36:59] the moose. The moose was there in the
[1:37:00] middle of the road. He said that moose
[1:37:01] walked just far enough to get off of the
[1:37:03] road
[1:37:05] fall behind the log.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; Now we don't think much of that, but
[1:37:10] brother Biscll is going to have to come
[1:37:11] back for it.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Right. So he would have to have it in
[1:37:14] order to have the meat for his family. I
[1:37:16] believe when we have a need, God has a
[1:37:17] way of meeting that need. You may not
[1:37:19] need a moose this morning. That'd be the
[1:37:21] last thing I need. I wouldn't know how
[1:37:22] to clean it. But I believe God can put
[1:37:23] food in the fridge. I believe God can
[1:37:25] take care of us. Do we really believe
[1:37:26] that today? He'll take you do your part.
[1:37:29] Don't forget your part. Brother Bis
[1:37:31] still had to shoot the moose. You still
[1:37:33] got to go out and work. You still got to
[1:37:34] go out and provide. But God will do his
[1:37:37] part. Maybe that's what he's waiting on
[1:37:38] is you to do your part.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; But it fell down just in the spot where
[1:37:44] he needed it.
[1:37:48] But brother, it's what brother Bren said
[1:37:49] to him next that inspired me this
[1:37:51] morning. He said, "Every time he comes,
[1:37:58] do you believe he's here this morning?"
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Every time he comes, something
[1:38:03] good happens."
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Do you believe you're a
[1:38:09] child of God today? Do you believe
[1:38:10] you're one who's recognized his
[1:38:12] presence? There may be others who don't
[1:38:13] feel it. Maybe others who can't see it.
[1:38:15] There may be others who don't look by
[1:38:17] eyes of faith. But you come with the
[1:38:18] bill this morning with eyes of faith.
[1:38:20] And you know he's here. He promised he
[1:38:22] would be here. And every time he comes,
[1:38:24] let's not take a moment in his presence
[1:38:26] for granted. Let's return our love back
[1:38:28] to him. Every time he comes, something
[1:38:31] good happens. Do you believe that he's
[1:38:33] here? His musician comes. Brotherson, a
[1:38:35] man that believes in God can see the
[1:38:36] presence of God, can feel the presence
[1:38:38] of God, sense the presence of God, and
[1:38:40] know that he's here. He's here to answer
[1:38:42] everything that he made promise for in
[1:38:44] this day. If he promised healing and he
[1:38:46] did, he's here to make an answer for
[1:38:48] that today. If he promised salvation and
[1:38:50] he did, he's here to answer that today.
[1:38:52] If there's a question in your heart,
[1:38:54] he's here to answer that question today.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; He is here. And every time he comes,
[1:39:00] something good
[1:39:02] happens.
[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:08] I want us to bow our heads for just a
[1:39:10] moment.
[1:39:11] [Music]
[1:39:18] [Music]
[1:39:22] All my life I've known it.
[1:39:26] I could feel his presence. I could sense
[1:39:27] it.
[1:39:30] I can remember as a a young child
[1:39:32] sitting in church just like you're
[1:39:34] sitting this morning.
[1:39:37] I knew I wasn't right with God.
[1:39:40] I'd grab the back of the pews and hold
[1:39:42] on,
[1:39:43] try not to go to the altar cuz I didn't
[1:39:45] want to be embarrassed.
[1:39:47] There something in my heart.
[1:39:50] Just wouldn't stop driving. Wouldn't
[1:39:52] stop pulling.
[1:39:54] I believe it was the hand of the Lord.
[1:39:57] We never sought God. He sought us.
[1:40:01] He found us.
[1:40:03] So thankful for it today.
[1:40:05] [Music]
[1:40:08] I I remember being and feeling the
[1:40:10] presence of God even as a young man.
[1:40:12] Even though maybe the situation wasn't
[1:40:14] perfect, but I knew I knew that he was
[1:40:17] there. I believe you can feel that same
[1:40:19] God today. And it's not all about
[1:40:21] feeling, but when he's here, if by faith
[1:40:25] you can believe it, then there's
[1:40:28] something about it that brings that
[1:40:29] warmth to your heart.
[1:40:32] It just John Wesley when he went to hear
[1:40:35] the Moravians preach the gospel because
[1:40:38] he'd been in that cold formal Church of
[1:40:41] England religion, he tried to do it by
[1:40:43] works and John Wesley sat there in that
[1:40:45] room and he said, "My heart was
[1:40:47] strangely warmed." Well, I pray that
[1:40:50] someone sitting here today and your
[1:40:52] heart would be strangely warmed by that
[1:40:54] same pillar of fire and you know every
[1:40:56] time he comes something good happens.
[1:41:01] I pray it would be this morning
[1:41:02] something good would happen. What do you
[1:41:04] have a need of today? Why don't you just
[1:41:06] hold that in your heart and your mind
[1:41:08] right now? Every time he comes, if you
[1:41:10] can believe that he's here, every time.
[1:41:12] He didn't die with brother Brandham. He
[1:41:14] didn't die with Brother Biscll. He's
[1:41:15] still the same God today. He's the same
[1:41:17] God. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:41:19] forever. He's the same in Brother
[1:41:21] Stewart or Brother Joel or whoever's
[1:41:22] preaching. He's the same God even among
[1:41:25] the congregation. We're not a we're not
[1:41:26] a a nican spirit. Where are people who
[1:41:29] believe in a move of God among the
[1:41:30] people? He's a God that can meet your
[1:41:32] need this morning. You hold that need in
[1:41:34] your heart. The same God, he may not he
[1:41:36] may not reveal the secret of your heart
[1:41:38] in in public like he did, but he's able
[1:41:40] to do it. He's able to reveal the secret
[1:41:43] of your heart even to you to the things
[1:41:45] that you need. We don't always know what
[1:41:47] we need to pray for, but Paul says his
[1:41:49] spirit prays for us with with with
[1:41:52] groanings that cannot be uttered. Oh, I
[1:41:54] pray you'd feel the warmth of his
[1:41:55] presence today. That it wouldn't be a
[1:41:57] work cup, but that you would know by
[1:41:58] faith, I know he's here. I know he's the
[1:42:01] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:42:03] Shake off those bonds of those shackles.
[1:42:06] You You spend so much time out of the
[1:42:08] presence of God that you just get so
[1:42:10] cold. I do it, too. I know what it feels
[1:42:13] like. But come back to the fire. Come
[1:42:16] back to the place where you can know
[1:42:17] he's there. Amen. Whatever you have need
[1:42:20] of, just hold that in your heart this
[1:42:22] morning. If you need prayer, I'd be glad
[1:42:23] to pray with you. I believe you can
[1:42:24] receive it right where you're at this
[1:42:26] morning. The presence of the Lord is
[1:42:28] here.
[1:42:30] Hallelujah.
[1:42:33] All the time.
[1:42:37] Oh, just receive it now before we pray.
[1:42:39] He was there
[1:42:42] all
[1:42:44] the time.
[1:42:46] Oh, I'm so glad you were there in my
[1:42:48] life, Lord. Waiting patiently.
[1:42:55] Oh, in life.
[1:42:58] Hallelujah. I'm glad he was there
[1:43:04] all
[1:43:06] the time. Sing him one more time before
[1:43:08] we pray now. Oh, I'm so glad he was
[1:43:11] there.
[1:43:13] Oh, glad you were there, Lord.
[1:43:16] Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so glad you're still here today,
[1:43:21] waiting patiently.
[1:43:24] Oh, thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:27] All the time.
[1:43:30] Oh, yes. He's waiting patiently
[1:43:35] [Music]
[1:43:38] in line.
[1:43:41] Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] He was there.
[1:43:46] all
[1:43:49] the time.
[1:43:51] His presence is here this morning. Just
[1:43:54] bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:43:57] oh God, we pray.
[1:44:00] Lord, we believe in the power of prayer.
[1:44:05] Lord, you said in your word that the
[1:44:07] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[1:44:08] man availth much.
[1:44:11] But you also said Elijah was a man
[1:44:13] subject to like passions as we are. Yet
[1:44:15] he prayed earnestly that it would not
[1:44:17] rain and it didn't rain for three years.
[1:44:20] Oh God. Oh, we still believe you're the
[1:44:23] God of Elijah. You're still here today,
[1:44:26] Lord. I'm not righteous by my own works,
[1:44:28] but by your blood. These people are not
[1:44:30] righteous by their own works, but by
[1:44:31] your blood, Lord. And we call on your
[1:44:33] name today. We call on the name of
[1:44:35] Jehovah and Tyra. We call on that same
[1:44:37] God, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:44:39] forever. that he would be a reality in
[1:44:41] our midst. We're not here to play
[1:44:43] church. We're not here just to have
[1:44:44] another service. Lord, may you be a
[1:44:46] reality. May the word be so clear when
[1:44:49] we hear it, Lord, that revelation would
[1:44:51] strike our hearts. If we have questions,
[1:44:53] Lord, I pray that be answered in your
[1:44:55] presence. If we have a need, Lord, I
[1:44:57] pray it be met in your presence today.
[1:44:59] Oh, we're so thankful, Lord. I pray
[1:45:01] you'd break every spirit of doubt, every
[1:45:03] spirit of fear, every spirit of
[1:45:05] depression that would try to come. I
[1:45:06] pray God that you move right now, Lord,
[1:45:08] in a mighty way, God, as only you can,
[1:45:11] Lord Jesus, we believe that you're here
[1:45:13] and by faith we receive you today in
[1:45:16] Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:45:19] Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.

[1:45:33] the time.
[1:45:35] Aren't you glad that he was? Oh, waiting
[1:45:39] patiently
[1:45:45] in line.
[1:45:48] Hallelujah.
