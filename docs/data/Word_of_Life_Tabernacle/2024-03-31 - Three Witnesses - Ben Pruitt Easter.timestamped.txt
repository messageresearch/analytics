[55:19] do you love the Lord this
[55:20] morning let's turn to Matthew
[55:25] 18:16
[55:28] it's kind of a maybe an odd scripture to
[55:31] be our Easter scripture but I want to
[55:34] speak to you this morning on three
[55:37] Witnesses three
[55:48] Witnesses he says but if he will not
[55:50] hear thee then take with thee one or two
[55:54] more that in the mouth of two or three
[55:57] someone say two or
[55:59] three two or three Witnesses every word
[56:04] may be established I pray the Lord would
[56:06] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[56:10] seated in the mouth of two or
[56:13] three
[56:15] witnesses to be a witness in the Old
[56:18] Testament and during bible times to be a
[56:21] witness of something was a sacred thing
[56:24] it meant that you had seen it and you
[56:28] would be a faithful witness to tell what
[56:31] you saw to not embellish it to not add
[56:33] to it but to actually say what you saw
[56:38] on on that event and so there was a
[56:41] great curse that was given to uh false
[56:44] Witnesses in fact it was seen as one of
[56:47] the things that God hates is a false
[56:50] witness and I I believe that's still
[56:52] true today we should always tell the
[56:54] truth someone said if you uh if you tell
[56:57] the truth you don't have to tell the
[56:58] story uh you don't have to tell the
[57:00] story different way or or try to
[57:02] remember it it'll always be true and the
[57:04] truth will always be true so we know
[57:08] that there were many witnesses of the
[57:10] death burial and resurrection of Christ
[57:13] and and we know that that event what
[57:15] we're honoring today and why we gather
[57:18] together on Sunday mornings we're
[57:20] honoring the resurrection of Christ and
[57:23] in doing that we're honoring the most
[57:25] pivotal event
[57:26] in world history it's the greatest thing
[57:29] that's ever happened it's why we're here
[57:32] this morning it's because of the
[57:34] resurrection of Christ that weekend
[57:36] because of what happened on that
[57:38] Passover weekend that's why that we are
[57:41] here that's why we have a message that's
[57:44] that's why we have something to preach
[57:46] it's why we have something to sing it's
[57:48] the reason for what we do and and and
[57:51] where we go and what the things that we
[57:53] uh we we hold ourselves from everything
[57:55] ties back to that
[57:58] Resurrection It's Our Hope Of Heaven
[58:02] it's our confidence in Christ it's the
[58:05] life that we live everything rests on
[58:08] the fact that he died for our sins was
[58:12] buried and raised again the third day
[58:16] now I know today we live in a day when
[58:18] people want scientific proof they they
[58:20] want proof of everything say well prove
[58:22] to me that he rose again in this message
[58:24] we we have that same problem today
[58:26] people say well prove to me that brother
[58:28] brandham did those things prove to me
[58:30] that that that it happened on Ohio River
[58:32] prove to me and I'll say this there were
[58:33] many witnesses of what happened many
[58:36] witnesses of the things that happened
[58:39] and yet people will not you cannot prove
[58:41] to them scientifically because you've
[58:43] got to believe what the witnesses say in
[58:46] order to be a believer of this message
[58:48] just like you have to believe what these
[58:50] Witnesses said in order to be a believer
[58:54] that Jesus Christ rose from the dead I
[58:56] want to say this morning and I want to
[58:58] declare with all that I have this
[59:00] morning that I believe that the
[59:02] Witnesses were true I believe that he
[59:04] raised from the dead and I believe we
[59:06] can prove it today not by scientific
[59:09] proof but by our
[59:10] lives that he did raise from the
[59:14] dead and so we honor this day now he
[59:19] rose from the dead for our sin he died
[59:21] for our sins was buried and rose again
[59:23] the third
[59:25] day
[59:26] excuse me in 1 Corinthians
[59:29] 15 if you'll turn there with me Paul is
[59:32] telling us about Witnesses of the
[59:36] Resurrection he said for I delivered
[59:38] unto you first of all that which also I
[59:40] also receive how that Christ died for
[59:43] our sins according to the scriptures in
[59:46] other words the scriptures said he would
[59:47] do it and he died in just that way his
[59:51] death fulfilled the scripture and that
[59:53] he was buried and that he rose again the
[59:56] third day according to the scriptures
[59:58] and that he was seen of sephus that's
[1:00:00] Peter Simon Peter then of the
[1:00:03] 12 and after that he was seen of above
[1:00:06] 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater
[1:00:10] part remained to this present but some
[1:00:12] are fallen asleep after that he was seen
[1:00:15] of James and of all the apostles and I
[1:00:18] love this eighth verse last of all he
[1:00:20] was seen of me
[1:00:22] also amen Paul includes himself
[1:00:26] as a witness of the Resurrection though
[1:00:29] he wasn't there during the time Jesus
[1:00:31] was walking the Earth he wasn't a
[1:00:33] Believer during the 40 days that uh that
[1:00:36] that Jesus was there uh visiting his
[1:00:39] disciples and things that he did Paul
[1:00:41] was not a Believer during that time and
[1:00:44] yet he counted himself as a witness he
[1:00:46] said I am a witness of the Resurrection
[1:00:50] he was seen by me and I want to put
[1:00:52] myself there this morning and I want to
[1:00:55] put you each one of us that have
[1:00:57] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:59] we met him too we met a risen
[1:01:01] resurrected
[1:01:03] savior yes he said he was seen of me as
[1:01:05] of one born out of due time yeah I am
[1:01:08] the least of the Apostles that I'm not
[1:01:10] meat to be called an apostle because I
[1:01:12] persecuted the Church of God but by the
[1:01:14] grace of God I am what I am how many can
[1:01:16] say Amen to that this morning every one
[1:01:18] of us can say by the grace of God I am
[1:01:21] what I am and his grace which was
[1:01:23] bestowed upon me was not in vain but
[1:01:26] labored more abundantly than they all
[1:01:28] yet not I but the grace of God which was
[1:01:30] with me therefore whether it were I or
[1:01:32] they he said so we preach and so you
[1:01:36] believed in order to be a Christian now
[1:01:39] I want to establish this point before we
[1:01:41] go on but Ry in order to be a Christian
[1:01:43] you had to believe what somebody told
[1:01:45] you about
[1:01:47] Jesus you you there had to there had to
[1:01:49] be something in you that had the
[1:01:51] capacity to believe what somebody say so
[1:01:53] don't let anybody tell you well uh these
[1:01:56] things that we believe in the message
[1:01:57] are just stories no it's all just
[1:01:59] stories if that's the way you look at it
[1:02:01] right but if you look at it as a reality
[1:02:03] it can change your life look at what it
[1:02:06] does to us look at what it does for us
[1:02:09] yes sir so I I realize then that Paul
[1:02:13] being a witness of his resurrection and
[1:02:15] all the ones that he mentioned you could
[1:02:17] say that there were hundreds perhaps
[1:02:19] even thousands of
[1:02:21] witnesses of his
[1:02:23] resurrection of the death burial
[1:02:26] and resurrection of Christ but I want to
[1:02:30] pick out three that just kind of
[1:02:32] occurred to me you said brother Ben why
[1:02:34] these three because I'm the one that
[1:02:35] gets to
[1:02:37] pick and you can pick your
[1:02:40] three but we'll let you preach after
[1:02:42] after lunch if you want to do that but
[1:02:45] we're for us you know for me this
[1:02:47] morning I I had three special witnesses
[1:02:50] that I wanted to present to you that are
[1:02:53] special to me personally because I think
[1:02:55] we can also witness in this day in a
[1:02:57] similar manner to how they witnessed and
[1:03:00] so the first witness of of the death of
[1:03:02] Christ was Simon that I want to present
[1:03:04] this morning is Simon the sirene Simon
[1:03:08] the sir that he witnessed the death of
[1:03:11] Christ he didn't intend to but he was
[1:03:14] caught up in the moment and he just
[1:03:17] happened to be there and witnessed the
[1:03:19] death of Christ and I preached to you
[1:03:22] about Simon before he means a lot to me
[1:03:25] because the lord gave me a a a message
[1:03:28] about Simon the sirene and I believe it
[1:03:31] was for me more than anybody else I
[1:03:32] preached it all over the world but but
[1:03:34] he gave that to me uh a few months
[1:03:37] before I we come over to this church and
[1:03:39] and begin working with you people and as
[1:03:41] I begin I think God was trying to tell
[1:03:44] me something you you need to just pick
[1:03:46] up the cross you need to you need to do
[1:03:48] what needs to be done and be willing to
[1:03:50] do that and God will bless it and I
[1:03:52] think every one of us we need to have
[1:03:54] that kind of a commitment Lord Lord
[1:03:56] whatever needs to be done that's what
[1:03:57] I'm willing to do let me be like Simon
[1:04:01] and be willing to carry the cross and be
[1:04:02] a witness of your death burial and
[1:04:05] Resurrection Matthew
[1:04:07] 27:22 we find that Jesus had endured six
[1:04:09] separate
[1:04:11] trials he'd been beaten spit on and
[1:04:14] abused all night long they they abused
[1:04:17] him yes and pilate in the morning he
[1:04:20] finally comes around to pilate and
[1:04:22] pilate can find no reason for him to be
[1:04:25] crucified
[1:04:26] but pilate saith unto them what shall I
[1:04:28] do then with Jesus which is called
[1:04:31] Christ because he there was their custom
[1:04:33] to release one on the Sabbath day or on
[1:04:35] the on Passover it was their custom to
[1:04:38] release one and they said let Let
[1:04:40] barabus Go free who was a murderer let
[1:04:42] him go free and he said what will I do
[1:04:45] with Jesus he they all say unto him let
[1:04:47] him be crucified yes and the governor
[1:04:50] said why what evil hath he done but they
[1:04:54] cried out the more saying let him be
[1:04:57] crucified and when pilate saw that he
[1:04:59] could Prevail nothing but that rather a
[1:05:01] tumult was made he took water and washed
[1:05:03] his hands before the multitude saying I
[1:05:06] am innocent of the blood of this just
[1:05:08] person see ye to it then answered all
[1:05:12] the people and said his blood be on us
[1:05:16] and on our
[1:05:17] children oh they paid for that over the
[1:05:20] years and yet the love of God extends so
[1:05:23] far but the bill that although the the
[1:05:25] Jewish Nation the Israel the Israel the
[1:05:28] nation of the Israelites has paid so
[1:05:30] much for what happened to that day when
[1:05:32] they said let this Blood be on us and on
[1:05:34] our children and yet there will be
[1:05:36] 144,000 elected at the end time that'll
[1:05:39] receive the message of the hour that'll
[1:05:41] be filled with the Holy Ghost under the
[1:05:43] ministry of the two
[1:05:45] prophets so we know that God is gracious
[1:05:48] how many believe he's gracious today oh
[1:05:51] you you say well I've gone too far well
[1:05:53] the Jews probably went too far by doing
[1:05:55] what they did and yet God still has
[1:05:57] Mercy why there're his people you're his
[1:06:00] people
[1:06:01] today Amen in a in a in the sense of the
[1:06:04] election of being the bride now
[1:06:07] look and and and they said let his blood
[1:06:10] be on us and then released he barabus
[1:06:12] unto them when he had scourged Jesus and
[1:06:16] that that's we bypass that word too
[1:06:19] quickly scourged him what that means is
[1:06:21] they took a cat of nine tails which is a
[1:06:23] whip with nine strands and they tied
[1:06:26] little pieces of metal little pieces of
[1:06:27] glass in the end of it and they took it
[1:06:29] and it would wrap around the leather
[1:06:31] strands would wrap around the body and
[1:06:34] when they when they RI when they did
[1:06:36] pulled it would actually rip shreds of
[1:06:39] skin off of the body many people died
[1:06:43] just from the beating alone that's why
[1:06:46] they were limited how many times that
[1:06:49] they could beat him 39 times 39 straps
[1:06:53] because just one more might kill a man
[1:06:56] and so they they actually they actually
[1:07:00] uh scourged him they beat him and he was
[1:07:03] he had been up all night he's wore out
[1:07:06] and they delivered him to be crucified
[1:07:08] and the soldiers of the governor it
[1:07:11] wasn't enough for him to beat him but
[1:07:13] they mocked him they took him into the
[1:07:16] common Hall and gathered unto him the
[1:07:17] whole band of soldiers and they stripped
[1:07:20] him and put on him a Scarlet robe now
[1:07:23] think about it a a band of soldiers they
[1:07:26] they had like a meeting and they come
[1:07:29] together for the purpose of mocking
[1:07:32] Jesus and when and when they planted a
[1:07:34] crown of thorns they put it on his head
[1:07:36] and a reed in his right hand they bowed
[1:07:38] the knee before him and mocked him
[1:07:40] saying hail King of the Jews and they
[1:07:43] spit on him and took the Reed and smote
[1:07:46] him on the head yeah now look what they
[1:07:49] were doing they were they were they were
[1:07:52] passionately mocking Christ and I know
[1:07:56] people say that we're too emotional I
[1:07:58] know they say that brother Ben you're
[1:08:00] just you're just too far out there
[1:08:01] you're too Pentecostal but if the
[1:08:04] soldiers inspired by the devil could
[1:08:07] pick up their whips and pick up and spit
[1:08:10] on him and violently accuse him and
[1:08:12] violently strike him with their hands if
[1:08:15] they could raise their voices mocking
[1:08:17] him why should I not raise my voice and
[1:08:19] saying he's worthy why should I not when
[1:08:22] when the mocking was done for me when
[1:08:24] the blood was shed for me why should I
[1:08:27] not raise my voice what's wrong with me
[1:08:30] lifting my voice to him lifting my hands
[1:08:32] to him if they could raise their voice
[1:08:34] in Anger why should I not be able to
[1:08:37] raise my voice in Praise this morning if
[1:08:40] they could grab a hold of him and th
[1:08:42] knock him down and bow before him in a
[1:08:44] mocking way let me bow the knee this
[1:08:47] morning in a great way to say Lord
[1:08:49] You're my God my Lord and my God if they
[1:08:53] could bow the knee in a mocking way let
[1:08:55] me bow the knee don't ever be afraid to
[1:08:58] worship Him Church don't ever be afraid
[1:09:01] they inspired by the devil beat him and
[1:09:03] mocked him why would I let anything get
[1:09:05] in the way of My Worship that's
[1:09:13] good they let him away after they mocked
[1:09:16] him they took the robe off of him put
[1:09:19] his own Rond on him led him away to
[1:09:23] crucify him and as they came out they
[1:09:28] found a man of
[1:09:29] sirene Simon by name him they compelled
[1:09:35] to bear his cross he didn't ask to be
[1:09:40] involved he was simply at the right
[1:09:43] Crossroads of time at the right place at
[1:09:48] the right time and when he was compelled
[1:09:50] to carry the cross it changed his life
[1:09:54] forever
[1:09:56] amen he was a witness to the death of
[1:09:58] Christ on the cross he actually carried
[1:10:02] the instrument of torture up the hill of
[1:10:05] golgatha he felt the weight of that but
[1:10:10] jesus carried the sins of the whole
[1:10:13] world and I I'll say to you this morning
[1:10:17] if he could carry the weight of my sin
[1:10:19] on him then I'll be willing to carry the
[1:10:22] weight of my cross if my cross is
[1:10:24] preaching if my cross say it maybe I'm
[1:10:26] going through a a hard time or a trial
[1:10:28] let me go through that let me carry that
[1:10:32] if I I can surely carry the weight of a
[1:10:35] piece of wood brother Joel I can surely
[1:10:37] carry the weight of showing up at church
[1:10:39] I can surely carry the weight of being
[1:10:41] an example to my children I can surely
[1:10:43] carry the weight of dressing like a
[1:10:45] Christian of acting like a Christian if
[1:10:48] you Carri the weight of my sins I can
[1:10:50] carry the
[1:10:51] weight of the
[1:10:53] Cross amen
[1:10:56] oh
[1:11:00] my excuse me for being a baby just makes
[1:11:02] me want to weep this morning think of
[1:11:05] what he did for
[1:11:07] me when they were come to a place called
[1:11:10] gotha it us to say a place of a skull
[1:11:14] they gave him vinegar to drink mingled
[1:11:15] with G and when he had tasted thereof he
[1:11:18] would not drink Simon was
[1:11:21] watching as they did all of this he was
[1:11:23] a
[1:11:24] witness They Crucified him and parted
[1:11:26] his garments casting lots that it might
[1:11:29] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:11:30] prophet they parted my garments among
[1:11:33] them upon my vesture did they cast lots
[1:11:36] and sitting down they watched him there
[1:11:38] and set up over his head his accusation
[1:11:40] written this is Jesus king of the Jews
[1:11:46] Simon perhaps watching him from the
[1:11:47] crowd heard him cry I thirst yes they
[1:11:51] watched as they put a reed with vinegar
[1:11:54] in it to his face he wouldn't refuse to
[1:11:56] drink of it and they watched and he
[1:11:59] cried he watched and he cried and said
[1:12:01] it is finished and when he said it is
[1:12:04] finished what was finished was all the
[1:12:07] payment that would ever be that of all
[1:12:09] the separation that would ever separate
[1:12:12] an unrighteous people from a holy God
[1:12:15] the breach was made up the G the Gap was
[1:12:18] closed and we were able to go back to
[1:12:21] Heaven
[1:12:22] Again Hallelujah what happened to Simon
[1:12:27] we'll talk a little bit more about it
[1:12:28] later but he become a
[1:12:30] Christian his sons Rufus and Alexander
[1:12:33] the Bible tells us were well-known
[1:12:34] disciples in the early church his story
[1:12:37] impacted his people for Generations he's
[1:12:39] a witness of the death of Christ and his
[1:12:43] lifechanging power the second witness
[1:12:46] that I want to bring up this morning is
[1:12:49] one called Mary
[1:12:51] Magdalene Mary was one of Jesus helpers
[1:12:54] and Luke 8 verse1 says it came to pass
[1:12:57] afterward that he went throughout every
[1:12:59] city and Village preaching and showing
[1:13:01] the Glad Tidings of the kingdom of God
[1:13:04] and the twel were with him and certain
[1:13:06] women which had been healed of evil
[1:13:08] spirits and infirmities Mary called
[1:13:11] Magdalene out of whom went Seven Devils
[1:13:14] and Joanna the wife of Chua Herod
[1:13:16] Stewart and Suzanna many others which
[1:13:19] ministered unto him of their substance
[1:13:22] in other words they followed the
[1:13:23] disciples around they gave them food and
[1:13:25] and maybe money that when they needed it
[1:13:27] they give them clothes what was it why
[1:13:30] did they do what they did why was she a
[1:13:32] Helper because she loved the Lord
[1:13:35] because he she had been delivered of
[1:13:38] Seven
[1:13:39] Devils I think if you've been delivered
[1:13:41] this morning you don't try to hinder
[1:13:43] God's people you're there to be a help
[1:13:45] to God's people you want to see the body
[1:13:48] of Christ help like Simon when the body
[1:13:50] of Christ was weak Simon carried the
[1:13:52] cross and when Jesus needed maybe his
[1:13:54] clothes was mened when he needed
[1:13:56] something Mary Magdalene was there oh
[1:13:58] she had a past but he was her future she
[1:14:02] had a past she had had Seven Devils but
[1:14:04] she knew what it was like to be
[1:14:05] delivered so it didn't make her dead and
[1:14:07] formal it caused her to want to help all
[1:14:09] she
[1:14:11] could why she'd been delivered yeah she
[1:14:14] didn't want to be a hindrance she wanted
[1:14:16] to be a help right she loved the Lord
[1:14:19] she'd been delivered I think we could
[1:14:21] all say Amen to that this morning I've
[1:14:23] been delivered and so I love him cuz he
[1:14:25] first loved me she was at
[1:14:30] crucifixion Matthew
[1:14:32] 27:55 any women were there beholding a
[1:14:35] far off which followed Jesus From
[1:14:37] Galilee ministering unto him among which
[1:14:40] was Mary Magdalene Mary the mother of
[1:14:42] James and Joseph and the mother of zeb's
[1:14:46] children listen Mary knew he was
[1:14:50] dead she knew he was
[1:14:54] dead oh
[1:14:56] Church she she saw him die yeah she not
[1:15:00] only knew that he was dead but she had
[1:15:02] firsthand knowledge that they buried him
[1:15:06] right Matthew 27:57 when the evening was
[1:15:09] come there came a rich man of arthea
[1:15:12] named Joseph who also himself was Jesus
[1:15:14] disciple he went to pilate and begged
[1:15:17] the body of Jesus then pilot commanded
[1:15:19] the body to be delivered and when Joseph
[1:15:21] had taken the body he wrapped it in a
[1:15:23] clean linen cloth and he laed in his own
[1:15:25] new tomb which he had hun out in the
[1:15:27] Rock and he rolled a great Stone to the
[1:15:29] door of the separ and departed and there
[1:15:32] was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
[1:15:36] sitting over against the
[1:15:38] separ they followed him to the tomb they
[1:15:42] watched as his body was wrapped and laid
[1:15:46] inside the tomb and they watched the men
[1:15:49] grab the stone and roll it over the tomb
[1:15:52] if anybody knew that Jesus was in the
[1:15:54] Tomb tomb it was
[1:15:58] Mary and you say why would God have her
[1:16:01] there if she was to be a
[1:16:03] witness of his inment so she could be a
[1:16:06] witness of his resurrection you see you
[1:16:09] realize many times the things you go
[1:16:10] through you don't know why you had to go
[1:16:12] through what you went through but you
[1:16:14] had to be a witness of his in tement so
[1:16:16] you could be a witness of his
[1:16:18] resurrection I've had to be a witness of
[1:16:20] some things I wish I hadn't seen i' I've
[1:16:22] had to be a witness of times in my life
[1:16:24] when I wasn't all I should have been
[1:16:25] brother Joe but I know this I was a
[1:16:27] witness of when he was in Tomb I was a
[1:16:30] witness when he wasn't raised in my life
[1:16:31] but I am a witness today of his
[1:16:35] Resurrection Mary was a witness he was
[1:16:40] dead he didn't just go to sleep for a
[1:16:43] while but he was dead and he was buried
[1:16:46] in a borrowed
[1:16:48] tomb Hallelujah but he wouldn't need it
[1:16:50] for long that's right
[1:16:53] amen
[1:16:59] why do we bury our dead just as an aside
[1:17:02] you think about that for a minute it's
[1:17:03] because of the hope of the
[1:17:05] Resurrection that's why we perform
[1:17:08] burials I know some and there's nothing
[1:17:11] against the word when if you have a
[1:17:12] cremation that's not what I'm saying the
[1:17:14] reason traditionally We buried our dead
[1:17:17] along with the Jews is because we
[1:17:18] believe they're com into life
[1:17:21] again but I want you to know for
[1:17:23] thousands of years everybody
[1:17:25] who was buried stayed there we have
[1:17:28] instances of people raised from the dead
[1:17:30] prior to burial but nobody come out of a
[1:17:33] grave until Jesus come on the
[1:17:36] earth
[1:17:38] amen hallelujah and the first one to
[1:17:42] walk out again to be restored back to
[1:17:44] their old body out of a grave to to take
[1:17:47] a human form again oh oh God was Lazarus
[1:17:51] when Jesus told Mary listen Martha said
[1:17:54] to him I know that he raised again in
[1:17:56] the resurrection of the last day and
[1:17:58] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:18:00] resurrection and the life he that
[1:18:02] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:18:04] shall he live and after corruption it
[1:18:07] already set
[1:18:08] in Lazarus had already his nose had
[1:18:11] already caved in he was already by this
[1:18:13] time he said they said he
[1:18:14] stinks the worms have begun to destroy
[1:18:17] his body and yet it was at that moment
[1:18:20] that the scripture was fulfilled amen
[1:18:22] that the Redeemer stood there and he
[1:18:24] said Lazarus come
[1:18:26] forth when he did a man who had been
[1:18:29] dead 4 days walked out like he'd never
[1:18:33] died amen now look he raised Lazarus
[1:18:38] after corruption but there was promised
[1:18:40] one who had raised before corruption
[1:18:41] said him Psalm 16:10 for thou will not
[1:18:44] leave my soul in Hell Nei Willl thou
[1:18:46] suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
[1:18:48] Mary magdaline and Mary the mother of
[1:18:49] Joseph beheld where he was laid Mark
[1:18:52] 15:47 they beheld where he was laid they
[1:18:55] were there they seen him they saw him
[1:18:59] die they saw him laid in in the grave
[1:19:02] the stone Rod across the
[1:19:04] door Mark 16:9 now when Jesus was risen
[1:19:08] early the first day of the
[1:19:11] week look I love this I absolutely love
[1:19:15] the fact that he didn't appear to the
[1:19:17] disciples CU they didn't have enough
[1:19:22] Faith right they just said that was just
[1:19:25] a
[1:19:25] dream that just an emotional experience
[1:19:28] all
[1:19:31] right but Mary out of whom had been
[1:19:33] delivered Seven
[1:19:35] Devils was the first one at the
[1:19:38] two and the first one to see he even hid
[1:19:42] himself from Peter and John when they
[1:19:45] were there though he appears privately
[1:19:47] to Peter later and then to the disciples
[1:19:49] but he hid himself from Peter and John
[1:19:52] while they were there they could didn't
[1:19:54] see him but Mary remained oh my you know
[1:19:58] sometimes we linger in the service say
[1:19:59] why why do you linger why do you worship
[1:20:01] because sometimes good things happen to
[1:20:03] people who remain in the in the presence
[1:20:06] of a resurrected
[1:20:09] Christ amen now look when Jesus was
[1:20:13] risen early the first day of the week he
[1:20:15] appeared first to Mary Magdalene John
[1:20:16] chapter 20 and verse one the first day
[1:20:19] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early
[1:20:21] when it was yet dark unto the septier
[1:20:23] and seeth the stone
[1:20:25] taken away from the Seiler then she
[1:20:28] runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to
[1:20:32] the other disciple whom Jesus loved and
[1:20:34] saith unto them they have taken away the
[1:20:37] Lord out of the septier and we know not
[1:20:40] where they have laid
[1:20:42] him Peter therefore went forth and that
[1:20:45] other disciple I love the way John
[1:20:46] describes
[1:20:47] himself and came to the Seer so they ran
[1:20:51] both together and the other disciple did
[1:20:53] outrun Peter
[1:20:56] interesting note that's the way I'd have
[1:20:58] written it
[1:20:59] too and came first to The Seer and he
[1:21:03] stooping down looking in saw the linen
[1:21:05] clothes lying yet went he not in and
[1:21:07] come and Simon Peter following him went
[1:21:09] into the Seer and seeth the linen
[1:21:11] clothes lie and the napkin that was
[1:21:13] about his head not lying with the linen
[1:21:15] clothes but wrapped together in a place
[1:21:17] by itself oh my listen he did not he was
[1:21:21] preparing he was saying I'll be back am
[1:21:24] he did not appear when they were all
[1:21:27] there he waited on
[1:21:29] Mary but Mary stood without at the
[1:21:32] septier Weeping yeah John and Peter went
[1:21:34] home in the meantime and she stood there
[1:21:37] weeping and as she wept she stooped down
[1:21:39] and looked into the SRE and see two
[1:21:41] angels in white sitting one at the head
[1:21:43] the other at the feet where the body of
[1:21:45] Jesus had Lin and they say unto her
[1:21:47] woman why weepest thou she saith unto
[1:21:50] them because they have taken away my
[1:21:52] Lord and I know not where they have laid
[1:21:53] him listen the the knowledge of an empty
[1:21:55] tomb was not enough to take away your
[1:21:58] grief listen to me this morning the
[1:22:00] knowledge of an empty tomb is not enough
[1:22:02] to take away your grief it's the
[1:22:04] knowledge of the presence of a risen
[1:22:06] living
[1:22:07] savior GL to God many people know or
[1:22:11] think they know that the tomb is empty
[1:22:13] but we know a present resurrected Jesus
[1:22:15] who's the same yesterday today and
[1:22:18] forever yes hey man he said I don't
[1:22:22] they've taken my Lord
[1:22:26] and I don't know not where they've laid
[1:22:27] him when she had said thus she turned
[1:22:29] herself back and saw Jesus standing and
[1:22:32] knew not that it was Jesus and Jesus
[1:22:36] saith unto her woman why weepest thou
[1:22:39] whom seekest thou she supposing him to
[1:22:42] be the gardener saith un him sir if thou
[1:22:45] had borne him hence tell me where thou
[1:22:47] has laid him and I will take him
[1:22:51] away Jesus saith unto her
[1:22:55] Mary she didn't recognize his form that
[1:22:58] he' taken but she recognized his
[1:23:02] voice oh Church in this age I didn't
[1:23:05] recognize immediately the form he had
[1:23:08] taken in his body of the Bride but I
[1:23:10] recognize his voice when he spoke it was
[1:23:13] more than a voice of a man it's a voice
[1:23:15] of God right I'm not talking about a
[1:23:17] prophet's physical voice I'm talking
[1:23:19] about the message of the hour I'm
[1:23:20] talking about your voice I'm talking
[1:23:23] about the final voice to the fin final
[1:23:24] age is
[1:23:27] Christ
[1:23:29] amen Jesus said Mary she turned
[1:23:33] herself saith unto him raboni was just
[1:23:37] to say
[1:23:40] master listen she was a witness to all
[1:23:42] of it and the very first witness of his
[1:23:49] resurrection amen I want to call to your
[1:23:53] memory another
[1:23:55] witness bring him to the stand this
[1:23:57] morning if you will Peter the
[1:24:02] Apostle now Simon carried the
[1:24:07] cross Mary waited by the tomb but Peter
[1:24:12] did everything
[1:24:15] wrong you ever thought about Peter that
[1:24:17] weekend he did not equit himself
[1:24:20] well sorry Peter come on good come on he
[1:24:25] did he stood there at the he did he
[1:24:28] messed up everything he did he did
[1:24:33] wrong he go he starts rebuking Jesus and
[1:24:37] Jesus has to tell him get behind me
[1:24:39] Jesus tries to wash his feet and he gets
[1:24:42] all messed up
[1:24:43] doctrinally say what you need to wash
[1:24:45] all of me becomes a legalist right he he
[1:24:49] he just does everything wrong when when
[1:24:51] the Jesus said one of you will betray me
[1:24:53] everybody looked at Peter
[1:24:56] and Peter even said Lord is it
[1:25:02] me what a
[1:25:05] witness he ran home like a
[1:25:08] coward when Jesus was Tried by the S
[1:25:10] hadri and Peter followed for a little
[1:25:11] while but when he got there he denied
[1:25:13] him three
[1:25:14] times
[1:25:16] cursed tried to prove he wasn't a
[1:25:20] Believer ran home like a coward didn't
[1:25:22] even attend the crucifixion
[1:25:25] or the
[1:25:26] burial John not only outran him to the
[1:25:29] tomb but then he describes every detail
[1:25:32] of his
[1:25:34] betrayal now you tell me if you think
[1:25:36] this a credible witness or not John
[1:25:39] 21:3 look he wasn't very credible he
[1:25:42] gets back after they've seen him and
[1:25:47] backslides he said what do you mean by
[1:25:49] that well he went fishing you remember
[1:25:50] where he come from they didn't go
[1:25:52] fishing for fun they went fishing for
[1:25:55] money and so what they did is that when
[1:25:57] they followed Jesus they left their
[1:25:59] Nets and so Peter for the first time
[1:26:01] since Jesus has been on the earth now
[1:26:04] Peter is now going to go back to his
[1:26:06] Nets after he seen him right but he just
[1:26:10] didn't have the
[1:26:14] confidence Oh
[1:26:15] my he just couldn't he just couldn't
[1:26:18] wrap his mind around the fact God wanted
[1:26:20] to use him he knew Jesus was dead but he
[1:26:23] didn't know that he he could be
[1:26:25] used oh my and Simon Peter says I go a
[1:26:29] fishing and I want you to know tonight
[1:26:31] this or this morning this verse proves
[1:26:34] gifts and callings are without
[1:26:36] repentance because when Peter said I go
[1:26:38] a fishing they say to him we also go
[1:26:39] with
[1:26:41] thee that's why a person with a gift can
[1:26:45] lead people right or
[1:26:48] wrong right he they backside with him
[1:26:51] but Jesus was greater than their back
[1:26:53] sidings
[1:26:55] aren't you oh a that so wonderful this
[1:26:58] aren't you
[1:26:58] grateful look they went forth and
[1:27:00] entered into a ship immediately that
[1:27:02] night they caught nothing not only did
[1:27:04] he fail at being a a testimony to the
[1:27:07] people not only did he fail at even
[1:27:09] watching the crucifixion but he even
[1:27:11] failed at
[1:27:13] fishing he was even a bad
[1:27:17] backslider couldn't even do that
[1:27:20] right sat there miserably fishing all
[1:27:25] night long all the things he used to do
[1:27:27] to make himself happy didn't work no
[1:27:31] more all the life of a backslider is
[1:27:33] miserable it's miserable because all the
[1:27:36] things you may you think you young
[1:27:37] people you might think well I'll go out
[1:27:39] in the world and I I'll se My Wild Oats
[1:27:41] but if you've ever been in contact with
[1:27:43] Jesus none of the things that used to
[1:27:45] make you happy will ever make you happy
[1:27:50] again he's fishing miserably yes
[1:27:55] in John 21:4 when the morning was now
[1:27:58] come Jesus stood on the
[1:28:00] shore but the disciples knew not that it
[1:28:03] was Jesus they never knew till he said
[1:28:06] who he
[1:28:06] was and Jesus said unto them children
[1:28:10] have you any
[1:28:11] meat they answered him no he said unto
[1:28:15] them cast a net on the right side of the
[1:28:16] ship and you'll find they cast therefore
[1:28:20] and now because they were in the habit
[1:28:22] of doing what Jesus said even though
[1:28:24] they didn't know it was him I love that
[1:28:27] take your kids to
[1:28:29] church cuz they just might listen to The
[1:28:31] Voice one day and cast their net on the
[1:28:34] right side of the ship because that's
[1:28:36] their habit of
[1:28:38] listening right sir and Peter as soon as
[1:28:42] oh my soon as them fish started to
[1:28:45] tug Peter ah I've been here before
[1:28:49] there's only one man that can turn my
[1:28:52] sorrow into Joy yeah only one man that
[1:28:55] can turn my mour into dancing only one
[1:28:58] man that can that can give me what I
[1:29:00] have need of right amen he recognized it
[1:29:03] was him and he put his coat on him and
[1:29:04] jumped off in the lake swam to the shore
[1:29:08] and Jesus got food fixed for him F he he
[1:29:12] made himself a Meal made him a meal and
[1:29:15] and the disciples sat there and ate with
[1:29:17] him and Jesus pulled Peter aside and he
[1:29:20] said Peter do you love me more than
[1:29:22] these you love me more than than these
[1:29:24] others Peter you better you know I'm
[1:29:27] here right you just went through a whole
[1:29:30] weekend where you did nothing
[1:29:33] right you don't seem to be a very
[1:29:35] credible witness but Peter if you love
[1:29:38] me feed my
[1:29:42] sheep to God I feel this morning most
[1:29:46] identified with Peter because I know
[1:29:49] what I've done I know that I'm not at
[1:29:51] times I I haven't been as a young person
[1:29:53] you said brother B you never went out in
[1:29:54] the world but I I had a religious spirit
[1:29:57] on me I had a worse demon than all seven
[1:29:59] of Mary magdalene's demons put together
[1:30:01] and that was a religious spirit and I
[1:30:04] know what it's like I know what it's
[1:30:07] like to be away from his presence but I
[1:30:09] know what it's like to be forgiven Peter
[1:30:11] knew what it was like to fail but he
[1:30:12] knew what it was like to be
[1:30:15] forgiven Hallelujah Jesus said feed my
[1:30:18] sheep and so he went there in Acts 1
[1:30:20] and8 and he told his disciples in his
[1:30:22] Ascension he said but you shall receive
[1:30:23] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[1:30:25] upon you you should be Witnesses unto me
[1:30:27] both in Jerusalem in all Judea and
[1:30:29] Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of
[1:30:31] the earth and we find Peter the same guy
[1:30:35] who who did everything wrong on Easter
[1:30:37] did everything right at
[1:30:39] Pentecost glory to God what was it it
[1:30:42] was the Holy Ghost that made the
[1:30:44] difference Peter stood up with the 11
[1:30:46] lifted up his voice and said unto him ye
[1:30:48] men of Judea and all ye that dwell in
[1:30:50] Jerusalem be this known unto you and
[1:30:52] hearken to my words he said I'm I'm a
[1:30:54] witness not only of the death Peril and
[1:30:57] Resurrection but of his return and the
[1:30:59] power of the Holy
[1:31:00] Ghost he said in the same
[1:31:03] place look I I just imagine I don't know
[1:31:05] if this is true but I imagine that Peter
[1:31:08] could see the
[1:31:10] spot where he
[1:31:12] betrayed
[1:31:15] Jesus you can see where the fire
[1:31:17] was he warmed his hands when he cursed
[1:31:21] and said I'm not one of his oh my but he
[1:31:24] got so filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:31:26] it didn't even cross his mind the irony
[1:31:28] of it that a man who 50 days before was
[1:31:32] a betrayer of Christ could stand and say
[1:31:34] this is
[1:31:35] that didn't care what they said about
[1:31:38] him didn't care whether they killed him
[1:31:40] or not he become a
[1:31:42] witness and I want to present to you
[1:31:44] today as we presented three resurrect or
[1:31:45] three Witnesses of his resurrection I
[1:31:48] want to present to you today that we
[1:31:50] have witnesses of his resurrection
[1:31:52] today in John 14: 19 the Bible says yet
[1:31:56] a little while in the world seeth me no
[1:31:58] more but you see me because I live ye
[1:32:02] shall live
[1:32:03] also and brother brandom tells us in in
[1:32:06] 1965 and it is the rising of the sun he
[1:32:08] said because I live you live also
[1:32:11] speaking to his wife because I live you
[1:32:13] live also what a resurrection that that
[1:32:17] was and what a
[1:32:20] resurrection this is to be quickened
[1:32:24] from the dead to be made alive in Christ
[1:32:27] Jesus by God's quickening power now I
[1:32:29] want to very quickly I know you say
[1:32:31] brother Ben we're going to end early
[1:32:32] today brother BS got through all three
[1:32:34] well I didn't say there was not two sets
[1:32:36] of
[1:32:39] three we won't take as long on the
[1:32:41] second
[1:32:42] set now watch brother BR said they seen
[1:32:46] his
[1:32:47] resurrection and today we are seeing his
[1:32:51] resurrection the sign of his
[1:32:53] resurrection ction Jonah three days and
[1:32:55] nights was in the belly of the well on
[1:32:57] the third day he arose from the well
[1:32:59] Jesus raised from the dead after being
[1:33:01] three days in his belly 2,000 years he's
[1:33:04] been absent from the church but he
[1:33:06] promised through Joel what the Palmer
[1:33:08] worm left the caterpillar eaten but I
[1:33:10] will restore sayith the Lord all that
[1:33:13] the Palmer worm and the caterpillar and
[1:33:15] the Locust and so forth eat up I will
[1:33:17] restore it in the last days what is it
[1:33:19] it's another
[1:33:21] Resurrection are you with me so far
[1:33:25] now look at these Witnesses of his
[1:33:27] resurrection Jesus lived in our day and
[1:33:30] he lives
[1:33:32] today but Jesus proved himself to be
[1:33:35] alive after 2,000
[1:33:38] years now he began doing that through
[1:33:40] the ministry of a prophet named William
[1:33:41] brandham now watch watch what happened
[1:33:45] it wasn't brother brandham it was Christ
[1:33:47] proving himself
[1:33:49] alive I want to call my first witness
[1:33:51] the blind girl in Jonesboro
[1:33:55] because there's a special connection
[1:33:56] between her and our first Witnesses
[1:33:59] witness Simon the
[1:34:02] sirene look brother brandom tells us
[1:34:05] about that blind girl he said she was
[1:34:08] wandering through the crowd and brother
[1:34:10] brandom was actually outside of where
[1:34:11] the meeting was right here in Jonesboro
[1:34:13] just a few miles away and brother
[1:34:16] brandom is want the the little girl is
[1:34:17] wandering around and he sees her and
[1:34:20] she's crying out for her father and
[1:34:23] she's lost her father father and so the
[1:34:24] little girl is wandering through there
[1:34:26] and she's completely blind brother
[1:34:28] Brenham has compassion on her and he
[1:34:29] said he stood where she would bump into
[1:34:31] him and she ran into him and she said
[1:34:34] sir can you help me find my father all
[1:34:37] right she said I need to get to the
[1:34:41] Healer and she said actually I love her
[1:34:44] I love her faith she said actually if
[1:34:46] you can get me to the Healer I'll find
[1:34:49] my father
[1:34:50] myself come on Hallelujah
[1:34:54] and so brother BR standing there and
[1:34:55] having compassion on her he begins to
[1:34:57] talk to her and finally explains who he
[1:34:59] was said I'm not a Healer but I'm
[1:35:01] someone I'm brother brandom I'm the one
[1:35:03] that can lay hands on you and and she
[1:35:05] said she believed and brother Brandon
[1:35:07] began to pray for her and when he begin
[1:35:09] to pray for her he said I just took her
[1:35:12] by the hand and I said Heavenly Father
[1:35:15] years
[1:35:16] ago I want to tell you something today
[1:35:19] everything you're doing now will matter
[1:35:21] if there is a future right right you
[1:35:24] think it doesn't matter but it does
[1:35:27] matter right the the the times the way
[1:35:30] we live our lives good and bad matters
[1:35:32] to our
[1:35:33] children it matters to our grandchildren
[1:35:36] right and I'm so thankful for grace for
[1:35:39] the
[1:35:39] bad but I want the good to have be
[1:35:44] effective right and by Simon picking up
[1:35:47] his cross that had a special impact on
[1:35:51] brother Brandon that story me something
[1:35:54] to a prophet now Simon was a black man
[1:35:57] come out of sirene he come out of Africa
[1:35:59] Northern Africa he was a black man and
[1:36:02] and Simon being a black man brother
[1:36:04] brandom saw a black girl and he looks at
[1:36:06] her and he says this is one of Simon's
[1:36:09] children you think it don't make a
[1:36:12] difference what you do look after 2,000
[1:36:14] years a prophet's heart is moved sir by
[1:36:18] what Simon
[1:36:20] did Hallelujah and it begins to remind
[1:36:23] God of it Heavenly Father years ago
[1:36:25] there was an Old Rugged Cross dragging
[1:36:27] down through Jerusalem the streets
[1:36:28] dragging out the bloody Footprints of
[1:36:30] the bear on his Road up the hill his
[1:36:32] little weak frail body fell under the
[1:36:34] load there was Simon the sirene came and
[1:36:36] picked up the cross and helped him to
[1:36:38] Bear it on I said here is one of his
[1:36:40] children
[1:36:41] tonight staggering in darkness Lord he
[1:36:44] said I'm sure you
[1:36:50] understand the Harvey won't be in vain
[1:36:52] he'll repay every every
[1:36:55] bit sir every bit of
[1:36:58] work every time you went to church you
[1:37:01] didn't feel like it every time you every
[1:37:02] time you shook somebody's hand and
[1:37:05] greeted them with a smile even though
[1:37:07] you felt like hitting them in the
[1:37:09] face I'm not saying brother Harve you
[1:37:11] ever did that but we all have at some
[1:37:13] point every time you forgave every time
[1:37:15] you love every time you picked up your
[1:37:17] cross every time you did the hard things
[1:37:20] and you committed yourself to working
[1:37:22] and doing all you could for Christ and
[1:37:24] to carrying the cross for the body when
[1:37:26] it was
[1:37:27] weak there's a repayment for that it'll
[1:37:30] show up in your kids it'll show up in
[1:37:32] your grandkids it'll show up in your
[1:37:34] great grandkids if he
[1:37:36] carries will and it showed up 2,000
[1:37:40] years after Simon carried his cross he
[1:37:43] said there here is one of his children
[1:37:46] tonight Lord I'm sure you understand she
[1:37:49] be to praise God she could see that was
[1:37:53] all there was to it she had her sight
[1:37:56] what was she a witness of a resurrected
[1:37:58] Jesus Christ here on the
[1:38:00] earth amen right Hatty Wright was a
[1:38:04] witness I know we talk about Hatty
[1:38:06] Wright hady Wright moer a lot but she
[1:38:09] was a witness and and she's remarkable
[1:38:12] because of how unremarkable she
[1:38:14] is that's what makes her remarkable to
[1:38:17] us but she was a helper to the gospel
[1:38:19] you say the little things don't matter
[1:38:20] they do matter hady rright was a help
[1:38:23] help her and what she did you know she
[1:38:26] could have sit there so well I don't
[1:38:27] have no money the church ought to be
[1:38:28] giving me
[1:38:29] money but she didn't do that and I think
[1:38:32] we ought to help all uh the widows and
[1:38:34] the and the poor people all that we can
[1:38:36] help but that wasn't her attitude that's
[1:38:38] right she sat there with the right
[1:38:39] attitude and she'd given she tried to
[1:38:42] give $200 I think it was to the fund the
[1:38:45] building fund for the Tabernacle and uh
[1:38:47] the trustees wouldn't take it so she
[1:38:49] gave
[1:38:50] $20 and it was all the money maybe that
[1:38:53] she made in a month and $200 all the
[1:38:55] money she made maybe in a year and
[1:38:57] trying to scratch out a living on a on a
[1:38:59] dirt farm and and so she she had given
[1:39:02] that $20 now brother Brown begins to
[1:39:04] think about that $20 because they told
[1:39:05] her what had happened he said I'm going
[1:39:07] to get that back to her and the Lord
[1:39:08] actually rebuked him for that and said
[1:39:11] don't give it back to her right he said
[1:39:14] because because he said it was just like
[1:39:16] the woman that gave her two pence Jesus
[1:39:19] never rebuked her never stopped her
[1:39:21] right she gave of her all and so brother
[1:39:24] brand said I kept the $20 in my
[1:39:27] pocket oh my and he said a little old
[1:39:29] quiet sister Haddie now brother brandom
[1:39:32] begins to tell the stories of the of the
[1:39:35] uh of the squirrels who were spoken into
[1:39:37] existence now that seems like an
[1:39:38] incredible thing and I know sometimes we
[1:39:41] we we almost feel embarrassed we say
[1:39:43] well why why do we have to tell these
[1:39:44] stories why do we have to talk about
[1:39:46] these things that that happened during a
[1:39:47] prophet's Ministry well the we saw God
[1:39:50] in a mighty way yeah but I believe
[1:39:53] there's more stories today I believe you
[1:39:54] have a story I have a story of things
[1:39:57] God's done for us but these were stories
[1:40:00] that were real why we believe the
[1:40:03] witnesses right and so here was a little
[1:40:07] old woman and and brother tells a story
[1:40:09] about the the squirrels spoken into
[1:40:12] existence and this new ministry and
[1:40:14] things like that and as he's telling it
[1:40:15] he said little old sister hadie sitting
[1:40:17] back there a little dust B and on like
[1:40:18] the country women wear there she'd put
[1:40:20] on a little clean dress to come over to
[1:40:22] help her mother cook me dinner and she
[1:40:24] was sitting with her hand like this all
[1:40:26] you mothers you think it'll it'll never
[1:40:28] it'll never you'll never be repayed you
[1:40:30] just watch and see what God does she was
[1:40:33] sitting there with her hand like this
[1:40:34] she said that's nothing but the truth
[1:40:36] she said the right thing just as she
[1:40:39] said that she said the right thing the
[1:40:41] spirit of the Lord said to me tell her
[1:40:43] to ask what she will and you give it to
[1:40:45] her I couldn't speak that room everybody
[1:40:47] felt strange I said sister Haddie she
[1:40:49] said yes brother brandom I said ask
[1:40:51] anything that's in your heart anything
[1:40:52] you want to you ask thus said the Lord
[1:40:54] I'll speak it behind you you'll have it
[1:40:56] she said the salvation of my two boys I
[1:40:59] said you have it in the name of the Lord
[1:41:02] and those two little modern teenage SLE
[1:41:04] Fritz boys that had hated the very cause
[1:41:07] of Christ grabbed one another and begin
[1:41:09] to scream the blessings of God he said
[1:41:12] the power of God struck that place Banks
[1:41:14] fell into his plate he said I don't know
[1:41:15] what happened for about 10 minutes
[1:41:17] friend do you realize what that was he
[1:41:19] said I've never in all my life felt such
[1:41:21] anointing the first time it was ever
[1:41:22] performed on a human being it bypassed
[1:41:25] Aristocrats it bypassed everything else
[1:41:27] went to a poor little old widow woman
[1:41:28] living up on the hill there and God knew
[1:41:30] what she would ask her two boys oh help
[1:41:33] me preach this morning I I don't ask you
[1:41:35] very much but but but I want to get to
[1:41:37] this last Point help me preach this
[1:41:39] morning she they were gloriously saved
[1:41:41] the very minute it was
[1:41:44] spoken
[1:41:46] hallelujah what was it listen to me now
[1:41:50] she acknowledged the accuracy of
[1:41:53] prophet's
[1:41:54] words she said he was right she said Oh
[1:41:58] Glory to God it was nothing but the
[1:42:00] truth and when she did her family was
[1:42:02] saved listen to me you need to come to
[1:42:05] terms with the fact this message is
[1:42:07] right you need to get to where you
[1:42:09] believe it if you ever can get to where
[1:42:12] you say I may not be what I should be
[1:42:14] but I know that message is right I may
[1:42:17] not be able to do all I I need to be do
[1:42:19] but I know that the message right you
[1:42:21] said that don't matter to say it does
[1:42:22] matter
[1:42:23] because when she come to terms and say
[1:42:25] there's nothing but the truth and she
[1:42:27] believed it in her heart when that
[1:42:29] happened it changed her family
[1:42:31] trajectory just like it did Simon you
[1:42:34] want to make a difference in your family
[1:42:35] pick up your cross and acknowledge that
[1:42:38] this message is
[1:42:41] true if you're struggling with that in
[1:42:43] your mind for your kids's sake you need
[1:42:44] to settle
[1:42:52] that
[1:42:54] finally down to our last
[1:42:56] witness you're going to call Brother the
[1:42:57] B they already put it up I'm a
[1:43:01] witness and I want us each one to take
[1:43:03] it
[1:43:05] personally I'm a
[1:43:08] witness you you boys sitting here on the
[1:43:10] front row you're a witness man you're a
[1:43:13] witness of the resurrection of Christ
[1:43:15] you well I never saw him I never walked
[1:43:17] with him neither did
[1:43:20] Paul but he was a witness of the power
[1:43:22] of his resurrection
[1:43:24] like Simon I know his power breaks
[1:43:28] family
[1:43:30] curses all right we ought to just stop
[1:43:32] there and Shout for a
[1:43:35] while I know where some of you come from

[1:43:45] what's back there but I also know that
[1:43:47] his that his power breaks family
[1:43:50] curses sir Hallelujah and oh when he
[1:43:54] called me when I was compelled by
[1:43:55] election to pick up the cross he met me

[1:44:26] lust can be broken a curse of n false
[1:44:30] Doctrine can be broken a curse of all
[1:44:32] kinds of nonsense can be broken off of a
