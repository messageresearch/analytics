[44:27] that Lord I Want More believe he he has
[44:29] more for you Amen brother Brandon said
[44:31] that's that's just proof that he's got
[44:33] more if you want more and so I I believe
[44:35] that the preaching of the word of God
[44:37] can change lives you know just at the
[44:40] preaching of the word of God God is the
[44:43] Bible calls it the foolishness of
[44:44] preaching I've often thought it's
[44:46] because I'm a I'm just an imperfect
[44:49] person just like you are but somehow if
[44:51] I can get myself out of the way then God
[44:54] can edify Somebody by that imperfect
[44:57] clay amen and it's fullish sounding but
[44:59] it's the way that God ordained amen he
[45:02] ordained men to be vessels Amen brother
[45:04] B brother bandam even said that the
[45:06] voice of man would be the transmitter
[45:09] for the voice of
[45:10] God and so you can you can hear the
[45:13] voice of a man but I want to hear the
[45:15] voice of my father amen I just want to
[45:18] hear his voice amen before we read maybe
[45:21] we'll just bow our heads together maybe
[45:23] if you just have a need you just want to
[45:24] uplift a hand raise a hand and say Lord
[45:26] I'm going to represent my need here
[45:28] tonight I just wonder if at this moment
[45:30] we could just bind our faith together
[45:33] Lord Jesus I raise my hand up God with
[45:36] all of these hands Lord that are raised
[45:38] you see the need represented here
[45:40] tonight some Lord Jesus even hear sicken
[45:43] body Lord but yet they're here at their
[45:45] post of Duty we ask God that you'd give
[45:48] them a Special Touch tonight Lord God
[45:50] May healing from Jehovah come and
[45:53] Quicken their body even their mortal
[45:54] body Lord Jesus healing is the
[45:57] children's bread Lord and that means
[45:59] it's our inheritance God I pray Lord for

[46:52] don't have a 45 minute timer brother
[46:54] Joel I'm sorry but I do have a 1 hour
[46:57] timer and so um we'll try to they said I
[47:00] cut into my my 1 hour for tonight so I
[47:03] only got 45 minutes
[47:06] so man y'all are worse than my people
[47:09] back home I'm just
[47:12] kidding I'm just kidding well the pastor
[47:15] told me to take my Liberty tonight amen
[47:18] he didn't say it like brother Frasier
[47:19] who would say brother you take your
[47:21] Liberty for about 60 minutes
[47:27] so he just told me to have my Liberty
[47:29] and so I want the Lord to have his
[47:30] Liberty amen I know that you uh I know
[47:34] that you feel the same way that I do
[47:36] amen let's just pick this up here again
[47:39] in verse one of Ruth chapter 1 now it
[47:42] came to pass in the days when the judges
[47:45] ruled that there was a famine in the
[47:47] land and a certain man of Bethlehem
[47:50] Judea went to sojourn in the country of
[47:53] Moab he and his wife and his two sons
[47:57] the name of the man was IMC and his and
[47:59] the name of his wife Naomi and the two
[48:03] of his sons Mayon and chilion now notice
[48:06] how we know the story and I don't won't
[48:08] read the entire chapter but we know that
[48:10] these two men died and the Bible says in
[48:14] verse six then she arose with her
[48:17] daughters-in-law that she might return
[48:19] from the country of Moab for she had
[48:21] heard in the country of Moab how that
[48:23] the Lord had visited his people and
[48:25] giving them bread
[48:27] wherefore she went forth out of the
[48:29] place where she was notice she had to
[48:31] leave where she was right and her two
[48:35] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[48:38] on the way to return into the land of
[48:40] Judah and Naomi said unto her two
[48:42] granddaughters in-law go return each to
[48:45] her mother's house the Lord de deal
[48:48] kindly with you as you have dealt with
[48:50] the dead and with me the Lord grant you
[48:54] that you may find rest each of view in
[48:57] the house of her husband then she kissed
[48:59] them and lifted up their voice and wept
[49:03] and they said unto her surely we will
[49:05] return with thee unto thy people and
[49:08] Naomi said turn again my daughters why
[49:10] will you go with me are there yet any
[49:12] more sons in my womb that they may be
[49:16] your husbands turn again my daughters go
[49:18] your way for I'm too old to have a
[49:20] husband if I should say I have hope if I
[49:23] should have a husband also tonight and
[49:25] should also bear Sons would you T for
[49:28] them would you would you T for them till
[49:30] they were
[49:31] grown the Bible says in verse 14 they
[49:33] lift up their voice and wept and orpa
[49:36] kissed her mother-in-law I love this but
[49:39] Ruth clave unto her and she said behold
[49:44] thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her
[49:46] people and into her Gods return after
[49:50] thy sister-in-law and Ruth said entreat
[49:53] me not to leave thee or to return from
[49:56] following after thee for whether thou
[50:00] goest I will go and whether thou lodgest
[50:04] I will Lodge thy people shall be my
[50:07] people and thy God my god notice and I
[50:13] just want to pick up one more thing
[50:14] before you're seated and he says in
[50:17] verse 20 and she said unto them call me
[50:21] not Naomi call me Mara for the almighty
[50:24] hath dealt very bitterly with me
[50:27] I went out full and the Lord hath
[50:29] brought me home again now remember who
[50:31] the prophet tells us Naomi represents
[50:34] the Orthodox Jewish church right and so
[50:39] the prophet shows us that this is Naomi
[50:41] representing the Jewish church and Ruth
[50:44] representing the Gentile
[50:46] bride right and notice he says here you
[50:49] shall not call me for I went out full
[50:52] and the Lord ha brought me home again
[50:54] empty why then call you call me Naomi
[50:57] seeing that the Lord has testified again
[50:59] me against me and the almighty hath
[51:02] Afflicted me so Naomi returned and Ruth
[51:05] the moabitas her daughter-in-law with
[51:07] her which returned out of the country of
[51:10] Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the
[51:14] beginning of barley Harvest Lord we just
[51:17] ask you to bless your word one more time
[51:19] father may God you have your way in all
[51:22] things we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[51:24] amen you can be seated
[51:29] notice the scripture here is that Bible
[51:32] says that
[51:33] they returned at Barley Harvest brother
[51:37] bham says so many things that you could
[51:39] look at and and we don't have time to
[51:41] teach on the entire story but if you
[51:44] just look at the story it's a story with
[51:47] so many types and lessons between Naomi
[51:50] and Ruth it's a book about a woman who
[51:53] gleaned and truly there's so much that
[51:56] you could lean out of this one little
[51:57] book that's right and so what you've
[52:00] Minister when we see this story and we
[52:02] preached on it today on the the the uh
[52:05] called out of judges and into Ruth and
[52:08] showed that how that these two books of
[52:11] judges and Ruth were actually originally
[52:13] bound together they were one book and
[52:16] you picked that up when you read the
[52:17] first verse and it says in the time of
[52:19] the judges and so you know that just as
[52:22] in the Book of Judges the people had
[52:24] gotten away from the law of Moses
[52:27] and judges and R that that you found
[52:29] there we read that today in Leviticus
[52:31] and now there becomes a cycle a constant
[52:34] Circle that just repeats over and over
[52:37] and the pattern of Judges is much like
[52:39] that roundabout you know the roundabout
[52:42] and I don't know if you have those here
[52:43] do you'all have roundabouts and traffic
[52:45] circles we got a lot of them back home
[52:47] you know the purpose of the roundabout
[52:49] brother Joel is to get off of the
[52:52] roundabout unless you're not from there
[52:55] and and and and you just go around and
[52:56] around and wondering what you do but you
[52:59] know it's funny but really that's how a
[53:00] lot of people live their life that they
[53:03] go around and around and around and
[53:05] around and after a while you get dizzy
[53:06] and wonder who am I what am I where am I
[53:09] going what's happening in my life but
[53:11] the message of Ruth is to get off of
[53:14] that roundabout and get onto the path of
[53:18] redemption you see in contrast to a
[53:21] cycle Ruth Story is all about a purpose
[53:25] if you could just turn me up here only
[53:27] on the left side is fine it's a life
[53:30] with a purpose because it's a line in
[53:33] fact it's a royal line and it's not a
[53:35] cycle it's actually a circle it's
[53:38] actually a line it's a romance in so
[53:40] many ways and the prophet of God says
[53:42] this that the Bible is a love story
[53:44] picks this up in kinsman redeemer and he
[53:47] talks about this that how that this was
[53:49] a romance B between Christ and his bride
[53:52] and in that story of Ruth you have that
[53:55] great story of redemp Redemption it
[53:57] shows the kindness of this one man who
[53:59] we know is a type of Our Redeemer Boaz
[54:02] who would take upon himself this moabit
[54:05] woman and Ruth and all that belonged to
[54:07] her notice he didn't just take her but
[54:10] he took everything that belonged to
[54:12] her and so everything that was attached
[54:14] to her he took with him and he redeemed
[54:16] every single bit of it and so brother
[54:18] Barham would use this story of
[54:20] redemption and Ruth and he would he
[54:22] would he would use that to preach his
[54:24] message the Kinsman redeem rer took this
[54:27] out of Naomi being a type of that
[54:29] Orthodox Jewish church and Ruth being a
[54:32] type of the Gentiles and how that this
[54:34] woman Ruth should have as we said never
[54:37] been in this story uh or in even really
[54:40] in the pages of the Bible but now
[54:43] somehow we know the story of Ruth very
[54:45] well in fact it's read every year at the
[54:48] Feast of Pentecost the Jews read the
[54:50] story of Ruth because it it she took
[54:53] such an imprint in history that her name
[54:56] is forever mentioned in the story of
[54:59] redemption and the lineage of Christ
[55:02] friends just think about how much grace
[55:04] that God has given you in your life that
[55:07] you could have been here on a Sunday
[55:08] night sitting on a bar stool somewhere
[55:11] some of you could have been down at the
[55:13] Baptist Church and maybe just cut
[55:14] getting out of you know uh who knows
[55:16] where you could have been who knows
[55:17] where we all would have been but somehow
[55:20] God has called you out of the
[55:22] denominations of men and out of all
[55:24] things listen when The Voice voice of
[55:26] God cried out in this generation in
[55:29] Revelation 17:3 it was to say come out
[55:32] of
[55:33] her come out of her my people you say
[55:37] out of what out of
[55:39] everything come out of anything the
[55:41] devil's put on you it's not just a
[55:42] coming out of a denominational idea
[55:44] that's wonderful but come out of any of
[55:46] your old ideas come out of any of your
[55:49] old patterns come out of any of your old
[55:52] habits come out of any of your old sins
[55:54] out of your old thinking when when when
[55:56] real Redemption takes place friends it's
[55:58] a brand new
[55:59] day it's a brand new life it's a brand
[56:02] new chance it's a it's a brand new story
[56:05] and God saying I don't want you to carry
[56:07] anything over from judges it's a brand
[56:10] new
[56:11] life and so we know that she was a
[56:14] stranger so much of this was how that
[56:17] Ruth the moabit was a stranger from the
[56:19] promises of God but somehow in her life
[56:22] God comes down and decides to rewrite
[56:24] her entire history and she finds herself
[56:27] with Naomi married to her son and then
[56:30] we know the story how that the son dies
[56:32] and and and then you see death and it's
[56:35] even a type you say brother Matt what is
[56:37] that the prophet tells us it's a type of
[56:39] Israel because he says I I left I came
[56:41] out full but now I I left full but now
[56:44] I'm coming back empty and the prophet
[56:46] tells us that that was a type of the the
[56:48] Orthodox Jewish Church of how that Naomi
[56:51] being a type how that she left she was
[56:53] left a widow and without a husband right
[56:56] hell you say who is she widowed from
[57:00] Jehovah and and how that she has two
[57:02] sons and those two sons are going to die
[57:05] much like Israel would be split into two
[57:07] kingdoms between Jobo and rabo and and
[57:10] and it's it's a perfect type all the way
[57:12] through this the prophet of God says
[57:13] this it's a book of Prophecy it speaks
[57:16] perfectly and so it shows how that she
[57:18] would have these two sons and and how
[57:20] the kingdom would be split into two and
[57:23] and and and how that how that through
[57:25] the the two sons Judah and Benjamin and
[57:28] how that death would happen in Canaan as
[57:30] we read about this morning and it was
[57:32] all typed here in this little story of
[57:34] Ruth we find that Ruth was just a nobody
[57:37] but she finds herself gleaning in the
[57:39] right field one day she made the right
[57:41] choice you say how did she end up there
[57:43] brother Matt cuz she made a clear-cut
[57:45] decision to not leave the word and the
[57:48] prophet of God said God doesn't want
[57:49] some jellyfish spineless no backbone
[57:52] don't know where to take a stand listen
[57:54] friends this is the age that you live
[57:56] to where everybody's afraid to really
[57:58] make a stand I'm not talking about a
[58:00] political stand that's nonsense I'm not
[58:03] talking about call coming up for some
[58:05] cause to rebel against but I'm talking
[58:07] about taking a stand for
[58:09] Jesus sir and everybody in this age is
[58:12] so wishy-washy that everybody's afraid
[58:15] to make a stand or really afraid to
[58:17] offend anybody you got to be in this age
[58:19] you got to be so careful how you say
[58:21] things and careful how you present it
[58:23] you know careful you don't walk on
[58:25] anybody's toes or I watched the man I'm
[58:27] not criticizing him he was a a good old
[58:30] you know a preacher of a of a massive
[58:32] church and it was somewhere in
[58:33] California you know he's probably a good
[58:36] man but he's up there behind his pull
[58:37] pit and he's he's so careful he wants to
[58:40] give a message to the transgender
[58:42] community and he's being so careful how
[58:44] he says it and you could tell the
[58:46] pressure he's under him and he's just
[58:47] trying to word it right and not not say
[58:50] it wrong and he's got I couldn't imagine
[58:52] brother to be honest I couldn't imagine
[58:53] he got thousands of people and there's
[58:56] 10,000 people you know they're streaming
[58:58] and they're in front of his church and
[59:00] he's careful and he's watching and and I
[59:02] just thought man thank God I'm not some
[59:04] hirling who has to be careful and preach
[59:07] what I preach or say what I say but to
[59:09] not offend anybody or hurt anybody's
[59:11] feelings or listen friends let me say
[59:14] like brother Bram said I was nobody uh
[59:17] before I found God and I'm still nobody
[59:21] today but I'm in God's
[59:24] hands and so it doesn't matter you say
[59:26] brother Matt what are you interested in
[59:28] I'm interested in preaching the truth
[59:30] the whole truth and nothing but the
[59:32] truth and I just say let the chips fall
[59:34] where they may I think we got to get
[59:36] back to preaching the word of God in
[59:38] spite of what other people
[59:40] think cuz you live in a world he was so
[59:43] careful how he danced over it and said
[59:45] it and he finally you could tell he he
[59:47] finally just breaks and says I just want
[59:49] to say we love you transgender people
[59:50] man the place just goes into a a Roar
[59:53] and and and you know and just Applause
[59:56] you can feel just everybody taking a
[59:57] deep
[59:59] breath and I thought you know
[1:00:01] what can I just say
[1:00:04] something feelings are
[1:00:10] overrated can I just say that put that
[1:00:13] on a t-shirt feelings are overrated
[1:00:17] that's right people care so much about
[1:00:20] everybody hurting everybody's feelings
[1:00:22] let me just say this to you my brother
[1:00:24] my sister this Bible was never written
[1:00:26] to to to to you know to soothe your
[1:00:29] feelings oh I'm going to preach anyway I
[1:00:32] said this Bible was never meant to be
[1:00:34] acceptable by the masses it was never
[1:00:36] meant to be re you know just just to you
[1:00:39] know to patty cake with or listen this
[1:00:41] is the most controversial book that's
[1:00:44] ever been written in existence and it
[1:00:46] didn't care about your feelings my
[1:00:48] feelings the world's feelings it's it's
[1:00:50] never made or written to be popular or
[1:00:53] accepted by people and let me just go
[1:00:55] ahead and preach further we don't need
[1:00:57] to dress this message up and try to make
[1:00:59] it more palpable for our people to hear
[1:01:02] or make it more cultured or or more
[1:01:05] refined it's always come to the ignorant
[1:01:08] and the unlearned and I just say thank
[1:01:10] God that God didn't have to come to me
[1:01:12] at some kind of intellectual way but he
[1:01:15] brother Ram said he doesn't come to the
[1:01:17] mind that's the devil's Battleground but
[1:01:19] God chose the heart of a man and when
[1:01:22] the word uh reaches the heart it doesn't
[1:01:25] bring reference to your life brother it
[1:01:27] brings transformation by the blood of
[1:01:30] Jesus and a man can walk out a sinner
[1:01:33] and walk out of that church Born Again
[1:01:35] of the spirit of God I say that's the
[1:01:38] kind of preacher that we need a a word
[1:01:41] that changes the
[1:01:45] life but you know what happens is is
[1:01:47] that we get so politically correct do
[1:01:50] you know that this is the spirit on this
[1:01:52] age that actually it would come upon
[1:01:54] this generation to where people would be
[1:01:57] so care the Bible tells you tells us
[1:01:59] this way that they would Heap unto
[1:02:01] themselves
[1:02:03] teachers having itching
[1:02:05] ears that they couldn't endure sound
[1:02:09] Doctrine it's actually a prophecy of
[1:02:12] this generation that you live in today
[1:02:14] and my brother my sister look around you
[1:02:15] it's exactly where we're at everybody's
[1:02:18] trying to make it more acceptable or
[1:02:20] more reasonable you know you got to
[1:02:21] really say it that way you really got to
[1:02:24] say everything brother bham said
[1:02:27] I mean come on brother Matt I had a
[1:02:29] brother tell me that he said really
[1:02:31] brother Matt when are we going to stop
[1:02:32] saying brother brandham said I said what
[1:02:34] do you mean when are we go come on Paul
[1:02:36] said you know what you don't one of
[1:02:37] sephus and one of Apollos are you not
[1:02:39] carnal when we going to stop quoting a
[1:02:41] prophet and I said brother you told the
[1:02:43] wrong preacher
[1:02:45] that he said do we really got to say you
[1:02:47] know brother brandham said I said all
[1:02:49] right brother let me go to the Bible you
[1:02:50] know it was funny cuz when Jesus was
[1:02:52] here Jesus would say over and over that
[1:02:54] it might be fulfilled the word spoken by
[1:02:57] Isaiah the prophet when John the Baptist
[1:03:00] came on the scene he said behold I am he
[1:03:02] of who it is spoken by the prophets one
[1:03:04] crying in the wilderness when the
[1:03:06] Apostle Paul you look at what Peter
[1:03:08] Peter quoted prophets Jesus quoted
[1:03:10] prophets John quoted prophets I think
[1:03:12] you know what I'm going to say I say if
[1:03:14] they could quote a prophet I should be
[1:03:16] able to identify myself with the
[1:03:20] [Applause]
[1:03:21] prophet and you say brother Matt what
[1:03:24] what are you trying to say today I'm
[1:03:25] trying to say that it's not the time to
[1:03:27] be wishy-washy with the rest of the
[1:03:29] world and wishy-washy it's time to make
[1:03:32] a clearcut decision and say I'll not
[1:03:35] leave you I'll stay right here beside
[1:03:39] you because it would be this age that
[1:03:42] would be the age of
[1:03:46] selflove you know Jesus prophesied that
[1:03:49] and said that men would be lovers of
[1:03:52] their own self that's right I guess we
[1:03:56] all get in the mirror and go boy look at
[1:03:59] me I just no I that's not what it is you
[1:04:02] say brother Matt what does it mean to be
[1:04:04] a lover of your own self when you take
[1:04:05] your
[1:04:07] thought and exalted above the knowledge
[1:04:10] of the
[1:04:11] word that's right and people don't sit
[1:04:14] there in the mirror and look at at least
[1:04:15] I hope they don't look at themselves and
[1:04:17] think of how good they look but it's an
[1:04:20] exaltation of men's Minds in fact it
[1:04:23] would be in this age that don't you
[1:04:25] realize my brother brother my sister it
[1:04:26] is the world that you live in not your
[1:04:28] CH not listen it's the world that your
[1:04:30] children are growing up in right now is
[1:04:33] the Advent of technology and it's on an
[1:04:35] ever increasing Pace like never before
[1:04:38] it doesn't take things to come to full
[1:04:41] maturity as many years as it used to
[1:04:45] right now it happens overnight it took
[1:04:48] years for the smartphone 20 some odd
[1:04:50] years to be where it's at today but look
[1:04:52] at what's happening now with artificial
[1:04:53] intelligence overnight now they have
[1:04:56] videos that aren't real people that
[1:04:58] aren't real nothing's real it's all just
[1:05:00] generated artificial
[1:05:03] intelligence say well where where where
[1:05:05] you going with that I'm going to tell
[1:05:06] you the prophet of God told us in
[1:05:08] countdown that everything that man
[1:05:09] achieves by education it's only a type
[1:05:12] of what God's doing in the Unseen World
[1:05:15] spiritually go come on somebody that's
[1:05:17] what the prophet taught us that it was
[1:05:19] under the it was that that Discovery you
[1:05:21] know it must have been a powerful thing
[1:05:23] when they discovered the will you know I
[1:05:25] don't think it's that powerful of a
[1:05:28] discovery but I guarantee you you ride
[1:05:30] you walk around and walk from one side
[1:05:32] when they discovered the wheel buddy I
[1:05:34] guarantee it was a Revival cuz now they
[1:05:36] didn't have to walk everywhere they
[1:05:37] could ride on the
[1:05:39] wheel and brother bham said notice when
[1:05:42] they discovered the automobile engine
[1:05:44] and he said what was it it was a type of
[1:05:46] what God was doing in the natural it was
[1:05:48] only showing you what was taking place
[1:05:50] in the spiritual and about the time they
[1:05:52] were discovering the automobile engine
[1:05:55] Luther was preaching a message of the
[1:05:57] just shall live by
[1:05:59] faith and you know that you know brother
[1:06:01] Ram said beyond that you know you go
[1:06:03] from the you go from the the horse and
[1:06:05] buggy I'm sorry and then the automobile
[1:06:07] under Wesley sanctification message and
[1:06:09] then the prophet said but science didn't
[1:06:11] stop there why cuz God wasn't going to
[1:06:14] stop there either and brother bam says
[1:06:17] and about the time that they were
[1:06:19] learning the right Brothers in North
[1:06:20] Carolina were getting off of the ground
[1:06:23] he said there was a little group in isua
[1:06:25] Street in California and he said about
[1:06:27] that time they were getting off of the
[1:06:30] ground and what was it they were not
[1:06:32] Earthbound creatures anymore but they
[1:06:35] were getting up into the Heavenly
[1:06:37] atmosphere looking at Earth from a whole
[1:06:40] different
[1:06:41] view sir that's the thing that's so
[1:06:43] awesome about that airplane man you get
[1:06:45] up there and the world looks like a
[1:06:46] completely different
[1:06:49] place I didn't know that was there I
[1:06:51] didn't know that was there I didn't know
[1:06:52] how close that was together but you get
[1:06:54] up in a higher elevated View and what
[1:06:55] was that isua street Pentecost the
[1:06:58] prophet of God said it was the
[1:06:59] restoration of gifts it was a work of
[1:07:01] that wheat that wheat plant that that
[1:07:04] that was in restoration it wasn't true
[1:07:06] Pentecost but brother vam said it was a
[1:07:08] furthering of that work of restoration
[1:07:10] but I'm going to tell you what man
[1:07:12] didn't stop there because God wasn't
[1:07:14] going to stop there and the prophet of
[1:07:16] God said but God has not called you to
[1:07:18] be just in an automobile he hasn't
[1:07:20] called you just to be in a jet aircraft
[1:07:22] he said but this is the age of the as
[1:07:26] asut and he said now we we went beyond
[1:07:30] the the the atmosphere we went beyond
[1:07:32] the stratosphere and now we're spiritual
[1:07:35] astronauts you know the thing I love
[1:07:36] about an astronaut is when an astronaut
[1:07:38] sits in that rocket ship he's not no
[1:07:40] longer looking around like this his eyes
[1:07:43] are looking straight
[1:07:48] up I guarantee you that man sitting on
[1:07:52] the USS space station right now he don't
[1:07:55] care what Fox News
[1:07:58] says he don't care he didn't care when
[1:08:00] they were when covid was going on he was
[1:08:02] a thousand miles away from all of that
[1:08:05] you see what happens when you disconnect
[1:08:07] from this world all of your cares get
[1:08:10] disconnected with
[1:08:11] it and you don't look at the world
[1:08:13] different you don't look at the world
[1:08:14] the same you don't look at your problems
[1:08:16] the same you don't look at your
[1:08:18] struggles the same come on somebody help
[1:08:21] me preach tonight you don't look at the
[1:08:23] you don't look at the issues that seem
[1:08:24] so ult right now when you get in that
[1:08:27] astronaut spaceship and you take off it
[1:08:29] doesn't matter what's happened yesterday
[1:08:32] it doesn't matter what's going to happen
[1:08:33] tomorrow or in the election cycle of
[1:08:36] this year I've already in my spaceship
[1:08:38] and I'm going to go beyond the Milky Way
[1:08:41] I'm going to say goodbye to this
[1:08:44] world you look at your problems totally
[1:08:48] different and so the prophet of God said
[1:08:50] what was it it was you say brother Matt
[1:08:52] did we stop there well no actually we
[1:08:54] didn't stop there
[1:08:56] either because now you look at the age
[1:08:58] where you're in now it's not even just
[1:09:00] the age of the astronaut but now it's
[1:09:02] the age of
[1:09:05] intelligence brother shared this with me
[1:09:08] just just the other day pastor and and
[1:09:10] he sent me this a brother in his church
[1:09:12] at Senate and he said brother I put into
[1:09:15] the to the search query of this Gemini
[1:09:18] this artificial intelligence large
[1:09:19] language model and he said I just put in
[1:09:21] there give me the what was the point of
[1:09:23] brother bram's sermon Christ is the
[1:09:24] mystery of God reveal
[1:09:26] build man what it spit
[1:09:29] out was more laid out better laid out
[1:09:32] better said than any preacher probably
[1:09:33] could have ever said it showed you that
[1:09:35] it doesn't a true gift or calling of the
[1:09:37] anointing of God is not just the ability
[1:09:39] to line up this and line up
[1:09:44] that and it was so perfect it was
[1:09:46] paragraphs about man taking that 4our
[1:09:49] sermon and it put it down in such an
[1:09:51] order couldn't have you say brother Matt
[1:09:53] what do you believe well I'm just going
[1:09:54] to tell you what brother bham said in
[1:09:56] Christ is revealed in his own word
[1:09:58] brother bham says then it started right
[1:09:59] back coming back to the church the
[1:10:01] church come from the feet coming up now
[1:10:04] it's the head the head time notice the
[1:10:07] light you can't see with your hands yet
[1:10:10] it's part of the body you can't see with
[1:10:13] your ears yet it can hear you can't see
[1:10:16] with the nose yet it smells you can't
[1:10:19] see with the lips though it speaks that
[1:10:22] was the Pentecostal age but now now come
[1:10:26] on it's the eye
[1:10:29] time the seeing Time come on come on
[1:10:33] what was that c and age it was a prophet
[1:10:35] with prophetic Vision let me tell you
[1:10:37] something friends you'd be lost without
[1:10:39] a prophet's Vision I would be too I said
[1:10:43] you would be lost without a prophetic
[1:10:45] Insight even brother Brandon that was
[1:10:47] that Prophet was typed as a Watchman on
[1:10:49] the wall and that Watchman on the wall
[1:10:52] listen friends that watchman's job you
[1:10:54] know what he stood there the wall his
[1:10:56] job wasn't to wait for the enemy to be
[1:10:58] right at the castle wall and go hey guys
[1:11:00] we got to get ready they're putting
[1:11:02] ladders up here that wasn't a true
[1:11:05] Watchman but a true watchman's gift was
[1:11:08] that he had the prophetic insight to see
[1:11:11] the enemy coming from a long ways away
[1:11:16] and then he any old dummy could sit up
[1:11:18] on the wall and tell you the problem
[1:11:20] when it's at your doorstep but it takes
[1:11:22] a prophet to look at not the fruit but
[1:11:25] the
[1:11:29] seed you see anybody could take an apple
[1:11:31] and an orange and tell you it's an apple
[1:11:32] and an orange but let me give you the
[1:11:34] seeds and then you identify what it is
[1:11:37] and I'm so thankful that God sent a
[1:11:39] prophet with prophetic Insight you say
[1:11:41] why would brother Baron preach against I
[1:11:42] Love Lucy it seems so harmless I tell
[1:11:45] you why because he wasn't preaching
[1:11:47] against the fruit you say what is the
[1:11:49] fruit I tell you the fruit is what
[1:11:50] Hollywood is producing today but he was
[1:11:53] identifying as a Watchman the seed and
[1:11:56] said kick that thing out of your home
[1:11:58] don't feed on it it's modern day Babylon
[1:12:01] why because the filth you see today oh
[1:12:04] my brother my sister I'm so glad that
[1:12:07] there was a prophet in this generation
[1:12:09] who identified not the seed not the
[1:12:12] fruit but the seed of the
[1:12:17] matter but brother said what was it it
[1:12:20] was prophetic eyes eyes to see that's
[1:12:23] right and he says that was the
[1:12:24] Pentecostal age but he says now there
[1:12:27] isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye
[1:12:31] yeah so beyond the prophetic Vision
[1:12:34] notice the next thing is the
[1:12:39] intelligence oh
[1:12:41] yeah which is Christ
[1:12:44] himself who controls the whole body oh
[1:12:49] yes he says see down through the age we
[1:12:51] started from the foundation the first
[1:12:54] age when the seed went into the ground
[1:12:56] the complete seed then it come through
[1:12:58] the feet Luther come back out through
[1:13:00] Wesley then into the Pentecostals or
[1:13:03] tongues in the lips now it's in the eyes
[1:13:08] prophetic of Malachi 4 and now there's
[1:13:10] nothing else left to come but for him
[1:13:16] himself glory to God and he say because
[1:13:19] the last thing that's the last thing
[1:13:21] there is the next is the
[1:13:25] intelligence brother there ain't nothing
[1:13:27] this message missed I tell you that I'll
[1:13:30] say it again there ain't nothing that
[1:13:32] this message missed you say that ain't
[1:13:34] in the message that's cuz only because
[1:13:36] you're only seeing it from an
[1:13:37] intellectual
[1:13:38] standpoint when you see through the eyes
[1:13:40] of Revelation you realize that this
[1:13:42] message didn't miss anything listen to
[1:13:44] me my brother my sister it's seen us and
[1:13:47] this generation that we're living in of
[1:13:49] modern-day men and the world that's
[1:13:51] falling apart the prophet of God says
[1:13:53] the next thing is the elligence and we
[1:13:56] have no intelligence of our
[1:14:00] own we have no sight of our own either
[1:14:03] brother inide of outside of prophetic
[1:14:05] sight we'd be blind and groping in
[1:14:07] darkness with the rest of the world how
[1:14:10] can a man foresee these things he can't
[1:14:11] do it it's God
[1:14:14] himself and he's governed the body all
[1:14:17] the way through the complete body of
[1:14:19] Christ is revealed in the form of the
[1:14:22] Bride that was taken out of his side
[1:14:25] like Adam did at the beginning yes sir
[1:14:27] yes sir and notice what brother Adam
[1:14:28] shows as I showed you in countdown it
[1:14:30] was only what man was doing in the
[1:14:33] natural God was doing in the
[1:14:35] Supernatural
[1:14:37] yesy good and do you realize my brother
[1:14:40] my sister this is where we stand today
[1:14:44] oh did you notice that even it was Ruth
[1:14:47] who came into the land the Bible says at
[1:14:50] the beginning of the barley Harvest how
[1:14:53] many has has seen that before for it's
[1:14:55] real clear right here in the message
[1:14:56] brother bham actually takes that and
[1:14:58] shows you he says I don't have time
[1:14:59] maybe someone he said there's some
[1:15:01] really says it to the effect of there's
[1:15:02] some really good nuggets in there
[1:15:04] because brother Ram knew that there was
[1:15:06] a key there that when Ruth comes at the
[1:15:09] beginning of barley Harvest because
[1:15:11] remember this is the age of where the
[1:15:14] the brother bandam said that under the
[1:15:16] blowing of that six trumpet because
[1:15:19] remember brother bandam shows us in
[1:15:21] Feast of the trumpets that what the
[1:15:24] trumpets are to Israel were the seals to
[1:15:28] the Gentiles that's right and so brother
[1:15:31] bam says that everything you say brother
[1:15:33] Matt why is the world going crazy
[1:15:36] everybody's lost their mind man doesn't
[1:15:38] as we said a man doesn't know what a man
[1:15:40] is anymore and I tell you what friends
[1:15:43] that's a sad
[1:15:44] situation you say how did that happen
[1:15:47] just happen you know just just because
[1:15:49] of the El the politicians and we need to
[1:15:51] get Trump in there that won't do a bit
[1:15:53] of good come on
[1:15:56] listen I that may you may not like that
[1:15:57] but I'm just going to go ahead and say
[1:15:58] it putting Trump in there won't do a bit
[1:16:00] of good brother baram said I'll put a
[1:16:02] George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on
[1:16:04] every corner and it wouldn't turn this
[1:16:06] thing
[1:16:08] around say are you not looking to Trump
[1:16:11] I am I'm looking to the last
[1:16:14] Trump that's the Trump I'm wanting to
[1:16:18] hear notice here he says that notice at
[1:16:21] that because the world's going crazy you
[1:16:23] say a man doesn't know what a man is it
[1:16:26] doesn't know a bathroom to use I'll tell
[1:16:28] you why cuz the prophet of God had seven
[1:16:31] visions and if you go and look at the
[1:16:33] fifth vision of of brother brandham he
[1:16:35] tells you he prophesies where trans the
[1:16:38] transgender movement was only a fruit of
[1:16:42] the seed he was identifying when he
[1:16:44] cried out against women getting out of
[1:16:46] their place and brother bam says the man
[1:16:49] now wants to wear her clothes and she
[1:16:52] wants to wear his clothes
[1:16:55] prophet of God said I seen in that fifth
[1:16:57] Vision the moral plight of all Humanity
[1:16:59] that centered mostly around women now
[1:17:02] I'm not talking about a son daughter of
[1:17:04] God born of the Holy Ghost you are the
[1:17:06] greatest crown and Jewel in the kingdom
[1:17:08] of God but brother bam says a woman out
[1:17:11] of her place is the greatest weapon in
[1:17:13] the hands of the
[1:17:15] devil and brother man says it's centered
[1:17:17] mostly around women when he gave them
[1:17:20] the right to vote they cut off their
[1:17:23] hair and the brother said to show she
[1:17:25] was outside of her headship that's what
[1:17:28] he was identifying and I Love Lucy was
[1:17:31] the man was made to look like a dummy
[1:17:33] just a baboon just an
[1:17:35] idiot and the woman was put over top of
[1:17:37] the man listen friends you might not
[1:17:39] like it but I love
[1:17:41] it I love every I this this to me is the
[1:17:44] only thing that makes sense this makes
[1:17:47] the world I tell you what the message of
[1:17:48] the hour does to me it makes the world
[1:17:51] make
[1:17:52] sense it makes my life make makes sense
[1:17:55] too that's right and he says I seen them
[1:17:59] as she got out of her place and brother
[1:18:02] Bon points to that and says it was the
[1:18:05] moral downfall of the entire world
[1:18:09] because of that woman getting out of her
[1:18:11] place and now he says now she wants to
[1:18:14] wear his clothes the pants and he wants
[1:18:17] to wear her clothes the shorts I know
[1:18:20] it's not popular to preach on shorts
[1:18:23] anymore but Jesus said oh you fools and
[1:18:25] slow of heart to
[1:18:28] believe hello you mean there are certain
[1:18:31] people who only believe some of the
[1:18:33] prophets what the prophets
[1:18:35] said I happen to be one of those who
[1:18:37] believe all that the prophets have
[1:18:41] spoken
[1:18:43] Hallelujah and brother bam says any old
[1:18:45] man that'll put on those shorts in
[1:18:47] public is nothing more than a
[1:18:50] man I would hide behind this pull
[1:18:53] pit but there's glass there and you'd
[1:18:54] see me
[1:18:57] anyway but you say brother Matt why is
[1:18:59] it important because I'm showing you
[1:19:02] that the world you live in didn't just
[1:19:04] accidentally get here it didn't just
[1:19:07] happen to be 2024 it wasn't a president
[1:19:11] or a bad president or a good
[1:19:13] president it was a
[1:19:16] prophecy on because of Vindicated
[1:19:19] Prophet stood and said I prophesy to you
[1:19:21] in the name of the Lord this world will
[1:19:24] go completely
[1:19:28] insane and they will lose their
[1:19:31] minds and they don't even realize it
[1:19:34] that the very things they are feeding on
[1:19:37] is causing them to go
[1:19:40] insane sir because a prophet prophesied
[1:19:44] and you know brother brandham links that
[1:19:46] fourth dimension Spirit to those spirits
[1:19:49] that were bound at the river Euphrates
[1:19:51] yes he and the prophet of God says
[1:19:53] notice he says under that sick seal
[1:19:57] right because remember that sick seal is
[1:19:59] the Tribulation seal right that's right
[1:20:02] and it has a perfect fulfillment in time
[1:20:04] say brother Matt are we in the
[1:20:06] tribulation no we're not how do you know
[1:20:08] cuz I'm still
[1:20:10] here yes sir and when you get a
[1:20:12] revelation you'll realize real quick we
[1:20:13] ain't in it cuz I'm still
[1:20:16] here but brother bham says in the Feast
[1:20:19] of the trumpets that when that seal was
[1:20:22] broken and he says there in Revelations
[1:20:25] 9 youve go study that in Revelations 9
[1:20:28] there was 200
[1:20:32] million imagine that that's right 200
[1:20:36] million
[1:20:37] demons standing at the river Euphrates
[1:20:40] if you ever go there into J to the land
[1:20:42] of Judea you can even look at it on a
[1:20:44] map you're going to find three rivers
[1:20:45] that came out of Eden the Nile the
[1:20:47] Euphrates and The Tigress River and if
[1:20:50] you ever ever look between the Tigers
[1:20:51] and the Euphrates that come up from the
[1:20:54] uh you know from the uh down over the
[1:20:56] Golan Heights into the land of Judea
[1:20:58] that what's on the other side of the
[1:21:01] Euphrates River naturally is
[1:21:05] Israel that's right and between those
[1:21:07] two rivers the Tigers and the Euphrates
[1:21:10] is a land called Mesopotamia where
[1:21:12] Abraham leaves and actually that's what
[1:21:14] meso means between bamia the two rivers
[1:21:17] and Abraham comes out of there's where
[1:21:19] he starts his journey right where the
[1:21:20] Jews start their Journey when he leaves
[1:21:22] her the Chans and moves into the Fertile
[1:21:25] Crescent into the land of Judea and the
[1:21:28] prophet of God said that 200 million
[1:21:30] demons were held at the river and they
[1:21:33] couldn't
[1:21:34] cross and brother bham says that those
[1:21:37] Spirits wanted to cross the river to
[1:21:41] persecute the
[1:21:43] Jews I'll tell you what Spirit those
[1:21:47] Hamas October 7th Fighters were under
[1:21:51] that's right they might not have
[1:21:53] realized it but they were under the
[1:21:54] demons at the river Euphrates that were
[1:21:57] released from
[1:21:58] that and I tell you what brother every
[1:22:00] one of these protesters and the colleges
[1:22:03] and the schools and the professors they
[1:22:05] might not realize it but they're under
[1:22:07] an anointing they're under a demonic
[1:22:11] spirit and brother bam says that they
[1:22:14] stood there on the River of Euphrates
[1:22:17] wanting to cross over they were held
[1:22:20] Revelations 9 says that they were held
[1:22:23] for a certain C hour a certain day a
[1:22:27] certain moment like Jude says they were
[1:22:30] reserved in the Blackness of Ashes until
[1:22:32] the day of
[1:22:33] judgment that's right in other words
[1:22:36] this this was not some random happening
[1:22:40] but God in history had a specific moment
[1:22:44] at a specific date at a specific hour
[1:22:48] that these 200 million
[1:22:50] Chargers demon Chargers would be
[1:22:53] released from that
[1:22:55] River and brother bham says that at the
[1:22:59] opening of that sick seal now we're not
[1:23:01] in the tribulation with the prophet of
[1:23:02] God if you follow it closely shows us
[1:23:05] that at the opening of that seal it
[1:23:07] released a
[1:23:09] pre-tribulation that's right or an
[1:23:11] amateur
[1:23:12] tribulation
[1:23:16] anointing and he says and those Spirits
[1:23:18] got on men like Hitler and Stalin and
[1:23:21] ikan and musolini come on
[1:23:25] hello they didn't even realize it
[1:23:27] brother sister do you realize Hitler
[1:23:30] didn't even realize it the people
[1:23:33] couldn't comprehend it but he leads an
[1:23:36] entire
[1:23:38] country you go back and you got
[1:23:40] artificial intelligence you can go back
[1:23:41] and hear
[1:23:42] Hitler's I'll call them sermons because
[1:23:45] that's what they
[1:23:46] were and they've now taken the voice of
[1:23:48] Adolf Hitler and they' put it in the
[1:23:51] English language but in his vocal in his
[1:23:53] tone
[1:23:55] it'll send shivers down your spine and
[1:23:58] they didn't realize it that his his
[1:24:01] words were
[1:24:02] anointing an entire
[1:24:05] country you see words have the power to
[1:24:08] become
[1:24:10] weapons right right I said words have
[1:24:14] the power to become
[1:24:17] weapons and the prophet of God says that
[1:24:19] Hitler under that pre- amateur
[1:24:21] tribulation under that amateur
[1:24:23] tribulation that God on Hitler and and
[1:24:26] melini and ikan brother bam says they
[1:24:28] were
[1:24:30] released naturally to the
[1:24:34] Jews but
[1:24:36] ecclesiastically to the
[1:24:39] church and brother Ram says released
[1:24:41] upon who the Jews and upon the bride so
[1:24:46] it would be twofold a natural releasing
[1:24:49] but also a spiritual releasing of
[1:24:52] ecclesiastical Devils you say what kind
[1:24:54] of devils cold Devils formal Devils dead
[1:24:58] Devils dead worship dead Church dead
[1:25:03] people who would try to remove the blood
[1:25:06] out of the church oh the prophet of God
[1:25:09] says when you remove the blood you're an
[1:25:11] anemic Church listen to me my brother my
[1:25:14] sister if we stop preaching the blood of
[1:25:17] Jesus our churches are just Lodges of
[1:25:20] good groups of people I say give me a
[1:25:22] blood give me the blood of the word of
[1:25:25] God an atonement that atones for my sins
[1:25:28] yes sir prophet of God said when you
[1:25:30] take the spirit of God out of Samson he
[1:25:33] was just any by any other man when you
[1:25:35] remove the spirit of God out of Israel
[1:25:38] they were like any other nation and when
[1:25:40] you take the spirit of God out of the
[1:25:42] message of the hour and you remove it
[1:25:44] from our churches the prophet said the
[1:25:46] church is nothing but the world with the
[1:25:50] name of God attached to it I say God
[1:25:53] give me the real word give me a blood
[1:25:56] give me a token God give me that literal
[1:25:59] Life of
[1:26:03] Christ wonderful yeah and the prophet of
[1:26:05] God said that notice those Spirits
[1:26:08] wanted to attack and he says but at that
[1:26:11] moment they were
[1:26:15] released you say where were they
[1:26:16] released to brother man the fourth
[1:26:20] dimension you say where is the fourth
[1:26:22] dimension brother Matt well let me me
[1:26:24] show you where the fourth dimension
[1:26:27] is cuz this is the dimension of Science
[1:26:30] and brother bam says in this room right
[1:26:32] now there's pictures and and remember
[1:26:33] this and he says there's pictures in
[1:26:35] this room can you see them can you hear
[1:26:37] them he said the voices of radio and he
[1:26:39] says but can you hear them no all you
[1:26:41] need is a transmitter and he says you
[1:26:43] put the right device down and it will
[1:26:45] only emulate or transmit what was
[1:26:48] already in the air oh my brother when
[1:26:51] you ever catch a revelation that if
[1:26:53] there's demons I've got to believe that
[1:26:55] there's also angels and ministering
[1:26:58] Spirits oh if there's a demon that can
[1:27:01] take over someone's life what about a
[1:27:03] holy ghost Hallelujah you say brother
[1:27:07] Matt where's it at it's here right now
[1:27:09] all it needs is a transmitter to say
[1:27:12] move on me oh
[1:27:14] God yes sir and brother bam says that
[1:27:18] those Spirits got on men like Stalin
[1:27:19] ikan melini Hitler and they didn't
[1:27:22] realize it they were under a six seal
[1:27:27] pre-tribulation
[1:27:31] anointing you see brother bam says that
[1:27:33] that six seal comes in threefolds it's a
[1:27:36] purging to the church the foolish virgin
[1:27:39] it's a purging to the 144,000 and it
[1:27:42] will also Purge the Earth and brother
[1:27:44] mam said it purges the fullest virgin
[1:27:46] for rejecting the
[1:27:48] message and their sin of
[1:27:51] unbelief for rejecting the message
[1:27:54] it purges the church the foolish it
[1:27:57] purges the Earth and it purges the
[1:28:00] 144,000 you say well then I guess we
[1:28:02] just missed the purging oh no brother
[1:28:04] you missed it all you see the purging
[1:28:06] that God needs to do it's not a matter
[1:28:09] of will you be purged it's a matter of
[1:28:11] when will you be purged because God
[1:28:14] released a bleach in this generation at
[1:28:17] the opening of The Seven seal it was
[1:28:19] going to purge a people of their sin of
[1:28:21] unbelief and I said God I choose to be
[1:28:24] purged now so that I don't have to be
[1:28:26] purged then Purge me oh god oh brother
[1:28:31] that's why the Holy Ghost won't let you
[1:28:33] get away with it that's why the Holy
[1:28:35] Ghost won't let you just walk the same
[1:28:37] but he'll press you he'll convict you
[1:28:40] he'll preach to you and say get up child
[1:28:43] you can't have that in your life kick
[1:28:45] that out of your
[1:28:47] home what is it it's the purging of the
[1:28:51] Holy
[1:28:52] Ghost can I say God
[1:28:54] Purge me
[1:28:58] now the prophet said that they were held
[1:29:01] back to a specific
[1:29:04] moment Hitler didn't even realize it
[1:29:08] when he was preaching those sermons it
[1:29:10] was anointing people's evil heart and
[1:29:15] brother bham says that God on men to
[1:29:17] persecute the chws
[1:29:26] the prophet of God said two very
[1:29:27] powerful things and he says it in two
[1:29:30] places that I found brother bam says God
[1:29:33] cannot destroy the
[1:29:37] world until the people get in the spirit
[1:29:41] of destruction right that's
[1:29:44] right think about that my brother my
[1:29:46] sister because when you think about it
[1:29:49] you realize what's happening right
[1:29:52] now that's right the people are
[1:29:54] literally getting Prophet says you can't
[1:29:57] have a healing service until you get in
[1:29:59] the spirit of a healing service you
[1:30:00] can't have a Revival unless you're in
[1:30:02] the spirit of Revival listen you can't
[1:30:04] even have church until you're in the
[1:30:08] spirit and brother Brenham says God
[1:30:10] can't destroy the world until the world
[1:30:13] gets in the spirit of destruction that's
[1:30:16] what's happening right now under a six
[1:30:18] seal they don't realize that fourth
[1:30:20] dimension when they're feeding on Fox
[1:30:22] and CNN and YouTube I don't care what
[1:30:24] kind of feed you want to talk about they
[1:30:26] feed on Snapchat they feed on Instagram
[1:30:29] they feed on Facebook you say brother
[1:30:30] matter there's anything wrong with those
[1:30:32] nothing's wrong so long as you don't
[1:30:34] feed on the wrong
[1:30:36] things there's a reason young people
[1:30:38] it's called a
[1:30:41] feed cuz it's feeding you something and
[1:30:44] often times I find people want to be
[1:30:46] delivered of anxiety and depression and
[1:30:49] nervousness and fear and the very thing
[1:30:51] you want to be delivered from is the
[1:30:53] very thing that people
[1:30:56] feed
[1:30:57] right they don't realize that those
[1:31:00] Spirits are causing people to lose their
[1:31:09] minds you know what's so amazing though
[1:31:11] brother Ben brother Joel what's so
[1:31:12] amazing I have never turned on a tape of
[1:31:15] God's prophet and when the tape ended I
[1:31:17] felt
[1:31:19] panicked or depressed I have never
[1:31:22] opened this Bible and the closing of the
[1:31:24] Bible I just got so much fear and so
[1:31:26] much anxiety and so much worry no
[1:31:28] actually quite the opposite now when I
[1:31:30] didn't have faith I suddenly have faith
[1:31:33] when I had fear now I have belief I say
[1:31:36] it's time to stop feeding on the wrong
[1:31:38] things and start feeding on the body
[1:31:41] word of the son of man the only thing
[1:31:44] that'll give you faith for a
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:48] Rapture and they feed and they feed and
[1:31:50] they feed and they feed yeah
[1:31:54] and they're they're losing their
[1:31:57] minds people do you realize that my
[1:31:59] brother my sister they're losing their
[1:32:02] minds thank Lord feeding upon those
[1:32:06] Spirits oh I can hear brother brandham
[1:32:09] say but those 200 million demons that
[1:32:13] were held at the river Euphrates and he
[1:32:15] said they were released Upon A people I
[1:32:18] can hear a prophet say that they first
[1:32:20] before God can destroy the world he
[1:32:22] first the people have to get in the
[1:32:24] spirit of destruction under that sick
[1:32:26] seal that they're feeding upon they
[1:32:28] don't realize it's a pre-tribulation
[1:32:30] anointing to prepare them for
[1:32:32] Destruction I just happen to believe
[1:32:34] that if a false prophet could prophesy
[1:32:37] them into a tribulation brother what
[1:32:39] would a true Prophet prophesy me too if
[1:32:42] they could feed off a sick seal and It
[1:32:44] prepares them for a tribulation then
[1:32:46] what will feed in upon a seventh seal do
[1:32:49] my brother what is God preparing us for
[1:32:51] not destruction but to get out out of
[1:32:54] this place to snatch us out of leosia
[1:32:57] and I say snatch me oh God out of this
[1:33:00] old pest house let me feed upon the body
[1:33:03] word of the son of
[1:33:06] man because some people are preparing
[1:33:09] for Destruction but some people are
[1:33:12] preparing to get out of
[1:33:16] here oh the harao the snatching oh in a
[1:33:21] moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:33:23] brother bam said it be the last little
[1:33:25] pain you ever feel and a little sweep
[1:33:27] will come over your
[1:33:29] body I say oh my body says hallelujah my
[1:33:33] body says yes Lord even so come Lord
[1:33:40] Jesus notice this here they don't
[1:33:43] realize the very thing they're feeding
[1:33:44] upon is causing them to lose their
[1:33:47] mind that's right do you realize the
[1:33:50] very thing you're feeding on is giving
[1:33:53] you the mind of Christ oh yeah
[1:33:56] Hallelujah God I said the thing you're
[1:33:59] feeding on is giving you the mind of
[1:34:02] Jesus thank you
[1:34:04] Lord but notice this the brother bam
[1:34:07] says they get old men like Stalin ikan
[1:34:09] musolini Hitler to persecute the Jews
[1:34:12] naturally but also ecclesiastically the
[1:34:14] spirit loosed upon the bride now notice
[1:34:16] because brother brandham will show us
[1:34:18] and and and I don't want to get too
[1:34:20] teaching here today but but I I just
[1:34:22] want to show you for a moment if you you
[1:34:23] look into the because remember there'll
[1:34:25] be that everybody in the entire world
[1:34:27] will either be identified by The Sixth
[1:34:29] Seal or the seventh seal all Humanity
[1:34:32] will the entire world you'll either be
[1:34:35] identified by that Sixth Seal or that
[1:34:37] seventh seal which is the coming of
[1:34:40] Christ but we know brother Ram says that
[1:34:42] coming happens in three phases so you
[1:34:45] say when is the coming of Christ it's
[1:34:46] already begun brother say we waiting on
[1:34:48] the Rapture it's already
[1:34:50] started you say what is the body change
[1:34:53] I'm going to tell you you what the body
[1:34:54] change is the body change is my body
[1:34:56] getting what my soul already has
[1:35:00] received you are now the sons of God
[1:35:02] beloved not that you will be but you are
[1:35:05] now the Sons and Daughters of God you
[1:35:08] are reigning now with Christ on his
[1:35:12] throne and so notice brother Adam says
[1:35:14] that that under that six seal because
[1:35:17] you you watch this and you can go back
[1:35:19] and look at this for yourself in the
[1:35:21] seventh seal brother Brandon mentions
[1:35:22] that interval you remember that and he
[1:35:24] says that's the you got to watch that
[1:35:26] little interval of time because if you
[1:35:28] read your Bible you'll find that the
[1:35:29] first six seals are in Revelation six
[1:35:32] you'll find every single one of them
[1:35:34] what you won't find in Revelation 6 is
[1:35:36] the seventh seal that's right because
[1:35:39] brother baram says that there was a
[1:35:40] little interval of
[1:35:42] time and he says in that little interval
[1:35:45] of time what do you have between
[1:35:46] Revelation 6 where do you find re where
[1:35:48] do you find the seventh seal in
[1:35:50] Revelations chapter 8 brother bham says
[1:35:52] so what is reev ration 7 it is that
[1:35:55] little interval I'm taking to going to
[1:35:57] show you this just for a moment but he
[1:35:59] says in Revelation 7 and he says you
[1:36:03] have that little interval of time that's
[1:36:06] good and the prophet says what is that
[1:36:08] interval that's the
[1:36:12] 144,000 let's let's read it Revelations
[1:36:14] chapter 7 turn there quickly if you
[1:36:15] could in your Bible we just look at it
[1:36:17] for a moment you love the
[1:36:20] Lord notice this here in Revelation 7
[1:36:25] after these things after what
[1:36:28] things Revelation
[1:36:31] 6 after these things I saw four Angels
[1:36:34] standing on the four corners of the
[1:36:37] Earth holding the Four Winds of the
[1:36:39] earth that the wind should not blow on
[1:36:41] the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree
[1:36:45] I saw another Angel ascending from the
[1:36:47] East having the seal
[1:36:49] notice oh boy I wish I had another hour
[1:36:54] and I don't don't
[1:36:56] worry I know I
[1:36:58] don't but notice it's the Silling
[1:37:02] Angel brother don't you know that
[1:37:04] brother Brandon says what will the Jews
[1:37:07] receive I'm not talking about all Israel
[1:37:09] I'm talking about TW what I'm talking
[1:37:11] about 12,000 out of every single tribe
[1:37:13] making up 144,000 listen all Israel is
[1:37:17] not all Israel they might all be hdic
[1:37:19] Jews ashkanazi Jews spartic Jews and the
[1:37:22] diaspora they all came back to Jerusalem
[1:37:24] and you can see them all with their top
[1:37:26] hats and acidic Jews with their beads
[1:37:28] I'm not criticizing any of them but I'm
[1:37:30] going to tell you just cuz they dressed
[1:37:31] like a Jew don't mean they're really a
[1:37:33] Jew just because they know the Hebrew
[1:37:35] language don't mean that they're a true
[1:37:37] Jew listen you might know this message
[1:37:39] from the front to the back be able to
[1:37:41] quote it from 47 to 63 I don't mean
[1:37:44] you're a true elected son of Abraham
[1:37:46] there's only one thing that makes you a
[1:37:48] son of Abraham and that's faith in the
[1:37:50] word of God yes sir yes sir
[1:37:54] yes sir and notice those
[1:37:56] Jews
[1:37:57] 144,000 the prophet says that what will
[1:38:00] those two prophets of Revelations 11
[1:38:03] preach because brother bam says Israel
[1:38:06] will receive her
[1:38:08] prophets that's right she
[1:38:11] will Amos 3 the Lord will do nothing
[1:38:16] nothing until he first reveals it to his
[1:38:20] servants the prophets that's why it had
[1:38:24] to be a prophet that would turn the
[1:38:26] hearts of the Gentiles oh yeah back to
[1:38:28] the faith it would take the listen
[1:38:31] friends you say what's those Moses and
[1:38:32] Elijah going to do he's going to turn
[1:38:35] the hearts of the fathers back to the
[1:38:41] children and what will this message
[1:38:45] do it will turn oh somebody help me
[1:38:48] preach I say if a true prophet in the
[1:38:52] Revelations 11 brother bandam says what
[1:38:54] will they receive They will receive the
[1:38:57] very same message you received you say
[1:39:00] what will happen brother Matt a
[1:39:02] Pentecostal Revival will break out in
[1:39:05] Jerusalem it broke out in the upper room
[1:39:07] one day but it's going to break out
[1:39:09] again and those 144,000 are going to be
[1:39:12] sealed why brother M because a message
[1:39:16] from a
[1:39:17] prophet bro brings some Brother Band
[1:39:19] says and feast of the trumpets it will
[1:39:21] turn them back to the genuine wi
[1:39:23] atonement well brother if it can turn
[1:39:25] the Jews back to the genine atonement
[1:39:28] what will this message do to the Gentile
[1:39:30] Church it turns us back not to a faith
[1:39:34] but the faith of the Son of God don't
[1:39:37] you realize this word is an atonement
[1:39:40] for your
[1:39:42] life that's right the message of the
[1:39:45] hour is a bleeding
[1:39:48] word here brother random say the word
[1:39:50] bled for you the word you see that's
[1:39:52] what people want to do they want to
[1:39:54] separate Jesus from his word but he is
[1:39:56] his word people say I love Jesus well
[1:39:59] you don't love him if you don't love his
[1:40:01] word that's right just give me Jesus I
[1:40:04] don't need the message just give me
[1:40:05] Jesus what are you even saying right
[1:40:08] what you're saying is is you want your
[1:40:09] version and your creation of a figment
[1:40:13] of your imagination because my Jesus is
[1:40:16] his
[1:40:20] word and notice this here those two
[1:40:23] prophets will preach to them the same
[1:40:26] message you
[1:40:28] received the prophet says that that
[1:40:30] little interval of time is that little
[1:40:32] between this Revelations chapter 7 and
[1:40:35] it's a Silling Angel saying hurt not the
[1:40:38] Earth nor the sea verse three nor the
[1:40:41] trees till we have sealed the Servants
[1:40:42] of our God in their forehead and I heard
[1:40:46] the number of them which were sealed and
[1:40:47] there were so
[1:40:48] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[1:40:51] children of Israel so notice this here
[1:40:54] because this little interval of time is
[1:40:57] what takes place in between the six seal
[1:41:01] and the seventh
[1:41:03] seal now brother bam shows and I I want
[1:41:06] to be careful that I don't get bog too
[1:41:08] bogged down here you love the Lord
[1:41:11] tonight come
[1:41:12] on because the prophet of God shows us
[1:41:17] how that Jesus
[1:41:20] fulfilled the first three feast how many
[1:41:23] know
[1:41:24] that and brother bam says what were
[1:41:26] those three first three feasts the Feast
[1:41:28] of Passover he is our Pascal l 1
[1:41:31] Corinthians 15 he is our
[1:41:35] Passover and so notice this is so
[1:41:37] amazing that Jesus listen under the
[1:41:41] chemistry brother bham says that and we
[1:41:43] preached on it this morning that under
[1:41:46] the
[1:41:46] reformers it was the type of the
[1:41:49] inspection of the Lamb right that's
[1:41:52] right and he says that they would
[1:41:54] inspect the lamb but at the evening time
[1:41:55] the lamb had to be slain and the blood
[1:41:57] of the Lamb had to be put on the door L
[1:41:59] on the post come on and so the prophet
[1:42:02] of God says that under those reformers
[1:42:05] the chemistry notice those Jews those
[1:42:09] Jews all they had was the literal the
[1:42:11] chemistry of the blood of that lamb
[1:42:13] brother bam says they would go there
[1:42:15] every single year go kapor on the day of
[1:42:16] a atonement and the high priest would
[1:42:18] Aaron would enter in and it would it
[1:42:20] would bring it would bring atonement for
[1:42:22] the all of their children all of their
[1:42:23] families all of the husbands the wives
[1:42:25] all of their problems brother maram says
[1:42:27] so what was the token it was the life
[1:42:30] the
[1:42:31] chemistry the literal in other words
[1:42:34] when you say that what do you mean
[1:42:35] brother Matt I mean it was the actual
[1:42:37] mechanics that's
[1:42:40] right so the chemistry of that lamb the
[1:42:43] prophet say is what atoned for their
[1:42:46] sins and the brother Bon says that was a
[1:42:48] type of what God was doing under Luther
[1:42:50] and Wesley that it was it was was the
[1:42:53] mechanics oh brother and sister don't
[1:42:56] you realize why your anointing it wasn't
[1:42:58] a lion anointing that Paul was under it
[1:43:01] wasn't the it was the ox anointing that
[1:43:03] Mark was under the Book of Mark and the
[1:43:05] book but the Book of John was and the
[1:43:06] Book of Luke was the book of man and the
[1:43:09] Book of John was the book of The Flying
[1:43:10] Eagle listen friends you say how did
[1:43:12] those mothers under under the the Dark
[1:43:15] Ages take their children and a soldier
[1:43:18] would say deny Christ announce your
[1:43:20] faith or I'll shoot you and your entire
[1:43:22] family you say thank God I look at my
[1:43:24] children brother Jo I say thank God I
[1:43:26] didn't live there thank God you how many
[1:43:28] would say that thank God I didn't live
[1:43:30] there you know what though let me tell
[1:43:31] you something brother and sister you
[1:43:32] might have looked at them and think how
[1:43:34] could they do that brother Matt how
[1:43:36] could they do that they must have been
[1:43:37] superhuman super men super women brother
[1:43:41] they were just like you and they were
[1:43:43] just like me and just like you they had
[1:43:45] an impossible in front of them and just
[1:43:48] like them you have an impossible in
[1:43:50] front of you you say what's impossible
[1:43:52] to bring an over out of this darkness
[1:43:54] and out of this age in this 2024 it
[1:43:57] looks
[1:43:59] impossible how did they do it brother
[1:44:02] Matt I tell you what they couldn't have
[1:44:04] done it but under the Throne of God
[1:44:07] there was an anointing released from the
[1:44:12] throne and it was that Ox anointing and
[1:44:16] they literally you say how did they do
[1:44:18] it I'll tell you how that wasn't them
[1:44:20] doing it it was the anointing that they
[1:44:22] came under
[1:44:24] glory to God it was an anointing from
[1:44:26] the throne room of
[1:44:28] God how did Luther how did these men you
[1:44:31] look at men like Luther Charles Spurgeon
[1:44:33] Finning Knox Calvin Arthur pink read
[1:44:36] some of the writings of the Reformation
[1:44:39] you say how did these Brilliant Minds
[1:44:41] tell you how cuz brother bam said it
[1:44:42] wasn't those men it was the anointing of
[1:44:45] the face of a
[1:44:47] man and that was an anointing that was
[1:44:49] released listen don't you ever do away
[1:44:51] with that age of reformation I love it I
[1:44:54] read it I study it but I bring
[1:44:56] everything back not under the man
[1:44:58] anointing I bring it under the eagle
[1:45:00] anointing that's right because let me
[1:45:02] just say this your anointing isn't an ox
[1:45:05] and it's not a lion and it's not the
[1:45:07] Theology of a man but your anointing is
[1:45:10] an an eagle
[1:45:11] anointing and let me just say brother
[1:45:13] you will never overcome this age living
[1:45:16] under a man anointing you will never
[1:45:18] overcome this age living under some
[1:45:20] intellectual idea I'll just go further
[1:45:23] and say it's good to shout it's good to
[1:45:25] speak in tongues it's good to feel the
[1:45:26] Holy Ghost on your body but you won't
[1:45:29] always feel the Holy Ghost on your body
[1:45:31] you won't always feel like shouting you
[1:45:33] w't always feel like dancing come on
[1:45:35] somebody you might not always feel like
[1:45:37] you're up you may feel weigh down but
[1:45:39] when you get an eagle anointing it
[1:45:41] doesn't matter what you feel like
[1:45:44] brother it doesn't matter what your body
[1:45:46] feels like there's a
[1:45:49] faith down inside of your soul
[1:45:58] and notice than it was under that
[1:46:02] anointing it was under that flying eagle
[1:46:05] anointing and brother Brandon says that
[1:46:07] notice under those Harvest Passover
[1:46:11] think about
[1:46:12] that that as the Jews under the
[1:46:16] chemistry of that
[1:46:17] blood now remember God winked at
[1:46:21] it what does that mean when you wink at
[1:46:23] it means like it's okay I'll accept
[1:46:28] it because you can only serve God based
[1:46:31] upon the word that's been revealed to
[1:46:32] you and God will never hold a man
[1:46:34] accountable outside of what he's already
[1:46:36] revealed him in
[1:46:38] faith and brother Ram says that under
[1:46:40] those ages under think about that they
[1:46:42] they worshiped under the chemistry of
[1:46:44] that blood but let me give you the words
[1:46:46] of a prophet in this in this age the
[1:46:49] full power of the token life has been
[1:46:53] released to the body of Christ you don't
[1:46:55] live under a partial anointing brother
[1:46:57] you've got the whole
[1:47:01] thing you say what's it to do brother
[1:47:03] Matt what's it to do under that partial
[1:47:07] they can only live partial Christian
[1:47:09] lives but under the
[1:47:11] fullness listen you say what are you
[1:47:13] brother Matt I am the continuation Jesus
[1:47:16] was the firstborn of the new creation
[1:47:18] you are the continuation of that same
[1:47:21] life that's right yeah and brother bham
[1:47:25] says that in the evening time the token
[1:47:29] changes from the
[1:47:32] mechanics from the substance of the Lamb
[1:47:36] because as much as that Jew wanted to
[1:47:39] the problem was that the nature or the
[1:47:43] life of the Lamb could not come back on
[1:47:47] the
[1:47:49] worshipper you say oh brother then what
[1:47:52] do you believe
[1:47:53] that has to mean that under this
[1:47:57] sacrifice you don't just receive his
[1:48:00] gifts you don't just receive his
[1:48:02] knowledge you receive
[1:48:05] him and when you get him you get his
[1:48:08] gifts and when you get him you get his
[1:48:10] his knowledge when you get him you get
[1:48:12] his word because brother bandham said it
[1:48:14] is the literal life the token is the
[1:48:16] literal life I'm afraid we've majored on
[1:48:20] the wrong things brother I love the
[1:48:21] gifts of God let me say I love the
[1:48:24] miraculous can I just preach here for a
[1:48:26] moment I love Miracles I've witnessed so
[1:48:29] many in my life how could I disbelieve
[1:48:31] now I I be honest I believe anybody that
[1:48:34] would ever speak against preach against
[1:48:35] speaking in tongues is only because they
[1:48:36] never have because if you ever
[1:48:38] have very first thing I ever thought
[1:48:41] when I came out of my prayer closet
[1:48:42] after speaking in tongues for hours I
[1:48:44] thought who in the world could ever
[1:48:46] preach against that I'm not I'm not
[1:48:48] preaching on anybody I'm just saying if
[1:48:50] you ever felt God you want more of
[1:48:54] that that's right you ever witness a
[1:48:58] miracle then you say God give me more
[1:49:01] miracles but can I just say and please
[1:49:04] don't misunderstand me can I just say if
[1:49:06] I never see another miracle in my life
[1:49:09] but the nature of my
[1:49:11] lamb can come back on my heart that I
[1:49:15] will take that over anything I can see
[1:49:17] with my eyes I say God give me that
[1:49:20] literal Life of Christ give me that
[1:49:22] token Zoey life that changes who I
[1:49:26] am do we realize this was the purpose of
[1:49:29] the token in the evening time yes sir we
[1:49:33] have the former rain we have the
[1:49:36] mechanics brother now what we need is
[1:49:39] that Dynamic power say what does that
[1:49:42] Dynamic power do does make me shout it
[1:49:43] might might make you jump might make you
[1:49:45] cry might make you dance here's one
[1:49:46] thing it will do it will bring you into
[1:49:49] the very image of Jesus Christ
[1:49:52] the very nature of the Life of
[1:49:58] Christ can I go just a minute further
[1:50:02] hello is that all right brother Ben told
[1:50:05] me to take my time I've taken it as what
[1:50:08] people are saying you did Brother Matt
[1:50:10] you took
[1:50:11] it because I want to get to one point
[1:50:13] then we'll
[1:50:15] conclude because remember it was under
[1:50:18] under that under that Passover think
[1:50:21] about that my brother my sister as
[1:50:23] brother bam says that as those Jews were
[1:50:25] going to sacrifice the Pascal
[1:50:27] lamb as they did for
[1:50:31] generations and as they were sacrificing
[1:50:34] the Pascal lamb on
[1:50:36] Passover the Lamb of God was hanging on
[1:50:40] a
[1:50:43] cross they didn't know it but the
[1:50:46] prophet of God said in one
[1:50:49] moment thousands of years that's right
[1:50:52] thousands of accepting the blood of an
[1:50:54] animal
[1:50:56] ceased at that
[1:50:58] moment that's why the prophet of God in
[1:51:00] the indictment says that in one moment
[1:51:02] when the word was crucified in this
[1:51:04] generation denominations are dead and
[1:51:07] God doesn't deal with them anymore and
[1:51:10] he said that's only happened recently
[1:51:12] that's
[1:51:14] right that's why the prophet of God said
[1:51:16] they'll go to church thinking they're
[1:51:17] worshiping God and they're worshiping
[1:51:19] the devil and they don't know it
[1:51:25] as they were sacrificing that Pascal
[1:51:27] lamb the Lamb of God was hanging on a
[1:51:29] cross and did you know that as they were
[1:51:31] offering the Feast of the Feast of of of
[1:51:34] of unleavened bread Jesus was in the
[1:51:39] grave and as they were offering the
[1:51:41] Feast of first fruits he was getting up
[1:51:46] brother
[1:51:50] Hallelujah and imagine that the prophet
[1:51:52] he fulfilled all three in his ministry
[1:51:55] yes sir Passover he is our Pascal
[1:52:00] Passover Lamb thank you Lord Paul says
[1:52:03] he is the first fruits from the
[1:52:07] dead if there's a first fruit from the
[1:52:10] dead brother there must be more
[1:52:13] coming I said if there's a first fruit
[1:52:15] there must be a second and a third and a
[1:52:17] fourth and a fifth you say who are they
[1:52:19] I happen to believe it's my papa I
[1:52:21] happen to believe it's my m all I
[1:52:23] believe he was the first fruits but many
[1:52:24] of they they all the dead in Christ
[1:52:26] shall rise
[1:52:29] first but notice this the brother Ram
[1:52:32] says that notice now what do you have
[1:52:35] after now you say brother Matt what what
[1:52:38] is how does this have to do with Ruth
[1:52:39] I'll tell you how because Ruth enters
[1:52:41] Bethlehem Judea with Naomi now why was
[1:52:45] Naomi entering her
[1:52:49] Homeland well you read it
[1:52:52] because of a
[1:52:54] famine but that's why brother brandham
[1:52:57] could say that Hitler and Stalin was the
[1:52:59] tenderloving hand of
[1:53:02] Jehovah Ruth didn't know it that it was
[1:53:05] the Famine of Judges that God sent to
[1:53:08] drive her back to her
[1:53:13] Homeland and Ruth
[1:53:16] enters Bethlehem Judea at the beginning
[1:53:19] of barley Harvest now if you study that
[1:53:22] you'll know that there were bar that
[1:53:23] those first three feasts were under that
[1:53:25] barley Harvest first fruits Passover
[1:53:28] first unleavened bread and first fruits
[1:53:31] but brother bham says that notice what
[1:53:33] was Ruth doing it was a type of the
[1:53:35] spring because barley cens in spring
[1:53:39] come right and it was what was that it
[1:53:41] was her coming during the age of the
[1:53:43] spring teaching rain you say what was
[1:53:45] that spring teaching ring go look it up
[1:53:47] the prophet tells you it's Mora Mora
[1:53:50] what does it mean teaching brother bham
[1:53:51] used that to show us that the isua
[1:53:54] street Pentecost was not the true
[1:53:57] restoration of
[1:54:00] Pentecost well brother if that wasn't
[1:54:02] the TR then what is
[1:54:05] this and brother Ram says that what was
[1:54:07] that it was a restoration of gifts but
[1:54:09] the preaching the teaching rain the
[1:54:11] spring rain barley Harvest spring rain
[1:54:14] how did they even came what was that
[1:54:16] spring rain brother man it was the
[1:54:17] message of the
[1:54:19] hour it was Ruth and Naomi oh
[1:54:25] Hallelujah coming under that barley
[1:54:29] Harvest oh brother but she wasn't going
[1:54:32] to stay there that's right because it
[1:54:34] wasn't just going to be a spring Harvest
[1:54:36] she was also going to you say when did
[1:54:38] she meet Boaz go read your Bible she
[1:54:40] meets him at the threshing floor at the
[1:54:42] beginning of the wheat Harvest I'm
[1:54:45] talking about a wheat Harvest oh
[1:54:48] somebody help me preach here tonight and
[1:54:51] what did Boaz give her the beginning of
[1:54:52] that wheat Harvest he gave her six
[1:54:54] measures of barley what was it drop her
[1:54:57] a little bit of wheat drop her a little
[1:54:58] bit of of meal every now and then what
[1:55:01] was the church receiving under Luther a
[1:55:03] little bit of meal what were they
[1:55:04] receiving under Wesley a little bit more
[1:55:06] measure of meal but what were they going
[1:55:08] to come in this seventh age it wasn't
[1:55:10] going to be a meal from The Messengers
[1:55:13] it was going to be Christ
[1:55:16] [Applause]
[1:55:17] himself yes sir I looked that up brother
[1:55:20] you know what that means threshing floor
[1:55:22] when when Ruth went to the threshing
[1:55:23] floor and met Boaz I just clicked on
[1:55:26] that word I thought what is a threshing
[1:55:28] floor I'll read it straight from the my
[1:55:30] little my little study hate it says the
[1:55:33] threshing floor was where they separated
[1:55:36] the wheat from the
[1:55:38] shook come on oh glory to God it's where
[1:55:43] the winnowing took place where God said
[1:55:46] I'm no longer going to call you Church
[1:55:49] you won't be identified in judges I'm
[1:55:51] going to call you bright I'm going to
[1:55:53] make you different I'm going to separate
[1:55:56] a
[1:55:57] people unto
[1:56:03] myself and the prophet of God says
[1:56:06] notice this here I'm just going to close
[1:56:07] here I'm out of time I'm in
[1:56:11] overtime nine minutes in overtime
[1:56:15] okay the prophet of God shows us that
[1:56:18] then what happens after those first
[1:56:20] three barley Harvest Feast he has the
[1:56:22] brother bam calls in the Feast of
[1:56:23] trumpets that long Pentecostal Feast for
[1:56:26] seven sabbaths that's right from the
[1:56:29] Feast of Paso from the Feast of of from
[1:56:31] the
[1:56:32] crucifixion brother bandam says that 50
[1:56:34] days seven weeks seven sevens there was
[1:56:37] a group of people gathered in an upper
[1:56:39] room waiting on the promise of the
[1:56:42] father and under that Feast of Pentecost
[1:56:45] when they were sacrificing the Feast of
[1:56:48] Pentecost the Holy Ghost was descending
[1:56:51] in cloven tongues
[1:56:53] and brother bham says that what would
[1:56:55] they do at that way at that at that
[1:56:56] barley Harvest I love this that they
[1:56:59] would take part of that
[1:57:01] barley and that high priest would wave
[1:57:04] that first
[1:57:07] barley you know what's so powerful about
[1:57:10] that brother Ben is that I looked that
[1:57:12] up and one of the uh Jewish historians
[1:57:14] was showing how that it wasn't bare
[1:57:17] barley he didn't just take what was that
[1:57:18] wave sheath listen friends I'll just go
[1:57:20] and tell you what I believe was the wave
[1:57:21] sheath I believe that we have the wave
[1:57:23] sheath in this
[1:57:24] hour and I believe one came to maturity
[1:57:27] does this church believe that sir I said
[1:57:30] I believe he came to maturity and he was
[1:57:31] waved you say what was that that first
[1:57:34] fruit was only an ins sign that the rest
[1:57:37] of the barley would come to fruit to
[1:57:38] come to
[1:57:40] maturity but you know what's so powerful
[1:57:42] when that priest would wave it the Bible
[1:57:45] says he would lift it and he would bring
[1:57:48] it back and he would lift it and he
[1:57:50] would bring it back and it said he was
[1:57:53] saying God I give it to you but you gave
[1:57:56] it back to me I give it to you but you
[1:58:00] gave it back to me listen friends you'll
[1:58:02] never give God anything that he doesn't
[1:58:04] give you back tfold of what You' given
[1:58:07] him and he was giving that
[1:58:10] barley and that writer said notice it
[1:58:13] wasn't just bare barley but he took it
[1:58:16] and he put the barley in a vessel come
[1:58:20] on you you see what people have done is
[1:58:23] they've worshiped The Vessel they've
[1:58:25] deified The Vessel say brother Brandon
[1:58:28] was he the way not William Mary and
[1:58:29] Brandon was not the wave sheath but the
[1:58:31] word that was in his life it was never
[1:58:33] about the vessel brother Joel it was
[1:58:35] about the word oh what did we see in
[1:58:38] this generation it wasn't just a
[1:58:40] Kentucky hillbilly it wasn't just a man
[1:58:42] who can do Miracles it was the word
[1:58:45] coming to maturity in a human vessel and
[1:58:48] if God could bring that vessel to
[1:58:50] maturity I said
[1:58:52] God anoint this vessel oh God mature
[1:58:56] this barley Lord Jesus yes
[1:59:00] sir thank you Lord it wasn't going to
[1:59:03] stay barley though because there was
[1:59:05] going to be a harvest feast and she was
[1:59:08] going to meet Boaz at wheat
[1:59:12] Harvest oh there's so much more to it
[1:59:15] brother and sister I don't have time to
[1:59:16] preach
[1:59:17] it she met
[1:59:19] him and he gives her six minutes of
[1:59:24] barley what's it what's he doing because
[1:59:27] you notice at the wheat Harvest at The
[1:59:29] Barley Harvest those first three and
[1:59:32] then you have that long Feast of
[1:59:34] Pentecost and brother bandham says that
[1:59:35] Feast of Pentecost goes all the way to
[1:59:38] the
[1:59:39] Rapture I say brother when did Pentacost
[1:59:42] stop it all it does didn't stop brother
[1:59:44] how do you know cuz I'm still
[1:59:45] here and that Pentecostal Feast goes all
[1:59:48] the way till I get my body Chang and I
[1:59:50] get out of this world oh you say brother
[1:59:53] Matt what do you believe I believe this
[1:59:55] is the fullness of Pentecost when is it
[1:59:58] the fullness when my body is
[2:00:02] changed and notice it wasn't going to be
[2:00:04] a wave sheath if you go look at
[2:00:06] Leviticus
[2:00:08] 23 that when they would offer those the
[2:00:11] wheat first fruit was not going to be
[2:00:14] just a single barley a single crop come
[2:00:18] on but go look in Leviticus 16 and
[2:00:20] Leviticus 23 what you'll find
[2:00:22] is that under that wheat Harvest there
[2:00:24] was also a wave
[2:00:26] offering thank you Lord but it wasn't a
[2:00:29] single barly brother it was a whole
[2:00:37] loaf see brother Matt what are you
[2:00:39] saying I'm saying that God never
[2:00:41] intended to bottle up everything in one
[2:00:43] man named William brandham it was never
[2:00:46] going to be about one gift and one man
[2:00:49] listen I'm thankful for that it was a
[2:00:50] oneman Ministry but God intended not
[2:00:53] just to have one man who we all look to
[2:00:55] but he wants an entire loaf of
[2:01:00] bread but you know what's so powerful is
[2:01:04] that actually under that wheat Harvest
[2:01:06] it was two
[2:01:08] loaves I looked at that in my Bible it's
[2:01:11] two loaves of
[2:01:13] bread that's right that actually under
[2:01:15] that Pentecostal wheat Feast that first
[2:01:17] fruit was two loaves of bread come on
[2:01:21] now now I don't have authority so so you
[2:01:23] take this or leave it I just say it that
[2:01:25] way you know what I
[2:01:27] believe I believe those two loaves was
[2:01:30] going to represent two
[2:01:34] women because when Boaz redeems
[2:01:39] Ruth he redeems Naomi with
[2:01:42] her and God says I'm not going to leave
[2:01:45] listen friend you say brother Matt
[2:01:46] what's happening I tell you what you
[2:01:47] turn on the news and I tell you what's
[2:01:49] happening right now two Prophets are
[2:01:52] about to appear to that little land of
[2:01:53] Judea and when the entire world
[2:01:56] surrounds her in Zechariah 13 the Bible
[2:01:58] says the entire all entire Gentile Army
[2:02:01] of all the armies of the world a United
[2:02:04] Nations Army will surround her to
[2:02:06] Encompass her I stood there in
[2:02:07] Armageddon in the valley of megiddo and
[2:02:10] I looked over that great big old field
[2:02:12] vast as far as the eye can see I told
[2:02:14] the brother with me I said can you
[2:02:15] imagine the prophet of God said that the
[2:02:18] battle that started in heaven and Satan
[2:02:20] was kicked down to the Earth ends right
[2:02:22] here in this field right here when all
[2:02:25] the armies of the worth will surround
[2:02:27] her and she's surrounded you think she
[2:02:29] surrounded Now by Iran and Hamas and you
[2:02:32] know all of these armies and everything
[2:02:34] that's happening friends you say brother
[2:02:36] Matt what do you believe I believe that
[2:02:38] the same God who protected her in the
[2:02:40] desert is the same God who fed her a
[2:02:43] Mana in the wilderness the same God who
[2:02:46] gave water out of a rock is the same God
[2:02:49] who said I'll fight for Israel be I'll
[2:02:52] come down into battle of myself you say
[2:02:54] brother M what do you believe before
[2:02:56] that ever takes place there's got to be
[2:02:58] a gentile bride that's taken out of this
[2:03:01] world Listen friends don't you realize
[2:03:04] you are in the
[2:03:08] way and God needs to remove you out of
[2:03:12] the
[2:03:14] way it's happening right now my brother
[2:03:16] my sister Here Comes little Ruth
[2:03:22] Here Comes Naomi and she's entering
[2:03:27] under that
[2:03:30] trumpet
[2:03:32] persecution
[2:03:34] famine and here she comes and here's
[2:03:37] little Ruth both identified in
[2:03:42] Redemption Lord say brother Matt what
[2:03:44] happened I'm going to tell you what
[2:03:45] happened my brother my sister a little
[2:03:48] insignificant woman
[2:03:52] who has no
[2:03:55] explanation for where she found herself
[2:03:58] and I just want to say that's my
[2:04:00] testimony how are you here I have no
[2:04:03] explanation for it brother all I can say
[2:04:06] if you've heard nothing I've said let me
[2:04:07] this say it's Grace Grace Amazing Grace
[2:04:13] oh I'm just want to say thank you God
[2:04:15] for grace that you've given to my life
[2:04:17] thank you that you gave me eyes that can
[2:04:19] see and ears that can hear because the
[2:04:24] word listen Brothers musicians could
[2:04:27] come the word that was restored in this
[2:04:31] generation I stood there in Israel last
[2:04:33] August my first time ever getting to
[2:04:35] go just right before those October 7th
[2:04:38] attacks and I I wanted to see something
[2:04:41] something I've studied for years and not
[2:04:43] recommending you study it I I just got
[2:04:46] interested in
[2:04:47] it but if you ever do a study on
[2:04:50] manuscripts and they got the original
[2:04:52] how you have the Hebrew Bible the Tanakh
[2:04:55] where did it come from because we know
[2:04:56] it was never written down Orly it was
[2:04:58] passed down David said I'll not hide
[2:05:00] them I'll tell them but there but but
[2:05:02] you notice those Hebrew manuscripts and
[2:05:05] I stood there if you ever get to get the
[2:05:08] chance to go there it'll change your
[2:05:10] life don't go right now I would
[2:05:12] recommend it not now be honest though
[2:05:15] it's hard for me not to go right now you
[2:05:17] just play something real soft just real
[2:05:20] soft and I stood there and and I wanted
[2:05:24] to see it so bad it was the it was the
[2:05:26] Israeli Museum and they have a little
[2:05:28] exhibit called The Shrine of the book oh
[2:05:31] it's so powerful stood there and and
[2:05:34] down inside of that Shrine is where they
[2:05:36] keep the Dead Sea Scrolls and it's where
[2:05:38] they keep the what they call the Aleppo
[2:05:40] codex the Aleppo codex is the it's the
[2:05:43] one of the most Dependable reliable
[2:05:46] manuscripts that they have for the
[2:05:48] Hebrew Bible book of Isaiah Book of Ruth
[2:05:50] all of these books that you have here um
[2:05:53] you know in your Old
[2:05:54] Testament and those those that Aleppo
[2:05:57] codex is from
[2:05:59] 1,000
[2:06:00] ad and it was a it was a tribe called
[2:06:03] the mastic people the mazeres were were
[2:06:06] like the you know a sectarian but they
[2:06:08] they preserve the word and they have
[2:06:10] perfect cannot perfect you know Hebrew
[2:06:13] writing and it was dated from 1,000
[2:06:19] a so you say what was what was the
[2:06:21] Hebrew Bible based upon writings from a
[2:06:24] thousand years after
[2:06:26] Christ and that's what made the the the
[2:06:29] Dead Sea scroll Discovery so powerful is
[2:06:33] when they that little ban Shepherd
[2:06:36] throws a rock in that cave and he hears
[2:06:38] clay jars break and he goes in there and
[2:06:41] he
[2:06:42] discovers and what what he discovers is
[2:06:46] Bible
[2:06:47] manuscripts that's right that now don't
[2:06:50] date from 1,000 ad but 300
[2:06:56] BC third Century sorry BC that actually
[2:07:00] and what they found when they opened up
[2:07:02] the Dead Sea Scrolls and they opened up
[2:07:05] the book of Isaiah the Isaiah scroll and
[2:07:08] they compared it to 1000 ad it was a
[2:07:12] perfect match that's right because the
[2:07:15] God who created the universe can
[2:07:17] preserve his own
[2:07:18] word yes sir and he doesn't need man he
[2:07:22] doesn't need scientist he doesn't need
[2:07:24] an he don't need an education God
[2:07:26] preserves his own
[2:07:27] word and I stood there and it was so
[2:07:29] powerful because they were they were
[2:07:31] sitting there showing this you could see
[2:07:33] the entire lipo codex written out the
[2:07:35] original Hebrew
[2:07:36] manuscript and then underneath that they
[2:07:40] point to the date of the discovery of
[2:07:42] those Dead Sea Scrolls and I stood there
[2:07:44] and almost just I was so
[2:07:48] floored because they quote a scripture
[2:07:52] out of Isaiah that says behold the word
[2:07:56] will return to Zion out of Zion shall
[2:07:59] return the law yes the Torah the four
[2:08:02] first five books of of
[2:08:05] Moses and the discovery of the Dead Sea
[2:08:08] Scrolls brother you know when it
[2:08:10] was
[2:08:13] 1947 and when Obama visits Israel
[2:08:17] Benjamin na takes him to the Shrine of
[2:08:19] the book points as you can see the
[2:08:20] picture and he's pointing to it and he
[2:08:22] says you don't let anybody tell me that
[2:08:24] this isn't our land and that we don't
[2:08:26] belong here because before God ever
[2:08:28] brought us here he first restored the
[2:08:30] word back to the
[2:08:33] people do you realize the Jews look at
[2:08:37] the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls as
[2:08:40] a supernatural
[2:08:42] Vindication that the time was
[2:08:47] right and that actually in 1947 they
[2:08:50] become a nation in 48 but in 1947 the
[2:08:54] Jews say before God could give us our
[2:08:56] homeland back he first had to restore
[2:08:59] the word back to
[2:09:01] us brother I about fainted sitting there
[2:09:04] in that Shrine of the book and my mind
[2:09:06] began to think at the moment they're
[2:09:08] discovering the Dead Sea Scrolls a
[2:09:10] whirlwind on at the time they're
[2:09:14] discovering the de at the time that that
[2:09:15] that God's moving on the heart of of of
[2:09:17] Naomi God's moving on the heart of Ruth
[2:09:20] and at the time they're discovering the
[2:09:21] word the word is beginning to be
[2:09:23] recorded on magnetic
[2:09:25] tap brother you can't make this stuff up
[2:09:28] God's got a perfect
[2:09:31] plan and at the moment the word is being
[2:09:34] restored to the Jews and Naomi is being
[2:09:37] redeemed Ruth is being redeemed with
[2:09:39] boas oh stand to your feet my brother
[2:09:42] and my sister I ain't got time to preach
[2:09:44] anymore I would to say this I believe
[2:09:46] it's real and I believe it's later than
[2:09:48] we think say brother Matt what do you
[2:09:50] believe I believe two prophets are about
[2:09:52] to appear to those 144,000 but
[2:09:56] something's got to take place before
[2:09:58] that oh yeah say what is it brother Matt
[2:10:03] listen to me my brother my
[2:10:07] sister oh
[2:10:10] my if a message from two
[2:10:14] prophets could turn the
[2:10:16] hearts of those backslid and Jews to the
[2:10:20] genuine atonement of
[2:10:22] Christ then what ought this message from
[2:10:26] a gentile Prophet it won't turn us back
[2:10:29] to traditions of Pentecost it won't turn
[2:10:32] us back to traditions of denominations
[2:10:34] it won't turn us back to traditions of
[2:10:36] men it'll turn us back to the genuine
[2:10:39] atonement of
[2:10:41] Christ Christ
[2:10:43] impersonated in his in his family bow
[2:10:47] your heads with me every head bowed
[2:10:48] every eye
[2:10:49] closed Lord thank you for your
[2:10:52] word how could we describe it Lord It's
[2:10:56] Indescribable how could we explain it
[2:10:59] Lord it sometimes seems
[2:11:02] unexplainable but one way I would
[2:11:05] describe it
[2:11:06] Lord one way I would describe that I'm
[2:11:10] here in
[2:11:12] 2024 in a
[2:11:14] midst of a world that's Fallen
[2:11:18] apart but yet there's a love for this
[2:11:21] word down inside of my soul I just say
[2:11:25] Lord it sounds too good to be true but I
[2:11:28] want to raise my hand and say thank you
[2:11:30] God thank you for eyes that can see oh
[2:11:34] you ought to tell him that my brother my
[2:11:36] sister you are to say God thank you for
[2:11:39] eyes that can see thank you for an ears
[2:11:41] that can hear thank you for a body that
[2:11:44] can praise thank you for a mouth that
[2:11:46] can worship thank you Lord God for a
[2:11:49] place we can gather and be with one
[2:11:51] another and share Lord God not just in
[2:11:54] Lord our our natural problems but share
[2:11:57] in the same promises and the same hope
[2:11:59] and the same faith in a supernatural God
[2:12:03] for Lord truly you have done a wonderful
[2:12:05] work in this generation and we just want
[2:12:08] to say thank you God that we're part of
[2:12:10] it I'd invite anybody who who's just
[2:12:13] stuck in that judges Circle I'd invite
[2:12:15] you to come out of that Circle there's a
[2:12:17] story being written and let me say this
[2:12:19] brother whether you believe it or not
[2:12:21] it's true whether you accept or not
[2:12:23] whether I preach it or not it's still
[2:12:25] the truth whether I say whether you ever
[2:12:28] get part of it it's still happening God
[2:12:30] will the the spirit of God will pass you
[2:12:32] right by I say take your moment take
