Lord this morning amen I just woke up this morning with such a anticipation of coming and being here with you and and uh being church again and I just a highlight of my week and I I know you do many things throughout the week but isn't it good to gather together and fellowship with those of like Precious faith and just to feel the spirit of God Among Us and to hear the word preach isn't that a good thing amen don't don't you love the Lord this morning yes amen I believe you do 1 Peter 1:22 1 Peter 1:22 and 23 he says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently yes being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorrupt corruptible oh I love that by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated the prescription for the disease of sin is the same as it has always been the prescription has always been acts 238 right Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that is the prescription that was given as an antidote for sin and it works today you might find a a quack doctor if we could say it that way you might find a a preacher you might find a priest or or a rabbi that would tell you something different but I'm here to tell you that I know that this is the right prescription because I've taken it and it works brother bom said it this way he said Peter said I'll give you an everlasting prescription for you and to your children and them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said not come and join but repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the results yeah you shall receive the results the Holy Ghost for the promise this prescription is for you and to your children amen aren't you glad it's still effective today I wonder if there's anybody in the building this morning that could testify that this prescription still works I know it works because I've taken it and I know what it can do to a person who's lost in sin I wonder if you can testify to it today I know what it does I know he still Chang his life I know he still heals the sick I know he still does things for people I know he can change your life if you're struggling and wondering what to believe and what to do won't you take the prescription today and recognize it still works it works every bit as good as it did in brother bram's time it works every bit as good as it did in Peter's time it still works this morning and I want us to understand that with all Clarity today the word still works it's always worked it's it's repentance and Faith repentance and Faith which baptism is simply the action of faith that says Lord I'm G to I'm going to walk what what I'm G to I'm going to do what I say I believe I'm going to identify myself with Christians I'm going to be buried in a watery grave I'm going to go through as I believe that you rose from the dead I'm going to raise from dead trespasses and sins and so baptism is an act of faith that follows repentance and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen I'm so glad it works where would we be without the prescription sir but I want us to understand this morning that we we must have faith now uh Jesus said this he said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my words believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life that's past tense the BR said you always had it amen yeah right but you didn't know it when you believe he said hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life pass can't go back right can't be lost oh my what a blessing that is to know this morning that you've passed from Death un life now we know that to hear as I want to speak to you this morning on uh on how that we are born by the word into the bright age or into the age that we're living in now we know that to hear uh is to understand that's what that word actually means he that heareth my word not just makes out or or hear it with his ears but but understand it so on the day of Pentecost they had to understand it well enough to to go and be baptized right they they had to understand it wasn't some big mystical something it wasn't that you have to know exactly how the Millennium is going to work and exactly what the new city is going to look like that's not what you have to understand but there's got to be something inside of you that has the capacity to understand and then to make you believe and obey the word of God and so what happens is then he said it not just makes out of hears with its ears but understand it anybody can hear it a prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute a drunker can hear it a liar can hear it still remain a liar but he that understandeth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life now John 6:44 Jesus said no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I love this because I use this against the devil brother Kevin when the devil tries to tell you well you're not a child of God you don't belong in church you tell him I couldn't have come unless he drew me I couldn't have ever believed in the first place unless he called me no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day what a promise that is now these folks on the day of Pentecost they proved that they understood what Peter preached because when they took the medicine it had the intended effect now the intended effect was not staggering like drunk men you understand that was the side effect right the intended effect was not even speaking with tongues that was the side effect but the effect was freedom from sin the effect was the antidote from sin right so the effect of the drug if we can say it that way of the prescription is that is that we would be free from the sickness of Sin from the disease of sin that we would be inoculated from it that we would be actually not just freed for a moment but freed forever that once amen what when Jesus died for your sins on the cross what did he do he took your penalty and that penalty it became an inoculation his blood becomes an inoculation for sin all right right so so they actually he became sin for us which is why how they make an inoculation or vaccine or at least he used to in the old days they'd take a a part of the of the actual virus and they would make an antivirus or antidote oh I love that this morning I believe that he is the antidote to sin yes so they but they had the intended effect and it showed that they understood and you being here this morning and believing the word and and following the word of the hour that's the uh the effect of the word in your life the Holy Ghost being in your life it shows you understood what what the gospel said now and we know that because in Acts 2:41 it says then they that gladly how many want to gladly receive the word I love the fact they didn't receive it as some kind of a oh no now we're going to have to believe the message now we're going to have to quit cutting our hair now we're no they gladly receive the word and when you hear it right when you understand it it's not a drudgery it's not a set of dos and don'ts it's not a no it's a freedom they gladly received the word and so they were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayer and they continued proving that they were inoculated it wasn't a temporary cure it wasn't some aspirin that they were given it wasn't going to shaking a preacher's hand it wasn't joining a church it wasn't saying I believe the message whatever they got kept them in the apostles Doctrine whatever they got on the day of Pentecost kept them in church whatever oh God you say well I don't know I have a hard time coming to the house of God maybe you need to get the inoculation and it'll keep you in the house of God yes [Applause] sir they proved that they were born of the word because their lives manifested the word John 8:31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him how many believe him today you believe him he said if you believe me if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free shall make you free oh I love that this morning now the reason they could be born on acts two is because the word was preached in its fullness yeah we know that Christ was the fullness of the word manifested he was all of the Old Testament wrapped up in a body yeah all of the prophecies wrapped up in a body that was what Christ was he was everything that David said and everything that that Isaiah said and everything that all the prophets said about him he was all of it he fulfilled all of it he said in the volume of the book it's written of me yeah right this day this scripture is fulfilled what was it he was the fullness of the word manifested the Bible says John bear witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and Grace for Grace we received his fullness Christ is not a type he is not a portion he is the fullness right he is the fullness Colossians 1:19 it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell someone Say fullness this morning all the fullness dwell in Christ Colossians 2:9 for in him dwelleth how much all the fullness of the godhead bodily in him he is the fullness he was manifested in his fullness on the earth he was manifested in his fullness again remember the corn of wheat had to fall into the ground and die and we'll talk some more about that later but he was manifested in his fullness to the believing Jews at Pentecost but we're taught that before the gospel goes back to the Jews he promised to manifest himself in his fullness again in John 12:20 it says there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast and the same came therefore to Philip which was a beta of Galilee and desired him saying sir we would see Jesus so the Greeks the the Gentiles that's us they wanted an audience with Christ and philli cometh and tth Andrew and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say to you except a corn of wheat fall in the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so his ministry on the Earth was to the Jews I hope I'm not moving through this too fast this morning but I want you to catch it his ministry to the Jews on the was on the earth to was to the Jews but now his ministry was going to change by his death burial and resurrection and he was going to come back in his fullness on the day of Pentecost but it wouldn't be in one body it would be in a many membered body we heard this preach last night but I had these notes already but it's just it it was a Min membered body it was the pillar of fire splitting himself up into 120 members in the upper room right so now what happened he he went into the ground yeah he died Oh my he rose again and he and all that was in Christ someone say all was poured into what the church yeah the fullness was poured into the body yeah now I'm not the entire body but the Joe's not the entire body but all of us together yeah this church isn't even the entire body right it's only a representative of the entire body right but every Church all around the world there's there's Believers and unbelievers and make Believers but there's some real Believers all around the world that make up the body of Christ right and them being in the body of Christ you being the body of Christ means the fullness came to you it come at Pentecost now he went into the ground and produced Pentecostal fruit and Ephesians 1:22 it tells us he has put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness now watch what what's the fullness now the fullness was in of godhead uh he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a man right the person of Jesus Christ but during the Gentile age where is his fullness his fullness Is Us right collectively right each one of you having a portion so his body the fullness of him that filth all in all so we are his body that wheat seed fell into the ground and it died now we know that Christ had to fall into the ground and die but brother bam taught us that also that first church had to fall into the ground and die and we find in the scriptures in Revelation 2:4 he said nevertheless I have someone against thee because thou Hast left thy first love right just a few years after Pentecost brother steart after receiving him in their full in his fullness the church began to backslide right it begin to Die Why did it die a new generation begin to come up that wasn't there at Pentecost yeah sir right and they never receive what they received at Pentecost and it begin to die right and as it it had to die it was meant to die because otherwise it would have been raptured right there but there was more to the body right amen so they they had to die but and Jude 3 Jude wrote in in 30 years after the death of Christ beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you you should earnestly someone say earnestly earnestly that means with Zeal with Vigor you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints yeah right in other words don't give up your Doctrine don't give up what you believe don't give up the Holy Ghost don't give up the presence of God don't give up these things things belong to you and it's the antidote for sin right that's good so it had to die now at Pentecost you know if you know the types in the Old Testament I don't have time to run into it through it today but you know there was a a feast in the Old Testament when they would take the the the Grain and there would be a wave sheath the first fruits of the Harvest Right they would wave that over the people showing the first fruits of the Harvest Christ was the wave sheath right right and then uh 50 days later at Pentecost the wave sheath had been baked into loaves amen they took the loaves that were baked and waved the loaves at Pentecost showing that the Harvest had been completed and was successful what Christ waved on the cross as the wave sheath what he waved with his life over the Earth was waved back at Pentecost showing that the death of Christ the death burial and Resurrection was a success right do do we believe that today amen so it had to but but now what had to happen to the church because it was not time for a Rapture so it it had to die it had to be reborn and it had to become bread again yeah right there had to be another wave sheath and I believe that's the Christ in the message of the hour this hour right Christ through his messenger in this hour he waved himself again over the people and there had to be another loaf of bread oh my that could be like those in the upper room and that's you and I so it had to become bread again for the second coming of Christ now in Deuteronomy 16:3 it explains that it said Thou shalt eat no leaven bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread yeah even the bread of Affliction for thou comest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste thou may remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life there shall be no leaven bread seen with thee in all thy Coast Seven Days Seven Days someone say seven I'll make sure you're getting it this morning some of you look a little sleepy seven days they ate unleavened bread now brother BR said bread is a type Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word bread is a type of the word he said not just a word here and there as denominations would have you believe it but the word of God is perfect it's God himself in letter form called a feet and the oh I love this the right kind of unadulterated you know what that that means some of you kids may not know what unadulterated what that means it's not mixed with anything right the seed oh my the seed in it's pure form so you got to have an unadulterated word but also an unadulterated Faith yeah a word that's not mixed with anything and a faith that's not mixed to anything I'm telling you here this morning how can you have a a faith that's not mixed with anything if you don't have a word that's not mixed with anything you got to have the word first the pure word that's why God had to send it in our day so we could have a pure faith fath right so now it's the bread is typed he said it's God himself in letter form the right kind of an unadulterated faith in that word will bring that seed to its life he said that's exactly what you see now watch he said at night in the discernments and all these other things because it's a promise that God made right you realize that's why no one else could have that job right well no one else can do what brother brandham did when he stood up there and he he deser the hearts of the people wasn't brother brandham he even would tell the people what did he say right it wasn't William Brandon and let me just I I I know you get out on the internet today it's strange how persecuted the message well it's not strange he said count it not strange when these persecutions come but the message is under persecution today on the internet and you'll find that and I know I can tell you just not to read it but it's everywhere and it's strange they don't persecute the Baptist like that or the Pentecostals or something else because they'll drag up everything they can find about the message and in the sense of and what's amazing to me is what they can't find because we had a prophet that lived the life right and and mean these other men didn't but they'll try to compare him with Paul Kaine or or some of those charismatic guys that uh if you listen to them that somebody had a headache somebody had a backache and that's the way they would do but brother R's Ministry was not that right it was not that at all but it was proved over and over again to be accurate that he could actually tell a person where they come from and they say today well that he was reading the prayer cards it's nonsense because several of us knew people who didn't have prayer cards and it's on tape right that they were called out sister may Brown up here in ALA Missouri I was her pastor before she passed away and sister Brown had in future home you can go find it he said Mrs Brown he said if you believe he said your that sinus problem will leave you he said you he talked about her he said little sitting on the edge of her seat and that's actually the way sister Brown was she did that to the end of her life she sat on the edge of her seat in church and brother Brown called her out she never met him she never got as close to him as between uh the front and the back of the church she never had a driver's license she was a poor woman that that lived in altta Missouri and then in West Plains Missouri but she believed and God spoke to her what was God doing it was more than just another sign it was more than just another gift it was the sign of the Resurrection it was the sign of the son of man it was God showing us that the life was back in the church again that he was present in the church again oh I wonder if we can grab a hold of it this morning and that's why they try to attack it like they do that's why they try to say well it was just this that or the other they can't explain it because it was God yeah and we have more proof that this message is correct than they have that Jesus even existed now I believe he did don't you we have more proof of this message than they do even Bible days because Bible days were here again and people who were there even the Pentecostals of that day would tell you that it was never a man more like Jesus Christ than William brandom that didn't make him Jesus Christ made him a man but he was Washed by the blood and what it meant was God was going to use a vessel again to pour out and show us it was the end time we had to know it before the end time we had to have the faith to take a Rapture and in order to do that there the seed had to to come to a life brother brand said it's God himself in a letter form and the right kind of an unadulterated faith in that word will bring the seed to its life he said that's exactly what you see at night in the discernments and all these other things because it's a promise that God made and he stood by me and told me that and told me these fakers would rise up but hold steady all right he said I believe it and no selfish motive to hurt anybody but to be reverent to God to do the work that he called me to do he said that's why I say these things and God confirms it back and receives the offer and the Sacrifice by vindicating it to be the truth he said no question to it he said now watch that word he said now we notice here seven days that's for every Church age he said as that Masterpiece had to die in order to be resurrected to redeem us all then he had a church set in order at Pentecost but that church had to go through a sacrifice and the Roman World killed it and put it in the ground he talked about that Dark Ages critic that didn't understand why that they had to go through what they went through and I know that's a question in your mind today I know people want why do we have to suffer if we if we believe Christ is here why do we have to suffer why do we have to go through what we go through it's because God knows what's best for us he's building something in us he's building a character and you got to believe that or you'll never make it through life right he's doing something you don't understand right but you understood to be baptized and you understood to receive the Holy Ghost so the rest you'll understand one day we'll understand it better as the song says by and by y amen when the morning comes look now the B said if that man had been spiritual the man who was a Critic he would have knew that the corn of wheat has to die it had to be buried in a Roman Cathedral but then the first little Sprout of Life came forth in the Reformation by Martin Luther the just shall not live by a blessed kosher that a priest does but by the word of God the just shall live by faith oh I I believe we live by the word today don't you he put up two sprs he said the corn of wheat begin to grow now he said then Along Came John Wesley and added to that he said there was many others wingly and them and come and denied the Virgin birth and it just died down but Along Came the Methodist and the tsel the pollen the missionary day they preached sanctification added the tosel he's talking about the wheat plant now or the the corn as well he said then Along Came the Pentecostals and the shut so much he said to deceive the elected said it looks like a real grain of wheat opened up there's no wheat at all but the life's passing through the shook right so it didn't come to its fullness in Luther yet they were saved just like you're saved true right because they believed God's word right and and they and they actually was the Holy Ghost that did it sir right and and they could raise up and rejoice and say praise God for the Holy Ghost yeah but all they had was a little sprig two sprigs brother said come up from the ground as you seen morning or wheat begin to come up so they begin to H they begin to sprout up and that's all they had but yet then Wesley come along and he had a lot more substance and a Sanctified life but but yet that wasn't all of it the life was just passing through right he said have you noticed every 3 years after a great meeting he said what takes place a denomination he said this is 20 years and no denomination so the way we could put that is after about 3 years of Revival it's that part starts to die right that part of the plant begins to die because what happens is that the plant oh my the plant the life is moving on the life is not gone it's moving on so the life in the in the stalk the life in the in the tossel rather uh that that was the Methodist part the tossel the life that was in the Shu or or the husk of the wheat the life that was in that had to pass through that right until the plant the stalk the the tossel the husk looks completely dead yeah and I I think today we can say it's completely dead right it's just as dead as could be you see well they have music and and sometimes shouting and peing in tongues and things but it's completely dead because there's no word in it to change your life right but if we say they're completely dead because there's no word to change your life then there must be a word that can change your life if they're completely dead there must be something that's complet completely alive oh I believe we living in part of that today if we could just believe it you realize what the challenge is for me all week long all week long you get unbelief thrown at you from every corner you get unbelief from the internet you get unbelief from Neighbors you get unbelief from work you get unbelief from friends even family unbelief just thrown at you constantly and the challenge is on Sundays and on Wednesdays that we would gather you in here and we begin to say you need to believe because the everything hinges on faith right right you can't have nothing without faith your good works is not what heals you your good works is not what saves you it's faith in the atonement of God oh if we could just understand if you could just believe today sir if we could just believe our lives would begin to change if we just believe we'd be baptized and be receive the Holy Ghost but the challenge is to get you to believe yes I think we should say like the disciples Lord increase our faith amen Amen brother B said you'll he said he said this is 20 years and no denomination now many more years than that and no denomination he said dear dying lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stands still for a denomination he said you'll die right in your track remember that the very hour that you mention denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are take Man For Your Leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm this word he said that's the hour you die oh you must be led by the word I must be led by the word you got to hold what I say back to the word but not your idea of what the word says it's got to be actually the word right and so the the the word has to confirm what the preacher's preaching the word has to confirm the life that you're living the word confirms the spirit that's present so now he said he said the genuine seed cannot I love that in other words genuine seed cannot be a denomination someone try someone tries to put a scare on you and say well you know if you have uh good instruments you're denominational I've heard it like if you had carpet on the floor it's denominational that's nonsense right because that's not denominational we're just trying to make it as comfortable as we can for people we want to do things for your kids it's not denominational to have a youth camp or or a banquet or or to have a some type of an event here at the church it's not denominational at all what it is is a group of people want to fellowship with one another church dinners aren't denom the Baptist didn't start potluck right we didn't either they started them in in the day of Pentecost cuz immediately after that they ate at each other's house every day so instead of doing that we just built a place and Y all come here right we're just doing what the word says are you with me now now if you don't want to come to a potluck you don't have to that don't mean you're not saved it's just something that that we want to be around one another we want to be around one another we love one another and and it shows there's a word birth in our life amen now we know that brother B the genuine seed cannot be a denomination so just Hammer the devil with that it cannot be a denomination because there's nothing left after the seed the life is not passing through the seed it's got nowhere else to go it may look like it's dead you may look at it see there's no moisture there but the life is there because that's the the only place it can be and it's making it back into its original again back into its original form now brother BR he taught us that he said it's the bride that fell into the ground it's the same thing went back back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of wheat again we know that and can I say it like this the lutherans were born of the word for their day right they were born into an age where the present truth was justification and they live by that life and under that atmosphere the methodists were born under a word of sanctification and that age was a long age it continued even I even as a child I've seen some of them oldtime Methodist Wesley Methodist people that really had something right they were born of the word in their day they didn't know any different they they really had something it made them live right made them have live Sanctified lives and so they they were there and they had something but watch as the church gets farther and farther becomes more worldly and they can't even live under sanctification anymore because that's not the hour we're living in right right they were born of the word for their day the life traveled through that portion of the wheat plant but all the life that was in justification came through to sanctification all of the life that was in sanctification comes through to the the the Shu the the outpouring of the spirit and the gifts right all the life yeah come through oh my it traveled through that portion of the wheat plant but it could not produce a birth of the full word as has to happen for the Rapture no more than David could be Jesus they could not be a word bride oh I hope you're hearing me today the Bible says they without us could not be perfect the Old Testament Saints without the New Testament Saints could not be perfected because they they they had faith and it was counted to them for righteousness but there was as of yet the time was not there they did not understand who Jesus was yeah all right right oh my oh my listen in the denominational ages God winked at ignorance they didn't understand they God and God blessed those days he he anointed those people to do what they did but they could not be the word in its fullness I want to challenge you with uh you with this this morning we can be the word in its fullness we can be the walking word we can be and we have to be in this age because that's the age we've been born into we've not been born into an age that just allows us to live any way we want to we've been born into the word I hope we see it today now they could not be Messiah ET and you know what that is a messiah ET that is a term brother brandom coin it means little messiah messiah means anointed one yeah right they could not be a little Messiah oh or as brother Randon put an amateur God we'll get into that in a moment now Romans 8:18 Paul spoke of it he said for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are you still with me this morning I won't hold you all all day I promise he said I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the Son of God now we know there's a manifestation of the sons of God when we get our new bodies set there's coming a glorious time do you believe that there's coming a glorious time when we'll see Christ face to face we'll be in our new bodies but yet we know that here there's a manifestation of the sons of God that happens at the end time brother BR said he made man a god a God in his domain and his domain goes from sea to seea from Shore to Shore he has the control of it listen to me when you leave here you might go home and pass over the Border go into Missouri you might pass over a border and go into Texas or going to Tennessee but you can never pass over the border of God's domain right his domain all things are under his feet his domain no matter what you do you'll never leave his domain oh aren't you glad for that today that ought to give us comfort and strength you said but I've been I've lived a bad life I've done some things that are wrong you've never passed out of God's domain his domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has the control of it and when Jesus came being the one God without sin he proved it when the winds blowed he said peace be still and when the tree he said no man eat from thee verily I say unto you he said now watch this you're going to have to put on your uh on your uh thinking cap for a minute he said verily I said you know he's quoting scripture Jes Jesus watch you this little Gods now look that takes away all excuses doesn't it I'm too weak verily I say unto you little God I don't mean that as an object of worship and he didn't either but it was a little Creator right right now you say well that's not true of me it absolutely is true huh know there's an old joke I don't mean to joke in the Pulpit but it it kind of fits here they said if you want to know who the real Christian is put your dog and your wife in your trunk and when they when you in a couple hours come back and when you open the trunk see who's happy to see you don't do that but you see you you see you can change the atmosphere putting your wife in the trunk would change the at atmosphere in your home that's sometimes just withholding the credit card can change the atmosphere choices you make today five years from now kids might determine what you are you could be a preacher right you could be serving God with all your heart or you could be out on the street somewhere because something that happened in the service this morning right things matter you're a he made you in the image of God you're a little God if we can say it that way and as a born again Christian you have the spirit of Christ dwelling in you what that means is that you are I don't know if this is the right word undefeatable right cuz he never lost a battle how could you lose a battle come on yes you might end up like a little boy in in a street fight but he's got a big daddy yeah and he might be getting whooped right now but he says daddy's coming yeah and I'm just a chip off the old block but daddy's coming I'm just got a portion but daddy's coming and he's going to make things right oh I believe no matter what you're going through right now that the presence of Christ is here today and he's going to make things right right that's good when he said he proved who he was he said peace be still and he said no man eat from thee he said verily I seen to you the you this little gods if you'll say to this mountain be moved don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have what you've said he said go right back to Genesis to the original what is it he said now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed now think about it for a minute and that's why the emphasis in this day and and I want to be careful with this because we believe that all of the life comes through so we still believe in healing by laying on of hands we still believe in prayer lines altar calls right we still believe in shouting speaking in tongues all the gifts of the Spirit we believe in that yes but yet the emphasis in this day was to have all that life plus brother brand tells us that he said it's all that plus so in this day there's going to come some Sons and Daughters of God yeah that when they speak their word is backed well what if I asked for the wrong thing he said the bride would have thus say the Lord would keep still yeah right and so you understand what he's doing right now is he's he's making us but Logan he's making us into what he wants us to be but the things we go through in life he's molding us because you can't brother R said power without character is satanic right oh he said character is not a gift it's a victory yeah right right and you're going to have power one day yes you may feel powerless right now but there's coming a day you're going to have power but what you don't understand is you can have power here but first the flesh has to be under subjection right so there's got to come to a place where true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed I'm not crazy this morning that's what a prophet taught he said I believe we're on the border of it right now right I think it's amazing this is right before the opening of the word so we're on the border of it right now say to this mountain let it be so yeah he said now then you're a you're a Son of God in the house of God you're a part of God's economy right you're a part of God's economy what that means is the benefits of the of the Messiah economy is yours right you have the benefits of a messiah economy you know when you if you have a I don't have my wallet with me but if you have a dollar bill the reason you carry it with such confidence is you have the benefits of an American economy right if I go overseas I when if I can use American money if they'll take it that what it means is and most anybody will they're glad to get it because it has a purchasing power beyond what their dollar does because I'm a beneficiary of the American economy my passport means more at a border and this is still true even after all these years and all the nonsense that's gone on in our government our passports still mean more at a border than anybody else's does if you go through with an American passport you get treated differently going into an African country or or an Asian country and so when you go in you you you have an American passport you're a part of the American economy oh God if we could only realize this morning you're a part of the Christian economy you're a part of the economy of God it means you have a currency faith that you can use when your children are sick you can speak to that mountain it'll be moved when you're when there's problems in the home you can speak to your home and things will begin to come right you're an atmosphere Creator yes you can do what the word says and change your life the life in your home the atmosphere in your home right sir why because that's who you are you're in under the economy of God now he said Romans 81 I love this in God's economy there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus you need to repeat that scripture and throw it in the devil's face every time he tries to condemn you for what's under the blood because you cannot be condemned there is no condemnation Hallelujah there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus they tell me I don't know if it's true but I've been told in a lot of the Indian languages there was no word for lie they they did not understand that the that the government was lying to them when they put them on reservations because they didn't even have a word to express Express lie and I'm here to tell you this morning that there is no word to express condemnation in the economy of God there is no word that can bring back your past in the economy of God but it's been washed by the blood of the Lamb you are The sinless Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ yes sir wonderful I don't mean you won't have scars right it don't mean the Pastor won't have to deal with you sometimes talk harshly to you at times and other ministers might preach right down your alley but you're a child of God yeah the devil will try to bring condemnation that's his job he's the accuser of the Brethren right yes but he's a failure come on Hallelujah he's a failure at it because he cannot stand in the presence of an open book yes that's got your name on it sir that's good amen now look I'm running out of time now look he said when the waters Hallelujah he said let me go back he said there's no condemnation than which you're in Christ Jesus for dead to the world alive in him living in this present day making the word that God has used them for ordained them placing their name in this bride book and when the waters comes upon that seed that's in the heart raises it up to the bride of Christ in Luther's day it could only come up so far in Wesley's day it could only come up so far but in this age it comes all the way up he said just as perfect as it can be in every age it's been that way the Lutheran under justification the feet raised it like that West under sanctification and Pentecostal under the arms the works and deeds and so forth had to be calvinist had to be Armenian had to be legalist but now we come to the Head the cstone Grace Grace the cstone gra oh you can live it when others couldn't but you can yes sir why you're living you're born into the bright age yeah are you with me now right you said well it's lean age it is but to us we've been called out of Lea yeah and we and we call that the bright age or the bright Bri time yeah and the bride time is what you were born into you were not born into denominational ages oh it ought to give us great comfort and strength today it ought to give us great courage in our hearts that I can do what the word says I can do I can go to the house of God I can live for God I can trust God when I have a need yeah good I don't know if we prayed for brother Jared and sister Emily this morning my know their kids had flu and strep this week both but I I'm here to say this morning Our God's A Healer Our God's A Healer and I want you to know that you have the power this is the age of Grace not based on what you've done but youve passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God he said God's only provided plan for his age his son's in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive sir and subject to every promise in his word he said then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you no leaven among you just a word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he put his name Christ Jesus no leaven among you he said that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you if Jesus fulfilled all of the word by being the entire fullness of the godhead bodily what will you fulfill all of the word wish we could see it today brother brand said it couldn't do it in Luther's age this is all one quote I'm I'm reading God's only provided a place of worship he couldn't do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley's age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age but in the day when the son of man will be manifested revealed brought back the church together with the entire deity of God amongst his people showing the same visible signs manifesting himself like he did at the beginning that was in Christ when he was manifested on Earth and in the form of a prophet God he said Oh Glory promised by Malachi 4 promised by the rest of the scriptures he said where do you worship at the house of God seated in present tense now look can I have just a few more minutes I I got myself a few more minutes on my clock but that's not always correct I told brother Tim PR last night I said you know I said Jesus said I have much more to tell you but you cannot bear it now and uh brother Tim man that man can just lay it in preach and preach and preach and preach and and to be honest sometimes I'd love to do that but I know that you can only bear so much of my preaching now if I got to listen to a man like brother Tim all the time I could bear more but I know you can only bear so much of my preaching so I'll hurry but look he said when look look at the woman at the well let's look at her as an example now when the woman at the well saw the sign of the son of man she knew the Messiah was there there in his fullness right she understood now why did she understand not so much cuz she'd been taught although there had to be some exposure to the word or she wouldn't have known the things that she knew right so it's important what we teach our children what our Sunday school teachers teach our children is important because it gives them an expectation of the word right and so that what's that is that's very important when we teach our children but she maybe she had been taught as a child but she didn't live that way right she didn't live like she'd been taught like some of you like like me we didn't always live what we'd been taught but one day Hallelujah we come in the presence of Jesus Christ and when we come in his presence what happened things begin to change all right I I just want to tell you what this message means to me today as I I looked at it and I be to see it for myself as a child and I was uh 12 13 14 years old and I've been brought up on deep calls to the Deep I've been brought up on the the seals I've been brought up on all of those things but as I got older it be to mean something to me brother Bill I be to see there was a prophet in our day he wasn't like all the other Pentecostal preachers he didn't need to uh to to scream and yell and those things and although that that would be fine and wonderful I do it sometimes but he just gentle and he stood there and he discerned the secrets of the heart and I begin to realize there was something to it yeah and it showed me there oh God if if God was alive and William brandham he must still be alive today and I was presented with doctrines I said well brother brandham has to come back or or something else or there's going to be another prophet and I had to reject that because God's word doesn't teach that but it does teach us that there's a sign of the son of man that's still here yes sir and when the woman at the well saw that oh my sir brother BR said he didn't have to do it all those times he only had to do it once and we saw it hundreds hundreds of times there's hundreds of times that he did it without a prayer card yeah without ever meeting the person right without ever knowing what was going hundreds of times some of you are witnesses of those times talk to some of your elders sometimes they know a few things I've seen a few things they've been around some of you witnessed those things and you know you know what happened back there but I'm here to tell you that same Messiah is still here he was proving he was here brother said that was my message to show he's here look he told her her life she knew the Messiah was there in fullness so he he told her her life and then revealed to her where God's place of worship was and the woman said to him in John 4:25 I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us all things and Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he you say well well if that was him wouldn't everybody believe it why is there so much nonsense on the internet can you imagine what the internet would say about Jesus all right what they do say right but think about what they said would have said in that time an illegitimate child that was the story born of a Roman soldier that's what they told themselves to try to give themselves Comfort because they didn't want to believe that he was the Christ CU they'd have to live right they'd have to follow him amen so didn't want to believe in who he was so they had to make up stories about him they they pulled him into six trials listen he went through six trials in one night and not one of them had anything bad to say about him so they made stuff up that's right oh God they made it up and they said well he's not traditional he's not like he's teaching his doctrine's different it's the same thing they've done today are you with me now wouldn't everybody have known wouldn't everybody know today no it's only he said blessed are your eyes that they can see your ears that they taking it here and Jesus spoke plainly to her he said I that speak unto thee am he and the disciples came and said wonder why in this service no one stopped them from talking to each other oh my and the woman I believe God ordained that time for her to receive what she needed I believe God's ordained this time this morning for you to receive what you need yes the woman realized there's something more to this man and the woman what' she do the woman left her water pot I love how first she perceived that he was a prophet and then she found out that he was the Messiah now watch we perceived a prophet in our day yeah but we didn't find that he was the Messiah because again it's a body move but we found out that the Messiah was here oh hope you're hear me this morning yeah the woman left her water pot amen and she went her way into the City and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that I ever did is not this the Christ she was so changed that she went back to the men the very men that knew her life the very but it wasn't about her anymore her testimony wasn't about what she had done her testimony was of a risen resurrected Jesus Christ Hallelujah now she said come see a man that told me is not this the Christ this is the fullness they never said that about Moses or David the Bible says as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and Prince from Heaven destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed but the said look what happened to lot and then down in Sodom of Billy Graham and or Roberts look at the elected Abraham Church pulled out look what kind of sign that Jesus himself the Incarnate God standing there in human flesh you say that was an angel the Bible said it was God Lord God Elohim standing there in human flesh showing he would do he would listen he wasn't just showing he would anoint a prophet but he was showing he would anoint his church in the last days it'd be God working in human flesh again as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man it's why it was one to an age it's Unique it was a sign of the Messiah what does it mean to us brother brand said I'm skipping down through some things he said one Angel stayed back a messenger with the elected group and what kind of a sign did he do he what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested where in his bride in the last days all right glory to God I believe it this morning I ask you when we come out does it still work would you still testify does it still work yes it works today why does do baptism work today why does the Holy Ghost work today because you've been born into the word age you've been born by the word into the bride age oh it will be manifested in his bride in the last days I I'll do this and I'll close there's four stages of growth that's taking place in some of your lives sister Fritz I think you're are you 90 now 90 years old brother Bill you're almost that old not quite a few years shy now look in your time you probably saw people with horses and Buggies not Amish people but right just regular people in their lifetime right and think about it and then it come on up through and they had cars right automobiles but they weren't much a few of them were but most of them weren't much sorry brother Harold Harold loves his old cars but there's a reason you don't drive that that model tea when it's real cold right because it's there's something about it wasn't Advanced now think for thousands of years everybody went by horse and buggy and all of a sudden they got cars and it changed the world all of the sudden it was just a few years and the R Brothers invented the airplane and and the airplane begin to fly and now people were flying and I'll be honest there was a lot of people who didn't believe man would ever fly there's a story about my great-grandmother I believe it is that when they uh when they first got electric light she didn't believe in electric light she didn't know what you were talking about just like someone in another age wouldn't know what you're talking about the message of the hour right you can't expect them to right right because they don't they don't understand but here there was electric light and I I remember uh she made them keep them off she never they finally installed them in her house I think it was her and she made them turn them off they never never could believe that the electric light wouldn't burn down the house my grandpa got into a car my great grandpa got into a car for the first time and they said he got into his model te and he drove it right straight down the hill going whoa whoa pulling on the steering wheel it's a different age yeah it's hard to teach Old Dogs new tricks why some of you still don't have cell phones it's hard for me my son knows way more about technology than I do that's to challenge Parents try to keep them out with some stuff they need to stay out of right because they know more about technology than we do why because it's a different age right the iPhone come just what 15 years ago changed the world right believe it or not they didn't have Facebook until what 2015 2010 something like 2010 20 2009 I think I was an early adopter but we lived without it can you imagine what life was like without Facebook without without an automobile without an airplane now look it moved all the way up until they put men in a tube and sent them into outer space now that takes some Faith especially if you're the guy in the tube right because I don't think the monkey lived but they sent a guy up there and and and he's up there flying above the Earth and there's still people don't believe that ever happened happened right because it's just it's not fathomable how could you do that with a SL rule if you don't believe that that's fine you can have your opinion that's you know why I believe in the astronaut age or was astronauts because we're living in a spiritual astronaut age Hallelujah brother Bram talks about it he talked about coming from the horse and buggy to the automobile he said that was like coming from the Lutheran age to the Wesleyan age he said when a man is filled with the Holy Ghost there's something in him that's full of God's spiritual vitamin makes him and praise God shout and act different he said because why he's no longer Earthbound he's in the heavens sailing around in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said he left them Earthbound with their bicycles and Automobiles they've went to the air he said yes they're practically taken them out of there out of date he said they healed the sick they spoken unknown languages and done many things now even your bicycles are electric he said but now friends may I say this he said it has come to the age of astronaut we have moved out of the airplane age we got more power now you look back and say well I wish we had the power of of 1906 I wish we had the power of the West age I wish we had the power of all night prayer meetings you got more power now yes yes Hallelujah sir Hallelujah we got more power now the astronaut and age has come in what is it we've come into a spiritual age of astronaut going above it's the same Spirit he said only more power only lifted higher can go higher see more believe more be more like Christ do you believe that today not the automobile not the horse and buggy not even the airplane but the astronaut he sweeps on and above each one it's called The Eagle agent in the Bible God calls His prophets Eagle age he said we realize Malachi 4 were promised in the last days he likes his Prophets The Eagles he calls himself Eagle he is the great Jehovah Eagle listen he is able if you were there Friday nights you heard brother uh brother uh Wayne preach he is able yes he is able I believe he's able today he is able to achieve to him himself a bride he is going to in the last day oh that gives me great comfort Ste no matter what our efforts are they might be good it might fail but we know he's able we might fail as preachers but he's able to achieve to himself a bride he's going in the last days to be able to get a bride with the ministry so exactly he said like a man and his wife becomes one when Jehovah gets his people like him he lives in his people they are one he said it fulfills the scripture John 1412 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he also fulfills what Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said now is the astronut age and astronut sees things that all these other ages didn't see he said he's he said the airplane still down here bouncing around in the clouds having blowouts hit downs and everything else but he goes beyond the clouds of Creeds and denominations moves on up into the heavens Plum away from everything Hallelujah he said the only thing he has to do I'm skipping brother Robert I'm sorry only thing you has to do is get somebody in his hands that can cut loose from airplanes and Automobiles yeah what more not look back to what it was but more power to lift him higher lift him into the presence of God lift him up where someone say all things all things all things are possible he said now we see it's happening oh Church means the mechanics and the Dynamics are here well I don't feel it but it's available it's right here why he was the fullness his presence in the church is the fullness he is the word he is the fullness he is the mechanics and the Dynamics sir Hallelujah he's in the boat amen do you believe it today amen he said he said that we see it happening there's no doubt to it he said so does the spiritual astronaut as the natural astronaut goes on above the planes planes always wrecking up and fussing in the clouds right that's the problem why churches fuss with one another cuz they're still in a airplane age we got to come higher than that church into brotherly love yes yes right which is the last thing to be restored to the church before the coming of the calf Stone right brotherly love go look at the the pyramid goes from the bottom to the top it was Brotherly Love was taken off first it goes back on last onto the bride tree now look he said you're fussing in the clouds there could be nothing greater no more achievement than the astronaut only thing he has to do is just musicians go ahead and come only thing he has to do is just keep keep putting more power he'll go anywhere he wants to he said he's done gone into space airplanes are still down wrecking fussing grounded but the astronaut don't have to be grounded he goes on above the clouds he goes on above the Creed above the denomination above those that Say It Isn't So it isn't so he's got to guide the Holy Spirit the word tells him so and he moves on oh God we are born into a GPS age not a map age are you hearing me today brother Tim was talking about that last night about taking a map and and the brother brother was with him got lost because he didn't think he needed a map when you have a map you got to know where you where you're at we're born into an age of presence if I can say it that way when Christ is here we're born into an age when the word has come the holy spirit is here to guide you we are born by the word into an astronaut age where all things and you could take it this way say my things the things that I need they're possible healing is possible Deliverance is possible he said but it didn't happen don't you look at the symptoms don't look even at your own desires look at the word all things are possible to them that believe all things are possible to the astronaut age you were not born into Luther's age you were not born into Wesley's age but you are born into the the body word of the son of man you are born into
