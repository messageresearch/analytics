TRANSCRIPT
========================================
welcome to our study on first Corinthians were actually in chapter 1 and this is our third part so thank you for tuning in tonight and and thank you for being with us I know it's hard not being together at this time but it won't be very long and we'll be able to meet together once again so thank you to the church for all that you do and and for being faithful if you get to watch this live or if you get to watch this later I thank you for being faithful let's have a word of Prayer I know that there's several needs that have been represented and we've know about those and we want to continue to pray for the ministry brother Ron Spencer brother Joel Forney different ones that are dealing with physical problems and their bodies and let's be praying for them and for each one in our church that has physical needs and spiritual needs I I'm just praying that God will meet those needs tonight let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for allowing us to come here together one more time again father and even though together and in this case is online I thank you for allowing us to do this we wouldn't have been able to do it before and so we're grateful for what we have and and looking forward to the time when we can be physically present with one another again thank you for this church I pray you bless them Lord heal them Father and touch their bodies where they have needs tonight maybe if they're listening just to the Word of God tonight and and reading along and marking their Bibles God just as that happens may your word just sink down into their hearts and and somehow bring healing and and faith in their heart we pray I pray father that you would help me tonight to say the things that I need to say clearly and nothing else as we go through this teaching I pray father that you would bless brother Ron Spencer brother Joel Forney and these ministers Lord that have labored and for the bride I pray that you would just bring healing to their bodies completely if we know many have prayed and father I pray that you just continue to heal them and bless them thank you for all that you do we ask you to bless this time we have together in Jesus name Amen all right we're reading from 1st Corinthians chapter 1 I wanted to go over a little bit what we talked about last time I'll try to go slowly enough and and not get too excited so that we can treat this as a Bible study last time we reviewed verses 10 through 16 of chapter one we found that Paul begged the church to speak the same thing to speak with one voice and to have one one spoken word about what they believed and that's important for us as well when we may have different opinions he never asked for that they would all be or all have the same private opinions but that they would all be the same mind and speak the same thing and that's what's important when it comes to the big things we need to speak the same thing he asked there would be no systems schisms rather in the body and the schism as we found was a medical term that means that there's not a part of the body that's not working so we want to make sure that all of the body is working well because if there's a part that's messed up if there's a part that doesn't work well with the rest of the body then that part will actually be a schism and it'll it'll totally separate itself from the body so that's what he was talking about here with all of these different ideas and doctrines that they had we found that the parties of Paul apalla speeder and Christ were equally wrong and that's an amazing statement in itself to think that someone could call themselves by the name of Christ it could call themselves by the name of Paul or Apollo's and Peter all of them being truth are preaching the truth but yet the people that followed the parties that formed around their names were equally wrong because they used it for division instead of to bring unity to the to the believers and we also found out that messengers are not infallible but God is now on the the parties of Paula Paula speeder in Christ I want you to kind of follow that because you'll find out as we go through the book of first Corinthians that Paul deals with each of these problems the party of Paul though would elevate his ministry above everything else he talks about how that we shouldn't baptize he was glad he didn't baptize more we deal he deals with the party of a Polish those who elevated wisdom and the ability to speak above everything else the ability to be an orator and Paul hammers that as that's not what we look at but we look at the word that's broad the preaching of the Cross we'll deal with that tonight and then the party of Peter who was Judaizers who took that opportunity to try to bring the law back in and and the party that said they were of Christ who may be separated themselves from the body and said well we just won't deal with any of it and but they were equally wrong but he deals with all of those as we go down through the book of 1st Corinthians 1st Corinthians 1:17 I'll start there for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel what a striking statement he says not with wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect so he tells us very clearly we are not saved by baptism alone that's that next slide Esther we are not saved by baptism alone 1st Peter 3:21 tells us that the like figure we're in - even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward God so we if we are obedient we have a right to the promises of God and being saved and receiving the Holy Ghost you know baptism is obedience that's the answer of a good conscience but it's not the baptism itself that saves us or regenerates us he says it's the answer of a good conscience toward God and on the wings of a snow-white does but the Branum deals with that and you'll find many other places and the message where he deals with this as well this is a 1965 he said like I could go up here take each one of you and baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that won't remit your sins no no no I don't believe in water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ unto regeneration and that's where he was very different from the UPC church who taught water baptism under regeneration he said I believe the blood is regeneration see not the water but see I could baptize and baptize but you only go down to dry sinner and come up a wet one see until you have thoroughly repented repent and then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so Paul says Christ sent me not to baptize and he says but he did send me for this he sent me to preach the gospel to preach the gospel what does it mean to preach the gospel mark chapter 16 and verse 15 Jesus speaks to the disciples and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature preached the gospel that word preaches to bring good news this is on the next slide to bring good news to announce glad tidings it's used in the Old Testament of any kind of good news is the joyful tidings of God's kindness particular the Messianic blessings so they would have already understood that what this word meant even before Christ come there was a Greek word but it was spoke of the Messiah it was glad tidings to proclaim glad tidings a preacher would be a herald it would be somebody who speaks and which makes sense but it's somebody who carries a message and also to instruct men concerning the things that pertain to Christian salvation and brother branham differentiates that from just lecturing or teaching which was what we're doing tonight there's a place for teaching there's a place for going through the things of God slowly and and sanely and making sure that we have everything the way that it should be but yeah that's not preaching the gospel not in the way that brother Branham saw it he said are you lecturing but jesus never said go into all the world and teach this or teach that and you'll find again but the rhythm says it's over and over again so it's not an isolated quote he said go into all the world and preach the gospel preach is to demonstrate the power of the holy spirit' these signs shall follow them now there are teachers again on the fivefold ministry and there are part of a pastors job is to teach part of a apostles job is to teach obviously a teacher's job is to teach but it's not just lecturing even even when a pastor teaches or or an apostle would teach a prophet would teach it's not just lecturing but it's inspired Jesus never said go into all the world and teach this or teach that he said go into all the world and preach the gospel he says this and again over and over he said preach is to demonstrate the power of the Holy Spirit these signs shall follow them don't come by lecture that's right he said see that believe it doesn't come by lectures it comes by the presence of the Living God notice this moving among in human flesh proving himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever did you catch that the presence of the Living God moving among in human flesh proving himself that he's the same yesterday today and forever that's why we have to have live preaching today he said he never fails to be the same it comes so simple the simplicity of it is what drives the intellectual mind away from it so preaching and on the next slide preaching is number one declaring the good news contained in the scriptures number two demonstrating the power of that good news well I'm so grateful that God still does that today first Peter 4:11 tells us and we've read this several times lately but just to bring it back to our memory and dealing with preaching the word said if any man speak let him speak as the Oracles of God as if God came into his body spoke through him because that's what the Word of God is if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which God giveth that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ to whom he praise and Dominion for ever and ever amen so he says I came to preach but not just to preach anyway and here he's dealing with the party of a Paulist that elevated or taury and the ability to speak or the ability to teach above everything else and he said not with wisdom of words not with wisdom of words Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach and this is how I preach not with the wisdom of words and Matthew Henry I believe this says says it this way he says the flourish of oratory or the accuracies a philosophical language upon which the Greek so much prided themselves and which seemed to have been the peculiar recommendations of some of the heads of the faction in this church that most opposed this apostle he said he did not preach the gospel in this manner so he said I did not come with wisdom of words and I did that on purpose not because I couldn't but because I didn't want to take away from the cross of Christ so he said lest the cross of Christ should be of no effect lest a success should be ascribed to the force of art and not of truth and people can do that with a person who's a very good speaker a very good teacher if they attribute the success of the ministry to that that's a problem also they can do it on the other side where someone is very emotional they can attribute the success of the ministry to that that's not what it is it's what's preached what is being preached and Paul says I didn't come with wisdom of words so that you can be elevated in your mind but I preached Christ well he says not this Matthew Henry again not to the plain doctrine of a crucified Jesus but to the powerful oratory of those who spread it and here by the honor of the Cross be diminished or eclipsed and I like the way you put this he said this truth needed no artificial dress it shone out with the greatest Majesty in its own light and prevailed in the world by its divine authority and the demonstration of the Spirit without any human helps the plain preaching of a crucified Jesus was more powerful than all the oratory and philosophy of the heathen world well I still believe that today 1st Corinthians 1:18 Paul continues his thought he says for the preaching the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God so Paul sets up this difference between those who are saved and how that we react to the preaching of the Cross if we are saved it is the power of God to those who perish it is foolishness couldn't be more of a stark contrast than that it's foolishness or the power of God it depends on how you look at the preaching of the Cross brother Branham in the paradox illustrate says he says it was a real paradox when God shows the foolishness of inspired preaching notice that the foolishness of inspired preaching that's not lecturing that's not playing someone else's sermon but inspired preaching he said instead of high-polished theology a man that don't know hardly use hid ain't tote fetch carry all such words and sad and say all kinds of things out of his grammar and ungrazed and everything else like that God chose that instead of taking the great scholarly polished who could really pronounce the words and say it just right but it pleased God to take the foolishness again of inspired preaching some little old plough boy don't know his ABCs take that man and win souls by him when deceivers all polished up just leading the blind leading the blind he said it's the real paradox deceived Church by the world but the Branham talks about how that we can't take the things from the world and just necessarily make the success of that in the church just because they're successful in the world and I'll just read it the way he said it he said men want to be like they compare or to copy after go like the world does say the things that they do make a success the way they were a success he says we can never be a success doing anything the world does we can only be a success as we follow after God's statutes and his way of doing things oh don't you want to do the way God wants to do them that should be all of our desires we should never want to do anything like the world does it but to do it like God does it that should be every one of our desires today excuse me I checked them the streams to make sure it was working so we want to do things like God does he says we can never be by patterning after the world if the cigarette company has met their greatest success by television the beer and the whiskey crowds has made their great success through the contribution of television that's no sign that the church will make it success by television what a night for me to be talking about this because we're exclusively on the internet tonight but you know the internet is not where the success is just because it is for the world but the success is in the inspired preaching of the Cross I hope you're following along but the random says the success of the church lies within the preaching of the gospel of the power of God and the demonstration of the Spirit we cannot say because that television done such-and-such for the cigarette company other companies said we do not have any scripture to try to compare with them people as long as we do make we may draw great numbers of people but that's not what God ordained us to do and the truth is we have to make sure that we're not just doing it because the world does it and and that's what they were doing with with Paul that's what they did with the Pala say said with Apollo's we have as great a speaker as they ask the Greeks have surely we could attract more people with that kind of oratory and Paul said I purposely come to you and did not preach that way because I didn't want to take away from the cross of Christ so brother Brown says we think that because we're all colours flying high great organizations causing great colorful things to take place that it's a success he said we are dying daily on our feet spiritually speaking if we stood 10 million strong this morning and the Holy Spirit wasn't with us we do well to stand 10 strong with the Holy Spirit with us we cannot compare with the world and I trust that we know that tonight first Corinthians 1:19 he says for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent I say a 2914 is the scripture that Paul is quoting when he says it is written I'll just read it from there as well kind of give us a better background of it he said therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvelous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid he's talking about those who would prepare a battle and would set everything up and they would know that they would win they could look at this battle and say these Israelites are not worth much and they don't have a very big army and they would never win this battle he said but I'm gonna set their wisdom to naught I'm going to make the wisdom of their wise men perish and hide the understanding of the prudent men 1st Corinthians 1:20 Paul says where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world I'd say he's done that with the message of the hour wouldn't you has God not that's not God made foolish the wisdom of this world so he speaks of three groups of people or three classes of of people who would have been thought of as smart if we could say it that way in that day in time wise would be the philosophers of that day both the Jews and the Greeks they would also have the scribes or the lawyers those who could go down and quote every little bit of the law or or they could write well or they could they could parcel it out you wouldn't you wouldn't lose them in the law whether that's the the pagan laws or the Jewish law also he spoke speaks of the disputer which would be the mystics the person who can look at it and divine a meaning behind the word so we could look at the look at the scriptures and he could he could think up a conspiracy theory or some reason why that it would be that way and there were more mystics then now it seems like people lean more on science but I think of when I thought of this I thought of a man by the name of jordan peterson who i like to listen to he's a very very good psychologist and he is a great speaker and he's able to deal with young men and help him in their lives and things like that but jordan Peterson has has had some problems in his life and in his own mind mentally and and he's had to deal with in his in his philosophy and these things try to deal with and explain what the Bible means and I feel sorry for him because he understands it's a great book but he doesn't see in atonement he just can't accept that a blood sacrifice was actually made so he tries to see the Bible in this mystical light in this philosopher philosophical light he doesn't understand the atonement I pray that we would never get that way but that we would understand the Bible the way that it was written and meant to be understood and that we would preach the Bible that way and we would preach it with the force of its truth it's actually the truth it's not just a story 1st Corinthians 1:21 for after that he said in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God so he's saying they had plenty of wisdom down to the ages plenty of smart people much more wisdom in the ancients than theirs today he said but the world by wisdom didn't know God but it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief it pleased God this is the way God wanted it done in perfect faith brother Branham says God uses men and men only you can see they used the word man they're one brother and says man many times he's saying he's meaning men the plural pronounces it man God uses man man only God doesn't use a machinery God doesn't use groups of men God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always so he doesn't even deal with multiple me and he deals with a man God uses man and man only God hiding himself in simplicity than revealing himself in the same he says God won't leave his program it ought to be simple enough for us to understand and this is what Paul's saying Paul saying this is the program of Christ it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them who believe and so brother Branham says God won't leave his program that's the reason we know that this day it's got to be simple see why because he's always been simple before he's always done it simple and so he would be simple today said see now he always works in simplicity but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel or the wins preached the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose and he never changes it let that sink down in your heart because people will tell you differently especially as we go through this time when we're not able to be together and people say well it's just as good to be a part and it's not it's not it's not the same and but God still uses men even when we're apart like this God still uses men today he'd knit your name in for that purpose he never changes it he said he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he ordained men to preach the gospel not machinery mechanical devices or any angelic being it was man I'm grateful that he still uses man 1st Corinthians 1:22 so the Jews require a sign the Greeks seek after wisdom the Jews require a sign the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling-block and unto the Greeks foolishness the Jews required a signer brother branham taught us and you go back in the message and look it up but but the random taught us that they did that because they actually had been taught to receive a sign and so he said they received their prophets and they received a sign it was to the Jews though a stumbling block because it wasn't a sign they were looking for they've been taught to receive a sign and still didn't receive the sign of the seiyya he said when they ought to have but to the Greeks he said foolishness the Greeks seek after wisdom the Greeks say AHS nothing to it so the Jews seeking a sign it becomes a stumbling block to the Greeks seeking wisdom it become a foolishness and brother branham speaks of this and again speaking of the difference between the world and the church and there is a difference but the Braun says let's give them something that they haven't got well there's a novel idea isn't it let's give them something they haven't got this is in the greatest newsflash in history in 1961 he said the one thing they don't have is Jesus you think about it today that's the one thing that the world doesn't have they have everything else the world that we live in we have everything we've gone through kind of a hard time lately here in America it seems like that people have just now realized how much we had I know I have we've realized how well-off we are and we've got everything at our fingertips we've got entertainment we've got we've got everything that we could ever ask for and now we had to pull back from some of that and it hurts people to have to pull back why because they have so much but one thing the world doesn't have is Jesus he said don't try to entertain with them you're meeting them on their ground preach Christ let them come on this ground and find out what they got he said if they want to stay in the Garlic land let them stay were we ain't to meet them there he says we're not mimics we're apostles what a powerful statement we're not mimics we're not to come and just because the Greeks do things a certain way that we're going to do things a certain way we're not mimics we're apostles hallelujah he said we're not Apes as they say we are we're sons of God created in His image he said nonsense to that bunch come away from it there's a living Christ he goes on and he says oh they got plenty of psychology philosophical religions and everything oh my they're loaded with that they don't need more philosophy they don't need a message philosophy he said but there's one thing they don't have it's Jesus that's right oh they have entertainment they can make a bigger basketball fuss than you can sure they can they can put men up on the movie screens out there that he said could outs know anything you can do that's right their genius at it their genius at it don't try to compare with them he said didn't Jesus say the children of the world what they are that's right there's one thing they don't have is Jesus that's what we have that's the one thing we have that the world needs so Paul says what I had that you needed was not my education what I had that you needed was not was not my natural force of nature what I had that you needed was Christ so I preached Christ and nothing else first Corinthians 124 so he says he told us that to the Greeks to the Greeks there was there were there was foolishness the gospel was foolishness to the to the Jews they didn't understand it it was a stumbling block but to us I love this but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God verse 25 because the foolishness of God is wiser than men the weakness of God is stronger than men I'm grateful for that everything's still okay back there I've got Peter and Esther with me again tonight so we're thankful I'm thankful to have them and they're just getting old enough where they're able to help me out and they're running the video and we're just learning how to do some things so I'm closing with this a preacher from the 19th century from around the time of the Civil War said this he said it is not to be thought that this function of the Christian Church has ceased speaking of preaching inspired preaching he said even liberally educated and cultivated sections of society let us look closely and ask is the function of the preacher temporary think about this will it ever pass away he said there is one element belonging distinctively to the preacher which will forever give him a place and function which can never change the bringing of the truth home to men in a living form nothing else can do that but the inspired preaching of the word of God preached Christ he said well I'm not a preacher I don't can't do that well wait a minute but the Branham tells us if you're a preacher preacher sermons but if you're not a preacher he said don't try to preach it live your sermon oh my isn't that something we all should try to do to live our sermon every day and then he said if you're a preacher he said you should preach your sermon and live it too it's a powerful thing to be the truth in a living form and that's something that should challenge us especially as ministers we cannot live something different than we preach because if we live something different than we preach we are no longer a living form and we are replaceable by just a recording or something else when we live what we preach and we are what we say then we are irreplaceable because God wants to do things this way this is the way God shows it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that belief Benjamin Franklin said this he said the learned fool writes his nonsense in better language than the unlearned but it's still nonsense you know I pray that we would begin to look at the what the people are saying look at what men are saying not what not how they look or how they say it but what did they say did they preach Christ did they preach the word to us or was it just said in a pleasing fashion the learned fool writes his nonsense in better language than the unlearned but it's still nonsense the serpent had a better seemingly better argument than God in the garden but it was nonsense we don't want to follow something like that we'll pick up next time right about then and and we'll have I think probably wanted one more of these hopefully the Lord willing and the state lets us come back together here in a couple weeks we'll be able to be back in the church and I may continue with this or we may pick up something else and then do this at a different time kind of like we're doing now so but I trusted it's been a blessing to you let's bow our heads together for a word of Prayer once again Heavenly Father what an honor to stand behind the desk today and even though I'm teaching tonight and and it's meant to be low-key and and something that we could study in our homes but father I believe that still preaching the Word of God thank you for that honor may I live up to that God and each one that would hear me ministers laypeople alike father may we live up to what we say we may not preach a sermon I may never preach another sermon but let me live a sermon Oh God grant that it would be so I pray once again for every every need as we go to our homes and lay our head on our pillow tonight may we think about these needs that others have not about ourselves but about others and just ask you to come and meet those needs and believe that you will when we wake up in the morning all of these needs will be met pray you grant it now thank you for your word we ask it in Jesus
