[44:02] in here and I believe the presence of
[44:04] the Lord is here Proverbs chapter 4 and
[44:08] verse 23 I want to speak tonight on how
[44:11] to deal with difficult people how to
[44:15] deal with difficult people I know that's
[44:18] a little bit uh strange of a title but I

[44:28] to Proverbs 4:23 keep thy heart with
[44:32] with all diligence for out of it are the
[44:36] issues of life we find Jesus said the
[44:40] same thing didn't he he said out of the
[44:41] abundance of the heart the mouth
[44:44] speaks put away from the award mouth and
[44:49] perverse lips put far from Thee I pray
[44:53] the Lord would add his Blessing to the
[44:54] word you may be seated
[44:58] the word forward is different from
[45:01] forward it's f r o w a r d it is a word
[45:06] you'll find often in the scripture
[45:08] especially in Proverbs it means willful
[45:11] and disobedient so not just disobedient
[45:14] but willful and disobedient so it' be
[45:17] like if you had a dog actually like both
[45:20] of our dogs actually that if you call on
[45:24] them to come and they sit and and then
[45:27] you go to get them and they run away and
[45:29] you can say it's a forward dog that dog
[45:31] just refuses to obey just refuses to do
[45:34] the right things and and it's not it's
[45:37] not somebody who's just difficult
[45:39] because of their uh the situation
[45:42] they're in I know there's difficult
[45:44] people in life that it's difficult maybe
[45:47] uh they're a difficult person because of
[45:49] circumstances of life I know it would be
[45:52] very difficult to be married to a pastor
[45:54] I'll just pick on myself I know brother
[45:56] brandom would have been a very difficult
[45:58] person to be married to and and probably
[46:00] his wife would have had a a difficult
[46:03] time that doesn't mean he was a bad
[46:04] person but it was just a difficult
[46:06] situation because he was gone all the
[46:08] time I know it's hard sometimes we're
[46:10] put in difficult situations but that's
[46:12] not what I'm talking about tonight I'm
[46:13] talking about people who are difficult
[46:15] on purpose they there just something
[46:17] about them they just want to be that way
[46:20] and and how do you deal with somebody
[46:22] like that so the the word frow word the
[46:25] adverb frow word is an old fashioned way
[46:27] to describe somebody who's difficult and
[46:31] honory difficult and honory and it's
[46:34] someone who's habitually disposed to
[46:37] Disobedience and opposition in other
[46:40] words if there's a way for them to tell
[46:41] you no they will tell you no just just
[46:45] they'll they'll find some way to do it
[46:47] and and the basic meaning in the Hebrew
[46:49] there's several different Hebrew words
[46:51] are translated for award but they all
[46:53] come from the same root and it means
[46:55] twisted or crooked or turned aside and
[46:59] so it's a it's a troublemaker somebody
[47:01] who does it on purpose it's different
[47:03] from the fool there there's a there's a
[47:06] man or type of person in Proverbs called
[47:09] the fool and the fool has said in his
[47:12] heart there is no God and then the fool
[47:14] is dealt with he's just an ignorant
[47:16] person he's somebody who's just base and
[47:18] doesn't know anything doesn't care to
[47:20] know but the forward man is not ignorant
[47:24] he's the way he is because he he Delight
[47:27] to be that way so it's somebody who that
[47:30] their way is just broken they're they're
[47:32] perverted I don't mean in a sexual sense
[47:35] but in their relationships with others
[47:37] they're twisted and that's what that
[47:38] word actually means they exist to be
[47:41] difficult and make trouble they just
[47:43] love to do that now H you know if you're
[47:47] thinking about somebody you may have the
[47:49] wrong
[47:50] person but you might have a difficult
[47:52] person that you're thinking of so
[47:55] Proverbs 6:12 it kind of tells us a
[47:57] little bit more about it he said a
[47:59] naughty person a wicked man walketh with
[48:01] a forward mouth he says he winketh with
[48:05] his eyes he speaketh with his feet he
[48:08] teacheth with his fingers forwardness is
[48:12] in his heart it's in his heart he's a
[48:15] difficult man he deviseth Mischief
[48:18] continually he Seth Discord right so
[48:22] this isn't just somebody who can be
[48:24] difficult at times he continually just
[48:27] thrives on it he wants to be difficult
[48:31] therefore shall his Calamity come
[48:33] suddenly suddenly shall he be broken
[48:36] without remedy now God hates sowing
[48:39] Discord how many know that if you read
[48:41] on in Proverbs chapter six he said
[48:43] there's six things that he hateth seven
[48:45] that are an Abomination to him the
[48:47] seventh one was he that Seth Discord
[48:49] among the Brethren so God hates that
[48:51] it's not just you that hates to be
[48:53] around somebody like that but God
[48:55] actually hates that kind of person and I
[48:58] I I'll say this I don't want to be a
[49:00] person that God hates I don't want to
[49:02] exhibit a characteristic of something
[49:05] that God hates I want to be somebody who
[49:07] God loves who's a friend of God I can
[49:09] only be that by the spirit of God in my
[49:12] life right right so God hates sewing
[49:16] Discord and I know our instinct is I
[49:19] think I've got your attention now our
[49:21] instinct is to walk away from this type
[49:24] of person and there is is a place and a
[49:27] time to do that right there is a time to
[49:30] do that there's sometimes you just you
[49:33] got to go away for your own safety for
[49:36] your own sanity for the good of your
[49:38] family for the good of your Christian
[49:39] walk but it ought to be a last resort we
[49:43] should not separate from family easily
[49:46] we shouldn't separate from people easily
[49:49] you'll find usually somebody who's
[49:51] always separating cutting people off
[49:53] they there's they got problems in their
[49:54] own life and in their own spirit but we
[49:56] want to be somebody who welcomes people
[49:58] and who loves people and always trying
[50:00] to draw a bigger Circle we don't want to
[50:03] cut people out so we we want to draw a
[50:05] bigger Circle and and so here we might
[50:08] our Instinct might be well we'll just
[50:10] cut out that difficult person and you
[50:12] say well I just won't suffer forward
[50:14] people difficult people in my life well
[50:16] pretty soon you won't have anybody in
[50:18] your life because everybody's got a
[50:20] little bit of this in
[50:23] them why because we're we're uh we're
[50:26] human beings and we've got that Fallen
[50:28] nature still there so Jehovah deals with
[50:32] this I thought about this and I thought
[50:34] Brother David I thought well you know I
[50:36] should have like a a I should have a
[50:38] master's degree in difficult people you
[50:40] know and just the way that my life is
[50:42] gone and the people that I've dealt with
[50:44] and then I begin to look at how God has
[50:46] had to deal with me and how he's had to
[50:48] deal with all of us and and how he had
[50:50] to deal with the Israelites especially
[50:52] they were so difficult so disobedient so
[50:56] so hard to get along with and yet he he
[50:58] cared for them he he called them he knew
[51:01] they would be that way and he loved them
[51:03] anyway right and they paid for what they
[51:06] did but God still loved them and I think
[51:08] there ought to be that overarching thing
[51:10] in us that we still love people even if
[51:12] they're difficult we still care about
[51:14] people and reach out for people and try
[51:16] to help them so it's not to not deal
[51:18] with them but how to deal with them so
[51:23] Jehovah calls the Israelites forward in
[51:26] Deuteronomy 32 and 20 he said I'll hide
[51:28] my face from them I will see what their
[51:30] end shall be for they are a very frower
[51:34] generation yeah children in whom is no
[51:37] faith another adjective that he uses a
[51:39] lot is stiff neck and it kind of means
[51:42] the same thing stiff neck and somebody
[51:44] won't Bend won't listen right it just
[51:47] just just won't change for anybody
[51:50] they're setting their ways and Moses uh
[51:53] God told this told Moses he said I seen
[51:56] this people and behold it is a stiff
[51:59] neck people that's right would you
[52:01] wouldn't you hate for him to say that
[52:02] about us oh we want to be pliable we
[52:05] want to be clay in The Potter's hand but
[52:07] Moses agreed with him being their Pastor
[52:10] Moses looked at him and said he said if
[52:12] now I found Grace in th sight oh Lord
[52:14] let my Lord I pray thee go Among Us for
[52:17] it is a stiff neck people and pardon our
[52:19] iniquity and our sin and take us for
[52:21] thine inheritance so Moses is playing
[52:23] the part of a redeemer and he's saying
[52:25] Lord I know we're stiff necked I know
[52:27] we're hard to deal with I know we're
[52:29] difficult sometimes but Lord deal with
[52:31] us
[52:33] anyway oh I'm so glad that that's the
[52:36] kind of attitude that Christ
[52:38] had and Moses was exhibiting the spirit
[52:40] of Christ Hezekiah King hezeki in the
[52:43] Bible told the Israelites he he sent out
[52:45] an an official letter to the people of
[52:48] Israel he said don't be like your
[52:50] fathers yeah right in 2 Chronicles 30:8
[52:53] now be not stiff necked as your fathers
[52:56] were but yield yourselves unto the Lord
[52:59] and enter into his Sanctuary oh church
[53:01] if we could just how many people sit out
[53:03] at church because they're stiff neck
[53:05] because they're just difficult in their
[53:07] nature when they can just come to the
[53:09] house of God and yield themselves and
[53:11] enter into the sanctuary he said Don't
[53:14] Be Stiff necked anymore enter into his
[53:16] Sanctuary which has Sanctified forever
[53:18] and serve the Lord your God that the
[53:20] fierceness of his wrath may turn away
[53:22] from you amen Steven said the same thing
[53:25] about the children of Israel they they
[53:28] hadn't lost it even these hundreds of
[53:29] years later in Acts 7: 51 he said you
[53:33] stiff necked and uncircumcised and heart
[53:35] and ears you do always resist the Holy
[53:37] Ghost as your fathers did so do ye but
[53:41] God kept dealing with them God kept
[53:44] calling to them God I say don't give up
[53:46] on difficult
[53:48] people huh
[53:51] right they deserve to be
[53:54] forgotten but he said I won't forget get
[53:57] you aren't you glad you serve a god like
[53:59] that cuz there were moments in every one
[54:01] of our lives for the bill when we
[54:03] deserve to be
[54:04] forgotten but God said I won't forget
[54:07] them I won't give up on them even though
[54:11] they're difficult even though they act
[54:13] like teenagers their whole lives you
[54:16] know got that laugh out of everybody
[54:19] Peter I'm glad you don't have that thing
[54:24] tonight they deserve to be forgotten but
[54:26] he would not forget them oh church I'm
[54:30] so glad for that listen what he says
[54:32] Zion said the Lord ha forsaken me and my
[54:35] Lord ha forgotten me he said can a woman
[54:38] forget her sucking child that she should
[54:39] not have compassion on the son of her
[54:41] womb yeah they may forget yet will I not
[54:44] forget thee said behold I have Graven
[54:47] thee upon the palms of my hands th walls
[54:50] are continually before me he said I see
[54:52] Jerusalem in my dreams I I won't for
[54:55] can't forget Jerusalem oh
[54:58] Church difficult people can still be
[55:01] saved he said how do you know brother B
[55:02] because I was saved I know that
[55:05] difficult people can be
[55:06] changed but they do need to be changed
[55:10] so the first thing in how we handle
[55:12] difficult people is make sure we're not
[55:14] difficult
[55:16] people all right right that's the first
[55:19] thing to do is always look at ourselves
[55:21] in any situation we're dealing with
[55:24] people and I know we just come through
[55:25] Thanksgiving
[55:27] giving so you've been around difficult
[55:30] people
[55:31] probably huh but the first step is not
[55:34] to be a difficult person Matthew 7:1
[55:38] judge not that you be not judged for
[55:41] with what judgment you judge you shall
[55:42] be judged with what measure you meet it
[55:45] shall be measured to you again and why
[55:47] beholdest thou the moat that is in thy
[55:49] brother's eye but consider not the beam
[55:51] that is in thine own eye the imagery
[55:53] there is why why are you looking at a
[55:54] splinter and your brother when you got a
[55:56] log in
[55:58] yours right or how will thou say to thy
[56:00] brother let me pull out the moat or or
[56:03] the log out of thine own eye or the
[56:04] splinter out of thine own eye and behold
[56:06] a log of beam is in thine own eye th
[56:09] hypocrite First cast out the beam out of
[56:10] thine own eye then shalt thou See
[56:12] Clearly to cast out the M out of thy
[56:14] brother's eyes not that his Splinter
[56:16] doesn't need to be removed but first get
[56:18] rid of the log so you can see clearly
[56:21] you know how to deal with him we got to
[56:23] make sure our sticky nature is under
[56:25] control and the first way that we go to
[56:27] do that before we go to work on our
[56:29] family members before we go to work on
[56:31] the people that we go to church with
[56:33] before we start dealing with somebody
[56:35] else before we start reforming the
[56:37] people trying to reform them and help
[56:39] them we ought to work on number one
[56:41] right look in the mirror and that's all
[56:43] of us that's myself included so we are
[56:46] all Paul in Romans chapter 7 how many
[56:50] know that that's not Paul in a precon
[56:52] converted state but it's Paul after he
[56:55] has the the Holy
[56:57] Ghost he's still a human being Romans
[57:00] 7:14 we know the law is spiritual but I
[57:04] am carnal sold under sin for that which
[57:07] I do I allow not for what I would that
[57:09] do I not for what I hate that do I for I
[57:12] know that in me that is in my flesh
[57:15] dwelleth no good thing I'm skipping down
[57:16] through this chapter you can read the
[57:18] whole thing when you have time he said
[57:20] for to will is present with me but how
[57:21] to perform that which is good I find not
[57:25] again he said I find that a law that
[57:26] when I would do good evil is present
[57:28] with me oh Wretched Man that I am who
[57:31] shall deliver me from the body of this
[57:33] death yes he said I thank God through
[57:36] Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the
[57:39] mind I myself serve the law of God but
[57:41] with the flesh the law sin so I want to
[57:43] do what's right but the flesh don't
[57:44] always let me do what's right so we must
[57:47] be changed we must have a nature within
[57:49] us that overrides that old nature that
[57:52] controls it that we continually feed
[57:55] brother bam talks about that but the B
[57:57] said we cannot receive the promised son
[57:59] that's promised us today in these bodies
[58:01] that we live in these bodies are sin sir
[58:07] yes sir right now come on Church what is
[58:11] you what are you capable of In the Flesh
[58:13] everything anybody else is capable of
[58:16] because flesh is flesh right and spirit
[58:19] is spirit that it just it is what it is
[58:22] right it is sin these bodies are sin 10
[58:27] and these bodies listen to me if the new
[58:30] birth converted your body your flesh
[58:33] body you would not need to have a body
[58:37] change right we talked about that so
[58:39] wasn't it wonderful to look into the
[58:40] word and see what how our bodies are
[58:42] going to be changed why do our bodies
[58:44] need to be changed because it's that
[58:45] part of us that's not saved yet that
[58:48] can't be saved it's going back to the
[58:50] dust you say it this way that serpent
[58:52] part that that human part that part
[58:55] that's mixed up that but there's a part
[58:56] of you that's predestined on the inside
[58:59] that's what's going to create its own
[59:02] body are you with me now and you live in
[59:05] a glorified body that's the body you
[59:06] already have is a word body a theophany
[59:08] body that's waiting waiting oh my on
[59:11] this old body to get out of the way so
[59:14] you can step into that one so we must be
[59:17] changed we we cannot receive the sun in
[59:20] these bodies brother Bram taught we
[59:21] should only listen to our five senses
[59:24] that would be the senses of this body
[59:26] when they agree with what's on the
[59:28] inside Faith right you you you've heard
[59:31] him teach the six sense is is Faith
[59:33] right so if the six sense is Faith so
[59:37] then he said unless the five sents agree
[59:39] with the six sense we don't listen to
[59:41] our five senses he said now for instance
[59:44] Jesus made a statement a promise the
[59:46] inside man says it's true the outside
[59:49] man reasons that it can't be true to you
[59:54] right right so so you acknowledge God's
[59:57] the Healer but when it comes time that
[59:59] you get sick the outside man reasons
[1:00:04] that it can't be true to you he said
[1:00:07] then ignore the outside man and accept
[1:00:10] the inside man amen right so this this
[1:00:13] is how you're dealing so this outside
[1:00:15] he's difficult he's
[1:00:16] disobedient right he he's just not we'll
[1:00:20] get to deal with the other people in a
[1:00:21] minute but let's deal with ourselves
[1:00:23] first right the outside man is just dis
[1:00:26] obedient the outside man is Prickly the
[1:00:28] outside man is
[1:00:29] sticky and it takes something on the
[1:00:31] inside that'll go in and and and change
[1:00:34] that and overcome that but you got to
[1:00:36] fight that all of your life now it says
[1:00:39] he said ignore the outside man except
[1:00:41] the Inside Man now it's the same thing
[1:00:42] that Paul is speaking of he was sold
[1:00:44] under the law to carnal sin every one of
[1:00:46] us is the same he said that's the reason
[1:00:48] we have the troubles we do married four
[1:00:50] or five times and this that all kinds of
[1:00:52] sin and adulteries and everything else
[1:00:54] he said along in our lives is because of
[1:00:56] those things we are carnal and that part
[1:00:58] must perish but then inside we're a
[1:01:01] spirit Man soul inside he said that's
[1:01:03] spith in God's word and we bring our
[1:01:06] outside body under subjection to the
[1:01:08] word by Faith by accepting what God
[1:01:11] said Oh my he said how can I take a
[1:01:14] cuber and make a grain of weed out of it
[1:01:16] it's impossible for me to do it the only
[1:01:18] way it can be is because inside that
[1:01:19] Cleber has been transmitted from a
[1:01:22] cuckle bur to a germ called wheat life
[1:01:25] he said then you bu that cockle bur and
[1:01:26] it'll produce a grain of wheat because
[1:01:28] there's been a life of wheat put in the
[1:01:30] cockle bar and the life of the cckar has
[1:01:32] been taken out but the nature of the
[1:01:33] cocko bur is still sticky and it will be
[1:01:36] someone say it will be until this new
[1:01:38] life has fully been developed out of the
[1:01:41] ground and raised up again when it comes
[1:01:44] forth then it's no more cucklebur but
[1:01:46] wheat when does that happen church at
[1:01:49] the fullness of adoption and our body
[1:01:51] change that's when it
[1:01:53] happens and if we're going around
[1:01:55] dealing in our Rel relationships and
[1:01:56] dealing with people as if well they're
[1:01:58] not perfect brother Ben why know neither
[1:02:00] are you and neither am I right right but
[1:02:02] if you go around expecting Perfection
[1:02:04] out of people guess what's going to
[1:02:06] happen you're going to be bitterly
[1:02:07] disappointed right and there's not going
[1:02:09] to be very many people that you'll be
[1:02:10] able to be around or deal with and some
[1:02:13] of those people you're going to be in
[1:02:14] heaven with why it takes that change
[1:02:17] there got to be something on the inside
[1:02:18] that makes it takes that sticky nature
[1:02:20] and controls it and one day overcomes it
[1:02:23] right right now
[1:02:26] he said it will be until this new life
[1:02:27] has been fully developed when it comes
[1:02:28] forth there's no more cuckle but weat
[1:02:30] while it's here on the earth it's still
[1:02:31] sticky he said as long as you're in this
[1:02:34] life he said you're getting going to be
[1:02:37] sticky and have a carnal nature it's
[1:02:38] going to bother you as long as you live
[1:02:40] but the inside of you you're born again
[1:02:42] when you're raised up you're in the
[1:02:44] likeness of Christ and all someone say
[1:02:46] all the sin has gone from you oh I'm
[1:02:50] looking forward to that day now I don't
[1:02:53] give you an excuse to live like the
[1:02:55] devil what does it do do it it gives you
[1:02:57] a
[1:02:58] challenge right it must be
[1:03:00] overcome for those that walk in the
[1:03:03] spirit they are the sons of God those
[1:03:05] who are led by the spirit Philippians
[1:03:06] 3:2 tells us our conversation is in
[1:03:09] heaven from whence also we look for the
[1:03:11] Savior Lord Jesus Christ who shall
[1:03:14] change our look at that word vile
[1:03:20] body change our vile body it's vile
[1:03:24] that's why knees need to be repl placed
[1:03:26] right it's a vile body I think about
[1:03:29] that word vile it's it's an interesting
[1:03:31] word it it means that it's it's a body
[1:03:35] of
[1:03:36] humiliation changes our body of
[1:03:38] humiliation oh my may be fashion like
[1:03:41] into his glorious body according to the
[1:03:43] working whereby he's able even to subdue
[1:03:46] all things unto himself so brother
[1:03:49] bandam taught us I won't spend long on
[1:03:51] this because you all know it but he
[1:03:52] taught us that we've got to we've got to
[1:03:56] to one nature over the other right and I
[1:03:59] be careful with my words here but you're
[1:04:01] feeding the nature of the good dog right
[1:04:05] and not the bad dog right as the old
[1:04:08] Indian chief said he said which one wins
[1:04:10] he said well it depends on which one she
[1:04:12] feeds the
[1:04:13] most right so and and so you uh you you
[1:04:18] got to be careful because a lot of times
[1:04:20] what happens to people and what really
[1:04:22] brings a stumbling block is when someone
[1:04:24] who professes to be a Christian and
[1:04:26] their way up here and they've been
[1:04:27] around for a long time and yet they're
[1:04:29] so difficult and and it throws a
[1:04:32] stumbling block because sometimes what
[1:04:34] happens because the holy spirit will
[1:04:36] bring you into subjection but sometimes
[1:04:39] what happens is a person gets a
[1:04:40] religious spirit right and that
[1:04:43] religious spirit just makes them feel
[1:04:46] like that they're that that that they're
[1:04:47] okay it's just enough of the message to
[1:04:50] make them feel like they're okay but
[1:04:52] they have no control over this sticky
[1:04:55] nature and so what they'll do is they'll
[1:04:57] spiritualize it now some of y'all know
[1:05:00] what I'm talking about they'll try to
[1:05:01] make it spiritual and say well it was
[1:05:04] the Lord that made me do it and it
[1:05:06] wasn't the Lord that made Moses Smite
[1:05:08] The Rock twice it wasn't the Lord that
[1:05:11] made even though God honored it yeah but
[1:05:14] it wasn't the Lord Brother BR taught us
[1:05:15] it was not the Lord that caused Elisha
[1:05:17] to to call for the bear to eat up the
[1:05:20] children right he said it was not the
[1:05:21] spirit of Christ yet God honored it
[1:05:24] because he was a prophet yeah but it was
[1:05:26] not the spirit of Christ what is that
[1:05:28] many times it's just a a religious
[1:05:30] spirit gets on people and they continue
[1:05:32] to act in a carnal way and thinking that
[1:05:34] it's the Holy Ghost listen a person who
[1:05:36] yells and throws
[1:05:38] things who is a sinner they're a sinner
[1:05:41] and they yells and throw things they'll
[1:05:42] they'll excuse themselves because it's
[1:05:44] just the way they are right this is just
[1:05:46] me right but you let that person get a
[1:05:49] religious spirit they'll still yell
[1:05:51] they'll still throw
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:05:54] things boy it's y'all are thinking
[1:05:58] tonight they'll still yell they'll still
[1:06:00] throw things they'll still throw fits
[1:06:03] grown-ups right they got no control over
[1:06:06] their over their sticky nature the Holy
[1:06:09] Ghost has no influence over them and yet
[1:06:12] they'll call it righteous
[1:06:15] indignation or if he's a pastor he'll
[1:06:18] he'll say well it's just my
[1:06:21] job come on or if he's a Sunday school
[1:06:24] te well you know what always just kind
[1:06:26] of fit in say well it's just you know
[1:06:28] the Lord it just he just made me do that
[1:06:31] it's just that Spirit rising up in me no
[1:06:33] it's an enticing spirit is what it is
[1:06:36] brother brand taught us a religious
[1:06:37] devil is eight times worse that's right
[1:06:40] than a regular devil why because that's
[1:06:41] what Jesus said he said the house is
[1:06:44] swept out and garnish he said the
[1:06:46] devil's cast out and he goes out and
[1:06:47] wanders around he said and he comes back
[1:06:49] finds the house empty remember he comes
[1:06:51] out back and finds the house empty he
[1:06:53] comes back in he brings seven other
[1:06:55] devil so it's eight times
[1:06:57] worse right seven other Devils with him
[1:07:00] and when he gets back he comes back he
[1:07:02] said let me go back to my house right
[1:07:05] and he's worse than he was at the
[1:07:06] beginning he's just religious now right
[1:07:08] so now brother brand said always don't
[1:07:10] judge your life by how much power you
[1:07:12] have to perform Miracles we don't judge
[1:07:14] ourselves by how much knowledge you have
[1:07:16] of the word but always someone say
[1:07:18] always always judge yourselves look back
[1:07:21] and taking inventory of what kind of a
[1:07:23] fruit that the life that you presently
[1:07:26] live now is
[1:07:29] bearing oh my what is that the fruits of
[1:07:31] the spirit 1 Corinthians 13:2 Paul says
[1:07:34] though I have the gift of Prophecy and
[1:07:36] understand all Mysteries and all
[1:07:37] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:07:39] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:07:41] not charity or gape love I am nothing
[1:07:45] right yeah so we must have that so first
[1:07:48] of all if you want to handle difficult
[1:07:49] people make sure you're not the
[1:07:51] difficult
[1:07:52] person how do we handle difficult people
[1:07:55] we meet people where they are and not
[1:07:57] where we wish they
[1:08:00] were Amen brother Ben that's good I tell
[1:08:03] you
[1:08:04] what the Bible tells us hope deferred
[1:08:06] maketh the heart
[1:08:07] sick but when the desire comes it's a
[1:08:10] tree of life The Sinner is a
[1:08:13] sinner right and you meet him as the
[1:08:16] sinner right you can't expect the sinner
[1:08:19] to be a saint he's not going to be and
[1:08:22] if we quit expecting people to act
[1:08:24] different ways than they've always
[1:08:26] acted right you you'd have a whole lot
[1:08:28] easier time choosing whether or not to
[1:08:30] be around that person but if every time
[1:08:32] you're around them and you just find
[1:08:33] yourself disgusted well they didn't act
[1:08:34] like a Christian well because they're
[1:08:35] not a
[1:08:37] Christian right so a sinner is a sinner
[1:08:41] the forward man the the man who just you
[1:08:43] know he he may he may be a deacon he may
[1:08:45] be a pastor he may be a he may be an
[1:08:47] evangelist but he he just never had a
[1:08:49] nature change he can't control himself
[1:08:52] he just needs the
[1:08:54] Lord right he's just that way that's the
[1:08:56] way that he is oh Lord help us not to be
[1:09:00] that way but that's the way that he is
[1:09:02] so we got to let people be what they are
[1:09:04] you can't change the person how do you
[1:09:06] deal with that the Bible says this about
[1:09:09] the way that the forward man is it says
[1:09:10] an ungodly man diggeth up evil diggeth
[1:09:14] up evil and in his lips there is as
[1:09:16] burning fire a forward man Seth Strife
[1:09:20] see he's a man who who when he or or a
[1:09:24] woman for that matter a man or a woman
[1:09:25] woman who finds out something and
[1:09:27] immediately just burns him up you got to
[1:09:29] tell it you got to tell it in a
[1:09:31] malicious way right he's got to tell it
[1:09:33] in the in the most unflattering way that
[1:09:35] he could possibly tell it a forward man
[1:09:38] Seth strife and a Whisperer separateth
[1:09:41] Chief friends why why does he so strip
[1:09:43] because he's a forward man why does the
[1:09:45] ungodly man dig up evil because he's an
[1:09:47] ungodly man a violent man entices his
[1:09:50] neighbor and leadth him into the way
[1:09:52] that is not good why does he do that
[1:09:54] he's a violent man
[1:09:56] right that's who they are now we do have
[1:09:59] a higher expectations of expectation of
[1:10:01] Christians as I said that sometimes
[1:10:03] brings a stumbling block but the brand
[1:10:05] said I never did condemn a sinner from
[1:10:07] the way he does he's a sinner he can't
[1:10:09] help it but those people who claim to be
[1:10:11] Christians and then live in sin that's
[1:10:13] the one we got to Target on you take a
[1:10:15] pig if you see a pig rooting in a manure
[1:10:16] pile that's nothing he's a pig that's
[1:10:18] his nature you'll never get a lamb there
[1:10:20] that's right if I see people dressing
[1:10:21] acting and looking like the world
[1:10:23] talking like the world using a little
[1:10:25] slaying dirty jokes entertaining smoking
[1:10:27] cigarettes going to picture shows
[1:10:29] staying home from church he said that's
[1:10:30] the world that's all the pleasure they
[1:10:32] get they don't know any better but you
[1:10:34] have tasted and know the Lord is good
[1:10:35] it's you that I'm aiming at he says
[1:10:38] right again the world just does that you
[1:10:40] don't expect them to show up you don't
[1:10:42] expect them to do the right thing if if
[1:10:45] someone always does something a certain
[1:10:48] way that that's who they
[1:10:50] are right at some point the pattern is
[1:10:53] clear and so we don't go into that
[1:10:56] expecting different but we pray for the
[1:10:59] person so they can be born again they
[1:11:00] need the Lord yes and doesn't do any
[1:11:03] good to psychoanalyze them or try to
[1:11:05] figure them out and try to try to say
[1:11:07] well if I was different maybe if I was
[1:11:09] different maybe if I was different no if
[1:11:10] you're doing all you know to do and
[1:11:11] you're serving the lord maybe the person
[1:11:13] is just a difficult person maybe that's
[1:11:16] just who they are maybe they just need
[1:11:17] more of God in their life maybe they
[1:11:19] just need God in their life
[1:11:21] period so but we got to meet them where
[1:11:23] they are if we want to help people amen
[1:11:26] see you don't you don't usually know why
[1:11:29] a person is acting the way that they are
[1:11:31] do you know that we rarely know so and
[1:11:35] and why their nature is so sticky in
[1:11:37] those particular
[1:11:38] areas Paul met people where they were so
[1:11:41] did brother brandham if you find in 1
[1:11:42] Corinthians 9:19 he said though I be
[1:11:45] free from all men this is Paul speaking
[1:11:47] he said yet have I made myself servant
[1:11:48] unto all that I might gain the more unto
[1:11:51] the Jews I became as a Jew that I might
[1:11:53] gain the Jews to them that are under the
[1:11:55] law is under the law that I might gain
[1:11:57] them that are under the law so he said I
[1:11:59] conducted myself as if I was under the
[1:12:01] law when I was around the Jews and the
[1:12:04] most famous example of that is when Paul
[1:12:07] takes Timothy and has him circumcised as
[1:12:10] an
[1:12:11] adult even though Paul taught the
[1:12:13] Galatians not to do that but he does it
[1:12:16] because he he's trying to make peace
[1:12:18] with the PE with the people in Jerusalem
[1:12:20] he's doing his best to fit in and it
[1:12:22] doesn't end up working you you all know
[1:12:24] the story but that's they he he said to
[1:12:27] them I tried to be like I was under the
[1:12:29] law he said but that I might gain them
[1:12:32] that are under the law to them that are
[1:12:33] without law it's without law being not
[1:12:35] without law to God but under the law to
[1:12:37] Christ so he's not he's saying it's true
[1:12:40] I'm not putting on something I can act
[1:12:42] as if I'm under the law because I am
[1:12:44] under the law I'm under the law of
[1:12:46] Christ right that I might gain them that
[1:12:49] are without law to the weak became I as
[1:12:51] weak that I might gain the weak I am
[1:12:54] made all things to all men that I might
[1:12:56] by all means save some so this is the
[1:13:00] Paul the argument Paul is making he said
[1:13:01] don't let your Liberty be an offense to
[1:13:02] somebody else right because there's some
[1:13:05] things you could do maybe that they
[1:13:06] shouldn't do or maybe they've got a weak
[1:13:08] conscience and they're unable to handle
[1:13:10] your Christmas tree or your you
[1:13:11] know right are you with me now winry
[1:13:19] decoration and so all some of us can
[1:13:22] handle wintry decorations and others
[1:13:24] have a a hard time with that but but you
[1:13:27] know you don't you just don't throw it
[1:13:28] in her face that's all you can do what
[1:13:32] you do right but don't throw it in her
[1:13:34] face because to the weak became I as
[1:13:36] weak that I might gain the weak I made
[1:13:37] all things to all men that I might by
[1:13:39] all means save some and this I do for
[1:13:42] the gospel's sake that I might be
[1:13:44] partaker thereof with you now if you go
[1:13:47] on down and there's several verses in
[1:13:49] between but this is the context where
[1:13:52] Paul is talking about keeping under his
[1:13:54] body but I keep under my body and bring
[1:13:56] it into subjection I never really
[1:13:58] noticed that Brother David or put that
[1:13:59] together before but Paul is saying I
[1:14:02] I've got to fight myself in order to do
[1:14:05] this right I got to keep under my body
[1:14:07] bring it in subjection L to by any means
[1:14:09] when I preach to others I myself should
[1:14:11] be a Cast Away Paul may not have been
[1:14:13] fighting lust or or filth or wanting to
[1:14:15] go out in the world he'd overcome all of
[1:14:17] that he wasn't fighting that what was he
[1:14:18] fighting he was fighting the desire to
[1:14:21] be right all the time the desire to show
[1:14:23] him that he had Liberty to prove to him
[1:14:25] that he was right come on now huh that's
[1:14:28] so he said I keep under my body so I can
[1:14:30] be all things to all men and not be
[1:14:35] offensive a that good how do you deal
[1:14:38] with difficult people and Paul's again
[1:14:40] Paul's a got a a masters in that he's
[1:14:43] got his PhD in dealing with difficult
[1:14:47] people when Paul's at the Sanhedrin you
[1:14:49] talk about a diff a difficult body of
[1:14:51] people the Sanhedrin would have been
[1:14:54] that they were split into Republicans
[1:14:57] and de I mean s Sadducees and
[1:15:00] Pharisees right so they they were split
[1:15:03] in half and so Paul gets up in in the
[1:15:06] middle you remember he got in trouble he
[1:15:07] got in a tight spot brother brandom said
[1:15:09] when he got in that tight spot he he
[1:15:11] stood up and he said it's because I'm a
[1:15:13] Pharisee he said that's why they got me
[1:15:15] up here he said I believe in the
[1:15:18] resurrection well he did just like they
[1:15:20] did but that wasn't that wasn't a lie he
[1:15:23] was he was fitting in with them for a
[1:15:25] purpose he was using wisdom when he went
[1:15:27] to Mars Hill and he preached at Mars
[1:15:29] Hill Paul doesn't go up there and quote
[1:15:30] Moses to him he doesn't go up there and
[1:15:33] quote David and all the prophets what
[1:15:35] does he do go read the sermon on Mars
[1:15:37] Hill he goes and reasons to them from
[1:15:38] there where they're at they don't know
[1:15:40] these prophets and things but they knew
[1:15:42] their own poets he quotes their own
[1:15:43] poets to them and brings them or brings
[1:15:46] it all the way around to
[1:15:48] Christ right and and and it's a great
[1:15:50] example to us now and I don't say we
[1:15:53] should leave it's not that he purposely
[1:15:56] left it out it's just the Holy Spirit
[1:15:57] led him to do that brother brandom
[1:15:59] taught us we should serve God like we
[1:16:02] serve our
[1:16:03] wives now some of
[1:16:07] us he said serve God like you serve your
[1:16:10] wife now how is that this is a great
[1:16:13] teaching I I just love the message of
[1:16:15] the hour just so much here so he he said
[1:16:18] when I go overseas he said I go and get
[1:16:20] a gift he said I want to make sure it's
[1:16:22] handled correctly he said because if I
[1:16:24] send it back by airplanes it'll get
[1:16:26] broken he said so I buy her something
[1:16:28] and I bring it with me he said and then
[1:16:31] I go and give it to her in a certain way
[1:16:33] honey I I I got this gift for you it
[1:16:35] just means ain't that nice when you're
[1:16:37] able to do that so what are you doing
[1:16:39] you're serving your wife he said to
[1:16:41] serve God that way he said now that's
[1:16:43] the way you serve God and why do does he
[1:16:47] do it he don't do it because she would
[1:16:48] make him do it and they didn't have a
[1:16:50] contract said every time you're overseas
[1:16:52] you got to buy a certain thing and you
[1:16:54] know I felt the pressure of that before
[1:16:56] I I've bought stuff remember brother
[1:16:58] Joel when we were in Egypt buying stuff
[1:16:59] from that little gift shop in there and
[1:17:01] 2:00 in the morning you know and we had
[1:17:03] not we'd been in Egypt and not seen
[1:17:05] anything really that great we' we'd seen
[1:17:07] the the hinder parts of Egypt I guess
[1:17:09] you could say and some of the bad parts
[1:17:11] and and some of our Egyptian friends May
[1:17:13] listen to this but but they it was some
[1:17:16] of the areas we were in were really bad
[1:17:17] and we didn't go to all the gift shops
[1:17:19] and stuff and so we're searching that
[1:17:21] little thing I think everything I bought
[1:17:23] is already broke but cuz the kids have
[1:17:25] played with it and stuff but but but
[1:17:27] what were we doing we were trying to
[1:17:29] bring something home not because we had
[1:17:30] to our wives would have been happy for
[1:17:32] us to just be home after two weeks right
[1:17:35] I got home one time I believe was from
[1:17:37] Africa I got home and there was a great
[1:17:39] big sign waiting on me and they had the
[1:17:41] house all clean fixed up and and I
[1:17:43] thought my goodness I had to go out more
[1:17:45] often you
[1:17:47] know brother brother brandom had a
[1:17:49] complex with sister Ma I don't know why
[1:17:50] I'm getting into this tonight but you
[1:17:52] just bear with me brother brandom had a
[1:17:53] little bit of complex with sister m cuz
[1:17:55] he felt like she didn't want him to be
[1:17:56] home he said she's so easy about it that
[1:17:59] she just does everything for me and
[1:18:01] packs my clothes and stuff and he goes
[1:18:02] on a hunting trip and he's sitting there
[1:18:04] thinking well maybe she just doesn't
[1:18:05] love
[1:18:06] me cuz she doesn't say nothing about me
[1:18:09] being gone and sometimes I think she did
[1:18:11] say something because I found in the
[1:18:12] message brother brand said one time she
[1:18:14] told him that uh he said I love you and
[1:18:17] she said he didn't so he said we
[1:18:19] disagreed but we still get
[1:18:23] along right he was a man
[1:18:25] so but now uh we we we find that he said
[1:18:28] that's the way that we serve God he said
[1:18:31] not because well I ought to take my
[1:18:33] Bible and go down to John's house he
[1:18:34] don't know nothing about the Lord I
[1:18:35] ought to go down there but I tell you if
[1:18:37] there's any John's I'm not talking about
[1:18:40] you he don't know nothing about the Lord
[1:18:42] I ought to go down there but I tell you
[1:18:43] oh Christian life is so hard oh you
[1:18:45] don't love God you've never been born
[1:18:48] again now listen what he's saying when
[1:18:50] you love him you love to go do something
[1:18:52] for him to bring in souls to him it
[1:18:55] isn't a duty It's A Love Affair he said
[1:18:57] how I hope that goes way down to the
[1:18:58] fifth rib on the left side and anchors
[1:19:01] there and stay see it's a love affair
[1:19:02] you love to do it if you love your wife
[1:19:04] you love to do something for her he said
[1:19:06] now that kind of love you can't have
[1:19:08] that same type of love for Jesus he
[1:19:09] explains the difference in filio and
[1:19:11] agapo love he said uh it's two different
[1:19:13] things but when you divinely love Christ
[1:19:15] like you love your wife only be a
[1:19:16] greater higher level than this is down
[1:19:18] here he said don't worry he said you'll
[1:19:20] be about the father's business trying to
[1:19:21] win souls and pray for the sick and do
[1:19:23] everything you can because you love him
[1:19:25] you want to please him oh you think God
[1:19:28] I know where there's a fellow that I
[1:19:29] believe I could lead to you now watch
[1:19:31] how he tells us how to do it yeah he
[1:19:33] said way you'll go and take all your
[1:19:37] tracks and your books and your right go
[1:19:40] down there and sit him down tie him up
[1:19:42] and force him to listen to a tape Lord
[1:19:45] no that's not how we do it he said away
[1:19:48] you'll go and talk to him in a nice way
[1:19:51] cuz that's why you give your wife that
[1:19:52] gift that's right right you're doing out
[1:19:55] of love for the Lord yes right not even
[1:19:57] just so much love for the person though
[1:19:59] you have that but love for the Lord so
[1:20:01] when you go to that difficult person
[1:20:03] maybe that unsaved person which every
[1:20:05] unsaved person is difficult and every
[1:20:07] saved person has some level of
[1:20:08] difficulty in their life but you talk
[1:20:10] about a difficult person and and and
[1:20:13] going to them how do you do it you talk
[1:20:15] to them in a nice way how do you do John
[1:20:17] I want to talk to you tonight about
[1:20:19] going fishing yes now that's would be a
[1:20:22] person if they if they like fishing
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:25] yes now oh I love to fish talk fishing
[1:20:28] to him for a while talk about his
[1:20:32] chickens whatever farming he's going to
[1:20:35] do you can talk to Caleb for a while
[1:20:36] about chickens you know some people have
[1:20:38] very little chicken knowledge but some
[1:20:40] others
[1:20:42] do but now he said talk to him about his
[1:20:45] chickens or whatever farming he's going
[1:20:46] to do for a while until God opens up the
[1:20:49] way and gives you a chance to send home
[1:20:51] the
[1:20:52] gospel right here is where we get in
[1:20:54] trouble many times with our family
[1:20:56] because we get so frustrated because
[1:20:57] they're not serving God we want to just
[1:20:59] go out and make it happen right and and
[1:21:02] it's not never going to work and you all
[1:21:04] know this you you got to love them and
[1:21:07] you got to love God enough to wait for
[1:21:09] an opportunity for the right opportunity
[1:21:11] because everybody wants a glass of water
[1:21:13] on a hot day but nobody wants it in
[1:21:15] their
[1:21:17] face right so he said until God opens up
[1:21:21] the way and and gives you a chance to
[1:21:23] send home the gospel then when you win
[1:21:24] that Soul you present it before the
[1:21:26] father like I said I did the little
[1:21:28] present to my wife here father with
[1:21:30] happiness you do it because you love it
[1:21:32] not a duty but a Love or don't you want
[1:21:34] to have that kind of attitude not a duty
[1:21:37] but a love listen what Paul says charity
[1:21:39] suffereth long and His Kind charity
[1:21:43] that's a goo love envieth not charity
[1:21:46] vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
[1:21:50] does not behave itself
[1:21:52] unseemly seeketh not her own is not
[1:21:56] easily provoked thinketh no evil and
[1:22:01] that leads me to the next Point what
[1:22:02] should how should we deal with difficult
[1:22:04] people think no evil of the difficult
[1:22:08] person other words don't let your
[1:22:10] imagination run away with you the person
[1:22:12] is difficult enough without you giving
[1:22:14] them motives they don't even
[1:22:17] have they may have just had a bad
[1:22:20] day right you you young people know that
[1:22:23] sometimes your parents just had a bad
[1:22:24] day day let them have their bad day and
[1:22:26] tomorrow ask them
[1:22:29] again that's just the
[1:22:32] truth sometimes people just have a bad
[1:22:35] day and not my parents they always keep
[1:22:38] don't ever change your mind about
[1:22:40] anything
[1:22:41] okay I
[1:22:44] do my my daughter has figured that out
[1:22:47] you know and Peter has two you know they
[1:22:48] kind of they wait for the moments you
[1:22:53] know give them the benefit of the doubt
[1:22:55] he said now we we we don't want to think
[1:22:59] evil of the of a diff even a difficult
[1:23:01] person don't
[1:23:03] overthink quit quit Discerning evil
[1:23:05] intentions or or evil spirits all over
[1:23:08] the place all right like that's just not
[1:23:10] helpful yes right remember brother Bram
[1:23:13] talked about the woman he said this man
[1:23:15] said I'm going to cast that devil out of
[1:23:16] her I'm going to go to the house and
[1:23:18] just cast that devil she won't listen to
[1:23:20] me she won't serve the Lord I'm just
[1:23:21] going to go cast that devil out of her
[1:23:22] brother BR said no don't do that he said
[1:23:25] go home and tell her you love her right
[1:23:27] and do something for her give her a nice
[1:23:30] gift right he said well that's I she got
[1:23:33] a devil he said she may but you never
[1:23:35] going to get anywhere with her like that
[1:23:37] that's right right don't don't you know
[1:23:40] Devils do cause a lot of problems but
[1:23:44] what we need to recognize that many
[1:23:46] times it's just the way we're dealing
[1:23:47] with it the devil takes that opportunity
[1:23:50] yes right and then and then and then
[1:23:53] causes it to make makes it worse than
[1:23:54] what it was now if if nothing else
[1:23:57] realize it's not the person CU we
[1:23:58] believe in a God who has power over
[1:24:01] everything and over every situ you
[1:24:03] believe that tonight over every
[1:24:04] situation he's able to bring in our
[1:24:06] children he's able to touch our loved
[1:24:08] ones he's able to keep us together and
[1:24:10] keep us in Harmony and unity he's able
[1:24:12] to do
[1:24:14] that right God allows these things to
[1:24:17] happen many times like Paul and Barnabas
[1:24:19] having their conflict in the acts and
[1:24:22] getting separated but it was needful for
[1:24:25] the gospel's sake later they come back
[1:24:28] together and the Bible tells us Barnabas
[1:24:30] was a man full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:24:31] disagreed with the messenger of the hour
[1:24:34] right now what would we make him on
[1:24:37] right how would we put him out but he
[1:24:39] was a man filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:41] faith the Bible says if it hadn't been
[1:24:43] for him Paul would have never even come
[1:24:45] and been what he was because Barnabas
[1:24:47] helped him in 2 Samuel 6 16 and9 we find
[1:24:52] David and I've talked to you about this
[1:24:53] before but it just fits in so perfectly
[1:24:54] here David is you remember he's he's
[1:24:57] being run out of the city by his own son
[1:25:00] and the reason that's happening is
[1:25:02] because David's done something horrible
[1:25:04] right he deserves to be run around a
[1:25:06] little bit but yet he's God's man and
[1:25:10] he's got a he's he's got he's got a
[1:25:13] heart for God and yet he's being run out
[1:25:15] of the city and he's got a man there
[1:25:17] with him and abashi the son of Zariah
[1:25:21] and and and here comes a man up along
[1:25:23] doe the Ed Edomite he comes up and he
[1:25:25] begins to curse him and throw rocks and
[1:25:28] dirt at
[1:25:29] him and he said why should this dead dog
[1:25:32] curse my Lord the king let me go over
[1:25:33] and take off his
[1:25:37] head brother JT we felt like that
[1:25:39] sometimes haven't we some of yall feel
[1:25:41] like let me you know this person's
[1:25:43] coming against the pastor throwing
[1:25:44] stones down let let me go cut off his
[1:25:46] head right and David reacts in the right
[1:25:49] way instead of encouraging them you know
[1:25:51] we don't need we don't need people to
[1:25:53] defend us what we need need is to trust
[1:25:55] God right so David what does David do
[1:25:58] David says David says King said what
[1:26:01] have I to do with you you Sons as their
[1:26:02] ass so let him curse because the Lord
[1:26:04] has said unto him curse David who shall
[1:26:07] then say wherefore hast thou done so now
[1:26:10] brother BR said watch the spirit of God
[1:26:12] and the spirit of the devil working are
[1:26:13] you still with me tonight he said if you
[1:26:16] notice he was crippled that was doing
[1:26:18] the Edomite was a he said it
[1:26:20] represents the spiritual of the
[1:26:22] people today who make fun of the truth
[1:26:24] spirit of God in Christ manifesting
[1:26:25] itself he said that was the spirit of
[1:26:27] Christ in David being rejected as a king
[1:26:30] and today when the people make fun of
[1:26:31] the people who has received the Holy
[1:26:33] Spirit trying to achieve something he
[1:26:35] said to draw Methodist and Pentecostals
[1:26:37] and Baptists and Pentecostals and
[1:26:38] Presbyterians all together as a Unity as
[1:26:41] a body of Christ and they see the spirit
[1:26:43] working and they say well look that's
[1:26:45] Pentecostal right and and because they
[1:26:48] they associate the word Pentecostal with
[1:26:51] bad people like some people do message
[1:26:53] that's right
[1:26:55] right and he said away with him I know
[1:26:58] one went off with another man's wife I
[1:26:59] know this one got drunk I know this one
[1:27:01] did this I know this one did that all
[1:27:04] that he said but they're big enough to
[1:27:05] hide their own things now we've seen
[1:27:07] that right they're big enough to hide
[1:27:09] their own things they can hide it but
[1:27:11] David was exposed why he had the spirit
[1:27:14] of Christ in him I say thank God we
[1:27:16] don't want to hide nothing we want we
[1:27:18] want to be right we want things to be
[1:27:21] right right so we want we we we want God
[1:27:24] to come and yeah we're human beings and
[1:27:25] we have our problems around the message
[1:27:27] but listen yeah don't throw rocks at it
[1:27:29] and dirt at it that puts you in the
[1:27:30] wrong group oh yeah right but that guard
[1:27:34] said shall I take the head of that dog
[1:27:35] that curse my king and watch the spirit
[1:27:37] of Christ in David let him alone yeah
[1:27:40] and I was talking recently with somebody
[1:27:42] and they said well we ought to sue these
[1:27:43] people and things and and I had that
[1:27:45] conversation with them and I kind of
[1:27:47] agreed you know because they're telling
[1:27:48] lies on brother brandom and things and I
[1:27:50] thought well maybe that would be right
[1:27:52] but then I began to read this and I
[1:27:53] thought no
[1:27:54] no let him alone maybe the Lord told him
[1:27:57] to do
[1:27:58] it huh maybe the name just get in the
[1:28:01] paper and people will see that and go
[1:28:02] looking it up and somebody be saved all
[1:28:05] right right let him alone the Lord has
[1:28:07] told him to curse me he said instead
[1:28:09] today we want to get up our Fist and
[1:28:10] fight him see chop his head off yeah get
[1:28:13] him out he don't belong to us right and
[1:28:15] that's the Temptation when somebody gets
[1:28:17] a little trouble in the church or
[1:28:18] somebody leaves and everybody just get
[1:28:20] together and band together and and
[1:28:22] crucify them huh that's not what we
[1:28:24] ought to do we ought to love the person
[1:28:26] that much more right right you want you
[1:28:29] want to go somewhere else to church I
[1:28:30] love you just as much as I ever loved
[1:28:32] you and care for you as much as there's
[1:28:34] anything I can do to help you I want to
[1:28:36] help you right are you with me now I'm
[1:28:39] not just saying that I I believe we can
[1:28:41] do that because that's what we're
[1:28:42] supposed to do it's the spirit of Christ
[1:28:45] he said let him alone the Lord has told
[1:28:46] him to curse me that little
[1:28:48] running along there throwing dirt on
[1:28:49] David he said that's what they try to do
[1:28:51] today on the spirit of Christ they're a
[1:28:52] bunch of Holy Rollers well there're a
[1:28:54] bunch of this there's nothing to them
[1:28:56] there's nothing to Divine Healing
[1:28:57] there's no such thing as Angels no such
[1:28:59] thing as prophets all those things the
[1:29:00] days of Miracles pass throwing dirt let
[1:29:03] them alone when David returned in power
[1:29:05] when he come back as the full king of
[1:29:07] Israel he said don't worry this Jesus
[1:29:09] whose Spirit we have today how many
[1:29:10] believe this acted his part out will
[1:29:13] return again in a physical body the
[1:29:14] second time in glory in power and
[1:29:16] Majesty that little dirt thrower fell on
[1:29:18] his face and begged for mercy you find
[1:29:20] that later on he said let him alone the
[1:29:22] spirit of Christ in us don't communica
[1:29:24] him let's remember that all these things
[1:29:26] has got to come to pass we've got one
[1:29:30] thing to do what do we have to do Church
[1:29:32] move
[1:29:33] on move on don't spend all your time uh
[1:29:36] fighting with that person that's
[1:29:38] difficult move on don't assume that the
[1:29:40] motives are bad move
[1:29:43] on God promised he would make everything
[1:29:45] work together for good to them that love
[1:29:46] him let's keep the discernment of spirit
[1:29:48] keep the
[1:29:49] objective right I know it's hard to hear
[1:29:52] sometimes but it's it's true
[1:29:54] he said we're here to serve God each one
[1:29:57] fellowshipping going along and serving
[1:29:59] God Paul told us he said walk worthy of
[1:30:03] the vocation wherewith you're called
[1:30:05] with all loneliness and meekness with
[1:30:07] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[1:30:09] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[1:30:11] the spirit in the bond of peace I think
[1:30:12] this is the last one if we want to know
[1:30:16] how to deal with difficult people how
[1:30:17] should we deal with them repent quickly
[1:30:20] and forgive quickly amen quickly that's
[1:30:24] the key that's the thing I want to key
[1:30:25] in on agree with thine adversary quickly
[1:30:28] Jesus says wh while thou are in the way
[1:30:31] with him while the arguments going
[1:30:33] on because it's not always important to
[1:30:35] be
[1:30:36] right lest at any time the adversary
[1:30:39] escalate right you know what that is he
[1:30:41] he he brings it up deliver thee to the
[1:30:44] judge and and the judge delivered to
[1:30:46] thee to the officer and th'll be cast
[1:30:47] into prison now he's not telling you to
[1:30:49] compromise on the word but if it's
[1:30:51] something you can agree on agree amen
[1:30:56] quickly right or better yet many times
[1:31:00] agree to
[1:31:02] disagree right love him care for the
[1:31:05] person make sure it doesn't escalate
[1:31:08] make sure it doesn't get any worse than
[1:31:10] what it is yeah right and and and when
[1:31:12] you mark 11:25 says when you stand
[1:31:15] praying forgive when you stand praying
[1:31:17] quickly yeah right not don't wait
[1:31:20] forgive yeah if you have ought against
[1:31:23] any that but your father also which is
[1:31:25] in heaven May forgive you your
[1:31:26] trespasses I recognize I need to be
[1:31:29] forgiven so I've got to
[1:31:32] forgive right again and this is the the
[1:31:35] I realize we all fail in these things
[1:31:37] you understand I'm human too right and I
[1:31:40] want to just cut things off and just
[1:31:42] live in my own world and not deal with
[1:31:44] the person that's not what God called us
[1:31:46] to do right again there is a place where
[1:31:48] a person becomes harmful and you got to
[1:31:50] do that but that should be the last case
[1:31:52] scenario even Paul when when he talked
[1:31:54] about the man who' done such horrible
[1:31:56] things and they had to take him out from
[1:31:57] under the Fellowship of the church and
[1:31:59] excommunicate him from the church in the
[1:32:00] next letter he said bring him back in
[1:32:02] and love on him treat him right when he
[1:32:06] comes back church are we Christians or
[1:32:09] not we believe we are we're going to
[1:32:11] have to deal with difficult people let's
[1:32:12] deal with them in the right
[1:32:16] way he said brother BR said don't forget
[1:32:18] the Commandments of God to you little
[1:32:20] children love one another love everybody
[1:32:23] right or wrong sinner or Saint love them
[1:32:25] anyhow if you don't then pray God to
[1:32:27] help you cuz God loved the Sinner and
[1:32:29] the nature of God is in you if the man
[1:32:32] is wrong love him anyhow don't partake
[1:32:33] of his sins see don't partake of his
[1:32:35] sins but in sweetness not in sourness
[1:32:38] and rebuke in sweetness tell him of the
[1:32:40] hope of life that rests within you
[1:32:42] through Jesus Christ being revealed to
[1:32:44] you by the Holy Ghost I know we live in
[1:32:46] a generation I'm closing in just a few
[1:32:48] moments we live in a generation of of
[1:32:52] people who have what they call self-care
[1:32:54] and self-love and I know that it's a
[1:32:56] good intentions and people want to take
[1:32:58] care of themselves I realize that but
[1:33:00] it's it's almost antithetical to the
[1:33:03] scriptures the scriptures don't teach us
[1:33:05] to love ourselves it teaches us to love
[1:33:08] Christ what is the two Commandments that
[1:33:10] he gave us he said love God with all
[1:33:11] your soul and strength and might and
[1:33:13] body and mind and everything else and
[1:33:14] then love your neighbor as
[1:33:16] yourself right and you do have to take
[1:33:18] care of yourself sometime but it
[1:33:19] shouldn't be the overarching goal of
[1:33:21] your life well if I can't you know if
[1:33:23] the if the boss don't treat me exactly
[1:33:25] right I'll just leave and go somewhere
[1:33:26] else no you if you'll find out nobody
[1:33:28] will employ you after a while why
[1:33:30] because you become a difficult person
[1:33:33] right right and and and so many times
[1:33:34] you got to put up with people who are
[1:33:36] difficult and that's why Paul says obey
[1:33:38] your boss he said not just the good but
[1:33:40] also what word does he use the frow word
[1:33:43] the
[1:33:44] difficult boy I'm getting myself in
[1:33:48] trouble the the Bible tells us
[1:33:52] see he he died for us because he loved
[1:33:55] us not because he loved
[1:33:58] himself but he loved
[1:34:00] us and by doing that he loves himself
[1:34:02] because we're his wife right and that's
[1:34:04] the way we ought to love one another
[1:34:06] listen the Bible tells us be angry and
[1:34:08] sin
[1:34:09] not let not the sun go down upon your
[1:34:12] wrath neither give place to the devil in
[1:34:14] other words don't let don't give the
[1:34:15] devil time to make it worse
[1:34:18] yeah get over it make it right if you
[1:34:21] can't make it right forget about it amen
[1:34:24] right and move
[1:34:25] on Sometimes some things we some knots
[1:34:28] we can't untie but we can move on right
[1:34:31] and not spend the next three weeks
[1:34:33] wasting our time because when we get to
[1:34:35] the end of life we will not you know
[1:34:37] someone said when you get to the end of
[1:34:38] your life on your deathbed you'll never
[1:34:39] be thinking I wish I spent more time at
[1:34:41] the
[1:34:42] office it's also true that you're never
[1:34:44] going to be thinking I wish I spent more
[1:34:47] time arguing with
[1:34:51] people wish I'd spent a little more time
[1:34:53] L and proven I was right I've never seen
[1:34:56] anybody get down to the very end and and
[1:34:59] think like that don't give place to the
[1:35:02] devil don't give him time to make it
[1:35:04] worse deal with it I wonder how many
[1:35:08] times if we get ready to close have we
[1:35:10] been difficult with God we grieve him in
[1:35:13] some way yet the Bible tells us that his
[1:35:16] Mercy is still there for
[1:35:19] us I want to just turn it back now in a
[1:35:22] spiritual sense Jeremiah was called the
[1:35:24] weeping prophet he had seen by Vision
[1:35:27] how Jerusalem would be destroyed because
[1:35:29] of their Twisted ways their frow hearts
[1:35:33] and then watched it happen and so he
[1:35:35] just he just dripping tears I was
[1:35:38] talking about this with with my mother
[1:35:40] and Joel the other night and I was
[1:35:42] talking about Jeremiah and about
[1:35:43] Lamentations Lamentations is a heavy
[1:35:45] book very heavy there's also some great
[1:35:48] hopefulness in it some some great words
[1:35:51] in it it's a very heavy book if you read
[1:35:55] you know just very long in it you get a
[1:35:56] little bit depressed because it was a
[1:35:58] depressing situation he was in a hard in
[1:36:01] a difficult
[1:36:03] situation and uh my mother says her
[1:36:06] favorite book is Jeremiah Jeremiah was
[1:36:08] the weeping prophet but but it's very
[1:36:10] beautiful as well but in Lamentations he
[1:36:13] said this I recall to my mind so he goes
[1:36:15] through all these things that have
[1:36:16] happened in the Ci's broken up and and
[1:36:19] everybody's forsaken them and God's even
[1:36:21] forsaken them or so it seemed
[1:36:24] he said this I recall to my mind
[1:36:25] therefore I have hope it is of the
[1:36:28] Lord's mercies that we're not consumed
[1:36:31] sir because his compassions fail
[1:36:33] not they are new yeah now think about
[1:36:37] what this means every morning the Lord
[1:36:40] gets up and
[1:36:42] decides and we're dramatized obviously
[1:36:44] he doesn't get up in the morning right
[1:36:46] he doesn't go to sleep but but it's as
[1:36:48] if every morning yes sir he decides to
[1:36:51] forgive us
[1:36:54] amen and no matter what we did the day
[1:36:57] before and what happened oh
[1:36:59] Church what happened during the week and
[1:37:01] many times we can't do that for
[1:37:02] ourselves right we get all caught up and
[1:37:04] we get to thinking like well I just I've
[1:37:07] did so many bad things and I just can't
[1:37:09] I can't forgive myself but God every
[1:37:12] morning Jeremiah says today is a new day
[1:37:16] yesterday the walls were broken down
[1:37:18] yesterday everything was going wrong
[1:37:20] yesterday the enemy was coming in
[1:37:21] stealing away my family stealing Ste
[1:37:23] away all the all the gold steal away
[1:37:25] everything else but God told him he said
[1:37:26] go buy land go buy real estate in a down
[1:37:29] Market because in after 70 years the
[1:37:32] houses will be inhabited here again and
[1:37:34] he said Lord your mercies are new every
[1:37:36] morning listen it would help us in
[1:37:38] dealing with difficult people if we
[1:37:40] would let our mercies be
[1:37:42] new every
[1:37:45] day Jesus said it this way sufficient to
[1:37:47] the
[1:37:48] day is the evil thereof what if you just
[1:37:51] woke up tomorrow and decided to forget
[1:37:52] it
[1:37:54] Let It
[1:37:58] Go you'd be like the Lord his mercies
[1:38:02] are
[1:38:02] new every morning and I'm so grateful
[1:38:06] because I make
[1:38:07] mistakes every day I know we all do
[1:38:11] musicians if you'd
[1:38:13] come I like that song My Redeemer is
[1:38:15] faithful and
[1:38:17] true he's faithful every morning his
[1:38:21] mercies are new he forgives
[1:38:24] he forgives I'm so glad that he does say
[1:38:27] Lord help me to yield to your spirit so
[1:38:30] I can forgive like you
[1:38:32] forgive you kids always keep this in
[1:38:35] your heart Lord help me to be
[1:38:37] merciful I going to deal with difficult
[1:38:39] people all my life help me to be
[1:38:41] merciful with difficult people I can I
[1:38:44] can handle that myself and there may be
[1:38:48] a time when I have to take a break and
[1:38:51] and reorient myself and I recognize I'm
[1:38:53] failing in that way but as soon as I can
[1:38:56] let me go back and renew my
[1:38:58] Mercy right give them another
[1:39:01] chance because he did that for
[1:39:03] me I'm a very difficult
[1:39:07] person if you've been around the purs
[1:39:09] around Thanksgiving time you know we are
[1:39:11] a very difficult
[1:39:14] people thanks brother the
[1:39:16] trip he held up his amen sign back there
[1:39:20] he' come over Thanksgiving afternoon I
[1:39:21] don't know why but
[1:39:24] I'm just
[1:39:26] kidding every
[1:39:29] morning every morning you got to wake up
[1:39:32] and pretend it didn't
[1:39:34] happen said that's stupid no it's
[1:39:37] not God does it said to put my sins in
[1:39:42] the sea of his
[1:39:45] forgetfulness and go try
[1:39:48] again when you keep coming back like
[1:39:50] Hosea did for Gomer if you go read the
[1:39:54] book of Hosea and he said that he said I
[1:39:56] want you to marry an Unfaithful woman he
[1:39:58] said cuz that's the kind of woman I
[1:39:59] married Israel unfaithful to me said I
[1:40:03] want you to marry an Unfaithful woman he
[1:40:04] said and then she's going to leave you
[1:40:06] and she's going to she's going to leave
[1:40:07] your children she's going to take the
[1:40:08] children she's going to do all kinds of
[1:40:10] horrible
[1:40:11] things but in the end he said I want you
[1:40:13] to go
[1:40:16] love he didn't say go just take her back
[1:40:19] and treat her harshly but go love
[1:40:22] her have how do you do
[1:40:24] that how's that even possible was the
[1:40:28] spirit of Christ in
[1:40:30] Jose go back to the saave market where
[1:40:33] she was being auctioned off as a
[1:40:37] prostitute say I want you back and I'm
[1:40:40] willing to pay the
[1:40:42] price to have you in my home again to do
[1:40:46] what it takes listen we've been given a
[1:40:49] Ministry of reconciliation not a
[1:40:51] Ministry of offense yes not a Ministry
[1:40:54] of of going out and chewing everybody
[1:40:55] out but a Ministry of reconciliation
[1:40:58] let's live that every morning let our
[1:41:01] mercies be new so that we can deal with
[1:41:05] difficult people starting with
[1:41:07] ourselves have forgiveness for ourselves
[1:41:09] and for others said Lord help me to
[1:41:13] handle the difficult people in my life
[1:41:16] starting with me that be your prayer
[1:41:19] tonight heavenly father I thank you for
[1:41:22] these people Lord It's a
[1:41:23] winter night Lord just a few of us here

[1:41:29] new I'm so thankful for what you've
[1:41:32] given
[1:41:33] us I love you Lord because this Bible
[1:41:36] that you've given us your word doesn't
[1:41:38] just show us the way to the water to be
[1:41:41] baptized but doesn't just show us how to
[1:41:43] make it to an altar and be saved shows
[1:41:46] us how to live tells us how we should
[1:41:49] treat one another I'm so grateful for
[1:41:52] that Lord your Holy Spirit flow through
[1:41:54] our actions overcome our sticky nature
[1:41:57] Lord help us not to be difficult with
[1:41:59] you to be stubborn and religious but
[1:42:02] Lord to be open and forgiving I pray you
[1:42:05] grant it Lord sometimes dealing with
[1:42:08] difficult people is very difficult very
[1:42:10] hard but Lord we know that you've done
[1:42:13] it you've continued to do it and you
[1:42:16] never fail to love us realize that
[1:42:19] family member will always be a family
[1:42:21] member we'll have to deal with them we
[1:42:22] might as well do it in love that person
[1:42:25] who's who's heart against us will always
[1:42:28] be maybe that way maybe that's just the
[1:42:30] way that they are but but they'll but if
[1:42:33] we want to have a relationship with them
[1:42:34] we got to we got to give them a little
[1:42:35] bit of Mercy I pray God that you'd help
[1:42:38] us to do that we most of all want them
[1:42:40] to have a relationship with you and we
[1:42:42] realize many times the way back for them
[1:42:44] to you is through us so we pray that we
[1:42:47] would not be a stumbling block Lord but
[1:42:50] that we'd be a stepping stone Lord that
[1:42:52] they might reach up and see the love of
[1:42:54] Christ in us and see that you are what
[1:42:58] made us that way I pray you to help us
[1:43:00] tonight we love you we thank you for
[1:43:01] these people listen so well Lord and we
[1:43:04] just ask you to come heal every sick
[1:43:05] body touch every heart we pray in Jesus
