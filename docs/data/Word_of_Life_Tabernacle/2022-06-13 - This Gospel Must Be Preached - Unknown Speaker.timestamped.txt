[49:06] matthew 24 and 3.
[49:29] i didn't have it on
[49:31] well praise god
[49:34] and as he sat upon the mount of olives
[49:37] the disciples came unto him privately
[49:39] saying tell us when shall these things
[49:42] be
[49:42] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[49:44] of the end of the world
[49:46] and jesus answered and said unto them
[49:48] take heed that no man deceive you
[49:50] for many shall come in my name saying i
[49:52] am christ and shall deceive many
[49:54] you shall hear of wars and rumors of war
[49:57] see that you be not troubled
[49:59] all these things must come to pass but
[50:01] the end is not yet
[50:03] for nations shall rise against nation
[50:05] and kingdom against kingdom there shall
[50:07] be famines and pestilences and
[50:09] earthquakes and diverse places have we
[50:11] not seen all of that
[50:13] then they shall they deliver you up he
[50:16] said all these are the beginning of
[50:17] sorrows
[50:18] then shall they deliver you up to be
[50:20] afflicted and shall kill you
[50:22] you should be hated of all nations for
[50:24] my name's sake
[50:26] then shall many be offended and shall
[50:28] betray one another and shall hate one
[50:29] another
[50:30] many false prophets shall rise and shall
[50:32] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[50:34] abound
[50:35] the love of many shall wax cold
[50:39] have we seen all of that yes
[50:42] but he that shall endure unto the end
[50:44] the same shall be saved
[50:46] and i want to focus on this verse and
[50:48] this gospel of the kingdom
[50:50] shall be preached in all the world for a
[50:53] witness unto all nations someone say all
[50:57] it says all the world for witness unto
[50:59] all nations
[51:01] and then shall the end
[51:03] come let's bow our heads together for a
[51:04] word of prayer heavenly father we're so
[51:07] grateful to be in your presence here
[51:08] tonight and to thank you for uh lord
[51:11] meeting with us once again as you
[51:13] promised that you would in your word i
[51:15] pray that you would move over this
[51:17] congregation those that have come those
[51:19] lord that are missing tonight are
[51:20] watching the stream i pray that you
[51:23] bless him tonight lord i pray that you
[51:25] just move in a mighty way in our midst
[51:27] lord and and though maybe some of these
[51:29] things would just be maybe mundane or
[51:31] things that we know already but lord i
[51:33] pray that it would just be quick into
[51:35] our hearts and help us to realize that
[51:37] we're a part lord of a great global
[51:40] scheme that you've played out a drama
[51:42] that you played out from the beginning
[51:44] lord and we're just a bit player in that
[51:47] just a part of that just one pebble on
[51:49] the beach but lord we thank you for
[51:51] allowing us to be part of your plan now
[51:53] lord i pray you bless this service help
[51:55] us lord to recognize our place and our
[51:58] position who we are and you lord and
[52:00] then stand in that place and stay in the
[52:02] land of the promises we pray we ask it
[52:05] in jesus name
[52:07] amen god bless you you can be seated
[52:09] this evening
[52:12] are you happy this evening
[52:14] the bible says i was happy when they
[52:16] said unto me let us go into the house of
[52:18] the lord
[52:19] amen so we're glad to be here on
[52:22] on a sunday afternoon
[52:24] some time ago i
[52:26] was talking to one of the missionaries
[52:27] we support robert wilson
[52:29] about the trips he planned to take this
[52:31] year
[52:32] and he had mentioned something about
[52:34] going to egypt and my attention was
[52:37] grabbed and i began to
[52:39] tell him that if he had had a chance
[52:42] to go
[52:43] let me know maybe we could support it in
[52:45] some way
[52:46] i had prayed about taking a trip i have
[52:49] talked to you all about that i try not
[52:51] to take more than one a year because
[52:52] that's and i haven't taken one in two
[52:54] years since we've been here because this
[52:57] is my first love if i could say it that
[52:59] way is here at the church and and i also
[53:01] know that if a pastor's not there the
[53:03] people suffer and
[53:04] uh in the sense that not because you
[53:06] need me necessarily but i'm in my
[53:09] position and and you always do best when
[53:11] you're in your place i want you to be in
[53:13] your place and you want me to be in mine
[53:15] and and my place really is here behind
[53:17] the pulpit and of this church and so i
[53:21] know that that's the place where i ought
[53:22] to be and
[53:24] and yet i feel that we need to do
[53:26] everything we can to make sure that the
[53:28] gospel is preached and we'll get into
[53:30] that and i want to preach to you about
[53:32] that in just a moment
[53:33] but i
[53:34] was talking to him and he began to talk
[53:37] to me about it and i began to be
[53:39] impressed on my heart that maybe i
[53:40] needed to go i didn't know what i was
[53:42] getting myself into
[53:43] i don't know anything about egypt and i
[53:45] think i put the a couple of pictures on
[53:47] there i didn't know anything about egypt
[53:49] to me egypt was this picture
[53:51] uh and so
[53:53] we don't i didn't know anything about
[53:54] the people or anything like that i knew
[53:56] there was one message church there
[53:57] because i talked to a brother that had
[53:58] been once
[54:00] and that's all that i knew
[54:02] and but egypt is more than the pyramids
[54:04] egypt is a lot of people there's a lot
[54:06] of people there
[54:07] and a very few christian people
[54:10] and i guess if we were going to take our
[54:12] time and our money as a church and our
[54:15] finances and put it somewhere
[54:17] we'd want to do it to a place where
[54:18] there wasn't very many other people
[54:20] going because
[54:21] you want the opportunity to preach to
[54:23] new people and not just to change them
[54:25] from one doctrine to another that's
[54:27] never been my desire
[54:29] but to introduce the gospel of jesus
[54:30] christ to the people
[54:32] and also to we believe in this this
[54:35] gospel the message of the hour that we
[54:36] preach and that we teach we want to get
[54:39] that to the people so we don't want to
[54:40] just go
[54:42] where everybody else goes that's why i
[54:43] support brother wilson because he
[54:45] doesn't do that he goes uh
[54:47] to places where no one else goes and i
[54:49] know some of the places he's been and
[54:51] the things that he's been through
[54:53] and i've been there with him i've been
[54:55] there at togo and benin with him
[54:57] and
[54:58] in africa and i know what that's like in
[55:00] west africa but i've never been to egypt
[55:03] and evidently egypt is a very difficult
[55:05] country to get into
[55:07] and so i telling you this because i want
[55:09] your prayers and
[55:11] and would you do that would you pray for
[55:12] us we're going to be leaving on the 27th
[55:15] brother joel is supposed to go with me
[55:17] and you pray for him because he still
[55:19] has his passport appointment and so he
[55:21] doesn't know for sure uh yet until you
[55:24] get the papers in your hand nothing's
[55:25] guaranteed
[55:27] and and even that they just hassle you
[55:29] about everything you know
[55:31] if you've never traveled internationally
[55:32] then you just don't know but when you go
[55:34] to a place like that they they hassle
[55:37] you about everything and and what they
[55:39] do is they make a living off of bribes
[55:41] and things like that and and just
[55:43] getting through security and there's not
[55:45] only security at the airport but at the
[55:47] hotel and at all the tourist sites and
[55:49] everywhere you go and you got to get a
[55:51] give them an itinerary we're going as
[55:52] tourists there is only one message
[55:55] church there that we know of we're not
[55:56] going to preach
[55:58] we're not going to focus on that church
[55:59] we're actually going and holding a
[56:01] convention in alexandria and some other
[56:04] places i can't give you all the details
[56:06] because of the security issues but
[56:08] we're going to be going some other
[56:09] places and even into upper egypt we're
[56:12] going to have the opportunity to preach
[56:13] to
[56:14] quite a few different nominal churches
[56:16] that have invited us to come while we're
[56:18] there and and so i felt like i just i
[56:21] couldn't not do it if you understand it
[56:23] and once having the invitation the
[56:25] opportunity i felt like it was something
[56:27] that i had to do and so you just pray
[56:29] for us one of the things we were
[56:31] concerned about was covid and it's been
[56:33] such a hassle for us to
[56:35] go anywhere overseas because of the
[56:37] covet situation and i was actually the
[56:40] other day at the doctor's office and and
[56:42] i got a news on my phone and it showed
[56:44] up that they've actually dropped the
[56:46] covet requirements to come back to the
[56:48] us
[56:49] so we're going to be leaving on june
[56:50] 27th getting back on july 11th our
[56:52] meetings here
[56:54] start on july 14th so i want to be back
[56:56] for the meetings and it looks like that
[56:58] that's going to be a blessing not that i
[57:00] feel like we'd be positive but you know
[57:02] how those things go
[57:03] you might get a test that wasn't correct
[57:05] or something like that end up being
[57:07] stuck in a foreign country for two weeks
[57:09] and and so that was on my mind in fact i
[57:12] almost canceled the trip over that
[57:13] because i felt like my responsibility
[57:15] was to be here for the meetings but i
[57:17] believe the lord took care of that and
[57:18] if he took care of that one thing he can
[57:20] take care of all these other things that
[57:22] we're concerned about with the trip as
[57:23] well there's just many many things that
[57:26] i've had to be dealing with and it's a
[57:27] very expensive trip
[57:29] but again you know i just don't want to
[57:31] go where everybody else goes i i want to
[57:34] see the gospel spread to places where it
[57:37] hasn't been and
[57:38] believe me there's plenty of people that
[57:40] have not heard and and i could bring out
[57:42] the quotes to you today but brother
[57:44] branham taught us that if if you've ever
[57:46] heard it once
[57:47] he said then you don't have a we don't
[57:50] there's no obligation god doesn't have
[57:51] an obligation to tell you twice
[57:54] right if you've heard it once that's all
[57:56] he has to do
[57:57] and and then so the gospel has to go to
[57:59] others as well jesus said i've got
[58:01] others
[58:02] out of this fold so we know that that's
[58:04] part of our responsibility is to spread
[58:06] the gospel into places where it's not
[58:09] and one of the things we found out is
[58:11] there's very few messages translated
[58:13] into arabic in fact there are no tapes
[58:16] in that language and
[58:18] so we we're having translation work done
[58:20] we're paying to have books printed in
[58:22] egypt and
[58:23] somebody's got to do it and so since
[58:25] we're going we're going to do that and
[58:27] and so
[58:29] i kind of asked myself the question and
[58:31] i want to address that this afternoon
[58:33] why go why bother to go
[58:36] and i think it's because this gospel
[58:39] this gospel must be preached
[58:42] this gospel when i say this gospel i i
[58:45] mean what peter men in second peter
[58:46] chapter 1 and verse 12 where he says he
[58:50] said i want you to be established in the
[58:52] present truth
[58:53] the present truth the light of the hour
[58:56] is this gospel and i believe that only
[58:59] uh in under the the influence of the
[59:01] message of the hour can you preach the
[59:04] gospel in the way that uh in a way that
[59:06] will open people's eyes in the day and
[59:08] hour we live in now we know that
[59:11] many go and preach the gospel but what
[59:13] it does is it actually has a blinding
[59:15] effect which is why there will be no
[59:17] sweeping revival in this nation we know
[59:20] that right there will be no sweeping
[59:22] revival in this nation or the message of
[59:23] the hour because the people have
[59:25] actually been blinded by the preaching
[59:27] of the gospel
[59:29] that was the job of the two
[59:31] uh the two angels that went
[59:33] into sodom they went there and blinded
[59:35] the eyes of the people and brother
[59:36] branham liking that ministries like
[59:38] billy graham and oral roberts that they
[59:40] would actually blind the eyes of the
[59:42] people but that's not my job it's to
[59:44] blind the eyes but my job is to repeat a
[59:46] voice set
[59:47] that we've heard in our day how many
[59:49] know we've heard a voice in our day
[59:51] and that voice come from the throne of
[59:53] god and and my job is to repeat that
[59:56] and to open the eyes of the people not
[59:58] to blind them so we're not going to the
[1:00:01] sodomites we're going to the elect
[1:00:03] right we're going to the elect but to do
[1:00:05] that you've got to throw a net out
[1:00:07] you've got to you've got to preach the
[1:00:08] gospel now
[1:00:10] paul calls it my gospel in romans 16 25
[1:00:13] he said now to him that is the power to
[1:00:15] establish you according to my gospel
[1:00:17] what what was he saying it was something
[1:00:19] different than what john the baptist had
[1:00:21] preached or even what jesus had preached
[1:00:23] it was the present truth
[1:00:25] he said and the preaching of jesus
[1:00:27] christ according to the revelation of
[1:00:28] the mystery which was kept secret since
[1:00:30] the world began but now is made manifest
[1:00:33] and by the scriptures of the prophets
[1:00:34] according to the commandment of the
[1:00:36] everlasting god made known to someone
[1:00:39] say all
[1:00:40] all nations for the obedience of faith
[1:00:43] so everyone has an opportunity
[1:00:46] brother branham was talking with a a man
[1:00:49] who was actually a great missionary
[1:00:50] himself by the name of e stanley jones
[1:00:52] one of the
[1:00:53] preeminent missionaries of the 20th
[1:00:55] century
[1:00:56] he said he was having dinner with him
[1:00:58] and he said brother branham he said i
[1:01:00] see most of your meeting it's made up of
[1:01:01] pentecostal people
[1:01:03] he said yes sir he said why so i said
[1:01:06] they're the ones that believe
[1:01:08] and he said well he said brother branham
[1:01:10] i think pentecost was a scaffold he said
[1:01:12] that god was going to put up a building
[1:01:14] and made pentecost a scaffold i said
[1:01:16] that's right i'll agree with you he said
[1:01:18] well see after the scaffold works done
[1:01:20] we don't need the scaffold anymore i
[1:01:22] said but the scaffold work isn't done
[1:01:25] we realize that today the work isn't
[1:01:26] done
[1:01:27] and listen to brother branham's
[1:01:29] reasoning on this he said when the
[1:01:30] building's completed god will take it up
[1:01:33] right
[1:01:34] amen people say well we don't need
[1:01:35] preachers no more we don't need
[1:01:37] missionaries no more why go why bother
[1:01:39] why spend your money and your time and
[1:01:42] and give your life to the preaching of
[1:01:43] the gospel because the scaffold work
[1:01:45] isn't done yet
[1:01:47] and until it's done we still need to
[1:01:49] build churches we still need to we still
[1:01:51] need to have church we still need to do
[1:01:53] the things that we do but most of all we
[1:01:54] need to preach the gospel
[1:01:57] right right
[1:01:59] we still need to preach the gospel
[1:02:01] because we're not preaching the gospel
[1:02:02] to promote this church
[1:02:05] this is not our gospel here at this
[1:02:06] church this is the gospel this is the
[1:02:08] word of the hour
[1:02:10] and it's not a one-man ministry anymore
[1:02:12] it's it's a it's a mini-membered body
[1:02:14] that come that comes under the headship
[1:02:16] of a one-man ministry
[1:02:18] right but the scaffold work isn't done
[1:02:20] he said we still need every step ladder
[1:02:24] he said every stepping stone
[1:02:26] right we need everything just exactly
[1:02:28] the building is still in making
[1:02:30] amen and when it's completed he said
[1:02:33] this gospel is preached to every kindred
[1:02:35] tongue and nation then jesus will return
[1:02:39] so i think if there's not books in
[1:02:41] arabic we need to print books in arabic
[1:02:44] if if there's not if there's not in in a
[1:02:46] tongue you say well some of them people
[1:02:47] understand english yes they do but if
[1:02:49] there's one nation or tongue that has
[1:02:52] not been put in then we need to do that
[1:02:54] but not just print the books we need to
[1:02:55] preach
[1:02:58] right because the gospel preached is a
[1:03:00] powerful thing the preached gospel is
[1:03:02] what separates the
[1:03:04] shaft from the weed it's what is what
[1:03:06] convicts the sinner of sin it's what
[1:03:08] brings people to god amen that's why we
[1:03:11] still believe in preaching around here
[1:03:12] amen
[1:03:14] now he said he said we've had plenty of
[1:03:16] passing out tracks and theology around
[1:03:18] the world but the gospel is not the
[1:03:20] bible altogether he said paul said the
[1:03:23] gospel came to us not in word only but
[1:03:25] through power and demonstrations of the
[1:03:27] holy ghost
[1:03:28] then when jesus said go into all the
[1:03:30] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:03:31] creature he meant go into all the world
[1:03:34] and demonstrate the power of god to
[1:03:36] every creature
[1:03:37] let me tell you what part of that is
[1:03:40] part of that and let me just let you in
[1:03:42] on a little bit of missionary work
[1:03:44] part of going is just you being there
[1:03:47] and putting up with the hassle
[1:03:50] of going
[1:03:52] and going through the hassle of
[1:03:54] being in the in the motel and being in
[1:03:57] an unfamiliar place and being far from
[1:03:59] home and spending your money and not
[1:04:01] getting paid to do it you don't get paid
[1:04:03] to do those trips you go over there
[1:04:05] you're paying your own way you're doing
[1:04:06] all of those things you begin to
[1:04:08] but just going through that you're
[1:04:10] showing something to those people
[1:04:12] they're learning that you love them
[1:04:15] right you're expressing something to
[1:04:17] them so the gospel is not just to preach
[1:04:20] not just to use words but to actually be
[1:04:22] there
[1:04:23] because when you're there you can pray
[1:04:25] for the sick and they can be healed when
[1:04:27] you're there you can take up serpents
[1:04:28] and it won't harm them they see you
[1:04:30] going and putting up with those things
[1:04:32] and giving your life for that and it
[1:04:34] represents something to them it
[1:04:35] represents christ
[1:04:38] amen that's why we still need to go to
[1:04:39] church by the way
[1:04:41] it's not it virtual church will never
[1:04:43] take over
[1:04:46] it is not it is not a substitute for
[1:04:49] being in the house of god it's good that
[1:04:50] we have it i'm glad we have it but it's
[1:04:52] not a substitute for being in the house
[1:04:54] of god because i need to see your face
[1:04:57] and you need to see mine and our spirits
[1:04:59] need to fellowship with one another
[1:05:01] as long as we're able amen there may
[1:05:04] come a day where we we're not able we
[1:05:05] saw that in covent there was a time when
[1:05:07] we were not able to gather together but
[1:05:09] as long as we're able to gather together
[1:05:11] we need to do it
[1:05:13] because there's something about being
[1:05:15] there you can demonstrate it not just
[1:05:17] preach it
[1:05:19] he said you've got to in order to preach
[1:05:21] the gospel he said before
[1:05:23] you can make it a gospel preach you've
[1:05:25] got to have the power and demonstration
[1:05:26] of the holy spirit to prove the gospel
[1:05:28] the letter killeth he said the letter
[1:05:30] killeth the spirit maketh a lie so it's
[1:05:32] not just a ritualistic affair but it's
[1:05:34] absolutely a real living reality of the
[1:05:36] resurrection of jesus christ living
[1:05:38] among men he said that's the faith i'm
[1:05:40] trying my best to contend for today that
[1:05:43] jesus christ is the same
[1:05:45] yesterday today and forever how many
[1:05:46] believe that he said and his power is
[1:05:49] unlimited
[1:05:50] and i love this he said if you can limit
[1:05:52] god
[1:05:53] you can limit christ yes
[1:05:55] think about it if you can limit god you
[1:05:57] can limit christ he said and if you
[1:05:59] limit the church today in its
[1:06:02] possibilities
[1:06:03] you're limiting god
[1:06:06] and we need to be careful about what
[1:06:07] satan does he'll try to come to and say
[1:06:09] well you're not a big enough church you
[1:06:11] don't have a good enough ministry you
[1:06:12] don't have a you're not widely known
[1:06:14] don't limit what the church can
[1:06:16] do right don't limit well let's leave
[1:06:19] that up to somebody else don't limit the
[1:06:21] chart what the church can do no limit
[1:06:23] the possibilities of the church don't
[1:06:24] say well we don't need preachers no more
[1:06:26] we don't need evangelists we don't need
[1:06:27] missionaries but he said if you limit
[1:06:29] the church in his possibilities you're
[1:06:31] limiting god he said but all things
[1:06:33] whatsoever you desire when you pray
[1:06:35] believes you receive it you shall have
[1:06:37] it how many believe that today
[1:06:38] he said that he said i believe it and i
[1:06:40] know it's the truth
[1:06:42] brother branham makes a statement
[1:06:44] and he's talking here about the magi
[1:06:46] because he said they in one place he
[1:06:48] says they come from three different
[1:06:49] nations
[1:06:50] he said they represented ham shem and
[1:06:52] jfest people
[1:06:53] he said they come together from the east
[1:06:56] and here they come and he says this he
[1:06:58] said
[1:06:59] jesus said when this gospel is preached
[1:07:01] ham shem and japheth's people and the
[1:07:03] end shall come and that's africa asia
[1:07:05] and europe
[1:07:06] again he said jesus said when this
[1:07:08] gospel is preached
[1:07:10] this gospel is preached to all the world
[1:07:11] for a witness unto me then the end shall
[1:07:13] be he said then if what he was talking
[1:07:16] about was spreading out literature
[1:07:17] sending out missionaries he said well
[1:07:18] they have the internet well that's not
[1:07:20] what he's talking about
[1:07:21] sending out missionaries with reading
[1:07:23] writing and arithmetic passing out
[1:07:25] tracts and making people shake hands and
[1:07:26] believe that there is a god if that's
[1:07:28] all it was then he's far past his coming
[1:07:31] he said it shows the gospel paul said
[1:07:33] the gospel didn't come in the word only
[1:07:34] but through power and manifestations of
[1:07:36] the holy ghost
[1:07:37] then when jesus said go into all the
[1:07:39] world and preach the gospel he said go
[1:07:41] into all the world and demonstrate he
[1:07:42] said i like that demonstrate the power
[1:07:44] of the gospel taking the word that what
[1:07:46] it says and show the people what it says
[1:07:50] amen that's what we're doing tonight
[1:07:52] show the people what it says and then
[1:07:53] make it manifest to them he said that's
[1:07:55] the way yes
[1:07:57] that proves it well i love it it's one
[1:08:00] thing to say it but then you got to
[1:08:02] prove it
[1:08:03] right just like your kids if you tell
[1:08:04] your kids so i love you but you got to
[1:08:06] prove it right
[1:08:08] right they're not going to believe it
[1:08:10] you got to say if you say i'm a message
[1:08:12] believer live the life
[1:08:14] if you live the life that's going to
[1:08:16] prove to the people
[1:08:17] and it won't be like we were talking
[1:08:18] about earlier with alan where where
[1:08:20] someone hears you from the message and
[1:08:21] they shy away from it because of some
[1:08:23] life that somebody's lived that's been
[1:08:24] crazy but it'll be a real genuine
[1:08:27] article
[1:08:28] i've told you the story about brother
[1:08:29] daniel embarrass him tonight but i was
[1:08:31] getting my car towed from my house one
[1:08:33] day and i and i mentioned brother danny
[1:08:37] or i mentioned the church he asked me i
[1:08:38] told him i was a pastor he said what
[1:08:40] church you pastor i told him what church
[1:08:42] i didn't mean nothing to him but i told
[1:08:44] him i said well brother danny ward goes
[1:08:45] there and he said oh i said i know danny
[1:08:47] he said there's no better man he went on
[1:08:49] and on about how good of a man danny was
[1:08:51] see danny demonstrated the gospel
[1:08:54] right it wasn't just just being there
[1:08:56] but demonstrating the gospel not just
[1:08:58] saying word of life tabernacle but
[1:09:00] becoming the word of life to the people
[1:09:03] amen you understand that tonight you're
[1:09:06] written epistles read of all men
[1:09:09] i'm not gonna hold you much longer i
[1:09:10] know you're tired
[1:09:12] i'm surprised everybody's not asleep by
[1:09:14] now
[1:09:18] jeremy's still awake on the front row
[1:09:21] i know he's got to write and take notes
[1:09:22] to stay awake too so
[1:09:27] brother branham said now
[1:09:30] he talks about uh
[1:09:33] paris read head and talks about
[1:09:36] if you remember he was a great
[1:09:36] missionary as well head of sedan
[1:09:38] missions he come to brother branham and
[1:09:40] he went all over the world spreading
[1:09:42] giving tracks out and books and things
[1:09:44] and he said but he said that we met the
[1:09:47] challenge of that muslim religion and
[1:09:49] they were he was unable to meet that
[1:09:50] challenge he come to brother branham he
[1:09:52] said i'm missing something something
[1:09:54] missing brother branham led him to the
[1:09:55] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:09:57] and become a great missionary after that
[1:09:59] much greater than he was before
[1:10:01] and as far as what he knew
[1:10:04] and brother branham says this and he
[1:10:05] talks about how that
[1:10:07] you were marked with the ear in the year
[1:10:09] of jubilee you all remember the story
[1:10:11] how that god how that the slave was
[1:10:13] marked through the ear if he refused to
[1:10:16] hear the call he talked about how god
[1:10:18] marks his and satan marks his he said
[1:10:20] god marks his by vindicating his
[1:10:22] promised word through them
[1:10:26] god marks his children that's how you
[1:10:28] know who you are
[1:10:30] by vindicating his promised word through
[1:10:33] them
[1:10:34] he said and he said saint john 14 12 and
[1:10:36] mark 16 jesus said these signs shall
[1:10:39] follow them that believe
[1:10:41] and brother brown gets very straight
[1:10:42] here he said now let's just take that a
[1:10:43] minute was he joking
[1:10:45] and i'd like for us to respond to that
[1:10:47] this morning was he joking
[1:10:50] did he just mean the apostles as some
[1:10:52] would tell us
[1:10:53] he said watch he said read the
[1:10:55] background go you where he said all the
[1:10:57] world preach the gospel to what every
[1:11:00] creature
[1:11:01] and brother branham said it has not even
[1:11:03] one third of the way met it yet
[1:11:06] he said these signs shall follow in all
[1:11:07] the world every creature wherever this
[1:11:10] gospel is preached these signs shall
[1:11:12] follow them that believe and that's the
[1:11:14] promise that we have we can't make it
[1:11:16] happen but he said it would follow yes
[1:11:19] right and we can't produce it but he
[1:11:20] said it would follow
[1:11:22] he said now listen he gets very straight
[1:11:24] he said notice he said not to just one
[1:11:26] little handful notice all the world
[1:11:29] every creature these signs shall follow
[1:11:30] he said don't take satan's unbelieving
[1:11:33] mark
[1:11:34] he said he'll put it on you tonight if
[1:11:36] he can do it he'll poke you up against
[1:11:38] the wall he said you'd walk out and say
[1:11:40] i don't know about that he said you go
[1:11:42] home and study it be sincere and pray he
[1:11:46] said because everything is too perfectly
[1:11:47] scriptural at this very hour this sacred
[1:11:50] hour in time or if we can only see what
[1:11:52] hour we live in today he said it's done
[1:11:54] been for years proved come right up to
[1:11:56] it and this is the hour this is the time
[1:12:00] amen what is it this gospel has to be
[1:12:02] preached
[1:12:04] now he said i can show you in the bible
[1:12:06] where god gave his church the authority
[1:12:08] by using his name by faith to cast out
[1:12:10] evil spirits to heal the sick and to do
[1:12:13] great signs and wonders i can show you
[1:12:15] where it was given to the church but
[1:12:17] there's no record in bible nowhere where
[1:12:19] he ever took that power away from the
[1:12:21] church
[1:12:22] or said he would take it away from the
[1:12:24] church
[1:12:25] but this gospel i love this of this same
[1:12:28] deliverance yes how many believe we have
[1:12:31] the same deliverance that they did
[1:12:33] this gospel of this same deliverance was
[1:12:35] to be preached to all nations beginning
[1:12:37] at jerusalem and we was to be witnesses
[1:12:40] of him in jerusalem judea samaria to the
[1:12:42] uttermost parts of the earth to this
[1:12:44] gospel and these signs
[1:12:46] was to follow the believer until he
[1:12:48] comes again go you into all the world
[1:12:51] amen and brother branham explain that
[1:12:52] how that it went from the uh from the
[1:12:55] gospel came from the east and went all
[1:12:57] the way west he said and then it goes
[1:12:59] back again to the east
[1:13:01] that's where we're working today that's
[1:13:02] where the focus of the message the hour
[1:13:04] is today is on the eastern people
[1:13:06] because it's the last group that haven't
[1:13:08] been reached yet
[1:13:10] there's people have to hear whether they
[1:13:12] turn it down or whether they accept it
[1:13:13] they have to hear
[1:13:15] now look he said
[1:13:17] go into all the world just only one
[1:13:18] third of it knows about jesus now after
[1:13:20] 1900 years and all the world preached
[1:13:21] the gospel he said no the gospel is not
[1:13:23] the word only but making the word
[1:13:25] manifest paul says so gospel came not on
[1:13:28] word only but through the power and
[1:13:29] manifestation of the holy spirit is the
[1:13:31] gospel must be preached to every nation
[1:13:33] these signs shall follow them to believe
[1:13:35] he said we just can't cut that out
[1:13:38] we've got to face it
[1:13:42] he said brother ben wouldn't that be
[1:13:44] scary to go into a place like that and
[1:13:47] in a way yes but we've got to face that
[1:13:50] god said he would do it yeah at some
[1:13:52] point we have to do that and you know
[1:13:54] and in science and technology and i'm
[1:13:56] glad we live where we do trust me i'm
[1:13:57] happy for this country i'm happy to be
[1:13:59] here
[1:14:00] you're never happier to be here than if
[1:14:02] you come back from another place
[1:14:05] and realize how blessed we are as a
[1:14:06] nation
[1:14:08] and yet we ca we've got to face it at
[1:14:10] some point you know in this nation we we
[1:14:12] put everything off where we don't really
[1:14:13] have to face anything because there's
[1:14:15] always a doctor there's always money
[1:14:17] there's always something that'll take
[1:14:18] care to get us out of our problem but
[1:14:20] i've noticed in places where they just
[1:14:22] have to face up to and say lord i'm
[1:14:23] gonna die unless you help me i found
[1:14:26] when people have to face it god answers
[1:14:28] yes
[1:14:29] and sometimes you just have to face it
[1:14:31] he said we can't just cut it out
[1:14:33] we've got to face it god still heals the
[1:14:35] fit
[1:14:36] we've got to face that right if you get
[1:14:38] to a place where the doctor can't do you
[1:14:39] any more good you'll have to face that
[1:14:42] god still heals the sick
[1:14:43] god still raises the dead god still god
[1:14:46] still saves our children do we believe
[1:14:48] that we're getting to a place church the
[1:14:50] world is getting bad enough that we've
[1:14:52] got to get to a place where we still
[1:14:54] face that yes
[1:14:56] say i believe god still does it and be
[1:14:59] like those three who were children who
[1:15:00] stood there and said it doesn't matter
[1:15:02] that he's able to deliver us but even if
[1:15:03] he doesn't
[1:15:05] we won't bow to your idol right
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:09] see god chose to use preaching to save
[1:15:11] the lost first corinthians 1 18 says the
[1:15:13] preaching of the cross is to them that
[1:15:14] perish foolishness but unto us which are
[1:15:17] saved it is the power of god i wonder if
[1:15:19] some people are saved
[1:15:23] we don't want to hear preaching i wonder
[1:15:25] if we're saved
[1:15:26] because he said unto us which are saved
[1:15:28] it's the power of god
[1:15:30] it is written i will destroy the wisdom
[1:15:32] of the wise will bring to nothing the
[1:15:34] understanding of the prudence where is
[1:15:36] the wise where is the scribe where is
[1:15:37] the disputer of this world i thought god
[1:15:39] made foolish the wisdom of this world he
[1:15:42] said for after that in the wisdom of god
[1:15:44] the world by wisdom knew not god it
[1:15:46] pleased god
[1:15:47] by the foolishness of preaching
[1:15:50] to save them that belief
[1:15:52] and he doesn't say foolish preaching
[1:15:54] because preaching should not be foolish
[1:15:57] but he said the foolishness of preaching
[1:15:59] in other words the manner and the
[1:16:00] actions of preaching and the way that
[1:16:02] it's done is foolishness to the world he
[1:16:04] said the jews require a sign and the
[1:16:06] greeks seek after wisdom but we preach
[1:16:08] christ crucified unto the jews of
[1:16:11] stumbling block unto the greeks
[1:16:12] foolishness but unto them which are
[1:16:14] called both jews and greeks christ the
[1:16:15] power of god and the wisdom of god
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:20] you see we are the voice of many waters
[1:16:24] we are the voice of many waters
[1:16:27] and and by extension you know this
[1:16:28] church you support ministry and so you
[1:16:31] support the voice of many waters you
[1:16:34] have a a stake in that voice
[1:16:37] because the voice of many waters is the
[1:16:39] gospel ministry
[1:16:41] and psalms 29 and 3 it says the voice of
[1:16:44] the lord is upon the waters
[1:16:46] it's the multitudes of people the god of
[1:16:48] glory thundereth
[1:16:49] the lord is upon many waters
[1:16:52] revelation 1 and 12 says i turned to see
[1:16:54] the voices spake with me
[1:16:56] notice a voice spoke with john
[1:16:58] being turned i saw seven golden
[1:16:59] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:17:01] seven candlesticks one likened to the
[1:17:02] son of man called with the garment down
[1:17:04] to the foot gerd about the patch with a
[1:17:06] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[1:17:07] were white like wool as white as snow
[1:17:09] his eyes were as a flame of fire his
[1:17:11] feet like undefined brass as if they
[1:17:13] burned in a furnace and his voice as the
[1:17:16] sound
[1:17:17] of many waters
[1:17:19] now watch he heard a voice speaking but
[1:17:21] now he hears a voice as the sound of
[1:17:23] many waters
[1:17:24] brother branham explains that he said
[1:17:26] all right voice what a horrible thing
[1:17:28] for a drifting soul in the sea of life
[1:17:30] no pilate to guide him loose floating
[1:17:32] with the tithes to hear the roar of the
[1:17:35] great cataracts the false
[1:17:37] what a horrible thing it would be to a
[1:17:39] soul drifting that's why people don't
[1:17:41] like preaching because the soul is
[1:17:43] drifting
[1:17:45] he said what a horrible thing it would
[1:17:46] be to a soul drifting a voice of many
[1:17:48] waters
[1:17:49] what is his voice
[1:17:51] it's the judgment
[1:17:52] the voice of the ministers through the
[1:17:54] holy spirit that's cried out to the
[1:17:57] people in every age standing there the
[1:17:59] voice of many waters cried out thickness
[1:18:02] and multitudes the voice of those seven
[1:18:04] stars in his hand to every church age
[1:18:07] now notice the voice of many waters many
[1:18:09] waters was also the voice of the seven
[1:18:11] stars because these are the men who were
[1:18:13] faithfully taught
[1:18:14] and under our messenger brother branham
[1:18:16] said we become the final voice to the
[1:18:18] final age right
[1:18:20] so now he says the voice of those seven
[1:18:22] stars to every church age preaching
[1:18:24] notice what they preach the baptism of
[1:18:26] the holy ghost do we still preach that
[1:18:27] today
[1:18:28] hey man go
[1:18:30] push through your tiredness now and say
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] we still preach it today
[1:18:34] the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:18:35] baptism in jesus name
[1:18:37] speaking in tongues amen the power of
[1:18:40] god the resurrection of christ the
[1:18:42] second coming divine judgment the voice
[1:18:44] of many waters came forth from this one
[1:18:47] that looked like the son of man many
[1:18:49] waters yes
[1:18:50] amen
[1:18:52] many waters notice mark 16 says go into
[1:18:55] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:18:57] every creature
[1:18:58] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:19:00] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:19:01] be damned and these signs shall follow
[1:19:03] them that believe in my name they shall
[1:19:06] cast out devils they shall speak with
[1:19:07] new tongues they shall take up serpents
[1:19:09] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:19:11] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:19:12] the sick and they shall recover who's he
[1:19:14] talking to the voice of many waters
[1:19:17] this voice of many waters was going to
[1:19:19] go and was going to be felt and was
[1:19:21] going to be heard in the quietest places
[1:19:23] in every corner of the earth
[1:19:26] and you know where can your voice be
[1:19:28] heard the loudest
[1:19:30] well there's few other voices
[1:19:33] i think of brother hildebrand that went
[1:19:35] to africa
[1:19:36] many times when he was younger and i
[1:19:38] didn't know where the hillary personally
[1:19:40] but when i went to africa i met people
[1:19:42] who he had ministered to decades before
[1:19:45] and said because brother hildebrandt
[1:19:46] went that's why we have a church that's
[1:19:48] why we believe
[1:19:49] and and my hat's off to him today as he
[1:19:51] just passed away he's gone on to his
[1:19:53] reward thinker brother biscuit who i
[1:19:55] heard went some 169 times in 50 years
[1:19:59] left his church and went overseas and i
[1:20:01] don't plan on doing that by the way i'm
[1:20:02] not brother biscuit i don't have that
[1:20:04] kind of ministry but i think a brother
[1:20:06] perry green that went around the world
[1:20:07] many times to hundreds of nations it was
[1:20:09] a personal friend of mine i seen brother
[1:20:11] wilson going for three or more trips a
[1:20:13] year for nearly 30 years but those men
[1:20:16] are getting older and somebody's got to
[1:20:18] be a voice
[1:20:19] and somebody's got to support that voice
[1:20:21] and keep it strong
[1:20:23] somebody's got to do it might as well be
[1:20:25] us
[1:20:27] huh
[1:20:28] say well we can't well don't limit the
[1:20:29] church yeah sure in its possibilities
[1:20:34] right what you believe you can be is
[1:20:35] what you're going to be
[1:20:37] yeah i see this church full one day not
[1:20:40] from other churches coming but but from
[1:20:42] people that have been born again yeah
[1:20:45] now it may it may never get to that
[1:20:47] place but indulge me in my in my folly
[1:20:49] if you would i don't i don't want to see
[1:20:51] just one or two people i want to see it
[1:20:53] fall if it never gets to that i'm not
[1:20:55] going to leave because there's few
[1:20:56] people but i believe god's got people
[1:20:58] yeah or there still wouldn't be a church
[1:21:00] here right there's a reason why we're
[1:21:02] still here
[1:21:03] there's a reason why he called me to
[1:21:05] preach
[1:21:06] there's a reason why he called you to
[1:21:08] come to the house of god and support the
[1:21:10] word there's a reason for it and so if
[1:21:13] he called us to be here then let's have
[1:21:14] a big enough vision that we can see it
[1:21:16] we can look in the future when you see
[1:21:18] god you're doing something
[1:21:19] and then if he comes and takes us out of
[1:21:21] here we'll be ready to go because we're
[1:21:23] preaching a message amen that makes us
[1:21:26] ready hey man but we're not it's not
[1:21:28] just us for no more let's get everyone
[1:21:30] that we can take with us if we really
[1:21:32] believe that we're going to walk on
[1:21:34] streets of gold if we really believe
[1:21:35] that we're going to be in a body that's
[1:21:37] perfect that that we never have to worry
[1:21:39] about no more if we believe like i
[1:21:40] preached last sunday night we're going
[1:21:42] to be sitting at that table thousands of
[1:21:44] miles long and the son of man himself is
[1:21:46] going to come down and wipe the tears
[1:21:48] away from our eyes if we really believe
[1:21:50] that why wouldn't we want everybody to
[1:21:52] go and sit at that table with us
[1:21:56] why wouldn't we i wonder sometimes how
[1:21:58] much we really believe it
[1:22:02] if we really believe it why wouldn't we
[1:22:03] want to live every day of our life say
[1:22:05] lord help me be a light
[1:22:07] if i get an opportunity to be a witness
[1:22:09] let me be that witness
[1:22:11] i think that's what those brothers that
[1:22:12] i mentioned have done
[1:22:14] somebody's got to do it today
[1:22:17] somebody's got to keep it up
[1:22:19] in revelation 19 5 a voice come out of
[1:22:22] the throne
[1:22:23] and said praise our god all ye his
[1:22:24] servants
[1:22:26] ye that fear him both small and great
[1:22:28] one voice yes
[1:22:30] from the throne
[1:22:31] our message didn't come from indiana it
[1:22:34] didn't come from from tucson it didn't
[1:22:36] come from hardy arkansas
[1:22:38] come from the throne
[1:22:40] a voice came out of the throne
[1:22:43] saying praise our god all ye his
[1:22:44] servants you that fear him both small
[1:22:46] and great
[1:22:47] one voice
[1:22:49] verse 6 said then i heard as it were the
[1:22:52] voice of a great multitude
[1:22:54] as the voice of many waters
[1:22:56] as the voice of mighty thundering saying
[1:22:58] alleluia for the lord god omnipotent
[1:23:01] reigneth many voices what are the many
[1:23:03] voices saying verse 7 let us be glad and
[1:23:06] rejoice
[1:23:07] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:23:09] the lamb has come and his wife hath made
[1:23:11] herself ready what was it the many
[1:23:13] voices echoing what the one voice has
[1:23:15] said
[1:23:17] and they echo and what are they saying
[1:23:18] make yourself ready
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:22] that's my job
[1:23:24] but it's also your job
[1:23:26] because i can't do it without you
[1:23:28] and those that are watching and those
[1:23:30] from our local congregation that are
[1:23:32] that are here you support me and and and
[1:23:34] i'm able to do this because of you and
[1:23:36] i'm so grateful the lord just worked it
[1:23:38] out because we could never normally take
[1:23:40] a trip like this but the lord's just
[1:23:42] worked it out where we could not because
[1:23:44] we have wealthy people in the church but
[1:23:45] because god just saw fit that we would
[1:23:48] have just enough to be able to go and
[1:23:50] it's a very expensive trip but god knows
[1:23:52] what we need
[1:23:54] and i don't always know what's going to
[1:23:55] be in the future i don't know i may
[1:23:56] never go on another trip again i don't
[1:23:58] know i mean i go on this trip
[1:24:00] we don't know
[1:24:01] but i know this
[1:24:03] if i have the opportunity to go and he
[1:24:05] provides me the means to go
[1:24:07] and gives me a desire to go i want to go
[1:24:10] yeah
[1:24:11] i want to go
[1:24:13] because there might be somebody
[1:24:15] and i don't care what church they end up
[1:24:16] in
[1:24:17] but there might be somebody who i could
[1:24:19] be the voice of many waters too just one
[1:24:21] voice out of many
[1:24:23] that would sit there at that table
[1:24:25] let me be one who's not afraid to go
[1:24:28] i think we could all say that tonight i
[1:24:30] know this is focused more on ministry i
[1:24:32] think we could all say that let me be
[1:24:33] one who's not afraid to go yeah let me
[1:24:35] be one who really cares about this
[1:24:36] message
[1:24:38] one of the things that we've lost over
[1:24:39] the years i think
[1:24:41] is and there was
[1:24:42] much if i could explain it
[1:24:45] you know years ago it seemed like in the
[1:24:47] message we really cared about the
[1:24:48] message but sometimes we cared about the
[1:24:50] wrong things
[1:24:52] we cared about dates and places and
[1:24:54] things were places where brother branham
[1:24:56] had been and all those things were good
[1:24:57] but but we cared more about that in a
[1:24:59] prophet's life and then later on we
[1:25:01] realized it wasn't that it was the word
[1:25:03] yeah
[1:25:04] it was the word but i i'd like to see
[1:25:06] that same level of care towards the word
[1:25:10] not towards the places or or the people
[1:25:12] or or the family name but but but to
[1:25:15] bring people to the word
[1:25:17] to bring people under the message of the
[1:25:19] hour we cared about those things because
[1:25:21] we believe that god sent a prophet
[1:25:23] but god sent a prophet with a voice
[1:25:26] he had something to say what did he say
[1:25:29] hey man he said come out of her my
[1:25:30] people what are we going to repeat come
[1:25:33] out of her my people
[1:25:34] with the opportunity when we go
[1:25:36] we've had
[1:25:38] several probably eight or nine churches
[1:25:40] uh nominal churches that have asked us
[1:25:41] to come and preach i'd never have that
[1:25:43] opportunity here in the u.s
[1:25:45] i'm gonna go
[1:25:46] lord will and if he allows me to go
[1:25:48] we're gonna go and preach to those
[1:25:49] people like i said it's a country where
[1:25:51] you could get stopped on the way you
[1:25:52] might get stopped at a checkpoint never
[1:25:54] be able to go but i believe if god's
[1:25:56] helped us this far he'll help us get to
[1:25:58] the places where we need to be and talk
[1:25:59] to the people we need to talk to
[1:26:02] why don't you just make that your prayer
[1:26:03] tonight because
[1:26:04] you know you you talk to people too and
[1:26:08] i know some of you have expressed to me
[1:26:09] and said brother ben how can i talk to
[1:26:11] somebody i said just be there for them
[1:26:13] and sometimes i just have to be there
[1:26:15] sometimes you just have to go and be
[1:26:17] there
[1:26:18] and god will give you the words to say
[1:26:20] don't think so much about what you're
[1:26:21] going to say as just being there at the
[1:26:24] right time god will give you the words
[1:26:26] to say
[1:26:27] you see you want something to be
[1:26:28] associated of value with your life right
[1:26:31] what's it going to be worth when you get
[1:26:32] home what are you going to leave behind
[1:26:34] i could leave a bigger house
[1:26:36] i could i could drive a nicer car i
[1:26:38] could do that right now i could go take
[1:26:40] the money and spend it on a nicer car
[1:26:42] but i wanted something of value
[1:26:45] i want something that'll last
[1:26:49] we could spend a lot of money and go on
[1:26:51] big vacations and we vacationed in the
[1:26:52] past and you all have been good to us
[1:26:55] and when i worked i i took my family on
[1:26:57] vacation i'm not speaking against that
[1:26:58] but we can do a lot of things but i want
[1:27:00] to do something if i'm going to spend
[1:27:02] money you know the way inflation's going
[1:27:04] up money don't mean anything anyway
[1:27:06] but if we're going to spend money let's
[1:27:08] spend on something good
[1:27:10] you say well you know gas money's
[1:27:11] getting the place gas price getting
[1:27:12] places we can't come to church no more
[1:27:14] because it's too expensive i tell you
[1:27:15] what if i was going to cut something out
[1:27:17] it wouldn't be church
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:20] because it's the only thing of value
[1:27:21] that i've got
[1:27:23] see brother brandon said nothing but
[1:27:25] lost souls is the only thing that's got
[1:27:27] any value in it
[1:27:29] money passes away
[1:27:31] homes decay and go away
[1:27:34] everything in the earth moves
[1:27:37] away
[1:27:38] he said the only value lasting value he
[1:27:41] said i'd rather have one soul in glory
[1:27:43] than i won to christ
[1:27:45] to know and see
[1:27:46] think about this for a moment as we
[1:27:48] close the musicians come
[1:27:50] he said to know and see that the light
[1:27:52] of god circles around
[1:27:54] that soul
[1:27:55] through all eternity
[1:27:57] my name to be associated with that
[1:28:02] think about that
[1:28:04] because
[1:28:05] amen because i supported the ministry or
[1:28:08] i preached the gospel or or i was part
[1:28:11] of it in some way he didn't say you had
[1:28:12] to be the one who went
[1:28:14] he said but if you can't go send
[1:28:15] somebody
[1:28:16] and you all have done that faithfully
[1:28:18] i'm not asking for your money tonight
[1:28:20] it's just what you've done that
[1:28:22] to know and see that that light of god
[1:28:24] circles around that soul through all
[1:28:26] eternity he said my name to be
[1:28:28] associated with that he said then to
[1:28:29] have every penny of money in the whole
[1:28:31] earth
[1:28:32] because i'd have to lose it all
[1:28:35] he said but what you send up there
[1:28:37] is eternal right
[1:28:39] and that's the reason we're trying
[1:28:42] that's the reason
[1:28:45] let's bow our heads together
[1:28:48] i want to take somebody with me
[1:28:52] i
[1:28:53] i want to see us as a church
[1:28:56] just
[1:28:57] i know we're not all here tonight and
[1:28:59] maybe i should have done this on a
[1:29:00] sunday morning when more would be here
[1:29:01] but
[1:29:03] maybe they'll hear this i know most most
[1:29:04] of the folks listen
[1:29:07] i want us to renew our vow as a church
[1:29:12] to get this gospel to the world
[1:29:14] and i know you've given sacrificially
[1:29:16] you've supported missions you've paid
[1:29:18] your tithes and
[1:29:20] done that but i
[1:29:21] what i need now is your prayers
[1:29:25] i need to know that
[1:29:27] you're
[1:29:30] you're 100 percent
[1:29:31] behind it
[1:29:33] in the sense that i'm i
[1:29:35] like i said i don't know what will
[1:29:36] happen
[1:29:37] but i need to know that you'll say
[1:29:38] brother ben i
[1:29:39] i'm going to support a work any work and
[1:29:42] i'll say this not just our church not
[1:29:44] just what our church does
[1:29:46] because it's just a small part but i'll
[1:29:48] support any work that gets this message
[1:29:50] to the people of god
[1:29:52] i won't let personal issues hinder that
[1:29:54] and i've seen that too many times among
[1:29:56] believers where
[1:29:57] brothers will get
[1:29:59] because of personal issues with one
[1:30:00] another they'll they'll not support
[1:30:02] certain works
[1:30:04] i don't believe in that
[1:30:05] every opportunity i get i want to
[1:30:07] support a work that's getting people to
[1:30:09] christ
[1:30:11] and and maybe we would go and and it
[1:30:13] wouldn't be as successful as what we
[1:30:14] would like but
[1:30:16] what is success
[1:30:18] if we can get one soul
[1:30:20] and be worth more than 10 000 worlds
[1:30:23] what about your neighbors what about
[1:30:24] your friends what about the people at
[1:30:26] the grocery store i believe there's
[1:30:28] somebody you could witness to today this
[1:30:29] message is as powerful as it was when i
[1:30:32] was a
[1:30:32] child and i remember what it was like
[1:30:35] when we would gather around a tape
[1:30:36] player and listen to the the tapes of a
[1:30:38] prophet
[1:30:39] remember what it was like in that
[1:30:40] feeling that we were listening to
[1:30:42] something that was wonderful
[1:30:44] and time has kind of taken away a lot of
[1:30:47] that and sometimes we we realized people
[1:30:49] made mistakes and they they pointed to
[1:30:51] the wrong things but what are we going
[1:30:53] to point to today that message is still
[1:30:55] as real as it was when brother branham
[1:30:58] preached it
[1:30:59] it's still the same message it's the
[1:31:01] message of the hour it's not the message
[1:31:02] of a man but it's the message of the
[1:31:05] hour and we preached that to you this
[1:31:06] morning we're in the land of the
[1:31:08] promises we're not halfway there
[1:31:10] two-thirds of the way there we're living
[1:31:12] there we're not preaching a man we're
[1:31:14] not preaching the words of a man we're
[1:31:15] not feeding on a man we're feeding on
[1:31:17] the unfailing words of the the body word
[1:31:20] of the son of man you believe that
[1:31:21] tonight amen just just search your heart
[1:31:23] say lord if there's a way that i can
[1:31:25] help in some way lord
[1:31:27] i want to pray i'm going to do
[1:31:28] everything i can commit myself to
[1:31:30] getting this gospel out this gospel must
[1:31:32] be preached
[1:31:34] and then
[1:31:35] then the end will come heavenly father
[1:31:37] we're so thankful to be
[1:31:39] one who is a minister of your gospel
[1:31:41] today
[1:31:42] lord and i'm so thankful for these who
[1:31:44] are supporters
[1:31:45] and some ministers here as well
[1:31:48] who are people who i think of different
[1:31:50] ones who've committed themselves i think
[1:31:52] of some of the elderly people maybe they
[1:31:55] they went through a time when getting
[1:31:56] the message out was hard work
[1:31:58] and they witnessed to their neighbors
[1:32:00] and the people at the factory
[1:32:02] and some of them typed up books and
[1:32:05] and did that but maybe there's not a
[1:32:06] need of that so much here
[1:32:09] as so many people have heard and have
[1:32:10] access to different things in their
[1:32:12] language
[1:32:13] lord there's still a need in other lands
[1:32:15] and i pray god that you'd help them lord
[1:32:17] to recognize that and whatever we can do
[1:32:20] lord we want to do it
[1:32:22] lord and not not just go
[1:32:24] aimlessly but to go with a message
[1:32:27] go knowing that you said these signs
[1:32:28] shall follow them that believe
[1:32:30] not only to preach the gospel but to
[1:32:32] demonstrate the gospel to the people
[1:32:34] demonstrate the love of christ
[1:32:36] demonstrate the power of christ
[1:32:38] demonstrate that you are a healer
[1:32:39] demonstrate that you are a savior i
[1:32:41] believe you are that tonight lord if
[1:32:43] there's one here that needs lord that
[1:32:45] healing or that saving power i pray
[1:32:47] you'd move down in the congregation lord
[1:32:50] even as we sing and as we worship the
[1:32:52] heart that you perform your good work in
[1:32:54] their life i pray that you do that lord

[1:33:18] spark in them lord that when they get
[1:33:20] older if you tarry that they'd want to
