you and thank you musicians and it's so good to be back in Hardy Arkansas I've uh looked at my I looked at my schedule there back in my notes and I I think it was the New Year's Eve the last time I was here so this is officially my first time here this year and just always an honor and a privilege to come uh here and uh and so trying to brother Ben you know being out today so I'm going to try to act right so he doesn't have a bunch of mess to clean up when he gets back so uh y'all just uh just pray so we'll just try to get right into the word this morning while we're all standing let's turn to Exodus the thir chapter and and uh good to see old friends and and uh newer friends and just uh certainly happy to be in the house of the Lord so Exodus the 3r chapter I was so glad to hear the meetings and uh and uh caught most of them online bits and pieces I haven't maybe got all of them but my how the Lord blessed dur in those meetings and it's just uh uh just an you know I I have heard several testimonies and different things come from that and and uh that's what it's all about Saints when you can have Unity and and um you know people can come together then uh God's blessings can fall and so uh it was just good to see amen Exodus the thir chapter amen Gabe good to good to hear the good news and so uh proud for you guys and and uh uh just uh the Lord is good to us isn't he Exodus the 3 chapter and the first uh we'll read the first 12 verses or so there of Exodus the 3 chapter now Moses kept the flock of Jethro as father-in-law the priest of Midian and he uh led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the Mountain of God even to Horeb the and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned now let's just skip down to the seventh verse and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows let me stop right here and just say this that God still hears the Cry of his people today he still uh knows their sorrow he's still a God that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities today and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of a land unto a good land and large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyp Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt and Moses said who am I that I should go unto pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou Hast brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve god of Upon This Mountain shall we bow our heads Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be assembled with Believers today we're so thankful to be in your house Lord and have the opportunity to worship you and now Lord we just pray as we come to this part of the service Lord we know that your word is spirit and Truth Lord we ask that you would break to us the bread of life this morning we pray Lord that you would walk up and down the aisles and minister to your people father I ask that you would watch over me and and Lord and Lord I pray that you would bind my lips before I would speak anything unpleasing to you and we'll commit it into your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you may be seated and the title of the message this morning is it's not how you start it's how you finish and if I could take a subject on that I would also say that your past does not dictate your future your past does not dictate your future and I I see this Saints and my feeling this morning is we got a couple of issues in the message that I feel like really hinder the children of God from going forward in God and and one of those is complacency and it's When people's been around for a while and they've been serving the lord for a while and they've loved the Lord for a while and they and they get kind of in a Groove where they're coming to church and they're and they're sing and they hear the word and they leave and they come and they start and things kind of start to settle down for them and things kind of become common to you and you just kind of it's just another Sunday or it's another Wednesday and and and that complacency kind of sets in and and Saints we just can't allow complacency to set into our lives because when you stop going forward you don't stay the same you start backsliding and so there's never a point in our life after 27 years of serving the lord now there's never a point in my life where I could say I've arrived and I'm I'm there and I'm good enough amen we got to constantly be traveling forward we got to be better tomorrow than we are today and we got to be better the next week as we are right now and if you see me next year I want to be a better man than I am today can you say Amen this morning and the other that I see that really holds the Church of God back is forgiveness Saints the Forgiveness not just forgiveness of others and if you've been around this message very long somebody's done you wrong all right somebody's somebody's hurt your feelings Brother David somebody's done something bad bad to you somebody's took advantage of you or somebody's lied on you or Something's Happened in your life and somebody's done you wrong some kind of way and you got to forgive them and you got to move on but the other thing you got to do Saints is you got to forgive yourself for when you've done wrong you got to you got to forgive yourself Saints you can't just keep holding on to the things that you done wrong that's all the if the devil can point you back at what you used to be say he got you you can't go forward if you're looking back and you and I'm here to tell you today saints that you passed don't dictate your future amen and it ain't how you start but it's how you finish and we find Moses here on the run on the back side of the desert and Moses had tried to do the right thing but he tried to do it the wrong way he tried to do the right thing and he failed because he took matters into his own hands and Moses knew that he was to be a deliverer brother Brown said he knew that he knew that he was supposed to deliver the children of Israel but but he took matters into his own hands he tried to do the right thing at the wrong time and the wrong way and he slew the Egyptian and he was out on the backs side of the desert and he was feeding his father-in-law's sheep and and we find that he probably thought he was just a total failure that he was all washed up that God couldn't use him no more yeah now is that right Saints and for 40 years he'd been sitting out there on the back side of the desert he hadn't even seen nothing of God all he seen is a bunch of sheep on the back side of the desert I don't know about the back side of the desert but I live on the front side of the desert and I can tell you it's pretty bare and that's where Moses found himself On The Backs side of the desert of failure amen and he probably thought he'd failed he probably thought God was done with him he probably thought there was nothing left for him but one day up on the side of the mountain he saw a bush that burned but the burning didn't burn it up and he walked up there and the bush spoke to him and said I am that I am amen and if he was the I am he's still the I am he's the I am this morning amen he's the I am tomorrow and he'll always be the I am present tense right now God and the I am told him you go down into Egypt and you tell them thus sayith the Lord the I am has sent you I like the sound of that Saints see sometimes that's the way we got to do it when we got to make our calling and our election sure and when the Devil comes in against us we can tell him the I am has sent me amen I'm going to church today because the I am has sent me amen I'm going to pay my bills today cuz the I am has sent me and the de the devil might tell you you can't get better he might tell you're not good enough but the I am has sent you Saints oh you're insufficient you're not smart enough you don't have the skills necessary but the I am has sent me today amen you ain't got enough money to put gas in the car but it's Church time well the I am has sent you amen and he said go tell the Elders of Israel together the Lord has visited you and said I will bring you up out of Egypt to a land flowing with milk and honey go pull them all together and tell them I sent you and then he said after you get done with that I want you to go right into Pharaoh's Palace and I want you to tell him that the Lord God of the Hebrews has met with you and said to let his people go amen the Lord told him just bust up in the middle of that party brother Joel just the the place that they're looking for you they he was a wanted man in Egypt he was on the run from the law he said go back down in there bust up right in the middle of that party and tell him the I am has sent you and you come to take over amen now I I used to try to sneak into parties when I was out in the world ones that I wasn't invited to you and you kind of go in lowkey you don't want nobody to notice you but that's not how the Lord did this he said March right up in the middle of it and tell them that I am have sent you oh and listen to this he said you ain't just going to tell him to let the people go but you're going to tell him we going to leave and we're going to take your stuff with us when we go that's right that's right now that's the god that we serve today see when you come through a tri you don't come out of it the same you come out of it better you come out of it with more than you went into it with you come out of it stronger with more faith you come out of it more season you come out of it with more knowledge you come through it better than you was when you started God's got a way of turning our trials into our greatest blessings amen so after he did that he said when you go down I'm sure the Lord told him when you go down and you tell them to let your people go I'm sure that he ain't going to do it see Saints it ain't never going to be easy it ain't never going to be easy and when you claim your healing today or you claim your deliverance today or you claim your family today it ain't going to be easy amen that God can miraculously heal you but sometimes you're going to claim your healing and you're going to limp every step you take waiting on God to fulfill the promise but he's still a Healer Saints sometimes you're going to claim your family and they going to get worse before they get better but that's not your business Saints it's your business to believe the word today yes sir come on somebody today good so here was a man that had probably counted himself out and that can happen to any of us maybe we think we wasted too much time maybe we think we have made too many mistakes maybe we think we we haven't done enough for the Lord maybe we think we've wasted our life life we may maybe we think it's too late for us when I came today to tell you that Moses was 80 years old on the back side of the desert and he hadn't even got started yet now brother brandom said that Moses had been a total failure this is what is that in your hand if you want to know the message he said Moses had been a total failure and he says and there may be men here this afternoon maybe ministers that's been total failures maybe you have been as a housewife maybe you have been as a student at school maybe you have been as a child to your parents whatever you have been let that be has been and start from today oh you might have made some mistakes and you might have come up short a few times but that Let Let There Be has been and start right now you might have been up and down but let it be has been and start right now you might have been in and out of the message but let that be hasb and start right now you might have not started well but you can finish well Saints and I came to tell you that your past don't dictate your future let that be has been oh you say well I ain't been a good father to my children let that be has been and start from today being the kind of daddy that you want to be I had been a good mother to my kids let that be has been and start right now Moses had been a total failure and he was a prophet of God what about you and I today if Moses can start today you can start today oh I don't like my prayer life well start today and change your prayer [Music] life I hadn't been a strong believer like I should have been I hadn't been a good example like I should have been start today being the kind of believer you want to be is that right Saints prach maybe you've been an alcoholic maybe you've been a drug addict maybe you've been a prostitute Moses had been a total failure but he started today we let the has been be in the has been our past doesn't dict our future it's not how we start this thing it's how we finish this thing there's a lot of them can start good but they can't finish good I've seen a lot of Believers in my time I thought they're real Believers they're genuine and they ain't around no more there you go amen but I'm still here Saints you're still here and we're still fighting the greatest battle ever fought and if we made mistakes that's fine but your past don't dictate your future right we got to forgive ourself when we forgive others you might have sat around your whole life and done nothing but one day God's going to call us to come up higher he might have sat around your whole life and not done anything for God but but God caused a people he caed a bride to come up high no matter where we're at we can constantly come up higher can we pray a little more can we serve him a little better can we be a little more help to somebody can we serve better than we have last year can we serve better than we have all the other rest of our life can we give him more than what we're giving him today that's right that's good that's good that's a past but that's not our future you say well I hadn't done nothing for the Lord yeah that might be true that you hadn't done nothing for the Lord yet but a past doesn't dictate our future but we got to start somewhere might be today might be in a service like this it might be theight when we get home might call all the kids together so you know what we hadn't done this but tonight we're going to read the Bible tonight before we go to bed we're having prayer yeah tonight we're going to take 10 minutes and hear a little bit of a tape tonight we're going to do a little devotion might start in the morning you say I'm getting up early in the morning I hadn't read my Bible like I need to but I'm starting in the morning I'm getting up early I'm gonna get up before everybody else gets up and I'm going to read my Bible I'm G to pray I'm going to start today amen and it ain't how you start it's how you finish right amen don't look at your failures look at your election see God called you God predestinated you that's why you're here today you say no I'm here cuz Mama brought me no you're here cuz God called you here there's a reason for everything I'm just here to try to pacify my spouse I'm just here cuz Mom and Daddy said I should come no you're here cuz God called you here amen and if if he's called you he's got a reason for calling you he's got something for us to do he don't call us for no reason God's ways are perfect and we're CH children of God for a reason and we got a purpose and there's something that he has for us to do now is that right Saints right now Moses had been a failure up into that point but he hadn't even got started yet and I'll tell you this we'll never find our purpose as long as we're looking at our past right he said and what's set in your hand he said no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure as a Christian maybe you have failed to go on with God Moses failed uh down in Egypt when he was born to be a deliverer to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt why because he did it himself now anytime we try to do it ourself we're going to end up failures anytime we try to clean herself up we're going to be failures anytime we try to get good enough to come to church we're going to be failures but when God cleans it up it'll stay clean good and he said he said he took it upon himself to do it and anytime you take things upon yourself and leave God out you're going to be a failure like Moses was see we got to learn how to let go and let God handle stuff don't we you know David looked out one day and seen a giant on the other side and he wasn't scared of that giant he he said today about this time I'm going to take my sword and cut your head off of your neck your shoulders is going to be headless later on today he said today about this time the birds is going to be eating your carcass because the battle isn't mine the battle is the Lord's and Saints that's the attitude we got to have today the battles that we're fighting they're not ours they're the Lords we belong to him he's the one that fights the battles he's the one that takes care of the needs we can try to fix it our best we can try to do all we can but we will fail but he can't fail the battle isn't mine the battle is the Lords yes so Moses was being called to a little something higher the Lord spoke to him and he gave him a revelation out of this burning bush and immediately as soon as God called him as soon as God commissioned him immediately Moses starts questioning himself and his own human abilities he told to Lord I Lord I don't even know your name he said well the I am a sent me he he he said they won't believe that you appeared to me he he said they they won't believe that I talked to you he said he said I can't even talk good I can't I'm so glad today saints that you ain't got to be able to talk good to make it into heaven right I'm one of the few preachers on the on the trail today that they got to have a translator to translated into English and places but that's our attitude Saints I'm not as smart as that brother I'm I'm not as good as this other brother I I don't know as many quotes as that preacher does I'm not as charismatic as that preacher is I can't play my instrument as good I I don't know as much my my family's not is in order that sister over there she's got it all together but Saint your past doesn't dictate your future see that was his past that was his mistakes that was doing all that talking and that's CA he's looking at the wrong thing I've read this to you before I want to read it again brother Brown says in Jehovah Gyra he said brother stop looking at yourself and look at your sacrifice he said if you can find any fault in that all right but if you find no fault in that then you are perfect let me ask you today Saints is your sacrifice perfect today is your sacrifice perfect is Jesus Christ perfect today then the prophet of God said if Christ is perfect you're perfect cuz he didn't accept you he said God accepted Christ and Christ accepted you and you don't have to be good enough he was good enough and he made the sacrifice for you he made the price pay that you couldn't pay pay amen and he says this he said and you're dead and your life is hidden God through Christ sealed by the Holy Ghost and all the devils in hell can't turn you out of there for you are God's Property he said amen turn to your neighbor and say you've been bought with a price that was terrible turn to your neighbor and say you've been bought with a price you've been bought with a price brother Joel you've been bought with a price meaning you're God's Property meaning you belong to him meaning he's the one look if somebody messes with one of your kids they got to deal with you come on somebody are you too religious for all that if somebody messes with one of my kids they going to mess with me amen and you're a child of God today and the battle isn't yours the battle is the Lords it's not how you start it's how you finish and I might not have started very good I wasn't raised in this message I didn't come from a message home but by the grace of God I can finish today maybe your testimony is different but maybe you've made some mistakes maybe you maybe you've had a rocky road up into this point maybe it hadn't been a clean trajectory I'll tell you life ain't clean like that there's ups and there's downs and there's good times and there's bad times there's times where you're a better Christian than you are at others right you might not started the way you want to but you can finish this race today when Moses left that burning bush that day everything was different brother Brown said in believer's position in Christ he said Moses found out the real direct will of God and time of God and the revelation of everything to do he said now try to keep him out of Egypt he said right back to Egypt he went as hard as he could go for he knew that God had promised deliverance and the time had come for deliverance see when he left that burning bush Saints he walked different and he talked different and he acted different and the things coming out of his mouth was different he looked different amen and when you meet that Pillar of Fire Saints you ain't going to be the same when God gets a hold of you you're not going to look the same you're not going to talk the same you're not going to walk the same you're not going to the same places you used to go you're not going to do the same things you used to do when people look at you they going to say there's something different about that sister amen when I I gave my heart to the Lord all of my buddies left one by one I didn't run them off they just left on their own right Amen brother Brown used another example of St Paul and he said listen to this quote here from believer's position in Christ he says Paul not by desire not by choice not by the will of man or his own human human desires but by the will of God was an apostle Paul wasn't an apostle cuz he wanted to be he was an apostle because God wanted him to be he said we need some more like that by the will of God he said he was on his road to Damascus to arrest think of it was going to arrest the very group that he was sent to be an apostle of Amen Saints it ain't how you start it's how you finish amen it ain't ain't it ain't your past that dictates your future amen he said now he said now how upside down it looks to the human element that God does things just the very things that you think you won't do might be the things that you have to do let me read it again when God does things it might be the very things that you say I'm never going to do that you got to do right I'm so glad it wasn't how Paul started he might have not have started good he started out as an enemy of the church he started out witnessing the stoning of Steven holding the coats of those that stone him he started out with with papers to go put him in jail he started out as an enemy to the church but when he got done he could say I have fought a good fight I have finished my course and I have kept the faith it ain't how you start Saints it's how you finish to day the mistakes of his past didn't dictate his future right oh my so we see how important it is to Lo know the Lord's will for our life and we want to be found working on the right things we want to be found doing the things that God wants us to do we don't want to be working thinking we're doing something for God and it not be God's Will and see you can be sincere but be sincerely wrong is that right Saints I I've been there myself I I don't even agree with myself from five years ago but I was sincere five years ago I was sincere 10 years ago but I was sincerely wrong yes sir we can be sincere but we can be sincerely wrong see people like to talk about that people like when other people are wrong oh they're sincere over at that church they're just sincerely wrong we like it when we're right and everybody else is wrong it's easier it's easier to deal with when we're right amen you can say well they they they sincere over there but they're sincerely wrong but I want to present another side to it brother Brown said in taking sides with Jesus he said God is no respect of person and he said we see a person deeply and sincere he can be sincerely wrong but if he sincerely God will lead him to the light somewhere he'll come to it cuz God is obligated to do that Saints you don't you don't that's why we can't judge on nobody we don't know if they're sincere God is obligated they might not be right right now but if they're sincere right now God will lead them to the light somewhere right they might be tied up in a mess right now their Doctrine might be a wreck right now but if they'll be sincere God will lead them to the light that's what a prophet [Music] said amen if they'll stay sincere so it also applies to us you think well I don't know if this is right or not I don't know if I'm doing the right thing or not I don't know if it's the will of God for my life or not just be sincere Amen brother Brown said you remain neutral to it you commit it to the Lord in prayer then you see how you feel led then you wait and then you see how you feel L wait a little bit more he said then you go and he said you've committed it to God in prayer and if you've committed it to God In Prayer he said you're doing the best you can what else can you do Saints you can't just sit around paralyzed and don't do nothing because you don't know if it's the will of the Lord tonight that's good enough for the devil right there oh I don't want to do this cuz I don't want to be wrong well then you ain't going to do nothing he said but if you do it in prayer and you be sincere he said Paul started out the wrong way and he got a Macedonian call the Lord corrected the error and if we we'll follow those steps and we commit Things To God In Prayer we don't have to worry about if it's the will of the Lord or not if the Lord knows that he can speak to you and you'll follow and Obey then he you can be sincere and he'll line he'll line you up with the word he'll line you up with the lights now the Bible tells us to seek you first the kingdom of God and all the rest of it be added to us but that goes against this carnal nature that goes against this flesh that we fight this flesh wants it to be easy this flesh wants to go the path of least resistance this path this this this flesh don't want to when you're tired it don't want to pray this flesh don't even want to come to church on Sunday morning oh come on somebody I got too religious today this flesh has got to be made to come to church amen this flesh now the spirit wants to come the spirit wants to come fellowship and the spirit wants to but my mom she's not a Believer but she's been coming to church here lately and she told me she said you know it's funny on Wednesday there's always some I never feel like going to church on Wednesday that's true right and she never will but we come anyways amen we bring this flesh into subjection to that word amen so this flesh is selfish this flesh is to take the path of least resistance this flesh it caters to its own Comfort that's the flesh that we fight every day amen and And We complain Saints about everything that's I'm not talking about this church I mean other churches we turn into a bunch of hbrd jellyfish cry babies Amy man it don't matter how fast McDonald's gets the quarter pounder out there it ain't fast enough the fries ain't never fresh enough I don't eat my steak like that the room is 72 degrees and I needed to be 70° to be comfortable these chairs ain't comfortable enough the ser last too long they got the music too loud or I can't hear good they need to do more with the young people my internet's too slow I can't check my messages see if we go do some missionary work it'll fix all that I Went Down To Jamaica and they wasn't worried about the speed of the internet yes but that's the age that we live in Rich increased in goods and the people today in this age they feel like they deserve something that they haven't earned they feel like they should be handed something a participation trophy amen you showed up good job amen feel like you deserve something feel like if they got a certain degree they should get a certain job well that that degree don't matter if you're lazy no employer says I want that lazy bum with a degree they want somebody to show up for work don't they and so you see this age of entitlement that we live in and you see you see where you got you got 40y old men living in their mama's basement eating Pringles all day you like Pringles Joel they're good it's hard to get my hand in there though living in a basement with Pringles all over the belly that's the age that we live in other people keeping them up getting a check from the government not working and they feel fine about that right and they love to talk about their rights they feel like they got a right they feel like they owed something amen and even in religion people want him to be a savior but they don't want him to be their Lord but we got to Forfeit our rights now let me let me pull over here for a minute we we got to Forfeit our rights but I had a brother I called him asked him to preach for me one day he preached for me a bunch of times he was a good Minister and I called him up one day and said Hey brother can you come preach for me and he said I brother George I I can't I Don't Preach no more he said I forfeit my rights to preach to play the tapes now I said brother you're putting a somewhere it don't belong because when brother brandham talked about forfeiting our rights he talked about forfeiting our rights to sin he said we forfeit he said you might have a right to smoke by the law the law might say it's all right but you forfeit that right to serve the Lord you might have a right to drink but you forfeit that right to serve the Lord you might have a right to run your mouth and say anything you want to say but we forfeit that right to serve the Lord but we do not forfeit our god-given privileges I'm not going to Forfeit my right to be healed and I'm not going to Forfeit my right to be saved and I'm not going to Forfeit my right to the Holy Ghost and I'm not going to Forfeit my right to claim my family and I'm not going to Forfeit the rights that Jesus Christ bled and died to pay for I don't forfeit my right to preach I'm not forfeiting my right to have joy in my life I'm not forfeiting my right to peace I'm not forfeiting my right to be Sanctified to be justified to be filled with the Holy Ghost I'm not forfeiting the rights God gave me I'm not going to spit in his face and tell him I don't want them but we do forfeit our rights to the things of this world and we can't let a spirit of entitlement bleed over into our churches right we can't don't ever let it get to be I'm the one that should be doing this or that I'm the best piano player I should be playing every service I'm the best singer I'm the one they should have sing every service I I'm the I'm the I'm the best song leader I'm the best preacher I should be Saints it is not a right that I'm here today it's a privilege that I'm allowed to be here it's a privilege that we're all allowed to be here a lot of people all over the world wish they had something like this right sir there are people around the world today praying that they can have something like this to come to these are privileges that God gives us it's not oh God I talked to a brother one time and I was talking to him about brother brand being beyond the curtain of time and he said are all these brand he's now these are your converts is that right Saints he said well Paul's people make it in he said then so will mine cuz I preached the same message he preached and this brother was a minister and he said yeah brother George but what what what about me what about the people that I win what about my converts what about when I get over there does brother brandom get credit for all of my converts I felt like said Don't Talk To Me by no Crown just let me look at him for a thousand years talk to me about no robe Don't Talk To Me by no Crown let me just get there Saints I don't care about the Stars I don't care about the gold I just want to get there just let me get there Saints we fine Brother BR said this he said the lamb is willing to submit its rights God wants us to be Lambs but there's so many times when we don't want to submit forfeit our rights you say well I got rights brother Brandon that's true but are you willing to forfeit your rights are you willing to give your rights that God could lead you that's right that's what's a matter with the church today and the great majority that the gentleness of the Lamb of God we're supposed to be lambs and we become everything else but Lambs and that's the reason as soon as we get that attitude the dove of the Holy Spirit takes her flight Saints I don't ever want to be the kind of Minister that argues over who gets a Saturday night service what does it matter what's a matter who preaches when Saints if our attitude is there to help the people it doesn't matter when we get the opportunity right so we've been in the message long enough somebody's going to do us wrong and if we get concerned about retribution if we get concerned about getting even you're derailed forgive those people and go on that's why the Lord said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord let him take care of all that we just forgive them go on you say well I I got to be asked to forgive them you don't have to have somebody to ask you to forgive them you can forgive them and move on cuz it's holding you back right let the Lord take care of that vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord amen I like that amen paper back there in the sound booth another great example of how to finish was in first Kings Elijah was at the brook cherith and the Ravens was feeding him and the brook dried up and the Lord sent him down to zarap and he told him I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee now I want you to notice saints that when the Lord told Elijah that that widow woman didn't know a thing about it he said go down to zarapa I've commanded a widow woman to feed you now that widow woman didn't know a thing about feeding Elijah now see I want you to notice saints that even in the midst of her greatest trial God had already predetermined to bless her in her greatest trial God had already determined that she was going to win in and Saints that's what you and I also I read the back of the book and we win you're already determined to be an overcomer right God had already determined it so he goes down to zarapa and he sees the little woman Gathering sticks and he said get me something to drink and she went to get it and he said also bring me a little cake and she said as the Lord God liveth I only got this handful of meal and this little Cru of oil I was going to make some for me and I was going to make some for my son and we going to eat that and die now Saints if you ain't been there you're probably going to come there there's times in our life we're that low it ain't all mountaintops Serv in the Lord there good times and there bad times there tough times she was in the middle of her greatest trial but she had to seek first the kingdom of God and she went and did what the prophet said and the Bible said that that barrel of Mill wasted not neither did the Cru all fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah and Saints I'm here to tell you today if we'll follow the sayings of Elijah we got plenty to eat on today too there's 1,200 barrels a meal there ain't no famine in the land of the church there's no famine in the bride there's a famine out there for the hearing of the word but the bride has got plenty to eat today there ain't no empty cruises of all there's no lacking of the spirit today the bride has plenty now the little woman she did she have to give her last cake away no but she had to be willing to give her last cake away now this little woman started out pretty rough but she finished well but we can't hold nothing back can we this the very things brother Brown said that you think you won't do that may be the very things that you have to do I'm so glad it's not how we start but how we finish I'm so glad that my past doesn't have to dictate my future I'm I'm so glad that the things that I've done wrong in my life don't stop me from achieving the purpose that God has set for me you know when Moses messed up he was still the deliverer right when Moses was a failure he was still the deliverer and when you mess up you're still a Christian today and when you when you fail you're still part of the Bride today and you still got a purpose and you still got something that you will accomplish because your past doesn't dictate your future but when we look at our lives we see it's clearly all about priorities many times we say we won't help but there'll be certain areas of our life that we're not willing to put out on the table we say oh Lord I want to be closer to you I want to do more for you I I don't want to deal with these struggles anymore but but to some part of our life we're not willing to give up it's different for everybody every one of us has got things that we're wanting to hold back we don't want to let the Lord have it maybe it's a job many people you finally get a good job you finally start earning a little bit of money but then it keeps you out of the house of the Lord on Sunday or you can't make it on Wednesday you can't make it regular like you used to you said well I Lord I'd like to be closer to you I don't feel like I feel backslid I don't feel like I'm as close to you as I need to be well you're not at church like you need to be but you're not willing to put that on the table Saints I'd rather have less money and more blessing all right yes maybe it's some kind of hobby or some kind of habit that we got and it's obviously no good for us see Saints there's not inherently things that's good or bad but there's spirits on everything and no matter what it is you can let it get a hold of you no matter what it is it carries the spirit if you watch somebody and there there ain't nothing I'm not saying I'm not preaching against this well if you watch people sometimes they'll go out and get them a motorcycle but it don't stop with the motorcycle you got to get the boots and you got to get the belt buckle you got to get the jacket and you got to get the beard oh not in this church I know or maybe it's hunting and fishing sometimes uhoh I'm in Hardy Arkansas ain't I said well brother Brown hunting and fishing well there's nothing wrong with hunting and fishing but you can do it too much if it gets to be too much of a priority where you'd rather do that than anything else is that right Saints ain't nothing wrong with Hunting Fishing there nothing wrong with riding a motorcycle but anything can become an idol to you amen sometimes it's a phone or or some kind of video game or oh my people won't talk to their kids cuz they're busy on the phone they're living their life through social media something like that there's nothing wrong with any of those things but all of it can get a hold of us amen maybe we having trouble making ends meet because we got all kinds of stuff amen maybe we got a boat and a camper and all this other stuff but we ain't got time to use it because we got to work all this overtime to pay for it we can't get to church like we need to we don't see our family like we need to and we're not willing to let it go man that's got hard preaching didn't it amen I'd rather let my family be blessed than to have some more stuff let's have the musicians come maybe it's some kind of worldly fashion you know what's not pleasing of a child of God but it's it's hard to let go of you know I'm seeing worldism creep into our message I'm seeing the things that brother Brandon preached against and they've got to be common place well Saints we don't we don't raise the we don't raise the bar up because sin's abounded the standard is the standard what was wrong when brother Brandon preached it is wrong today is that right Saints but it's got to be something whatever it is that's sucking the life out of us we got to be willing to put that out on the table and we don't let sit around and mope over that oh I've made so many mistakes I've done so many things wrong no that's our past but it can't dictate our future and you might not have started like you want to but you don't have to finish that way I'll tell you like this Jesus is worth everything that we're afraid of losing he's worth everything that we're afraid of losing can we just play he's worth everything you scared all if I give up this job I don't know what that's going to do if I get rid of this stuff in my life I don't know what that's going to do I I if I if I can't do this if I can't do that if I can't if I can't dress this way or dress that way if I can't do this or that I don't know what that's going to do he's worth everything right that we're afraid of losing but we got to put it all on the table for him today can we bow our heads sometimes God will require us to do the things that we didn't want to [Music] do sometimes he requires us the things we said we'd never do might be the things we have to do sometimes we might have to praise him when we don't feel like it we might worship him when we don't feel like it we might we might have to get out of our comfort zone in our worship we might have to get out of our comfort zone in our prayer life life we might have to get out I'm going tell you like this Saints when it comes to worshiping the Lord God didn't halfway save us and I'm not going to halfway worship him he didn't halfway Deliver Us and I don't want to halfway praise him he gave it all for me and I want to give it all for him today if that's your desire just let the Lord know Lord I hadn't started good but I want to finish well I I've made mistakes in my past but I don't want it to dictate my future I've went all this time maybe I've been a failure maybe I've come up short amen but Moses was 80 years old and he was just getting started let me just be getting started Lord give me the chance to make a choice today give me the opportunity today give me the O option today to to put all that past behind me to commit all that to the Lord and move forward today Lord Jesus you see the hands you know the heart you know what your people have need of and Lord God if there's any part of my life any part of our lives today that's not yielded to you something we're holding back something we're scared to let go of oh God may we do it so today Lord something that has been a mistake in our life that's holding us back that's our past we got to let that has been be has been and we we got to start from today Lord help us start right now maybe consecrate our lives today Lord we commit them into your hands today Father we pray Lord that you would shape us mold us make us in your image Lord we commit it to you in prayer and we're trusting Lord that we're sincere and if we're sincere We Trust Lord that you'll correct us if we're doing wrong Lord God help us to be more sincere we love you and we thank you we commit this church into your
