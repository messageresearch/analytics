already the expectation is here I I pray that you just move Lord that You' speak directly to your people move me out of the way help me Lord or to just say what you would have me say we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse 7 2 Corinthians 4:7 we'll read down through verse 10 we just got back from Dyersburg we went preach there Friday night and just enjoyed that with the Bose meeting little church there just a small church but took a van load over there and really enjoyed that I you know sometimes just trying to help somebody and and brother Bo's a a good man he got a good church there a little church but it's just they struggled as far as the numbers over the years but just to be able to go and put our shoulder to the wheel I enjoyed doing that last week we're at brother Frank praders on a Friday night and uh and trying to come back and do what we do here um I appreciate y'all being patient with me and letting me do that I feel like it's needful we're we're one bride we're one body we're going to spend eternity together and let's let's just try to help everybody that we can while we're here we've only got so many hours so many days so many breaths to breathe let's do what we can for the people of God while we can and for one another Second Corinthians 47 we have this treasure meure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated immediately after the service today we got two baptisms today brother miles is going to be baptized today and then uh brother Theo is going to be baptized as well he just kept on us kept after us and uh he wants to be baptized we're want to do that today amen isn't God good to us amen if you need to be baptized and you're here this morning would like to be be baptized or re-baptized be glad to do that as well the waters had a baptism last week we've got one scheduled for next week believe the Lord's doing something you know when when the in the old uh Testament times around the time of Jesus when he came they had a pool of be beeta and it was a pool that was moved by an Angel at a certain time and people waited around that pool and waited and soon as the angel moved the waters the first one in got healed and uh I think we ought to be like that as far as our anticipation although we believe that he's here all the time yes when you see God begin to move try be the first one in participate be a part of that I think God's doing something among us and we appreciate that very much thank you to your parents for teaching your children and bringing them up in the fear and admonition of the Lord I want to speak to you this morning on the law of contrast wasn't it a beautiful morning it was beautiful I walked outside and brother Harvey told me he said my this is beautiful Beau this morning and I it was it was just beautiful and it so cool and nice and but Harvey had the Heat and the air on this morning in the church and and uh you know we we just it was so wonderful and and I walking outside just makes you feel rejuvenated makes you feel young makes you feel like going out and and doing something and and I walked outside and I begin to think about that and and I realized you you know why it feels so good this morning because it was a degrees a few weeks ago right when you couldn't stand outside or your head would get burnt or at least those of us with no hair right you you have a hard time standing out in the sun and it was hot and you get sweaty and and and you just had your feel of that at least some of us did and and it's it's hard it's hard to be a fat man and and it be hot and and so when it begins to cool down you begin to enjoy the the presence or the the feeling in the atmosphere how different it is and it's the contrast that that makes that where you can appreciate it you would never appreciate the fall if there was never a summer you would never appreciate the cool weather if there was never hot weather and so and then it's going to get cold after a while and and we're all going to be freezing to death and we're going to be wearing big coats and we're going to be turning up the heat and sitting beside the fire and we're going to be say boy I can't wait till summer and and we'll be complaining about that but we wouldn't appreciate the summer if it wasn't for the cold weather right so there's a law of contrast and the law of contrast is the idea that you can't really appreciate the value or the beauty of something until you've seen or experienced its opposite right you can't really appreciate something until you've seen its opposite so when they make a painting when a painter paints they're taught the law of contrast that if you make it all one color nothing stands out but what you do is you take a color and you take its opposite color on the color spectrum and you take those two colors and blend them in together to where that the opposite color makes the the real color stand out and so if you'd never been through anything you would never appreciate the good times if you never experienced Darkness you'd never appreciate light if you never experienced hardship you'd never experience a times when it gets a little bit easier and I'll say we've all been through both of those times yeah I think sometimes you've got to experience heartbreak in your life so you can appreciate true relationship and fellowship you've got to have been through some things some loss in order to appreciate the people that you have yeah right Paul deals with this several times in the scripture in Romans chapter n he deals with it as it pertains to election he said hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel to honor and another to dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction sir that he might make known now watch the contrast he endures that that he might make known The Riches of his glory yes sir on the vessels of Mercy which he had a for prepared unto Glory so Paul is is giving us an argument he said what if God allows the wicked to continue to do wickedly what if he allows them to be who they are and to turn him down and to and to do everything that they do just for the purpose of making known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy what if he allowed Leo DEA to become what it is just so he could show the contrast with the elect bride of this day that is able to overcome to see it oh I tell you what this is a simple thought this morning but it just Thrills my heart what if God was willing was willing to let everybody else around you uh everybody else went back everybody else left the message everybody else didn't do it right but you did why did God do that because he was willing to show The Riches of his glory on a vessel of Mercy I'm so glad to be a vessel of mercy and you had nothing to do with that I had nothing to do with that God was just showing a contrast he said even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles yeah now now watch he makes a contrast in people so we can see who we are yeah right you you don't fully understand who Abel is without Cain right yeah unless Cain is is offered his sacrifice you don't appreciate Abel's sacrifice that's right why do we know Abel offered the right sacrifice not so much because God accepted his because if God had only accepted Abel's sacrifice and not rejected Cain's we would think well maybe there's another sacrifice that could be offered right but he rejects Cain's sacrifice to show us that no other sacrifice other than the blood is able to and I'll say this that the only thing that God accepts today is the blood you've got to have the token you've got to be born again you've got to have the life of the blood right but Cain shows us who Abel is so the darkness of Cain's life stands out in contrast to the light of Abel right you had to be one born of the wicked one so the one who was born uh who was born of Adam and Eve could stand out against it yes oh my there had to be an Isaac and an ishmail God allowed Abraham to make that mistake yeah and you look at what's going on today Isaac and Ishmael are still fighting yeah they're still killing one another they're still going through the the time they're going through in Israel today because those two boys there had to be a contrast and if you look today you can still see here's a people that that believe in God there's God's chosen people and here is a here is a usurper here is a here is a the result of a slightly doubted promise right and so the one stands out against the other and makes the other makes you realize who the other is right you look at the difference in Esau and Jacob yeah and Esau actually uh when you look at him if he was standing alone you would look at him and say he's a pretty good guy he's actually he gets along pretty good with his father he does everything he's supposed to do he's a hunter he's a he's a good man he's a he's a he make a good message brother but you take you take him and hold him against Jacob and you realize that God deals with Jacob in a more Supernatural way yeah Jacob is a worse kind of a fellow he's a kind of a guy brother Brandon calls him a Shyer he's a he's a guy will steal from you if you don't watch it and until he gets his change amen till he meets the angel he's a guy who just doesn't always tell the truth he's kind of a mama's boy kind of a but God used that he used Esau to stand out against Jacob so we can see that the elect it's not of him that runneth it's not of that willth but it's God that shows Mercy aren't you glad of that this morning there might have been people who were better people there might have been people who had a lot of more money there might have been people who had a lot better family but God dealt with you in a supernatural way that he didn't deal with them like that yes sir good are you with me so far God that's why the trip that's why God allows in among School among family among everybody else once you're born again there'll be a contrast between you and the world world you young people there's a contrast between you and the other young people why is that why does he make such a contrast between these young ladies sitting over here in the young ladies of the world why do you look so different and dressed so different because there's a contrast God's showing oh my God's showing there's something real there may be all kinds of mess out there but we would never know what it was unless there was a contrast right good well I thank God for our sisters today yes are you happy you aren't you glad we have sisters that are still dressed right and live right do what's right think we men ought to be uh to be proud of our wives and mothers and those who and and our daughters who dress right and and uh and live right in this world it's hard but there has to be a contrast CU God's going to have a bride me just bear with me I my voice is not good today but you see contrast between Moses and Pharaoh yeah look now here both raised in the same house right both those boys raised in the same house for the same purpose to be rulers in Egypt but you find that Moses Moses rejected all of that gave up all of that gave up everything that he was sold himself out to the people of God yes I I say that shows election right there when you see people that are willing to do what it takes to be with the people of Goden to to to to believe like uh like like what they believed and to to take on their uh their it was slavery that they were in but he was willing to take that on rather than the riches of Egypt he did that willingly he chose that and it showed a contrast between him and Pharaoh there was a contrast between Ruth and orpa in the Bible when Ruth was uh was a a moabit she was just like orpa physically she was just like orpa in her in maybe in her way she was raised and everything else but when the when the testing time came the contrast showed up it all looked the same until the testing time came but when the testing time came Ruth clav to her mother-in-law and orpa turned back and left oh church I think that's the hour we're living in now we're living in a testing time yeah the message right now is going through a testing time are we going to believe what a prophet said or we going to believe what the world says it's a testing time God's going to prove who you are he's going to make a contrast between those who believe and those who do not believe yeah there's a contrast between David and Saul right they're both Kings of Israel yeah but look at the difference you'd never appreciate David unless you had a Saul yeah right you never appreciate Oh my Jesus like we do unless there was a Judas unless there was a Pharisee yeah unless there was whoever in that day would be a contrast to Christ right so the lives of these stand against one another brother brandham talks a lot about this and he talks about an elevator operator and he told him he was on the elevator and and he told him he said you know he said you have an up and down job some of you will get that later but brother brand said we life is like that it's like an elevator operator he said OU know we don't enjoy the UPS L we have the Downs said you realize we wouldn't have any mountains if we didn't have any valleys yeah you wouldn't appreciate the sunshine if there wasn't any night you said in a person sometimes in very very good health maybe they don't know how to appreciate let's they had a real sick spell sometime and almost died then they can appreciate your good health he said it's the law of contrast I believe yeah I I got a phone call this morning from Brother Paul Seymour he wanted to be here today but he he got in a fight with a cow and and uh the cow won and and he broke his leg and brother Paul broke his leg and and Gabe you can empathize with that a little bit he's he's going through it right now and his wife has got a rotator cuff injury so they're both kind of down and he told me this morning I think they're watching this morning he told me he said he said brother Ben he said he said I he said my wife's got this rotator cuff injury and I got this broken leg he said but then I see people that are really disabled and I thank God for his blessings right we can all do that this morning it's the contrast I know this is simple this morning but it ought to mean something to our heart it's the contrast that makes the difference brother Brown said he wouldn't appreciate good health without sickness sir he said brother Brown says this he said don't be scared God is driving the winds God is driving the ark he has all things provided someone said all things he said why Noah wouldn't have had any victories there wouldn't have been storms and trials he said if we're just put through a little safe tunnel to run through there's no joy yeah oh my brother Ben why did I have to come up the way that I did why did I have to Backside like I did why did I why was I maybe out in the world didn't know the message of the hour and now I come back why did I have to come up the way that I did seem like a winding road because if he put you through a tunnel a safe little tunnel there'd be no joy but he let you experience the storm of life he said that's what makes us have the joy that's why You' got joy in your heart this morning because you've been through the storm and you know God kept you through the storm we would never know what daylight was L we had some dark we would never know what a Hilltop was L we had a mountain amen we never know what good health was unless we had some sickness you never know how to enjoy salvation unless you once was a sinner God has made all things the law of contrast he said he loves you do you believe that this morning you would never know how to appreciate a day if you didn't have a night yeah you would never know how to appreciate the sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day you'd never know how to appreciate righteousness unless you had some unrighteousness You' never know how to appreciate good health unless you had some foul Health some bad Health he said that's the reason I think we'll appreciate heaven so much because we've lived on earth once oh I think we get all say Amen to that I know the the brothers from West Plains that aren't here this morning sister Fritz and and brother JT and and sister Mr cledith I know that they appreciate they know how to appreciate Heaven because you get close to the end and your body starts to break down brother Bill I know you and sister Curtis you appreciate Heaven because you know your body just doesn't do what it used to do you just can't move like you used to move and it makes you realize there's a better place somewhere because I was young once now I'm old but Paul said or or David said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or the seed beging bread but you've lived a life that you you you begin to realize that this isn't all there is yeah Paul said if in this life only we have hope we are of all men most miserable but there's a heaven that's real but the said it's a more real place than than this one and we have a prophet who went there and came back and told us he would meet us there amen amen oh do you love the Lord this morning amen turned that off and didn't get it done we don't appreciate good health unless we get sick there ain't going to be no paing in heaven I'll fight you over that no change of the weather but because we've experienced what it's like to live in a body of corruption yeah we'll be we'll have some Joy when we get to heaven amen amen we've lived on earth once but the B said the reason we appr appreciate the holy spirit so much is because we live so long in a church come on now that told us there was no such thing yes Hallelujah the reason oh my I could stop there and Shout for a while yes amen the reason we appreciate it tonight is because we've had the other side and that's the way God has intended it to be because his people has had their ups and downs yes feel like an elevator operator sometimes don't you today we're up going up then we're down tomorrow we're up and then we're down but you realize you reach a place in your spiritual experience that you don't go up with the ups and down with the downs but you've reached a place where you know God will take care of me he loves me I'm his child I belong to him he's been with me through the Downs he'll be with me through the ups he'll be with me all the way through I begin to trust it I begin to realize this elevator works amen amen the one who's got it under his control he makes it work listen he said the reason we appreciate the holy spirit so much is because we lived so long in a church that told us there was no such a thing the reason we appreciate it tonight is because we have had the other side yeah and that's the way God has intended it to be because his people has their ups and downs you never know how to appreciate a Mountaintop unless you've been in the valley and so you never know how to appreciate good water unless you drank some bad sometime all the way through it's a law of contrast again brother BR said now remember we're finite our minds are finite God is infinite yeah an infinite is perfect right he said a savior yes which was first A Healer or a sickness he said God permitted it that he might project his love and power to the human race remember when they asked Jesus about the blind man they said which one sinned him or his parents and Jesus said neither one did amen you know you look at that and think you say well I'm I'm I'm just so I've messed up so bad brother Ben why did I have to mess up like that God permitted it and I don't say we should look at our future like that I think we should do the very best that we can but remember what's what is in the past is in the past and what happened last minute in the last minute is in the past yeah all we have is now in the future yeah that's all we have we don't have anything else yeah so quit looking in the past you can't drive down the road looking in the rearview mirror you've got to be able to look beyond that and be able to see something out ahead of you you if the church has no vision if it's just constantly looking at what has happened and what happened in the past you'll die you'll shrivel up and die but if we can ever look at what God's doing right now look what he's doing among the young people look what he's doing for our families look what he's doing here in the house of God I believe God's moving right now let's look at that come on you get caught up looking at the past looking at the back looking behind you you'll fall you'll wreck every time but there's got to be something that God's doing right now brother brand said let's find out what God's doing and get with it amen get with the program amen what was first a savior a sinner a savior amen God permitted it now brother BR when we're brought in the presence of the Lord Jesus that is coming there will be a million Angels stand around the earth with bowed heads listening at the church sing glory to God oh I'm M it makes me want to sing even though I can't listen at the church sing the songs of redemption not knowing what we are talking about oh my they've never been lost yeah Angels cannot worship like we can worship Angel oh Hallelujah Angels cannot praise like we can praise they can't follow the word back the word like we can why because they've never been they've never been lost so they oh my yeah you realize there's no Redemption for Angels right once they made their decision to fall they couldn't come back right but you're special people because God chose a people that was redeemable somebody that had something that was in his mind before the foundation of the earth that had a place they could come back to Esa could not repent but you cannot be lost glory to God prise the Lord amen hallelujah he said that You' they've never been lost they don't know what it means to be lost you and I know what it means they've never been sick they don't know how to Rejoice over healing sir but you let a person who's had who's been sick you realize my you realize how much you appreciate your children if it was difficult to get them into the world it's always difficult to get children into the world that's right it's a hard it's a hard occasion very difficult and a mother comes very close to death at the time she has a baby and you realize that you begin to consider that you realize that why is there so much pain but the mother very quickly forgets the pain at the joy of the new birth right at the joy of holding their baby very quickly they forget the pain but if there was no pain we would not appreciate children like we do that's righted that's right if there was no oh my but you know I think that's what makes a mother sometimes so close to a child is because they went through the pain and I'll say this you say well I adopted my children and but there's pain associated with that too that's right I tell you what there's more pain when they're teenagers than when they're little all those of teenagers say amen amen that's just true especially as they get old enough to kind of want to do their own thing you know you got to just have those battles but Peter didn't want to shave this morning and I had to make him you know that just sometimes you just got to do what's best for the child you know it just sometimes you just got to do what's best a't that right and the teenager he don't you know they they got an idea what they want to do and they're fixing to be an adult fixing to be able to make their own decisions and and so there's pain in that you know I've been told and I don't know this by experience but I've been told once they get older and they leave home there's real pain sometimes you can't you see mistakes that they're making there's nothing you can do about it all you can do is say I still love you that's right you can always come home amen there will be a place for you but I can't do I can't fix it yeah I wish I could you ever have a baby that's sick and it's so sick and there's nothing you can do about it and you sit there by the day and you think what if I'd do anything see my baby well do anything to see them not I'd suffer myself to see my baby not be suffering but you can't do that for them but you do have a savior you do have a Healer you do know somebody and you can appreciate your children because of the pain associated with raising children oh God we can appreciate a church you realize a church is not always it's it's not always good there's there's always going to be little things that go wrong there's always going to be little spats little things that happen nothing like that going on right now but there's always going to be stuff and always going to be people that don't get along and little things people think you made a wrong decision here the deacons did this or the trustees did that and everybody there's always going to be a little tension in a church but if it wasn't for the tension we wouldn't be able to stand up and be who we are God made it that way we wouldn't appreciate a service like this morning when the presence of God is just so real and you can and and the and the unity is so real you wouldn't appreciate that unless you've been through some when a pastor had to just pull out his sword and start to go to work right so you there there's got to be a cont and that's why I think it's lost today in the message because many times we I'm not being critical I'm trying not to be critical this morning but many times we just we're just one note we just want we just want all meetings all the time or or else we want just uh all dead all the time or or just all teaching all the time people whatever their favorite is they just want that but God has a variety for a reason there's a variety of preachers for a reason there's a variety of churches for a reason we're not all the same but we all belong to God just like he has black flowers and yellow I don't know if he has black I guess there's black flowers yellow flowers uh there's purple flowers whatever other kind of flower that there is he's got all kinds of colors of flowers right got all kinds of colors of flowers I talking about flowers all kinds of colors of flowers but there's but but there's a difference why does he do that because he loves the variety brother Brown said he's not a serious and robu Harmony House right now some of you remember serious and robu cuz you had that in your in your restroom we had a church when I was very young we didn't have indoor plumbing thank God for what we have today if it wasn't for that you'd never know the contrast I'm well I'm way I'm dangerously off my notes this morning you never have any contrast if you hadn't been through some things Joel some of those Services we set through his children we wouldn't appreciate what we have today you know why we love being in the house of God cuz we didn't always have it this easy yeah didn't always feel the freedom that we feel now we've been through some things some of y'all been through some things and so you appreciate the the house of God cuz there's been a contrast right Hallelujah he said if there' never been any evil there' never been no good if there had never been no night there never know nothing but day you see the the law of contrast it must be that way yes he said that began in Eden and the Garden of Eden sin was so beautiful until it attracted Eve from righteousness to sin and in the same Garden where there was a tree of life there was also a tree of death we would know it today as the law of contrast that where there is good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never no matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either now think about it for a minute you could be in the best meeting you can be enjoying God you could be sitting here this morning just enjoying the presence of God and get a headache you could be sitting here thinking about the things of God and all of a sudden a thought come in your mind and you begin to worry and you begin to fuss why is that because it's always present yeah the contrast is always there he said where there is good there is evil he said where there is right there is wrong so no matter what our environment may be we'll never be able to shake oursel from the presence of either because Paul said when I would do good evil is present The Sinner will never be able to shake away from the Christian the Christian from The Sinner he said there will be a witness thereof right and a testimony of wrong always oh my these people that believe well we'll all just get together and at the end and we'll all just be in one place on the earth brother BR said we wouldn't be right right he said the Rapture would be Universal everywhere that that we were where there's one here and one there but but we're not going to all get together in one place because there's always going to be evil prisoners always going to be three kinds of Believers yeah always going to be a mixed multitude it's just the way that it is Paul said when I would do good and evil is present he said and you make your choice yeah you make your choice you have to take one side or the other I want to take the right side don't you Romans 7:21 let's look at that for just a minute this is what brother randam is talking about what he's referencing he said I find in a law this is Paul speaking when I would do good evil is present with me yes I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this dead how can I ever do anything good how can I ever serve the Lord how can I ever do what's right but you're doing what's right this morning why because he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin are you with me so far the contrast evil is always present that's why uh you know we we'd fill this place up if we ever got everybody here at the same time you know why we don't it's not because people are bad it's because there's evil is present yeah sickness is present uh Satan is present there's all kinds of things that that that happen yes sir right and so that that that's just that's just the way it's going to be until we leave here that's right the miracle of Pentecost the real Miracle of Pentecost was getting 120 people in one Accord in one place getting them all to be there yeah that's a miracle and stay there for 10 days it's a miracle but they had a reason to be there a reason to stay there but I'll say this that evil was even present there and even there Satan tried to get them to leave early tried to get them but Peter stood up and said I believe that he told us to wait until yes amen and they did until the power fell but the brand said what is it he said My Flesh says tonight you're too tired your throat is too sore you've been out in the wind today you shall not go to church tonight that's just flesh talking you shall not whenever you hear those words that's the flesh talking you shall not go to church tonight he said That's the Law of the flesh you just might as well call them up and tell brother Neville he said send the questions down tell him to answer them he said but you see I promised to do it he said now my mind on the inside the holy spirit said you keep your promise promise but the flesh said you're too tired now the flesh say now there's no need you pretty little thing you're the prettiest little thing in school no don't you pay any attention to that Holy Roller mother of yours or that fanatic father yeah preaching at you girls now you young ladies oh he said don't pay any attention that's the flesh speaking right you're you're the best looking girl in school you're the prettiest boy prettiest boy the best looking boy he said the best built he was like praise God you're the most popular there is in the city he said you see he said you yield your members to that and where do you come out at little end of the horn every time Paul said My Flesh always wants always to yield to that and he said your flesh does too now that's good solid teaching isn't it my flesh always wants to yield to that your flesh does too you said but brother B if I ever felt like going to church I'd go to church when when I get to where I feel like I I want to be in church then I'll go to church you'll never go to church when I get to where I I feel like you know I feel like well you know if you only sent your kids to school when they felt like going to school they would never go right you ask a 5-year-old you feel like going to school today nope you ask a 16 year old you feel like going to school today no way most of them right on most days most children don't want to be in school but you send them because it's good for them and you come to church cuz it's good for you and you and I'm not talking about coming to church but worshiping and praising God and participating in the service if you only rais your hands when you felt like raising your hands you'd never raise your hands cuz the devil's always going to give you a reason not to if you only shout you say brother Ben someday I'm going to shout if I had a dollar for every time I had somebody walk in that office and tell me brother Ben one of these I almost got up and ran I tell you what was have been during that preaching I got so excited I almost got up and ran I told Brother Isaac uh or no brother uh brother Levi I told Brother Levi uh one time he was sitting up here he's back there now I see him back here just barely but I thought Landon was out of church today I forgot he was back there but but I I saw Levi sitting up here and I told him I said if I ever get you to nod in church he said I said I'm going to run the aisles well he did nod and I didn't run CU I didn't feel like it but you know what you know what that is if we wait till we feel like it we'll never do it God he deserves the glory he deserves the honor he deserves it on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Friday he deserves and every day of the week not just when we feel like it all right right oh brother brand said but the law of the spirit of God in the heart overcomes the flesh yeah not the law of the pastor not the law of your dad or your mom or your uncle or your aunt or your grandpa they they might be disappointed if I didn't go know the law of the spirit of God in your heart amen that's what makes you want to worship God he said it overcomes the Flesh and makes the body obey what the heart says do Oh my he said hallelujah look then he said if it will do that for a sinner won't that work for sickness too he said the law of the spirit of God and the heart that knows that by his stripes we were healed they stand with their power and make that sickness in that body obey them because it's a devil he said now the law of sin and death works in your flesh but the law of the spirit of Life Works in your heart so your heart your spirit in your heart will make your body body obey what it says do oh my oh you s those that are sick today and some many couldn't be here and I know you want to be here but you couldn't be here because you're sick remember your body obeys what your heart says do yeah let the heart speak this morning let it speak the word of God I am healed I am strong I am a believer are you with me so far he said he said that's exactly right now that's what Paul said always the flesh I'm too tired I'm unable I'm not sufficient I cannot do it he he talked about his sister Dolores and Dolores said she was just about to shout you know just about to run the aisles just about to act up in church and she said she she didn't she said I felt bad all of a sudden she said what made me feel that way just at the time I should have felt good I said the devil he said he's seen you just ready to receive it that's right he said I'll put a little damper on her Oh my he said fan her a little bit you know kind of cool down a little all right yeah you ever felt that breath of the devil right yeah every time brother Wyatt just about to run the aisles That Old Devil just are you with me now I know we're not all aisle Runners I'm just using that as an example yeah right you you feel that every time you're about to worship every time you're about to come to the Altar and you really feel convicted you you know you should come and you know you need to give your heart to God you know you there's things you need to surrender but that that's right that's good just cool as you down you start thinking about the roast at home if the service goes a little bit long that maybe it'll hinder somebody else or maybe they'll all look at me maybe I'm not dressed appropriately maybe I'm not this that or the other what'll happen what happens it's the devil yeah trying to put a damper on what God's trying to God's trying trying to build a fire right and the devil's operating the damper yeah trying to close it trying to turn it down what do you got to do take over yeah that's right brother Peter was building a fire I'm sorry Peter brother Peter was building a fire yesterday and and he I've taught him how to how to start the charcoal grill so I don't have to my goal in life is to have my children do everything for me is that right so so Peter has learned how to start the charcoal grill and it's just as easy as gas if somebody else does it and so what I so what I've done is I taught him how to do that but I went I've told him I said leave leave the flu open if you want to start a hot fire and especially when you're starting out leave the flu open on the grill it's got to draw oxygen got to draw air through the coals so yesterday he's got a lot of smoke and not a whole lot of fire and he comes in there and and he says I've done everything you said do but I just just can't get that fire going and and I said are both vents open he said well the top vents open I said is the bottom vent open well not all the way well there's your problem right if the vent is closed at all listen to me church if you let the devil get to Clos in your vent all you'll get is smoke yeah but if you can ever let it just get Open Lord I'll accept whatever you whatever you want me to do Lord that's what I'll do whatever you want me to believe that's what I believe I'm not bringing any of my preconceived notions I'm not going to put my damper on the word of God I'm going to let the word flow through me it'll ignite that fire in your life and it'll change you it'll make you a new [Applause] person he said he said Oh my he said that's when you rise how many believe that today claim your god-given rights he said that's what Paul was meaning always when he said when when I would do good evil is present let's look at 2 Corinthians 4:8 now and I uh I'm I'm pulled a brother Joel this morning I forgot to start my timer but I can see we're about 10 till 12 just in case yall were wondering and so we'll be done about the right time I think but let's just go into this now in 2 Corinthians 4:8 we are troubled on every side you ever feel that way yeah I preached when here not long ago I preached a message on that at another church and we we preached about Revival and David said in the midst of trouble thou will revive me Amen in the midst of trouble thou will revive me he said we are troubled on every side yet not distressed distressed or troubled rather is is to crush to oppress to compress it it describes a crowd pressing together it relates to oppression or Affliction you ever felt like the enemy's all around you yeah oppressing you he said we are oppressed we are troubled yet not distressed oh my we are troubled but not distressed we are oppressed but not distressed distress means to cramp or to restrain yeah oh my we are troubled now there's the law of contrast we're troubled all of us are we go through trouble but we are not stressed yeah amen we are not restrained in other words we can do what God calls us to do you believe that today yeah I'm troubled but not distressed we are constantly Afflicted but not hmed in yeah amen listen listen to this listen to this uh Amplified version said we are hedged in pressed on every side troubled and oppressed in every way but not cramped or crushed oh my right amen we still have our freedom even though we are troubled B said you know that's a trick of the devil to oppress but when the Christian knows his legal rights he said when you can quote God's word I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee that takes all the oppression away and the clouds begin to clear back but if you just know that God has promised and God is faithful he can keep his promise or he would have never promised it second Corinthians 4:8 we are perplexed now watch it is not wrong to be perplexed we are perplexed but we are not in despair the word perplexed is to have no way out to be at a loss mentally you ever you ever been that way you just don't know what to do yeah we're perplexed but not despaired so in other words not at my Wit's End not despaired not not completely out of options yeah because I have always hope in Christ listen we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out but not driven to despair I think of the three Huber children is a great example of how that they had no way out of that fiery furnace and they even knew they said our God is able to deliver us but even if he doesn't we will not bow to the image oh I pray that there' be some young people today that would say I don't know how I'm going to make it but I'm going to make it I don't know how I'm going to get out of this fiery furnace but I'm I'm coming out on the other side and they come out without even the smell of smoke on them right why because they they were they were they didn't see a way out they were perplexed but not in despair right the disciples in the boat when they were in the boat despairing of Life they were down there oh being tossed by the ocean brother Bram said the devil thought that they went off without their Lord but what did he do he climbed up on top of a mountain was s up there watching that little ship as she was bouncing in the sea he said oh I'm so glad tonight that he climbed the ramper of glory and sets in the Majesty on high and his eyes is on the sparrow and I know he watches me amen and he watches you just in the darkest of the hour when every pitch seemed to be the last one then Jesus comes along walking on the sea he said I want you to notice they were helpless hopeless despairing and when they saw him they were scared of him the very everything that they needed they were afraid of realize that's the Devil he's trying to you there's something you need and the devil's trying to put scarecrows up there well you can't trust the preacher you can't trust the church you can't trust the message he's trying to put a scarecrow up there and the very thing that you need is the thing that you're scared of many people are scared of the move of the Holy Spirit and the very thing that they need is what they're afraid of very thing that they need when they saw him they said they thought it was a ghost and they cried out in fear right he said may I say this tonight in this great hour an atomic age when this world is in despair when nation is against nation and total Annihilation could come within 30 minutes to the world Jesus is coming walking along in this darkest ofour and the world's afraid of him they're saying it's holy rollers and fortun tellers everything else could be called he said I'm so glad in this Dark Hour Jesus is walking along with his church showing himself alive this is the darkest hour the world has ever seen since the dawn of time never has it been like this I say we can say Amen to that today never has it been like this never has it been so separated never has the church been so tore to Pieces never has it been so denominationally eat up yeah come on church so many differences so many Sensations and things going on in the church yeah you know where we're standing today it's never been so denominationally eat up it's never been so many differences so many Sensations but right in the midst of it all Jesus comes along in this darkest of the hour to show his and his love to the church yes the darkest of our then Jesus comes along Hallelujah verse 9 we are persecuted but not forsaken right Hallelujah we are pursued persecuted hard driven but not deserted to stand alone yeah I'm so thankful for that today listen he told the disciples when they were about to start getting really pers uted is about to come down on him he told him he said I'll pray the father he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever yes even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you he said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that word comfortless is oranos it means I will not leave you as a as orphan children I will not leave you parentless I will not leave you fatherless that's been such a comfort to me over the years my father I had so many differences with my father and I had to come to a place where I forgave him and he forgave me I believe and we got to a place where we could we could spend time together and then he passed away and I got to a point where I thought what in the world why would God do that to me but he told me he said I'll give you father I'll give you mother I'll give you sister I'll give you brother he said and you'll never be without a father you'll never be orphanos you'll never be orphan or an orphan you'll never be parentless never comfortless never fatherless the last part of that verse cast down but not destroyed yeah we are struck down to the ground but never struck out and destroyed We Fall Down but we get back up I dare say there's not a Christian in here today even the best of us brother Danny we fall down we mess up we find ourselves faed down in the dirt sometimes but we get up over and over and over again why because the spirit of God calls us up oh come on we fall down yes we do we are cast down but we are not destroyed Hallelujah that's good brother Brandon said now we're not a perfect people we make our mistakes we do things that's wrong but you see love covers all of that we're willing when we see our mistakes to come back and apologize to one another he said yeah that's Warriors that's really men and women the gallent any man can go out to the battlefield that's got nerve enough to walk out there but when he gets knocked down then to get up and try it again Hallelujah in 2 Corinthians 4:10 Paul says always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus notice the contrast now as we're getting ready to close so he said we're we're knocked down but we're not knocked out we're persecuted but not destroyed we are we are uh we we are surrounded but not in despair yeah Paul says we have death but we have life the law of contrast so we have death this message is both death and life to us now think about it for a minute it's death to the world yeah death to our own ideas we always bear about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus yes that's right and and that's a that dying that word is very uh in the Greek is is is very strong it's it's to continually die it's not being dead it's dying dying Paul said I Die daily yeah we are we bear in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life of Jesus might be made manifest in our body Paul was knocked down but he got back up he was was knocked down on the road to emus he was or on the road rather to Damascus he was knocked down yes but he got back up yes John 5:24 he said verily verily I say un you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life it shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death un life now look notice the contrast he's passed from what from Death To Life someone say it with me this morning from Death To Life yeah from Death that's a contrast Proverbs 18:21 now look death and life are where in the power of the tongue yeah yes sir that's interesting yes sir they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew 12:37 by thy words look at the contrast Thou shalt be justified by thy words thou shall be condemned yeah so Paul said I'm always bearing about in my body the dying of the Lord Jesus now watch oh my but when it come time to die physically Paul walks up to an Executioner's block come on knowing he's going to die come on he says oh death yes sir it's easy to do when you're just saying it you know but when you know knowing he had been sentenced to death listen what he says death and life are in the power of the tongue he said oh oh death yes sir amen oh we need to call it out today yes evil that is present with me trouble that is present with me where is your sting yes brother Brown said he knew that that bee of death lost its stinger on Calvary when it stung the Son of God oh my when it stung him it pulled out in could never sting again oh death what's Paul doing death and life life and the power of the tongue he's choosing life oh I hope you're here with me today no matter what you're going through choose life Speak Life yes I've been through trouble yes I've been discouraged yes i' I've I've been through hell and back but I believe I'm a Child of God I believe I'm a son or daughter of God I believe I'm going to go to the house of God I believe I'm going to worship I believe I'm a Child of God what was the difference in Saul and David look at the contrast Saul and it's coming to me now but Saul was a man who could not speak life right he he he he was a man who made mistakes less than what David made but he could not speak life yeah but David he cried out to God he said God forgive me wash me from my iniquities cleanse me from my sin Let me feel the presence of God again let me experience the joy of my salvation he could speak life good when need we need to teach our children the law of contrast brother brand said I noticed one time it was out when we was living on the farm under there was a hog under an apple tree them apples was falling off and hitting him on the head and he eat apples all day long and never did look up to see where they was coming from or kids need to look up sometimes see where their blessings are coming from that's right well that don't only go on Hogs he said you don't realize where that food comes from you better look up and thank God for it because he was the one who gave it he said ' we don't have no more security of the home send your children to school what do they teach them out there many times too many times they teach them we come from apes he said well we don't believe that now listen he's going somewhere he said if a man's no more than an animal then eat drink and be marry what makes so many juvenile delinquents that's what makes so many crimes committed because the people's no more than an animal it makes him act like an animal that's right he said we got to tell him sir yes sir are you hearing me this morning here's the contrast they go to school and they hear that they come from AES they go to their friends and they hear all kinds of nonsense they go out in the world when they get old enough to work and they're going to experience all kinds of stuff but remember we got to tell him there's something we got to tell him we got to tell him he's a Son of God born for the kingdom of God Peter you're a Son of God

because you are the contrast amen yes amen we got to tell him he's a son of God yeah born for the kingdom of God he is somebody this is just a negative a picture negative waiting for it to be developed some someday and death is the only thing that can develop it it takes a contrast of death to develop the picture to life when you die out to yourself a new picture starts on the inside that new creature Christ Jesus begin to show himself through one of these days he will come and receive you up to himself and the whole thing will be changed in this negative Shadow becomes a positive Jesus said except a corn of wheat fall on the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit Luke 9:23 musicians go ahead and come Luke 9:23 he said to them all if any man sir will come after me Let Him Live that law of contrast let him deny himself take up his cross daily and follow me for whosoever will save his life yeah shall lose it see while I if I keep if I go to church I'll lose but if you try to save what you would lose by being in the house of God you'll lose it anyway right if you try to save what you would lose by being a Christian I'll lose my friends I'll lose my family you might but if you try to save it you'll lose it anyway amen this isn't all there is Jo is a small part of what there is this is time you can't measure time up against eternity it's such a great contrast we can't even understand it right I maybe that's what the Millennium is for it's just to show a contrast between a Thousand-Year Lifetime and a and a normal lifetime but then you contrast that with eternity right what how does that even how can you even comprehend that how can that even come into mind this is a smallest part don't live for this live for that yes won't
