[30:41] Jesus, I was perishing with cold. But
[30:45] the blessed Savior heard me when I

[31:05] hallelujah throne. Help me ring the
[31:08] Savior's praises far and wide.
[31:12] Oh, for I've opened up toward heaven all
[31:16] the windows of my soul. And I'm living
[31:19] on the hallelujah [music]
[31:21] side. [singing]
[31:23] Though the world may sweep around me
[31:26] with her dazzle [singing]
[31:27] and her dreams, yet I envy on her
[31:31] [music] vanities and pride.
[31:34] For my soul looks up to heaven where
[31:37] [music] the golden sunlight ble. And I'm
[31:40] living on the hallelujah
[31:42] [singing and music]
[31:43] side.
[31:45] Oh, glory be Jesus. Let the hallelujah
[31:50] [music and singing] roll. Help me bring
[31:52] the Savior's praises far and wide.
[31:56] For [singing and music] I've opened up
[31:58] toward heaven all the windows of my
[32:01] soul. And I'm living on the hallelujah
[32:05] side.
[32:07] Oh, not for all [music] earth's gold and
[32:09] millions would I leave this precious
[32:12] place, though the tempter to persuade me
[32:15] often try.
[32:18] Oh, for I'm safe in God's pavilion,
[32:20] [music] happy in his [singing] love and
[32:23] grace. And I'm living.
[32:26] [music] Oh, let me hear you sing it now.

[32:40] For I open up for heaven all the windows
[32:44] of [singing] my soul. And I'm living on
[32:46] [music] the hallelujah side.
[32:50] Oh, here the sun [singing] is always
[32:52] shining. Here the sky is always bright.
[32:56] There's no place for blooming Christians
[32:59] to abide. [music]
[33:01] Oh, my soul is filled with [singing]
[33:03] music and my heart [music] with great
[33:06] delight. And I'm living
[33:09] with all your hearts. Let me [music]
[33:10] hear you now.
[33:18] Help me bring the same praises
[33:20] [music and singing] far and wide.
[33:23] For I opened up toward heaven [music]
[33:26] all windows [singing] of my soul. And

[33:32] this one here. And upon [music] the
[33:35] streets of glory when we reach the other
[33:38] shore and have safely crossed the

[33:47] [music] outside my mansion door where
[33:50] I'm living on the hallelujah side.
[33:55] Oh, glory [music] be Jesus. Let the
[33:59] heavens run. Help me bring the Savior's
[34:03] praises far and wide.
[34:06] Oh, for I've opened up toward heaven all
[34:09] [music and singing] the windows of my
[34:11] and I'm living on the hallelujah
[34:14] [music and singing] side.

[34:19] tonight. Amen. We're going to sing that
[34:21] again as we invite our pastor. How
[34:22] many's ready for the word of the Lord
[34:24] tonight? Amen. Are you looking forward
[34:25] to it? If you come expecting, I believe
[34:27] you'll get what you have need of here
[34:28] tonight. Amen. Let's just sing this as
[34:30] he comes now. Oh, glory be to Jesus.
[34:33] [music]
[34:34] Let the hallelujah throw. Help me ring
[34:38] the savior's praises far and wide.
[34:42] Oh, for I've opened up toward heaven all
[34:45] the windows [music] of my soul. And
[34:48] [singing] I'm living on the pal. Sing
[34:51] that last verse again. and
[34:53] [music and singing] upon the streets of
[34:55] glory when we reach the other shore and
[34:59] have safely crossed the Jordan's rolling
[35:01] [music] tide.
[35:03] Oh, you will find me shouting glory just
[35:07] outside my mansion door where I'm living
[35:11] on the hallelujah side
[35:14] and oh glory be Jesus
[35:18] hallelujah throne
[35:22] his praise [music] is far [singing] and
[35:23] wide
[35:27] from heaven on the windows
[35:29] [music and singing]
[35:30] of my soul I'm living on the Hallelujah.
[35:35] Side [music] one more time. Oh, glory be
[35:38] to Jesus.
[35:40] Hallelujah. Ro to bring the Savior's
[35:43] [music] praises far and wide. [singing]
[35:47] For I've opened up toward heaven,
[35:49] [music]
[35:50] all the windows of my soul. And I'm
[35:53] living on Hallelujah [singing]
[35:56] side. Here the sun is always shining.
[35:58] Here the sun is [music] always shining.
[36:03] Oh, just no place for gloomy Christians
[36:06] to abide. Don't you love that? Oh, for
[36:09] [music] my soul is filled with music and
[36:12] my heart with great delight. And I'm
[36:15] living on the hallelujah side.
[36:20] Oh, glory be to Jesus. Let the
[36:23] hallelujah.
[36:25] Help [music] me ring the Savior's
[36:27] praises far and wide.
[36:30] For I've opened [music] up toward heaven
[36:33] all the windows of my soul. [music] I'm
[36:36] living on Hallelujah side. [singing]
[36:42] Hallelujah.
[36:44] Aren't you glad to be on the Hallelujah
[36:46] side? Oh my. Something about them old
[36:48] songs were written in hard times, but
[36:51] there's something about them that just
[36:52] tells us that there's a better place.
[36:54] And we're living in it. We're not
[36:56] waiting. Our bodies are waiting to be in
[36:59] a better place. But in our souls there's
[37:01] hallelujah ringing and so grateful for
[37:03] that today. Good to see each and every
[37:04] one of you here with us tonight. God
[37:07] bless you, brother JT. So good to see
[37:08] you back in church and tonight we're
[37:10] praying for Sister Clelet and each one
[37:12] of you. Good to have the VAS back with
[37:15] us today. We missed you all on Sunday.
[37:17] Sure appreciate each and every one of
[37:18] you. We love you very much. We're going
[37:20] to be gone for a couple of [snorts]
[37:23] uh couple of weeks and be back. Me and
[37:24] Britney, the kids will be here. So,
[37:27] we'll we'll be gone maybe for a little
[37:29] while, but uh you'll have good preaching
[37:31] while we're gone. So, sure you'll be
[37:32] looking forward to that. Ephesians
[37:34] chapter 1 and verse 7. I hope you're not
[37:36] getting tired of the book of Ephesians
[37:37] yet because we haven't gotten very far,
[37:40] but uh it won't take us this long
[37:42] through all of it. We're going to read
[37:43] verses 7 through 14 tonight. Just kind
[37:46] of remind ourselves of where we're at
[37:48] and uh to get the context what we want
[37:50] to say tonight. Ephesians 1, chap
[37:54] chapter 1, verse 7.
[37:57] Remember, brother Joe Adams will be with
[37:58] us on Sunday. Two services on Sunday.
[38:01] Brother Joe will be preaching both of
[38:02] those services.
[38:05] So, if you know someone that's not maybe
[38:07] not having church or something, you want
[38:08] to invite them on Sunday night, that'd
[38:09] be good to come here. Brother Joe,
[38:12] Ephesians 1:7, in whom we have
[38:15] redemption through his blood, the
[38:17] forgiveness of sins according to the
[38:19] riches of his grace.
[38:21] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[38:24] all wisdom and prudence, having made
[38:28] known unto us the mystery of his will.
[38:30] And that's what I want to talk about
[38:31] tonight, but we'll read on another few
[38:33] verses to get the context. according to
[38:36] his good pleasure, which he hath
[38:37] purposed in himself,
[38:39] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[38:42] of times, he might gather together in
[38:44] one all things in Christ, both which are
[38:47] in heaven and which are on earth, even
[38:49] in him, in whom also we have obtained an
[38:52] inheritance, being predestinated
[38:54] according to the purpose of him who
[38:56] workketh all things after the counsel of
[38:58] his own will. we should be to the praise
[39:01] of his glory, who first trusted in
[39:03] Christ, in whom you also trusted after
[39:06] that you heard the word of truth, the
[39:08] gospel of your salvation, in whom also
[39:10] after that you believed, you were sealed
[39:13] with that Holy Spirit of promise, which
[39:15] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[39:18] the redemption of the purchased
[39:20] possession unto the praise of his glory.
[39:23] I pray the Lord his blessing to the
[39:25] word. You may be seated this evening. As
[39:28] we found, Paul is establishing the
[39:30] hearts of the visions in grace so they
[39:32] can receive teaching on the family, the
[39:34] church, spiritual warfare, etc. Brother
[39:37] Brandham does the same thing. He said,
[39:39] "I preach what Paul preached." And if
[39:40] you go through the message, you'll find
[39:42] Brother Brandham is always trying to
[39:44] settle the people to establish their
[39:46] hearts in grace so that they can receive
[39:48] the word of God. He says this. He said,
[39:50] "I'm only saying this not to mix up
[39:52] doctrine, but to straighten it out that
[39:54] we might get away from this fear and
[39:56] scare." He said, "You don't know who you
[39:59] are. You You are not going to be. But
[40:01] now you are the sons of God." See, we're
[40:04] not waiting to become sons. We are going
[40:07] through a process through trials,
[40:09] through temptation, through all of those
[40:11] things. Not to become sons, but to
[40:13] become fullgrown sons and daughters of
[40:15] God, to mature, to be perfected in that.
[40:19] But we are already sons of God. We are
[40:21] already seated in heavenly places. We
[40:24] are already in Christ. And he said,
[40:26] you're not going to be, but now you are
[40:28] the sons of God. See, you always were
[40:31] the sons of God. So Paul tells us that
[40:33] he has made known unto us the mystery of
[40:36] his will. And it's a very uh a very
[40:40] wonderful thing to know the will of God.
[40:42] something people have always striven to
[40:44] know uh that the will of God in in in uh
[40:49] in in history, the will of God for the
[40:51] church, the will of God for the people
[40:53] of the world, the will of God for the
[40:55] Jews, the will of God especially as it
[40:57] pertains to the individual.
[41:00] So God's will then is a mystery until it
[41:03] is revealed and then it's no longer a
[41:04] mystery. He said he's made known unto us
[41:07] the mystery of his will. Now, there's a
[41:10] mystery of God's will for the entire
[41:13] body of Christ that has been revealed in
[41:15] this day by the seventh angel's message,
[41:18] and we'll look at that in just a moment.
[41:20] He had to make known unto us the mystery
[41:22] of his will in order to get us ready to
[41:25] receive a a rapturing faith message, the
[41:29] seven thunders that would put us in a
[41:32] place of rapturing faith, give us
[41:34] rapturing faith to take us out of here.
[41:36] I believe all of that's taking place.
[41:38] It's all here for us, church. We're not
[41:39] looking for brother Brandham to come and
[41:41] give it to us. We're not looking for
[41:42] some other preacher to come and explain
[41:44] it to us. It's here for us, but we've
[41:47] got to take advantage of that. Maybe
[41:48] we'll understand that a little bit
[41:50] better tonight. But brother Brandham uh
[41:54] teaches us that that the will was
[41:56] revealed. But what what do we struggle
[41:58] with, church? We we struggle with God's
[42:01] will to us as individuals,
[42:05] &gt;&gt; right? So there's a mystery of God's
[42:06] will to the church. And I think most of
[42:08] us would say, we understand that
[42:10] tonight. We He said, "Brother Ben, I
[42:12] understand that we're in the Leoian
[42:14] church age. I understand that the
[42:16] rapture is coming. I understand that
[42:18] there are certain things that have to
[42:19] happen and Malachi 4 was to take place
[42:22] and all of those things and those things
[42:24] have happened in our time, but what
[42:26] about God's will for me as an
[42:28] individual? What does God want me to do?
[42:31] How does he want to place me? What does
[42:33] where does he want me to be? What does
[42:34] he want me to do?" And that's something
[42:36] that has to be revealed to the
[42:38] individual. And yet it's found in the
[42:40] word of God. But Brandon said this about
[42:43] the seals. He said the book doesn't say
[42:45] now Lee Vale is to be saved in time of
[42:48] this church age or Arman Neville or
[42:50] whoever. So in other words, he said the
[42:52] book that the lamb had in his hand in
[42:54] Revelation 5 was a book of names, right?
[42:57] It was a book of names and yet it didn't
[42:59] say Benjamin Puit in it. But what it
[43:01] said it had my identity in it.
[43:04] So the name had to actually be revealed
[43:07] to me,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; right? The my name would not be revealed
[43:11] to the age. The mystery would be
[43:14] revealed to the age and then my name
[43:17] would be revealed to me personally. So
[43:20] the book doesn't say our name Lee or
[43:23] Manval. He said it don't say that. It
[43:25] just shows the mystery unfolds the
[43:28] mystery of what the thing is. But we
[43:31] ourselves,
[43:32] &gt;&gt; yes,
[43:33] &gt;&gt; ourselves. You You say, "Brother Ben,
[43:35] it's not important that we understand
[43:37] these things. Why don't you preach
[43:38] something easier for us?" No, it is
[43:40] important that we understand. It's
[43:42] important that we get into the word.
[43:43] It's important that we believe the
[43:45] message OF THE HOUR BECAUSE IN THAT
[43:47] MESSAGE IS WHERE the where the
[43:48] revelation of the will of God for us is.
[43:52] That's where we find and hear our name.
[43:54] THAT'S WHAT CALLS US FROM ONE DIMENSION
[43:57] to another. Did you realize that? IT'S
[43:59] THE OPENING OF THE SEALS THAT CALLS US
[44:02] FROM THIS DIMENSION TO another
[44:04] dimension.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. The book being open AND WE SEE
[44:08] OURSELVES THERE.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; SO, so Peter's got to be seen in the
[44:12] book, RIGHT? JOEL'S GOT TO BE SE EVERY
[44:14] ONE OF YOU GOT TO BE SEEN IN THE BOOK.
[44:16] And and I can't see your name there.
[44:18] You've got to see your name there.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Okay? Is that simple enough for us
[44:23] tonight? IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING I SEE.
[44:25] I'VE GOT TO BE SURE MYSELF. WE ourselves
[44:28] by faith believe it.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; We ourselves by faith believe it. Now we
[44:34] know his will is his word. How many
[44:38] believe that tonight?
[44:40] &gt;&gt; The will of God is the word of God.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Someone say, "Well, I wish I knew
[44:45] whether uh it was God's will for me to
[44:47] go to church." Well, the will of God is
[44:49] the word of God.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; I wish I knew if it was the will of God
[44:53] for me to uh be healed. The will of God
[44:56] is the word of God.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now,
[45:00] &gt;&gt; now let's take a specific example and as
[45:04] it relates to healing, I know several
[45:05] have been sick lately. There's laying
[45:07] hands on the sick. How many believe in
[45:09] that?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Why do we believe in that? Because the
[45:12] word says to do it. Mark 16:18 said they
[45:15] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[45:16] any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
[45:18] them. They shall lay hands on the sick
[45:21] and they shall recover. So there's
[45:24] someone who will lay hands. There's
[45:25] someone who will recover. And the
[45:28] message of the hour reveals to us that
[45:30] this is his will for today. So that's
[45:31] what the message does. It doesn't change
[45:33] the Bible. It applies it. Right.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Right. So brother Random come because
[45:38] there were men who come along and said,
[45:39] "Well, Mark 16 either wasn't inspired.
[45:42] It wasn't part of the original text or
[45:44] it just doesn't apply to us. It was only
[45:46] for the disciples." But a prophet come
[45:48] in our day and said, "Jesus Christ the
[45:51] same yesterday, today, and forever."
[45:53] Aren't you glad he's an ontime God?
[45:55] Aren't you glad he's A CURRENT GOD? NOT
[45:57] JUST A God of yesterday.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; So the message reveals to us that laying
[46:01] on of hands on the sick is his will for
[46:04] today. I know there's people don't
[46:05] believe in prayer lines now and don't
[46:06] believe in laying hands on the sick and
[46:08] say, "Well, that's for another day.
[46:09] That's for that's not for Gentiles."
[46:11] Brother Brandham did say that it was a
[46:13] gentile way was to just believe. But
[46:15] brother Brandham, never quit having
[46:17] prayer lines. Why? Because we still live
[46:19] in bodies of flesh. We we still live in
[46:22] a in a body and with a mind that's
[46:24] fighting US CONSTANTLY. AND SO MANY
[46:26] TIMES, SOMETIMES WE CAN JUST BELIEVE
[46:28] WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD and we CAN BE
[46:30] HEALED. OTHER TIMES, WE NEED HANDS LAID
[46:32] on us.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed of that, church. You
[46:35] say, "Well, I'm sick and I don't want TO
[46:37] CALL." NO. CALL FOR THE ELDERS OF THE
[46:38] CHURCH. THE BIBLE SAYS to do it
[46:43] &gt;&gt; and lay hands on the sick and they shall
[46:44] recover.
[46:46] So, Brother Brandham lets us know that's
[46:48] okay for today. He places that in this
[46:51] age,
[46:53] &gt;&gt; right? So, he said, "Somebody jumped on
[46:55] me kind of rough about that this
[46:57] morning. Said there's no such thing as
[46:58] people laying on hands on one another.
[46:59] It shouldn't be done." I said, "You just
[47:01] haven't read the Bible, brother. That's
[47:04] all." Paul, I said the last commission
[47:05] that fell from the lips of Jesus Christ
[47:07] was lay hands on the sick and they shall
[47:09] recover. He said his first commission
[47:11] when he gave his disciples was heal the
[47:13] sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the
[47:15] dead, cast out devils.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; He said the first group he sent out, the
[47:18] last group he set out, these signs shall
[47:19] follow them that believe that cast out
[47:21] devils, speak with new tongues, take up
[47:23] serpents, drink deadly things. If they
[47:25] lay their hands on the sick, they shall
[47:26] recover. He said that's the last words
[47:28] he said and was received up into glory.
[47:30] Certainly, he said that's the great
[47:32] commission. I love the way brother
[47:34] Brandon puts this. He just believes the
[47:35] word. He said, "What it does, I don't
[47:38] know."
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [snorts]
[47:39] &gt;&gt; That's pretty good, isn't it? He said,
[47:41] "I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LAYING ON HANDS
[47:42] DOES." He said, "But it does something
[47:44] because it's in the word." HE SAID,
[47:45] "IT'S JUST CARRYING OUT WHAT HE SAID,
[47:47] DO."
[47:50] &gt;&gt; SO, the Bible says to do it. The the
[47:52] messenger says it's for our age. But
[47:54] now, if you're one laying on hands or
[47:56] having hands laid on you, that's got to
[47:58] become a revelation to you.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's the will of God for the
[48:03] age. It's it's the will of God in the
[48:05] Bible. It's the will of God for the age.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; And it's got to become the will of God
[48:09] for your life.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what healing is.
[48:12] Brother Brandham taught us that faith is
[48:14] a revelation. Faith is a revelation of
[48:17] the will of God for our lives. God said,
[48:19] "I'm healed." Right? And and by faith,
[48:21] we appropriate that. And it's a revealed
[48:24] to us that I am healed. Not just that
[48:26] healing is for today. Because we could
[48:29] look at that and say, "Well, so and so
[48:30] could be healed or or this person could
[48:32] be healed or that person." But when we
[48:34] appropriate that faith for us as
[48:36] individuals and we say, "Lord, I believe
[48:38] I am healed.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm the one who can have hands
[48:41] laid on me and be healed." How many
[48:43] BELIEVE IT TONIGHT? I BELIEVE I'M THE
[48:45] ONES THAT GET ONE THAT CAN hear the word
[48:46] AND BE HEALED. I BELIEVE I'M THE ONE
[48:48] THAT CAN THAT CAN TAKE advantage of the
[48:50] fact that the atonement was a dual
[48:52] atonement for salvation and for healing.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So if we believe that then we
[48:59] can take advantage of it. It becomes it
[49:00] has to become a revelation for
[49:02] ourselves. That's why many people will
[49:04] struggle at it and struggle at it and
[49:06] maybe go up to be prayed for over and
[49:08] over again. But R we have faith but not
[49:10] perfect faith because what happens is
[49:13] many times which it's just we just have
[49:15] a hard time believing it's for us. But
[49:17] we need to know a revelation of the will
[49:19] of God for our life that the word of God
[49:23] is true for us. Now, we know that when
[49:25] it comes to the scriptures, when it
[49:27] comes to your what you're supposed to
[49:28] do, who you're supposed to be, who
[49:31] you're supposed to marry, right? It's
[49:33] the will of God for many people to be
[49:35] married.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? But not everybody.
[49:40] Do you know that? That's what the Bible
[49:41] says. It's the will of God for some
[49:43] people to be married. So, if I know I'm
[49:46] right with the word of God, but the
[49:47] Bible doesn't say who to marry. That's
[49:49] got to be a revelation of the will of
[49:51] God
[49:52] &gt;&gt; for you.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Lord knows you need that revelation.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; If you're going to live with that person
[49:58] for 50 years,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; right? That's got to be a revelation of
[50:02] the will of God to your heart.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; Let it be a revelation before you say,
[50:07] "I do." Right?
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Before you make a promise, let that be a
[50:10] revelation in your heart. My wife knew
[50:12] even before I knew. But it was a
[50:14] revelation to her. She knew I was her
[50:16] husband. THERE COME A TIME I KNEW SHE
[50:18] was my wife,
[50:20] &gt;&gt; right? But it had to be a revelation. It
[50:22] can't be somebody else says, the pastor
[50:23] says, people say you look good together.
[50:25] I don't know why I'm getting off on
[50:26] that, but it can't be any of that. It's
[50:28] got to be a revelation for you that you
[50:30] know, and then nothing will be able to
[50:32] shake that. When you have a revelation
[50:34] of who your wife is, who your husband
[50:36] is, there's nothing that can shake that.
[50:38] They may they may do some bad things.
[50:40] THEY MAY GO SOME THERE MAY BE SOME TIMES
[50:42] YOU DISAGREE. YOU MAY HAVE TO FIGHT FOR
[50:44] YOUR MARRIAGE, BUT YOU WILL FIGHT FOR IT
[50:46] BECAUSE YOU GOT A REVELATION. THIS IS
[50:48] THE WILL OF GOD FOR my life.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[50:53] &gt;&gt; SAME THING APPLIES TO A CHURCH. YOU GO
[50:54] TO A CHURCH and say, "Well, I'm not sure
[50:56] if I should be there, if I should be
[50:57] over there." BUT WHEN YOU GET A
[50:59] REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD THAT SAYS,
[51:00] "I KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE, AND
[51:03] I'M RIGHT WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE."
[51:04] ANYTHING. NO MATTER WHAT COMES BY, IT'S
[51:06] NOT GOING TO SHAKE YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW
[51:08] YOU'RE WHERE GOD PUTS YOU.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Preachers have to have that. YOU GOT TO
[51:12] HAVE A A REVELATION OF THE WILL OF GOD
[51:15] FOR YOUR LIFE. LORD, REVEAL THAT TO ME.
[51:17] I CAN'T DO THAT FOR SOMEBODY, BUT God
[51:19] can do it for you tonight.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And by studying the word, reading
[51:24] the word, listening to the word, and
[51:26] then let God reveal that word, make it
[51:29] personal to you where you're supposed to
[51:31] be, what you're supposed to do.
[51:33] So faith is a revelation makes the word
[51:36] of God present tense. Brother Brandham
[51:38] said now he said it is not just a little
[51:40] thing.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; He said it's a mystery.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; God's will is a mystery and each man has
[51:48] to seek out the will of God for his or
[51:52] her self.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Right? So even our sisters, you're not
[51:57] exempt from that.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Right? You're not a lesser. When it
[52:01] comes to the kingdom of God, there's no
[52:03] male or female, no bond or you
[52:05] understand, right? When it comes to
[52:07] these things, you you you got to seek,
[52:09] well, my husband knows the will of God.
[52:11] You've got to know the will of God,
[52:14] &gt;&gt; right? The will of God for your healing,
[52:15] the will of God for your salvation, the
[52:17] will of God for the salvation of your
[52:19] children, the will of God for where you
[52:21] go to church and what you do and and how
[52:23] you help out around that. All the things
[52:25] that you do for your for your job as a
[52:28] mother. Oh church, listen. How much
[52:31] better mothers would there be if if
[52:33] mothers would have a will have a
[52:35] revelation of the will of God? This is
[52:36] what I'm supposed to do. THIS IS MY
[52:38] HIGHEST CALLING. THIS IS WHAT I'M
[52:40] SUPPOSED to be. I if if FATHERS WOULD
[52:42] HAVE A WILL, A WILL, A REVELATION of the
[52:44] will OF GOD. I'M SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE
[52:46] OF MY CHILDREN. I'M SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE
[52:49] FOR MY FAMILY. YOU NEED YOU'VE READ THE
[52:51] WORD OF GOD. YOU NEED A REVELATION OF
[52:52] THE WILL of God.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, each one of us has a part to
[53:01] play. And brother Brandon says we have
[53:03] to seek out the will of God for
[53:04] ourselves.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; You have a part to play. And that
[53:08] specific part that only you can play
[53:12] &gt;&gt; can only be revealed to you as an
[53:14] individual.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Right now, we're teaching tonight, but
[53:17] you just hang with me for a little bit
[53:19] and we'll get through it. I got a plane
[53:21] to catch. We're going to leave at 3:00
[53:23] in the morning around that time. So, so
[53:26] I won't I won't be long. I promise you,
[53:30] you know, if you were if you've ever
[53:32] read a play, if you ever been in a play
[53:34] in high school or the Christmas play
[53:36] they had last year at the church, you
[53:38] know, there was different parts written
[53:40] specifically for different kids,
[53:42] [snorts] written specifically for for a
[53:45] certain person, certain character. But
[53:47] when if you read it without knowing what
[53:49] part you were playing, it wouldn't make
[53:50] a whole lot of sense to you, right?
[53:53] Because you you you can't do it all,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; right? You can't do it all. That's a
[53:57] revelation some of us ought to get,
[53:59] right?
[54:00] &gt;&gt; You can't do it all. Let other people do
[54:02] their job. You do your job.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; But in in reading a play, you you see
[54:08] your name there. And when you if you
[54:10] know that, so you you might see this is
[54:12] supposed to be Julius Caesar, right?
[54:15] Julius Caesar says uh you two Brutus. I
[54:20] don't remember the Latin, but Gabe,
[54:21] forgive me. But you know, uh, he's he's
[54:25] the one that says that, right? He's
[54:27] supposed to say that. But if I don't
[54:29] know that I'm playing Julius Caesar,
[54:31] that doesn't do me any good.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; But if I can put my name there.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[54:38] &gt;&gt; THEN I CAN PLAY MY PART BECAUSE I KNOW I
[54:40] THAT'S WHO I'm supposed to be. So the
[54:43] the the Bible tells us the preacher is
[54:45] supposed to do this. The song leaders
[54:47] are or worship is supposed to be this
[54:49] way. Let's put it like that. This is how
[54:51] we should worship. this is how we should
[54:53] sing. But the random teaches us all
[54:55] kinds of things like that. But there's
[54:56] got to be something that applies that to
[54:58] us. How where do we put our name there?
[55:00] It's got to be a revelation to the
[55:02] individual. So the director has got to
[55:05] tell you which part you play. And there
[55:08] is a portion of this word that speaks of
[55:11] you as an individual, but you got to
[55:13] have a a personal revelation of that.
[55:15] Listen, there come a time, I think I've
[55:17] told you this before, BUT THERE COME A
[55:19] TIME WHEN I SAW MYSELF, not not in a
[55:21] literal vision, but just in my in my
[55:23] heart, I COULD SEE MYSELF AS ONE OF
[55:26] THOSE WHO CRIED OUT, ONE OF THE MILLIONS
[55:28] WHO CRIED OUT. WE'RE RESTING ON THAT.
[55:30] AND ONCE YOU'VE SEEN YOURSELF IN THAT
[55:32] NUMBER, YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE
[55:34] MESSAGE. YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE THINGS
[55:36] THAT WE BELIEVE. WHY? YOU'VE ALREADY
[55:38] PLACED YOURSELF THERE. YOU'RE NOT JUST
[55:40] PLACING YOURSELF AS A PREACHER, NOT JUST
[55:42] PLACING YOURSELF AS A SINGER, BUT YOU'RE
[55:44] PLACING YOURSELF IN THAT NUMBER
[55:47] &gt;&gt; IN THE AMONG that group that receives
[55:49] THE WORD OF GOD FOR THE HOUR.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; SO, it's almost as IF I CAN SEE MY FACE
[55:53] THERE. YOU GOT TO BE ABLE TO SEE
[55:54] YOURSELF there and and recognize that
[55:57] THAT'S WHO YOU ARE. SEE YOURSELF IN THE
[56:00] WORD OF GOD. SEE YOURSELF AS HEALED. See
[56:02] yourself as saved.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's harder for some people than
[56:06] others, but God will GIVE YOU GRACE TO
[56:08] HAVE A REVELATION. YOU SAY, "WELL, MY
[56:10] PAST IS VERY DARK." BUT YOU GOT TO SEE
[56:12] YOURSELF AS THE CHILDREN of God.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, so the message teaches us
[56:20] that we were in God before the
[56:22] foundation of the world. So if we were
[56:24] in God, we were part of God. That means
[56:26] we're part of his plan.
[56:30] So
[56:31] you know, if you're too critical of
[56:32] yourself, you're being a little bit
[56:33] critical of God.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Right. You can get to a point where you
[56:38] just criticize yourself and you're down
[56:40] on yourself and and and all of that and
[56:43] you you just don't understand that.
[56:45] Especially our young people, they they
[56:47] they're so critical of themselves and
[56:49] sometimes we feed into that by being
[56:50] critical of them as well. But I'll say
[56:52] this that we we shouldn't do that
[56:54] because that's a son or daughter of God.
[56:56] They just don't know what their life's
[56:58] going to be yet. But but it's in God's
[57:00] mind. They were in the mind of God
[57:02] before the foundation of the earth. And
[57:05] brother Joel preached on that the other
[57:06] day. If if the word was God, brother
[57:09] Brandham says, "Then you were in God."
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Right. And he said the word, the part
[57:14] that you're to play was in God before
[57:19] the foundation of the world.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; See, this is bigger than just learning
[57:24] how to do something and doing it. Come
[57:26] on.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; But it's actually having a revelation of
[57:29] the will of God that I WAS PUT HERE FOR
[57:33] THIS season and for this purpose.
[57:35] Listen, I think it ought to go deeper
[57:36] than just the preacher. I think it ought
[57:38] to go deeper than the deacons. I think
[57:39] IT OUGHT TO GO FURTHER THAN THE TRUSTEES
[57:41] and the officers of the church. IT OUGHT
[57:43] TO GO FURTHER EVEN THAN THE MUSICIANS.
[57:45] IT OUGHT TO GO DOWN TO EVERY PERSON
[57:47] SITTING THERE THAT SAYS, "I KNOW I WAS
[57:49] PUT HERE FOR A REASON. I WAS PUT HERE TO
[57:51] BE AN ENCOURAGEMENT. I WAS PUT HERE TO
[57:54] DO SOMETHING FOR THE LORD. I WAS PUT
[57:56] HERE TO CLAP MY HANDS IN THE SERVICE. I
[57:58] WAS PUT HERE. AND YOU GOT A REVELATION
[57:59] of that. And you say, I'M NOT JUST HERE
[58:02] TO BENEFIT FROM THE WORD. I WAS PUT HERE
[58:04] AS PART OF THE WORD IN THE PLAN OF God
[58:07] for this age.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; So then, right,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; my testimony means something.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ARE YOU WITH ME NOW?
[58:16] &gt;&gt; MY TESTIMONY MEANS SOMETHING. MY
[58:18] SUFFERINGS HAVE A PURPOSE. MY TRIAL THAT
[58:21] I'M GOING THROUGH HAS GOT AN END TO IT.
[58:22] THERE'S LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
[58:24] BECAUSE I KNOW I was put here. But
[58:26] before the foundation of the world in
[58:28] the mind of God, he placed me where I
[58:30] am.
[58:31] Now, brother Brandham says nothing's out
[58:33] of cater. He said if the word was was
[58:35] God, then you were in God. The word, the
[58:38] part that you're to play was in God
[58:40] before the foundation of the world. He
[58:41] seen you. He knew you.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I take comfort in this, Brother
[58:46] Stewart. He predestined predestinated
[58:49] you to it.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Brother Brandham even calls the
[58:54] the five-fold ministry. He said, "Those
[58:55] are predestined gifts of God."
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Right? What is that? He predestinated
[59:01] you to it. He said, "I tell you, and and
[59:04] more than that, we are all predestinated
[59:06] to the message of the hour."
[59:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "I tell you, just as that eagle
[59:10] recognize that voice, so does a real
[59:13] born again Christian recognize the voice
[59:16] of God speaking through the word when
[59:18] they see it anointed and a vindicated."
[59:20] WHY? IT'S THE WORD SPEAKING TO THE WORD.
[59:22] THEY'RE PART OF THAT WORD.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; LOOK, he said he looked up there talking
[59:27] about the little chicken. He said he
[59:28] didn't see his old hen cluck cluck
[59:30] around here, join us and go over here
[59:32] and go to this and go to this and that.
[59:34] He saw a being like he wanted to be.
[59:38] See, this word didn't come to us in word
[59:40] only and letter only. Right. It come to
[59:42] us in a in a way that we could we could
[59:45] hear it, we could feel it, we could see
[59:47] it.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Right. And when when when when oh my
[59:52] when the eagle screamed, it was uh IT
[59:55] WAS NOT A DISEMBODIED VOICE.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; BUT IT SCREAMED THROUGH A PROPHET.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; AND WE SAW HOW GOD WAS WITH HIM IN HIS
[1:00:04] MISTAKES.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, IF GOD WOULD BE WITH HIM,
[1:00:07] LIKE JOSHUA DID TO MOSES, IF GOD WOULD
[1:00:09] BE WITH HIM IN HIS MISTAKES, GOD WILL BE
[1:00:11] WITH ME IN MY MISTAKES.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD SPOKE THROUGH A PROPHET IN
[1:00:15] OUR DAY. AND THAT EAGLE CRY, IT SCREAMED
[1:00:18] OUT TO US. AND WE DIDN'T HEAR THE CLUCK
[1:00:20] OF THE hymn that said, "Go to this AND
[1:00:21] THAT." HE SAW A BEING LIKE HE WANTED TO
[1:00:24] BE SAILING IN THE AIR, SCREAMING FREE UP
[1:00:26] IN THE HEIGHTS ABOVE ALL THE VULTURES
[1:00:28] AND THINGS OF THE EARTH. LISTEN, YOU
[1:00:30] MIGHT BE TROUBLED TONIGHT. YOU MIGHT
[1:00:31] HAVE STRUGGLES IN YOUR LIFE. YOU MIGHT
[1:00:33] BE GETTING OLDER AND FIGHTING YOUR OWN
[1:00:35] BODY. YOU MIGHT BE FIGHTING DEPRESSION
[1:00:37] OR ANXIETY. BUT REMEMBER, THERE WAS A
[1:00:39] SCREAM IN OUR DAY. AND YOU CAN YOU SEEN
[1:00:42] SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO BE. I KNOW
[1:00:44] A GOD WHO DELIVERS. I KNOW A GOD WHO
[1:00:46] HEALS. I KNOW A GOD. I'VE SEEN HIM
[1:00:49] OPERATE IN A HUMAN BODY.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wanted to be that because
[1:00:58] it was in him to be that.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:01:04] We were not born [sighs] just to
[1:01:07] struggle. We were born to overcome.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; We were not born JUST TO BE SICK. But
[1:01:13] before there WAS EVER ANY SICKNESS, GOD
[1:01:15] WAS A HEALER.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He wanted to be that because
[1:01:20] it was in him to be that. And a man
[1:01:23] that's born of God, a son of God, has to
[1:01:24] have the nature of God. He has to be
[1:01:26] like God. He honors God. He's part of
[1:01:29] the word of God. And in this last days
[1:01:32] of this bride taking form, just exactly
[1:01:35] the same power that he was in at the
[1:01:37] beginning. I love that. has come up
[1:01:40] through these organizations and so forth
[1:01:42] and come out for the bride. He can't be
[1:01:44] nothing else but that.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:49] See, you know,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; and I think some of us are waiting on
[1:01:55] something great for the will of God to
[1:01:58] be revealed to us. What we need to do is
[1:01:59] is desire that, to want that. Say,
[1:02:03] "Lord, reveal your will to me. I want
[1:02:05] your will to be revealed in my life.
[1:02:09] I was uh Tuesday or Monday, I think it
[1:02:12] was Monday, I was up at West Plains and
[1:02:14] and I spoke with Sister Fritz and I was
[1:02:19] talking to her and she's not here
[1:02:20] tonight, so I want to embarrass her. But
[1:02:23] Sister Fritz, as you know, is frail in
[1:02:25] her body, very, very weak. She's 92
[1:02:26] years old.
[1:02:27] And but sister Fritz had something
[1:02:30] interesting happen in her life that
[1:02:32] intrigues me a lot and that's that she
[1:02:34] had a big part to play in transcribing
[1:02:36] the sermons of brother Brandham it to
[1:02:39] where we could read them and that was a
[1:02:41] big deal. you does anybody if you've
[1:02:43] ever listened to a realtore tape or or
[1:02:45] an unfiltered tape then you know and
[1:02:47] that's really before my time but we had
[1:02:49] them still around and and you know what
[1:02:51] that was like
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and somebody had to take that off of the
[1:02:54] tape and put it in a book form now most
[1:02:57] of us don't read the books anymore we
[1:02:59] read on the app right or we listen to it
[1:03:01] because it's readily available but
[1:03:03] people didn't have that and the books
[1:03:05] were much cheaper it was much cheaper to
[1:03:06] buy a book than it was to buy a tape
[1:03:09] right and you could spread it overseas
[1:03:10] you could you could translate it
[1:03:12] quicker.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; So, it was a big part of the message
[1:03:14] being being getting out to the world,
[1:03:16] which had to happen before we go home,
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; right? A big part of that was people
[1:03:21] taking that message and transcribing
[1:03:23] into English,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; right? And listening to it and
[1:03:26] transcribing it. And so, I'm sitting
[1:03:28] there talking to her and you know, she
[1:03:31] told me something interesting. She said,
[1:03:33] you know, she said, I when I started
[1:03:35] doing that, she'd become friends with
[1:03:37] brother David Mamelis and she started
[1:03:39] doing that. It was a long-distance sort
[1:03:40] of thing. when she started, she was
[1:03:42] writing it. So, she actually wrote it
[1:03:45] and and then because she didn't know how
[1:03:47] to type.
[1:03:49] So, she's writing it and and they sent
[1:03:52] her a word processor. Well, she didn't
[1:03:53] know anything about a word processor.
[1:03:54] She had to learn how to use it cuz
[1:03:56] Sister Fritz worked in a factory
[1:03:59] and and and so she didn't know. She
[1:04:01] didn't work in an office. And and and
[1:04:04] she was want to learn how to type. And
[1:04:06] she asked Sister Mameless about it and
[1:04:08] she said something about to the effect
[1:04:09] of, "Well, you'd have to go to school to
[1:04:11] learn how to type." And Sister Fritz
[1:04:13] said she'd read where Corey Tinboom
[1:04:14] secretary was a nurse and didn't have to
[1:04:17] learn how to type. So she said, "You
[1:04:19] know what? If she could learn how to
[1:04:20] type, teach herself how to type, then I
[1:04:22] can teach myself how to type." AND SO
[1:04:25] SHE TAUGHT HERSELF TO TYPE FOR THE
[1:04:28] PURPOSE OF getting the message out.
[1:04:31] I don't know if Sister Fritz realized it
[1:04:33] because so many times she's told me
[1:04:34] this. She said, "I I just feel so
[1:04:36] useless because she's unable to do those
[1:04:38] things like she used to do." And she
[1:04:40] ended up transcribing sermons for people
[1:04:42] and doing things for that that spread
[1:04:44] the message all over the all over the
[1:04:45] world really. And and and asked her how
[1:04:48] many she did, she would do a sermon in a
[1:04:50] couple of days. And so she would have
[1:04:52] while she was working full-time and and
[1:04:55] she said probably hundreds of the
[1:04:58] sermons that we have now, she was maybe
[1:04:59] the first one probably the first one to
[1:05:02] put them on to onto book form. I'm not
[1:05:05] lifting up Sister Fritz. I want you to
[1:05:06] understand I want you young people to
[1:05:08] understand what you do matters.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I don't I'm not I
[1:05:12] don't know how to do it." Some of y'all,
[1:05:14] you know, I didn't know how to set up
[1:05:16] certain things when we were brother
[1:05:17] Ivy's. I didn't know how to set up a
[1:05:19] stream, but it was on my heart to do it.
[1:05:20] And so we set up a stream for their
[1:05:22] church and and we set up where they
[1:05:24] would stream. They recorded their
[1:05:25] services on DVD and we set it up where
[1:05:27] it would stream. I taught myself to do
[1:05:29] that. I didn't realize I would need that
[1:05:31] when we came here because co shut us
[1:05:34] down. But God has a way of preparing
[1:05:36] you,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND IT DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
[1:05:39] A PREACHER TO DO THAT.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You don't have to
[1:05:42] be a preacher TO LEARN HOW TO TYPE OR TO
[1:05:45] LEARN HOW TO do media or LEARN HOW TO
[1:05:47] LEARN HOW TO HELP THE SUNDAY SCHOOL OR
[1:05:49] LEARN HOW TO ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? LEARN
[1:05:51] HOW TO RUN A CAMERA. AND PEOPLE DON'T
[1:05:53] REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE of that because
[1:05:55] we're living in a day and AGE WHERE
[1:05:56] THERE'S A FAMINE FOR THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:05:58] AND I SAY LET THE WORD OF GOD BE
[1:05:59] PROCLAIMED FROM THIS PULPIT ALL OVER THE
[1:06:01] EARTH IF GOD WILL ALLOW US TO do it.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; We can do it in a reasonable way where
[1:06:05] we don't have to pull for money and beg
[1:06:07] for money.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Right? And I know my primary
[1:06:10] responsibility is to you as a church,
[1:06:12] but I believe there's there's THERE'S
[1:06:14] SEED OF GOD SOMEWHERE OUT THERE AND
[1:06:16] MAYBE THEY'LL HEAR IT AND BELIEVE IT. I
[1:06:18] don't want to hide our light behind A
[1:06:19] BUSHEL. I I DON'T WANT TO BECOME A
[1:06:21] BASKET CASE, AS WE TALKED ABOUT, HIDING
[1:06:23] OFF SOMEWHERE. I WANT TO BE SOMEBODY
[1:06:25] WHO'S WILLING TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL. WE
[1:06:27] SHOULD NOT BE ASHAMED OF WHAT WE PREACH.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY QUALIFICATION YOU
[1:06:35] NEED IS JUST TO BE WILLING.
[1:06:40] I REMEMBER THE first time I WENT
[1:06:41] OVERSEAS. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A
[1:06:43] MISSIONARY. I'm still not a missionary,
[1:06:44] BUT I WENT OVERSEAS AND AND I STRUGGLED
[1:06:47] WITH THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO.
[1:06:48] IT'S NOT WHAT I'M GOOD AT. This is where
[1:06:51] I feel comfortable is right HERE IN THIS
[1:06:53] PULPIT PREACHING TO YOU. BUT WHEN I WENT
[1:06:55] OVERSEAS, BUT GOD HAS USED THAT. I've
[1:06:57] seen him use that. I've seen miracles
[1:06:59] happen cuz somebody WAS WILLING TO GO.
[1:07:02] LISTEN, SOMETIMES THE ONLY QUALIFICATION
[1:07:04] YOU NEED IS JUST TO BE WILLING. LORD,
[1:07:06] LET LET YOUR WILL BE REVEALED TO ME. AND
[1:07:10] MAYBE THAT WILL IS NOT STANDING IN A
[1:07:11] PULPIT. MAYBE IT'S NOT PREACHING THE
[1:07:13] WORD. MAYBE IT'S SUPPORTING THE WORD.
[1:07:14] MAYBE IT'S GETTING A GOOD JOB SO YOU CAN
[1:07:16] YOU CAN HELP WITH THE FINANCES. MAYBE
[1:07:18] IT'S DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT LET
[1:07:19] IT BE HIS will and not your will.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talked about Peter and
[1:07:29] the wolf. I said I wasn't going to hold
[1:07:30] you long and get off on a tangent like
[1:07:32] that, but I think that's important.
[1:07:36] Yeah.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; I I want us I challenged the older young
[1:07:39] people in Ohio when we were at the camp
[1:07:42] this year and I was grateful to be able
[1:07:43] to speak to some of the 21 and up club
[1:07:46] there and they have a group of about 60
[1:07:48] kids and I challenged them with that
[1:07:51] story about Sister Fritz and I didn't
[1:07:54] know all the details that I heard from
[1:07:56] her yesterday or Monday but I challenged
[1:07:59] them with that because I said you can do
[1:08:01] something for the message. It's time you
[1:08:04] turn around. The message been good to
[1:08:05] you. You've been to youth camp after
[1:08:06] youth camp after youth camp. And people
[1:08:08] have been coming and telling you you're
[1:08:10] going to make it. And preachers have
[1:08:11] been preaching their guts out telling
[1:08:13] you you're going to MAKE IT. BUT AT SOME
[1:08:15] POINT, YOU GOT to turn around and say,
[1:08:16] "Hey, I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE
[1:08:18] MESSAGE. I'M GOING I'M GOING TO LIVE FOR
[1:08:19] THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING TO I'M I'M GOING
[1:08:21] TO PUBLISH IT. I'M GOING TO DO
[1:08:22] EVERYTHING I CAN." LISTEN, it was THERE
[1:08:25] WAS SOME WHO WERE CALLED TO GIVE THE
[1:08:26] WORD. BUT THE BIBLE SAYS, "GREAT WAS THE
[1:08:28] COMPANY of those who published it."
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Good.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; So, but brother Brandham typed it to
[1:08:35] Peter and the Wolf. How that you know if
[1:08:37] you've ever heard that, how many of you
[1:08:38] kids have ever seen listen to Peter and
[1:08:41] the Wolf or watched it?
[1:08:43] Parents, what are we doing?
[1:08:46] Peter and the Wolf is a is a play. You
[1:08:50] can watch it on YouTube. It's a play and
[1:08:53] it's musical. It's very fun and funny.
[1:08:56] In fact, they made a cartoon, too, if
[1:08:58] that helps. You know, that's what I
[1:09:00] watched, but
[1:09:03] But you can actually watch the orchestra
[1:09:04] version of it, too. And if you go watch
[1:09:06] it, you can see all the different
[1:09:07] instruments and the sounds they make.
[1:09:08] There's an instrument for the duck and
[1:09:10] an instrument for the uh for the wolf
[1:09:12] and different different instruments they
[1:09:14] use for the hunters. And each one it
[1:09:15] builds tension and drama. It's very
[1:09:17] important. So you guys go home and not
[1:09:19] tonight, but later go watch that and and
[1:09:24] uh let's give you permission to watch
[1:09:26] YouTube there, you know, if your parents
[1:09:27] allow it. But
[1:09:31] there's something important in that and
[1:09:32] that's that each part makes a
[1:09:34] difference.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Right. So there's there's a guy standing
[1:09:37] over there and I've always, you know,
[1:09:38] there's one guy plays symbols, right?
[1:09:41] And he's got them great big symbols.
[1:09:43] He's just standing there the whole time
[1:09:45] and he's just waiting and crash at the
[1:09:47] right time. You know, he plays there's a
[1:09:49] there's actually a [snorts] a symphony
[1:09:52] that was written where they had cannon,
[1:09:54] real cannon in the symphony. And if they
[1:09:58] at a certain point them cannons were
[1:10:00] just standing there at a certain point
[1:10:01] the cannons go off and that's all them
[1:10:04] guys do is light the cannon but without
[1:10:06] them there's nothing to the symphony. It
[1:10:08] doesn't have the same effect without
[1:10:10] live cannon. They found that out. So
[1:10:12] there's a there's something about the
[1:10:15] way the music is written that involves
[1:10:18] everybody in the orchestra. So brother
[1:10:20] Brandham talked about that and how
[1:10:22] people were trying to give a note that
[1:10:23] hit back in the days of Luther and
[1:10:25] Wesley. He said like that when actually
[1:10:27] the music sheet here shows that it's
[1:10:29] another day. So what is that? A
[1:10:31] revelation of the will of God. So when
[1:10:33] the composer gives it to the director,
[1:10:35] then the director can look at it and
[1:10:37] say, "Well, this was for another day,
[1:10:39] but this is for today."
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Right? So you got to have your timing
[1:10:43] right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; In the music, you've got to have your
[1:10:46] timing. Isn't that right, musicians? You
[1:10:47] got to have the timing. You can be ever
[1:10:49] so good, but if you don't know timing,
[1:10:51] you get in trouble.
[1:10:53] So the entire reason we have a bass and
[1:10:55] drums is to keep the time right.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Right. That's to keep the music flowing,
[1:11:00] keep the time right. So now look, so he
[1:11:03] said the music sheet shows us another
[1:11:04] day. We can't live in the light of
[1:11:05] Luther. He was a reformer. We appreciate
[1:11:08] his part, but we played that out. WE'RE
[1:11:11] WAY OVER HERE AT THE BACK of the book
[1:11:13] now. We can't play it out like that. And
[1:11:16] he goes into that and he talks about how
[1:11:17] the director must get in the same spirit
[1:11:19] as the composer, the one who wrote it.
[1:11:21] He said, "Then when they say the days of
[1:11:23] miracles is passed, they don't hit the
[1:11:24] right note." But when it gets in the
[1:11:26] right swing of it and the right spirit
[1:11:27] of it, he said, "How you going to do it
[1:11:29] until the spirit comes down of the
[1:11:31] composer?" He said, "Then when you say
[1:11:33] the days of miracles never pass, the
[1:11:35] symphony cries out, amen." When we hit
[1:11:38] and say Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[1:11:40] today, and forever, the symphony cries
[1:11:42] out, "Amen. You shall receive power
[1:11:44] after this. The Holy Ghost has come UPON
[1:11:45] YOU." THE SYMPHONY CRIES.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen's your part. I got it. He said,
[1:11:50] "THERE'S NO MORE GUESSWORK ABOUT IT."
[1:11:52] THEN HE SAID, "THE WHOLE SYMPHONY IS
[1:11:54] RIGHT IN HARMONY WITH THE WORD." HE
[1:11:56] SAID, "IT'S GOING." And he clapped his
[1:11:58] hands. That's it. He said, "OH, IT'S A
[1:12:00] magnificent thing. The director AND THE
[1:12:02] COMPOSER MUST BE IN THE SAME SPIRIT."
[1:12:04] AND SO MUST THE MUSICIANS BE IN THE SAME
[1:12:07] SPIRIT TO ACT IT ALL OUT. SO IT DOESN'T
[1:12:09] MATTER IF YOU'RE PREACHING OR IF YOU'RE
[1:12:11] ONE PUBLISHING THE WORD OR IF YOU'RE ONE
[1:12:13] JUST BACKING THE PREACHER, YOU STILL GOT
[1:12:15] TO BE IN THE SPIRIT OF THE COMPOSER.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Come on now. That's the mystery OF THE
[1:12:20] WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; GOOD. [snorts]
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; And only he can reveal it to you. He
[1:12:28] said to act it all out in the world is
[1:12:30] wondering what's going on. The brother
[1:12:33] said many times we get nervous and we
[1:12:35] begin to think well it ought to be this
[1:12:36] way and we got to make it this way or
[1:12:37] make it that way. We don't have nothing
[1:12:40] to do into it. Just play our part. So we
[1:12:43] can't we don't write the music. We just
[1:12:45] play our part.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; That he leads us to play.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "Remember, there's nothing out
[1:12:52] of cater." Don't you love that?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; So the mystery is the mystery of his
[1:12:56] will for our lives, not for someone
[1:12:58] else.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; But for us, we don't need to match one
[1:13:00] another.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; We need to match the word. In fact,
[1:13:03] Romans says, "Who art thou that judgeest
[1:13:04] another man's servant? To his own
[1:13:06] master, he standeth or falleth."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "He'll be holding up for God is
[1:13:11] able to make him stand."
[1:13:13] So you'll find I'll just use this as the
[1:13:15] illustration and we'll close soon but
[1:13:17] [snorts] at some point. So
[1:13:21] Peter and John in the New Testament
[1:13:24] were you know they were kind of rivals.
[1:13:28] You remember the story how they branded
[1:13:30] the tomb and John writes and Peter set
[1:13:33] off first but John beat him to the tomb
[1:13:36] and John calls himself the one that
[1:13:38] Jesus loved.
[1:13:40] Right? He's writing the the book and he
[1:13:43] calls himself the one who Jesus loves
[1:13:45] and I love that. But he was so confident
[1:13:47] in that and and he beat Peter to the
[1:13:50] tomb and make sure to write that. It's
[1:13:51] not in any of the other gospels. Peter
[1:13:53] forgot about it, you know, and when he
[1:13:55] told Mark, but John [snorts] remembered
[1:13:58] and so they're kind of rivals and and
[1:14:02] Jesus told Peter when when Jesus
[1:14:04] appeared to him by the side of the lake,
[1:14:06] you remember? And he comes and he cooks
[1:14:08] dinner for him. Jesus cooks dinner for
[1:14:10] the disciples.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And and and [clears throat] he tells
[1:14:13] Peter, he keeps telling him, "Feed my
[1:14:14] sheep." Said, "Do you love me?" And he
[1:14:17] said, ' Do you love me more than these?
[1:14:20] Do you love me more than the other
[1:14:21] disciples, Peter? Peter says, "You know
[1:14:23] I love you." He said, "Then feed my
[1:14:25] sheep.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Feed my lambs." And then he proceeds to
[1:14:30] tell him how he's going to die.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT AN ODD THING TO TELL SOMEBODY. HE
[1:14:35] SAID, "FEED MY LAMBS." And then tells
[1:14:37] HIM HOW HE'S GOING TO DIE.
[1:14:39] LOOK at John 21:18. He said, "Verily,
[1:14:42] verily, I say unto thee, when thou was
[1:14:43] young, thou girdest thyself, and walkest
[1:14:46] whether thou wouldest, when thou shalt
[1:14:47] behold, thou shalt stretch forth thy
[1:14:50] hands, and another shall gird thee, and
[1:14:53] carry thee whether thou wouldest not to
[1:14:55] a cross."
[1:14:57] This spake he's signifying by what death
[1:14:58] he should glorify God. See, it's telling
[1:15:01] us Peter would die like Jesus would die
[1:15:03] only upside down according to history.
[1:15:05] When he had spoken this, he saith unto
[1:15:07] them, he said unto him, "Follow me."
[1:15:10] And Peter,
[1:15:12] what a revelation of the will of God for
[1:15:14] your life.
[1:15:16] Think about it. He knows it's thus
[1:15:18] sayeth the Lord.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; He knows whatever Jesus said is going to
[1:15:21] come to pass.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And Jesus just told him, said, "You're
[1:15:24] going to die.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; You're not only gonna die, you're gonna
[1:15:28] you're gonna be taken somewhere you
[1:15:30] don't want to go."
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Right? And Peter turned around and
[1:15:34] looked at John. It's like, okay, that's
[1:15:36] bad, but his has got to be worse,
[1:15:42] right?
[1:15:44] So, he see the see seeth the disciple
[1:15:46] whom Jesus loved, Jesus' favorite kind
[1:15:48] of or at least that's what it was
[1:15:50] perceived following, which also leaned
[1:15:53] on his breast at supper and said,
[1:15:54] "Lord," and and and this is the one who
[1:15:57] said, "Lord, which is he that betrayeth
[1:15:59] thee?" So, this is John. In verse 21,
[1:16:02] Peter seeing him said to Jesus,"Lord,
[1:16:05] what shall this man do? How's he going
[1:16:07] to die?
[1:16:10] How what's going to happen to him?"
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS SAID, "YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW
[1:16:15] THE WILL OF GOD FOR somebody else's
[1:16:17] life.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; You need to know the will of God for
[1:16:20] your own life.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; The mystery of God's will for your own
[1:16:23] life."
[1:16:25] AND AND JESUS SAID, "IF I WILL THAT HE
[1:16:27] TRIED TILL I COME." WHAT IS THAT TO
[1:16:30] THEE? FOLLOW THOU ME. And the people
[1:16:33] that heard it, brother Herald, made a
[1:16:34] doctrine out of it, just like they did
[1:16:35] with brother Brandham. And they tried to
[1:16:37] make John live forever.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; And then when he died, a bunch of people
[1:16:40] left the message.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Same thing happened back there that
[1:16:46] happened in our day and age. But they
[1:16:48] misinterpreted Jesus' words. But Jesus
[1:16:50] didn't say that he would live till he
[1:16:52] come. He said, "What if he does?
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; What is that to you, Peter? Follow me."
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He may not have John had his own.
[1:17:01] In fact, I believe John was the only one
[1:17:03] that actually lived to be in of old age.
[1:17:06] And they tried to boil him in oil and he
[1:17:08] wouldn't boil. BUT BUT GOD TELLING PETER
[1:17:10] SAID, "YOU got you there's A WILL FOR
[1:17:12] YOUR LIFE. JUST JUST SURRENDER YOURSELF
[1:17:14] TO THAT. DON'T BE LOOKING AT WHAT
[1:17:15] somebody else is doing. SURRENDER
[1:17:17] YOURSELF TO THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR
[1:17:19] LIFE." BROTHER BRANDON SAID A few days
[1:17:21] ago, Brother Joseph, he's talking about
[1:17:22] Joseph Boz in Chicago. Brother Joseph
[1:17:25] encouraged me a lot. He said, 'I seen a
[1:17:26] lot of stuff rising up in the churches
[1:17:28] that should not be. Oh well. He said, I
[1:17:31] was an Irishman, you know, I had to go
[1:17:32] out and stop it all myself. I WAS GOING
[1:17:35] TO GO OUT AND SAY THIS CAN'T BE LIKE
[1:17:36] THIS AND THIS CAN'T BE like that. Can't
[1:17:38] do it because you're going to spoil
[1:17:40] God's program. You're getting stuff in
[1:17:41] there that shouldn't be all this. And I
[1:17:43] knew it was wrong. It's scripturally
[1:17:45] wrong. He said, "THE FIRST THING YOU
[1:17:47] KNOW, I BEGIN TO FIND MYSELF GETTING A
[1:17:49] LITTLE KIND OF off the line, getting
[1:17:52] bitter. I stopped out there and I went
[1:17:55] be to pray." He said, "And Joseph came
[1:17:57] down." He said, "Look," he said, "I just
[1:18:00] read the history of Martin Luther and
[1:18:01] the question was that they didn't wonder
[1:18:03] about Martin Luther able to protest the
[1:18:05] Catholic Church and get by with it. But
[1:18:07] what the wonder was with Martin Luther
[1:18:08] is all the fanaticism that followed it."
[1:18:10] And he raised up out of all of it.
[1:18:12] That's the main thing. HE SAID, "THEN I
[1:18:14] HEARD AS IT WAS that Christ said, what
[1:18:18] is that TO THEE? FOLLOW THOU ME. I'LL
[1:18:22] TAKE CARE OF THE REST." OH, IF WE COULD
[1:18:23] GET A REVELATION OF THAT TODAY, WE LOOK
[1:18:25] AT WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE DOES OR WHAT
[1:18:26] ANOTHER PREACHER IN THE CHURCH DOES OR
[1:18:28] ANOTHER PREACHER IN ANOTHER CHURCH DOES
[1:18:30] OR WHAT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE CHURCH
[1:18:31] DOES. DON'T LOOK AT THEM. FOLLOW THOU
[1:18:33] ME.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; I'll take care of the rest of it. YOU
[1:18:37] JUST GO AHEAD and follow me. That's the
[1:18:38] way it is. Then get back to carefree
[1:18:40] again. It's a good way to live without
[1:18:43] the cares of life and cares wearing you
[1:18:45] wearing you down making you bitter.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes an interesting
[1:18:49] statement. He said, "That's the reason,
[1:18:50] brethren, that we're holding up the
[1:18:52] adoption of God."
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; As our difference of life and fussing
[1:18:58] and quarreling amongst one another is
[1:19:00] the reason the veil can't drop behind
[1:19:01] us. We can go into that presence of God.
[1:19:04] We're so interested in our
[1:19:05] denominations. We're so interested in
[1:19:06] what the next fellow. What is that to
[1:19:08] thee? Follow thou me. It's an individual
[1:19:12] affair between every minister. HOW A
[1:19:16] MINISTER OUGHT TO ALWAYS GET ALONE TO
[1:19:18] HIMSELF. Even before he preaches, before
[1:19:20] he prays, before he does anything, he
[1:19:22] should get alone WITH GOD IN THAT QUIET
[1:19:24] PLACE. HIT away with God. I'll be honest
[1:19:28] with you, it's hard to get alone with
[1:19:29] God here at the church be once church
[1:19:32] has started or even before. I do that at
[1:19:34] home. I do that. I try to do that days
[1:19:37] before, hours before to TRY TO MAKE SURE
[1:19:40] MY MY MIND'S right when I'm studying. My
[1:19:42] heart's right. GET ALONG WITH GOD
[1:19:44] BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY ONE I'M EVER GOING
[1:19:45] TO ANSWER TO.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? It's not GOING TO BE WHETHER OR
[1:19:48] NOT OTHER PEOPLE THOUGHT I did a good
[1:19:50] job. SO, I DON'T JUST PREACH WHAT OTHER
[1:19:51] PEOPLE PREACH. I PREACH WHAT GOD PUTS ON
[1:19:53] MY HEART. I CAN'T EVEN PREACH WHAT THE
[1:19:56] PEOPLE want to hear.
[1:19:58] Are you with ME ON THAT? LIKE, I CAN'T
[1:20:00] DO THAT. I'D LOVE TO DO THAT, BUT I
[1:20:01] CAN'T JUST PREACH WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
[1:20:03] I GOT TO PREACH WHAT GOD PUTS ON MY
[1:20:05] HEART
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; because I got to have the will of God, a
[1:20:08] revelation of the will of God, the
[1:20:09] mystery of God's will for my life,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:14] He said, "Get away." Before he does
[1:20:16] anything, he should get alone with God
[1:20:17] in that quiet place. Get away with God.
[1:20:21] Now,
[1:20:23] he said he made known to us the mystery.
[1:20:26] Are you [snorts] still with me? I've got
[1:20:27] just a few more minutes.
[1:20:30] He said, "Get the Holy Spirit on you
[1:20:31] sometime and start running that and just
[1:20:33] watch how it goes." Brother Brandham
[1:20:35] tells us he studied this in 30 minutes,
[1:20:37] two 15minute increments.
[1:20:40] He was a prophet.
[1:20:44] Cuz brother Brandham reaches into the
[1:20:46] mystery of the will of God and pulls out
[1:20:47] Melzdc.
[1:20:50] Go listen to adoption number four. He
[1:20:53] reaches into the mystery of the will of
[1:20:55] God and pulls out Melzdc. He said, "I
[1:20:57] got to run in and the mystery, how much
[1:20:59] tears the scripture packed me in back in
[1:21:00] the Old Testament, back in the New
[1:21:02] Testament, tied something together."
[1:21:03] See, the mystery of his coming, the
[1:21:05] mystery of his will, the mystery of us
[1:21:06] sitting together. He said, "Remember, it
[1:21:08] cannot be taught in any seminary. It's a
[1:21:10] mystery. YOU CAN'T KNOW IT BY EDUCATION,
[1:21:12] BY THEOLOGY. It's a mystery that's been
[1:21:14] hidden since the foundation of the
[1:21:15] world, WAITING FOR THE manifestation of
[1:21:17] the sons of God." He takes that to
[1:21:18] Melzdc. I'll skip past reading that. In
[1:21:21] Hebrews chapter 7, he talked about how
[1:21:23] Melzdc was without father, without
[1:21:25] mother, without descent, having neither
[1:21:26] beginning of days nor end of life, made
[1:21:29] like the son of God, abiding a priest
[1:21:31] continually. He said that he said notice
[1:21:33] this Melzdc. He said as he met Abraham
[1:21:36] coming from the slaughter of the kings,
[1:21:38] the mystery of God now being made known.
[1:21:40] Who was he? They can't find the history
[1:21:42] of him. He said he never did have a
[1:21:44] beginning. I'm skipping through here,
[1:21:45] brother Robert. He never did have A
[1:21:47] BEGINNING, SO HE COULDN'T HAVE been
[1:21:48] nobody else but law. Elohim,
[1:21:51] self-existence, self-abiding, almighty
[1:21:54] God. Brother Brandham was the was the
[1:21:56] only one who could see that.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Why? God sent a prophet
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; to open that up to us.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham, he's using that to
[1:22:06] teach us something. And if you go listen
[1:22:07] to it, Brother Brandham's using that to
[1:22:09] teach us that the message came in
[1:22:10] perfect order
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; because before the seals, we had to have
[1:22:13] the church ages. And before the seals,
[1:22:14] we had to before we could receive who is
[1:22:16] this MelzDC, we had to receive adoption.
[1:22:18] Right?
[1:22:20] Right? And the message of grace
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; and the stature of a perfect man
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; had to come before the opening of the
[1:22:26] seals,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; before the rapture, before Christ's
[1:22:30] mystery of God revealed,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; right? It come in perfect order. Now,
[1:22:33] why did it have to come like that?
[1:22:35] Because brother Brandon types it to
[1:22:36] Abraham taking his position going and
[1:22:38] getting his fallen brother and then
[1:22:40] coming back and meeting Melzdc.
[1:22:43] [snorts]
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Oh church, you realize what's happened
[1:22:46] in our day.
[1:22:48] We've met Christ the word.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; We didn't meet a man. We didn't meet
[1:22:51] William Brandon. We met the God Elohim.
[1:22:55] Yes,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon wasn't Elohim. But he
[1:22:59] introduced us to Elohim.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; So after the church takes its position,
[1:23:04] he said we're called to the adoption of
[1:23:06] sons by the Holy Spirit. And when each
[1:23:09] man TAKES HIS POSITION, WHAT GOD HAS
[1:23:13] CALLED HIM TO DO AND STAND TO THE END OF
[1:23:16] THE ROAD GOING after the lost. ABRAHAM
[1:23:19] GOING AFTER LOT CUZ LOT was part of him.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Oh church, HE SAID THAT'S OUR POSITION.
[1:23:24] THAT'S OUR ADOPTION.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN Abraham received that, then he
[1:23:28] comes back and meets Melzdc.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; He said first Paul took all the scare
[1:23:32] out of it. He said, "If you're called,
[1:23:34] if you're not just worked up in some
[1:23:35] kind of theology, if you're really born
[1:23:36] of the spirit, then God predestined you
[1:23:38] before the foundation of the world. Put
[1:23:40] your name on the lamb's book of life.
[1:23:41] And now we come together to sit in
[1:23:43] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. He
[1:23:44] served Abraham communion after the
[1:23:47] battle." He said the same thing Melzdc
[1:23:49] did after Abraham had got his position,
[1:23:51] set his men in order, and won the
[1:23:53] battle. Come home and Melzed, come out
[1:23:55] with bread and wine. After the battle's
[1:23:57] over, we'll eat the wedding supper with
[1:23:58] the Lord Jesus in THE NEW WORLD. DON'T
[1:24:00] BE AFRAID TO SURRENDER TO THE MYSTERY OF
[1:24:02] THE WILL OF GOD IN THIS LIFE BECAUSE WE
[1:24:04] ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE WILL OF GOD IS FOR
[1:24:06] THE NEXT ONE. WE ALREADY KNOW WE'RE
[1:24:07] GOING TO A WEDDING supper
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; to meet Melzdc
[1:24:12] made flesh.
[1:24:14] [snorts] Listen, what is the mystery of
[1:24:16] his will? It's the fullness of adoption.
[1:24:18] He made us listen, brother Brandon says
[1:24:20] this, having made known to us the
[1:24:21] mystery of his will to adopt us. That's
[1:24:24] the mystery of his will, right? What is
[1:24:27] the mystery his will for my life? to
[1:24:28] adopt you to make you a full-g grown son
[1:24:30] or daughter of God
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; so you can fill whatever part
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; and then that will of God will be
[1:24:35] revealed to you.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; What is the mystery of the will of God
[1:24:40] for your life? It's to be one of those
[1:24:42] brethren that he was the firstborn among
[1:24:43] many brethren to play that part.
[1:24:46] Moses was 80 years old when he began to
[1:24:48] play it. The music was playing the whole
[1:24:51] time, but Moses had Moses had to stop
[1:24:53] and wait. Other people played their part
[1:24:55] and finally Moses said, "God, I'm
[1:24:57] insufficient." And God said, "Now I can
[1:24:59] use you."
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; But what did he tell Moses? Look, he
[1:25:03] said, "Well, is God going to give me
[1:25:04] some superpower?" No. What do you do
[1:25:06] with Moses? He said, first he revealed
[1:25:08] the mystery of the will of God. Said,
[1:25:09] "You're going to go down deliver my
[1:25:11] people." And then he said, "What's in
[1:25:13] your hand?"
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Right? Use what you already have. If
[1:25:17] you're a singer, God's going to use
[1:25:18] that.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; If you're a preacher, God's going to use
[1:25:21] that. If you're a help of some kind in
[1:25:23] the church, God's going to use that. Use
[1:25:25] what's in your hand. DON'T WORRY ABOUT
[1:25:27] SOMETHING ELSE. USE WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND.
[1:25:29] DO WHAT YOU CAN DO.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Dry stick that he had in his hand become
[1:25:34] a judgment rod because he had met the
[1:25:37] pillar of fire and had been had the
[1:25:38] mystery of the will of God for his life
[1:25:40] revealed to him. Each one of us have to
[1:25:42] meet that same pillar of fire. Look at 2
[1:25:44] Peter 1:10. musicians come. He said,
[1:25:47] "Wherefore the rather, brethren, give
[1:25:48] diligence to make your calling and
[1:25:50] election sure. For if you do these
[1:25:53] things, you shall never fall." Notice he
[1:25:55] just he doesn't say just make your
[1:25:56] election sure. He said make your calling
[1:25:59] an election sure.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Make sure you KNOW THE WILL OF GOD FOR
[1:26:03] YOUR LIFE. Seek those things. If you do
[1:26:06] these things, you shall never fall. For
[1:26:08] so an entrance shall be ministered unto
[1:26:10] you abundantly into the everlasting
[1:26:12] kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:26:16] Christ. I wonder if we know I don't know
[1:26:17] if we know that song. Speak the word,
[1:26:19] Lord. Speak the word, Lord. I think I
[1:26:21] had him put it in the in the system.
[1:26:25] Hallelujah. Oh, let's just sing this.
[1:26:28] And do you want to know the will of God
[1:26:30] for your life?
[1:26:32] Do you want to surrender to it? I do.
[1:26:34] You say, "Well, I'm old now and I maybe
[1:26:36] you waited till this time to show you
[1:26:38] what you what you've been doing all
[1:26:40] along. What's that in your hand?"
[1:26:44] Some of y'all are such an encouragement
[1:26:46] to me. And maybe that's what God called
[1:26:48] you to be.
[1:26:50] Some [snorts] of some of you are an
[1:26:51] encouragement to your family, to your
[1:26:53] children, to your grandchildren. Just be
[1:26:55] that. Become mature in that. It maybe
[1:26:58] it's a it's a singer or a song leader or
[1:27:01] something like that. But Lord, speak to
[1:27:03] me. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT I'M
[1:27:05] SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. I WANT TO KNOW.
[1:27:07] LISTEN, THAT'S WHY WE DON'T PROSTITE
[1:27:09] PEOPLE.
[1:27:11] OH, come on, church. We don't do that. I
[1:27:12] don't play those games.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; I DON'T GO OUT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO
[1:27:16] COME TO CHURCH HERE. I WANT THE PEOPLE
[1:27:17] THAT GOD SENT HERE.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD SENDS YOU HERE, YOU GET A
[1:27:21] MYSTERY, a revelation of the mystery of
[1:27:23] God, THE WILL OF GOD FOR YOUR LIFE.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT TO BUILD JUST A BIG
[1:27:27] CHURCH. WE I I want I want the pews to
[1:27:29] be full, but I want people to be there
[1:27:31] that are supposed to be there that want
[1:27:33] to be there that that's been revealed to
[1:27:34] them. THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. I'M GOING
[1:27:36] TO BE A PART OF WHAT GOD WANTS to do.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Speak the word, Lord, and I'll
[1:27:42] hear it. Amen. Let's sing this together
[1:27:45] before we go tonight. Speak the word,
[1:27:47] Lord. Oh, let's sing the the the chorus
[1:27:49] now. Oh, speak [singing and music]
[1:27:52] the word, Lord.
[1:27:54] My ears long [singing]
[1:27:57] to hear you.
[1:28:00] Oh, sing it now. Speak the word, oh
[1:28:03] Lord. [singing]
[1:28:04] My heart waits to know.
[1:28:10] Oh yes. Oh, speak the word, Lord, Lord.
[1:28:14] [music] Oh, I'll be what you'd have me
[1:28:20] to [singing and music] be.
[1:28:22] Hallelujah.
[1:28:24] Oh, speak the word, [singing] Lord.
[1:28:27] Your servant
[1:28:30] will go.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Sing that first verse now. [music]
[1:28:35] It's a foreign
[1:28:37] battlefield.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Where I finally
[1:28:42] find your will,
[1:28:45] Lord. Then that's where [singing]
[1:28:47] we can say amen to that. I long
[1:28:50] to be. Amen. Let's take that kind of
[1:28:53] surrender tonight. Oh, in the desert
[1:28:57] without a drink or on some ship about to
[1:29:03] sing. Oh Lord, I'll go. Hallelujah. If
[1:29:08] you just speak
[1:29:11] to me. [singing]
[1:29:12] [music] Sing it now. Speak the word,
[1:29:14] Lord. Let's stand together. Speak the
[1:29:16] word, Lord. Oh, my [music and singing]
[1:29:19] ears long to hear you. Oh, can you just
[1:29:24] raise your hands to me? Just ask him
[1:29:26] tonight. Speak [music] the word, Lord.
[1:29:29] My heart aches [singing] to know.
[1:29:34] [music]
[1:29:35] Oh, speak the word, Lord. [singing]
[1:29:39] I'll be [music] what you'd have me
[1:29:43] [singing] to be.
[1:29:46] Hallelujah.
[1:29:48] Oh, speak [music] the word, [singing]
[1:29:50] Lord.
[1:29:51] Your servant
[1:29:54] will know. We have the next verse. Now,
[1:29:57] hallelujah.
[1:29:59] There's been times that I've complained.
[1:30:02] You ever been there? As I rubbed
[1:30:05] [singing]
[1:30:06] against the grain,
[1:30:09] and I recall [singing]
[1:30:11] those times you took me to my [music]
[1:30:15] knees.
[1:30:18] Oh, but there's one thing I could do.
[1:30:22] [music and singing]
[1:30:24] So I still owe this thanks [music] to
[1:30:27] you.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; For it was you, Lord. Aren't you glad
[1:30:31] you did? Who took my cross [music]
[1:30:34] to Calary? [singing]
[1:30:36] Sing it now with all your heart. Speak
[1:30:40] the word, Lord. Oh [singing and music]
[1:30:42] my ears, Lord, to hear you. Oh, grab me
[1:30:47] Lord. Oh, speak [music and singing] the
[1:30:50] word, Lord. Oh, my hearts
[1:30:55] to know.
[1:30:56] [music and singing]
[1:30:58] Oh, speak the word, Lord, and I'll
[1:31:02] [singing and music] be what you'd have
[1:31:06] me to be.
[1:31:10] Oh, speak the word, Lord.
[1:31:14] Your servant
[1:31:17] will go. Sing the first verse again.
[1:31:20] Oh, if it's a foreign
[1:31:24] battlefield
[1:31:26] where I finally
[1:31:29] find your will,
[1:31:31] Lord, then that's [music] where
[1:31:35] I long
[1:31:37] to be.
[1:31:41] Oh, in the desert without [singing] a
[1:31:45] drink. Glory
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; on some old ship
[1:31:49] about to sink. [music and singing]
[1:31:51] Lord, I'll go in.
[1:31:54] You'll just speak [music]
[1:31:57] to me.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time. Speak the word.
[1:32:01] Speak the word, Lord.
[1:32:04] My [singing] ears [music] long to hear
[1:32:08] you.
[1:32:09] Speak the word. Oh, [music] speak the
[1:32:12] word, Lord. Granny Lord, my heart aches
[1:32:17] to know. [singing]
[1:32:20] [music]
[1:32:20] Oh, speak the word, [singing] Lord.
[1:32:24] I'll be what you'd have me to [music]
[1:32:30] be.
[1:32:33] Let's speak the word. [singing] Lord,
[1:32:37] your servant
[1:32:39] will go. Before we sing [music] that
[1:32:41] again, I I a little Theo come up. He
[1:32:44] wanted to show me. We prayed for him
[1:32:46] Sunday morning with open sores on his
[1:32:48] leg and he pulled up his pants leg and
[1:32:50] showed me where it had been completely
[1:32:52] healed. I thank the Lord for that.
[1:32:54] That's wonderful. [applause]
[1:32:56] [music]
[1:33:01] Listen, church.
[1:33:03] You know, if we just be in our place
[1:33:07] [music] and be there, God wants to do
[1:33:09] miraculous things for you.
[1:33:12] You be here on Sunday and Brother Joe
[1:33:14] Adam's going to preach and I'm God can
[1:33:15] do the miraculous for you. I I'm sure
[1:33:17] that'll build your faith. God can heal
[1:33:19] you. He can take care of things in your
[1:33:20] life. You just try to do your best. Some
[1:33:22] of some can't even come to church.
[1:33:24] They're sick. But God knew that and he
[1:33:26] knew he'd be he'd reach down right where
[1:33:28] they're at tonight and heal them. I
[1:33:30] believe the same God that heal little
[1:33:32] Theo can heal you. And I believe that
[1:33:34] with all my heart. Oh, what a wonderful
[1:33:36] testimony out of the mouth of babes.
[1:33:38] Amen. Little children, he said he would
[1:33:40] speak to us. I believe that. We've seen
[1:33:42] children get their healing. By the time
[1:33:44] some of us adults grab some hold of some
[1:33:45] faith and said, "Lord, I believe. I
[1:33:48] believe. Help thou my unbelief. Speak
[1:33:50] the word, Lord. Oh, I WANT TO HEAR WHAT
[1:33:52] YOU GOT TO SAY. I want to do what you
[1:33:55] want me to do." Hallelujah. Amen. We're
[1:33:59] going to sing the chorus again and let's
[1:34:00] just sing it and if we could play it
[1:34:03] softly and I want you to I think you
[1:34:04] know it now. I want you to sing it with
[1:34:06] all your heart. Let it be your prayer
[1:34:08] now as they play it softly now. Oh,
[1:34:11] speak the word Lord. We want to hear you
[1:34:14] sing it.
[1:34:16] Long [music] to [singing] hear you.
[1:34:20] Oh, that's good. Oh, speak the word,
[1:34:23] Lord.
[1:34:25] My heart aches to know.
[1:34:30] Oh, thank you, Jesus. Speak the word,
[1:34:33] Lord.
[1:34:35] I'll be [singing and music] what you'd
[1:34:38] have me to be. [music]
[1:34:43] Oh, speak [singing] the word, Lord.

[1:34:51] your heart now with the music and
[1:34:52] everything. Sing.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Speak the word, Lord.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; My ears long to hear you.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, speak the [music] word, Lord.
[1:35:08] My heart aches
[1:35:10] to know.
[1:35:13] [singing and music]
[1:35:14] Oh, speak the word, Lord,
[1:35:18] and I'll be what you'd have me to be.
[1:35:24] [singing]
[1:35:26] Oh, speak the word, Lord,
[1:35:30] your servant
[1:35:33] [music] will go.
[1:35:36] Is that your desire tonight? Give the
[1:35:38] Lord a big hand clap of praise.
[1:35:40] [applause]
[1:35:41] Amen.
[1:35:44] Pull up. Rising up for me, Brother
[1:35:45] Robert. Rising up. Amen. [music] Do you
[1:35:47] believe there's a Amen. There's a bride
[1:35:49] that's rising up in this day. Let's sing
[1:35:51] this before we go. Don't forget both
[1:35:53] services on Sunday. We'll be Brother Joe
[1:35:54] Adams speaking. Are you looking forward
[1:35:56] to that? Amen. I believe the Lord will
[1:35:58] do something great for you. Don't
[1:35:59] forget, Brother Ben, while he's while
[1:36:01] he's gone, uh ministering and going to a
[1:36:03] meeting there in Arizona. Amen. Just
[1:36:05] keep him in your prayers. And Amen. I'll
[1:36:07] be gone as well this weekend, but uh but
[1:36:09] I'll be back at some point, too. So,
[1:36:11] amen. God bless you all. We're rising
[1:36:14] up.

[1:36:35] Well, as I look out across the land, I
[1:36:39] see God's [music and singing] mighty
[1:36:40] hand. The bride of Christ adorned in her
[1:36:44] wedding gown.
[1:36:47] Oh, just [singing] like in the days of
[1:36:49] old, how they stood in courage.
[1:36:53] Well, they've turned this old
[1:36:55] [singing and music] world upside down.

[1:37:29] the apostles hands.
[1:37:32] Oh, demon [singing]
[1:37:33] spirits were cast out in the jail.
[1:37:36] They'd sing and shout while surrounded
