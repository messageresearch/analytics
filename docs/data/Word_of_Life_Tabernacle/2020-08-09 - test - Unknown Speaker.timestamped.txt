[1:14] hi everybody we're just running a test
[1:20] what's wrong with the zoom bub
[1:33] i wonder why it doesn't show up in the
[1:34] word of life tabernacle group anymore
[1:37] some reason it's not going there
[1:42] it must take a while to go there
[1:46] and then
[1:49] where else does it go no it should be on
[1:52] twitter
[2:07] great break this microphone
[2:11] check one two
[2:15] i fell out of there check one two it's
[2:22] not
[2:22] zooming really
[2:26] when you push zoom it's not it takes it
[2:28] a little bit
[2:30] let me look and see
[2:37] you you need to probably refresh your
[2:39] page on your
[2:42] huh the camera page

[3:21] brother with ivy's preaching tomorrow
[3:22] it'll be
[3:24] it won't be too bad
[3:29] the picture is pretty good though isn't
[3:31] it are we dropping anything if i move
[3:32] around
[3:34] like that's what i want to see if it if
[3:36] it's moving with me pretty good
[3:38] and then if it does it means we have a
[3:40] constant stream
