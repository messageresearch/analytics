[48:05] none of world thoughts or ideas would be
[48:07] injected lord but it would just be the

[48:09] would it be the word in due season or
[48:11] the
[48:12] seed would just take place and find its
[48:14] home

[48:17] that's perceptible
[48:19] and ready to receive god i pray just
[48:21] bless us
[48:22] lord i pray that you just move me aside
[48:24] again just take control of my lips my
[48:27] body lord that i would just be a servant
[48:29] just a vessel for you
[48:30] in jesus christ amen
[48:34] amen if you would turn with me to luke
[48:36] chapter 15
[48:38] and verse 11.
[48:40] we'll begin reading there
[48:42] i'll let you
[48:44] let you have your seats and
[48:46] i'd like to this evening just if we
[48:48] could title it anything it would just be
[48:49] all he has
[48:51] and then
[48:52] we'll kind of be looking
[48:55] kind of lay a foundation tonight and
[48:57] just want to look at the prodigal son's
[48:58] brother actually and
[49:00] kind of look at him just for a little
[49:01] bit tonight
[49:03] and so luke chapter 15 and verse 11 and
[49:06] he said a certain man had two sons and
[49:08] the younger them said to his father
[49:10] father give me the portion of
[49:12] goods that falleth to me and he divided
[49:15] unto them as living
[49:17] and not many days after the younger son
[49:19] gathered all together and took his
[49:21] journey into a far country and there he
[49:23] wasted his sustenance substance with
[49:25] righteous living
[49:27] and when he had spent all there arose a
[49:29] mighty famine in the land
[49:32] and he began to be in want and and he
[49:34] went and joined himself to a citizen of
[49:36] that country and he sent him into his
[49:37] fields to feed swine and he would have
[49:40] faint filled his belly with the husk
[49:41] that the swine did eat and no man gave
[49:43] unto him
[49:44] and when he came to himself he said how
[49:46] many hired servants of my father have
[49:48] bred enough to spare
[49:50] and i perish with hunger you can have
[49:52] your seats this evening
[49:58] and so we see that the prodigal son here
[50:00] he he come to the father and he asks and
[50:02] i know we we've heard this preached on
[50:04] many times and and i myself have
[50:06] preached on it but just kind of like to
[50:08] go through this just this little bible
[50:09] study maybe tonight and and just kind of
[50:11] see what the lord has in store for us
[50:14] did you enjoy the service this morning
[50:17] and i definitely did as well and just
[50:19] appreciate all of our mothers and and
[50:21] all them coming out just appreciate
[50:22] y'all and
[50:24] you know that's uh
[50:25] you know i really enjoyed how brother
[50:27] ben really broke that down you know
[50:28] we've got to continue even though
[50:29] they're educated in school but the true
[50:31] education starts in the home and i just
[50:33] that really really hit home with me you
[50:35] know i was i was looking at a study
[50:37] um
[50:38] i went to this training and there was
[50:40] they have a philosopher come out now and
[50:41] it's a modern day philosopher but he
[50:43] talked about the study of the twins i
[50:44] don't know if any of y'all ever heard of
[50:45] it but
[50:47] they've actually been pretty
[50:47] controversial lately but in the 1960s i
[50:50] believe they actually went and some
[50:53] some psychiatrists and a few other
[50:55] people actually went to
[50:57] clinics um for children to be adopted
[50:59] and they actually divided up twins and
[51:01] triplets and they studied them all
[51:02] through their lives and they never knew
[51:04] they had a twin or sibling
[51:06] and so now they've all found out and of
[51:08] course it's a pretty big fuss and and so
[51:10] yale university has locked up the
[51:12] documentation for 75 years i think is
[51:14] what it what it is and
[51:16] but anyways it was it was pretty neat
[51:17] some of those studies some of these
[51:18] twins were separated at birth and
[51:21] and there was there was one set they
[51:22] they smoked the same cigarette they
[51:23] drove the same car they even named their
[51:25] first child the same name they never met
[51:28] anywhere in life and so the study was
[51:30] genetics versus environment and and so
[51:32] on and so you know looking at that study
[51:35] there were some
[51:36] you know that were identical twins some
[51:38] that were just twins and then there were
[51:39] triplets and and so they began to study
[51:41] and see what genetics had to do with it
[51:42] what environment had to do with it what
[51:44] this had to do it so so i truly believe
[51:46] as as believers i believe that the holy
[51:48] spirit can trump all of those things is
[51:50] that right i believe it can trump
[51:51] environment i believe it can trump
[51:52] genetics and and so you look at that
[51:54] study and they were trying to figure out
[51:55] what really ruled but i believe as
[51:58] christians if there's something that can
[51:59] rule our lives it's the holy spirit is
[52:01] that right and so i just want to kind of
[52:03] look at this and you see the the two
[52:04] brothers here they grew up in the same
[52:06] home they grew up the same same one the
[52:08] same father the same mother and you see
[52:10] both had two different desires in the
[52:11] heart one wanted to get out and one
[52:12] wanted to stay and you see this prodigal
[52:15] son he went away he wasted all that he
[52:17] had and and but he had to come and
[52:19] recognize his condition is that right
[52:21] and i think that's the third what do
[52:22] they say the first step is acceptance
[52:24] but you've got to recognize the
[52:25] condition you're in you know we can't we
[52:27] can't blame it on this one you know we
[52:28] can only blame the pastor so much for
[52:30] our spiritual condition and then it's up
[52:32] to us to change that is that right
[52:34] and so he he began to go through his
[52:36] life and he began to recognize that he
[52:38] was still a son and now brother branham
[52:40] says in 1957 he says now i believe this
[52:42] he said i could be wrong he said i'm
[52:44] just a man as you are but i believe the
[52:46] coming of the lord is past due and he
[52:48] said i believe the reason that god can't
[52:50] come is on our condition of his church
[52:52] he said it's all separated and broke up
[52:54] and everything that could be thought of
[52:56] as mixed into it and he said it's got to
[52:58] come a time for an old-fashioned shaking
[53:00] down
[53:01] he said a settling down of the church of
[53:03] god he says now as we see this day he
[53:06] said this was a perfect type then of
[53:08] today so what he's saying is the the
[53:11] he's typing us back to it and he says
[53:13] first thing they had they had an ark and
[53:15] a prophet and an angel and he's talking
[53:16] about the children of israel and he said
[53:18] the word their prophet their angel and
[53:20] that sacred light followed him and he
[53:22] said as they came out of egypt after
[53:24] after moses he said god took 40 years
[53:27] bringing them into condition they were
[53:29] 40 years past because their differences
[53:32] and not recognizing so what pretty much
[53:34] brother branham is saying you know they
[53:35] could have went into the they could have
[53:37] went straight into the land that they
[53:39] were promised but because of their
[53:40] differences and not recognizing who they
[53:42] are they went 40 years past due now
[53:45] the bible says in the days of noah god
[53:47] was long suffering he wasn't willing
[53:48] that any should perish and he said as it
[53:51] was in the days of noah so will be in
[53:53] the coming of the son of man and he said
[53:55] i believe the coming of the lord is past
[53:57] due then he said for he had to wait long
[54:00] in noah's time he had to wait long in
[54:02] bringing out israel and i believe he's
[54:04] waiting long he said but i believe his
[54:05] patience is getting thin with us
[54:08] and so we see that
[54:09] as the as the prodigal son that did go
[54:11] away we must see that it is time for us
[54:13] to check up and it's time to see that
[54:15] that you and i have got to recognize the
[54:17] condition that we're in and and the good
[54:19] thing about about the scripture is is
[54:21] when the prodigal son recognized the
[54:23] condition that he was in he had a place
[54:25] to go to is that right and you know you
[54:27] and i as as sons and daughters of god we
[54:29] may get out of step every now and again
[54:31] as brother branham's seeing the vision
[54:32] he's seen the he's seen some of the
[54:34] bride they were getting out of stead but
[54:36] he screamed get back in line and i think
[54:37] that can happen to any of us i think
[54:39] when we get to a position in our life
[54:41] that we think we can't fall i think
[54:42] that's when god will cause us to fall to
[54:44] show that we're not in charge but he is
[54:47] is that right it's not that god would
[54:49] show his his
[54:50] his his power over us but he would show
[54:53] us that we've got to be submissive to
[54:55] the word but it's not by our might but
[54:56] it's by his is that right
[54:58] now i just want to lay a foundation it
[55:00] may take me a few minutes to get into it
[55:02] but we'll pray that god will give us
[55:03] something here near the end and
[55:05] now brother branham also says further on
[55:07] down this quote he says each age has to
[55:09] recognize the word for them and so
[55:11] that's good we've all recognized the
[55:12] word is that right but the next phrase
[55:14] comes and then fulfill the word so it's
[55:16] not good enough that we just recognize
[55:18] that the god sent a prophet god gave us
[55:21] the word for this day but now we've got
[55:22] to fulfill the word that was given to us
[55:24] do you believe that and it says we have
[55:27] the fullness of the word and we must
[55:28] recognize it and then must fulfill that
[55:30] and he said at the end of each age they
[55:32] would denominate around the light and
[55:34] forget about going on in it and so
[55:36] that's what was happening
[55:38] in each age they would get the light and
[55:40] then they would find a way to denominate
[55:41] around it and that's what's happening
[55:43] now in today's time you see that they've
[55:45] got this portion they want to denominate
[55:47] that right now so it shows that this
[55:49] must be the end of an age is that right
[55:51] and you know i heard a guy say one time
[55:52] you can drive a car from the east coast
[55:54] to the west coast in the dark
[55:57] he said you've got the headlights on the
[55:58] car is that right you can't see the
[56:00] hallway but you can see a hundred feet
[56:01] in front of you and i believe that's the
[56:03] way it is with jesus when he says walk
[56:05] in the light as i said i am the light
[56:07] walk in the light with me we must be
[56:09] walking with him it's not that we can
[56:10] see the message of the hour and then sit
[56:12] down and stay in and denominate around
[56:14] it we must continue moving until the
[56:16] rapture comes is that right
[56:19] now i see that israel marched they began
[56:20] to march in circles for a year because
[56:22] they couldn't they marched in circles
[56:24] for years because they could not
[56:25] recognize who they were they could not
[56:27] could not recognize what god had truly
[56:29] given them and and they got in the
[56:30] desert and they got tired of waiting on
[56:32] the word and then what would they do
[56:33] they would find something to denominate
[56:34] around is that right they would say well
[56:36] we want to we want to do this and we
[56:38] want to do that and i don't remember who
[56:39] was preaching if it was brother ben or
[56:41] brother stewart or brother joel but they
[56:42] were preaching about saul and david and
[56:44] it never clicked to me it never occurred
[56:46] to me that you know the people they
[56:47] cried out for saul they cried out for a
[56:49] king they wanted a king and it never
[56:51] occurred to me god had a king coming and
[56:53] it was david god was already raising up
[56:55] a david to come along and the people got
[56:57] ahead of god they wanted to get ahead of
[56:59] him and they raised up their own man is
[57:01] that right and wanted to do it led them
[57:02] into destruction but what did god do he
[57:04] kept his king that was coming which was
[57:06] david and god straightened it out do you
[57:08] believe that this morning
[57:10] or this evening i'm still preaching from
[57:12] this morning so
[57:14] brother ben said y'all might be tired
[57:15] y'all ate really good so i might have to
[57:17] wake you all up so
[57:20] brother joe knows i had nine years
[57:21] experience in the funeral home so i'm
[57:23] kind of good if people are quiet it
[57:24] doesn't bother me at all so
[57:27] i'm not scared of a dead person
[57:31] some of you all think that's funny but
[57:33] there is a phobia of dead people
[57:36] one person that couldn't hurt you and
[57:38] that's the one you're going to be afraid
[57:40] of
[57:41] you know it's kind of funny
[57:43] in god's eyes satan's been defeated and
[57:45] some of you are still afraid of him yes
[57:46] yes sir all right
[57:48] so he says brother graham says he goes
[57:50] on here he says now if you'll notice he
[57:51] said as it was in the days of noah and
[57:54] he said in the days of noah before the
[57:55] flood how it would be and god was not
[57:57] willing that any should perish but that
[57:59] all might come to repentance and and you
[58:01] know i've been seeing this a lot in the
[58:03] quotes that i've been reading that that
[58:04] god was long suffering and he didn't
[58:05] want to see any perish and you know i
[58:07] have a problem with people who don't
[58:09] want to let other people in and yeah you
[58:11] know i've got a i've got a problem with
[58:12] people who don't want to let other
[58:14] people in the message because they've
[58:15] done this or they've done that but if
[58:17] you look at the spirit of god you know
[58:19] you look at what god does he didn't want
[58:20] to see any perish is that right and if
[58:22] you have a spirit this evening that you
[58:24] want to see others perish or they've
[58:26] maybe done you wrong and you're like
[58:27] well i hope they get what they deserve
[58:29] well if any of us got what we deserved
[58:30] we'd go to we'd go to hell is that right
[58:32] so we don't want anybody to get what
[58:34] they deserve we want we want to get what
[58:36] god has for us and that's the grace
[58:37] that's the long suffering of god and
[58:39] yeah and now brother and he goes on he
[58:41] says the flood stage was past due and i
[58:43] was reading this scripture just a little
[58:45] bit ago and i thought it was so neat
[58:47] how i was looking to see the timing that
[58:49] god shut the door and and if you read
[58:52] the scripture god said the scripture
[58:53] says god shut him in
[58:55] and i began to think about that you know
[58:57] it was noah that was the righteous one
[58:59] is that right he didn't god wasn't
[59:01] saving the animals he wasn't saving this
[59:02] one but he was looking out for noah is
[59:04] that right and the scripture says god
[59:05] shut him in and i believe that's the way
[59:07] he's done the bride he sealed you and i
[59:09] up with the holy ghost to protect us
[59:12] until the rapture is that right now he
[59:14] said noah was the righteous one and he
[59:16] suffered long and he said
[59:18] he said
[59:19] down in egypt it was past due he says do
[59:21] you get it in the anteluvian destruction
[59:23] now he said it was way past due and he
[59:26] said the destruction and judgment and
[59:27] coming out of egypt was past due 40
[59:29] years over time but god was determined
[59:32] god was determined that his word would
[59:34] not return unto him void so we see that
[59:37] when god speaks something it's going to
[59:39] come to pass do you believe that he said
[59:41] he was going to keep his word he was
[59:42] going to keep his word he must do it in
[59:44] order to be god and and he says if he
[59:46] has to make a change of everything by
[59:48] grace he will do it that's the reason i
[59:50] say if the church does not get herself
[59:52] ready and i love this brother brian i'm
[59:54] a highlight he said that's your duty to
[59:55] get ready
[59:57] that's not the pastor's job it's not the
[59:58] ministry's job although that is a part
[1:00:00] of what we are called to do but it is
[1:00:02] your individual duty to get yourself
[1:00:05] ready to meet him in the air is that
[1:00:06] right because there is no man that will
[1:00:08] be able to come up at the day of
[1:00:09] judgment and say well my pastor did this
[1:00:11] or this minister did this or or i didn't
[1:00:13] understand this or i didn't do that each
[1:00:15] of you have been given grace by the gift
[1:00:16] of god that you will be there standing
[1:00:19] on your own accord not on another man's
[1:00:21] accord is that right
[1:00:23] now he says the bride has made herself
[1:00:25] ready the garments is paid for they are
[1:00:26] ready but you must wear you must be
[1:00:29] ready to wear those garments he said the
[1:00:31] church has made herself ready now
[1:00:34] and i thought it was really neat if you
[1:00:35] look at the story of eleazar taking
[1:00:37] rebecca to isaac if you begin to look at
[1:00:39] that story you see that they're going
[1:00:40] back and and they come to it and they
[1:00:42] ask your parents and i know i preached
[1:00:44] on this a while back but it just seems
[1:00:45] like i just keep going back to this but
[1:00:47] they asked they asked everybody if she
[1:00:49] could go and the parents said no let her
[1:00:50] let her tarry for a while but then they
[1:00:52] asked her and she said i will go and and
[1:00:54] so eliezer leaves and they they take her
[1:00:56] and it was so interesting to me that
[1:00:57] when they were coming back on the camels
[1:00:59] as as she was riding back with eleazar
[1:01:02] when she saw isaac off in the field she
[1:01:04] she lit off her camel's what the
[1:01:05] scripture says she said she jumped off
[1:01:07] her camel and and
[1:01:09] the scripture says it's because she
[1:01:10] asked eliezer who is this man and he
[1:01:12] said this is isaac and what did she do
[1:01:15] right then she put a veil over her face
[1:01:17] she was making herself ready for the
[1:01:19] bridegroom and so you and i know who our
[1:01:21] bridegroom is is that right we had a
[1:01:23] prophet come in this day tell us exactly
[1:01:26] who the bridegroom was tell us exactly
[1:01:28] who the bride was and then you and i
[1:01:30] have to make ourselves ready is that
[1:01:32] right yes do you love the lord this
[1:01:34] evening
[1:01:36] now we'll continue on with luke chapter
[1:01:38] 15. we'll move on to verse 18 and work
[1:01:40] our way down through this scripture
[1:01:44] no he said i will arise and go to my
[1:01:46] father and i will say to him father i
[1:01:47] have sinned against heaven and before
[1:01:49] thee
[1:01:50] and i'm no more worthy to be called thy
[1:01:51] son and make me as one of thy hired
[1:01:54] servants
[1:01:55] and he arose and came to his father but
[1:01:56] when he was yet great way off his father
[1:01:58] saw him and had compassion and ran and
[1:02:00] fell on his neck and kissed him and the
[1:02:02] son said unto him father i have sinned
[1:02:04] against heaven and in thy sight and i am
[1:02:06] no more worthy to be called thy son and
[1:02:09] i don't know about you but i felt that
[1:02:10] way many many times and
[1:02:12] and he said but the father said unto his
[1:02:14] servants bring forth the best robe and
[1:02:16] put it on him and you see that he was
[1:02:18] finally ready to wear that robe because
[1:02:20] he realized that it wasn't anything by
[1:02:22] his might but it was by his father's
[1:02:24] mind is that right
[1:02:25] and put a ring on his hand and shoes on
[1:02:27] his feet and he said bring hither the
[1:02:28] fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
[1:02:31] and be merry for this my son was dead
[1:02:33] and is alive again he was lost and is
[1:02:35] found and they begin to be merry
[1:02:38] now brother branham says at the same
[1:02:40] this is recognized in your day and its
[1:02:42] message in 1964 he said at the same time
[1:02:45] the bride has recognized the evening
[1:02:47] light
[1:02:48] just begin to recognize he said the
[1:02:50] hungry pentecostals have begun to
[1:02:52] recognize that them organizations hasn't
[1:02:54] gotten anything that they're looking for
[1:02:57] they're so twisted and tore up he said
[1:02:58] see
[1:02:59] it's time of recognition he said you've
[1:03:01] got to recognize he said the world is
[1:03:03] recognized and i believe i believe
[1:03:05] brother ben has mentioned this the world
[1:03:06] is recognized this is the end time yes
[1:03:08] they they've recognized that this is the
[1:03:10] end and they're preparing themselves for
[1:03:12] destruction he says the nations has
[1:03:14] recognized science has recognized he
[1:03:16] says and the devil has recognized it's
[1:03:18] the time that he can wreck women wreck
[1:03:20] the church wreck the people he's
[1:03:22] recognized that he says but god has
[1:03:24] recognized that there's a people on
[1:03:26] earth predestinated to life so i want
[1:03:28] you to know this evening god has not
[1:03:30] forgotten about you and i is that right
[1:03:32] he said he's recognized this is the time
[1:03:34] to send his message and he did it he
[1:03:36] said the people has recognized that the
[1:03:38] bride time has realized the evening
[1:03:41] light so you see that you and i we had
[1:03:43] something as brother branham talks about
[1:03:45] the deep calling to the deep you and i
[1:03:47] were crying we were searching for
[1:03:49] something we were looking for something
[1:03:51] and whenever we heard this message
[1:03:53] something responded to that we were
[1:03:54] searching for is that right and so we
[1:03:56] can see that as the bride of jesus
[1:03:58] christ he didn't just hand us out here
[1:04:00] and throw us out into the world or throw
[1:04:02] us out as a into the pawn shop but he
[1:04:04] has always had a purpose and a plan for
[1:04:06] our lives is that right we just have to
[1:04:09] trust him
[1:04:10] the scripture says when he returns it
[1:04:12] doesn't say will he find the best church
[1:04:13] or the best dressed or the best this or
[1:04:15] the best that it says will i find faith
[1:04:17] yes amen so we've we've been given the
[1:04:19] fullness of the word we we still receive
[1:04:21] fresh manna from heaven daily and and
[1:04:23] you know the children of israel it's
[1:04:25] amazing how well i'll read it in the
[1:04:27] scripture here in a minute but how god
[1:04:28] took care of them through every trial
[1:04:30] and tribulation to prepare them to not
[1:04:33] forget that god was in charge is that
[1:04:34] right if you look at that now with what
[1:04:36] i'm about to read god is telling the
[1:04:38] people don't forget that i brought you
[1:04:40] through all these things because in good
[1:04:42] times that's when people forget is that
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:45] when everything's bad and it's somehow
[1:04:46] amazing when everything's bad or going
[1:04:48] wrong people remember how to pray but
[1:04:50] when everything's good that's when we
[1:04:51] forget to pray that's when we get lacks
[1:04:53] and i'm preaching to myself this morning
[1:04:55] when times are hard that's when we cry
[1:04:56] out to god but we have to remember as
[1:04:58] the bride of jesus christ it's our duty
[1:05:00] to be responding and worshipping him
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] i want to read from deuteronomy just
[1:05:05] chapter 8 verse 1 and we'll read several
[1:05:08] verses here but
[1:05:11] he says all that all the commandments
[1:05:13] which i commanded thee this day shall ye
[1:05:15] observe to do that ye may live and
[1:05:17] multiply and go in and possess the land
[1:05:20] which the lord swear unto your fathers
[1:05:22] and
[1:05:22] thou shalt remember all the way which
[1:05:24] the lord thy god led thee these forty
[1:05:26] years in the wilderness to humble thee
[1:05:28] and to prove thee
[1:05:30] and know what was in thy heart whether
[1:05:32] thou would us keep his commandments or
[1:05:34] know
[1:05:35] so the purpose was not for god to just
[1:05:37] over overthrow himself over the children
[1:05:40] of israel but to humble thee and to
[1:05:41] prove thee and to know what was in thy
[1:05:43] heart and and so we see that god had a
[1:05:45] purpose for everything that he did and
[1:05:47] everything that he does he has a purpose
[1:05:49] behind it and verse 3 said and he
[1:05:51] humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger
[1:05:52] and fed thee with manna which thou
[1:05:54] knewest not neither did thy fathers know
[1:05:57] that he may make
[1:05:58] thee know that man doth not live by
[1:06:01] bread alone but by every word that
[1:06:02] proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord
[1:06:04] doth man live he said thy raiment wax
[1:06:07] not old upon me neither did thy foot
[1:06:09] swell these forty years so god is saying
[1:06:11] you know i've taken care of you and what
[1:06:13] is he saying this for because he wants
[1:06:14] them to continue to trust him is that
[1:06:16] right
[1:06:17] you know if you don't take care of your
[1:06:19] children they're not going to trust you
[1:06:20] is that right if you if you tell your
[1:06:22] child this and then you go and do that
[1:06:24] and you tell your child this and you go
[1:06:25] and do something complete opposite
[1:06:27] they're not going to trust you because
[1:06:28] they're they're watching you do
[1:06:29] something other than what you're saying
[1:06:31] is that right and right you know the
[1:06:32] other day we were at the ball fields and
[1:06:34] i was looking at you know i i coached my
[1:06:36] son's little league team and and i'm
[1:06:38] always harder on my son because you know
[1:06:40] he's my son i'm with him all the time
[1:06:42] and i was watching another dad and he
[1:06:43] was coaching his son he was doing the
[1:06:45] same thing but he was being just out
[1:06:47] there and i was like god thank you for
[1:06:49] showing me this please never let me do
[1:06:50] that to my son and
[1:06:52] and because you you kind of get lost in
[1:06:54] it there for just for a few minutes and
[1:06:56] you want to take out the rest of the
[1:06:57] team's problems on this one and
[1:06:59] sometimes maybe that would happen with a
[1:07:01] pastor maybe that would happen with a
[1:07:02] minister maybe that would happen with a
[1:07:03] lay member and what we begin to do is if
[1:07:06] something goes wrong and we begin to
[1:07:07] blame this one person is that right i
[1:07:10] don't know why i'm going this direction
[1:07:11] it's not in my nose but we begin to
[1:07:12] blame that one person knowing good and
[1:07:14] well it's not anybody's fault but our
[1:07:16] own is that right and so many times in a
[1:07:18] church what we can do and what we can
[1:07:20] see is is when we begin to blame
[1:07:22] everybody else for our problems you know
[1:07:24] i i read a quote a long time ago and it
[1:07:26] said you know i i don't really
[1:07:28] i'm not too worried about anybody else's
[1:07:30] opinion unless they pay my bills or or
[1:07:32] do this or that and i know that's a
[1:07:34] little bit crude but but i don't think
[1:07:35] you should blame anything on anybody
[1:07:37] else i think we were responsible
[1:07:38] ultimately at the end of the day for how
[1:07:40] you and i live you know you can say well
[1:07:42] i was done wrong by this one or i was
[1:07:44] done wrong by that one and that's a
[1:07:46] horrible thing and i pray that you can
[1:07:47] forgive them and you can all move on but
[1:07:49] but even if they don't they don't ever
[1:07:51] apologize or they don't ever ask for
[1:07:53] forgiveness it's your duty to still
[1:07:55] forgive them is that right the power of
[1:07:57] forgiveness does not set them free it
[1:07:59] sets you free is that right so i believe
[1:08:01] that as sons and daughters of god we
[1:08:03] have the ability to be free but we have
[1:08:05] the power or the authority to set
[1:08:07] ourselves free and sometimes we just
[1:08:09] can't see that
[1:08:10] now he god goes on and he said thou
[1:08:12] shalt not also consider in thine heart
[1:08:14] that as a man shaithaness his son
[1:08:17] so the lord god chasteneth thee
[1:08:20] therefore thou shalt keep the
[1:08:21] commandments of the lord thy god to walk
[1:08:24] in his ways and to fear him
[1:08:26] for the lord thy god bringeth thee into
[1:08:28] a good land a land of brooks and water
[1:08:29] of fountains and depths of the springs
[1:08:31] out of the valleys of the hills and a
[1:08:33] land of wheat and barley and vines and
[1:08:35] fig trees and pomegranates a land of
[1:08:37] olive olive and honey and
[1:08:39] he said a land wherein thou shalt eat
[1:08:41] bread without scarceness thou shalt not
[1:08:43] lack anything in it the land whose
[1:08:45] stones are iron and who out of heels
[1:08:47] thou may dig breath now this sounds like
[1:08:49] a pretty good place you know it's like
[1:08:51] if somebody called you and said i've got
[1:08:52] a place for you to live it's free
[1:08:54] the fridge is restocked on a daily basis
[1:08:57] the the insurance is paid the electric's
[1:08:59] paid everything you need is there
[1:09:01] all you've got to do is follow the lord
[1:09:04] right and so we see that god's doing
[1:09:06] this and one thou hast eaten and art
[1:09:07] full thou shalt bless the lord thy god
[1:09:10] for the good of the land which he hath
[1:09:12] given thee
[1:09:13] now in verse 11 this is very important
[1:09:15] it says be be aware
[1:09:17] that thou forget not the lord thy god in
[1:09:19] not keeping his commandments and his
[1:09:21] judgments and his statues which i
[1:09:23] command thee this day now this is
[1:09:25] probably an odd scripture to read after
[1:09:27] the prodigal son scripture because what
[1:09:29] did he do he did everything opposite
[1:09:31] this he went away
[1:09:32] he wasted his living he went to the
[1:09:34] wrong land but as i said at the
[1:09:36] beginning we want to look at the
[1:09:37] prodigal son's brother this evening but
[1:09:40] god is dealing with his people that are
[1:09:42] about to experience really good times
[1:09:45] and he's being very very hard on them
[1:09:47] he's saying you're about to experience
[1:09:48] all this your belly will not be will not
[1:09:50] be empty your belly will be full
[1:09:52] everything you have need of you're about
[1:09:53] to be blessed greatly but he knows how
[1:09:56] people get and so he's saying in all
[1:09:58] this good time forget not what i have
[1:10:00] commanded thee and now he says
[1:10:03] then shot he says and when the herds and
[1:10:05] thy flocks multiply thy silver and thy
[1:10:07] gold is multiplied and all that thou
[1:10:09] hast is multiplied
[1:10:11] then thy heart be lifted up and thou
[1:10:13] forget the lord thy god which brought
[1:10:14] thee forth out of the land of egypt from
[1:10:17] the house of bondage now we were all no
[1:10:20] matter your condition if you were raised
[1:10:22] in a message church or cut your teeth on
[1:10:24] a message pew or how young you were you
[1:10:26] were raised in a house of bondage and
[1:10:28] god had to set you free god had to save
[1:10:30] your soul you know maybe somebody was
[1:10:32] out doing way worse things than you were
[1:10:34] but you still needed the same grace and
[1:10:36] the same blood that that person needed
[1:10:38] amen no one should ought to think highly
[1:10:40] of himself than the other because we all
[1:10:42] needed the same thing and that was the
[1:10:44] grace of almighty god
[1:10:46] he goes on in verse 15 he said who led
[1:10:48] you through the great and terrible
[1:10:50] wilderness wearing fiery serpents and
[1:10:52] scorpions and drought and there was no
[1:10:54] water who brought thee forth water out
[1:10:56] of the rock of flynn he said
[1:10:58] who fed thee in the wilderness with
[1:10:59] manna and thy fathers knew not that
[1:11:02] that he might humble thee and that he
[1:11:04] might prove thee to do the good in thy
[1:11:06] latter end
[1:11:08] and thou shalt say in thine heart my
[1:11:09] power and my might
[1:11:11] hand and my might of my hand hath gotten
[1:11:13] me this wealth but thou shalt remember
[1:11:15] the lord thy god for it is he
[1:11:18] that giveth the power to get wealth that
[1:11:20] he may establish his covenant which he
[1:11:23] swear unto his fathers as it is this day
[1:11:25] yes and i think this applies really good
[1:11:27] to us that in our jobs and in our in our
[1:11:30] home life and the things that god gives
[1:11:32] us even in earthly possessions we should
[1:11:34] never forget that it's god who gives us
[1:11:37] each item that you and i possess is that
[1:11:39] right
[1:11:40] no matter if you're if you're rich or
[1:11:42] you're poor whatever you've got if
[1:11:43] you've got good health or bad health
[1:11:45] whatever you've got that's good in your
[1:11:46] life we cannot forget that god has given
[1:11:49] us those things
[1:11:50] now he says
[1:11:52] and i'm gonna just read two more scripts
[1:11:54] and he said it shall be if thou do all
[1:11:56] forget the lord thy god and walk after
[1:11:58] other gods and serve them and worship
[1:12:00] them i testify against you this day that
[1:12:02] you shall surely perish as the nations
[1:12:05] which the lord destroyed before your
[1:12:07] face so shall you perish because you
[1:12:09] would not be obedient to the voice of
[1:12:12] the lord your god
[1:12:14] now they had the commandment in the
[1:12:15] scripture warning them not to forget
[1:12:17] about god and not to forget that there
[1:12:19] they were they were nothing without him
[1:12:22] and that he was everything and that that
[1:12:24] they should continue to walk in the
[1:12:25] light as he is in the light and and so
[1:12:27] we see that all these things are coming
[1:12:29] down to the children of israel and and
[1:12:31] god is telling them you know don't
[1:12:32] forget me in the good times don't forget
[1:12:34] me in the good times you don't just need
[1:12:35] me in the bad but remember me in the
[1:12:36] good
[1:12:37] john 8 and verse 12 says then speak
[1:12:39] jesus again unto them saying i am the
[1:12:41] light of the world and he that followeth
[1:12:43] me shall not walk in darkness but hat
[1:12:45] shall have the light of life so we see
[1:12:48] that we are not to come to this age and
[1:12:50] come to the end of this age and
[1:12:51] denominate around one little idea or one
[1:12:53] little thing but we've got to continue
[1:12:55] marching on in the light is that right
[1:12:57] that's why i believe god called men of
[1:12:59] god because you know brother ram said
[1:13:01] even when we get over to the other side
[1:13:02] things will continue to be unfolding
[1:13:04] throughout eternity and i believe that
[1:13:06] the word has come in its fullness and
[1:13:08] that we have the fullness of the word
[1:13:09] but i believe god brings ministers and
[1:13:11] he brings pastors and he brings
[1:13:13] different ones and and even on the tapes
[1:13:15] things are still unfolding but but god
[1:13:17] brings them for a purpose and that's to
[1:13:19] work out a better thing in our life is
[1:13:21] that right
[1:13:23] first john 1 7 it says but if we walk in
[1:13:25] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:13:27] fellowship one with another and the
[1:13:28] blood of jesus christ his son
[1:13:31] cleanseth us from all sins now we'll
[1:13:34] jump back to the prodigal son here in
[1:13:35] luke verse 15 and chapter 25 and we'll
[1:13:37] look at his brother here and
[1:13:39] it says now his elder son was in the
[1:13:41] field and as he came and drew night of
[1:13:42] the house he heard music and dancing and
[1:13:46] he called one of the servants and he
[1:13:47] asked what these things meant and he
[1:13:49] said unto him thy brother has come and
[1:13:51] thy father hath killed the fatted calf
[1:13:53] because he hath received him
[1:13:54] safe and sound and the next verse that
[1:13:57] says and he was
[1:13:58] angry all right yeah so his brother's
[1:14:01] come back home and he's changed his life
[1:14:04] and now he's angry
[1:14:06] he said he would not go in
[1:14:08] now maybe this is a little bit more
[1:14:10] harsh than what some of us do but
[1:14:12] maybe sometimes we see god bless another
[1:14:14] individual in the church or in the body
[1:14:16] of the bride and we get a little jealous
[1:14:19] and say well god is doing this for them
[1:14:21] and god's doing this for them and well
[1:14:23] i'm just not even going to participate
[1:14:24] or go in with them i'm just going to i'm
[1:14:25] just going to isolate myself and pull
[1:14:27] off to the side
[1:14:30] and he said he was angry and would not
[1:14:31] go in therefore his father came out as
[1:14:33] father and entreated him and
[1:14:36] you know i love in this story you know
[1:14:37] the the father goes out to the to the
[1:14:39] son that went away and he goes out to
[1:14:40] the son that stayed home
[1:14:42] you know whenever the scripture says
[1:14:44] that we love him because he first loved
[1:14:46] us there's proof after proof after the
[1:14:48] scripture that he come searching for you
[1:14:50] and i we weren't looking for him he was
[1:14:52] looking for us
[1:14:53] and he said he said and he answered and
[1:14:55] said to his father lo these many years
[1:14:57] do i serve thee
[1:14:58] neither transgressed i at any time thy
[1:15:01] commandment brother ben this was this
[1:15:03] was your front row
[1:15:05] this was your front row lay member right
[1:15:06] here was this guy he was he was better
[1:15:08] than joel he was here every service
[1:15:10] dressed to the nines he was a good guy
[1:15:12] right he was better than brother stewart
[1:15:14] was he was better than brother jerome he
[1:15:16] was the best church member
[1:15:18] but he got treated a little differently
[1:15:20] he thought another person got treated a
[1:15:22] little better than they ought to be
[1:15:23] treated
[1:15:24] and so we see he says when he said
[1:15:26] and yet thou never gave us me a kid that
[1:15:29] i may
[1:15:30] might make mary with my friend so he's
[1:15:32] saying you know all these years i've
[1:15:34] served you i've come to church
[1:15:35] not just sunday morning but sunday night
[1:15:38] and not only sunday night but this was a
[1:15:39] wednesday night goer right
[1:15:41] this guy was hardcore he was there if we
[1:15:43] had a special meeting or a prayer
[1:15:45] meeting he was there and he said and i
[1:15:47] i've been there all this time and now
[1:15:49] one not one time did you make mary or
[1:15:51] give me the kid
[1:15:53] and so you didn't let me celebrate with
[1:15:54] my friends we didn't throw a party and
[1:15:57] he said and verse 30 says but as soon as
[1:15:59] thy son was come which hath devoured thy
[1:16:01] living with harlots thou has killed for
[1:16:04] him the fatted calf and so he's saying
[1:16:06] you know this guy that was out in the
[1:16:07] world went and lived actually with
[1:16:09] prostitutes and went and wasted all the
[1:16:11] money that you had worked hard for when
[1:16:13] he comes home
[1:16:15] you let him have a party right
[1:16:17] and verse 31 and i want you to remember
[1:16:20] it's not god's fault yeah and he said
[1:16:22] and he said unto him son thou are ever
[1:16:24] with me and all that i have
[1:16:26] is thine so i want to look this this
[1:16:28] evening if we could just on that
[1:16:30] scripture for a minute
[1:16:31] everything that his father had was his
[1:16:34] is that right he said son everything
[1:16:36] that i have is yours and i give it to
[1:16:38] you but the son failed to do one thing
[1:16:41] take authority and use what his father
[1:16:43] had given and i say is the bride of
[1:16:45] jesus christ god has given us all powers
[1:16:47] over every evil thing but you and i will
[1:16:50] sit there and set on a pew and refuse to
[1:16:52] take authority to use what god has given
[1:16:56] us but when someone comes in and they
[1:16:58] have faith to believe and god begins to
[1:16:59] work in their lives it's not our job to
[1:17:01] pucker up and say well that's not fair
[1:17:04] you've had the right since god filled
[1:17:06] you with the holy ghost to take that
[1:17:08] authority and use it for what you had
[1:17:10] needed so what the father is saying is
[1:17:12] if you needed a fatted calf it was there
[1:17:15] if you needed healing it was there it's
[1:17:17] your fault that you didn't go and get
[1:17:19] the kid and be merry with your friends
[1:17:21] so we see it in the next verse he says
[1:17:23] it was meat it was and that word meat
[1:17:26] means necessary that we should make mary
[1:17:28] and be glad for this thy brother was
[1:17:30] dead and is alive again and was lost and
[1:17:33] is found so i think we ought to rejoice
[1:17:35] when a son and daughter comes back to
[1:17:36] god is that right but we must never
[1:17:38] forget that whenever we're having good
[1:17:40] times as this one was he was at church
[1:17:42] he was doing this he was doing that we
[1:17:44] must never forget that we still have the
[1:17:46] authority to act on god's power is that
[1:17:49] right that if you need your family if
[1:17:51] you've got a loved one that's lost and
[1:17:53] out there you have the authority to
[1:17:55] claim the word of god and call god after
[1:17:57] that son or daughter is that right yeah
[1:18:00] so we can see that many times you know
[1:18:01] if if i was to take candy home and let's
[1:18:04] say that matthew maybe ran away and in
[1:18:06] paxton there was the candy bucket there
[1:18:07] and i'm just going to bring it down into
[1:18:09] layman's terms and and you know and man
[1:18:11] he comes home and i'm so excited to see
[1:18:13] him so i give him all this candy and he
[1:18:14] eats and he eats and he eats and paxton
[1:18:17] comes mad to me says why didn't you give
[1:18:18] me any of the candy and i can say it was
[1:18:20] there all the time yeah and i feel like
[1:18:22] there's so many believers that live
[1:18:24] below their privilege
[1:18:25] you know brother branham said we've got
[1:18:26] a checkbook with no balance on it right
[1:18:29] that there's an unlimited balance that
[1:18:30] we can write the check and it will be
[1:18:32] good when we take it to the bank i feel
[1:18:35] like sometimes we allow ourselves to
[1:18:36] maybe be sicker than we should be and
[1:18:38] maybe we allow ourselves to be depressed
[1:18:40] more than we should be or we we try to
[1:18:42] let we try to isolate ourselves and feel
[1:18:44] all alone and feel this way in that way
[1:18:46] but i want you to know you know one one
[1:18:48] trick of the devil is he likes to come
[1:18:50] in and he likes to just give you a
[1:18:52] thought and he likes you to feed that
[1:18:54] thought
[1:18:55] he will make you think that maybe maybe
[1:18:57] somebody doesn't like you or maybe
[1:18:58] somebody doesn't love you or maybe the
[1:19:00] pastor likes this one a little bit
[1:19:01] better and he'll give you that little
[1:19:03] thought and and then he doesn't have to
[1:19:05] do anything but if you feed on that
[1:19:06] thought you will feed it and you will
[1:19:08] feed it and it will grow and it will
[1:19:10] grow until it consumes you is that right
[1:19:12] and then when the lost soul comes in you
[1:19:14] can't even be excited because you're
[1:19:15] living in a dead state
[1:19:17] now we had to see that this prodigal son
[1:19:20] that was home
[1:19:21] just like the prodigal son that went
[1:19:22] away
[1:19:23] he failed to realize that he was the son
[1:19:26] right
[1:19:27] he failed to realize that all the father
[1:19:29] had was his if you read that scripture
[1:19:31] at the beginning
[1:19:32] and you look at the scripture where the
[1:19:33] prodigal sons leaves
[1:19:35] the father it says the father divided
[1:19:37] among them his living
[1:19:40] he gave the other son his living at that
[1:19:42] time
[1:19:43] and so this son had failed to use what
[1:19:45] god had given him
[1:19:46] both sons were living below their
[1:19:48] privileges now brother braham says in 56
[1:19:50] and jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:19:52] today and forever he says have faith in
[1:19:54] god
[1:19:54] he said just only believe he said oh all
[1:19:57] you've got to do is believe
[1:19:59] or he says all of you ought to believe
[1:20:01] he said this is for our hour and it's
[1:20:03] encouraging if you just had faith he
[1:20:05] said jesus already done the work he said
[1:20:08] this is just his love and grace to you
[1:20:10] can't you see
[1:20:12] he said as cleopas and them walked along
[1:20:14] the way he said they walked with them
[1:20:16] all day and didn't know it but the way
[1:20:18] he did something they recognized that it
[1:20:20] was him and he said well i tried to tell
[1:20:22] you that that that when he was here on
[1:20:24] earth they would recognize the same way
[1:20:26] he says you've walked with him a long
[1:20:27] time maybe in your church and didn't
[1:20:30] know it
[1:20:31] he said but he's here he's alive he
[1:20:33] isn't dead so maybe you've been walking
[1:20:36] as cleopas and them you've been sitting
[1:20:38] in church and you've been walking right
[1:20:39] along with everybody and not even
[1:20:41] realizing that jesus christ is here in
[1:20:43] our midst and still alive today he's
[1:20:45] still with us today to perform miracles
[1:20:48] and and he's still able to do these
[1:20:49] things but you've got to have your eyes
[1:20:51] open so that you can have that authority
[1:20:53] to call on the power of almighty god
[1:20:55] now i i was i don't remember who
[1:20:57] preached on samson last i think it was
[1:20:58] either brother stewart or brother joel
[1:21:00] but
[1:21:01] whoever it was it was really neat how
[1:21:03] how you were you were preaching and
[1:21:05] and i'll begin i just jotted down a note
[1:21:06] and and i began to look at this story a
[1:21:08] little bit more but you know the
[1:21:09] philistines thought the power laid in
[1:21:12] samson yes
[1:21:13] and that's where they messed up what did
[1:21:15] they do they broke down samson and i
[1:21:17] believe the devil has failed to realize
[1:21:19] that the power is not in the bride but
[1:21:21] it's in god as that ride and we have you
[1:21:24] know as brother branham talks about the
[1:21:25] little policeman he says you know he
[1:21:26] could not stop a 300 horsepower car but
[1:21:29] he has the authority behind him of that
[1:21:32] city and that government to stop him
[1:21:34] just as you and i have the authority of
[1:21:36] jesus christ because we're joined heirs
[1:21:38] with christ is that right so everything
[1:21:40] he had a privilege to you and i have a
[1:21:42] privilege too
[1:21:44] and so you see the phyllis the
[1:21:45] philistines they begin to break down
[1:21:47] samson they plucked out his eye they
[1:21:48] shaved his head and they did all these
[1:21:50] things but they failed to realize that
[1:21:52] samson's power did not come from himself
[1:21:55] but it come from god is that right and
[1:21:57] so maybe some of you are sitting here
[1:21:58] broken today maybe some of you are down
[1:22:00] or you're just tired or you're maybe
[1:22:02] just weary along the way but i want you
[1:22:04] to know your power doesn't come from in
[1:22:05] yourself but it comes from almighty god
[1:22:08] and that's a power that will never run
[1:22:10] dry do you believe that
[1:22:12] so just whenever you know i i love that
[1:22:14] how you know the the devil thought that
[1:22:15] the power was maybe within you and i but
[1:22:17] the power was in god and god will not
[1:22:19] lose a one do you believe that yes
[1:22:22] do you love the lord this evening
[1:22:27] i made myself promise that my gift to
[1:22:28] all the mothers this evening would be
[1:22:30] not to hold you all very long so
[1:22:32] i have a timer set
[1:22:35] we were talking in the back how i like
[1:22:36] to preach on grace and
[1:22:38] i really do and
[1:22:40] it's because where much grace is given
[1:22:42] there's just much love right
[1:22:44] i needed a lot of grace and i feel like
[1:22:46] i still need grace every day
[1:22:48] and you know i i don't want to ever
[1:22:50] think too highly of myself because i can
[1:22:52] promise you this every time i've thought
[1:22:54] highly of myself my bubble has been
[1:22:55] busted publicly
[1:22:58] it's like god doesn't just let me do it
[1:22:59] on my own he's like no i'm gonna you
[1:23:01] know i'm gonna shame you in public so
[1:23:03] that you know that it's not by your own
[1:23:05] hand and you know god doesn't do that
[1:23:07] because he hates us god does that
[1:23:08] because he loves us right
[1:23:10] i see some of you smiling because some
[1:23:12] of you are probably there for most of
[1:23:14] those situations but
[1:23:16] you know
[1:23:17] one time i was a young man and i'll tell
[1:23:19] this to lighten it up because everybody
[1:23:20] is very tired and
[1:23:22] i can see it on your faces that you had
[1:23:24] too much food and
[1:23:26] just jealous i'm not really sad i'm just
[1:23:29] jealous but
[1:23:31] one time i was a young man and i
[1:23:33] they were gonna let me call out the
[1:23:35] minister
[1:23:36] and i thought it was a pretty big deal
[1:23:37] and i was kind of walking tall
[1:23:40] and this is why i don't like getting up
[1:23:41] in front of people anymore and i get up
[1:23:42] there to call out the minister's name
[1:23:44] i forgot it
[1:23:47] and i panicked old immediately and said
[1:23:50] the brother that's going to preach and
[1:23:52] then i just put the mic down and walked
[1:23:53] out of the church and
[1:23:55] it was a little church in in north
[1:23:57] carolina but god has a way of putting us
[1:24:00] putting us in our place right
[1:24:02] because none of us are higher than we
[1:24:04] are none of us ought to think higher
[1:24:05] than we are but
[1:24:07] you know the whole point behind this
[1:24:08] sermon this evening is to realize that
[1:24:10] in good conditions what do you do
[1:24:14] because it's not in bad conditions we
[1:24:16] all know what we do in bad conditions we
[1:24:17] cry out to god is that right if you look
[1:24:19] at every bad condition in the bible
[1:24:21] people are crying out to god people are
[1:24:22] searching for god but in the good
[1:24:24] conditions in the good times people fail
[1:24:26] to realize that god is still the same
[1:24:28] god is that right he's still worthy of
[1:24:30] our praise and that's something i've
[1:24:32] been wanting to work on is when i
[1:24:34] worship god even if i don't like the
[1:24:35] song or don't maybe even maybe maybe
[1:24:37] that message isn't resounding with me
[1:24:39] like it is with somebody else i should
[1:24:41] still praise him is that right even if
[1:24:43] everything's going good and everything's
[1:24:46] going okay you know i found a little
[1:24:47] note in my bible when paxton was sick
[1:24:50] and i wrote out there that you know i'm
[1:24:51] so happy and grateful that my son is now
[1:24:53] healed and that my family is happy and
[1:24:55] healthy and you know in that time i was
[1:24:57] fasting i was praying i was doing all
[1:24:59] these things and it began to really
[1:25:00] prick my i think i found that note for a
[1:25:02] reason because it kind of struck home
[1:25:03] with me that i'm not doing those things
[1:25:05] right now because things are good
[1:25:06] everybody's healthy everybody's happy
[1:25:08] and everything's going good but you know
[1:25:10] i must not forget him in those good
[1:25:12] times is that right whenever things
[1:25:14] going good with the family we ought to
[1:25:16] take that time and maybe kill an extra
[1:25:17] devil is that right maybe when the house
[1:25:20] is clean we ought to make sure that
[1:25:21] every closet is clean and every every
[1:25:23] laundry room in the attic make sure that
[1:25:25] we've got it cleaned out we don't want
[1:25:27] to just win a battle but we're here to
[1:25:29] win the war do you believe that
[1:25:31] second corinthians 5 and verse 15 it
[1:25:33] says all that he died
[1:25:35] and that he died for all and they which
[1:25:38] should live should not henceforth live
[1:25:40] unto themselves but unto him which died
[1:25:42] for them and rose again so it's saying
[1:25:45] that when he died for us we don't live
[1:25:46] for ourselves anymore but we live for
[1:25:48] christ is that right everything that you
[1:25:51] do even though it seems maybe maybe
[1:25:53] whenever you're working maybe brother
[1:25:54] caleb when you're painting a home you're
[1:25:56] doing this or you're doing that every
[1:25:58] every stroke of that brush everything
[1:25:59] you do ought to be glorifying god is
[1:26:02] that right
[1:26:03] it says wherefore henceforth know ye
[1:26:06] says no we know man after the flesh yea
[1:26:08] though we have known christ after the
[1:26:10] flesh ye now henceforth no we no we know
[1:26:13] him no more says therefore if any man be
[1:26:16] in christ he's a new creature old things
[1:26:18] are passed away behold all things become
[1:26:21] new and he says all things are of god
[1:26:24] who hath reconciled us him us to himself
[1:26:27] by jesus christ and hath given us the
[1:26:30] ministry of reconciliation
[1:26:32] now all of us like to say that god has
[1:26:34] reconciled us through
[1:26:36] to christ through to to jesus is that
[1:26:38] right we're reconciled us to god through
[1:26:40] jesus excuse me it's been a long time
[1:26:42] since i preached i'm getting a little
[1:26:43] tongue tied
[1:26:45] but god reconciled us unto himself
[1:26:48] through jesus christ right yeah so and
[1:26:50] then it also the very next sentence says
[1:26:52] and give us the ministry of
[1:26:53] reconciliation and i would i'd be
[1:26:56] far-fetched to say many of you grew up
[1:26:57] in the message our our theme has not
[1:26:59] been reconciliation but it's been
[1:27:01] division or been this or that or two
[1:27:03] side are you on and i think if anybody
[1:27:05] ever asked you whose side you're on you
[1:27:06] ought to say i'm on the lord's side is
[1:27:08] that right i'm not on any man's side i'm
[1:27:10] on god's side and we ought to have the
[1:27:12] ministry of reconciliation that when
[1:27:14] somebody separates we not maybe not
[1:27:16] ought to cut them off or cut their head
[1:27:18] off or cut their feet out from under
[1:27:20] them but we ought to pray to try to
[1:27:21] reconcile them back to god through who
[1:27:24] jesus christ amen not through a man not
[1:27:27] through this one or through that one but
[1:27:29] the same way that god brought us back to
[1:27:30] him through jesus christ
[1:27:33] verse 19 it says to with that god was in
[1:27:35] christ reconciling the world unto
[1:27:37] himself
[1:27:38] not imputing their trespasses unto them
[1:27:41] and hath committed unto us the word of
[1:27:43] reconciliation
[1:27:45] says now then we are ambassadors for
[1:27:47] christ as though god did beseech you by
[1:27:50] us and we pray you in christ's stead be
[1:27:53] you reconciled to god so he's talking
[1:27:55] here the men come and they preach the
[1:27:57] message of jesus christ but they say
[1:27:59] don't be reconciled to us right don't be
[1:28:01] reconciled to the ministry but to
[1:28:03] god he says for he hath made him to be
[1:28:06] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[1:28:08] be made the righteousness of god in him
[1:28:11] and this word reconcile it means to call
[1:28:13] back into union and friendship
[1:28:16] the affections which we have which have
[1:28:18] been alienated to restore to friendship
[1:28:20] or or favor after estrangement reconcile
[1:28:24] men or parties that have been at
[1:28:26] variance so if god has given us the the
[1:28:28] ministry of reconciliation
[1:28:31] then our ministry ought to be and to go
[1:28:33] and get those who've left right not to
[1:28:35] further kick them out not to further
[1:28:37] push them away and it's not to grow
[1:28:39] numbers in the church but it's to call
[1:28:41] and do what god called us to do and be a
[1:28:43] witness to all those in the world is
[1:28:45] that right in laodicea yes now brother
[1:28:48] brown says in the waters of separation
[1:28:50] i've got just a few more minutes and my
[1:28:51] timer is going to go off so just bear
[1:28:53] with me and and then you can go be in a
[1:28:55] food coma with your mom and
[1:28:57] and celebrate mother's day the right way
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:00] and so he went down to the gates he says
[1:29:02] now look to do the work of a kinsman he
[1:29:04] says he said you ministers this may not
[1:29:06] be new but for the congregation he went
[1:29:08] down to the gate and he says where all
[1:29:09] the elders of israel come in and a
[1:29:11] kinsmen now he said to redeem and he
[1:29:14] must be a near kinsman he can't just be
[1:29:16] anybody he must be a kinsmen and that's
[1:29:19] you know
[1:29:20] jesus wasn't just anybody right
[1:29:23] he wasn't just another prophet he wasn't
[1:29:25] just another person walking this earth
[1:29:27] this was the fullness of the godhead
[1:29:28] bodily in flesh is that right this was
[1:29:31] god made flesh so it wasn't just anybody
[1:29:33] coming down it wasn't an angel it wasn't
[1:29:35] this one it wasn't that one but this was
[1:29:37] jesus christ the fullness of the godhead
[1:29:39] bodily and he come down as a near
[1:29:41] kinsman he says he must be a kinsmen he
[1:29:43] says and look he said how god being back
[1:29:46] in spirit was manifested in the flesh
[1:29:49] and took on the human form and of man to
[1:29:52] become kin folks to the human race he
[1:29:53] said to know what suffering means and to
[1:29:55] know what sickness means and what
[1:29:57] temptation means he said god become a
[1:30:00] man
[1:30:00] to become kin folks to redeem man back
[1:30:03] to himself he said oh if you can only
[1:30:06] see that you sinner tonight it will
[1:30:07] merit he said it ought to melt your
[1:30:09] heart and so you and i as believers
[1:30:12] we've seen that we've seen what god did
[1:30:13] for you and i that he come down he
[1:30:15] became flesh so that he could feel and
[1:30:17] go through the things that you and i go
[1:30:19] through ephesians 2 and 13 it says but
[1:30:21] now
[1:30:22] in christ jesus ye who sometimes were
[1:30:24] afar off made nigh by the blood of
[1:30:26] christ
[1:30:27] for he is our peace which hath made both
[1:30:30] one and hath broken down the middle wall
[1:30:32] of partition between us he said see god
[1:30:35] back yonder being holy when he walked
[1:30:36] with moses as a pillar of fire on top of
[1:30:38] the mountain if any man touched that
[1:30:40] mountain he must be killed he said it
[1:30:42] was god
[1:30:43] trying to get into man's heart
[1:30:45] and you know if you look down through
[1:30:46] the scripture it was god above us god
[1:30:48] with us and then god in us it was god
[1:30:50] above us in the pillar of fire speaking
[1:30:52] there with moses it was god with us in
[1:30:54] jesus christ and then it's god in us in
[1:30:56] the form of the holy ghost is that right
[1:30:58] god did not change the power did not
[1:31:00] change nothing changed other than the
[1:31:02] distance or the form that god was in is
[1:31:04] that right and so you and i as being
[1:31:06] joint heirs with christ means that
[1:31:08] everything that christ was entitled to
[1:31:10] when it was god with us
[1:31:12] now being god in us everything that
[1:31:14] jesus had all that power you and i have
[1:31:17] access to the authority to act on that
[1:31:19] power is that right do we understand
[1:31:21] that this mor this evening
[1:31:22] the next thing god did was manifested in
[1:31:24] flesh in christ and he said god was in
[1:31:26] christ reconciling the world to himself
[1:31:29] and and he was born a man here made kin
[1:31:32] folks he said in order to pay the price
[1:31:34] of redemption
[1:31:36] he said then he was killed there in
[1:31:38] order for his spirit might be set free
[1:31:40] to come back in the form of the holy
[1:31:41] spirit
[1:31:42] and he said all that god was he emptied
[1:31:44] into christ and he said all the great
[1:31:46] eternals of god was emptied into christ
[1:31:49] and he said all that christ was he
[1:31:51] emptied into the church and he said and
[1:31:53] men and women are afraid to claim their
[1:31:55] god-given given privileges and stand
[1:31:58] upon the truth of it and i say today you
[1:32:00] and i we have the the duty to recognize
[1:32:03] who we are as the prodigal son
[1:32:05] recognized who he was in the pigpen as
[1:32:08] his brother recognized who he was even
[1:32:10] though he stayed at home he did
[1:32:11] everything right he was living below his
[1:32:13] privileges and so remember the title of
[1:32:16] the of the of the sermon is all he has
[1:32:18] and so i want you to know this evening
[1:32:20] all that god has he's given you access
[1:32:22] to it amen if you're if you're living
[1:32:24] below your if your spiritual life's not
[1:32:26] where it needs to be it's not the
[1:32:27] pastor's fault it's not god's fault he's
[1:32:30] given you everything that he has it's
[1:32:32] your it's on you and it's on your duty
[1:32:35] and so you know it's amazing to me we
[1:32:36] don't like to hear that it's our
[1:32:38] responsibility right i would love for it
[1:32:40] to be brother ben's responsibility for
[1:32:42] my spiritual walk it'd be much easier on
[1:32:44] me if he had to study if he had to do
[1:32:46] all the praying if he had to do the late
[1:32:48] nights laying in bed thinking and
[1:32:50] wondering god well you know god am i
[1:32:52] doing this right am i doing this right
[1:32:53] as a father as a leader am i doing this
[1:32:55] right but unfortunately it's not up to
[1:32:57] him
[1:32:58] he has his part to play in it as a
[1:33:00] pastor he has to bring the word and lead
[1:33:03] and guide us and as a lay member here
[1:33:05] i've put my trust that god has called
[1:33:07] him to do that and i will follow him as
[1:33:09] he follows christ is that right but it's
[1:33:11] not up to him as my spiritual walk with
[1:33:13] christ if it's good or if it's bad it's
[1:33:15] up to you and it's up to me right and so
[1:33:17] if you're living below your privilege
[1:33:19] this evening i want you to know you can
[1:33:20] live a little bit higher you can be a
[1:33:22] little bit happier you know
[1:33:24] i've always disbelieved the the the
[1:33:26] thought and the message that we should
[1:33:28] be uh people sometimes confuse
[1:33:30] humbleness with sadness yeah
[1:33:32] sure right
[1:33:33] we feel like we gotta be humble but some
[1:33:35] people just interpret that as sad yeah
[1:33:38] right that's not what it means to be
[1:33:40] humble sometimes when we get humbled we
[1:33:42] get sad
[1:33:44] right when i was humbled i got sad i was
[1:33:46] like man this is terrible i don't feel
[1:33:48] good about this you know everybody no
[1:33:50] matter who we are we like an atta boy we
[1:33:52] like a pat on the back
[1:33:54] everybody as much as i say i don't care
[1:33:56] what people think i can preach until i'm
[1:33:57] blue in the face i still care what
[1:33:59] people think
[1:34:01] i can't help but we're all human is that
[1:34:03] right let's just preach just a little
[1:34:05] bit for a few minutes tonight we're all
[1:34:06] human we care what other people think
[1:34:09] but when it comes to what you think and
[1:34:10] what god thinks guess who's that guess
[1:34:12] who's what i'm worried about gods i'm
[1:34:14] not worried about your opinion anymore
[1:34:16] after that if your opinion says well you
[1:34:18] ought to do this but god's word says you
[1:34:20] ought to do that i'm going to do what
[1:34:21] god's word says is that right so we
[1:34:24] ought never be caught between two
[1:34:25] opinions that we ought to do this or we
[1:34:27] ought to do that but we've got to find
[1:34:28] the word of god and it's got to be our
[1:34:31] anchor is that right it's got to be our
[1:34:33] our tie post that we can go back to and
[1:34:35] we can have something to go to now
[1:34:38] when i was in dallas last week and i
[1:34:39] know my time's about up and i was in
[1:34:41] dallas last week and i was talking to a
[1:34:43] young man that had lost a child at a
[1:34:44] very young age he was a nominal
[1:34:46] christian but you know he was telling me
[1:34:48] how you know how most people go through
[1:34:49] divorces at that they lost a little
[1:34:51] two-year-old in a car wreck and i was
[1:34:53] just i was just amazed by his faith it
[1:34:55] was you know probably greater than mine
[1:34:57] and he never heard of the message and or
[1:34:59] maybe that i know of that he hadn't and
[1:35:02] and so you know just listen but i said
[1:35:04] you know i'm so glad we have a hope yeah
[1:35:06] you know and i begin to think about that
[1:35:08] and study you know i wonder why the
[1:35:10] world's so crazy and why people are just
[1:35:12] just throwing out things that loose ends
[1:35:13] it's because they don't have a hope but
[1:35:15] you and i we have a hope that is sure
[1:35:17] and that is solid it's a foundation that
[1:35:19] we know is tried and true and so as
[1:35:21] believers we have such a blessing or
[1:35:24] we're so blessed that we have a hope
[1:35:25] that we can go back to and know that
[1:35:27] it's a sure thing is that right yes
[1:35:30] you know my timer went off but i'm just
[1:35:32] going to read this quote and then i'll
[1:35:33] be done and it says a little while in
[1:35:35] the world seeth me no more yet you shall
[1:35:37] see me for i'll be with you i'll be in
[1:35:40] you even to the end of the world he says
[1:35:42] christ the same yesterday today and
[1:35:44] forever your kinsmen redeemer
[1:35:46] said god himself made flesh here on
[1:35:48] earth to take away the sins and clean
[1:35:50] out of all the way
[1:35:51] he says that he might have fellowship
[1:35:53] again
[1:35:54] with his creature
[1:35:56] and you know when i begin to look
[1:35:58] through this and musicians if you want
[1:35:59] to go ahead and come as we as we go
[1:36:01] ahead and begin to close but
[1:36:03] i begin to look at this and and i begin
[1:36:05] to study what brother branham talks
[1:36:06] about you know when he talks about the
[1:36:08] fall
[1:36:10] the whole story of redemption is so god
[1:36:12] can have fellowship with his people
[1:36:13] again
[1:36:15] you know it kind of made me feel really
[1:36:16] bad
[1:36:17] how i act sometimes at church because
[1:36:19] god
[1:36:20] whole plan
[1:36:22] was to have fellowship with me again
[1:36:25] fellowship with you and i again
[1:36:27] and sometimes i come to church and maybe
[1:36:28] i don't give it my all give it as much
[1:36:30] as i should whenever i whenever maybe
[1:36:31] we're singing or we're worshiping or the
[1:36:33] minister's preaching maybe trying to
[1:36:34] stay in tune with that and
[1:36:36] and it's hard i know what i know it's
[1:36:38] difficult but i think we ought to try
[1:36:40] and go just that extra little step
[1:36:42] as we see the end approaching we ought
[1:36:44] to join ourselves together more as that
[1:36:47] day approaches and
[1:36:49] and if you ask me about my schedule
[1:36:50] right now i don't want anybody to touch
[1:36:52] my schedule
[1:36:53] right yeah we all a little bit that way
[1:36:55] we've got we've got our life planned out
[1:36:57] and we've got all these things that's
[1:36:58] got to happen and
[1:37:00] you know i think if there's anything
[1:37:02] that should trump what's on our schedule
[1:37:03] i think it should be it should be god
[1:37:07] and for him to come back and and
[1:37:10] and give me all that he has
[1:37:13] ought to give him all that i've got
[1:37:16] and you know i begin to look at that and
[1:37:18] begin to think you know he's given me
[1:37:19] everything have i given him everything
[1:37:24] and so when i begin to look at my life
[1:37:25] and it's not that i'm giving him not
[1:37:27] giving him bad things or this but
[1:37:30] maybe even the things that i just can
[1:37:32] consume my time or or that i maybe think
[1:37:34] about or ought not to do or
[1:37:36] or this am i giving him everything
[1:37:39] because he's given me everything
[1:37:41] and i think as as
[1:37:43] as believers i begin to study this and
[1:37:46] listen to brother brain i'm talking
[1:37:47] about making ourselves ready
[1:37:49] i begin to think you know i haven't
[1:37:51] given what god has given i haven't done
[1:37:53] justice to what he's done
[1:37:55] and i'm beginning to think what i should
[1:37:57] be doing to make myself ready and
[1:37:59] you know we've come into this union with
[1:38:01] christ and we we've come to this point
[1:38:04] to where we know that the end is near
[1:38:06] i don't think there's hardly most of the
[1:38:08] nominal christians that i work with are
[1:38:10] like we didn't believe in the rapture a
[1:38:11] few years ago but we're believing in it
[1:38:13] now
[1:38:14] like this can't continue on they they
[1:38:16] know that they see it they feel the the
[1:38:18] pressing end of the age and i don't know
[1:38:19] if it's going to be one day 10 years 100
[1:38:22] years i don't know what it's going to be
[1:38:23] but we know that the end is near
[1:38:25] if you look at the scripture you can see
[1:38:27] everything that is happening now
[1:38:29] and you look at what they're calling for
[1:38:31] in government what everybody's wanting
[1:38:32] to do you can see and feel that the end
[1:38:34] is near
[1:38:36] and so as that day approaches we ought
[1:38:38] to join ourselves together all that much
[1:38:41] the more and so if i could say anything
[1:38:43] tonight
[1:38:44] as i would just play something softly
[1:38:46] you know god has given us all that he
[1:38:48] has we ought to give him all that we
[1:38:50] have
[1:38:51] back
[1:38:52] if god's if god's given me every
[1:38:54] spiritual blessing and
[1:38:56] he's given me me given me all the rights
[1:38:58] to everything that lays in his word and
[1:39:01] he's given me the power to cast out
[1:39:03] demons the power to cast out sickness
[1:39:04] the power to lay hands on the sick and
[1:39:06] they shall recover
[1:39:08] then ought to give him my faith to
[1:39:09] believe that when he says i can do it i
[1:39:12] can do it and it's not by my might or
[1:39:14] not by my power but it's by his spirit
[1:39:16] that i know that what god says i know
[1:39:19] that it'll come to pass because it's a
[1:39:20] truth and it's a foundation
[1:39:22] that i know is true do you love the lord
[1:39:25] this evening maybe if we just bow our
[1:39:27] heads as we would pray
[1:39:30] maybe if you just have a need this
[1:39:31] evening that's on your heart if you just
[1:39:32] want to make it known
[1:39:34] while no one's looking around just make
[1:39:35] it known by the upliftion of your hand
[1:39:40] god we just come before you this evening
[1:39:42] lord i know it's just a little a little
[1:39:43] message and it was chopped up but

[1:39:49] you for giving us all that you have
[1:39:54] lord i pray that i can

[1:40:14] or there's some young people lord i know
[1:40:16] that wanting to be baptized

[1:40:22] that the young people would see
[1:40:24] something
[1:40:25] in us that they would want to live like
[1:40:26] that
[1:40:28] lord that they would see us sincerely
[1:40:30] god i pray you would make me more
[1:40:32] sincere and
[1:40:33] more dedicated
[1:40:36] but i know what the business busyness of
[1:40:38] life lord
[1:40:41] things maybe i've let things creep in
[1:40:43] and things that consume my time but god
