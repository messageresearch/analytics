[18:32] amen let's bow our heads together
[18:34] heavenly father we believe that you have
[18:36] it all in control lord even this service
[18:40] i pray father that you would just do
[18:43] what you do
[18:43] lord in our midst and lord come among us
[18:48] because we've seen you so many times
[18:50] before in a communion service just come
[18:52] down in a
[18:53] special way ask you to do that tonight
[18:56] lord
[18:58] father we're doing what we can do it's
[19:00] not much
[19:02] but it's what we can do to remember the
[19:05] great thing that you did lord
[19:07] we thank you for that help us never to
[19:10] get too big or
[19:12] too educated lord to forget what you did
[19:14] for us
[19:17] lord we thank you we worship you today
[19:20] for
[19:20] who you are and what you've done lord we
[19:23] feel so little
[19:25] unworthy even we've been made worthy by
[19:28] your blood and you chose us so hard to
[19:30] be here and to stand here today
[19:32] we didn't have anything to do with that
[19:34] but we're so grateful that you did it
[19:35] lord
[19:36] thank you for all you do i pray father
[19:39] that healing would even come and
[19:41] all those things that we have need of
[19:43] lord as we obey your word
[19:44] father in this part that we can do we
[19:47] believe father you will
[19:49] continue to open up paths for us to be
[19:51] able to do and
[19:52] and the things that we need to do lord
[19:53] as a church prayer
[19:55] granted tonight and thank you for it in
[19:58] jesus name
[19:59] amen amen god bless you
[20:03] turn with me to psalms chapter 116
[20:07] we'll read verse 12 to start but you'll
[20:09] want to read leave your bible open just
[20:10] for a few moments
[20:12] and we'll just go through these
[20:14] scriptures
[20:17] i won't hold you very long
[20:20] it's so good to be back in the house of
[20:21] the lord
[20:23] amen to know that he's with us
[20:26] that's the thing we don't as brother
[20:28] brown said this morning we don't want to
[20:31] presume that he's with us we want to
[20:32] know and we believe we can know because
[20:35] we come according to the word
[20:36] and do the things that the word requires
[20:38] and god is with us and we believe that
[20:41] today
[20:41] psalms chapter 1 16 and verse 12 what
[20:43] shall i render
[20:45] unto the lord for all his benefits
[20:49] toward me in other words how can i repay
[20:53] god
[20:54] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[20:56] to the word you may be seated
[20:58] this evening
[21:04] what god did for us is so great
[21:08] that there is no way we can give back
[21:11] something of equal worth
[21:14] anything we could touch with our hands
[21:16] would already be so
[21:17] uh messed up that we it just wouldn't be
[21:20] worth what he did
[21:22] we could never repay and so david even
[21:26] looking forward before the cross he says
[21:28] what can i give back to god look what
[21:30] he's given to me
[21:33] what could i ever give back to god that
[21:35] would be close to that
[21:37] have you ever felt like that what shall
[21:39] i render unto the lord for all his
[21:41] benefits
[21:42] toward me what has he done he's gone
[21:46] above and beyond
[21:47] some of you have known people like that
[21:49] maybe in your life maybe a spouse maybe
[21:51] a child maybe a parent
[21:53] they've done things for you that you
[21:54] could never repay
[21:57] and so you try and do something and you
[21:59] just could never pay that back
[22:01] maybe give the ultimate sacrifice and
[22:03] there's just nothing you could do
[22:05] to repay that and so david said what
[22:08] will i do
[22:10] to repay this and and he goes back if
[22:12] you go back in in the chapter in psalms
[22:13] chapter 116
[22:15] he says what has he done he's heard my
[22:18] voice
[22:20] he says i love the lord because he hath
[22:22] heard my voice
[22:24] and my supplications do you believe he's
[22:26] heard your voice today
[22:28] because he hath inclined his ear unto me
[22:31] therefore will i call upon him as long
[22:34] as i live
[22:36] you see he hears you when no one else
[22:38] does
[22:39] he's listening when nobody else is
[22:41] listening
[22:43] i might not hear you you might say
[22:44] something to me and i may not really
[22:46] hear you may not get it but he hears
[22:50] so grateful that he hears and he knows
[22:52] and and when he hears he hears exactly
[22:55] what we need i love the lord because
[22:58] he's heard my voice
[23:00] he's inclined his ear unto me it means
[23:02] that he listens
[23:04] for my voice he listens for me
[23:07] and therefore will i call upon him as
[23:09] long as i live and the second thing he's
[23:11] done for us is in verse 3
[23:13] he saved my soul it says the sorrows of
[23:15] death compassed me
[23:18] the pains of hell get hold upon me he
[23:21] says
[23:21] i found trouble and sorrow i like the
[23:25] way he puts that i found
[23:26] trouble and sorrow that was me the
[23:29] trouble and sorrow that i had in my life
[23:31] i found it
[23:32] i stumbled into it i that's who i was
[23:36] when i found trouble and sorrow verse
[23:38] four then called i upon the name of the
[23:40] lord
[23:41] o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul
[23:46] gracious is the lord and righteous
[23:50] yeah our god is merciful david
[23:51] understood that in a way that few people
[23:53] could
[23:54] he says the lord preserveth the simple
[23:58] i was brought low and he helped me
[24:01] return unto thy rest of my soul for the
[24:04] lord
[24:05] hath dealt bountifully with thee what
[24:07] has he done he saved my
[24:09] soul that's a benefit i can't pay back
[24:12] i can't do anything about that i can't
[24:16] give him anything that would be an equal
[24:17] value
[24:18] to salvation he's changed my walk in
[24:22] verse three he said for thou has
[24:23] delivered my soul
[24:25] from death notice the three things my
[24:26] soul from death
[24:28] my eyes from tears and my feet
[24:31] from falling he's delivering my soul
[24:34] from death
[24:34] we're grateful for that he's also given
[24:37] me joy
[24:39] when i don't have a right to be joyful i
[24:41] put got a smile on my face anyway
[24:43] because
[24:44] he's delivered my soul from death my
[24:45] eyes from tears and my feet
[24:48] that's the third thing from falling help
[24:51] me walk right
[24:53] think of jacob when he met the angel and
[24:55] he touched him he walked differently
[24:56] from then on
[24:57] that's the way i was that's something
[25:00] that god gave me i can't repay him for
[25:02] that
[25:03] he changed my walk he says
[25:07] i will walk before the lord in the land
[25:10] of the living
[25:11] i can walk right because god touched me
[25:14] one of the benefits that he has given me
[25:18] number four in verse 10 he he said he's
[25:21] made me trust him he said i believed
[25:24] therefore have i spoken i was greatly
[25:26] afflicted
[25:27] i said in my haste all men are liars
[25:31] you ever said that in your heart
[25:34] maybe not out loud everybody's a liar
[25:38] all men are liars but god's not
[25:42] it made me trust him amen
[25:46] i can trust him with my fears i can
[25:48] trust him with my
[25:50] with my inner thoughts i can trust him
[25:52] with my sin and the things that i've
[25:54] done that are wrong
[25:55] i can trust him to be merciful i can
[25:57] trust him
[25:58] to keep his word i can trust him to give
[26:00] me i may not be able to trust anybody
[26:02] else
[26:03] but i can trust him amen
[26:06] i can trust him and because i can trust
[26:08] him i can trust the message of the hour
[26:11] i can trust a minister that stands
[26:13] behind the pulpit though he may be
[26:14] fallible
[26:15] and fleshly but yet at the same time god
[26:18] has a message that we can trust
[26:21] we can trust our bibles we can trust
[26:24] them to be the word of god
[26:25] aren't you glad for that today you don't
[26:27] have to reach around say well it doesn't
[26:29] really mean what it says but
[26:30] i can trust him david says i can trust
[26:33] him
[26:34] i know he's not a liar i said in my
[26:36] hates that all men are liars but i know
[26:38] he's not
[26:39] and so i believed what he said amen
[26:43] when i was greatly afflicted i thought
[26:45] that everybody lies
[26:47] but god is not a man that he should lie
[26:49] we can trust him today
[26:51] we can trust him just by simple things
[26:53] he it may not make any sense that well
[26:55] what does taking communion mean but it
[26:57] does something
[26:59] that we're being obedient to god and
[27:02] when we're obedient to god we can trust
[27:04] him
[27:05] he'll keep his word so if you need
[27:08] healing tonight say lord i'm doing what
[27:09] i can do
[27:10] i can't repay you i can't pay you back
[27:13] for all that you
[27:14] there's no way i can equal what you did
[27:15] for me on the cross but i can do my part
[27:18] i'll take the cup
[27:22] and so we look at the things that god
[27:24] has done for us like david we can look
[27:25] back at our life
[27:26] and dave and and like paul did when he
[27:28] said in romans 8 31 what should we then
[27:30] say to these things if god before us
[27:32] who can be against us amen
[27:35] he that spared not his own son but
[27:37] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[27:38] not with him also
[27:40] freely give us all things psalms 116 and
[27:44] 12
[27:46] it's the verse that we read he said what
[27:48] shall i render unto the lord
[27:50] for all his benefits toward me
[27:54] what do i give back to him then he
[27:56] answers his own question
[27:59] he said i will take the cup of salvation
[28:04] it is pleasing in his sight for me to
[28:07] take the cup
[28:09] whatever's in the cup i'll drink it
[28:13] it's a cup of salvation i'll take it
[28:17] i will take as a strange answer to the
[28:19] question what shall i render
[28:22] it seems like an oxymoron but maybe it's
[28:24] the wisest reply that could possibly be
[28:26] given
[28:28] the poet said the best return for one
[28:30] like me
[28:31] so wretched and so poor is from his
[28:34] gifts to draw a plea and ask him still
[28:36] for more sometimes the best thing i can
[28:39] do
[28:40] is say lord i need you you've given me
[28:43] so much but i need you
[28:47] to take the cup of salvation was in
[28:49] itself an act of worship
[28:51] it was accompanied with other forms of
[28:53] adoration so the psalmist says
[28:55] call upon the name of the lord it means
[28:57] that he will utter blessings and
[28:58] thanksgivings and prayers
[29:00] and then drink of the cup which the lord
[29:02] had filled with his saving grace
[29:05] what a cut this is upon the table of
[29:08] infinite love stands the cup full of
[29:09] blessing
[29:10] ours by faith to take it in our hand
[29:12] make it our own partake of it and then
[29:14] with joyful hearts to laud and magnify
[29:17] the gracious one who has filled it for
[29:19] our sakes that we may drink
[29:21] and be refreshed we do this figuratively
[29:24] at the table the communion table
[29:28] we do it spiritually every time we grab
[29:29] ahold of the covenant
[29:32] realizing the fullness of blessing that
[29:34] it contains
[29:35] and by faith receiving the divine
[29:37] contents into our souls
[29:40] let's just pause for a moment tonight
[29:42] and that's what i'd like for us to do
[29:44] tonight in this service just pause for a
[29:45] moment
[29:46] take a long deep drink from the cup that
[29:50] jesus filled for us
[29:52] and then let us worship god
[29:57] in the bible a full cup speaks of
[29:59] abundance either of judgment or a
[30:01] blessing
[30:02] he said that he wouldn't it wouldn't
[30:04] call israel out of egypt until the cup
[30:06] of
[30:06] the iniquity of the amorites was full it
[30:09] was an abundance of judgment
[30:11] that's what's coming to this nation an
[30:14] abundance a full cup speaks of abundance
[30:17] when they would have a feast they would
[30:19] fill the cup to the top
[30:21] so you'd know there was plenty they
[30:22] weren't trying to keep some back
[30:25] fill it to the top that's the way this
[30:28] nation they're waiting for judgment like
[30:30] that
[30:31] but we have a cup during the passover
[30:34] the
[30:34] head of the house would take the cup and
[30:37] and what they do today what the jews do
[30:39] today and it's been passed on by
[30:40] tradition but
[30:42] they will take the cup and fill it four
[30:44] times
[30:45] and they drink from it for each of the
[30:47] promises made to israel in exodus 6
[30:49] 6-7 we won't read it for sake of time
[30:51] but you can go back and look at those
[30:53] promises
[30:55] it's the first cup was called the cup of
[30:58] judgment or sanctification
[31:00] and that's where god said i will bring
[31:01] you out i will separate you
[31:04] and the second cup that they drink is
[31:06] the cup of salvation of deliverance
[31:07] where he says
[31:08] i will save you from bondage and the
[31:11] third cup is the cup of redemption where
[31:13] he says i will redeem you
[31:15] and the third or the fourth cup is the
[31:17] cup of restoration or praise
[31:18] where he says i will take you and i will
[31:21] be your god
[31:24] and so they are fully restored back and
[31:25] so they drink from
[31:27] four cups but in first corinthians 10 16
[31:31] paul speaks of the communion cup
[31:33] and he calls it the cup of blessing
[31:37] and that is also with what they would
[31:39] have known what the jews that were there
[31:40] would have known is
[31:41] the cup of salvation but but they didn't
[31:45] drink from all of the cups just one
[31:48] the cup of blessing and i'm so grateful
[31:53] that i didn't have to drink from the cup
[31:54] that he drank out of
[31:57] because jesus drank the cup of judgment
[32:02] he drank the cup of judgment when he
[32:04] said in matthew 26 39 let this cup pass
[32:07] for me
[32:11] and yet in our cup of salvation is
[32:13] hardship and persecution and even
[32:14] he tells the disciples some of you will
[32:16] drink from the cup that i've drank from
[32:18] meaning that they would be persecuted
[32:20] but their trial as hard as it was
[32:22] was still a cup of blessing because
[32:26] their own though they might die and then
[32:28] they might even be crucified but they
[32:30] could never pay for their own sins
[32:33] every trial that they could go through
[32:34] was still a cup of blessing
[32:36] because that the cup of judgment has
[32:39] already been drank
[32:41] now look in psalms 116
[32:44] again verse 13 he says i will call upon
[32:46] the name of the lord so he says i will
[32:48] take the cup
[32:49] and i will worship god because he took
[32:52] the cup for me aren't you glad that he
[32:55] did
[32:57] you see there's a time to raise your
[32:58] voice as we said this morning it's all
[33:00] about emotion but there is a time
[33:02] when god wants to hear your voice i will
[33:05] take the cup he said he inclined his ear
[33:07] he's listening for me to speak up and
[33:10] worship and he says in verse 14 i will
[33:13] pay my vows unto the lord now
[33:16] in the presence of all his people i
[33:18] can't repay him
[33:20] but i can keep what my promises
[33:24] you know we make god all kinds of
[33:26] promises
[33:28] well i'll go to church more i'll uh
[33:31] i'll try to do the things that i should
[33:34] do
[33:35] i'll not use the language that i used to
[33:38] use i'll not
[33:39] do the things that i used to do and then
[33:40] brother jt seems like we're hard to keep
[33:42] our promises
[33:44] without his help it's impossible
[33:47] but david says i'll pay my vows
[33:50] if i promise god something i'm going to
[33:52] i'm going to go through with it
[33:54] god help us today if i promise god
[33:57] something i'm going to do it
[33:59] i'll pay my vows now in the presence of
[34:00] all these people i promised god i would
[34:02] worship him
[34:03] let me worship you lord i promise god i
[34:06] would praise him let me praise you
[34:07] with all the i'll forget about everybody
[34:10] around me i'll forget about the things
[34:12] going on outside i want to worship you
[34:14] because you're worthy of my praise
[34:17] you're worthy of the worship you're
[34:18] worthy of the adoration
[34:20] that i can give i will take the cup
[34:24] i will pay my vows it says i can't repay
[34:27] him i can keep my promises
[34:30] i remember the promises that i made you
[34:32] remember when you got married you made a
[34:34] promise to your wife you said for better
[34:35] or for worse
[34:37] and sometimes you wake up in the morning
[34:38] and it's better and sometimes you wake
[34:40] up in the morning and it's worse
[34:43] but it's for better for worse
[34:47] sometimes it's a couple blessings
[34:48] sometimes it's a cup of hardship
[34:50] but you get up and you pay your vows you
[34:53] do what you promised you would do
[34:56] and so verse 15 of psalms chapter 116
[34:58] says
[34:59] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[35:01] death of his saints
[35:03] we want to keep our vows don't we all
[35:05] the way to the end
[35:07] verse 16 says o lord truly i am thy
[35:09] servant i am the servant of the son of
[35:11] thine handmaid
[35:12] thou hast loosed my bones i will offer
[35:15] to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving
[35:18] do you have that that you can give to
[35:19] him today
[35:21] you've got you know we we've all got a
[35:23] hand that we can most of us have a hand
[35:24] that we can raise and we've got a voice
[35:26] that we can raise
[35:28] and and we should do that because that's
[35:30] the very least that we could do
[35:32] it's the very least that we could do it
[35:34] here he's done so much for us
[35:37] all we can do is just take the communion
[35:39] and say lord
[35:40] help me to keep my my word
[35:44] i'll take the cup of salvation i'll
[35:46] drink it whatever's in it i'll be a real
[35:48] christian
[35:49] help me to keep my word lord
[35:53] he says oh lord
[35:56] truly i am thy servant i am thy servant
[35:58] the son of thine handmaid
[35:59] thou has loosed my bonds i will offer to
[36:02] thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving will
[36:04] call upon the name of the lord
[36:05] i will pay my vows unto the lord now in
[36:08] the presence of all his people
[36:10] in the courts of the lord's house in the
[36:12] midst of the o jerusalem
[36:14] praise she the lord
[36:17] he says i'll pay my vows i'll keep my
[36:19] promises you remember
[36:20] one of the disciples peter was a little
[36:23] bit of a loudmouth
[36:25] and he made a lot of promises he
[36:26] couldn't keep
[36:30] i feel like peter sometimes i think most
[36:32] of us can identify with that at some
[36:33] point in our lives
[36:35] come out there and said i he said they
[36:38] ain't ever
[36:39] gonna take you jesus said get the behind
[36:41] me satan
[36:45] peter said i'll be with you all the way
[36:47] to the end
[36:49] you're not gonna run me off pastor
[36:52] pastor jesus you're not gonna run me off
[36:54] it don't matter how hard you preach it
[36:55] doesn't matter what happens i'm here
[36:58] next service he's gone
[37:01] because the next service was difficult
[37:04] the next service
[37:07] jesus was crucified or about to be
[37:10] crucified he was being beaten and he'd
[37:12] been taken by the romans and all the
[37:13] hopes and dreams of the disciples seemed
[37:15] to be shattered and
[37:17] and peter denied him before he denied
[37:20] him jesus
[37:21] told him something he said i've prayed
[37:24] for you
[37:29] you look back at the moments of your
[37:30] life you look back at what you were and
[37:32] what you've been through and how many
[37:34] times you made promises to god you
[37:35] couldn't
[37:36] keep but jesus said i prayed for you
[37:40] and when he said that he had not only
[37:42] said he prayed for him but he said but
[37:43] all those who believe
[37:45] through their testimony i'm one of those
[37:50] amen so he prayed for me he prayed for
[37:53] you
[37:54] he said i prayed for you and when you
[37:56] were converted i said the problem peter
[37:58] the reason you can't keep your word the
[38:00] reason you just can't seem to deliver it
[38:01] is
[38:02] you've just not been converted yet but
[38:03] when you are strengthen your brethren
[38:10] well peter must have felt when jesus
[38:13] came back to him
[38:15] he knew he'd not kept his word but jesus
[38:17] never talked to him about it
[38:19] peter had already repented but now jesus
[38:22] come back he said would you feed my
[38:24] sheep
[38:25] do you love me if you love me feed my
[38:27] sheep
[38:28] if you love me feed my lambs
[38:32] if you love me i've got something for
[38:33] you to do if you love me
[38:35] keep your word peter
[38:39] he challenged a man who had fallen a man
[38:41] who had failed
[38:42] to do something even greater oh my
[38:46] peter denied him but jesus never denied
[38:48] peter
[38:50] so grateful for that
[38:53] we get embarrassed though of sometimes
[38:56] of
[38:57] what we believe we shouldn't be brother
[39:00] branham tells the story of a girl went
[39:01] to college and got on the wrong company
[39:03] you all know the story
[39:04] she comes home and she's riding along in
[39:06] the train
[39:07] she got this little girl that she
[39:09] brought home with her and as they're
[39:11] riding along
[39:12] they come to the stop and there's a
[39:14] woman there that scarred all over her
[39:16] face and
[39:16] her neck drawed up and little hands bony
[39:20] watching for her to get off the train
[39:22] and a little girl that was with her said
[39:26] look at that little hag out there on the
[39:29] train track and isn't she awful looking
[39:32] that was this other girl's mother
[39:35] and she sat there and thought well i
[39:36] don't want to make my friend embarrassed
[39:39] i'm embarrassed that that's my mother
[39:41] she looks like that and so
[39:42] she said oh she's very ugly
[39:45] they got off the train and mary
[39:49] the little girl's name was mary and she
[39:51] got off the train and her mother ran up
[39:52] and said oh darling i'm so glad to see
[39:54] you and she turned her back to her
[39:56] she said i don't know you and started to
[39:58] walk away
[39:59] just like peter did there was a
[40:02] conductor standing there he said wait a
[40:04] minute
[40:05] i know how mary's mom got those scars
[40:10] you see when mary was a baby the house
[40:12] caught on fire she was hanging
[40:14] laundry out on the line and and mary was
[40:16] in the in the house
[40:18] a little baby unable to get out and the
[40:20] fireman said you can't go in there and
[40:22] the fire was taken up the house but she
[40:24] covered her face in a wet blanket she
[40:25] run in when she come out she couldn't
[40:28] use the blanket for herself she had to
[40:29] save the baby so she put the blanket
[40:31] around the baby and run out with it
[40:33] and her face was scarred to save mary
[40:38] and she was she she was ashamed to be
[40:41] identified with the very
[40:43] thing that saved her
[40:47] so the reason she's ugly is so you might
[40:49] be pretty
[40:51] you mean you would turn your back on
[40:53] your mother that made such a sacrifice
[40:55] and in shame
[40:56] she bowed her head you see paul says i'm
[40:58] not ashamed of the
[40:59] gospel of christ not ashamed of the fact
[41:02] that he died for me
[41:04] not ashamed of the fact that my sins
[41:06] drove the nails in his hands and his
[41:08] feet i'm not ashamed to take communion
[41:10] i'm not ashamed to stand for him
[41:12] i'm not ashamed because it is the power
[41:15] of god
[41:16] to salvation to everyone that believeth
[41:18] to the jew first
[41:19] and also to the greek i will take the
[41:22] cup
[41:24] because you took the cup for me
[41:28] aren't you glad you have a god like that
[41:31] would you just think about his benefits
[41:33] for just a moment
[41:35] what he's done for you how he saved you
[41:37] how he brought you out
[41:39] and then he brought you to this place
[41:42] where you could just do something it's
[41:43] not much
[41:45] the elements in themselves don't mean
[41:46] anything
[41:48] but it's a symbol of the fact that he
[41:51] gave his blood for you
[41:53] his body was broken for you he said in
[41:56] this due in remembrance of me
[41:59] i can't repay you for what you did lord
[42:02] but i can take the cup
[42:06] we bow our heads together
[42:12] i'm just going to stop there i i feel
[42:15] like it's a good time
[42:17] for the communion service to begin if i
[42:19] could get a piano player an organ player
[42:25] we can begin to play the old rugged
[42:27] cross i
[42:29] let's just have a word of prayer
[42:30] heavenly father
[42:33] we're so grateful to be able to do this
[42:36] today
[42:37] satan has fought us at every turn
[42:40] lord we know you're a god who knows
[42:43] everything
[42:44] before it happens and even satan is a
[42:46] creature of permission he's not able to
[42:49] keep us or to hinder us any more than
[42:51] you allow him to
[42:53] so we thank you for that lord we believe
[42:55] that you've done for us something that
[42:58] we cannot
[42:58] repay but we can take the cup
[43:04] that's the least we can do we can pay
[43:07] our vows we can
[43:08] raise our hand and say man
[43:12] you did so much for me lord
[43:16] i'm not worthy to stand here any more
[43:18] than any of these other folks lord but
[43:21] you took the cup you took the cup of
[43:24] judgment
[43:25] so i could take a cup of blessing so
[43:28] that i could be healed
[43:29] so that i could be saved lord if i'm
[43:32] persecuted if
[43:34] if people are ashamed of the message
[43:36] that i believe if they're ashamed of
[43:39] of the gospel that i hold to
[43:42] may it not bother me lord i'll take the
[43:46] cup i'll pay my vows
[43:48] i'll do the little things that you ask
[43:50] me to do
[43:52] because it's little foxes that spoil the
[43:53] vine
[43:55] i pray lord that you'd help us to have
[43:57] that attitude
[43:59] i'll do that today lord i pray that you
[44:02] just move in our midst lord as we come
[44:04] into this next part of the service and
[44:07] we know that you're here you promised
[44:09] you would be
[44:10] and so we ask you to just come and and
[44:13] fill
[44:14] our hearts as we partake of the
[44:16] communion may you just fill our hearts
[44:18] with love for one another
[44:20] we realize every one of us is a sinner
[44:22] in the flesh
[44:24] but we have a redeemed soul lord
[44:27] may that soul begin to take preeminence
[44:29] in our life
[44:31] begin to be the control tower in our
[44:33] lives we pray
[44:36] lord may we think of one another pray
[44:38] for one another give
[44:40] lord grace to one another i pray that
[44:43] there would be
[44:44] healing take place lord during this
[44:47] service and
[44:48] salvation whatever you have whatever we
[44:50] have need of lord as we obey your word
[44:53] may you do the things that you promised
[44:55] you would do we pray
[44:56] in jesus name amen
[45:00] amen let's sing that saul cherish the
[45:01] old rugged cross that the brothers would
[45:03] come
[45:04] and brother caleb or the caleb that
[45:07] we've asked him to hell
