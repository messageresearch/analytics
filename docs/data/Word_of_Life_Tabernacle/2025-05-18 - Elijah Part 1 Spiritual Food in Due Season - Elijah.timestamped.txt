[36:17] nailed to the
[36:20] cross and I

[41:52] invite the pastor. Amen. Are you ready
[41:54] for the word of the Lord this morning?
[41:56] Amen. And I believe that the Lord will
[41:58] move upon every need in the building if
[42:00] we'll just move ourselves out of the
[42:02] way. Move the tiredness or thoughts of
[42:04] what we're going to do tomorrow or the
[42:06] next day. Amen. I believe the Lord's got
[42:08] something special for us today. Amen.
[42:10] So, let's just sing this with all of our
[42:11] hearts now. Where would I
[42:17] be? You only
[42:23] know. I'm glad you
[42:28] see through eyes of
[42:34] love. I was a hopeless
[42:40] case, an empty place.
[42:47] if not for
[42:52] grace. Oh,
[42:54] amazing. Aren't you thankful for his
[42:56] grace this
[42:58] morning? How sweet the
[43:03] sound I once was
[43:10] lost, but now I'm found.
[43:16] I was a
[43:18] hopeless
[43:21] face, an empty
[43:27] place if not for grace.
[43:32] Oh precious Lord. Oh precious
[43:39] Lord. Oh please
[43:41] take my
[43:45] hand. Oh she lead me
[43:52] on and let me stand.
[43:58] I was a
[44:00] hopeless
[44:03] case, an empty
[44:09] place if not for grace. One more time
[44:14] with all your hearts now. Where would I
[44:16] be? Where would I be? Oh, thank you,
[44:20] Lord. Oh, where would we be this
[44:22] morning?
[44:24] You only
[44:28] know. Oh,
[44:30] I
[44:31] see. Oh, thank you,
[44:34] Lord. True
[44:36] eyes of
[44:38] love. Oh, I'm glad,
[44:41] Lord. A hopeless
[44:46] gave. Oh, I was an empty place.
[44:52] Oh, if not for grace. Could you think
[44:57] about what that means while you sing it
[44:59] this morning?
[45:01] Amazing grace. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[45:04] Where would I be? How sweet the
[45:09] sound. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, I once
[45:13] was long.
[45:16] [Music]
[45:18] Oh, but now I'm
[45:23] found. I was a hopeless
[45:27] cave. Empty
[45:29] place. Oh, an empty
[45:35] place. Oh, if
[45:37] not for
[45:40] grace. Hallelujah. Let's bow our heads
[45:43] together.
[45:45] Heavenly Father, so thankful, Lord, that
[45:49] we've come from an empty place to a full
[45:52] place, a place filled with the goodness
[45:54] of God. Lord, sometimes in our lives, we
[45:57] can't see that goodness like we want to.
[46:00] But Lord, we know you're still good.
[46:02] Even when we're hurting, even when we're
[46:03] tired, even when things aren't going
[46:06] maybe like we think they should, Lord,
[46:08] you're still a good God. You still love
[46:11] us. You You don't change what you think
[46:13] about us, Lord. you. You said, "I know
[46:15] the thoughts that I think towards you."
[46:17] And we are so grateful for that today,
[46:19] Lord. Without your grace, where would we
[46:22] be? What would we be? But we stand here
[46:24] today washed by the blood of the lamb.
[46:26] We're so thankful, Lord. I pray you'd
[46:29] move, Lord, in this service this
[46:31] morning. Lord, move me out of the way. I
[46:35] I know that I can't answer every
[46:37] question. I can't ease every troubled
[46:39] mind. I I can't heal the sick. I can't I
[46:42] can't do those things, Lord. that you
[46:44] can do all of those things and I pray
[46:46] you would do it this morning. May your
[46:48] presence reign supreme among us. Move me
[46:50] out of the way and speak to your people.
[46:52] We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Thank the
[46:57] Lord. Thank the Lord. Amen. We're going
[47:01] to go to First Kings chapter 17 this
[47:03] morning. First Kings chapter 17. While
[47:07] you're turning there, I'd
[47:08] uh like to say uh our my anniversary is
[47:13] coming up. Britney and I's anniversary
[47:15] coming up on uh uh the 20th. That'll be
[47:18] 19 years for us. So, we've got a few
[47:21] years on you, Riley. and Bell. But uh
[47:24] we're uh I feel old all of the sudden,
[47:28] you know, 19 years of marriage and going
[47:30] to be 20 next year and and soon we'll be
[47:33] I'll be 40 this year and and uh but I
[47:36] don't want to wear out. I I want to give
[47:38] the my very best to the people of God.
[47:40] We're going to be gone for a few days,
[47:41] but brother Joel will be around and if
[47:43] you need me, you can still call me.
[47:44] Brother Joel will be around though and
[47:46] uh for the next few days and preaching
[47:48] Wednesday night and she's thankful for
[47:50] good help and for what God has given us.
[47:52] I'm so thankful for that. I I I I'm so
[47:55] blessed when we travel and things. I was
[47:57] talking to a pastor uh yesterday. We
[48:00] were in Oklahoma yesterday at at my
[48:02] aunt's uh memorial service and and I was
[48:04] talking to the pastor there and he was
[48:06] talking to me how hard it was. He had no
[48:08] help and things. I'm so thankful that
[48:10] God has given us help in these things.
[48:12] with Joel mentioned the meetings and the
[48:13] youth banquet coming up. We'll have our
[48:15] fall festival this year. Just looking
[48:17] forward to a good time in the Lord. How
[48:19] many want to hear from the Lord this
[48:20] morning? That's what you came for. Amen.
[48:23] Let's let's turn to the word. First
[48:26] Kings chapter 17 and verse one. And
[48:30] Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the
[48:32] inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab,
[48:36] "As the Lord God of Israel liveth,
[48:39] before whom I stand, there shall not be
[48:42] due nor rain these years, but according
[48:45] to my word." And the word of the Lord
[48:47] came unto him, saying, Get thee hence,
[48:50] and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself
[48:52] by the brook Cherth, that is before
[48:54] Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt
[48:57] drink of the brook, and I have commanded
[48:59] the ravens to feed thee there. So he
[49:03] went and did according unto the word of
[49:06] the Lord. For he went and dwelt by the
[49:09] brook Cherith that is before Jordan. And
[49:11] the ravens brought him bread and flesh
[49:13] in the morning and bread and flesh in
[49:16] the evening and he drank of the brook. I
[49:18] pray the Lord would add his blessings.
[49:20] You may be
[49:21] seated. I want to speak to you this
[49:23] morning on spiritual food in due
[49:25] seasons. We our subject will be to
[49:28] Elijah. We're going to go through some
[49:30] of the life of Elijah and some of the
[49:31] things that he did and uh and and show
[49:35] uh the type for our day. The remarkable
[49:38] thing about Elijah is how little we know
[49:40] about him as a man. He was a tishbite
[49:44] and we don't even know what that means
[49:46] to be a tishbite. We don't know where
[49:49] where that was. And we we know he was
[49:51] from Gilead which is east of the Jordan
[49:53] River but we don't know exactly where.
[49:56] All we know is he was a servant of God.
[49:59] He was a prisoner of love to Jehovah. He
[50:02] spoke I'm getting a ringing uh in and I
[50:05] don't know if it's in my monitors or
[50:06] what, but we know he was a prisoner of
[50:08] love to Jehovah. And his name means my
[50:11] God is Jehovah. How many can say that
[50:14] this morning? My God is Jehovah. The
[50:16] world may be going down and there may be
[50:18] trouble but my God is Jehovah. There may
[50:22] be wars and rumors of wars and there may
[50:24] be trouble at home and trouble at work
[50:27] and trouble all over the place, but my
[50:29] God is still Jehovah. He's still the
[50:32] same yesterday, today, and forever. He
[50:34] doesn't change. The circumstances of
[50:37] life change, but there's something about
[50:39] a man who's sure about what he's talking
[50:42] about. And Elijah was sure about what he
[50:45] was talking about. He said, "I know my
[50:47] God is Jehovah." Yeah. Now, God was
[50:50] going to use men with this same spirit
[50:52] of Elijah five times. We're taught that
[50:55] Elijah in the of course Elijah himself,
[50:58] Elisha, his successor, who he threw his
[51:00] mantel on, uh John the Baptist in uh in
[51:03] in the first coming of Christ. And then
[51:06] we know that Malachi 4 predicts uh the
[51:08] coming of Elijah the prophet before the
[51:10] great and dreadful day of the Lord. And
[51:12] then in Revelation 11, it's spoken of
[51:15] the two prophets and one of them would
[51:16] be one who would stop the heavens that
[51:18] it wouldn't rain, which is obviously a
[51:20] reference to Elijah uh to uh the Jews.
[51:24] And so that he comes five times. Now,
[51:27] each of these men would would have
[51:29] characteristics that were similar. They
[51:31] would love the wilderness. They would
[51:33] condemn Jezebel and her religion. They
[51:35] would warn of oncoming judgment. and
[51:38] they would bring a message that would
[51:40] change the hearts of the people. So each
[51:44] one of these would have those same
[51:46] characteristics. In Malachi 4, it speaks
[51:48] of our Elijah that come in our day.
[51:51] Malachi 4:5 says, "Behold, I will send
[51:54] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[51:57] of the great and dreadful day of the
[51:59] Lord. and he shall turn the heart of the
[52:02] fathers to the children and the heart of
[52:04] the children to their fathers, lest I
[52:06] come and smite the earth with a curse.
[52:08] Now, many modern theologians or some
[52:11] modern theologians will tell you that
[52:13] this speaks of John the Baptist only.
[52:16] But if you go and look, I I I think the
[52:18] majority of commentaries that I have
[52:20] access to actually recognize two
[52:22] different men in Malachi 4. Uh in fact
[52:26] even back to ancient times, one of the
[52:28] earliest church theologians that there
[52:30] ever was was Victorinus. And he spoke of
[52:33] Elijah the prophet who was the precursor
[52:36] of the times of the antichrist for the
[52:38] restoration and establishment of the
[52:40] churches from the great and intolerable
[52:42] persecution. I know the devil many times
[52:44] will tell you, "Well, that's just
[52:46] something Brother Brandon made up." It's
[52:47] not. Students of scripture could see it,
[52:50] but they couldn't see who it was. They
[52:53] couldn't see who it was. Just like what
[52:55] happened with John, they knew, the Jews
[52:57] knew Elijah was coming, but they
[52:59] couldn't recognize him when he came.
[53:01] Right? So, students of scripture again,
[53:03] even in newer commentaries, uh, uh,
[53:06] Jameson Faucet Brown says the the the
[53:08] words before the dreadful day of the
[53:10] Lord show that John cannot be
[53:12] exclusively meant for he came before the
[53:15] day of Christ's coming in grace, not
[53:17] before his coming in terror. And the
[53:19] destruction of Jerusalem was just the
[53:20] earnest of his coming uh, in terror. in
[53:23] the CSB study Bible. Uh it's actually a
[53:26] different translation, but it's a study
[53:28] Bible on that. And it says, "Although
[53:30] this prophecy was provisionally
[53:32] fulfilled by John the Baptist, it will
[53:33] be further fulfilled at Jesus return."
[53:36] Now, they get it mixed up with the with
[53:39] the Elijah of Revelation 11. They say it
[53:42] will be accompanied by a great revival
[53:43] of faith in Israel. Again, uh another uh
[53:47] commentary, a recent commentary says
[53:49] Jesus explained that John the Baptist
[53:51] was the Elijah who prepared the way for
[53:53] his first coming, but made clear that
[53:55] another Elijah was yet future. And this
[53:59] future Elijah would prepare the way for
[54:01] Messiah's second coming before the great
[54:04] and dreadful day of the Lord. So, it
[54:05] wasn't just us looking for it, but we're
[54:07] the ones who recognized it when it came.
[54:10] So and and they're referring there to
[54:12] Matthew chapter 17 uh verse 10 which his
[54:15] disciples asked him this is the
[54:17] disciples coming to Jesus and said why
[54:19] then say the scribes that Elias must
[54:22] first come and Jesus answered and said
[54:25] unto them Elias truly shall first come
[54:28] and restore all things. Someone say all
[54:31] things. It shall restore all things.
[54:34] This message wasn't sent just to make us
[54:37] doctrally correct.
[54:40] I hope you hear me today. This message
[54:42] wasn't sent just to make us good
[54:44] theologians and able to understand the
[54:47] scriptures. This message was sent to
[54:49] restore marriages. This message was sent
[54:51] to restore relationships between parents
[54:54] and children. It was sent to restore
[54:57] back a condition uh uh where a people
[54:59] could believe for healing again. People
[55:01] could believe for salvation again.
[55:03] People could believe for the miracles of
[55:05] God again. That he was present. That's
[55:07] what this message was come for. It was
[55:09] to restore all things that were lost.
[55:12] Everything that was lost to the church,
[55:14] it come to restore those things. He
[55:15] said, "But I say unto you," he said that
[55:17] Elias has come already. So he said,
[55:19] "There there is a Elijah coming that
[55:21] will restore all things." And that we
[55:24] know that wasn't John the Baptist
[55:25] because he didn't do that, right? But he
[55:27] said Elias has come already. That's John
[55:29] the Baptist. And they knew him not. But
[55:31] unto him whatsoever they listed,
[55:32] likewise also shall the son of man
[55:35] suffer them. And then the disciples
[55:36] understood that he spake unto them of
[55:38] John the Baptist. So Jesus said there's
[55:40] an Elijah coming to restore all things.
[55:44] We know the Jews, if you go back in
[55:46] history, they were so expecting the
[55:48] coming of Elijah that they set a place
[55:51] for him at at a wedding. Every time they
[55:54] had a wedding, they had a they had a
[55:56] extra chair, an empty chair and a knife
[55:59] and a fork if they had that those kind
[56:01] of things back then. But they had a
[56:02] place setting for Elijah because that's
[56:05] how much they knew and they believed and
[56:07] were taught that Elijah had to come
[56:09] because of the prophecy of Malachi.
[56:11] Elijah was going to prepare the way of
[56:13] the Lord. But when he came, they missed
[56:15] him. Right? And what's happened in our
[56:17] day is the church was expecting Elijah
[56:20] to come. But when he came when when a
[56:23] man come in the in the spirit and power
[56:25] of Elijah, they missed him. They were
[56:28] expecting him. But they missed him
[56:30] because of how he came. He came as a
[56:32] Kentucky hillbilly and he was just a man
[56:34] and he was just a fallible human being
[56:37] and just like John come out eating
[56:38] locust and and wild honey. And they said
[56:41] that can't be the one who's forerunning
[56:43] the Christ. But he was the one who
[56:45] forerran the Christ. And this Elijah in
[56:47] our day is the one who forerruns the
[56:49] first coming or the second coming of
[56:51] Jesus Christ. Do you believe that this
[56:52] morning? I know we're all mostly
[56:54] believers here this morning. And so I
[56:56] would I would challenge our faith this
[56:58] morning. You say, "Well, I already knew
[56:59] these things." But we need to remember,
[57:01] we need to be reminded of this because
[57:03] again, this message isn't just theology.
[57:06] This message isn't just what what I can
[57:08] learn. This message affects my everyday
[57:10] life. It affects me. Listen, if you
[57:12] don't want to be up and down all the
[57:14] time and in and out all the time and and
[57:16] and constantly uh constantly affected,
[57:19] your your spiritual life affected by the
[57:22] winds of change in the world. If you
[57:24] want to be a stable Christian that's not
[57:26] tossed on the on the seas of life, you
[57:28] need to recognize what God's done in our
[57:30] day. And you need to feed on that word.
[57:33] That's what'll keep you by the brook.
[57:35] That's what'll keep you in a time of
[57:36] famine. That's what'll keep you in an
[57:38] hour when the world's gone crazy. And
[57:40] sometimes it feels like you're going
[57:42] crazy, but yet it'll keep you. You know,
[57:45] God sent Elijah for me. And not just the
[57:47] knowledge of that, but what he had to
[57:49] say is food for my soul. Yeah. It opens
[57:53] up the scriptures to me and it teaches
[57:55] me that there's a life greater than the
[57:58] life of the world.
[58:00] Amen. I I you know, I know people you
[58:04] want to look down on message people say,
[58:05] "Well, message people aren't very good."
[58:07] I know there's a lot of nonsense out
[58:09] there, but I I'll take up for message
[58:11] people this morning. There's no better
[58:13] way to live.
[58:15] There's no better people. There's no
[58:17] more love anywhere that you'll find. You
[58:19] say, "Well, we got problems." There's
[58:20] problems everywhere. That's the human
[58:22] condition. Everybody's got problems, but
[58:24] we got a way out of those problems.
[58:27] Everybody's got uh Everybody gets cross
[58:29] with one another now and then. Yeah.
[58:32] Right. That's not nothing new. People
[58:34] have been doing that since the beginning
[58:35] of time. Since Adam blamed Eve for for
[58:39] giving him the apple, people have been
[58:40] getting fighting with one another and
[58:41] fussing with one another. Everybody does
[58:43] it. Everybody still does it. But I'll
[58:46] say this. We got something that lifts us
[58:47] above those things. We can still
[58:49] fellowship around something all right
[58:51] that cleans up our families that that
[58:53] that causes us to love one another. Just
[58:55] because there's been many failures
[58:57] doesn't mean that there's not a reality
[58:59] somewhere. And we believe we are that
[59:01] reality. We want to live it. We don't
[59:03] want to just talk about it. Well, God
[59:05] sent a prophet. That's good. What did he
[59:07] come to say? What did he come to do?
[59:09] What did he come to restore? Have you
[59:11] been restored?
[59:13] Yes. And if it you have been, it'll make
[59:15] a difference in your life.
[59:17] Now look, they missed him when he come.
[59:20] We don't want to miss him. And they
[59:23] missed
[59:24] Christ because they missed the
[59:26] forerunner of Christ. Cuz if they'd have
[59:29] seen the forerunner come, they would
[59:31] have been there when he introduced them
[59:33] to Jesus Christ. Are you hearing me now?
[59:36] Because they'd already dismissed John's
[59:38] message and said he was a hack. Yeah.
[59:41] Are you saying, "Well, I just won't take
[59:42] the message. I'll just wait on the
[59:44] coming of Christ." Well, if you don't
[59:45] recognize the message and the messenger,
[59:48] you're never going to see the coming of
[59:49] Christ because it was John who
[59:51] introduced him. And only those who were
[59:53] listening to the message of John were
[59:55] able to see. But they didn't stay with
[59:57] John. They moved on with Christ. They
[59:59] come on into the word. But what were
[1:00:01] they doing? They could see God. They
[1:00:02] could see what John said. It was John's
[1:00:04] message that caused them to understand
[1:00:07] who Jesus was. And it's still the
[1:00:09] message of the hour that causes us to
[1:00:11] understand who Jesus is. Yes, that's why
[1:00:15] we need it. And it's not about lifting
[1:00:16] up a man. We are not here because of a
[1:00:19] man. This church isn't about a man. It's
[1:00:21] not about brother Brandham. It's not
[1:00:22] about me. It's not about the deacons.
[1:00:24] It's not even about you. This church is
[1:00:26] about worshiping God, right? It's about
[1:00:28] worshiping God. We don't worship one
[1:00:30] another. We don't worship our potlucks.
[1:00:32] We have potlucks, but we don't worship
[1:00:34] them. We got pews, but we don't worship
[1:00:36] them. We got pianos, but we don't Come
[1:00:38] on, church. We don't worship them. We
[1:00:39] don't worship the music or the song
[1:00:41] leaders. We come together to worship
[1:00:43] God. And he where two or three are come
[1:00:45] together. He said in my name, he said, I
[1:00:47] will be in the midst.
[1:00:55] Huh? Oh
[1:00:57] my. That's why we gather together. We
[1:01:00] believe. We believe that God that this
[1:01:03] message points us to Christ. Amen. He
[1:01:06] said, "Behold the lamb of God who takes
[1:01:09] away the sin of the
[1:01:11] world." So, it's one thing then to
[1:01:16] recognize that brother Brandham's
[1:01:18] ministry fulfills Malachi 4. I think if
[1:01:20] you really study it, any person with a
[1:01:23] just an open heart that's not, you know,
[1:01:26] just saying, "Well, it's just a cold.
[1:01:27] It's just this, that, or the other." And
[1:01:28] you turn away from it. But if you have
[1:01:30] an open heart and mind, I think you'd
[1:01:32] agree that it matches. It fulfills that.
[1:01:35] But it's another thing entirely to have
[1:01:38] your heart turned back to the faith of
[1:01:42] the fathers by the message of Malachi 4.
[1:01:46] It's one thing to recognize Malachi 4.
[1:01:49] It's another thing to have your heart
[1:01:51] turned because we know not all those who
[1:01:54] recognize you have to rec you have to
[1:01:56] you have to hear the messenger to see
[1:01:59] Christ the word, right? But if you don't
[1:02:03] if you can also hear the messenger and
[1:02:05] not see Christ if you're not paying
[1:02:07] attention to what he says and if you
[1:02:09] don't have a revelation of what he's
[1:02:11] saying, you can actually believe that
[1:02:13] God sent a prophet and still miss Christ
[1:02:15] and your heart is not turned back by the
[1:02:18] voice of Elijah. See, the heart is not
[1:02:22] turned by signs and wonders.
[1:02:26] The heart is not even turned by the
[1:02:28] fruits of the spirit. Right? That that's
[1:02:32] not what the heart is turned by. But the
[1:02:34] heart is turned Oh my by the voice of
[1:02:39] Elijah. Amen. That's what the heart is
[1:02:43] turned by. It's the word. It's the word
[1:02:45] of our day. That's right. Oh my. And and
[1:02:49] so the heart, when we talk about having
[1:02:51] our hearts turned back, let's talk about
[1:02:52] that for just a moment. The heart is the
[1:02:55] control tower of the body. It it's the
[1:02:58] seat of willpower. Right? That's where
[1:03:01] your your your will is. And it's the
[1:03:03] seat of willpower. If you tell somebody
[1:03:06] say, "My heart isn't in this."
[1:03:09] I was
[1:03:11] uh He's laughing. Trip's laughing
[1:03:13] because he got me the other day cuz I
[1:03:15] was uh you know kind of looking at this
[1:03:18] trip we've got coming. I take my wife
[1:03:20] every year usually to go fishing. We go
[1:03:22] find a cabin and we That's our idea of
[1:03:24] fun anymore. we're getting old and and
[1:03:26] we find a little cabin and it's got a
[1:03:28] little lake and we fish and we don't
[1:03:30] spend a lot of money. We just eat there
[1:03:31] and fish and we fish and and if it rains
[1:03:34] then we're in trouble. We got nothing to
[1:03:35] do but it's going to rain. So I but I I
[1:03:38] was telling them, you know, just
[1:03:40] because, you know, I feel bad every time
[1:03:42] I'm gone and and I got a little bit of a
[1:03:44] complex about that. You pray for me. I
[1:03:46] just feel like people and I'm glad you
[1:03:47] want me to be here. I I'm so happy about
[1:03:49] that, but I just, you know, I feel bad
[1:03:51] because I'm not here with you all the
[1:03:53] all the time and yet I'm here I know
[1:03:55] more than most, but but I just I want to
[1:03:58] be with you. That's my desire to be with
[1:04:00] you. And so I told in front of my wife,
[1:04:02] I I told Trip, I think I said, "Well,
[1:04:04] you know, my heart's not even in it.
[1:04:06] This is our anniversary
[1:04:08] trip. If my heart's not in it, we got
[1:04:11] problems."
[1:04:15] What I meant was my heart's not even in
[1:04:17] fishing. I got a boat that I've had for
[1:04:20] months and I haven't gotten it out and
[1:04:21] brother Justin Pie was supposed to come
[1:04:22] up this weekend. We were going to take
[1:04:24] it out and I ended up we had the
[1:04:26] memorial service for my aunt which I'm
[1:04:28] glad that I went and and took my mother
[1:04:29] over there. But it's just, you know,
[1:04:32] sometimes you just got things to do and
[1:04:34] and but but when your heart's not in it,
[1:04:36] it means you you don't have the that
[1:04:38] desire,
[1:04:40] right? that willpower to do it. And many
[1:04:43] people could say that about their
[1:04:45] marriage. Your heart's just not in it
[1:04:46] anymore. Yeah. That's a problem.
[1:04:50] It takes more than head. It takes more
[1:04:53] than lying. You know, you'll you'll sign
[1:04:55] Brother Allen's going to sign a piece of
[1:04:57] paper that says that y'all are married.
[1:04:58] But it takes more than that. Yeah. To
[1:05:00] have a life, right? Your heart's got to
[1:05:03] be in it. Yes. If you're going to stay
[1:05:04] married, your heart's got to be in it.
[1:05:07] And it's got to stay in it, right? See,
[1:05:10] you might go through the motions, but
[1:05:12] you want to be somewhere else.
[1:05:14] Oh, come on, church. There's a lot of
[1:05:16] people that come to church, but their
[1:05:17] heart's not in it.
[1:05:20] Because you'd rather be somewhere else,
[1:05:21] and you'd rather be doing something
[1:05:23] else, but if you ever get something on
[1:05:25] fire in your heart for God, and you just
[1:05:27] love him with all your heart when you
[1:05:29] come to the house of God, even though
[1:05:31] you might have gone had a hard week and
[1:05:32] you might have had a struggle through
[1:05:34] the week, but there's something inside
[1:05:35] of you that says, "I'm so glad I come to
[1:05:37] the house of God today." As David said,
[1:05:40] isn't it good that we got invited to the
[1:05:42] house of God? Isn't it good to be in the
[1:05:44] presence of God today? I think all of us
[1:05:46] could say it if our heart is in it. But
[1:05:48] sometimes our heart gets
[1:05:52] fat. That's what the Bible says. Your
[1:05:55] heart, the Bible speaks of a heart
[1:05:57] becoming fat. And in Psalms 119:70, it's
[1:06:00] almost comical, but it says their heart
[1:06:03] is as fat as
[1:06:06] grease.
[1:06:09] Their heart is as fat. Now, he's not
[1:06:12] putting down overweight people. That's
[1:06:14] not what he's saying. Their heart is as
[1:06:17] fat as grease means that their their
[1:06:20] their hearing has become dulled to the
[1:06:22] word. Their their willingness to obey
[1:06:25] the the the message in the word, the
[1:06:27] light that they have is just not in
[1:06:29] their heart's not in it anymore. Their
[1:06:31] hearts become fat. He said, "But I
[1:06:34] delight in thy law." Again in Isaiah
[1:06:37] 6:10, Isaiah prophesied of what would
[1:06:39] happen in Jesus' time. And he said,
[1:06:41] "Make the heart of this people fat and
[1:06:44] make their ears heavy. Shut their eyes
[1:06:46] lest they see with their eyes and hear
[1:06:48] with their ears and understand with
[1:06:50] their heart and convert and be healed."
[1:06:53] Jesus found that condition among the
[1:06:54] Pharisees and the Sadducees. He said,
[1:06:56] "And in them is fulfilled." The prophecy
[1:06:58] of Isaiah, which saith, by hearing you
[1:07:00] shall hear and shall not understand, and
[1:07:02] seeing you shall see and shall not
[1:07:04] perceive. for this people's heart is wax
[1:07:06] gross, which means fat. Right? And what
[1:07:09] that means is it just it it's reached a
[1:07:11] point where it don't pump right anymore.
[1:07:14] It it don't work right anymore. It don't
[1:07:16] circulate. It don't circulate love
[1:07:18] through the body anymore and peace and
[1:07:20] joy and those things. But I'm here to
[1:07:22] tell you, we've got a diet that can Come
[1:07:24] on, church. We got a spiritual diet that
[1:07:26] will cause our heart to come back into
[1:07:28] the condition it ought to be in.
[1:07:31] Amen. This people's heart is waxed gross
[1:07:34] and their ears are dull of hearing.
[1:07:36] Their eyes they have closed lest at any
[1:07:37] time they should see with their eyes and
[1:07:39] hear with their ears understand with
[1:07:40] their heart should be converted and I
[1:07:42] should heal them. See if our heart is
[1:07:45] not turned will be led astray.
[1:07:49] The heart the Bible says is deceitful
[1:07:52] above all things and desperately wicked.
[1:07:56] Who can know it? That's why we don't
[1:07:58] rule our lives by how we feel. All
[1:08:01] right. Yes.
[1:08:03] Right. We don't run our marriages by how
[1:08:05] we feel. We don't run our churches by
[1:08:07] how we feel. I don't always preach by
[1:08:09] how I feel. You don't always listen by
[1:08:11] how you feel. Why is it you you you do
[1:08:14] what you do? Because you know it's the
[1:08:15] right thing to do and because there's
[1:08:17] something in your heart that compels you
[1:08:19] to do it. It's not because of the
[1:08:20] feeling of the flesh. Because the when
[1:08:23] the heart gets fatty, when it gets
[1:08:25] fleshly, right? When it gets carnal, we
[1:08:28] could say it that way. when it gets
[1:08:29] overweighed with worldly things. He said
[1:08:32] in the New Testament, Jesus said, "Be
[1:08:34] careful that your hearts don't become
[1:08:35] overcharged
[1:08:37] with surfing." In other words, that that
[1:08:39] idea, the idea is that someone just ate
[1:08:41] too much or drank too much and is unable
[1:08:43] to move. They get sluggish. I don't want
[1:08:45] to ever get sluggish about the things of
[1:08:47] God. But when I hear the word, I want to
[1:08:49] be able to respond quickly to the word
[1:08:51] because it might be the word that heals
[1:08:53] me. It might be the word that saves me.
[1:08:55] And so, I want to be able to respond to
[1:08:57] that. Yes. Yeah, good. This is the food.
[1:09:02] Oh my. Brother Brandham taught us that
[1:09:03] the opening of the word was for the
[1:09:04] purpose of turning our hearts back. And
[1:09:06] he said, "These divinely revealed
[1:09:08] mystery truths will literally turn our
[1:09:10] hearts back to the faith of the
[1:09:12] fathers." This is the food that keeps
[1:09:14] our hearts on fire for God.
[1:09:17] It's true. I remember some time ago, I
[1:09:18] don't know, Sister Fritz, I'm sure she
[1:09:20] remembers because she remembers more
[1:09:22] than I do, but Sister Fritz, one time, I
[1:09:25] remember the doctor put you on a was it
[1:09:26] a low sodium diet and took the salt off
[1:09:28] your food and she'd had some heart
[1:09:30] trouble and the doctor took the took the
[1:09:33] salt off your her food and I know that
[1:09:35] would just kill Chip and Stephanie if
[1:09:37] the salt got taken off, but I know some
[1:09:39] of the rest of y'all you like your salt
[1:09:40] and she uh my goodness, she sister Fritz
[1:09:44] likes her food seasoned and she was not
[1:09:46] happy about her about her diet, right?
[1:09:50] Taking it off. And I I think she's done
[1:09:51] pretty good actually to reach the age
[1:09:53] she is. I'd say the doctors ought to
[1:09:54] leave her alone, you know, and let her
[1:09:57] do her thing. But I thought that about
[1:09:59] Sister Brown. Sister May Brown was
[1:10:00] almost 100 years old and they she said
[1:10:02] my doctor kept telling me not to drink
[1:10:04] Dr. Pepper, but she drank a Dr. Pepper
[1:10:05] every day. If you ask her where she
[1:10:07] wanted to go eat, she wanted to go eat
[1:10:09] pizza. And and and she ate just about
[1:10:11] the worst food she could, but you know,
[1:10:12] she lived to be a hundred years old. So
[1:10:14] what what can you say?
[1:10:17] But you know, when it comes to our
[1:10:18] hearts, God knows what's best for our
[1:10:21] will, for our for our humanity, for what
[1:10:24] we oh my for for our souls. He knows
[1:10:27] what's best for us. And so, uh, the
[1:10:30] great physician, if you could think
[1:10:32] about it like this, you know, if you
[1:10:33] went to the doctor and he gave you a
[1:10:35] medicine who said, "It's essential that
[1:10:37] you take this to live. This is going to
[1:10:40] make you feel better. This, listen, I
[1:10:42] took some pills. I I'm taking some pills
[1:10:44] now. I don't even know the name of the
[1:10:46] pills. But I took them cuz somebody gave
[1:10:48] them to me. He said it'll help you lose
[1:10:53] weight. I shouldn't even admit that,
[1:10:55] should I? But it's just But it but it's
[1:10:59] but hey, it's kind of working. You know,
[1:11:00] I don't have the appetite. I did. So, I
[1:11:02] thought, well, you know, it may be all
[1:11:03] in my mind. I don't know. But I'm taking
[1:11:05] them. But but somebody gave them to me
[1:11:07] said it'll help me. So, I took it. And
[1:11:10] and if a doctor gave you medicine, said
[1:11:12] it'll help you. You know, they gave me
[1:11:14] blood pressure medicine and I've been
[1:11:15] doing everything I can to get off of the
[1:11:16] blood pressure medicine because uh you
[1:11:19] know, I just got too many pills to take
[1:11:20] and every morning I would not be able to
[1:11:23] survive without my wife. I know that
[1:11:24] because I don't know where the pills
[1:11:29] are. And some of y'all are in that same
[1:11:31] condition. Every morning there's a glass
[1:11:33] of water and a little thing full, it's
[1:11:34] mostly vitamins, but a little thing full
[1:11:36] of of vitamins and and I take those. And
[1:11:39] are you surprised to find out I'm human?
[1:11:40] I guess maybe some of you are, but
[1:11:43] But every morning I do that because I
[1:11:44] want to be healthy, you know, and I take
[1:11:46] those and I'm just I'm just uh but the
[1:11:49] doctor gave me that blood pressure pill
[1:11:50] and and and uh you know it hurts more
[1:11:53] than it helps. I think makes you feel
[1:11:56] terrible. And but the doctor gave it to
[1:11:58] me so I take it cuz they told me I
[1:12:01] didn't want to have a stroke. And I said
[1:12:02] I agree. I don't want to have a
[1:12:03] stroke but but so I take it. Listen to
[1:12:07] me church. If if God told you, Yeah. If
[1:12:10] he told you, "Behold," he said, "I'm
[1:12:11] going to send you a prophet." Yes. He's
[1:12:14] going to turn your heart back. He's
[1:12:16] going to put you on a spiritual diet.
[1:12:18] Yeah. That's going to make you where you
[1:12:20] can serve God like you ought to. It's
[1:12:23] going to make you eligible for a
[1:12:24] rapture. Going to make you ready to go.
[1:12:26] Going to make you in a place where where
[1:12:28] you can uh you can feel the presence of
[1:12:30] God and you can live a good life in the
[1:12:32] world that you're living in. You can
[1:12:33] live according to the word. You can be
[1:12:35] pleasing to God. Yes. And he told you
[1:12:38] that if you take it, would you take it?
[1:12:40] Would you take it? I trust that many of
[1:12:42] us have and do that we would we would
[1:12:44] get on this diet that he put us on. Say,
[1:12:47] "Lord, what would you have for me today?
[1:12:49] What would you have to feed me today?"
[1:12:51] Because the message of the hour is the
[1:12:53] great physician's diet to turn our
[1:12:56] hearts back. Amen. Listen, to eat the
[1:13:00] word, to become the word. It's much more
[1:13:02] than to hear it, but it's to make it
[1:13:04] part of you. And so we don't
[1:13:07] deliberately refuse any part of this
[1:13:09] diet. We come to church and we hear the
[1:13:11] word of God and we check it. You should
[1:13:13] always check what you hear by the word.
[1:13:14] But when you hear the word preached and
[1:13:16] you check it and you find out it's true,
[1:13:18] believe that word. You don't have to
[1:13:20] believe everything I say, but take the
[1:13:22] word. If it's the word, believe the
[1:13:23] word. Yes, sir. And when you believe the
[1:13:25] word, when you take the word, take it
[1:13:27] back to the word and you believe the
[1:13:28] word, what is it? Then you have a
[1:13:30] responsibility to the word to to live
[1:13:33] the word. And you say, "Well, Brother
[1:13:34] Ben, I can't do it." Well, there have
[1:13:36] been lots of people had struggles in the
[1:13:38] Bible. Lots of people today had
[1:13:40] struggles. Even a prophet had struggles.
[1:13:42] He was a human being. But we're living
[1:13:44] in a time when you can be an overcomer.
[1:13:46] Yeah, you're going to struggle sometimes
[1:13:48] because you still live in a body of
[1:13:49] flesh. But just keep eating. Keep on
[1:13:51] working. Keep on doing what you're
[1:13:53] doing. And in the end, it's going to be
[1:13:54] okay. You say, "Well, I struggle with
[1:13:56] depression." Well, it's a good thing you
[1:13:57] haven't given into it yet. Why don't you
[1:13:59] keep keep fighting that thing until one
[1:14:01] day you're free from it? Come on,
[1:14:03] church. Why don't you keep One day
[1:14:04] you're going to wake up and realize that
[1:14:06] things aren't the same as they always
[1:14:08] were. And one day you're going to wake
[1:14:09] up in a new place and you're going to
[1:14:11] say, "I don't even know what happened,
[1:14:12] but I don't feel that anymore." Why?
[1:14:14] You've been feeding on the right kind of
[1:14:16] a diet that was prophesied would turn
[1:14:18] your heart back. Keep on listening to
[1:14:20] those tapes. Keep on hearing the sermon.
[1:14:22] Keep on coming to the house of God. You
[1:14:24] say, "It's not making a difference." You
[1:14:25] didn't first day you went on a diet, you
[1:14:27] didn't feel much of a difference either,
[1:14:29] but over time it made a difference.
[1:14:32] Yes. Amen. Are you hearing me, church?
[1:14:34] Over time, if you just change your
[1:14:36] eating h I'm not talking natural now.
[1:14:38] You can eat however you want to
[1:14:39] naturally. I'm talking spiritually.
[1:14:41] Amen. If you change your eating habits,
[1:14:43] what you feed on. You'd be surprised how
[1:14:45] many of your problems begin to go away.
[1:14:48] Amen. Amen. So, does that mean I lose my
[1:14:50] friends? Well, your friends may not be
[1:14:52] the problem. The biggest problem we have
[1:14:53] is us.
[1:14:57] That's the biggest problem I got. Yeah.
[1:14:59] And when I feed on the word, when I'm
[1:15:01] diligent about the things of God, I find
[1:15:03] that I begin to reach a place that my
[1:15:05] heart is in the place where it ought to
[1:15:07] be.
[1:15:09] Oh
[1:15:10] my church, we need to wake up. Yes. Wake
[1:15:16] up.
[1:15:17] I can.
[1:15:20] But before people leave the church,
[1:15:23] before they I I'll say that differently.
[1:15:25] Before they backslide on God,
[1:15:29] You see it as a minister. It's hard to
[1:15:31] explain that, but but as a minister, you
[1:15:33] see that. You preach those people. You
[1:15:35] become over time, especially as a
[1:15:37] pastor, you preach the same people over
[1:15:38] and over. You can see their heart's not
[1:15:40] in it anymore. That's right. And people
[1:15:43] go through that. Everybody does.
[1:15:46] But if they don't fix it,
[1:15:50] it just keeps getting worse and worse
[1:15:52] and eventually it won't no desire at
[1:15:53] all.
[1:15:55] Yeah. And what I've always feared is not
[1:15:58] that sin would overtake me and I would
[1:15:59] be unable to break free from it because
[1:16:02] I believe in the power of the gospel. I
[1:16:05] believe in forgiveness. I believe in the
[1:16:07] love of God. I believe in election. But
[1:16:10] I've always been afraid that I'd reach a
[1:16:12] place of where I was so dull towards the
[1:16:15] things of God that I just wouldn't want
[1:16:16] to serve him anymore.
[1:16:19] That and I'm so thankful he always
[1:16:21] whenever you get dull, he has a way of
[1:16:23] waking you up. But one of his ways is by
[1:16:26] the word. Oh church, we need to wake up
[1:16:28] this morning. We need to wake up and
[1:16:30] realize we want our families. You say,
[1:16:32] "Well, I want my family to be in church,
[1:16:34] but I just my heart's not in it."
[1:16:35] Listen, if your heart's not in it, one
[1:16:37] of these days they're not going to be in
[1:16:39] church.
[1:16:42] If your heart's not in it, one of these
[1:16:44] days they're not going to be. You say,
[1:16:45] "I want them to I want them to be in the
[1:16:47] choir in the Sunday school. I want them
[1:16:48] If your heart's not in it, one of these
[1:16:50] days they're going to leave. They're
[1:16:51] going to find every excuse in the book
[1:16:53] to leave.
[1:16:55] But if your heart's in it,
[1:16:59] no matter what comes, no matter the the
[1:17:01] preacher behind the pulpit may change,
[1:17:02] the the the situations of life may
[1:17:05] change. You get may get wealthy, you may
[1:17:06] get you may get poor, you may get all
[1:17:09] kinds of things happen. You might gain a
[1:17:10] job, lose a job, but you will not leave
[1:17:12] the word. You will constantly keep
[1:17:14] yourself under the blessing of the word
[1:17:15] if your heart's in it. Very good.
[1:17:20] We need to make sure, and I'm speaking
[1:17:22] to Christians now, I'm speaking to
[1:17:23] myself and my
[1:17:25] family.
[1:17:27] Huh? We need to make sure we don't get
[1:17:29] so
[1:17:31] busy that these things just become
[1:17:33] common to us.
[1:17:36] I'm just preaching from my heart this
[1:17:37] morning. it gets to a place where the
[1:17:39] message is not the main thing anymore
[1:17:42] and it's my idea or my thing or
[1:17:44] something like that and we just focus on
[1:17:46] all our little squables and all our
[1:17:47] little ideas and all our little things
[1:17:49] and we're focused on all these things
[1:17:52] and I know things are important to
[1:17:53] people and I realize that people have
[1:17:55] things that happen. It's important to
[1:17:56] them but what about the message? What
[1:17:59] about the truth? What about the life?
[1:18:01] What about the things that God has sent
[1:18:02] us in our day? Does it still matter? Is
[1:18:04] there still a zeal in your heart for it?
[1:18:06] Amen. I can go to the ends of the earth
[1:18:08] trying to spread this message, but what
[1:18:10] good does it do if our hearts done in
[1:18:12] it?
[1:18:16] You young people always keep your heart
[1:18:18] in it. You'll make mistakes.
[1:18:21] News flash, young people are going to
[1:18:22] make mistakes.
[1:18:24] I'm not excusing them for it. I'm
[1:18:26] stating the fact
[1:18:29] they're going to mess up.
[1:18:31] And we can look down our noses at them
[1:18:32] and pick them apart if we want to. or we
[1:18:34] can give them a help in the hand and
[1:18:36] help them up.
[1:18:38] Correct them when they're wrong and pull
[1:18:39] them on up with us. Young people are
[1:18:42] going to make mistakes. People are going
[1:18:44] to do things that that that aren't
[1:18:45] right. And you're going to make mistakes
[1:18:47] in your life if you live very long. And
[1:18:49] I think all our elders could say amen to
[1:18:50] that. We're going to we're going to make
[1:18:52] mistakes. But you got to have your heart
[1:18:54] in it. If your heart's in it, you you'll
[1:18:56] get you'll overcome that mistake. You're
[1:18:58] going to make it. But your heart's got
[1:19:00] to be in it. It's got to be more than a
[1:19:02] head. Listen. And you can't walk around
[1:19:04] getting offended all the time at
[1:19:05] everything everybody says. Your heart's
[1:19:07] in it
[1:19:11] when your heart's in it. Listen, if your
[1:19:13] heart's not in the house of God,
[1:19:15] everything that happens will offend you.
[1:19:20] Everything will. As we preached long
[1:19:22] ago, when you're in the desert, when the
[1:19:23] desert got dry, they started murmuring,
[1:19:25] complaining. Re said, "Those leaves roll
[1:19:27] up and become stickers." Well, we don't
[1:19:29] want to do that. I I don't know that
[1:19:30] anybody's doing that. I'm not preaching
[1:19:31] at this. I'm preaching that myself. I
[1:19:33] don't want to get dry. I don't want
[1:19:35] vacation to become an excuse for
[1:19:37] backsliding. I don't want the world to
[1:19:39] become an excuse for backsliding. I
[1:19:41] don't want pressures of life to become
[1:19:42] an excuse. But Lord, I'm going to keep
[1:19:44] my heart on fire for you no matter what
[1:19:46] happens.
[1:19:49] Not to minimize what we go through
[1:19:51] because we go through very real trials,
[1:19:54] but if our heart's in it, if our heart's
[1:19:57] in the word, it'll be okay. That's
[1:20:00] right. I know. I'll say this about
[1:20:04] preachers because there's not very many
[1:20:05] preachers here this morning. So, just me
[1:20:08] and Joel and and uh Brother Stewart's
[1:20:12] going on vacation. But, you know, I'll
[1:20:14] say this about preachers. If your heart
[1:20:17] is in it, a young preacher may not be
[1:20:19] able to preach. I mean, that's just, you
[1:20:21] know, some people just can't put two
[1:20:23] words together. I was one of those
[1:20:25] people.
[1:20:28] I couldn't stand up here. I had when I
[1:20:30] first started preaching, I could study.
[1:20:32] The Lord God always gave me an appetite
[1:20:34] for study. I could study the word, but I
[1:20:36] stand up here and
[1:20:38] shake. I couldn't look at people
[1:20:41] directly. Now, it helps cuz my eyes have
[1:20:44] gotten kind of bad and I it's just kind
[1:20:45] of a blur. That's so helpful. You
[1:20:49] know, I can look right at you and not
[1:20:51] see if you're laughing or smiling.
[1:20:52] Praise God. Or frowning.
[1:20:55] those in the back. Anyway, I can see
[1:20:57] these up here. But you
[1:21:00] know, but you know, a young person, what
[1:21:02] what what dictates a young man's success
[1:21:05] in the ministry? And I mean success by
[1:21:07] his help to the people of God, how much
[1:21:09] you can help the people of God? It's his
[1:21:11] is his heart in it,
[1:21:14] right? Whether how do you know whether a
[1:21:16] deacon is going to be a good deacon?
[1:21:18] Deacons make mistakes when they're
[1:21:19] young. We don't have deacon school,
[1:21:23] right?
[1:21:24] You just wake up one day and somebody
[1:21:26] nominated you to be a
[1:21:27] deacon and then you accepted the
[1:21:29] position and and and and you're sitting
[1:21:32] there and and we don't they'll make
[1:21:34] mistakes, but is their heart in it? If
[1:21:37] their heart's in it, they'll be all
[1:21:38] right. If their heart's not in it, they
[1:21:40] won't be no matter how good they are at
[1:21:43] it or no matter how many natural gifts
[1:21:45] they have. But if the heart's not in it,
[1:21:47] because there's going to be moments in
[1:21:49] ministry where you feel like giving up.
[1:21:51] Yeah.
[1:21:52] every Monday,
[1:21:54] most Thursdays,
[1:21:57] you're going to feel like giving up and
[1:21:58] giving in. But you get to the point
[1:22:00] where if your heart's in it and you wake
[1:22:02] up on Sunday morning and you sit there
[1:22:04] say, "Oh, I just can't wait to get to
[1:22:05] the house of God and preach my 10,000
[1:22:08] sermon to the people of God. But why do
[1:22:10] you keep doing it? Why do you keep
[1:22:11] studying? Why do what shuts my door and
[1:22:13] keeps me in here for hour after hour
[1:22:15] sometimes studying the word of God? What
[1:22:17] does that I'm not bragging on myself,
[1:22:19] but my heart's in it. Yeah. Pray God
[1:22:21] would keep my heart in it. If my heart
[1:22:23] ever not in it, I don't want to do it
[1:22:24] anymore.
[1:22:28] Let your heart be in it. I know some men
[1:22:29] aren't aren't fiery. Some men are
[1:22:31] softspoken, and that's fine. We should
[1:22:33] accept all kinds of ministry. You You
[1:22:35] don't have to be fiery. Same thing with
[1:22:36] people in the pews. You don't have to
[1:22:38] jump and shout and run, but if your
[1:22:39] heart's in it, something's going to
[1:22:41] happen. You're going to have some
[1:22:42] response to the per to the ministry of
[1:22:44] God. Yes. Yeah. If your heart's If your
[1:22:47] heart's in it, you can go through every
[1:22:49] every accusation, every critic, every I
[1:22:51] don't know why I've gotten off on this
[1:22:53] this morning, but if your heart's in it,
[1:22:54] you're going to go through those things.
[1:22:56] If your heart's not in it, you can't
[1:22:57] take it. Yes.
[1:23:01] Very good.
[1:23:03] Is your heart been turned back? Is your
[1:23:05] heart in the message? Is your heart in
[1:23:07] the word? Is your heart in the rapture
[1:23:08] and the coming of Christ? That's my
[1:23:11] question this morning for you and for
[1:23:12] me.
[1:23:17] Judas made a financial
[1:23:19] decision. He was a gifted man, a
[1:23:21] preacher, but his heart wasn't in it.
[1:23:26] Made a financial decision. I'll make
[1:23:27] some money and if he's God, he'll get
[1:23:29] out of it anyway. The message will be
[1:23:31] fine without
[1:23:32] me. Huh? If it's true, it's going to
[1:23:36] happen anyway. If I'm elected, I'm going
[1:23:37] to do it anyway. Judas made a financial
[1:23:39] decision.
[1:23:41] Don't make lifealtering decisions based
[1:23:43] solely on money. You regret it in the
[1:23:46] end.
[1:23:49] Look at look at our prophet in this day.
[1:23:51] What did he do? He come like John I know
[1:23:53] that's sobering but it's
[1:23:55] true. John the Baptist come and cried
[1:23:57] out
[1:23:58] repent. Repent. That's what a prophet
[1:24:01] come in our day doing. Look at Luke 3
[1:24:03] chapter
[1:24:04] 3. And we're just introducing Elijah to
[1:24:06] you and the concept of Elijah this
[1:24:08] morning. So we'll get a little bit
[1:24:10] further maybe into it tonight. But in
[1:24:12] Luke 3 and:3, he came into all the
[1:24:15] country about Jordan. This is John the
[1:24:16] Baptist preaching the baptism of
[1:24:18] repentance for the remission of sins. As
[1:24:21] it is written in the book of the words
[1:24:22] of Isaiah the prophet, saying, "The
[1:24:23] voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[1:24:25] prepare you the way of the Lord. Make
[1:24:26] his path straight. Every valley shall be
[1:24:28] filled and every mountain and hill
[1:24:30] should be brought low. The crooked shall
[1:24:31] be made straight and the rough way
[1:24:32] should be made smooth and all flesh
[1:24:34] shall see the salvation of God." And the
[1:24:36] Jews were all looking at that prophecy
[1:24:37] and saying, "Praise God, a great Billy
[1:24:40] Graham style ministry is coming and
[1:24:41] we're going to have everything's going
[1:24:43] to change and and there's going to be a
[1:24:44] great worldwide revival and the Romans
[1:24:46] are going to be kicked out and the
[1:24:48] mountains are going to be made low and
[1:24:49] we're not even going to have to walk in
[1:24:51] rough places anymore." Yeah. Right. But
[1:24:54] they didn't understand spiritual things.
[1:24:57] And so John the Baptist came and and and
[1:24:59] he said to the multitude that came forth
[1:25:01] to be baptized at him, "Oh generation of
[1:25:06] vipers, I want to warn you, if you get
[1:25:08] to feeding on the message, you'll find
[1:25:09] out our prophet spoke like that,"
[1:25:12] right? Oh, generation of
[1:25:15] vipers. Oh my. Whoath warned you to flee
[1:25:18] from the wrath to come? They come to
[1:25:19] church that morning, he called them a
[1:25:20] bunch of snakes.
[1:25:24] Thank God he wasn't speaking to the
[1:25:26] elect. Right.
[1:25:29] Again, he said, "Bring forth therefore
[1:25:31] fruits worthy of repentance. Begin not
[1:25:34] to say within yourselves, we have
[1:25:35] Abraham to our father. I say unto you,
[1:25:37] God is able of these stones to raise up
[1:25:39] children unto Abraham." You know how
[1:25:41] offensive that was to them men who had
[1:25:43] such great pride in keeping their
[1:25:45] pedigree back to Abraham, their family
[1:25:48] tree. He said, "Now also the axe is laid
[1:25:51] to the root of the trees. every tree
[1:25:52] therefore which bringeth not forth good
[1:25:54] fruit is heuned down and cast into the
[1:25:56] fire. And the people ask him saying,
[1:25:57] "What shall we do then?" He answered and
[1:25:59] said to them, "Now look, they're saying,
[1:26:01] "What should we do? Open the word to us,
[1:26:04] John. We want to hear the opening of the
[1:26:06] word." And they sit down ready to write
[1:26:07] down the great mysteries that John is
[1:26:10] about to give them. Let's hear what John
[1:26:12] had to preach. He said, "He that hath
[1:26:14] two coats, let him impart to him that
[1:26:17] hath done."
[1:26:20] That's pretty simple stuff. He that hath
[1:26:22] meat, let him do
[1:26:24] likewise. Then came also publicans to be
[1:26:27] baptized. Said unto him, Master, what
[1:26:29] shall we do? He said unto them, exact no
[1:26:32] more than that which is appointed you.
[1:26:36] What is this basic living? Yeah, it's
[1:26:39] just life. But Elijah come to tell us
[1:26:42] about it. Why? Because he come to turn
[1:26:44] our hearts back.
[1:26:46] Oh my. The soldiers likewise demanded of
[1:26:49] him, saying, "What shall we do?" He said
[1:26:51] unto them, "Do violence to no man,
[1:26:53] neither accuse any falsely, and be
[1:26:55] content with your wages." Oh, that's
[1:26:58] tough, isn't
[1:27:00] it? Because the soldiers were
[1:27:02] constantly, you realize that the
[1:27:03] soldiers run the empire, and they were
[1:27:06] constantly agitating for higher wages,
[1:27:08] constantly marching on Rome to get more
[1:27:11] better wages. And and and a prophet
[1:27:14] comes to him and says, "Be content with
[1:27:15] what you have.
[1:27:17] Godliness with contentment is great
[1:27:19] gain. If we could ever learn to live on
[1:27:21] what we make, Lord, how things would
[1:27:22] change. I'm preaching to myself, too.
[1:27:26] I'm preaching to my children who just
[1:27:28] get starting out in life, you know, and
[1:27:29] Peter's got a job and trying to work and
[1:27:31] things and you got to learn how to how
[1:27:33] to work. You got to learn a work ethic
[1:27:34] and things like that. And and and but
[1:27:37] but be content with your wages. Don't
[1:27:39] don't constantly do that. But don't
[1:27:41] constantly just look for more money, but
[1:27:43] learn how to make it with what you're
[1:27:44] making,
[1:27:46] right? H how does this prepare the way
[1:27:49] for the Lord? You say, "Well, that
[1:27:50] doesn't make a difference." It does. The
[1:27:53] hearts were being turned back. John was
[1:27:55] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:27:57] children. Yeah. Right. The hearts of the
[1:28:00] Jewish fathers to the children. And this
[1:28:02] hour a prophet came with the same kind
[1:28:04] of message to turn the hearts of the
[1:28:05] children that's us to the fathers to the
[1:28:09] Pentecostal fathers. See and when he
[1:28:12] come he spoke with authority. When Jesus
[1:28:14] come it said he spoke with authority not
[1:28:16] like the scribes but in first kings 17:1
[1:28:18] it said as the Lord God of Israel liveth
[1:28:20] before whom I stand there shall not be
[1:28:22] due nor rain these years listen but
[1:28:24] according to my word.
[1:28:29] Elijah didn't say, "The Lord told
[1:28:31] me." He didn't say, "Thus sayaith the
[1:28:34] Lord." But he said, "As the Lord
[1:28:36] liveth,"
[1:28:38] there won't be due. Well, you talk about
[1:28:40] a man who was sure where he stood.
[1:28:43] Oh, that we could be that sure about
[1:28:44] what we believe.
[1:28:47] There shall not be due nor rain, but
[1:28:49] according to my word. Can you imagine?
[1:28:52] Brother Brandon illustrated it many
[1:28:53] times. Bald-headed. I'm happy the
[1:28:55] prophets were bald-headed. Praise God.
[1:29:00] bald-headed, white whiskered. We
[1:29:02] actually know some of the prophets were
[1:29:03] young, so this probably only fits a few
[1:29:05] of them. But we know we know Moses was
[1:29:07] old and Elijah was bald-headed and white
[1:29:09] whiskered because brother Brandon said
[1:29:11] he walks down. He just appears in in
[1:29:14] Ahab's
[1:29:18] palace. He Can you imagine what this
[1:29:21] must have been like? Ahab sitting there,
[1:29:22] things are going good. The economy is
[1:29:25] good. Everything's everything. Boy, he's
[1:29:27] he's up there making deals, you know,
[1:29:29] wheeling and dealing and and making
[1:29:31] things happen. And and he married
[1:29:33] Jezebel, the most beautiful woman in the
[1:29:35] country. And he thought everything was
[1:29:37] going just right. And he had everything
[1:29:38] at his feet. And the economy was good.
[1:29:41] Was one of the greatest, Do you realize
[1:29:43] one of the greatest economies ever in
[1:29:45] Israel? One of the easiest times to be
[1:29:46] an Israelite was during Ahab's reign
[1:29:49] before the famine.
[1:29:51] But after the famine, one of the worst
[1:29:53] times to ever be an
[1:29:56] Israelite. But he come up there. Elijah
[1:29:58] walks in the palace and Ahab looks up
[1:30:00] here and here's this man, rough looking
[1:30:02] man, dirty from walking, dust all over
[1:30:04] him. He walks up there and he points his
[1:30:06] finger in the face of Ahab. And he said,
[1:30:08] he said, "Now listen." He said, "There
[1:30:11] won't even be due fall
[1:30:14] till I call for it." Yeah.
[1:30:17] And Ahab said, 'What in the world are
[1:30:20] you doing? Number one, who are you?
[1:30:23] Well, welcome to Eli, the ministry of
[1:30:25] Elijah.
[1:30:28] Brother Brandham said, God give us men
[1:30:30] like that. Men who know what they're
[1:30:32] doing with thus sayeth the Lord. Listen,
[1:30:34] if you got the word of the Lord, you can
[1:30:36] speak it as if it was God himself
[1:30:38] speaking.
[1:30:40] Right?
[1:30:41] You said, now we find out that before he
[1:30:43] did that, listen, church, that's more
[1:30:44] powerful than you know that it is. If if
[1:30:46] you got the word of the Lord, thus
[1:30:48] sayeth the Lord God, I'm the God that
[1:30:50] heals all your thy diseases, you can
[1:30:52] take that word and speak it. If you
[1:30:54] really believe it, you can speak it over
[1:30:56] your household as if it was God speaking
[1:30:58] it. Yeah.
[1:31:00] Why? It's the word of the Lord.
[1:31:03] Now
[1:31:04] listen, listen. He He said that know
[1:31:06] what they're doing. We find out before
[1:31:08] he did this that God had called him. God
[1:31:09] had talked to him. Therefore, he wasn't
[1:31:11] afraid of anything. He wasn't afraid of
[1:31:13] his message. It wouldn't happen. He knew
[1:31:15] it would happen. He knew it was
[1:31:16] according to the word of the Lord. And
[1:31:18] he knew he was God's prophet for the
[1:31:20] hour. Therefore, when the king would
[1:31:21] whether the king would cut his head off,
[1:31:23] throw him in jail, whatever they do, it
[1:31:25] made no difference to him. He had a
[1:31:26] commission. Thus sayeth the Lord, right
[1:31:28] in the face of the king. He said Elijah
[1:31:31] spoke as if he was God himself. The de
[1:31:33] will not fall from heaven until I call
[1:31:35] for it. He said the prophet had been so
[1:31:37] long in the presence of God. The
[1:31:38] prophets of the Old Testament or any
[1:31:40] time when they live in the presence of
[1:31:42] God until they become the word, their
[1:31:43] message is the word.
[1:31:44] itself. He said, and remember he said,
[1:31:46] "Thus sayith the Lord." When those men
[1:31:48] had those messages from God, they become
[1:31:51] so wrapped up that their own thinking,
[1:31:53] listen, he said it might have been
[1:31:54] against their thinking. They might not
[1:31:57] have been able to see it right, but they
[1:32:00] were speaking the word of God. Thus
[1:32:02] sayeth the Lord, there will not be any
[1:32:05] rain till I call for it. Oh, what a
[1:32:07] statement. He said he'd been in the
[1:32:08] presence of God and been vindicated so
[1:32:10] perfect. He referenced Amos 3:7. I'm
[1:32:13] going to skip through some of this,
[1:32:14] sister Joanna. And I apologize. I'm
[1:32:16] running out of time. But he said they
[1:32:18] laughed at him and they thought he was
[1:32:19] crazy, that fanatic. But see, he had
[1:32:21] thus sayeth the Lord that it wasn't
[1:32:23] going to rain. And God before he did
[1:32:24] that, he revealed it to Elijah his
[1:32:26] servant. And he was a vindicated, proven
[1:32:28] prophet. So the people ought to have
[1:32:30] repented. But understood that, they
[1:32:32] laughed at him and said, "Oh, we got
[1:32:33] plenty of rain. The reservoirs are full.
[1:32:35] The rivers are running good." Bible said
[1:32:36] there wasn't even due for three years
[1:32:38] and six months.
[1:32:40] You imagine how dry it got.
[1:32:43] The brooks and the waters dried up. Oh
[1:32:46] my. Brother said that wasn't that man.
[1:32:49] That was God speaking through that man.
[1:32:52] That was the eye. It was Yes. Do you
[1:32:55] follow that? That was the eye. So when
[1:32:57] he said there won't be due fall till I
[1:32:59] call for it. That wasn't Elijah
[1:33:00] speaking. It was God speaking. Yeah.
[1:33:03] Right.
[1:33:06] See when a man comes sent from God
[1:33:07] ordained of God with thus sayith the
[1:33:08] Lord the messenger and messenger are one
[1:33:09] and the same. I don't want us to get
[1:33:11] hung up on this because I know people
[1:33:13] have preached this and said, "Well, that
[1:33:15] basically makes Brother Brandham God."
[1:33:16] But I want you to think about this. If
[1:33:18] you preach the word of God, speak the
[1:33:19] word of God, live the word of God, you
[1:33:21] and your message are the same. That's
[1:33:23] right. That's what a prophet taught us.
[1:33:25] It has to be. You You don't want a
[1:33:27] separation between the message and the
[1:33:29] messenger. Yeah. Right. If there is, it
[1:33:32] makes the message wrong 100% of the
[1:33:34] time. If if you don't live it, you can't
[1:33:37] preach it. That's right.
[1:33:39] Your preaching will be tainted by your
[1:33:41] life. It's absolutely the truth. Look,
[1:33:45] he's sent to represent thus sayith the
[1:33:46] Lord word by word. So he and his message
[1:33:47] is the same. A denominational man under
[1:33:49] denominational opaces, he and the church
[1:33:51] is the one. A theologian under theology
[1:33:54] made by some denomination. He and his
[1:33:56] message are one. Then when a man comes
[1:33:58] with thus sayith the Lord, he and the
[1:34:00] message is one. And when Elijah came
[1:34:02] with thus sayith the Lord, he and his
[1:34:03] message become one. So, how could you
[1:34:05] say, "Well, the message teaches this,
[1:34:06] but I believe this." Why? Because when I
[1:34:09] when it's right, me and the message are
[1:34:11] one.
[1:34:14] Well, the message says I can be healed.
[1:34:15] The Bible says I can be healed. That's
[1:34:17] what the message is. The light on the
[1:34:18] Bible. The Bible says I can be healed.
[1:34:21] But, but I don't really believe it. Then
[1:34:22] you're not one with your message. But
[1:34:25] when you become one with your message,
[1:34:26] you can walk up and say, "I know I'm
[1:34:28] already healed by the stripes that were
[1:34:30] paid on Calvary. The blood that was shed
[1:34:32] on Calvary. I know that I'm saved. I
[1:34:34] know I've been filled with the Holy
[1:34:36] Ghost. You can come and claim those
[1:34:37] things because you have a message to
[1:34:38] back it up. I know I'm going in a
[1:34:40] rapture. I know I'm going to make it.
[1:34:42] Why? Me and my message have become one.
[1:34:44] Yes. Very good.
[1:34:48] Just as Jesus when he come, he was the
[1:34:49] word. St. John 1. So, the word of God
[1:34:51] and the messenger of the age was the
[1:34:53] cell. Same thing all the time. He said,
[1:34:55] "Now, do you see where I'm trying to get
[1:34:56] to? I spoke with you pretty plain this
[1:34:59] morning. That was when he spoke uh when
[1:35:01] he spoke anointed or uh trying to do God
[1:35:03] a service without it being his will. He
[1:35:05] said, "Don't you see the authority of
[1:35:07] the living God and the living church,
[1:35:08] the bride, the sick are healed, the dead
[1:35:11] are raised up, the cripples walk, the
[1:35:13] blind see, the gospel goes forth in its
[1:35:15] power? For the message and the message
[1:35:16] are the same. The word is in the church
[1:35:18] in the person." If you want to see
[1:35:20] things happen, if you want to see
[1:35:21] miracles in your life, if you want to
[1:35:22] see God really move, how many want to
[1:35:24] see that? How many need God to move for
[1:35:26] you? If you need God to move in your
[1:35:28] situation, you and your message need to
[1:35:30] become one. Yes. You need to become one
[1:35:33] with the message. Say, "Lord, I
[1:35:34] surrender to it. If I find out about
[1:35:36] something I'm doing that's not right,
[1:35:38] I'm going to walk in the light of the
[1:35:39] message. I'm going to walk in it." Why?
[1:35:42] Because me and my message are one. If I
[1:35:44] want to be one with healing, if I want
[1:35:46] to be one with salvation, with the
[1:35:48] rapture, I got to be one with the rest
[1:35:49] of it as well. Identified with
[1:35:53] it. Amen.
[1:35:56] He said the word is in the church in the
[1:35:59] person. Hallelujah. The word of God was
[1:36:02] in Elijah when he walked up there with
[1:36:03] us. Say the Lord and said it isn't going
[1:36:04] to rain. That wasn't Elijah. That was
[1:36:06] God in Elijah.
[1:36:09] Now, I'm going to address something and
[1:36:10] we'll close because I don't have very
[1:36:12] much longer. But
[1:36:14] Elias, the Bible teaches Elias was a man
[1:36:17] subject to like passions as we are. And
[1:36:20] he prayed earnestly that it may not
[1:36:21] rain. So now can you imagine all all
[1:36:25] Ahab knows he walks up there and says
[1:36:26] it's not going to rain but the Bible
[1:36:28] said he prayed earnestly
[1:36:30] right so it's not an arrogance
[1:36:34] but Elijah prayed
[1:36:37] and it rained not on the earth but the
[1:36:38] space of three years and six months he
[1:36:39] sought the word of the Lord and the word
[1:36:41] of the Lord came to him but he was a man
[1:36:44] he was a man with failures faults
[1:36:45] mistakes now I want to ask you and we've
[1:36:48] defined the message before the absolute
[1:36:50] the absolute is what God said, "Yeah,
[1:36:53] right. The message is what God says."
[1:36:56] Yeah. It's the light on the word for
[1:36:58] this hour. The message is absolute
[1:36:59] because it's all true. Yeah. Right. But
[1:37:02] how much you you could say it like this
[1:37:04] now when we talk about the message
[1:37:05] sometimes we talk about 1100 and
[1:37:07] something many there are now books and
[1:37:10] tapes, right? Or tapes anyway that we
[1:37:12] have recorded sermons. Brother Brandon,
[1:37:15] we don't have tapes anymore, do we?
[1:37:17] Recorded sermons. So what you say that's
[1:37:19] the message and and it is right that's
[1:37:23] that's the message is what brother had
[1:37:25] to say but there's a message within the
[1:37:27] message
[1:37:29] right there's something God is trying to
[1:37:31] get across to you through the message
[1:37:33] but now look what parts of this message
[1:37:36] are on the spiritual
[1:37:38] diet you realize some things you eat
[1:37:40] don't stay in your
[1:37:41] body but it still benefits you
[1:37:45] some does and some doesn't but you eat
[1:37:47] it
[1:37:49] You eat it
[1:37:50] all. I hope you're hearing me this
[1:37:52] morning. God sent it so we could eat it
[1:37:55] all. How much are on the spiritual diet?
[1:37:57] All of it. Yeah. All of it. That's why
[1:38:00] we don't limit it. What's that say?
[1:38:01] After 63, after this. We know there was
[1:38:03] a preparation time. We know brother
[1:38:04] Random made mistakes. We know he said,
[1:38:05] "But God corrected those things." Right.
[1:38:08] So, how much is on the spiritual diet?
[1:38:11] All of it. Yes. Yes. See, because he was
[1:38:14] a man with failures, faults, mistakes,
[1:38:17] just like I am. You know, you're going
[1:38:20] to get really disappointed if you
[1:38:21] elevate me to God.
[1:38:24] And some of y'all have come and I I
[1:38:26] appreciate your respect. You show me
[1:38:27] great respect and honor and you tell me
[1:38:30] uh you know how much I mean to you and I
[1:38:32] appreciate that. But don't make me God.
[1:38:36] And I mean that. I know you would never
[1:38:37] fall down and worship me, but don't
[1:38:39] don't think that I can't fail or that I
[1:38:42] couldn't be wrong. That scares me
[1:38:44] because you'll put your confidence in a
[1:38:46] man and that that man will be wrong and
[1:38:47] you'll leave. That man will offend you
[1:38:50] or something will happen and you'll
[1:38:50] leave. I don't mean leave the church. I
[1:38:52] mean leave altogether. Quit on God.
[1:38:55] Backside. Don't do that. Listen, you you
[1:38:58] you remember that men are men. God's
[1:39:01] God. But sometimes God speaks.
[1:39:04] Yeah. And when I speak the message of
[1:39:06] the hour, that's God speaking,
[1:39:09] right? But same as if you spoke it. Not
[1:39:12] everything brother Brandham ever said
[1:39:13] was thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:39:16] But the message was from the throne of
[1:39:18] God. There's an illustration here I want
[1:39:21] to get to before we close of of Martin
[1:39:23] Luther King. You know, Brother Brandham
[1:39:25] talks in a sermon. I don't have time to
[1:39:26] go back and read all of it, but it he
[1:39:28] talks about how uh he said a million he
[1:39:30] said it'll bring a million of them to
[1:39:32] their death cuz he saw something that
[1:39:34] was happening. The riots and things were
[1:39:36] going on. He said and it's it's
[1:39:38] something wrong there. It'll bring a
[1:39:40] million of them to their death. And and
[1:39:42] you can go back and read that. And and
[1:39:44] and then in the next service that
[1:39:46] afternoon, uh it was Sister Humes at the
[1:39:50] tabernacle and brother Humes, they ran
[1:39:52] they were missionaries there in the
[1:39:53] tabernacle. ran into brother Brandham in
[1:39:55] a grocery store and that afternoon they
[1:39:59] when they ran into brother Brandham uh
[1:40:01] they said did you prophesy people were
[1:40:03] saying you prophesied a million souls
[1:40:05] would die because of Martin Luther King
[1:40:07] he said oh no they misunderstood he said
[1:40:09] thank you for bringing that to my
[1:40:10] attention I'll correct it tonight so
[1:40:12] that night he gets up and he does that
[1:40:15] and he said it's but he he begins to do
[1:40:18] it but listen to what he says he's
[1:40:20] talking about Martin Luther King and the
[1:40:21] and the and the movement there and
[1:40:23] and and not that racial we believe in
[1:40:26] equality of race,
[1:40:28] right? If you got a problem against a
[1:40:31] person because he's black or because
[1:40:32] he's white or whatever he is, that's
[1:40:34] that's your problem. You don't find that
[1:40:36] in the word of God. There ain't going to
[1:40:38] be separation in heaven. That's right.
[1:40:40] There's no racism and there's no
[1:40:41] shouldn't be here either, right? There's
[1:40:44] more there's more there's more people,
[1:40:46] black people and and and Asian people
[1:40:48] and all kinds of people in this message
[1:40:50] than there are Americans. Way more. far
[1:40:53] more. So I we don't even want to get
[1:40:55] that started,
[1:40:57] right? So we're not a bunch of racists.
[1:40:59] But brother Brandon was talking about
[1:41:00] something he sees a spirit in that
[1:41:02] communist movement, right? That's
[1:41:05] inspiring something that's wrong. Yeah.
[1:41:08] He said it's inspired of the wrong
[1:41:09] thing. You see them people, he said, and
[1:41:11] that's the reason I say that. He said,
[1:41:12] not that there's any prophecy concerning
[1:41:14] it. I have nothing on it from the Lord.
[1:41:17] Right? He said, "Be sure now if you say
[1:41:19] anything from the Lord like that to tell
[1:41:20] you, it's always I'm speaking now. But
[1:41:22] when he speaks, I say it's not me. It's
[1:41:24] thus sayith the Lord." He said, "I can't
[1:41:26] say it until he tells me." So he what
[1:41:28] they thought, "Well, a million people
[1:41:29] have to die because brother Brandham
[1:41:30] said it." But they missed the point of
[1:41:32] it,
[1:41:34] right? The message is still true.
[1:41:36] Listen, the the the idea that there was
[1:41:39] a problem with what was going on was
[1:41:41] true, but not everything Brother
[1:41:42] Brandham said was a prophecy of the
[1:41:44] future. But what he was saying was still
[1:41:46] true. It's still part of the message.
[1:41:49] Are you with me now? He said, "I can't."
[1:41:52] He said, "I can't say it till he tells
[1:41:53] me. I could be altogether wrong in my
[1:41:54] thought about Martin Luther King. I
[1:41:55] don't know. I can't say that. That's
[1:41:56] just my opinion. Anything that raises up
[1:41:59] trouble, he said, that's what's supposed
[1:42:00] to be in the last days. And it's all
[1:42:02] inspired of Satan to break up our
[1:42:04] commonwealth, whatever we have. Anything
[1:42:05] that raises up like that." So, I'm for
[1:42:07] those people down there. He said, "Don't
[1:42:08] you never think I'm not." But he saw
[1:42:11] something in it. We've seen the fruits
[1:42:12] of that in the modern liberal movement.
[1:42:16] Right. Right? We've seen the fruits of
[1:42:18] that, what it would come to. And brother
[1:42:20] Brandon was looking at it. But you see,
[1:42:22] brother Brandon when he saw current
[1:42:23] events wasn't like me looking at current
[1:42:25] events.
[1:42:27] Are you hearing me now? I told you,
[1:42:28] brother Brandon was looking at current
[1:42:29] events when he prophes when he made that
[1:42:31] statement about about the the the uh
[1:42:33] pope that was coming from the US.
[1:42:36] Brother Brandon was looking at current
[1:42:37] events at that time. The pope was dying.
[1:42:39] Yeah. Right. But as a prophet looking at
[1:42:42] current events, that's different than me
[1:42:44] looking at current events. Right? I can
[1:42:46] look at current events, say, "This might
[1:42:47] be that pope. This just looks like it
[1:42:49] is." But I'm not a prophet. Yeah. Are
[1:42:52] you with me now? But when a prophet
[1:42:54] looks at current events, he sees
[1:42:56] something in it. Yeah. He may not know
[1:42:58] exactly even what he's saying, but
[1:43:00] there's something about it. Why? He was
[1:43:02] a prophet and it was his opinion, but it
[1:43:05] mattered. Yeah. Right.
[1:43:09] A prophet's opinion. Because I know we
[1:43:10] get this and the devil work on your mind
[1:43:12] and pretty soon you're just whatever you
[1:43:14] don't like, you're going to say, "Well,
[1:43:15] that was just Brother Brandon's
[1:43:16] opinion." You realize the worldly church
[1:43:17] is doing that to Paul right now. Right.
[1:43:19] Yeah. It's true. Right. That's what
[1:43:21] they're doing to Paul. They're saying,
[1:43:22] "Well, Jesus said, you know, this and
[1:43:26] they'll tell you Jesus didn't say
[1:43:27] anything about homosexuality."
[1:43:31] Where do we get Romans 1,
[1:43:34] Paul? So, they'll say, "Well, we'll just
[1:43:36] take Jesus opinion. We know Jesus was
[1:43:40] right. That was just Paul's opinion. One
[1:43:42] place in scripture Paul said it even he
[1:43:44] even said it's I not the Lord. But Paul
[1:43:47] was a prophet.
[1:43:49] Are you with me now? And so we believe
[1:43:51] what we believe because we believe the
[1:43:53] word was written by prophets.
[1:43:56] Amen. If God could keep Paul's word,
[1:43:58] listen, if he could keep uh the word of
[1:44:01] the prophets of the Old Testament, holy
[1:44:02] men of God were inspired, if he could
[1:44:04] keep their word, he can keep this
[1:44:05] prophet's word. I don't have to correct
[1:44:07] it. He can do that. He can do that.
[1:44:10] He'll make it come to pass. Yeah.
[1:44:13] Good. A prophet's opinion matters. I had
[1:44:16] a boss who was the an attorney. He's now
[1:44:18] a judge, a Harvey Allen here and there.
[1:44:21] He he was a good man. He was good to me
[1:44:22] as far as being a I'm not giving him a
[1:44:25] recommendation as a judge, but he was he
[1:44:26] was good to me. He was my one of my
[1:44:28] first employers. And I I really liked
[1:44:31] Harvey, but I didn't always agree with
[1:44:33] him.
[1:44:35] He had an opinion. But it matters when
[1:44:38] he's a judge. Because the day he put on
[1:44:40] them
[1:44:41] robes, right? It matters what you are,
[1:44:45] what opinion you have. Come on, church.
[1:44:50] What position you're in, not the man,
[1:44:52] but the position he's in. Because now he
[1:44:54] can make an opinion about somebody and
[1:44:56] say, "This is right." But there's
[1:44:57] another court. That's good. Higher than
[1:44:59] him. Right? And there's another court
[1:45:01] beyond that, an appellet court. And
[1:45:04] there's another court beyond that, the
[1:45:05] state supreme court. And there's another
[1:45:08] court beyond that, the US Supreme Court.
[1:45:10] But once it reaches the US Supreme
[1:45:12] Court, there's no more. Right. Do you
[1:45:15] realize what a messenger to the age
[1:45:17] is? His message is the Supreme Court.
[1:45:21] Right.
[1:45:22] Yeah. Right. For that for the age you're
[1:45:24] living in. Yeah. So we may disagree with
[1:45:27] it. We may not understand it, but it's
[1:45:29] an opinion formed by a prophet. Yeah.
[1:45:32] Are you with me now? That's why we're so
[1:45:34] careful with it. And I don't mean and
[1:45:36] again people can misunderstand things. I
[1:45:38] you know we we bound heavy burdens to
[1:45:40] people because we just added stuff to
[1:45:41] the message,
[1:45:43] right? We just we just put our own
[1:45:45] opinions on it and we become so
[1:45:46] legalistic. That's not what we want. But
[1:45:49] a message is just what it is. Lord, help
[1:45:51] me to live it. I'm not going to I'm not
[1:45:53] going to throw it off on you and condemn
[1:45:54] you. I'm not going to get on Facebook
[1:45:56] and look at everything you do. God, far
[1:45:58] be it for me to have that kind of
[1:45:59] critical spirit. Let me stay in a place
[1:46:01] where I can just preach the word of God
[1:46:03] and say this is what a messenger said.
[1:46:06] This is what the Supreme Court said.
[1:46:08] Yeah. Somebody had to be the Supreme
[1:46:11] Court. Yeah. Huh? Are you with me now?
[1:46:16] You say, "Well, that that's not true.
[1:46:17] You don't understand what a prophet
[1:46:19] is or what a word prophet is. Just a
[1:46:23] prophet who preaches in the sanctuary."
[1:46:26] But but what do you do when you see
[1:46:27] something a message and opinion? Search
[1:46:28] the scripture.
[1:46:31] see if it's right. Good. See, because
[1:46:33] the Bereans were more noble than the
[1:46:35] Thessalonians in that they received the
[1:46:37] word with all readiness of mind and
[1:46:38] search the scriptures daily whether
[1:46:41] those things were. So, they didn't just
[1:46:42] take Paul's word for it. What did they
[1:46:43] do? They searched the scripture because
[1:46:45] a word prophet, it'll be in the
[1:46:47] scripture.
[1:46:48] You'll find something in the scripture
[1:46:49] about it. Are you with me now? The
[1:46:51] scripture will support it. Brother
[1:46:52] Brandham will will say it, but you got
[1:46:54] to find it the the background of it in
[1:46:56] the scripture. That's why we never leave
[1:46:58] the scripture when we preach doctrine.
[1:47:00] If I don't have a scripture, if I don't
[1:47:01] have something to back it up, I don't
[1:47:03] preach it. Yeah. Right. Because a word
[1:47:06] prophet comes from the scripture. And
[1:47:08] there must be something I don't
[1:47:09] understand. But I've never found
[1:47:10] anything a prophet taught. Right. And I
[1:47:13] know brother brother would say this and
[1:47:15] say that, but I've never seen anything a
[1:47:17] prophet taught that wasn't in the
[1:47:19] scripture. Are you with me now? Because
[1:47:22] he was a word prophet. Right? If I found
[1:47:24] something that wasn't in the scripture,
[1:47:25] I wouldn't be a I wouldn't be in the
[1:47:27] message. Right.
[1:47:29] Cuz I believe in the scripture that
[1:47:30] much. Yes. Amen. But it's it's the law
[1:47:34] is the ultimate law. The land is the law
[1:47:36] itself. Right. Right. But the Supreme
[1:47:38] Court's the opinion of that. Yes. Amen.
[1:47:40] Come on, church. That's where we're
[1:47:42] living. I thank God he clarified some
[1:47:44] things. I thank God he shed some light
[1:47:46] on it. He said he promised he would do
[1:47:48] it. He said at the evening time it shall
[1:47:50] be light. Yes. That's what we're living
[1:47:52] in. Brother said, "Sometimes these
[1:47:55] little crude expressions brings us to
[1:47:56] something. It gets us to study and puts
[1:47:59] you to reading the word." And that's
[1:48:00] what I want all my congregation to do.
[1:48:04] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:48:06] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:48:08] mouth of God. So read the word, study
[1:48:10] it, study it with the eyes of God to
[1:48:13] give your intellectuals understanding of
[1:48:14] how we should live in this present day.
[1:48:17] Brother Brown talked about how we got to
[1:48:18] face up to it. He talked about uh about
[1:48:21] about marriage and divorce and he's
[1:48:22] about to preach that and in a man
[1:48:24] running from the presence of the Lord.
[1:48:26] He's about to preach that and he says
[1:48:27] this. He said he said you've either got
[1:48:29] to face up to it or get away from it.
[1:48:30] You just can't stay neutral. You got to
[1:48:32] do something about it. Some move has got
[1:48:33] to be made. You can't come in that
[1:48:35] church door and go out the same person
[1:48:37] you come in. Now come on. That's a
[1:48:39] challenge to us this morning. You can't
[1:48:41] come in and go out the same. The way you
[1:48:43] accept the word and take the word will
[1:48:45] dictate I'm going to go out better or
[1:48:46] worse. I'm gonna go out with a better
[1:48:48] attitude or a worse attitude. Help me,
[1:48:50] Lord, to come out with a better
[1:48:51] attitude. Help me to come out with with
[1:48:53] more of you and less of the world. Oh,
[1:48:56] God. That's my desire today. Let me be
[1:48:58] more pleasing to you when I leave these
[1:49:00] walls.
[1:49:02] He said, "I want you to notice something
[1:49:03] when it's confronted. If there's a
[1:49:04] question about it, if question about
[1:49:06] there's got to be an answer." And he
[1:49:08] said, use the illustration if if you
[1:49:10] give me a direction. He said, "You can
[1:49:12] tell me go west." He said, "But there's
[1:49:13] a west somewhere,
[1:49:16] right? That's actually west. You could
[1:49:18] ask me say which way's west and I could
[1:49:19] say this way. But I think that's
[1:49:23] north, right? But but but I'm not see I
[1:49:27] might be turned around but there is a
[1:49:29] west. How do you find west?
[1:49:33] Right. God's compass. Are you with me
[1:49:36] now? He said when those questions
[1:49:38] confront us about the Bible truth,
[1:49:39] there's got to be the right answer
[1:49:40] somewhere. That's right. It's got to be
[1:49:42] there. And when we see something
[1:49:44] presented, I think instead of just run
[1:49:45] away and say, "Oh, nonsense. I couldn't
[1:49:47] believe a thing like that. I couldn't
[1:49:48] believe that." Why don't you take the
[1:49:50] Bible and sit down and face up to it.
[1:49:52] Don't just sit there and avoid it. Face
[1:49:54] up to it. Say, "Is this right or is it
[1:49:56] isn't it right?"
[1:49:59] Very good. Study it. You're here in the
[1:50:01] meeting now. He said, "Just look it
[1:50:02] over. Check it out yourself with the
[1:50:04] word." Check with the word by the word.
[1:50:06] He said, "That's the only way." Someone
[1:50:08] say, "The only way." The only way to
[1:50:11] make it tell the truth. And it must tell
[1:50:13] the truth from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:50:16] Don't just reject it, study it.
[1:50:19] Amen. Again, he said, "Those who are
[1:50:21] writing the scriptures down in the first
[1:50:23] seal," he's praying. He said, "May they
[1:50:25] study them." Those who are making tapes
[1:50:27] are hearing the tapes. May they study
[1:50:28] it. Not put their own interpretation to
[1:50:31] it now, but just study the
[1:50:34] word. Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] Elijah, musicians, go ahead and come. I
[1:50:40] got to stop. I don't do this very often,
[1:50:42] but I I'm way behind. So, we'll just
[1:50:48] close. See, I don't have a
[1:50:50] message. I keep a message
[1:50:53] alive. God tells Elijah to go to Ahab.
[1:50:56] So, he goes to Ahab and he says, "Now, I
[1:50:58] want you to go to the brook
[1:50:59] Cherith." He said, "I want you to sit by
[1:51:01] it and you're going to get fed by
[1:51:04] ravens.
[1:51:05] [Music]
[1:51:08] fed by ravens. Brother Brandon said that
[1:51:10] was his servants and they brought him
[1:51:12] sandwiches every day. Praise
[1:51:17] God. Every day they brought sandwiches,
[1:51:20] meat and bread. The ravens
[1:51:24] did. And brother Brandham said, "Thank
[1:51:26] God for those
[1:51:28] ravens." He said, "That was God's
[1:51:31] servants." He said, "They kept the voice
[1:51:33] of Elijah alive.
[1:51:36] when he wasn't with the
[1:51:37] people. Oh God, that's how I see my
[1:51:41] ministry. Just to keep the voice of
[1:51:43] Elijah alive in our generation. Let me
[1:51:46] be one who can feed him. But you know
[1:51:47] what keeps ravens like crows? You know
[1:51:49] what keeps them away?
[1:51:52] [Music]
[1:51:54] Scarecrows. And when we I think all of
[1:51:57] us, not just the preachers, we ought to
[1:51:58] be keeping this message
[1:52:00] alive. Our hearts have to be in it. But
[1:52:04] what keeps us back is
[1:52:06] scarecrows. And scarecrows raise up and
[1:52:08] say, "Well, people will think you're a
[1:52:09] cult, and people think I'm funny if I
[1:52:11] dress that way." Just a
[1:52:14] scarecrow. But brother Brandon talked
[1:52:16] about a hedgehog that was out eating
[1:52:17] butter beans. And he said he was out
[1:52:19] there in the garden, and when he come
[1:52:20] out in the garden, he said, "Brother
[1:52:22] Brandon said, I got so tired of meeting
[1:52:23] the butter beans." He said, "I made a a
[1:52:25] scarecrow." He said, "It looked so
[1:52:26] spooky. I thought it was pretty good."
[1:52:27] He said, "I hung it up there and it was
[1:52:28] jangling and everything else." He said,
[1:52:30] "But the little hedgehog looked up at
[1:52:31] it." He said, and it moved and he kind
[1:52:33] of looked. He said, but after a while,
[1:52:34] he realized it wasn't real. Some of us
[1:52:37] this morning need to realize just the
[1:52:38] devil trying to trouble your mind. It's
[1:52:40] just the devil trying to take you out of
[1:52:42] the message of the hour, make you not
[1:52:44] believe the word. You need to you need
[1:52:45] to raise up against that thing. And I
[1:52:47] don't care about the scarecrow. He said,
[1:52:49] you know what he did? He didn't pay no
[1:52:50] more attention. He just went down the
[1:52:52] road eating butter beans. That's what we
[1:52:53] need to do. Spiritual food in due
[1:52:55] season. Let's just keep on keeping the
[1:52:57] message alive. Keep on keeping the
[1:53:00] message alive. Don't let the scarecrows
[1:53:02] keep the ravens away from the me from
[1:53:04] keeping the voice of Elijah alive.
[1:53:07] There's been lots of nonsense, but it's
[1:53:09] just
[1:53:10] scarecrows. Let's keep the message alive
[1:53:12] cuz there is a heaven and there is a
[1:53:14] literal Jesus Christ who will come in a
[1:53:15] body form to catch away his bride.
[1:53:17] That's what believers believe. And that
[1:53:20] message is true. It was true yesterday.
[1:53:21] It'll be true tomorrow. It'll be true in
[1:53:23] these kids' generation. It'll be true if
[1:53:26] we here another hundred years or if we
[1:53:28] go tomorrow. It'll still be the truth.
[1:53:30] Why? God spoke it. He vindicated it.
[1:53:32] Let's keep that alive for our children,
[1:53:34] for our grandchildren. If God dares, God
[1:53:37] bless you this morning. Brother Joel.
[1:53:39] Hallelujah. Let's just pray first and
[1:53:41] brother Joel's going to sing. Heavenly
[1:53:44] Father, Lord, I don't usually cut a
[1:53:47] message off like this, but I just my
[1:53:49] heart. Lord, I believe you spoke some
[1:53:52] things this
[1:53:53] morning. I pray you'd help us, Lord. We
[1:53:56] not be afraid. Say, well, he was a man.
[1:53:59] and he made mistakes, but let's not be
[1:54:00] afraid to keep the voice of Elijah
[1:54:02] alive. Pray you'd grant that, Lord.
[1:54:05] Lord, may we be one. May I be one, Lord,
[1:54:10] who brings that bread and food to a
[1:54:13] prophet, Lord. And after that, Elijah
[1:54:15] went
[1:54:16] down into a city he was told to go to.
[1:54:20] And there was a gentile woman that
[1:54:23] sustained him all the days of the
[1:54:25] famine. Lord, I pray we would be that
[1:54:28] bride, that gentile bride that keeps
[1:54:30] this message alive. No matter what the
[1:54:33] world does, what the worldly church
[1:54:34] does, Lord, let's keep that alive until
[1:54:37] the time of the end. I pray you'd grant
[1:54:38] it, Lord. If there's one here that's
[1:54:40] never met you, I pray you'd help them to
[1:54:42] meet you. The message is about Christ.
[1:54:44] It's about a personal relationship with
[1:54:46] Christ. We don't have a personal
[1:54:47] relationship with a prophet, but we do
[1:54:49] have a personal relationship with
[1:54:50] Christ. I pray God, you'd help them to
[1:54:52] know you, the power of your
[1:54:54] resurrection. or if they haven't been
[1:54:56] baptized in Christian baptism, may they
[1:54:58] be quick to do that, Lord, and be
[1:55:00] willing to surrender themselves to the
[1:55:01] word, not to me, but to the word of God.
[1:55:04] May we all ever be corrected by your
[1:55:07] word, Lord. May we be better when we go
[1:55:09] out. We don't want to be worse. We know
[1:55:11] we got to go out one way or the other.
[1:55:13] May we be better when we leave. We pray
[1:55:15] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. If
[1:55:19] you want prayer, we'll be glad to pray
[1:55:20] with you this morning. Amen. Let's sing
[1:55:23] together in the light. Let's stand. Oh,
[1:55:26] such a
[1:55:28] beautiful life. God bless you today. Oh,
[1:55:33] come. Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:55:36] Drops of
[1:55:39] mercy are bright.
[1:55:42] Won't you shine
[1:55:44] all around
[1:55:46] us by day
[1:55:49] and by
[1:55:52] night?
[1:55:54] Jesus the light
[1:55:57] of the
[1:56:00] world. Oh, we'll walk
[1:56:05] in the light. It's such a
[1:56:10] beautiful
[1:56:12] light and it comes
[1:56:15] where the dew
[1:56:18] drops of
[1:56:21] mercy are bright. Won't you shine
[1:56:26] all around
[1:56:28] us by day
[1:56:31] and by night?
[1:56:34] [Music]
[1:56:36] Jesus the light of the
[1:56:40] praise of me and all the things to me.
[1:56:44] And
[1:56:46] all ye
[1:56:48] saints of
[1:56:51] light
[1:56:54] proclaim, oh
[1:56:57] Jesus, the light
[1:56:59] of the world.
[1:57:05] Oh
[1:57:07] life and
[1:57:10] mercy
[1:57:12] in his
[1:57:15] name is
[1:57:18] Jesus the light
[1:57:20] of the
[1:57:23] world. Oh we'll walk
[1:57:28] in the light. It's such a
[1:57:33] beautiful
[1:57:35] light and it comes
[1:57:38] where the dew
[1:57:41] drops of
[1:57:44] mercy are
[1:57:45] bright. Won't you shine
[1:57:49] all around
[1:57:51] us by day
[1:57:54] and by night?
[1:57:59] Jesus the light
[1:58:02] of the
[1:58:05] world. Oh, we will walk
[1:58:09] in in the
[1:58:11] light. It's such a
[1:58:15] beautiful
[1:58:17] life. And it comes
[1:58:20] with the two
[1:58:22] drops of
[1:58:25] mercy on.
[1:58:27] Oh, you shine
[1:58:30] all around
[1:58:32] us by day
[1:58:35] and by
[1:58:38] night.
[1:58:40] Jesus, the light
[1:58:43] of the
[1:58:45] world and falling in
[1:58:48] love with Jesus.
[1:58:54] Oh, falling in
[1:58:56] love with
[1:59:01] Jesus. And falling in
[1:59:03] love with
[1:59:07] Jesus is the best thing I've
[1:59:11] ever ever
[1:59:14] done. Oh
[1:59:16] yes. In his
[1:59:18] arms I
[1:59:21] feel protected.
[1:59:25] In his
[1:59:26] arms, I'm never
[1:59:31] disconnected. In his
[1:59:33] arms, I
[1:59:35] feel
[1:59:37] protected. Oh, there's no place I'd
[1:59:41] rather be. One more
[1:59:44] [Music]
[1:59:46] time. We're falling in
[1:59:48] love with Jesus.
[1:59:53] Yes, we are falling in
[1:59:56] love with
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:01] Jesus. Falling in
[2:00:03] love with
[2:00:07] Jesus was the best thing I've ever Oh,
[2:00:12] sing it one more time. In his arms.
[2:00:15] [Music]
[2:00:17] Oh, in his
[2:00:18] arms I
[2:00:20] feel
[2:00:23] protected. In his
[2:00:25] arms, I'm never
[2:00:30] [Music]
[2:00:31] disconnected. In his
[2:00:33] arms, I
[2:00:35] feel
[2:00:37] protected. There's no place I'd
[2:00:41] rather be.
[2:00:44] Aren't you thankful for the word of the
[2:00:46] Lord this morning? Somebody say, "Praise
[2:00:48] the Lord." And give him a big hand clap
[2:00:50] of
[2:00:54] praise. Amen. My God is real. The key of
[2:00:56] G. Amen. Did you enjoy service this
[2:00:59] morning? Amen. Let's come back at 3:00
[2:01:01] and expect more from the Lord. Amen. If
[2:01:03] you can, God bless you. Amen. We're
[2:01:05] going to sing this and you're free to
[2:01:06] go. Well, there are some
[2:01:10] things I may not
[2:01:14] know. There are some
[2:01:17] place I just can't
[2:01:20] [Music]
[2:01:22] go. But I am
[2:01:25] sure. Oh, of this one
[2:01:29] thing that God is real. For I can't feel
[2:01:35] him deep
[2:01:37] within. Oh my God is
[2:01:41] real. He's real in my
[2:01:45] soul. My God is real. For he has washed
[2:01:50] and made me
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:53] whole. His love for
[2:01:57] me is like your gold.
[2:02:01] My God is real for I can feel him in my
[2:02:08] soul. Some folks may
[2:02:12] doubt. Some folks may
[2:02:15] scorn or they can all go
[2:02:18] on and leave me alone.
[2:02:24] But as for
[2:02:26] me, oh, I'll take God's
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:31] part and God is real. For I can't feel.
[2:02:36] I'll sing it with all your hearts now.
[2:02:39] Well, my God is
[2:02:42] real. He's real in my Yes, he's real in
[2:02:46] my soul. My God is real. For he has
[2:02:51] washed. Oh, has he made you whole this
[2:02:53] morning? Oh, his love for
[2:02:57] me. His life. Yes, it's like pure gold.
[2:03:02] My God is real. For I can feel him in my
[2:03:09] soul, but I cannot
[2:03:13] tell just how you
[2:03:16] fell when Jesus took your sins all away.
[2:03:23] Aren't you glad he did it? But ever
[2:03:26] since that
[2:03:27] day, ever since that
[2:03:32] hour, my God has been real. For I can
[2:03:36] feel his holy
[2:03:39] power. Oh my God is
[2:03:43] real. He's real in my
[2:03:46] [Music]
[2:03:47] soul. My God is real. For he has washed
[2:03:52] and made me whole.
[2:03:55] Oh, his love for
[2:03:58] me is like pure
[2:04:01] [Music]
[2:04:02] gold. My God is real or I can't feel.
[2:04:07] Oh, clap your hands and sing it one more
[2:04:09] time. Oh, my God is
[2:04:13] real. He's real in my soul. Yes, He is.
[2:04:18] My God is real. For he has washed and he
[2:04:23] made me
[2:04:25] whole. His love for
[2:04:28] me. His
[2:04:30] life oh like pure gold. My God is real
[2:04:35] for I can't feel. Amen. Sing it as you
[2:04:39] go now. Oh my God is
[2:04:44] real. He's real in my soul.
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:48] My God is real. For he has washed. Oh,
[2:04:53] he made me
[2:04:55] whole. His love for
[2:04:59] me. His
[2:05:01] life just like pure gold. My God is
[2:05:05] real. Where I can feel him in my
[2:05:10] soul. I cannot
[2:05:14] tell just how you felt.
[2:05:17] [Music]
[2:05:18] when Jesus took your sins all
[2:05:25] away. But ever since that
[2:05:28] day, oh, ever since that
[2:05:33] hour, my God has been real. For I can
[2:05:37] feel his holy
[2:05:40] power. Oh, my God is real.
