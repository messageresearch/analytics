so good to be in the presence of the Lord this morning Second Kings 12 Verses 4 and 5. I wanted to say I appreciated that those of you that went to the tent meetings I know some of you couldn't go but for those of you that could I really appreciated that so many of you went on Wednesday night and if you go back some of you that weren't there on Friday night but if you go back to Friday night's sermon by the Wayne Lawson preached a sermon I'm going to be taking those same scriptures and that same quote that he read next Wednesday night when we let out service Wednesday night that was the same text and scriptures and quote that he was gonna he came from on Friday night so I felt like that was just the Lord that was confirming that for us and and relating out our services here so I appreciate you going and those of you that could and we're glad to see you this morning it's good to be in the house of the Lord isn't it amen each and every one of you Second Kings 12 and 4 and joash fed to the priest all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord even the money of everyone that passes the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the Lord let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance now watch when I'm preaching about money this morning I want you to watch what they did to let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found I pray the Lord without his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to continue to speak this morning on a home to come back to a home to come back to and we'd like to talk this morning on repairing the house preparing the house when Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem it was a magnificent building it was perfect in its design the plans came from David who received them by Revelation from Jehovah himself in first Chronicles 28 11 it says David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof upper chambers thereof of the inner parlors of the place of the mercy seat and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the Courts of the house of the Lord and of all the chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of God of the treasuries of the dedicated things and then he goes on in verse 19 he said all this said David the Lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me so in other words David was drawing in Inspiration he was actually drawing out the blueprint of the temple but he wasn't doing it out of his own mind but he was doing it under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and when he drew it out he said he said in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern and so God actually it come from the not from the mind of David but it actually come from the mind of God himself that he drew out the pattern of of the thing that he had that had in God's mind I want you to understand today Not only was the temple built that way but the church was built that way your family was built that way that there's something about it that I feel like my monitors are gone this morning morning but it's something about it that it feels like that that God had it in his mind and you come down to the age that we live in and you realize that God's design has been broken up but we don't have to be broken up right we don't have to follow the design of Satan for the temple because we have the mind of God in this hour the message of the hour that tells us what a family should be what a church should be that's what they had in the temple it was the design if you go back to Moses he also designed it in the same way that it was designed in such a pattern that God himself it was the mind of God that come down and made a tabernacle and made a temple and brother random say he made it like the one fact of scripture says he made it like the one in heaven amen and so a God he imposed his mind on if you translated Supernatural things into natural things and he had that in his mind and he put that in the design of the temple and in the design of the family God has translated what was in his mind in a supernatural form and he's translated those thoughts down into a natural form into how a husband treats his wife how a wife treats her husband how children should be what how a church should operate how the pastor should be and what the deacons should be and all of those things they didn't come from the mind of a man that come from the mind of God so we can't just change those things say well I don't feel like it should be that way I'll just go a different direction no it didn't come from the mind of a man it come from the mind of God himself we believe that today hey man the way we should have church and how we how we should worship God all of those things it was the pattern acts too what's the pattern that God had in his mind are you with me this morning the pattern came from God and when it was finished it must have been glorious can you imagine walking into the temple for the cave it wasn't no small thing it was one of the wonders of the world when they walked into the temple grounds first you come into the outer courts which was very large and you would see a great brass sea or a Laver a brass a great like a bowl a brass out there in in front of the temple that they would use for the for the water in and the blood and they would they would use it in there with instance burning going up to God and as you walked inside the temple you find that the entire Temple was overlaid with gold the whole thing and this is a fairly large building that was actually completely overlaid with gold they tell us that to build that building today would cost between three and six billion dollars to rebuild the Temple three and six billion dollars but God had it in his mind right so they spared no expense the everything was done in fact the Bible tells us to not the sound of a saw or a hammer wasn't heard in that Temple and when you would have walked in the craftsmanship was so perfect they didn't cover up their mistakes everything was just right it was built just right because the workmen were even inspired to fulfill the mind of the Lord in building that Temple and when they walked in when you walked into it you come in and it was all inspiring you come into the holy place with the main part of the temple you walk into the holy place and here here was the great place where there would be a a gold over everything and and here would be an altar and there was a place where there would be an altar and a place to altar of incense but then inside was the holy of holies which was a small room and inside of the holy of holies was the was The Mercy Seat which was the lid that went over the Ark of the Covenant inside of that was the law of God they actually at that time still had the tablets of Moses that he remade after he broke the original ones he had the tablets of Moses on the inside and so there was the law of God it was so perfect and so beautiful yes that's right you would have thought that they would have wanted to keep it up you would have thought that would there would have been something in them but the Joel that would have won it keep that temple in that pristine condition are you with me this morning and just like your house you know I look at my house my house wasn't designed by God because if God would have designed it he would have put some things in different places because there's some things that are just odd about my house so it was built and I'm not complaining it's just whoever built it we like we love our home but it was just built in an odd way it's a Cherokee Village house if you from Cherokee Village you know what I'm talking about so there's just an odd design to it and many times we you know the very best that you could take the care to design something and you would design a home maybe and you build it just exactly the way you want it to be but when you get done you might say well I wish I'd have put the uh the pantry over there or I wish I'd have put the laundry room out here and in our house the laundry room was in the basement so somebody gets to carry the laundry up and down the stairs all the time and and so you just little things like that and you think oh I wish I'd have done that differently once you start living in it but nobody ever thought that about the temple because this was God's house this was God's Divine listen to me I want to get that to you this morning your family is God's design our families are God's design our churches should be God's designs not ours we don't make the church in our image how we want it to be right we don't make our families in our image how we want them to be but we strive to find the mind of the Lord I may want to do that this morning Lord I want your mind I I want my family and your did you tell me Lord howdy what did you tell me to do how did you tell me that hey man amen now a church or a family is the same as a house in that constant care must be taken or they'll crumble no it had been about 120 years since Solomon built the temple but there were some very specific reasons why that when you come down to the time of joash after a thalia's reign and now joash realizes that the house of God has been broken up the house of God has been broken up and there were some very specific reasons why the house of God was broken up and we're going to talk about those this morning but I want you to understand that it doesn't help you to dwell especially when it comes to family life or even with church life it doesn't help you to look back and say well this is why it was broken up if that's all you do is look back and realize why it was broken up but what you want to do is how to how do we repair this how do we fix this because and again you say well that would never happen to me but constant care must be taken or the house of God crumbles constant care must be taken or your family crumbles you know what I'm talking about this morning when it comes to your own spiritual walk with God you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost how many knows the Bible teaches that today well you're all tired this morning the Bible teaches that the holy uh you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost if you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost what does that tell us it tells us that constant care must be taken or even Solomon's Temple a predestinated temple from the mind of God could fall into disrepair yes if somebody's not there that's why God called Ephesians 4 11. that's why he called a five-fold Ministry he called those workmen to come in and begin to work on the temple to keep it up and keep it repaired and keep the and keep the gold on and keep the keep the wood in the right place he called he called Ben to do that and he called you Mom and Dad to do that in your family he called you to lead your family in prayer he called you to be a servant to you the people to your family are you hearing me this morning amen so there was a very specific reason though why this Temple was in disrepair in second chronicles 24 7 the sons of Italian that Wicked Woman and remember we typed that to this age that we're living in this age of the spirit of Jezebel which was who was a thalia's counselor remember Jezebel was taught by a value was taught by Jezebel how to be what she was and so now that Wicked woman teaches a value who become the only queen of Judah in fact she become the only completely unrighteous one that that served that was the ruler of Judah because she wasn't in the line of David and remember the promise had been that there would not be a break in the line of David remember that and there wasn't until the kingdom was completely overthrown so the line of David continued on but it continued on in secret because joash was being hit in the temple right so if Talia is taking rulership over the land and so now she had Sons and her sons those that Wicked woman's Sons had broken up the house of God oh I'm going to preach this morning God help us today and also all the dedicated things of the house of the Lord did they bestow upon Balaam that word broken up is to tear apart or tear away or to tear off for one from oneself to be broken off and so those princes of Judah who should have been caring for the upkeep upkeep of the house of God instead used it for personal gain now watch what they were doing and and they were actually going into the house of God but you know what's odd about it you know Joe Ash notices it but where were the priests where were the men because this would be like excuse me you trustees this morning but this would be like the trustees because that's what the the princes of Israel were in the position of like a trustee they were responsible they weren't ministers but they were responsible for keeping the upkeep of that Temple and and the City but for taking care of God's people in that way and so here are the princes of of Israel be like the trustees coming to the church stealing microphones taking away the chairs and taking the paint off the walls it'd be like Brother David walking in one day and say I think I need an organ in my house taking it home where were the people at I tell you where they were at not in the house of God because if they'd have been in the house of God they would have noticed God help us today they would have noticed that those things were missing yes they didn't notice again you said brother Ben we have a house of God it's wonderful but I'm talking spiritually now spiritually now when things begin to go missing and people don't notice people don't notice nobody says anything well because it's a princely he's got a big name he he belongs you know he he he's around the message he got a big name I don't care who it is taking stuff that doesn't belong to them out of the house of God we should not allow it again I'm talking spiritually now there ain't nobody stealing stuff but what's he trying to steal trying to steal your joy trying to steal your peace trying to steal the things of God Your god-given Righteous children of God Satan wants to steal it away from you today and he comes right into the house of God yeah come on you imagine they were Brazen they come in with crowbars come right into the house of God and started breaking stuff off well I need some extra money this week so they come in and grabbed a gold palm trees in Boston gold in the house of God there was all kinds of the walls were decorated in gold and all that and they come in and grab some for themselves precious stones covered the inside of that house you can't imagine the cost of it and the value of it don't you realize that's what Satan is trying to do today is he's trying to come into your home he's trying to come into the house of God and he's trying to steal anything of value he wants to steal your healing he wants to steal your salvation he wants to steal are you with me this morning he's trying to steal everything of value out of the house Acts 20 and 28 the same thing happened in the New Testament yeah Paul says stick heed unto yourselves into all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood for I know this but after my departing so Grievous woes entering among you yes not sparing the yeah taking the gold in the jewels and the deity from the inside of the temple of God and again in second chronicles 3 6 it tells us there that he garnished the house with precious stones for Beauty and the gold was the gold pervarium it was the very best the very best goal the most precious stones the sons of Italian took out and no one noticed it you know when no one notices it when the church is not in Revival yes that's why we constantly strive for Revival he said brother being you're pushing you're pushing why are you keep pushing we want to be in Revival if we're not in Revival we need to be praying for Revival because we know that when the church is in I'm talking about Among Us I'm not talking about a worldwide thing I'm talking about just Among Us and and in our individual lives when we are not in Revival Satan can come in and it begins to go unnoticed that he steals the family prayer out of the home and you never noticed that it was gone he stole your personal devotions out you never noticed that it was gone he stole away your time to study the message he stole away your time to get along with God he stole away the time that you spent with your children are you with me this morning and you thought it was a good thing yeah he had a reason I'm sure he did I'm sure those Sons when they left they said oh we're taking this away because it don't really fit it didn't really look good there anyway we'll replace it with something else I'm sure it looked good when they took it away but you can't beat God's program yes sir good good I don't care who you are and how smart you are can't beat God's program some of you old people ought to say Amen to that this morning you know my past experience that when you follow the word you there was something in your life you could stand on yes you had trials yes you had trouble yes you had circumstances but when you stayed with the word there was a standing place there there was a rock a foundation but when you stray off you can see what happens in your life yeah now Solomon's Temple was designed in a similar way to the Ark of the Covenant and we're told in the scripture how that's done but I want to go to where brother random talks about it because he speaks of it so wonderfully he talks about how that they put the gold over the wood in the Ark of the Covenant when they built it he said now watch the Ark of the Covenant he said You shall make it out of acacia wood I don't know if I'm saying that correctly and overlay it with gold he said anyone who knows the scripture knows that gold speaks of deity yeah and wood speaks of humanity that's God's purpose by the way is Christ in you in you the hope of glory right the mystery that was hit from the beginning the second part of that threefold purpose of God Christ in you now watch he said he knows that gold speaks of deity in Wood speaks of humanity see he said You shall cover it overlay it with gold over the wood he said that's deity over the wood that's the way the temple was built deity over the wood Christ over the church inside and out I love it deity overlaid he said now you'll have a lid on top of it so on top of the Ark of the Covenant the Ark of the Covenant was basically a box and then on top of that there will be a lid he said you'll have a lid on top of it it'll be a mercy seat or a place of mercy and all the laws will rest in it he said but before you take it in sprinkle it over with blood he said the law speaks of judgment remember those tablets were there inside the Ark of the Covenant but between the law and the congregation oh this ought to make a shout this morning if we could if we could get happy about anything it ought to make us happy between the law and the congregation what's a curtain yeah for deity stood in this place yeah he said it was a type of Christ between the wrath of God the judgment and Hell between that and the believer stands dear to himself Glory Christ standing in the way what's he standing in the way of my own stupidity my own arrogance oh God my own stubbornness he's standing in between me and that law are you hearing me today that's why we need him every moment in our lives that's why we should worship him every moment in our life that's why we need him all the time in the church why because he stands between yeah yeah oh my God hallelujah standing in the way with an atonement made to save us from our sins and to heal us from our sickness the law was a judge the law judged I just love this but the atonement stood between the confessed believer and the judgment there laid the Judgment in the ark ready to come forth but when it did it couldn't when it did it couldn't for there was an atonement standing between it and the believer Hallelujah and the believer come and accepted Christ in his shadow in time shed blood sprinkled upon The Mercy Seat then he had mercy and could walk away rejoicing because he was free from judgment oh might he used Romans 8 1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit don't let the devil condemn you for what you were you're not that person anymore don't let him condemn you for an old book The Old book's been done away with God don't even remember it against you anymore yes he said when a man knows that he has died to the things of the world and those who get in Christ Jesus and walking according to the Holy Spirit and not the ways of the sinful World there is no condemnation to him Hallelujah you're going to wake up and realize what that means someday you can look in the face of hell and of judgment and rejoice yeah it's good a hard sermon don't bother him he says Thank you lord for keeping me yeah thank you for making an atonement a bleeding word I've been lost by the water of the word it doesn't matter if I get skin down and strung out it doesn't matter whether the pastor comes or some evangelists come and preaches something that gets on me I know that that's the that's an atonement word that's keeping me Hallelujah it's keeping me a bleeding word keeping me from the things of the world a bleeding word there's no condemnation a bleeding word is keeping me from the things of the world amen he said he can look in the face of hell and judgment and rejoice because there's the blood of Christ making atonement standing between him and judgment the believer wants in it was a lid you realize without the it was done separately you'd think that he'd have built a box an ark with a lid but he built an ark with no lid but the lid was The Mercy Seat and it sat down on top of the Ark and as long as the lid was there that's why we believe his Mercy is still open because if Mercy was over if the blood is off the emergency seat then that judgment can come right out of the Ark and we've got to face up to it and no man can live the law not in these bodies are you hear me today you can't live the law in these bodies you're gonna mess up you're gonna make mistakes but God said I'm gonna be I'm going to stand between you and your mistakes I'm going to stand between you and the Judgment I'm going to stand between you and hell I'm going to stand between you and the Judgment look he said the lid was shut down the lid was The Mercy Seat the lid comes down on top of the Ark of the Covenant and that settles it Glory no one can take the lid off of a believer what is that it's the Holy Spirit yeah now watch what he says it was he said it's Amen gold deity laid over and underneath it and all around it around what The Mercy Seat right wrapped up in deity Glory he said in every man that's coming to Christ is wrapped up in the Holy Spirit yes up in the Holy Spirit there's a lid on the law yeah right and brother Brandon explained it this way he said he said if if I had permission from the mayor to drive as fast as I wanted to right maybe you have some kind of a job where you have permission that on an emergency call you can drive as fast as you want to he said how could I break the speed limit right you realize a Christian cannot sin preach a Christian cannot sin I don't think we understand that it's hard to believe isn't it yeah that's what the Bible says you have an atonement right you're free from sin if you say if you sin you have no part in Christ but you can't sin and the reason why you can't sin is because the Holy Spirit is overlaid over your life that don't mean you can't do the ACT what makes it not sin is not that you didn't tell that person something that wasn't true and I'm not excusing that today because if deity is in its proper place and on the lid in your life you're not going to do those things you understand that that you're not going to want to do those things right but the fact that you don't sin is not due to the fact that you never did it yeah but the fact that you don't sin is due to the fact that he don't see it yes right the law cannot come up out of the Ark of the Covenant and judge you because deity hahaha oh God you realize how important the holy spirit is right so well I'll just I'll just believe and be baptized come to church that's good but you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost because what stands between you in judgment is not your baptism not your water baptism but it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's deity rapping wrapping you in deity oh God wrapped in deity every man that's coming to Christ is wrapped up in the Holy Spirit and become Sons and Daughters of God he said over in this beat out gold he said they got it hot and beat it and the beater of the gold beat the gold you had to beat it with a hammer and they beat the gold oh I love this until you see his reflection in it all you say I've been going through a lot brother Ben ever since I've become a Christian I've been going through it just hang in there he's beating out the gold he's beating out the gold he's getting it ready so he can see his image in it and he beat out the gold and then what do they do they get it hot yeah yeah you can't pour deity cold yeah oh thank you oh yeah can you see what I'm saying today you can't do it that's why people say well we'll just take the word we'll just take the word you choose the word you can't pull pour the word out yeah cold it's not in a form to be poured out you can't overlay it to get gold in a condition where we'll overlay the inside of the temple the inside of the holy of holies the outside of The Mercy Seat when you get to that position where it will do that how can you do it you've got to get it so hot you melt it yes sir oh God he said he had to beat it with a hammer and then get her hot and pour her out over the ark and it soaked into the wood see the problem with some people is that deity is laying there but it's never been heated up and poured over the wood oh my the Holy Spirit wants to pour it over the wood until it soaks in oh God help us today that's why we want the atmosphere to be right that's why we strive to have God guilty in our services have the Holy Spirit we want it to be so hot so fervent that you pour down oh God I don't want deity just next to me you realize I had the word I have God this is God in repent for him it can be right here yeah my this got the Bible on it's got 100 different translations probably it's got thousands and thousands of commentaries all over the internet that I could find and pull in it's got all the messages yeah audio and print all of it just on this one little tablet but it's just there by me yeah but if I can ever get the heat of the Holy Spirit to come on it right well my if I can ever Jesus said it's expedient for you that I go away he said because the Holy Ghost needs to come and lead you and guide you into all truth if I can ever get it hot enough where it'll pour out on me and soak in oh my God when the Holy Spirit being the power I'm not just saying this what he said when the Holy Spirit being the power Holy Ghost and Fire poured out upon the believer through the blood of Christ makes an atonement there for him he is safe from all Divine judgments yes oh Hallelujah aren't you glad to be living that way I don't have to worry say well brother Ben I can't come to church right now I've been sinning are you born again do you have the Holy Ghost repent of that thing and you need to discover if your life is just habitually that way maybe you need the Holy Ghost maybe you thought you got an emotion or a sensation you didn't get the deed he poured out because when the deity is poured out it soaks into the wood yeah this is what a thalia's son stole from the temple yeah yeah deity over Humanity this is what the Catholic Church began to steal away this is what that white horse rider the first seal began to steal away from the church they begin to steal the deity oh God help us today I don't want to be standing by the door when Italian's Sons come by and say oh God bless you bless your heart you're such a good person I see you carrying off that big old hunk of gold I see you taking that big old palm tree I see you carrying off that vessel that's supposed to be in the house of God you're going to go out and use it for Balaam bless God you're such a good person wouldn't want to say anything to hurt you here they go out the door how many priests stood there at the door and watched but a thalia's Sons were too big to fail yeah hear me church we don't get that big your pastor don't get that big other people around it we don't get that big I don't care if they're a pastor a deacon or trustee or whatever if you see things missing from the house of God it's the congregation not just the preachers but the congregation has a has a right not only a right but a responsibility to speak up and say where are the things missing from the house of God where is the deity that covered the humanity where is that praise where is that love where is that thing that made us love our neighbors where is that spirit of God that would come down in such a powerful way that people would be drunk on the spirit of God where's it at yes you have a right it's a congregation to say where are those things come on back oh could you say that with me today don't you realize that thou your sons are in the land today they're trying to steal away the deity off of your life trying to steal the Holy Ghost right off of you and you don't realize that you don't recognize it oh God if you could ever get in the word yeah walk into the temple and begin to look around there's some things missing here are you hearing me this morning yeah mothers fathers what are you doing in your family I don't know if I'll revisit this series on the family again or not but I know this as we come down we've preached several weeks where are we at is there things missing yeah where's the love words are Joy yeah where's our desire to go to the house of God take a look around the temple today look around see is there things missing yeah he said but I had a reason it doesn't matter why the devil don't care how he keeps you out of church he don't care how he steals the joy out of your life he don't care how he does if he does it by a preacher or by the internet or by TV or by pornography or by lust or by field he don't care how he does it he just wants to do it he just wants to take it out of the house of God so we're standing today in the house of God and my job as a pastor to get you to look around you hear me today what's missing you can look around and say it's all there praise God and I believe that the message of the hour restored it all but what's missing from our individual application of the word yeah what did God say would be and what are we yeah God help us today I don't mean no that don't mean you're not a Christian but I'm trying to de-christianize you today but take a look around the house yeah yeah take a look around your family What's missing you see your kids start straight away and all they're interested in is is the things of the world and maybe that starts Young by the way I've seen it over and over again they get so interested in sports and the things of the world and they get to a place they have no interest you can't drag them to a meeting you can't make them go and you don't yeah until they get colder and they get colder and they get colder and they finally get to where they're sitting on the front but they sit on the back and they finally leave the house of God entirely and you won't begin to wonder what happened see all of the valuable things you realize how valuable our children are Sons realized that they couldn't separate the deity from the gold because they've been poured in what did they do they took the whole post took the whole piece of wood took it out of the house of God yeah Satan's gonna fight our children yeah he's gonna fight us yeah yeah and the biggest influence over your children's life is Mom and Dad yeah the biggest influence over your children's life is Mom and Dad I think family members are close second the church is in there somewhere yeah depending on how much you're in church but it's a big influence but only in proportion to how much time you realize how much time you spend at home with your kids yeah some of us I should have said some of y'all because I've not I've worked and preached and taken Saturdays away from my family I've done that I've been there done that I know what that's like I know what that's like you got to watch them you got to watch the house when you see them begin to drift out the door you better grab a hold of them you better grab a hold of that Joy it may be serving down there in another Temple before long it may be down there in the bar room it may be down there and say in the jail it may be down there somewhere else you better grab hold of that gold and as I said there'll be some that's strange but it knows I belong in the house of God oh my because the pattern of the temple was right what God Said for it to me so you may stray your children may stray but you know there's I belong I wasn't created can you imagine I'm getting way off my notes today but can you imagine a post that belonged in the temple of God and it was overlaid with gold and they took it down and put it in the temple of Baal and it was sitting there all by its Lonesome self it wasn't created to be in the temple of Baal it wasn't created to be on drugs and alcohol it wasn't created for that and so it was miserable if a post can be miserable this Humanity overlaid with gold was miserable out of the house of God some of you know what I'm talking about this morning miserable out of the house of God but if you could ever get it back in the house it began to rejoice and begin to serve God for the same purpose that it was created for in the beginning God you might be miserable this morning come back in the house of God amen come back among the people of god good good serve the purpose you were created for I know the devil puts that old suicide Spirit on people that don't happen around it does yeah say I'm not good for nothing especially around church kids that have left yeah because they were born in the house of God yeah yeah they know what it's like yeah they may not have forever got it on the inside but they've at least felt it yeah and so they're standing there out of place and that old devil gets to talk to him he wants to take them completely out oh yeah oh yeah wants to get him to commit suicide yeah but if you're hearing me this morning hear her if you're watching if you hear me this morning back get back in the house of God yes if I can pull you this morning if I can take my arms without your sons you realize the devil used men to take out the things from the house of God what did God use to put them back in come on he used men the devil wants to use you to take your kids out the devil wants to use you put that on suicide Spirit on somebody but God wants to use you to wrap your arms around them and bring them back in the house of God he wants to use you for that reason I tell you what I don't want to lose one of them I don't want to see one of them I don't know about you I don't care how much they annoy me I don't care what kind of a spirit how many times they bother me I don't want to lose one care if it's a half wit or a no-wit or an intelligent person I don't care if it's a poor person or a rich person if it belongs in the house of God let's keep it in the house of God it [Applause] you can quit let me go to meetings I have not taken anything was preached in the meeting but we sometimes it does US good take our notes and put them aside and just lay in the word and presence for a little while yeah it's good deity over Humanity the devil wants to steal that deity take it away but random said when the debt when the church left off Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost and adopted a bishop to take his place it was a sad day the holy spirit is to be the leader of the church he is sent to confirm the words of Jesus Christ to make the church live as it did live at the beginning see the devil wants to steal the leadership of the Holy Ghost because that's how the family is supposed to be led the church is led by the pastor under the Holy Ghost if the pastor is not full of the Holy Ghost the church is not being led by the Holy Ghost you realize that the church is under the leadership is left that's why it's so important to have Holy Ghost filled Men First and then see if they can preach if they can sing if they can right right Holy Ghost filled men because that's how God leads the churches by the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is the leader of the church or the pastor the holy spirit is the leader of the family through the father if the father's not there through the mother you understand the Holy Ghost is the leader of the church and Satan wants to strip that away from you oh God so make you cold indifferent backslidden now he's not just working on you now he knows he can't completely destroy you because that gold soaked in yeah yeah right it got hot and it soaked in but he wants to keep these others from having that same experience so what does he do he makes you cold he makes you formal he makes you leaderless yeah makes you drift from place to place no no anything about where what position you belong in and the and I'm not talking just about your position in church but in the body of Christ sitting in Heavenly places in Christ he makes you not understand where you're at he wants to strip the deity off the wood but the man said that's the reason that all this here's snarling and fussing and backbiting and biting back and carrying on around the church he said that's what breaks up the church oh God that shows that the devil got into you and that shows the Holy Ghost left you yeah yeah he said now there's only one thing to do get that thing out of there and the dove will come back to your heart when the dove went out of the Ark she was turned out but she come back and knocked at that art door until Noah let her in yes he said the Holy Ghost is here the Holy Ghost wants to come in do you believe that this morning he said that's the reason today the Holy Spirit he hasn't gone from you forever listen to me church he has not gone from you forever I know you've gotten cold I know some of us get go I get cold too sometimes I get formal too but I find when I get back down on my knees and get where I need to be in God he's always there to meet me he's knocking on my door all the time yeah hey man she was turned out she'd come back and knock to that art door until Noah let her in the Holy Ghost is here the Holy Ghost wants to come in that's the reason today is the holy spirit he hasn't gone from you forever it's just sitting out there on the limbs of the trees somewhere ready to fly itself back to coming to you and give you love and peace and joy like you used to have sure it is he's ready to do it he wants to do it he's longing to do it but here's the key you won't let him do it now why don't you let him do it he said as long as that lamb nature leaves you then the Holy Ghost is gone and brother random deals with they say but brother Brandon you I got the Holy Ghost I know I felt him I was there he said it was the Holy Ghost and he hasn't left you completely right but he's flown off into the attic yeah flown up into the cable into the house of your soul the influence is gone the value if he can't completely destroy you thou your sons those demons huh that come in the world today those demons that were You released from the Euphrates River demons the demon children of that Jezebel spirit want to come in and affect and take away all the effects of the Holy Spirit off of your life he said that's the reason people is in the condition they are he says because they let the wrong Spirit come into their heart into their life he said the Bible said that's the reason there's so many sick and Afflicted Among Us it's because of such things we must be gentle we must be peaceful we must be a lamb so that the dove can abide with us he said but you see the reason he couldn't abide he said he was a lamb then but when you become a wolf he had to take his flight he said nothing wrong with the dove it's you let that Spirit come to you I told you I was going to preach this morning so we're just going to plow deep and then I'll quit he said did I let it brother Branham yes he said when you went to listen to that gossip oh God help us today when you listen to that lie when you went to saying well I've got a right too I don't care if you're a preacher or a teacher or if you're or if you're a musician or if you're just a church member whatever it is that you are if you're a prayer Warrior God the Satan wants you just as bad maybe worse than anybody else and he'll try to pull you out of the house and how is he going to do that gossiping backbiting fussing fighting I don't want to get too personal but I've been amazed lately because you know I've been going going to a lot of means that I haven't been preaching because but I preached myself under conviction I said I can't preach that you love one another and go to all the meetings go do all this stuff unless I do it right so I've been going and as I've been going I've won common theme and sometimes I won't hear from somebody I'll go somewhere I'll hear from somebody for weeks somebody will text me somebody will call me brother Ben it still amazes us that you would come and I'm sitting there thinking have we gone so far yeah have we gotten so cold yeah that doing the things we're supposed to do surprises people yeah oh where are we at church I'm not preaching to everybody out there I'm preaching to us yeah and I want to say I appreciate your love that you show to visitors when they come here and the fact that you win many of you went on Wednesday I appreciate that some of you I know couldn't go I understand that I I realized how hard that is how difficult that is but when we have the opportunity to love somebody I don't care if it's not a church member you say well you love message people yes but what about people on the street people after your job people down at the at the grocery store people people when your car breaks down and then you have to get it fixed that's always a trying time but you got to love those people too and if you'll just display normal Christian love if you'll just say just play normal brotherly kindness you'll be surprised how it overwhelms people because people don't see that do they but they gave they don't see that at school they don't see that at the grocery store but Robert they don't see it everywhere yeah all right and if you just display it in a in a normal Christian way they don't see it in every message church right I'm not trying to make us different because listen we could we could be in the same place we need to pull back to the fire yes yes let's be hard yeah the turtle that'll be hot yes our love be hot if our love is hot for God it'll be hot for one another I know that sounds bad but just be quiet let me go on now let me continue it ought to be hot I'm gonna double down here that's a bad idea isn't it our love ought to be hot for one another ought to be warmth in our hearts for the lowest member of the body he said brother Ben you fail in that I'm there's gold here but it's wood inside that's true there's gold on the inside but there's wood between the gold yeah yeah there's gold on the outside the atonement covering me there's gold on the inside the Holy Spirit but in between that is humanity and when I fail it's because of the wood but when I when I reach out when I when I when I when I pull to the people of God when I when I cry out in love and peace and long suffering when I'm preaching the word of God what is it it's the gold displaying itself we want to get where we're not noticed what do you think was noticed in the temple it wasn't the wood yeah looking around some people say well it's wonderful all these Cedars of Lebanon wonderful it's all overlaid with gold oh God we don't want to be seen well Christ to be seen now I want to I want to move on well we'll read the rest of this you just give me a few more minutes I got a few more minutes did I let it say when you went to listening to that he said well I've got to write you haven't got no right you're bought with a price yeah that was the price of the Precious Blood of the Son of God you have gold on you you have no legal rights the only rights you have is come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein when Sinners plunged beneath the blood the flood lose all their guilty staying I preached a sermon I preached part of it here I preached it somewhere else the lamb has rights we want to defend the rights of the Lamb you talk about our own rights we want to defend the rights of the Lamb yes how do we repair the house we want to know that this morning in the last few minutes but then I look around I see breaches in the house of God I see hardness I see trouble I look around here I see things that shouldn't be there or things that should be there that aren't and I wonder did I replace that golden altar with some kind of man's creation of a feel-good kind of thing did I replace that innocence with something God didn't want there how do we repair the house of God where the Holy Spirit would feel welcome once again how do we repair our families second chronicles 24 4 it came to pass after this first thing Joyce said joash was minded yeah you have to want to Apprentice would stir up a desire in our hearts Lord I want to have that gold where it ought to be I want to have those vessels where they're supposed to be good Joy I looked around the house with the Lord and God put something on his heart said I want to see it right yes I want to see the people loving each other I want to see I'm not just looking at this church but looking at the message of the hour look at my among us we fight and we fuss and we back by I want to see it right yeah yeah and I realize we'll always be human we will not we will not gain a Utopia on this Earth we can't do it yes but we can reach out in love we can when we're reviled we don't have to revile again joash was minded to repair the house of the Lord what's the second thing he did he held leadership accountable yeah in second chronicles 24 and 5 he gathered together the priests and the Levites and said to them go out unto the cities of Judah and gather all of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year see that you hasten the matter do it quickly he said do it quickly and but you know these are the same priests that haven't been watching while they literally bankrupted the house of God so they didn't notice yeah oh God oh God help us we get so used to the world the way it is yeah when we could have life so much better yeah your marriage could be so much better my marriage our our home all of us it can be so much better if we just stay with the word but they wasted and in Kings it tells us they wasted 23 years yeah yeah and finally King joash said it this is enough I'm gonna hold them accountable and the king called for Jedediah the chief and said to him last thou not required of the Levites because he was the the one in charge like the pastor there the high priest he said why is thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem The Collection according to the Commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord another congregation of Israel for the Tabernacle of witness well the truth was they were going out and living off of all of it instead of living off the tithing they were going out and again I'm not talking about money this morning but it's emblematic of how we treat the things of God yes see there's were put they were given these things in trust we're not giving joy and peace and and all these things just so we can use them ourselves yeah yeah but so that we can be what God wants us to be for somebody else the temple was there for service so God could dwell in it now watch he they they they they said why have you not done this and he said why have now not required to Levites to bring out of Judah and out of Jerusalem The Collection now watch according to the Commandment of Moses the servant of the Lord and of the congregation of Israel for the Tabernacle of witness so joash goes all the way back to the law and he said there's a law that said this is how it was supposed to be done why are you not doing it and I would hold us accountable today I say us as Ministry why would there be no gifts in the church why would there be no no praise in the church why would there be no Holy Spirit in the Church of God why would there be no no power in the Church of God why would there be no preachers in some Churches why would there be are you with me now why would they not be there they belong in the house of God how do you know brother being God put them there foreign ERS he never sent Bishops Cardinals priests popes he sent the Holy Ghost for the church to lead the church when he the Holy Ghost has come he will lead you into altruists reveal these things to you that I have told you bring them to your remembrance we'll show you things to come that's what we've come from he said the Holy Spirit wants to do that that's what that early church was we have a responsibility to hold the leadership accountable bring us back to that yeah amen it's good preaching buddy honestly it should be you pushing me for Revival yeah yeah but Ben when can we have church you hear me number two you have to get back to God's way of doing things God had a way second chronicles 24 and 8 at the king's commandment they made a chest and said it without at the Gate of the house of the Lord they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring into the Lord The Collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness let's get back to running the church like we were taught yeah brother Branham said the church is to be operated by nine spiritual gifts by the Holy Spirit he has gifts signs and wonders in the church that's God's provided way of perfecting his church now we're not talking about sinless perfection he explained that that's by the blood of Jesus Christ we're talking about maturity let's ask God's Divine Way of perfecting his church we try anything else we try anything else theology teaching yeah yeah anything else it'll never work it never did and it never will that's right he said we've got to come back to God's way now again teaching has a place but not without the spirit of God right we've got to come back to God's way God has a way to support a church not making blankets having soup suppers but every man paying his tithes and offerings into the church doing the way God said do that's God's provided way for that he said God's got to provide a way for a man to come into the church today we bring a men into the church to give him a letter bring him into the church the right hand of Fellowship sprinkle a little salt shaker full of water on top of his head bring him into the church that's not what God Said God's got a different way from that to bring the people into his church by one Spirit we're baptized into one body by the Holy Spirit how many believe that this morning hey man I'm almost done did God's provide a way bringing men Christians into the Church Believers Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for their mission of your sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the promise unto you and your children to them that's so far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call he said that must continue on as long as the Lord was calling God still promised the Holy Ghost that's God's provided way of coming into the church yeah now he used we use money as an example of that because a church this size couldn't do what we do operating under denominational headship it'd have to be partially supported and funded by a headquarter somewhere right but the reason why church this size a number can operate the way that we do is because the people of God have a heart to do what God Said and bring bringing the tithes into the storehouse bring the offering the storehouse I'm commending you for that by the way I'm commending you for that that's why it can operate the way it's supposed to thank God for that but there's other things that God put in the church that are the same way if we're doing the way God said they'll be right they'll be fruitful and must continue on brother bear said there's five offices elected of God God is set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists God did that yeah come on yeah he said well that little gold palm trees I don't mean nothing I'll just take that and spend it the money God did it that little that little Ultra event since it don't mean nothing I'll just take that out put it in the house of bail God did it he said God always uses men for his work he said is that right he don't use organizations or Mechanical Devices he uses men the Holy Spirit fell upon men that's God's instrument here on the earth that was in 1947 in 1963 he said God won't leave his program that's the reason we know in this day it's got to be simple see now he always works in Simplicity but God in the beginning that could have made the son preach the gospel the winds preached the gospel or an angel preached the gospel but he ordained men for that purpose yeah and he never changes it he never ordained denominations he never ordained groups of men he didn't ordained men to preach the gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any Angelic being it was men it was men let's get back to the old landmarks let's get back to the right way let's get back to what God Said amen let's get back to a man and a woman yeah let's get back to a husband and a wife let's go back to Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 and First Corinthians 11 and First Peter chapter two let's go back to family prayer let's go back to ordering the home let's go back to the house of God let's go back to being there when the doors are open he said it doesn't matter it does matter yes the third part of this that was faithfulness and giving and work I just want to close with this this morning the Bible says in all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end in other words they filled up the chest now in second in verse 11 it says it come to pass at what time the chest was brought into the king's office by the hand of the Levites when they saw that there was much money the kingscribed on the high priest officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance let me leave this with you churches aren't repaired in a day every day some of them widows come back in drop their might in you don't know what that means some of you that pay tiers and I know you don't have the money to give 10 of your income that you're going to cut down on grocery I know that and I do everything I can to help you if you hear that today and we've got to fund here in the church for widows and for things like that if you have a need you have a need you go to us come to us and but I see you pay your tithes and I can't reject that Jesus didn't he said the example that why not because but does it does make me pray for you when I see it because I look at that and I think every day that's what keeps the church going every week every every Sunday every every two weeks here comes a woman drop her a little bit in the chest here comes a man again I'm not preaching about money I think about it every time you come to church you bring something with you yeah you come in every day you come in you bring your musical ability you bring your ability to preach you bring your ability to sing you bring your ability to amen I'm getting down there now you bring your ability to stay awake in church some of you that can't even stay awake in church but you bring your ability to pray yeah yeah and those of you who can't hear and can't speak you can't pray you know get old and it's hard but maybe you have a baby and it's hard to stay in church and hard to be in the house of God is the baby constantly keeps you out and you're caring for the baby but remember what you're doing you're setting an example yeah you're telling the devil what side he's on every time you come in that little oh God that little penny that that wouldn't put the gold on the temple that wouldn't that wouldn't overlay it that little Penny wouldn't do much it wouldn't do much but it inspired somebody with more come on when they saw the example of the one with the penny it inspired someone with more to bring a free will offering God needs all kinds he needs someone's with money and the ones without money but the ones without money sometimes are the ones that Inspire us to come and drop into the house of God the ones without gifts are sometimes the one who inspire me to preach the most you don't have no gift in your quiet in church and you just sit there and say well I don't ever do anything but you inspire me sister Jackie by sitting in the house of God because I know what you've been through I know what some of you sitting here on the back have been through I know the things in your life you inspire me when you come to the house of God you young families inspire me to bring my family to the house of God day by day you come in and you put your family there on the sea what are you doing faithfulness and giving of yourself that's how you rebuild the house and you do that at home faithfulness day by day we don't feel like praying today but we're going to pray God help us I stay so busy sometimes we go and go and go and do but I need to watch my own family I don't say you should make it a legalism although sometimes tradition helps but you don't want it just to be a tradition yeah but don't say you should make it illegally and say well we do this at a certain time but watch your family yeah make sure you're not blinded say brother Ben I can take it maybe you think you can take it yeah but let him that thinketh he stand and take heed yes as default that's right they did it day by day and gathered money in abundance every time the house you come to the house of God you bring a lake of fire your own spiritual currency amen amen it helped me when Stephanie come back to the Lord and see chips sitting back there and they're faithfulness of the house of God they brought a lick of fire into the church didn't they I see amen I see brother Bill Poole come to the house of God and I pastored him many years ago but the bill come to the house of God his wife was sick for many years and unable to come but he's here with us now and become faithful but the bill that means something to me that's faithfulness to the house of God I could I could speak to each one of you today I don't have time but you understand every one of you I see you coming and you get married and you you'll come back to the house of God praise God for that you get married you still come to church you you lose someone you still come to church you have trouble but you still come to church it inspires me to see you come yeah it inspires me sister Betty to see you sitting there on Sunday you may not realize it but it inspires me because it means something to be in the house of God and to see your son come with you bring you to church it inspires me I think it inspires more than me churches aren't repaired in a day but every time you come you bring your portion of God brother Brown said he works through you and I as portions of God he said that's why the Holy Spirit when it come on the day of Pentecost it broke all up that Pillar of Fire and divided itself in licks of tongues and set upon each one he said we have to have one another oh God can I say it can I say it for the people in the back for the people on the front for the people behind the pulpit listen we have to have one another oh my second chronicles 24 and 12 and the king in jail diah gave it such as gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the Lord and hired Masons and Carpenters to repair the house of the Lord and also such as wrought iron and Brass to men the house of the Lord so the workmen rot and the work was perfected by them what was it faithfulness in giving faithfulness and working and they set the house of God in his State and strengthened it and they didn't complain about it they had an eternal reward oh my their name would be associated with it all through eternity I don't want to complain about being a pastor I don't want to spend all my time whining and moaning and groaning about what how hard it is to be a pastor I understand it's hard but I'm happy to do the work because we're repairing God's house I'm not just talking about us I'm talking about God's house amen they were yielding themselves to do the work they were born to do I already had those gifts but now they yielded themselves Hallelujah it's manifesting himself to us in human flesh our flesh of the Holy Spirit as we can yield to that Holy Spirit musicians go ahead and come he said now there's the thing knowing how to yield yourself and some people are set in the church some can yield themselves to preaching some can yield themselves easily to teaching some can yield themselves to prophesying some can yield themselves to other gifts so all the gifts won't be alike excuse me there wasn't a like then Paul said they wasn't but each man is called and placed into the church for a purpose every one of you have a purpose yes and if you'll find out what God can use him best at and healed himself to that place he will be success yeah yeah oh God I've been wondered I've been wondering I I pray Lord how can I be a success as a pastor I don't even know what that means does it make sense if being success the pastor is numbers then TD Jakes has got us all beat and just use a common name if that's what success is then I want it but but that's not necessarily what God looks at as success but if I can instead of chasing the goals the success if I can just yield myself to my place yes I will be a success say God thank you for that can you see that in your own life you can yield yourself to being a real husband you will be a success yeah if you yield yourself to being a real life you'll be a success if you yield yourself to being a real you said but I've had so many struggles in my life but maybe that success in the eyes of God oh God you and I have been tasked with keeping God's house in repair so that our children yeah we'll have a home come back too yeah I want you to take a look around as they play something Softly I want you to take a look around this morning with every head bowed and every eye closed if my prodigal came back would they remember the house did they slide back into that spot or are so many other things missing but they wouldn't even recognize it as a house of God [Music] my prodigal came home what's missing from the tip I want you to take a good look around look first at your own life it's missing [Music] we'll spend all my time and the things of the world do I take time I know it's hard church I know sometimes you you say well I just deserve to have some rest and you do you you need rest you need to sometimes you have to take your mind off of things but even in that we ought to give our praise and glory to God and not just spend it wasting our time on the things of the world oh God help me today even if I'm with my family having a good day all right I want to be a success in that I want you to be in it Lord your head's about and your eyes are closed I I gotta a message from South Korea the other day and brother Michael Nutter who some of you know uh brother young man brother Philip was there in station the Army went to his church for a while and my daughter was the other night we didn't want to take her because the devil fought Us in this because they put practices for the intramural basketball at Highland they put them I'm saying this for a reason they put them on Wednesdays and Sundays we say we can't do that she said well they'll let us practice the first one was on Thursday so they let me practice one time I can I can go to a game I said okay so she went and they let her play with the other children and what she was playing with the other children she had a skirt on that was below her knees but it was just an athletic skirt and then she had something under it where it wouldn't fly up and she's running with a skirt on I took some pictures and posted I didn't think nothing about it was funny to me because well I tell you what third grade girls basketball is bad it's awful to watch but I set through that basketball game and I got a message a couple days later from South Korea for brother Michael Nutter he said brother Ben I wanted to tell you I've I've got some people in my church have been discouraged some others whose children whose girls grew up and went out in the world and don't dress like we dress anymore and they're in South Korea they're all alone there's almost no churches with this message and he said I I was he said I was trying to tell him God still has young women God still has girls that dress right he said I saw your daughter in the basketball game he said I saw the way she was dressed he said I want to thank you for sharing that with us he said because it encouraged the lady in South Korea that God still has some young ladies God want you to look around the house today the every decision that you make remember somebody's watching somebody's looking maybe you could be an encouragement to somebody across the ocean maybe an encouragement to somebody next door I told you over the last few weeks we've we've physically we're tired because we've been to all these different meetings and trying to reciprocate for them coming to ours and I I get so tired and I think well I just won't go but then I end up going anyway and I I ended up going last night the young lady come up to me and she said brother Ben I I'm from this area she said I know the way it is she said I just there's something in my heart she said I can't I want to tell say thank you for showing up I didn't do nothing I just showed up but it showed love to people can you can you just look around your house today and say I wanted to be repaired I want the love to be there and what is it that I how can I display that deity in my life maybe the little things well you just slip your hand up to him if that's you today if it's not if it's all good if you've taken a good look around and everything's fine
