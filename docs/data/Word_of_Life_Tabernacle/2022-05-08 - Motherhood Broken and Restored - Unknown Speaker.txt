favor with the people that they might lord take the word and not just see it as the words of a man but that's the word of god or not because i would say it but because it comes from the scripture lord in a spoken lord by a prophet i pray that you grant that today and i pray that you'd help us lord to lord didn't want what you want for our lives so lord to come and and just change us from the inside out may we leave here differently than when we came in lord i pray that you bless our mothers here today lord those that are have come to honor their mothers i pray that you give them a special blessing for that today we thank you for them we pray god that you'd move in a mighty way in this service today we ask it in jesus name amen amen you love the lord this morning yes amen it's always good to be in the house of the lord and to know that that he is our god isaiah chapter 49 verses 14 through 16. i'd like to speak to you this morning on motherhood broken and restored it's good to see all of you out today and well we've got several missing gone to visit their their mothers but we've got a bunch here as well my the curtis family turned out for sister karen didn't they god bless you this morning we're so glad to have you and different ones the white camp some of you all are here with us this morning and and brother malachi good to see you again this morning and uh it's always good to be in the house of the lord but especially when you get to be there with your mother and my mother is here today and we give her a special honor today and and one of the things i always wanted in my life was to be able to uh preach where my family was and especially your mother uh you there's just a special support there that you don't get from anyone else and so we appreciate that today isaiah chapter 49 and verse 14 but zion said lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me and so he poses a question he said can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget will i not forget thee what a promise that is yes behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands my walls are continually before me i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated one of the strongest impulses in the world even in the animal kingdom is a maternal instinct there's a god-given instinct especially with us human beings they're made in the image of god it's part of what was separated from adam in the garden of eden it's why men and women one of the reasons why men and women are so different is because every woman i believe has an instinct within her to be a mother and even though maybe life would would work in different ways for different people and some maybe even unable to have children and yet there's a there's an instinct there to to be a mother to care for something and and even in in the hebrew the word uh compassion if you look at that in the hebrew it actually come from the root word of womb and and the reason for that is because there's no greater compassion than what a mother feels for the for the children that she has birthed into the world and so isaiah uh he asked this question he said can a mother forget her child can a mother forget and i think we've got good moms here today i think that you would never forget your children and you might from time to time because you're human have a little spat or something with your children but you'd never forget them you would never purposely put them out of your mind which is what this word means that it's the act of removing one's knowledge from the forefront of one's mind intentionally or unintentionally you wouldn't do that you you love your children and yet it's possible for mothers for people who have children if we could say it that way that that maybe that maternal instinct is there but the devil gets into it and he begins to work against that begins to pervert womanhood and motherhood until a woman might forget her child and yet god said i'll never forget you i i your name's engraved on the palms of my hands and i'm so glad we have a god like that yes so now here it's possible for a woman a mother though she's born with that mothering instinct to forget to forget her own children and that mothering instinct is so strong if you watch little watching my little niece last night she had a she had a little baby doll and she's mothering that little baby and she's not even two years old i believe and she's mother and that baby there's something about it you know us men when a baby's born we don't hardly know how to hold them but there's something about a little girl that she knows how to do that there's just something born in her that she knows how to take care of children she knows i believe that's why mothers generally not always but generally cook better than than dads do it's because they they have a care for it they're they're interested in it my mother loves to cook but i think most of all my mother loved her children and so because she loves her children that causes her to want to feed him and that's why your mom when you go home you know and you come into mom's house and and she always asks you have you had anything to eat and are you hungry and she's just constantly there trying to feed you trying to give you something to drink why do moms do that it's that it's that instinct to be a mother to care to have compassion and that come from god and i want to make that clear this morning that's not something that society as they would say today well it's just an expectation that society has no it's an instinct to come from god yes sir god placed that in a mother that she would be able to do that and want to do that and and we honor that today and yet again it is possible for a mother to forget her baby i guess the most stark example of that would be abortion where since the i know it's been in the news lately that roe versus wade the court case before the supreme court that allowed legal abortion since that time more than 60 million babies have been aborted in this country 60 million that their mothers chose not to have them and so a mother can forget her baby and you can't even it's incomprehensible to some of us to think how could that be and i look not just at that but how children are raised anymore and i look at it and think how could you have a child and leave it in that condition and it's dirty and it's hungry if you've ever worked i know some that work in the school systems they know there's children that are left out in the cold practically and they send them to school and they don't have nothing to eat and they're have parents that don't care about them and they get into all kinds of things my children tell me stories about the children that they associate with the school and how that their parents don't care what kind of movies they watch or they don't care what kind of television they watch they don't care what they do on their phones they don't care what they do in any other area of their life and so the child is just left to fend for themselves and even so far as to actively work against it i've told you before but melody told me a story about a girl in her class that she was talking to her about the lord and witnessing his children will to one another and and she said the little girl told her said well my family had a bible she said i got a bible one time from school they send them they put them in backpacks that they give to children and she said i got a bible and brought it home and said my parents found me with it and told me to get rid of it you can imagine what kind of a mother would do that what kind of a father would do that yeah and i know it's a little bit heavy this morning but i want to bring it around i'm building towards a positive spiritual application this morning but you know even reversing roe versus wade and making it making it where the states could decide whether it was legal or illegal to have abortions that wouldn't stop abortion right it would continue on and even in brother branagh's time he said there were more than 30 000 a week in chicago before it was ever legal years before and but now you see that they're wanting to make it legal and and you have the strange spectacle of women who could be mothers protesting for the right to continue murdering their children what kind of an age do we live in if god would not would not forgive sodom and gomorrah for what they did how could he ever forgive this nation and i would say that this nation is gone it's been invaded by the devil by demonic thought but thank god for a bride that's on the earth today thank god for the people of god that still have that that reality of a mother instinct of a father instinct in their lives that they can still act according to the word they're still a people on the earth aren't you glad for that today but people would protest for the ride i know that's heavy to hear on mother's day but it ought to make you even more thankful for a godly mother that there would be some who would who would actively work for the right to kill their babies and and the bible says woe unto them they call evil good and good evil make it legal say well it doesn't matter if it's legal or not it does matter those that call evil good and good evil to put darkness for light and light for darkness put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter they value the wrong things yes and yet abortion is not the only sign that motherhood is broken today motherhood is more than having children all of you mothers could say amen to that this morning it's more than just having a child but it's raising a child and i know a few of you perhaps have been adopted and and you were adopted into a family where you had a mother but it wasn't your birth mother but it was someone who raised you and that's mother to you that's mom because she raised you and and she brought you up we're given the example uh of moses in the scriptures that when he was a little boy it was his mother who gave him his instruction it was a godly mother who took little moses on her knees and and said moses and taught him all and she said now these things moses someday you're going to deliver the children of israel you're the boy that's called i think that's important for us to put that before our children you're a child of god you're different from the world and you know they may go out and they may leave and they may they may go out in the world and do all kinds of things but they'll always have that in their heart because mother placed that in them and said you're special yes you're called for something special you're not like everybody else you're the one god called amen to be his child and we get that many times from our mother when we're little and so she told moses you're the boy that's called keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you're the one no other place where we know where he ever went to any seminary any teaching at all he ever got he stayed right in pharaoh's palace which was the heathen but his mother taught him i think if there were more mothers that taught their children today we wouldn't have to worry so much about the public schools i realized the public schools are bad but my kids have went to public school all of their life i guess but they had a mom at home and whatever you do whether you homeschool or send them to public school make sure you teach them on on your knee amen when they're little his mother taught him he said that's a real mother she taught him the precepts of the lord she told him how he must be holy she told him how and what he must live and what god must do would do for him and it stuck with moses all the days of his life and any good true law mother that'll take her little babies instead of sending them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the lord jesus christ i'm so glad i had a mother like that and if you did i'm sure you could say amen to that today it makes a difference in your life and yet there's other kinds of mothers there was a mother in the scripture named herodias who had a daughter and we know the story how the john baptist was there in the prison and and she was she hated it because he told her he spoke the truth he spoke the word that it's not lawful for for you to be married to herod and he spoke that to the king and the king put him in jail but the king was afraid to kill him and she wanted him dead and so she went to her daughter and she taught her daughter to dance so that she would gain the favor of men her young daughter was taught to dance in such a way so that the king she would gain the favor of the king and then when she did that she instructed her daughter the bible says she being before instructed of her mother when the king asked you what do you want i want john babbed his head in a charger or on a platter what kind of a mother would use and manipulate her daughter i know it's a little bit heavy this morning but we'll get past it in a minute but would use to manipulate her daughter to actually put her out there before men so that she could she could try to satisfy whatever bitterness she had towards the preacher you could say it that way and try to do away with her but you know i'm so glad that we have christian mamas that won't do that that will refuse to do that but random told us that there were 70 offspring of this woman of herodias who were either prostitutes or on the gallows that we found in history her family fell apart because she was the mother that taught hers the things of the world but the writer said one mother taught hers the things of the world the other mother taught hers the things of god one become a great leader and a conqueror is immortal among men today speaking of moses the other is debauched and in hell and taken thousands times thousands with her and i would say today is as again we're moving towards something today but just to lay a foundation here to show you that motherhood is broken we see that every day we see it every day i see mothers who their children will tell them no and they'll just let them do whatever they want to you don't care about the child i see them where they'll go to the store and buy and i always wonder as we pick up our kids every day from school and i look at the children the way that they're dressed i think did mamas really dress their children like that are you with me this morning i don't mean to be to be rude on a mother's day but but i look at it and think did you really dress your little girls one thing for a grown woman she has a choice how she wants to dress she can buy her own clothes but here's your little daughter 8 9 10 years old and you've dressed her in such a way that that you have to turn your head to look at her that's a mother putting her daughter out in front of men teaching them to sin god help us that we would never do that and i noticed that some of the same women who protest abortion would train their daughters to dress before men in such a way that they'll be before they get married they'll end up in a relationship living together and have no expectation of getting married no expectation have kids with one and then move on to another and train their daughters in that way and yet protest against abortion some of the same women i have a problem with that being a mother is not just raising not just having a child but it's raising a child but what's happened is and the people are blinded they don't mean to be that way i'm convinced many people they don't they just don't see it because the word of god is not open to the people they they just don't see what's going on and so they don't they don't mean to do that necessarily but they look at it it's just the way the culture is why because the united states and i believe the entire world but here in the united states we've been invaded yes that's right and brother branham preached that in a sermon called the invasion of the usa on mother's day in 1954 and he said this he said he set up his headquarters over here in hollywood the devil landed a few years ago 15 or 20 years ago went hid in hollywood california and he has invaded the united states with his demon powers he said all our fashions come from paris they get it in hollywood onto the screens these little girls and little boys and things get out here they watch them scream place nice little kid he's fine little fellas nothing against them god bless their little hearts he said my heart bleeds for them and right here in the city i was talking to my boy the other day he said daddy if there was just some boys around there in town that had the holy ghost he said and so forth you wonder why i was getting away to denver colorado or something like that he was going to take a trip and get away from jeffersonville he said i get my children somewhere where there's a bunch of people who cry out to god oh i want to have a place like that where the kids can go to somewhere where there's a bunch of people who cry out to god in spite of the nation that's been invaded by the devil let us be somewhere let's be a safe place listen moms and dads make your home a safe place make your home a safe place for your children for your grandchildren a place that has not been invaded they may have invaded hollywood they may have invaded new york they may have invaded hardy arkansas but they've not invaded my home because my home has the token on the door when the death angel come into the land what did they do they put the token on the door and you and i are to have the token on display today are you with me this morning the token on display where the people can come in where our families can come in and there's a place where people cry out to god for what we need he said the political world is gone don't look for politics for your salvation it's never going to happen or you might have one that would be better than another one you could vote for over another sure there might be some who are for godly principles biblical principles some who are not but yet it'll never be the salvation of this nation it's going to keep getting worse and the conservatives will get more liberal and the liberal will get more liberal and it'll keep getting worse and worse it never gets better does it it never turns back the other way why the invasion has come in the invasion many years ago decades ago the invasion come into the usa and it's taken over it's taken over and there was nothing the people would would not state on the word that were not in revival so that they would recognize it and defeat it and so they fall into it so now he said the political world is gone our nation is broke and i don't think he just meant financially but the nation is broke morally and we see that today the nation is broken it's broken it's beyond it's just the people don't even think morally anymore don't even think appropriately and even you see what people wear what people do what they what they allow their children to do and you look at it and it just makes you shake your head because you think it's broken they don't have any sense of what's right and wrong but oh god that we'd have a generation of people today of people that could hear the word of the lord and say that's what i want not because somebody's making me do it it's not because i'm part of some cult somewhere it makes me dress a certain way but because the word of god is still true amen and what he said is still right yes but this nation is broke it's broke he said you remember that brother branham said that thus saith the lord he said our nation is debolish he puts two words together demolished and abolished i think it's a good word it's demolished it'll never rise she is gone like all the rest of the nations it's the greatest nation in the world standing today the best of a bad law you'll find that out if you go overseas still you travel very much you'll find out this is the best nation you can't wait to get back to it and yet the very seed of the devil has been planted in the hearts of the people it's the greatest nation but also the most ungodly yes think about it we're democracy and we're where we have freedom of religion and ability to come and preach and i'm so thankful for that but also where the the seeds of hollywood and the seeds of the devil is coming to hollywood and into the people and to the point where people don't even know right from wrong they have no clue they can be persuaded by any demagogue that comes along to just follow whatever they say because they don't have any any standard they don't have any any kind of an anchor but i'm so glad we have an anchor today i'm so glad we have an anchor that keeps us still in a world that's full of chaos yes brother branham said how it got in the people and begin to this you can't tell them nothing she's gone she's invaded and the spirit of communism has took over everybody said well we don't want to be communists we don't want to vote for for that party because they're communist but the spirit of communism took over years ago what is that a spirit of anarchy a spirit a spirit that does not believe in god and they got a little social gospel standing there but the brown talked about the schools and the different things that went on there and the horrible things he said they got a little social gospel standing there where preachers stand and talk about little petty things i'm so glad we don't just stand and talk about petty things they make you feel good but we don't do that we deal with reality today we deal with reality we're dealing with the hearts of men and women who try to make you come to a place of repentance listen or to draw you to come to a place of repentance he said preachers stand and talk about little petty things little bitty stories of the bible or something like that instead of preaching repentance and bringing men and women to the altar i believe we still need that today yes sir and just as an example you know if we look at the way people dress and allow their children to dress and brother branham had to deal with that we always have to deal with that in the next generation even among our girls and i've got two girls and i have to deal with this as well but the random had two girls at home becky and sarah at this time he said i'm i'm certainly against some little old skin type dresses he said i constantly fuss at my kids becky and sarah i don't care how little they are i just fuss at them all the time why would you fuss with a little child over over a dress that was too tight or too short well the reason why when these were not little bitty children talking about toddlers they were nearly teenagers or teenagers at that time but the reason why you would fuss at children for that is because what you teach them is what they'll do right and what you teach them to wear is what they'll wear right so he said media takes becky apart every day about it dresses plum up and and you go look through the message and and you think about it whenever uh and you know and a woman knows because when you sit down and you can't cover your knees and the dress won't cover your knees you start pulling it down you feel self-conscious because men notice it boy i want to get myself in trouble today but men notice that when it's above the knees it's just the truth of it and you always have to pull on it and so we teach our children our girls don't don't wear skirts like that you can just wear them a little bit longer so you can so you could be able to not have to do that where i'm a little bit looser and that you can be pretty you don't have to be some aunt or old woman out there somewhere and that looks like you come out of the 1940s and out of out of the backwoods of hardy somewhere you don't have to look like that but you can look like a decent godly girl you know what i found out my girls when they went to school that the other girls especially when they were younger wanted to be like them they they would always come to them and the girls and whenever my girls went to school there were other girls that would start wearing dresses not many but a few of them would want to wear dresses because my girls wore dresses and they thought how pretty that was they weren't old enough to have been cankered by the world that we live in today but they should be taught to look like girls i'm just using that as an example because motherhood is broken and it's broken womanhood and it's broken down to the children until little bitty girls and growing up even around the church if you say anything about it you're you're evil but the bible had a lot to say about it but look some people just never been taught and that's our responsibility but brother brown said kids you can expect that in kids and you have to correct them but when it comes to a woman there's something wrong there and so we should look at that and say what does the word teach me and that's not my job to tell you how long it should be or or whether you should have sleeves or not look to the word and get the holy ghost all right and that will be taken care of i'm moving through this we'll be done with this part in a minute motherhood is broken boys that's why boys look like they do and it's broken to the point where it don't even it's beyond that you know we deal with that in church but what they're dealing with in the world is is my child a boy or a girl well i don't know till they tell me yeah that's my job as a parent is to determine what my child and and and to to place him in the right path the worst possible thing i could do for them is let them make their own decisions when they're five about what their gender is it's cruelty it's cruelty and yet most girls have that maternal instinct most boys will have the paternal instinct but you know what changes them what makes them want to be all changing a boy into a girl and a girl into a boy it's the culture that we live in and they can say what they want to oh we're not going to we're going to let them decide actors and actresses today we're going to let them decide what they're going to be well you know what's deciding for them tv is hollywood is the school is right that's right let's let's let our boys be boys so it's not just the girls but boys should be taught to look like boys and girls should be taught to look like girls but we don't do that because it's broken motherhood is broken and brother branham said that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood you broke the nation right then now i want to move this away and talk about spiritual motherhood for a moment spiritual motherhood is broken it's okay if i take this off i'm sweating like a pig up here today maybe because i'm about as big as one i can joke about myself it's okay and you can laugh you won't hurt my feelings a bit now look something about this time of year it's just humid hot now look i can't imagine we're we're planning on going uh on a mission trip this year to a place that's that's a desert and in the middle of the summer what in the world am i doing i can't handle the heat but let's look at spiritual motherhood for a moment because as a church we're typed as a mother in revelation 17 5 you find a great church and upon her forehead and you can go read the rest of the chapter later and it'll kind of place what she is and it's it was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlot so she's a mother she's identified as a mother but she's the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth and she is a church she sits on seven hills she's a church and so spiritual motherhood if we can say it that way is broken because again like i said you know it's not just to have children but to care for those children right to have children and then to care for those children now what are we doing as a church we're called to birth the word or to have a birth of the word in our lives and to care for that to to graze it up to to have the word in its proper place in our lives just like mary now think about it for a moment when mary had jesus she was not called just to just to be a surrogate mother that would come in and have the baby we focus on that a lot how that she was there in the manger at christmas time we look at that but she didn't just have the baby in the manger and leave him there and he wasn't so much god now listen to me i love how god come to the earth come down on our level he wasn't so much god that he didn't need a mother right and i mean in the natural sense but he's so he so lowered himself that he come down god manifested himself in flesh come down become a germ in the womb of mary and then when he was growing into a baby he actually was born and when he was born he needed his mother he was completely dependent on his mother and to her which she was a type of the church today she was responsible for keeping him alive now that's a great responsibility you think about your children and how you were responsible but you don't know who they're going to be you think about that that child they might turn out to be god forbid be in prison somewhere god forbid that they would but they might also turn out to be president of the united states you don't know they might also turn out to be a preacher which someone told me the other day that's a higher office than president of the u.s and i'll say that it is maybe not mine so much as these other brothers but but but there is a something that could turn out to be a helper a deacon a mother a godly mother they could turn out to be a great person right and you don't know and so you're given this child and you have to nurture them and care for them and mary was given the word now think about it from it she was given the word and then she had to let it grow and she had to watch it and it played in front of her and she watched it so it didn't run off in the woods right yeah so he didn't run off in the woods and get hurt and she she nursed his wounds he was a man right she took care of him she put band-aids on his owies right just like you do just like your mothers do she was taking care of the word and as a church i hope we understand the spiritual application as we turn this today now towards the end of it as we begin to look at the church and our responsibility what responsibility do we have we have the word yes it's been placed in our care other people don't care about it yes there's many others that don't care about it but as for the malka as the word we've been we it's been placed into our care and we've got to have that instinct as a church to mother it to take care of it to keep it pure i'm sure she made sure that jesus played with the right kind of kids she made sure that he went in the right places and he didn't get caught up in the wrong place you understand he never sinned right he was god in flesh i'm sure he was a good kid but he was human flesh and she made sure that jesus went to the right places and i'm sure there were times she cried and she prayed there was a time she even lost him you remember she lost him and she left him in jerusalem because sometimes good mothers make mistakes it's okay but always come back to the word where do you go back to it at the place where you left it yes good mothers make mistakes many times but that doesn't mean they're not a mother and she made a mistake she left him she wasn't watching him like she should have been he was 12 years old and she found him at the temple because he was the word oh as a church we need to keep our eyes on the word i don't know what another church is doing not what the world's doing let's keep our eye on the word we have a responsibility amen but this this roman church this mystery babylon that set on seven hills they didn't do that they got their eyes on other lovers and couldn't be a mother to children of god but become a mother of denominations and unbiblical doctrines that come out of the bottomless pit brother branham speaking of how womanhood and motherhood is broken and he deals with that in invisible union of the bride of christ he said she characters herself out here with a pair of shorts on skin type men's clothing and things on the street twisting around no matter what she says she might be as virtuous to her husband as she can be but in the sight of god she's an adulteress because the scripture said whosoever looked at the final woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart and she presented herself to be that now think spiritually now he said that's exactly what the church has done with the world yes she presented herself as open today we have seeker sensitive churches open to whatever the people are you just come as you are stay as you are be as you are but that's not the gospel the gospel is come in a center come in hurting come in broken but when you're when you come in you may be a sinner but you won't leave one if you give your life to christ you'll leave redeemed if you when you come in you may be broken but you can leave whole when you come in you may be hurting but you can leave healed that's what the gospel does it doesn't leave you in your condition but it changes you into a better place amen so he said i'm speaking how it can get away when you get to mixing up with the world the church and all the fashions and things that we have and he speaks to the church he said we're no more like the original pentecost was than day is from night we've drifted off somewhere into some dark chaos somewhere and lost what a sacred trust what a responsibility to a woman he said she's a type of the church which has the same responsibility and a woman as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood to her virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer yes amen oh god a sacred responsibility to prayer that's not just a few words now and then over a meal but it's my responsibility if i love him to pray if i want to keep my sacred responsibility my virtues to christ is to pray and to the word that's why we give the word the preeminence in the service right not because it's me talking or one of these other brothers but because our sacred responsibility as a church is to the word and to christ just the same as the woman has and as a woman drifts off with another man oh god when the church goes off in these institutional programs building programs and schools and so forth he said i have nothing against them they're all right they serve their purpose but jesus never said go make schools he said preach the word that's where they neglect it he said not make institutions hospitals and so forth them is all right but that's not the church's duty their duty is to preach the gospel he said but we've done everything else but that yes look in jude 3 it talks about it how that they begin to drift away he said i gave all diligence to write unto you the common salvation it was needful for me to write up to you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the states this was just a few years yes after pentecost they got their eye on somebody else they got their eye on the world and the power that would come with it we don't need to get our eyes on power as preachers we don't need to get our eyes on power as a church we don't need to get our eyes on political power well if we come in and we could rally enough people we could take over the city of hardy whatever that would get you but we don't get our eyes on political power that's not my job it's not my job to get into politics not my job my job is to give attendance to prayer and to preaching the word right your job is to give attendance to prayer and to hearing the word are you with me now because that's what our salvation that's what our our our love for christ everything is based on that those are the things he told us to do that's our sacred trust he said nevertheless i have someone against me in revelation 2 4 speaking of that first age you said you've left your first love very quickly they left and become a roman church with roman ideas amen said you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings well i pray the lord i know it's mother's day but i pray the lord would speak to hearts today you used to love to go to church but you left that love and you begin to kind of slide backwards into formal come in with our father nonsense the fervent desire to please god the passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit all begins to fade instead of that church being on fire with the fire of god has cooled off become a bit formal yes just like it would happen with them with a wife and her husband yes think about it he's made every overture he sent messengers he sent prophets he'd come every way that he could you can't blame him yeah well somebody said that when we were young he said we used to ride together in a truck said we'd ride on the front seat used to be trucks had just a bent seat usually on the front that we'd ride on the front seat together he said and now we ride far apart a woman was telling her husband that kind of complaining about it he said well i didn't move but there's a lot of truth to that god didn't move if our love's not what it used to be if we're not as passionate about the gospel as we used to be if we begin to do things and and wear things and and allow our children to do things that we didn't used to do it hasn't it's not god that changed that's right yes sir right oh god he didn't change we change but if we change if he's still your husband today if he's still if he still has a love for you then you have an ability to love him back you can come back to him he'll take you back amen but the prep said notice what she loves watch your lover you want to see who she is in love with the word says this but my church says this then who is she in love with who is her husband her own fruits prove what she is refuse now look at this spiritual woman now spiritual church refuses to bear children just like the ones we talked about today motherhood is broken they want to do away with the babies abort the babies the median age now for having children i'm not telling you how old you have to be to have children i'm not saying anything about that but the median age now for having children is 30 i believe the median age most children are born now to people in their 30s and 40s because when they're young they want to have time to do what they want to do and go get a career in things and i'll say again nothing wrong with that but i tell you what i'm so proud of some of you young mothers that have started families young and have raised families young and you're proving to the world that it can be done and that there's a job that's more important than the job that you have if you have one there's a job that's more important than than going out to some factory making money or going out to some office and making money but there's a job that you have with your children are you with me now and you're proven to a society that's lost its moral compass that's been invaded by the devil you've proven to them that there's some there's some christian ladies that'll still care for their children but this church refused to bear children for their spiritual husband christ because they're too busy flirting with the things of the world the brown said if a woman won't have a baby for her husband she'll take a dog or a cat or something boy i'm going to get in trouble she's got to my my daughter loves my oldest daughter loves dogs she absolutely loves dogs but but here he said and she got the mother something that she's not old enough to be a mother won't be for probably 20 more years so let's lay that in there as a dad you know she got the mother something that's one thing for a young a young person to want to have a dog or something to want a mother something it's her nature but to do that and to refuse to bear a child for her husband but to bear a child for her husband raise it to the service of god that's entirely out of her line so again not just having the baby but raise it for the service of god he said oh she'd be so disgraced if she did by her sin-loving society of this 1965 how old does that sound think about it that's a long time ago and a prophet looking into the future described our world there's an ethical question you can ask yourself and i want you to think deeply about this an ethical question if your dog who you loved had been with you for years your loyal dog and a random stranger or just a random stranger he could be a serial killer he could be anything they were both out in the ocean or in a pond or in a lake drowning which one would you save think about it it would be immoral to choose the dog well i'm going to get myself in trouble but this is just basic life stuff it would be immoral to choose the dog my daughter kind of disagrees with me on this but it would be immoral to choose the dog over the human because they're human right we live in a world where that's changed where you you would get in more trouble putting your dog on a chain than you would a human right and people can raise their kids any way they want to and i watch some of them come in walmart sometimes you're going through walmart you see some funny things i like to watch people see them coming walmart and they're knocking their kids around right in public kids aren't dressed where where is the social service where's the people supposed to take care of this these kids obviously there's drugs in the home there's problems in the home and you look at that like how in the world they got alcohol on their breath stumbling to walmart buying stuff for themselves buying alcohol to taking care of that kid and think where is the parents if you did that to a dog you get in trouble god i pray god gets a hold of us today yeah but that would never slip into the church children matter children matter yes you have a pet and i believe they'll be in heaven praise god you know you have a pet that you love and everything that you love and all they ever loved you i understand all of that but that child is more important yes listen but that's the way the church is going they make the important thing the program the important thing is the building the important thing is the money or the suit that the pastor wears or the priest wears the important thing is the form of the ceremony and they forgot to mother the word listen brother said it's a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngins around her she don't want any of them whooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah why such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination he said they had one like that in one of the churches why he'd throw they'd throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff as this go along you see she's pregnant with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering acts 2 38 miserable creatures she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific society church that she belonged to here they would throw her out at the next council she can't have it listen you might be embarrassed by it but there's only one way to be born and that's through a mess every birth is a mess you were born in a mess naturally and you're gonna it's gonna be a mess when you're born spiritually you gotta die to yourself there's a death that takes place and then a birth and there's a messy thing that goes on you might have you might cry you might weep you might shout no matter what you do but it's not in that but it's the fact that there's a birth taking place yes hey man but you don't want that she don't want birth she's too busy taking care of other things she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind he said that the word can bring forth oh my born of the spirit of god it has the spirit of god in it no intellectual church joining creed going bobby here painted face there's no such thing as that in it all of it he said you don't find that in the word of god you find an old-fashioned sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of god well i hope we have a few of them in here this morning born of the spirit of god screaming hollering shouting praising god he said that's all together out of the reach for her she don't want that that's right why mother had broken but the bible says in joel 2 25 i will restore to you the years yes everything that the cankerworm the locust the caterpillar the palmer worm everything that was taken away by that roman system everything that's been lost by the invasion are you with me today he said i will restore it you see motherhood is a scriptural principle beginning in the garden of eden and the promise was that the woman's seed would bruise the head of the serpent you see without a mother there could never be a savior that's why it's so important why we protect it so so so so tightly why we want our girls to raise up untouched by the world and the things of the world we want them to be right yes they'll make mistakes but it's a word that restores us back yes are you with me now it's a scriptural principle there had to be a mother to have a savior that's why satan hates it so much first timothy 2 12 says i suffer not a woman to teach nor do you serve authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed and then eve he said brother ben that's hard but look why adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression but go on notwithstanding i love this because she was in the transgression she had to be the the the thing that god would work through to bring about redemption he couldn't do that throughout it belong are you with me now it had to be a mother and that's the redemption that he's bringing the final full redemption and this hour of the bride comes to the rapture of the church how does it come through the bride yes are you with me now hallelujah she produces a rapture right think about it it's in you already it comes through the mother he said notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety now the catholic church takes that that she's saved by having kids but that's not what this means she's saved by childbearing not by having a baby mixer saved but because she's raising children doing her duty not raising cats dogs and want more to take the place of the child as they do today now watch and again take it back to mary mary was nursing her own salvation she was saved in childbearing yes if we could make it just elemental elementary where it would apply to men and women you're saved by by believing the word and by doing it yes are you with me now you're saved by believing the word and by doing it by being a mother you never thought about that but you're working out your own salvation with fear and trembling just by living and i recognize that the blood of christ has to come in you to want to do that and there has to be the spirit of god to want to do that you'll never do it on your own but you mothers that are in church and maybe you're sitting in the nursery today and you're saying about you struggle with your kids all the time and you think what am i doing i i can't even hear half of the sermon i don't understand what's going on do you realize what you're doing yes you're raising by doing what god called you to do as a mother by being what god called you to be as a mother you're raising you're nursing your own salvation yeah oh god and who had more impact someone said thomas edison you know someone's commenting he said well boy you've had a great such a great impact on science he said who had more impact me or my mother he said because when i was a child the teacher sent me home said this boy is dumb he'll never be able to learn oh my but his mother said he's not dumb i'll teach him myself and she taught him and brought him up and he become the inventor of the light bulb and so many things that we take for granted in this modern society today who was greater listen the one that nursed him yeah oh god by just doing what you do you see the gospel isn't some great thing somewhere but just by doing what you do you're working out your own salvation you're living out the acts of jesus christ on the earth oh my not just when you go to meetings not just when you go not just when you're in church even but when you're at home washing the dishes yes men or women by the way we'll be egalitarian we'll we'll just spread that all around when you're at home washing the dishes if you're helping your wife or you're the one that's doing it all the time but put it that way huh you're working at your salvation well i take my wife and do something for her for mother's day and my wife mother's day and our anniversary and our uh her birthday all comes up within a few days of each other and so what i do is usually i'll take her somewhere and i'm going to take her to jonesboro maybe and do some shopping and stuff i'm working out my salvation yeah because i can't preach without a wife sure can't pastor you or you hear me it's that simple when you mean go to work you work with your hands work out in the field work on the tractors work it work in the factory you're working out your own salvation because he said a man that don't work shouldn't eat and a man that won't provide for his family is worse than an infidel that's right and so it's not just not by just having a baby made or saved but because she was a mother oh my simply by doing your duty you're working out your salvation but i want to tell you this morning that motherhood has been restored by the message of the hour malachi 4 did his job said behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord he shall turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the heart the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to the fathers let's not come and smite the earth with a curse there had to be a restoration amen a heart turning not a head turning but a heart turning look at ephesians 5 25 said husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church he said here's how you're supposed to love your wife as christ loved the church and gave himself you give yourself sacrificially to your wife yes you gave yourself he gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish listen motherhood restored means you he restores the potential your potentials to be pure again so he can marry you he couldn't do that with you as a sinner you were lost you were outside the economy of god but he comes himself with his sacrificial love and produces a way through the blood so that you can come back right you thought this was a hard sermon this morning but it's not listen if you've fallen from your place as a son or daughter of god there's a way back christ has to marry a bride with your sacred virtues intact how's he gonna do that because we're all born in sin we're all shaping in iniquity how's he gonna marry a bride who's clean and pure and a virgin spiritually speaking how's he gonna marry a bride like that he has to marry someone who he has washed who he has cleansed hallelujah oh my lord i was not eligible to be to his wife i can't even say that word i was not eligible to be his wife i had marred my spiritual virtue by sin but he restored my eligibility and made it as though i'd never done it i want you to listen before i close what he says about you and points directly to you now as the bride of jesus christ as we close this mother's day service today he says this is the opening of the seven seals he says i know it sounds strange to you but god has vindicated it so perfectly there's no question in it and so he ties it back what was it the restoration of the word would come to bring a spiritual union between the bride and the bridegroom he said he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life listen as i'm skipping through this now but i just want to get the main points too you are standing if you're standing on god's word and with god's word every amen every jot every tittle where are you standing if you're standing today you're a mother doing it to your best to your ability what you know to do by the word if you're a father doing what you know to do by the word if you're a person in the church doing maybe you made many mistakes in the past but you're standing today having been transformed by the blood of jesus christ and you're doing everything you know to do you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god everybody today wants to tell you who you are they say you should find out who you are find out who you are about what you think find out who you are by what you read by what you see on tv no he says i'll tell you what you are you are standing completely justified you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the son of the living god he said every man and woman that's born of the spirit of god and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect hear me today the world may say you're not perfect even other people in the church might look at you and say you're not perfect but that's what you was yesterday but you come to god i don't care if you were baptized last week i don't care if you come to god a year ago or 30 years ago and you've made many mistakes maybe in your life but you are perfect today you are perfect oh do we believe it today he said oh that spiritual union of christ in his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested vindicated just what the bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day you never sinned at the first place god don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god yes you are the virtuous bride of jesus christ he said you're standing there washed your book of divorcement is put away it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of god you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood quit letting the devil beat you up about who you are quit letting him make you what you were what you were in your past life but why don't you come to him today and say this is what i am not because of something i did but because the word has come to me he has married me he's washed me with his sacrificial love he died for me and i can live for him now amen you are the virtuous bride of christ hallelujah amen he washed with the water of his own blood to become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of god called love whatever you are you are servants of god whatever god wants you to do or you hear me this morning where your place is god placed in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors he placed that by virtue of his own predestination you were that to begin with your first wedding was a no you've never done it in the first place pure unadulterated oh hallelujah leaving soon for the skies standing ready your garments washed by the water the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you and you were washed in bleeding word you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky you are wearing oh he's not waiting to buy it for you it's already bought he's not waiting to give it to you it's already been given he's not waiting to put it on your finger but he put already put it on your finger my wife doesn't have to wonder whose husband she has who's her who her husband is because years ago i bought this at a pawn shop in west plains i both maybe i shouldn't admit that i bought this ring and i bought one for her and i put it on her finger the day we got married and it ain't never come off it's always been there i gave it to her i slipped it on her finger and he before not when you were born not when you did the wrong things but before the world ever began he slipped on you you're wearing the wedding band of predestinated unmerited grace a wedding band of grace unmerited of your own he knew you before the foundation of the world so he slipped the wedding band on you there he put your name on a book yes oh god musicians go ahead and come listen to me let me read these too you just just just kind of bring it down you're without shame you are complete that's what we just read you are justified pretty man you are pure quit letting the devil beat that out of you quit letting your mistakes take that away from you if you're walking in the word today walking under the influence of that word walking being washed by the water of the word you are complete you are justified you're not waiting on a message to come you believe the message you're pure you're sinless oh god who can pronounce me sinless people have lots of theories but who can say that i'm sinless only god could do that and so he spoke he come down and he died for my sins and he rose again on the third day and after 2000 years he came and he spoke through a prophet malachi 4 at the end time to tell me you're perfect you're sinless you're virtuous you're predestined you're washed you are not you will be you are who can you hear it this morning don't let that drag you down i see new christians many times they'll come and say well yesterday i was this yesterday i was that but what are you today what are you today you come to god you've come to a water that can wash you you've come to a place that can change you you've come to a god who can make a real difference in your life you've not come to a 12-step program you've not come to a theory you've not come to an idea but you've come to a god who can make you so you never did it in the first place you are sinless you are virtuous you are perfect you are predestined you are washed you are unadulterated you are servants of the most high god you are placed in the church don't let the devil fight you in that position you're placed there by god oh god you're ready to go go back and read the quotes when you get home you're ready to go oh god amen oh my he put us he put is you can't miss the rapture he put a wedding band on you back there he said you were the bride you're ready to go you're going to the wedding he said you're wearing the wedding band of grace unmerited yes grace all right but brother ben you don't know my past paul goes down something like i did this morning sometimes we talk about these things and people feel bad because they're identified maybe maybe now maybe in the past with some of those things and it makes them feel bad but paul goes down the list of every sin you can think of in first corinthians six but then he gets to verse 11 he said and such were some of you oh such worth some of you but you are washed but you are sanctified but you are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god you've been pardoned yesterday i was under judgment yesterday i was not free but today i am free today i am not a sinner i am a sinless son or daughter of god oh my oh my bow your heads with me for a moment such were some of you but you can wash if you've never been washed today would be a good day on mother's day to begin to mother the word in your life to begin to care about it to have compassion for the word i don't we don't believe what we believe because we don't have compassion on others we want the whole world to be saved because that's the attribute of god but we do what we do because we have compassion for the word we love the word because it was the word that meant for us the word that died for us the word is not just a letter but the word is a person you see why you can't talk us out of that you're never going to tell me jesus isn't god because the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the word is a person and the word washed me from my sin the word has made me free if you're not standing free today would you just talk to him it only takes a moment just reach out to him where you're at today and talk to him the altar is open if you want to come but you can reach out to him right where you are and say lord forgive me of my sins let me know i've been washed by your blood fill me with the holy ghost let me have a desire to serve you all the days of my life some of you mothers here today we honor you today we thank you for what you've done we thank you for how you've raised your kids maybe you've made some mistakes though are you thinking about those today but listen you are still the pure unadulterated mistake free bride of jesus christ you might make mistakes like mary did sometimes even with the word but you could always come back to it you always come back to it and you can be pure today justified and so you never did it in the first place they all made mistakes with my kids i was too strict or i was too easy i did some things that you talked about this morning brother just just say lord forgive me and move on move on you're still the pure bride of jesus christ and god still honors you as a mother what you've done in the past you can't fix that but you can let the healing power of god come in and heal not only you but even the things the mistakes that you made and the ones who were the objects of those mistakes i'm so glad that the healing power of god can come down and even heal that relationship or you've done or said things that you shouldn't have you you broken off relationship you've been harsh maybe where you shouldn't have been maybe some of your dads maybe the same way you think well i've i've messed up my family i've done things that are wrong just let him come in and heal that relationship today i believe he's here to do that for you today whatever it is whatever you're dealing with wouldn't you have doubts and discouragement just take him back to the word i am the virtuous bride of christ i am a child of god i am a believer amen heavenly father i pray for these lords several
