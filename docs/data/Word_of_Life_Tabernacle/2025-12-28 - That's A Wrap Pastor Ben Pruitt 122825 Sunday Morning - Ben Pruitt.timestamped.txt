[11:04] Amen. You looking forward to that day?
[11:06] Amen. Just before we have the ushers
[11:08] come, let's sing that song. We'll slow
[11:09] it down just a little bit. I pledge
[11:11] allegiance to the Lamb.
[11:24] I have heard how Christians
[11:28] long ago
[11:31] they were brought before
[11:35] a tyrant's throne.
[11:38] And they were told that he
[11:42] would spare their lives if they would
[11:47] renounce
[11:49] the name of Christ.
[11:53] But one by one
[11:56] they chose to die.
[12:00] the son of God.
[12:04] They will not deny
[12:07] like a great angel.
[12:14] I can almost
[12:16] hear their voicees
[12:20] ring. I pledge
[12:23] alance
[12:26] to the lamb.
[12:28] With all my strength,
[12:32] with all I am, I will seek to honor
[12:40] his command.
[12:43] I pledge
[12:44] aliance
[12:47] to
[12:50] the lamb.
[12:53] Now the years have come
[12:57] and the years have gone,
[13:00] but the cause of Jesus
[13:04] still goes on.
[13:07] Now our time has come to count the cost
[13:14] to reject this world to embrace
[13:20] the cross.
[13:22] So one by one let us live our lives
[13:28] for the one who died
[13:32] to give us life
[13:35] till the trumpet
[13:38] sounds on that final
[13:41] day.
[13:43] Let us proudly
[13:45] stand
[13:46] and we lift our hands and sing it to
[13:49] him. I pledge
[13:52] aliance
[13:54] to the lamb
[13:57] with all my strength.
[14:00] With all I am, I will sing to honor
[14:08] his command.
[14:11] I pledge.
[14:13] And then once again as the ushers come
[14:17] to the lamb.
[14:21] Oh, I pledge
[14:23] alance
[14:26] to the lamb.
[14:28] With all my strength, with all I am, I
[14:35] will seek to honor
[14:39] his command.
[14:42] I pledge
[14:44] alce
[14:46] to
[14:50] the lamb.
[14:55] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[14:58] And we got a lot of requests

[20:06] chorus there. Oh, I'm amazed. amazed
[20:11] that you love me.
[20:15] And I'm so amazed

[20:30] And my sins
[20:32] are washed. They're all washed away. All
[20:37] my sins
[20:39] are washed away.
[20:44] No one knew how alone I was feeling.
[20:52] And the emptiness I tried so hard to
[20:56] hide.
[20:59] Though I laughed and said my life was
[21:02] fine without you.
[21:06] I was covering up the secret tears I
[21:11] cried.
[21:13] Then one day someone told me of your
[21:18] mercies
[21:21] and the love you showed on a hill called
[21:24] Calvary.
[21:28] There you died and purchased my
[21:32] redemption.
[21:35] When you broke sin's power and set my
[21:38] spirit free,

[22:24] Lord. You know the many times I've gone
[22:28] astray.
[22:32] But I've learned your love is stronger
[22:35] than my weakness.
[22:39] And your ear is open every time I pray.
[22:46] No one else has ever cared for me like
[22:50] you, Lord. Other
[22:54] friends could never be as close to me.

[31:27] prayer.
[31:31] Heavenly Father, it's so good to be back
[31:33] in your house again this morning.
[31:37] Lord, we thank you for that drawing that
[31:39] we feel. We know, Lord, that without you
[31:43] putting something in our heart, we could
[31:44] never be drawn.
[31:46] We are drawn this morning because there
[31:48] is life there. And we are so thankful
[31:52] for that, Lord.
[31:54] Oh God, may we never lose the wonder of
[31:56] it.
[31:58] that we never lose the attraction, oh
[32:00] God, to your presence, to your word.
[32:04] Pray you would to humble us before you
[32:06] today. Lord, move me out of the way.
[32:08] Lord, speak to your people. I pray this
[32:11] morning. Maybe there'd be some need that
[32:13] I wouldn't know anything about. Lord, I
[32:15] don't ask you to reveal it to me and
[32:16] just ask you to speak, Lord, Lord, to
[32:19] the situation. Pray you'd grant it
[32:21] today. We thank you for all that you've
[32:23] done, Lord. We thank you for the the
[32:25] things that you've given us, Lord, and
[32:27] the blessings, but Lord, we're needy
[32:29] people this morning. I pray we'd always
[32:32] maintain that sense of urgency, Lord.
[32:35] Lord, how we need you. Draw us, Lord. We
[32:38] will run, Lord, we will run to your
[32:40] presence. We will respond. We thank you
[32:43] for that today. I pray you'd heal every
[32:45] person, touch every heart. We pray in
[32:47] Jesus name. Amen.
[32:51] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[32:54] Amen. Do you love the Lord this morning?
[32:56] So good to be in the house of the Lord
[32:58] and to know that he's here with us
[33:01] because he promised that he would be 2
[33:03] Timothy chapter 4 and verses 7 and 8. 2
[33:07] Timothy chapter 4 vers 7
[33:11] and 8. Brother JT, it's good to see you
[33:13] this morning. We uh we sure love you and
[33:16] and uh love sister Clelet and uh she's
[33:20] missing this morning, but she's in a
[33:22] much better place and a congregation.
[33:25] You know, Brother Brandham said that
[33:26] this place was uh as much like heaven on
[33:30] earth as we could be was gathered with
[33:32] the saints. And I'm so thankful that
[33:34] there's another place, a better place.
[33:37] You may be here this morning. You may be
[33:39] hurting. You may be you may be weary.
[33:42] But over there, there's none of that.
[33:43] and so thankful for that today. We'll
[33:46] let you know about the funeral. They
[33:47] weren't able to meet with the folks
[33:49] there because of the holidays, but we'll
[33:51] let you know and trust that some of us
[33:53] will be able to go this week and honor
[33:55] our sister for her memorial and just
[33:58] pray for brother JT for strength and and
[34:01] the entire family. Amen. For comfort.
[34:04] Second Timothy chapter 4 and verse 7.
[34:06] This this week, Brother uh is going to
[34:09] be a busy week. Brother Jason Jackson is
[34:11] going to be here Wednesday night. I know
[34:13] sometimes we can't come on Wednesdays
[34:15] and I know some of you live far away,
[34:16] but if you can come this Wednesday
[34:18] night, this may never happen again. So,
[34:21] Brother Jason's coming and they're going
[34:23] to let out their service and come over
[34:24] and be with us. So, we we want to honor
[34:27] that them being willing to do that and
[34:29] and try to be here on Wednesday night.
[34:31] So, we sure enjoy fellowship of those uh
[34:35] in our area and we want to support them
[34:37] all that we can and they're supporting
[34:39] us by coming. Next Sunday, we'll have
[34:41] the election of our officers. Next
[34:43] Sunday morning, the re-election of our
[34:45] deacons and trustees and then u uh so be
[34:49] here for that if you can. And then next
[34:51] Sunday night, we'll have communion.
[34:53] We'll go ahead and do that next Sunday
[34:54] night, the Lord willing. Second Timothy
[34:57] 4:7, I have fought a good fight.
[35:01] I have finished my course. I have kept
[35:06] the faith. And as forth there is laid up
[35:09] for me a crown of righteousness which
[35:12] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[35:14] me at that day. Notice the confidence
[35:17] that Paul has. He said, "I have fought a
[35:19] good fight. I have finished my course. I
[35:22] have kept the faith. And there is laid
[35:23] up for me a crown of righteous
[35:26] righteousness which the Lord the
[35:27] righteous judge shall give me that day.
[35:29] Not to me only unto all them also that
[35:32] love his appearing." I pray the Lord
[35:34] would add his blessing to the word. You
[35:36] may be seated this morning.
[35:39] Brother Joel is preaching in Wisconsin
[35:41] this morning. Keep him in your prayers.
[35:46] I I heard an expression and it come to
[35:48] my heart this week and come to my mind
[35:51] as I was preparing this. It's a little
[35:52] bit different. It actually comes from
[35:54] the movie industry. Uh and the
[35:56] expression is that's a wrap. If you've
[35:59] ever heard that, it's an expression made
[36:01] by the director of a movie when filming
[36:04] is complete and all the acting is done.
[36:08] And they say that's a wrap. It speaks of
[36:10] finality. But it speaks of more than
[36:13] that. It speaks of satisfaction with the
[36:15] work. And Paul is expressing
[36:18] satisfaction with his own walk with the
[36:20] Lord. He's saying, "I fought a good
[36:22] fight. I've kept the faith. I I've I've
[36:26] lived among you and and you've seen my
[36:28] life and things and he he knows what he
[36:30] was. He knows that it's the grace of God
[36:32] that made him what he what he became.
[36:35] But he also is expressing a satisfaction
[36:39] with his own walk with the Lord. Listen
[36:40] to him in Philippians chapter 1 and
[36:42] verse 21. He said, "For to me to live is
[36:45] Christ and to die is gain." In other
[36:47] words, he said, "I know where I'm
[36:49] going." How many could say amen to that
[36:51] this morning? I know where I'm going.
[36:53] And I was speaking to brother Bill
[36:54] Curtis when he continued to pray for him
[36:57] unable to be or go anywhere right now.
[37:00] But brother Bill told me, he said, "I
[37:02] know where I'm going." He said, "If I
[37:03] would have passed away," he said, "I
[37:05] would have known where I was going." I'm
[37:07] thankful for confidence like that. I I
[37:09] think we all ought to be that way that
[37:10] we know where we're going. If you don't
[37:12] know where you're going this morning, we
[37:14] can know. There's a way that we can
[37:16] know, and that's by the blood of Jesus
[37:18] Christ, by the salvation that he gives
[37:20] us by the seal of the Holy Ghost. Now he
[37:23] said, "But if I live in the flesh, this
[37:25] is the fruit of my labor." He said, "Yet
[37:26] what shall I choose? What not?" He said,
[37:29] "For I am in a straight betw twix too,
[37:31] having a desire to depart." He said,
[37:34] "And to be with Christ, which is far
[37:35] better," he said. So, in other words,
[37:38] this world can't compare to that one.
[37:40] Right? That one's far better than this
[37:42] one could ever be. He said, "But I," he
[37:45] said, "Nevertheless, to abide in the
[37:47] flesh," he said, is more needful for
[37:48] you. So, he said, "The people need me."
[37:50] And he said, "So for your sakes, I'm
[37:52] going to continue on. I'm going to
[37:54] continue fighting. I'm going to continue
[37:56] doing what I'm doing." So it wasn't yet
[37:59] a wrap for Paul's life. That's a wrap is
[38:03] said at the end of a production. It's
[38:04] also said at the very end of the
[38:07] process, but it's it's it's also said
[38:10] every time a portion of the film is
[38:12] complete. So if they finish a day's
[38:15] filming, that's a wrap. The film goes
[38:17] into the can, it's done. every time a
[38:20] particular actor is finished because
[38:22] some of us might not make it till the
[38:24] rapture. He said, "We which are alive
[38:26] and remain to the coming of the Lord,
[38:28] there will be those that sleep and they
[38:29] go to meet meet him first and they raise
[38:32] even before we're changed." And and I'm
[38:34] thankful for that. But but so they're
[38:37] just there early, but they are their
[38:40] their work is over at a certain time.
[38:42] There's a time when the director says
[38:45] that's a wrap. Everything that you were
[38:47] called to do has been done. Everything
[38:49] that you were purposed for has been
[38:51] done. Oh, I'm so thankful that that we
[38:54] can have confidence in God that he knows
[38:56] when the time is.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; There were opportunities in every day
[39:02] that will never be presented to us
[39:05] again. Have you ever thought about that?
[39:07] Whatever you do today, whatever
[39:09] opportunities you have today will never
[39:11] be presented to you again. You'll never
[39:14] be the age you are now again.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; We just come through Christmas time and
[39:21] I my children, they were a lot more fun
[39:23] when they were younger, you know, and
[39:25] and and opening gifts and things. They
[39:27] they they anticipated it in a different
[39:30] way and they just love Christmas and
[39:32] they still do. But but I you know, they
[39:35] you can't relive that time.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Every time it passes, it's over. It's a
[39:40] wrap.
[39:41] &gt;&gt; It's done. It's put in the can. Right?
[39:44] It's over. Filming is done. And so
[39:47] whatever happened that day can't be
[39:50] redone. It's over. It's passed. That's
[39:53] why they call it the past.
[39:55] &gt;&gt; Right? The good thing about that is that
[39:58] you can put it in the past, right?
[40:00] Whatever happened can be in the past.
[40:03] You don't have to relive it again today.
[40:06] I'm so thankful for that. But your
[40:09] children will never be the age that they
[40:11] are now. right today.
[40:14] Right. And I think we ought to spend
[40:16] time with them. I think we ought to take
[40:17] time for our families and and take time
[40:20] for our young people because they will
[40:21] never be this old again.
[40:25] Someone has said that today is the only
[40:27] living time. Every other day is dead or
[40:30] unborn, right? It's the only time that's
[40:32] alive is today. And life is designed so
[40:36] that you never get time back. Every day
[40:39] filming is done. And the great director
[40:41] says that's a wrap.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Everything that could be done was done
[40:45] and it's over.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; And I know that's a sobering thought,
[40:48] but brother Brandon says it this way. He
[40:50] said each one, he said we each one come
[40:52] down to the end of the road. He said
[40:55] where we're going to give account for
[40:57] every word. You know the Bible teaches
[40:59] that. He said every idle word that men
[41:01] shall speak, right? They'll give an
[41:02] account for. He said we're going to give
[41:04] an account for every word. He said,
[41:06] "Right now, we know that our voices when
[41:08] we are born, our first little cry goes
[41:12] all on a tape. It's going to be played
[41:14] back again at the day of judgment." You
[41:17] realize when you speak something, that's
[41:20] why words are so important. In fact, in
[41:23] uh one of the prophets in the Old
[41:24] Testament, he he told them, he he told
[41:26] the people of Israel, he said, "Bring
[41:28] words and repent." Bring with you words.
[41:31] What's he saying? Words are important.
[41:33] And it matters what you say because what
[41:35] you say can't be unsaid,
[41:38] right? You can say, "I'm sorry." But it
[41:39] can't be unsaid.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Everything that you've ever said is
[41:42] still out there.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; It's still traveling. In fact, science
[41:45] has proved that if you could get far
[41:47] enough away from the earth and had
[41:49] something that you could pick it up
[41:51] with, every audio wave that's ever went
[41:53] out, every every word that's ever been
[41:56] spoken could be heard again. In fact, if
[42:00] there are aliens, if there if there
[42:01] would be someone many many light years
[42:04] away. They could be hearing things that
[42:06] were spoken on the earth many many years
[42:09] ago, right? Because they've just now
[42:11] traveled that far. That's why you have
[42:13] echo, right? Because what you're hearing
[42:16] if you go stand at a canyon and you
[42:18] speak and and your words go across when
[42:20] you hear it back, it's just taken that
[42:22] long to travel across and come back. Oh,
[42:26] church, do you realize how important it
[42:27] is the way that we act and the things
[42:29] that we say? No wonder David said, "Let
[42:31] the let the words let the words of my
[42:34] mouth and the meditation of MY HEART BE
[42:36] ACCEPTABLE in your sight, oh God. I I
[42:39] want it to I want it to be known that I
[42:41] serve the Lord. I want to speak the
[42:43] right things, say the right things."
[42:45] Brother Brown said, "Even the clothes
[42:47] that you wear will be showed in your
[42:49] face at the day of judgment." Even
[42:52] science has found that by television.
[42:54] See, television doesn't manufacture a
[42:56] picture. It only channels it. The color
[42:58] of clothes, every time you move, every
[43:01] thought in your mind is absolutely kept
[43:05] on God's record. Now, think about that
[43:08] for just a moment. GOD'S NOT LIMITED
[43:09] even to just what YOU SAY OR WHAT YOU OR
[43:12] the moves that you make, but he actually
[43:14] knows the thought of your heart. And
[43:17] every thought THAT'S IN YOUR HEART IS
[43:19] ABSOLUTELY KEPT ON GOD'S RECORD. YOU
[43:21] SAY, "WELL, I HATE THAT PERSON, BUT I
[43:23] just won't tell them. I'LL JUST KEEP IT
[43:24] IN MY HEART." GOD KNOWS YOUR HEART.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; He knows about that. He knows THAT
[43:29] BITTERNESS. HE KNOWS THAT HATRED. HE
[43:31] KNOWS WHAT'S ON THE INSIDE.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; I say, "God, cleanse me today." David
[43:36] said, "Cle, Lord, cleanse me from secret
[43:38] faults."
[43:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; EVERY THOUGHT THAT'S IN YOUR MIND IS
[43:41] ABSOLUTELY KEPT ON GOD'S RECORD, AND
[43:43] THAT big thing will be laid right before
[43:46] you, right? There's going to be a
[43:48] premiere one day. uh to use the industry
[43:52] uh jargon. There's going to be a
[43:54] premiere one day and and your life is
[43:57] going to be played before you. I know
[43:59] it's sobering this morning. I want us to
[44:01] think about it cuz we're going somewhere
[44:02] today. But but your life is going to be
[44:04] played before you. Brother Brand said
[44:06] that big thing will be laid right before
[44:07] you. Every one of them filthy dresses
[44:09] YOU WORE. EVERY TIME YOU WENT TO THE
[44:11] BARBER SHOP, CUT THAT HAIR God give you.
[44:13] Obviously, he's talking about women
[44:15] there. He said it's going to be you'll
[44:16] answer for it. You can't make a move
[44:18] right there. just even the thoughts of
[44:19] your heart while you're doing it will be
[44:21] played right before you. HE SAID, "HOW
[44:23] ARE YOU GOING TO ESCAPE? HOW SHALL WE
[44:26] ESCAPE IF we neglect so great a
[44:27] salvation?" He said, "See, WE'RE NOT
[44:29] GOING TO ESCAPE. EVERY MOVE AND THE
[44:32] THOUGHTS of the heart is recorded right
[44:35] in another dimension, even the color of
[44:38] clothes that you wear."
[44:42] Can you imagine? It's played back in
[44:45] another dimension. Now again, brother
[44:48] Brandon said, "We have blundered into
[44:49] science enough to wake us up for FOR
[44:52] REALITIES TO KNOW THAT EVERY move that
[44:53] we make goes around and around the world
[44:56] the same time that we make it. So
[44:59] there's nothing hidden." The Bible says
[45:00] there's nothing hidden with him with
[45:03] whom we have to do. In other words,
[45:04] there's nothing hidden with the one that
[45:07] we'll actually have to answer to.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:10] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, you know, EVERY MOVE
[45:12] WE MAKE goes around around the world the
[45:13] same time we make it. We got that
[45:14] through television. He said, 'Oh God, do
[45:17] they realize that every word we say
[45:19] scientifically proven it's on a record
[45:21] and it starts when we start living in
[45:23] this earth. It ends when we die AND IT'S
[45:25] PUT IN GOD'S ALBUM to be played back
[45:27] again at the judgment. You realize the
[45:28] first lie that you ever told if you're
[45:31] if it hasn't been repented of if you're
[45:33] not a Christian,
[45:35] &gt;&gt; the first lie THAT YOU EVER TOLD IS ON
[45:37] RECORD.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; And it's enough to condemn a person. Oh
[45:41] yeah. Come on.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S ENOUGH RIGHT THERE TO JUSTIFY going
[45:48] to hell. But I'm so thankful for the
[45:50] blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses us
[45:53] from all sin this morning. I'M SO
[45:55] THANKFUL FOR A BLOOD THAT WASHES IT
[45:57] AWAY.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; But said, "Oh, dear God." He said, he
[46:04] said, "These words never die. They go on
[46:05] and on. The record will be played." He
[46:08] said at the day of jud the judgment you
[46:10] seen those hands that went up father
[46:12] it'll be right there at the day of
[46:13] judgment also what their heart was
[46:17] thinking
[46:18] &gt;&gt; will be there at the day of judgment.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Now
[46:24] we know as message people we understand
[46:27] that the bride doesn't go through
[46:29] judgment. How many know that
[46:31] &gt;&gt; we're going to be there but we actually
[46:33] sit in judgment with him. Paul said,
[46:35] "Don't you know that the saints judge
[46:38] angels?" So, we're going to be there.
[46:41] But we are we are going to be called to
[46:43] account before God. You say, "Well, how
[46:45] does that work? If all of my actions
[46:48] come before God, all of my deeds come
[46:51] before God, how could I ever be
[46:53] justified?"
[46:55] See, your life will be played. But
[46:58] remember, he is the director of the
[47:00] movie, and he actually takes the part of
[47:04] YOUR LIFE THAT'S PLAYED OUT. THINK ABOUT
[47:05] it for just a moment. Everything you've
[47:07] done, everything you've said, EVEN THE
[47:09] THOUGHTS OF YOUR HEART ARE ALL OUT THERE
[47:11] FOR YOU.
[47:13] Are you with me now? Everything's there.
[47:16] And then the director has a RIGHT TO
[47:20] TAKE OUT THOSE PARTS.
[47:24] HALLELUJAH.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; You can't do it.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; I can't do it,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; but he can do it.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; He has a right to edit the footage.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; That That ought to be enough to make a
[47:37] Baptist shout.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul, HE HAS A RIGHT TO EDIT THE
[47:42] FOOTAGE. HE HAS A RIGHT TO COME IN AND
[47:45] THOSE THAT FIRST LIE THAT YOU EVER TOLD
[47:47] ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR SINS ARE UNDER
[47:49] THE BLOOD. HE JUST CUTS that out.
[47:52] Are you with me now?
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Every sin that you committed
[47:57] &gt;&gt; can be placed under the blood.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; And if it is put under the blood, what
[48:02] what happens to it? IT'S COMPLETELY DONE
[48:05] AWAY WITH.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And it's NOT THAT HE DESTROYS THE FILM,
[48:09] BUT HE EDITS OUT THE PARTS that were
[48:12] offensive to him.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; So he goes through it. Oh my, aren't you
[48:16] glad for a good editor? He don't miss
[48:18] nothing. HE DON'T LEAVE NOTHING. OH MY.
[48:20] EVERY SIN IS CUT OUT BY GOD. EVERY ONE
[48:24] OF THEM. IF YOU'RE WASHED IN THE WATER
[48:25] OF THE WORD TODAY, DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW
[48:27] IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE'RE WASHED. DON'T
[48:28] YOU REALIZE THE VALUE OF THE MESSAGE OF
[48:30] THE HOUR? THE VALUE OF THE BLEEDING WORD
[48:32] IN OUR DAY, THE FULLNESS OF THE
[48:34] ATONEMENT, IS THAT THIS WORD ACTUALLY
[48:36] WASHES US. IT CAUSES US TO BE FILLED
[48:38] WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND WHEN WE'RE
[48:40] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S A SEAL
[48:41] THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS CAN BE BROUGHT
[48:43] BACK TO YOU ANYMORE. IT'S A WRAP. IT'S
[48:46] OVER. YOUR LIFE IS SEALED. AND WHATEVER
[48:48] IT IS THAT YOU HAVE DONE OR WILL DO IS
[48:50] COMPLETELY EDITED OUT.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD FOR SO GREAT A
[48:57] SALVATION? OH, THAT OUGHT TO STIR US UP
[48:59] THIS MORNING. IT OUGHT TO BRING
[49:00] SOMETHING IN OUR HEART SO WE CAN KNOW,
[49:02] GOD, YOU SAVED ME AND YOU DID AWAY WITH
[49:04] THE PARTS THAT OFFENDED YOU.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH, cuz there's been MANY
[49:10] PORTIONS OF MY LIFE THAT I WOULDN'T WANT
[49:11] SHOWN ON THAT DAY. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
[49:13] PARTS OF YOUR LIFE, MANY THOUGHTS OF
[49:14] YOUR HEART THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT SHOWN
[49:16] ON THAT DAY. BUT HE RESERVES THE RIGHT
[49:18] TO EDIT THE FOOTAGE.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; HE MADE A PROMISE THAT YOU WERE
[49:24] JUSTIFIED AS THOUGH YOU NEVER DID IT IN
[49:26] THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT WHEN THE MOVIE
[49:28] IS PLAYED, IT NEVER SHOWS UP ON THE
[49:30] MOVIE. IT THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE NEVER
[49:33] COMES UP.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; OH, THEN I THINK WE OUGHT TO LEAVE 2025
[49:39] IN THE PAST. YES,
[49:40] &gt;&gt; we ought to WE OUGHT TO FORGET THOSE
[49:42] THINGS THAT ARE BEHIND. HE SAID, "BUT I
[49:44] MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES, BUT THE EDITOR
[49:45] CHOSE YOU. HE CALLED YOU AND HE HE PUT
[49:48] THAT PART ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR."
[49:50] AMEN. HE THREW IT AWAY. HE DID AWAY WITH
[49:53] IT IN THE SEA OF HIS FORGETFULNESS NEVER
[49:55] TO BE REMEMBERED AGAINST YOU ANYMORE.
[49:57] OH, THAT OUGHT TO MAKE us that ought to
[49:59] do something for our hearts today.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He just takes that film and he
[50:05] &gt;&gt; splices it.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:09] G.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Yes,
[50:10] &gt;&gt; sir.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Now they do it digitally. They sit at a
[50:14] computer. You can take a You can take
[50:16] even one of our services, you take it
[50:18] digitally and just cut out a part.
[50:21] Oh my. He chose to cut out a part.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Hey, I think we ought to I think we
[50:30] ought to let him forgive us today.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Let the past be the past.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Let it fall on the cutting ROOM FLOOR.
[50:36] LET IT BE DONE AWAY WITH TODAY. GET A
[50:38] REAL REVELATION OR JUSTIFICATION UNTIL
[50:40] WE CAN BE FREE OF IT. HE SAID, "DEVIL,
[50:42] YOU TRY TO TELL ME I DID IT." LOOK AT
[50:44] THE MOVIE. IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. GOD
[50:46] CUT IT OUT. LISTEN, YOUR HUSBAND CAN'T
[50:48] DO THAT FOR YOU. YOUR WIFE CAN'T DO IT
[50:50] FOR YOU. THE CHURCH CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU.
[50:52] A PASTOR CAN'T DO IT FOR YOU. ONLY BY
[50:54] SALVATION IN HIS NAME. AMEN. ONLY THE
[50:57] BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST CAN WASH AWAY SIN.
[50:59] WHAT CAN WASH AWAY MY SIN? NOTHING BUT
[51:01] THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WHAT CAN MAKE ME
[51:04] WHOLE AGAIN? NOTHING BUT THE blood of
[51:07] Jesus.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; So, the bride doesn't stand
[51:16] with her original footage.
[51:18] Can you imagine how awful that would be?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; You young people, you realize how
[51:23] important it is that you come to Christ,
[51:25] that you give your heart to him, your
[51:26] life to him, really surrender to him.
[51:29] how important that is.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; That you actually come in his presence.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That your life is changed by him.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Because no one would want their entire
[51:43] LIFE TO BE PLAYED OUT AT the day of
[51:45] judgment,
[51:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And every thought
[51:49] and the people maybe that we thought
[51:50] were real saints,
[51:53] &gt;&gt; but when the thoughts of the heart come
[51:55] out,
[51:56] &gt;&gt; are you with me now?
[51:59] JUST BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PUBLIC SINNERS
[52:01] DON'T MEAN THEY weren't sinners.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Just because a person's GOT LONG HAIR
[52:05] AND LONG DRESS DON'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT A
[52:06] SINNER.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE? IT'S THE
[52:09] PERSON THAT'S BEEN CHANGED FROM THE
[52:11] INSIDE THAT'S BEEN WASHED BY THE BLOOD
[52:13] OF THE LAMB.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; We must have s we must have a new birth.
[52:18] WE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE WITH
[52:20] GOD WHERE HE edits the footage. Yes,
[52:22] &gt;&gt; sir.
[52:24] or every thought
[52:27] continue. Everything we think, every
[52:29] word we say,
[52:31] &gt;&gt; just is still on the tape.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "Verily, verily, I
[52:38] say unto you, he that heareth my word,"
[52:42] Brother Brandon said, "That's more than
[52:43] just hear with your ear. That's
[52:44] understand,
[52:45] right? He that understandeth my word,"
[52:47] in other words, understand that I need
[52:49] to be born again. What must I do to be
[52:52] saved? He that heareth my word and
[52:54] believeth on him that sent me hath
[52:56] everlasting life, and shall not, someone
[53:00] say it with me, shall not come into
[53:03] condemnation,
[53:04] but is passed from death unto life.
[53:10] Hallelujah. We will not come into
[53:12] judgment.
[53:14] See, and you realize what he does for
[53:16] you. He lets you come to church, right?
[53:21] A and you're our sin because we still do
[53:24] things that are wrong.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; You understand? You live in a body
[53:27] that's not converted,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THIS BODY STILL SINS,
[53:33] &gt;&gt; still has thoughts that aren't right and
[53:34] things and and yet the inner man is
[53:36] supposed to control that. But there's
[53:39] times we give in to the to the to the
[53:41] evil dog, if you will, the black dog. We
[53:44] give in to that. And when we give in to
[53:47] the wrong thing, what happens? It
[53:49] creates a it creates a tension there and
[53:52] and it creates sin in our lives. It
[53:55] creates a mistake that we make. And yet
[53:57] there is an atonement with the father.
[53:59] The Bible said if ANY MAN SIN, HE has an
[54:01] atonement.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; So hallelujah. WE GET TO COME TO CHURCH
[54:06] TO BE WASHED.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; LISTEN, he's already FORGIVEN YOU.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; THE ATONEMENT WAS MADE THE MOMENT THAT
[54:13] YOU SINNED OR YOU COULDN'T have even
[54:14] MADE IT.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? HE'S ALREADY SEALED YOU. THE
[54:17] ATONEMENT'S BEEN MADE. WHY DO WE COME TO
[54:19] CHURCH TO HAVE OUR CONSCIENCE WASHED?
[54:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? Because you're still living IN A
[54:25] BODY OF FLESH. YOU STILL NEED TO WASH
[54:27] YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET. BECAUSE YOU'RE
[54:28] OUT IN A WORLD THAT'S THAT'S FILTHY.
[54:30] YOU'RE IN A WORLD WHERE YOU PICK UP
[54:32] THINGS THAT ARE WRONG. SO, WE WASH OUR
[54:33] FEET. WE WASH OUR HANDS. WE SAY, "LORD,
[54:36] WASH MY CONSCIENCE OF THESE THINGS.
[54:38] LORD, I FORGIVE ME." AND WE COME HERE
[54:40] AND WE ARE JUDGED HERE. JUDGMENT BEGINS
[54:43] AT THE HOUSE OF GOD. WE ARE JUDGED HERE.
[54:46] SO WE DO NOT HAVE TO BE JUDGED OVER
[54:47] THERE.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? AND SO WE REPENT OF
[54:51] OUR SINS. I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE BEFORE I
[54:53] COME OUT AND PREACH, I REPENT EVERY TIME
[54:55] BECAUSE I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE THINGS
[54:57] THAT I DID OR THINGS THAT I SAID OR
[54:58] SOMETHING THAT I DID WRONG AND SAY,
[55:00] "LORD, FORGIVE ME. LET LET ME COME CLEAN
[55:03] BEFORE THE PEOPLE. LET ME COME WITH A
[55:05] CLEAR CONSCIENCE BEFORE THE PEOPLE." OH,
[55:06] I PRAY THAT EACH ONE OF US COULD DO
[55:08] THAT. EVERY TIME WE COME TO THE HOUSE OF
[55:10] GOD, WE OUGHT TO SAY, "LORD, WASH ME
[55:12] TODAY. WASH." I KNOW I STILL LIVE HAVE A
[55:14] STICKY NATURE. I STILL LIVE IN A BODY OF
[55:16] FLESH WASH ME TODAY.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; LET MY TESTIMONY IN MY LIFE MATCH THE
[55:21] TESTIMONY YOU HAVE IN HEAVEN.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; SAY, Brother Ben, how do you know that
[55:29] he cuts out the bad parts?
[55:31] I want you to think about this.
[55:35] How do you know?
[55:37] Well, he did it for Abraham. Amen.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; You remember Abraham made an egregious
[55:47] mistake.
[55:49] He he made one with Ishma, but he made
[55:52] an egregious mistake by leaving the
[55:54] land,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; going down into Egypt,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; and
[55:59] and lying to the king,
[56:03] &gt;&gt; right? and then and then tell him it's
[56:06] his sister and she almost gets married
[56:08] to the king if it wasn't for the Lord
[56:10] &gt;&gt; because Abraham didn't have the guts to
[56:12] tell him the truth,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; And and you find out that's the most
[56:17] amazing thing. But Isaac is he did it
[56:19] twice.
[56:23] It was such a and it was so bad the
[56:25] first time, you know, you'd think he
[56:27] wouldn't have done it again, but he did
[56:29] it again. And so he comes back again and
[56:32] does it. And you think, well, that means
[56:34] that Abraham failed, and he did,
[56:37] right? But but when Paul is telling the
[56:40] story of Abraham,
[56:42] &gt;&gt; you'll find it in Romans chapter 4. I
[56:44] don't have time to read all of it,
[56:45] &gt;&gt; but in verse 20, he says, "He staggered
[56:47] not."
[56:52] &gt;&gt; It sure looks to us like he's
[56:53] staggering.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Right? In fact, he might have be
[56:57] completely on his face
[56:59] &gt;&gt; down there in Egypt, down there in Gar.
[57:01] Right. He he's HE'S HE'S STAGGERING. BUT
[57:04] PAUL SAYS HE STAGGERED NOT
[57:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS SHOWING THROUGH HIS
[57:09] PROPHET WHAT HE SEES.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; THE FOOTAGE THAT remains
[57:17] &gt;&gt; the rest OF ABRAHAM'S LIFE HAS BEEN CUT
[57:20] OUT.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; And thrown in the garbage,
[57:24] &gt;&gt; disintegrated. Are you with me now? Yes,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; sir.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; SO, HE DOESN'T MENTION HIS TRIPS DOWN
[57:30] THERE. HE DOESN'T MENTION THE BIRTH OF
[57:31] ISHMAEL. HE DOESN'T MENTION ANY OF THAT.
[57:33] WHAT DOES HE SAY? HE STAGGERED NOT AT
[57:36] THE PROMISE OF GOD THROUGH UNBELIEF, BUT
[57:38] WAS STRONG IN FAITH, GIVING GLORY TO
[57:40] GOD. AND BEING FULLY PERSUADED WHAT HE
[57:43] HAD PROMISED, HE WAS ABLE ALSO TO
[57:45] PERFORM. THEREFORE, it was imputed to
[57:48] him
[57:50] &gt;&gt; for righteousness.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Now, it was accounted to him for
[57:54] righteousness. So, the trips to Egypt
[57:57] and Ger were edited out.
[58:00] Birth of Ishmael edited out they
[58:01] happened but not in the sight of God.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, he would not be judged
[58:06] for those things.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my. When Abraham
[58:12] comes to that before God, right? Because
[58:15] we all must appear before God. Are you
[58:18] with me now?
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Just like us, we have to appear before
[58:21] God. When he comes before God, his
[58:24] failures
[58:26] won't be mentioned. Why? because of his
[58:29] faith. It was imputed to him for
[58:31] righteousness.
[58:33] We do not have to fear death. WE DON'T
[58:36] HAVE TO FEAR GOING BEFORE God because
[58:40] our our failure, our our sin, that's why
[58:43] he was judged on the cross. IT'S WHY
[58:46] THEY PUT A CROWN OF THORNS ON HIS HEAD.
[58:48] IT'S WHY THEY THEY PUT 39 STRIPES ON HIS
[58:51] BACK. It's why he HUNG THERE. SUFFERED
[58:55] LIKE no other man had suffered. Not only
[58:57] WITH THE PHYSICAL PAIN BUT WITH THE PAIN
[58:59] OF SEPARATION FROM GOD UNTIL HE CRIED
[59:01] OUT, "MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU
[59:03] FORSAKEN ME?" LISTEN, YOU CAN'T BE
[59:04] JUDGED FOR WHAT WAS JUDGED IN HIS BODY.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; HE DIED FOR THE RIGHT
[59:10] &gt;&gt; TO EDIT THE footage
[59:12] &gt;&gt; now,
[59:14] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU LET HIM DO IT TODAY?
[59:16] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD. HE SUFFERED FOR THE right
[59:20] &gt;&gt; to be the director of your life.
[59:23] See, when we GIVE HIM LORDSHIP, WE'RE
[59:25] NOT JUST SAYING, "WELL, LORD, now I'm
[59:26] going to let you tell me what to do."
[59:27] That is that's what it is. But he's all
[59:30] we're also telling him, "I'm under your
[59:31] protection.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; I'M COMING UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THIS
[59:35] SHED BLOOD WHEN I I'M SURRENDERING
[59:37] MYSELF TO YOU. AND BY DOING THAT, I'M
[59:39] I'M AVAILING MYSELF OF ALL YOUR
[59:41] PROTECTION. IT'S NO LONGER UP TO ME
[59:44] WHETHER I GO TO HEAVEN OR NOT, BUT IT'S
[59:46] UP TO YOU. IT'S NO LONGER MY
[59:47] RIGHTEOUSNESS. IT'S YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."
[59:49] RIGHT.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; And even Abraham, the only reason THAT
[59:52] COULD HAPPEN IS BECAUSE GOD IN HIS MIND,
[59:55] THE LAMB WAS SLAIN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[59:57] OF the world.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Abraham not even knowing
[1:00:01] what he had hardly what he had faith in,
[1:00:03] but yet he had faith and believed in
[1:00:05] that God who would justify his life.
[1:00:09] Listen,
[1:00:11] we we know that the bride does not come
[1:00:13] into white throne judgment. How many
[1:00:15] know that
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; you're not going to stand before God and
[1:00:18] be judged?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; But the movie still plays,
[1:00:23] but there's nothing there to judge. Are
[1:00:25] you with me now?
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; We should just stop and worship him.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; And I know there's people who like to
[1:00:38] dig in the trash.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; It's always astounded me, by the way.
[1:00:43] I've always been astounded by people who
[1:00:44] like to dig in the trash. You know, they
[1:00:46] go, maybe some of y'all like to do this,
[1:00:47] I don't know, but dumpster divers, you
[1:00:48] know, they go out and and they dig
[1:00:50] through other trash and they find
[1:00:52] something and it's good and and and you
[1:00:55] know, they take it back and use it. I
[1:00:57] when I was in Africa and West Africa,
[1:00:58] it's very poor and the trash just thrown
[1:01:01] on the side of the road, but eventually
[1:01:03] there's nothing usable at all. It kind
[1:01:06] of takes care of itself because other
[1:01:07] people come in and just kind of like
[1:01:09] vultures. They come around the trash and
[1:01:11] take anything that's even remotely
[1:01:13] usable.
[1:01:14] So the trash just doesn't pile up. In
[1:01:17] fact, when it gets smaller, then they
[1:01:18] push it into the middle of the road and
[1:01:19] fill the potholes with it.
[1:01:23] But I don't understand digging through
[1:01:25] trash cuz it's smelly. You could buy the
[1:01:27] same thing for $1.99 up at the Dollar
[1:01:30] Tree.
[1:01:32] Somebody else's trash.
[1:01:34] How much worse is it for a Christian
[1:01:38] to dig through other people's trash
[1:01:41] to TRY TO FIND ACCUSATION AGAINST
[1:01:43] SOMEBODY OF SOMETHING THAT THEY DID AT
[1:01:45] SOME POINT IN SOME DISTANT MEMORY?
[1:01:47] LISTEN TO ME. YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY
[1:01:49] HAVEN'T repented of that. AND IF THEY
[1:01:50] HAVE REPENTED OF THAT, YOU'RE DIGGING UP
[1:01:52] SOMETHING THAT GOD DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; I say leave it alone. I got enough
[1:01:59] trouble just keeping MYSELF CLEAN. I GOT
[1:02:02] ENOUGH TROUBLE MAKING SURE THAT I'VE
[1:02:03] BEEN JUDGED AND RIGHT BEFORE GOD. I GOT
[1:02:05] ENOUGH JUST TO MAKE SURE MY FOOTAGE IS
[1:02:07] EDITED AND I'M UNDER THE BLOOD. I DON'T
[1:02:09] WANT TO DIG UP ANYBODY ELSE'S TRASH.
[1:02:11] LISTEN TO ME. SO MANY TIMES I'VE THOUGHT
[1:02:13] ABOUT THIS. LISTEN, IF SOMEBODY HAD DONE
[1:02:14] SOMETHING AND FAILED GOD IN SOME WAY, I
[1:02:16] I LOVE ALL of you. I think so much of
[1:02:18] YOU AS A CHURCH, YOU KNOW, IT' KILL ME
[1:02:20] IF I FOUND OUT THAT SOME OF YOU HAD
[1:02:22] FAILED GOD IN SOME GREAT WAY. YOU KNOW,
[1:02:23] I REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
[1:02:26] I KNOW SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO CONFESS
[1:02:28] THINGS AND YOU GOT TO BRING IT OUT AND
[1:02:30] BUT IT ALWAYS HURTS ME. I DON'T I DON'T
[1:02:32] WANT TO KNOW. I WANT TO THINK OF YOU THE
[1:02:34] WAY GOD THINKS OF YOU. AND I'LL SAY
[1:02:35] THIS, IT DON'T SHAKE ME TOO MUCH WHEN I
[1:02:37] FIND OUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS MAKE
[1:02:39] MISTAKES.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; I know you think, WELL, IF WE TELL THE
[1:02:42] PASTOR, YOU KNOW, HE'LL HE'LL THINK
[1:02:44] BADLY OF US. NO, YOU YOU'RE A HUMAN
[1:02:46] BEING LIKE I'M A HUMAN BEING. WE BOTH
[1:02:48] MAKE MISTAKES. WE BOTH HAVE TROUBLE. WE
[1:02:50] BOTH HAVE TROUBLE GETTING UP IN THE
[1:02:51] MORNING. YOU WANT TO TELL YOU WANT ME TO
[1:02:53] TELL YOU HOW MUCH I STRUGGLE? I STRUGGLE
[1:02:55] SOMETIMES TO BEND OVER AND PUT MY SHOES
[1:02:57] ON.
[1:02:59] Some of y'all CAN FELLOWSHIP WITH ME ON
[1:03:01] THAT THOUGHT. NOW, come on. We're human
[1:03:03] beings. I STRUGGLE BECAUSE I'M
[1:03:06] OVERWEIGHT. I STRUGGLE SOMETIMES BECAUSE
[1:03:07] OF MY HEALTH. I STRUGGLE SOMETIMES
[1:03:09] BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF STRESS I PUT
[1:03:10] MYSELF UNDER.
[1:03:13] The amount OF ANXIETY I PUT MYSELF
[1:03:15] UNDER. BUT I'M STILL THE CHOSEN OF GOD.
[1:03:17] I'M HIS ELECTED. I WAS CALLED BEFORE
[1:03:19] TIME BEGAN. I MIGHT STRUGGLE AS A HUMAN
[1:03:22] BEING, BUT I'M GOING TO A PLACE WHERE
[1:03:23] THERE IS NO STRUGGLE. COME ON, CHURCH.
[1:03:25] I'M GOING TO A PLACE WHERE THAT NOBODY
[1:03:27] DIGS THROUGH THE TRASH. I'M GOING TO A
[1:03:29] PLACE WHERE THERE'S NO MORE THERE'S
[1:03:31] NOTHING HELD AGAINST ME AT ALL.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And I am sure,
[1:03:38] are you with me now? When my movie is
[1:03:41] played,
[1:03:43] everything
[1:03:45] is under the blood.
[1:03:47] That's why Paul can say, "I fought a
[1:03:48] good fight.
[1:03:52] I kept the faith."
[1:03:55] Amen.
[1:03:57] Now, so we're not judged.
[1:04:00] But the Bible is very clear. We will
[1:04:02] stand before God.
[1:04:04] We will give an account.
[1:04:07] Romans 14:10, "Why do thou judge thy
[1:04:08] brother? Why do thou s not thy brother?
[1:04:11] For we shall all stand before the
[1:04:13] judgment seat of Christ." 2 Corinthians
[1:04:15] 5:10. We must all appear before the
[1:04:17] judgment seat of Christ that everyone
[1:04:19] may receive the things done in his body.
[1:04:22] Notice carefully the wording of this.
[1:04:23] According to that he hath done whether
[1:04:26] it be good or bad.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Now if you are a Christian today he has
[1:04:34] taken away the bad.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; What does he do with the good?
[1:04:44] Think about it for a minute. He doesn't
[1:04:46] just like you never lived,
[1:04:50] but he actually counts the good towards
[1:04:53] you.
[1:04:57] Now, think about it.
[1:05:00] The woman at the well, the the woman at
[1:05:03] the well had had five husbands. The one
[1:05:06] she was living with was not hers.
[1:05:08] And she'd done all that sin. when she
[1:05:12] comes before God,
[1:05:15] none of the sin will be remembered.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; But her running into the city,
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; right, to tell the men.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; There's some things that's going to be
[1:05:28] remembered
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; when when the final movie is cut. It's
[1:05:33] put in the can. It's a wrap. It's over.
[1:05:36] There's some things going to be
[1:05:37] remembered. Brother JT,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; your faithfulness will be remembered.
[1:05:41] Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST DONE AWAY WITH.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; YOUR FAITHFULNESS TO GOD WILL BE
[1:05:47] REMEMBERED.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; What What is Paul saying? Whether it be
[1:05:49] good or bad, we know the bad is edited
[1:05:52] out by the grace of God. What happens to
[1:05:55] the good? The good goes on our account.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; It's just the truth, church.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; So the bad is under the blood.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; But Paul says, I KNOW THERE IS A WHAT? A
[1:06:07] crown waiting.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; A crown waiting. a reward
[1:06:12] waiting for me.
[1:06:14] There are five crowns spoken of in
[1:06:17] scripture. One, the first one is the
[1:06:19] crown of life in James 1:12.
[1:06:22] It's for one who gives their life. James
[1:06:24] 1:12, "Blessed is the man that endureth
[1:06:26] temptation, for when he's tried, he
[1:06:28] shall receive the crown of life, which
[1:06:31] the Lord hath promised to them that love
[1:06:34] him."
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; So, it's a man that endureth temptation.
[1:06:38] Once he's been tried, he'll have a crown
[1:06:41] of life. In the Smyrnian church age, the
[1:06:43] saints are encouraged to be faithful to
[1:06:45] death. REVELATION 2:10, "FEAR NONE of
[1:06:47] those things which thou shalt suffer.
[1:06:49] Behold, the devil shall cast some of you
[1:06:51] into prison that you may be tried. You
[1:06:53] shall have tribulation 10 days,"
[1:06:54] speaking of that dark age, thousand-year
[1:06:57] period of when it was so dark. He said,
[1:06:59] "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will
[1:07:02] give thee a crown of life."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:07:06] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "BE THOU FAITHFUL
[1:07:07] UNTO DEATH." HE DOES NOT SAY, "BE
[1:07:09] faithful until death, but unto death,
[1:07:13] right? Unto death." Brother Brandham
[1:07:15] said, "You may have to seal your
[1:07:16] testimony with your blood." Now, we
[1:07:19] think that's impossible. We look at that
[1:07:21] today. Brother Allen is saying about it
[1:07:22] this morning. I pledge allegiance to the
[1:07:24] lamb. And we think about those long ago
[1:07:26] who did that, who stood there and gave
[1:07:28] their lives.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; And many TIMES WE LOOK AT THAT KIND OF
[1:07:31] FAITH. WE THINK, WELL, THAT WOULD BE
[1:07:32] IMPOSSIBLE IF I WAS HAD TO DO THAT. BUT
[1:07:34] DON'T YOU REALIZE, BROTHER B SAID, IT'S
[1:07:35] THE same faith you live by daily
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; IS THE SAME FAITH THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO
[1:07:40] STAND BEFORE SOMEBODY WHO HAD THE RIGHT
[1:07:42] TO TAKE YOUR LIFE and said IF YOU DENY
[1:07:45] HIM I'LL LET YOU LIVE. You say, "HOW
[1:07:47] COULD I DO THAT?" BUT THE SAME FAITH YOU
[1:07:49] LIVE BY DAILY. IT'S THE SAME FAITH THAT
[1:07:51] ALLOWED them to do that. Just a
[1:07:53] different anointing, but the same faith.
[1:07:55] You understand? We've been we're
[1:07:57] anointed for what we have need of. And
[1:08:00] this age is an eagle anointing to be
[1:08:01] able to see and understand. Again,
[1:08:04] brother Brandon said, "I will give THEE
[1:08:05] A CROWN OF LIFE SINCE NOT EVEN A CUP OF
[1:08:06] COLD WATER given in the name of the Lord
[1:08:09] fails to receive a reward. HOW GREAT
[1:08:11] SHALL BE THE REWARD TO HIM WHO GIVES HIS
[1:08:13] LIFE AS A MARTYR FOR THE name of the
[1:08:15] Lord Jesus."
[1:08:17] Oh my. JESUS CALLS IT THE CROWN OF LIFE.
[1:08:21] ONE CROWN IS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE STRIVEN.
[1:08:24] The other is for those who have given.
[1:08:27] Both crowns are incorruptible.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT PERISH. THE WINNERS OF THE
[1:08:32] WORLDLY RACE OF LIFE WILL SOON LOSE THE
[1:08:33] JOY OF THE PLOT OF THE WORLD. THEIR
[1:08:35] GLORY WILL FAIL. He's talking about the
[1:08:36] crown. PAUL TALKED ABOUT THE CROWN of
[1:08:38] righteousness. We'll get to that in a
[1:08:39] moment. AND THE CROWN OF LIFE, he said
[1:08:41] one is for those who have striven, one
[1:08:43] is those for those who have given. He
[1:08:45] said those WHO STRUGGLE IN THIS LIFE,
[1:08:46] who race in this life, their glory will
[1:08:48] fail. But those who give their LIVES FOR
[1:08:50] GOD, EITHER by daily striving, how how
[1:08:53] many strive EVERY DAY? HOW MANY TRY YOUR
[1:08:55] BEST TO BE A CHRISTIAN AND LIVE IN A
[1:08:57] WORLD FULL OF OF MISERY IN SATAN'S EDEN?
[1:09:00] IF YOU'RE DOING THAT, THERE'S A CROWN OF
[1:09:01] LIFE WAITING FOR YOU.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; OH, come on, church.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; A CROWN OF LIFE, AN INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN.
[1:09:09] He said they will not perish. BUT THOSE
[1:09:11] WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES FOR GOD, EITHER BY
[1:09:12] DAILY STRIVING OR SHEDDING their blood
[1:09:14] as the crowning sacrifice of their
[1:09:15] lives, will be given the crown of life.
[1:09:18] He said, "All too little time is spent
[1:09:20] on laboring for the eternal rewards of
[1:09:23] God." THE RECOMPENSE OF GOD IS TOO
[1:09:26] LIGHTLY ESTEEMED. MOST OF US ARE JUST
[1:09:29] HAPPY TO BE SAVED AND WE SHOULD BE.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's good. BUT PAUL SAID, "I HAVE A
[1:09:34] CROWN WAITING."
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Do you see why we still preach to saved
[1:09:38] people?
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHY WE STILL WE STILL TRY TO
[1:09:42] STIR YOU UP IN the in the in the faith
[1:09:45] and KEEP YOU ON THE MARK AND AND PRESS
[1:09:47] TOWARD THE MARK OF THE HIGH CALLING? YOU
[1:09:49] SEE WHY WE STILL WE STILL PRESS. WE
[1:09:51] STILL DO. YOU SAY, "WELL, I'VE BEEN
[1:09:52] SAVED. I CAN JUST COAST ON THAT." BUT
[1:09:54] THERE'S A CROWN waiting for you.
[1:09:57] There's something waiting for you, a
[1:09:59] reward waiting in ANOTHER LAND. I KNOW
[1:10:01] FOR OUR ELDERS, THIS OUGHT TO BE AN
[1:10:02] ENCOURAGEMENT, BUT IT OUGHT TO BE AN
[1:10:03] ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EVERY ONE OF US
[1:10:05] BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE DIRECTOR
[1:10:06] WILL SAY, "THAT'S a wrap and it's over."
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A CROWN WAITING FOR YOU. OH, I
[1:10:12] WANT TO RECEIVE MY CROWN.
[1:10:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:17] I want to be able TO SAY LIKE PAUL, I
[1:10:18] FOUGHT A GOOD FIGHT. I kept the faith.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said, "All too little
[1:10:25] time is spent on laboring for the
[1:10:26] eternal rewards of God, the recompense
[1:10:28] of God is too lightly esteemed. If we
[1:10:30] believe in the reality of the
[1:10:32] resurrection of the body and an eternal
[1:10:34] KINGDOM OF SUBSTANCE, THEN WE OUGHT TO
[1:10:35] LAY UP IN HEAVEN those good treasures
[1:10:38] that are available to faithful saints."
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Now, Paul also speaks of an
[1:10:45] incorruptible crown. 1 Corinthians 9:24
[1:10:49] he said ' know ye not that they which
[1:10:51] run in a race run all but one receiveth
[1:10:53] the price so run that you may obtain and
[1:10:56] every man that striveth for the mastery
[1:10:58] is tempered in all things they do it to
[1:11:00] obtain a corruptible crown but we
[1:11:03] incorruptible
[1:11:05] brother Brown picks THIS UP AND HE TELLS
[1:11:06] US THAT IF YOU WERE MADE PRESIDENT of
[1:11:08] the US right so if they made you
[1:11:11] president David White is the president
[1:11:13] now
[1:11:15] right he said that would be a crown.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; It'd be a reward. Be a great thing. But
[1:11:21] you'd have to give it up. If you don't
[1:11:24] give it up, they'd come make you give it
[1:11:25] up. And even if you were your whole
[1:11:28] life, if you were made king of England,
[1:11:31] RIGHT, THAT'S FOR LIFE, LIKE A SUPREME
[1:11:33] COURT JUSTICE, RIGHT? If you were made a
[1:11:36] king, YOU WOULD HAVE THAT FOR YOUR LIFE,
[1:11:38] BUT YOU'D HAVE TO GIVE IT UP.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; But listen, he gave us an incorruptible
[1:11:43] crown. So he said if you receive the
[1:11:46] crown, oh my, that he gives you, it's an
[1:11:49] incorruptible crown. What is that crown?
[1:11:51] He said Jesus gives us a CROWN OF LIFE
[1:11:53] THAT WE NEVER give up. An incorruptible
[1:11:54] CROWN OF HIS GLORY. WE DON'T HAVE TO
[1:11:56] give it up. He gives it to us. It's a
[1:11:58] blessing. IT'S THE HOLY SPIRIT THAT HE
[1:12:00] WANTS TO CROWN OUR LIFE WITH. DON'T YOU
[1:12:02] SAY, "WELL, I'M A CHRISTIAN, BUT HE
[1:12:03] WANTS TO CROWN YOUR LIFE WITH THE HOLY
[1:12:05] SPIRIT.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT'LL NEVER BE
[1:12:08] TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU." LISTEN, THEY CAN
[1:12:10] TAKE YOUR MONEY. THEY CAN TAKE YOUR
[1:12:11] STUFF. THEY CAN TAKE YOUR 401K. THEY CAN
[1:12:14] TAKE EVERYTHING. BROTHER JT, YOU MIGHT
[1:12:16] BE IN A IN A PLACE YOU NEVER THOUGHT
[1:12:17] YOU'D BE IN, IN A BODY CONDITION YOU
[1:12:19] NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN, BUT THEY
[1:12:21] CAN'T TAKE THE HOLY GHOST OUT OF YOUR
[1:12:22] HEART.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW CORRUPT THE GOVERNMENT IS.
[1:12:25] COME ON, CHURCH. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY
[1:12:27] MUCH THEY MESS WITH YOUR FINANCES, NO
[1:12:29] MATTER HOW MUCH OH, COME ON. NO MATTER
[1:12:30] HOW MUCH THEY TAX YOU, NO MATTER HOW
[1:12:32] MUCH PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOU, NO MATTER
[1:12:34] HOW MANY PEOPLE TRY TO PUT YOU OUT, IF
[1:12:36] YOU HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, IT'S AN
[1:12:37] INCORRUPTIBLE CROWN. IT CAN NEVER be
[1:12:39] taken away from you.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 28:5,
[1:12:46] this where brother Brandham takes this,
[1:12:48] that the Holy Ghost is a crown. He says,
[1:12:49] "In that day shall the Lord of hosts be
[1:12:51] for a crown of glory." Oh yes. "AND FOR
[1:12:55] A DIADEM OF BEAUTY unto the residue of
[1:12:57] his people, AND FOR A SPIRIT OF JUDGMENT
[1:13:00] TO HIM THAT SITETH IN JUDGMENT, FOR
[1:13:02] STRENGTH TO THEM THAT TURN THE BATTLE TO
[1:13:04] THE GATE." OH, I NEED STRENGTH. YOU NEED
[1:13:06] STRENGTH TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BATTLE.
[1:13:07] WHAT IS IT? HE GIVES YOU A CROWN.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Gives you strength.
[1:13:12] incorruptible crown. It gives you just
[1:13:15] an earnest here. But what will it be,
[1:13:18] brother Brand? So, when the shadow, the
[1:13:19] shadow of the shadows becomes a reality.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; There's a crown of righteousness that we
[1:13:26] already read about. Paul says, "I fought
[1:13:29] a good fight. I finished my course. I've
[1:13:30] kept the faith. Inforth, there's laid up
[1:13:33] for me a crown of righteousness." But he
[1:13:34] didn't limit it to himself. He said,
[1:13:37] "Not to me only, but unto all them also
[1:13:39] that love his appearing."
[1:13:42] I love this. Brother said, "When you're
[1:13:45] sick and tired of this old life,
[1:13:50] I don't mean a death wish, but how many
[1:13:52] would just be happy if the rapture
[1:13:53] happened?"
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Come on. We We're getting tired of this
[1:13:57] whole life.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "For me to live as Christ and
[1:14:02] die is gain. to go on a rapture would be
[1:14:04] so much better because we all get to go
[1:14:06] together, right? And my loved ones
[1:14:09] wouldn't wouldn't have to sorrow over me
[1:14:11] because they'd go with me. Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I want to take them all with me. But the
[1:14:16] Brandon said, "When you're sick and
[1:14:17] tired of this old life, and you'll love
[1:14:19] the appearing of the Lord Jesus better
[1:14:22] than you love your food."
[1:14:26] That spoke to me.
[1:14:30] You love the appearing.
[1:14:32] Brother Herald, you like good food.
[1:14:34] Brother Herald, I'm around Brother
[1:14:35] Herald enough. I know. He comes over the
[1:14:36] house, he likes good food. He knows good
[1:14:39] food. As long as it's got plenty of
[1:14:40] tobasco sauce on it, it's good food.
[1:14:44] But he said, "You'll love the appearing
[1:14:45] more than you love your food
[1:14:48] better than you love your food at the
[1:14:49] table or your wife." Well, think about
[1:14:52] it, church. You love your wife. You
[1:14:54] should love your wife. You should love
[1:14:56] her more than anything else in the
[1:14:57] world. But yet, there's something beyond
[1:14:59] that. He said you love his appearing
[1:15:01] more than your wife or your children.
[1:15:03] And there's a crown laid up for you.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah. There's a crown laid up for
[1:15:09] you. The same crown Paul's talking
[1:15:11] about. HE SAID THAT'S THE He said not a
[1:15:14] crown, a gold crown to put on your head.
[1:15:16] Come on. We think so carnal sometimes.
[1:15:19] It's not a GOLD CROWN THAT HE PUTS on
[1:15:20] our head. HE SAID BUT A BODY.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. This is a good crown.
[1:15:28] So he give you the Holy Ghost, an
[1:15:29] incorruptible crown. AND HE GIVES YOU A
[1:15:31] body that's incorruptible, A BODY FREE
[1:15:35] FROM PAIN, CROWNED IN THE GLORY OF GOD,
[1:15:39] CROWNED IN THE IMMORTALITY OF JESUS
[1:15:41] CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT'S LAID UP FOR YOU.
[1:15:43] SEE, PAUL KNEW I GOT A BODY WAITING FOR
[1:15:45] ME.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He said, that's what's laid up for you.
[1:15:49] That the Lord, THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGE, WILL
[1:15:50] give you that at the that day. That's
[1:15:52] the day we look forward to. God has made
[1:15:55] a WAY OF ESCAPE FOR every one of us.
[1:15:58] LISTEN TO ME. YOU MIGHT BE TIRED. YOU
[1:15:59] MIGHT BE WEARY. YOU MIGHT BE GETTING
[1:16:01] OLD. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE EVERY DAY IS A
[1:16:02] STRUGGLE, BUT THERE'S A CROWN WAITING
[1:16:04] FOR YOU. DON'T GIVE UP NOW. DON'T STOP
[1:16:07] NOW. YOU KEEP FIGHTING. YOU KEEP
[1:16:08] WORKING. YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE
[1:16:10] DOING. KEEP ON SERVING THE LORD. THERE'S
[1:16:12] A CROWN WAITING FOR THOSE THAT LOVE his
[1:16:14] appearing.
[1:16:16] Hallelujah.
[1:16:18] Amen. What if what's going on right now?
[1:16:20] I know you don't always understand
[1:16:22] everything we DO, BUT BROTHER RANDOM
[1:16:23] TALKED ABOUT THAT WHEN THAT POPE from
[1:16:25] America COME IN. HE SAID, "THEN I'LL
[1:16:26] PULL THE BRIDE TOGETHER,
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; BEN. Why do you want unity among the
[1:16:32] people? BECAUSE I SEE THAT THAT'S
[1:16:33] SOMETHING THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN BEFORE
[1:16:34] THE COMING OF THE LORD."
[1:16:37] OH, CHURCH, LET LET'S DO OUR PART. LET'S
[1:16:40] DO OUR PART HERE IN THIS AREA, NOT TO
[1:16:42] GOSSIP AND CUT DOWN AND HURT, BUT LET'S
[1:16:44] DO OUR PART TO BUILD UP AND TO HELP AND
[1:16:46] AND TO DO WHAT WE CAN FOR OTHERS. WHY?
[1:16:49] BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN. WE
[1:16:51] LOVE HIS APPEARING. WE'RE NOT EVEN DOING
[1:16:53] IT SO MUCH FOR THE PEOPLE AS WE ARE FOR
[1:16:55] HIM. We love his appearing. So if you
[1:16:59] love his appearing, wouldn't you want
[1:17:00] the bride to be in unity?
[1:17:05] It got quiet.
[1:17:08] If you love his appearing,
[1:17:10] wouldn't you want to look forward to
[1:17:12] that day
[1:17:14] when we'll be in complete unity, which
[1:17:16] will be on the other side. We come in
[1:17:19] unity of of spirit here. We come in
[1:17:22] unity of everything else over there
[1:17:24] where we can be completely the same in
[1:17:28] the sense that God has made us
[1:17:29] individuals but we become where we
[1:17:32] understand as we are understood.
[1:17:34] Oh my. No misunderstandings there. The
[1:17:37] fourth crown is the crown of rejoicing.
[1:17:40] 1 Thessalonians 2:19 he said, "For what
[1:17:43] is our hope or joy or crown of
[1:17:45] rejoicing? Are not even ye in the
[1:17:48] presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
[1:17:50] coming? So Paul says, I'm gonna see some
[1:17:52] of you. Come on, let just let your mind
[1:17:55] wander for a little bit. The casserole
[1:17:57] will be all right. We'll we'll we'll get
[1:17:59] to it.
[1:18:02] Mom's not here today, so she won't get
[1:18:04] antsy with me.
[1:18:08] I hope she didn't slip in while I was
[1:18:09] saying that.
[1:18:11] She's probably watching. But look, we
[1:18:14] got a few minutes. Let's let's think
[1:18:15] about it for a minute.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Think about this crown of rejoicing.
[1:18:18] What is it? It's when we get to the
[1:18:20] other side and we see those who we've
[1:18:22] been associated with who we helped along
[1:18:25] the way.
[1:18:26] Remember the good things aren't edited
[1:18:28] out.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if you he said if
[1:18:31] you give to missions, if you support
[1:18:33] missions, if you support a church, he
[1:18:36] said and a SOUL IS SAVED, YOUR NAME IS
[1:18:38] ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SOUL FOR ETERNITY.
[1:18:42] That's just a simple thing. BUT IF YOU
[1:18:45] GO OUT AND WITNESS TO SOMEBODY,
[1:18:47] oh my. And they're saved. CAN YOU
[1:18:50] IMAGINE WHAT A GREAT THING THAT WOULD BE
[1:18:52] TO STAND THERE? AND PAUL SAID, PAUL
[1:18:54] TRAVELED THE WORLD FOR THE LORD. AND HE
[1:18:56] GETS TO THIS POINT WHERE HE SAYS, "ARE
[1:18:57] YOU NOT MY CROWN OF REJOICING?" HE SAID,
[1:18:59] "WHEN I STAND BEFORE HIM, I'LL SEE YOU
[1:19:01] THERE AND THAT'LL BE THE CROWN AND I'LL
[1:19:04] START TO REJOICE." Because he WOULD
[1:19:06] LITERALLY BE CROWNED WITH THE PEOPLE
[1:19:08] THAT HE PREACHED TO. OH, THAT WE WOULD
[1:19:11] LIVE A LIFE SO THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS
[1:19:12] CROWN.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Some of you mothers, YOU SAY, "WELL, I
[1:19:16] COULD NEVER PREACH THE GOSPEL." BUT YOU
[1:19:18] CAN YOU CAN HAVE A CROWN OF REJOICING
[1:19:20] WHEN YOUR CHILDREN MAKE IT TO THE OTHER
[1:19:21] SIDE. WHEN THOSE YOU HAD AN IMPACT ON
[1:19:23] AND FELLOWSHIP WITH AND LOVED WITH ALL
[1:19:25] YOUR HEART,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; There will be a crown of rejoicing for
[1:19:28] you when you see them there.
[1:19:32] Hallelujah. Therefore, my brethren,
[1:19:34] dearly beloved, and longed for my joy
[1:19:37] and crown. So stand fast in the Lord, my
[1:19:41] dearly beloved. The people wore the
[1:19:43] crown. Brother said this. He said,
[1:19:45] "Forgive me if I try to take the place
[1:19:46] of a boss. I'm no boss, but I feel TO
[1:19:49] YOU LIKE PAUL said back there by his
[1:19:51] congregation once, you're the stars in
[1:19:53] my crown." How many believe that? SAID,
[1:19:57] "WHEN I CROSS OVER THE LAND OVER ON THE
[1:19:59] OTHER SIDE, YONDER AND MEET YOU IN THAT
[1:20:01] GLORIFIED CONDITION. I WANT YOU TO STAND
[1:20:03] THERE TO SHINE LIKE THE STARS IN MY
[1:20:05] CROWN. I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I WANT TO
[1:20:08] BE THERE."
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:12] I told you a story one time. It it kind
[1:20:14] of affected me. BROTHER BRANDON TELLS AN
[1:20:16] ADOPTION ABOUT A GIRL that one time that
[1:20:19] he was associated with. He said she was
[1:20:21] a Christian. He said, "But I wasn't."
[1:20:25] And that girl had an influence on his
[1:20:27] life before brother Brandham was a
[1:20:29] Christian. A lady that was a Christian,
[1:20:32] he actually went out with her. They were
[1:20:35] boyfriend and girlfriend. And he BUT SHE
[1:20:37] HE SAID SHE ALWAYS HELD HERSELF pure and
[1:20:38] and true. And he said he went to her
[1:20:41] grave when she died young. He went to
[1:20:43] her grave and said she was a real
[1:20:45] Christian.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll see you over yonder." In
[1:20:49] fact, he said there'd be one OF THOSE
[1:20:50] WHO WERE standing there on that day.
[1:20:52] remember that said we're resting on that
[1:20:54] would be THAT GIRL BUT IT WASN'T SO MUCH
[1:20:56] HE IMPACTED HER LIFE BUT SHE IMPACTED
[1:20:58] his
[1:21:01] didn't probably EVEN KNOW IT MAY HAVE
[1:21:03] NEVER KNOWN WHO HE WAS OR WHAT HE DID
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; BUT SHE MADE A DIFFERENCE YOU REALIZE
[1:21:07] YOUNG PEOPLE LISTEN TO ME YOU YOUNG
[1:21:09] PEOPLE THAT ARE DATING OR COURTING
[1:21:11] YOU'RE GOING out some OF YOU REALIZE
[1:21:12] THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CROWN IN YOUR LIFE
[1:21:14] BY THE WAY YOU CONDUCT yourself
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; the way you TREAT YOUR BOYFRIEND OR YOUR
[1:21:19] GIRLFRIEND THE WAY YOU TREAT ONE ANOTHER
[1:21:21] THE WAY WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER HERE AT THE
[1:21:23] CHURCH. WE COULD HAVE A CROWN BECAUSE IT
[1:21:25] COULD BE AN INFLUENCE. YOU ELDERS, YOU
[1:21:26] CAN BE AN INFLUENCE ON THESE CHILDREN.
[1:21:29] NOT JUST TO BE CRITICAL OF THEM, BUT TO
[1:21:32] BE AN INFLUENCE ON THEIR LIVES.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody
[1:21:36] I just say this, my old pastor always
[1:21:38] told me, he said, "If you see a turtle
[1:21:40] on a fence post, somebody put him
[1:21:41] there."
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham didn't get here
[1:21:44] BY ACCIDENT. THERE WAS SOMEBODY
[1:21:45] INFLUENCED his life.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; The angel of the LORD WAS WITH HIM. GOD
[1:21:49] PROTECTED HIM. BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO
[1:21:50] PREACH THE FIRST SERMON HE ever heard.
[1:21:52] SOMEBODY HAD TO BE EVEN DR. DAVIS WAS
[1:21:54] HIS PASTOR. DR. DAVIS NEVER DID BELIEVE
[1:21:56] the message OR UNDERSTAND IT. ALTHOUGH
[1:21:57] HE FINALLY BECOME A PENTECOSTAL, BUT HE
[1:21:59] NEVER DID FULLY EMBRACE THE MESSAGE. BUT
[1:22:01] I'LL SAY THIS, THERE'LL BE A CROWN.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Because of who he led to THE LORD AND
[1:22:07] WHO HE HELPED ALONG THE WAY. I THINK DR.
[1:22:10] BOSWORTH WOULD BE brother Bosworth would
[1:22:12] BE THE SAME WAY. BROTHER BOSWORTH WAS A
[1:22:14] STRENGTH. HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD the
[1:22:15] message the WAY WE DO. AND HE WAS A
[1:22:16] STRENGTH TO BROTHER BRANDHAM. I BELIEVE
[1:22:18] THERE'LL BE A CROWN. ALL THE MINISTRY
[1:22:19] THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD AND THE
[1:22:20] MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT ARE TODAY
[1:22:22] SAYING WE'RE RESTING ON THAT.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; It'll be a crown,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; a star, brother Bosworth's crown.
[1:22:30] He said, remember, he said, I remember
[1:22:32] in my vision when I seen the presence of
[1:22:34] the Lord where his people in THAT
[1:22:35] GLORIOUS LAND YONDER, I LOOKED AROUND. I
[1:22:37] TOLD THEM AND THEY TOLD ME HE WOULD
[1:22:38] JUDGE ME FIRST FOR THE GOSPEL THAT I
[1:22:40] PREACH. I SAID EXACTLY the way Paul
[1:22:43] preached it. And then millions of people
[1:22:45] screamed out, "We're resting on that."
[1:22:48] Brother Brandham preaches in future
[1:22:49] home. I'm just preaching to you this
[1:22:52] morning. I feel the presence of the Lord
[1:22:53] here today. I believe you're listening.
[1:22:57] When brother Brandon preached future
[1:22:58] home, HE HE PREACHES THIS LONG SERMON
[1:23:00] AND HE GETS KIND OF TOWARDS THE END OF
[1:23:02] IT. HE SAID, "AS I SEE THE WORD
[1:23:03] VINDICATING ITSELF, HE SAID, I KNOW
[1:23:06] BEYOND ONE SHADOW OF A DOUBT, THE JEWELS
[1:23:08] OF MY CROWN WILL OUTSHINE EVERYTHING IN
[1:23:10] THE WORLD AT THAT DAY."
[1:23:13] That's us.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED. I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T
[1:23:16] WANT TO ADMIT IT, BUT WE'VE BEEN
[1:23:18] IMPACTED BY THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, BUT
[1:23:19] I SAY LET IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE
[1:23:22] IMPACTED BY HIS LIFE. LET MY LIFE BE AN
[1:23:24] IMPACT TO SOMEBODY.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO HAVE A CROWN OF REJOICING WHEN
[1:23:28] I GET THERE.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz I led someone to the Lord. How about
[1:23:33] you today?
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; A crown of glory. In 1 Peter 5:2,
[1:23:38] Peter says, "Feed the flock of God which
[1:23:39] is among you, taking the oversight
[1:23:40] thereof, not by constraint, but
[1:23:42] willingly, not for filthy lucer, not for
[1:23:44] money, but of a ready mind, a
[1:23:46] willingness to do what needs to be done.
[1:23:50] Neither is being lords over God's
[1:23:51] heritage, but being examples to the
[1:23:53] flock." Goes with what we said last
[1:23:55] week. A minister has to be an example.
[1:23:57] He said, "And when the chief shepherd
[1:23:59] shall appear, you shall receive a crown
[1:24:02] of glory that fadeth not away."
[1:24:07] But we know this is not limited just to
[1:24:08] preachers. I believe there's a crown of
[1:24:10] glory for those who are faithful to the
[1:24:13] flock, but here it's not limited just to
[1:24:15] preachers. He said, "Remember Esther was
[1:24:17] chosen and the others was rejected."
[1:24:19] Esther come by and read my notes the
[1:24:21] other day and she said, "I like that."
[1:24:26] SHE SAID ESTHER WAS CHOSEN AND THE
[1:24:28] OTHERS WAS REJECTED AND ONLY THOSE
[1:24:31] THAT'S BORN AGAIN THAT'S GOT THE SPIRIT
[1:24:33] OF GOD WILL BE THE CHOSEN THAT DAY THAT
[1:24:35] THE CROWN OF GLORY
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; will be set upon her head. Oh, this
[1:24:40] isn't just a preacher message. This is a
[1:24:42] bride message.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He said and the others will be rejected.
[1:24:48] What are we going to do with our crowns?
[1:24:51] What what what do we attribute it to?
[1:24:54] The Bible said Revelation 4:10 that the
[1:24:55] four and 20 elders, brother Brandham
[1:24:57] said that was the elite of heaven. It's
[1:24:59] the 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs.
[1:25:02] The elite OF HEAVEN FALL DOWN BEFORE HIM
[1:25:05] THAT SAT ON THE THRONE AND WORSHIP HIM
[1:25:08] THAT LIVETH FOREVER AND EVER.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. and cast their crowns
[1:25:13] before the throne, saying, "Thou art
[1:25:16] worthy, oh Lord, TO RECEIVE GLORY AND
[1:25:19] HONOR AND POWER. FOR THOU HAS CREATED
[1:25:21] ALL THINGS, AND FOR THY PLEASURE THEY
[1:25:24] ARE CREATE AND were created." What did
[1:25:25] they do? They said, "EVERYTHING THAT I
[1:25:27] HAVE, I GIVE TO YOU. EVERY BIT OF GLORY
[1:25:29] I'VE EARNED, LET ME GIVE IT BACK TO
[1:25:31] YOU." I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WAY WE OUGHT
[1:25:32] TO BE THIS MORNING. IF YOU'VE LIVED A
[1:25:34] LIFE BEFORE GOD, THAT CAN ONLY BE THANKS
[1:25:36] TO HIS GRACE. YES.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; THOU ART WORTHY, OH LORD. AND THEY CAST
[1:25:39] their crowns at his feet.
[1:25:43] Now, we're coming to the close of
[1:25:45] another year. Wednesday night will be
[1:25:47] the last night of the year. So, you
[1:25:50] could come to to this. I I apologize for
[1:25:52] being disjointed today. I hope that you
[1:25:53] get what I'm talking about. I'm not
[1:25:55] speaking very well,
[1:25:57] but the the filming is almost over.
[1:26:01] Can you see that?
[1:26:03] Like if there's a reel that says 2025,
[1:26:06] Wednesday night it cut. It's put in the
[1:26:08] can.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; It's a wrap.
[1:26:13] See, I wonder what the movie looks like.
[1:26:18] We're we're about to see a great drama
[1:26:20] unfold. Did you know that?
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells us there's one
[1:26:24] great event that's ever t greatest event
[1:26:26] that's ever taken place is at hand right
[1:26:28] now.
[1:26:29] We're standing on the brim,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Watching a drama
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; being set.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; He calls it God's great drama. We're
[1:26:39] standing on the brim watching a drama
[1:26:43] being set. He said, "I'VE MANY TIMES
[1:26:45] WATCHED MOVIES HOW IN HOLLYWOOD AND IN
[1:26:47] DIFFERENT PLACES SETTING THEIR DRAMAS."
[1:26:50] SO, he's watching them make a movie,
[1:26:53] right? He said SETTING THEIR PROMISE AND
[1:26:55] HOW THEY TAKE THEIR STARS AND THEIR SO
[1:26:58] FORTH AND FIX THEM AROUND. I didn't just
[1:27:00] come up with this out of thin air. HE
[1:27:03] SAID THEY TAKE THEIR STARS AND FIX THEM
[1:27:05] AROUND. HOW THEY TRAIN THEM AND
[1:27:06] EVERYTHING BEFORE THE GREAT DRAMA TAKES
[1:27:08] PLACE. HE SAID I'M ALWAYS AMAZED at
[1:27:10] watching it and knew it had to be a
[1:27:12] counterfeit.
[1:27:14] So he said, in other words, if they're
[1:27:15] doing this, there must be something like
[1:27:17] this that takes place in the spiritual
[1:27:20] world.
[1:27:22] He said, "ALL COUNTERFEIT THINGS ARE
[1:27:23] MADE OFF OF REAL ONES. THERE CAN'T BE A
[1:27:25] BOGUS TOLERANT UNTIL THERE'S A REAL ONE.
[1:27:26] There can't be a hypocrite unless
[1:27:27] there's a real Christian. THERE CAN'T BE
[1:27:29] A FALSE MESSAGE UNLESS THERE'S A TRUE
[1:27:30] ONE. THERE CAN'T BE A NIGHT UNLESS
[1:27:32] THERE'S A DAY." HE SAID, "AS I WATCHED
[1:27:34] THEM SET THEIR DRAMAS, I THOUGHT, OH, WE
[1:27:35] ARE STANDING WAY YONDER ON THE TOWER FAR
[1:27:38] ABOVE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD. AND WE'RE
[1:27:40] WATCHING TWO OF THE GREATEST THINGS.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Will you stand with me AS WE GET READY
[1:27:44] TO CLOSE TODAY AND WATCH THIS GREAT
[1:27:46] DRAMA THAT'S ABOUT TO UNFOLD?
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; 2025 IS COMING TO AN END.
[1:27:51] LET'S WATCH THIS GREAT THING TAKING
[1:27:52] PLACE. THERE WILL BE TIME NO MORE.
[1:27:54] MUSICIANS, GO AHEAD AND COME AND THE
[1:27:55] COMING OF THE LORD AND THE ANTICHRIST.
[1:27:56] HE HAS HIS SUBJECT SITTING THERE. LET'S
[1:27:59] LOOK DOWN NOW. HE HAS THE COMMUNISM. HE
[1:28:01] HAS DIFFERENT ISISMS. HE HAS CHURCHISM.
[1:28:02] HE HAS CATHOLICISM. HE HAS
[1:28:03] PROTESTANTISM. HE HAS EVERYTHING SET TO
[1:28:05] MAKE A GREAT SHOW. BUT I'M SO GLAD
[1:28:08] THERE'S A FATHER IN HEAVEN WHO HAS HIS
[1:28:10] CHARACTER SET, TOO.
[1:28:12] SO, IT'S NOT JUST THAT THERE'S A DRAMA
[1:28:15] GOING TO TAKE PLACE ON THE EARTH AND THE
[1:28:18] ANTICHRIST IS GOING TO DO WHAT HE DOES,
[1:28:20] BUT THE FATHER HAS A GREAT DRAMA THAT
[1:28:23] WE'RE WATCHING IT TAKE PLACE AS WELL. HE
[1:28:26] SAID WHEN THE ANTICHRIST TAKES him into
[1:28:27] the decease of everything, EVEN TO TIME,
[1:28:31] GOD IS READY IN HIS DRAMA TO LIFT HIS
[1:28:34] CHURCH INTO ETERNITY into the blissful
[1:28:36] REALM OF THE ETERNAL WITH GOD HIMSELF.
[1:28:40] He said, "WHEN THESE OLD VILE BODIES
[1:28:42] WILL BE CHANGED AND MADE LIKE HIS OWN
[1:28:43] GLORIOUS BODY, THIS CORRUPTION SHALL
[1:28:45] TAKE ON IMMORTALITY IN HIS LIKENESS WE
[1:28:48] WILL STAND FOREVER."
[1:28:50] OH, can you see it, church? Can you LOOK
[1:28:53] OVER THE BRIM AND SEE IT? LIKE KENNY
[1:28:55] SAID, "THERE'S A GREAT DRAMA BEING SET.
[1:28:57] ANGELS ARE STANDING OVER THE SKIES
[1:28:59] WATCHING." YOU KNOW WHAT A DRAMA IS? THE
[1:29:01] ACTORS ARE READY. YOU CAN SEE THEM
[1:29:03] ACTING. You can see the evil ONE ACTING.
[1:29:05] YOU CAN SEE THE VILLAIN OF THE PLAY,
[1:29:08] RIGHT? You can see the devil at work.
[1:29:09] How many has seen it? YOU CAN SEE THE
[1:29:11] GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE. HOW HE COMES ON
[1:29:13] THE SCENE WITH HIS CUNNINGNESS TO
[1:29:14] DECEIVE. But you can also SEE THE
[1:29:16] RAPTURED CHURCH MAKING HERSELF READY.
[1:29:19] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. It's a great
[1:29:21] scene. YOU CAN SEE THE PRESENCE OF GOD
[1:29:24] VINDICATING AND MAKING THE GREAT DRAMA
[1:29:25] AS FORETOLD HERE IN THIS BIBLE TO ACT
[1:29:27] ITSELF OUT. WHAT A TIME TO LIVE. THE
[1:29:30] MOST GLORIOUS TIME. THE MAN OF ALL AGES
[1:29:32] HAS LONGED FOR THIS TIME. The prophets
[1:29:34] of old long to see this hour. It wasn't
[1:29:37] privilege.
[1:29:39] Hallelujah.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah. What do you say? I'm
[1:29:45] watching this take place and
[1:29:49] what what can I do?
[1:29:54] I see the evil one working.
[1:29:58] I see God working. Well, just be a part
[1:30:01] of what God is doing. Lord, what's my
[1:30:04] part?
[1:30:06] Maybe you're older today and you in this
[1:30:08] great drama, you play a certain part.
[1:30:09] You say, "Well, I can't play the part I
[1:30:11] used to." But don't quit the play.
[1:30:13] You're still in God's great art drama.
[1:30:16] You're still an actor in the drama. You
[1:30:18] still have a part, right? HE'S GOT IT
[1:30:21] SET UP FOR YOU TO PLAY. YOU YOUNG
[1:30:22] PEOPLE, THERE'S A PART FOR you to play.
[1:30:24] And your part is more important than
[1:30:26] it's ever been CUZ WE DON'T KNOW HOW
[1:30:27] MUCH LONGER we'll be here. GIVE YOUR
[1:30:29] HEART TO THE LORD TODAY. DON'T WAIT TILL
[1:30:31] TOMORROW. LET HIM EDIT THE TAPE TODAY.
[1:30:34] LET HIM GET RID of anything that's
[1:30:35] unlike him. LET HIM TAKE IT AWAY FROM
[1:30:37] YOU TODAY. LET HIM CUT OFF ALL THE
[1:30:39] SURPLUS. Give yourself completely to
[1:30:42] him. You can see the evil one acting.
[1:30:44] YOU CAN SEE THOSE THINGS HAPPENING. BUT
[1:30:46] WE ALSO SEE A BRIDE GETTING DRESSED,
[1:30:48] getting ready for the coming of that
[1:30:51] day.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah.
[1:30:54] What do you have to do? Stand for him.
[1:30:59] Die to yourself and be faithful to
[1:31:00] death. The curtain drops when the
[1:31:03] director says that's a wrap. You be
[1:31:05] ready at that time.
[1:31:09] If you'd bow your heads with me for just
[1:31:10] a moment. Will they play softly?
[1:31:14] Bow your heads with me for just a
[1:31:16] moment.
[1:31:19] I want us to think about it. 2025. We're
[1:31:21] coming to the end now.
[1:31:25] What needs to be edited from the tape?
[1:31:31] what needs to be washed from our
[1:31:33] conscience.
[1:31:34] Why don't you just ask him, Lord, would
[1:31:36] you forgive me?
[1:31:38] Help me to go into a new year and
[1:31:41] in a better way, not to turn over a new
[1:31:44] leaf, but Lord, I want to be washed by
[1:31:46] the water of the word.
[1:31:49] Every time I come to the house, God,
[1:31:50] take out that old temper. Lord,
[1:31:53] take it out of me.
[1:31:55] Take out that old bitterness that's in
[1:31:57] my heart, that ungodliness, that
[1:31:59] worldness. Take it out, Lord. I don't
[1:32:01] want to be that way.
[1:32:04] Would you just ask him this morning, men
[1:32:06] and women, boys and girls, deacons,
[1:32:08] trustees, preachers, no matter who you
[1:32:11] are, just ask him today, Lord, edit my
[1:32:13] tape.
[1:32:15] I want to be right.
[1:32:18] Lord, TAKE WASH ME. I KNOW YOU'VE WASHED
[1:32:20] MY SINS. THE ATONEMENT IS SUFFICIENT IN
[1:32:23] MY LIFE, BUT LET it be washed even FROM
[1:32:25] MY OWN CONSCIENCE. LET THE CONDEMNATION
[1:32:28] cease in my life and the VOICE OF THE
[1:32:30] ACCUSER. HE'LL ALWAYS ACCUSE, BUT YOU
[1:32:32] DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN to him. Let it be
[1:32:34] washed from you today by the water of
[1:32:37] the word. Well, I pray he'd grant it
[1:32:39] today. Heavenly Father, Lord, we all
[1:32:42] stand in this place,
[1:32:44] Lord, you spoke of a man by the name of
[1:32:47] Daniel Curry, an evangelist. The Lord
[1:32:49] the prophet spoke of him and he said
[1:32:51] that
[1:32:52] when he went he had a dream that he went
[1:32:54] before your throne
[1:32:56] when he did they didn't find his name in
[1:32:58] the book and he went looking and said
[1:33:01] what do I do he said well you can appeal
[1:33:03] to the great white throne
[1:33:05] and when he went to APPEAL TO THE GREAT
[1:33:07] WHITE THRONE judgment
[1:33:09] said they asked him have you ever told a
[1:33:10] lie he said he thought he'd been pretty
[1:33:12] truthful but Lord there in your presence
[1:33:16] he said I realized I had told many
[1:33:18] things that weren't true.
[1:33:21] He said, "I" He said, "Daniel Curry,
[1:33:23] have you ever have Have you ever stolen
[1:33:26] anything?" And he said, "I thought I'd
[1:33:28] been pretty good and hadn't taken
[1:33:30] something that wasn't mine, but that day
[1:33:32] I stood before that light and that great
[1:33:35] dove." And he said, "Well, I guess I've
[1:33:39] stolen God's time,
[1:33:43] Lord." And he said in the dream he was
[1:33:44] just about to hear those words, "Depart
[1:33:46] from me, you that work iniquity." He
[1:33:49] said the sweetest voice that he ever
[1:33:50] heard, spoke and said, "Father, on earth
[1:33:53] he stood for me." Today I'm standing for
[1:33:57] him.
[1:33:58] Lord, you promised in your WORD THAT IF
[1:34:00] WE WOULD STAND FOR YOU that you would
[1:34:02] stand for us. So we're STANDING FOR YOU
[1:34:04] TODAY WITH our arms raised to you. Lord,
