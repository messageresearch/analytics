[49:32] into something the more you get out of
[49:34] it and
[49:35] and i know most of you i know some of
[49:36] you heard a real good preacher this
[49:38] morning and then some of you heard
[49:39] brother andrew as well
[49:41] and
[49:42] they didn't get that brother ben did
[49:43] they
[49:45] didn't get that did they all right well
[49:47] praise the lord
[49:49] if you've got your bibles turn to job
[49:50] chapter 23
[49:53] and verse 10
[49:55] job chapter 23 verse 10. i try not to
[49:57] hold you very long i can't stand up too
[49:59] long
[50:01] i had a little fall and uh
[50:03] but i feel really i actually feel a lot
[50:04] better i tell you i'll tell you this i
[50:06] sit there this morning and i believe
[50:08] sister jane i don't know if is
[50:09] voluntarily or involuntarily but she
[50:11] touched me on the shoulder
[50:13] and when she did i actually started
[50:15] feeling better right then
[50:17] and i want to thank you sister jane for
[50:19] that act of faith and you never know
[50:23] and when she did that i thought of a
[50:24] testimony
[50:25] brother allen's struggling with the
[50:27] drums and things and and i believe
[50:29] you know who prayed for him and such and
[50:32] and uh that came to mind and i thought
[50:33] of that and that'll build your faith
[50:35] you just never know what you're doing
[50:36] when you do something like that you
[50:38] don't know what you're doing for
[50:38] somebody but i appreciate that
[50:41] and i thank the lord for his healing
[50:42] don't you
[50:43] amen
[50:45] job chapter 23
[50:47] and verses 10
[50:49] but he knoweth the way that i take when
[50:51] he hath tried me i shall come forth as
[50:53] gold
[50:54] my foot hath held his steps his way have
[50:57] i kept and not declined
[51:00] neither have i gone back from the
[51:01] commandment of his lips i have esteemed
[51:03] the words of his mouth more than my
[51:05] necessary food and one more place first
[51:09] peter
[51:10] chapter one
[51:12] we'll read just a few verses there
[51:16] first peter chapter one verse three
[51:19] he said blessed be the god and father of
[51:21] our lord jesus christ which according to
[51:23] his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[51:26] again unto a lively hope
[51:28] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[51:30] the dead
[51:31] to an inheritance incorruptible
[51:33] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[51:36] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[51:38] by the power of god through faith unto
[51:40] salvation
[51:42] ready to be revealed in the last time
[51:44] wherein you greatly rejoice though now
[51:47] for a season if need be ye are in
[51:49] heaviness through manifold temptations
[51:51] that the trial of your faith
[51:53] being much more precious than gold
[51:56] that perisheth though it be tried with
[51:58] fire might be found unto the praise and
[51:59] honor and glory at the appearing of
[52:02] jesus christ you may be seated may the
[52:04] lord have his blessings to the reading
[52:05] of the word
[52:07] i was just on a little thought
[52:09] today of
[52:11] testings and trials and and they come to
[52:13] us and sometimes they come and
[52:15] and it just gets you down makes you feel
[52:18] the blues just a little bit
[52:20] and
[52:20] we all have them
[52:22] every one of us have tests and trials
[52:25] and brother branham talks about this
[52:27] here
[52:28] he said god doesn't make any difference
[52:29] between his children
[52:31] every son that cometh to god must first
[52:33] be tried or chastised
[52:35] first be tried or chastened corrected
[52:38] child trained schooled everyone not one
[52:40] exception
[52:41] every son he said have you went through
[52:44] trials
[52:45] have you went through tribulation
[52:47] have you suffered persecution
[52:49] then you'll endure these things you are
[52:52] real children of god
[52:53] but when you can't bear chastisement
[52:55] when the rod comes down heavy and you
[52:57] run off and back into the world the
[52:58] bible said your illegitimate children
[53:00] are not the children of god for when a
[53:01] man's born of the spirit of god he
[53:04] expects those things
[53:06] and he loves
[53:07] those things now that's a hard pill to
[53:09] swallow right there
[53:10] it's hard to say
[53:12] in the trial
[53:13] that i love this trial
[53:15] it's hard to say when everything's going
[53:17] wrong i just i tell you what i'm having
[53:19] the time of my life
[53:20] but really that's when god is making
[53:22] something out of you
[53:24] and he says it like this there there was
[53:27] back in the in the medieval times they
[53:28] talked about when the goldsmith would
[53:30] take the gold and he would beat the gold
[53:32] and he would and he would beat it until
[53:33] he could see his reflection in it and
[53:35] that's where i kind of got this thought
[53:37] today
[53:38] if we are in the trial he is beating us
[53:41] and getting off all the all the the the
[53:43] black and things that would smear over
[53:45] the gold until he can see his reflection
[53:47] in us
[53:48] and so many times we look at the trial
[53:50] and we don't think the trial is for any
[53:52] benefit but all things work together for
[53:55] the good to those that love god you say
[53:58] why did this happen or why did this
[54:00] happen well i tell you today i believe
[54:01] it's like this i believe that the trial
[54:04] happened for a reason and i believe
[54:05] according to the word of god we need to
[54:08] counter all joy when we go through the
[54:09] sufferings like that because in the
[54:11] moment it may not feel very good but
[54:13] we'll come out smelling like a rose
[54:16] and i think sometimes brother branham
[54:17] says like this he says i think we
[54:19] ministers making a little too much of a
[54:20] flowery bed of ease for the convert
[54:23] oh come to christ everything is lovely
[54:25] but you see it isn't like that he said
[54:27] in a way he said that's saying that
[54:29] everything is flowering because no
[54:30] christian the bible said all that lived
[54:32] godly in christ jesus
[54:34] shall suffer persecutions he said if
[54:36] you're not suffering persecutions for
[54:38] christ's sake then there's something
[54:40] wrong can you say amen to that if if the
[54:43] world is just really on your side and
[54:45] telling you how good you're doing and
[54:46] how great you are you might want to
[54:48] check up with the word one time all that
[54:50] live godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[54:52] persecutions he said if you're not
[54:54] suffering persecutions for christ's sake
[54:56] there's something wrong if the devil
[54:57] ain't after you brother he's got you
[55:00] that's all he said because as long as
[55:02] he's after you that's a sign he hasn't
[55:04] got you yet
[55:05] i don't believe he's going to get you
[55:06] either because i think we've got the
[55:08] devil on the run today
[55:10] because we satan he's always going to
[55:12] try to get in there and remember satan
[55:15] is really good at his job and when he
[55:17] knows he can't get you at one area
[55:19] because you've you've put up the shield
[55:21] of faith in front of you and you've
[55:22] you've kind of you've found out hey this
[55:24] is where satan likes to tip me this is
[55:25] where he likes to get me you really you
[55:28] uh you put some stuff there in front of
[55:29] that you put the word in front of the
[55:31] devil and he can't get you no more but
[55:33] then you realize that that he's got
[55:35] another tactic and sometimes you don't
[55:37] recognize it until after he's already
[55:38] snuck in there and that's where we have
[55:40] to come to the place to recognize and
[55:43] have the faith to overcome at that time
[55:45] he said but it but if he hasn't if he
[55:47] isn't after you he hasn't he a sign he
[55:49] hasn't got you he said so just remember
[55:51] as long as he's blasting at you you're a
[55:53] few jumps ahead of him he said just keep
[55:55] on going but all that live godly and
[55:58] christ shall suffer he said rejoice and
[56:00] be exceedingly glad for so persecuted
[56:03] they the prophets which was before you
[56:05] he said don't go with a hang down face
[56:07] and say well i ought to have done it i
[56:10] guess he said i just can't stand for
[56:12] somebody to talk to me and say i'm
[56:13] old-fashioned i'm this that or the other
[56:15] he said oh you should be exceedingly
[56:17] glad and happy because of it because you
[56:19] can bear the reproach of his name and he
[56:22] said by keeping his commandments it
[56:24] caused you to do that what we hear this
[56:26] morning stay with the word stay with the
[56:28] pure word and if you'll stay with the
[56:30] word it'll make you act odd to the world
[56:32] but that's the way god wants to see you
[56:34] tonight because maybe if you're odd to
[56:36] the world you're exactly where god wants
[56:38] you and because you suffer persecutions
[56:41] you young people at school when they
[56:43] laugh at you for your long hair they
[56:45] laugh at you for your long dresses
[56:46] remember you are suffering for christ's
[56:48] sake but you're just a little just a
[56:50] little step away from a place where
[56:52] you're going to be in perfect unity with
[56:54] christ and it won't you won't be laughed
[56:56] at no more but you will take on his
[56:58] righteousness amen you will be one of
[57:00] his
[57:01] what they have here is just temporary
[57:04] it's glamorous it's something that may
[57:05] look good for a while but remember the
[57:07] end thereof is death
[57:09] it just looks good it's a false mirage
[57:12] brother brahm talked about you go out in
[57:13] the desert and you'll see it looks like
[57:15] you see water and you go and you get to
[57:16] the water and it's not there it looks
[57:18] good to the world to live and sin for a
[57:20] season but remember it's just a false
[57:22] mirage you young people remember when
[57:25] you see it looks good and and they'll
[57:27] make sin look so good advertisements
[57:29] will make smoking look good or it used
[57:30] to and and maybe they'll make wearing
[57:33] these immoral clothes they'll make it
[57:34] look good but remember in the sight of
[57:36] god that is just it's filthy rags but
[57:39] remember today that we are more than
[57:41] able to overcome what satan has in this
[57:44] hour
[57:45] do you believe that we were built for
[57:47] this
[57:48] we were put here for a purpose today
[57:50] he said if you'll ever notice a lily
[57:52] where it comes from right out of the
[57:54] bottom of the slimy pit of the pond and
[57:56] it toils day and night
[57:58] and to get itself to the light but when
[57:59] it gets to the light blooms out the most
[58:02] beautiful flower there is anywhere
[58:04] that's what a lily is it comes up from
[58:06] the dirt of the earth and the filth
[58:09] that's where the jewels are found
[58:11] wrapped up out here in this gold state
[58:12] of the nation where you find gold down
[58:15] in the dirt where do you find rubies and
[58:17] jewels in the muck in the dirt just
[58:19] exactly right that's where we all come
[58:21] from
[58:22] but we know where we are now we can look
[58:25] back and say i was there
[58:27] i was in the bottom of that pond and you
[58:29] couldn't see the beauty yet but now i
[58:31] have come forth and you can see me as
[58:33] the lily and you can see what god has
[58:35] done in my life why because he changed
[58:38] you from what you were you are no longer
[58:40] stuck in the muck and the filth of the
[58:42] pond but you have come forth you have
[58:44] pushed your way through why because you
[58:46] stayed in the word you believed what god
[58:48] said was good for you and you stayed
[58:50] with it he said but he said i'm he said
[58:52] i'm a prospector what does a prospector
[58:54] do he hunts for gold he said then when
[58:57] he does he shines it and he beats it and
[58:58] he smells and he gets it ready remember
[59:00] he has to do that to show the real value
[59:03] and show the beauty of the gold so when
[59:05] you're going through a trial just
[59:07] remember this remember that there is a
[59:09] purpose in that trial there may be
[59:11] something in your life that has to be
[59:12] trimmed off a little bit so that you can
[59:14] become the full beauty beautiful piece
[59:17] of gold that god has for you to be
[59:19] remember it's not just oh flowery bed of
[59:21] ease but there has to be a test before
[59:24] there can be a testimony
[59:26] before there could ever be a testimony
[59:28] of healing you have to go through a
[59:29] sickness before there could ever be a
[59:31] testimony of salvation there had to be
[59:34] someone lost before there could be a
[59:36] savior that had to go through more than
[59:38] any of us could ever bear to think of
[59:40] going through
[59:41] there had to be someone lost for him to
[59:43] come back and save
[59:45] think about it today we think well my
[59:46] trial is too much
[59:48] think about what he went through for you
[59:50] he went through everything for you he
[59:53] was beat and he was bruised so that what
[59:56] you go through is nothing compared to
[59:57] what he went through but we get so soft
[1:00:00] and and we give up so easy
[1:00:02] we get we give up at the littlest battle
[1:00:05] we say well maybe it's not worth being
[1:00:07] in the message if i have to be
[1:00:08] persecuted like that but it is worth it
[1:00:11] to the overcomer
[1:00:13] to the overcomer will i give the kingdom
[1:00:16] to the overcomer how many overcomers are
[1:00:18] here today
[1:00:20] that's what he's coming for
[1:00:22] is the overcomer
[1:00:24] he said see as i said at the beginning
[1:00:26] you are born defeated you were born
[1:00:29] a defeated person
[1:00:31] he said and that that birth can never
[1:00:32] bring you to life because you're born
[1:00:34] defeated you're in a defeated world
[1:00:37] amongst defeated people amongst defeated
[1:00:39] creeds
[1:00:40] defeated denominations you've got to
[1:00:42] come to victory
[1:00:44] some way
[1:00:45] so how do you get to this victory
[1:00:48] through a test
[1:00:49] he wants to test you to see if you'll
[1:00:51] come out remember job had to be tested
[1:00:54] job was a perfect man you can look and
[1:00:56] you can wonder why god had to put him
[1:00:57] through the test but there was a reason
[1:00:59] for the test
[1:01:00] to show that he could come forth he said
[1:01:02] the test is more precious than gold
[1:01:04] he said you've got to come to victory
[1:01:06] some way it's just like a lily and he
[1:01:08] goes through that pond lily again he
[1:01:10] said there's nothing hardly as pretty as
[1:01:12] a great big pawn lily call it a water
[1:01:15] lily
[1:01:16] how radiant it is he said now where does
[1:01:19] it come from
[1:01:20] it's a little seed down in the bottom of
[1:01:23] a muddy mucky pond and that little seed
[1:01:26] yet all the radiance that'll ever shine
[1:01:28] in it is in it right in the beginning
[1:01:31] the gold was always gold
[1:01:34] but you couldn't see the reflection in
[1:01:36] the gold until it had been beat until it
[1:01:38] had endured the persecution
[1:01:41] i hope you can see that today it's
[1:01:42] simple but god has actually put you in
[1:01:45] this spot to where you're in a world
[1:01:48] you're in the darkest of ages you are in
[1:01:50] the one where you're going to suffer the
[1:01:52] most persecution maybe
[1:01:53] there's been all kinds of persecution
[1:01:55] but we see it in this day it seems like
[1:01:56] the young people especially you fight
[1:01:58] something that is so much more than
[1:02:00] maybe they fought 30 40 50 years ago
[1:02:03] because there is more at your fingertips
[1:02:05] that will that will discourage you or
[1:02:06] that can get you in trouble but remember
[1:02:09] if you can overcome those things you
[1:02:11] will come forth
[1:02:12] as something beautiful that god has
[1:02:14] determined you to become
[1:02:16] he said remember it'll it'll he said
[1:02:18] it's black it's dirty he said it's slimy
[1:02:21] he said in that slime that it's living
[1:02:23] in yet it presses its way on through the
[1:02:26] mud and the waters and the stagnant
[1:02:28] places until it sticks its head above in
[1:02:30] the light
[1:02:32] how many has come to the light of the
[1:02:33] age
[1:02:34] when you stick out of the the mud and
[1:02:36] into the light when you see the light he
[1:02:39] said then it expresses what's been hid
[1:02:42] all the time
[1:02:43] so in you was a hidden seed
[1:02:46] of god that you would become but nobody
[1:02:49] could see it brother jeremy at your
[1:02:51] worst spot you were always that seed and
[1:02:54] but that seed had to become something
[1:02:57] and today you are a seed but you must
[1:03:00] become more than just the seed the seed
[1:03:03] must be expressed when it comes to the
[1:03:04] light
[1:03:05] oh i think today if we could just
[1:03:07] understand who you are you were just a
[1:03:09] seed form but when you saw the light of
[1:03:12] the age you came forth you said that's
[1:03:14] what i want that's what i've been
[1:03:16] looking for the whole time he said you
[1:03:19] said that's christ that's the word and
[1:03:21] here i am to receive it and when the
[1:03:23] light struck the seed it brought forth
[1:03:25] something beautiful out of a messed up
[1:03:28] beat up life that you were living
[1:03:30] he said i think that's an overcomer that
[1:03:33] once in sin once did things that was
[1:03:35] wrong he said don't worry about it now
[1:03:38] once did things that was wrong he said
[1:03:40] now why look back into that pawn again
[1:03:42] see why look back into that pond again
[1:03:44] see what you have now is so great why
[1:03:47] would you ever want to go back to what
[1:03:49] you were satan's going to tell you why
[1:03:52] don't you just go back and live the way
[1:03:53] you were well i mean i tell you you live
[1:03:55] in the darkness why would you want to do
[1:03:57] that church when the light is here to
[1:04:00] make you live the anointing is here to
[1:04:02] make the word live through you today
[1:04:05] he says it like this my god is able to
[1:04:07] heal me from this or my god is able to
[1:04:08] take me from this wheelchair my god's
[1:04:10] able to do this but he said i've
[1:04:11] accepted him as my healer i've confessed
[1:04:14] him i've confessed my sins my unbelief
[1:04:16] confessed that i believe that he is my
[1:04:18] healer he said let let come let go what
[1:04:21] may if not well today i will be tomorrow
[1:04:24] if not tomorrow i will be next year the
[1:04:26] lord has gave and the lord is taken away
[1:04:28] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:04:30] oh there it was when they walked into
[1:04:32] the fiery furnace under trial under a
[1:04:35] test they held true to the end how many
[1:04:38] could have the same testimony today when
[1:04:41] the testing and the trials comes we're
[1:04:43] going to hold true to the end we are
[1:04:45] going to overcome this laodicean age
[1:04:48] he said they held true to the end but
[1:04:49] god was there just in time just in the
[1:04:52] spirit of a moment and he delivered them
[1:04:55] he said he knowed that they were prayed
[1:04:57] up their sins were confessed he knowed
[1:05:00] that they had met every requirement and
[1:05:02] yet he seemed to be silent he's only
[1:05:05] silent to test you he said he's only
[1:05:08] silent to test you when it seems like
[1:05:11] your prayers are not getting answered
[1:05:12] he's still there and he's got an answer
[1:05:15] for you but he wants to see just how
[1:05:17] long you hold out
[1:05:18] let's test you just a little while and
[1:05:20] see if you're really meaning business
[1:05:22] with god remember when when buddy robin
[1:05:25] said i believe it was was there he said
[1:05:27] he was going to receive the holy ghost
[1:05:28] you'll find these bones laying here
[1:05:30] listen to me church it's like this right
[1:05:32] here he says he says he meant what he
[1:05:34] said now if i go in back room and i say
[1:05:37] i'm not coming out of here until i
[1:05:39] receive this certain thing from god if i
[1:05:41] stay there two or three hours and i come
[1:05:43] out well god didn't hear me no god knew
[1:05:44] i wasn't going to stay down long enough
[1:05:46] but if you mean business with god
[1:05:49] then god will be there he said he's only
[1:05:51] silent to test you
[1:05:53] he wants to see if you mean business
[1:05:55] he wants to see
[1:05:57] if your testimony will hold out
[1:06:00] can you be true to the end
[1:06:03] that's what he's looking for he's not
[1:06:05] looking for a part-time christian yes
[1:06:06] you'll fall down
[1:06:08] yes you'll make mistakes
[1:06:10] yes we'll do things that we regret in
[1:06:12] life
[1:06:13] but
[1:06:14] we got back up
[1:06:16] and we push forward
[1:06:18] and nothing's going to stop us from
[1:06:20] going all the way
[1:06:22] i'm going all the way with the lord
[1:06:25] he said to see really what you are
[1:06:28] what's on the inside of you to see if
[1:06:31] you really mean from your heart what
[1:06:33] you're saying with your lips
[1:06:35] he said let that go deep to see
[1:06:37] if you mean
[1:06:39] what you're saying i say i love the lord
[1:06:41] do i mean what i'm saying
[1:06:43] i say i'm going to pray more do i mean
[1:06:45] it i say i'm going to fast and pray and
[1:06:47] i'm going to read my bible do i mean it
[1:06:50] remember satan's always there he's a
[1:06:52] roaring lion he's seeking whom he may
[1:06:53] devour he's always on the job
[1:06:56] but remember greater is he that is in
[1:06:59] you than he that is in the world greater
[1:07:02] is he that is in you than he that is
[1:07:05] trying to take away your joy greater is
[1:07:07] he than that cancer that's trying to
[1:07:09] take on your body i'll tell you what
[1:07:11] greater is he than death because he
[1:07:13] overcame death
[1:07:15] he can overcome everything for you but
[1:07:17] you have to trust in him and stay true
[1:07:19] you overcome what by the blood of the
[1:07:22] lamb and by the word of your testimony
[1:07:25] we must stay with our testimony if i say
[1:07:28] i'm a message believer i don't just say
[1:07:30] that to have a title i say it because
[1:07:33] i've accepted the end time message of
[1:07:34] the hour
[1:07:35] i've taken what's true for me i've taken
[1:07:37] my inheritance today
[1:07:39] i want to be like job
[1:07:41] though god should slay me
[1:07:43] yet i'll trust him i will then come
[1:07:46] forth as gold
[1:07:48] i'm not going to be fool's gold i'm not
[1:07:50] going to get down to the end and give up
[1:07:52] but i'm going to be real true gold
[1:07:54] [Music]
[1:07:55] i believe there's real gold in the
[1:07:57] building today i believe brother branham
[1:07:59] said he was a minor i believe he was
[1:08:00] mining out the gold for the end time i
[1:08:03] believe there's going to be a rapture
[1:08:05] for this end time gold where he's going
[1:08:07] to bring us all together and he's going
[1:08:09] to take us up there and he's going to
[1:08:11] look at us and he's going to see his own
[1:08:13] reflection in you
[1:08:15] i believe just any day now we'll see him
[1:08:18] as he is and when we see him he'll look
[1:08:20] at us and he's going to see us and we're
[1:08:23] go we're going to look familiar to him
[1:08:25] because he's seen himself reflected all
[1:08:27] the time
[1:08:29] we've got to mean our testimony
[1:08:32] don't give up when your faith seems weak
[1:08:34] don't lose hope
[1:08:36] when you're weak because in the weakest
[1:08:39] hour
[1:08:40] his show up
[1:08:41] when it looked real dark
[1:08:43] when peter was out there
[1:08:45] and the waves got real high
[1:08:48] and he even doubted his own testimony
[1:08:51] that's when god showed up
[1:08:53] and he revealed himself to peter
[1:08:55] when you just feel like you can't go on
[1:08:58] any farther it's in that moment when
[1:09:00] he'll show up
[1:09:02] but if you'll just hang on just a little
[1:09:03] longer you'll realize who's on the sea
[1:09:05] with you
[1:09:06] you'll realize who's in the boat with
[1:09:08] you you'll realize who's with you the
[1:09:10] whole time you'll realize when you tried
[1:09:13] to take your life there was somebody who
[1:09:16] stopped you then when you tried to
[1:09:17] become a drunkard there was somebody who
[1:09:20] wouldn't let you go as far as your
[1:09:21] buddies went when you tried to cut your
[1:09:23] hair off somebody stopped you and maybe
[1:09:26] you did go too far but he was there to
[1:09:29] tell you i've come to take you home he
[1:09:31] was there to tell you i'm here and i
[1:09:34] want you back you are my child don't go
[1:09:37] down that road that your friends went
[1:09:38] down don't go the way
[1:09:40] of satan don't go the way he's taking
[1:09:42] you it may look flashy it may look
[1:09:45] glamorous but it's fool's gold to him
[1:09:47] that overcometh today i believe you're
[1:09:50] the overcomers in this age he didn't
[1:09:52] call just all the denominations to
[1:09:54] overcome but he called you to be the
[1:09:56] overcomer in this day
[1:09:58] don't give up when your faith gets weak
[1:10:01] don't give up when it seems like you're
[1:10:03] you're nothing
[1:10:04] you say i'm the least in the kingdom of
[1:10:06] the lord it don't matter what position
[1:10:09] you are in the kingdom be in the kingdom
[1:10:12] it don't matter if you're a doormat at
[1:10:14] the house of god be in the house of god
[1:10:16] oh yeah you say well i'm just nothing i
[1:10:18] i don't feel good enough to be down
[1:10:20] there with those people
[1:10:22] oh you're never going to feel good
[1:10:23] enough with this flesh
[1:10:25] but inside of you is a seed
[1:10:27] that is coming forth and through the
[1:10:30] test and the trial of life is becoming
[1:10:33] something to god that he sees himself in
[1:10:36] remember he is the goldsmith
[1:10:39] and he's standing there and he's beating
[1:10:41] those rough edges off of you the temper
[1:10:44] oh yeah
[1:10:45] the unforgiveness
[1:10:47] he's beating all these things off of you
[1:10:48] why because he knows that you need it
[1:10:52] not because he doesn't love you
[1:10:54] but brother branham
[1:10:56] talked about it like this in child
[1:10:57] training when your son or your daughter
[1:10:59] would go out in the street and there's a
[1:11:01] car coming it's not love to leave the
[1:11:03] child out there and say oh little johnny
[1:11:06] come back here i'll say jason come back
[1:11:08] over here and get out of the road son
[1:11:10] that car is going to kill you know if i
[1:11:12] love him
[1:11:13] i'll go out there and get him and
[1:11:15] because he didn't listen to me i'm
[1:11:16] probably gonna have to discipline him a
[1:11:18] little bit but remember it's not out of
[1:11:20] anger it's not out of hate that i'm
[1:11:22] doing it it's because i have a love for
[1:11:24] him and i know that he's meant to be my
[1:11:27] son and i know when he's in the lowest
[1:11:29] of times when he doesn't when he doesn't
[1:11:32] listen to me when he doesn't obey that's
[1:11:35] when i gotta bring him back to me and i
[1:11:37] gotta put him through something that'll
[1:11:39] tell him hey i just want you to know
[1:11:41] you're still my son i want you to know
[1:11:43] you're still mine i want you to know
[1:11:45] today church you're still a son of god
[1:11:48] you are still somebody thank you jesus
[1:11:51] just because you don't feel like it just
[1:11:53] because you feel you can't go on any
[1:11:55] farther you are more than able to
[1:11:57] overcome laodicea
[1:12:01] don't let satan steal your joy
[1:12:04] he'll get in your mind remember the
[1:12:05] greatest battle ever fought
[1:12:07] it's right there
[1:12:09] don't lose up on your faith
[1:12:11] don't give up on your faith don't lose
[1:12:12] hope
[1:12:14] he's still god and he changes not
[1:12:17] it's in the midst of the storm when he
[1:12:19] show up oh yeah
[1:12:21] it's in the midst of the storm remember
[1:12:23] there's a song i remember
[1:12:25] in he's in the midst of our storm
[1:12:27] he's in the valley we go through where
[1:12:29] two or three are gathered there i am in
[1:12:31] the midst
[1:12:32] if you could ever remember this
[1:12:35] that though
[1:12:36] god slays me
[1:12:38] think about it like that
[1:12:40] think about come on though god himself
[1:12:43] would slay me
[1:12:44] i'm still going to trust him anyway
[1:12:47] oh yeah
[1:12:48] it doesn't even seem right
[1:12:51] it doesn't seem right that that you
[1:12:52] would serve somebody who would slay you
[1:12:55] who would knock you down an arch
[1:12:58] but he had a reason for it
[1:13:00] you say well it wasn't good
[1:13:02] it didn't feel good no it's not going to
[1:13:05] feel good
[1:13:06] but it's good for you oh yes you know
[1:13:08] when god put me through a test in life
[1:13:11] i remember as a teenager when he called
[1:13:13] me i remember when he called me to
[1:13:14] preach and i said no
[1:13:16] and i remember backsliding after that
[1:13:18] because you know when when you go
[1:13:20] against god
[1:13:22] and you kind of back up and you're like
[1:13:23] i just don't want to do what god tells
[1:13:25] me to do it almost seems like then he
[1:13:27] leaves you
[1:13:29] like his presence has left you
[1:13:31] and when he left me
[1:13:32] i didn't know what to do so i got
[1:13:34] re-baptized
[1:13:35] and i'd been baptized twice already
[1:13:38] and i was 16 years old and i'm like i
[1:13:39] got to get re-baptized again because i
[1:13:41] can't i couldn't fellowship with god i'd
[1:13:43] lost fellowship lost connection
[1:13:45] and i couldn't find god and i saw i got
[1:13:46] re-baptized
[1:13:48] and i felt a call and then i thought no
[1:13:49] i'm not good enough on that you know i
[1:13:51] couldn't do that i had sinned i was a
[1:13:52] teenager and you know i thought i was
[1:13:54] really bad and then i got to know really
[1:13:56] bad kids and i was pretty good
[1:13:58] but
[1:13:59] you know how it is i was raised in a
[1:14:01] home where we we knew what was right and
[1:14:03] wrong
[1:14:04] we didn't always do what was right and
[1:14:06] we did a lot what was wrong but we we
[1:14:08] knew what was right and wrong
[1:14:09] and so little things sometimes to a
[1:14:11] christian kid
[1:14:12] is worse than some of the bad things to
[1:14:14] a bad kid right yeah if you've been live
[1:14:16] if you've been raised in the world
[1:14:18] maybe you don't your standards aren't
[1:14:20] there
[1:14:20] so you do something and maybe you won't
[1:14:22] feel bad about it but to a christian kid
[1:14:24] i remember i chewed tobacco
[1:14:26] and i and i got it out of my boss's
[1:14:28] truck and i thought i'm going to chew a
[1:14:29] little this the first time made me sick
[1:14:31] it made me real sick because i swallowed
[1:14:32] some
[1:14:33] and uh and then well it wasn't so bad
[1:14:35] i'll chew it again because i was running
[1:14:38] i was running from something
[1:14:40] running from a call that i had on my
[1:14:41] life and i i didn't want to do it but i
[1:14:43] wanted to be a christian
[1:14:44] i wanted to be a christian but i didn't
[1:14:45] want to obey what god wanted me to do
[1:14:48] so i quit doing that because the
[1:14:49] condemnation was so bad i couldn't go to
[1:14:51] church and do that at the same time and
[1:14:52] i had to go to church because i still
[1:14:53] living at home
[1:14:55] and so
[1:14:56] after that
[1:14:58] i remember
[1:14:59] i got into a worse i got into a worse
[1:15:01] worse worse than that i you know i just
[1:15:03] almost at that point i could fake
[1:15:06] religion
[1:15:07] i could go to church
[1:15:09] and i could feel the presence of god
[1:15:11] supposedly if you looked at me i looked
[1:15:12] like i was getting blessed in church
[1:15:14] and then but i could go outside of the
[1:15:16] church and just like that and flip a
[1:15:17] switch and i could i could act the part
[1:15:20] of a christian
[1:15:21] and that's a dangerous place
[1:15:23] and then i got married
[1:15:25] and don't get married in a bad condition
[1:15:26] because god's still going to put you
[1:15:28] through the trial even if you're married
[1:15:29] that don't solve all your problems
[1:15:32] it solves some of them but not all of
[1:15:33] them
[1:15:34] and
[1:15:35] when you're when you're 18 years old
[1:15:38] and you're still running from god
[1:15:40] but you think you're doing right well
[1:15:42] i'm still going to church
[1:15:44] and i thought i could have a form of
[1:15:45] godliness
[1:15:47] but i had never experienced the power
[1:15:48] just yet
[1:15:50] and i remember when i finally
[1:15:52] experienced
[1:15:53] the power of god
[1:15:55] it changed me
[1:15:57] i tried to take a step back and go into
[1:15:59] the world
[1:16:00] i tried to do some wrong things
[1:16:03] and you talk about guilt
[1:16:05] you talk about shame
[1:16:07] and it almost was like god had let me do
[1:16:09] little things
[1:16:10] and it would just make me feel so bad
[1:16:12] and i'd get closer to god every time i
[1:16:13] went i'd go back and then i'd get closer
[1:16:16] i'd go back and then i'd get closer
[1:16:18] every time i see my and i get closer to
[1:16:20] god and finally i got to a point
[1:16:22] where you know what i lost the desire
[1:16:25] to be the sinner oh yeah
[1:16:29] i had to push right
[1:16:31] the flesh might have still wanted things
[1:16:32] but there was a spirit there was a
[1:16:34] stronger than the flesh
[1:16:36] and when you work to overcome that
[1:16:39] it'll take years to overcome that
[1:16:41] sometimes
[1:16:42] maybe it's not as long for others
[1:16:44] but it's in the midst of that trial that
[1:16:46] he's putting you through that he's
[1:16:48] really molding you into something
[1:16:51] and if you look at that ring if you're
[1:16:52] wearing a gold ring on your finger at
[1:16:54] one time that was just a piece of rock
[1:16:58] and they had to beat it
[1:17:00] and beat it and it's just like a diamond
[1:17:02] right it gets the sparkle from the cuts
[1:17:04] on it
[1:17:05] it shines and it gets a glow from the
[1:17:07] different cuts on the different angles
[1:17:09] of the diamond remember it had to go
[1:17:11] through a process
[1:17:13] of time
[1:17:14] and beatings and trials
[1:17:17] and testing
[1:17:18] but there was always in the mind of god
[1:17:21] he knew what you would become
[1:17:23] he saw the diamond before you were ever
[1:17:26] a diamond he saw you when you was just a
[1:17:28] piece of rock it looked like just a
[1:17:30] piece of ordinary glass but he saw in
[1:17:33] his mind the diamond you would become
[1:17:35] and i believe today if you can just
[1:17:38] press on through the battle press on
[1:17:40] through the times you're going through
[1:17:42] you young people you may think well i
[1:17:44] just want to turn back and but remember
[1:17:45] there's always something there tugging
[1:17:47] at your heart to push you just a little
[1:17:49] farther you feel like backsliding
[1:17:51] remember there's something there to
[1:17:52] catch you you may make a mistake but
[1:17:54] he's there to grab you what is it
[1:17:56] because this morning we heard you're
[1:17:58] hanging over hell by by a chain by a
[1:18:00] thread you're hanging over hell by a
[1:18:02] thread but that thread becomes a chain
[1:18:04] when you hold onto the word of god
[1:18:07] remember that chain is there and if you
[1:18:09] hold on to the word of god with all your
[1:18:12] heart with all your might with all your
[1:18:14] strength when it feels you can't go on
[1:18:17] he'll be there to catch you he'll be
[1:18:19] there just in time he said i'll be there
[1:18:21] in the fire with the three hebrew
[1:18:23] children he said i'll be in the den when
[1:18:25] daniel's there with the lions he said
[1:18:27] i'll be there when the flood waters come
[1:18:29] and i'll have an ark of safety ready he
[1:18:31] said in the end time when there's all
[1:18:33] these pestilences and things i'll be
[1:18:35] there to protect you from them i'll have
[1:18:36] a bride that can rise above it all
[1:18:40] we are more than conquerors
[1:18:43] through christ that loved us
[1:18:45] there's this quote here and i'll bring
[1:18:47] it down i i i just about can't stand
[1:18:49] here much longer
[1:18:50] he said when it looks like everything
[1:18:52] has gone wrong
[1:18:53] god is giving you a trial
[1:18:56] he's got confidence in you
[1:18:58] he don't have to baby you around
[1:19:01] you're not a hotbed plant a hybrid
[1:19:03] you're a real christian
[1:19:05] god is giving you a test
[1:19:07] see what you'll do about it
[1:19:09] he said no wonder peter said these fiery
[1:19:11] trials why count it as a joy it's more
[1:19:14] precious to you than gold and he said
[1:19:16] many times we him and hall
[1:19:18] well if i just well that well that's
[1:19:21] something god gave to you he said to
[1:19:23] overcome
[1:19:25] thank you lord we him and hall about it
[1:19:27] why why why do we have this he said he
[1:19:29] knows he said he said well that's
[1:19:30] something that god gave to you
[1:19:33] to overcome
[1:19:34] it's for your good if we could ever get
[1:19:37] through
[1:19:38] our minds that all things really do work
[1:19:41] together
[1:19:42] for the good
[1:19:44] they really do
[1:19:45] there is some reason for everything that
[1:19:47] happens to you
[1:19:50] everything
[1:19:51] god makes no mistakes
[1:19:54] and if he allowed something to happen to
[1:19:56] you
[1:19:57] he allowed it for a purpose
[1:19:59] and that's the hardest things to accept
[1:20:01] sometimes oh i can accept the blessings
[1:20:04] i can accept the word i can accept all
[1:20:06] these things i
[1:20:07] oh man but but that trial
[1:20:10] what was that for
[1:20:11] to perfect you
[1:20:13] to bring you forth
[1:20:15] to where he could see
[1:20:17] his image in you
[1:20:19] he's testing your faith to see if you
[1:20:21] hold on to your testimony right
[1:20:23] he said that's something god give you to
[1:20:25] overcome
[1:20:26] he knows you'll do it
[1:20:29] he's put his trust in you
[1:20:34] he trusts you more than you trust him
[1:20:37] i wonder if he doesn't sometimes come on
[1:20:39] he trusts you
[1:20:43] we get in a place we think
[1:20:45] i just can't go on
[1:20:46] can you trust god
[1:20:49] can you trust in his word i'll never
[1:20:51] leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be
[1:20:54] with you until the end of the world you
[1:20:56] know when he left he sent his spirit
[1:20:59] and his spirit he said i said i'll be
[1:21:01] with you and even in you until the end
[1:21:02] of the world so he's in you he's with
[1:21:04] you it don't matter how far you go
[1:21:07] if you've ever experienced the spirit of
[1:21:08] christ if he's in you you can't go far
[1:21:11] enough that he can't reach you
[1:21:12] you can't do something bad enough that
[1:21:14] he can't bring you back
[1:21:17] he's always going to have his have his
[1:21:19] hand on you
[1:21:20] it don't matter how far your son or your
[1:21:22] daughter go from you
[1:21:24] they're always your son or your daughter
[1:21:27] it doesn't matter how many mistakes they
[1:21:29] make
[1:21:30] when you see how bad they are when they
[1:21:32] break your heart you say brother joel
[1:21:35] you've just got little kids wait until
[1:21:36] they're teenagers they may break my
[1:21:38] heart but i can tell you i've
[1:21:40] experienced love from a father
[1:21:42] and i know
[1:21:44] just how much he loved me
[1:21:46] when i did stupid things that i can't
[1:21:48] believe i did sometimes he didn't ever
[1:21:51] quit loving me
[1:21:53] and i can't quit loving them and when
[1:21:55] they go so far
[1:21:57] when that prodigal son went so far he
[1:22:00] was unrecognizable as a son
[1:22:03] he come back home
[1:22:05] and guess who did recognize him his
[1:22:07] father knew who he was
[1:22:09] his father said come on back home i've
[1:22:12] made a feast for you come on back i've
[1:22:15] got a table prepared for you
[1:22:18] come on home church
[1:22:20] it's time we quit laying there and
[1:22:21] feeling sorry for ourselves when the
[1:22:24] test is over when the battle's done
[1:22:27] i'm an overcomer and at the end of the
[1:22:30] day i'm going to sit in my father's
[1:22:32] house as a son of god
[1:22:35] at the end of the day i'm an overcomer
[1:22:37] anyway
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:22:40] i can look back and i can see every test
[1:22:42] and trial was to make me what i am today
[1:22:47] i wonder why god did you allow me to
[1:22:49] become this way in a certain area and
[1:22:51] then i went through something later in
[1:22:52] life and i realized i had to be that way
[1:22:55] to overcome something else
[1:22:57] so the first trial caused me to be to
[1:22:59] put up a guard on something in my life
[1:23:02] and then the next thing you know you go
[1:23:03] through something
[1:23:05] oh that's why i went through that
[1:23:07] that's why i had to overcome that time
[1:23:10] and then you'll see god's hand in your
[1:23:12] life he's never left you church
[1:23:15] he was there all the time
[1:23:18] you were always in his thoughts you were
[1:23:21] always in his mind and then you become a
[1:23:23] manifestation of what was in his mind
[1:23:26] when you become who he sees in himself
[1:23:29] when he looks in the mirror he sees you
[1:23:33] he sees you because his reflection is
[1:23:36] you
[1:23:38] if jesus was standing here today and he
[1:23:40] could look in the mirror he would say i
[1:23:42] see i see brother malachi in the mirror
[1:23:45] i see i see brother jeremy in the mirror
[1:23:47] and you know what you can say well i
[1:23:49] know what brother jeremy was or i know
[1:23:51] what brother malachi was well you're
[1:23:53] looking at the old man but the old man
[1:23:55] is dead and i have become something that
[1:23:58] god said i could become i am an
[1:24:01] overcomer in laodicea i am who he spoke
[1:24:04] of that could stand the test of time
[1:24:07] when so many walked away
[1:24:10] you may give up
[1:24:12] you may walk away
[1:24:14] but i'm going to stay with the word for
[1:24:15] the day
[1:24:16] you know why because he gave me
[1:24:18] something that i can't let go of
[1:24:21] you say brother joel you could let god
[1:24:23] eat to know because he's holding me
[1:24:25] he's holding me
[1:24:27] and i feel like letting go but he's
[1:24:29] holding on to me jesus is always holding
[1:24:32] your hand no matter what you're going
[1:24:34] through
[1:24:36] there was this quote i run across
[1:24:40] and i've i loved it i ran across it
[1:24:42] studying in my dad's old study bible
[1:24:44] and i was going through this week and i
[1:24:46] was reading and i saw this he had this
[1:24:47] printout from
[1:24:49] i don't know maybe 12 15 years ago
[1:24:51] and and i was looking at it
[1:24:53] he said there's one assurance the
[1:24:54] believer has
[1:24:56] though the world turned him down
[1:24:58] yet god loves him
[1:25:01] the world may call you a holy roller
[1:25:03] they may call you a fanatic
[1:25:06] but if you're true to god
[1:25:08] there's one sure thing
[1:25:10] god loves you
[1:25:11] and his angels
[1:25:13] are encamped about those who fear him
[1:25:16] he said i'd imagine on every limb
[1:25:19] all around through the place
[1:25:21] there was swarms of angels
[1:25:24] and god came down and said my poor
[1:25:26] little tired servant
[1:25:28] he's so nervous and tore up
[1:25:30] he don't know what to do
[1:25:32] he said i want to pick out the angel
[1:25:34] standing here that's got the softest
[1:25:36] hands
[1:25:37] don't scare him
[1:25:39] walk over there and stroke his brow
[1:25:41] right easy see god knows what you need
[1:25:43] when you need it he knows when you need
[1:25:45] the spanking he knows when you need to
[1:25:47] be loved gently
[1:25:49] he's the perfect parent
[1:25:51] he knows how to handle every situation
[1:25:54] he said and i want the best cook among
[1:25:57] you and go up there and get all the
[1:25:58] vitamins that you can find
[1:26:00] and put in this corn meal
[1:26:02] the world's turned him down
[1:26:05] but i'm going to treat him right
[1:26:07] he said don't get scared of hallelujah
[1:26:09] that means praise our god he said
[1:26:10] hallelujah
[1:26:11] bring forth the best that we got
[1:26:14] cook him a corn cake and set him down
[1:26:17] some water
[1:26:18] and his soft-handed angel went over and
[1:26:20] stroked the little servant of god on the
[1:26:21] brow
[1:26:22] remember if you've done your best
[1:26:25] god still got those angels in order
[1:26:28] he loves you
[1:26:30] just the same as he loved elijah
[1:26:34] he don't love you any less
[1:26:36] if you go back
[1:26:38] to that first quote we read
[1:26:40] there's no difference
[1:26:42] he said god doesn't make any difference
[1:26:44] between his children
[1:26:46] just because brother branham had a gift
[1:26:48] god didn't love him more than he loves
[1:26:50] you
[1:26:51] just because i'm standing here this
[1:26:53] morning
[1:26:54] and maybe you're sitting in the farthest
[1:26:55] back or you're the youngest child in
[1:26:57] here you're loved just as much
[1:27:00] maybe you'll never be called to preach
[1:27:02] maybe you'll never be called to be any
[1:27:04] more
[1:27:05] than what brother branham described as a
[1:27:07] doormat in the house of god
[1:27:08] but at least you're here
[1:27:10] at least you're in the house of god
[1:27:13] you say brother joel do i have to humble
[1:27:14] myself to that status
[1:27:16] at times
[1:27:17] even the ones who are called have to
[1:27:19] humble
[1:27:20] there's times when if i stand here and
[1:27:22] i've boasted myself i don't have
[1:27:24] anything to boast of but if i did and i
[1:27:25] boasted in myself watch god knock you
[1:27:27] down just a little bit
[1:27:29] remember god doesn't want you to try to
[1:27:31] put yourself above him
[1:27:32] he don't want you exalted above him
[1:27:35] he wants you to stay in your position
[1:27:37] but he loves you
[1:27:38] in your position
[1:27:40] he loves you just the way you are
[1:27:42] don't try to be more than what you are
[1:27:45] just be a good
[1:27:46] solid christian
[1:27:48] that believes the word of god i don't
[1:27:50] know why i'm talking this ain't in my
[1:27:52] notes
[1:27:53] but there's something
[1:27:54] somebody maybe needs to hear this you're
[1:27:56] discouraged because you're not doing
[1:27:57] enough
[1:27:59] maybe you need to do more
[1:28:01] but wait on the lord
[1:28:03] let god have his way in your life today
[1:28:07] god is never out he's never out there
[1:28:10] and got his eyes off you remember he
[1:28:12] sees every sparrow
[1:28:14] if he sees every sparrow if he knows if
[1:28:16] his eye is on the sparrow then i know
[1:28:19] he watches me
[1:28:20] thank you can you stand this afternoon
[1:28:23] and i wonder if there's someone here
[1:28:25] that feels like you're not enough
[1:28:28] his musicians would come
[1:28:31] remember when you've done your best
[1:28:33] god still got his angels in order
[1:28:37] he loves you just the same
[1:28:40] can you hold on
[1:28:42] through the trial of your faith
[1:28:46] i believe if you're here today then
[1:28:47] you've held on through some trial
[1:28:49] you've held on
[1:28:50] you've stayed true to your testimony
[1:28:53] and god will honor
[1:28:55] that stand today do you believe that
[1:28:58] i believe god is going to honor your
[1:28:59] faith
[1:29:00] because remember when you've done your
[1:29:02] best
[1:29:03] when you feel like i can't go on any
[1:29:04] farther

[1:29:08] today

[1:29:11] when you want him to
[1:29:13] but he'll be there right on time do you
[1:29:15] believe it
[1:29:16] he'll be there right on time
[1:29:18] when the storm is at its worst
[1:29:21] when it feels like
[1:29:22] all hell is against you
[1:29:25] he has raised up a standard
[1:29:28] and he's raised up something to
[1:29:30] withstand every dart of the enemy today
[1:29:33] can you take on
[1:29:34] the shield and the breastplate and arm
[1:29:37] yourselves with all the things that god
[1:29:39] has for you today amen if you play
[1:29:41] something softly can we bow our heads
