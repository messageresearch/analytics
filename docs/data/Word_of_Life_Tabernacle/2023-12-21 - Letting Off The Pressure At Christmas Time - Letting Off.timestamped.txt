[40:28] not the obvious stories because we
[40:31] didn't have a very much Christmas as a
[40:34] child and wasn't because we were poor it
[40:37] was because we made life difficult for
[40:39] ourselves with the way we interpreted
[40:41] things with the message at at Christmas
[40:44] time and so we uh we always got
[40:47] something from our parents but it wasn't
[40:50] I don't have a lot of Christmas Memories
[40:52] in that way and so Christmas is special
[40:54] to me now but I do have have a memory
[40:57] that reminds me of Christmas and it's
[40:59] actually a memory of going out in the
[41:01] yard one time and and uh having to catch
[41:04] a rooster for Mom because Dad wanted
[41:06] fried
[41:07] chicken and we had to catch this rooster
[41:10] and I'll never forget that I don't think
[41:12] we ever had to do it again in fact the
[41:14] meat was really tough I I just say if
[41:16] you have a rooster and keeping it for
[41:18] that it may not be the best thing let
[41:20] him run all over the yard and get old so
[41:23] the meat was really tough but what I
[41:25] remember about that is chasing that
[41:27] thing down and uh and and what we do is
[41:30] we' ring its neck and uh not to be too
[41:33] graphic tonight but we'd ring the
[41:34] thing's neck and and pull it off and so
[41:38] when the neck come off uh what surprised
[41:41] me at the time is that the rooster
[41:43] didn't stop
[41:44] running this is a Christmas story so
[41:47] just let me get through it
[41:49] tonight and the rooster just kept
[41:52] running around and around the yard and
[41:54] I'll never forget that as long as I live
[41:56] the blood just spurting up out of where
[41:58] the where the head was and and he just
[42:00] going in circles he got no purpose it's
[42:02] always reminded me of Christmas
[42:05] time because some folks just lose their
[42:08] heads at
[42:12] Christmas and I think that we need to
[42:15] look at the message of the hour and and
[42:17] I thank God for the light that he's
[42:19] shown on our day that helps us keep our
[42:21] balance at Christmas time and where we
[42:23] don't lose our
[42:25] heads and the birth of Christ I think
[42:29] the Bible says peace on Earth and Good
[42:31] Will toward men but it's a season and
[42:35] that we celebrate his birth in this
[42:36] season though we know he wasn't born on
[42:38] December 25th and yet his birth That
[42:41] season that we celebrate that often
[42:43] brings disappointment and loneliness and
[42:47] pressure and we find that uh they find
[42:51] that about 64% of people with mental
[42:53] illness say that the holidays make their
[42:56] conditions worse and they found that
[42:58] three out of five Americans feel that
[43:01] their mental health is negatively
[43:03] impacted by the holidays and and that's
[43:06] kind of the time that we're living in
[43:08] and it's a time when they're running
[43:10] around like a chicken that's lost its
[43:12] head and and they're constantly buying
[43:14] and doing and and it seems like American
[43:17] response now to everything is buy more
[43:20] right right it doesn't matter what it is
[43:22] war buy more is it famine buy more is it
[43:26] is it scarcity is it economic distress
[43:28] just buy more get a credit card and and
[43:31] spend on it and it just seems to be a a
[43:33] consumer age it's a neurotic age brother
[43:37] brandham preaches a message called
[43:39] letting off the pressure talking about
[43:41] his age and how neurotic it was oh if he
[43:44] could have only lived to see
[43:46] 2023 but he talked about it being
[43:49] neurotic and he said we're living in a
[43:50] neurotic age he said nervous tension
[43:54] everybody is racing here and going there
[43:57] and going nowhere sounds like Christmas
[43:59] doesn't it it sounds like Walmart
[44:02] really he said it's just to that kind of
[44:04] an age he said I know this church would
[44:07] be plagued with it it's everywhere it's
[44:08] plagued with it the Tabernacle is
[44:10] plagued with it everywhere the whole
[44:12] world said it's a day of pressure hurry
[44:15] hurry hurry hurry up and wait I've been
[44:18] thinking a lot about this lately in
[44:19] regards even to Ministry it's not how
[44:22] much we do or or how many times we
[44:24] preach or anything like that but it's
[44:26] being able to uh to get across what God
[44:29] puts on her heart it's it's the ability
[44:32] to impact someone's life in a positive
[44:35] way how can we do that more is not
[44:37] always more more is not always better
[44:41] but we live in this day of pressure
[44:42] hurry hurry hurry up and wait Drive 90
[44:44] miles an hour and and get home for
[44:46] supper and wait two hours till it gets
[44:48] ready say that's right it's a time in
[44:50] that rushing and speeding it gets you to
[44:52] a nervous tension he said the wife say
[44:56] something a little contrary you want to
[44:57] fly off temper husband say something I
[45:00] know this isn't talking about yall but
[45:02] we'll just talk about my house for a
[45:03] minute husband say something you'll
[45:06] patch your foot and tell him to get in
[45:07] the room say well now husband I don't I
[45:10] don't want no words with you get out
[45:12] there wife oh I'm so nervous see why
[45:16] what's the matter all this together this
[45:19] tension building up he said then the
[45:21] results of it is doing something wrong
[45:24] and acting out of place and many times
[45:27] if we would change our environment we
[45:30] would get different results if we would
[45:32] change our atmosphere we would get
[45:35] different results I know young people
[45:36] many times in they fail in certain ways
[45:39] different ways that a young person might
[45:41] fail in and they and they just keep
[45:43] failing in that way and and keep messing
[45:45] up and think well what could I do well
[45:47] it's not really so much the thing as it
[45:50] is the atmosphere that's causing it and
[45:52] you find yourself in an atmosphere of
[45:54] defeat and an ATM osphere where it feels
[45:57] like that you just can't make it and
[45:59] everything is is going wrong and and
[46:01] everything begins to go get out of
[46:02] culture and you need to hear the voice
[46:04] of God but what your body and and what
[46:06] your mind tells you you need is
[46:08] something
[46:10] else what you really need is to hear the
[46:12] voice of God you need I don't want to
[46:15] get into Sunday's sermon but you need to
[46:17] hear the voice of God speaking in that
[46:19] chaos to bring order out of chaos and
[46:23] that's what the world heard at Christmas
[46:25] time was the voice of Jehovah they heard
[46:28] the voice of Jehovah was heard it was
[46:30] more than just a baby in a Manger but
[46:32] the voice of God spoken a time of
[46:35] chaos and that's what we need but many
[46:37] times we we we turn to other things and
[46:40] and so but if we could just change the
[46:42] atmosphere sometimes you don't even need
[46:43] to study and read your Bible though
[46:46] that's good but sometimes you just need
[46:47] to get out and take a walk or go do
[46:49] something and spend some time with
[46:51] friends be around church people and be
[46:53] around people that that are not negative
[46:55] negative and dragging you down all the
[46:57] time and I know sometimes family gets
[47:00] that way at Christmas time sometimes you
[47:02] just got to get away and and get in a
[47:04] different atmosphere amen so and so what
[47:08] we want to do is is we don't want to be
[47:10] like what he's describing here he said
[47:12] you begin to act this tension builds up
[47:15] and then the results of it is doing
[47:16] something wrong and acting out of place
[47:20] he said it'll make the poor act that way
[47:21] it'll make the middle class act that way
[47:23] it'll make the rich act that way it'll
[47:25] make the wrong act that way it'll make
[47:28] the pretty good act that way it'll make
[47:30] the good act that way and you get a
[47:33] whole bunch of saints and sinners all
[47:35] acting the same right church people and
[47:39] non-church people yeah message people
[47:42] and and
[47:43] Baptist right all acting the same you
[47:46] say why do they act like that brother
[47:48] Ben why are they so why are they not
[47:50] different because they're human beings
[47:52] and in this time of pressure tension
[47:54] builds up and there there's got to be an
[47:56] outlet there's got to be some way that
[47:58] we let off the pressure and I'm so glad
[48:00] we have a place of Refuge today I'm so
[48:02] glad we have a place we can go to and
[48:04] let off the pressure at Christmas
[48:07] time he said it'll make the good act
[48:09] that way because it's tension steam
[48:12] built up listen the very best Saint here
[48:15] tonight if you I put you in the right
[48:17] conditions you're going to snap back at
[48:20] me right the very best Saint if given
[48:24] the right conditions you you know in
[48:26] your own home some of you some of you
[48:28] couples you never fight but given the
[48:30] right conditions you could say something
[48:32] you didn't mean given the right
[48:35] conditions the boiler might blow up he
[48:37] said because it's tension steam built up
[48:40] got to blow it out somewhere he said no
[48:42] we find it builds up as the day goes you
[48:44] talk to your boss if you're working oh
[48:47] so and so if you speak to the kitty come
[48:48] in here mama I'm if there you are it
[48:51] builds it up and I'll say this for men
[48:54] who who are not working sometimes you're
[48:55] off at Christmas time or maybe you're in
[48:57] between jobs or something like that if
[48:59] you don't have a set task to do and you
[49:01] get up in the morning that's the worst
[49:03] time to be a man because actually that
[49:06] builds up pressure you retire and you're
[49:08] under pressure right because you feel
[49:11] like you should be doing something you
[49:13] should be being productive maybe you get
[49:14] sick and you're unable to work like you
[49:16] used to and and it's just pressure
[49:18] constantly and I think sometimes wives
[49:20] don't really understand that and I'm not
[49:22] I'm not just preaching at you wives but
[49:24] you need to understand that a man was
[49:25] made to go out and make a living and
[49:27] work and and do those things and it's
[49:29] hard to sit at home and have nothing to
[49:31] do you want to do something and if not
[49:33] you build off you bu build up pressure
[49:36] and pretty soon you you you meant to
[49:38] stay home together and and and and and
[49:40] spend quality time together I don't know
[49:42] why I'm saying this tonight but you you
[49:44] meant to stay home spend quality time
[49:45] together and what you end up doing is
[49:47] fighting
[49:49] together right and then you're ready for
[49:51] him to leave and he's ready for you to
[49:52] leave but there's a way to deal with the
[49:54] pressure yes well brandom said there you
[49:57] are he said he said it builds it up he
[49:59] said oh my see you feel like you're
[50:01] going to your head is going to come off
[50:03] he said I know I'm with it every day he
[50:06] said I don't know how his wife felt
[50:07] about that but he said so I know what it
[50:10] means he said it builds
[50:13] up it builds up and how many can say
[50:15] Amen to that we still live in this time
[50:18] of pressure how do we deal with pressure
[50:22] I think the most pressure that a man
[50:23] could be under would be in a fear for
[50:26] his
[50:26] life and the Bible describes someone and
[50:29] brother brandom uses it in this sermon
[50:31] and you can find in numbers 35 I won't
[50:33] go and read it because to save time
[50:35] tonight but you'll find that the Bible
[50:37] describes a man uh who had inadvertently
[50:40] killed someone maybe he had through uh
[50:43] uh some fault that something that he had
[50:45] done that he didn't realize was going to
[50:47] happen maybe maybe in a moment of uh
[50:50] just uh he didn't mean to hit them that
[50:51] hard and something happened and it
[50:53] basically what we would call today
[50:54] manslaughter
[50:56] and and if a person did that he knew
[50:59] this person's family was going to come
[51:01] get him and under the law they had a
[51:03] right to wouldn't that be something if
[51:05] our legal system worked that way where
[51:07] the families of all the people that were
[51:08] bereaved could actually come after the
[51:10] person that did the crime well there may
[51:13] be less crime
[51:14] but and and so they would have an
[51:17] Avenger of blood there would be somebody
[51:18] designated in the family to come after
[51:21] this person and so now as they the
[51:25] amount of pressure that this man must
[51:27] have been under here he's killed someone
[51:29] he didn't mean to he's made a horrible
[51:31] mistake he made an awful mistake and
[51:34] there's nothing he can do to change it
[51:36] because once you take a life that's it
[51:38] it's over and so he's going through this
[51:41] tremendous pressure and yet the law
[51:43] provided a way for him to go to a place
[51:47] where there would be a a letting off of
[51:49] the pressure there would be a City of
[51:51] Refuge that he could reach that he could
[51:54] go to they they put six cities all
[51:55] through the land of Israel and those
[51:58] those cities would be a place of refuge
[52:00] and so immediately if it happened he
[52:02] would know where that place was and he
[52:04] would immediately run as hard as he
[52:06] could go for a City of Refuge because he
[52:08] knew if he didn't he was going to get
[52:11] killed so now he had to go into that
[52:15] place now brother brandom tells us about
[52:16] that he said then the nervous neurotic
[52:19] age that you're living in he said you
[52:21] know in all of this the doctors don't
[52:22] have the answer because they're plagued
[52:24] with it too' they don't have the answer
[52:26] they don't know what to do you realize
[52:27] that that the psychologist has the same
[52:30] problem you do and the doctor has the
[52:32] same problem that you do right he deals
[52:35] with the same things that you deal with
[52:37] I'll go a little bit further the pastor
[52:38] the preacher deals with the same thing
[52:40] you deal with we don't like to admit it
[52:42] all the time but we we we're all under
[52:44] the same pressure he said they don't
[52:46] know what to do oh doctor I'm just about
[52:48] to blow blow my head I don't know what
[52:49] to do well he'd say I am too well
[52:52] there's nothing you can do he'd give you
[52:53] a tranquilizer when that wears off
[52:55] you're more nervous than you was in the
[52:56] first place he said like a drunk man
[52:58] taking an extra drink to get over his
[53:00] drunkenness he said see you can't do it
[53:02] there's no answer they don't have it but
[53:04] God has the answer he said and that's
[53:06] what we want to talk about he is the
[53:08] answer Christ is the answer to every
[53:10] problem you've got and I want to say at
[53:12] Christmas time when the pressure builds
[53:14] up and it seems like you're just running
[53:15] around like that rooster with your head
[53:17] cut off and running around doing nothing
[53:19] when it seems like you getting nothing
[53:21] done go into Christ come into the city
[53:24] of refuge and let him be the one who
[53:27] lets off the pressure for you let him be
[53:30] your safe
[53:32] place well brother BR said I want to say
[53:35] something to the people here he said if
[53:36] you're not a Christian I come to the
[53:37] City of Refuge about 31 years ago and
[53:41] brother he said I've never wanted to go
[53:43] out oh I come into Christ everything
[53:45] that I longed for was in here he said I
[53:47] don't want to go out I pray daily oh God
[53:50] I'm so happy here just let me say see
[53:52] the one that went into the City of
[53:53] Refuge had to be willing to to remain
[53:55] there cuz if he ever stepped foot back
[53:57] outside he was fair game
[54:00] again he said I never want to leave and
[54:02] I know he will never leave me I know
[54:04] he'll never leave you and the pressure
[54:05] gets great if it does he is our Outlet
[54:07] so we don't have to worry about it he
[54:10] said if you're all pressured up and
[54:12] don't know where you're going what's
[54:13] going to happen to you after death and
[54:15] you know you're going to die sometime
[54:17] you've got it to do then the thing to
[54:19] come is come to Christ The Refuge and
[54:21] let off the pressure settle it once for
[54:25] am and I I just want
[54:28] to encourage you tonight as we're going
[54:30] to go and make a little turn here and go
[54:33] a little bit different direction but I
[54:34] want to encourage you if you've not come
[54:36] into Christ do that M make sure that you
[54:39] found the City of Refuge make sure you
[54:41] have a place to run to because you may
[54:43] try to live like a Christian and act
[54:45] like a Christian try to be the very best
[54:47] Christian You Can Be You may make
[54:48] everybody think that you are one but if
[54:50] you're not in Christ the pressure will
[54:52] get to you one of these days right you
[54:55] might as well just surrender to him and
[54:57] say Lord let let me be in you let me let
[54:59] me be a part of the word let me be a
[55:02] part of your
[55:03] bride you have to be completely
[55:05] surrendered to him I heard brother
[55:07] brandham talking and God's gifts always
[55:08] find their places he said he said the
[55:11] only gift that he wants is a surrendered
[55:13] life the gift that he wants is all of us
[55:15] he said if you're just in the church and
[55:17] and you just say well I'm going to make
[55:18] it a social Gathering or something like
[55:20] that I'm just going to go to church
[55:21] that's not what he wants at Christmas
[55:23] time he wants you he wants all of you if
[55:27] you're just going to be a social
[55:28] Christian the pressure is going to get
[55:29] to you before long yes a lot of pressure
[55:33] in this age and it's going to get to you
[55:35] but I'm so glad we have a City of Refuge
[55:38] yes he said no matter what takes place
[55:40] Christ is our refuge and when we come to
[55:43] him we can let off the pressure you can
[55:45] quit worrying about well if I die what's
[55:47] going to happen to me what's going to
[55:49] happen to the wife what's going to
[55:50] happen to the husband what's going to
[55:51] happen to the children just come to
[55:53] Christ and let off the pressure he said
[55:55] all he gives us all things all things
[55:57] are ours by Christ so just let the
[56:00] pressure off the only one way you can do
[56:02] it now brother brand say something
[56:04] strange here he say somebody might give
[56:06] you a million dollars it' build up
[56:10] pressure and you think about that and
[56:12] you think well if I just had more money
[56:14] at Christmas time I'd be better off well
[56:17] you might just have more
[56:20] pressure he said you might join a church
[56:23] and still build up pressure cu the
[56:25] Methodist will tell you they're right
[56:26] and the Baptist is wrong and the Baptist
[56:28] say they're wrong and we're right it
[56:30] just builds up more pressure CU you
[56:32] don't know where you're standing but if
[56:34] you ever come to Christ you can let off
[56:36] the pressure cuz it's all over then he
[56:39] said just settle it down it's God's
[56:41] provided place of safety where God said
[56:43] the name of the Lord is a mighty tower
[56:45] the righteous run into it and are safe
[56:47] in a time of sickness when sickness
[56:48] strikes and the doctor says there's
[56:50] nothing else I can do about it he said
[56:52] don't build up pressure those that are
[56:54] sick tonight maybe you're watching or
[56:55] you're here and you've not been feeling
[56:57] well let off the pressure believe he's
[56:59] your healer tonight he's our refuge he
[57:02] said while you're in this Refuge you've
[57:04] got a right to anything that's in the
[57:05] Refuge and Christ is our refuge and
[57:08] everything you have need of is in
[57:12] him
[57:16] now and I appreciate your prayers
[57:18] tonight I want to take a little bit of a
[57:20] turn before we
[57:23] close and I want to look at some of the
[57:25] things that the message teaches
[57:28] us that would help us take off the
[57:31] pressure at this time of
[57:34] year now where is the City of Refuge
[57:37] what is it it's Christ right what is
[57:40] Christ he is the
[57:42] word and and the message of the hour is
[57:45] the light that shines on the word for
[57:47] our day so it reveals Christ to us so we
[57:53] have in the message a picture of what
[57:56] God would want at Christmas time of what
[57:59] the Bible says and and what what should
[58:02] actually happen at Christmas time and so
[58:05] we don't want to look to anything else
[58:06] we want to look to the message of the
[58:08] hour and don't don't get nervous I know
[58:10] it kind of tightened up there a little
[58:11] bit I'm not going to rebuke you I'm not
[58:14] going to get on to you I just want us to
[58:16] look at some things that brother
[58:17] brandham taught us about Christmas and
[58:20] positive and maybe some negative but
[58:22] just some things that he taught us
[58:23] because we we need to understand this
[58:25] time of year especially we need to find
[58:27] that City of
[58:29] Refuge and first of all you're not going
[58:31] to find that in the tensil of
[58:34] Christmas christ is not found in the
[58:37] tinsel of Christmas more is not always
[58:41] better and you don't have to compare
[58:43] with everybody else to have fun at
[58:46] Christmas or to worship at Christmas or
[58:48] enjoy Christmas whatever that means to
[58:51] you you don't have to you don't have to
[58:54] be what everybody else says you have to
[58:56] be CU most of them are just trying to
[58:57] make money off of
[58:59] you but the ROM talks about Christmas
[59:02] tensely all the tinsel up and down the
[59:03] street of Santa Claus a German fiction
[59:06] Catholic dogma he said there's not one
[59:08] ounce of it true it takes the place of
[59:10] Jesus Christ in the hearts of too many
[59:13] Americans Christmas don't don't mean
[59:15] Santa Claus Christmas Means Christ now
[59:18] remember this is our refuge our safe
[59:21] place right and you don't find safety by
[59:24] by stepping as far as you can out in and
[59:26] we're going to go just as far as we can
[59:27] outside the wall and just keep an eye on
[59:30] the city no that that you can't feel
[59:32] safe like that how do we find our safety
[59:35] by staying within the boundaries of the
[59:37] word right that's our City of Refuge so
[59:40] he says Christmas don't mean Santa Claus
[59:42] Christmas Means Christ not some man with
[59:44] a pipe coming down the chimney he said
[59:46] and he said teaching your children and
[59:48] such as that what do you expect them to
[59:50] grow up to be he said tell them the
[59:51] truth not some fictitious story tell
[59:54] them there's a God Of Heaven who sent
[59:56] his son and That's What Christmas
[1:00:00] Means that's what brother Brandon taught
[1:00:02] Christmas Means so I uh what we did and
[1:00:05] and what many message people did you you
[1:00:07] remember what we did is we SE we
[1:00:09] separated Christmas from
[1:00:12] God and we said well Christmas is Pagan
[1:00:15] so now we're going to separate that from
[1:00:17] God and then Christmas is just something
[1:00:19] we have to do for the kids but but we
[1:00:22] won't mention it at church we won't have
[1:00:23] it at church but that's not what a
[1:00:25] prophet did right brother brandom always
[1:00:28] preached a Christmas sermon in fact it'd
[1:00:30] take some pressure off of you if you go
[1:00:31] listen to some of those at Christmas
[1:00:34] time sermons like God's wrapped gift and
[1:00:36] God's gifts always find their places and
[1:00:39] the great Shining Light and and and why
[1:00:41] it had to be Shepherds and why little
[1:00:43] Bethlehem and and so many of those
[1:00:45] sermons that means so much to
[1:00:47] us but but brother brandham tells us he
[1:00:50] doesn't tell us to ignore Christmas
[1:00:52] right or we'll see in a minute not to
[1:00:55] make it Pagan but to actually say what
[1:00:58] Christmas is really
[1:00:59] about right he said tell them the truth
[1:01:02] not on some fictitious story tell them
[1:01:04] there's a God of heaven and That's What
[1:01:06] Christmas Means he's near coming again
[1:01:08] he said as the pressure begins to come
[1:01:09] to the earth now listen the pressure
[1:01:12] begins to come to the Earth he said the
[1:01:14] devil has put out his things by eyes
[1:01:16] what you can see the tinsil and so forth
[1:01:19] God has put out his which is spirit that
[1:01:21] you can't see but you believe so you
[1:01:24] need to look at the
[1:01:26] Unseen now remember they ask at that
[1:01:29] time and this is another sermon that
[1:01:31] brother P preached where is he King of
[1:01:32] the Jews and they' asked him they' asked
[1:01:35] the the people in Jerusalem where is he
[1:01:37] and they didn't know but they were led
[1:01:39] by that great Shining Light and brother
[1:01:42] brand said Jerusalem had not the answer
[1:01:45] of where Christ was Jeffersonville
[1:01:47] doesn't have the an Louisville doesn't
[1:01:49] America doesn't the world doesn't God
[1:01:51] has the answers and he's promised that
[1:01:54] he would manifest them he said and I
[1:01:56] declare to you that that same Jesus who
[1:01:58] was born 1900 years lives today from the
[1:02:01] resurrection is the same yesterday today
[1:02:03] and forever so what can we do to let off
[1:02:05] the pressure at Christmas time we can
[1:02:07] realize that Christ is not found in the
[1:02:09] tenil of
[1:02:13] Christmas I believe that the message
[1:02:14] teaches us that Christmas should not be
[1:02:16] a pagan
[1:02:19] celebration in fact brother BR we don't
[1:02:21] celebrate Christmas we we worship at
[1:02:22] Christmas time
[1:02:25] in the early church the controversy
[1:02:26] wasn't Christmas trees as it is today
[1:02:29] and I'm not going to go fully into that
[1:02:31] but you all understand that I think and
[1:02:35] but it was eating food that been
[1:02:36] dedicated to an idol you I don't that
[1:02:38] doesn't mean anything to us but to them
[1:02:40] it was a real it was a real
[1:02:42] problem whether or not you should eat
[1:02:43] food that been dedicated to an idol and
[1:02:46] here's what Paul says about that and I
[1:02:47] think it applies to a lot of things
[1:02:49] around
[1:02:50] Christmas Paul says this he said as
[1:02:52] concerning therefore the eating of those
[1:02:53] things that are offered in SA sacrifice
[1:02:54] to Idols we know that Idol is nothing
[1:02:58] now there's a
[1:03:00] revelation and that there's no other God
[1:03:02] but
[1:03:03] one he says for though there there be
[1:03:05] that are called Gods whether in heaven
[1:03:07] or in earth as there be Gods many and
[1:03:09] Lords many but to us there is but one
[1:03:13] God the father of whom are all things
[1:03:16] and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:19] by whom are all things and we by him he
[1:03:22] said how be it there is not in every man
[1:03:24] that knowledge for some with conscience
[1:03:27] of the idol into this hour eat it as a
[1:03:29] thing offered to an idol and their
[1:03:31] conscience being weak is defiled I'll
[1:03:34] say this whatever you do at Christmas
[1:03:36] time do it in faith am don't do
[1:03:38] something that condemns
[1:03:40] you right at Christmas time and we said
[1:03:43] this even about Co when it come to
[1:03:44] taking the vaccine or not and everybody
[1:03:46] was one side or the other whatever you
[1:03:48] do you have to do in
[1:03:50] faith if you go to the doctor and you
[1:03:52] don't go in faith believing he can help
[1:03:53] you won't won't do you any
[1:03:55] good right if you come to church and
[1:03:57] don't do it in faith believing that
[1:03:59] something at the church will help you it
[1:04:00] don't do you any good just showing up is
[1:04:02] admirable but there's so much more than
[1:04:04] that that we could gain if we just
[1:04:06] believe God's got something for us if we
[1:04:08] could look past the man standing behind
[1:04:09] the ppit if we can look past all the
[1:04:11] idiosyncrasies of of the pastor or the
[1:04:14] preacher or whatever and we can see that
[1:04:16] Christ wants to speak to us he wants to
[1:04:19] talk to
[1:04:20] us so whatever we do we must it must be
[1:04:23] done in faith
[1:04:25] if it offends your conscience don't do
[1:04:27] it and and and try not to offend other
[1:04:30] people's consciences within limits
[1:04:31] here's where Paul sets to limit he says
[1:04:34] Romans 14:1 him that is weak in the
[1:04:36] faith receive ye in other words don't
[1:04:38] kick him out of the church because he
[1:04:39] got a different idea about these things
[1:04:41] than you do but not to doubtful
[1:04:44] disputations other words don't argue
[1:04:45] with him on Facebook that's the new
[1:04:47] revise
[1:04:52] fing so receive the the one who's weak
[1:04:55] who doesn't have the faith to maybe do
[1:04:57] what you can do right and that applies
[1:05:00] to different areas in our life don't
[1:05:02] don't don't throw it in his
[1:05:04] face don't don't be rude but not to
[1:05:07] doubtful disputations don't argue about
[1:05:09] it don't don't let people put pressure
[1:05:12] on you because you do this for Christmas
[1:05:14] or don't do this or don't don't stop
[1:05:17] giving those Idols power to
[1:05:20] talk
[1:05:22] right and and everybody wants to talk
[1:05:23] about Jeremiah 10 and what that has to
[1:05:26] do with Christmas it has nothing to do
[1:05:27] with Christmas and you know how I know
[1:05:30] cu the Vindicated Prophet didn't say
[1:05:31] anything about
[1:05:33] it and but but people talk about
[1:05:36] Christmas that being Christmas tree or
[1:05:37] whatever what it was was an idol but
[1:05:40] quit giving that Idol power to talk if
[1:05:42] you've invested in the power of an idol
[1:05:44] you do need to stay away from it but
[1:05:47] that don't mean that don't matter what
[1:05:48] it is it may be a car it may be a job it
[1:05:50] may be your spouse may be your preacher
[1:05:52] it may be the church but don't don't
[1:05:54] don't make it an idol if you got a
[1:05:57] problem with worshiping it bring it to
[1:05:59] my house I don't have a problem with
[1:06:00] that
[1:06:02] so I won't have to buy
[1:06:06] one what do the prophet say about about
[1:06:09] these things about not making Christmas
[1:06:11] Pagan I don't want to get too specific
[1:06:12] tonight but just to kind of give us an
[1:06:14] idea kind of let the pressure off a
[1:06:16] little bit the brand said from them
[1:06:18] first little Christmases when we hang up
[1:06:20] our stockings and Mama would get said
[1:06:22] we'd probably get an orange and two
[1:06:23] three little piece a striped candy and
[1:06:25] that was a great Christmas to us he said
[1:06:27] but you know kids they look forward for
[1:06:28] them gifts he said we find out that
[1:06:31] Christmas is mainly children he said
[1:06:33] they look forward to that now nowadays
[1:06:35] it's turned off to the children but now
[1:06:37] listen he said but it really should be
[1:06:41] adults he said they should be teaching
[1:06:43] their children what real Christmas
[1:06:46] is so you can if you're somebody gets on
[1:06:49] to you being Liking Christmas too much
[1:06:50] you say well brother Brandon said
[1:06:52] Christmas is for adults
[1:06:56] right but he said he should be teaching
[1:06:58] their children what real Christmas is
[1:07:00] and again it couldn't have been on
[1:07:01] December 25th we know that was the time
[1:07:04] that the Romans had their festival and
[1:07:06] things like this and brother brandom
[1:07:07] goes through all of that and in uh and
[1:07:09] God's gets find their places he goes
[1:07:11] through all that in many places and when
[1:07:13] when he does but he comes to this
[1:07:15] conclusion he says but what difference
[1:07:17] does it
[1:07:18] make right he said see today he said
[1:07:21] even if they was doing it in July or
[1:07:23] August or whatever it might be he said
[1:07:25] it's still the sacredness of remembering
[1:07:27] that God gave us the hope that we have
[1:07:29] in
[1:07:30] us and now you say well the rest of them
[1:07:32] is all Santa Claus and going on like
[1:07:34] they do why we just might as well do it
[1:07:36] he said no sir no this is not a pagan
[1:07:39] celebration to us this is a sacred hour
[1:07:43] if there had been no Christmas there
[1:07:45] would be no Resurrection if there had
[1:07:47] been no Christmas there'd be no love
[1:07:49] there'd be no peace there'd be no
[1:07:50] Hereafter for the believer if there had
[1:07:52] been no Christmas
[1:07:54] he said now you say well it's the rest
[1:07:56] of the world they just well he said 'w
[1:07:58] see the forked lightning and the black
[1:08:00] Cloudy Skies show that there can be
[1:08:02] light in the time of Darkness now I know
[1:08:04] people who who will give their children
[1:08:06] gifts on Thanksgiving because they don't
[1:08:08] want to attribute it to being a
[1:08:10] Christmas gift and I I don't I'm not
[1:08:12] going to knock them for doing that
[1:08:14] they're doing what they feel that is
[1:08:16] right and and want to offend their own
[1:08:18] conscience but I'll say this that
[1:08:21] brother brandham taught us that we
[1:08:22] celebrate Christmas at Christmas time
[1:08:25] because that's when it's the darkest
[1:08:28] that's when it's the most Pagan and
[1:08:30] that's the time that we should say this
[1:08:32] is not this is not what it's about but
[1:08:36] there's a light that come in our day
[1:08:37] that told us he wasn't born on December
[1:08:39] 25th but he was born and he was wrapped
[1:08:42] in flesh deity came down and was wrapped
[1:08:46] in a baby and wrapped in flesh and
[1:08:48] Jehovah cried out and spoke to the World
[1:08:51] on Christmas Christ was born at
[1:08:53] Christmas just not on December the
[1:08:58] 25th now look he said see the forked
[1:09:02] lightning and the black Cloudy Skies
[1:09:04] show that there can be light in the time
[1:09:05] of Darkness these lights tonight prove
[1:09:07] that there can be light in the time of
[1:09:08] darkness when does light shine its best
[1:09:11] in darkness he said you turn these
[1:09:13] lights in daytime the sun is shining he
[1:09:15] said you'll hardly notice they're on but
[1:09:17] just one little we light will shine real
[1:09:19] bright in a time of Darkness so I say
[1:09:21] well let's let's go ahead and and talk
[1:09:23] about Christ at Christmas time and let
[1:09:25] the world know there's still somebody
[1:09:26] who believes in the real meaning of
[1:09:29] Christmas he said right now is the
[1:09:31] darkness when every Christian should
[1:09:33] give a testimony of the hope that's in
[1:09:34] him of Jesus Christ the son of God not
[1:09:37] some Chris cringle that was born back
[1:09:38] Yonder and some kind of a tree lit up
[1:09:40] and went down through the forest one
[1:09:41] night some fiction story there's no
[1:09:43] bottom to it but we believe solidly on
[1:09:45] the promised word of God of a coming
[1:09:47] Messiah he was born on Christmas
[1:09:50] day right not not December 25th but he
[1:09:54] was born on Christmas day he said pretty
[1:09:56] near 2,000 years ago we believe amen
[1:09:59] does that give you comfort today does
[1:10:01] that give you let off the pressure a
[1:10:02] little bit at Christmas
[1:10:05] time I'll say this I think this would
[1:10:07] help us to let off the pressure I got
[1:10:10] just a few more
[1:10:12] minutes I I think if we'd stop spending
[1:10:14] money on things that we don't
[1:10:17] need money we don't have I say this if
[1:10:20] you have money spend
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:25] got real quiet I don't care what you do
[1:10:28] with your money you can save it if you
[1:10:31] want to you can spend it if you want to
[1:10:33] that's not what my job not to tell you
[1:10:35] what to do with your money but I'll say
[1:10:36] this stop spending money you don't have
[1:10:40] am because all that's going to do is
[1:10:41] build up pressure at Christmas does a
[1:10:42] message talk about that yes brother
[1:10:45] brandham gave gifts and accepted gifts
[1:10:48] at Christmas but he didn't try to give a
[1:10:51] gift to every person that gave him one
[1:10:53] and I I'm just going to place myself on
[1:10:55] record tonight that if you buy me a gift
[1:10:58] I may get you a gift and I may not
[1:11:00] because that's what I believe about
[1:11:02] Christmas that it should be the
[1:11:03] generosity of your heart not just
[1:11:05] because somebody else did it and then
[1:11:07] You' got to do it and and and make it
[1:11:09] like that brother brandom taught us not
[1:11:11] to do that he spoke against swapping
[1:11:13] gifts and so what that means is like
[1:11:15] well I got to buy them something they
[1:11:17] bought me something and so you're buying
[1:11:18] stuff you don't have the money you don't
[1:11:20] you're getting stuff you don't want
[1:11:21] giving stuff you don't want right kind
[1:11:25] of like the gift card
[1:11:26] Racket and I do give gift cards but it's
[1:11:29] it is kind of a
[1:11:30] racket and but he also spoke against he
[1:11:33] spoke against two things swapping gifts
[1:11:35] and giving inappropriate
[1:11:36] gifts and I don't mean that you can't
[1:11:38] have a game and swap gifts I mean that
[1:11:40] for the purpose of one uping one another
[1:11:43] and trying to trying to uh being under
[1:11:47] pressure because you don't have the
[1:11:48] right thing to
[1:11:49] give we should give appropriate gift did
[1:11:52] you know that brother brandham taught
[1:11:53] that an appropriate gift for a little
[1:11:54] girl was a baby
[1:11:56] doll that's what he said an appropriate
[1:11:59] gift ell likes that I'm sure an
[1:12:02] appropriate gift for a little girl is a
[1:12:03] baby doll at Christmas that's what he
[1:12:06] taught us when he told the story about
[1:12:07] the man that went out in the cold and
[1:12:09] his baby had died it's a it's a terrible
[1:12:11] story but he told talked about how he
[1:12:13] went out and he trying to find her a
[1:12:14] baby doll and he ended up freezing to
[1:12:16] death he gave us all BR said it's like
[1:12:18] Christ gave us all at Christmas gave us
[1:12:21] all come to the Earth and gave us all oh
[1:12:24] my but we want appropriate gifts
[1:12:28] appropriate gifts it may be a doll for a
[1:12:30] little a little girl but it may be just
[1:12:32] something appropriate something we can
[1:12:34] afford I I'll I'll say that and I'm not
[1:12:37] the example at Christmas I'm not because
[1:12:39] I I was chuckling today we went to
[1:12:41] Walmart before church because I had to
[1:12:43] pick up something on the way and there's
[1:12:44] a man in the aisle and he's walking down
[1:12:46] the aisle and he's muttering to himself
[1:12:47] and he he grabs a he grabs a uh a little
[1:12:51] coloring book off of the thing and
[1:12:53] throws it in his cart and say that's
[1:12:54] about enough Christmas for
[1:12:58] today he heads on down the aisle but
[1:13:01] Allen I could see myself right there
[1:13:04] man I usually buy Christmas presents on
[1:13:07] Christmas Eve I'd buy it Christmas Day
[1:13:09] if I could afford it brother Caleb's
[1:13:12] right there with me but or if the places
[1:13:15] were open to buy it but we want
[1:13:17] appropriate gifts and I'll say this most
[1:13:19] years that not every year but most years
[1:13:21] we've spent less than $50 a piece on our
[1:13:24] kids for Christmas don't be pressured
[1:13:26] into spending money you don't
[1:13:29] have but give something appropriate if
[1:13:31] you're going to give something I'll tell
[1:13:33] you what would be appropriate for us to
[1:13:35] give ourselves to Christ at Christmas
[1:13:38] time the BR said God spoke that word
[1:13:40] this son would be there where he was to
[1:13:42] make it shine he said there was that
[1:13:43] Heavenly visitor they was watching and
[1:13:45] speaking to the wise men and come right
[1:13:47] straight to it so they left the old
[1:13:49] Creed and started on the supernatural
[1:13:51] again away they went he said how they
[1:13:54] rejoiced the Bible said they rejoiced
[1:13:56] with exceeding great joy when they saw
[1:14:00] that light come again he said oh brother
[1:14:02] sister how nice it would be if each one
[1:14:04] of you if each one of us me if each one
[1:14:07] of us could lay aside all this here
[1:14:09] Christmas tinsel and and quit all this
[1:14:11] swapping gifts one with another all this
[1:14:13] nonsense of the world just take off our
[1:14:15] pride and lay it down Stomp the thing
[1:14:16] under foot and say Lord Jesus guide me
[1:14:19] to that Perfect Light could we do that
[1:14:21] tonight could we let off the pressure
[1:14:24] and say Lord guide me to that Perfect
[1:14:26] Light he said watch something
[1:14:28] Supernatural happen the holy spirit will
[1:14:30] come in a phenominal way he said on they
[1:14:33] went following the supernatural what did
[1:14:35] they leave they followed the Heavenly
[1:14:36] sign of that day he said Remember the
[1:14:38] god Heavenly god-given sign he said all
[1:14:41] of you believe that's true that was a
[1:14:42] Heavenly god-given sign they followed
[1:14:44] that sign till they found the word made
[1:14:46] flesh he was the word made flesh the
[1:14:48] Heavenly sign promised of that day LED
[1:14:50] them to the word made flesh brother
[1:14:52] sister he'll do the same Den
[1:14:53] this great sign from Heaven that we have
[1:14:55] the Holy Spirit living among us follow
[1:14:58] it amen again he said watch the gift
[1:15:01] these wise men brought to him he said
[1:15:03] today we find that we're swapping gifts
[1:15:05] everybody has to get a gift that's what
[1:15:07] he means by swapping gifts doesn't mean
[1:15:08] you can't give gifts or receive gifts
[1:15:11] but he said everybody has to get a gift
[1:15:12] and try to figure out what the next
[1:15:13] Fell's going to give him so he can give
[1:15:15] him something comparing that much he
[1:15:18] said if it isn't well in New Years he
[1:15:19] feels he has to make it up each one
[1:15:21] studying and worrying and walking the
[1:15:23] floor the millionaires how they're going
[1:15:24] to get by they give so much to this one
[1:15:26] and that when it's altogether wrong he
[1:15:28] said here there's only one gift that you
[1:15:30] can give and that's yourself give
[1:15:33] yourself to God because God's already
[1:15:35] give you his gift he said now there's
[1:15:37] only thing you owe back to God that's
[1:15:39] yourself to
[1:15:42] him and lastly I'll say this to let off
[1:15:45] the pressure at Christmas time let
[1:15:46] Christmas be a time of
[1:15:49] worship let it be a time of
[1:15:52] worship the Bible says when the wise men
[1:15:55] come into the house they saw the young
[1:15:56] child with Mary his mother and fell down
[1:15:58] and worshiped Him worship means to
[1:16:01] prostrate yourself before a king when
[1:16:04] they had opened their Treasures they
[1:16:05] presented to him gifts gold and
[1:16:07] frankincense and were appropriate gifts
[1:16:11] God so anointed Jesus with the fullness
[1:16:13] of himself he said he was God's gifts to
[1:16:14] the world wise men are clearly
[1:16:16] identified their offering their gift to
[1:16:18] him showed in their heart they knew who
[1:16:19] he was what he was going to do for them
[1:16:22] he says so wonder the first thing they
[1:16:24] did they fell down perfectly in order I
[1:16:27] believe it would be in order for us to
[1:16:29] have a worship
[1:16:30] service tonight on Sunday every day of
[1:16:34] the week every day of the year but
[1:16:36] especially at Christmas time I believe
[1:16:38] it would be appropriate for us to
[1:16:40] worship Christ the King he said before
[1:16:45] they could even understand it they fell
[1:16:47] down and worshiped him and then
[1:16:48] presented their gifts he said that's the
[1:16:51] way to have real Christmas worship him
[1:16:54] and then present your gift presenting
[1:16:56] your body as a Living Sacrifice holy and
[1:17:00] acceptable to God and he says this as
[1:17:03] musicians come he said now
[1:17:06] remember during
[1:17:08] Christmas Worship the Lord
[1:17:11] Jesus he didn't say ignore it he didn't
[1:17:14] say make it something Pagan but he said
[1:17:18] worship him in the power of his
[1:17:21] resurrection I may not the all the same
[1:17:24] Traditions that you have or all the same
[1:17:26] memories I don't know how many of you
[1:17:28] think of chickens running around with
[1:17:29] their heads cut off at Christmas
[1:17:32] time may not have all the same
[1:17:34] Traditions or the same memories maybe
[1:17:36] some things I do you wouldn't do and
[1:17:38] some things that you do that I wouldn't
[1:17:40] do but remember this at Christmas
[1:17:44] remember to worship
[1:17:46] him remember that he's
[1:17:48] worthy he's
[1:17:51] worthy brother the random talked about
[1:17:53] the the woman that washed jesus' feet
[1:17:55] and he talked about how that she went in
[1:17:57] there and and he said and it's always
[1:17:59] struck me because he said Simon was so
[1:18:02] busy and the other Pharisees were so
[1:18:05] busy doing Church
[1:18:07] things that they forgot to worship him
[1:18:12] they forgot to wash his feet I said
[1:18:14] let's let's not get so busy brother Joe
[1:18:16] at Christmas time that we'd forget what
[1:18:19] it's all
[1:18:20] about I I pray that I wouldn't get so
[1:18:22] busy and I've really I've struggled with
[1:18:24] that moan spirit and I I need to reset
[1:18:27] for the new year but sometimes I get so
[1:18:29] busy and I I preach uh this this year so
[1:18:34] many times here at the church and I look
[1:18:36] at that at the end of the year and I I
[1:18:37] take an account of myself and what have
[1:18:39] I done with the time that I've been here
[1:18:43] and and I do I'm always thinking have I
[1:18:46] been here enough have I taken off too
[1:18:48] much and it's really made me think what
[1:18:51] can I do to make sure sure that in all
[1:18:54] the busyness I'm here and I'm here more
[1:18:58] than most and and maybe maybe to my
[1:19:01] detriment I'm I've worked my my family
[1:19:04] half to death but I'll say this it's not
[1:19:07] about how busy we are but we want to
[1:19:09] make sure we get a
[1:19:11] chance we take the chance we take the
[1:19:14] opportunity when we have our services
[1:19:16] let's not take them for
[1:19:17] granted it's not how many we
[1:19:20] have but how do we what do we do do with
[1:19:23] the ones we have see my brother Ben
[1:19:25] everybody's not here but what did we do
[1:19:27] with the
[1:19:29] opportunity he came by we invited him to
[1:19:32] come and he came by when we invited him
[1:19:34] he always comes where he's
[1:19:37] invited then why don't we come and adore
[1:19:39] him why don't we just lay ourselves give
[1:19:43] ourselves to him would you bow your
[1:19:44] heads with me and close your eyes maybe
[1:19:46] there's a someone here who's never
[1:19:48] really given your heart to him in the
[1:19:50] way that you
[1:19:51] should
[1:19:53] maybe you're sitting here tonight and
[1:19:55] you're thinking well I just I've messed
[1:19:58] up and but why don't you just come in
[1:20:00] the City of
[1:20:02] Refuge why don't you just do that
[1:20:04] tonight it's not too late for
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] you I know sometimes we we raise our
[1:20:11] kids with tender conscience and we
[1:20:13] should but sometimes they feel like when
[1:20:15] they do something a little bit wrong
[1:20:16] they oh they' send away their day of
[1:20:18] Grace no he still loves you why don't
[1:20:21] you come in the city of ref
