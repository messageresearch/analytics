of prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be in your presence tonight and to know that you're here with us I pray that you'd bless this service Lord I pray if there's one without uh with a need Lord that needs to be met tonight I pray you'd speak to that need Lord and speak directly to our hearts we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you turn with me if you will to John chapter 6 and verse 9 I'm going to take a break from our Series tonight and just something that was on my heart something simple I guess I guess we need uh simpler topics I had a note little Post-it note on my desk uh posted to the front of the desk that said uh preach understandable words I'm not sure was that you brother Caleb oh it looks like a child's handwriting so whoever you are probably one of my children uh I want to try to do that tonight and uh I was going to do that even before I saw that note so I uh isn't God good to us we sure do want to understand don't we amen John 6 and9 says there's a lad here which haveth five barley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated I want to title this tonight how did we get fed have you ever left a good meal and said how did that happen I don't think we think about it very much but uh some of us that don't cook all the meals at home we we don't always understand the process or how complicated it is to get food on the table and what went into that and and yet we benefit from it and sometimes you go away from a meal and you don't even think about where it came from but you just my was good I'm just so full that I just can't hardly stand it and John chapter 6 tells us about a time when Jesus fed 5,000 men and women and children that were there as well and he fed these with Five Loaves and two small fishes and they went away that day and they said how did we eat so good how did we get fed I think sometimes we leave church like that we sit there and we think well it wasn't a special meeting and it wasn't a great preacher but somehow we got fed and I left a fo that I just felt like that God was on my side and and whatever I had need of it was there for me and the the blessings of God were all around me and I just felt so good about that what was it it was the God was providing for us something we don't know how it happened now if you cook the food you know a little bit more how it happened you went to the store you bought the the canned biscuits and the gravy and the package and put them together and and uh you or or maybe you made it homemades you know and you you know how it happened you you you you made it you yourself or maybe you bought it or you went to the to the restaurant and you paid for it it reminds you of how it happen but but if you had no part in it these people had no part in it they said how did it happen this must be God yes they said the only thing we can say is that Jesus was there and I wonder how many times we leave the house of God like that and think the only thing I could say Jesus was there and I believe that he is the one who does it no matter how he works he is the one ultimately that's responsible if we get fed and they left there and said this must be that Prophet this must be the Messiah this must be the one that was spoken of this must be Christ so we find then that it happened it was a paradox and brother brandham taught us that a paradox is something incredible but true in other words almost can't be true you can't explain how it's true or why it's true it just happened right right and brother BR said it was a paradox when Jesus our lord took five biscuits and two little fish and broke them and fed 5,000 and taken up baskets full of remainings little Parcels that some of them didn't he said they'd lay four or five fish down at this table and four or five loaves of bread then they go over here and lay four or five loaves of bread some of them couldn't even e it all just left them laying there so they picked them up baskets full of them oh he said see how did he do it it's incredible that a man could take five biscuits and two little fishes and feed 5,000 and take up seven baskets full or in the other cases 12 baskets full left over it's incredible but he did it right you may not be able to explain it but he did it you may not be able to explain how he saved you but he did it glad he did it right sir but yet there were a lot of things that had to happen before Jesus could break the bread and a new loaf grow on it there was a lot of things that happened and many times in the service we don't always understand a lot of things happened before we got blessed before we got fed that maybe we didn't even recognize or even see and we don't think about but there's a lot that goes into it because God sets up predestined moments sometimes hours days months years in advance and he orchestrates people to be there and people why we should never take the house of God for granted we should always recognize that God meant for us to be there on that night and he meant for us to hear that message and he meant for us we we believe he's big enough to do that yet we don't see what all goes into the Providence of God I hope that word's not too big for you you we don't see what all he plans and what all he works out but it's that that God's it too big brother Caleb Providence all right okay we don't always see that but we know he does it anyway aren't you glad for that right yes so we know that before there could be fish and I remember and we're going to go through this kind of backwards but you remember that that there was a little boy there that had the five Lo and the two fishes Jesus didn't create something new he multiplied what had already been created at that time so there had to be if we back it up we realize there had to be somebody who caught some fish right and clean the fish and that's how I know there must have been a father in that home Who provided for his own right amen so I want you to think about that as the first step towards 5,000 people getting fed at the meeting right was a father providing for his own I'm so glad we have a heavenly father that provides for his own tonight but this father must have provided the father you said how do you know there was a father the fish got clean didn't they it's always Dad's job so you just bear with me in my Folly maybe there wasn't one there but somebody provided and if not an Earthly father then the heavenly father provided Jesus didn't create it look said when he fed 5,000 people he took a fish that once swam in the water broke it handed it out and multiplied creation he took bread that was once wheat baked into bread broke it and handed out to the people and it returned back again he said he multiplied creation but you don't you realize what a day we live in today he said greater things than this shall you do he said but in the last days where there's no sign of cre he speaks it into creation anyhow shows to be the same God that was in the beginning he said he can create squirrels he can create whatever he wants to because he's God do we still believe that tonight he can do what he wants to do because he's God right yes sir greater things than this will you do for I go into my father he said the word is infallible and it has to be manifested and has to be fulfilled you could put that on your refrigerator it's absolutely the truth the word is is infallible and it has to be manifested and has to be fulfilled greater than this should you do not multiplying but speaking out into creation that's the hour we live in the age of the spoken word and yet we know that in this case brother brandham said that this was not created it was multiplied so somebody had to clean the fish are you with me so far so the heavenly father provided the wheat huh yeah he provided the fish put it on the Earth but an Earthly father must have caught the fish and cleaned it cut down the wheat M it the father's role is to provide and and I know that for some for many of us uh you know it's become in such an age where we're making bricks without straw it seems like that more and more the the the sisters have to work to help out in the home and that's random said that was okay if it was to pay the bills and to help in some way but yet it's the husband's role to provide for the home and I want our young people to understand that you say brother Ben where are you going I'm not sure yet but we'll end up somewhere but I want our young people I want our young men uh these older young men that are here uh tripping and and Landon and Peter and and I know some of y'all think you're older too but but as they get older I want you to understand it is a man's responsibility to provide for the house amen it's not the woman's responsibility to provide for the house not at all and yet sometimes a woman will help right just like there's times a man will help with a wife's responsibilities right because because of love that's love in a marriage and care for one for another yet a man provides period so if the wife never brings in a dollar it's my job to take care of my family so I don't have to like my job I don't have to I don't have to it don't have to fit my personality I don't I have to work because it's my job it's my responsibility to provide everybody understand that tonight but you realize the same thing is true of God it's his responsibility to take care of me when I'm in need and when I'm in it's not my responsibility to take care of my spiritual needs it's his responsib so a man is to provide in fact Paul says if any provide not for his own especially for those of his own house he has denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel that's strong language I believe our boys need to hear that today believe we all need to hear that a man is to provide for all those in his house so when you get a little bit older you start thinking about those things you got to learn to work or or go to school and and some way that you can provide for your family because that is your responsibility to provide in the scripture is to means to take thought for beforehand I'm so glad he does that for us amen but as as men we don't just show up and go to work but we take thought for that how will we provide for our families look 2 Thessalonians 3:10 tells us that he said we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat other words refuse to work when they were able what is that he's showing that it's the father it's a man's role if he will not work he should not eat but he he he is his role to do that and yet and yet when we fulfill the word when we do what we're supposed to do you say brother Ben I don't know how I'm going to make it I don't know how I'm going to have a job that provides for my family if you'll do your part he's promised to do his part right because he wouldn't ask you to do something that you can't do and when you fulfill the word and and do your best to provide for your own God will take what you bring to him and multiply it right he'll feed 5,000 if that's how many kids you have with Five Loaves and two fishes but it's your job to get the Five Loaves and the two fishes right are you with me now somebody had to do it somebody had to go fishing and he had no idea what an impact it was going to have on his family he had no idea what an impact it was going to have on the church no idea what an impact it was going to have when it come to when it come to the gospel and how we would think about it today when he cleaned those two fish he thought he was just giving his little boy lunch sometimes when you dads go to work you think well I don't do nothing in the church I don't have but just doing what God told you to do is actually it means so much to the economy of God because you might be feeding the next preacher you might be feeding the next Deacon the in your home and and when you feed them well they come to church right and the materials the ingredients hope if you're following me tonight the ingredients you put in their life are multiplied by God to help other people are you with me now so they might have looked around and said how did we get fed because a man provided food for his family we might look around after church say how did we get fed because Jehovah Gyra is our provider our father provides food for his family now the little boy had a lunch and I think maybe the reason he had a lunch is he had a mother right want to make sure that he could have a lunch to take with him little boys aren't very good at providing uh look looking ahead and providing for themselves so Mama made sure that he had had a lunch so the second reason that we could look at this that how did they get fed that day is a mother cooked lunch right and so she got it together and and you know maybe the equivalent of ramen noodles and that day was loe's and Fishes I don't know brother Bill's shaking his head I he must like Ramen noodles every bit as much as I do I hate them things but but here whatever it is she she cooked it she took what was provided her and put it in a in in a thing or a box or something so her little boy had a lunch that he could then give to Jesus early that morning mom must have got up and started a fire you think about it wasn't quite so easy as what we've got it they didn't have Lunchables in that day and time so she made him a Lunchable right and so she she actually got up early and and and probably put the wood in the fire and well Dad's off catching the fish are off at work and and and when he brings home the the fish and the and and she had the bread there she took it she cut it in pieces and and she cooked it real good cuz brother bam tells us it was cooked right cuz they just ate it it wasn't raw they weren't eating sushi it wasn't meant to be consumed that way every time Jesus ate fish he cooked it praise God that's my personal Doctrine I'm just going to stay with that so she she cooked the bread and the fish and committed it to the hands of that little boy having no clue that they would end up in the hands of Jesus but she did her work oh church we can only understand you say well I don't mean anything to the church yes you do all right I'm not important in the service yes you are you mean something to the in the house of God you mean something to the people of God it might all you might have been able to do was get up and feed your family lunch but that provided in such a way for them that they could be in the house of God right so she she cooked the bread and the fishes and that morning all over Jerusalem people were going to work all over wherever they were there in Galilee people were going to work the high priest got up and went through his daily ritual and the merchant opened up his shop and the and the fisherman cast her Nets great men like pilot and Herod conducted their business their diplomacy and saw people in their throne rooms but the most important job that was done that day are you hearing me Church the most important thing in the world was going on in a kitchen where a little mother was packing a little boy's lunch good you said but brother Ben I want to have an importance in life I want to have a career and I want to do this and it's fine for you to do whatever you're smart enough to do I guess but I want you to understand how important the job is that God has given you if you're a mother today if you're a housewife God has given you a job that is so important because you it's not up to you to multiply it you just have to do it see the Bible says that the older women should teach the younger women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chased keepers at home that means a hous worker a hous worker and I've often said that our women have to work out of the house our our sisters that have to work out of the house are actually they work two jobs and and we should do everything we can as a husband to see that they that they are uh that we help all that we can because they're actually working two jobs because have a job at home and it's their most important job amen mothers have an extremely important role in the Scriptures it took joked to produce a Moses right it took Hannah to dedicate Samuel to the Lord right it took Mary to raise Jesus and she had him for 30 years do you realize that he was still at home cuz she was she went to the they went to the wedding together when he began his ministry so here he was still she raised him for 30 years God left himself in flesh in her care somebody had to cook the meals somebody had to clean the house so Jesus could be who he was are you with me now how do we get fed and they might have looked around said how do we get fed they had no clue it was because a mother cooked all right and to little boy's lunch many times you come to the house of God and you say oh wasn't that a wonderful sermon wasn't that a wonderful I hope you do anyway I may be I may be thinking uh optimistically there but you might come to the house of God and say wasn't it a wonderful service didn't we don't you enjoy the atmosphere that we have but you don't see the ingredients to go into it the ingredients that housewives are putting into it the ingredients that husbands are putting into it the ingredients that the the people in the back are putting into it you don't see you can sit at home if you're not able to come to church and those you that are streaming tonight you're able to sit there and stream the service and you don't see the work that goes into that right but but what is it it's God's work and I want you to know that God sees that and he said don't be weary and well doing but in due time you'll be rewarded for what you the labor you put in yes it don't just happen somebody does it right right how did we get fed because a mother did what she was was called to do pack the little boy's lunch I want to talk to you young people for a minute you think well I'm not important it's not important that I sit on the front row and I see all these notes are taken my goodness are the words small enough you can understand tonight is that yeah look all the work all the all the time you come to church you might feel like well I'm just waiting on getting out you know or we can go play see you're important in the service and you parents you know sometimes when we commit our children to the Lord I hope this is okay tonight I know it's slow but sometimes when we when we commit our children to the Lord you know the first thing they do is go the wrong way or at least we think they're going the wrong way because brother bham tells us in this story that the first thing the little boy did is play hookie at school right so the father Faithfully provides the mother Faithfully packs his lunch and gets him out the door and he unfaithfully runs away he immediately goes fishing I guess that gives license to all you boys young boys and girls to fish instead of going to school but anyway maybe not he intended to go fishing he was going the wrong way but God has a way of getting a hold of those who intend to do something different aren't you glad for that he got a hold of you you weren't looking for God he was looking for you and he got a hold of you when you planned on doing something different so brother Brandon said there he stood with hundreds 5,000 men women and children hungry grown all day with no food through the dust just to hear a word or two from his precious lips tired he sat upon the rock and a little boy played hookie from school you know Trent what that means is he skipped class and went fishing and he heard Jesus and he came by he's the one that had the lunch see it may look like your children have gone the wrong direction but just hold on Jesus has a way of attracting their attention oh I I love it when the kids begin to pay attention in church he has a way of attracting their attention even those that have left you see well my kids are are gone they don't come to church anymore but remember he has a way of attracting their attention to where at the right time at the right place so they can do what God has called them to do see Jesus already knew that the young man would come that day right in fact the whole service was set up all right and he even where he was the location and everything else Jesus knowing he was going to feed everybody that day but not no and he knew how but the disciples knew none of it and the 5000s knew none of it and many times you don't know any of it and he does it anyhow but I'm so thankful Jesus had the meeting right and sometimes we think well the meetings are hard we're about to start really kicking it into gear to prepare for our meetings but I'm glad he had that meeting right I'm glad Jesus took the time to have the meeting and feed the people and do what needed to be done but don't worry if if it's of God God will provide for the meeting amen so Jesus knew he would come by that day he knew you would be in church tonight amen now I've always wondered why the little boy had Five Loaves that's a lot of bread for two fish see he got Five Loaves he even though the loaves were not necessarily like French loaves like we would have today or regular loaves they were actually a loaf much like we saw in Egypt it'd be a round uh bread maybe about that thick but he had five of them it's a lot for a little boy other the two fishes I understand because I like fish but you know the little boy may not have been alone did you know that you kids know that that little boy may not have been alone brother brandom tells us this he said Brethren I crawled up close to that rock he's talking about the disciples giving testimony he said when I've seen that little boy we followed us followed us down there this morning had been playing TR it from the school him and his little sister had this lunch under her arm so him and his little sister were walking down there and you know I can just imagine that boy she was driving him crazy I got this picture in my mind when I read this quote of this little sister's coming after him she's saying I'm going to tell Mom you just wait I'm going to tell Mom he you you're playing hook and you ain't you're headed to the fishing hole I I know it huh and he got her lunch she well I tell you what you'd be lucky if you ever get this lunch imagine how she felt when he gave her lunch away she got fed too right that's what that's what brother B said I don't know where he got that but I like to think that the little sister was following him around Jesus somehow attracted this little boy's attention now he might have been dragged to church over and over again they might have made him go every Saturday when they would have the the the Sabbath day and and I'm sure they did because the Jews were very diligent about their with their children make sure they went to the house of God so they probably went to every synagogue service and every place and they went there and every every Saturday they go force him to take a bath and and get ready and and put his best robe on and they'd go down there and he'd learn the scriptures go down to Sunday school or Saturday school if they had it and and he would learn the scriptures but he he never wanted to go they just dragged him there but that day he was going fishing and there was something about the meeting that attracted his attention so much that he gave up fishing to go to church I know I don't know about the rest of y'all but I know me and brother Stewart that take quite a bit right it take quite a meeting to attract our attention away from fishing to go to church well Danny that's quite a meeting but somehow it did it attracted his attention Jesus has a way of doing that you know what he did as he got closer he heard the noise of the crowd all right do you know that wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise right and he hears the noise of the crowd and it attracted his attention oh I I pray every church service is like that maybe your amen will get the attention of one of these young children that will attract their attention to the house of God right he would just go and see what the noise was all about heyen I think of John Wesley when the preachers asking him said how do we go uh what should we do to start our ministry he said he said just get so on fire for God he said until you just burn so brightly that that the people come to watch you you burn sir oh church let us be like that brother BR said he just had one little lunch some little boy perhaps playing Tru from school run off and he heard the crowd he heard the crowd yeah and he went up on the hill to see what was taking place and it was so fascinating he just forgot about his lunch well he must have really gotten distracted he forgot about fishing am he forgot about lunch all right oh God oh don't you know and Jesus would preach for hours he preached so long that the disciples said hey you need to send this crowd away they won't be able to make it to the Applebees right I mean McDonald's is closing so he preached so long but the little boy held his attention why there was something about it this was his moment God was fixing to use him for something you young people don't give up hope God God's fixing to use you for something don't say Well church is boring when I turn 18 boy I'm going to leave God's fixing to use you for something he wants to take what your mother and father put into you and use it for something is that all right yes now look wherever Jesus is there's a lot of noise so here he was attracted by the noise and when he got up there he forgot about his lunch because he wanted to see what this great speaker was saying and watch what he was doing all right oh that's why we always need the presence of Jesus in our services because if he's here then the young people be attracted to that and they want to see they want to hear what he's saying and they want to see what he's doing right they might have looked around afterward said how did we get fed because a little boy went to church amen there was not only a boy that went to church it was a disciple that brought him to Jesus I forgot to turn on my timer so but we're doing good a disciple brought him to Jesus John 6:5 when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company coming to him he said to Phillip When shall we buy bread that these may eat and he said this to prove him for he himself knew what he would do right all right he he knew what was going to happen yeah but he asked the trustees Anyway said hey how are we going to pay for this just real simple tonight just trying to be understandable when should we buy bread and they said oh I don't know I wouldn't the money is not in the account know then went looked up the bank account and the bag you know and shook it a little bit and said well there just not not much there he already knows how you'll get fed all right that's why we ought to always come to the house of God when we can he knows how we'll get fed it may not seem like it's much but he knows how we'll get fed in verse 7even Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little 200 dinari penny worth 200 pennies was a substantial sum a penny was about a day's wage for a lab laborer so each one of them if they work a full day they get one penny he said we could work for 200 days all right and not make enough money to provide for this crowd it wouldn't be enough and and I love the fact then that Andrew speaks up I've I've talked to you about Andrew before not Andrew Glover although I think he's got a little bit of this in him as well but this Andrew in the Bible the Apostle Andrew he was a person who always stepped in at the right time when something was needed and one of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said unto him there's a lad here which has five barley loes and two small fishes but what are they among so many but you know the rest of them didn't even have any enough Faith to look and see what people had but Andrew had enough faith that he looked around the congregation he said well we got Five Loaves and two fishes but what are they among so many I've got lots of questions for Andrew how did he know about the little boy's lunch you know God provides certain people are just willing to talk to people that's communication right there and know the other disciples knew but Andrew was different he knew what the little boy had for lunch and you know sometimes it's good to talk it's good to talk because you never know how Jesus might use that information now I've never said it's good to talk in the Pulpit before but it's good to talk about good things what did you have for lunch that's good so the little boy must have come up and Andrew befriended him in some way and and and brother B said he followed him there to the meeting and so he befriended him in some way and said hey well you got in your bag there and he said well I got Five Loaves and two fishes he said hang on to that Jesus might need it amen oh that's what we need we need some Andrews around this was Andrews nature in John 135 it tells us uh John this is John the disciple had act or the uh uh John the Baptist had stood up there and he began to declare that Jesus was the Messiah and the next day after John stood and two of his disciples looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith Behold the Lamb of God I believe we've heard that in our day right Behold the Lamb of God right and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus and one of the two which heard John speak and followed him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother but watch Andrew's personality it's not enough just for him to go to church he going to make sure his whole family goes right so verse uh uh 41 tells us he first findeth his own brother Simon so before he ever went and heard Jesus he went to find Simon and said on him we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and notice what he did he brought him to Jesus Andrew couldn't make Simon believe but he could get him to Jesus Andrew couldn't could be the one who discerned the secrets of of Peter's heart but he got him Jesus he couldn't give him a new name but he got him Jesus he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah thou shal be called sephus which is by interpretation a stone now we don't know if Andrew had any gifts he never is spoken of as one who did Miracles or saw signs and wonders in his ministry but he knew if he could just get people in the presence of Jesus things would be different he said well brother Ben how did he do it well brother R gives us a clue he tells us you know some men are fine some men are dogmatic some men are blusterous some men are gentle right he tells us that but he says something about Andrew he said Andrew was a prayer Warrior he said Andrew is that prayer Warrior just stayed on his knees all the time so it may be that because he stayed on his knees in prayer that God led him to the little boy and caused him to bring him in the presence of Jesus Oh church if we do that I believe our families would begin to desire to be in the house of God more if we'd spend more time on our knees in prayer yes oh that we had more folks suck Andrew I'm so glad for some of you that pray for your pastor and pray for the church and pray for these young people and pray for each other I'm so glad that you do because Without You Andrews we could never come in the presence of Jesus we need some Andrews brother brand said today well the Harvest is on let's go about gathering in the sheet everywhere whatever God's give you to do if you're a little housewife testify to the neighbor something do something bring somebody with you when you come oh could that be our our determination tonight I'm going to bring somebody with me he said bring somebody to church well not necessarily bring somebody to heaven with you when you go he said take us tonight Lord just what we are all of us are not preachers all of us are not prophets all of us are not speakers with tongues all of us are not miracle co workers but all of us someone say all all of us have something to do show us where it is Lord testify sing or pray and I he said like bread upon the Water it will return some glorious day granted Lord here we are send us to our neighbors to wherever we can to our fellow men and tell them of the coming of the Lord oh could we be like Andrew today and get people in the presence of Jesus look said how did we get fed because Andrew brought a little boy to Jesus Jesus heard that we got Five Loaves and two fishes he said make them sit down now said there was much grass in the place Jesus picks a particular place where they could sit down if you know anything about Israel there's not much grass anywhere but there was in that place so they could sit down and have dinner cuz he had already provided amen was already in his plan so the men sat down in number about 5,000 Jesus picks up the little boy's lunch right puts it in his hands right but the B said did you ever think what kind of an atom he must have let loose well where did the flower come from see when they made the loaves she had to use flour to make them but when he broke the Lo and they grew back on there was no flow it disappeared he said where did the flow come from not only flour but it was already baked in a loaf and ready to eat he had fish he grew the fish at the first place but now he breaks the fish half and two and another fish could grow on there but this fish that comes on there is already cooked and baked and grow too glory to God when you think it's hopeless when you think there's no way that you say I'm working brother Ben I'm doing everything I can for my family I'm doing everything when you think there's no way remember Jesus broke the bread and when he did what he would what what all that the little boy had was Five Loaves and two fishes but he was when he broke it it multiplied in his hands and there was no way you could explain that but it happened now look what did he do oh he's God he said just speak it that's all he has to do he said now the little boy that little lunch he had wasn't very much in his hands but when he let what he had go into Jesus hands it fed thousands oh Church you young people if you could just take what you have you say I need more talent I wish I could sing better I wish I could play the piano I wish I could do this set or the other take what you have give it to him be willing be ready to give it to him Lord whatever I can be used for Lord let me be useful let me take what you've given me and put it in your hands as long as it's in my hands it couldn't do very much but in his hands it'll feed thousands he said and maybe what little faith you say well I wish I had great faith but what little faith you got you got faith enough to come to church how many are in church tonight where are the rest of you right you have faith enough to come to church didn't you well come on it required some faith it may not have been much but it was some it was more for some than others some people come to church and they don't maybe know where tomorrow's Bread's coming from but they're going to come to church tonight some people come Church hurting some people come to church in pain and some come to church and it's just easy because their parents go anyway and they kind of have to but you had enough Faith to be in church tonight are you with me now you got enough Faith to be in church and then if you got that much Faith why don't you just give it over in the hands of Jesus it'll feed thousands Hallelujah so there's not much in your hands but once in his hands it'll do Miracles if you let that Faith get in his hands oh I think we've seen that church we've seen it every one of you can tell about miracles when you finally put that situation in the hands of Jesus he can do Miracles he still does today if you let that Faith get in his hands there were also some disciples there who distributed what Jesus multiplied amen not up to me to multiply it's up to me to distribute it there you go Hallelujah Jesus Took the lows when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down so he said here you go here you go Peter you can carry a lot take these yeah the bread's just growing all the time you know just breaking it here Peter take this load okay he can carry a lot maybe maybe he gave Judas a lot too so he wouldn't you know he didn't want to get killed ahead of his time you know make him give him plenty so he'll be happy maybe one of the other disciples maybe they just got a little bit but it was enough to feed the people that were in their group they were responsible for right see Jesus didn't walk out there and hand everybody here here's a loaf of fish you know if he'd have been a politician you want to make sure his name got on it and he was one that distributed he was out there but no what was he doing breaking it multiplying it giving it to the disciples and they took it you realize what preaching is it's just us taking what he gives us we can't preach what he doesn't give us he takes we he takes this message and breaks it for us and then we take it and we just give it out to you and you say oh that was wonderful work I just gave you what he gave me I didn't cook it I didn't clean it I didn't provide it I didn't do anything for it all I did was carry it all right oh God that God would have preachers everywhere that would carry this message Faithfully amen i' carry their own opinions but carry what he gave them not the fishes and Loaves and and some chocolate cake but but just what he gave us that'll be sufficient BR said God always used men for his work is that right he he he don't use organizations or so forth Mechanical Devices he uses men the Holy Spirit fell upon men that's God's instrument here on Earth and again he's talking about people being healed when hands were laid on he said now that doesn't make us Jesus doesn't make us Jesus see that just makes us his servants we are his vessels that he has working through us he uses men for his vessels to work through sir again he said many times people thinks when a Ministry becomes Supernatural they think that person ought to wear robe clothes and touch me not you know he said when a person acts like that they're trying to be something that they're not right Jesus was had the greatest Ministry ever and some of the biggest crowds by the way and he still found time to be around the disciples and to eat dinner with people God helped me to be the same way you said when a person acts like that they're trying to be something that they're not God uses men just ordinary men thank God for that I'm just about as ordinary as they get we went and did our our our DNA test you know and I thought well I'll find something exotic in there and I am as ordinary as a person as a human being could possibly be forgive me for this but I'm as white as they come all right English and Scottish and and I have no interesting stories to tell other than the bad stuff and and it's just not even interesting I had lost interest in it myself canceled my subscription it was so boring but I'm so glad God uses ordinary men aren't you glad he uses Ordinary People to do his work amen God uses men he said God could have used the sun to preach the gospel God could have used the wind to preach the gospel but God chose men to preach the gospel yes did go that Joel's so extraordinary we still don't know if he belongs to the family gives him hope or just ordinary people aren't we in Hardy Arkansas we're just ordinary people but God uses ordinary men right sir uses Ordinary People he said God chose men to preach the gospel he said that was his idea that human would speak back through human not himself but the word of the Lord came to the prophets the prophesied to give his word out that's how he chose to give the Loaves and Fishes to the people and so he waited until they all got full right you talk about a buffet b said they put four or five Loaves on this table and four or five on this table and they're looking around they're saying my goodness Jesus is a good host you know look at this they all got full just man they so oh I tell you what that was so good and then he said to his disciples I love this said I want you to go gather up the leftovers which is proof that sometimes you have to eat the leftovers it's okay but there was a purpose for this gather up the fragments that remain let nothing be lost because there was a purpose for every fish and a purpose for every loaf I want you to understand that he purposely made too much on Amen oh you think I'm going to I'm gonna get it all I'm you know I'm about there I'm about to my understanding the message where no he made so much that you'll never be able to comprehend at all that's right you'll get so full and yet there'll be four yes oh Church each disciple walked away with his own basket of leftovers did you ever notice that there wasn't 13 there wasn't 11 there was 12 12 baskets of leftovers each one of them carried a basket each disciple Peter and James and John it's funny how that works isn't it he so distributed the food that every every one of them and I'm sure they griped and complain like we do cleaning up after a meeting you know and man what are we doing you know what here we have to give the people the food and they can't even take it home put it in a doggy bag we got to pick it back up again Jesus why did you have to make so much but see sometimes Jesus does something in an abundant way so that we'll remember it right amen they needed a reminder of what God had done and I always wondered that why why why take up the leftovers why not just leave them cuz I'm not fond of leftovers why not just throw them in this in this ocean why why not just leave them for the birds God made the birds too they have to eat but Jesus does it on purpose because they actually asked brother brandham that question I want to go to Matthew 16:6 because when they ask brother Bram the question why did they take up the 12 baskets brother Bram responds with this scripture and this is after the miracle of the fishes and Loaves it actually happened twice but this is after this time we're speaking of Jesus said unto them talking to his disciples take heed and Beware of the leav of the Pharisees and the Sadducees and they reasoned among themselves saying it's because we've taken no bread when Jesus perceived he said unto them oh ye of little faith why reason you among yourselves because you brought no bread he wasn't getting on to them for not being good trustees good deacons whatever are providing they said oh no we're out here without bread again what are we going to do well Jesus said wait a minute each one of you carried a basket of leftovers are you with me now weren't you in the meeting don't you remember you said why why can't we just go to the meeting and everybody be orderly and everybody be nice and smile at each other and Shake Hands on the parking lot and leave why does God maybe some somebody will take off screaming down the aisle somebody will shout somebody will worship and and sometimes the people will sing and something will happen you say why did it have to happen like that so you'd remember it God didn't need your Screaming God didn't need your shouting God didn't need any of your emotion but he did it so you would remember it all right and he gave them 12 basketfuls the meeting was so good that they went home staggering beneath the weight of the leftovers all that every church service we can get so full of the word of God we go home staggering under the influence of the leftovers that God poured into our life oh he said he said do you not understand neither remember the five lows of the 5,000 and how many baskets you took up said do you remember what it was like carrying those baskets I'm a provider and brother BR said in other words like this if you seen God provide and do a miracle can't he do a miracle again that's why you carried home that basket full can't he do a miracle again other words like this if he saved you from a life of sin can he not heal your body don't you remember when you was a sinner how he lifted up your soul in faith to believe can't he do likewise do something great for you again that's why he gave you leftovers that's why the tears run down your face that's why you love him so much that's why you feel that tangible presence of God yes wants you to remember so you'll have faith to believe him for next time sir if there will be a next time Moses asked for a free will offering for the Tabernacle in the wilderness the Lord stirred the hearts of the people until they brought too much you remember that Exodus 367 the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it and too much and God tells Moses tell him to stop it's too much man that'd be quite an offering wouldn't it but David it was free will too they weren't made to do it God just stirred up their hearts but why was it too much remember when Caleb and Joshua come into the land what' they say they didn't say well I think we can do it they said we're more than able amen a God who could inspire people hallelujah to give so much to the Tabernacle that they couldn't even use it at all that same God is big enough to provide for us in the wilderness to provide for us when we have a need if he can stir them up to bring their their Free Will offering he can stir them up to fight when the fighting is needed we're more than able to make it oh my we look in the New Testament and find Paul said the law entered that the offense might abound but we're sin abounded Grace did much more abound that word is super abound it's super abounded Grace Super bounded why it was more than enough right not just enough but more than than enough yes I want to read this with you before we close and as we close in Psalms 23:1 he said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I've carried some of them baskets home I know how good he is I've seen him I've seen him use me to kill the bear and to kill the lion I know what he can do Lord is my shepherd shall not one he makes me lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake yay though I walk to the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me but rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointest my head with oil and then he doesn't say my cup is full but he says my cup runneth over more than enough oh I wonder if we can believe for that kind of blessing today super abounding Grace more than enough more than we could even ask for or even think or even even bring ourselves to ask oh more than enough brother BR said what takes place when you're filled with God musicians go ahead and come he said when you're filled with God you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're filled with power you're filled with love with joy with peace with longsuffering with goodness with meekness with gentleness with worship when you're filled with God you're filled with worship you're filled with joy oh my David said my cup runneth over and if David had a cup running over before the Holy Ghost come what would it be now amen oh my surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever why because he gave me more than enough super abundant grace I've car home some of the baskets I know what it's like if you've never done that you need to commit yourself to him like the little boy did commit your work to him let him make more than enough out of it so you can get fed and the people will be fed as well how did we get fed imagine those people thinking like that because disciples distributed the food because a little boy skip school and come to the meeting because a a mama oh my a mama cooked dinner because a father provided how did we get fed they walked away and they said we don't know we know this those men which had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world you think about this brother random talks about the third third poll he said when they come through that little room you remember I read you the quote here maybe about a year ago he said they come through that little room off to the side he said when they come through he said they come in one side crippled when they come out they come out healed he said they come out screaming and shouting come out that little room and then what did he say they he said that somebody asked the sister that come through said what happened in there she said I don't know yeah on but I know when I went in I was crippled when I come out I was healed what was it it was Jesus in the room it was more than a man more than a prophet more than a church more than a pastor it was Jesus in the room amen hallelujah oh do you believe he still got more than enough for you tonight amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father we're so so glad that you are more than enough for us Lord we commit ourselves into your hands sometimes I feel like that little boy coming to the church service I don't have anything but what you give me but Lord I realize I I sit there and I try to prepare a sermon and it feels just like Five Loaves and two fishes to feed a great multitude of people Lord people who know this message people who who understand and need to be fed and I feel like there's no way but somehow Lord you multiply the efforts oh God lord and now I know these other ministers feel the same way Lord I pray for every mother here today every father for these little children Lord for these Disciples of yours I pray Lord God you'd help them to understand that you can multiply their efforts for the kingdom of God lord and yet also realizing we live in a day Lord when even the Greater Works would be done that even when nothing was done you'd still allow us to speak Lord and something would happen but Lord I I still want to put in the effort because I Love You Lord help me to go knowing little boy didn't know what was going to happen that day but let me go knowing that you are a provider Lord I can imagine that if they had a meeting the next week all the people brought their own lunch because they knew that if Jesus could do that for one he could do it for them too maybe each one of them brought a basket with lunch in it and they didn't even have to have a miracle because each one of them knew that Jesus could provide oh I pray that you'd I pray you'd Grant it today I pray you'd give us that understanding pray for these men Lord that work Lord that provide for their families Lord I pray you'd help them be Jehovah Gyra Lord the provider in their lives these mothers Lord providing for their children I pray God that you'd help them to know you are more than enough Lord where we are insufficient you take this space created by our weakness Lord and when we are weak you are strong we're so thankful for that today we love you Lord I pray you take this simple thought Lord and just just just guide it into our hearts as it was intended to be pray you grant it now in Jesus name amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord live a holy life oh do you believe he'll make a way you believe he'll make a way today let's stand together you believe he'll make a way I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord Make A Way oh I know the Lord will make a way for me oh do you believe it with all your heart oh I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life sh the wrong do the right if I live a holy life oh sh the wrong and do the R I know I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord is coming back for me oh I know the Lord l oh do you believe he's coming back for you Hallelujah he's going to take what was put in this age and multiply it aren't you glad for that today oh I know the Lord hallelujah is coming back for if you need prayer the altar is open as we just carry for a moment oh if I spend my time in prayer oh I will meet him in the a I know the Lord oh thank you Lord coming back for me me I know the Lord will make way sing it one more time I know the Lord huah will make away oh sing it with all your heart now oh I know the Lord will make a way for oh yes if I live holy life oh sh the wrong and do the right I though the Lord will make a way for me I hope it was understandable tonight amen do you love him amen you love him with all your heart let's just raise our hands to him oh don't you love him Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you we worship you Lord in this place Lord believing one day we'll come in that Tabernacle over there where there'll be no more tiredness no more weary no more worry oh God no more sickness no more pain Lord we'll come into that Tabernacle Lord and we'll worship you with all of our hearts Lord I pray we would worship you here as if we were already in that place Lord with all of our hearts that's true worship Lord even when we don't feel like it Lord we love you anyway we thank you for what you've done for us
