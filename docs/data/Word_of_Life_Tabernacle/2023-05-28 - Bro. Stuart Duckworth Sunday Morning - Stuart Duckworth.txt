could let's just turn the scriptures this morning to him first Timothy 2 5 and 6. just want to continue our thought and worship under Redemption Timothy 2 5. for there is one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time amen you can be seated this morning just pray the Lord will bless his word amen amen we won't hold you long here today feeling good but we feel a lot better now Allen offered to step in for me so that's a that's a real buddy right there but I'm not I'm not ready to quit just yet so amen I mean the last time we preached like it was Easter and we had we had crossed on the throne we had him resurrected and ascended amen I believe he's still on the throne this morning amen do you believe that I mean I believe that he Remains the Same amen he's faithful and true this morning amen if he's on the throne if a king's on his throne amen he's in control amen he's he's the omnipotent Almighty Everlasting God this morning I believe that amen I believe that I believe that he's God's provided place of worship amen and amen and where God's provided place of worship is that's where he puts his name I mean there's not another name given under Heaven whereby men must be saved but in the name of Jesus Christ amen I believe this is more if he's on the throne I believe there's still Mercy I believe there's still Mercy I believe it's still available for those who want it do you believe that I believe I believe that's what Believers believe I believe this morning that there's overcoming power available if he's still on the throne this morning amen there's power to free you from sin and bring Deliverance in your life amen we have access this morning to the God of all Grace and Redemption this morning amen I believe he wants to be worshiped he's he's worthy this morning amen we just look at that that scripture there and and he's the mediator there's one me mediator between God a man the man Christ Jesus amen no other man was worthy no other man could do it no Prophet priest or King no Pope no one else no preacher is worthy but it took the lamb to come forth and to open the book to open the seals amen amen and bring Redemption for you and me no man was worthy amen we know that the revelation of this of this hour it was sent down to a prophet because that's God's way of doing things amen but it it took the lamb to bring that Revelation amen only the lamb amen only the lamb was worthy amen only the lamb is worthy of just every little bit of Our Praise amen no man amen should feel that spotter or receive any of that amen but him alone he alone is worthy of our worship but he's the mediator this this morning he was The Missing Link amen what what we fell from what what Adam what we fell from amen Christ was that missing link to bring us back to that and that word mediator one who intervenes between two either in order to make or restore peace and friendship so he is there to establish and restore what has been lost he is the mediator of the New Covenant and with his own life and blood he purchased you and I amen help me preach this morning amen and in him is the power to restore and to redeem us completely to what we should be amen we were lost in sin we were we were nothing but God picked us up one day and man we were Sinners we were unworthy amen but he picked us up from the devil's pawn shop he made because in him is the power of redemption amen it didn't matter how how long you were lost or how far gone you were Amen in him was that power to lift us up man and that word mediator is one who ratifies the Covenant and that word ratifies to sign or give formal consent to an agreement making it officially valid amen he makes it valid this morning amen he confirms and approves it he upholds it this morning he's there on the throne upholding amen the Covenant this morning do you believe that amen his blood sitting there with his blood amen he's there to authorize Amen to recognize amen and he has put his name on this Covenant he has signed it with his own blood with his own life he has validated the Covenant that we have with God has been signed with his own blood amen and our thought is kind of being just that what Adam lost Christ came and paid the price at Calvary to redeem us back to that which was lost amen and by the Holy Ghost just our thought that by the Holy Ghost we are sealed until the day of our Redemption it takes the Holy Ghost it's it's more than an emotion it's more than going to church it's more than just living a good life or or living a clean a clean Sanctified life but it takes the Seal of the Holy Ghost and I will bring you to the day of your Redemption that's one that's what we're living under that's what we're worshiping under that token life the literal life of Jesus Christ that by the the fullness of the word not a not a partial word or just a portion of the word but the fullness of the revelation of God that's been restored and under that it releases the fullness of the Holy Ghost the fullness and the power of the token I believe that I believe that's been given to us in this hour that we're not just living under something that'll save us something that'll sanctify us but something that will bring us and seal us to the day of our Redemption amen we've gone far enough in the word now we've been we've received enough of the word that will take us on until the day of redemption there's no going back there's no going back we've come too far we've been given too much amen God is here to uphold his word to hold us to hold that Covenant he's here to make good on his promise do you believe that amen so we're coming amen we're coming to the fullness of redemption that's been our thought you know on Calvary he paid the price of redemption but we as the end time people are coming to the fullness of redemption right for were the purchased possession amen he's made he's making Redemption claims he's sitting there on the throne amen he's paid the price amen and we'll get into it later he's waiting on that last one to come in and it's just simple things this morning if he wanted a deep sermon you should have went up to Missouri somewhere went over to a meeting it's going to be simple this morning amen but he's waiting on that last one he can't come off the throne this this morning he can't come off the throne we can't go in the Rapture until that last one has come in so we're we're living in that time of fullness of time a fullness of Redemption where the word has been revealed and we're living amen under the that time of the completion of redemption and he's the mediator he's still the mediator he's still on the throne he's still on the throne amen a mediator of the Covenant of that blood Amen to his predestinate his seed amen amen it doesn't matter how long time goes on Amen God's long-suffering is goodness his patience his Mercy it's long-suffering and we're having to endure we're having to live under that long suffering but you know what God waited on you and me He it may have taken years and years you know and there's been others before us that have waited and they've waited but we're still waiting we're still waiting on that last one because God's mercy amenity he's patient he endures right amen he'll not lose a one he'll not lose a one amen his Mercy endures forever amen he he'll not leave one behind he'll not lose the one amen God is here to stick this thing out Amen to finish this thing up amen that until that last one comes in God God is determined to save man God is determined and he'll not lose one seed he'll not lose one son or daughter amen God is determined to say man I believe this morning I believe that God is determined to bring us to the finishing of redemption amen into a Rapture amen he has given himself he has paid that price we read here but just look at the mediator just for just for a minute the cross identified in the same in all generations he said and when that last one is saved there will not be an extra one it'll just be so many and when that last one is brought in the body of Christ has completed the Rapture will come he said no so we're longing for that day to get out of this place where we're here at now for certainly a pest house we know that full of sickness and disease and disappointments and trouble and my who would want to stay here when there's such a better place to go to he said well so we're trying to get every soul saved so that Jesus can come and it cannot come unto that last one as her name on The Book of Life that was put there before the foundation of the world that when that name is called that's the last one he came to redeem to bring back and redeem is to bring back when he brings that last one he's sitting at the right hand of God tonight doing his mediatorial work and when that last soul is saved that was redeemed and seen and known by God before the foundation of the world when that last one's that last solar saved that closes the book it's over it's finished redemption's over it's over it's finished hey man you're just counting down the moments you're just counting down the moments that will go in the Rapture right so we're living under that time we're living amen where the book is about to be closed Where Mercy will be over right aren't you thankful that we've received Mercy this morning this whole world is under judgment amen though those that have rejected the message rejected God rejected whatever God they can know amen they're living under that judgment amen but we've received Mercy in this hour when you receive the word for your day you receive that Mercy when you accepted it when you didn't refuse it you accepted that Mercy that's what it was to you amen we're living on we're living under Redemption we're living under mercy here this morning amen let's look at Adam here and what what Christ has redeemed us back to amen so he's he's the mediator this morning he's the mediator of the Covenant amen and he brother Branham says here in Jehovah Jireh he says now I want you to notice when God made his first Covenant the Adam Covenant the adamant Covenant he made it between him and Adam and man turned around and broke his Covenant and every time that man makes a covenant with God he breaks it and he goes on he said and Adam and every man here is based on uh free moral agency God put within man the spirit of free moral agency to either accept it or refuse life to accept life or refuse not to either accept his provided way or take your own idea to accept his allotted word for your day I reject the message for the age that you live in and so God won't force you to do anything amen but God also is not willing that anyone should perish he wants all to come back to him amen but he knows who will and who won't and so because of his foreknowledge Brothers goes on and say he can make everything work according to his plan God knows who are his you believe that amen he knows those whose names are in the last book of life and they will come to life I Believe In Spite amen sometimes in spite of their free moral agency and then their own decisions and their own wrong decisions they will come to life Adam even in spite of his decisions he was still a son of God he calls it all him and he calls it all amen but they didn't they didn't go away into judgment and and just complete condemnation where they were Sons and Daughters of God God had to make a way for him amen so God ever remains faithful to his seed amen oh how he looked he looked beyond our faults amen he looked beyond our faults and and US refusing him no no doubt for years after years amen but he he kept calling it's because God's not willing that any should perish God's not going to lose a one amen so he'll he'll go on he'll he'll send a preacher after preacher a sermon after sermon tug after tug he'll sin every little every little bit of of love that he can to you through the word amen through through the the Believers around him amen his voice speaking to you amen through this day amen that word calling out to you telling you that your son or daughter of God telling you that you're different but you'll ignore it for years and years sometimes but it's God's mercy that he won't lose a horn and he won't lose a one amen you'll refuse it you'll refuse it but there'll come a time there'll come a predestinated time where you can't refuse it no more amen where God will come down in his Saving Grace amen by the Holy Ghost and he'll come down and he'll save you he'll feel you he'll clean your life up he'll fill you with the Holy Ghost and only God can do that the preacher can preach about it Mom and Daddy can tell you about it but only God can come down and do that amen but you've got to open your life up to him amen amen Amen to live for him Amen to live for him in this in this age to live a Christian life amen amen it's the only way of life there is for for the believer amen it's the only only way there is remember he couldn't lose us and then so he's sitting there on on the throne now he still won't lose a one no matter how lost your loved ones are no matter how how bad it seems how much they've rejected how much they've refused if they're a child of God they'll have to come to it amen I believe that God is still expressing himself as a savior as a redeemer amen I believe I believe there's still Mercy don't you that's what Believers believe Amen in 1965 is this all right because God changed his mind he said not to be a savior there has to be something lost and God cannot purposely lose anything and then redeemeth it wouldn't be becoming to his Holiness and his great judgment but he put man on free moral agency knowing that man would fall in that then he be he became man himself in order to redeem man back that fell amen that's the reason Jesus was Emmanuel if God sent another person besides himself then he wouldn't be just amen God had to come to himself and take place and God cannot come down in spirit and take place he had to be made flesh and in that flesh of his own created son amen so it took a God man to redeem man back to God man lost in the beginning and it would take a man to get it back for you and I it would take the man cross Jesus amen God had a law and then he had a law that you had to have a Kinsmen Redeemer something was lost if an estate was lost it took that Kinsman amen amen it took that kids when that was God's law amen and we and we we had a sacrifice amen those through through time they had a sacrifice of that blood of that old sacrifice but it wasn't enough to bring them back it was only foreshadowing amen of that of that blood of that all-sufficient created blood that would come in the sun amen and it would be spilled on Calvary Amen in that life would be released back to the believer or what a memorial that is this morning amen that God would send back his life send back his holy ghost amen it is still Memorial this morning amen God's life amen the Holy Ghost his life ever present amen they're available for you and I mean in a took a Kinsmen it took one that would come and live and breathe as a man overcome as a man amen live but it would it would take God coming down in that flesh it would be no less than God but it would be it would be a God man a perfect man that would come and shed his blood amen and that life would come back upon you and I on the believer amen so a man lost it and it would take a man to get it back amen aren't you thankful for that man in Christ Jesus this morning amen he left his he left his lofty lofty hearts and come down and dwelt among men such as you and I you love him this morning I know it's simple but that's what you get this morning if you want to go to a meeting oh amen he came in the flesh amen God came in flesh amen he came in flesh amen the man Christ Jesus he overcame as a man and he came and defeated every sickness every devil as a man and he didn't use his power but he used the power of the word amen and it showed that it didn't take a great a great person it didn't take just just the fullness of power but if he got just a little bit of the Holy Ghost just got a little bit of it if you got that little portion just that little size of the thumbnail if you can take the word if you can believe the word what the word said about you he came and showed us how to overcome as a man he showed us Amen to take the word amen and it would defeat the Devil it would defeat sickness it would defeat every enemy on any grounds amen you had that little bit in you this morning you had that little lick of fire I feel it this morning I Feel That Fire I mean burning down in my soul amen though the devil try to try to bring it down this morning they'll try to fight you he'll try to fight you on your way to church make you sick and I was sicker than a dog I couldn't even open my eyes I would get sick amen but I feel that power in my spirit this morning I feel that power in the Church of God this morning amen not a word cup amen but he's here amen amen every sickness is conquered this morning amen that stomach sickness it's conquered this morning amen if you got a need in your life this morning that's conquered amen the word is here and when the power of the word is here and then put it on your lips amen now that little portion that God gave you that little that little bit of his life that little portion that gives you an eye man amen that life he gave something he gave something to the holy ghost coming across the Holy Ghost is this life that we have it coming a cause he gave up he paid a price amen what a memorial that is we think of those the soldiers and this is that we can when we honor those that amen that gave their lives that served and that were willing to give their lives and we appreciate that we honor that and we're thankful for that we we have freedoms that we can come here that no other country has and then we have those freedoms and we appreciate that amen but don't don't dishonor amen our lord Jesus this morning amen don't look beyond that Memorial amen that life that was given that life amen that blood that was spilled amen that had brought back his life upon you and I that we could overcome we could have that same overcoming life amen I'm not going to preach long this morning I'm gonna preach with all I got though Hebrews 13 20. now the peace of God that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus the God of Peace that brought again our from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory forever and ever amen so this blood is an Everlasting Covenant I mean it's it's however long you need it brother Brandon would go on and say he said in the token he said it's not an eternal Covenant because Redemption amen when the fullness of redemption comes will no longer need that blood but while we need it it's an everlasting while time is going on while you need it it's here whatever you need while we're here in time it's still here and that's why I say this morning I believe that Mercy there's still Mercy this morning amen no matter how bad things get amen it's an everlasting Covenant amen it's an everlasting Covenant to the believer amen you can't lose it amen it can't go away but it's here while we're in time amen don't let the devil back you up off of that but it's the blood of an Everlasting Covenant a price was paid a price was paid amen the price of redemption was paid amen and God can't go back on that right it's an everlasting Covenant brother Brenham says it's a it's a god blood bound promise making us free from sin this morning amen we're free amen the sons and daughters are free this morning amen we've got a liberty like like nobody knows if you're a son or daughter of God you've got a liberty amen this morning you've got a right to worship Him amen no man can tell you amen how to believe what to believe amen we're sons and we're Daughters of God this morning we've got rights in the Holy Ghost amen Jesus Christ has restored us back Amen to every right that Adam lost every every identification the position that he lost everything that he's lost we've been restored back to that under this this Everlasting Covenant the blood of this Everlasting Covenant amen there that life comes back upon the believer and under that Covenant it shows that Jesus met every requirement that God required to take us back you believe that this morning amen that's the sacrifice that I believe in this morning that's what that's what I'm looking to that's where all my hopes all my faith everything that I have amen is in that sacrifice this morning to make us Sons and Daughters of God under the blood where there is no condemnation we can live a life free amen of our past amen Satan brings up your past put it back on him that's what the blood does it put it back on Satan amen but he'll come and he'll accuse the Brethren amen but my Bible says they overcome him by the word of their testimony and by the blood of the Lamb amen we overcome by the power of that blood and by the word amen the very word of your testimony overcomes the enemy every accusation amen it takes us out from the curse of Adam the curse of sin and death the curse of the Fall amen a man lost it all in the beginning but it took a man amen to get it back amen you believe that this morning a price had to be paid amen a price had to be paid amen it costs it cost our Lord something I mean he had rights brother Brown said he had a right to have a family he had a right to to have a wife and have a family but he laid down those rocks amen amen to gain us as a family amen and brother Branham says here in in Redeemer and Redemption 1955 he said what did he redeem he redeemed your soul from hell he redeemed and brought back everything that Adam lost when he puts you in the pawn shop Jesus Christ on Calvary is your Kinsman the Redeemer that redeemed you from Every curse of the devil he redeems your soul he redeems your sick body he redeems your weary and your dreary spirit amen you claimed that this morning amen he brought you happiness he brought you Joy that's what Redemption brought you amen brought you peace long-suffering goodness gentleness meekness power in the Holy Spirit brought you Divine Healing all these things Jesus Christ brought to you because he was our Kismet Redeemer he came to Earth suffered as a man he was tempted in all manners like we are yet without sin he become the perfect Kinsmen Redeemer he suffered in his body bore our infirmities and in his body to take it away and came down to become kin folks what is it God descending coming down amen and in my soul your soul was black our Natures were corrupted amen but he come down he spilled his blood into your life once you accepted that sacrifice changed your nature changed your entire being shifted your your motives and your everything and turned it turned it towards the heavenly amen that's what the mediator is here this morning amen he's there amen amen to bring Heaven and Earth here this morning amen if you're sin sick and your soul amen he can bring you Amen to that that atmosphere where you can be changed amen where your life can be changed amen where God can deposit himself into you this morning hey man if you're sick this morning we can call on his name and when there's power in the name of Jesus and then we can call on his name this morning amen if you're weary this morning if you're down and out amen he's here to lift you up amen he brought us happiness brought us joy amen amen he gave himself for a ransom he gave himself amen he gave himself in exchange for what that price was he gave himself and I'll just close here here shortly Galatians 1 3 and Grace be to you from God the father and from our Lord Jesus Christ who gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our father amen Jesus done all that amen not that we not that we could sit by that we could
