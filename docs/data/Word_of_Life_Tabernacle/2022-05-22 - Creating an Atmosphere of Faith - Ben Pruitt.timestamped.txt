[1:01:05] you here
[1:01:06] this morning amen acts chapter 2 and
[1:01:09] verse 1
[1:01:12] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[1:01:14] come
[1:01:15] they were all with one accord in one
[1:01:17] place
[1:01:18] and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:01:20] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[1:01:23] and it filled all the house where they
[1:01:26] were sitting
[1:01:27] and there appeared unto them cloven
[1:01:29] tongues like as a fire
[1:01:31] and it sat upon each of them
[1:01:34] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:01:36] ghost all that you would give us a
[1:01:38] refilling this morning
[1:01:40] began to speak with other tongues as the
[1:01:42] spirit
[1:01:43] gave them utterance i pray the lord
[1:01:45] would add his blessing to the word you
[1:01:46] may be seated this morning
[1:01:50] to have the rest of my family here as
[1:01:51] well my sisters and their husbands
[1:01:54] enjoyed that guitar playing this morning
[1:01:56] i always love to hear that
[1:02:01] you know an atmosphere is a surrounding
[1:02:04] influence or environment
[1:02:07] when a bird lays an egg
[1:02:10] the egg has to be kept in a certain
[1:02:12] atmosphere to hatch
[1:02:14] so if the egg was laid say a chicken
[1:02:16] would lay an egg the egg would never
[1:02:18] hatch in the environment that it's in
[1:02:21] when it is born into the world it comes
[1:02:23] into the world
[1:02:24] but it actually has to uh have the
[1:02:27] environment created by its mother and
[1:02:30] god equipped the mother with a special
[1:02:32] set of feathers and the ability and and
[1:02:35] the know-how the instinct to
[1:02:38] hover down or brood over the chicken to
[1:02:41] actually make it hatch out of the egg
[1:02:43] and the bible talks about that in
[1:02:45] deuteronomy chapter 32 and verse 11 it
[1:02:47] says as an eagle stireth up her nest
[1:02:51] uttereth over her young and that word
[1:02:52] means to brood or or to move over her
[1:02:56] young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh
[1:02:59] them
[1:03:00] beareth them on her wings so god jehovah
[1:03:02] god says i'm like that mother eagle to
[1:03:05] you i i care for you i'm brooding over
[1:03:08] you i'm creating an atmosphere over you
[1:03:11] so that you can
[1:03:13] you can be born you can make it into the
[1:03:15] new land that's flowing with milk and
[1:03:17] honey and in a in a spiritual way today
[1:03:20] our god still says the same thing he
[1:03:23] says i'm brooding over you today i'm i'm
[1:03:25] working in your life i'm creating an
[1:03:27] atmosphere
[1:03:29] something that you could
[1:03:30] you could actually begin to bear fruit
[1:03:33] and bring forth what god would have in
[1:03:35] your life and so
[1:03:37] we find that it means to hover or to
[1:03:39] brood and the same word is used in
[1:03:42] genesis 1 in genesis 1 2 where it says
[1:03:45] the earth was without form and void
[1:03:48] and darkness was upon the face of the
[1:03:50] deep and the spirit of god
[1:03:52] moved that word moved is to brood over
[1:03:55] the face of the waters to brood over the
[1:03:58] face of the waters the creator if you
[1:04:00] can imagine the chaos that was then and
[1:04:03] how that it was such a
[1:04:04] a condition of darkness and a condition
[1:04:07] of chaos and the spirit of god came on
[1:04:09] that chaos and began to brood over it
[1:04:12] begin to the random put it this way he
[1:04:14] said it was making love to it it was it
[1:04:16] was cooing to it it's brooding over it
[1:04:19] and he said it began to
[1:04:21] begin to bring an atmosphere over the
[1:04:23] earth that would not it would not have
[1:04:25] come to the place where it is now where
[1:04:27] it's habitable for life where there's
[1:04:29] where there's people on it where there's
[1:04:31] trees on it where there are all the
[1:04:33] seeds that were there in that in that
[1:04:35] world that was it would not become what
[1:04:38] it what it was in the garden of eden
[1:04:40] unless the spirit of god moved on the
[1:04:42] face of the waters to make it what it
[1:04:44] was let me tell you this you'll never be
[1:04:46] a christian the way god wants you to be
[1:04:49] without being in an atmosphere of faith
[1:04:51] you've got to have an atmosphere around
[1:04:54] you that is an atmosphere that will
[1:04:56] cause you to believe and not doubt the
[1:04:59] word of god
[1:05:00] and the atmosphere of the world won't do
[1:05:02] that because the atmosphere of the world
[1:05:04] is there to try to get you to disbelief
[1:05:07] it's there to try to make you worry it's
[1:05:09] there to try to say god's not real it's
[1:05:12] there to try to make it where you can't
[1:05:14] feel god you can't know god to try to
[1:05:16] make you doubt the word of god try to
[1:05:18] make you doubt everything about what
[1:05:20] you've been taught about the word but
[1:05:22] god if you can if you can go get away
[1:05:24] from that and come into the atmosphere
[1:05:26] of the word that's what we're doing here
[1:05:27] this morning and the word tells you you
[1:05:29] are a christian you are a child of god
[1:05:32] you you're a son or daughter of god
[1:05:34] you're the bride of jesus christ you
[1:05:36] were born to win you're born to you were
[1:05:38] created to do something in this world
[1:05:40] and so he creates it creates an
[1:05:42] atmosphere that then you can begin to
[1:05:44] birth things out of your life you can
[1:05:46] begin to become what god wants you to be
[1:05:49] he don't want you to be frowning all the
[1:05:50] time he don't want you to be unhappy he
[1:05:52] don't want you to be sad he don't want
[1:05:54] you to live your life in depression he
[1:05:56] don't want you to live your life in some
[1:05:58] kind of a worry but he wants you to be
[1:06:00] happy he wants you to live free he wants
[1:06:02] you to be able to rejoice he wants you
[1:06:04] to be able to worship him that's his
[1:06:06] whole purpose in creating you is to
[1:06:08] worship him right
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:11] and god put a thirst within us for that
[1:06:13] yes he put a desire within us just to
[1:06:16] worship him something inside of us just
[1:06:19] to just to call out to him
[1:06:21] and we fill that void with with other
[1:06:24] things with alcohol or cigarettes or or
[1:06:26] the world things of the world that's a
[1:06:28] void there's something there it's not
[1:06:30] that the desire is wrong see the problem
[1:06:32] is not that the desire is too strong but
[1:06:34] the desire is too weak
[1:06:36] it's satisfied with things of the world
[1:06:38] but if the desire could ever get strong
[1:06:40] enough that we could say that don't
[1:06:42] satisfy me anymore i've tried those
[1:06:45] things that don't work no more i want to
[1:06:47] desire something inside of me that'll cr
[1:06:50] that wants god that won't settle for
[1:06:52] anything less than god
[1:06:55] hey man is that why you're here this
[1:06:56] morning
[1:06:57] i trust that it is
[1:06:59] because there's some things only god can
[1:07:01] do
[1:07:03] in that atmosphere of chaos
[1:07:06] when the world was all the elements just
[1:07:09] all over the place without form and void
[1:07:13] only god
[1:07:14] could turn that atmosphere of chaos
[1:07:17] into the world that we have yes
[1:07:20] even today that's beautiful and even
[1:07:23] though scarred by sin yet we see the
[1:07:25] world in in order in the natural world
[1:07:28] and you look at that say what could do
[1:07:30] that only god could do that
[1:07:32] are you with me this morning
[1:07:34] only god could do that then what could
[1:07:36] take an atmosphere of chaos in your life
[1:07:39] an atmosphere of chaos in your family
[1:07:41] what could take and bring order to that
[1:07:45] what could possibly bring an order to
[1:07:47] where a family is at peace with one
[1:07:50] another where a church is at peace with
[1:07:52] one another where people can receive
[1:07:54] from god where they can believe god what
[1:07:56] can bring that order it takes an
[1:07:58] atmosphere of the holy spirit brooding
[1:08:00] over the people it takes the word being
[1:08:03] preached and then the atmosphere
[1:08:05] producing what the word says
[1:08:09] so now we find the spirit of god moving
[1:08:11] on the face of the waters the creator
[1:08:13] making an atmosphere for life
[1:08:15] brooding over the seeds
[1:08:18] that were planted
[1:08:20] god's planted seeds in your life
[1:08:22] there's a word there that's been put in
[1:08:24] your life over the years that's been
[1:08:26] placed in there and he wants that seed
[1:08:28] of healing to come up he wants that seed
[1:08:31] of joy to come up he wants that that
[1:08:34] expression in your life but he's got in
[1:08:36] order to do that you got to let him
[1:08:38] brood over you
[1:08:39] you've got to be in an atmosphere
[1:08:42] that will be conducive to that now
[1:08:45] a bird again may lay a lot of eggs but
[1:08:48] if she doesn't brood over them they'll
[1:08:49] never come to life
[1:08:51] so she creates an atmosphere for the egg
[1:08:53] to be born you say well how will there
[1:08:55] be an atmosphere around me well you are
[1:08:58] a creator
[1:09:00] do you know that
[1:09:01] you're a creator look at genesis 1 27 it
[1:09:05] says so god created man
[1:09:08] in his own image yes in his own image
[1:09:11] what is god the creator
[1:09:15] right he's the creator of heaven and
[1:09:17] earth
[1:09:18] so god created man
[1:09:21] in his own image what was the difference
[1:09:23] in the man and all the other animals and
[1:09:24] the birds and everything else only god
[1:09:26] could create
[1:09:29] are you with me now satan was an angel
[1:09:31] you remember when he fell from heaven
[1:09:32] satan couldn't create right satan can
[1:09:35] only pervert yes
[1:09:37] right as cancer is is a cell that's been
[1:09:40] perverted by satan
[1:09:42] right and whatever sickness in your body
[1:09:44] it's something that's been perverted by
[1:09:46] satan the world that we live in
[1:09:48] is it's always the right thing that god
[1:09:50] made perverted in some in some way
[1:09:53] that's not according to the word of god
[1:09:54] and so satan is a perverter a deformer
[1:09:57] but god is a creator so if god is create
[1:10:00] a creator and he created you
[1:10:03] in his own image
[1:10:05] what does that make you
[1:10:07] the brown says let me tell you something
[1:10:09] each man that's born again with the
[1:10:10] spirit of god in him is a miniature
[1:10:13] creator
[1:10:14] he said now that might shake you a
[1:10:16] little but that's the truth
[1:10:18] he said we're in the image of god god is
[1:10:20] a creator he said that's the reason that
[1:10:22] you can believe that god could heal a
[1:10:24] person because god is in you
[1:10:27] and god made this world he just spoken
[1:10:29] and his word became material the very
[1:10:32] ground that you're setting on i love
[1:10:34] this it's not just church but the ground
[1:10:37] that we're sitting on how can we deny
[1:10:38] the existence of god how can we rebel
[1:10:41] against god the ground that we're
[1:10:42] sitting on the dirt underneath the
[1:10:44] concrete and the chairs and everything
[1:10:47] that you're sitting on the dirt
[1:10:48] underneath you what's holding you up is
[1:10:50] the very word of god
[1:10:52] made manifest he said let there be and
[1:10:54] there was yes
[1:10:56] right so we don't rebel against his word
[1:10:58] whatever his word says is right because
[1:11:01] what we're setting on is the word of god
[1:11:02] made manifest he just spoke it it turned
[1:11:04] it into existence he believed in his own
[1:11:07] word
[1:11:08] oh my he said if a man born of the
[1:11:10] spirit of god he's an offspring of god
[1:11:12] and that part of god is in him and he
[1:11:14] believes every word that god says
[1:11:16] will materialize
[1:11:18] and so that makes him part of god the
[1:11:20] holy spirit and the man makes him a part
[1:11:21] of god he said now
[1:11:23] so now he's going to begin to deal with
[1:11:25] how we are a creator specifically of
[1:11:27] atmosphere
[1:11:28] he said did you ever see people nice
[1:11:30] people but you just couldn't hardly
[1:11:32] stand to be around them
[1:11:36] oh we're going
[1:11:38] we won't point anybody out today
[1:11:42] he said sure you have
[1:11:44] you don't have nothing against them but
[1:11:46] you can't stand to be around them he
[1:11:48] said then you've seen some person maybe
[1:11:50] a little old scrawny fellow a little old
[1:11:52] woman been over a wash tub but you just
[1:11:54] love to be around that person
[1:11:57] you just love them somehow
[1:11:59] it's the atmosphere that they've got
[1:12:01] around them yes the way they live
[1:12:04] they create an atmosphere that you like
[1:12:06] to be into he said that's lovely people
[1:12:09] to be with now brother branham when he
[1:12:11] tells us then he begins to tell a story
[1:12:12] and i won't read you the story but i'll
[1:12:15] tell you parts of it and you can go back
[1:12:16] and find it he tells the story about
[1:12:18] some chaos that was in his home and many
[1:12:21] times that happens in a minister's home
[1:12:22] i know a little bit about that because
[1:12:24] sometimes
[1:12:25] they're just calls that you have to take
[1:12:27] there's times you got to go out and eat
[1:12:29] there's times that you got my wife and i
[1:12:31] some many times on our anniversary we've
[1:12:33] had to move things around and and to
[1:12:36] accommodate things going on in the
[1:12:37] ministry you just you have to do it and
[1:12:39] just in everyday life but i can't relate
[1:12:42] really to that kind of ministry that he
[1:12:43] had where he had that
[1:12:45] the people coming in all the time
[1:12:47] wanting to pray for
[1:12:48] pray for him you know as a pastor you
[1:12:51] want people to want to to be prayed for
[1:12:53] because you believe that's the word of
[1:12:55] god and people can get help not because
[1:12:56] you can help them because the word says
[1:12:58] that you want people to want to be
[1:13:00] prayed for but brother branham people
[1:13:02] believed in his ministry and they
[1:13:03] believed in what god did so they came to
[1:13:05] be prayed for from everywhere even a
[1:13:07] possum came to be prayed for one time
[1:13:09] and it was healed and so people would
[1:13:11] come to the house and
[1:13:13] they would wander through the house they
[1:13:14] knock on the door and people don't
[1:13:16] realize sometimes they're desperate for
[1:13:17] healing they want to be healed and so
[1:13:19] they would come in the house and they'd
[1:13:20] come in the kitchen and they'd come in
[1:13:22] the in the dining room in the living
[1:13:24] room and brother branham would have to
[1:13:25] leave the house to escape them but guess
[1:13:27] what his wife was still there and she
[1:13:29] had to deal with it just constant phone
[1:13:31] calls just just around around the clock
[1:13:33] just constant and so he's dealing with
[1:13:35] that chaos in his home and whenever that
[1:13:38] happens in a home it creates an
[1:13:39] environment or an atmosphere
[1:13:41] of chaos and so he found that his wife
[1:13:44] was standing trying to do the dishes she
[1:13:46] was crying the kids were fighting with
[1:13:48] each other because it seems like that
[1:13:50] always happens if the devil can't get to
[1:13:52] you he'll try to get to your wife or to
[1:13:54] your children or to somebody around you
[1:13:56] because he wants to upset the atmosphere
[1:13:58] and that's why sometimes it i've seen it
[1:14:00] many times especially with mothers that
[1:14:03] children the devil worked through not
[1:14:04] that the children are devils but the
[1:14:06] devil worked through the children to try
[1:14:08] to make an atmosphere that's so upset
[1:14:10] that you can't ever think about god you
[1:14:12] don't even have time to go to church you
[1:14:14] don't have time because you're always
[1:14:15] caring for the children sometimes even
[1:14:17] if they're adults but listen that's the
[1:14:19] devil trying to get in that place you've
[1:14:20] got to be a creator and create an
[1:14:22] atmosphere that'll change them right
[1:14:26] right and so now here that was the
[1:14:28] situation that he was in now uh he he
[1:14:31] caused the atmosphere to be different
[1:14:34] now he said now my wife's sitting there
[1:14:35] and she was crying so i said now the
[1:14:37] only thing for me to do now heavenly
[1:14:39] father
[1:14:40] in my heart he was saying this i said is
[1:14:42] to create a different situation here i
[1:14:45] wonder if we could believe that we could
[1:14:46] do that that wasn't limited to brother
[1:14:48] branham but branham just came to show us
[1:14:50] that it could be done yes right right
[1:14:53] every one of us are creators yes
[1:14:55] we were created in the image of god
[1:14:58] so we are miniature creators we have the
[1:15:00] ability to create an atmosphere for for
[1:15:04] the people of god and for the people
[1:15:06] around us for our families that we could
[1:15:08] be at peace and in that peaceful
[1:15:09] atmosphere then god can begin to work it
[1:15:12] becomes an atmosphere of faith so he
[1:15:14] come and
[1:15:15] how did he do it and you all know the
[1:15:17] story many of you do he come and he put
[1:15:19] his arm around his wife you come up
[1:15:21] behind her like you will many times when
[1:15:23] she's doing the dishes because i just
[1:15:24] really appreciate it when my wife does
[1:15:26] the dishes i don't know about you but
[1:15:28] that means i don't have to do them
[1:15:31] right so many times i'll come up behind
[1:15:33] her i'll put my arm around her now
[1:15:34] that's touch
[1:15:36] you can create an atmosphere by touch
[1:15:39] you remember how hard it was during
[1:15:41] coven when we couldn't shake hands with
[1:15:42] one another it seemed nobody wanted to
[1:15:44] shake hands nobody wanted to get within
[1:15:46] six feet of each other how difficult
[1:15:48] that was why because there's no
[1:15:49] atmosphere
[1:15:51] because we're creating even when brother
[1:15:52] allen had you get up and shake hands
[1:15:54] with one another that you're creating an
[1:15:55] atmosphere by just by touching one
[1:15:57] another's hand you're creating an
[1:15:59] atmosphere of fellowship
[1:16:01] right right touch does that we're human
[1:16:03] beings we're we're touched by touch if
[1:16:05] you could say it that way and so touch
[1:16:07] does that he put his arm around her and
[1:16:09] so he began to he began to come and he
[1:16:11] and by example that he famously took an
[1:16:14] apron and put it on yeah
[1:16:16] right and
[1:16:18] we don't go too far down this this road
[1:16:19] but
[1:16:20] he put on an apron and he worked there
[1:16:23] with her and washed the dishes yeah and
[1:16:26] we think about that story and it shows
[1:16:27] what was he doing though he was creating
[1:16:29] an atmosphere by what by his touch
[1:16:32] and by the things he touched and by his
[1:16:34] example
[1:16:36] and then by words
[1:16:38] yes he began to speak positive things
[1:16:41] and if you go back to the different
[1:16:42] times that he tells the story he'll tell
[1:16:45] it and he'll say what he was saying to
[1:16:46] his wife and he began to tell her how
[1:16:48] the healings had taken place that day
[1:16:50] and and began to give testimony to the
[1:16:53] things god had done and then he began to
[1:16:55] tell her about
[1:16:56] a dress that he'd seen or something that
[1:16:58] he'd seen and how they were going to go
[1:16:59] out to eat and they were going to take a
[1:17:01] ride later what was he doing by using
[1:17:03] positive words instead of coming in and
[1:17:05] saying woman you better straighten up
[1:17:07] you've got to believe i'm a man of god
[1:17:08] but he didn't do that he come in and
[1:17:10] created an atmosphere so that she could
[1:17:13] calm down so that they could actually
[1:17:15] have peace so god could work
[1:17:17] so he come in and and he began to speak
[1:17:19] those things and he began to tell her
[1:17:21] now we're going to take a vacation and
[1:17:22] the kids can go catch some trout and
[1:17:24] won't that be a good time and she said
[1:17:26] oh yes it will after a while she began
[1:17:28] to smile and she began to she began to
[1:17:31] respond positively because he was
[1:17:33] speaking positive things whenever you go
[1:17:35] into a negative situation and you go in
[1:17:38] and begin to speak negative words in a
[1:17:40] negative situation you just double the
[1:17:42] negativity all you're doing is poisoning
[1:17:45] an already poisoned atmosphere
[1:17:48] right
[1:17:49] right and that's why you can't you got
[1:17:50] to balance the word and we don't preach
[1:17:52] just a a gospel that's
[1:17:55] easy believism and just one that
[1:17:58] you come and be as you are but no we
[1:18:00] believe in a god who changes things
[1:18:02] we believe in a god who makes things
[1:18:04] different
[1:18:05] and yet you can't get all the way over
[1:18:06] on the negative side where you preach
[1:18:09] at sin all the time because we but we
[1:18:11] don't believe we believe god can save
[1:18:13] you from sin but you've got to keep it
[1:18:15] balanced because if you don't you create
[1:18:17] a poisonous atmosphere in the church
[1:18:19] that people just come under condemnation
[1:18:21] and sit there all of the time and
[1:18:23] eventually they they leave under that
[1:18:25] condemnation because people don't like
[1:18:26] to be a human being wasn't made to be in
[1:18:29] an atmosphere like that but you are you
[1:18:31] need to know that you're a sinner you
[1:18:33] need to feel conviction for that there's
[1:18:35] times when you need to hear the word of
[1:18:36] god skin you alive and take everything
[1:18:39] off of you god washes us by the water of
[1:18:41] the word but you also need to know that
[1:18:43] there's hope for you that there's light
[1:18:45] at the end of the tunnel that there's
[1:18:46] strength that god can give you to
[1:18:48] overcome no matter how deep you've gone
[1:18:50] no matter how black it is that you can
[1:18:52] see god and know god for yourself yes
[1:18:54] all right
[1:18:56] so now
[1:18:57] he he did that he began to speak
[1:18:59] positive words
[1:19:01] you know sometimes doing a work for god
[1:19:03] can be overwhelming yes and i'm speaking
[1:19:06] now to those of you who have an office
[1:19:07] in the church of some kind
[1:19:09] be careful with your family
[1:19:11] because sometimes doing a work for god
[1:19:13] whether it's a deacon or a trustee or
[1:19:16] or a song leader or a pastor or a
[1:19:18] minister
[1:19:19] it can be overwhelming to your family it
[1:19:21] can create a chaos in the home because
[1:19:23] of the obligations that you have
[1:19:26] so we have to be careful of that and
[1:19:27] make sure
[1:19:28] that we're being a creator at home
[1:19:31] with our words god help me to do that
[1:19:34] many times i failed to do that and yet
[1:19:35] i've seen when i have done it the
[1:19:37] positive results that it that it gets
[1:19:40] god's word works yes
[1:19:44] now so he said you just keep believing
[1:19:46] when he gets done telling the story he
[1:19:48] said you just keep believing
[1:19:50] create the atmosphere
[1:19:52] never let doubt come around you
[1:19:55] believe all the time how many could do
[1:19:57] that this morning believe all the time
[1:19:59] don't accompany any of that doubt at all
[1:20:02] no sir no matter what the circumstances
[1:20:04] is push your way down walk right on
[1:20:06] through it just refuse it yes sir don't
[1:20:08] give no grounds at all listen you don't
[1:20:10] have an option over whether or not
[1:20:11] you're sick if you're sick you're sick
[1:20:13] you don't have an option about that but
[1:20:15] you do have an option whether you're
[1:20:16] going to be depressed about it you do
[1:20:18] have an option whether you're going to
[1:20:19] be whether you're going to
[1:20:21] spend your life worrying about it you've
[1:20:23] got options in doing that you say well
[1:20:25] the devil has stolen things from me but
[1:20:27] you have an option you can go get them
[1:20:29] back
[1:20:30] and even if you died on the journey at
[1:20:32] least you'd be on the way and then you'd
[1:20:34] have it all come on yes sir
[1:20:36] right you'd have it all because once you
[1:20:38] leave this body to be absent from the
[1:20:40] body is to be present with the lord
[1:20:42] right
[1:20:43] so but sometimes we we we just don't
[1:20:46] refuse it like we should you need to not
[1:20:48] sign for that box of rattlesnakes just
[1:20:50] because it was delivered in your name
[1:20:52] and just because you feel it doesn't
[1:20:53] mean
[1:20:54] that it's yours
[1:20:57] so now with with his words and his
[1:20:58] actions he was creating an atmosphere of
[1:21:01] faith and brother madam said the reason
[1:21:03] why some people are
[1:21:04] you you want to be around him he said
[1:21:06] it's because of the atmosphere that you
[1:21:07] create for you as a son of god or a
[1:21:09] miniature creator because you're a part
[1:21:11] of god and that's the reason you can
[1:21:12] believe the bible for anything it says
[1:21:15] yes right for the word is god's word you
[1:21:18] being a part of god will agree with the
[1:21:20] word yes
[1:21:21] he said that do you understand the
[1:21:23] reason people said this was not inspired
[1:21:25] and that is not inspired and this is for
[1:21:27] another day it's because they have never
[1:21:29] come in contact
[1:21:32] oh my he said no matter how many degrees
[1:21:34] they can show that has nothing to do
[1:21:35] with it but they've never become in
[1:21:37] contact with god to be born again oh
[1:21:39] they may have jumped they may have did
[1:21:40] this they may have a phd they may have
[1:21:42] spoken tongues they may have danced in
[1:21:44] the spirit but jesus said by their fruit
[1:21:46] you shall know them for where the spirit
[1:21:48] of god is there is love right
[1:21:51] there's not hate with the spirit of god
[1:21:53] he's all i have a revelation if it
[1:21:54] produces hate it's not a revelation from
[1:21:56] god
[1:21:58] whether where the spirit of god is
[1:22:00] there's love there's understanding
[1:22:01] there's something that you like to be
[1:22:03] around that's right yes
[1:22:05] amen
[1:22:07] and see he's given you the ability to
[1:22:09] become this creator this miniature
[1:22:11] creator john 1 says that he in the
[1:22:13] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:22:15] god and the word was god and the word
[1:22:16] became flesh and dwelt among us but it
[1:22:18] said that the world that he came to he
[1:22:20] came to his own but his own received him
[1:22:22] not but as many as received him verse 12
[1:22:24] to them gave he power
[1:22:26] to become the sons of god
[1:22:29] power to become creators power to be in
[1:22:32] his image even to them that believe
[1:22:35] on his name right
[1:22:36] now we'll fast forward to our text
[1:22:38] because all of that was background and
[1:22:40] we'll get to what we're preaching on
[1:22:41] this morning as we begin to move through
[1:22:43] this now this is what pentecost was all
[1:22:45] about right
[1:22:47] right god was giving them the power to
[1:22:49] become sons
[1:22:51] at pentecost
[1:22:53] the promise of the holy spirit had been
[1:22:54] given to the disciples by jesus christ
[1:22:57] but they were told to terry until the
[1:22:59] promise came
[1:23:01] that that so that during the time
[1:23:03] that they were tarrying
[1:23:05] they made ready for it by creating a
[1:23:08] right atmosphere yes
[1:23:10] now think about it we know that they did
[1:23:11] that because of acts 2 1.
[1:23:13] it says when the day of pentecost was
[1:23:15] fully come
[1:23:17] they were all with one accord
[1:23:20] in one place
[1:23:22] right
[1:23:23] now that don't just happen
[1:23:25] yeah
[1:23:26] right that don't just happen
[1:23:29] you don't put 120 people especially 120
[1:23:33] jewish people
[1:23:35] in the same room
[1:23:37] yes
[1:23:39] you don't put 120 arkansans in the same
[1:23:41] room either
[1:23:42] especially message believers
[1:23:46] and expect there to be one accord all at
[1:23:49] once now the holy ghost hadn't come yet
[1:23:51] right
[1:23:52] but they were already in one accord
[1:23:54] and in one place
[1:23:56] because each one of them was a creator
[1:23:58] now let's see how they did it just as we
[1:24:00] saw how brother branham created that
[1:24:02] atmosphere in his home let's see how
[1:24:04] they did it on the day of pentecost but
[1:24:06] the random says this he said god is
[1:24:07] still the same that he ever was the
[1:24:08] people gets away from god but god
[1:24:10] remains the same his nature is power his
[1:24:12] desire is always the same through every
[1:24:14] generation it never changes it's always
[1:24:16] the same it's the people that get away
[1:24:18] from god not god from the people they
[1:24:19] lose their faith god covers all space
[1:24:22] all everywhere he's all not present so
[1:24:24] he's everywhere he's always has been
[1:24:25] everywhere he always will be everywhere
[1:24:28] but it's the attitude of the people that
[1:24:30] brings the results you realize as much
[1:24:31] as i would want to i can't make you be
[1:24:33] healed i can't make you be saved i can't
[1:24:36] force you to do anything you're you're
[1:24:38] born a free moral agent you're you're
[1:24:40] born that way you're that way where you
[1:24:41] have the right to make a decision i
[1:24:43] can't make you do that but if you have
[1:24:45] the right attitude i can preach the word
[1:24:47] these brothers can preach the word and
[1:24:49] we can sing about the things of god and
[1:24:51] we can create an atmosphere so that if
[1:24:53] you have the right attitude it'll bring
[1:24:54] a right attitude around you when you
[1:24:56] have the right attitude then you can
[1:24:58] receive from god it's the attitude of
[1:25:00] the people that brings the results
[1:25:02] that's the reason at pentecost they had
[1:25:04] to go to an upper room and pray until
[1:25:06] the holy ghost came because they got in
[1:25:08] one place and one accord it's the
[1:25:10] atmosphere what brings the results he
[1:25:12] said let every man and woman in this
[1:25:14] building this morning boy or girl get
[1:25:16] everything from their minds but the lord
[1:25:17] jesus i read you this quote the other
[1:25:18] day but it fits just right in here he
[1:25:20] said and believe that he's standing
[1:25:22] present right now do you believe that
[1:25:24] that's what you have to believe you got
[1:25:26] to create an atmosphere so that you
[1:25:28] believe he's here and then if you
[1:25:29] believe he's here he's able to do
[1:25:31] anything because he's god right
[1:25:33] right you believe he's here he's
[1:25:35] standing present right now and you'll
[1:25:36] see something happening oh i pray that
[1:25:39] god would help us today that we'll
[1:25:40] believe you'll see something happening
[1:25:42] that'll cause headlines in the newspaper
[1:25:44] in the morning right
[1:25:46] he said right this night while we're
[1:25:47] sitting here if this right atmosphere
[1:25:49] would take place this entire group would
[1:25:50] be refilled with the holy ghost
[1:25:53] every sick person would be made well
[1:25:55] it's the atmosphere that does it said
[1:25:57] you can take a head egg and put it in an
[1:25:58] incubator and keep the atmosphere right
[1:26:00] it'll hatch out a chicken not an
[1:26:02] incubator he said because that is it's
[1:26:04] the atmosphere that counts put a chicken
[1:26:06] egg under a dog it'll hatch a chicken
[1:26:09] he said it's the atmosphere yes not our
[1:26:12] dog he jumps around too much
[1:26:15] he said that's what it takes in the
[1:26:16] church today
[1:26:18] not so much starchy creed in theology
[1:26:21] but the spirit of the living god
[1:26:24] pouring down upon among his people upon
[1:26:27] his people to bring a spiritual
[1:26:29] atmosphere
[1:26:31] he said do you know when the holy ghost
[1:26:32] first came it was on the day of
[1:26:34] pentecost when they were all in one
[1:26:35] place and one accord and there came from
[1:26:36] heaven and sound like a rushing mighty
[1:26:38] wind that had to get the atmosphere
[1:26:40] right now again how did they do that how
[1:26:42] did 11 disciples let alone over 100
[1:26:45] other jews 120 jews how did they ever
[1:26:48] get into that right atmosphere now think
[1:26:49] about it they were in one place in one
[1:26:52] accord where before the 11 disciples
[1:26:55] couldn't even agree
[1:26:57] about who was the greatest
[1:26:59] right constantly they were seeing
[1:27:01] miracles they were seeing signs and
[1:27:02] wonders they were walking with god
[1:27:04] literally
[1:27:06] god was in flesh walking among them and
[1:27:08] yet they could not agree they wanted to
[1:27:10] know who would sit on his right hand and
[1:27:12] on his left hand they wanted to know
[1:27:14] everything about it they wanted to know
[1:27:16] how much how much money they would have
[1:27:18] in the new kingdom they they fought over
[1:27:20] who was the greatest they fought about
[1:27:22] just about everything he said they
[1:27:23] didn't understand many many left but the
[1:27:26] 11th state but many had already left and
[1:27:28] and even when he when he left the earth
[1:27:30] there were 500 that saw him go up that
[1:27:32] saw the ascension but only 120 of them
[1:27:35] 380 of them disappeared because it was
[1:27:37] just too hard they couldn't get along
[1:27:39] but there was 120 and i'm so thankful
[1:27:41] for the 120 that put aside their
[1:27:43] differences and put aside their who was
[1:27:46] the greatest and put aside all of that
[1:27:48] and said you know what we're going to
[1:27:49] believe the word today we're going to
[1:27:51] come together in an upper room and we're
[1:27:53] going to believe that god will do what
[1:27:54] he said
[1:27:56] could we do that today
[1:27:58] if we could come together in one accord
[1:28:00] in one place we could see the same
[1:28:02] results yes sir
[1:28:04] right
[1:28:05] amen
[1:28:06] now the first thing they obeyed the word
[1:28:08] yes in luke chapter 24 and verse 49 he
[1:28:11] said tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:28:13] until
[1:28:14] you be endued with power from one high
[1:28:17] so they didn't get up at the first day
[1:28:18] and say well i think we've been here
[1:28:20] long enough i think we know enough about
[1:28:22] it i think we could go now and do what
[1:28:24] god asked us to do they didn't do that
[1:28:25] he said perry until and notice he didn't
[1:28:29] they did what he told them to do he said
[1:28:32] terry
[1:28:34] he didn't even say pray
[1:28:36] he just said terry now they may have
[1:28:37] prayed but he didn't say pray he said
[1:28:38] terror
[1:28:40] do what he says to do
[1:28:42] he didn't tell him to stand on your head
[1:28:44] but if he had
[1:28:45] they'd have been standing on their head
[1:28:47] for 10 days
[1:28:48] yeah sure right
[1:28:50] moses he said moses take your shoes off
[1:28:53] but the brandon said he didn't tell him
[1:28:54] to take his hat off right he said take
[1:28:56] your shoes off he said take his hat off
[1:28:58] he took his hat off
[1:29:00] he said take off your shoes yes right
[1:29:02] and so he just did what god said yes
[1:29:04] that's how simple it is to come in an
[1:29:06] atmosphere of faith
[1:29:08] just do what god said yes right just
[1:29:11] just do what god said did god say to
[1:29:13] come together to god say to forgive one
[1:29:15] another yes if he said to forgive one
[1:29:17] another what do you do just forgive yes
[1:29:19] but you don't understand my situation
[1:29:20] you don't know what i've been through
[1:29:22] forgive yes he said when you stand pray
[1:29:24] and forgive that's not optional right
[1:29:27] right you just do what god says
[1:29:29] did god tell you how to act and what to
[1:29:31] do if it's in his word you just obey it
[1:29:33] yes sir
[1:29:34] and you don't have to obey everything
[1:29:36] everybody adds to it he didn't tell him
[1:29:38] stand on your head he didn't tell him to
[1:29:40] do jumping jacks
[1:29:42] are you with me now you don't have to
[1:29:43] obey everything everybody tells you to
[1:29:45] do but you got to obey the word of god
[1:29:47] yes what did the word say yes
[1:29:51] so that he told them to tear he said do
[1:29:53] that
[1:29:54] and and and they did it
[1:29:57] and so the the bible tells us in first
[1:29:59] daniel 15 22
[1:30:01] that god
[1:30:02] has a delight not in burnt offerings and
[1:30:04] sacrifices but in obeying the voice of
[1:30:06] the lord
[1:30:08] he said behold to obey is better than
[1:30:10] sacrifice
[1:30:11] and to hearken than the fat of brands
[1:30:13] it's better just to obey god than it is
[1:30:15] to make a
[1:30:16] make a big deal and a big show and make
[1:30:18] a lot of noise it's better to simply if
[1:30:20] you'll obey god god will god will
[1:30:22] there'll be noise there'll be there'll
[1:30:23] be something happen but it'll be done by
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:28] and so to obey
[1:30:30] is better than sacrifice
[1:30:33] to hearken or to listen than the fat of
[1:30:35] rams right
[1:30:37] micah 6 6 where shall i come before the
[1:30:39] lord and bow myself before the high god
[1:30:41] shall i come before him with burnt
[1:30:42] offerings with calves of a year old
[1:30:45] will the lord be pleased with thousands
[1:30:47] of rams or with ten thousand rivers of
[1:30:49] oil
[1:30:50] shall i give my firstborn for my
[1:30:52] transgression the fruit of my body for
[1:30:55] the sin of my soul
[1:30:57] oh god yes he said i could do all these
[1:30:59] things i could i could give all my money
[1:31:01] to feed the poor i could i could speak
[1:31:03] in tongues i could prophesy all those
[1:31:05] things are wonderful i could do all
[1:31:07] those things but will god be pleased
[1:31:08] with that
[1:31:10] no he showed the old man what is good
[1:31:14] and what does the lord require of thee
[1:31:16] yes
[1:31:17] oh god
[1:31:18] see god is not pleased just because we
[1:31:20] do things right right
[1:31:22] he's pleased when we do things according
[1:31:24] to his word
[1:31:25] right right he has showed you what is
[1:31:28] good and what does the lord require of
[1:31:30] thee but to do justly to love mercy and
[1:31:33] to walk humbly with thy god
[1:31:35] you'd be better off just resting in the
[1:31:37] grace of jesus christ you'd be better
[1:31:40] off just falling in his arms and saying
[1:31:42] lord i can't do it for myself then you
[1:31:44] would being a legalist and trying to set
[1:31:46] everything up and trying to make your
[1:31:48] life so so high and so holy that it
[1:31:50] would appeal unto god no we believe in
[1:31:52] holiness but it's the holiness of god
[1:31:55] it's the holiness of god it's something
[1:31:57] he puts a desire down inside of us to be
[1:31:59] holy why he won't be pleased with my
[1:32:01] holiness my my my righteousness is like
[1:32:04] filthy rags in front of him
[1:32:06] i can't be clean in front of his
[1:32:08] presence he don't even recognize my own
[1:32:10] effort but he recognizes the blood of
[1:32:12] the lamb
[1:32:14] oh the blood of jesus i love that song
[1:32:16] all the blood of jesus it washes white
[1:32:18] as snow because nothing else will he
[1:32:20] ever be satisfied with
[1:32:23] oh i'll come to god i'll believe i'll
[1:32:25] i'll be a christian when i can quit this
[1:32:27] or i can do that no he wants you to fall
[1:32:29] in the arms of jesus yes
[1:32:31] and he wants you to believe
[1:32:33] and if you really believe those things
[1:32:34] will begin to go from you
[1:32:36] that rebellion will leave you
[1:32:40] what does he want of you to do justly to
[1:32:41] love mercy to walk humbly with god
[1:32:44] see god loves obedience peter
[1:32:46] when he was
[1:32:49] fishing one day he'd fished all night
[1:32:50] caught nothing
[1:32:52] and jesus said
[1:32:54] cast out on the other side
[1:32:57] and peter said lord i fished all night i
[1:32:58] know how to fish
[1:33:00] i'm a good fisherman there ain't nothing
[1:33:02] there yeah
[1:33:03] there ain't nothing worse than sitting
[1:33:05] there all day fishing you ever done that
[1:33:07] you fish all day and they haven't caught
[1:33:08] nothing somebody walks up and says well
[1:33:10] if you do this
[1:33:15] you don't believe i've tried that
[1:33:18] well if you use corn or if you you know
[1:33:21] my grandpa you say
[1:33:22] grandpa fruity'd say if you hold your
[1:33:23] mouth just right
[1:33:26] then you'll catch some fish and off when
[1:33:28] somebody comes and tells you that jesus
[1:33:30] what is in peter's boat and after they
[1:33:32] preached he's preached a meeting from
[1:33:33] the boat and so the people could hear
[1:33:35] him and he says cast out on the other
[1:33:37] side he said we've got we've we've
[1:33:38] fished all night
[1:33:40] he said but that's thy word lord yes
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:45] at thy word lord
[1:33:47] he knew there weren't any fish there now
[1:33:49] you catch it he knew there weren't
[1:33:52] he had fished it all day and all night
[1:33:55] his intelligence told him there was no
[1:33:57] fish every fiber of his being said
[1:33:59] there's no fish there he could not
[1:34:02] intellectually accept what jesus said
[1:34:04] but nevertheless he said that thy word
[1:34:07] oh that's where god wants you to be
[1:34:09] today you may be you may completely be
[1:34:12] able to prove it in your own mind say
[1:34:14] well it can't be that way i can't be
[1:34:16] healed i can't be saved my family's not
[1:34:18] going to make there's no way but if
[1:34:20] you'll just believe his word yes
[1:34:22] at thy word lord
[1:34:25] and the supernatural god caused the ra
[1:34:27] the fish somehow to either be created in
[1:34:30] that spot or be led suddenly to that
[1:34:32] spot not knowing what they were doing
[1:34:34] but a supernatural god filled the nest
[1:34:36] with fish until they break
[1:34:38] and they had to call for help
[1:34:40] oh that same god is here today if you're
[1:34:43] struggling with money if you're
[1:34:44] struggling with those kind of things and
[1:34:46] god says cast out again do what i told
[1:34:48] you believe me pay your tithes go to
[1:34:51] church live for god and he said well
[1:34:53] i've done it i've tried it and it's not
[1:34:54] working but if you'll just do what he
[1:34:56] says
[1:34:58] god will bless you
[1:35:00] amen
[1:35:02] it was a man who was born blind
[1:35:07] and he was born blind the disciples come
[1:35:10] to jesus and they said well
[1:35:11] you know this man must have sanders
[1:35:13] parents which one was it he said they
[1:35:14] haven't sinned
[1:35:15] he said but this was done
[1:35:17] this man was born blind so the works of
[1:35:19] god might be manifested yes
[1:35:21] and john 9 6 said when he had thus
[1:35:23] spoken he sped on the ground
[1:35:26] that's a strange healing yeah god works
[1:35:28] differently almost every time but he
[1:35:30] still works yes
[1:35:32] look at all the healings that happened
[1:35:33] with jesus every time he was different
[1:35:35] circumstances that's the way he saves
[1:35:36] you by the way look at how he brought
[1:35:38] the holy ghost he brought it to some
[1:35:40] before they were baptized some after
[1:35:41] they were baptized some
[1:35:43] some uh the holy ghost fell on them they
[1:35:45] were baptized later in all different
[1:35:47] situations paul had a unique experience
[1:35:48] every one of them had a unique
[1:35:50] experience the thing is you have to have
[1:35:51] an experience
[1:35:53] right you may speak in tongues you may
[1:35:54] shout you may you may have a warm
[1:35:56] feeling as john wesley said he was
[1:35:58] strangely warmed we don't know what it
[1:36:00] is but there'll be something happening
[1:36:02] yes right and so he spit in the grass
[1:36:05] fit on the ground and made clay of the
[1:36:06] spittle and anointed the eyes of the
[1:36:08] blind man with the clay yes well that's
[1:36:10] anti-cova did it regulations isn't it
[1:36:13] and said unto him go wash in the pool of
[1:36:15] siloam
[1:36:17] which means scent
[1:36:18] so he sent him to the pool of scent
[1:36:22] and he went his way and washed and came
[1:36:24] to seeing yes
[1:36:26] you imagine brother branham dramatized
[1:36:28] it he said he's walking along there and
[1:36:30] people ask me where are you going well
[1:36:31] i'm going to the pool of siloam because
[1:36:33] a man told me if i could walk if i'd
[1:36:35] wash there he's walking around with with
[1:36:37] clay all over his eyes where are you
[1:36:38] going
[1:36:40] you look stupid but i'm going down to do
[1:36:42] what god told me to do
[1:36:44] oh they may laugh at you make fun of you
[1:36:46] whatever else but you say i'm healed i'm
[1:36:48] delivered i'm saved the clay may still
[1:36:50] be on my eyes the symptoms may still be
[1:36:52] there but i'm going down to the pool
[1:36:54] because that's where god said to go
[1:36:56] that's what god said to do with simple
[1:36:58] obedience that led them to the upper
[1:37:00] room to be in one mind and one accord
[1:37:03] yes
[1:37:03] amen we've come today listen in this
[1:37:06] service let's bring it let's bring it
[1:37:07] down to our time we've come in obedience
[1:37:09] to the word the bible says not forsaking
[1:37:12] the assembling of ourselves together as
[1:37:14] the manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:37:16] of you say well it has to be at a
[1:37:17] certain time or you have to do a certain
[1:37:19] thing that's not what he said he said
[1:37:20] come together yes
[1:37:23] as a man or some is but exhorting one
[1:37:25] another and so much the more as you see
[1:37:26] the day approaching so in other words
[1:37:28] instead of instead of not coming
[1:37:30] together exhort one another to come
[1:37:32] together
[1:37:34] hey man exhort one another and so much
[1:37:36] the more as you see the day approaching
[1:37:37] james 5 13 tells us what we should do
[1:37:39] when we come together is any among you
[1:37:41] afflicted let him pray
[1:37:43] is any mary let him sing psalms is any
[1:37:46] sick among you let him call for the
[1:37:48] elders of the church let them pray over
[1:37:50] him anointing him with oil in the name
[1:37:52] of the lord and the prayer of faith
[1:37:54] listen shall yes save the sick and the
[1:37:58] lord shall raise him up
[1:38:01] amen and if you committed sins they
[1:38:03] shall be forgiven him
[1:38:06] confess your faults one to another and
[1:38:08] pray one for another that you may be
[1:38:09] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:38:12] righteous man availeth much yes
[1:38:14] amen no we don't obey as i said to earn
[1:38:17] grace
[1:38:18] we obey because of grace yes
[1:38:21] grace come to the blind man and said if
[1:38:23] you'll go to the pool of siloam so he
[1:38:25] obeyed grace
[1:38:27] it wasn't legalism he obeyed grace and
[1:38:30] went washed and he was healed
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] and secondly they come in a unity of
[1:38:35] purpose
[1:38:36] they were with one accord in other words
[1:38:38] one mind
[1:38:40] somehow all these different difficult
[1:38:42] people
[1:38:43] came with one mind to the meeting that
[1:38:45] day
[1:38:46] it may have taken 10 days to get them in
[1:38:48] one mind
[1:38:49] but they were there
[1:38:53] philippians 2 2 says fulfill you my joy
[1:38:55] that you be like-minded having the same
[1:38:57] love
[1:38:58] being of one accord of one mind this was
[1:39:00] not forced we find paul and peter later
[1:39:03] when paul received the holy ghost he
[1:39:04] come back he compared notes with peter
[1:39:06] and they believed the same thing
[1:39:07] why they both had the same guide which
[1:39:10] was the holy ghost they've been led to
[1:39:12] the same thing but the brother said the
[1:39:13] guide isn't going to take one over this
[1:39:14] way one over that way send one east and
[1:39:17] the other one west he's going to keep
[1:39:18] you together yes
[1:39:21] amen
[1:39:23] sometimes i pause for the effect
[1:39:27] i like to pause when i know it might get
[1:39:28] quiet
[1:39:31] the guide won't lead one this way and
[1:39:32] one that way
[1:39:33] the guide brings you together why
[1:39:35] because the words that assemble
[1:39:36] yourselves together right
[1:39:38] right he said he's going to keep you
[1:39:40] together and if we'll just let the holy
[1:39:41] ghost keep us together we'll be one yes
[1:39:45] if you just don't let the devil pull you
[1:39:46] off on the wrong road we'll be one heart
[1:39:49] one mind one accord by one spirit the
[1:39:51] holy spirit the guide of god that will
[1:39:53] guide us to all truth that's right but
[1:39:55] you got to follow your guide
[1:39:57] he said we need the fire of god's love
[1:39:58] in our hearts we can't get warmed by
[1:40:00] some historical doctrine we've got to
[1:40:02] have the holy ghost now you believe that
[1:40:03] today the same spirit that sent
[1:40:05] pentecostal fire in the first day it's
[1:40:07] got to be the same pentecostal fire
[1:40:09] today that's burning their hearts their
[1:40:12] love they die for one another he said
[1:40:14] they went forth with only one objective
[1:40:15] to win souls to christ one motive love
[1:40:18] yes
[1:40:19] oh my that's why we do what we do one
[1:40:21] objective to win souls for christ one
[1:40:23] motive love
[1:40:25] why would you do that why would you go
[1:40:27] for that one person why would you talk
[1:40:28] to that person look what they've done
[1:40:30] one motive one objective love
[1:40:33] yes
[1:40:34] are you hearing me today that's why we
[1:40:35] go we don't go to build kingdoms right
[1:40:38] we don't go to build churches i just got
[1:40:40] to notice this morning i've gotten my uh
[1:40:42] my visa to go and where the lord willing
[1:40:44] will be going to egypt this year and you
[1:40:47] pray for us i'll tell you more about it
[1:40:48] but if we're able to go and haven't
[1:40:50] bought the tickets yet but we've got the
[1:40:52] we've got the things that we need and
[1:40:54] got a budget for it and things and
[1:40:55] they're setting up meetings there's one
[1:40:57] message church in egypt today but i got
[1:40:59] to thinking about that and i thought and
[1:41:01] i struggled with it because it's a lot
[1:41:02] of money and it's a lot of effort and
[1:41:04] you never know what's going to happen in
[1:41:05] a country like that and and we don't
[1:41:08] even release the details of it where
[1:41:09] we'll be and things like that because
[1:41:11] of the
[1:41:13] country and the people that are there
[1:41:14] and things that goes on and terrorism
[1:41:16] and things like that and i thought well
[1:41:18] what would make it worth it what would
[1:41:21] what would be success what would make it
[1:41:22] a success well i tell you if one person
[1:41:25] yes
[1:41:26] if one person would accept christ yes
[1:41:30] would believe in god yes would believe
[1:41:32] the word
[1:41:33] would come and be saved be baptized in
[1:41:36] the name of jesus christ that would be
[1:41:38] worth it yes that's right right and i
[1:41:40] had to struggle with that because i
[1:41:42] don't like doing that but it would be
[1:41:43] worth it i'm gonna be maybe gone for
[1:41:45] about 10 days or two weeks and i thought
[1:41:47] you know and and i i don't want to be
[1:41:49] gone this is where i want to preach all
[1:41:50] the time i have the most freedom here
[1:41:52] because you all have loved me and
[1:41:54] accepted me and this is where i want to
[1:41:55] preach but why do i go sometimes
[1:41:57] somewhere else because because of love
[1:41:59] love constrains us why do we want to do
[1:42:01] something for a church where we can't be
[1:42:04] helped back i'm not intending to build
[1:42:05] another word of life tabernacle over
[1:42:07] there we want to see the gospel preach
[1:42:09] yes are you with me now we're not
[1:42:10] intending on on building our church up
[1:42:13] to some mega church i'd like to see
[1:42:15] ministers go out from this church and
[1:42:16] start churches all over the place i'd
[1:42:19] like to see us fill up so we can empty
[1:42:20] out
[1:42:22] are you with me now that's what i'd like
[1:42:24] to see i'm not building a kingdom we're
[1:42:26] not here to build a kingdom we will go
[1:42:28] forth with one objective i believe
[1:42:29] that's what they did after the day of
[1:42:30] pentecost they went with one objective
[1:42:33] to win souls to christ one motive love
[1:42:37] amen
[1:42:38] they continued daily with one accord in
[1:42:40] the temple breaking bread from house to
[1:42:42] house and ate their meat with gladness
[1:42:46] and singleness notice that word
[1:42:47] singleness of heart one purpose
[1:42:50] the bride brother said must be unified
[1:42:52] together by the word
[1:42:54] my sheep hear my voice and this is his
[1:42:57] voice on printed word
[1:42:59] he said all right you're not unified by
[1:43:00] the word she makes herself ready not
[1:43:03] with the regular creed like esther when
[1:43:05] esther was to be chosen to stand before
[1:43:06] the king she didn't adorn themselves
[1:43:08] with all the things but she adorned
[1:43:10] herself with a sweet meek spirit that's
[1:43:12] what the bride is adorning herself with
[1:43:15] with all the fruits of the spirit
[1:43:16] following what she got assembling
[1:43:18] together oh my this is the bride yes
[1:43:22] this is what a prophet taught the bride
[1:43:23] was assembling together in the
[1:43:25] fellowship of the word
[1:43:27] fellowship of the word that's right
[1:43:28] fellowshipping
[1:43:30] that's that can't be the bride we just
[1:43:32] all stay in our own churches that's not
[1:43:33] what he said yeah
[1:43:34] fellowshipping or we stay in our own
[1:43:36] homes that's not what he said sitting
[1:43:38] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:43:41] jesus tonight one accord one place one
[1:43:44] spirit one mind one hope one god one
[1:43:46] purpose
[1:43:47] every time the bible say anything we say
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:51] amen punctuating every word with amen
[1:43:54] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:43:55] and forever
[1:43:57] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:43:58] jesus christ
[1:44:00] see everything
[1:44:01] it works when you say man let's see how
[1:44:03] much better that is
[1:44:05] everything just amen amen amen right on
[1:44:08] down seeing fellowship you don't have to
[1:44:09] amend what i say but you do have to mean
[1:44:11] amen the word yes
[1:44:14] at least agree with it what were they
[1:44:15] there in the unity of purpose they were
[1:44:17] in one place they were in the unity of
[1:44:18] place i'm closing in just a moment
[1:44:20] in one place and then say i said a
[1:44:22] moment that could mean different things
[1:44:24] to different people
[1:44:26] he said it wasn't a zoom call or a live
[1:44:28] stream
[1:44:31] think about it i've done zoom meetings i
[1:44:33] preached to over 3000 people on a zoom
[1:44:36] meeting in india
[1:44:37] i preached here from the church got up
[1:44:39] at six o'clock in the morning come up
[1:44:40] here and preach over 3000 people sitting
[1:44:43] at their in their separate places
[1:44:44] because covet was so rampant in that
[1:44:47] country at the time was my privilege to
[1:44:48] do that but that's not what pentecost
[1:44:50] was right
[1:44:52] you understand they were with one accord
[1:44:53] in one place
[1:44:55] one place matters as much as the one
[1:44:57] accord
[1:44:58] that's why we come together every
[1:44:59] opportunity that we get see every time
[1:45:02] the bible says something we say amen the
[1:45:05] bible said to be in one accord in one
[1:45:06] place it wasn't a zoom call or a live
[1:45:08] stream stream they weren't together in
[1:45:10] individual homes they were together
[1:45:11] literally together yes
[1:45:13] ever since the garden of eden the people
[1:45:15] of god have come together in that way
[1:45:16] first corinthians chapter 12 tells us
[1:45:18] our comely parts have no need but god
[1:45:20] had tempered the body together tempered
[1:45:22] the body together he's made it fit
[1:45:24] together to where he's talking about
[1:45:26] those parts which have more need the
[1:45:28] parts that are stronger can help the
[1:45:30] parts that are weaker that's the way god
[1:45:31] made it
[1:45:33] we can't do that off by ourselves we
[1:45:35] need to be together
[1:45:36] he said having given more abundant honor
[1:45:38] to that part which lacked that there
[1:45:39] should be no schism in the body but that
[1:45:42] the members should have the same care
[1:45:44] one for another yes so i care for you in
[1:45:47] the way that you care for me and i care
[1:45:49] for my family in the way that i care for
[1:45:51] you for your family you care for my
[1:45:53] family in the way that you care for your
[1:45:54] family
[1:45:56] sure
[1:45:57] i understand there's obligations you
[1:45:58] have to your family you don't have the
[1:46:00] mind but you do have the same care
[1:46:02] because we're the bride of christ
[1:46:04] we're the children of god
[1:46:06] he said having the same care one for
[1:46:07] another when one member suffers all the
[1:46:10] members suffer with it
[1:46:12] one member be honored all the members
[1:46:14] rejoice with such an hour where there's
[1:46:15] no empathy today
[1:46:17] and that scares me
[1:46:19] it scares me when somebody can cut
[1:46:20] themselves off from people and walk away
[1:46:22] and never never have any empathy never
[1:46:24] try to help them yeah i don't care how
[1:46:26] right you are that it's wrong yes right
[1:46:29] there's no empathy in it you see these
[1:46:30] shooters go out and go into a a grocery
[1:46:33] store and start shooting people yeah no
[1:46:35] empathy for people don't care yeah
[1:46:38] don't even care can laugh while they
[1:46:40] shoot people live stream it yeah oh god
[1:46:44] one member suffers and people watch that
[1:46:47] trash
[1:46:49] people kill one another even on a movie
[1:46:52] and and the blood and the gore and the
[1:46:53] destruction people watch that junk
[1:46:56] and laugh at it become immune to its
[1:46:58] effects
[1:47:02] but the bible calls for empathy among
[1:47:04] believers yes
[1:47:06] when one member suffers don't get hard
[1:47:09] church
[1:47:10] when one member suffers we all suffer
[1:47:11] yes when one member is honored all the
[1:47:13] members rejoice with it yes no jealousy
[1:47:16] but the brother said when the holy
[1:47:18] spirit come in the upper room there come
[1:47:19] a sound as a rushing mighty wind he said
[1:47:20] nothing nothing was blowing it just like
[1:47:22] a sound like it was he said it filled
[1:47:24] all the house where they were sitting
[1:47:26] and then cloven tongue sat upon them
[1:47:27] like fire he said how did this great
[1:47:29] pillar of fire the angel of god the
[1:47:31] logos that went out of god that led the
[1:47:33] children of israel to the wilderness
[1:47:34] when it came among these people it
[1:47:36] separated itself and great licks of fire
[1:47:38] began to come on each one as the pillar
[1:47:39] of fire began to break up he said was
[1:47:41] god dividing himself among his people he
[1:47:43] said oh that ought to tear the heart out
[1:47:45] of anybody
[1:47:46] god tearing himself apart where did he
[1:47:48] do that on calvary
[1:47:50] god tearing himself apart that he might
[1:47:53] divide himself a little bit with each
[1:47:55] one of us
[1:47:56] that all together
[1:47:58] he said you see what it means he said
[1:48:00] can you see now why i'm standing for
[1:48:02] unity of every church
[1:48:04] every full gospel church every believer
[1:48:06] we ought to be one heart one mind and
[1:48:08] one accord he said no matter how much we
[1:48:10] differ in the scriptures he said one
[1:48:11] might see it this way that has nothing
[1:48:12] to do with it he talked about how we
[1:48:14] stand on principle not on our different
[1:48:16] ideas but we stand on certain principles
[1:48:18] of the word of god now if those
[1:48:19] principles aren't there and someone
[1:48:21] don't believe in the virgin birth they
[1:48:22] don't believe in jesus they don't
[1:48:23] believe in god they don't believe in the
[1:48:25] things that we've
[1:48:26] the major doctrines it's hard two can't
[1:48:28] walk together unless they want agreed
[1:48:30] but when we have a principles that we
[1:48:32] share we can come together in fellowship
[1:48:34] we don't care about our little differing
[1:48:36] ideas yes right that's what brother
[1:48:38] branham taught us he said oh how i think
[1:48:40] of god separating himself that he might
[1:48:43] dip down i love this into his big soul
[1:48:49] and i just got this mental picture of
[1:48:51] god
[1:48:52] with this great big soul
[1:48:55] and he takes a ladle and he dips down
[1:48:57] into it
[1:48:58] a spoon
[1:49:00] a lay it dips down into it and he pours
[1:49:02] out a little spoonful in me yes a
[1:49:05] spoonful in you
[1:49:09] you see why it's so important that we
[1:49:10] come together he dips down into this
[1:49:13] limitless soul of god
[1:49:15] that always was that wasn't created that
[1:49:18] that was before time that was the
[1:49:20] self-existing one
[1:49:22] and he dips down into his attributes
[1:49:24] into his into his soul and he said he
[1:49:26] takes a spoonful and he puts it on you
[1:49:28] gives it to you in a spoonful to me
[1:49:30] that's what happened in the upper room
[1:49:33] he said and you and you and you and you
[1:49:35] he said dividing himself the fire the
[1:49:37] cleansing power of god yes
[1:49:41] he said then if you have a spoonful and
[1:49:43] i have a spoonful and we both get
[1:49:45] together we've got two spoonfuls
[1:49:48] it's math
[1:49:50] some of you will figure it out later
[1:49:54] and if 50 of us are together we got more
[1:49:56] of us here than that this morning
[1:49:58] if 50 of us are together
[1:50:01] we got 50 spoonfuls
[1:50:04] wow
[1:50:07] where there is unity
[1:50:09] where there is gathering yes there is
[1:50:11] safety and what more
[1:50:13] it's right it's good oh god do you ever
[1:50:15] you need to feel safe today yes or
[1:50:17] there's unity where there's gathering
[1:50:19] there is safety
[1:50:21] now jesus body was broken
[1:50:23] on calvary and we typed that in the
[1:50:25] communion paul said the cup of blessing
[1:50:27] which we bless is it not the communion
[1:50:28] or the blood of christ the bread which
[1:50:30] we break is it not the communion of the
[1:50:31] body of christ the communion itself
[1:50:33] isn't the literal body but it's a type
[1:50:35] of the broken body of christ the body of
[1:50:37] christ is broken on the earth we're
[1:50:38] separated
[1:50:40] so we come together as much as we can
[1:50:43] does that make sense yeah we are not all
[1:50:46] of god
[1:50:48] there is no man
[1:50:49] who is a god to himself
[1:50:51] because the fullness of the god had
[1:50:52] dwelt bodily in jesus christ and since
[1:50:54] that day it's been divided among the
[1:50:55] entire church yes
[1:50:58] i don't have any more of god than you do
[1:50:59] right if you've received the holy ghost
[1:51:01] right
[1:51:02] so now he said did you notice he said
[1:51:05] the communion when we come together in
[1:51:06] this way there god comes down yes do you
[1:51:09] believe he's here today
[1:51:11] when we come together in this way what
[1:51:12] did he say in the scripture when two or
[1:51:14] three are gathered together in my name
[1:51:16] there am i yes
[1:51:18] there am i not i will come but there am
[1:51:20] i he said it and when we come together
[1:51:21] god comes down and the communion table
[1:51:23] is actually break broken body for the
[1:51:26] body of the lord that we separate among
[1:51:28] us he said did you notice on the day of
[1:51:30] pentecost what a great thing we have
[1:51:31] there that god who led the children of
[1:51:33] israel through the wilderness that great
[1:51:34] pillar of fire on the day of pentecost
[1:51:36] this great fire fell and divided itself
[1:51:38] among his people oh to think how he
[1:51:40] wants us
[1:51:41] to sit together in heavenly places he
[1:51:44] said then each one enjoying that warmth
[1:51:46] of the fire of the holy spirit cloven
[1:51:48] tongue set upon them like licks of fire
[1:51:50] he said god dividing himself amongst the
[1:51:52] church oh wouldn't that though just set
[1:51:54] our hearts burning that when we come
[1:51:56] together he said that's when we can come
[1:51:58] together in heavenly places
[1:52:00] he said now we know that his table where
[1:52:01] the people sit together and commune with
[1:52:03] him i love this
[1:52:05] he said it's like an oasis in a desert
[1:52:07] yes the world's a desert today yes you
[1:52:10] need an oasis in the desert yes he said
[1:52:13] it's like an oasis in a desert he said
[1:52:16] and there where there's a great spring
[1:52:18] where weary travelers come
[1:52:20] all that we could be that as a church
[1:52:22] where weary travelers come and sit
[1:52:24] around this oasis in the desert and
[1:52:27] refresh themselves
[1:52:28] and then remembering how it got there
[1:52:31] he said and that's the way it is in the
[1:52:33] church this table of communion where all
[1:52:35] the blessings of god the full gospel
[1:52:37] everything that god has for his church
[1:52:38] is brought out laid out among us it's
[1:52:40] like an oasis in this hot burning sinful
[1:52:43] desert that we're traveling through and
[1:52:45] then when we come in and talk of and
[1:52:46] read the menu
[1:52:49] don't you love to sit in a nice
[1:52:50] restaurant and sit down and look at the
[1:52:53] menu and everything's just prepared
[1:52:54] everything's proper it's beautiful and
[1:52:57] it's like i like it i love it the way
[1:52:58] they do it in africa and different
[1:53:00] places and we're in the philippines in
[1:53:01] that tropical country where you can sit
[1:53:03] out on the veranda you sit outside and
[1:53:05] the weather's so nice there by the ocean
[1:53:06] and you can sit there and and the waiter
[1:53:09] a nice waiter dressed nice will come up
[1:53:11] to you and bring you something to drink
[1:53:13] and give you a menu and you sit there
[1:53:14] reading the menu he said that's what we
[1:53:16] do when we come to church we sit here
[1:53:18] and we read the menu
[1:53:19] he said and he when he see when we see
[1:53:21] that he turns back around
[1:53:24] i love this and he's not fresh out of
[1:53:26] this yes
[1:53:27] very bad
[1:53:28] now look he here we are sitting together
[1:53:30] we're reading the menu says well the
[1:53:32] lord said i'm the god that heals all thy
[1:53:33] diseases and when we ask him say waiter
[1:53:36] preacher tell me is he still the same
[1:53:39] yes oh he's fresh out
[1:53:43] no he's not

[1:54:05] got it yes he's able to prepare it
[1:54:09] my wife and i went out to eat for our
[1:54:10] anniversary the other night we went out
[1:54:12] and went to this steakhouse up here and
[1:54:14] maybe i shouldn't mention the name of
[1:54:15] the place but they didn't do
[1:54:17] anything it wasn't their fault really
[1:54:18] just the way it is right now
[1:54:20] everything's all messed up and so we
[1:54:22] went there and they have good food and
[1:54:23] good service
[1:54:25] and i looked at the menu and i got
[1:54:27] something and my wife ordered some
[1:54:29] shorter chicken tenders and and because
[1:54:31] neither one wanted to spend much money
[1:54:33] and we've gotten past that
[1:54:35] i've been married 16 years so
[1:54:37] and so she ordered chicken tenders and i
[1:54:39] had some kind of pasta and i and and we
[1:54:41] come there and and they brought mine and
[1:54:43] they said yours will be out in a minute
[1:54:44] and she sat there for a while and sat
[1:54:46] there for a while and the lady come out
[1:54:48] embarrassed
[1:54:49] she said we don't even have chicken
[1:54:51] tenders
[1:54:56] it wasn't the best day for brittany so
[1:54:57] they gave her what i had she waited a
[1:54:58] while and got what i had and we left we
[1:55:00] went to dollar general get some ice for
[1:55:02] mom and she went in there and paid for
[1:55:04] the ice walked out there was no ice
[1:55:09] went to casey's to get ice drove down to
[1:55:12] casey's went to get ice and i looked and
[1:55:14] i saw the first thing i saw there was a
[1:55:15] sign on the ice machine
[1:55:17] i thought you got to be kidding me
[1:55:19] so i went in this time because i didn't
[1:55:21] want her to be rejected again i went in
[1:55:23] i parked right by the ice machine they
[1:55:25] said oh there's i said you want a large
[1:55:26] bag i said yes whatever you've got must
[1:55:28] be an ice shortage
[1:55:30] she said okay it's around the other side
[1:55:32] of the building
[1:55:33] so i walked all the way around the other
[1:55:34] side of the building and there was a
[1:55:35] 20-pound bag of ice i pulled it up it
[1:55:37] was stuck to the floor i pulled it up
[1:55:39] from the floor and had a hole in it
[1:55:42] so i had to carry the ice like a baby
[1:55:45] god
[1:55:47] god's not like that
[1:55:49] there's a shortage of baby food but not
[1:55:51] of the holy ghost
[1:55:52] there may be a shortage of gas but not
[1:55:54] of the fire of god
[1:55:56] there may be a shortage of doctors in
[1:55:58] medicine but there's not a shortage of
[1:55:59] healing yes sir
[1:56:01] are you hearing me today
[1:56:02] god there's still god he's the same
[1:56:04] yesterday today and forever
[1:56:07] he's not broken yes he don't have
[1:56:09] workers that aren't equipped for the job
[1:56:13] but he has said in the church god has
[1:56:15] set in the church prophets pastors
[1:56:17] evangelists teachers god did that his
[1:56:19] waiters are there they're they're not
[1:56:21] there for their own sales they're
[1:56:22] they're there to let you read the menu
[1:56:25] oh god so that you can pick the
[1:56:28] blessings of god that you need
[1:56:31] oh my
[1:56:32] listen he's not fresh out of this or
[1:56:34] fresh out of that or that struck off but

[1:56:37] forever he's got everything on the menu
[1:56:39] ready to give it out that's the good
[1:56:40] part he said then we can just look over
[1:56:42] the menu and just take the whole thing
[1:56:45] you know sometimes god just lets you go
[1:56:47] through things i had
[1:56:48] this quote i'd already finished my notes
[1:56:50] before we had that experience this week
[1:56:53] i just happened to think of it
[1:56:55] he's not fresh out
[1:56:57] well we are enjoying these blessings
[1:56:59] musicians go ahead and come i'll never
[1:57:01] quit
[1:57:03] but we're enjoying these blessings
[1:57:06] each one feeling his presence
[1:57:08] saying amen praise god hallelujah so
[1:57:11] forth he said in that we can remember
[1:57:13] the one that brought it to us
[1:57:16] i'm so thankful for the one that
[1:57:18] provided the food
[1:57:20] not just the natural food but the
[1:57:22] spiritual food that feeds my soul
[1:57:24] he made it possible he said the death of
[1:57:27] the lord jesus christ the son of god
[1:57:30] remember
[1:57:31] him
[1:57:33] we came together
[1:57:36] brenda i'm going to ask you in just a
[1:57:37] moment to come and we're going to pray
[1:57:38] for her today for her healing and maybe
[1:57:40] there'd be someone else in a moment as
[1:57:42] they play something softly and we'll
[1:57:44] have you come in just a moment but
[1:57:47] you know when they left that place in
[1:57:48] the upper room
[1:57:50] they left that place and they they said
[1:57:54] they went to the temple because just
[1:57:55] what they did they liked to go to church
[1:57:57] they left the upper room they went to
[1:57:59] the temple
[1:58:00] and as they were going there was a man
[1:58:02] lying there was lame in his feet
[1:58:05] and he was sitting there and he's crying
[1:58:06] for alms
[1:58:08] and peter looked at him being a
[1:58:09] pentecostal preacher he didn't have much
[1:58:10] money
[1:58:11] but he looked at him he said silver and
[1:58:13] gold have i none
[1:58:15] but such as i have
[1:58:17] i have something i'm a creator
[1:58:20] [Music]
[1:58:21] i have something i have something from
[1:58:23] god there's no shortage such as i have i
[1:58:26] give
[1:58:28] he said rise up and walk in the name of
[1:58:30] jesus christ
[1:58:32] said the man
[1:58:33] and what they did then is they helped
[1:58:35] him that's the role of the church
[1:58:38] see they had to help him stand
[1:58:40] we should be gathered around one another
[1:58:42] that when we see someone this week we
[1:58:43] can help them stand and they grabbed him
[1:58:45] by the hand helped him stand and then
[1:58:47] his ankle bones received strength the
[1:58:49] bible says he began to run begin to walk
[1:58:51] and begin to leave begin to praise god
[1:58:54] why there was no shortage on healing
[1:58:58] i was in africa in a prayer line i'll
[1:59:00] never forget it brother wilson robert
[1:59:01] wilson preached that night in benin
[1:59:03] africa one of the poorest countries of
[1:59:04] the world there was a lady who came that
[1:59:06] night her husband was a catholic she
[1:59:08] went to some other kind of church and
[1:59:10] her her son had been in a car accident
[1:59:13] was laying in the hospital with a broken
[1:59:15] body and they don't have any way their
[1:59:17] hospitals are just
[1:59:18] we wouldn't even go to them they call
[1:59:20] the one in togo call it the morgue they
[1:59:22] just they just don't go to the hospital
[1:59:24] if they have to because this is where
[1:59:25] you go to die
[1:59:26] your son was laying in the hospital
[1:59:28] she'd never been in that kind of a
[1:59:30] service she didn't know nothing about
[1:59:31] the message
[1:59:32] and she'd come in the prayer line and
[1:59:34] and her her son was lying there her
[1:59:36] husband was at home hadn't been able to
[1:59:38] work they were dead in a desperate
[1:59:39] condition unable to work and her husband
[1:59:42] was at home a catholic he was unable to
[1:59:44] work he had some kind of a sickness they
[1:59:46] couldn't figure it out another family
[1:59:47] member had another sickness in his body
[1:59:49] and so she come with those multiple
[1:59:51] requests and said she come up the first
[1:59:53] time and she felt the power of god
[1:59:55] moving the prayer line she goes home and
[1:59:57] gets her husband that's how long the
[1:59:58] prayer line was she goes home and gets
[2:00:00] her husband brings him back to the
[2:00:02] meeting and brings him back through now
[2:00:04] i don't even remember the couple but she
[2:00:06] sent us
[2:00:07] she actually told the pastor of a church
[2:00:10] later in benin and he emailed it to us
[2:00:12] the testimony and he said that when they
[2:00:14] went to the prayer line the man was
[2:00:15] supernaturally healed he said a god like
[2:00:18] that i'll go to a church that believes
[2:00:20] in a living god
[2:00:21] and that family sits they they found out
[2:00:23] what was wrong with the other family
[2:00:25] member the son was healed and come out
[2:00:26] of the hospital a few days later
[2:00:29] and this is the woman who knew nothing
[2:00:30] but in that atmosphere where the people
[2:00:32] had gathered together just like we are
[2:00:34] this morning they were there with one
[2:00:35] mind and one accord no distractions
[2:00:38] there weren't even any cars
[2:00:40] the parking lot there was about 50 about
[2:00:43] 50 motorcycles
[2:00:45] and a thousand people
[2:00:46] came to that meeting they either walked
[2:00:49] or they come on a motorcycle 50
[2:00:51] motorcycles brought a thousand people to
[2:00:54] a meeting to sit in the extreme heat
[2:00:56] with no air conditioning and the dark
[2:00:58] with almost no lights and to sit there
[2:01:00] and listen to the word of god preach and
[2:01:02] when they heard it preach and they come
[2:01:03] to the prayer line they just believed
[2:01:05] god but it created such an atmosphere of
[2:01:07] faith don't you see we can do that every
[2:01:09] service we don't need to let one of them
[2:01:11] fall to the ground every service now
[2:01:13] that we may not always shout and dance
[2:01:15] and run the house but every service
[2:01:16] there ought to be an atmosphere of faith
[2:01:18] in our in our church that god could move
[2:01:21] in every home there ought to be an
[2:01:22] atmosphere of faith so that when you
[2:01:24] have a need even when you're not in the
[2:01:26] church you can believe god yes lord i
[2:01:29] believe as a man said help thou my
