[0:37] i'm so grateful lord to be even standing
[0:40] here today
[0:42] lord i i don't know
[0:44] what i could have ever done
[0:46] to deserve your your attention
[0:49] lord but you chose me and you chose us
[0:52] lord as your people
[0:55] before the foundation of the world then
[0:58] you put something in us that would
[1:00] respond
[1:01] and you overwhelmed us by your love
[1:03] until
[1:05] we just had to
[1:07] say back lord i love you
[1:09] i feel that overwhelming love tonight
[1:12] lord
[1:13] may you just make it real to us
[1:15] lord and just speak to every heart
[1:18] lord as we go into this communion
[1:20] service
[1:21] communion is about the love that you had
[1:23] for us
[1:24] that you went to a cross
[1:26] lord for our sins
[1:29] so that we
[1:30] could be clean
[1:31] so that we could go live in heaven with
[1:33] you
[1:34] we thank you for that lord
[1:36] i pray that you bless each one heal
[1:38] these that are sick and those that are
[1:40] in need
[1:41] we believe that you're still jehovah
[1:43] jireh or you can provide to the
[1:45] preaching of the word and the ministry
[1:47] or to the laying on of hands through
[1:49] prayer through praise you can provide

[2:06] 13. john chapter 13 and verse
[2:11] 1.
[2:16] i want to thank our musicians tonight
[2:19] they do such a wonderful job we always
[2:21] miss all of them when they're not here
[2:23] and we've had a just a wonderful time
[2:27] uh today i have with the music and the
[2:30] worship you just all keep on worshiping
[2:33] and believing we may not be the loudest
[2:35] church in the world but i believe the
[2:36] holy spirit is here and you just respond
[2:39] to that and i'm sure that
[2:41] he'll bless you in that
[2:43] john chapter 13 and verse one we'll read
[2:45] down through verse five i want to title
[2:47] this you can't wash jesus feet
[2:50] alone i may have approached this subject
[2:52] before in a little bit different way
[2:54] but i want to
[2:55] look at these things tonight before we
[2:57] take communion
[2:59] john chapter 13 verse 1 now before the
[3:02] feast of the passover when jesus knew
[3:04] that his hour was come that he should
[3:06] depart out of this world unto the father
[3:09] having loved his own which were in the
[3:11] world he loved them unto the end
[3:14] and supper being ended the devil having
[3:16] now put into the heart
[3:18] of judas iscariot simon's son to betray
[3:21] him
[3:22] jesus knowing that the father had given
[3:25] all things into his hands
[3:27] and that he was come from god
[3:30] and went to god
[3:31] think about this verse
[3:35] he had done
[3:37] he could do anything he wanted to do
[3:41] that's
[3:42] real headship
[3:44] he could do whatever he wanted to do
[3:47] and he chose
[3:50] he came from god he went you're going
[3:51] back to god
[3:53] and he got up
[3:55] laid aside his garments
[3:57] took a towel
[3:58] and girded himself
[4:01] when he could do anything he wanted to
[4:04] because he was god
[4:05] he chose to become
[4:08] a foot wash funky
[4:10] and wash the disciples feet after that
[4:12] he poureth water into a basin and begin
[4:15] to wash
[4:16] the disciples feet
[4:18] and to wipe them with the towel
[4:20] wherewith he was girded i pray the lord
[4:23] without his blessing to the word you may
[4:24] be seated
[4:28] there are some things that we are
[4:30] required
[4:31] to do
[4:33] as a body
[4:36] you can't wash jesus feet alone what i
[4:38] mean by that is there's at least two of
[4:40] you
[4:42] you can't wash jesus feet
[4:45] alone
[4:46] and when i talk about washing jesus feet
[4:48] i mean
[4:49] the feet of your brother and sister in
[4:51] christ
[4:52] which we are the body
[4:54] of christ
[4:56] and
[4:57] there's some things that again there we
[4:59] have to do as a body
[5:02] by necessity and and the way it was made
[5:05] you can't take communion alone
[5:08] now
[5:09] i understand that if a person was all by
[5:12] themselves and had no way to get to a
[5:14] church maybe there could be an exception
[5:16] made
[5:17] but this idea that someone can get a
[5:19] revelation and then you can have
[5:21] community in your home by yourself is it
[5:23] destroys the spirit of communion
[5:26] because we don't just come together
[5:29] to drink wine and eat
[5:31] unleavened bread
[5:33] we come together
[5:36] right
[5:37] we come together you can't do it like
[5:38] they did it without coming together
[5:42] and
[5:43] covet doesn't change that
[5:46] nothing else changes that i realized we
[5:47] we were careful others were careful i
[5:49] know of churches that went
[5:51] years i know the church that just had
[5:53] communion the first time the other day
[5:54] and they were so thankful to be able to
[5:56] do that three years
[5:58] of no communion
[6:00] and had never been able to have it as a
[6:02] body that that's that's hard
[6:05] because we were meant to do this
[6:08] together
[6:11] you can't do that alone and it's
[6:13] something especially the foot washing
[6:14] part has become lost among christians
[6:16] even in brother branham's day he
[6:18] received criticism for doing it only a
[6:20] very few churches do it today because by
[6:22] its nature it's humbling to wash
[6:24] someone's feet it's meant to be
[6:29] amen especially back then when people
[6:31] walked around in sandals
[6:34] and the roads were dirt roads
[6:38] we know it was practiced in the early
[6:39] church in first timothy 5 10
[6:42] it speaks of widows that would be
[6:44] accepted in in the number in the sense
[6:46] that the church would support these
[6:48] types of widows if she of law has lodged
[6:50] strangers or is hospitable if she
[6:53] squashed the saints feet it was
[6:55] considered something that you would do
[6:57] if you were a real christian
[6:59] she would relieve the afflicted if she
[7:01] had diligently followed every good work
[7:04] but the branham when he speaks of hattie
[7:05] rights boys and you can go look it up
[7:07] but he talks about how
[7:08] that once they had come once they'd
[7:10] given their hearts to christ he noticed
[7:12] that they started washing feet with the
[7:14] men and he used that as evidence that
[7:16] they'd gotten something
[7:18] that they were saved and and so we know
[7:21] it meant something to him when the
[7:22] disciples in jesus
[7:24] came together
[7:26] there would have normally been someone
[7:28] there to wash the feet of the guest
[7:30] anytime you had a passover meal or a
[7:32] great meal like that you would have
[7:34] people there but this was a very special
[7:36] situation
[7:37] there was no foot wash flunky as brother
[7:40] random called them no no servant there
[7:42] to wash the feet because there was a
[7:44] threat on jesus life and it was a very
[7:46] secret occasion they had slipped in and
[7:49] and here it was just those that could be
[7:51] trusted
[7:52] and not really all of those could be
[7:54] trusted
[7:56] only those who could be trusted and so
[7:58] it's just a few people that gathered
[8:00] together
[8:01] for the what would become known as the
[8:03] last supper
[8:05] we know that they were all arguing about
[8:07] who was the greatest
[8:09] before dinner
[8:12] they did not get the moment at all
[8:18] sometimes we don't
[8:22] sometimes we don't
[8:24] i wonder what we'll be doing the morning
[8:25] of the rapture think about it maybe just
[8:28] a day like any other day
[8:30] right
[8:31] but here they were arguing about who was
[8:33] the greatest
[8:35] and and which one would would sit at the
[8:37] right hand in the kingdom and all had
[8:39] all these carnal thoughts about what it
[8:41] would be all of them were unconverted
[8:46] they didn't know this was the last
[8:47] supper
[8:48] but jesus knew
[8:51] and he loved them
[8:53] the bible says to the end
[8:56] and as we said this morning love is is
[8:58] condescending it's it's it's you
[9:01] becoming something less
[9:03] in order to help someone else
[9:06] and so jesus loving them he he stepped
[9:09] down he come from the father he was
[9:11] going back to the father but he stepped
[9:13] out of his role as god as deity and
[9:16] stepped down to spend time with the
[9:19] disciples and to wash their feet i want
[9:22] you to notice they never washed his feet
[9:26] and i wonder sometimes if that wouldn't
[9:28] have been a
[9:29] a little bit of a hardship afterwards if
[9:31] you think about it if the disciples
[9:33] realized the opportunity that they had
[9:35] missed brother danny to have washed
[9:38] jesus feet
[9:41] here they were sitting there at the
[9:43] table arguing about who was going to
[9:44] betray jesus who was going to be this
[9:46] who was going to be the greatest in the
[9:48] kingdom all these things all the
[9:49] doctrines and things that they had
[9:51] argued about that they thought was
[9:52] important and they could have actually
[9:54] stepped out and washed jesus feet
[10:00] and they didn't
[10:02] we have no record
[10:03] in the scripture
[10:05] of any disciple ever washing jesus feet
[10:09] we have no record in the scripture
[10:12] of a pharisee ever washing jesus feet
[10:16] there was a prostitute one time
[10:22] she didn't recognize the importance of
[10:24] the occasion either but she knew there
[10:26] was a need
[10:29] so his feet had already been washed the
[10:32] disciples were too busy the pharisees
[10:34] were too busy but and they would regret
[10:36] that i'm sure
[10:38] later on
[10:39] many of them would but here they she was
[10:42] not too busy she she obeyed the command
[10:44] and went in to do a service for god
[10:47] because she saw that his feet weren't
[10:48] washed and it wasn't right for him to
[10:50] remain like that
[10:52] and brother branham took that to worship
[10:54] he said it's not right for him to remain
[10:56] in the church
[10:58] without his feet wash i don't care you
[11:00] call it emotionalism you call it
[11:02] sensation whatever you want to call it
[11:03] you can call me whatever you want to
[11:04] call me but it's not right
[11:07] for christ to be in the church and there
[11:09] no be no tears there'd be no shouts
[11:11] there'd be no amens there'd be no no
[11:14] movement it's not right for it not to be
[11:16] heartfelt
[11:20] are you with me tonight
[11:22] amen
[11:24] i want us to look around the room
[11:28] not this room that room
[11:32] look around
[11:34] see who's there
[11:36] it's maybe a little different tonight
[11:37] but you just bear with me peter was in
[11:39] the room
[11:42] peter was born in the village besetta
[11:45] at some point he and andrew moved to
[11:47] capernaum where they ran a business
[11:48] together it was originally named simon
[11:51] when jesus met him he called him
[11:53] peter
[11:55] it's funny after that whenever jesus
[11:56] rebuked him he called him simon
[12:00] go look it up
[12:02] every time jesus rebuked peter he called
[12:04] him simon simon what am i going to do
[12:07] with you
[12:09] sometimes we're simon
[12:12] sometimes we're peter
[12:16] he's the leader of the group he's in
[12:17] jesus inner circle he gets the most
[12:20] praise he also gets the hardest
[12:21] criticism
[12:23] he's brash outspoken promises things he
[12:25] can't deliver and is constantly in the
[12:27] middle of things
[12:29] he denies jesus three times and
[12:31] immediately repents
[12:33] he's ignorant and unlearned in fact in
[12:35] the book of acts they they call him that
[12:37] ignorant unlearned that literally means
[12:39] an illiterate ignoramus
[12:44] after pentecost he's a great preacher
[12:46] has a great public ministry even his
[12:48] shadow healed people but he was still
[12:50] prone to being swayed by public opinion
[12:52] because paul had to withstand him to the
[12:54] face
[12:56] but he didn't think
[12:58] to wash jesus feet
[13:03] andrew his brother was one of the first
[13:05] to follow jesus he was john's disciple i
[13:07] i like andrew he was always in the
[13:09] shadow of peter his more famous brother
[13:11] but without him
[13:13] peter would have never been saved
[13:16] i i this is kind of personal but i hope
[13:18] my brother my son my my children
[13:22] outshine me in some way go farther than
[13:24] i've gone don't have to have the scars
[13:26] that i have
[13:28] don't have to go through what i've been
[13:29] through
[13:30] i've been through some things and i hope
[13:32] that they go way farther than i went way
[13:35] much more anointed much more able to
[13:38] speak and things
[13:39] but i'll always
[13:41] i'll always have a part
[13:43] andrew always had a part
[13:46] because he was the one who introduced
[13:49] peter to jesus he was always introducing
[13:52] people to jesus
[13:53] we all had to be that way shouldn't we
[13:55] andrew was a personal worker he never
[13:57] preached a great campaign but he brought
[13:59] the greeks to jesus he brought the boy
[14:01] with the fish to jesus
[14:03] remember he's the one you know they're
[14:05] all talking so what are we going to do
[14:06] and here's a little boy that's got two
[14:08] loaves and five fishes and they're
[14:10] they're all wondering how we gonna
[14:12] fulfill the commands of jesus it's
[14:13] impossible for us to do and andrew said
[14:15] well i don't know how to do the math but
[14:17] i'll tell you this if we get this boy in
[14:18] the presence of jesus
[14:22] the mouth will change
[14:26] i wonder if we could ever think like
[14:28] that
[14:29] if we could get
[14:30] our children if we could get our young
[14:32] people if we could get our family or
[14:34] relatives in the presence of christ
[14:36] things would change
[14:40] there was james
[14:42] he and his brother john were called this
[14:44] were the sons of zebedee called the sons
[14:47] of thunder they ran a fishing business
[14:49] with their father they were more
[14:50] well-off than peter and andrew from a
[14:52] more prestigious family of levites the
[14:55] bible tells us
[14:57] and jesus is the one who called him a
[14:59] son of thunder
[15:00] when the samaritans didn't receive jesus
[15:02] they wanted to call down fire out of
[15:04] heaven and destroy them all
[15:06] jesus said you don't know what spirits
[15:07] you've got
[15:10] he should have been the most preeminent
[15:11] of the disciples but
[15:13] he and john tried to get their mother to
[15:15] set them up with thrones on either side
[15:16] of jesus i tell you what there was a lot
[15:18] of carnality going on
[15:21] i think it's bad in the church today go
[15:23] back right before pentecost the holy
[15:25] ghost took care of a lot of that
[15:28] amen
[15:30] but they were they were trying to get
[15:31] thrones on either side of jesus but he
[15:33] was always in the shadow of his brother
[15:35] john john
[15:36] was a great man in the scripture
[15:39] of all the disciples he was the most
[15:40] hot-headed impatient fervent saw things
[15:43] in black and white you can see that in
[15:45] his letters
[15:46] you don't have a gray area he's a bit of
[15:48] a legalist
[15:49] but he becomes the apostle of love
[15:51] well it's amazing how life can change
[15:53] people
[15:55] we read this morning that came from john
[15:57] john was the hot head
[15:59] same guy that wanted to call fire down
[16:01] out of heaven brother jt at the end of
[16:02] his life he just got up in the pulpit
[16:05] and all he could say is little children
[16:07] love one another
[16:09] same guy
[16:13] he has the most lasting impact probably
[16:15] of all the disciples because he wrote
[16:17] the book of revelation
[16:21] he suffered for the kingdom jesus told
[16:23] him are you able to drink of the cup
[16:24] that i drink of he calls himself the
[16:26] disciple that jesus loved he later wrote
[16:29] the book of revelation
[16:30] but in the upper room with jesus at that
[16:33] time he's still young a hothead a son of
[16:36] thunder he didn't think
[16:38] to wash jesus feet
[16:42] thought never crossed his mind they
[16:43] would never take that job
[16:46] philip
[16:47] was the hair philip from bessetta also
[16:50] where they were from most of these
[16:52] disciples were from the same area
[16:54] in fact everybody but judas was galilean
[16:58] judas was the higher class he was from
[17:00] judah
[17:03] philip is a campaign manager of sorts
[17:05] for jesus he's a
[17:07] in charge of logistics in the meetings
[17:10] he's the one who who figures out the
[17:12] math and says there's not enough bread
[17:14] to feed the people till andrew got the
[17:16] little kid to jesus
[17:18] he has trouble understanding the godhead
[17:21] and some people have trouble
[17:22] understanding the godhead today it's
[17:24] lack of the holy ghost i think
[17:26] in some cases
[17:29] because philip before he got the holy
[17:30] ghost he said lord show us the father
[17:32] and jesus said have i been so long time
[17:34] with you and you've not known me
[17:40] that was philip that he didn't think to
[17:42] wash jesus feet there was nathaniel
[17:43] called bartholomew nathanael was found
[17:45] by philip he's from cana of galilee he
[17:48] was an expectation of the messiah
[17:50] because of the scriptures he was a good
[17:51] man
[17:52] jesus called him a man in whom is no
[17:54] guile that's a good man
[17:56] he recognizes the sign of the son of man
[17:58] immediately
[18:00] and and he's brought to christ
[18:02] thomas was there we know thomas is a
[18:04] doubter but he was still a disciple
[18:08] i think thomas's problem wasn't so much
[18:10] doubt as pessimism
[18:12] well this is different tonight isn't it
[18:16] yeah i think his problem was pessimistic
[18:17] if you ever look at where he said in in
[18:20] in john
[18:21] uh 11 6
[18:23] in john 11 6 i didn't give them the
[18:25] scriptures or anything tonight it's kind
[18:27] of off the cuff and you just
[18:30] just try to follow me but
[18:31] thomas which is called didymus that
[18:34] means twin
[18:35] he said to his fellow disciples because
[18:36] they didn't understand what jesus was
[18:38] talking about
[18:39] and so
[18:41] this is uh
[18:42] john 11 16 i'm sorry john 11 16 and and
[18:46] he
[18:47] jesus is talking about going and dying
[18:49] it's it's actually a pretty uh pretty
[18:52] somber message at the time jesus is
[18:54] trying to get him to understand i'm
[18:55] going to go die
[18:57] i i'm going to give my life
[19:00] and thomas is a little bit of a
[19:01] pessimist he said let's go also
[19:04] let us also go then we may die with him
[19:09] he says we might as well
[19:11] we're all going to die i know some
[19:13] people like that
[19:16] john 14 and 5 thomas tells jesus lord we
[19:19] don't know where you go how can we know
[19:20] the way he does have a problem with
[19:22] doubt
[19:23] in john 20 and 25
[19:26] he here jesus has appeared to the
[19:28] disciples and the other disciples said
[19:29] to him we have seen the lord and he just
[19:32] happened to miss that sunday service
[19:35] but he said i i won't believe it unless
[19:37] i see the in his hands the print of the
[19:39] nails put my finger into the print of
[19:41] the nails thrust my hand into his side
[19:44] but jesus could have said well i don't
[19:46] want him but jesus knew he would doubt
[19:50] and so he appeared that morning too
[19:52] aren't you glad he shows up what's he
[19:54] doing showing his love in his many
[19:56] places
[19:58] amen
[19:59] he chose it over and over again and when
[20:01] thomas doubted the first son he didn't
[20:03] show up and doubted that the good
[20:05] service actually happened here here he
[20:07] come the next service
[20:09] he showed up again aren't you glad he
[20:11] shows up again
[20:12] he showed up again and
[20:14] and and and he still doubted him but
[20:16] when he showed up he said lord i believe
[20:18] and jesus said is better for those who
[20:20] have not seen and yet believed to be one
[20:22] of those but he was still jesus disciple
[20:25] but he didn't think to wash jesus feet
[20:29] matthew the publican is there also known
[20:31] as levi he writes the gospel of matthew
[20:34] and in the gospel of matthew he does an
[20:35] admirable thing he keeps himself almost
[20:38] completely out of the picture i'll be
[20:40] honest with you if i had written the
[20:41] gospel of matthew matthew would have
[20:42] been all in it
[20:45] i kind of like the way john did it
[20:47] because
[20:48] john kind of did it underhanded he calls
[20:50] himself the disciple jesus loved and
[20:52] kind of puts that in there
[20:54] you know on occasion these were human
[20:57] beings
[21:00] and matthew he he doesn't hardly mention
[21:02] matthew at all he probably had a pretty
[21:04] low opinion of himself because he was a
[21:05] publican that's basically the mafia in
[21:08] that day
[21:10] they were traitors
[21:11] they were on the same social level as
[21:13] harlots
[21:14] he would have been forbidden entrance to
[21:16] the synagogue he probably had never been
[21:18] to the church
[21:19] when jesus called him
[21:23] and so
[21:24] he was called
[21:26] but he made jesus a great meal in his
[21:28] own house and that's when jesus got in
[21:30] trouble for sitting with publicans
[21:33] there was james the son of alpheus or
[21:36] james the less i don't know about you
[21:38] but i'd have a problem being called
[21:39] james the less
[21:42] and the reason why he was called james
[21:44] the less is because he was not james the
[21:45] brother of jesus
[21:47] and james the brother of jesus was so
[21:49] well respected in that time so they
[21:51] called him james the less
[21:54] i hope it was because he was smaller and
[21:56] not because they thought of him less
[21:58] we don't really know anything about him
[22:00] but you know there's got to be a place
[22:01] for james the less
[22:04] huh
[22:05] he's just one of the 12. we don't even
[22:07] know what he did
[22:09] but he's there
[22:11] he was needed
[22:13] sure
[22:14] right
[22:15] james the less was needed
[22:17] you're needed
[22:18] we need each and every one of you god
[22:20] needs each and every one of you you may
[22:22] think of yourself as little these little
[22:24] ones sitting on the front row taking
[22:25] notes they may think of themselves as
[22:27] little but god knows each and every one
[22:29] of them he knows you're here and he
[22:31] knows why you're here today
[22:34] we don't know about james the less but
[22:36] james celeste was one of the disciples
[22:38] he didn't wash jesus feet you'd have
[22:40] thought he could have stooped down being
[22:41] james the less
[22:44] but jesus washed his feet
[22:47] it was jude also known as levi estadius
[22:50] or judas
[22:51] his name meant tenderhearted sweet
[22:54] he's the one that said lord how is it
[22:56] that that won't manifest thyself unto us
[22:58] not into the world and jesus said if a
[23:00] man loved me he would keep my words my
[23:02] father will love him we will come to him
[23:04] and make our abode with him i'm trying
[23:06] to hurry through this tonight so we can
[23:07] get to our communion there was simon the
[23:09] zealot he was a member of an outlaw
[23:11] political sect named the zealots
[23:13] he was basically a terrorist
[23:16] god can call just about anybody to be a
[23:18] preacher can he
[23:20] he would have carried a curved knife
[23:22] that's why they call him that that's
[23:23] what that means simon the zealot he
[23:25] would have carried a curved knife and
[23:27] they carried that and just in case they
[23:29] come across a collaborator with the
[23:31] romans they'd knife him in the back
[23:35] he was sworn to kill people like matthew
[23:41] early church was interesting man
[23:45] he spent his whole life you imagine him
[23:47] calling two disciples like that here's
[23:49] one who's a tax collector here's another
[23:51] one sworn to kill tax collectors
[23:54] he calls them both
[23:57] they're sitting at the last supper
[24:00] sitting next to each other probably
[24:05] look
[24:06] judas is scary it was there
[24:09] probably the best one of the bunch
[24:13] the one that looked the best a man's man
[24:17] one that they trusted to take care of
[24:19] the finances
[24:22] the first trustee
[24:25] think about it
[24:26] i'm glad we've got good trustees who
[24:28] aren't judases but
[24:30] even his name goes down in history as a
[24:32] betrayal of christ
[24:36] he's there jesus washes
[24:39] his
[24:40] feet
[24:42] because it's after that that he
[24:44] leaves i want to ask you something if
[24:47] you had to wash judah's feet and you
[24:49] knew who he was
[24:51] would you be able to do it that shows me
[24:52] that jesus was god
[24:59] he got down
[25:00] and judas was there and he got down
[25:02] right in front of judas and knew in a
[25:04] few hours
[25:06] he'd give him the kiss of death
[25:08] turn him over to the authorities and he
[25:10] washed his feet just like the rest of
[25:12] them and didn't think didn't let any of
[25:16] them know and when he said one of you
[25:17] will betray me they had no idea who it
[25:20] was
[25:24] no clue because he treated one just as
[25:26] good as another
[25:28] oh god give me a heart like that
[25:32] lord let me have that spirit lord
[25:34] that no matter who i washed feet with
[25:36] back there i've never washed feet with
[25:38] judas iscariot but let me have the same
[25:40] attitude toward every one of them you
[25:42] understand
[25:45] you say well you know if preachers were
[25:48] perfect today we we would get along and
[25:50] and we would come and we would do things
[25:52] right these preachers weren't perfect
[25:56] and this was the best of the best
[25:59] this is the best that god could find and
[26:01] it was a bunch of of renegades
[26:04] they were unlearned and illiterate most
[26:06] of them
[26:08] flying off the handle
[26:11] denying christ
[26:14] messed up but god called him out of that
[26:18] amen
[26:20] amen if you're looking for a perfect
[26:21] church that wasn't it
[26:23] but it's the ones that jesus called
[26:25] that's right
[26:28] i want you to look around the room think
[26:32] peter
[26:33] watched his wife be killed in front of
[26:35] him
[26:37] and then was crucified upside down at
[26:39] his request because he didn't want to be
[26:41] that bold brash man
[26:43] didn't want to be crucified like jesus
[26:47] andrew died on a cross on the mission
[26:49] field they hung him with a rope instead
[26:51] of nails to prolong the pain
[26:53] and for two days he hung by the side of
[26:55] the road
[26:56] still introducing people to jesus
[27:03] james is martyred by herod agrippa who's
[27:06] been destroyed by god he's the first
[27:08] apostle to give his life
[27:12] philip is crucified
[27:14] because of the conversion
[27:17] of the wife of a roman official
[27:20] nathanael was a missionary to india and
[27:22] was either beheaded or crucified on the
[27:24] mission field
[27:26] thomas was martyred in northern india
[27:28] matthew was probably burned at the stake
[27:30] in ethiopia
[27:32] james celeste was also martyred and of
[27:34] course because he was james celeste we
[27:36] don't know how
[27:41] somebody's got to fulfill that role
[27:44] all right
[27:45] libya thaddeus is martyred with an axe
[27:47] in syria
[27:49] simon the zealot was murdered with a
[27:51] saul for preaching the gospel
[27:54] john is the only one who lives
[27:56] as an old man he's carried to the pulpit
[27:58] at ephesus because they tried to boil
[28:00] him in oil and couldn't get he couldn't
[28:01] kill him
[28:03] and after he gets finally gets off the
[28:04] isle of patmos he comes back and he
[28:06] simply says little children love one
[28:08] another
[28:10] amen
[28:13] none of them
[28:14] these ended up being the greatest men of
[28:16] the christian faith the apostles that
[28:17] the foundation would be built on are you
[28:19] still with me tonight we're about to
[28:21] turn over to communion service
[28:22] the foundation was built on the apostles
[28:24] and prophets everything we believe was
[28:26] built on what they taught
[28:31] and yet none of them
[28:33] washed jesus feet they all missed that
[28:37] opportunity
[28:40] oh i don't want to miss that opportunity
[28:42] tonight
[28:44] when i get down i get down on my knees
[28:46] and i get down to to wash your feet
[28:48] whoever i might wash your feet i want to
[28:51] look at that and say this is the feet of
[28:53] jesus
[28:54] they passed up the opportunity but there
[28:56] come a time when they wash one another's
[28:58] feet
[29:00] because he said you'll be happy
[29:02] if you'll do this
[29:05] none but an ill-famed woman
[29:08] wash his feet
[29:10] what a what a testament to the character
[29:12] of christ
[29:14] but jesus look around the room jesus
[29:16] washed all
[29:18] their feet
[29:20] even judas
[29:22] he submitted himself to be the slave
[29:25] because that was the job a slave would
[29:26] do the lowest order of slave
[29:29] he submitted himself to be the slave
[29:32] of sinful men listen to this quote as
[29:33] the musicians come you're ready for
[29:35] communion service
[29:39] brother brown said be like david
[29:41] i'd rather be a doormat at the house of
[29:43] my god oh i'd go if they'd let me do
[29:45] something oh church
[29:47] be like david
[29:49] i'd rather be a doormat than to dwell in
[29:51] the tents with the wicked
[29:53] jesus put himself even lower than james
[29:55] the less and even lower
[29:57] than judas that's right
[29:59] wherever you call me lord let me be the
[30:02] best doormat you ever had
[30:04] if the people have to wipe their feet on
[30:06] me let me be a real doormat i'll clean
[30:09] feet
[30:10] if nothing else
[30:12] that's what jesus did listen how brother
[30:14] brandon puts this when he come to the
[30:16] earth he become god's doormat
[30:20] oh my
[30:22] so the disciples would have a place
[30:26] to wipe their feet
[30:28] he became god's doormat his own son who
[30:32] are you bishop state presbyter when
[30:35] jesus become a foot washed funky a
[30:38] doormat at the house of the lord
[30:40] oh just the thought of it church i can't
[30:42] hardly preach it just at the thought of
[30:44] it
[30:46] they didn't even recognize what time it
[30:48] was or what was happening what he was
[30:50] doing
[30:51] but we recognize it today
[30:54] oh god help us to recognize it
[30:57] that's what jesus did when he come to
[30:58] the earth he become god's dormant his
[31:00] own son who are you bishops state
[31:02] presbyter when jesus become a foot wash
[31:04] funky a doormat at the house of the lord
[31:07] and then we think we're somebody because
[31:09] we got a doctor's degree we went through
[31:11] college look at your example what he did
[31:15] amen don't look to what the bishop did
[31:17] before you the presbyter before you
[31:19] whatever like that he might have been a
[31:21] good man that doesn't matter look at god
[31:25] what did he become
[31:27] the doorman
[31:30] so that we could be elevated
[31:32] to have our feet washed by god
[31:35] because you're not just washing deity's
[31:37] feet
[31:39] amen you are deity's feet
[31:41] being washed
[31:44] would you bow your heads with me
[31:47] thank you for bearing with me today
[31:50] i didn't intend to preach this service
[31:52] whether
[31:53] john bailey was going to come over and
[31:55] due to the circumstances with his sister
[31:57] and being in surgery
[31:59] it wasn't a good time but
[32:01] maybe he'll come some other time but i
[32:03] believe god ordained this service to be
[32:04] what it is
[32:07] don't look at the bishop
[32:09] don't look some great man
[32:12] look at jesus
[32:14] the author and finisher
[32:16] of our faith
[32:19] ultimately it's all about
[32:21] him
[32:22] and no one else
[32:25] when it becomes about me he'll take me
[32:27] out of the way
[32:29] if it becomes about you the same thing
[32:31] will happen
[32:33] it's not about even a prophet
[32:36] because the prophet being the messenger
[32:38] carried us
[32:39] took us his message carried us to christ
[32:42] but when we saw isaac
[32:44] amen then our heart fell in love
[32:48] he showed us the word he introduced us
[32:50] to the word
[32:52] it's not about the brown said i wasn't
[32:53] the one standing at the river i was the
[32:55] only one standing near
[32:58] amen
[32:59] i'm so glad we had a prophet like that
[33:01] i'm so glad
[33:02] we had a god like that that
[33:05] got down on his knees
[33:10] and i've watched some of you do that and
[33:13] when you don't feel like it you're in
[33:14] pain sometimes yeah you wash jesus feet
[33:17] he sees that
[33:19] he knows
[33:22] you come to an afternoon service you
[33:24] think well it's just going to be a long
[33:25] day but he sees that you're here
[33:29] maybe
[33:30] you have a special need tonight and
[33:33] you're just something on your heart that
[33:36] you just need
[33:37] the holy spirit to fix
[33:39] before we go to the communion service
[33:41] while this presence is here would you
[33:42] just reach out to him say lord
[33:44] lord i have need of you today come by
[33:47] [Music]
[33:48] if you were willing to wash the
[33:49] disciples feet you're able lord to come
[33:53] by and me my need today
[33:56] you can come by and speak to me
[34:01] i know i'm not perfect but you wash the
[34:04] feet of imperfect disciples

[34:08] sense to wash yours

[34:13] lord you see the hands that are raised
[34:16] lord i feel your presence here tonight
[34:19] lord i'm just
[34:21] just broken up at the thought
[34:24] how
[34:25] that you lord would get your feet washed
[34:29] by a little woman a harlot
[34:33] but not by your own disciples
[34:36] but you washed their feet
[34:39] i'm so grateful for it today
[34:42] i'm so thankful there's nothing that i
[34:44] could bring lord nothing these people
[34:45] could bring what would we give in
[34:48] exchange for what we've been given
[34:51] but lord will take the cup as david said
[34:54] we'll take the cup
[34:56] we'll drink the communion wine and the
[34:57] bread break the bread
[35:00] we'll wash one another's feet that's the
[35:02] least we could do
[35:04] lord i pray for each and every one every
[35:07] individual need
[35:08] lord i pray for mothers with families
[35:11] lord struggling maybe they don't really
[35:13] know how i'm gonna raise my kids in an
[35:16] ungodly world

[35:57] rejoicing in the hearts of every man
[35:59] woman boy and girl lord may we lift our
[36:02] voices to you in our hearts
[36:04] and knowing you brought us out of the
[36:05] deep mighty clay
[36:07] and brought us according to your word
[36:10] to the table
[36:12] together
[36:14] we can't do that by ourselves
[36:16] we must have these other these others
[36:19] lord they may be like those disciples
[36:20] they may
[36:21] have made mistakes
[36:24] many of them not fit hardly to be in
[36:26] polite company but lord you made them
[36:28] all equal
[36:29] by washing all of their feet
