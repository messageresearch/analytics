an option for every eagle is to mount up and fly why stay on the ground when you can fly amen it's good to have each and every one of you in the service tonight i i know you made a special effort to come in here brother andrew and and you know it's not how many of us there are but it's how prepared we are to receive from the gift of god because it is a gift to you the gift is not for itself the gift is for you and brother andrew was in the area turkey hunting so i kind of impressed him into service and and but the gift is for you and if there's a gift there then there's something in you to respond to that whatever you have need of god can speak to you on a wednesday night but david no matter what how did how bad that need is god can speak to you and maybe you made an effort to come to church on a wednesday night and you're tired and a bit weary but that's the time when god speaks to you the most and he says i love you and i want to i want to provide for you i want to help you i want to correct you whatever that it is and we say yes lord but you've got to pull on the gift you're going to say amen to the word tonight amen amen god bless you tonight as brother andrew would prepare to come i want you to continue to remember in your prayers at home uh brother brown brother harold brown is still in the hospital with covid someone spoke to him today and said he was able to talk on the phone but he's not doing well and of course he's advanced in years and so let's keep him in our prayers our brother george smith has had coven he's recovering he's also been sick and there's several churches dealing with that again it seems like that old devil won't let go but we have a god that's greater than that devil do you believe that today we've seen him do it we're not just talking about a god that we don't know there's a place in the scripture where it said that he said that the the children of israel don't know me don't know me by my name yet they don't know me by the reality of they knew who he was but they didn't know him by the reality of the promise fulfilled they they knew him by the promise but not the fulfilled promise we know him by the fulfilled promise tonight amen amen aren't you glad to be in church on a wednesday night amen amen let's sing that little song i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you we know that as brother andrew would come tonight and just give your full attention to the word and if we're here at midnight we'll know the lord moved amen god bless you tonight church seeing this is brother andrew comes [Music] and i lift my voice to worship you oh my soul [Music] here [Music] sing it now with all your heart [Music] hallelujah [Music] you oh my soul [Music] hear may it be a sweet [Music] sweet sound in your amen is that your desire this evening amen to give forth the sound of praise the sound of honor amen the sound of worship to the king of kings and the lord of lords amen amen i believe if anybody deserves our worship if anybody deserves our praise it's him this evening don't you amen god bless you this evening it's good to see everyone out in the house of god that can be here tonight and while you're standing with us we'll invite you to the book of romans the fifth chapter we want to just go straight in the word tonight i i want to be mindful that it's a midweek service this evening but i i believe it's a an honor to be in the house of god amen i think it was brother homer longoria i heard say one time he was preaching he said you know people that love the church are there on sunday morning he said then people that love the pastors are on sunday night he said but then the ones that love the lords they're on wednesday amen and i know there's different circumstances where people can't maybe be here distance and things but isn't it good to be in the house of god in the middle of a week amen just to hear his word and to honor him and amen not just a sunday morning christian but every day of the week christian amen he deserves our all just before we read tonight let's just borrow hearts together for a word of prayer and ask the lord to come heavenly father lord as your believers have gathered themselves together here this evening lord we're so thankful that you have sent this message to us in this hour lord father in this generation lord where the world is in such confusion lord said as your prophet said lawlessness and moral decay lord riotings and killings and burnings and lord such destruction father lord we know that we're living in the day and time where your prophet's words are being fulfilled that lord before destruction can come the people must get in the spirit of destruction at the same time before lord revival can come or deliverance or rapture the people must get in the spirit of rapture lord i believe here tonight as a group of people that is not lord looking to get in the spirit of destruction but lord we're looking to move into the spirit of the almighty god lord i believe that you're here tonight i believe your presence is in the building now fathers the songs of zion have been sung lord i pray that you would now come lord into the atmosphere that your believers have created lord may you drive back the worries and the cares of life the situations dear lord father all the things that would be up on the minds of your children i pray tonight god for just a few moments of time may you push those things back lord may we may we shut into your presence lord may we hear from you tonight god or do you see those that are sick and suffering in their bodies i pray lord you would sid healing those that are bound i pray you would send deliverance father lord may your mercy and grace just be lord extended to this congregation lord forgive us of our failures and our shortcomings lord draw us closer to yourself father and when this meeting would be dismissed this evening may we be able to say did not our hearts burn within us not as brother andrew talked to us along the way but as the same resurrected lord came and opened the scriptures and spoke to her heart and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and our savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers said amen and amen the book of romans the fifth chapter and the first verse the bible here paul writing says now therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of god we were sometimes were afar off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father amen through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father then paul comes in the in ephesians the third chapter in the 11th verse and he's speaking here on the purpose of god in the 11th verse he says according to the eternal purpose which he hath purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness now notice what he joins now with access he now have boldness and access with confidence by faith by the faith of him wherefore i desire that you thank not at my tribulations for you which is your glory we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here for a few moments we want to say it's an honor to be here and appreciate brother ben for allowing us to speak to you tonight and amen we want to by the help of the lord just to speak to you here on a fault if i tell this tonight i want to talk to you for a few moments on access granted by the spirit access amen granted by the spirit the prophet of god will actually uh pray here in a message how the angel came to me in 1953 he says now we bow our heads just a moment for prayer he said our heavenly father we come tonight to worship thee and we're thankful for the opportunity that we have of coming he said and through this channel of holy spirit which has been bought by the blood of jesus christ he says that we have access to the throne of grace amen through the name of jesus we have we have access to the throne of grace amen through the name of jesus and we are so happy about it think about that tonight that a prophet of god is not putting this in the future amen that someday we're going to have access but he's actually saying we now have access amen to the throne of grace through the name of jesus and we're happy about it tonight now we live in a day and time where people are always trying amen to find access trying to get into something looking for something as a matter of fact you'll find that they're not just looking for any kind of access but they begin to look for the easiest way of access you know and i think of how that the day and time we live in things have been made easier amen to access today than any other day you think about you you go to the grocery store you go to a maybe go to a flea market and you want to buy something and years ago he had to go home and find a magazine and flip through the magazine and find the price 20 years ago and then then come back try to talk the guy down amen but now you carry a cell phone in your pocket that you just pull out in a matter of time and then you can access the price of that all over the world so we're living in a day and time amen where things have been made easier to access we've often heard it said amen that our young people have access to more sin and ungodliness than any generation before amen and i'll say that that is true amen 20 years ago amen if they wanted to access something of the world they had to go to a bookstore go to a movie hall amen but now carry it in their pockets and in their laptops amen it's a day when things have been made easier to access and i'll say it like this amen the advancement of technology has made it easier to access these things now amen i'll just say i'm not a negative person amen i don't like to leave everything on the negative side but i'd like to bring it to the positive side amen to say that if they have more access to the negative to the ungodliness to this and to the unrighteousness then let me say we have more access to more word amen in this generation that has ever been given before we're we're not here accessing a partial word we're not here talking amen about a partial opening of the word but we have been given access in this generation amen not to the partial word amen but to the full word think about that tonight in the house of god amen we're not reading from a closed book and then we're not lead we're not hearing from amen from a deaf god amen but we're talking to a living god amen that's got a living voice and behind that voice is an authority my amen to think tonight that we are his believing children amen and he has given his believing children the promise of access now how many will agree that the message is full of promises amen the message of the hour is full of promises it's full of healing full of deliverance full of miracles full of redemption that the the message of the hour is a message full of promises amen but i want to focus tonight on this promise the promise of access now you say what is the promise of access i'll say it this way the promise of access is all things that is in christ amen are yours and you have access to them isn't that easy amen all things that are in christ are yours amen and you have access to them and then sometimes i think we fail to realize what the message has provided to the church amen the prophet said the trouble with it today is they don't realize what is provided for them many people don't realize amen that the great glories and the powers that's been provided for them he said coming into jesus christ is like walking into an arcade down here amen are a great department store if somebody give me a great department store they said this is all yours amen this is all yours well the first thing i do amen is i'd walk around in there and find out what i owned amen what was mine and the way it is in christ when you become a christian he said walk around and find out what is yours amen and you own it all things are yours they've been given to you freely everything that christ died for is yours every one of them you've got a checkbook with jesus name signed amen across there and saying whatever you send this check to the father whatever you ask the father in my name that i'll do he said you're just scared to fill it out that's all amen but to think tonight church that the promises of god amen don't have to be something that we dream about amen they don't have to be something that we wish about or we hope about and then let me say this church is not a wishing well amen amen this is not somewhere we gather three times a week came in to throw a coin in the well amen and hope god will do something for the church amen but we are living in the hour where god himself amen has opened up the windows of heaven amen and is pouring out a blessing upon this generation amen if you're sick tonight amen you don't have to leave here sick amen if you're bound tonight you don't have to leave here amen if you're down you don't have to leave here now listen this is the beautiful thing about this message is you don't have to leave church the way you came and then you don't have to leave at the same to condemnation you don't have to leave with the same old spirit amen we have been given access by the power of almighty god let me say this the access to the things of christ amen does not come by education it does not come by intellectualism it does not come by feelings or human abilities amen or emotions it comes by the spirit amen it comes by the spirit now you say what spirit amen well there is only one spirit amen whereby we have access and that is the holy spirit and then for paul said there is one body there is one spirit even as you are called amen into one hope of your calling the prophet will say it like this let the spirit that may say the spirit amen let the spirit that dominated his body and his mind and controlled him and then come into us tonight and interpret the word and preach the word and give it to our hungry hearts amen as we wait on him now think about this tonight the spirit of god amen is superior to all other spirits amen there's a lot of spirits in the land today there's a spirit of intellectualism there's a spirit of formalism there's a spirit of just coming to church and being a casual christian amen just showing up and amen saying i'm here amen but the spirit of god tonight is superior to every one of those spirits amen there is no spirit that will stop the spirit of god amen the spirit of god will tear down walls he meant to gain access to his children amen if there was a hungry heart in here tonight amen desiring something from the word and there would be a thousand demons of unbelief that would surround this building amen if there was a pull in that heart amen god would push back every demon out of hell he would drive back every spirit of unbelief and he would come right down to your pew and would minister to you in the power and the fullness of this work listen church we're not a bunch of underprivileged children here tonight we are the sons and daughters of el salvador amen we are the sons and daughters of god who has been given a promise amen we don't have to sit on the outside and wish we could have revival amen we can have it tonight we ain't got to sit outside and wish somebody could get the holy ghost we can preach the holy ghost here tonight until the same holy ghost that filled the upper room and then would come in this building and would begin to fill vessels amen not with a bunch of mechanics and then but the same dynamics amen that filled the upper room can fill this church here tonight are you hearing me we're not a church amen looking for god to do something we're living in a day and time where god has done something and the spirit of god is not bound to these cold spirits amen the spirit of god is not bowed amen to these lukewarm devils the spirit of god will gain access amen to his children amen i was reading not long ago the prophet of god talking about saint patrick in the fatigue church age he said in one of his missionary journeys a minute as he approached the walled city he found the gates was barred against him he said he lifted his voice in prayer amen that god might intervene and allow him access amen to the people in order to preach think about this but as he prayed and then the court magicians began to harass him amen with loud noise but he began to sing a psalm and as he's saying amen god so increased the volume of his voice that he drowned out the cries of the heathen and suddenly somebody say suddenly and then suddenly the gates burst open on their own accord and he entered in and preached the gospel he meant winning many to the lord and then there was some seed in there and then there was some hungry hearts in there and there was some spirits around brother dave amen that was saying amen saint patrick you ain't coming in here amen but let the voices of the enemy say what they want to amen but what does it matter when the devil says amen when the king of kings is on our side hey word of life tabernacle amen let me remind you who's on your side tonight amen the same god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob amen has come down in this generation and has manifested himself amen to give you access to the things of god listen church amen i hear the devil's voice amen but i want to tell the devil i can out praise him are you hearing me trying to set this meeting amen but i can't tell you this i can out sing and i may not be able to carry a tune in the bucket amen but when you begin to lift up please destroy god against your voice it begins to drown out the voice of your enemy oh church of the living god amen you want to break through in this church and then raise your voice one time amen and let the king of kings amen hear your praises and he'll come down in the middle of the church he'll fight your battles and then he'll make ways out of no ways he'll take the crooked streaks and make the highway straight he'll take the mountains and make him planes he's god and there's nothing he cannot do he's the same yesterday amen today and forever if you want it amen it's here for you and there ain't no devil got a right ain't meant to stand there and say you can't have it hey we're not a bunch of aliens tonight amen we're the we're the blood-bought sons and daughters of god amen can i take my a minute tonight and remind you who you are you ain't a slave you ain't a peasant you ain't a second class heaven citizen amen you are a son amen or daughter of the living god amen your name is sealed in the lamb's book of life amen with the old blood of jesus christ and there ain't no devil i said there ain't no devil past or present or future amen that can take your name out of the lamb's book of life come on church you are the sons and daughters of promise rise up generation and then rise up and possess what you have need of oh to think tonight amen our access to god is through the lamb somebody shout thank god for the lamb our access to god is through the lamb amen he was god's lamb he he was god's provided lamb amen provided for us amen that we sinners might have access amen to god through him amen think about this the time that we're living in is an odd time can you say amen it's a time when the prophet would say the greatest thing we can achieve is life at the same time he would say that people are so dissatisfied with life that they are trying to end their life now you see what you see why that is is because there's two types of life and then there's a natural life and then there is a spiritual life or an eternal life amen see how does the natural life come amen the natural life comes amen through the sexual blood amen through that sex of blood amen comes to comes the passing down of genes and then there can be high blood pressure genes amen it can be it can be it can be tempers in those genes and then there's all kinds of things that can be rest him in the genes of that sexual blood amen that was passed down to you amen but my bible says if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable amen see tonight if all we have is just the hope that someday we're going to receive eternal life then that tells me i cannot preach tonight that you can be the victorious church you say what are you talking about if i've got to stand here tonight and say someday we'll have eternal life and someday we'll have the holy ghost and someday our sins will be forgiven and someday the curses have been that have followed you since you as a child amen will be broken someday then there's no authority in this service tonight amen but when i can stand here and say amen that we have been given more than a sexual blood we have been given the perfect blood of the almighty god amen then i can tell you what the prophet said he said when you're born again amen the life of that blood comes on the inside of you he said and it's through his holy blood that we have access to life and our sexual blood is dismissed preach preacher thank you i believe i will our sexual blood is dismissed and we have the blood of jesus christ that stands for an atonement amen making an atonement for our sins and then see tonight amen how many's heard the promises preached amen and you wanted to possess them amen you wanted to possess that promise of joy you wanted that promise of peace you wanted that promise amen where he said i'll give you a peace amen that'll pass all understand it and something inside of you said raise up and get it amen but the devil raised up and said but you cannot get it amen because your mom had done this and your daddy done this and your grandpa was this amen and you made this mistake amen but i didn't come tonight amen to bargain with the devil amen i come to tell the devil what the prophet said he said tonight amen by the blood of almighty god amen the sexual blood is dismissed and there is an atonement in the presence of god for every recipient of the blessings of god come on church you ain't gonna stay on the outside the night like a kid at the candy store and wish you could go in and get it there is a blood that has been provided tonight that you can raise up you can walk in the arcade store you can walk around well i feel like preaching here a minute amen you can walk around you can see what is yours amen well brother andrew i see something up there brother harvey but it's a little too high don't worry he's got a stepladder amen you can climb up there and you can possess it are you hearing me amen this message is full of more than legalism it's full of more than a bunch of do's and don'ts amen this message is the blessings of god in this generation that for the first time in 2000 years there could be a people on the earth that enjoyed serving god this ain't a burden to be here tonight it ain't a burden to preach this message amen because brother caleb there's a blood that has been provided amen that the blood of my ancestors has been dismissed brother hey this ain't a new creation based upon human line blood this is a new creation amen based upon the blood that didn't come from a jew it didn't come from a gentile this blood came from the almighty god somebody shout our old blood has been dismissed amen now when you realize that that old blood has been dismissed when you realize that oh i don't blood between your mother and father amen has been dismissed over your soul amen you know what comes with that there comes a boldness behind that amen that's why paul would say having therefore brethren boldness amen to enter in the holiest of holies how by the blood of jesus and then see they could stop you if you tried to go in based on your natural blood they could put a stop sign up and say you cannot have this if you're going in based on your natural blood amen by the prophet come and say it the old blood has been dismissed amen it used to be a sin to go in amen but now it's a sin to stay out amen i'm talking about a church amen that's going beyond the first courts they're going to be on the second quarter they're going into the holiest of holies hey come on church amen where is this the kind of glory it's in the holies of holies where is this true bread it's in the holies of holies where is the presence of god it's in the holies of holy come on church we ain't got to stand outside and let somebody go in and come out and tell us what it's like amen but tonight we can get up they meant and every butt bought son and amen can walk in the presence where the shoe bread is you can get you an armor full you can get your hand full oh the faint tonight the devil can't keep us out he ain't strong enough to keep us out he ain't got enough lies to keep us out hey devil you're not dealing with just a church you're dealing with the bloodball church of the living god amen that says we've heard your lies we've heard your nonsense amen but there's a boldness has come with the blood of god we're not going to sit here and die ain't been wishing we could have a revival amen listen we could understand the word we're going to get up amen and we're going to walk through the storm and we're going to pick up what we want oh anybody here say god make me bold anybody hey there's one amen there's one anybody say god make me bold amen you say blender why do i need to be bold because when you want to enter in every devil in hell is going to stand there and say you can't go in they're going to stand there and say well you did this and you said that and this is against you and that's against you amen but when you've got the blood of jesus amen applied to your soul you can stand there with a boldness and say what sin are you talking about amen i don't remember it amen my father don't remember it come on church when do we have access to these things oh brother andrew we'll have it in the millennium amen we won't need healing in the millennium we won't need salvation we

above sin and something raises up in you and says i want it amen the preacher talks about a peace amen they can fill your home and something raises up in you and says i want it amen do you realize tonight amen we have access by faith amen to believe the word we've heard and to apply it to our lives and to manifest it in this age are you hearing that i mean you ever stayed at somebody's house

restricted amen if you wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning and you want a cup of coffee amen you get up go downstairs amen there may be somebody sitting there since you can't have a right ain't meant to make a cup of coffee but if they're not the owner of that house they don't have no authority over your decisions amen if the owner of the house amen release their promise to you everything in this house is yours every utensil every utility you can have amen that it don't matter who wakes up and says you can't have it there's a boldness in you that says i hear you but i ain't paying attention because the owner give me permission to have i say to not church i hear that devil saying we can't have peace and lead us here i say shut up devil you're not the owner and then the owner told me i could have the same peace that he had oh yes sir amen where are we at tonight church we're laying on the bosom of el shaddai amen you say where's hats amen the prophet said that's the old and the new testament he said right here like this baby that's fitting in sick it lays upon its mother's breast and begins to nurse its strength back from her because it's satisfied amen while it's a nursing the only access it has and knows of is the mother's breast it knows no dose of medicine you might give him a dose of medicine but he'll squeal and cry amen give him a shot in the arm and he'll carry on but the only access amen to satisfy is the mother's breast amen the only thing you give him a shot in the arm he'll keep on crying you give him a dose of medicine he'll keep on crying amen but you lame up on the up on the breast of his mother he meant it'll satisfy him it'll hush his cry you know what that's saying brother that's saying that baby don't have to accept the substitute when he has access to the genuine amen he don't have to accept amen amen some shot of medicine amen some dose of medicine amen he can go to the mother's breast amen where he came from oh god i felt like preaching he meant where he came from and can draw amen the life of his mother into him are you hearing me church what i'm telling you is in this service tonight you don't have to accept a substitute you have been given access to the real genuine amen spirit of god so i say the only access amen to satisfy a flooding church is the spirit of god the only access amen to quiet the nerves of the nervous christian is the spirit of god amen the only access amen to bring peace in the midst of the storm it's the spirit of god oh church i'm not talking about a one-way access i'm talking about a two-fold access what is a two-fold access brother joe it's this way god wants to access man and man wants to access god amen look at what this word access means by that by by webster definition it means a means of approaching amen or entering place the right or opportunity amen to use or benefit from something amen the right or opportunity ain't meant to approach or to see someone see then this service tonight is your right amen amen the holy ghost tonight amen is your right you say what do you mean it's right you've got a right to enjoy this service you've got a right to raise your hand you've got a right to dance in the spirit you've got a right to sing the song brother david you got a right amen to lift up your voice amen and sing and design amen brother ben you've got a right tonight amen to mount this pulpit and preach the unsearchable riches of christ are you here in the church we're not here as a bunch of as a bunch of thieves and robbers ain't been trying to sweep for the church and find something amen we got a right to declare that malachi 4 is fulfilled we got a right to declare that the son of man has descended in this generation we got a right to declare that the seven seals have been opened we got a rot tonight amen by the promise of the holy ghost we got a right oh glory we got a right to not church to have church we got hey then we got a right tonight ain't meant to get drunk in the spirit we got a rot tonight ain't meant to cast all of our burdens upon the lord and say father i can't carry it no further but you said come unto me all ye that are weak and heavy laden and i will give you rest we got a rock tonight church to go in the holies of holies oh god do you see it tonight church you're not robbers you've got a right to be here you have been summoned you have been called you have been chosen you have been hand selected you have been hand-picked he meant to be where you are tonight now david will say it this way he'll say blessed is the man whom now chooses and calls us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts and we and we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of the holy temple see then tonight church we are here by a right and we have a right to approach now you know that there is a right way to approach and there is a wrong way to approach the problem of god will say it like this he'll say you approach a judge with the right way you approach a young lady you don't come up here and say hey young lady like to talk to you sometime he said she'll tell you where to get on and where to get off he said there's a right way amen of approach he said then tonight amen there's a way to approach all things and there is a way to approach god amen see we must find amen the way of approach somebody say that with me v amen the way of approach amen to the great divine judge amen god himself so what that tells me brother ben is it's not a way to approach god amen but it's the way to approach god amen paul or rather thomas will say lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way notice thomas didn't say halloween no away he said how do we know the way then jesus said i am the way amen i am the way amen the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father amen by me so he didn't broaden it and then he didn't say i am away and i am a truth and i am alive amen but he narrowed it down by the allen so amen so accurate amen that nobody could disagree amen that jesus christ is the way amen jesus christ is the lie jesus christ is the truth come on church amen you say with under there but it's about 50 people now i don't care if there was five amen this is not a church amen that's following god in a way this is a church that is following god in the way and because of that there ought to be a child in every heart there ought to be an amen on every tongue we're not here as a bunch of confused people amen trying to find out how to approach god we have found the way it's the holy ghost way it's the message of the hour away and we got a rot we got a rock tonight church amen we're in the way amen the way means the highway the way means the journey amen the way means the course of conduct we have got a cure tonight and calvary is the cure somebody say with me christ is the cure we have found it tonight amen christ is the cure he's the only foundation he's the only way there's things you can get from christ that you can't get nowhere else christ is the way not a way he is the way the church is fine and we love them but the church is not the way jesus is the way you cannot cast your cares upon the church the church has no salvation it can only point you to jesus who is the only salvation he is the way the truth and the life the only way to the father is through jesus and the only comforter and the only one who knows how to care for us for we can't even care for one another are you hearing me amen that brother david that just broke something open to me right there amen i may not get halfway through this night but there's an inspiration here amen that just opened something to me amen the church is not the way we thank god for the church amen but the church is not the way you know what that tells me amen the people in the church have no dictatorship over how far you go in christ amen the people in the church have no right to raise their voice over how far you go can i take some liberty here amen the church has no authority to say that a young person can't come to the altar and receive the holy ghost amen the church has no authority amen to say that god is not healing no more these blessings is in christ and if you get in christ tonight all things are yours are you here amen the church may tell you you can't have it but if christ said it's yours you can salute the church and say i appreciate your church but i'm gonna believe what christ said amen christ said i could stay awake in the house of god amen christ said it doesn't matter how dark my past is it doesn't how bitter amen the things i've been through are amen if the spirit of god amen descends in the sanctuary and the holy ghost begins to overshadow the church i've got a right amen to let go and let god have his way are you hearing me tonight church amen the church didn't give you these rights and the church can't take them away amen these rocks are in christ they are yours tonight by a divine promise is there any bethlehem dwellers that'll raise up tonight and say satan i've stayed out long enough but tonight i'm going in i'm going in for my healing i'm going in for my joy i'm going in for my victory i'm going in for my satisfying portion glory church ain't got no right to put a stop sign up this is christ amen this message is christ are you hearing me amen i believe in church order i believe in church conduct amen don't put that spirit against me i believe in those things amen but there's one thing i do not believe i do not believe in a bunch of self-righteousness amen stiff-necked uncircumcised amen bunch of formal devils in the house of god amen that says we cannot have what god said we can have if god said i can have it if it helps you and the devil and every demon in hell david white i'm going to have it if the holy ghost and i can shout i'm going to shout [Music] i'm not in a way tonight brother howard i'm in the way tonight i'm in the holy ghost way i'm in the revealed way i'm in the way amen where angels walk i'm walking in the same way enoch walked i'm walking the same way isaac walk i'm walking tonight in the same way amen that abraham walked in when he met melchizedek underneath an oak tree and he served his victorious child communion i'm in the way leave me alone it's a glorious way it's a wonderful way it's a blessed way it's a way where i have access to all things oh somebody give him some praise i said somebody give them some praise go ahead and knock that formal devil out here tonight you're in the way church you've got a right to have joy you've got to write amen to say amen you got a right ain't meant to raise your hands you got a rot the sexual blood has been dismissed you got a right to not church you got a right to go in heavenly places there's some people here to know or some people here tonight that knows amen the church is good and we thank god for the church amen the church can't give us what christ can oh god preach amen what are you saying i'm saying what the prophet said it's not enough just to get in the church you got to get in christ now brother andrew be careful amen you're putting too much emphasis on the message it's all a guy the other day he said you put too much emphasis on the message brother joel i let that get to me for about about a total of two days until i heard the prophet say that the message is christ and i said what is that guy's phone number to tell me i'm putting too much emphasis on the message is to say i'm putting too much emphasis on christ amen this message is not a way to the rapture this message is not a better fault amen this message is the way and without this rapture brother david we're headed for tribulation but with this message tonight we are walking in the way of light we we are fellowshipping with the almighty god we are talking with angels we are communion with our father come on church we're not stumbling around they've been trying to we have gained access by the way let me tell you what the prophet said he said get in christ can we say that together get in christ amen you say andrew how do i do it amen what do i do if there's a question there's got to be an answer remember nicodemus when jesus said man must be born again he'd give him direct instructions and nicodemus brother david turned around and asked a direct question he said how can me being an old man return into my mother's womb for the second time amen and jesus said i'm not talking about that birth i'm talking about the birth it comes from the water amen the blood and the spirit i'm talking about nicodemus the reason you're in this condition is because of the sex of blood amen that come through the fall in the garden but i have got a blood here present tonight nicodemus it will set you free [Music] nicodemus said how can these things be said nicodemus asked the question amen how can i be born again i'm an old man enter in my mother's womb the second time he said except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god that word is really understand the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you so you couldn't actually see it unless you see it operating i ain't got time to preach there but the only way you'll ever be able to understand is if you got born again and to be born again you've been filled with god's spirit then you're in christ and when you're in christ the holy spirit has broken oh jesus when you're in christ and the holy spirit is in you amen then the holy spirit that wrote the bible amen that manifested christ is in you to recognize his own self a mouthful amen if you got the holy ghost okay come on brother amen how did jesus amen come to luke 4. amen and find the scroll and go read isaiah 60. amen are you with me amen he read isaiah 60. amen you know what happened and then he read it and he said this day this scripture is fulfilled he said this verse is talking about me you know how he could say that is because the same holy ghost amen that fell upon isaiah to write it was the same holy ghost that descended on the river jordan and filled that man called jesus's body and he went in the temple and he picked up the word and he said this is me and then he found the place that was written not about peter not about bartholomew amen but about his own self and that same holy ghost has come down in this generation [Music] i'm about to bust up here amen you know why that you're enjoying the house of god more now than ever you know why that something is pulsating in your bosom when you hear the word preach you know why now it's not a million miles away but it's right here in your heart you know why because the same holy ghost amen that wrote the bible has returned in this generation and has filled you that when you read the bible you can say mama that's me somebody just go and say it mama that's me brother ben i see you brother harvey i see you brother branham we saw you but the greatest day is when we see ourselves in the word oh and brother i'm asked direct questions you know what he ain't going to give you indirect answers when he asks you a direct question he's going to give you a direct answer he's going to say this who is christ question isn't it he's in you as much as you'll let him be he's pressing trying to get into you to move into you today and you stand off and wonder and look engaged hold back a little while don't do that move right straight into the kingdom of god the hour is here are you with me amen the hour is here you say the hour is here yes sir he said i want to see him move don't you i want to see him i believe we will see him he's here now his power is moving what's making these people cry and shout and go on what's the matter it's the holy ghost in them it's the holy ghost in them if they could only realize and embrace the holy ghost amen believe in him amen bring him into your bosom light live right do nothing that would hinder him and say oh

same spirit see i want you to see it we know we know what it done for him now brother by the harvey we can take another hour and talk about what it done for him amen but let's bring it to what the prophet said we know what it done for him but i want you to see it not will it has done the same for you i want you to see tonight amen it's not going to do this for you it's already done it oh

wings i said it's time to spread your wings you've been moping around so long you forgot what it means to getting a good old-fashioned meat you've been moping by the pressures of the devil so long you forgot what it means to get lost while the preacher's preaching but tonight i declare it's a new day for this church it's a new beginning for every young person it's a new start rahab it's a new beginning ruth brother david i'm not crazy but i am a crazy man and you know what i know i know a little bit of praise does a whole lot of damage are you hearing me a little bit of praise that's a whole lot of damage what are you saying brother joe i'm saying right now you've got an enemy and i got an enemy sister joanne you got an enemy and i got an enemy but you know what brother ben my bible says there was a time when the enemy came in the church but the people of god began to praise god till the enemy got confused until the enemy got confused are you hearing me amen is there any praisers here tonight is there any worshipers here tonight is there any holy ghost people here tonight that says lord i know the devil's against my brother i know the devil's against my brother he's against my sister but i'm going to come in this church on wednesday night i'm gonna come in this church on sunday morning and i'm gonna start praising god until the devil that's after me and it's after my brother forgets who he's after and kills his own self amen because we are the quickened sons and daughters of promise are you hearing me tonight and then that devil didn't want me to open this door amen because he's had a good habit he's had a good habitation but you know what i served eviction notice on the devil tonight devil you got to find another place to live you got to find another church to torment you got to find another family he meant to try to destroy amen because god who is rich in mercy has come down in this generation and has transformed the gentiles not by our sexual blood but by the blood of god's own son are you hearing me tonight what are you doing i'm walking around in the arcade store is that okay i'm walking around the department store i'm getting everything god said

about somebody that's thrown something away don't it feel good to be free don't it feel good to spread your wings hallelujah [Music] thank you brother joe we're a free man this spirit we're feeling right now it ain't gonna leave us one of these days we're gonna step from time i don't know about you church i'm ready to let god have some access he said brandon you better calm down i better not brother allen you can close that door buddy if anybody wants to say anything else away we'll open it right back up he said well andrew what are you talking about i'm talking about letting god have the right away in the church you say with andrew what do you mean i mean this the pawn of god said people say well oh god i got a whole message here i'll preach it sometime quota god said we see trouble arise we see issues come up and we say well you know what the answer is christ just left the church he's no longer in the church the prophet said well that's where they stay with people who call themselves christians oh i belong to church that's good but you see the reason there's so much trouble in the church in so much confusion and discontentment is because that gee it's not because jesus isn't there it's because he can't gain access to the places he wants to go jesus ain't left this church jesus ain't left this message jesus has not left this bride's revival hallelujah thank you jesus it's because jesus can't gain access access in the places he wants to go we have those little compartments and we say oh no don't touch that now you can come in but oh that's far enough i'll join the church but otherwise let me run my own business jesus wants to be the supreme ruler you know what revelation 3 20 says behold i stand at the door and knock the lord if any man will hear my voice i will come into him and i will suffer them and he with me you know what i'm saying that word means amen you musicians forgive me okay i just had you change seats i'm sorry you know what that word means
