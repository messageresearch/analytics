great big hand tonight God bless you buddy amen God bless y'all this evening sure it's good to be here I appreciate my wife singing that song If y'all I know that most of y'all don't know her but if y'all know what she's been through the last three months that Satan's really bad her with some health issues and she's been uh she's been in the hospital she's been bedridden barely able to walk at times and the Lord's just moved in such a mighty way in her life over the past few months and just to see her be able to travel with me she was been stay she wasay staying at home some and just see her to be able to come and be able to sing and play Just does my heart good so we just we thank the Lord for that uh we sure do appreciate brother Ben having us he's been a friend uh a friend of ours for uh I guess a few years now several years and uh we uh we actually were from here originally some of you all might know me I'm originally over there from wart Ridge from Brother The Davids and we moved up to up to Ohio about a year and a half ago now and we've been out there for a little bit and uh we bring greetings from our pastor their true word brother Wayne Lawson and uh he asked s just to greet the church and so uh we sure do appreciate him having us here and we ask you guys just y'all just bear with me y'all just bear with us so we look forward to if y'all would please stand for the reading of the word we're going to begin in the Book of Joel the 2 chapter verse 28 amen J Joel 2:28 it would say and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and other men young and your young men shall see visions and from there reading a few passages of scripture from acts the 2 chapter verse 14 it would say but Peter standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell of Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose he didn't say they weren't drunk he said they weren't drunk as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and then one more place Romans the 8th chapter beginning in verse 9 it would say but ye are not in the flesh but you're in the spirit and if it so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his that's a powerful statement right there if you have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen God bless you this evening I would like to take for a title this evening the Dynamics in you amen let's bow our heads for a moment of prayer Lord Jesus we ask you just come in this service father Lord we love you and we thank you we appreciate the opportunity to be able to gather here Lord and to worship you father Lord to hear your word come forth Lord as we enter into this portion of the service I ask that you would just move this broken vessel aside father Lord you know every need you know every heart throughout this building I ask that Lord you would just move in a mighty way you would just move upon the souls father Lord whatever need they have I ask that you would just speak through me father that your word would come forth and would meet their need we put the service into your hands we love you in Jesus name we pray amen amen y'all can be seated this evening brother Brandon would say in the rising of the sun there's been churches churches Brides Brides churches brides and Brides but there's got to come one Hallelujah there's got to come a rule bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it that makes that church live that moves in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs what good does it do to give her a facelift or a simonized job when there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proves to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work no matter how much it proves to be right there's got to be a Dynamics to make it work so tonight taking for a title the Dynamics in you not just in the message not just in William brandom not just in your pastor not just in some preacher but the Dynamics in you I me here in Romans 8 these few verses we just read these scriptures there scriptures you know we've read our entire lives and most of us can recite it from memory but in this passage Paul would say four different times the spirit of Christ in you not above us not below us not around us not even just with us but that Spirit must be in you the prophet would say again in the rising of the sun it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come that fire is made to connect with the octane in the gasoline and when that explodes it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that is the real power of God the mechanics with the Dynamics amen that is the resurrection that is the real power of God and me I believe this evening that as the Bride of Jesus Christ we're at war with the devil we're at war with hell brother Brandon would say if Satan isn't fighting you it would mean that he's already got you I believe we're living in an age of War and we know that the Bible would tell us that this war that we are in it's we wrestle not against flesh and blood it's not a carnal War that's a revelation I believe we all must come to that this war cannot be won with the mind it's not a war that can be won with psychology it's not a war that can be won with intelligence or with any any sort of physical strength because it's not a a carnal war that we're struggling with it's a spiritual battle it's a spiritual war and the prophet would say in the first seal the angel of the church catches the mystery talking about brother brandom now not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this mystery and he goes to the people after the mystery has been given to him he goes to the people and what does he do he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war and then when the angel messenger proclaims the message it starts a spiritual war why does it start a war because the enemy knows that without this message the bride is defenseless our enemy knows that the only way for the bride to make a Rapture is through the message of the hour and so when the message is proclaimed it starts a war now we know that we cannot fight a spiritual battle with natural devices you can't fight a spiritual battle with just mechanics but in order to fight a spiritual enemy it's going to take a spiritual weapon it's going to take a spiritual Power Man brother brandham he would preach on the mechanics and Dynamics many times throughout his ministry but probably the most well-known is here in Rising of the sun which is where we're taking our thought out of 1965 this is the last Easter message that the prophet of God would ever preach it's just a few months before he goes off the scene and and the prophet he would draw us in this in this sermon to recognize that without the Dynamics without the spirit of God just hearing or just listening to this message can do you no good because you can have all the parts of the machine you can have everything oiled and everything greased just right you know you can go through all the process you can go through all the plans you can go through everything you can have you can have all the machines you can have you look at a car you can have the crankshaft you can have it you can have it tuned down just right you can have all the nuts and bolts torqued down to just exactly the right amount you can have everything old everything but until you p a gasoline into that engine and there's a spark to light it then that the mechanics will do it no good all the fine tuning doesn't do it no good polishing the hubs doesn't do no good because until there is a source of power that's applied to those mechanics it cannot run it cannot work all it is is a model I remember one time I was a little boy and I was mowing our yard I was probably 12 13 years old and our lawn mower I remember we were driving through dad had a he had an old zero attorney probably still has it and I was mowing the yard and our mower just stopped right there in the middle of the yard and you know I remember I get off and Dad wasn't available to come out there and so I remember thinking I'm going to impress my daddy I'm going to get off and I'm going to fix this lawn mower so I get off there I remember I pulled up the seat I did everything I knew how to do things that had nothing to do with the engine I was I was checking this I was checking the uh the battery making sure the terminals were clean I pull out the dipstick made sure there was oil I pull out the air filter clean out the air filter I did absolutely everything I knew I got under it checked that the belts were on the pulley and everything and I thought well it's just no lawn mower it's probably just gave up the ghost this lawnmower is probably just over with so so after a little while dad comes out there and I remember he he asked what's going on and I tell him everything I just done the whole process I gone through everything i' done to fix this L Mower and the first thing he tells me is he said does it have any gas in it and I went and I looked and sure enough that was the driest gas tank that you ever seen we put gas in it and that thing started up just fine but you know I had checked for everything except for the source of power I had gone through all the processes I made sure that all the mechanics were running perfectly smooth and I never gave a thought to the fact that maybe the thing that made the mechanics run wasn't there and the prophet of God in the rising of the sun he would tell the church you're polishing the hub caps you're fine tuning them in the machine you're oiling the mechanics expecting the machine to run but until there is a combustion that sets those mechanics in motion that machine will not move until you get the power of God moving in the church the mechanics cannot run the bride cannot work the body cannot move what is the power of God brother bandham said the Dynamics in you is the power of God Amen I believe this evening with every F of my beinging we've got the power of God in our midst I believe we've seen the power of God we felt the power of God not only have we seen it not only have we felt it but I believe that that power has been inside of us it's been placed inside of us on the inside of us it's been quickened in us until we don't just talk about it we don't just sympathize with it it's not just something that we agree with it's not just something we sit around and talk about but it's actually a part of who we are brother Brandon would say that he said that God is not calling for a group of people that are going to sit around and talk about the message he said that he's not calling for a group of people they're just going to sympathize with it they're just going to talk about it they're just going to agree with it they're just going to say that sounds good but brother Brandon said he's looking for a group of people that are going to get in the message amen and brother Brandon would say in the seven Church ages that was sets the body of Christ apart from the rest of the world from the rest of the church that she speaks with the power of God she moves with the power of God that's what sets you apart from the rest of the world tonight is that there was a power that was placed on the inside of you from before the foundation of the world that gives you the ability to speak healing into existence he gives you the power to send Devils Back To Hell it gives you the power to overcome this evil age because you have a power only inside of you that is greater than any other power on the face of the Earth in another place for the prophet would say see where we are at we see Nations breaking Israel Awakening the signs that this Bible for told for this day if that ain't more true for right now than any other time I don't know what it is he said we see the mechanical things taking place but now the spirit the Dynamics of that promised word to get into the church and to drive them into Calvary and to the Rapture amen the Dynamics will drive you into Calvary and to a Rapture notice you can't go to Calvary without first going you can't go to a Rapture without first going through Calvary not just the mechanics but it must be the Dynamics the prophet would say we've got the mechanics we love the mechanics and we do we know the mechanics we know how to shout we know how to praise we know how to dance we know how to sing right we know how to pray right we know how to do all these things we know how to listen to tape we know how to press play we know how to how to back the preacher we know how to do all these things but I'm here to tell you this evening church press and play won't take it to a Rapture listening to tapes ain't going to take it to a Rapture just reading your Bible ain't going to take it to a Rapture going through the some some 10 set plan is not going to take it to a Rapture but brother Brandon would tell the church we love the mechanics we know the mechanics but that's not what we are looking for but what we are looking for is to see the spirit of Christ to get into the church to get into the body until it drives the mechanics in your life brother Brandon would say I would rather see a man that was right in his spirit and wrong in his Doctrine than to see a man that was wrong in his right in his Doctrine and wrong in his spirit because he recognized that you could have all the right Doctrine you could have all the knowledge you could have all the wisdom you could have all the mechanics you could go to Seminary you could go to school you could get an education oh but Doctrine won't drive you to a Rapture knowledge is not going to drive you to a Rapture wisdom won't drive you to a Rapture all these things will not drive you to a Rapture but there is a force that is Dr that is inside the Bride of Jesus Christ that will drive this body into a Rapture there was a dynamic Force church that was placed inside of a seed before the foundation of the world and when that lie struck that seed it begin to sprout forth and brother Brenham said that Dynamic power will be what drives you to Calvary it won't be some 10-step plan it won't be just listening to a preacher it won't be just coming to church two or three times a week it won't just be listening to a tape every day but until you get the dynamic power inside of you driving the mechanics in your life that is what's going to drive you to a Rapture that is what drives this bride body oh church I don't believe we're just a mechanical machine I don't believe we just go through the motions every Sunday morning and and Sunday night and or Wednesday night or Thursday night but the Dynamics are moving in the Church of the Living God it's driving us to a Rapture it's driving us to a deeper revelation is driving us to a deeper relationship is driving us to a body change there is a power that is moving in this building and that power church is not just some work up it's not just some emotional buildup it's not just something that we like to feel that we just like to see oh but is a dynamic power it's greater than any devil it's greater than any sickness it's greater than any complex it's greater than any trial that you're ever going to go through it's greater than any battle you're ever going to face there is a dynamic power that completely overcomes any power Satan has it completely overcomes any Authority Satan has over your life because when that Dynamic power comes into the Bride of Jesus Christ it gives you the same Authority that the groom has whenever the dynamic power that was in the groom is placed in the bride you can walk where the groom walks you can step where the groom steps you can speak what the groom speaks you can do what the groom does why because the same power that the groom has is now moving inside of you amen do you believe that tonight I believe that we are living in a time today where is of the utmost importance that we recognize the age that we are living in brother would preach a sermon called recognizing your day in this message and if you listen to this message it's amazing to me how the prophet would he would literally beg and plead with the people to recognize that you're living in the last days and in one place he would say people recognize the age that you're in look at what's happened look at what's promised recognize the day that you're living in the prophet was so emphasized and so uh see he was he was so strain on the importance of recognizing that you're living in the last days because we know that God would always move more in the last days than any other time just looking at the life of Jesus God would move more in the last days of his life than at any other time and if you begin to listen to this sermon the prophet he will go through and he will show us how that every time every time we move from one age to another age God always sends a message that is Anointed and elect for that God's predestinated in that age God sends a messenger with a message throughout every single age and he would take an entire service on urging us to recognize the day that we're in because the prophet knew he said that you could see the message message you could know the message you could recognize the message sent by the angel messenger but unless you recognize that that message will not just sent from any group of people that message was not just sent for any church it was not just sent for any group it was not just sent for any age but you must recognize that this message has been sent for you as the Bride of Jesus Christ in the day that you were living in this message would not a work for Luther's day it would not a work for Wesley's day it would not a work for Paul's day why because it was not given for their day it was not given for Paul's day it was not given for Wesley's day but as word this message has been given for your day for your time it has been given for you to manifest it's been given for you to express for you to bring forth this Dynamics has been given for you oh it's I I believe it's time this message has been given the word has been revealed the word has been fully revealed and it's your day to manifest it it's your time to manifest it we recognize who we are we recognize our commission we recognize our message and I believe that this this with this even that this BR can recognize who we are and what the power we have because we have watched as this message has fulfilled everything it promised it would do this message brother Braham did not leave one loose Corner brother Bram did not leave one loose thread he did not leave one question unanswered but this message has done everything it promised it would do we have seen the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we have seen the outpouring of the Dynamics we have seen the Dynamics come to life we have watched the chains of fear fall off we have watched the shackles of unbelief fall off of the Bride of Jesus Christ we ain't just mechanics we ain't just going through the motions we ain't just following after a tradition but the Dynamics is alive in the Church of the Living God we have seen him move in power we have seen him move in Authority we have seen him move in healing move in Deliverance and I believe it's moving through this church it's moving proving who we are vindicating who we are just as much as the pillar of fire Vindicated who brother brandham was it also Vindicated who you were because it showed that there was a prophet that was s for a group of people and there was a dynamic power that was following that Prophet that was going to be transferred into the bride body of Jesus Christ amen I believe it's moving through this church we know who we are and this is our day to manifest the word it's our day to manifest his message it isn't somebody else's day it's your day oh come on somebody Joshua had his day Moses had his day Paul had his day brother Brenham has his day but I declare to you tonight this is not their day this is not their time this is not their season but this is your day that God has poured out his Spirit Upon A group of people a people that will believe it a people that will manifest it a people that will hear it and that they will believe it and man manest it oh hallelujah it's your day tonight it's your time it's your season it was not given for somebody else you must recognize that this message was given for you it was given this Dynamic power was given for you if you look at the definition of mechanics versus Dynamics the answer according to physics it's actually it's it's a physics thing and it's very simple there are many there like several complicated essays and articles online if you go to looking where people they try to break it down but the is actually very simple I was able to just find an actual like a college just a physics textbook and it just explained the answer very simply mechanics is a study of motion Dynamics is a study of motion and force together or the effect that a force has on the motion of an object so the mechanics is simply when a body moves is in motion you understand that it moves you know that it moves you know the Motions is supposed to go through oh but the dynamic says in order for that object to move the way that it's supposed to move there must be a force that moved upon that body that made it move there must be a force that is greater than that object that made it move oh church you can sit there and you can go through the motions all you want to you can go to church twice a week you can pay your ti you can give your offerings you can you can listen to your Tes but until you get a revelation that there is a force that is greater than you that's greater than your achievements that's greater than your than your accomplishments that's greater than your battle greater than your enemy until you get that Revelation all you're doing is going through the motions oh but if you can just surrender to the spirit of God if you can just surrender over to the force that's moving through your life that spirit will begin to move there will be a power move through your life until you don't control your tongue you don't control your mind you don't control your thoughts you don't control your hands you don't control your feet oh but there is a force that's begin to move inside of you and you are no longer fighting a battle but now there is a force that is grating that that is fighting that battle for you oh church I'm here to tell you that Dynamic force is greater than any devil it's got more Force than any enemy it's got more Force than any power it's got more Force than any complex it's got more Force than any depression it's got more Force than any pornography I'm here to tell you tonight Church there was a dynamic force that comes with the message of the hour it's for the body of Jesus Christ it wasn't for the Pentecostals it wasn't for the Baptist he would have given it to them if it was but he didn't give it to them he gave it to you he gave this power to you he gave the Dynamics to you and he said you manifest it you speak with authority you speak with power you bring it forth because I've given you this message oh Hallelujah you got to surrender to that Force brother bandam said complete and total surrender not partial surrender not say well Lord I'll give you my heart on Sunday and I'll give you my heart on Wednesday or Thursday oh but every day Lord oh I Surrender my life completely to you in order for that Dynamics to move you got to stop trying to move the mechanics yourself if you're sitting there trying to push a car that car ain't going to move if you're sitting there you can run you can bump up against it you can do everything you want to but if there ain't no gasoline in it if there ain't no spark that lights it up and moves it oh you're wasting your time sitting there try to push that car you you can sit there and you can push that gas pedal all day long and I believe it's sometimes church we got so many people that they sit in the church and they're sitting there and they're stepping on the gas pedal they're sitting there they're trying to go back but there ain't no gas in the tank there ain't no spark that's lighing the car and they ain't moving anywhere why because they're trying to move the mechanics yourself and church I'm here to tell I know I know I I've listened to anointed ones at the end time I know there are people that come to church and they're going to spend their lives in church they're going to dance they're going to shout along with you and they're not going to be the elect they're not going to have this Dynamic power but the difference between you and them is that they move the mechanics in their life oh but you have another Force that's moving the dynamic the mechanics in your life and that is a dynamic power oh that they could never have that's a dynamic force that they can never have oh Hallelujah whenever you begin to get that power you speak the word you ain't got to have some preacher do it you ain't got to have the pastor do it you ain't got to call call up your grandma or call up your grandpa have them do it for you you a got to call up Mom and Dad but Church you even you young people you can speak the word you speak the power the Dynamics in you brother bandam didn't say the power of God is the Dynamics in me he didn't say the power of God is the Dynamics in William bandam he said the Dynamics in you is the power of God I say you speak the word you speak healing you speak overcoming you move the power of God oh you speak it you speak it church I'm siing tired of this mindset this power was just for brother brandham oh this all was just for brother Bram no it wasn't for brother brandham it was for you it was for you to manifest it was for you to believe it was for you to hack B it was for you to speak oh Hallelujah it was for you Amen brother Braham said Satan has all the mechanics in the world that's a direct quote he has all the mechanics in the world you can't beat him with mechanics if you look at a boxer ring I was going through and looking at Muhammad Ali when he fought big George Forman in the way that he did it he recognized that he could not fight him with mechanics he could not defeat that guy with mechanics he cannot defeat him by going through the motions like he normally did he cannot defeat him just by running around the wing ring and just by just by doing the right punches and doing the Right Moves he couldn't do it why because George Foreman had more mechanics than he had he had more power than he had so what he have to do he had to get a find a greater power and he began to work on his mind he began to work on his mind and so many times That's what Satan does to us he begins to work on her mind he begins to work on her mind why because he knows that he doesn't have the power that you have he knows he doesn't have the authority that you have in one place brother Brandon would say the only Power Satan has over you is is a bluff the only def the only weapon Satan has against you is to convince you that you ain't got the power to defea him brother B said that's the only Power Satan has over you oh but if you could just recognize tonight church that there is a dynamic power oh that is alive and moving inside of you it isn't just the church this isn't a dead church this isn't a dead body this isn't going to be a dead bride oh but this is a Living Church this is a living bride this is a bride that is dressed and ready to meet our groom a bride that is moving with the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost we're filled with the Holy Ghost we're filled with the Holy Spirit and we're moving with that power oh Hallelujah brother Brandon he would be begin the rising of the sun he would go back to the first time that the spirit of God ever moved upon the Earth and he would show us in just the first few paragraphs how at the first time the spirit ever spoke it brought forth light he would say that the first time that the spirit in the word the spirit and the spoken word ever came together and formed one and and joined in Union he said the result was Lot he would say there was a time when the world was laying in utter Darkness it was without form and it was void and it was covered with water and there was laying in that dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be light see God had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live he would say the sun rose and swept across its rays and it dried up the waters from the earth and it made an atmosphere above and for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed that was a great hour I mean the first time the spirit ever spoke life came forth that light was the evidence that the spirit has been moving oh when I say there was a light that has been placed inside this church and it is evidence is evidence that the spirit is moving and not only did that Spirit bring light but the prophet said that that light that came by the spirit created an atmosphere to light for life to exist where it could not exist before that light that Spirit brought light and that light brought life life is essential to light light excuse me light is essential to life brother Brandon he would tell us in one point without light nothing can live without light there is nothing upon the Earth but what has to come by the Light of the Sun in another place wheat is sold in the ground but when that sun gets just right it's got to live see it can't live without the sun light is crucial and vital in order for life to exist now if you actually look at how the sun produces light most of you probably know you learn about it in school it's in the textbooks but it's a process called nuclear fusion and basically the sun is made up of billions and trillions of hydrogen atoms and and these all these hydrogen atoms they're at the core of the Sun and they're moving so fast they're they begin to move and they're picking up speed and they're moving so fast and what happens is that they move so fast that whenever they bump into each other because of the great speed that they're moving at they don't bounce off but they actually fuse together and it create it it requires such a great force that takes these hydrogen atoms and to move them at a speed to where it will fuse them together and in order to produce that life there must be a fourth that is strong enough to take these two separate particles and to combine them into one oh brother Brandon would say what makes the Dynamics live was the spirit and the word came together to form one and when that force it sends those particles together they fuse into each other and I loved how it said when I was reading it that they become no longer two hydrogen atoms there was no longer any trace of hydrogen in the final product but when they come and they fuse together it under goes a complete and total transformation process and becomes an entirely new particle a particle of light oh Hallelujah there was a force that moved Upon Your Life Church from before the foundation of the world it took the spirit and it took the word and it took and it pushed them together and it combine them together and fuse them together on the inside of you in order to produce a light a light that is unlike anything the world has ever seen you were once a carnal being born and shaped in iniquity you were born into this world speaking lies oh but there was a light that shine upon your life from before the foundation of the world the spirit and the word came together inside of her body body and It produced the light and that light was not just going to be any light oh but that light was going to be the very force that brought that seed of life on the inside of you oh Hallelujah Church we're living in a dark World we're living in the darkest airs the world has ever seen oh but as long as this bride is still standing there will still be a light that is shining in the darkest night there will sh still be a light that is shining forth there will still be a pillar of fire there will still be a power that is coming forth oh as long as we have the Dynamics there is still a light that is lighting the way oh we still have a power lighting the way for us brother Brandon would say today if that light of God that Holy Spirit ever strikes a predestinated seed whose name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the Bible says that that's right the light will shine not the Light May shine not the light might Shine the Light will shine he said you can preach to some and it seems like it's just water on a duck's back and it just Falls right off oh but let that seed one strike and Watch What Happens quickly something is there right now it's a predestinated seed it's got to come and when that life strikes it they get it oh come on church can I get a witness tonight that will say I got it when that lie struck The Siege on the inside of my heart I got it I didn't wonder who Malachi 4 was I didn't wonder what this message was I wasn't confused on the godhead I wasn't confused on adoption I wasn't confused on bri Authority oh when thy life struck thy seed all of a sudden a force came inside my life and I got it I got the Revelation oh what once was something I just heard the preacher told what once was just a story but once was just something coming out of the preacher's mouth all of a sudden became a living reality oh I had heard he was a way maker I heard he was a promisee keeper I heard he was a savior I heard he was a Healer I heard he was peace in the storm I heard he was calming the midst of Chaos oh but all of a sudden that life struck the seed and what once was just something I had heard all of a sudden struck my heart and became a living reality oh I know he's a way maker I know he's a promis keeper I know he's peace in the storm I know he's calming the midst of chaos I know he's the lad of the world why because that Li struck the seed and I began to manifest the Dynamics of the word oh I'm no longer confused church this bride ain't going through an identity crisis we ain't confused on who we are we know who we are we know the power we have brother bam said when the bride of Christ knows who she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works he says she will be an invincible Army and Satan will stand powerless before her oh Satan was saying powerless before you he says powerless before you T not if you know who you are if you know the power that you hold if you know that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and that there is a dynamic force that was selected and ordained and predestinated for you not for any other group not for any other denominational power but th Dynamics was made for you to overcome in this evil age oh when you do that Satan is powerless before you brother B said there is nothing he can throw at you oh it'll just bounce off of you and fly back to him I say there is nothing when you've got this Dynamic power oh that Satan has over you oh Hallelujah that nuclear fusion it produces those particles of light it takes place at the very center of the sun Now it only takes about 8 and a half minutes for that light to go from the surface of the Sun where is from the surface of the Sun to reach you to where where it is at Earth it only takes about eight and a half minutes but I was doing this research and that light is not produced at the surface of the sun it's produced at the core of the Sun and that light that every single particle little bitty Photon particle of life that is ever produced in the sun has to fight through 432 th000 miles of hydrogen atoms before it breaks through the surface of the Sun and this process takes well over a 100,000 years well over a 100,000 years for a single particle of lot to go from the center of the Sun to reach you at to be manifested to where you are at oh I begin to think about that oh I begin to look at that and I started getting excited why because I begin to think well over a 100,000 years so when I get up in the morning that life that's shining through my window that life that shines upon me that life that manifested upon me it wasn't made last year it wasn't made last week it wasn't made last month it wasn't made when I gave my heart to the Lord that light shining on me it wasn't made when I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it wasn't made when I was born it wasn't made when I came to the message Oh but before the foundation of the world that was a life was produced it wasn't made in 1965 it wasn't made in Paul's day it wasn't made in Joshua's day it wasn't made in Moses day Oh but before the foundation of the world there was a life that came forth there Spirit and the word came together and formed a lot on the inside of you oh Church it might have taken thousands and thousands of years to reach you oh but you were in the might of God from before the foundation of the world and there was a lot that was placed on the inside of you oh why because he knew oh I'm going to have a bride in the last days that's going to be living in a dark world they're going to be living in a dark time oh but they are going to need a lot they are going to need a dynamic Force so I'm going to play on the inside of them oh Hallelujah that light wasn't made last week it wasn't made when you got saved it wasn't made when you came to the altar that might have been when the sea begin to sprout forth oh but that light was made before the foundation of the world oh Hallelujah young people how does Satan try to attack you I tell you how San tries to attack you today he tries to take you back to when he gave your heart to the Lord he tried to take you back oh you didn't really do it right you weren't really sincere you didn't go through all the steps you didn't do the right plan you didn't do anything right that you didn't really give your heart to the Lord he tries to take you back to when you got the Holy Ghost you weren't really sincere you didn't do it right it was just an emotional work up it was just some emotional buildup you just did to please Mom and Daddy you just did to do this and do that he tries to take you back to when you came to the message and tries to tell you it was just for some preacher you just heard some preacher and it sounded good and so you go to that church that ain't really the bride Authority that ain't really how adoption works that ain't really how that works that ain't really the power you have that's the way sat to get that light out of you oh and I want to make a declaration to that devil tonight I say in order for you to get that light out of a briad body in order for you to get that light out of me you would have to go back to before you were even created I say Satan would have to go back Church to before he was created because before he was there that light was there before the Devils were there that light was there before this world was there there was a light that was shining and there was plac in the bride body of Jesus Christ and that light is now shining upon you oh Satan has no authority over you if the if you were existed before he did oh I say Satan has no power over you he has no power over that loud why he wasn't there when it was made oh Hallelujah he can't get that power out of you he wasn't there when it was placed on the inside of you he didn't even exist yet I see how can Satan take something out of you that he wasn't even alive to see that he wasn't even alive there oh Church there was a Dynamic power that's been placed in the body of Jesus Christ and I say Satan has no power over you he stands powerless before you pornography is Raging complexes are raging depression is Raging in our young people like never before Oh will I say get that out of your mind get that out of your soul and let the dynamic power of Jesus Christ begin to move through your soul it'll push the depression out it'll push the complexes out it'll push the pornography out it'll push the issues out oh oh church let that Dynamic Force begin to move through your life it will stand behind you that force will push you that force will carry you this message will hold you oh you don't carry this message this message carries you you don't hold this message this message holds you and this message will take you all the way oh this is not a dynamic power that's going to take you part of the way church it's not a dynamic power that's going to take you a few steps it's going to take you to a certain point it's not going to take you to a certain place oh with this message this Dynam power is going to take this bride every step of the way it's going to take you all the way it's going to take you to Glory it's going to take you of the ramparts of Glory it's going to take you beyond Jordan oh this message is going to take you all the way oh Hallelujah Ephesians 6:12 it was say for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers rulers of Darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore takeen you the whole armor of God the be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about I'm sorry having your LS G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet sha with the with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the Helen of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God the sword of spirit which is the word of God the prophet would say the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit the Dynamics in the church is the refilling of the holy spirit so we recognize from the scriptures that we're reading that this time that we're living in we're living in a time of War we're not living in a time of peace I hate to break it to you the modern conventional ideology of Christianity is that you give your heart to Jesus and you never got to fight again you give your heart to the Lord and you put your name in the church book and you never got to fight you never got to battle you never got to wrestle again you're good but that ain't that ain't true that's a of the devil brother bam said that we are warriors and he said that we will fight for every in of ground that we possess and as Warriors a warrior has got to have a weapon and that weapon that was going to be given to us by God would be the sword of the spirit the Holy Spirit which is the Dynamics the prophet would say I would live in one place he would say that on the day of Pentecost God equipped every man in the upper room with a weapon and that weapon was the Holy Spirit the Dynamics of the word is the very weapon that has been placed into the hands of the Bride of Jesus Christ to overcome the Ws of the enemy to over to overcome principalities to overcome the rules of Darkness Church we've got the king's weapon tonight we are not fighting with some Broken Sword we're not fighting with some brown sword we're not fighting with some weapon that might break or that we don't know will hold up but you are fighting with the king's weapon the same weapon The Same Spirit that Rose Christ from the dead that conquered Hell In The Grave that triumphed over Darkness the Triant over Satan that Quicken your mortal bodies is the same weapon now that's been placed into your hands brother Brandon would tell the story of David Livingstone the missionary in Africa and he would tell the story about how that he was led of God to witness to this tribe these tribes in Africa and he uh these tribes he he built a relationship with the King and he went through the tribal rituals and everything because all these tribes this nation there had all bunch of tribes within these nations and brother brandham would say he said they were Wicked they were they were very very just he said you would simply try to walk up to the village and they would just Slaughter you you like he said they they were constantly war with each other wor with everybody he said there was no getting to these people so he was able to go to the king of this nation and was able to build a relationship with this King and brother Brandon would talk about how he went through a tribal ritual and became Blood Brothers with him where they like you know they both cut their hand and they they they mixed the blood together and they they did that and they became blood blood brothers and it was a custom of that nation that when you become blood brothers that had to be in exchange and brother Bon would say the king would look at David Livingstone he would say I want the cat off of your back and I love this story because we know that a coat represents identification and so David Livingstone he took it off and he gave it to him and he said I want your spear that you carry he said I want the king's Spear and brother brandham would say that spear was a sacred weapon it was the king spirit and no matter how much the tribes would fight no matter how much the tribes they would clear kill and they would Slaughter each other they all knew the king's spear so David Livingstone he made the trade he gave the king his cult or he gave him his identity and in return the king gave him the king's weapon the king's Sword and the story goes that he went he witnessed Jesus Christ to all those tribes brother brandham would say because every time that he would come close to one of these tribes brother bam say he will go and he would travel and he will walk up to one of those tribes and he said they will come forth with their weapons the enemy will come out to killing and he said all he had to do oh was take the king's weapon and just raise it up he said all he had to do was raise the king's weapon he said those enemies would stop in their tracks they would drop their weapons and they'll back up why because brother Brenham said that they knew the king's weapon and they knew that if any man was carrying the king's weapon that meant I've got a message from the King and that there's nothing that you can do to hurt me I say tonight see y'all excuse me I've been finding this sickness I say now we've got the king's weapon we've got the power of God this king's weapon has been placed into our hands and every time he will go to that tribe they had no choice but to drop their weapon because once they saw the king's weapon they knew they were defeated they knew that they were over they knew that their time was done why because the king's weapon represented something I say you've been given a weapon tonight you've been given the king's weapon and it's not just any weapon it's not just any sword it's not just something that looks good oh but it is a weapon that has Authority it's a weapon that has power it is the word and the Dynamics of that word that's making it live oh I say we've got the King's weapon ton not oh we ain't walking around we ain't walking around with little slingshots we ain't walking around just with BB guns we ain't walking around just wondering if we're going to win oh but a weapon has been placed into your hands that is going to carry you all the way oh but my Propet stood in Sabino Canyon oh and that sword began to come from the sky and the prophet said he took a hold of that sword oh and what did this what did that voice say he didn't say it was a king sword that voice said it was the king sword the king's weapon was was placed into the hands of the Prophet messenger oh Hallelujah church and that weapon has now been given to the Bride of Jesus Christ I say we've got the king's weapon oh the Pentecostals think they've got it the Baptist think they've got it the denominations think they've got it oh but as my Prophet took a hold of that sword oh he didn't take it and look down at it and say oh my this fits Billy Graham's hand perfectly oh he didn't take that sword and go oh this fits oral Robert's hand perfectly oh no but that King's sword came and rested into the prophet's hands and he said that sword fit my hand perfectly the sword was made to fit the prophet's hand it was made for his hand oh church it was made to be brought this message was made to be brought forth by Malachi 4 it was made to be brought forth by William brandham and now this message this word this Dynamic weapon has been placed into your hands oh Hallelujah it it wasn't for them it's for you you have Dynamic Authority you have Dynamic power oh Hallelujah you've got the king's weapon amen hallelujah Romans 8:11 it would say but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you brother bam would say when you get the Dynamics you have been quickened from Mortal to immortality it makes the the whole body comes subject to the word it makes the whole body come subject to the word not part of the body oh but every aspect of your being is now subject to a higher power it'll make you act different look different live different it'll just make you different on down he said you need to close yourself in the upper room till the Dynamics come that's right it changed them it quickened them it made them different they were a changed people from then on it quickened them from an old life of being a coward to like the Lion of the tribe of Judah oh I like that it instilled a boldness on the inside of them he said it made them from being a coward to the lion of the tribe of Judah they absolutely faced martyrdom nailed to the crosses crucified upside down burnt throw it in the Lion's Den No More cowards about them death had no victory over them at all that wouldn't mean they didn't die that wouldn't mean that they wouldn't have to go and that they wouldn't be Marty that they wouldn't face death oh but he said death had no victory over them at all the Dynamics was in the mechanics and they Quicken their mortal body oh Hallelujah we see brother bandam going through this upper Rim experience and he would draw us to recognize that when the dynamic comes it completely annihilates any fear that was in your old life he would say in that portion again it Quicken them from a life of being a coward to like the lion of the tribe of Judah they absolutely face mome nailed to crosses crucified burnt thr in lines in no more cowards about them death had no victory over them at all death had no victory over them the lion Zen had no victory over them the fire furnace had no Victory oh the the fear had no Victory unbelief had no Victory why because when you were born you were born with a life that Satan can control you were born with a life where he can control your mind he can control your emotions he can control your thoughts he can control every aspect of your body oh but when the Dynamics oh begin to come into your life when the dynamic Stacks your soul all of a sudden a new life is quickened on the inside of you a new life is quickened a a life that Satan has no power over a life that Satan has no authority over he has no power over he can't control your mind anymore he can't control your thoughts anymore he can't control your actions anymore why because a new life has been quickened on the inside of you and that it can no longer be affected by him oh when the dynamic stries the heart of the child of God oh fear begins to melt away anxiety begins to melt away troubles begin to melt away your fight against your brother begins to melt away bitterness begins to melt away oh depression begins to melt away why because there is nothing that can stand against the dynamic power of Jesus Christ in the life of the Bride of Jesus Christ I say there is nothing that can stand against you tonight church I don't say that so that you'll get harder or you'll get prideful or you think you ain't got to fight oh but I'm telling you you have everything that you need to overcome this Dynamic power has been placed inside of you oh you carry the victory oh you Carri to overcoming don't make your pastor do it don't make the you ain't got to make the preacher do it brother bham didn't come to carry you to victory he came to give you a message so that you could speak the word brother bandam said you speak with authority you speak with power oh you speak the word oh hallelujah oh when that se begins to sprout forth it instills a boldness on the inside of you you can face criticism you can face martyr doome you could even face death you can face fear oh and it wouldn't face you why because when the Dynamics comes all fear is destroyed oh hallelujah hallelujah brother Brandon would say the predestinated ones are the first to be quickened by the holy spirit for the Holy Spirit comes to claim its own now this is deep now and be sure to catch this as the sun was sent across the Earth not to bring rocks which was which was dirt also to life it was not meant to bring all the dirt to life but it was meant to bring a part of that dirt which was enclosed around Al life oh not all men will receive Christ no but those which God for ordained for life is housed around some of the dirt of the earth and that is the one that he has come to Quicken oh they're the ones he said now that dirt will lay there in the Sun and would say oh this sun is so hot that rock would say this sun's so hot oh but that little seed said that's what I'm looking for oh that's what we're looking for tonight that light to come forth brother BR said it was the same light that shined on the Rock the same light that shine on the dirt oh but when it hit the seed that's what I'm looking for and it begin to sprout forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to Quicken The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but to Quicken the life of the seed oh quit listening to what The Rock has to say quit listening to what the dirt has to say the light was not sent for them this Dynamics was not sent for them but it was sent for you this power was sent for you to express this word was sent for you to express for you to manifest the last was sent to Quicken your body to Quicken your soul amen as they come to the music tonight I'll leave you with this brother Bron would say that's what he proved Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the word that made the body of Jesus CHR Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shake into life and rise again and roll away the stone he said I am he that was dead I love this so dead till the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead can we all agree that sounds pretty dead he said oh but now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again he's not only the mechanics God's word but he was the Dynamics to prove it now Jesus now now brother bandam he just went through and he just told you who Jesus was he just explained to you who he was he was the Dynamics the word and the spirit together and now he will continue in the next paragraph and now as he being the groom a PR has to come forth because it's a part of him see he had a reason for explaining who Jesus was he had a reason for explaining who God was why because he would now go on to explain the bride and the bride was a lot easier to explain you know why because he had already explained who the groom was and it's the same person he would say it's a part of him hold now it can only manifest if it does something different from the groom it isn't the bride she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power
