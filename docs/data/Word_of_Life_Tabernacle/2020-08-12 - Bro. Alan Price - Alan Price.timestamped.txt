[47:05] amen definitely appreciate the the song
[47:08] service and
[47:10] everyone being out on a wednesday night
[47:12] amen
[47:14] uh you know i was sitting back there and
[47:17] then you know you struggle
[47:18] you know brother ram says you know one
[47:19] of the hardest things that god would
[47:21] ever get to do is get one human
[47:23] human being to believe the another human
[47:25] being and
[47:26] you know just been praying and
[47:30] had a song on my heart to come out and
[47:32] sing and uh you know you just kind of
[47:34] battle with well
[47:35] you know i'm not good enough to minister
[47:36] you know just you begin to look at your
[47:38] faults and your failures just as you
[47:39] would come to church and
[47:41] you begin to look at your faults and
[47:42] failures and the song was keep on the
[47:44] firing line and that's what i was going
[47:45] to sing so
[47:46] just a confirmation you know that that
[47:48] god's going to you know do something
[47:49] tonight amen so
[47:51] we just thank the lord for that and it's
[47:54] always amazed me i know if you
[47:55] if you move yourself out of the way and
[47:57] let god lead you and if you'll follow
[47:59] what he lays on your heart he'll always
[48:00] make it
[48:01] make it for a purpose amen amen
[48:04] isaiah 41 and 10 will read this
[48:06] scripture and you can be seated
[48:07] it says fear thou not for i am with thee
[48:10] be not dismayed
[48:11] for i am thy god i will strengthen thee
[48:14] yeah
[48:14] i will help thee yea i will uphold thee
[48:17] with the right hand of my righteousness
[48:19] amen you can be seated tonight
[48:21] i'd like to speak this evening if i
[48:23] could and faith and
[48:25] faith in motion and you know we're all
[48:27] been all each individual person has been
[48:29] given a measure of faith is what the
[48:31] what the bible teaches what the prophet
[48:32] taught us and we see some have a greater
[48:34] measure of faith than others
[48:36] we see that we know that what jesus had
[48:38] in fullness we now have in measure
[48:40] you know brother branham said you know
[48:41] he had the complete ocean and he takes
[48:43] you get a spoonful out of the ocean you
[48:45] have all the
[48:45] all the same ingredients the entire
[48:47] ocean would have but you have it in
[48:49] in portion and so we see that that
[48:52] we've all been given a measure of faith
[48:54] and and i don't believe it as christians
[48:56] we're made to be stagnant we're not made
[48:57] to be still we're not made to sit still
[48:59] we're not made to sit on our hands
[49:00] but we're made to be in motion i believe
[49:02] that's the way god created us
[49:04] and so tonight i'd just like to speak on
[49:05] that just for a few moments
[49:07] i won't hold you very long but we'll go
[49:09] to romans 12 and verse
[49:11] verse 1 it says i beseech you therefore
[49:13] brethren by the mercies of god that you
[49:14] present yourself your body is a living
[49:16] sacrifice
[49:18] give me a second holy acceptable unto
[49:21] god which is your reasonable service so
[49:23] we see that it's our reasonable service
[49:25] to be a living sacrifice to god
[49:27] and what that that is as a sacrifice we
[49:30] must yield ourselves to what god wants
[49:32] us to do is that right
[49:33] so it says that's which is your
[49:34] reasonable service and be not conformed
[49:36] to this world but be
[49:37] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[49:40] that you may prove what is good and
[49:41] acceptable and the perfect will of god
[49:44] so there's something that we have to do
[49:46] and we have to prove
[49:48] that it is good and acceptable and a
[49:50] perfect will of god he says for i say
[49:52] through the grace given unto me to every
[49:54] man that is among you not to think of
[49:55] himself
[49:56] more highly than he ought to think but
[49:58] to think soberly according as god has
[50:00] dealt every man a measure of faith so we
[50:03] see that we're not to think that you
[50:04] know
[50:04] if we can do greater things than this
[50:06] one or or in our mind that
[50:08] maybe this minister can do this or
[50:10] preaches like much better than this
[50:11] minister
[50:12] we ought not to think highly more highly
[50:13] of ourselves or more highly of anyone
[50:15] else amen is that right christ should be
[50:17] the head of the body
[50:18] for as as we have many members in one
[50:20] body all members have not the same
[50:22] office so we being many
[50:25] are one body in christ and everyone
[50:27] remembers one of another
[50:29] so we see that you know we can't make it
[50:31] without the the ministry we can't make
[50:33] it without the
[50:34] the song leaders we can't make it
[50:35] without the lay members we can't make it
[50:37] without the prayer warriors we all play
[50:38] a part in the body
[50:40] of jesus christ is that right so we see
[50:42] here brother brahm says he says now this
[50:44] is where the thing comes in this morning
[50:45] we're going to talk about now he says
[50:46] all right
[50:47] a house he says the foundation is first
[50:50] he says what is the foundation of
[50:51] christianity
[50:53] he says faith in the word of god he says
[50:55] that is your foundation
[50:57] then you begin to grow then you start to
[50:59] begin to add to this foundation
[51:01] so we see first of all if you don't have
[51:03] faith in the word of god
[51:04] you cannot grow in any way that has to
[51:06] be your foundation
[51:08] and what the faith in the word of god
[51:09] means we take that word
[51:11] for what it says and for what it is in
[51:13] the scripture so when
[51:14] when when jesus says something in the
[51:16] scripture when god come down and
[51:18] and through the inspiration the holy
[51:19] ghost had had men pick up a pen and
[51:22] begin to write
[51:23] we know that that is the direct word of
[51:24] god we've got to have faith
[51:26] in that word of god is that right that
[51:28] when we when we begin to pray whenever
[51:30] we we begin to use the scripture and we
[51:31] begin to quote the scripture
[51:33] we've got to believe that god put that
[51:34] there and it's going to come to pass is
[51:36] that right
[51:38] now if you have if you don't have faith
[51:39] in something you know
[51:41] you've heard of the placebo effect in
[51:43] medicine you know
[51:44] telling people that this medicine will
[51:45] cure this disease and then give them a
[51:47] sugar pill
[51:48] and and nothing be nothing nothing no
[51:50] medicinal purpose
[51:51] in that pill but because their mindset
[51:53] is this pill will make them better they
[51:55] know that if they take it they'll get
[51:56] better is that right
[51:57] and as christians we ought to know that
[51:59] when we take the word of god it's going
[52:00] to come to pass
[52:02] we ought not to take the word of god and
[52:03] say it might happen or it could happen
[52:05] but it's going to happen is that right
[52:07] we have to have the mindset that god is
[52:09] going to do something
[52:11] whenever we put our faith into motion is
[52:13] that right
[52:14] and you know god doesn't like anything
[52:16] that's stagnant you know we
[52:17] in in today's world it's really good to
[52:20] have something stable
[52:21] you want a stable you want a stable you
[52:24] want stable finances you want a stable
[52:26] relationship you want a stable family
[52:27] you want to stable this or
[52:29] you want a stable car you want a stable
[52:30] job and and that's okay to have
[52:33] something that's stable but
[52:34] but god doesn't want us just to come and
[52:36] just be repetitive and just come and sit
[52:38] in a pew and sit in a pew and stay in
[52:39] the same position with god
[52:41] he wants us to move further is that
[52:43] right paul says this is a race that we
[52:45] must win and we've got to run all the
[52:46] way through to the finish line is that
[52:48] right
[52:49] so i want to look here at ruth just just
[52:50] for a few moments and
[52:52] just kind of like kind of lay a
[52:53] foundation and last night i was laying
[52:55] in bed and i actually
[52:56] preached on this about four about two or
[52:59] three years ago and
[53:00] i just couldn't get away from those four
[53:02] lepers that set at the gate and
[53:03] and so just kind of want to go back
[53:05] through this if i can and
[53:06] pray it's a blessing to someone i i
[53:08] don't know who it's for but maybe it's
[53:10] for me tonight but i pray god will speak
[53:12] to us but
[53:12] and so ruth 1 and verse 6 and and if
[53:15] you've already heard this i'm sorry but
[53:16] maybe you need to hear it again amen
[53:19] then she arose with her daughters-in-law
[53:21] that she might return from the country
[53:22] of moab for she had heard in the country
[53:24] of
[53:24] moab how the lord had visited his people
[53:27] and giving them bread
[53:28] now we know the story of ruth we know
[53:30] the story of orpah and we know
[53:32] the story of naomi and how her husbands
[53:34] had died her sons had died and she was
[53:36] there now widowed
[53:37] with her two widowed daughter-in-laws
[53:39] and we see that she had heard that back
[53:41] in her hometown or back in her homeland
[53:43] the lord had visited the people giving
[53:44] them bread and verse seven wherefore she
[53:46] went forth out of the place where she
[53:48] was her two daughters-in-law with her
[53:50] and they went out of the way to return
[53:52] unto the land of judah
[53:53] so we see they're all headed in the same
[53:55] place they're following this message of
[53:57] naomi
[53:57] because the orba and ruth had never been
[53:59] to this land
[54:01] but they were following the message of
[54:02] naomi at this time and naomi said under
[54:04] her two daughters-in-law go return each
[54:05] to her mother's house
[54:07] and the lord dealt kindly with you as
[54:08] you have dealt with the dead and with me
[54:10] and the lord grant you that you may find
[54:12] rest each of you in the house of her
[54:13] husband then she kissed them
[54:15] and lifted up her voice and wept so
[54:17] she's giving him her blessing to stay
[54:19] she's saying the lord grant you a
[54:20] husband here
[54:21] he'll grant you rest why don't you just
[54:22] stay and i'll go back to my homeland
[54:24] this is where i'm called to be and and
[54:26] so you know and they said unto her
[54:28] surely we will return with thee unto thy
[54:30] people
[54:30] and they wanted to you know you can see
[54:32] that they had a desire in her heart you
[54:34] know naomi had him put an impression on
[54:36] them that they wanted to see
[54:37] where where naomi had come from they had
[54:39] an impression from her that they wanted
[54:40] to go to where naomi was going
[54:43] nomi said again turn again my daughters
[54:45] why will thou go with me
[54:47] she said are there yet any more sons in
[54:48] my womb that yet that they may be your
[54:50] husbands
[54:50] she said turn again my daughters and go
[54:52] your way for i am too old to have a
[54:54] husband
[54:55] if i should say i have hope if i should
[54:57] find a husband also tonight and should
[54:58] bear sons
[54:59] would you tarry for them until they were
[55:01] grown would you stay for them from
[55:03] having husbands
[55:04] she said name my daughters if you agree
[55:06] with me much for your sakes at the hand
[55:08] of the lord has gone out against me
[55:09] so and and you go on down to verse 14
[55:12] and you see that they lifted up their
[55:13] voice and wept again and orbit kissed
[55:14] her mother-in-law
[55:16] but ruth clave unto her so we see that
[55:18] orpha had something she but she but she
[55:19] couldn't go
[55:20] just all the way is that right she she
[55:22] could have she she hung on for as long
[55:24] as she could but when it got really
[55:26] difficult when it got down to
[55:27] the challenging time she just couldn't
[55:29] do it and she had to go back is that
[55:31] right
[55:32] but but ruth claven to her because ruth
[55:34] had a desire to see where naomi had come
[55:36] from she had a desire to see
[55:38] this message that naomi was talking
[55:39] about the bread and the homeland she
[55:41] wanted to get to that
[55:42] she said behold thy sister-in-law has
[55:44] gone back under her people and under her
[55:45] gods
[55:46] return thou after thy sister in law
[55:49] and ruth said entreat me not to leave
[55:51] thee nor to return from following after
[55:53] thee for whither thou goest i will go
[55:55] and where thou love just i will lodge
[55:57] thy people shall be my people and thy
[55:59] god be my god
[56:00] or thou diest will i die and there will
[56:03] i be buried and lord do so to me and
[56:05] more also if ought but death part
[56:07] thee and me and you see as a christian
[56:09] all each of us have to come to this
[56:11] point where there's no turning back is
[56:12] that right
[56:13] when we get to a point where we say it
[56:14] doesn't matter how many times i've
[56:16] failed doesn't matter how many times i
[56:17] falter
[56:18] it doesn't matter what people say about
[56:19] me i'm going through to the end is that
[56:21] right
[56:21] and as christians and believers of like
[56:23] precious faith we've got to come to that
[56:25] point doesn't matter who falls away who
[56:27] turns away
[56:28] what comes against us we're going
[56:29] through to the end is that right
[56:31] amen you love the lord this evening as
[56:33] christians we've got to come to a
[56:35] a a mindset and a stability in our lives
[56:38] that says hey
[56:39] no fathered mother friend anybody desert
[56:41] us we will go through to the end because
[56:43] it's christ
[56:44] that is leading us through to the end
[56:46] it's not we're not worried about what
[56:47] this one does or what that one does but
[56:48] it's
[56:49] christ is our hope of glory is that
[56:50] right now brother branham says in the
[56:52] ephesian church ages
[56:54] in the exposition of the seven church
[56:55] ages he says and now these sons of god
[56:57] he said whom by him overcome
[56:59] are given the privilege of the paradise
[57:01] of god the constant fellowship with
[57:03] jesus christ
[57:04] he said there will never be any more
[57:06] separation from him are you looking
[57:07] forward to that day
[57:09] he says whether he goes his bride will
[57:11] go i want you to know where christ
[57:13] leads you the bride will follow is that
[57:14] right you know some men say he's here
[57:16] he's there but where the word is that's
[57:18] where the eagles will be gathered is
[57:19] that right
[57:20] he said his bride will go he says what
[57:22] is it he shares with his beloved
[57:24] on a joint air relationship and i i love
[57:26] that
[57:27] we did nothing to deserve it but there's
[57:28] a joint heir relationship that
[57:30] everything christ
[57:31] died for everything that he was entitled
[57:33] to you and i now have is that right
[57:36] when jen and i got married you know
[57:37] everything that i had which wasn't very
[57:39] much
[57:39] she got and everything she had i got is
[57:42] that right
[57:42] and so we see when you come into a
[57:44] relationship with christ all the
[57:45] redemptive blessings that he was
[57:46] entitled to
[57:47] you are now entitled to and he says the
[57:51] secret things
[57:51] will be revealed the dark things will be
[57:53] made plain we shall know as we are known
[57:55] and he says we shall be like him he said
[57:57] this is the heritage of the overcomer
[57:59] who was overcome by the blood of the
[58:00] lamb and the word of the testimony to
[58:02] jesus christ
[58:03] i love how brother ben he talked about
[58:05] that you know it's not you know we
[58:06] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[58:07] the word of our testimony
[58:09] it's not the blood of the lamb that's
[58:10] going to fail it's going to be the word
[58:11] of our testimony is that right
[58:13] so we have to make sure that word of our
[58:14] testimony stays true
[58:17] he says how we long for the day when the
[58:19] crooked roads will be made straight and
[58:20] we'll be with him in time without end
[58:23] he said may that day hasten he said it
[58:25] its appearance and we may hasten to obey
[58:27] the word of god
[58:28] to thereby prove our worthiness to share
[58:30] his glory and i love that that sentence
[58:32] there
[58:32] let us hasten to obey his word i mean
[58:35] you know it's it's not
[58:36] it's not the something that you would
[58:38] say norman ordinarily but
[58:40] you know if we were to pray you know god
[58:41] hey you know make me make my desire to
[58:44] obey your word make it
[58:45] make it something that's important in my
[58:47] life that when i wake up that's what i
[58:48] want to think about is obeying your word
[58:50] he said and prove our worthiness to
[58:52] share his glory he says he that hath an
[58:54] ear let him hear
[58:54] this what the spirit says unto the
[58:56] churches he said how tragic is it the
[58:58] first age did not listen to the spirit
[59:00] instead it listened to man he said but
[59:02] thank god in the last age there will be
[59:04] a group rise up the true
[59:06] bride in the last day and she will
[59:07] listen to the spirit
[59:09] in the day of gross darkness in the
[59:10] light he said the light will return
[59:12] by the pure word and we will return to
[59:14] the power of pentecost and welcome back
[59:16] the lord jesus christ
[59:18] i believe we're living in that day do
[59:19] you believe that you know matt no matter
[59:22] what the word says
[59:23] or what the world says or what what
[59:25] denominations say or mainstream media or
[59:27] mainstream religion
[59:28] amen we still serve a living god is that
[59:30] right you know
[59:32] you see nowadays everybody's changing
[59:34] changing the scripture to fit their
[59:35] religion but brother brahm says we ought
[59:37] to change ourselves to fit the scripture
[59:39] is that right
[59:39] we don't come into this relationship and
[59:41] say i'm going to change the word of god
[59:43] to fit my lifestyle but god changed my
[59:45] lifestyle to fit your word is that right
[59:47] amen it doesn't matter what the baptist
[59:49] preached the pentecostal preached the
[59:50] methodist preacher it doesn't matter
[59:51] what
[59:52] the message people preach if it doesn't
[59:53] align with the word of god it's in error
[59:55] is that right it's wrong
[59:57] it doesn't matter what gods they say
[59:58] they serve it doesn't matter what
[1:00:00] what what religion they believe but if
[1:00:02] if you believe in god you believe in the
[1:00:04] word
[1:00:04] he's going to remain your god until the
[1:00:06] end is that right
[1:00:08] amen i heard a song the other day and
[1:00:09] that's what i was really studying on and
[1:00:11] wanting to preach on it was called still
[1:00:12] my god
[1:00:13] and so you see in in today's time
[1:00:15] they've taken god they've watered them
[1:00:17] down they've changed the scripture they
[1:00:19] they they don't live according to the
[1:00:20] bible but but i want you to know that
[1:00:22] he's still my god is that right
[1:00:24] so what he said in the beginning the way
[1:00:25] he was the alpha and omega that's the
[1:00:27] god that i
[1:00:28] still believe in amen and when god has
[1:00:30] selected you it doesn't matter who else
[1:00:32] has rejected you god's favor outweighs
[1:00:34] all
[1:00:34] opposition so we see that ruth she had
[1:00:37] faith to believe in what she was doing
[1:00:39] she wasn't going to turn back is that
[1:00:40] right
[1:00:41] you look at jacob in the scripture and i
[1:00:43] love it you know he wasn't changed
[1:00:45] when he was wrestling but he was changed
[1:00:47] when he was touched amen
[1:00:49] he had wrestled all night and nothing
[1:00:50] had happened but that one touch come and
[1:00:52] it changed his life forever
[1:00:54] you can wrestle you can fight you can
[1:00:56] try to do good enough you can try to do
[1:00:57] this you can try to do that but until
[1:00:59] god comes down and touches you
[1:01:00] with that holy touch you will not make
[1:01:02] it through to the end
[1:01:04] ruth 1-18 when she saw that she was
[1:01:06] steadfastly minded to go with her
[1:01:08] she left then speaking unto her see she
[1:01:10] was looking for
[1:01:11] she was trying to get ruth to say she
[1:01:13] was trying to shake her off she was
[1:01:14] trying to get her to stay in her
[1:01:15] homeland
[1:01:16] but when she finally realized that she
[1:01:17] was steadfastly going she would just
[1:01:19] finally give up and said come with me
[1:01:21] and i believe as christians that's the
[1:01:22] way we ought to be the scripture says
[1:01:24] every child every son and daughter of
[1:01:25] god
[1:01:26] that comes to god must be tried and must
[1:01:29] be chastened
[1:01:30] and i believe as christians we ought not
[1:01:31] to to look at that and say it's it's
[1:01:33] you know it's it's the devil ganging up
[1:01:35] on us or god doesn't care about us it's
[1:01:36] god trying as children
[1:01:38] amen and i i nobody wants to pray for
[1:01:40] patience nobody wants to pray for trials
[1:01:42] or tribulations but that's the only way
[1:01:44] god can perfect the gold amen
[1:01:46] we see that ruth loved naomi but we see
[1:01:49] they would have been in the same
[1:01:50] condition in bethlehem as they were in
[1:01:52] mohab
[1:01:52] moab without boaz is that right the
[1:01:54] reason they were going was to get boaz
[1:01:56] they weren't going into land for bread
[1:01:58] but there was a kinsmen redeemer that
[1:01:59] was there
[1:02:00] you don't just come to church for the
[1:02:02] gifts of the spirit or the anointing or
[1:02:03] this or that
[1:02:04] but you go because you have a desire to
[1:02:06] meet christ is that right
[1:02:08] amen i don't know about you but i'm not
[1:02:11] going to heaven just to get to heaven or
[1:02:12] live eternal life but i want to meet the
[1:02:14] bridegroom is that right there's a love
[1:02:15] connection there's a deep call it to the
[1:02:17] deep
[1:02:18] now i've mentioned this many times
[1:02:19] before but there's a there's a a
[1:02:22] a terminology in in aviation where it's
[1:02:24] called the point of no return
[1:02:26] it's often returned to referred to as by
[1:02:28] pilots as the radius of action formula
[1:02:31] i've mentioned this many times but what
[1:02:32] it is is once a plane has left an
[1:02:34] airfield
[1:02:35] due to fuel consumption the plane is no
[1:02:37] longer capable of returning
[1:02:39] to the airfield it took off from so we
[1:02:41] see that it's reached a point of no
[1:02:43] return
[1:02:44] it means it can't go back if it wanted
[1:02:45] to it has to move forward and i believe
[1:02:48] as christians today you know the holy
[1:02:50] ghost has sealed us until the day of our
[1:02:51] redemption
[1:02:52] it's not that god is just enough to get
[1:02:54] us there he's more than enough to see us
[1:02:56] through
[1:02:56] but as christians we've reached a point
[1:02:58] of no return when you're still with the
[1:03:00] holy ghost there's no turning back
[1:03:02] it's you only look to the finish line
[1:03:03] and you have to make it to the finish
[1:03:05] line
[1:03:06] it's a desire in every believer's heart
[1:03:09] amen so we see this point of no return i
[1:03:11] don't know about you but i've reached
[1:03:12] that point of no return it doesn't
[1:03:13] matter what happens
[1:03:14] doesn't matter what comes up against me
[1:03:16] doesn't matter if i fall tomorrow i'll
[1:03:17] get back up and keep pressing the battle
[1:03:19] amen
[1:03:20] satan can try to throw his punches but i
[1:03:22] believe if we put on the full armor of
[1:03:24] god god will protect
[1:03:25] us so and we go to john chapter 6 and
[1:03:28] verse 67 i know i'm skipping around but
[1:03:30] i'm laying a foundation here then jesus
[1:03:32] said unto the 12 will ye
[1:03:33] also go away and i love this simon peter
[1:03:36] answered and said lord
[1:03:37] lord to whom shall we go thou hast the
[1:03:40] words of eternal life
[1:03:41] and i know as christians once you find
[1:03:43] those words of eternal life nothing else
[1:03:45] will satisfy
[1:03:46] you can try to go back to the baptist
[1:03:47] you can try to go back to the pentecost
[1:03:49] but once you've met the unadulterated
[1:03:51] word of god
[1:03:52] nothing else will suffice until unless
[1:03:54] you have that
[1:03:55] john 6 and 69 he says we believe and are
[1:03:58] sure that thou art the christ the son of
[1:04:00] the living god
[1:04:01] how many of you are sure tonight that
[1:04:02] you've met christ the son of the living
[1:04:04] god
[1:04:04] i believe as christians it's not it's
[1:04:06] not a it's not maybe a
[1:04:08] a thing that we have to do but but we've
[1:04:10] got to come to a point
[1:04:12] in our life where we've got to drive a
[1:04:13] stake down and say that no matter what
[1:04:15] comes my way i'm going to go with the
[1:04:16] lord
[1:04:17] now many times in our life we may not be
[1:04:20] able to put down a specific date or a
[1:04:22] specific time and
[1:04:23] but there's always a tie post that we
[1:04:25] can go back to is that right there's a
[1:04:27] time that we know that god
[1:04:28] changed something in our lives and i
[1:04:30] don't know about you my change when
[1:04:31] you know when i was filled with the holy
[1:04:32] ghost yes it was it was
[1:04:34] it was an indwelling of the holy ghost
[1:04:36] but i didn't become perfect the next day
[1:04:39] it wasn't something that just everything
[1:04:40] fixed and everything was a flower bed of
[1:04:42] ease but it was a challenge from then on
[1:04:44] to live the christian life is that right
[1:04:46] god began to work on me things begin to
[1:04:48] fall away and then
[1:04:49] and i begin to begin to learn more in
[1:04:51] the word and it's it's
[1:04:52] it's a it's a journey that you go
[1:04:55] through with christ is that right
[1:04:57] now brother branham says he says what is
[1:04:58] sin he says simply he said it's one word
[1:05:00] it says unbelief
[1:05:02] he said there are two elements that
[1:05:03] control the human being and that's
[1:05:05] either doubt or faith he says one or the
[1:05:06] other
[1:05:07] he said you're possessed by one that
[1:05:09] dominates your life he said it just
[1:05:10] depends on how much faith you got
[1:05:12] to how high you can rise so we've seen
[1:05:15] that no matter how bad the world gets we
[1:05:16] know the bride is rising is that right
[1:05:18] she's on her way out
[1:05:20] now i love that and i i i i love to
[1:05:23] study on faith and it's one of my
[1:05:24] favorite topics and
[1:05:26] and and i believe it it works just as
[1:05:27] much in the natural as it does in the
[1:05:29] spiritual i believe if you have faith
[1:05:30] god will meet his word is that right
[1:05:32] that's one thing i'm very sure on i know
[1:05:34] many times i've asked god to do
[1:05:36] something and i stood on that word and
[1:05:37] god come and did it is that right
[1:05:39] so we see you know i i did a test one
[1:05:42] time and i think i've told you all this
[1:05:43] here before but
[1:05:44] i want you to maybe this week go up to
[1:05:46] somebody and tell them just tell them
[1:05:47] you had the best week
[1:05:49] just say i had the best week and then
[1:05:52] say except for wednesday
[1:05:55] now the first question most people try
[1:05:57] this out i've done it to about 10 to 20
[1:05:58] people and every time
[1:06:00] no one's going to ask you why monday
[1:06:02] sunday
[1:06:03] tuesday thursday friday and saturday
[1:06:05] we're good they're going to say why was
[1:06:06] wednesday bad
[1:06:09] guarantee it ask ask 9 out of 10 people
[1:06:12] will say well what happened wednesday
[1:06:15] we're naturally you know we're naturally
[1:06:19] negative we're naturally drawn to ask
[1:06:21] what's wrong
[1:06:22] right and instead of what's right and so
[1:06:25] i've been
[1:06:26] just working for years trying to change
[1:06:28] my mindset
[1:06:29] to ask the positive and there's some
[1:06:32] people who want you to ask the negative
[1:06:34] i'll have people come up to you and just
[1:06:35] say i'm like how are you doing
[1:06:37] good accept and then there's a long list
[1:06:40] of things of except behind it
[1:06:42] and people like to be baby people like
[1:06:44] to be pampered people like to be patted
[1:06:46] on the back no matter how good or bad
[1:06:48] you are you like a little uh
[1:06:49] you like a little accolades you like to
[1:06:51] be patted on the back but i promise you
[1:06:53] if we could get our mindset to quit
[1:06:55] focusing on the negative and focus on
[1:06:57] the positive god could work a lot more
[1:06:59] in our lives is that
[1:07:00] right when we begin to we begin to take
[1:07:02] doubt and we begin to put it aside and
[1:07:03] replace it with faith there's no way but
[1:07:05] god to have a greater outcome in our
[1:07:07] life
[1:07:08] you know it's almost like math you know
[1:07:09] you take one plus one equals two
[1:07:12] right you start adding more numbers to
[1:07:14] it more numbers to it it's going to get
[1:07:15] greater
[1:07:16] now that's the thing about people
[1:07:17] everybody thinks you got to do the same
[1:07:19] thing as somebody else
[1:07:20] that's not the way it works you know
[1:07:21] that was sister how do you see that so
[1:07:23] many people have tried the same thing
[1:07:24] that she did
[1:07:25] is that right so many people tried the
[1:07:27] same exact formula saying the exact same
[1:07:29] words
[1:07:29] that she did but that doesn't always
[1:07:31] work for everybody
[1:07:32] right five plus four equals nine but so
[1:07:34] does six plus three
[1:07:36] right there's different things for
[1:07:37] different people there's different faith
[1:07:40] each of us are given a different measure
[1:07:41] of faith and it may take this person you
[1:07:43] know i can't say
[1:07:44] i can't go to my wife and say well why
[1:07:45] can't you believe this it's so easy for
[1:07:46] me to believe and she can't come to me
[1:07:48] and say why don't you see this it's so
[1:07:49] easy for me to see
[1:07:51] everybody learns at their own pace
[1:07:53] everybody has a measure of faith that's
[1:07:54] attributed to them and you've got to
[1:07:56] you can't force your amount on them
[1:07:57] they've got to come to it themselves
[1:07:59] is that right but one thing that i know
[1:08:01] for sure we've all been given different
[1:08:02] measures but when we get doubt out of
[1:08:04] the way
[1:08:05] when we get unbelief out of the way and
[1:08:06] faith begins to step in
[1:08:08] great miracles can happen in your life
[1:08:10] and so we look here and i'd like to go
[1:08:12] to second kings now
[1:08:14] if we could and remember brother branham
[1:08:16] says what is sin
[1:08:17] and just always remember they said it's
[1:08:19] unbelief he said there's only two
[1:08:21] elements that controls the human being
[1:08:23] that's either doubt or faith one or the
[1:08:24] other
[1:08:25] you're possessed of one that dominates
[1:08:27] your life now that's words from a
[1:08:29] prophet so you're either
[1:08:30] you're either dominated by doubt or
[1:08:31] you're dominated by faith
[1:08:33] it just depends on how much faith you
[1:08:35] have as to how high you will fly
[1:08:38] now you got to take that what he says
[1:08:40] right there it doesn't mean you need
[1:08:41] more measure of faith
[1:08:43] it means you need to get rid of the
[1:08:44] doubt is that right we've all been given
[1:08:46] a specific measure of faith now
[1:08:48] the satan will give you as much doubt as
[1:08:50] you want satan will give you as much
[1:08:52] negativity as you want if you look at
[1:08:53] anything in the news anything in the
[1:08:55] media the only thing that sells is fear
[1:08:57] is that right that's the only thing if
[1:08:59] it's not fearful if it's not bad news
[1:09:01] nobody wants to put it out
[1:09:03] everybody's going to go through and
[1:09:04] click the bad news the bad news the bad
[1:09:06] news nobody's going to click you know
[1:09:08] man saves child from falling off cliff
[1:09:10] they're going to pick you know
[1:09:11] officer shot officer did this or you
[1:09:13] know race they're going to do all this
[1:09:15] anything that's negative that's what
[1:09:16] they're going to sell
[1:09:17] but as christians we ought to get rid of
[1:09:19] that doubt and replace it with faith is
[1:09:21] that right
[1:09:22] now that's not something that you can
[1:09:24] just say and leave here tonight and just
[1:09:25] tomorrow just this
[1:09:27] you can move mountains that's not the
[1:09:28] way it is
[1:09:30] but god will work it through you he's
[1:09:32] working to perfect his saints is that
[1:09:34] right
[1:09:35] so it's the it's day by day its
[1:09:37] footsteps are possessions it's each day
[1:09:39] you get closer to the promised land
[1:09:41] you know when the children of israel got
[1:09:42] to the promised land there was only a
[1:09:43] few that were actually ready to go over
[1:09:45] and that was joshua and caleb the rest
[1:09:47] had not reached that level of faith is
[1:09:48] that right and you know your husband
[1:09:50] your wife your son your daughter your
[1:09:52] family member may not be at the level of
[1:09:54] faith you are
[1:09:55] that doesn't mean they're any lower than
[1:09:56] you or any worse off than you as long as
[1:09:58] they're trying to get
[1:09:59] to the finish line that's the main thing
[1:10:02] second kings verse seven and three and i
[1:10:04] just love this story because i think it
[1:10:06] just play
[1:10:06] it it typifies every christian life and
[1:10:09] and every christian situation and there
[1:10:11] were four leperous men
[1:10:12] at the entering of the gate and they
[1:10:14] said one another why sit here until
[1:10:16] we die and i think as christians you've
[1:10:18] got to come to a point
[1:10:19] where you're not happy with your current
[1:10:21] state is that right
[1:10:23] he said now notice these men were at a
[1:10:25] gate they weren't in
[1:10:26] or out they were at the gate they were
[1:10:28] in the city or out of the city they were
[1:10:30] right in the gate they were a decision
[1:10:31] place
[1:10:32] is that right and the leper said if we
[1:10:34] say we will enter the city then the
[1:10:36] famine is in the city and we shall die
[1:10:38] there
[1:10:38] so they say if we go this way we're
[1:10:40] going to die right
[1:10:42] so then they look at one another they
[1:10:43] say well if we sit here we die also
[1:10:46] so it's pretty gloomy looking stuff you
[1:10:48] know if we go into the city we're gonna
[1:10:50] die if we stay here we're gonna die
[1:10:52] and many people that you know tonight if
[1:10:53] you look at your own life and
[1:10:55] and you look well if i do this death is
[1:10:57] down that road
[1:10:58] if i stay stagnant where i'm at if i
[1:11:01] don't want to go any further with god
[1:11:02] you will die right there in your pew
[1:11:04] he says now therefore come and let us
[1:11:06] fall
[1:11:08] into the host of the syrians if they
[1:11:10] save us alive we shall
[1:11:12] live if they kill us we shall but die so
[1:11:14] the syrians had
[1:11:15] had besieged the city and we see that
[1:11:17] inside the city if you read the
[1:11:19] scripture they were actually
[1:11:20] they were actually eating children and
[1:11:22] and doing all these horrible things that
[1:11:24] they were they were doing just because
[1:11:25] they were starving to death
[1:11:26] and so we see that they looked in there
[1:11:28] and they said there's nothing but death
[1:11:29] there
[1:11:30] if we stay here there's nothing but
[1:11:31] death here and so they said well let's
[1:11:33] go to the syrians
[1:11:35] if they save us alive maybe they'll feel
[1:11:36] bad for us give us some food they'll
[1:11:38] save us alive and we can live
[1:11:40] but if they kill us we're going to die
[1:11:42] anyways right
[1:11:43] and i believe as christians we've kind
[1:11:45] of got to come to that point
[1:11:47] where like if i stand you've got to come
[1:11:48] to a realization that if i stay in this
[1:11:50] current condition
[1:11:51] i'm going to die and now i'm not saying
[1:11:54] your soul is going to be lost i'm not
[1:11:56] going to say any of that but but i want
[1:11:57] you to look at your life and say you
[1:11:59] know if i continue with all this doubt
[1:12:01] you know you know as as i look and as i
[1:12:04] begin to study faith and
[1:12:06] and study doubt and the negative effects
[1:12:08] that that stress has on the body and
[1:12:10] and you know you begin to look at faith
[1:12:12] and you begin to wonder why wouldn't we
[1:12:13] just choose
[1:12:14] happiness right but but how often are we
[1:12:17] torn with choosing the negative side
[1:12:19] choosing the sadness choosing the bad
[1:12:21] way
[1:12:21] you know if you're you're my your mind
[1:12:23] begins to wonder and you get angry
[1:12:24] and then all sudden you're angry over
[1:12:26] something that has never happened you
[1:12:27] create a scenario in your head that has
[1:12:28] never happened
[1:12:29] you get mad about it and that puts
[1:12:31] stress on the body stress on the mind
[1:12:33] so we see if we stay in this current
[1:12:35] condition we're going to die if we go
[1:12:37] back into the city where there's more
[1:12:38] death
[1:12:39] if we go back out into the world where
[1:12:40] there's more death we're going to die
[1:12:41] there as well
[1:12:42] but we could go and fight the enemy and
[1:12:44] there's a chance that if we go to the
[1:12:46] enemy
[1:12:47] and we go to the enemy's camp we're
[1:12:48] either going to get back what they took
[1:12:49] from us or we're going to die
[1:12:51] i don't know about you but if i'm given
[1:12:52] the option to just sit here and die go
[1:12:54] somewhere and die or fight for a chance
[1:12:56] i'm going to take that chance
[1:12:57] every time man what a position to be in
[1:13:00] but we see that gideon was in a similar
[1:13:02] position is that right
[1:13:03] and i'm just going to go to the story
[1:13:04] just to get in just for a few moments
[1:13:06] but
[1:13:06] we've seen the the the that israel had
[1:13:09] been besieged by the midianites and
[1:13:11] and we see that in judges six and three
[1:13:12] and so it was when israel had sown
[1:13:14] and i love that when they were in the
[1:13:16] time that they had sown they
[1:13:18] had planted they had they had um as you
[1:13:20] hear the scripture says you reap what
[1:13:21] you sow
[1:13:22] well israel had sown and they were going
[1:13:24] to reap the fruits of their labor is
[1:13:26] that right
[1:13:27] but the enemy you look at anything that
[1:13:29] you do in your life the enemy comes in
[1:13:30] after you've done all the work
[1:13:32] that's the way the enemy likes to do you
[1:13:33] do all the work that any enemy likes to
[1:13:35] come in and take
[1:13:36] still kill and destroy is that right now
[1:13:38] that the midianites came up and the amla
[1:13:40] kites and the children of the east
[1:13:41] even come up against them and they
[1:13:43] encamped against them and destroyed the
[1:13:45] increase of the earth
[1:13:46] he says till thou come to gaza and left
[1:13:48] no sustenance for israel neither sheep
[1:13:50] nor ox nor ass
[1:13:51] for they came up with their cattle and
[1:13:53] their tents and they come as
[1:13:54] grasshoppers for the multitude for both
[1:13:56] they and their camels were without
[1:13:57] numbered
[1:13:58] and they entered into the land for what
[1:14:00] purpose to destroy it
[1:14:02] and the israel was greatly impoverished
[1:14:04] because of the midianites and the
[1:14:05] children of israel cried unto the lord
[1:14:08] and so we see that when they begin to
[1:14:09] cry to the lord we know obviously god
[1:14:11] goes and speaks to gideon but notice
[1:14:12] that these people they entered the land
[1:14:15] for one purpose and that was to destroy
[1:14:16] it
[1:14:18] and that's the way the devil is he likes
[1:14:19] to come in a little bit at a time but
[1:14:21] when you let him in
[1:14:22] he's only there for one purpose and
[1:14:23] that's to destroy it and i'm going to go
[1:14:25] ahead and tell you if you allow doubt to
[1:14:26] come into your life the only purpose
[1:14:28] that's there for is destroy your faith
[1:14:30] you're controlled by two things faith or
[1:14:32] doubt and depends on which one you
[1:14:33] choose to serve
[1:14:34] as brother branhammy talks about the
[1:14:36] black dog and the white dog whichever
[1:14:37] one you feed the most that's whichever
[1:14:39] one is going to rule you is that right
[1:14:41] do you love the lord this evening amen
[1:14:44] so we see that when israel had sown the
[1:14:45] many nights come up against them
[1:14:47] and we see that god began to raise up
[1:14:49] gideon is that right
[1:14:50] and he come to a point and gideon was
[1:14:52] very nervous he you know he didn't want
[1:14:53] to do what god was asking him to do so
[1:14:54] he wanted a sign then he wanted a sign
[1:14:56] but god said hey tear down the altar of
[1:14:58] bell cut down the trees of the grove
[1:15:00] and he said and said i will bless you
[1:15:02] and play a place of sacrifice unto god
[1:15:04] and so we see that that's what gideon
[1:15:05] does and and you know
[1:15:07] then gideon all of a sudden gets with
[1:15:09] god and he begins to get at this great
[1:15:11] army to go down and god says this is too
[1:15:13] many
[1:15:13] so he begins to lower the number then he
[1:15:15] gets down to ten thousand god says this
[1:15:17] is still too many
[1:15:18] and these were ten thousand people who
[1:15:19] wanted to fight you know at the first he
[1:15:22] said hey there's a bunch of you who
[1:15:23] don't want to be here
[1:15:24] if you're afraid if you're feel full go
[1:15:25] back to your house ten thousand were
[1:15:27] left that said hey i want to fight
[1:15:29] and then god comes out he says only the
[1:15:30] ones who drink this certain way only
[1:15:32] ones who come to the water this certain
[1:15:33] way that's the one that's going to fight
[1:15:34] it comes down to 300 men
[1:15:36] and we see that what god does is a
[1:15:37] miracle because god didn't want to share
[1:15:39] his glory with anyone is that right
[1:15:41] i want you to know no matter what
[1:15:42] happens in my life no matter how good
[1:15:44] god's blessed me i want you to know it's
[1:15:45] only because of him that i'm blessed
[1:15:47] is that right the minute we begin to
[1:15:48] think highly of ourselves that's the
[1:15:50] minute god's going to have to take us
[1:15:51] down
[1:15:51] a notch because the only reason that you
[1:15:53] and i are in any position that we're in
[1:15:55] is because god allowed us to be in that
[1:15:56] position amen
[1:15:58] amen if you've got a lot of money if
[1:15:59] you've got a lot of health in your life
[1:16:01] there's only one reason that you have
[1:16:02] that it's because god allowed you to
[1:16:03] have it amen
[1:16:04] and you ought to be thankful to him not
[1:16:06] in day that he allowed you to be in that
[1:16:07] position
[1:16:08] so we see in second kings 7 5 and they
[1:16:10] rose up at the twilight to go into the
[1:16:12] camp of the syrians
[1:16:13] and when they come to the uttermost part
[1:16:15] of the campus syria and behold there was
[1:16:17] no man there
[1:16:18] he said verse 6 says for the lord had
[1:16:20] made the host of the syrians to hear a
[1:16:22] noise of chariots
[1:16:23] and the noise of horses and even a noise
[1:16:25] of a great host and they said one
[1:16:27] another lo the king of israel hath hired
[1:16:29] against us the kings of the hittites
[1:16:31] and the egyptians to come upon us
[1:16:33] wherefore they arose and fled in the
[1:16:34] twilight and left their tents and their
[1:16:36] horses their asses
[1:16:37] and the campus as it was as they fled
[1:16:39] for their life
[1:16:40] so we see the story of the four lepers
[1:16:43] brother branham calls it dingy faith
[1:16:45] he says they took their dingy faith and
[1:16:47] destroyed an entire army and the camp
[1:16:49] was left as it was
[1:16:50] now you see if if christians if you can
[1:16:52] take that little amount of faith
[1:16:54] imagine what you can do in your life if
[1:16:56] you say i'm going to take this faith and
[1:16:57] i'm going to see what god can do
[1:16:59] amen i promise you you won't be
[1:17:00] disappointed is that right if you can
[1:17:01] get rid of the doubt if you can get rid
[1:17:03] of the fear and let god come in
[1:17:05] he can do something great in your life
[1:17:06] do you believe that when god makes the
[1:17:08] way he makes a way
[1:17:10] he didn't just say four lepers were
[1:17:11] coming but he made it to sound like an
[1:17:13] army was coming
[1:17:14] when god's before you there ain't nobody
[1:17:16] can be against you let me just remind
[1:17:17] you of that if god be with you ain't
[1:17:19] nobody gonna stand in your way
[1:17:21] we're not waiting on a prophet to come
[1:17:23] back to tell us what it what what us to
[1:17:24] do
[1:17:25] the message has already come it's told
[1:17:26] us what to do it's told us how to live
[1:17:28] what we to do now believe in it and live
[1:17:31] it is that right
[1:17:32] it was to bring out a bride but what are
[1:17:33] we doing with it are we the bride being
[1:17:35] called out are we just
[1:17:37] are we just enjoying coming to church
[1:17:38] and doing this and doing that are we
[1:17:40] actually living to our full potential
[1:17:42] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:17:46] amen i love the word of the lord i love
[1:17:48] the word of the lord i love faith i love
[1:17:50] i love healing i love seeing those
[1:17:52] miracles take place and
[1:17:53] i believe if you believe god he'll do
[1:17:55] those things in your life is that right
[1:17:57] there's many times in my life i've asked
[1:17:59] god to do something for me and he's done
[1:18:00] it
[1:18:01] you believe that brother brethren says
[1:18:03] in perseverance in 62 he said if you're
[1:18:04] sick he said why sit here he says that
[1:18:06] the leper said that day and the city was
[1:18:08] besieged why sit here
[1:18:09] until we die and i think that's the
[1:18:11] problem with most people they would just
[1:18:13] rather sit there
[1:18:14] and die than fight i don't know about
[1:18:17] you but as a christian you've got to
[1:18:18] fight in spirit is that right
[1:18:20] we've got a spirit of the lord that that
[1:18:22] whenever the enemy comes up against us
[1:18:23] we're not just going to lay down and die
[1:18:25] we're going to fight back is that right
[1:18:28] amen and i love the scripture when
[1:18:29] you're too tired to fight god will fight
[1:18:31] your battles do you believe that
[1:18:33] when samaria was besieged by the syrians
[1:18:35] and they said we sit here till we die
[1:18:36] we'll always be here we'll die right
[1:18:38] here
[1:18:39] if we go into the city they're dying for
[1:18:40] starvation let's go down to the camp of
[1:18:42] the enemy he says oh my what a poor
[1:18:44] he said what little faith they could
[1:18:45] have he said they go to the camp of the
[1:18:47] enemy who's trying to kill them but said
[1:18:49] if we die we're going to die anyhow
[1:18:51] he said so if we save we'll get our life
[1:18:53] saved he says why we'll do well
[1:18:55] and they went down and god honored that
[1:18:57] and here's where brother man says that
[1:18:58] little speck of dingy faith
[1:19:00] and i love that when and i want to make
[1:19:03] this point very clear
[1:19:05] when god says that we're given a measure
[1:19:06] of faith in the scripture we're given a
[1:19:08] measure of faith
[1:19:09] we don't know how much that measure is
[1:19:11] but i do know one thing that any amount
[1:19:13] of measure of faith
[1:19:14] will defeat any amount of doubt that the
[1:19:16] devil has
[1:19:18] amen and this story perfectly proves
[1:19:19] that they had little
[1:19:21] speck of dingy faith like the littlest
[1:19:23] speck you could find that's how much
[1:19:25] they had and it defeated
[1:19:26] all the doubt that there was that the
[1:19:28] enemy could throw at him so i want you
[1:19:29] to know if you only got a little speck
[1:19:31] and a little bit of dingy faith
[1:19:33] it will defeat no of any amount of doubt
[1:19:35] that the devil can put into your life
[1:19:37] amen and not only delivered them but
[1:19:39] they delivered all of israel is that
[1:19:41] right
[1:19:42] amen you begin to get delivered yourself
[1:19:43] then you see it take place in your house
[1:19:45] you see it take place in your church
[1:19:47] brother branham says it only takes one
[1:19:49] person to set a church on fire and he
[1:19:50] says what we need today
[1:19:52] is a man and a woman who will take god
[1:19:53] at his word and be persistent with him
[1:19:56] and that doesn't mean well i asked god
[1:19:57] for this and it didn't happen ask him
[1:19:59] again
[1:19:59] ask him again ask him until it comes to
[1:20:02] comes to pass is that right
[1:20:04] you've got to come to the point that no
[1:20:05] matter if it comes to pass or not you
[1:20:07] ask god for it you've got to believe
[1:20:08] that it's going to happen
[1:20:10] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:20:13] amen so we see that god wants people to
[1:20:15] be persistent reach out and take it the
[1:20:17] lepers walked to the camp they were
[1:20:19] crawling they were limping
[1:20:20] but god made a way and they believed and
[1:20:22] it was and it took place
[1:20:24] i don't care if you you say well i can't
[1:20:26] sing i can't pray i can't do this i
[1:20:28] can't do that
[1:20:29] ask god and let faith begin to rule in
[1:20:31] your life and see what god can do
[1:20:33] brother branham says god will cause
[1:20:35] earthquakes and the shakes to go down to
[1:20:37] the camp
[1:20:38] first so it's not you that's doing
[1:20:40] anything anyways it's what god's sending
[1:20:42] before you is that right
[1:20:43] amen the christian prayer shakes all of
[1:20:45] hell is that right
[1:20:46] i believe brother branham said the most
[1:20:48] powerful weapon that a christian has
[1:20:50] is prayer do you believe that and i
[1:20:52] skipped down the quote a little bit
[1:20:55] he says look up here what did his
[1:20:56] promise he said say how can it be done
[1:20:58] god said so he said that settles and it
[1:21:01] goes back to the very beginning what did
[1:21:02] brother branham say the foundation was
[1:21:04] for a christian
[1:21:05] belief in the word of god so if you
[1:21:06] believe in the word of god when you say
[1:21:08] god said so you know it will come to
[1:21:10] pass
[1:21:10] he says that settles it when god said it
[1:21:12] that settles it it's eternally settled
[1:21:14] in for in heaven forever
[1:21:16] he said his word is and his word was
[1:21:17] made flesh in his flesh today
[1:21:20] he says if in you if you'll let it come
[1:21:22] flesh and i love that it's it's all good
[1:21:24] when jesus was made flesh
[1:21:25] when he was the word made flesh but now
[1:21:27] the word has been made flesh in this day
[1:21:29] and it's in you is that right
[1:21:30] it was okay to say that god could do
[1:21:32] this or jesus could do this but when he
[1:21:33] said the word is nigh thee
[1:21:35] even in your lips it changed the
[1:21:36] scenario that you had the power is that
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:40] he said if you abide in me and my words
[1:21:41] and you then ask what you will and it
[1:21:43] will be done he said that's in saint
[1:21:44] john 15 he says see
[1:21:46] just let them words stay here he says
[1:21:48] believe it it's truth it's a seed and
[1:21:50] it'll bring to pass
[1:21:51] everything that he promised
[1:21:55] and i love that how the word of god is a
[1:21:56] seed you know what's funny about a seed
[1:21:59] you plant it and it doesn't
[1:22:00] automatically come up overnight
[1:22:02] me and my wife have been killing plants
[1:22:04] since the day we got married
[1:22:06] for the first time we've been married 10
[1:22:08] years now we have plants that are living
[1:22:11] it took us a while to figure out how to
[1:22:12] nurture the seed right
[1:22:15] so i'm not expecting everybody to leave
[1:22:16] church here tonight and just get rid of
[1:22:18] all the doubt and all the faith come in
[1:22:19] and go move mountains
[1:22:21] i don't expect that to happen it didn't
[1:22:22] happen with me if it happens for you
[1:22:23] great
[1:22:25] by all means go do it right
[1:22:28] but a seed has to be watered it has to
[1:22:30] be nurtured you have to put it in the
[1:22:31] right soil you have to do the right
[1:22:32] things for it it can have a certain
[1:22:34] amount of sunlight it needs shade a
[1:22:35] certain amount of time
[1:22:36] you can't just set it out on your porch
[1:22:38] water it once a day and expect it to
[1:22:39] grow
[1:22:40] right me and jenna found that out the
[1:22:42] hard way haven't we
[1:22:44] we finally got four plants we're so
[1:22:45] proud of them you know they've been
[1:22:47] alive for a couple months now
[1:22:49] it's awesome right well that's the way
[1:22:51] it is with faith
[1:22:53] one thing begins to add and one thing
[1:22:54] adds to another and then it adds to
[1:22:56] another and
[1:22:56] then all of a sudden you realize that
[1:22:58] that negative spirit you used to have
[1:22:59] that doubt that you used to have is
[1:23:00] dwindling away
[1:23:01] and one day you just wake up and you
[1:23:03] realize you're happy or your faith is
[1:23:04] better you're
[1:23:05] you're more happy to read in the word of
[1:23:06] god you're happy to hear the word of god
[1:23:08] you're happy to sing the songs of god
[1:23:10] do you believe that he said believe it
[1:23:13] it's the truth he said it's a seed it'll
[1:23:15] bring to pass
[1:23:15] everything that he's promised so we see
[1:23:17] the enemy had their food it had their
[1:23:19] water
[1:23:20] he said but they went to the enemy's
[1:23:21] camp and took back what they stole
[1:23:23] you see the enemy everything that he
[1:23:24] possesses that he took from you he's a
[1:23:26] thief is that right
[1:23:27] and that that item that he stole still
[1:23:29] belongs to if he stole your health if he
[1:23:31] stole your joy if he stole your victory
[1:23:33] if he's still in your family go back and
[1:23:34] take it from him amen
[1:23:36] it is your right as a son and daughter
[1:23:38] of god to take back anything the devil
[1:23:40] has stole from you
[1:23:41] he said their situation was terrible but
[1:23:43] god made a way and he says when you're
[1:23:44] desperate with god
[1:23:45] god will show up on the scene you
[1:23:47] believe that amen
[1:23:50] now the lepers they were in the right
[1:23:51] place they were in the camp of the lord
[1:23:52] they were in church but
[1:23:53] everything around them was falling apart
[1:23:56] i want you to know they were in the
[1:23:57] right place
[1:23:58] they were with israel they were the camp
[1:23:59] of the lord but everything around them
[1:24:01] was falling away there was death here
[1:24:03] death there
[1:24:03] but they had enough faith to go back and
[1:24:05] take what the devil had stole from them
[1:24:08] john 14 6 jesus saith unto him i'm the
[1:24:10] way the truth and the life and no man
[1:24:12] cometh unto the father
[1:24:13] but by me i want you to know tonight
[1:24:16] it's not by your works it's not by your
[1:24:17] ability to preach not by your ability to
[1:24:19] sing
[1:24:20] but it's by god that you are it's by
[1:24:22] jesus christ you're allowed to enter
[1:24:23] into the presence of the father is that
[1:24:25] right
[1:24:26] 2 corinthians 5 7 we walk by faith and
[1:24:28] not by sight
[1:24:31] it may not look good but keep walking is
[1:24:34] that right
[1:24:34] you may not feel it the first day but
[1:24:36] keep walking i love the story of jericho
[1:24:38] they didn't fall on the first day didn't
[1:24:40] fall on the second day but they kept
[1:24:41] walking is that right
[1:24:43] they kept marching and kept marching and
[1:24:44] what happened it eventually fell is that
[1:24:46] right
[1:24:47] brother branham says in the statue of a
[1:24:48] perfect man he says notice you must be
[1:24:50] born again and when you're born again
[1:24:51] you can't be born again without having
[1:24:53] faith
[1:24:55] he said that's right so you see on my
[1:24:56] chart here he said i got the very
[1:24:57] foundation faith is the foundation of
[1:24:59] all of it
[1:25:00] for without faith it is impossible to
[1:25:02] please god he that cometh to god must
[1:25:04] believe that he is and a rewarder of
[1:25:06] those that diligently seek him
[1:25:08] i don't know about you but if there's
[1:25:09] ever a time i want to seek god it's
[1:25:11] right now that i diligently seek the
[1:25:13] lord
[1:25:13] it's in this day that we need to be
[1:25:15] seeking him more than we're seeking
[1:25:16] favoritism more than we're seeking
[1:25:18] political favors but it's
[1:25:19] we've got to be seeking him and and
[1:25:21] seeking that rapture as much as we can
[1:25:24] amen i think that's it ought to be in
[1:25:25] every christian's life is to prepare for
[1:25:27] a rapture
[1:25:28] never in my life have i seen so many
[1:25:29] nominal christians talking about the
[1:25:31] rapture
[1:25:32] they see what's going on in the world
[1:25:33] and they see the signs of the time and
[1:25:35] i have people just talking about the
[1:25:36] rapture all the time it's about to
[1:25:37] happen it's about to happen but as the
[1:25:39] bride of jesus christ the one that
[1:25:41] benefits from the rapture how much more
[1:25:42] are we to be ready
[1:25:44] for that rapture to take place
[1:25:47] mark 5 and verse 22 and behold there
[1:25:49] cometh one of the
[1:25:50] rulers of the synagogue jerius by name
[1:25:52] and when he saw him he fell at his feet
[1:25:54] and he besought him greatly saying my
[1:25:56] little daughter lies at the point of
[1:25:57] death pray thee come
[1:25:58] and lay thy hands on her that she may be
[1:26:00] healed and she shall live
[1:26:03] amen i don't know how i have time to go
[1:26:05] through all this but
[1:26:07] we see that jerry has had to come down
[1:26:09] to a decision to put his faith into
[1:26:10] motion is that right
[1:26:12] he had to ask is that right and i don't
[1:26:14] know about you but you know and
[1:26:16] one thing that i've learned is if you
[1:26:17] don't ask the answer is always no
[1:26:20] and i have taught my kids that to a
[1:26:21] fault because they will just
[1:26:23] continuously ask
[1:26:24] for everything and anything because if
[1:26:26] you don't ask the answer is always no
[1:26:28] but there's a 50 50 chance the answer
[1:26:30] could be yes
[1:26:32] that's one thing i've learned in in in
[1:26:34] my career
[1:26:35] if i don't ask for the loans or i don't
[1:26:37] ask for the deposit guess what the
[1:26:38] answer is 100
[1:26:39] no but if i ask i have a 50 chance that
[1:26:42] i'm gonna get it
[1:26:43] and so i've learned that if you don't
[1:26:45] ask there's not a chance
[1:26:46] now whose fault is it if you don't ask
[1:26:49] yours
[1:26:50] right well god's busy
[1:26:53] no it's impossible well
[1:26:57] i'm not that important listen so here's
[1:27:01] one thing that's always amazed me as
[1:27:02] christians how unimportant we feel
[1:27:04] but god chose us for the toughest age is
[1:27:06] that right
[1:27:08] and you know it doesn't matter who
[1:27:09] chooses you it doesn't matter if man has
[1:27:11] disregarded you or man has done this but
[1:27:13] if god chose you to be chosen by god do
[1:27:15] we understand how privileged we really
[1:27:16] are that god come down
[1:27:18] and said i choose alan price in this day
[1:27:20] that
[1:27:21] i come down and i choose this one in
[1:27:23] this day
[1:27:25] it's amazing to me that how satan can
[1:27:27] come in and make us feel little when god
[1:27:29] values our life very very much so much
[1:27:32] that he sent his own son to die that you
[1:27:34] and i might have life is that right
[1:27:36] so don't let the devil ever convince you
[1:27:38] that you're not important enough you're
[1:27:39] not good enough
[1:27:40] god sees you as important god values
[1:27:43] your life
[1:27:44] god knows that you are important to him
[1:27:46] he knows that
[1:27:47] that maybe the world is turned against
[1:27:49] you but i want you to know god knows
[1:27:51] that what you're going through god knows
[1:27:53] the situation that you are currently in
[1:27:55] and god cares tonight i think it's a
[1:27:57] trick of the enemy that you would ever
[1:27:59] think that god doesn't care let me tell
[1:28:01] you something god cares for his children
[1:28:03] amen
[1:28:03] it's one thing i maybe learned as
[1:28:05] becoming a dad i care about what my
[1:28:07] children go through
[1:28:08] and that's one thing the father does he
[1:28:09] cares about his children amen
[1:28:12] amen do you love the lord i don't know
[1:28:14] where i was at but anyways you get the
[1:28:16] point
[1:28:16] god cares about you tonight if you're
[1:28:18] sitting here tonight and you think god
[1:28:19] doesn't care if i can tell you one thing
[1:28:21] you leave with know that god cares
[1:28:23] amen so we see here that brother branham
[1:28:26] says he was a water of those that
[1:28:27] diligently seek him
[1:28:28] now let's see now jerius he had to put
[1:28:31] his faith into action is that right
[1:28:35] now my kids love candy
[1:28:38] and if they don't ask there's no chance
[1:28:40] they're going to get the candy but if
[1:28:42] they ask there's a 50 50 chance they're
[1:28:43] going to get a candy
[1:28:44] right so what do they do they ask
[1:28:48] now as believers now brother branham
[1:28:50] says there's no such thing as an
[1:28:52] unanswered prayer is that right
[1:28:53] but there's sometimes god doesn't give
[1:28:55] you what you asked for because it's not
[1:28:57] what you needed is that right
[1:28:58] now my kids don't ask for vegetables
[1:29:02] ever they don't say dad give me give me
[1:29:05] a multivitamin some broccoli
[1:29:07] it's really what my body's craving no
[1:29:09] give me chocolate give me sugar
[1:29:11] that's what i want even as a little baby
[1:29:13] you just
[1:29:14] you take a little bit of sweet tea or
[1:29:16] you know take a little bit of chocolate
[1:29:18] pudding and put her mouth it's like
[1:29:20] cocaine they just go crazy right
[1:29:23] they just they can't help it it's just
[1:29:24] it's got these endorphins
[1:29:26] in it they're just releasing your brain
[1:29:28] and they just love it
[1:29:30] and they learn to ask and as christians
[1:29:32] i don't know what a
[1:29:33] what point or what happened in our life
[1:29:36] or what happened in our mind that doubt
[1:29:37] got so
[1:29:38] big that we just felt like we couldn't
[1:29:39] ask anymore
[1:29:41] now i want you to just listen to this
[1:29:43] i've read this quote many times but
[1:29:45] it's brother branham he's talking uh
[1:29:46] brother branham is preaching a service
[1:29:47] and he's talking about
[1:29:48] god watching over the three hebrew
[1:29:50] children shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:29:52] and the angels are coming up wanting to
[1:29:53] go down gabriel comes up and he just
[1:29:55] dramatizes us out wormwood comes up
[1:29:57] and and they're they're all asking him
[1:29:59] have you considered them
[1:30:00] he said yes all night i've been watching
[1:30:02] him he says brother his eyes on the
[1:30:03] sparrow he i know he watches me and he's
[1:30:05] watching you
[1:30:06] he said he's just seeing how much faith
[1:30:08] you got he says how much faith do you
[1:30:10] have he says he wants to see what kind
[1:30:12] of stand you'll take
[1:30:14] the hour has come what are you going to
[1:30:16] do he said i've watched them all night i
[1:30:18] heard every prayer they prayed he says
[1:30:19] you angels have been good angels but i
[1:30:21] can't let you go for i'm going myself
[1:30:23] so we see that your faith will bring him
[1:30:25] on the scene do you believe that
[1:30:27] now we see that you've got to have faith
[1:30:30] in the word of god that is our
[1:30:31] foundation is that right
[1:30:35] amen do you love the lord amen there's
[1:30:37] no way i'm going to get through this so
[1:30:38] i'm going to
[1:30:39] speed it up a little bit but
[1:30:42] amen so we see that your faith will
[1:30:45] bring
[1:30:46] jesus on the scene is that right now
[1:30:50] let's see here in jesus matthew 5 and
[1:30:52] verse 24
[1:30:54] and jesus went with him and much people
[1:30:56] followed him and thronged him and there
[1:30:57] was a certain woman who had an issue of
[1:30:58] blood 12 years
[1:31:00] now that's a long time to have an issue
[1:31:02] right
[1:31:03] you know if i have a headache for more
[1:31:05] than five minutes i'm looking for
[1:31:06] tylenol
[1:31:07] right i don't like being sick i don't
[1:31:09] like having a headache if there's
[1:31:11] something that can cure it if the lord
[1:31:12] doesn't heal me i'm gonna go find
[1:31:14] something is that right
[1:31:15] now she had suffered many things from
[1:31:18] many physicians that had spent all she
[1:31:20] had and was nothing better but rather
[1:31:22] grew worse
[1:31:23] so she had tried everything she had
[1:31:25] tried worldly things she had tried
[1:31:27] medicine she had tried this she'd tried
[1:31:29] that no doubt she'd been prayed for
[1:31:30] before
[1:31:32] but when she heard that of jesus came in
[1:31:34] the press behind and touched his garment
[1:31:36] for she said if i may touch his clothes
[1:31:38] i shall be whole now she didn't have a
[1:31:39] scripture for that
[1:31:41] but she had faith is that right she
[1:31:43] didn't have a scripture said if you
[1:31:44] touch the hem of his garment she'll be
[1:31:45] healed but she had faith to believe that
[1:31:47] if she did it it would come to pass
[1:31:49] and straightway the fountain of blood
[1:31:50] was dried up and she felt in her body
[1:31:52] that she was healed of the plague
[1:31:54] she refused to sit there and die is that
[1:31:56] right and i think as christians you've
[1:31:58] got to come to that point in your life
[1:31:59] to say i've lived with this long enough
[1:32:01] i've lived with this tribulation i've
[1:32:03] lived with this trial long enough i'm
[1:32:04] going to do something about it
[1:32:06] and there's one place that you can go
[1:32:07] whenever you have a need and that's to
[1:32:09] jesus is that right
[1:32:10] if you can but touch the hymn of his
[1:32:12] garment he will make you whole
[1:32:14] she put her faith into motion and you've
[1:32:15] seen what happened in jesus immediately
[1:32:17] knowing of himself that virtue had gone
[1:32:18] out
[1:32:19] turned by the press and said who touched
[1:32:21] my clothes and his disciples said unto
[1:32:23] him thou seest the multitude throng of
[1:32:24] thee and thou sayest who touched me
[1:32:26] and he looked round about to see her
[1:32:28] that had done this thing but the woman
[1:32:29] fearing and trembling knowing what was
[1:32:31] done in her
[1:32:31] came and fell down before him and told
[1:32:33] him all the truth
[1:32:35] and he said unto her daughter thy faith
[1:32:36] hath made thee whole he didn't say i
[1:32:38] healed you he said thy faith
[1:32:39] has made thee whole is that right go in
[1:32:41] peace and thou shalt be whole of the
[1:32:43] plague
[1:32:44] she believed what she was asking for and
[1:32:46] she received the blessing is that right
[1:32:48] just like the lepers she knew that if
[1:32:50] she stayed there she would die but if
[1:32:51] she
[1:32:52] if she was going to take a chance take a
[1:32:53] chance on jesus is that right
[1:32:55] she needed that spiritual food and she
[1:32:57] knew that god would make a way
[1:32:59] and we see that while yet spake there
[1:33:00] came rulers of the synagogue how certain
[1:33:02] say thy daughter is dead
[1:33:04] and i'm going back to jerius i'm sorry
[1:33:06] why trouble is thou the master any
[1:33:08] further
[1:33:09] and so we see that jerry said come to
[1:33:13] jesus when his daughter was sick but now
[1:33:15] she's dead
[1:33:16] right all hope is gone but i want you to
[1:33:19] know
[1:33:20] what jesus anything can happen
[1:33:23] right anything is possible is that right
[1:33:26] now to our human finite mind we not
[1:33:28] may not be able to comprehend it but
[1:33:30] this right here tells you that anything
[1:33:31] with jesus is possible
[1:33:33] he says with me all things are possible
[1:33:35] is that right
[1:33:37] and you see satan is probably sitting on
[1:33:39] jerius's shoulder at this time tell him
[1:33:40] hey it's too late
[1:33:42] there's nothing you can do sit here and
[1:33:44] die
[1:33:46] but jesus i love this as soon as jesus
[1:33:48] heard the word that was spoken
[1:33:50] now watch jesus he had the fullness of
[1:33:51] faith is that right fullness of the
[1:33:53] godhead bodily he had what we have in
[1:33:54] measure he had in fullness
[1:33:57] he said he hath said unto the ruler the
[1:33:59] synagogue be not afraid only believe
[1:34:01] i love how jesus shuts up the enemy as
[1:34:03] soon as they start talking
[1:34:05] as soon as the enemy said this and as
[1:34:06] soon as jesus heard what was spoken he
[1:34:08] said unto the ruler be not afraid
[1:34:10] only believe and i think if there's
[1:34:12] anything that you and i can learn from
[1:34:13] this tonight is
[1:34:14] cast out fear is that right brother
[1:34:17] brahm says fear
[1:34:18] is it it's false it doesn't mean it's
[1:34:20] going to happen it's fake it's the tool
[1:34:22] of the enemy is that right
[1:34:23] you've got to get rid of fear and
[1:34:24] replace it with faith is that right
[1:34:26] the word of god will shut the mouth of
[1:34:28] the enemy every time
[1:34:30] brother branham says in the eagles story
[1:34:31] of the burness he said if you sit where
[1:34:32] you are your sickness he said the
[1:34:34] doctors will give up on you and you'll
[1:34:35] die
[1:34:36] he said that's all you cannot lose by
[1:34:38] trusting god
[1:34:40] right you cannot lose by trusting god he
[1:34:42] said if you're asked to go down to the
[1:34:44] camp of the enemy
[1:34:45] he said but you're invited to the house
[1:34:46] of god he says what are you waiting for
[1:34:48] there's no losing
[1:34:51] i don't know about you but i like to be
[1:34:53] on the winning team occasionally
[1:34:55] he said there's only one way that you
[1:34:57] can lose sit still and don't act on it
[1:35:00] i'm here to tell you you have every
[1:35:02] right as a son and daughter of god
[1:35:04] you know brother branham talks about the
[1:35:05] power and authority he talks about the
[1:35:07] police officer he doesn't have the power
[1:35:09] or the capability to stop the car but he
[1:35:11] has the authority is that right
[1:35:13] is that right as sons and daughters of
[1:35:14] god you may not have the power to defeat
[1:35:16] cancer or defeat this or defeat that
[1:35:18] but you have the authority as a son and
[1:35:20] daughter of god to and act on that power
[1:35:23] brother rem says there's no losing he
[1:35:24] says there's only one way you can lose
[1:35:26] and that's to sit still
[1:35:28] and don't act on it and i don't know
[1:35:30] about you but i feel sorry for anybody
[1:35:32] that's just gonna lay down and defeat
[1:35:34] i don't know about you but i will go
[1:35:36] kicking and screaming if i'm gonna fight
[1:35:37] i'm gonna go down to the bitter end is
[1:35:39] that right
[1:35:40] he said how many says that's true say
[1:35:42] amen he said there's one thing god
[1:35:44] cannot do he says yes there's one thing
[1:35:45] god cannot do
[1:35:46] he cannot fail he said that's one thing
[1:35:49] he can't do he cannot fail he wins
[1:35:51] every time because he's god he said
[1:35:53] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:35:55] word
[1:35:56] shall never fail he says is that right
[1:35:58] so we see that when we put our
[1:35:59] foundation our faith in the word of god
[1:36:01] that's one thing that god said will
[1:36:02] never pass away
[1:36:04] heavens and earth will be destroyed burn
[1:36:06] over with fire but his word will last
[1:36:08] forever
[1:36:09] so believe he says you must have it the
[1:36:11] same way tonight a quick decision choose
[1:36:13] you this day whom you'll serve and take
[1:36:15] god at his word
[1:36:16] i don't know about you but when you take
[1:36:18] god's word he'll prove it to you is that
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:21] amen do you love the lord
[1:36:25] the word's been preached the signs have
[1:36:27] been done the holy ghost is here this
[1:36:28] time
[1:36:29] he said the hour has come for a decision
[1:36:31] made amongst the people he said what
[1:36:32] more can god do
[1:36:33] and i asked you that today what more
[1:36:35] proof do you need that god is real in
[1:36:36] this
[1:36:37] day then what he's already shown you if
[1:36:39] you need more proof i don't know why you
[1:36:41] would need more proof he has made
[1:36:42] himself known down through all the ages
[1:36:44] down through history
[1:36:45] in your own life personally you know
[1:36:47] that god is real you'll believe and take
[1:36:49] him at his word
[1:36:51] he said what more can god do he said he
[1:36:52] sent it down with signs and wonders
[1:36:54] discernment proved it scientifically put
[1:36:55] it on a picture and sent it across the
[1:36:57] world he said thousands of thousands are
[1:36:58] witnessing
[1:36:59] others are being healed what about you i
[1:37:03] don't know about you but if somebody's
[1:37:04] getting blessed i want to be right up
[1:37:05] there with them
[1:37:06] right they're giving away free money i'm
[1:37:07] going to be in line if they're giving
[1:37:09] away free blessings i'm going to be in
[1:37:10] line if they're giving away healing
[1:37:12] even if i don't need healing i want
[1:37:13] healing there's always something i found
[1:37:15] out the older i get the more i hurt the
[1:37:17] more i ache i just wake up and i'm just
[1:37:18] in pain i don't understand it but i'm
[1:37:21] just in pain
[1:37:22] but that comes with age the body is
[1:37:24] dying from the day we're born
[1:37:25] is that right so there's always
[1:37:27] something god can do for you why don't
[1:37:29] you put him in
[1:37:30] take him at his word so he said others
[1:37:33] are being healed what about you he says
[1:37:34] they arose in the middle of the night
[1:37:35] and started down walking towards faith
[1:37:37] the host of the syrian he says
[1:37:39] and i love this what an attack planned
[1:37:40] by god
[1:37:42] you know i've always loved looking at
[1:37:44] the scripture
[1:37:45] because you know one of my
[1:37:48] one of the things that i really like to
[1:37:49] do is use services and young people and
[1:37:52] maybe i don't do that a lot but it's one
[1:37:53] of my favorite things to do because i
[1:37:54] really just
[1:37:55] you know i i enjoy the youth and not
[1:37:57] that i have nothing against
[1:37:58] you people
[1:38:02] but there's just something about it i
[1:38:03] just like it right that maybe that's
[1:38:05] where my ministry is called that's why
[1:38:07] i'm not good at preaching
[1:38:08] to everybody else but so we see
[1:38:11] what an attack plan by god and i love to
[1:38:14] look at how god chooses people in the
[1:38:15] scripture
[1:38:16] because when i see how he chooses people
[1:38:18] in the scripture i'm like now i get why
[1:38:19] he chose me
[1:38:20] so god is going to take down the host of
[1:38:22] the syrians right and he comes down and
[1:38:24] you know you know when you're in school
[1:38:25] you were picking teams and you always
[1:38:26] picked the good kids first right
[1:38:28] the bad kids got picked last i love how
[1:38:31] god comes down he's like well how am i
[1:38:32] going to defeat this host of the syrians
[1:38:34] that are without number and
[1:38:35] they got camels grasshoppers you know
[1:38:37] people are eating kids in the city i
[1:38:38] mean it's a bad situation
[1:38:40] and he comes down he's like well i'm not
[1:38:41] going to pick the army i'm going to pick
[1:38:43] lepers
[1:38:44] right like you know the angels got to be
[1:38:48] standing there like i'd probably pick
[1:38:50] you know the general or the captain or
[1:38:51] the king but if you want lepers that's
[1:38:53] fine
[1:38:54] right i mean if you want lepers to fight
[1:38:57] your battle fine go ahead
[1:39:00] you know he comes down and he's going to
[1:39:02] destroy jericho but he's going to save
[1:39:04] one person and
[1:39:05] well let's save a harlot right
[1:39:09] right it's comical you're kind of
[1:39:11] chuckling but
[1:39:12] he says well i'm going to go to an
[1:39:13] entire city where are you going to go
[1:39:14] i'm going to go to the woman that's been
[1:39:15] married five times and living with
[1:39:16] someone that's not her husband
[1:39:18] don't you want to go talk to the
[1:39:20] ministry or
[1:39:22] go to the synagogue talk to the priest
[1:39:24] right
[1:39:26] who does god choose oh we're going to go
[1:39:28] across
[1:39:29] we're going to go across the sea there's
[1:39:32] a man tied up in the graveyard in chains
[1:39:34] i
[1:39:34] need to talk to him all right
[1:39:37] look down all through the scripture
[1:39:38] gideon was a nobody
[1:39:40] all right i'm gonna choose a king for
[1:39:43] israel i'm gonna pick the smallest
[1:39:45] child that jesse has
[1:39:48] right i'm gonna pick the worst one
[1:39:51] that he has i'm gonna go with it oh i'm
[1:39:54] gonna deliver all of israel
[1:39:56] i'm gonna pick someone who murdered
[1:39:57] egyptians fled to the desert and can't
[1:40:00] talk good
[1:40:02] all right right
[1:40:06] so the thing that really shows to me
[1:40:09] is god don't need you to do anything
[1:40:13] you need him to do everything so when
[1:40:15] you see your question why did god choose
[1:40:17] me it's not about you and i it's about
[1:40:19] allowing submitting ourselves so that
[1:40:21] god can come and work through us
[1:40:23] in this day do you believe that when god
[1:40:25] before us who can be against us it
[1:40:27] doesn't matter what your past look like
[1:40:29] what your present look like if god's
[1:40:31] with you your future is going to look
[1:40:32] pretty good amen
[1:40:33] if you can completely surrender yourself
[1:40:35] to god submit yourself to the word god
[1:40:37] can do great things
[1:40:39] through a harlot through this one
[1:40:40] through that one through someone who
[1:40:42] cannot speak
[1:40:43] he can do great things if you'll submit
[1:40:44] yourself to him and take out fear take
[1:40:46] out doubt and replace it with faith
[1:40:49] he said he says what an attack planned
[1:40:51] by god he said satan had to be really
[1:40:53] confused right
[1:40:55] he's standing there at the host of syria
[1:40:57] just laughing at what's happened to
[1:40:58] israel he sees four lepers coming
[1:41:00] he's got to be chuckling a little bit
[1:41:02] right but then all of a sudden he starts
[1:41:04] to see
[1:41:04] the syrians running running fleeing
[1:41:07] because why god
[1:41:08] put a host a sound in the air he put a
[1:41:10] voice before the lepers
[1:41:12] to run them out before they ever showed
[1:41:14] up so we see that god had confused them
[1:41:16] he says
[1:41:17] he said i won't use ministers i won't
[1:41:18] use the prophet of elisha at the time he
[1:41:20] said i won't use the king but i'm going
[1:41:22] to use lepers
[1:41:23] and i love that god honored their faith
[1:41:25] not their position in the church not
[1:41:26] their abilities
[1:41:27] not their financial status not their
[1:41:29] size but he honored their faith i don't
[1:41:32] care how good you are how bad you are if
[1:41:34] you got faith
[1:41:35] god can see you through to the end amen
[1:41:37] do you love the lord
[1:41:39] amen he said he caused a great storm to
[1:41:41] come on the desert and roar and run
[1:41:43] all the syrians away he says they went
[1:41:45] right on in and got plenty to eat got
[1:41:46] some wine and got happy if you read the
[1:41:48] story they got in there and they got a
[1:41:49] little excited they got a little drunk
[1:41:51] on the y
[1:41:52] they were excited i think sometimes if
[1:41:54] you would get if you would really figure
[1:41:55] out how big
[1:41:56] god is and how much he's on your side
[1:41:58] you'd get a little excited too amen
[1:42:02] they got plenty to eat
[1:42:05] i'm gonna lose my voice but it'd be all
[1:42:06] right god will see us through to the end
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:10] it's god's clock telling me to power
[1:42:12] down he said there's a lot of sick
[1:42:14] people here with heart trouble a lot of
[1:42:16] tubercular and he says a lot bound in
[1:42:18] chairs he says why don't you tonight
[1:42:19] he says why would you sit there till you
[1:42:21] die the hour has come to make a decision
[1:42:23] and i say that tonight for spiritual
[1:42:25] sickness the time has come for you to
[1:42:26] make a decision
[1:42:28] are you going to choose fear are you
[1:42:29] going to choose faith amen
[1:42:31] it's time to make a decision it's time
[1:42:32] to put your faith into motion
[1:42:34] he says and brother he says and faith
[1:42:36] now does the rest of it faith does the
[1:42:38] rest he says
[1:42:38] so you must have faith for a foundation
[1:42:41] all christianity
[1:42:42] all you are and all you will ever be is
[1:42:45] based upon
[1:42:45] faith in the word that's the reason i
[1:42:48] believe the word see he says all
[1:42:50] christianity
[1:42:50] all you are and all you will ever be is
[1:42:52] based upon the faith
[1:42:54] in the word he said that's the reason i
[1:42:56] believe the word he said god can't do no
[1:42:58] more about it it's up to you you've got
[1:42:59] to make the decision
[1:43:01] you can sit here till you die look
[1:43:03] you've been invited to go down
[1:43:04] you don't have to go down to the enemy's
[1:43:06] camp you come to a father's house where
[1:43:08] he's expecting you tonight
[1:43:09] he wants you to come he says he sent his
[1:43:12] son he died he put a
[1:43:13] deposit in for your healing and the hour
[1:43:16] has come for you to make a decision now
[1:43:17] amen he says the hour has come
[1:43:19] hebrews 10 23 says let us hold fast to
[1:43:21] the profession of our faith without
[1:43:23] wavering
[1:43:24] for he is faithful that promised it's
[1:43:26] not you are faithful but god is faithful
[1:43:28] for he promised amen
[1:43:30] but we've got to hold fast to the
[1:43:32] profession of our faith
[1:43:35] amen do you love the lord you know when
[1:43:37] i when i have a serious need in my life
[1:43:39] i begin to write down and thank god for
[1:43:41] what he's already given me
[1:43:42] brother branham he made a statement he
[1:43:44] says picture a well body and walk into
[1:43:46] it
[1:43:47] right if you have to picture your body
[1:43:49] go back and find a picture of you when
[1:43:51] you were healthy put it on the fridge or
[1:43:52] put it in your car
[1:43:53] look at it every day until god brings
[1:43:55] you back to that amen
[1:43:57] he said don't worry about it god's in he
[1:43:59] abideth faithful is that right
[1:44:01] amen romans 10 and 8 but what sayeth
[1:44:04] that the word is nigh thee
[1:44:05] even in thy mouth and in thy heart and
[1:44:07] that is the word of faith which we
[1:44:09] preach
[1:44:10] you begin to study faith in the
[1:44:11] scripture and you begin to see how it's
[1:44:13] everywhere
[1:44:14] because what is it it's our foundation
[1:44:15] and god wants you to be have a strong
[1:44:17] and sure foundation
[1:44:18] it's faith in the word of god
[1:44:21] amen god has not given us the spirit of
[1:44:23] doubt or fear but he's given us the
[1:44:24] spirit of a sound mind is that right
[1:44:26] he's given us the spirit of faith
[1:44:28] everything was finished at calvary he
[1:44:29] just wants you to believe it
[1:44:32] i love this brother ma'am says in the
[1:44:33] statue of a perfect man in 62 he says
[1:44:35] your faith brings
[1:44:36] brings god he said it's the thing that
[1:44:38] brings he says
[1:44:39] it's the thing that brings the prayer
[1:44:41] and god together on the scene
[1:44:43] and that's faith he said prayer he says
[1:44:46] faith changes from here to here and it
[1:44:47] brings it together
[1:44:48] he says speak the word he says all i
[1:44:50] want you to do is say
[1:44:52] the word and everything is all right he
[1:44:54] said see he didn't
[1:44:55] he said he didn't have to be there jesus
[1:44:57] say the word why he said god is
[1:44:59] omnipresent he's all-powerful
[1:45:01] he's just as powerful beneath the world
[1:45:03] as he is on top of the world or either
[1:45:04] side he's god
[1:45:05] and the only thing you have to do is
[1:45:07] just speak the word and he said now
[1:45:09] faith does the rest of it right
[1:45:12] and how true is that you can see it in
[1:45:14] fear and i've talked about this many
[1:45:16] times
[1:45:18] how the satan chose the mind but god
[1:45:20] chose the heart right
[1:45:22] and how many times can you let your mind
[1:45:24] run wild right
[1:45:27] maybe somebody has nothing against you
[1:45:29] but they just glanced at you the wrong
[1:45:30] way
[1:45:31] and in your mind you build up 4 000
[1:45:33] scenarios that how that person doesn't
[1:45:35] like you
[1:45:37] maybe they're having a bad day and
[1:45:38] didn't shake your hands because they're
[1:45:40] dealing with really really hard family
[1:45:41] problems really hard
[1:45:42] financial problems really hard this or
[1:45:44] that
[1:45:46] but you created in your mind that they
[1:45:47] didn't like you and that's what satan
[1:45:49] likes to do come in and cause fear and
[1:45:51] doubt division that's what he is
[1:45:52] he comes in to divide steal kill and
[1:45:54] destroy is that right
[1:45:57] but could you imagine living a life
[1:45:58] where you just thought everybody liked
[1:46:00] you
[1:46:02] right i heard a man say one time he's
[1:46:05] like if they don't pay your bills you
[1:46:06] shouldn't worry their opinion about you
[1:46:08] i've kind of come to that grasp you want
[1:46:11] to come pay my bills i will gladly
[1:46:13] listen to your opinion
[1:46:14] but if you don't keep your opinion to
[1:46:16] yourself
[1:46:18] right you say well that's kind of
[1:46:20] comical but it's kind of true too
[1:46:23] why should we live our lives in fear and
[1:46:25] doubt
[1:46:26] of what other people think when it
[1:46:28] doesn't matter what they think
[1:46:30] all right we so
[1:46:33] it'd be really you know we should worry
[1:46:36] about what people think if
[1:46:37] the scripture said you know it's
[1:46:40] depending on how people view you as
[1:46:41] you can come into heaven but nowhere in
[1:46:44] the scripture does it say that nowhere
[1:46:46] does
[1:46:46] the prophet say that is how god views
[1:46:49] you is that right
[1:46:51] okay i'm gonna get off my high horse
[1:46:52] there and be done
[1:46:55] amen if the musicians would go ahead and
[1:46:56] come i'll just go ahead and wrap this up
[1:46:58] so don't worry god abideth faithful and
[1:47:01] the scripture romans 10 verse 8 said but
[1:47:03] what saith that he said the word is nigh
[1:47:04] thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart
[1:47:06] that the word he said the word of faith
[1:47:09] which we preach
[1:47:10] so we see if it's in your mouth i want
[1:47:11] this to just really sink in really good
[1:47:13] it's got to be in your heart
[1:47:14] it can't be in your mind this this is
[1:47:16] not a this is not a positive thinking
[1:47:18] scenario this is not a positive thing
[1:47:20] it's got to be rested in your heart
[1:47:22] that you believe what god has said you
[1:47:24] believe that he is the true and
[1:47:26] and that he is the true one true god
[1:47:28] you've got to believe that and then it
[1:47:29] can speak from your mouth amen
[1:47:31] so we see that that your faith brings
[1:47:33] god and prayer together
[1:47:35] so we see that faith is the foundation
[1:47:37] for all christianity all you are and all
[1:47:39] you'll ever be is based upon faith in
[1:47:41] the word of god
[1:47:42] now hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ is
[1:47:45] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:47:47] now if he was able to do that for the
[1:47:49] four lepers if he was able to do that
[1:47:50] for rahab if he was able to do that for
[1:47:52] moses
[1:47:52] he was able to do that for the children
[1:47:54] of israel how much more will he be able
[1:47:55] to do it for you today
[1:47:57] his word is has been tested time and
[1:47:59] time again but if you'll take him in his
[1:48:01] word
[1:48:01] he will meet you right there and he will
[1:48:04] prove his word to you amen
[1:48:06] so we see that hebrews 11 6 says but
[1:48:09] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:48:11] him
[1:48:12] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:48:14] that he is and that he is the rewarder
[1:48:16] of them that diligently
[1:48:18] seek him so without faith it's
[1:48:20] impossible to please god and i love
[1:48:23] how this all ties together when jesus is
[1:48:25] saying when i return what does he ask
[1:48:27] that he'll find
[1:48:28] will i find faith we say well
[1:48:32] you know faith is the abcs of the gospel
[1:48:34] and i love preaching on the simple
[1:48:35] things
[1:48:36] right but none of this works if you
[1:48:39] don't have faith
[1:48:40] you can quote to me every quote you want
[1:48:42] to quote you can tell me all the deep
[1:48:44] mysteries but if you don't have a
[1:48:45] foundation and faith in the word of god
[1:48:47] it means nothing
[1:48:49] it means absolutely nothing if you don't
[1:48:50] have faith in the word of god to believe
[1:48:52] that those things are capable of
[1:48:53] happening it'll do you no good
[1:48:55] that's like having a gun with no bullets
[1:48:57] or a bullet with no guns
[1:48:59] is that right so we see that without
[1:49:02] faith it is impossible to please him
[1:49:04] now the great thing is you can leave
[1:49:05] here tonight and hang your head low and
[1:49:07] say well i don't have enough faith to do
[1:49:08] what this brother does or this sister
[1:49:09] does
[1:49:10] i want you to know anybody can start
[1:49:13] right anybody
[1:49:14] can take a step in the right direction
[1:49:16] god has come down in this message
[1:49:17] tonight to tell you that you can make a
[1:49:19] change is that right and you can get rid
[1:49:20] of doubt
[1:49:21] you can get rid of fear why because he
[1:49:23] promised you faith he didn't promise you
[1:49:24] fear
[1:49:25] he said i will give you faith he said i
[1:49:27] will not leave those comfortless is that
[1:49:28] right
[1:49:29] he come here to comfort us do you love
[1:49:31] the lord amen i'll close with this
[1:49:33] scripture because i just
[1:49:34] i love the scripture i'll tie it all
[1:49:36] together in genesis 24 and 55 and her
[1:49:39] brother and mother said and this is
[1:49:40] let the damsel abide with us for a few
[1:49:42] days and this is where eliezer come to
[1:49:44] choose a bride
[1:49:46] he said he said let the dams will abide
[1:49:48] with us a few days at least 10 and then
[1:49:50] and that she shall go and he said unto
[1:49:53] them hinder me not seeing the lord hath
[1:49:55] prospered my way
[1:49:56] send me a way that i may go to my master
[1:49:59] and they said we will call to the damsel
[1:50:01] and inquire at her mouth
[1:50:03] and you know it's good for mom and daddy
[1:50:05] to believe it's good for your wife and
[1:50:06] husband to believe it's good for your
[1:50:08] sister and your brother to believe
[1:50:10] but what do you believe you can't ride a
[1:50:12] coat tail to heaven
[1:50:14] in verse 57 they said well call the
[1:50:17] damsel inquired her mouth and when they
[1:50:19] called rebecca they said unto her will
[1:50:20] thou go with this man and she said
[1:50:22] i will go we've got to come to a point
[1:50:25] of no return in our life
[1:50:27] we've got to come to a point that when
[1:50:28] faith is going to outweigh fear faith is
[1:50:30] going to outweigh doubt
[1:50:32] and we can see that by her words she
[1:50:33] believed what the messenger was saying
[1:50:36] right and this is just a perfect example
[1:50:39] example of the the bride and jesus of
[1:50:42] jesus christ coming and saying i will go
[1:50:44] when god calls us i will go is that
[1:50:47] right when he returns will he find
[1:50:49] faith in the bride that's what he's
[1:50:52] looking for he's not looking for big
[1:50:53] churches he's not looking for great
[1:50:54] people great singers he's not looking
[1:50:56] for
[1:50:56] for long hair and perfect dress he's not
[1:50:58] looking for legalism he's looking for
[1:51:00] faith
[1:51:01] is that right you know that's that's one
[1:51:03] of the greatest things is
[1:51:05] as you know when i ask somebody to do
[1:51:08] something
[1:51:09] if they fail a bunch of times i'm not
[1:51:11] going to keep asking
[1:51:13] but how many times can you go back and
[1:51:15] just one day just sit down and write it
[1:51:16] out where you've asked god to do
[1:51:17] something
[1:51:18] and if he didn't give it to you maybe it
[1:51:20] was something you didn't need
[1:51:22] is that right wants and needs are two
[1:51:24] different things
[1:51:25] you know my kids want candy that's a
[1:51:27] want they need their vegetables they
[1:51:29] need their protein they need this they
[1:51:30] need that
[1:51:31] they may ask for candy 100 times and get
[1:51:33] vegetables and only get candy once
[1:51:35] is that right god will give you what you
[1:51:37] have need of
[1:51:38] but that's the thing about the true
[1:51:40] christian when you come in tune with the
[1:51:42] word
[1:51:42] in tune in line with god you'll ask what
[1:51:45] you need for
[1:51:47] you'll become in tune with god that
[1:51:48] you'll ask him
[1:51:50] what he wants to give you is that right
[1:51:52] and faith will put you in that situation
[1:51:54] but you have to put your faith into
[1:51:56] motion
[1:51:57] now no one's going to leave here tonight
[1:51:58] and and say put my faith into motion
[1:52:01] because that means test
[1:52:02] me right no one's going to go out and
[1:52:04] just say god just
[1:52:05] test me put a mountain in front of me
[1:52:06] and let me just move it
[1:52:08] if you are you're crazy right
[1:52:13] satan's doing a pretty good job fighting
[1:52:14] me i don't want to add to the fire
[1:52:18] but if you truly believe in the word of
[1:52:19] god no matter what the enemy brings
[1:52:20] against you you'll believe and have
[1:52:21] faith that god will see you through to
[1:52:23] the end
[1:52:24] amen do you love the lord amen i hope
[1:52:26] something was said that
[1:52:27] god bless you i know it was jumbled up
[1:52:29] and mixed up but it came on my heart
[1:52:31] last night about midnight laying in the
[1:52:32] bed and
[1:52:33] and i just kept thinking about the four
[1:52:35] lepers and
[1:52:36] the story's done so much for me and my
[1:52:38] life looking at faith and you know
[1:52:40] you know raising kids and praying for
[1:52:42] them you know
[1:52:43] just the mighty things that i've seen
[1:52:45] god do in their lives and you know i
[1:52:46] talk i talk about my kids all the time
[1:52:48] but
[1:52:48] you know they're my favorite you know so
[1:52:51] you know i talk about it's
[1:52:52] just what i it's what i live for and my
[1:52:55] wife and
[1:52:56] you know with paxton that last time he
[1:52:58] was he was really sick and
[1:53:00] you know i just began to write down
[1:53:01] every day you know because they were
[1:53:03] going to do surgery if the bleeding
[1:53:04] didn't stop and
[1:53:05] y'all heard the testimony a million
[1:53:06] times maybe to bless somebody online but
[1:53:08] come down to the last day i mean the
[1:53:10] last day that the bleeding stopped and
[1:53:12] i was just writing down every day i was
[1:53:14] fasting and writing down every day i
[1:53:16] thank the lord for the healing of my son
[1:53:17] and just
[1:53:18] continuously continuously not pictured
[1:53:20] in my head what he was going to do what
[1:53:21] it was going to look like and
[1:53:23] i promise you within those few days god
[1:53:25] brought everything to pass
[1:53:26] amen because we believed it amen and i
[1:53:29] promise you if
[1:53:30] amen amen
[1:53:34] but that's the thing it doesn't work
[1:53:36] just for me it works for everybody
[1:53:37] every son and daughter of god has this
[1:53:40] right to stand on it
[1:53:41] and you know many people you know i've
[1:53:42] had people say you know you know i've
[1:53:44] had people talk to me oh mr positive
[1:53:46] that's all you want to think about
[1:53:46] that's all you want to dwell and well
[1:53:48] duh
[1:53:50] you know i mean my mom my wife people
[1:53:52] tell me bad news i don't want to hear it
[1:53:55] i don't even want to know about it you
[1:53:57] know that's why i'm probably not
[1:53:58] not the best person to talk to that's
[1:54:01] why god has pastors and other ministers
[1:54:02] they're really good at that
[1:54:03] because i'm going to come back with
[1:54:05] positive things i'm going to come back
[1:54:06] with well this is what you need to do
[1:54:07] this is what you need to do and
[1:54:08] i'm going to give you all the wrong
[1:54:09] advice that's why you need to go to your
[1:54:10] pastor not to admit i'm
[1:54:12] i'm i'm a youth minister or minister or
[1:54:14] evangelist i don't know what i am but
[1:54:15] i'm just here to preach the word of god
[1:54:16] is that right
[1:54:17] right that's why you have these other
[1:54:18] men that are called for these great
[1:54:19] things and for these good things because
[1:54:21] they're needed is that right
[1:54:22] they're very much needed but i promise
[1:54:24] you if you replace doubt with fear
[1:54:26] or excuse me replace doubt with faith
[1:54:28] good things will begin to happen in your
[1:54:29] life
[1:54:30] i promise you that the scripture says it
[1:54:33] if you don't believe me just try it for
[1:54:35] a week
[1:54:36] just just try to write down faithful
[1:54:37] things and just act like you've already
[1:54:39] got it
[1:54:39] god will give it to you amen he abideth
[1:54:42] faithful amen
[1:54:43] amen let's go ahead and stand we'll just
[1:54:45] sing that song if you don't mind we'll
[1:54:46] sing that song keep on the fire in line
[1:54:48] amen i was really concerned you know
[1:54:50] with what i was going to preach and
[1:54:52] i just knew in my heart when she started
[1:54:54] singing that song and i'd already
