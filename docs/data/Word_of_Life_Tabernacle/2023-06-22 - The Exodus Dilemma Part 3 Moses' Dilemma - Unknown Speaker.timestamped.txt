[35:41] . thank you for the music tonight we
[35:43] always
[35:44] always challenging when we use the
[35:47] backups and then the backups of the
[35:49] backups but tonight we had uh sister
[35:52] Allison and sister Noli up here and just
[35:54] good to see that God's got more people
[35:57] than just uh just a few that can do
[36:00] those jobs and I'm thankful for that and
[36:03] we want to encourage our younger ones to
[36:05] come along I really see a great future
[36:08] in our music and the things that we're
[36:10] doing we lost or we had some speakers
[36:13] that messed up so just bear with the
[36:16] sound tonight as they try to work that
[36:18] out and we'll have to get some new house
[36:20] speakers
[36:21] you know we could do without electronics
[36:24] if we wanted to bad or nothing it'd be
[36:27] okay
[36:27] be okay I'm loud enough and you could
[36:30] listen close enough but we won't we
[36:32] won't do that tonight Hebrews 11 24
[36:34] is it good to be in the house of the
[36:36] Lord on a Wednesday night
[36:39] Hebrews 11 24 by faith Moses
[36:42] when he was come to years refused to be
[36:45] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[36:49] to oozing rather to suffer Affliction
[36:52] with the people of God
[36:54] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[36:57] season
[36:58] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[37:01] riches than the treasures in Egypt
[37:04] for he had respect unto the recompense
[37:08] of the reward pray the Lord would add
[37:10] his Blessing to the word I want to
[37:11] continue to talk to you as you're seated
[37:14] I want to continue to talk to you about
[37:16] the Exodus family
[37:19] and we're going to talk about Moses
[37:21] dilemma so we talked about amram's
[37:23] dilemma his dilemma was would he work or
[37:26] would he uh would he pray and he did
[37:29] both and and that's what Satan tries to
[37:32] do today is get us so involved in our
[37:34] work and the things that are going on we
[37:36] don't have time to pray we don't have
[37:38] time to work for the Lord but amram did
[37:41] both because the situation required that
[37:44] we found that djokabed had a dilemma
[37:47] that her dilemma was she had to give up
[37:51] her child she had to commit it to the
[37:52] Lord It's safety and and in rearing the
[37:55] child and yet we found that God had a
[37:58] plan for Moses and and we believe our
[38:00] children God has a plan for them and
[38:02] we've got to give them up sometimes to
[38:05] let God do what he does but aren't you
[38:07] glad he's a big God and and we found
[38:10] even that the Angels lined the sides of
[38:13] the river and and god Jehovah himself at
[38:17] the end waiting on the little ask it to
[38:19] get down to that place because it was a
[38:22] predestined a child that was in the boat
[38:24] and I believe that our children are the
[38:27] same
[38:28] so God's going to keep them God's going
[38:30] to help him and and so that was her
[38:32] dilemma though was whether to give him
[38:34] up and and now Moses says he began to
[38:37] grow how to dilemma he had a choice to
[38:40] make
[38:41] and I want to speak to you tonight and
[38:43] and especially to you younger ones
[38:46] because your choices impact more of your
[38:49] life but even the older ones if we can
[38:52] make good choices today to make up for
[38:54] some of the bad choices we've made in
[38:56] the past and and it'll still have an
[38:59] impact but especially when you're young
[39:01] your choice that you make when you're
[39:03] very very young has has such an impact
[39:06] because if the Lord tarries and you
[39:08] continue on eventually eventually that
[39:11] that's gonna that's gonna impact a great
[39:14] portion of your life
[39:15] you got to make a choice
[39:18] I read somewhere that the great tenor
[39:21] Pavarotti I don't know if anyone's heard
[39:23] of him but I like to listen to him sing
[39:26] just a an admission there he's a
[39:29] classical tenor and he at one time he
[39:33] didn't know what he was going to do with
[39:35] his life and
[39:36] and his father had actually encouraged
[39:39] him to uh to go to school and so he
[39:43] enrolled in in music school and then he
[39:46] also enrolled in a teacher's college
[39:49] and when he did that he he graduated
[39:52] from both and he asked his father he
[39:54] said should I be a teacher or a singer
[39:57] and his father replied son if you try to
[40:00] sit on two chairs you'll fall between
[40:03] them
[40:05] isn't that true
[40:07] if you try to sit on two chairs you'll
[40:09] fall between them he said what you
[40:11] choose now would will determine what
[40:14] you'll be he said for life you must
[40:16] choose one chair and we've got to choose
[40:19] today what God God's way or the Devils
[40:23] we've got to choose the word or the
[40:26] world and and I trust that you'll choose
[40:28] and that you have chosen the word today
[40:30] and that's why you're here brother
[40:32] Branham tells us this he says you are
[40:34] today what you are because several years
[40:36] ago you chose to be what you are now
[40:40] and what you choose now will determine
[40:42] what you'll be five years from today I
[40:47] see people sometimes in in a terrible
[40:49] circumstance of life and they're
[40:51] struggling to make it they're struggling
[40:52] to to make ends meet maybe and they're
[40:55] struggling and it's choices and and
[40:58] maybe if they would if they could just
[40:59] make the right choice today and I see
[41:01] them pass by that choice and you think
[41:03] oh God if they would just make a move
[41:05] for God we see young people come up in
[41:08] the church and you think if they would
[41:09] just make a move how different their
[41:11] life could be and when you see them
[41:12] refuse to make that move then eventually
[41:15] they they end up out in the world and
[41:17] and you see the the struggle in their
[41:19] life and you see the trouble you think
[41:21] oh if you'd have just moved for God at a
[41:24] young age if you just got to bid down
[41:26] the business with God if you'd have just
[41:28] got serious while you were young
[41:30] things might have been different
[41:34] so this is especially true as I said for
[41:37] young people
[41:38] think about a teenager right we've got a
[41:40] few teenagers here tonight and and I'm
[41:43] not don't want to pick on you because
[41:44] there's only a few but
[41:46] when you were when you're 16 years old
[41:49] some of you are not even 16 yet but
[41:52] Peter's 16 and when I was 16 I was
[41:55] living at home
[41:57] I was didn't have a driver's license
[42:00] didn't never had a job in my life
[42:03] as far as in the public
[42:05] and a lot you know life looked you know
[42:08] pretty simple it was pretty simple
[42:11] and five years later when I was 21 I was
[42:15] married so life got complicated
[42:19] I was pastoring a church
[42:22] I had started my career in real estate
[42:24] title and I had a baby boy
[42:28] five years
[42:30] now think about that real carefully just
[42:33] a moment because that's where think
[42:35] about where you could be and how much
[42:37] could change in five years everything
[42:39] could change for that matter everything
[42:40] can change in five minutes
[42:42] but even absent some cataclysmic event
[42:45] or or some tragedy happening in your
[42:47] life things could be completely
[42:49] different five years from now than they
[42:51] are right now
[42:53] look how much the world changed over the
[42:55] last 5 10 15 years you don't have to go
[42:57] back very far to find that things were
[42:59] different and some of you could testify
[43:01] to that tonight things were different
[43:03] just a few years ago what could we be in
[43:06] five years
[43:07] in five years you could be a missionary
[43:09] or a bartender
[43:13] brother Branham tells the Sadi you could
[43:15] be a Godly mother or a prostitute
[43:18] you could be in the tribulation or the
[43:20] rapture
[43:23] you're going to be in one
[43:25] one or the other and Moses had that
[43:28] choice to make he had to he had to make
[43:30] his own choice
[43:32] his parents had kept him Alive by faith
[43:35] and I think some of us were kept Alive
[43:37] by the faith of our parents
[43:40] his parents literally kept him Alive by
[43:42] Faith by faith they hid him from Pharaoh
[43:45] by faith they kept him alive and many of
[43:48] us owe our spiritual life growing up to
[43:51] the godliness of our parents and the
[43:53] work of our parents and and the things
[43:55] that they did and they had kept him
[43:57] alive in that way their choices had
[43:59] given him an opportunity to make his own
[44:01] choice but now it was his turn
[44:04] it was his turn to make a choice
[44:07] and in Exodus chapter 2 we find where we
[44:10] left off last week in verse 5 the
[44:13] daughter of pharaoh come down to wash
[44:14] herself at the river and her maidens
[44:16] walked Along by the river's side when
[44:18] she saw the ark among the flags she sent
[44:20] her maid to fetch it so this is God's
[44:22] provision for Moses life and verse 6
[44:25] when she had opened it she saw the child
[44:27] Behold The Babe wept
[44:29] and she had compassion on him even a
[44:32] crying child was in the mind of God was
[44:34] in the plan of God so that she would
[44:37] have compassion on him and said this is
[44:39] one of the Hebrews children God arranged
[44:42] it and then verse 7 then said his sister
[44:44] to Pharaoh's daughter shall I go and
[44:46] call the uh to the nurse of the Hebrew
[44:49] women that she may nurse the child for
[44:51] thee and Pharaoh's daughter said to her
[44:53] go and the maid went and called the
[44:54] child's mother and Pharaoh's daughter
[44:57] said unto her take the child away and
[44:58] nurse it for me and I will give thee thy
[45:00] wages and brother Brown says here here
[45:03] was his own mother she was going to get
[45:04] paid to watch him
[45:07] he said she gonna get paid 300 a week
[45:09] it's probably a lot of money back then
[45:11] and brother when brother Brandon said
[45:13] that but say a high sum of money she was
[45:15] going to get paid to be a nanny to her
[45:17] own child
[45:18] God's able to do that kind of thing
[45:21] and so and the child the woman took the
[45:24] child and nursed it and the Bible says
[45:26] the child grew
[45:28] as all children do
[45:30] and she brought him into Pharaoh's
[45:32] daughter and he became her son and what
[45:35] that means is he was formally adopted
[45:37] into Pharaoh's family
[45:40] uh this is this is important to
[45:43] understand the the saddest that Moses
[45:46] would have gotten from being adopted
[45:48] into this family it'd be like winning
[45:50] the lottery
[45:52] you think about it he he had nothing he
[45:56] was a come from a slaves family
[45:59] I mean joke about we're just trying to
[46:01] make it work they were doing the very
[46:03] best they could to try to make it work
[46:05] and they had nothing but here he had
[46:08] been adopted into the family of pharaoh
[46:11] and when he was adopted into the family
[46:13] he had everything
[46:15] everything he could have ever wanted
[46:19] now and it says he become her son she
[46:22] called his name Moses she said because I
[46:23] drew him out of the water
[46:25] for Moses mother I'd like to say this
[46:28] must have been almost as hard as
[46:30] committing him to the river
[46:32] because now she had to give him back to
[46:34] Pharaoh's house
[46:36] and he was young we don't know how old
[46:38] some commentators say three years old
[46:40] some say he was older but I think he was
[46:43] old enough to know who he was
[46:45] I think his mother had something to do
[46:48] with that that she taught him when he
[46:50] was young who he was and that he was not
[46:53] just an Egyptian but he was a child of
[46:56] the King and I think we ought to teach
[46:58] our children that way that they're not
[47:00] just an Egyptian they're not just a an
[47:02] American they're not aware of a
[47:04] different culture a different world and
[47:06] so she's constantly maybe finding ways
[47:08] to point out to her child you are not
[47:11] who they say you are
[47:13] you don't belong to the world you belong
[47:15] to God
[47:17] and so if they as he grew older and and
[47:21] he was in Pharaoh's house
[47:23] it come to pass it says in those days
[47:25] when Moses was grown
[47:28] when he was grown
[47:30] he went out into his brethren
[47:32] and see that this tells us that she
[47:34] taught him something about who he was or
[47:36] somehow he found out because he went to
[47:39] his Brethren he knew they were his
[47:41] brethren
[47:43] and looked on their burdens and he spied
[47:47] an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew
[47:50] one of his brethren
[47:52] now at this point Moses would have been
[47:54] almost 40 years old
[47:56] but he's still considered a young man
[47:59] thank the Lord
[48:02] he but he made he made a choice
[48:05] at that age
[48:07] made a choice to be identified
[48:10] oh church it's not too late for you if
[48:13] you're almost 40 or if you're almost 50
[48:16] for almost 60. you're still young enough
[48:18] to make a choice
[48:21] to follow Christ
[48:22] and he was young enough to make a choice
[48:24] he made a choice a conscious decision
[48:27] that's what the Bible says by faith
[48:29] Moses chose
[48:32] the affliction
[48:33] shows he had the opportunity to be an
[48:37] Egyptian prince he had the opportunity
[48:39] to have everything handed to him on a
[48:41] silver platter to live better than
[48:43] billionaires do today
[48:45] to be in among the family and among the
[48:48] people that ruled the world he had an
[48:51] opportunity to rule or an opportunity to
[48:54] be a safe
[48:56] and he chose to be a Slave
[48:59] oh God he made a choice to be identified
[49:02] to look on their burdens to be
[49:05] identified with slaves oh church can you
[49:08] hear me tonight that's the choice that
[49:10] the world thinks you're making they see
[49:12] what you do and how you come to the
[49:14] house of God on a Wednesday night and
[49:16] they say how could you possibly make
[49:17] that choice to be identified with the
[49:19] message of the hour how could you
[49:21] possibly make that choice to be
[49:23] identified with the Holiness lifestyle
[49:24] how could you possibly make that choice
[49:27] to be a son or daughter of God are you
[49:28] hearing me tonight how could you
[49:30] possibly make that choice but brother
[49:32] Randall said he was looking at something
[49:34] else
[49:35] he wasn't looking at the what they could
[49:37] see he was looking at the Unseen he was
[49:40] looking for the downstairs in one place
[49:42] he was looking at tomorrow
[49:44] oh my
[49:46] well if we could lift our eyes tonight
[49:48] and look at tomorrow you young people
[49:50] your children look at tomorrow
[49:54] I'll just look at today look what you're
[49:57] going to be tomorrow
[49:58] look what's coming down the road don't
[50:01] just look at the pleasure of sin for a
[50:03] season look at tomorrow we want to go to
[50:06] heaven we want to spend some time
[50:07] together in eternity don't just look at
[50:10] the at the world the way that it is or
[50:12] it has a lot to offer but there's so
[50:14] much more if you can look at tomorrow
[50:17] made a choice to be identified
[50:20] with slaves rather than as a prince
[50:23] brother Brandon says my advice to you is
[50:25] don't look at the Modern things around
[50:26] you the popularity and the glamor that
[50:29] you could be but choose rather by faith
[50:33] oh my how many want to choose my faith
[50:35] tonight
[50:36] choose by faith him that give the
[50:38] promise that someday he will come and
[50:40] will right all wrongs and he will give
[50:43] you eternal life and raise you up no
[50:46] matter if you take the despised way with
[50:47] the Lord's few make that choice if
[50:50] there's troubles in the land if there's
[50:53] troubles in the church if there's
[50:54] troubles in the home no matter where it
[50:56] is make your choice
[50:58] by faith I'll serve God
[51:01] and this is why the devil will bring
[51:03] trouble he'll bring trouble he'll he'll
[51:05] bring trouble in your mind because he
[51:07] has access to that it'll bring trouble
[51:09] in your spirit I mean trouble in your
[51:12] family bring trouble in the church why
[51:13] he's trying to make you make the wrong
[51:15] choice
[51:16] he's actively working today to get you
[51:19] to make the wrong choice and to look to
[51:21] the world and to and to go back and say
[51:23] well it would have been easier if we'd
[51:24] have just moved off somewhere and lived
[51:26] our own life and forgot about the church
[51:28] forgot about the people of God but I'd
[51:30] rather be identified with the people of
[51:31] God tonight I'd rather be identified
[51:33] with what the world goes crazy Paul says
[51:36] in the way that's called heresy that's
[51:38] the way I worship the god of my fathers
[51:40] I'd rather humble my heart he says I'll
[51:44] humble my heart in his presence
[51:46] by faith I'll serve God I'll humble my
[51:48] heart and his presence oh could we say
[51:51] that tonight I'll take the way with
[51:53] God's children I see them despised and
[51:56] rejected drove out and made fun of but
[51:58] I'll take my post of Duty
[52:01] I'll stay right by and when they cry
[52:03] I'll cry with them when there's sorrow I
[52:06] shall sorrow with them the way they live
[52:08] I'll live
[52:10] oh my what a commitment that was
[52:13] Hebrews 11 24 by faith Moses when he was
[52:16] come to ears refused to be called the
[52:18] son of Pharaoh's daughter
[52:20] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[52:22] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[52:24] pleasure of sin for a season is steaming
[52:27] the reproach or valuing the reproach of
[52:30] Christ greater riches than the treasures
[52:33] in Egypt we had respect unto the
[52:35] recompense of the reward
[52:37] we find a young man another young man in
[52:39] the scripture a rich young ruler who
[52:42] made the opposite choice in Mark chapter
[52:44] 10 and verse 17 it says when he was gone
[52:47] forth into the wave there came one
[52:49] running I want you to notice the Rich
[52:50] Young Ruler wanted to be a Christian
[52:54] as long as being a Christian didn't cost
[52:56] him his status
[53:00] he wanted to be a Christian as long as
[53:03] being a Christian man he could still do
[53:05] what he always did
[53:07] in fact he was he was willing to live
[53:09] morally but he was not willing to sell
[53:12] out
[53:13] he was willing to keep the Commandments
[53:15] but he was not willing to be identified
[53:17] with Jesus and his disciples
[53:20] who were actually if you think about it
[53:23] a bunch of homeless people
[53:25] wandering around that's what it would
[53:27] have been look what it looked like
[53:29] wandering around Israel cast out made
[53:32] fun of the gospel's always been that way
[53:34] don't think it's strange today people
[53:36] make fun of the message of how they've
[53:38] always done that the gospel's always
[53:40] been downtrodden always been looked bad
[53:42] on it's always been a low class of
[53:44] people brother Branham talked about
[53:45] going into this great big Auditorium and
[53:48] he said that this one man had a meeting
[53:50] there and they let out right before his
[53:51] meeting he said I'm coming out of that
[53:53] meeting was doctors and attorneys and
[53:55] lawyers and everything else there's
[53:56] nothing against those people but that's
[53:58] the class of people this man attracted
[54:00] he said and then my people were waiting
[54:01] to come in he said there were stretchers
[54:03] and insane cases and and all kinds
[54:06] because the sick need a physician yes
[54:08] sir he said I looked at that that's the
[54:10] kind the gospel attract Jesus he thanked
[54:13] the father he said Lord he said I thank
[54:15] you that you've hid these things from
[54:17] the wise and The Prudent and you've
[54:18] revealed it to babes such as would learn
[54:20] that's what I want to be tonight a baby
[54:22] that will learn from God
[54:26] but the Rich Young Ruler didn't want to
[54:28] make that
[54:29] choice
[54:31] I want you to listen to me I know this
[54:33] is simple
[54:35] but
[54:36] we've got children better to make the
[54:38] choice at five
[54:40] or six or seven or ten or 15 then to
[54:45] wait till you're 40.
[54:49] better to make the choice when you're 40
[54:51] than when you're 50.
[54:53] that's why the scripture said today is
[54:55] the day of salvation
[54:57] now is the accepted time oh how we ought
[55:00] to come to Jesus wherever we see the
[55:03] word revealed in front of us we ought to
[55:04] run to him the Rich Young Ruler ran to
[55:07] him but he wasn't willing to give
[55:08] anything up we ought to run to him and
[55:10] say Lord take away everything that's
[55:12] unlike you strip away anything that I
[55:14] need I don't need Lord take it take it
[55:16] away from me make me totally dependent
[55:19] on you
[55:23] he run he said good Master what shall I
[55:25] do that I may inherit eternal life
[55:27] Luke said this this young man was a
[55:29] ruler
[55:31] another Young Prince
[55:33] and Jesus said unto him why call us thou
[55:36] me good there's none good but one that
[55:38] is God
[55:39] I Think Jesus is trying to make him
[55:41] think here
[55:43] why are you calling me good
[55:45] because you don't evidently the young
[55:47] man didn't recognize fully who he was
[55:49] coming to
[55:51] or he'd have did what he told him to do
[55:55] verse 19 says Thou knowest the
[55:57] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[55:59] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[56:02] witness the fraud not honor thy father
[56:04] and mother
[56:06] and he answered and said unto him master
[56:08] all these have observed from my youth
[56:11] been a good boy stayed in church I did
[56:14] all the right things
[56:16] and Jesus beholding him loved him
[56:19] we thought well that that he's in now
[56:22] Jesus loves you
[56:24] but you've got to love Jesus
[56:28] Jesus Loves You Jesus loved the world
[56:31] for God so loved the world that he gave
[56:35] his only begotten son Jesus loves you
[56:39] you gotta love him
[56:41] he cares but you've got to care
[56:45] one thing you lack he said go your way
[56:48] sell whatever you have give to the poor
[56:50] and thou shalt have treasure in heaven
[56:51] and come take up the cross
[56:54] and follow me
[56:56] you had a choice to make and he made the
[56:58] wrong one Mark 10 22 he was sad at that
[57:00] saying and went away grieved for he had
[57:02] great possessions
[57:04] brother Branham says this he said now
[57:06] just religion won't work
[57:08] this one Young Ruler here he said good
[57:10] Master he said now remember before I say
[57:13] it he'd been taught to walk right
[57:15] he had a good education he had been
[57:18] taught business and was rich and was a
[57:20] ruler and had religion
[57:22] but he was confronted with another
[57:24] problem and it confronts all of us
[57:27] eternal life
[57:29] religion doesn't give us eternal life
[57:32] are you hearing me kids maybe some of
[57:34] the young people can say Amen
[57:36] religion doesn't give us a thank you
[57:38] religion doesn't give us eternal life
[57:41] religion doesn't give us eternal life
[57:43] religious is a covering but it doesn't
[57:45] give us eternal life
[57:46] [Music]
[57:48] and yet him taught with the best
[57:49] teachers there was he was yet lacking
[57:52] something I believe that you've got the
[57:54] best teachers that there are Godly
[57:55] Parents I believe he got the best
[57:57] Ministry I'm not talking about myself
[57:58] but I believe the ministry in the Earth
[58:00] today is the best it's ever been
[58:02] I believe we have the best message that
[58:04] we've ever had
[58:06] I believe this end time message is the
[58:08] fullness of of God expressed to the
[58:10] people he showed himself to us but we've
[58:12] got to make a choice
[58:15] your teacher isn't enough you're who you
[58:17] say you believe in isn't enough
[58:19] religion isn't enough
[58:21] religion is a covering but it doesn't
[58:23] give us eternal life him taught what the
[58:24] best teachers there was he was yet
[58:26] lacking something and the young man knew
[58:28] it because he said good Master what can
[58:30] I do to inherit eternal life
[58:34] but the Brotherhood said he was well
[58:35] equipped for life
[58:37] now we want our children to be equipped
[58:39] for life don't we
[58:41] that's a constant it's constantly in the
[58:44] back of my mind I want my children to be
[58:45] equipped for life
[58:47] I want them to be able to do better than
[58:49] I did
[58:50] And yet when it comes to the gospel you
[58:53] can't do any better than I did because I
[58:55] Found Jesus
[58:57] right but I want to equip them for life
[58:59] this young man was equipped for life
[59:02] and he said the way his father and
[59:04] mother and the priests and all them had
[59:05] equipped him but still he knew he was
[59:08] lacking something
[59:10] and brother Brown said now I'm talking
[59:11] to the adults
[59:14] I wonder sometimes if we're lacking
[59:16] something
[59:17] we found Something to Believe In but
[59:19] have we found eternal life
[59:21] we found a Doctrine but have we found
[59:23] life
[59:25] we may have even found a prophet but
[59:27] have we found life
[59:30] religion won't cut it
[59:33] we need life
[59:36] religion won't produce eternal life
[59:39] he said forms Sensations you feel
[59:42] something he said you could get scared
[59:44] and feel something
[59:45] crying that's good shouting that's good
[59:48] but that still ain't it you are
[59:49] confronted with eternal life
[59:53] you say well I've been a staunch Baptist
[59:55] or Methodist or Presbyterian or
[59:57] Pentecostal he said that still isn't the
[1:00:00] question
[1:00:01] I've been a good member of Word of Life
[1:00:03] Tabernacle that still isn't the question
[1:00:05] do you have eternal life
[1:00:11] I think of the question I think of the
[1:00:14] the story rather of of the the one who's
[1:00:18] coming Christian who's coming in in the
[1:00:21] book A pilgrimage progress as he's
[1:00:23] coming out of the city where he was born
[1:00:26] in the city where his wife and children
[1:00:28] were and behind him there was his
[1:00:30] children crying out to him saying come
[1:00:32] back
[1:00:33] and it's business associates crying out
[1:00:36] to him saying come back come back here
[1:00:38] you're crazy why are you setting off on
[1:00:40] this road and behind him was his own
[1:00:42] wife
[1:00:43] crying come back why are you why are you
[1:00:45] sitting on this road and and it and it
[1:00:47] it made it where he couldn't hardly
[1:00:49] stand it so he covered up his ears
[1:00:52] and he ran towards the Gate of salvation
[1:00:56] and he said life life I must have life
[1:01:01] I must tell God if we can only do that
[1:01:04] tonight if we could only when we're
[1:01:06] young while we have time while we have a
[1:01:08] future that we can we can run towards
[1:01:10] the Gate of Salvation I must have life I
[1:01:12] don't care what people think about me I
[1:01:14] don't care what they're going to say
[1:01:16] about me tomorrow I don't care what they
[1:01:17] say about me down the road I must have
[1:01:20] life
[1:01:21] you run screaming life I must have life
[1:01:26] amen this young man was taught the
[1:01:29] religion of the day
[1:01:31] but he still didn't have eternal life
[1:01:34] so he wanted to know what to do
[1:01:37] brother Brown said he had been guided
[1:01:39] successful to this
[1:01:41] and I believe that we successfully many
[1:01:43] times guide our children to eternal life
[1:01:46] that's we have the tools to do that
[1:01:49] we had been guided to the one who could
[1:01:52] help him who could give him eternal life
[1:01:55] but when he was confronted with it he
[1:01:57] refused to be guided to eternal life or
[1:01:59] to be led
[1:02:01] you're always going to be led by
[1:02:03] something
[1:02:05] right you led by your teacher you led by
[1:02:07] your parents you're led by your pastor
[1:02:10] but they can only take you so far
[1:02:13] you got to be led ultimately by Christ
[1:02:17] I can only do so much for you by
[1:02:19] counseling with you
[1:02:21] I can only affect your future so much by
[1:02:25] standing here in the pulpit and trying
[1:02:26] to be the model of what a pastor ought
[1:02:28] to be I can do my very best and be
[1:02:31] successful in that but you have got to
[1:02:33] be led by Christ
[1:02:37] brother Brown making such a powerful
[1:02:38] statement in the message leadership you
[1:02:40] you ought to go listen to it sometime
[1:02:42] because he's standing in a place where
[1:02:44] the leadership was bad
[1:02:47] and he's standing telling those people
[1:02:49] you don't you can't accept human
[1:02:51] leadership you've got to accept Christ
[1:02:53] in just a few a couple months after that
[1:02:55] he would go off the scene
[1:02:57] we must have Christ
[1:03:00] he said you've got to face one thing
[1:03:04] he said he'd been guided successful to
[1:03:07] this he got to face one thing eternal
[1:03:09] life there's only one person who can
[1:03:11] give that to you mama can't give it to
[1:03:13] you Papa can't give it to you because if
[1:03:16] we could we would
[1:03:19] right if I could take and hand my
[1:03:22] children eternal life by handing them a
[1:03:25] Bible I would do it
[1:03:27] I've given them a Bible if I could hand
[1:03:30] them eternal life by hand them a tape I
[1:03:31] would do it I've given them a tape
[1:03:34] if I could do it by handing them a book
[1:03:35] I would do it I've given them a book but
[1:03:37] Jason it's got to be more than that
[1:03:40] huh it's got to be something in your
[1:03:42] soul
[1:03:43] it's got to mean something to you
[1:03:47] it's got to be a reality in your life
[1:03:53] to be led it's not just children Church
[1:03:57] we all sometimes refuse to be led
[1:04:01] what is Christ here's the word are we
[1:04:04] willing to be led by the word when it
[1:04:06] comes to a decision in her life a
[1:04:08] dilemma that we have to face are we
[1:04:10] willing to take what the word says
[1:04:13] huh
[1:04:15] and say I have to have life
[1:04:17] I must have life
[1:04:21] he said
[1:04:23] he said mama can't give it to you papa
[1:04:25] can't give it to you your pastor can't
[1:04:27] give it to you
[1:04:29] how I wish that I could
[1:04:32] but we every chair in here would be full
[1:04:34] if I could give people eternal life
[1:04:41] if I could give eternal life there'd be
[1:04:44] no
[1:04:45] lost loved ones out there
[1:04:48] can't do that
[1:04:50] say Well it goes from bride to bride it
[1:04:52] does by the preaching of the Gospel
[1:04:54] Peter had the keys and he told them how
[1:04:56] to how to come but they still had to
[1:04:58] come
[1:04:59] they have to have their own experience
[1:05:02] and if I could hand you eternal life I
[1:05:04] would do it
[1:05:05] he said Your Leader here can't give it
[1:05:07] to you everybody that gets eternal life
[1:05:10] has got to come to Jesus Christ someone
[1:05:12] say Amen
[1:05:13] everybody that gets eternal life has got
[1:05:15] to come to Jesus Christ he is the only
[1:05:17] one who can give that part the Bible
[1:05:19] says there's one mediator between God
[1:05:21] and man the man Christ Jesus
[1:05:27] your teacher can give you an education
[1:05:30] she can teach you you have to learn it
[1:05:32] your mother can teach you to walk but
[1:05:34] you have to learn how to walk your
[1:05:36] father can teach you how to be a
[1:05:37] businessman or what you have to learn
[1:05:39] that he said but only Jesus can give you
[1:05:41] eternal life
[1:05:43] your priest your leader and so forth can
[1:05:45] teach you your religion you can learn
[1:05:47] the message
[1:05:51] you can learn the message that we are
[1:05:53] trying to teach
[1:05:55] but still that won't give you eternal
[1:05:57] life
[1:05:58] you've got to accept the person
[1:06:01] Jesus Christ
[1:06:03] he said you understand that all of you
[1:06:05] you've got to accept the person Jesus
[1:06:06] Christ to have eternal life he said now
[1:06:08] but sometimes other leadership listen
[1:06:10] this is key sometimes other leadership
[1:06:13] gets so much influence on us
[1:06:16] till we don't know what to do then when
[1:06:19] that time comes
[1:06:22] other leadership gets so much influence
[1:06:24] on us that we think we're okay
[1:06:27] we turn away from Christ we should never
[1:06:30] do that but turn to Christ
[1:06:33] it was Lot who chose the well-watered
[1:06:35] plains of Sodom
[1:06:37] imagine that that was a no-brainer to
[1:06:40] lot
[1:06:41] I mean he's been struggling up here with
[1:06:43] Abraham for a while he doesn't think
[1:06:45] Abraham's got it a very good thing going
[1:06:47] on all the people are fighting and
[1:06:49] fussing and having a hard time with
[1:06:51] their flocks and their herds and he
[1:06:53] looks down here and and all these years
[1:06:55] Abraham refused to compromise and go
[1:06:57] down to Sodom
[1:06:59] and Sodom the Bible says Sodom was like
[1:07:02] the Garden of Eden we live in Satan's
[1:07:05] Eden today
[1:07:07] Sodom was like the Garden of Eden it was
[1:07:09] well watered everywhere
[1:07:11] you imagine living in a place like
[1:07:13] Arizona and you look down there and you
[1:07:15] see a Great Plain and it's filled with
[1:07:17] it's well watered and it's beautiful in
[1:07:19] its green and so well I got I got herds
[1:07:21] I've got I could plant crops or whatever
[1:07:24] I I could all I had to do is go down
[1:07:26] there
[1:07:27] and Abraham never went
[1:07:29] and so Abraham gives lot his choice he
[1:07:32] said you can go one place to the other
[1:07:34] wherever you go I'll go the opposite way
[1:07:37] and law says well that's a no-brainer
[1:07:39] I'll go down to Sodom
[1:07:41] yeah I'll be all right yeah there's some
[1:07:43] there's some stuff going on down there
[1:07:45] I've heard about some stuff but yeah you
[1:07:47] know I'm a good man my family is a good
[1:07:50] family we can handle it
[1:07:52] that's a dangerous place
[1:07:55] I've had people tell me brother Ben I
[1:07:57] can handle it and I always grieve when
[1:07:58] they tell me that
[1:08:00] I can handle it no you can't
[1:08:03] you think you can
[1:08:05] but you can't handle it if it's if it's
[1:08:06] against the word
[1:08:09] see Abraham looked at the land and he's
[1:08:12] something different
[1:08:16] he saw that that that judgment would
[1:08:19] come on the land of Sodom but in the
[1:08:22] land of Israel there was a future
[1:08:25] oh we've got to see the same thing
[1:08:26] someone said to choose the beginning of
[1:08:29] a road is to also choose its end
[1:08:32] right right but you can't choose just
[1:08:34] based on what it looks like at the
[1:08:36] beginning well this looks like a better
[1:08:37] Road it might look like a better road
[1:08:39] but what is it at the end
[1:08:41] what's at the end of the road
[1:08:44] and the end of sodom's road was fire and
[1:08:46] brimstone the end of sodom's road was a
[1:08:49] pillar of salt
[1:08:52] saw himself becoming mayor of the city
[1:08:56] but brother Branham taught us he could
[1:08:57] not see the destruction of his family
[1:09:01] oh God oh if we could as as men as as
[1:09:04] husbands if we could stand and begin to
[1:09:07] look what what is our family going to be
[1:09:09] like
[1:09:11] what's it going to be like if we go this
[1:09:13] way
[1:09:14] he did not see his wife becoming a
[1:09:16] pillar of salt
[1:09:18] he could not see his daughters getting
[1:09:19] him drunk
[1:09:22] when you look at the future of America
[1:09:24] what do you see
[1:09:25] there ain't much
[1:09:28] I think we can see with prophetic eyes
[1:09:30] today I think a prophet is coming to
[1:09:32] state has lifting us he's gone over the
[1:09:34] fence and looked and said there's
[1:09:36] destruction coming to the land of
[1:09:37] America
[1:09:39] nothing he said but but chaos nothing
[1:09:42] but Atomic fodder we look at the future
[1:09:45] of America we see judgment
[1:09:47] because we look through the eyes of a
[1:09:49] prophet in this day with eagle eyes we
[1:09:52] see judgment but what can you see when
[1:09:54] you look at your future
[1:09:56] you look at your future and say well I'm
[1:09:58] going to be a basketball star I'm going
[1:10:00] to be a quarterback in football and and
[1:10:02] the odds of that are pretty low someone
[1:10:04] ran the odds of that the odds of your
[1:10:06] child becoming a famous or a like an NFL
[1:10:09] player or something like that you'd be
[1:10:11] much better off playing the lottery
[1:10:15] and uh well maybe Jason though he's
[1:10:17] pretty good at baseball
[1:10:21] Matt and he's probably pretty good at
[1:10:22] some sports and some some of the rest of
[1:10:24] you kids you're probably pretty good
[1:10:26] but you got the odds of doing that not
[1:10:29] breaking your bones or or tearing
[1:10:32] something and and failing at that many
[1:10:34] more people try and fail than ever make
[1:10:36] it
[1:10:38] you may see money and fame but God knows
[1:10:40] your future
[1:10:42] can you see beyond that
[1:10:45] I look at some of these I know I'm going
[1:10:47] slow tonight but I just wanted to sink
[1:10:49] in and
[1:10:50] can you see beyond it I look at some of
[1:10:53] the
[1:10:54] you know a lot of people see their
[1:10:55] future as an Instagram star

[1:11:12] and I don't want to laugh at you because
[1:11:14] you might make money doing that what do
[1:11:16] you have to give up
[1:11:19] well you have to give up what do you
[1:11:20] have to wear
[1:11:22] well what do you what do you have to do
[1:11:25] to sell yourself on Instagram
[1:11:28] what do you have to do because you are
[1:11:29] selling yourself that's what an
[1:11:30] influencer is
[1:11:32] salesperson
[1:11:35] and you're selling yourself

[1:11:53] talking about you
[1:11:54] sitting there like my future looks like
[1:11:56] an old Folk's home but
[1:12:00] choices still matter
[1:12:03] you can choose to have a good attitude
[1:12:07] you can choose to love the Lord with all
[1:12:09] of your heart you can choose to be an
[1:12:10] example to the young people and show up
[1:12:12] at church
[1:12:13] right you can float in on a fire bed of
[1:12:16] ease or you can choose to pick up pick
[1:12:19] up your cross and follow Jesus
[1:12:22] you look at your future what do you see
[1:12:24] can you see beyond the
[1:12:26] the fame of today I I'll be honest with
[1:12:28] you I look at some of these people I see
[1:12:30] pity
[1:12:31] I have pity for them
[1:12:32] I
[1:12:34] I wouldn't trade my place I wouldn't
[1:12:36] want my daughter to trade her place if
[1:12:38] my daughter ends up just being a
[1:12:39] housewife and she may she may not ever
[1:12:41] get married I pray that she doesn't
[1:12:43] actually
[1:12:45] just in case anybody was wondering I'm
[1:12:47] praying that she doesn't get married
[1:12:49] saying that for the for the listening
[1:12:52] audience
[1:12:54] my daughter is is only 14 years old but
[1:12:57] you know what if she if she does and
[1:12:59] becomes a housewife and that's all she
[1:13:01] ever is I say that's a big job I say
[1:13:04] it's a pretty rare job I wouldn't want
[1:13:06] her to trade places with Kim Kardashian
[1:13:09] some of y'all know who that is
[1:13:11] I wouldn't want her to trade places with
[1:13:13] one of these country stars or or rock
[1:13:15] and roll Stars it's empty
[1:13:18] fake
[1:13:20] the whole world's gone that way
[1:13:22] but here we have love and joy and peace
[1:13:24] I want them to I want them to have the
[1:13:26] kind of life I've had and how can they
[1:13:27] have that only by accepting eternal life
[1:13:33] see can you see beyond see the Bible
[1:13:35] says that the works the day of the Lord
[1:13:37] will come as the thief in the night in
[1:13:38] which the heavens shall pass away the
[1:13:40] great noise and the elements you met
[1:13:42] with fervent heat the Earth also and the
[1:13:44] works that are therein that's all the
[1:13:47] social media all the sports all the
[1:13:50] stuff that you might want to be in your
[1:13:51] life is going to be burned up
[1:13:55] all of it is
[1:13:58] all the works are getting burned up
[1:14:01] he said seeing then that all these
[1:14:03] things shall be dissolved someone say
[1:14:04] all
[1:14:05] all these things should be dissolved
[1:14:07] what manner of persons ought you to be
[1:14:08] in all holy conversation lifestyle and
[1:14:11] godliness looking for and Hasting unto
[1:14:14] the coming of the day of God wherein the
[1:14:16] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[1:14:18] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:14:19] Heat
[1:14:20] with Ruth who also made a right choice
[1:14:22] when she told Naomi she said don't even
[1:14:25] treat me not to leave thee return from
[1:14:27] following after thee whether thou goest
[1:14:29] I will go where thou largest I will
[1:14:31] Lodge thy people shall be my people that
[1:14:33] God will be my God where thou will I die
[1:14:36] and there will I be buried the Lord do
[1:14:38] so to me and more also if ought but
[1:14:40] death party in me listen she didn't go
[1:14:42] with the majority there is not a book of
[1:14:45] orpha in the Bible
[1:14:48] right there's a book of Ruth
[1:14:51] and there's a reason why there's not a
[1:14:53] book of orpa Ruth took the harder Road
[1:14:57] Ruth chose to go with Naomi
[1:14:59] don't look what the majority does
[1:15:01] following the crowd is easy
[1:15:03] cattle move in herds we're not cattle
[1:15:06] that's the Psalm of Life the old poem
[1:15:08] says don't be like dumb driven cattle
[1:15:12] driven by every every wind of of desire
[1:15:16] and every every fear or desire cattle
[1:15:19] are driven by fear and desire for food
[1:15:22] and they all move together
[1:15:24] and that's the world that we live in
[1:15:26] people are driven by their basis desires
[1:15:29] but somebody has to be different
[1:15:32] somebody's got to be driven by their
[1:15:34] their desire for God
[1:15:37] you know
[1:15:38] they found that when you take sheep are
[1:15:41] you still with me tonight
[1:15:43] if you take sheep and you put them in a
[1:15:45] pasture that their sheep herders have
[1:15:48] found that coyotes will come and they'll
[1:15:50] just wait and because the Sheep always
[1:15:52] stay in a herd and what they'll do is
[1:15:54] they'll they'll pick them off one at a
[1:15:56] time because what sheep do is they're
[1:15:58] driven by Fear And when they see the
[1:16:00] coyote they have no natural defense so
[1:16:01] they kind of bunch together and and and
[1:16:04] and and and it's good that they Bunch
[1:16:06] together but every once in a while
[1:16:07] straggler will come along and the coyote
[1:16:08] just eats it and and he he just hangs
[1:16:10] out with the Sheep
[1:16:12] eating little sheep but you know what
[1:16:14] they did to fix that they put llamas in
[1:16:17] the herd
[1:16:18] and a llama doesn't run from a coyote
[1:16:22] the coyote can't keep him herded up
[1:16:25] coyote will come after sheep and
[1:16:27] actually hurt the Sheep
[1:16:28] and get them to go in the wrong
[1:16:30] direction
[1:16:31] but uh but a llama will actually walk up
[1:16:34] is what I've been told we'll walk into
[1:16:35] the face of the county and look at it
[1:16:40] and the coyote not being a very big or
[1:16:43] impressive dog
[1:16:45] he he don't even want to try it
[1:16:48] the coyote might be able to hurt Aloma
[1:16:50] but he don't even want to try because
[1:16:52] Alum is different you don't go with the
[1:16:54] hurt he just walks right up
[1:16:56] and face him he don't have any fear
[1:16:58] that's the way we ought to be
[1:17:00] we ought to walk right in the face of
[1:17:02] the devil the Bible says resist the
[1:17:03] devil he'll flee from you
[1:17:05] resist the devil that's the way we ought
[1:17:07] to be listen Daniel made a choice to
[1:17:09] either diet of vegetables and water
[1:17:11] that's a choice right there
[1:17:14] that's difficult he had a opportunity to
[1:17:16] drink wine and eat red meat and you
[1:17:19] chose vegetables and water because it
[1:17:21] was God's word for that day I'm glad
[1:17:23] it's not today
[1:17:26] but he had a choice to feed on the world
[1:17:28] or on the message we could put it that
[1:17:29] way
[1:17:30] Daniel saw that he would be better off
[1:17:33] doing things God's way he's soft
[1:17:35] tomorrow
[1:17:36] the three Hebrew children made a choice
[1:17:38] to not bow to the image they chose fire
[1:17:40] over the worship of a false god because
[1:17:43] they saw it tomorrow
[1:17:45] and they said in Daniel 3 16 Shadrach
[1:17:48] Meshach and Abednego answered and said
[1:17:50] to the king old Nebuchadnezzar we are
[1:17:52] not careful to answer thee in this
[1:17:53] matter said we don't even have to think
[1:17:55] about it
[1:17:56] if it be so our God whom we serve is
[1:17:59] able to deliver us do you believe that
[1:18:01] tonight he's able to Deliver Us From The
[1:18:03] Burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:18:05] deliver us out of thine hand O King but
[1:18:07] if not be it known unto the O King we
[1:18:09] will not serve thy Gods nor worship the
[1:18:11] golden image which thou Hast set up
[1:18:14] the Fourth Man showed up in the fire
[1:18:16] because they looked at the Unseen
[1:18:19] most people choose pleasure over
[1:18:21] suffering I do you know what I choose
[1:18:24] pleasure over suffering many times you
[1:18:26] know why we do that how we do that we
[1:18:27] choose our easy chair
[1:18:30] right that's the Natural Choice
[1:18:33] the easy chair not go to the gym or walk
[1:18:36] right the Natural Choice is to choose
[1:18:38] pleasure over suffering but when it
[1:18:40] comes to the things of God we're going
[1:18:43] to choose differently
[1:18:45] what a foolish thing the young men of
[1:18:47] his day must have thought when Moses
[1:18:49] chose to take his place with The
[1:18:51] Afflicted and suffering people of God
[1:18:52] why did he do it by faith when he lifted
[1:18:55] up his eyes he looked beyond the glamor
[1:18:57] of this world he looked beyond the
[1:18:58] pleasures of sin and the Bible said that
[1:19:00] he endured seeing him who was Invisible
[1:19:03] by faith and he made a choice to serve
[1:19:05] that God regardless what took place he
[1:19:08] said it has not changed many of us could
[1:19:10] go to what we would call a better
[1:19:11] building we could enjoy the fellowship
[1:19:13] and pleasures of sitting in a better Pew
[1:19:15] we might be more popular to drink and to
[1:19:18] smoke and to dress and act like the
[1:19:19] world but what's the matter you've
[1:19:21] lifted up your eyes and by faith you see
[1:19:24] him who is invisible and have took your
[1:19:26] stand with the rejected and so-called
[1:19:28] Holy Rollers of the day for by faith we
[1:19:30] see him who is invisible choosing to
[1:19:33] suffer the persecutions and the
[1:19:35] affliction
[1:19:37] brother bear said I wouldn't say to
[1:19:38] people they should choose to be
[1:19:40] afflicted
[1:19:41] I don't say that you should choose
[1:19:42] suffering it would not be the human
[1:19:44] thing to do but if suffering lays in the
[1:19:47] path of Duty let's take it as it comes
[1:19:50] I wouldn't say for you to get out here
[1:19:52] and carry on do something that was
[1:19:53] Radical I wouldn't want you to do that
[1:19:55] he said so that somebody would say
[1:19:56] you're a fanatic you bring that on
[1:19:58] yourself but if it lays in the path of
[1:20:01] your duty towards God let the world say
[1:20:03] what they want to say you live on
[1:20:06] what a pharaoh could have saw what Moses
[1:20:08] saw he saw the sufferings of the people
[1:20:10] he knew that what the price was to pay
[1:20:12] but by faith he chose it rather than to
[1:20:15] have the pleasures of sin
[1:20:16] he said and in this Faith walk there
[1:20:18] Comes A Time there has to be a choice
[1:20:20] lot made that sad mistake that we make a
[1:20:23] lot of times we choose for our own good
[1:20:24] we choose things that would be better
[1:20:27] listen he said sometimes if there's a
[1:20:28] little squabble comes in the church
[1:20:30] someone would say well the Deacon or the
[1:20:33] pastor is on this side he said don't
[1:20:34] look at that
[1:20:37] boy it got quiet
[1:20:41] we got to choose
[1:20:43] right what do you choose eternal life
[1:20:45] what's eternal life the word
[1:20:48] amen there's a choosing
[1:20:51] Oh my he said the Deacon of the pastors
[1:20:53] on this side don't look at that look at
[1:20:54] what's righteous
[1:20:56] oh my oh hopefully we would all do that
[1:20:59] tonight get that thing out he said and
[1:21:01] bring them both together that's Godly
[1:21:04] yeah right in other words don't take
[1:21:05] sides bring them together
[1:21:07] it's a choosing
[1:21:08] that we choose for ourself
[1:21:11] we choose something that's for our own
[1:21:12] good Moses chose the afflictions and the
[1:21:16] disgrace and he might walk with the
[1:21:18] people
[1:21:19] of God
[1:21:22] every one of us are going to meet God
[1:21:23] one day I'm closing with this
[1:21:27] there's a famous poem I probably read it
[1:21:29] to you before I love it I like Robert
[1:21:32] Frost is my favorite poet but you did a
[1:21:35] poem called The Road Not Taken it's
[1:21:37] misunderstood
[1:21:39] because he meant it as a joke
[1:21:42] but it has powerful words
[1:21:46] and he wrote it though as a joke for
[1:21:48] another poet
[1:21:50] by the name of Edward Thomas
[1:21:52] whenever they would be out walking in
[1:21:54] the countryside
[1:21:55] Thomas would never could decide what
[1:21:57] road to take you ever met anybody like
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:00] just
[1:22:01] just always to always couldn't make up
[1:22:04] his mind
[1:22:05] and then if you start down a certain
[1:22:06] Road he didn't find you know something
[1:22:09] to look at he'd gripe the whole time he
[1:22:12] was walking down the road man if we went
[1:22:13] down the other way
[1:22:14] we'd have found something
[1:22:17] he never could decide what road to take
[1:22:21] and so the famous poem is two roads
[1:22:23] diverge in a yellow wood and and he
[1:22:26] began to look at him and compare them
[1:22:27] and and then he says it in the end he
[1:22:30] said I shall be telling this with a sigh
[1:22:31] some were ages and ages hence
[1:22:35] two roads diverged in a wood I took the
[1:22:38] One Less Traveled by
[1:22:40] that has made all the difference
[1:22:44] when he wrote this poem it was 1917 or
[1:22:48] 1916 when when the world was at War
[1:22:53] the world rushed to war not the first
[1:22:56] world war was maybe the stupidest War
[1:22:58] all wars are fairly stupid
[1:23:01] but it was maybe the most insane War if
[1:23:03] I could put it that way that there ever
[1:23:05] was was World War One
[1:23:07] because it was just people fighting over
[1:23:10] power
[1:23:12] and some of them didn't even know why
[1:23:13] they were fighting because of alliances
[1:23:15] and things that they had with other
[1:23:16] countries
[1:23:18] and the p and people were just
[1:23:19] slaughtered because technology had went
[1:23:21] beyond tactics and people were just
[1:23:23] being slaughtered on the in no man's
[1:23:25] land in The Killing Fields
[1:23:28] and he sent this poem to his friend
[1:23:31] Edward Thomas and it wasn't but just a
[1:23:34] little while later two months after he
[1:23:37] received it
[1:23:38] that Edward Thomas was killed in battle
[1:23:43] and the World wishes that it would have
[1:23:46] taken a Less Traveled Road
[1:23:48] and just not showed up for the war
[1:23:52] I wonder today if we just because the
[1:23:55] culture is doing it if we just all run
[1:23:57] towards something and we we all just
[1:23:59] well I got to partake in it I got to be
[1:24:01] a part of it what if we just stood back
[1:24:04] to Less Traveled Road
[1:24:09] all of us have to meet God at some point
[1:24:11] and what road we take will have made all
[1:24:14] the difference
[1:24:16] and where we end up
[1:24:18] when you choose the beginning of the
[1:24:20] road you choose the end of the road
[1:24:22] choose in heaven
[1:24:25] you're choosing peace you're choosing
[1:24:28] Glory
[1:24:30] you're choosing that rather than hell
[1:24:32] and hardship
[1:24:34] take the Less Traveled Road not not
[1:24:36] Guided by impulse or whim which is kind
[1:24:38] of the way it is in the poem but by
[1:24:40] faith in the word of God
[1:24:42] I'll take the road that God chooses and
[1:24:45] you bow your heads with me
[1:24:52] I wonder if we could just think about it
[1:24:54] for a moment
[1:24:55] I want you kids to think about it
[1:24:58] where will you go
[1:25:00] if you continue down the road you're on
[1:25:02] if you've never given your heart to
[1:25:04] Christ where will you be
[1:25:08] if you've never come to the one who is
[1:25:12] eternal life maybe some of you older
[1:25:14] ones need to think about it what are you
[1:25:15] going to what's the end of your current
[1:25:17] road
[1:25:18] if you put your trust in theology
[1:25:21] if you put your trust in what a man says
[1:25:23] or have you put your trust in the
[1:25:25] Eternal God
[1:25:27] you can trust the word that's the only
[1:25:29] thing you can trust
[1:25:31] sure can't trust your own mind over the
[1:25:33] word how could we do that
[1:25:36] trust the word
[1:25:38] if you've never given your heart to
[1:25:39] Jesus
[1:25:40] that would be a good time to do that you
[1:25:42] say you can you do that on a Wednesday
[1:25:43] night absolutely

[1:25:49] never maybe you face a decision today a
[1:25:52] quandary
[1:25:53] problem
[1:25:55] a dilemma
[1:25:57] I don't know what to do it seems like
[1:25:58] the Bears in the cave and the bears
[1:26:00] under the tree I I don't know which way
[1:26:02] to go
[1:26:03] there's a way
[1:26:05] there's a way that seems right to a man
[1:26:07] the end thereof is the way of death but
[1:26:08] there is a way truth in life and that is
[1:26:11] Jesus
[1:26:12] follow him
[1:26:14] follow his word it'll be okay
[1:26:16] into the road when you choose this
[1:26:18] beginning the end of the road will be
[1:26:19] okay
[1:26:21] maybe you liked it with every head bowed
[1:26:22] and every eye closed maybe you'd like to
