[40:49] basis and
[40:52] well and others I have three children

[40:56] we couldn't do without you so we're
[40:58] thankful for that
[41:00] for moms and we're going to
[41:03] Loosely associate this this morning to
[41:05] the mother's day but but we're thankful
[41:07] for our moms and then uh it's over
[41:10] Virginia are in the hospital right now
[41:11] and uh
[41:14] told him this church for much but he
[41:17] claimed he wasn't going to miss church
[41:18] for this baby but the baby had other
[41:20] ideas
[41:22] so
[41:25] do you get trouble when you start
[41:27] playing things like that
[41:29] he uh
[41:31] if the baby's born today then that would
[41:34] be a wonderful Mother's Day gift for him
[41:36] and then today is my wife's birthday so
[41:40] happy birthday to Sister Brittany thank
[41:42] you
[41:43] [Applause]
[41:51] a long time we did all a lot of the
[41:53] cleaning and a lot of the
[41:55] a lot of the food and a lot of the
[41:58] Sunday school and different things and
[42:01] some of the rest of you stepped
[42:03] under those things but but my wife just
[42:05] putting up with me is a big deal
[42:08] and
[42:09] graceful somebody said amen too loudly
[42:15] in my life and
[42:17] that is our anniversary so
[42:19] and Esther's birthday was yesterday
[42:21] editor's a big help here and she's all
[42:24] my kids working in church we all just
[42:26] work for you all so yeah
[42:28] we're glad to do it the body of Christ
[42:30] but Esther's birthday she's 14 now and
[42:34] Peter's 16 and all this week
[42:37] and Brittany today and then but Joe
[42:40] waite's having a birthday this week
[42:42] aren't you God bless you brother Joe
[42:43] thankful for all the brother Joe does
[42:45] for the church as well so many birthdays
[42:47] right now my goodness sister Luella I
[42:49] think is having or had a birthday or
[42:51] haven't yesterday so that's a good day
[42:54] to be born on the same day as as Esther
[42:56] so so we're thankful for you too and God
[43:00] bless you all you know you can't have a
[43:01] church without people
[43:03] if you um
[43:05] Wednesday night we had a little bit
[43:07] different we've been preaching on the
[43:08] gifts I did something a little bit
[43:10] different but I noticed how much it
[43:11] raised the faith of the people Wednesday
[43:13] night to watch that little clip of of
[43:16] deep cloth to the deep and it'd be good
[43:18] if you haven't watched that or you
[43:19] weren't here to go back and watch that
[43:21] and God did something in our day and we
[43:24] just watched a clip of that at the end
[43:25] of the service it just seems like
[43:27] people's Faith was raised we believe
[43:28] he's still the same God today the same
[43:31] yesterday today and forever
[43:33] but it just shows us that God that he's
[43:36] present in our day that the word is a
[43:38] discerner of the thoughts and Tents of
[43:40] the heart so if you didn't get a chance
[43:41] to watch that go back and watch that
[43:43] we're going to get to uh tongues and
[43:46] interpretation as the last of the gifts
[43:48] that we'll get to but then we're uh I
[43:50] may I may in between I may drop in uh
[43:53] there's something called helps and
[43:56] governments is what Paul calls it helps
[43:58] in governments and you can study on that
[44:00] and look that up in the scriptures and I
[44:03] may be dealing with that first because
[44:05] we all want to be a help don't we to the
[44:08] body of Christ that's why we're here is
[44:10] to be a help and so it's such a you know
[44:13] I know that you all are but we want to
[44:15] be the best help in the best place that
[44:17] we can be in and the best way to do that
[44:20] is to pray and ask God God how can I
[44:22] serve the people because that's what we
[44:24] do we don't serve ourselves we're not in
[44:27] the position that we're in I'm not the
[44:29] pastor because it it feels good to be
[44:32] the pastor or to stroke my ego or to
[44:35] make to make make me something I'm here
[44:38] because I believe God wanted me to be
[44:40] and and you wanted me to be and so I'm
[44:43] here to serve you and every one of the
[44:45] officers in the church and all of them
[44:47] volunteers they're here to serve you and
[44:49] if we can't serve you in a position
[44:51] we're in we ought to go do something
[44:54] else because that's should be our goal
[44:56] is to serve the people and and so we'll
[44:59] be talking about that maybe on Wednesday
[45:00] night amen the Lord blessed you this
[45:03] morning let's stand together we'll read
[45:05] the word thank you for bearing with me
[45:10] do you love the Lord this morning
[45:12] it's good to be here on a on a Sunday
[45:13] morning several of the folks are gone
[45:15] with their mothers I I can't begrudge on
[45:17] that I know what a blessing it is for
[45:19] for me to worship with my mother and
[45:21] someone who said the best gift you could
[45:23] give your mother is to go with her and
[45:25] be with her there on Mother's Day and I
[45:27] know in the past many of you have had
[45:28] family with you and today some are
[45:30] traveling to be with their mother so
[45:32] we're thankful they were able to do that
[45:35] Genesis chapter 29 and verse 35 I just
[45:38] want to take a little bit of a unique
[45:40] thought at least to me but this will
[45:43] begin begin to weigh heavily on me this
[45:45] week while we were with the teenagers
[45:47] this week in Branson and it just the
[45:49] Lord just kept dealing with me on this
[45:51] thought so I trust it'll be a blessing
[45:53] to you Genesis 29 35 and she conceived
[45:58] again and bear a son
[45:59] and she said
[46:01] now will I praise the Lord
[46:04] what a Time
[46:06] during childbirth
[46:08] said now will I praise the Lord
[46:10] therefore she called his name Judah and
[46:14] left bearing let's bow our heads
[46:16] together maybe you have a special need
[46:18] you'd like to make known by wave
[46:19] uplifted hand I know God sees every one
[46:21] of those needs today
[46:23] Heavenly Father
[46:25] Lord I think especially of our mothers
[46:27] today and the battles that they fought
[46:30] and the things that they've been through
[46:32] Lord and we want to reward them today
[46:35] and honor them
[46:37] Lord maybe there would be a need on a
[46:39] mother's heart today that you just
[46:40] really Lord there's just something
[46:42] you're dealing with them about or some
[46:44] need that they have I pray you'd meet
[46:46] that need today especially for them but
[46:48] Lord for all of us there's others Lord
[46:50] maybe have a serious need of some kind
[46:53] in their body or in their mind or with
[46:55] their finances Whatever It Is God your
[46:58] your Jehovah Jireh you're still the same
[47:01] God Lord that provided a lamb for
[47:03] Abraham a ram for Abraham oh God we
[47:07] believe that you're still Jehovah Jireh
[47:09] you're still a provider today would you
[47:11] provide peace and comfort and strength
[47:13] Lord whatever we have need of God the
[47:16] same God that moved Lord and those
[47:18] meetings and the same power that that
[47:21] that Open the Eyes of the Blind and
[47:23] raised the dead healed the same that
[47:25] same power that we've seen in our lives
[47:27] that's transformed us from what we were
[47:30] to what we are today Lord we believe
[47:33] that power is still here today and is
[47:36] still able to move and so we pray that
[47:38] you would do that meet every need Lord
[47:40] even those needs that we don't realize
[47:42] that we have I pray you'd meet those
[47:43] today or change our attitudes change our
[47:46] thoughts move us in the right direction
[47:48] or that we should be in we pray and
[47:50] we'll ask it in the name of the precious
[47:53] Lord Jesus amen God bless you you can be
[47:56] seated
[48:01] whenever we think of Mother's Day we
[48:03] think of flowers we think of a nice meal
[48:06] we think of doing something nice for our
[48:10] mothers if they're living and if they've
[48:13] passed away we wish that we could
[48:15] we like to think of motherhood as very
[48:17] proper and very dignified mother doesn't
[48:19] make any mistakes
[48:21] mother doesn't doesn't have at least
[48:24] mine didn't you know and mother doesn't
[48:26] have any issues you know mother's always
[48:28] got the answers mom always knows what to
[48:32] say
[48:33] but the truth is that motherhood is very
[48:35] messy
[48:36] It's associated from the beginning with
[48:39] sorrow
[48:40] and in Genesis 3 16 he says to the woman
[48:45] he said I will greatly multiply thy
[48:47] sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou
[48:51] shalt bring forth children thy desire
[48:53] shall be thy husband he shall rule over
[48:55] thee there's two words used for sorrow
[48:57] there which seem to mean physical and
[49:00] mental pain the first one means the pain
[49:03] or the toil of travail and the second
[49:05] one includes the idea of hurt of mind
[49:08] and I like to think that the physical
[49:11] pain comes early but the mental pain
[49:14] comes later
[49:15] I don't know about y'all boy you're
[49:17] quiet this morning I I don't know much
[49:19] about you all but I'll say this that I
[49:21] caused most of the mental pain to my
[49:23] mother after I was born and after the
[49:26] childbirth and as I got older and I got
[49:29] old enough to do my own thing that's
[49:30] when the mental anxiety came in the
[49:33] mental part of it and so that's the two
[49:36] parts that it's it's painful to be a
[49:39] mother it sometimes it hurts sometimes
[49:42] there's trouble sometimes things don't
[49:45] go like what you planned for them to go
[49:48] and yet you're still a mother you're
[49:50] you're still a a person that God's
[49:53] called to that particular office and I
[49:55] think any of those of you who are not
[49:56] mothers today would say Amen to that as
[49:59] well that you you are called to a
[50:01] particular thing a particular office of
[50:04] particular place in life and and that
[50:07] place requires you to put up with some
[50:09] amount of pain with some amount of
[50:11] suffering with some amount of maybe not
[50:13] to the extent that a mother does but but
[50:16] to some amount of uh hardship and yet
[50:19] you stand there and and you stand in
[50:21] your position anyway aren't you glad God
[50:24] can have people that'll stand in spite
[50:26] of suffering in spite of pain and
[50:28] everything else and still do what God
[50:30] called them to do
[50:32] still be what God called them to be
[50:37] brother Branham taught us that
[50:39] Israel's wives That's Jacob's wives
[50:42] when they gave birth to the 12
[50:44] Patriarchs
[50:45] these mothers when they were having a
[50:47] baby and the baby was being born and
[50:50] them groaning so I didn't know Virginia
[50:54] would be in labor this morning so
[50:57] but I put this together but the babies
[51:00] being born them groaning the groans that
[51:03] they came out and he said he actually
[51:05] named those boys
[51:07] so I'm actually rather glad that my
[51:11] mother didn't name me ahead of time and
[51:13] I'm assumed that she did and didn't name
[51:15] me during that because sometimes that
[51:17] may not be very good but
[51:20] he said the the very groans that they
[51:23] give signify the nature of the child and
[51:27] the place they'd make their final
[51:29] resting place
[51:31] he said every groan under the power of
[51:34] the Holy Ghost now we think of being
[51:36] under the power of the Holy Ghost as
[51:39] being in a great service feeling the
[51:41] presence of God and that's true we we
[51:44] experience the power of the Holy Ghost
[51:45] everybody's dancing everybody's shouting
[51:48] but brother Brown said these mothers
[51:50] when they were experiencing the pain of
[51:53] childbirth were actually under the power
[51:56] of the Holy Ghost during that time do
[51:58] you realize when you're a real a real
[52:00] mother you're under the power of the
[52:02] Holy Ghost to be able to do that and and
[52:05] to be that if you're a real if you're a
[52:07] real Christian if you're a real Deacon
[52:09] or a trustee or a song leader or
[52:12] whatever it is that you do if you're a
[52:13] real dad in the home or working when you
[52:16] work you're under the power of the Holy
[52:18] Ghost you may not feel it but there's
[52:20] inspiration that comes to you to do the
[52:23] job that you were called to do and
[52:25] that's what we need see anointing is not
[52:28] just for running and shouting although
[52:30] we want
[52:31] my cup spills over but first it's got to
[52:35] be full and there's got to be an anoint
[52:37] an anointing is just an empowerment that
[52:39] allows you to do something
[52:42] and so we don't blow it all out the
[52:44] whistle but we it's got to put some uh
[52:46] some movement in the wheels so that
[52:48] we're able to move on down the track and
[52:50] that's where we want to be today so
[52:52] there's got to be an anointing to do the
[52:54] job that God called you to do
[52:57] so these mothers were under the power of
[53:00] the Holy Ghost
[53:02] when they were giving birth
[53:05] inspiration came
[53:07] and brother Branham again he said did
[53:09] you know that these portions how Joshua
[53:11] lauded them in Palestine was given by
[53:13] inspiration and those Hebrew mothers of
[53:16] those Patriarchs when the baby was
[53:18] coming forth and her and travailing pain
[53:21] to deliver the child she uttered the
[53:24] very spot that those Patriarchs would
[53:27] settle down and be at the last days
[53:30] so they actually through their pain
[53:32] through the through the travail through
[53:35] the struggle let me tell you that's when
[53:36] inspiration really strikes you that's
[53:39] when the power of the Holy Ghost is
[53:41] really on you it's in the painful times
[53:43] it's in the struggle it's in the times
[53:45] when you don't seem like you can't
[53:46] hardly make it those are the times God
[53:48] is moving
[53:50] thank you brother Robert Smith's been
[53:53] struggling in his health lately and and
[53:55] I've been telling him that that's just
[53:57] the part of the struggle and just part
[53:59] of life that we have to go through God's
[54:01] doing something God's moving in some way
[54:03] and you don't understand it but there's
[54:05] inspiration that comes during those
[54:07] times those are the times that God can
[54:09] really get through to you he can really
[54:11] talk to you it's a time when you're
[54:13] hurting the time when you're in pain the
[54:15] time when there's everything seems like
[54:17] it's falling apart
[54:19] but he's birthing something in your life
[54:21] don't you realize this whole world that
[54:23] we live in this fall in the park this
[54:25] whole this whole world is is shaking
[54:27] it's trembling it's groaning in birth
[54:29] pains we're groaning waiting to be
[54:31] closed upon there's a groaning that's
[54:33] going on but it's during this time that
[54:36] a message comes inspiration come to our
[54:38] day
[54:40] Hallelujah
[54:42] and a child will be delivered
[54:47] so they uttered the spot
[54:49] the Patriarchs would settle down in
[54:52] now we know that the Redeemer
[54:55] came
[54:56] the Redeemer would come through the seed
[54:59] of the woman
[55:00] and this is why Paul mentions that the
[55:02] woman will be saved in childbearing it
[55:03] doesn't mean like the Catholics believe
[55:05] that you'd be saved just by having more
[55:07] and more children
[55:08] and uh brother Joel is listening
[55:15] it means you'll be saved in childbearing
[55:18] that somehow through all the children
[55:20] that were born
[55:21] down through time there would be one
[55:23] born
[55:27] through all the children that would be
[55:28] born from the very beginning of time
[55:30] there was one that came
[55:32] that would be salvation
[55:35] and so early on they didn't understand
[55:38] all the all the ins and outs of it but
[55:40] they just knew the promises of Genesis 3
[55:42] Genesis 3 15. it says I will put enmity
[55:45] between thee and the woman between thy
[55:47] seed and her seed it shall Bruce the
[55:49] head thou shall Bruce his heel so they
[55:52] knew there had to be a woman's seed that
[55:54] would bruise the head of the serpent
[55:56] and so now they knew that only by having
[55:59] children could they recognize could they
[56:02] uh could they allow that to come so each
[56:04] one of these Patriarchs they wanted they
[56:06] wanted to have children and so now Jacob
[56:09] comes along and Abraham had come along
[56:11] and God had promised him it isn't it
[56:13] isn't it strange that so many of the
[56:16] biblical women struggled with
[56:18] infertility with the inability to have
[56:20] children and they were Barren why why is
[56:22] it says so many of them because Satan
[56:24] wanted to keep that child from being
[56:26] born
[56:27] he was trying so hard and God would
[56:29] allow it in fact the scripture doesn't
[56:30] even attribute it to Satan at all but it
[56:33] says God closed the womb of Sarah and
[56:35] God closed the womb of of Rachel and
[56:37] different ones that their womb was
[56:39] closed because God allowed it to be
[56:42] but that was the way that the Redeemer
[56:45] was going to come and the good thing
[56:46] about it is you know sometimes we
[56:48] attribute so much to Satan but they
[56:50] didn't know who it would come through
[56:51] and neither did Satan
[56:55] uh
[56:56] Satan didn't know
[56:58] you realize Satan didn't know the day
[57:01] you were going to be born again he
[57:03] didn't know that service he didn't know
[57:06] the time it was a mystery hidden in God
[57:08] God knew the day that you would come to
[57:11] him the day that you would come to your
[57:13] senses today you would recognize I'm not
[57:15] the son of of Charles and Ella Brandon
[57:18] as brother Brandon put it but I'm the
[57:19] son of I'm a Son of God you might say
[57:22] I'm a daughter of God that day was a
[57:24] mystery that God had in his mind but yet
[57:26] the world didn't know it and Satan
[57:28] didn't know it because if he knew it he
[57:30] would do everything he couldn't have
[57:31] stopped it
[57:33] so what does he do he tries to stop like
[57:35] he did he tried to kill the children
[57:36] under two years of age he tries to stop
[57:38] meanings from happening he tries to stop
[57:41] the service from being in the right
[57:42] atmosphere are you with me now he tries
[57:44] to stop everything from happening
[57:46] because he doesn't know when you might
[57:48] be born when your children might be born
[57:50] when that last one comes in
[57:53] he knows what's going to happen he just
[57:55] don't know when
[57:57] so being who he is he wants to do
[57:59] everything he can to stop it
[58:02] so Jacob come along and the promise had
[58:05] been narrowed down to his family
[58:09] right so it had been it had just been a
[58:11] promise that hung out there and then God
[58:12] called Abraham
[58:14] and now Abraham is singled out
[58:17] it's going to be your seed and then from
[58:19] there he singles out Isaac instead of
[58:22] Ishmael
[58:24] and from there he narrows it on down and
[58:27] he he
[58:29] signals out or or he singles out to
[58:32] Jacob instead of Esau
[58:35] and even though they were both born of
[58:37] the same parents
[58:38] so it had been narrowed down to Jacob's
[58:41] family
[58:43] that were chosen by God
[58:45] and so there was a problem though Jacob
[58:48] had to get married
[58:50] so in order for Jacob to uh to produce
[58:54] he couldn't do it on his own
[58:55] he had to have a bride
[58:58] and so now he would get married and and
[59:01] so in Genesis 28 1 Isaac called Jacob
[59:04] and blessed him and charged him instead
[59:06] of him thou I shall not take a wife of
[59:08] the daughters of Canaan
[59:10] verse 2 arise go to Pat and arum to the
[59:13] house of Bethel the mother's father take
[59:16] thee away from this of the daughters of
[59:18] Laban thy mother's brother so he wanted
[59:21] him to marry someone who was raised like
[59:23] he was someone who was a Believer and
[59:26] I'm sure that Jacob had heard the love
[59:28] story of what it was to be Isaac's uh or
[59:33] to be Isaac's son I'm sure he'd heard
[59:35] Isaac and Rebecca's Love Story many
[59:37] times he'd heard how the how the Easter
[59:40] had gone down into the well and and he'd
[59:43] knelt down and he prayed and and pretty
[59:45] soon here come Rebecca out to the well
[59:47] and it was just the one the very one to
[59:50] come out to the well and fed the uh fed
[59:52] the camels that were there was the very
[59:54] one that God Called to be his wife and
[59:56] I'm sure Jacob had great ideas in his
[59:59] mind well this is exactly what God's
[1:00:00] going to do for me it yet you realize
[1:00:02] God deals with every generation on their
[1:00:05] own
[1:00:07] right he deals with them on their own
[1:00:09] he's still the same God but he deals
[1:00:12] with them on their own because he may
[1:00:14] have something different see there's
[1:00:15] going to be a generation that's going to
[1:00:16] take a Rapture there's going to be a
[1:00:19] people that's going to take a Rapture so
[1:00:20] he deals with us on her own in our own
[1:00:23] generation every every age every
[1:00:25] generation has to have their own Revival
[1:00:27] and so now Jacob's got to go through his
[1:00:30] own Revival and so we know the story of
[1:00:33] how he had the vision of of the uh of
[1:00:36] the Angels ascending and descending on
[1:00:38] the ladder to heaven and so he's in a
[1:00:40] real spiritual time of his life and he
[1:00:42] goes down to find uh his wife
[1:00:47] and when he went down he found that here
[1:00:49] come a Rachel
[1:00:51] and Rachel came out he thought he might
[1:00:54] have thought my boy this is wonderful
[1:00:56] just like what happened to Mom and Dad
[1:00:59] then at verse 16 but it says Laban had
[1:01:01] two daughters
[1:01:03] the name of the Elder was Leah the name
[1:01:06] of the younger was Rachel
[1:01:08] and Leah was tender-eyed
[1:01:10] what that means is it her eyes were dull
[1:01:13] and the way that they looked at how
[1:01:16] pretty a woman was the way they
[1:01:17] determined that in the in the ancient
[1:01:19] times was the eyes it was the eyes that
[1:01:22] whether or not that's why in so many
[1:01:24] ancient world in the Eastern World they
[1:01:26] would color their eyes with something
[1:01:27] trying to make them stand out because
[1:01:29] the eyes were seen as the most beautiful
[1:01:32] part of a woman and so now Leah was
[1:01:36] tenderized or that what means weak eyed
[1:01:38] but Rachel was beautiful and well
[1:01:40] favored his eyes were dull she was plain
[1:01:43] but Rachel had a beautiful face and form
[1:01:47] and I want you to notice saying you all
[1:01:49] know the story but I want you to notice
[1:01:51] that Leah never asked for any of it
[1:01:54] she did not go out there with the
[1:01:56] intention of snaring Jacob she didn't go
[1:02:00] out with the intention of usurping her
[1:02:02] sister she's just following orders
[1:02:05] she's not trying to deceive Jacob that's
[1:02:07] her father
[1:02:08] Laban so evidently Laban realizes that
[1:02:11] he he wants to keep Jacob around because
[1:02:13] Jacob wherever a Son of God his people
[1:02:16] are blessed do you believe that today
[1:02:18] forever a Son of God his people are
[1:02:20] blessed I believe that's true on the job
[1:02:22] I believe that's true in the community
[1:02:24] wherever children of God are people are
[1:02:26] blessed I had a pastor tell me one time
[1:02:28] and it's true he said your boss will be
[1:02:30] blessed because he employed you
[1:02:34] why because you're a son of God
[1:02:37] amen your sons and daughters are the
[1:02:40] king wherever you go because of the way
[1:02:42] you carry yourself because of the way
[1:02:43] you you're taught and the way that you
[1:02:45] the way that you work and everything
[1:02:47] that you do it causes the people around
[1:02:49] you to be blessed so Laban says I want
[1:02:52] to be blessed so so he thinks you know
[1:02:55] and these guys man you talk about
[1:02:57] politics today you don't hold a candle
[1:03:00] what these guys did
[1:03:02] right I mean this is pretty bad I don't
[1:03:04] I don't know if I can think of anything
[1:03:05] else worse to do to your daughter and to
[1:03:08] use her as a pawn to cause her to be
[1:03:10] married to someone she doesn't like and
[1:03:13] he doesn't like her
[1:03:16] and if he used her as a pawn and
[1:03:18] deceitfully and there wasn't up front
[1:03:21] with Jacob because he knew Jacob would
[1:03:22] never stand for it because Jacob loved
[1:03:25] Rachel
[1:03:26] and so Jacob ends up married to Leah
[1:03:30] completely by mistake
[1:03:33] on his part
[1:03:34] he doesn't intend to be married to her
[1:03:37] he doesn't love her
[1:03:39] and I feel bad for Leah most in that
[1:03:41] situation
[1:03:43] she was a victim
[1:03:45] now a lot of people claim to be victims
[1:03:47] today but Leah actually was
[1:03:49] now he he loved Rachel more than he did
[1:03:53] Leah but but you notice if you go read
[1:03:55] the story and not have time to read it
[1:03:57] all today because it's not where I'm
[1:03:58] going but if you go back and read the
[1:04:00] story you'll find Jacob forgot to do
[1:04:02] something
[1:04:03] he went down the same way that Eliezer
[1:04:06] did to find find Rebecca here Jacob goes
[1:04:09] down to find his wife and his wife came
[1:04:11] Rachel came out but Jacob neglected to
[1:04:14] pray
[1:04:16] Ellie easer got down on his knees and
[1:04:19] said Lord I won't be successful unless
[1:04:21] you make me successful
[1:04:23] but Jacob neglected to pray before he
[1:04:27] decided that he loved Rachel
[1:04:30] now and listen this is important so he
[1:04:33] ended up with two wives
[1:04:35] because he didn't pray
[1:04:38] and it just proves again that polygamy
[1:04:40] was not God's intended purpose for man
[1:04:44] Genesis 29 31
[1:04:46] the Bible says when when the Lord saw
[1:04:49] you believe God sees you today
[1:04:52] when the Lord saw that Leah was hated he
[1:04:55] opened her womb but Rachel was barren
[1:05:00] and Leah conceived and bear a son and
[1:05:03] she called his name Reuben for she said
[1:05:06] surely the Lord hath looked upon my
[1:05:08] Affliction now therefore my husband will
[1:05:11] love me
[1:05:12] I I want to stop here for just a moment
[1:05:14] Jacob was wrong in how he dealt with his
[1:05:17] family Jacob has bad family problems and
[1:05:21] you can go find that yeah but Jacob was
[1:05:23] also a prophet of God
[1:05:25] a patriarch a man who saw dreams and had
[1:05:29] Supernatural events in their life
[1:05:30] whenever somebody comes to you and tells
[1:05:34] you because of the supernatural in their
[1:05:36] life you should imitate them in all of
[1:05:38] these ways you shouldn't listen to that
[1:05:40] you don't imitate men you imitate the
[1:05:42] word
[1:05:44] right you imitate the word because it's
[1:05:46] because a person can move in a
[1:05:47] supernatural realm doesn't mean he makes
[1:05:49] good decisions at home
[1:05:53] now Jacob didn't make good decisions at
[1:05:56] home
[1:05:57] and at times Isaac didn't because
[1:05:59] brother Brown said God doesn't show us
[1:06:01] prophets everything he lets them make
[1:06:03] decisions
[1:06:04] but Jacob didn't either and so now she
[1:06:08] says now therefore my husband will love
[1:06:09] me you see the the pain in this
[1:06:12] the sorrow not just the physical pain of
[1:06:15] childbirth but she's she's crying out
[1:06:17] she has these children but brother
[1:06:19] Branham calls it a prophecy
[1:06:22] he says the Holy Ghost moved on her
[1:06:25] but now she's crying out in the pain of
[1:06:28] all that she had been through
[1:06:30] and she says now my husband will love me
[1:06:32] she conceived again and bear a son and
[1:06:34] said because the Lord has heard that I
[1:06:36] was hated he had therefore given me this
[1:06:38] son also she called his name Simeon she
[1:06:41] conceived again and bear a son and said
[1:06:43] now this time
[1:06:45] because the relationship didn't change
[1:06:48] with Reuben
[1:06:50] and the relationship didn't change with
[1:06:51] Simeon she said surely this time
[1:06:55] when my husband be joined unto me
[1:06:57] because I had borne him three sons
[1:07:00] therefore was his name called Levi
[1:07:04] and she conceived again and bear his son
[1:07:08] I
[1:07:10] through all of this through all the pain
[1:07:12] through all the struggle through all the
[1:07:15] worry y'all have experienced that in
[1:07:17] your lives I'm sure you mothers could
[1:07:19] testify today I've experienced pain I've
[1:07:22] experienced worry I've experienced
[1:07:23] anxiety I've been at times where I
[1:07:25] didn't know if anybody loved me I've
[1:07:27] experienced times in my life someone can
[1:07:29] say Amen this morning I've experienced
[1:07:31] times in my life when the struggle was
[1:07:33] real and the trouble was out there and
[1:07:35] my body wasn't cooperating and and my
[1:07:38] relationships weren't cooperating but
[1:07:40] she reached down now at the fourth time
[1:07:42] and there was such an inspiration hit
[1:07:44] her and she said now I will praise the
[1:07:46] Lord
[1:07:50] oh I want to tell you this morning we
[1:07:52] don't have our rose-colored glasses on I
[1:07:54] realize that being a mom in this day and
[1:07:56] age is a hard thing I realized that that
[1:07:58] going to church is a hard day in this
[1:08:00] day and age I realize being a message
[1:08:01] but being the bride is not necessarily
[1:08:04] just a time when everything's all Rosy
[1:08:06] and things there's you got a struggle
[1:08:08] You Gotta Fight You Gotta battle in the
[1:08:10] world that you live you're fighting
[1:08:12] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:08:13] you're fighting a government that's
[1:08:15] going crazy you're fighting a spiritual
[1:08:17] warfare out here the the world is just
[1:08:20] going further and further and further
[1:08:22] into darkness you're trying to keep
[1:08:24] sanity in your home you're trying to
[1:08:26] keep sanity in the church you're trying
[1:08:28] to trying to understand people who are
[1:08:30] fallible people with sticky natures and
[1:08:33] you're dealing with all of this and in
[1:08:34] the midst of that when inspiration
[1:08:36] really strikes
[1:08:39] oh my
[1:08:41] God he said now I'll praise the Lord
[1:08:44] Hallelujah the situation hasn't changed
[1:08:50] Jacob never did get to where he loved
[1:08:53] Leah
[1:08:56] he never did treat her appropriately
[1:08:59] oh my never did as far as we know ever
[1:09:03] do what he should have done with this
[1:09:05] family
[1:09:06] oh my every time he'd come back and have
[1:09:09] a great experience with God he'd
[1:09:10] backside
[1:09:11] he never did on I thank God for the
[1:09:14] keeping power of the Holy Ghost today
[1:09:16] because that's the only thing that keeps
[1:09:18] us sir we'd be just like Jacob we'd go
[1:09:20] from spiritual experience down into the
[1:09:22] gutter spiritual experience down into
[1:09:24] the gutter but we don't just visit with
[1:09:26] the Holy Ghost he dwells in US
[1:09:29] we're not just inspired by the Holy
[1:09:31] Ghost he actually lives on the inside
[1:09:35] so now but Jacob had such a he was up
[1:09:38] and he was down and and Leah was never
[1:09:41] she felt unloved by her husband
[1:09:44] she was used by her father
[1:09:46] unloved by her husband but yet she found
[1:09:49] a way to praise
[1:09:51] all that ought to be our desire today
[1:09:53] Lord through all the pain through all
[1:09:55] the struggle through all the Brokenness
[1:09:57] of life let me find a way to praise
[1:10:01] hmm she didn't know it but she had
[1:10:04] prophesied through her pain
[1:10:08] Judah will be praised
[1:10:11] some of you mothers might have had a
[1:10:12] hard life
[1:10:13] things might not have worked out like
[1:10:15] you thought they would but when you
[1:10:17] praise the Lord in spite of that when
[1:10:19] you praise the Lord I should say because
[1:10:21] of that you say I wish things would have
[1:10:23] been different but you couldn't praise
[1:10:25] him like you do now if things had all
[1:10:27] been easy you couldn't worship him like
[1:10:29] are you hearing me today I hope I'm I
[1:10:31] hope I'm preaching to somebody today and
[1:10:33] there's somebody that's gone through
[1:10:35] I've been through time but if I hadn't
[1:10:37] been through the sticky places if I
[1:10:39] hadn't been through the desert I
[1:10:40] couldn't appreciate a good rain if I
[1:10:42] hadn't experienced some of the things in
[1:10:44] my life if I hadn't done some dumb
[1:10:45] things made some bad decisions but at
[1:10:48] any I wouldn't be where I'm at today I
[1:10:50] wouldn't be the person that I am today
[1:10:51] and I'm sure I'll make some in the
[1:10:53] future I'm sure I'll do some dumb thing
[1:10:55] make some bad decisions but I'll say
[1:10:57] right now in this place that I'm at in
[1:10:59] spite of all of it I will praise the
[1:11:01] Lord
[1:11:02] I will praise the Lord what was it it
[1:11:05] was a prophecy of Praise through pain a
[1:11:07] prophecy of Praise through hardship
[1:11:09] through toil through Labor
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:15] Hallelujah
[1:11:19] and God
[1:11:20] chose Leah's son
[1:11:24] she was the unfavored one
[1:11:26] the overlooked one
[1:11:29] but God chose her son not Rachel's
[1:11:33] to be the natural bloodline of the
[1:11:34] Redeemer
[1:11:38] she didn't realize it
[1:11:40] this was the son they were looking for
[1:11:41] not the son but this was the bloodline
[1:11:45] you understand this would be the natural
[1:11:48] Seed of Abraham would come through Judah
[1:11:52] it doesn't make any sense not the oldest
[1:11:54] child but what is it she had learned
[1:11:57] through her pain and through her
[1:11:59] struggle and somehow the prophecy that
[1:12:01] come out of that Brokenness listen
[1:12:03] there's nothing that smells so sweet as
[1:12:06] a flower that's been crushed
[1:12:08] what is that's where you get perfume
[1:12:10] from it's from afar look at the life of
[1:12:12] Jesus he he had to express himself as
[1:12:15] being crushed by by God himself God put
[1:12:19] him there on the cross God so loved the
[1:12:21] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:12:23] God put him there on the cross and
[1:12:26] because of that he was crushed for you
[1:12:28] and I
[1:12:29] and the sweetest smell the sweetest
[1:12:32] perfume come out of his life
[1:12:34] that's what pain does
[1:12:37] see God chose Leah's son
[1:12:40] pain produced a mother's prophecy
[1:12:44] but I want you to understand today that
[1:12:46] what you prophesy over your children
[1:12:48] depends on your reaction to the pain
[1:12:52] because you prophesy over your children
[1:12:53] you realize that brother Branham I
[1:12:55] didn't bring all the quotes and things
[1:12:56] this morning but brother Brandon said a
[1:12:58] mother is a preacher
[1:13:00] she don't have a right to stand behind
[1:13:02] the pulpit but she's a preacher to her
[1:13:04] children
[1:13:05] he said there's five gospels Matthew
[1:13:07] Mark Luke John and mother
[1:13:09] right that that Fifth Gospel is the
[1:13:11] mother she's the one that gets them
[1:13:13] first she's the one that raises them up
[1:13:15] and that's why you see like things like
[1:13:17] sister Betty sitting here with brother
[1:13:18] Robbie because a mother worked and
[1:13:20] raised a child to come to the house of
[1:13:22] God some of you can say Amen to that
[1:13:24] today the mother gets them first
[1:13:27] and before even as dads we can get
[1:13:30] through to them as far as teaching and
[1:13:31] leading a mother is there
[1:13:34] to be able to teach them but it's not so
[1:13:37] much what you say but but it's your
[1:13:39] reaction to the events that go on in
[1:13:41] your life
[1:13:43] because you can react in a way it says
[1:13:45] oh woe is me I'm unloved
[1:13:49] nobody likes me nobody cares about me or
[1:13:53] you can react in such a way says I will
[1:13:55] praise the Lord
[1:13:58] I will praise the Lord I've been through
[1:14:00] pain but I will praise the Lord I've had
[1:14:02] struggles but I will praise the Lord my
[1:14:04] relationships haven't all worked out my
[1:14:07] you'd be surprised what your parents
[1:14:10] have been through
[1:14:12] if you really knew everything your
[1:14:15] parents had been through some of you
[1:14:16] might be surprised some of you wouldn't
[1:14:18] be maybe you know some of the things
[1:14:20] your parents went through because now
[1:14:21] you're experiencing some of those things
[1:14:23] yourself but when you get in trouble
[1:14:25] when you get in pain when you get when
[1:14:27] you get in the worst time of your life
[1:14:29] it produces something
[1:14:31] a prophecy
[1:14:33] then God knew that Leah
[1:14:36] God chose Leah
[1:14:38] for Jacob
[1:14:42] well how do you know
[1:14:44] because that's the one he ended up with
[1:14:47] Jacob chose Rachel and God used that too
[1:14:51] but the perfect will of God in this
[1:14:53] situation was not polygamy
[1:14:56] which never is
[1:14:58] Jacob
[1:15:00] and Leah
[1:15:02] think about it
[1:15:05] and Rachel
[1:15:07] had children too and God allowed his
[1:15:08] perfect will or his permissive will to
[1:15:10] work to glorify his perfect will out of
[1:15:13] her come Joseph and Benjamin
[1:15:15] but now
[1:15:16] this pain produced the prophecy now
[1:15:19] Rachel also named children and she named
[1:15:23] Joseph and then when she's having
[1:15:26] trouble in childbirth
[1:15:29] and in Genesis 35 16 it says Rachel
[1:15:32] travailed and had hard labor and this is
[1:15:35] when they journeyed from Bethel and I've
[1:15:36] spoken to you on that before whenever
[1:15:39] Jacob Journeys from Bethel it means he's
[1:15:41] leaving the house of God he always gets
[1:15:44] in trouble
[1:15:45] and now Rachel begins to be in hard
[1:15:48] labor and it came to pass when she was
[1:15:50] in hard labor that the Midwife said unto
[1:15:52] her fear not Thou shalt have this son
[1:15:53] also and it came to pass as her soul was
[1:15:56] in departing that she called his name
[1:16:00] benoni
[1:16:02] son of my sorrow
[1:16:04] but his father called him Benjamin
[1:16:08] Benjamin in the Hebrew which is which is
[1:16:11] son of my right hand his father had to
[1:16:14] change the name knowing that benoni
[1:16:16] would Mark him as a child of Sorrow
[1:16:20] because that's the time of life that
[1:16:22] she's going through now now remember
[1:16:24] when as we live that we have the
[1:16:26] opportunity to prophesy by the lives
[1:16:28] that we live over our children
[1:16:30] and our reaction to the pain that's
[1:16:33] going on in our life is what is what
[1:16:35] brings a prophecy out of our life that
[1:16:37] we can see that our children can see and
[1:16:40] they can be influenced by to be a
[1:16:42] certain thing
[1:16:45] think about it for a minute
[1:16:47] The Knowing son of my sorrow he had to
[1:16:50] change his name because the prophecy was
[1:16:53] one of Sorrow
[1:16:54] Rachel died a pillar was placed over a
[1:16:57] grave Jacob loved her to the end
[1:17:00] but when Jacob was dying he called his
[1:17:02] children in for a blessing
[1:17:04] and when he called them in he spoke to
[1:17:06] Judah he said he spoke to the others
[1:17:09] first and ordered that they were born in
[1:17:11] and he speaks to Judy he said Judah Thou
[1:17:13] Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise
[1:17:16] thy hand shall be in the neck of thine
[1:17:19] enemies
[1:17:20] thy father's children shall bow down
[1:17:22] before thee Judah is a lion's whelp from
[1:17:26] the prey my son Thou Art gone up he
[1:17:28] stooped down he couched as a lion as an
[1:17:31] old lion who shall Rouse him up the
[1:17:33] scepter shall not depart from Judah nor
[1:17:35] a lawgiver from between his feet until
[1:17:37] Shiloh come and unto him shall the
[1:17:39] Gathering of the people be all she did
[1:17:42] was prophesy praise and on now now it's
[1:17:44] beginning to realize that this would be
[1:17:46] the kingly line this would be the
[1:17:49] bloodline of the king the son of David
[1:17:51] he couldn't be a son of David unless he
[1:17:53] was the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:17:57] Hallelujah
[1:17:58] so now this is him this is the bloodline
[1:18:03] and again so Rachel would not be in the
[1:18:06] bloodline of the Messiah Leah would be
[1:18:09] I don't want you to understand today I
[1:18:11] want you to be discouraged by your
[1:18:13] present or your current situation
[1:18:15] because there's always going to be pain
[1:18:17] and sometimes it's just simple things
[1:18:19] like trying to get your kids all in
[1:18:21] church and a lot of the little ones
[1:18:22] aren't here this morning but some of
[1:18:23] them are my mother texted me this
[1:18:25] morning and said I'm not used to getting
[1:18:26] three kids ready for church
[1:18:29] when Mom had eight kids but you lose it
[1:18:32] at some point I guess you know
[1:18:35] it's difficult to get kids ready for
[1:18:37] church but just even in that difficulty
[1:18:39] your kids get to see you come to church
[1:18:42] anyway
[1:18:44] and they see you in church when the
[1:18:45] spirit of the Lord begins to move and
[1:18:47] you raise your hand and a tear runs down
[1:18:49] you may not be running and jumping all
[1:18:51] over the place unless you're chasing
[1:18:52] kids
[1:18:54] but you you may not be running and
[1:18:55] jumping all over the place but the kids
[1:18:57] see the attitude that you take towards
[1:18:59] the pain are you hearing me today let's
[1:19:01] see how you stand for the gospel you
[1:19:03] stand for the message even though many
[1:19:05] leave and many don't do that but they
[1:19:07] see the stand that you take and they see
[1:19:09] that it becomes a prophecy of praise
[1:19:13] Hallelujah and later on it begins to
[1:19:16] develop in their life and what they'll
[1:19:17] be but it'll always it started with a
[1:19:19] mother's prophecy
[1:19:23] Rachel got a pillar but Leah was buried
[1:19:26] with Jacob this is so so neat I think so
[1:19:30] ironic
[1:19:31] Genesis 49 29.
[1:19:34] he says he charged him he's dying now
[1:19:36] Jacob is dying he said unto them I am to
[1:19:38] be gathered unto my people
[1:19:41] my father's in the cave that is in the
[1:19:44] field of Ephraim the hittite in the cave
[1:19:46] that is in the field of macpila
[1:19:49] which is before memory in the land of
[1:19:52] Canaan which Abraham bought with the
[1:19:54] field of Ephron the hittite for a
[1:19:57] possession of a burying place now what
[1:20:00] was it that field was bought for the
[1:20:02] purpose of Resurrection because Abraham
[1:20:06] recognized job had been buried there
[1:20:08] right and because job had been buried
[1:20:11] there he knew there was a resurrection
[1:20:12] taking place in that land
[1:20:15] so Jacob said bury me in the land of the
[1:20:18] Resurrection
[1:20:20] Hallelujah in the cave of macpila and
[1:20:24] there they buried Abraham and Sarah his
[1:20:26] wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca
[1:20:29] his wife
[1:20:30] notice the couples as they're buried
[1:20:32] together because they'll come up
[1:20:33] together
[1:20:37] and there I buried Leah
[1:20:42] Rachel may have had a bigger Memorial in
[1:20:44] this life
[1:20:45] and Rachel
[1:20:47] may not have been a bad person she she
[1:20:49] wasn't but but now we begin to see God's
[1:20:52] purpose for Leah
[1:20:54] you can't compare yourself to somebody
[1:20:56] else
[1:20:58] it doesn't work
[1:21:00] it doesn't work that's how they get
[1:21:02] women to buy makeup comparison
[1:21:05] say well you're not as pretty as that
[1:21:06] person not as pretty as you could be and
[1:21:08] so the Modern Standard and it's really
[1:21:10] not pretty at all
[1:21:11] but that's how they sell you makeup it's
[1:21:13] just a sales job and trying to get you
[1:21:15] to compare yourself with somebody else
[1:21:17] but you might be a homely person today I
[1:21:20] know what it's like to be ugly actually
[1:21:24] I know what it's like not to be fit but
[1:21:27] I also know it but I care less about
[1:21:28] that than most women do you understand
[1:21:30] that but but I do know what it's like
[1:21:33] but also know what it's like to be a son
[1:21:35] of the king
[1:21:36] I also know what it's I know what it's
[1:21:38] like to be and to be kicked out to be
[1:21:40] ostracized to be to be said that I'm
[1:21:43] different and I'm weird and everything
[1:21:44] else even from a young person I was told
[1:21:47] yeah you just don't want to have any fun
[1:21:48] I know what that's like for the joke but
[1:21:50] I know what it's like to be a son of the
[1:21:52] king I know what it's like to feel the
[1:21:54] presence of God I know what it's like to
[1:21:56] be born again by the spirit of God how
[1:21:59] many in here can say the same thing I
[1:22:01] know what it's like to be rejected but I
[1:22:03] know what it's like to be accepted
[1:22:07] I may be different but I've been
[1:22:08] accepted in the Beloved I may not be up
[1:22:11] to everybody's standard of beauty but I
[1:22:13] know what it's like to be accepted by
[1:22:15] God
[1:22:18] amen
[1:22:22] the Brandon said Along Came the prophets
[1:22:24] of old Abraham
[1:22:26] the sweethearts of the Bible
[1:22:28] Abraham and Sarah
[1:22:30] I love that
[1:22:32] when Sarah died Abraham purchased a
[1:22:34] piece of ground right near where job was
[1:22:36] buried and buried Sarah
[1:22:38] he said I'm a joint Heir with you over
[1:22:41] Yonder
[1:22:43] job was buried there Abraham and Sarah
[1:22:45] Isaac and Rebecca Jacob
[1:22:48] and Leah
[1:22:50] and when Joseph died he said carry my
[1:22:52] bones
[1:22:53] back to that place
[1:22:55] we're told that in the New Testament
[1:22:57] when Jesus when the earthquake shook the
[1:22:59] city right before Jesus would would give
[1:23:02] up the ghost or as he gave up the ghost
[1:23:04] in Matthew 27 52 the graves were open
[1:23:06] and many bodies of the Saints which
[1:23:09] slept arose and came out of the graves
[1:23:11] after his resurrection and went into the
[1:23:14] holy city and appeared unto many you
[1:23:16] imagine I'm just dramatized I know it
[1:23:18] doesn't happen quite this way but just
[1:23:19] if you think about it men are just
[1:23:21] laying there man whoa nothing quite a
[1:23:23] nap
[1:23:26] waking up Abraham wakes up hurry Sarah
[1:23:28] praise God
[1:23:30] We're Young again we've been we've been
[1:23:32] young before
[1:23:36] like some job wakes up
[1:23:39] Isaac wakes up there's Rebecca you see
[1:23:42] these love stories I said I said
[1:23:44] couldn't be the same without Rebecca
[1:23:45] Abraham wouldn't be complete without
[1:23:48] Sarah
[1:23:49] and Jacob wakes up oh
[1:23:53] something happened
[1:23:54] felt a jolt in here time to get up and
[1:23:57] move around the city
[1:24:00] or my wife
[1:24:01] Rachel where are you
[1:24:03] it's Leah
[1:24:06] think about it for a minute
[1:24:08] for you but it was God's purpose
[1:24:11] and God's plan now that's going to
[1:24:13] change the way some of you all think
[1:24:14] because we've heard for years that we'll
[1:24:16] get the right one in the millennium
[1:24:22] think about it Jacob got the right one
[1:24:25] when the time came
[1:24:29] buried with him in the cave of mcpila
[1:24:32] brother Branham taught us if you get the
[1:24:34] wrong one you get the right one of the
[1:24:35] Millennium but it may be the one you're
[1:24:36] married to
[1:24:40] thought it was the right wrong one
[1:24:42] because everything went wrong because it
[1:24:44] was all messed up and you had much
[1:24:46] trauma and trouble in your life but you
[1:24:47] didn't realize God was doing something
[1:24:49] in your life
[1:24:50] God put you together
[1:24:53] see things don't have to go smoothly for
[1:24:55] God to have put you together
[1:24:58] that's free that's not part of the
[1:25:00] sermon
[1:25:02] Jacob got the right one
[1:25:04] might not be what he wanted but it was
[1:25:06] the right one now let's look Beyond just
[1:25:08] marriage look at your life today you
[1:25:10] think I wish I could have been different
[1:25:12] I wish things would have happened
[1:25:13] different I wish there was less pain
[1:25:16] I wish there was less struggle I wish my
[1:25:19] kids would went a Direction they hurt me
[1:25:21] when they were born and then they hurt
[1:25:22] me worse when they got big
[1:25:25] I wish there was less trouble
[1:25:28] oh God
[1:25:30] I wish it could have been different I
[1:25:32] wish I could rewrite history
[1:25:34] but maybe God allowed you to go through
[1:25:36] that
[1:25:37] to get a prophecy of Praise out of your
[1:25:39] life that you can stand up in a Sunday
[1:25:41] morning you can say the Lord gives and
[1:25:44] the Lord takes away blessed be the name
[1:25:47] of the Lord I will not I whatever God
[1:25:49] does I'll bless his name
[1:25:52] come into the world naked I go out naked
[1:25:54] I don't carry nothing with me blessed be
[1:25:57] the name of the Lord if I lose
[1:25:58] everything let me have you Lord
[1:26:01] she said I will praise the Lord
[1:26:04] amen
[1:26:08] God allowed that pain perhaps to get a
[1:26:10] prophecy of Praise out of your life are
[1:26:12] you still with me this morning
[1:26:14] just a little bit further
[1:26:16] David
[1:26:18] when King Saul of benjamite one of
[1:26:21] Rachel's descendants
[1:26:22] Israel is after David trying to kill him
[1:26:25] David's one of Leah's descendants
[1:26:27] still trouble in the family
[1:26:30] and they're trying to kill him
[1:26:32] and David flees to the Philistines for
[1:26:35] his own safety and the city he lives in
[1:26:37] comes under a malachite attack and you
[1:26:39] all know the story I'm running out of
[1:26:41] time so I won't read it there but it
[1:26:42] said David was greatly distressed for
[1:26:45] the people were talking about stoning
[1:26:47] him and he said every man for his sons
[1:26:49] and for his daughters but David
[1:26:52] encouraged himself in the Lord his God
[1:26:55] why he was in that bloodline of praise
[1:26:59] praise through struggle go look at the
[1:27:01] Psalms and begin to read the Psalms and
[1:27:03] begin to look at what God was doing it
[1:27:05] was it was praised in in spite of Saul
[1:27:08] chasing me Praise In Spite of my son
[1:27:10] turning me down Praise In Spite of my
[1:27:12] own problems
[1:27:14] I will praise the Lord
[1:27:17] listen David encouraged himself I don't
[1:27:20] know how David did that exactly but I
[1:27:22] like to think that he sung
[1:27:25] you ever think about because that's many
[1:27:26] times how we get courage to go to battle
[1:27:28] it's to sing that's how they get courage
[1:27:31] in battle is they start up the band and
[1:27:33] they begin to play and the the Fife and
[1:27:36] the drum I've always wondered about them
[1:27:37] guys they go out in the same battle the
[1:27:39] rest of them go out in and they get shot
[1:27:41] at the same as the rest of them but they
[1:27:42] can't shoot back they just got to keep
[1:27:44] playing why because somebody's got to be
[1:27:46] there to keep the courage of the men up
[1:27:49] David encouraged himself I like to think
[1:27:51] you begin to sing and maybe he'd sang
[1:27:53] Psalm 34 because he had just written
[1:27:55] that just a little while before when he
[1:27:57] was down there in front of the king and
[1:27:59] he appeared like a madman you remember
[1:28:00] the story and out of that out of that
[1:28:03] story he he wrote Psalms 34. he said I
[1:28:06] will bless the Lord and
[1:28:09] at all times
[1:28:11] you see the prophecy coming down here
[1:28:14] here was a woman who prophesied a mother
[1:28:16] who prophesied over her child and many
[1:28:18] many years later here's one of her
[1:28:20] descendants one of the children of that
[1:28:22] of his bloodline that's crying out
[1:28:24] saying I Will Bless The Lord at all
[1:28:27] times his praise shall continually be in
[1:28:30] my mouth it's a phrase that means in
[1:28:32] Hebrew I can bless the Lord in every
[1:28:34] situation I wonder if we could say Amen
[1:28:36] to that today I bless the Lord in
[1:28:38] trouble I bless the Lord in struggle
[1:28:40] I'll bless the Lord when people say amen
[1:28:43] I bless the Lord when nobody says amen
[1:28:45] I'll bless the Lord when things are
[1:28:47] going good I'll bless the Lord when
[1:28:48] things are going bad are you with me now
[1:28:51] I will praise the Lord
[1:28:54] in spite of my circumstances
[1:29:00] see brother Ben you don't know how hard
[1:29:02] that is
[1:29:03] let me tell you I mean no more than what
[1:29:06] you think
[1:29:07] but let me tell you this it is the
[1:29:09] difficulty of it that he loves
[1:29:12] that's what God loves about it
[1:29:15] it's the difficulty of it if it was easy
[1:29:18] it wouldn't be a sacrifice
[1:29:23] foreign
[1:29:24] 's hearing me today if it was easy to
[1:29:27] praise God during difficult situations
[1:29:29] it would not be a sacrifice of praise he
[1:29:32] ath the heaven on a flowery bed of ease
[1:29:34] but he doesn't why because it's for our
[1:29:36] good he's building a character and in
[1:29:38] doing that in those moments when the
[1:29:40] perfume is squeezed out of our life it's
[1:29:42] in those moments
[1:29:44] God works the most and that's what he
[1:29:47] loves
[1:29:49] you realize it keeps your prayers
[1:29:52] the Bible says it was a bowl of incense
[1:29:55] there was the prayers of the Saints
[1:29:58] sweet smell and Savor he keeps your
[1:30:00] prayers
[1:30:02] prayers made through heartache he hears
[1:30:04] them prayers when you're sick and you
[1:30:06] pray over and over and over again and
[1:30:08] think am I ever going to be healed am I
[1:30:10] ever going to be right this thing's ever
[1:30:11] going to be in the right place and he he
[1:30:13] hears your prayers he keeps your prayers
[1:30:16] because it smells good to him
[1:30:20] he loves it
[1:30:24] first truth is my soul shall make her
[1:30:26] boast in the Lord
[1:30:28] that's where we get the word hallelujah
[1:30:31] it's from this verse where the Hebrew
[1:30:33] word is halal which describes praising
[1:30:36] Yahweh proudly to others
[1:30:39] praising God proudly to others it's
[1:30:43] focused on the Deeds of God and not on
[1:30:46] pride in self
[1:30:48] the word hallelujah means praise Yahweh
[1:30:51] or praise our God it's derived from that
[1:30:54] term it's focused on praising God not
[1:30:56] for what he does but for who he is not
[1:30:59] for what he's given but because he is
[1:31:01] the giver not because everything is
[1:31:03] right but in spite of everything being
[1:31:05] wrong you're still God
[1:31:09] Psalm 34 3 hold magnify the Lord with me
[1:31:12] let us exalt his name together I sought
[1:31:15] the Lord and he heard me and delivered
[1:31:18] me from all my fears they looked unto
[1:31:20] him and were enlightened that means they
[1:31:21] were radiant their faces were not
[1:31:23] ashamed that word in the Hebrew is
[1:31:25] joyfully satisfied
[1:31:27] this poor man cried and the Lord heard
[1:31:29] him have you ever had him hear you when
[1:31:31] you cried saved him out of all his
[1:31:33] troubles the angel of the Lord in campus
[1:31:35] round about them that fear him and
[1:31:37] delivereth him hear his pavement about
[1:31:39] to be stoned everybody's a church that's
[1:31:41] turned against him everybody's mad at
[1:31:43] him he's down there by himself and he
[1:31:44] begins to worship God
[1:31:46] encourage himself in the Lord
[1:31:49] see David didn't encourage himself by
[1:31:51] saying you're the greatest David you're
[1:31:52] anointed
[1:31:54] think about it look at the Psalms
[1:31:57] encourages himself by saying God you're
[1:31:59] God
[1:32:01] you are God
[1:32:10] encourage himself with praise
[1:32:12] that was a new song by the way when he
[1:32:14] sang it some people have a problem with
[1:32:16] new songs I'm all right with new songs
[1:32:17] songs the words are right
[1:32:21] and it's not rock and roll something
[1:32:23] like that you understand there's some
[1:32:25] music that's wrong just the music of
[1:32:27] it's wrong there's some music that's
[1:32:28] wrong but I'll tell you what if it's a
[1:32:30] new song and it says come magnify the
[1:32:32] Lord with me I'll sing it with David
[1:32:34] that was a new song and in his worst
[1:32:36] moment
[1:32:37] he cried out
[1:32:39] magnify the Lord with me
[1:32:42] Hallelujah
[1:32:44] he had just written that
[1:32:46] when that happened
[1:32:48] many years later
[1:32:50] Isaiah's prophecy narrowed it down even
[1:32:52] further but not only be in the line of
[1:32:54] Judah but a virgin would conceive a
[1:32:57] virgin wouldn't be by the strength of a
[1:32:59] man but a virgin would conceive
[1:33:01] and Mary is found to be that virgin that
[1:33:03] says be it unto me according to your
[1:33:05] word and she begins to cry out she was
[1:33:08] laughed at she was made fun of she knew
[1:33:11] her whole life would be troubled because
[1:33:12] of this situation but she cries out to
[1:33:15] God and Mary said my soul doth magnify
[1:33:18] the Lord my spirit hath rejoiced in God
[1:33:20] my savior what is it a prophecy of
[1:33:23] praise
[1:33:24] his he said for he that is mighty have
[1:33:26] done to me great things holy is his name
[1:33:28] his Mercy is on them to fear Him from
[1:33:30] generation to generation he has showed
[1:33:32] strength with his arm he has scattered
[1:33:34] the proud of the imagination of their
[1:33:35] hearts he had put down the mighty from
[1:33:37] their feet exalted them of low degree he
[1:33:39] had filled the Hungry with Good Things
[1:33:41] Are You full this morning of good things
[1:33:43] he did that
[1:33:45] and the rich he has sent empty away he
[1:33:47] is hoping his servant Israel in
[1:33:49] remembrance of his Mercy as he spoke to
[1:33:51] our fathers to Abraham and to his seed
[1:33:53] forever what was it a mother's prophecy
[1:33:55] of praise
[1:33:57] married to with no pain
[1:34:00] she was no pain a body and pain of mind
[1:34:05] she knew what it was like
[1:34:07] be in pain and not be able to help her
[1:34:09] own child
[1:34:11] a child that God had given her you know
[1:34:13] it was completely God God created the
[1:34:15] blood cell he created the egg
[1:34:18] but yet Mary birthed it
[1:34:21] oh God that's the way the new birth is
[1:34:24] God creates a new creature in you and
[1:34:26] yet you have to bear it
[1:34:30] oh God
[1:34:31] oh my
[1:34:33] and Simeon when he prophesied to her he
[1:34:35] said behold this child is set for the
[1:34:37] fall and Rising again of many in Israel
[1:34:38] for a sign which shall be spoken against
[1:34:40] your sword shall pierce through thine
[1:34:42] own soul also as the thoughts of many
[1:34:45] hearts may be revealed
[1:34:48] he is the Redeemer he will have to die
[1:34:50] he's a man of sorrow acquainted with
[1:34:51] creep he had to shed his blood for the
[1:34:53] Redemption of Leah for the Redemption of
[1:34:55] Rachel for the Redemption of Mary
[1:34:57] herself
[1:34:58] he had to be bruised to bruise the head
[1:35:00] of the serpent
[1:35:03] but yet the Bible tells us that for the
[1:35:04] joy that was set before him he endured
[1:35:06] the cross despising the shame it sat
[1:35:08] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:35:09] God what Joy is that you ask
[1:35:12] brother Brandon said when Christ was
[1:35:13] here on Earth he was crowned to the
[1:35:15] crown of thorns
[1:35:16] to shed the blood he said that's right
[1:35:19] but every believer that comes through
[1:35:21] that shed blood have you come through
[1:35:22] the shed blood today every believer that
[1:35:25] comes through that shed blood pulls
[1:35:27] forth that crown of thorns and crowns
[1:35:29] him with Glory of praises and honor
[1:35:32] that's what I want to do today I want to
[1:35:35] take off that Crown of Thorns that was
[1:35:37] put there for me I want to take it off
[1:35:39] of his precious head and I want to put a
[1:35:41] crown on him not a crown of thorns not a
[1:35:43] crown of my troubles and my worries but
[1:35:45] I want to crown him with Glory of
[1:35:47] praises and honor every believer he said
[1:35:51] that steps into his presence accepts
[1:35:53] that blood from his pressed brow here
[1:35:55] with thorns and crowns him with glory
[1:35:57] and praises and Majesty I want to crown
[1:35:59] him this morning don't you I may be
[1:36:01] going through struggle but I want to
[1:36:03] crowd him king of kings and Lord of
[1:36:05] lords crown him Lord of our life as king
[1:36:07] of kings as healer as Alpha Omega that's
[1:36:10] the beginning and ending as the
[1:36:12] counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty
[1:36:13] God the Everlasting father
[1:36:16] Hallelujah
[1:36:21] after Jesus ascended
[1:36:24] there was another benjamined
[1:36:27] another son of Rachel
[1:36:29] named Saul
[1:36:31] but he met
[1:36:33] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:36:36] he was looking
[1:36:39] oh God he was looking for the lion of
[1:36:41] Judas physical or spiritual descendants
[1:36:44] looking to kill him just like King Saul
[1:36:46] did fulfilling his Destiny but he met
[1:36:50] the lion of the tribe of Judah on the
[1:36:51] way to Damascus one day in the form of
[1:36:53] the pillar of Fire
[1:36:55] and when he met him by natural birth he
[1:36:57] was a benjamite but by spiritual birth
[1:37:00] he comes as we everyone do Under the
[1:37:02] prophecy of Leah sons of God are born at
[1:37:05] Bethlehem how many believe that today
[1:37:07] children of God are born at Bethlehem
[1:37:10] what does that mean it means you're in
[1:37:11] the line of Judah
[1:37:13] spiritual Seed of Abraham people of
[1:37:16] praise
[1:37:17] Hallelujah
[1:37:19] verse 22.
[1:37:22] and the multitude
[1:37:23] rose up together against them what was
[1:37:25] this Paul been preaching got in trouble
[1:37:27] that'll get you in trouble quicker than
[1:37:28] anything else preaching
[1:37:31] preaching the gospel with a man named
[1:37:32] Silas
[1:37:33] also a spiritual Seed of Abraham
[1:37:37] and the magistrates ran off their
[1:37:38] clothes and commanded to beat them when
[1:37:41] they laid many stripes upon them they
[1:37:43] cast them into prison charging the
[1:37:45] Jailer to keep them safely who having
[1:37:47] received such a charge because these
[1:37:49] guys had a habit of getting out of jail
[1:37:52] Hallelujah and so you haven't received
[1:37:55] such a charge he thrust them in the
[1:37:57] inner prison made their feet fast in the
[1:37:59] stalks and at midnight
[1:38:01] Paul and Silas prayed
[1:38:04] and encourage themselves
[1:38:06] in the Lord
[1:38:08] they sang Praises unto God
[1:38:12] you say well I just keep my my prayers
[1:38:14] in my head
[1:38:16] I keep my Praises in my head that's not
[1:38:19] what Paul and Silas did
[1:38:21] sometimes it takes great pain to get the
[1:38:23] Praises out of our head and into our
[1:38:25] mouths on our lips
[1:38:27] but he loves to hear it
[1:38:31] you imagine how pleasing that was to God
[1:38:34] here they were they've been beaten their
[1:38:37] back was stuck to the mire and the grime
[1:38:39] there was rats running across their feet
[1:38:41] they were in the inner prison no light
[1:38:43] at all
[1:38:44] and while they're in there what are we
[1:38:46] going to do brother Paul if you hadn't
[1:38:48] led me in here I tell you what I'd be a
[1:38:50] free man
[1:38:52] if you hadn't preached that sermon I
[1:38:53] tell you what we we'd have a bigger
[1:38:56] church today people would treat us right
[1:38:57] if you hadn't done that boy we'd be
[1:39:00] better off
[1:39:01] it's not what Silas did
[1:39:03] Paul might have said silence if you'd
[1:39:05] have been a better subordinate if you'd
[1:39:07] have been a better co-missionary then we
[1:39:09] wouldn't have been in this situation
[1:39:10] what are you doing what are you doing
[1:39:11] down here in this place what are we
[1:39:13] doing in this place are you are you just
[1:39:15] uh are you just did you not have the
[1:39:17] mind of the Lord they could have been
[1:39:19] sitting there accusing one another
[1:39:20] griping at one another and discouraging
[1:39:23] one another but instead of doing that
[1:39:24] they said let's sing a song together
[1:39:26] let's say a prayer and let's sing a song
[1:39:28] and they prayed a prayer and they begin
[1:39:30] to sing and the year of God heard it
[1:39:32] amen just like he heard Leah when she
[1:39:35] was going through her struggles he heard
[1:39:36] he heard Paul and Silas
[1:39:44] there's no worship like Worship in a
[1:39:46] jail cell
[1:39:48] I think about it
[1:39:50] everybody says I worship when I'm free
[1:39:52] now you worship when you're bound to get
[1:39:55] free
[1:39:58] that's the biblical order of it
[1:40:01] well I'll wait until my well when this
[1:40:04] leaves me when all these troubles I get
[1:40:06] over them no it's when you're going
[1:40:07] through some things
[1:40:09] and you worship God anyway
[1:40:12] hallelujah oh God help me today
[1:40:14] I I've just I'll be honest with you this
[1:40:17] week and I'm I'm closing in just a
[1:40:18] moment this week I've been going through
[1:40:20] some things just in my own mind I did it
[1:40:22] to myself it's just my own mind I've
[1:40:24] been going through some things and and
[1:40:26] struggling with some things and been
[1:40:27] down a little bit but in those moments
[1:40:29] it's in those moments I realize that's
[1:40:31] what God wants he wants me to sing
[1:40:33] during those times he wants me to go
[1:40:35] ahead and preach during those times he
[1:40:36] wants me to worship him like never
[1:40:38] before during those times you might be
[1:40:40] sick today but that sickness is there
[1:40:42] for a reason God he's already healed you
[1:40:45] then if you're not don't feel well this
[1:40:47] morning Now's the Time to praise God if
[1:40:49] you don't yet people say well I'll go to
[1:40:51] church when I feel like it know the time
[1:40:52] to go to church is when you don't feel
[1:40:54] like it and everything's against you and
[1:40:56] the world seems like it's turned upside
[1:40:58] down you go to the house of God and you
[1:41:00] say I'm going to begin to praise him
[1:41:01] that's what David taught us that's what
[1:41:03] he did over and over again I'm gonna
[1:41:05] praise him now in spite of my
[1:41:07] difficulties I'm gonna praise him now in
[1:41:09] spite of the the hardship of this
[1:41:11] childbirth
[1:41:13] or Praise Him
[1:41:18] suddenly
[1:41:20] great earthquake
[1:41:22] so that the foundations of the prison
[1:41:23] were shaken
[1:41:25] immediately all the doors were open
[1:41:27] everyone's banned we're loose brother
[1:41:29] Brown said Paul and Silas must have
[1:41:31] talked about the Lord until about
[1:41:32] midnight and then began to sing him some
[1:41:34] good old Christian song he said oh if
[1:41:36] we'd sing today we'd sing there's power
[1:41:38] in the blood or how I love Jesus or
[1:41:39] something like that when they begin to
[1:41:41] sing all of a sudden an earthquake
[1:41:43] struck the place and notice how it done
[1:41:45] instead of piling those walls of that
[1:41:47] big old building right in on top of them
[1:41:49] and mashing them to death it shook the
[1:41:51] walls away from them not only that but
[1:41:54] it broke the stocks and bars loose from
[1:41:56] them and they were set free see you
[1:41:58] think the shaking that's going on is
[1:42:00] going to pile the walls on top of you
[1:42:01] you think the shaking that's going on in
[1:42:03] politics is going to just pile on top of
[1:42:06] you and you're going to end up with no
[1:42:07] food and no water and no money in the
[1:42:09] bank but you're a child of God you're a
[1:42:11] son or a daughter of the king that
[1:42:13] shaking is not going to pile on top of
[1:42:15] you but that shaking is to shake the
[1:42:17] walls down so you can get out are you
[1:42:19] hearing me today you think the shaking
[1:42:21] going on in your family is because that
[1:42:24] it's going to fall down on you and
[1:42:25] you're going to be destroyed but he has
[1:42:27] not anointed you for Destruction he has
[1:42:29] not called you for Destruction he has
[1:42:31] called you to be a Son of God called you
[1:42:33] to be a daughter of God he's anointed
[1:42:35] you to rise up you is anointing you to
[1:42:37] be the bride then you need to be the
[1:42:38] bride today the walls will not destroy
[1:42:41] you the walls of Jericho could not
[1:42:43] destroy Rahab the walls of the prison
[1:42:45] could not destroy Paul and Silas
[1:42:51] oh thank God
[1:42:55] oh thank God
[1:42:59] the walls
[1:43:01] fell all around them but they weren't
[1:43:02] touched by them
[1:43:07] they were free
[1:43:11] the Bible says in everything
[1:43:15] musicians go ahead and come when the
[1:43:17] house is a mess
[1:43:19] give thanks
[1:43:20] what's hard in it
[1:43:24] we want to appear to be something to
[1:43:26] somebody else just let go and give
[1:43:27] thanks
[1:43:29] I don't say that you should not do your
[1:43:30] job but I say this it's more important
[1:43:33] to praise
[1:43:35] than it is to have every all your ducks
[1:43:37] in a row
[1:43:38] it's more important to put God in his
[1:43:41] place than to put the dishes in their
[1:43:43] place
[1:43:46] and yet you serve God in that way but
[1:43:48] it's in those moments when it seems like
[1:43:50] nothing is going right when the kids
[1:43:52] won't behave I will praise the Lord
[1:43:57] when the when the husband won't behave
[1:44:00] I will praise the Lord
[1:44:03] that was a joke
[1:44:07] are you with me though no matter what's
[1:44:09] going through what you're going through
[1:44:11] I will praise the Lord and that prophecy
[1:44:13] in your life oh God
[1:44:16] will make a difference to somebody else
