[32:10] want to ever lose sight of that father I
[32:13] pray that your spirit would be real in
[32:15] this place today and Lord may we come
[32:20] down to the word Lord where we cope with
[32:22] the word of God this morning Lord we
[32:25] don't want to just be someone that
[32:27] sympathizes with it or agrees that it's
[32:30] true or we want to live the word we want
[32:34] to cope with it we want to these things
[32:36] that we've been preaching to be more
[32:38] than just an abstract theory but Lord
[32:41] may it be a reality in our lives Lord
[32:45] that if there's anything that would not
[32:46] be right and anything that would be
[32:49] insufficient in our lives our on where
[32:52] we would not deal with things like we
[32:54] should I pray that you take it out Lord
[32:56] it just moving the service this morning
[32:59] I pray for every one Lord that is in
[33:03] need father I think of different ones
[33:05] that are sick Lord and some that are
[33:07] gone I pray that you just move Lord and
[33:10] just give them strength and the ability
[33:13] to do what they need to do we ask it in
[33:15] Jesus name
[33:17] amen amen god bless you turn with me if
[33:22] you would to the scriptures this morning
[33:26] we're going to read from Leviticus
[33:29] chapter 25 and verse 23 it's good to see
[33:33] everyone in the house of the Lord we'll
[33:34] just read that one verse Leviticus 25 23
[33:37] so I'll give you a second to turn there
[33:39] it's always good to be in the house of
[33:41] the Lord and this week I've been
[33:45] troubled as many of you have been by the
[33:49] things that are going on in this country
[33:50] we see problems situations on every hand
[33:54] and you look at something that happens
[33:57] and there's always an overreaction to
[33:59] that and an overreaction to that and and
[34:01] it just seems like it's spiraling out of
[34:03] control and but you know we have to
[34:07] remember that we're pilgrims here we
[34:10] don't belong here the reason why we feel
[34:14] like we don't there's so much going on
[34:16] it seems like it's out of control but
[34:18] we're not from here and so we don't get
[34:20] caught up in that and brother Branham
[34:22] taught us that it's it's demons fighting
[34:25] with each other so what it is the Satan
[34:27] is the Prince of the power of the air
[34:29] and these demons actually fight with one
[34:32] another and me does people are under the
[34:34] influence of that and they don't even
[34:35] realize what they're doing but we're
[34:38] under the influence of a different
[34:39] spirit and so we can during these times
[34:42] but pray for your country remember to
[34:45] love one another and we caught up in the
[34:47] culture but remember that we're here for
[34:50] another purpose we're going home we're
[34:53] not gonna stay here this isn't our
[34:55] long-term home you know when people
[34:57] complain about the injustice and the
[34:59] things that have gone on and I'm sure
[35:00] there is injustice there always will be
[35:03] in any government of this earth remember
[35:06] we can invite them to a place where
[35:09] there's no injustice come with me and we
[35:11] we know a place we know a city that
[35:14] we're going to where there's no problems
[35:16] no no we don't have to enforce any kind
[35:21] of racial harmony because ever all one
[35:25] and so that's the place that we're going
[35:27] to and so we're thankful for that today
[35:30] Leviticus 25 23 the land shall not be
[35:35] sold forever the land is mine for your
[35:40] strangers and sojourners with me your
[35:45] strangers it's a good thing to remember
[35:47] and sojourners with me I pray the Lord
[35:51] would add his blessing to the word you
[35:52] may be seated
[35:56] we've been talking about the abstract
[35:58] and this morning I want to speak to you
[36:00] about enforcing your rights we realize
[36:04] that the abstract has come and for many
[36:08] of us that are sealed by the Holy Ghost
[36:09] were sealed to the day of our redemption
[36:11] and yet we've struggled many times with
[36:14] enforcing the rights that we have and
[36:16] the children of Israel had the same
[36:19] problem their land which correlates to
[36:22] the promises of the New Testament the
[36:24] land the physical land of the Old
[36:26] Testament could not be sold forever and
[36:29] yet it was rare that they actually lived
[36:34] on it and was able to benefit from the
[36:37] land if you look down to the Old
[36:40] Testament it was it was rare the times
[36:43] that they could actually live on and
[36:45] enjoy it the way that they were supposed
[36:47] to but they actually constantly were
[36:51] going into sin and and go being under
[36:54] this country under that country and
[36:56] losing the land and so you find that the
[36:59] idea of redemption the idea the land
[37:02] can't be sold forever
[37:03] very rarely came into effect but really
[37:08] under the law the land could not be sold
[37:11] it could only be used for 49 years so
[37:15] the value of the land to a purchaser at
[37:17] any time would never be as high as the
[37:20] value to the one who owned it to the
[37:23] family who owned that land that Joshua
[37:25] had given that land and so the highest
[37:28] point was only the use of it for 49
[37:31] years and then there would have to come
[37:33] a day of Jubilee
[37:34] and there would come a day because he
[37:36] said the land is not yours it's mine and
[37:38] we have to recognize that that's the
[37:41] case when it comes to our promises
[37:43] that the promises are yen a man in
[37:45] Christ they belong to God and so he's
[37:48] not going to back up on his promises his
[37:51] promises are always going to be true no
[37:54] matter what we do in the meantime but we
[37:57] have to learn to enforce our rights to
[38:00] those promises so there in theory every
[38:05] man could live in peace on land that had
[38:07] always been in his family and the
[38:09] scripture speaks of a concept of each
[38:12] man being under his vine and under his
[38:14] fig tree and we find that in first Kings
[38:18] 425 that it was a saying that that they
[38:21] used and it said in Judah and Israel
[38:23] dwelt safely every man under his vine
[38:27] and under his fig tree from and even to
[38:30] BIR Sheba all the days of Solomon now
[38:34] this was Israel's Golden Age it was
[38:38] Israel's time that they could live
[38:40] together and that they would be able to
[38:43] actually enforce the rights to their
[38:47] property it was the time when things
[38:50] worked like they should and the reason
[38:53] is because title to land is only as good
[38:56] as your willingness and ability to
[38:58] enforce it and what we found that in
[39:02] this country the reason why title is
[39:04] considered good is because we have good
[39:07] government we do and it don't seem like
[39:10] it but we have good government and what
[39:13] that means is we're under a system of
[39:15] government where you can enforce your
[39:16] rights so I can go up to the courthouse
[39:20] and Ike if someone is living on my
[39:22] property I can enforce my right to it
[39:25] under the law I have a right to it I can
[39:27] enforce that right under Solomon the
[39:30] people could go and enforce the rights
[39:33] that they have now there's always going
[39:35] to be a contest for the land and I want
[39:39] us to understand today that no matter
[39:41] how sealed you are and how how how much
[39:45] you're Christian you're always going to
[39:47] have a contest there's always going to
[39:49] be somebody an adversary that's going to
[39:51] be there and gonna say I want that and
[39:54] he's going to try to take away your
[39:56] Joy's going
[39:56] take away your piece he's gonna try to
[39:58] take away your healing he's even gonna
[40:00] try to cause you to commit sin he's
[40:03] always gonna be there he's always there
[40:07] but remember when he's there you have an
[40:10] officer the Holy Ghost that can go in
[40:12] and enforce the rights to your land now
[40:17] under Solomon under that administration
[40:20] the people had a good king all they had
[40:23] to do was ask the king and rights would
[40:26] be enforced all they had to do was was
[40:30] petition the king under other
[40:34] administration's even though they were
[40:36] Israelite administration's rights were
[40:39] not so easily enforced in Micah chapter
[40:43] 2 and verse 1 the prophet Mike is
[40:46] speaking to those who would take
[40:48] advantage of the people not being able
[40:50] to enforce the rights he said woe to
[40:53] them that devise iniquity work evil upon
[40:56] their beds when the morning is light
[40:58] they practice it listen because it is in
[41:01] the power of their hand listen to me
[41:05] this morning it's the biggest indication
[41:07] of a lack of integrity and character in
[41:10] your life is what happens when you have
[41:11] the power to do something whether you do
[41:15] it or not and that goes to how we raise
[41:19] our children how we treat our spouses it
[41:21] goes to how we treat one another at
[41:23] church because just because you have the
[41:26] ability to do something if you do it and
[41:28] that's where someone with it with a
[41:30] uniform on for you put it that way has a
[41:32] great responsibility right because they
[41:36] have to they have to enforce the laws
[41:39] but they have the power to take
[41:42] someone's life we give them a gun and a
[41:44] badge because they have the power to do
[41:46] that but that takes character and the
[41:49] problem that we have today is not a it's
[41:52] not so much that there's people say what
[41:54] a systemic it's not so much that the
[41:56] laws are the same most of them as they
[41:58] were but the problem is to people
[42:01] because you've got men without character
[42:04] women without character people without
[42:06] character so something will happen they
[42:09] take advantage of the situation
[42:11] so characters what you do and you think
[42:14] there are no consequences and the
[42:15] prophet Micah cries out against that he
[42:18] said it's in the power of their hand to
[42:19] do it and so they do it he says and they
[42:21] covet fields and take them by violence
[42:25] houses and take them away so they
[42:27] oppress a man in this house even a man
[42:30] and his heritage and then you find that
[42:36] under some administration's there was
[42:38] such wickedness in the land that the
[42:41] king who would be the protector of the
[42:43] people's rights for the j.t
[42:45] actually himself became the one who
[42:49] coveted the people's lands and here in
[42:54] the story of Ahab in a Boston you can go
[42:58] read it I won't read the whole thing to
[42:59] save time but in first Kings 21 3 it
[43:03] says they've all said they have the Lord
[43:05] forbid at me but I should give the
[43:07] inheritance of my fathers unto thee so
[43:10] he comes and offers to buy it from him
[43:12] and they bought understanding this
[43:14] belongs to me I'm not going to give it
[43:18] up Eastside and many times before Satan
[43:21] will begin to fight you on something
[43:23] he'll actually try to get it get you to
[43:26] give it to him and most of the time we
[43:29] don't give him as big a fight as we
[43:31] should but I think we ought to stand up
[43:33] like neighbor said the Lord forbid it to
[43:36] me that I should give up what is mine I
[43:39] should give up what is the inheritance
[43:41] of my father's God promised me I could
[43:44] have deliverance God promised me I could
[43:47] I could work these fields out I was
[43:49] given a promise my father handed down to
[43:52] me and a distractor said
[43:53] this belongs to you healing belongs to
[43:56] you salvation belongs to you a holiness
[43:59] belongs to you all these things belong
[44:01] to me so I have a right to enforce those
[44:04] things so he says god forbid that I
[44:10] should give the inheritance of my
[44:12] father's unto thee we're too quick to
[44:16] let the devil steal from us take it from
[44:20] us because we think well where there's
[44:23] no way but look
[44:24] we end up having the attitude that the
[44:26] man did when he said well my Master's a
[44:28] hard man I'll just bury his talent in
[44:30] the dirt I won't do anything with it so
[44:33] I'll have it when he comes back no no
[44:36] you've got to you've got to be a good
[44:38] steward as we spoke of Wednesday night
[44:39] to be faithful to the things that God
[44:41] has given you because it's the
[44:44] inheritance of your father's and you
[44:46] live under the administration the kind
[44:49] of administration like Solomon so that
[44:51] you are able to enforce your rights in
[44:55] the land now
[44:59] Jezebel got wind of what Ahab was doing
[45:04] you remember Ahab went back to his house
[45:06] and got real sad wouldn't eat and
[45:11] Jezebel went after him and of course
[45:13] Jezebel being who she was she's got no
[45:15] conscience and she comes through she
[45:18] says well I'll take care of it for you
[45:20] and so they have weights you know and
[45:24] Jezebel starts writing letters and
[45:26] signing Ahab's name to him and invite
[45:28] invite him to a feast get him falsely
[45:31] accused of something of blasphemy and
[45:33] then he ends up being killed and in 1st
[45:38] Kings 21 16 it came to pass when they
[45:40] have heard that Namath was dead that
[45:42] Ahab grows up to go down to the vineyard
[45:46] if they bought the jezreelite to take
[45:49] possession of it and the word of the
[45:53] lord came to elijah the tishbite saying
[45:56] arise go down to meet a hab king of
[45:59] Israel
[46:00] which is in Samaria behold he is in the
[46:02] vineyard of naboth whether he's gone
[46:05] down to possess it so he's gone down
[46:09] this this ungodly King has gone down
[46:12] into the land to take possession of what
[46:15] was God's people's what was one of God's
[46:18] sons he goes down into the land and God
[46:22] sends a prophet brother Bill to meet him
[46:24] there and to declare the land does
[46:27] evolve to you the land doesn't murong in
[46:30] a denominational system the land doesn't
[46:33] belong under treats and dogmas but the
[46:36] land he said belongs
[46:38] to neighbor to the family of God to the
[46:41] person it was given to he said he's
[46:45] going down to possess it national
[46:46] speaking to him saying thus saith the
[46:48] LORD hath so killed and also taken
[46:51] possession and also speaking to him
[46:54] saying thus saith the Lord in the place
[46:56] where dogs licked the blood of nabe off
[46:59] show dogs lick thy blood even thine and
[47:05] this is why this prophecy was made now
[47:09] look as Christians we have rights to
[47:13] every promise made in the scripture
[47:15] that's our land let's go to Galatians
[47:19] chapter 3 I want to put this as I've
[47:21] said before Paul puts this sometimes in
[47:23] a way that is better than I could put it
[47:26] and so we're looking to the Word of God
[47:27] and just see how Paul puts this about
[47:30] the promises of God in Galatians 3:15
[47:33] said brethren I speak after the manner
[47:36] of men though it be but a man's covenant
[47:39] and if it be confirmed if there's a seal
[47:43] on it if the parties have agreed to it
[47:46] we would say today if you've gone and
[47:48] recorded at this courthouse it's done no
[47:53] man dis Anolis or at us there too
[47:56] and what this means is you can't
[47:58] unilaterally change the contract and
[48:02] this is true of beats when someone gives
[48:04] you a deed to land they can't go back
[48:06] and say oops I messed up I gave you too
[48:08] much I'll just sign another deed and
[48:10] take it away people try to do that but
[48:12] it's not legal they can't just do that
[48:15] they have to get you to agree to it
[48:17] because the land passed from their hands
[48:20] into yours right and so the covenant was
[48:25] made between two parties and so the
[48:27] contract was finished unless there was
[48:30] consent by both parties now so he said
[48:33] even a covenant of man is that way once
[48:35] it's confirmed nobody goes and changes
[48:37] it nobody says well just don't matter
[48:39] anymore
[48:40] because both parties had to agree to
[48:42] that verse 16 says down to Abraham and
[48:46] his seed were the promises made he saith
[48:49] not and to seeds as
[48:50] of many but as of one and to thy seed
[48:54] which is Christ and this I say that the
[48:58] covenant that was confirmed before of
[49:00] God in Christ the law which was four
[49:03] hundred and thirty years after cannot
[49:05] dissing all so he's saying God made a
[49:08] promise to Abraham and the law couldn't
[49:11] come later I love the word of God he
[49:15] couldn't come later and change the terms
[49:18] of the contract and so Paul was making
[49:21] the argument that is by faith because it
[49:23] was my faith in the beginning it was by
[49:26] faith to Abraham so if Abraham was able
[49:29] to get a hold of the promises of God by
[49:31] faith then we are able to get a hold of
[49:33] the promises of God by faith he's saying
[49:35] the law could not change that covenant
[49:39] right now
[49:40] he said the law which was 430 years
[49:43] after cannot dissin all that it should
[49:45] make the promise of none effect for if
[49:46] the inheritance be of the law it is no
[49:49] more promise but God gave it to Abraham
[49:51] by promise see you can't take the deed
[49:55] you can't take the promise that was
[49:56] given to Abraham and then say ok I gave
[49:58] it to you but I'm gonna change it I'm
[50:01] gonna add a law to it I'm gonna add
[50:03] these works that you've got to do no
[50:05] it's my faith right
[50:08] we're justified by faith and so he says
[50:11] God gave it to Abraham he said by
[50:14] promise wherefore then serveth law it
[50:18] was added because of transgressions till
[50:21] the seed should come to whom the promise
[50:24] was made so he makes the argument that
[50:27] the promise was made there but it was
[50:29] made to Abraham's seed singular which is
[50:32] Christ so he says the seed should come
[50:37] to whom the promise was made it was
[50:38] ordained by angels in the hand of a
[50:41] mediator so this law was ordained by
[50:44] angels in the hand of a mediator and he
[50:47] says now a mediator is not a mediator of
[50:49] one but God is one so God brought the
[50:51] law down to Moses and dealt with the
[50:54] people through Moses but it did not
[50:57] change the original covenant now look
[51:02] the promise to Abraham was
[51:04] not between two parties now that that
[51:07] verse 20 if you'll back up to that
[51:09] Galatians 3:28 he said now a mediator is
[51:12] not a mediator of one this is a hard
[51:14] verse for many people to understand he
[51:16] said but God is one but what he's saying
[51:19] is that if there's a mediator if you
[51:21] have Moses if you have Moses then
[51:25] there's two parties he says but God is
[51:28] one what God made a promise by himself
[51:33] he swore and he made an unconditional
[51:36] promise so when God spoke to Abraham he
[51:39] didn't say I will if you will he said I
[51:43] will he made the promise to him and he
[51:48] said I will do this now he thought God
[51:52] is one that he it was only him so he is
[51:55] the only one that could make the promise
[51:58] and he is the one who enforces it now it
[52:00] was not between two parties it was all
[52:02] gone so verse 21 he said it's the law
[52:04] then against the promises of God god
[52:06] forbid for if there had been a law given
[52:07] which could have given life verily
[52:09] righteousness should have been by the
[52:11] law but the scripture hath concluded all
[52:14] under sin that the promise by faith of
[52:18] Jesus Christ might be given to them that
[52:22] believe to them that believe and that's
[52:25] us he said but before faith came we were
[52:28] kept under the law shut up unto the
[52:31] faith which should afterwards be
[52:32] revealed wherefore the law was our
[52:35] schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ
[52:37] that we might be justified by faith but
[52:41] after that faith has come we are no
[52:44] longer under schoolmaster you're all the
[52:47] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[52:50] he says for as many of us have been
[52:53] baptized into Christ to put on Christ
[52:56] there is neither Jew nor Greek there is
[53:00] neither bond nor free there is neither
[53:03] male nor female you're all one in Christ
[53:06] Jesus that's the promise that's in our
[53:13] inheritance
[53:16] and and so we realized even though in
[53:18] the flesh
[53:19] we're under men and women are under
[53:21] different covenants but not according to
[53:24] the promise and we're going back to a
[53:27] place where there's neither male nor
[53:29] female neither bond nor free and in
[53:31] Christ now there's neither bond nor free
[53:33] neither male nor female are you with me
[53:36] now you're just as much a child of God
[53:38] as someone who's free if you're bound
[53:41] just much a child of God a male or a
[53:44] female you're all one in Christ Jesus we
[53:46] can say it this way a black man a white
[53:48] man a Chinese or anything else whatever
[53:51] color of your skin whatever your past
[53:54] has been whatever whatever you are
[53:56] whatever you've done if you believe if
[54:00] you can believe if you can come to God
[54:02] and you can accept God at his terms and
[54:05] you receive the Holy Ghost and what
[54:07] happens that makes you a partaker of the
[54:10] promises of God just as much as anybody
[54:13] else now he said for the promise now
[54:20] what what promise was this Acts 239 he
[54:25] said if if you be Christ in you're
[54:26] Abraham's seed and heirs according to
[54:28] the promise and that promise the next
[54:29] 239 he said the promise is unto you now
[54:33] that's pretty pretty straightforward
[54:36] isn't it the promise is unto you what is
[54:40] the promise to be an heir how do we
[54:43] become an heir we become an error we
[54:46] were always God's children we don't
[54:48] become sons but we take our inheritance
[54:52] when we receive the abstract then we can
[54:55] take advantage of it you were a son but
[54:58] it didn't do you a whole lot of good you
[55:00] lived in sin you did what sinners do but
[55:02] now you can take advantage of what's
[55:05] already yours you with me now you can
[55:08] take advantage through the process of
[55:10] the death of Christ a burial
[55:12] resurrection and now the return of the
[55:14] abstract the promise is unto you and to
[55:16] your children to all that are afar off
[55:19] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[55:22] call
[55:23] aren't you glad he's still calling
[55:26] aren't you glad he's still working I
[55:30] would hate to be and eyed people
[55:32] sometimes we we get in the weeds and we
[55:35] forget the big picture and the big
[55:38] picture is we need mercy the big picture
[55:41] is we still need the death of Christ on
[55:43] a cross and someone say that they didn't
[55:46] want to hear what happened 2,000 years
[55:48] ago well that is what matters most in
[55:51] your life is what happened 2,000 years
[55:54] ago and that doesn't change but you got
[55:58] to take advantage of it today but now
[56:01] the promise is unto you to your children
[56:04] to all that are afar off even as many as
[56:06] the Lord our God shall corner brother
[56:07] Brown says the Holy Ghost is our witness
[56:10] here's the proof here's the proof he is
[56:18] the field and so we need him we need
[56:24] that in our lives we need to have we
[56:26] need to receive the Holy Spirit because
[56:28] if we do not we don't have a seal if we
[56:32] do not we don't have proof is our proof
[56:38] now it won't prove to anybody else but
[56:41] it fruits to you right now you you could
[56:45] live because you could live the Holy
[56:47] Ghost could work through you and listen
[56:48] to you look at the example about the
[56:50] random brother branham God could heal
[56:51] people and everything else in his
[56:52] ministry and the Holy Ghost worked
[56:54] through him and you couldn't put a
[56:56] finger on his life and at the same time
[56:57] people called him a devil still the Holy
[57:00] Ghost wasn't approved to them as I've
[57:04] said before the cloud coming in and
[57:06] showing the face of Christ it's not
[57:07] proof to the unbeliever the unbelievers
[57:10] just they're just an unbeliever we're
[57:13] gonna say well something happen
[57:14] something happened and just made it that
[57:15] way but but we're believers so to us it
[57:19] is a proof and so we could say like they
[57:23] did when Jesus rose from the dead it has
[57:24] been many infallible proofs of his
[57:26] resurrection he's appeared to us but
[57:29] only to believers to those that would
[57:31] believe now we could say he said he is
[57:35] the bonafide rikes
[57:37] i watch that he is the
[57:40] ooph I'd rights what that means is
[57:43] modified means it's been proved to be
[57:44] true right he's my oh my
[57:49] he was proved to be a son of God he was
[57:55] proved to be able to live in a world
[57:56] without sin he was proved to be race
[58:00] risen again on the third day he proved
[58:02] that the word was true he proved that
[58:07] all the David rode and all that Moses
[58:09] wrote and everything else was true
[58:11] listen to me and when the Holy Spirit
[58:12] comes down on us it is proof to us in
[58:16] our life that that same word is true why
[58:19] because it's his spirit now he said he
[58:21] is the bonafide rights he is the
[58:23] abstract need to every word God spoke
[58:28] hey Ben he is the abstract need to every
[58:33] word God spoke he is a witness that
[58:38] Christ lifts because he lives we live
[58:45] also is the bonafide statement now we
[58:51] would take a statement today and if you
[58:55] were going to record a legal document
[58:56] they require you to take it before a
[58:58] notary public and the notary public says
[59:02] before me personally appeared John Doe
[59:04] and I know this is him and he signed his
[59:09] name so he's saying the Holy Ghost is
[59:12] our proof our seal our notary if you put
[59:16] it that way our acknowledgement that
[59:18] what we're saying is true that what we
[59:23] believe about a rapture is true what we
[59:26] believe about the second coming of
[59:28] Christ is true what we believe about the
[59:29] message of the hour is true the Holy
[59:33] Ghost is our proof now let's look at
[59:36] some things that the Holy Ghost proves
[59:37] in Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 5 says
[59:40] but he was wounded for our
[59:41] transgressions so we still believe this
[59:43] today he was wounded for our
[59:45] transgressions he was bruised for our
[59:47] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[59:49] was upon him with His stripes we are
[59:51] healed
[59:53] knowledge that this is true but the holy
[59:57] ghost proves it are you with me now we
[1:00:02] acknowledge that it's true I can say
[1:00:04] it's true I can say it looks like it's
[1:00:06] real I can say I have from the evidence
[1:00:09] that it looks like it's real but when
[1:00:10] the Holy Ghost comes then it makes it
[1:00:12] real now
[1:00:16] brotherbrother said well anything that
[1:00:19] Saints put upon you in the way of
[1:00:21] sickness or whatever it is he said every
[1:00:24] born-again person has an abstract
[1:00:26] warrant as a warrant from God and the
[1:00:30] Holy Spirit is here to put any devil out
[1:00:34] the Holy Spirit is here to put any devil
[1:00:38] out no matter if he is cancer tumor
[1:00:42] cataract whatever he is
[1:00:46] hey bad the Holy Spirit will put him out
[1:00:49] if you'll serve notice on him in the
[1:00:53] name of Jesus Christ because he has no
[1:00:56] legal rights he said I'm the Lord that
[1:00:59] healeth all thy diseases is that right
[1:01:01] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:01:03] with His stripes we were healed but
[1:01:05] you've got to go over and take it well
[1:01:11] said if you went to your home tonight
[1:01:13] he said you legitimate people and I I
[1:01:15] guess that means those of you who have a
[1:01:16] home and owned it and it's yours belongs
[1:01:20] to you
[1:01:20] you legitimate people he said there's a
[1:01:22] bunch of drunks in there kicking around
[1:01:25] carrying around smoking drinking cursing
[1:01:27] living in morally you'd say hey get out
[1:01:31] of here this is my house this is my
[1:01:36] house he'd say I'm a human being
[1:01:40] this was built for human beings I got it
[1:01:42] right here you'd say this is my house
[1:01:45] you know I got a living room we got some
[1:01:48] furniture and I long ago they had the
[1:01:50] couch and the loveseat and there's five
[1:01:53] there's five late or recliners in there
[1:01:56] and just kind of the way they make them
[1:01:59] anymore and so I got you know but I
[1:02:01] don't want a stranger on any one of them
[1:02:06] just because I got five recliners in my
[1:02:09] living room doesn't mean I look like a
[1:02:12] guy that would have five recliners in my
[1:02:14] living room don't I
[1:02:15] but just because I've got that doesn't
[1:02:18] mean that I want a stranger in any one
[1:02:20] of them then we got an offense in our
[1:02:23] house I think we got one more bed than
[1:02:24] we do people but I don't want a stranger
[1:02:27] in it
[1:02:28] I got enough food that for some people
[1:02:31] but I don't want a stranger in my house
[1:02:33] some of y'all come over that's fine but
[1:02:35] I don't want no strangers and I don't
[1:02:39] want nobody showing up unexpectedly no
[1:02:45] but you know how it is if if you come in
[1:02:47] even if it's me now you love me but if
[1:02:48] you come home and found me in your house
[1:02:50] you'd wonder how I got there
[1:02:53] what I'm doing there right and maybe
[1:02:59] there would be a legitimate reason but
[1:03:00] I'd have to explain myself that's right
[1:03:04] because it's your property it belongs to
[1:03:07] you you'd say he'd say I'm a human being
[1:03:09] this was built for human means I got a
[1:03:11] right here you'd say this is my house I
[1:03:13] have an abstract need that proves this
[1:03:16] is my property and then if you show him
[1:03:18] the deed and he will not move then there
[1:03:21] is a law down here that will make him
[1:03:23] move he said in a fat devil the come to
[1:03:29] you and I tried to send you to a
[1:03:31] premature grave tried to you up
[1:03:33] read God's abstract deed by His stripes
[1:03:38] we were healed he said if he don't want
[1:03:41] to believe that there's a Holy Ghost
[1:03:44] here the law of God that'll kick him out
[1:03:50] our rights have to be enforced if we
[1:03:54] never show up to enforce our rights and
[1:03:56] sometimes we just got to come God's
[1:03:58] provided way let our rights be enforced
[1:04:00] sometimes you've got to comment to the
[1:04:03] house of God when you don't feel like it
[1:04:05] and and sometimes you feel like you
[1:04:07] shouldn't come but but you come anyway
[1:04:09] because you know you want to enforce
[1:04:10] your rights because what happens and
[1:04:14] what maybe we'll get into this more
[1:04:15] later but what happens is the more you
[1:04:17] don't enforce those rights
[1:04:19] more he comes in and I've watched it
[1:04:22] over the years the more you give in and
[1:04:24] say well it's just too hard the more he
[1:04:27] will come and test you in that same area
[1:04:30] over and he'll keep testing you there
[1:04:32] until you build a defense against it he
[1:04:36] won't leave you alone it'll keep after
[1:04:38] you in that same air you don't think you
[1:04:39] say well I made a mistake but if you've
[1:04:41] struggled with that he's gonna keep
[1:04:43] coming at your weakness
[1:04:46] he's a ravening line looking to see whom
[1:04:49] he can devour and you find a lion will
[1:04:51] go after the weakest part of the body or
[1:04:53] the weakest part of the herd and he'll
[1:04:56] watch for him and he'll watch for him
[1:04:58] anyway and he's very patient because he
[1:05:00] won't fight the whole hurt he'd lose so
[1:05:03] he goes after a straggler he goes after
[1:05:05] someone with a weakness he watches for a
[1:05:08] he watches for one that's been
[1:05:09] hurt so church many times it's when we
[1:05:13] get this when we get hurt we
[1:05:15] think well I'll just back away from
[1:05:16] church I'll just backwards now so god no
[1:05:18] that's the time when we need to be right
[1:05:20] in the middle of the herd that's the
[1:05:22] time when we need to be right among
[1:05:24] those people and say Lord I'm gonna
[1:05:25] enforce my rights today well the brown
[1:05:34] said just ring up Jesus central Jes us
[1:05:42] now he said find out if something don't
[1:05:48] take place and you know we don't
[1:05:50] understand that I realized a few weeks
[1:05:53] ago that my kids don't ever have to
[1:05:56] spell anything on a phone you'd have a
[1:06:01] phone number be 1-800 abstract or
[1:06:04] whatever that it would be and you'd take
[1:06:05] those numbers you have to learn how to
[1:06:07] spell it on the phone my kids don't have
[1:06:08] to do that it just doesn't seem to be a
[1:06:11] thing anymore but back in the day you'd
[1:06:14] have to ring up central jesus j esus now
[1:06:19] the numbers find out if something don't
[1:06:21] take place the angels of God will take
[1:06:23] their positions and that devil will get
[1:06:26] out he said you can stand there on your
[1:06:29] toes and say yes sir it's the truth
[1:06:32] these
[1:06:33] not appear down here you've read your
[1:06:35] title clear you know what it is he said
[1:06:41] let the devil say oh don't you do it
[1:06:43] don't you do it
[1:06:43] he said that's that old nasty porter at
[1:06:46] the door that's not one of these
[1:06:50] brothers that greets you here at the
[1:06:52] church but you see he's at the doors
[1:06:53] your own home
[1:06:56] he says there's they don't do it don't
[1:06:59] do it don't no come in don't you don't
[1:07:01] you don't have a right to your healing
[1:07:02] don't don't go to church today don't
[1:07:05] believe God today don't read your Bible
[1:07:07] we'll see that nasty porter at the door
[1:07:09] he said don't you believe in that
[1:07:11] that's supporter what walk right on in
[1:07:14] though it's yours you got a pass you got
[1:07:17] an abstract need on the place
[1:07:19] if sickness dwells in there you got an
[1:07:22] abstract deed he says again if you went
[1:07:25] home tonight what if there's an enemy
[1:07:26] sitting in your house and the enemy said
[1:07:29] now wait a minute this house is built
[1:07:30] for human beings it's mined just as much
[1:07:32] as it is yours I'm as much human as you
[1:07:34] are
[1:07:34] he said you walked right down to the
[1:07:36] courts get your abstract deed show him
[1:07:38] this is my property it belongs to me
[1:07:40] well he said yes but I'm as much human
[1:07:43] as you are if he won't listen you can go
[1:07:45] get the law and the law will throw him
[1:07:46] out and what happens is we get to use to
[1:07:52] the dark there's a old song says I don't
[1:07:56] want to get adjusted to this world I
[1:07:58] don't want to get adjusted we get used
[1:08:01] to things just being that way with
[1:08:02] that's just the way humans are well I'm
[1:08:05] a human I've got a right here we might
[1:08:08] say maybe there's something that runs in
[1:08:09] our family and say well we has a right
[1:08:12] to be there because buddy was that way
[1:08:13] my daddy or my mama he was that way with
[1:08:15] them and so he's got a right to be there
[1:08:16] no he has no right because your lineage
[1:08:19] your heritage shouldn't come from them
[1:08:21] the title deed to the promises of God
[1:08:24] didn't come from her mother and father
[1:08:25] it comes from God
[1:08:30] so he said you walk right now to the
[1:08:32] course get your abstract needs showing
[1:08:33] this is my property belongs to me when
[1:08:35] he said yes but I was much human as you
[1:08:37] are if he won't listen you can go get
[1:08:39] the law and the law will throw him out
[1:08:40] when you surf warning on the devil that
[1:08:44] he's got his nasty self
[1:08:46] on God's property I love the way put
[1:08:49] that the stir DS got his nasty self
[1:08:52] camped on God's property you got to call
[1:08:56] it what it is his nasty self kept on
[1:09:01] God's property and he says if he don't
[1:09:05] want to get out just call on the
[1:09:08] authorities of heaven God's law agent
[1:09:11] the Holy Ghost he will throw him out
[1:09:14] yes sir it's your property every divine
[1:09:17] promise in the Bible belongs to every
[1:09:21] Christian don't let the devil talk to
[1:09:25] you and tell you up that's for preachers
[1:09:28] let the devil talk to you and say well
[1:09:31] that was for a profit every divine
[1:09:34] promise of God belongs to every
[1:09:37] Christian the devil come and talk to you
[1:09:39] and say well I could live like that but
[1:09:43] it just runs in my family I'm different
[1:09:45] no you can live for God you don't have
[1:09:50] to do drugs you don't have to drink just
[1:09:54] because your family drinks just because
[1:09:56] people around you do drugs just because
[1:09:59] everybody else does that don't mean you
[1:10:01] have to I've talked to young people
[1:10:02] about this before just because I serve
[1:10:05] God as a young person I I'm here to tell
[1:10:07] you today just because other young
[1:10:08] people leave doesn't mean you have to
[1:10:10] leave you can continue living forgotten
[1:10:14] you can keep yourself from the things of
[1:10:16] the world you can stay away from those
[1:10:18] things you don't have to go that way
[1:10:20] don't let the devil sit there and tell
[1:10:23] you because of who you are because you
[1:10:24] see the weaknesses in your flesh he's
[1:10:26] not looking at your flesh he's not
[1:10:28] looking at what you can do he's looking
[1:10:30] at the promise you have an abstract a
[1:10:33] right to all the promises of God every
[1:10:37] Christian has every divine promise in
[1:10:41] the Bible belongs to every Christian so
[1:10:43] brother banner says what are you scared
[1:10:44] about are you afraid to take his word
[1:10:47] for anything what's getting down where
[1:10:52] we live now in are you scared to take
[1:10:55] his word for anything for
[1:10:59] anything what did God show us that he
[1:11:02] even cared about a little fish about a
[1:11:05] mother opossum even cared about those
[1:11:10] things why because a prophet cared about
[1:11:13] it
[1:11:13] so God cared about it and there's things
[1:11:16] in your life you care about but you
[1:11:17] think was just too insignificant it's
[1:11:19] too little no every thing that you have
[1:11:22] need of are you afraid to take his word
[1:11:24] for anything don't be afraid call the
[1:11:26] thing right I am an heir to this he said
[1:11:30] oh I know I don't deserve it
[1:11:32] but I'm an heir anyhow maybe you messed
[1:11:36] up you've had problems in your life and
[1:11:38] all of us have at some point you got a
[1:11:41] right to joy again I love the way David
[1:11:44] prays he said get restore unto me the
[1:11:46] joy of thy salvation I've got a right to
[1:11:50] joy you may have been through it but you
[1:11:53] got a right to joy you got a right to
[1:11:55] peace you got a right you're not going
[1:11:57] on what you been you're going on what
[1:11:58] you are today a son or daughter of God
[1:12:01] enforcing your rights to the promises of
[1:12:04] God you don't have to remain like that
[1:12:06] you have a right no he said I know I
[1:12:09] don't deserve it but I'm an heir anyhow
[1:12:11] because I'm an heir I receive it that's
[1:12:13] it there you are
[1:12:14] because I'm an heir he said we're heir
[1:12:16] of salvation heir of the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:12:18] an heir
[1:12:19] because jesus paid the price nothing I
[1:12:21] had to do I just fell heir to it
[1:12:24] he said I'm healed because I'm an heir
[1:12:27] to it I know I'm reading a lot but some
[1:12:30] of these things I just I just put it
[1:12:31] down without the Lord you know this is
[1:12:33] something that will feed our souls
[1:12:34] something that'll do it's good he said
[1:12:36] err salvation purchase of God washing
[1:12:40] his spirit cleanse in his blood he said
[1:12:42] I'm an heir to it my diseases are gone
[1:12:43] my affliction is gone
[1:12:45] I know it's hard to keep up with me
[1:12:48] sometimes I'm reading the end of these
[1:12:49] quotes in the beginning but he says
[1:12:52] that's our story hey man that's our
[1:12:56] story blessed assurance Jesus is mine oh
[1:13:00] what a foretaste of glory divine error
[1:13:03] salvation purchase of God born of his
[1:13:05] spirit washed in his blood this is my
[1:13:08] story this is not just a preacher story
[1:13:11] it's not just people who have money
[1:13:13] not just people who knew a certain thing
[1:13:15] or have been in the message for so long
[1:13:18] but this is my story this is my song
[1:13:22] praising my Savior all the day long
[1:13:24] amen amen what is it it's I'm here I
[1:13:28] ever write to the promises of God I
[1:13:30] don't have to back up for any devil that
[1:13:32] comes by my way I don't have to let the
[1:13:35] news destroy my peace in God I don't
[1:13:38] have to let circumstances destroy Who I
[1:13:40] am in Christ I don't have to let the
[1:13:43] world come down on me and oppress me to
[1:13:45] the point where I'm sick and I'm tired
[1:13:47] and I'm weary and all the time I'm just
[1:13:49] sure you'll get down someday I'm sure
[1:13:51] you'll be sick sure you'll be weary but
[1:13:53] you have a way out of that you don't
[1:13:55] have to let that be the story of your
[1:13:57] life and the woman that wrote blessed
[1:14:01] assurance was blind she said this is my
[1:14:05] story
[1:14:06] very bad oh brother brother said didn't
[1:14:13] Satan can't stand that because he said
[1:14:16] defeated being he's nothing but a bluff
[1:14:20] Jesus paid the price hallelujah called
[1:14:24] us by His grace we're a tear he said
[1:14:27] what a perfect setup that is see he's
[1:14:30] already defeated
[1:14:31] I never defeated him Christ defeated him
[1:14:34] I'm just claiming my own god-given
[1:14:36] privileges that's all you do you just
[1:14:38] still Satan get away from here I've got
[1:14:40] an abstract deed on this building it's
[1:14:42] mine I earned it
[1:14:43] it belongs to me Oh Church if we can
[1:14:46] just recognize today that we it belongs
[1:14:49] to us people say it's too hard it's too
[1:14:51] difficult you shouldn't do that but it
[1:14:52] belongs to me everybody said there's
[1:14:55] Giants in the land everybody said
[1:14:57] there's there's problems with the land
[1:14:58] we're never going to be able to take it
[1:15:00] the Giants are 2 million they're too big
[1:15:02] and Caleb said the land is ours the land
[1:15:05] belongs to us how can we not take what
[1:15:08] belongs to us the question is not can we
[1:15:11] take it how can we not take it
[1:15:18] so you have a right and the Holy Spirit
[1:15:20] enforces the right to healing he proves
[1:15:24] the right to healing we have a right to
[1:15:30] to live and if I could put it this way
[1:15:32] you have a right to financial health you
[1:15:36] have a right to live as a child of God
[1:15:40] in the blessings of God even in your
[1:15:44] material life and we don't preach health
[1:15:47] wealth and prosperity because I know
[1:15:48] there's times where poor people that'll
[1:15:50] be poor all their lives and be just as
[1:15:52] much a Christian as you are but yet you
[1:15:55] can all things for yours and brother
[1:15:58] branham explains that him but first of
[1:16:00] all read Matthew five and five is a
[1:16:02] blessing of the meek for they shall
[1:16:04] inherit the earth that's a promise
[1:16:07] brother Brent said Abraham could lay
[1:16:09] hold on him yet poor his cattle was
[1:16:13] starving law took the best ground his
[1:16:18] water was short hot days and the
[1:16:20] herdsmen have been in trouble
[1:16:21] everything looked like going wrong for
[1:16:23] Abraham yeah you own the whole thing and
[1:16:28] Abraham was rich compared to some you
[1:16:31] know wealth is relative very much so
[1:16:34] some of the wealthiest people I know
[1:16:35] complain all the time but they go
[1:16:37] through things - the more money you have
[1:16:40] the more money you spend generally and
[1:16:43] so a lot of times we're asking God for
[1:16:45] the wrong things we're asking for wealth
[1:16:46] we ought to be asking him for peace
[1:16:49] asking him for some of the people that
[1:16:51] if I was going to Envy someone and that
[1:16:53] that's not the Christian thing to do but
[1:16:55] if I was gonna end me someone it would
[1:16:56] be someone who has their debts paid and
[1:16:58] and just lived simply before God and
[1:17:00] just able to be a real Christian and do
[1:17:03] what they need to do it and somebody
[1:17:05] like that that that's worth more it's
[1:17:08] worth more than having all of the
[1:17:10] world's things and so brother Brown said
[1:17:12] this water was short hot days the
[1:17:14] herdsmen have been in trouble everything
[1:17:15] look like gone wrong for Abraham yet he
[1:17:17] owned the whole thing he said it today
[1:17:19] the true believer he's cast out from
[1:17:21] among the people called a fanatic Holy
[1:17:23] Roller some kind of an insulting name
[1:17:25] some kind of a religious fanatic and yet
[1:17:29] is heir to the whole heavens and earth
[1:17:32] deston of the meek they shall inherit
[1:17:34] the earth
[1:17:35] oh my he said talk about push you out on
[1:17:38] a cabinet somewhere hardly enough money
[1:17:40] to pay your rent yet you own at all have
[1:17:45] to work and toil and sweat for a few
[1:17:46] dollars to make an honest living to put
[1:17:48] shoes on your children's feet then feed
[1:17:50] their little hungry mouths yet on heir
[1:17:53] to everything that's here the meek shall
[1:17:55] inherit the earth they possess it he
[1:17:58] said oh my highlight that possessor of
[1:17:59] the earth
[1:18:00] what is the believer the believer has a
[1:18:02] title abstract need that's right by
[1:18:05] Jesus Christ that he should be the
[1:18:07] possessor of the entire universe the
[1:18:09] meek shall inherit the earth
[1:18:12] Alleluia mark 16:15 we have an heir we
[1:18:18] have a right or he proves the right to
[1:18:22] mark 16 that we he says I'm going into
[1:18:26] all the world preach the gospel to every
[1:18:27] creature now that part of it is just as
[1:18:29] much a ride as the rest of it we have a
[1:18:32] right to preach the gospel to every
[1:18:35] creature he to believe it that his
[1:18:38] baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:18:39] believeth not shall be damned
[1:18:41] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:18:43] believe hey Ben this is what the Holy
[1:18:48] Ghost guarantees to you
[1:18:51] it's what the Holy Ghost guarantees to
[1:18:54] you you say well I don't see it in my
[1:18:55] life look most of the time when we don't
[1:18:58] see it in our lives either it's because
[1:19:00] we're expecting something great and it's
[1:19:03] in the details of our lives or sometimes
[1:19:06] it's because that's our sin in our life
[1:19:10] one of those two things many times keeps
[1:19:13] Christians from taking hold of the
[1:19:16] promises of God and you you can't live
[1:19:20] with your eyes just fully focused on
[1:19:23] this world and have the rights enforced
[1:19:27] in your life because while you're not
[1:19:30] looking something's gonna slip in you
[1:19:35] have to maintain your spiritual focus to
[1:19:39] take advantage of the promises of God
[1:19:43] Oh Church hear me today if there was
[1:19:46] ever an hour we should pray it should be
[1:19:48] today but there's never been an L it's
[1:19:51] harder to pray because of because of the
[1:19:53] hour that we live in if there was ever
[1:19:56] an hour we need to have church services
[1:19:57] where the power and the presence of God
[1:19:59] is so real in our midst but yet if there
[1:20:03] ever was an hour Satan fight sadist
[1:20:05] today why because he knows how we would
[1:20:11] benefit from it
[1:20:12] and he don't want to get it give it up
[1:20:15] so you gotta fight for it today more
[1:20:18] than you ever had but it's worth
[1:20:19] fighting for coming together to believe
[1:20:25] and in church and to bring our licks of
[1:20:28] fire together to come in one Accord in
[1:20:29] one place is worth fighting for it's
[1:20:33] worth the struggle to have a church
[1:20:36] that's on fire and it is hard but it's
[1:20:39] worth the struggle to have a place where
[1:20:42] people can come and sit in the in the
[1:20:44] blessings of the presence of God it's
[1:20:45] hard but it's worth the fight
[1:20:48] he said these signs shall follow them
[1:20:51] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:20:52] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:20:54] tongues they shall take up serpents if
[1:20:56] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[1:20:57] hurt them they shall the hands on the
[1:21:00] sick and they shall recover so the
[1:21:06] abstract says Easter still 1965 but the
[1:21:14] rent says when we believe on Jesus
[1:21:17] Christ for our Savior and repent and are
[1:21:19] baptized and come up to believe him God
[1:21:22] recognizes our repentance and our faith
[1:21:25] towards him and sends down the abstract
[1:21:29] and the abstract is the assurance it's
[1:21:33] the guarantee that everything excuse me
[1:21:38] that was ever held against you you
[1:21:41] thoroughly repented oh my that's where
[1:21:46] it stops for a lot of people you don't
[1:21:50] hear that preached anymore but you have
[1:21:53] to thoroughly repent
[1:21:55] you've got to be willing to surrender
[1:21:57] yourself to God and there's a lot of
[1:21:58] people who don't go out and do some
[1:22:00] great sin who've never really committed
[1:22:02] and surrendered themselves to God
[1:22:04] they've not surrendered their work to
[1:22:06] God have not surrendered their home life
[1:22:09] to God and so there's a whole lot of
[1:22:13] people that are just not 100% surrender
[1:22:15] and that surrender is a constant thing
[1:22:17] because Paul says I keep under my body
[1:22:20] bring it under subjection lest having
[1:22:22] preached to others i myself should be
[1:22:24] disapproved to cast away because it's a
[1:22:29] long - it's a fight I surrenders every
[1:22:31] day Paul says I die daily
[1:22:33] every day I surrender every day I've got
[1:22:35] to give up every day I've got to
[1:22:37] maintain and see when we enforce our
[1:22:39] rights to the abstract we're enforcing
[1:22:41] his rights the rights that the original
[1:22:44] owner had and by doing that we give up
[1:22:47] our rights as human beings there was a
[1:22:52] document of the French Revolution there
[1:22:53] was modeled somewhat after the
[1:22:55] Declaration of Independence it was
[1:22:56] called the rights of man the rights of
[1:23:00] man and they had certain rights that men
[1:23:01] would have there in that revolution but
[1:23:04] what they found out is that man can't
[1:23:06] even force his own enforce his own
[1:23:08] rights and in order to be a Christian
[1:23:11] you've got to give up every one of those
[1:23:13] rights I hope you hear me now yes as a
[1:23:18] as a human being I have rights as an
[1:23:20] American citizen but when it comes to
[1:23:22] the gospel
[1:23:22] none of those rights get in the way of
[1:23:24] me serving God if they do they have to
[1:23:28] be laid down I heard brother Darrell
[1:23:33] Ward preach a message one time called
[1:23:34] the declaration of dependence
[1:23:37] declaration of dependence that's what it
[1:23:41] is we depend on him hey Ben he said
[1:23:47] everything was thoroughly repented and
[1:23:49] the property is bought and you hold the
[1:23:52] abstract for the assurance let somebody
[1:23:58] try to put you off the land say he
[1:24:00] belongs you with the abstract in your
[1:24:03] hand let him try to do it there ain't a
[1:24:06] law in the land can do it because you
[1:24:08] hold
[1:24:08] the abstract and there's no devil no
[1:24:11] church or any theology that can overstep
[1:24:14] the boundaries of God's proof and
[1:24:16] abstract that the baptism of the holy
[1:24:18] ghost has recognized us in Jesus Christ
[1:24:21] we're just as sure to raise as he raised
[1:24:24] because potentially we have already
[1:24:27] raised in him he says and what does it
[1:24:30] do to our mortal bodies it turns our
[1:24:31] opinion changes our notions it sets our
[1:24:36] affections on things which are above do
[1:24:40] you remember what it was like when you
[1:24:42] become a Christian and this is harder as
[1:24:45] I said some of us get accomplished when
[1:24:46] we raised in the message because we
[1:24:48] never drank we never smoked we never
[1:24:49] gambled but something had to change
[1:24:53] we still had to be changed it turns our
[1:24:57] opinion changes our notions sets our
[1:25:02] affections on things which are above and
[1:25:04] the smoking drinking gambling the things
[1:25:08] that you used to do is dead it's beneath
[1:25:10] you and you are quickened and this
[1:25:13] quickening power brings your body into a
[1:25:16] raptured condition oh I hope you hear me
[1:25:20] that's well I don't believe there's
[1:25:22] anything that stands between us and the
[1:25:23] rapture if you're a born again child of
[1:25:25] God with the abstract there's no eighth
[1:25:27] messenger that's got to come there's no
[1:25:29] there's no person that stands we have to
[1:25:31] believe this doctrine or go here to
[1:25:33] church or do this know you're in a
[1:25:34] raptured condition already because she
[1:25:38] received the abstract in this hour with
[1:25:40] the with the with the word being
[1:25:41] revealed in the book being opened when
[1:25:43] you received the token today it puts you
[1:25:46] into a message of the hour that's ready
[1:25:48] for the skies so you he said he said
[1:25:56] this quickening power brings your body
[1:25:57] into a raptured condition already huh
[1:26:02] already he said notice him I my nose is
[1:26:07] running I'm not sick I've got allergies
[1:26:09] and when I get to preaching they think
[1:26:11] it comes I starts manifesting itself and
[1:26:14] I don't know why that is I'm sorry
[1:26:18] what does it do he said it turns our
[1:26:22] opinions that changed our notions he
[1:26:23] already read that he said trends your
[1:26:25] body to a rapture condition already said
[1:26:27] notice the Pentecostal people up there
[1:26:29] when they got quickened by the Holy
[1:26:30] Spirit he said listen to me when those
[1:26:33] Pentecostal group up there on the day of
[1:26:34] Pentecost received their abstract need
[1:26:37] from God it glorified their souls they
[1:26:42] screamed they saw tongues of fire
[1:26:45] separated upon each of them and it's so
[1:26:47] quick in their body till they couldn't
[1:26:49] even speak in an earthly language
[1:26:50] anymore it quickened their body to a
[1:26:54] heavenly language the place they're
[1:26:57] going to quickening power of God shook
[1:27:00] their mortal body so till their entire
[1:27:03] mortal language was transfigured
[1:27:05] transformed into an immortal language
[1:27:07] said what a quickening power he said
[1:27:10] what's something that belongs oh my said
[1:27:15] it changed their language into a
[1:27:16] language that belonged oh my don't you
[1:27:20] realize it did that it quickened your
[1:27:21] more body it made you into somebody that
[1:27:23] belonged in heaven hey you didn't belong
[1:27:28] in heaven but he changed your soul quick
[1:27:30] in that seat until you were somebody to
[1:27:32] belong there I'm a citizen of heaven I
[1:27:35] don't belong here let them riot let them
[1:27:38] do whatever they want to do I don't
[1:27:40] belong here I belong in heaven oh I
[1:27:49] believe in being a citizen of this
[1:27:51] country I believe in that I I believe in
[1:27:54] the taking advantage of my rights as a
[1:27:55] citizen but but not when it crosses my
[1:27:58] rights to heaven I'm a citizen of heaven
[1:28:02] first I know brother brother Robert
[1:28:05] Wilson has four four citizenships he
[1:28:09] worked for IBM and and so it's helped
[1:28:11] him in missionary work but he he's a
[1:28:12] citizen of Canada and the UK and Ghana
[1:28:14] and the US and those for citizenship
[1:28:18] gives him rights beyond what other
[1:28:20] people would have but I noticed when he
[1:28:22] goes overseas forgive me brother Robert
[1:28:24] if you listen to this but it'll use his
[1:28:26] his American passport
[1:28:30] it'll go use his American passport when
[1:28:32] he can because that's what gives him the
[1:28:35] most rights when you cross through those
[1:28:38] little those little places and if you've
[1:28:40] traveled you know that he cross to those
[1:28:41] little places there's more respect there
[1:28:44] there's something about holding that
[1:28:45] American abstract or that American I'm
[1:28:49] sorry that that American identification
[1:28:51] American passport you got an American
[1:28:55] passport that's what he shows oh my I've
[1:28:57] got a passport for heaven that's what I
[1:29:00] want to show what I want to show I got a
[1:29:02] passport to another land oh yes I'm a
[1:29:05] citizen of America yes I belong in the
[1:29:07] city and in the community but I got a
[1:29:09] passport to heaven that's what I want to
[1:29:13] work under what a walk under wanna treat
[1:29:15] others under that passport oh I want to
[1:29:17] act like Ana if I'm gonna be an America
[1:29:20] need to act like an American be an
[1:29:21] American if I'm gonna be a Christian I
[1:29:23] need to act like a Christian being a
[1:29:24] Christian being an ambassador because I
[1:29:27] don't belong here and we're a small
[1:29:30] community there's not very many of us
[1:29:34] don't belong here not very many hold
[1:29:37] that passport so we have to be a good
[1:29:39] representation well the random he said
[1:29:48] something that belongs if the spirit
[1:29:50] that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:29:51] dwells in your mortal bodies it shall
[1:29:54] also quicken your mortal bodies we are
[1:29:56] quick and then by the power of the
[1:29:58] Living God
[1:29:59] tongues quick into a new heavenly
[1:30:01] language to speak to them a rap string
[1:30:04] up raising up into a different
[1:30:06] atmosphere than what they never lived in
[1:30:10] hey man also with the new quickening
[1:30:13] life to them that coming in at quick in
[1:30:15] their language they spoke in new tongues
[1:30:17] he said now watch them it was also
[1:30:20] designed to give them after this
[1:30:23] abstract it was designed to give them
[1:30:26] every promise that was on the ground
[1:30:30] every promise on the grounds of God's
[1:30:33] Word that was promised in the Bible that
[1:30:35] quickening power was give to them to
[1:30:37] quicken that promise to them he said
[1:30:40] therefore they laid hands on the sick
[1:30:42] they would feel this
[1:30:43] in new tongues they've done great signs
[1:30:45] and wonders because that was in God's
[1:30:47] promise when Jesus died to redeem that
[1:30:50] back to them the grounds have long the
[1:30:52] sons of God he demonstrated what God was
[1:30:54] he said how dare we socialize that put
[1:30:57] it into an organization we have no
[1:30:59] rights to do that he said but it's the
[1:31:02] Holy Spirit today hunting out honest
[1:31:05] hearts that will believe that message
[1:31:08] everything in the Bible that was
[1:31:10] promised it's to that believer
[1:31:13] hey man and when you accepted in his
[1:31:15] fullness and God knows that you'll do it
[1:31:18] he gives you the abstract to that and
[1:31:20] that every promise that's made in is in
[1:31:23] your possession and the Holy Spirit is
[1:31:25] there to quicken that to you I'm closing
[1:31:31] with this do you believe it today every
[1:31:45] Christian is it right to every promise
[1:31:49] of God hear me today if you haven't
[1:31:52] heard anything that I've said so far
[1:31:55] hear this every Christian also has a
[1:32:00] responsibility to drive the devil off of
[1:32:06] his property it's not just a right it's
[1:32:12] a responsibility What did he say the
[1:32:15] land is mine forever this belongs to God
[1:32:21] and when Satan comes into my home and
[1:32:24] squashed down and tries to make himself
[1:32:26] present in my life tries to make him my
[1:32:28] himself my everyday companion I have a
[1:32:32] right and I also have a responsibility
[1:32:35] to get rid of it
[1:32:39] and it's ultimately his we are in him
[1:32:43] and that he bought the land that he paid
[1:32:46] for the land that he redeemed back to us
[1:32:49] belongs to us because of him and we have
[1:32:54] a responsibility you see the longer
[1:32:58] wait to kick the devil off of your
[1:32:59] property the harder it will be to do it
[1:33:04] he just makes himself comfortable he
[1:33:07] builds himself a little home there in
[1:33:09] the living room just got all his snacks
[1:33:13] and his candy the longer you wait the
[1:33:16] more junk you're gonna have to drag out
[1:33:18] and the more likely it will be that
[1:33:21] you'll miss something
[1:33:22] and you have to deal with it later you
[1:33:25] ever had a house guess it was real messy
[1:33:27] I have a sister bless her heart Becky I
[1:33:32] love my sister but she leaves something
[1:33:34] every time she comes and stays we have
[1:33:37] something of Becky's every time and so
[1:33:40] after she leaves my wife just goes and
[1:33:42] looks because she knows she's going to
[1:33:45] find something of Becky's
[1:33:47] every time that's the way the devil is
[1:33:50] he comes which we finally get around to
[1:33:53] getting rid of him and he's left stuff
[1:33:57] we just can't seem to have the joy that
[1:34:00] we did we don't understand it can't seem
[1:34:04] to have the peace that was once
[1:34:05] president our lives we don't seem to
[1:34:07] understand it it's because the devil
[1:34:08] left something there
[1:34:10] let some Cheetos behind the couch he
[1:34:17] left some stuff been below to you you
[1:34:20] don't want that nasty stuff Oh God
[1:34:25] the longer you wait the harder it will
[1:34:28] be to do it every day he becomes
[1:34:31] stronger every year he becomes stronger
[1:34:33] it's still possible but every day you
[1:34:35] wait every time we hear the word and
[1:34:38] refuse to believe it he gets bolder he
[1:34:44] does every time we give him he gets
[1:34:48] bolder and that's why Jesus even taught
[1:34:54] them to take a radical steps and so he's
[1:34:56] setting an extreme example he says if
[1:34:58] your eye offends you pluck it out the
[1:35:02] internet offends you get rid of it you
[1:35:05] can't deal with the phone get rid of it
[1:35:08] if your eye offends you pluck it out
[1:35:12] if you've got a friend that's dragging
[1:35:14] you down huh let go of them sometimes
[1:35:20] you have to take drastic steps because
[1:35:23] the longer you wait the harder it is to
[1:35:25] bring your life into line with the word
[1:35:30] second Peter 2:19 speaks of those who
[1:35:35] would would be what would actually
[1:35:39] promise people things did not deliver
[1:35:41] which we see so many today tell
[1:35:43] evangelist and the light promising
[1:35:45] Liberty to the people but it says well
[1:35:48] they promise them Liberty they
[1:35:49] themselves with the servants of
[1:35:50] corruption four of whom a man is
[1:35:53] overcome of the same as he brought in
[1:35:55] bondage so he's saying when an enemy
[1:35:59] comes and in that day slaves were a hot
[1:36:01] commodity that's how they made their
[1:36:03] money they would start a war just to go
[1:36:05] get slaves and so of whom a man is
[1:36:08] overcome if he wins the battle against
[1:36:10] you
[1:36:11] he didn't put you in bondage he doesn't
[1:36:13] just leave you and come back later but
[1:36:16] he puts you in bondage you got to break
[1:36:17] out of that he said well a Booma man has
[1:36:21] overcome of the same as he brought in
[1:36:22] bondage for if after they have escaped
[1:36:25] the pollutions of the world through the
[1:36:26] knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:36:27] Christ they are again entangled therein
[1:36:30] and overcome the latter end is worse
[1:36:32] with them than the beginning it had been
[1:36:35] better for them not to have known the
[1:36:37] way of righteousness then after they
[1:36:38] have known it to turn from the holy
[1:36:40] commandment delivered unto them I know
[1:36:46] we changed drastically but I just really
[1:36:49] feel like that we need to hear it I need
[1:36:52] to hear it this is part of enforcing our
[1:36:57] rights is taking our responsibilities
[1:37:02] when God brother Brent says sends the
[1:37:04] Holy Ghost and knocks at a man don't
[1:37:05] man's door and he deliberately turns it
[1:37:09] down sometime he's going to turn it down
[1:37:11] for his last time he said well God never
[1:37:16] knocked at my door did you realize that
[1:37:18] what you were doing was wrong when you
[1:37:19] did it was God knocking at your door
[1:37:23] first time you ever put your
[1:37:25] hand in the cookie jar and you pulled it
[1:37:28] back out and you knew you weren't
[1:37:30] supposed to be in it you felt bad God
[1:37:33] what's knocking at your door
[1:37:37] he keeps knocking he Bears long with us
[1:37:42] he said but sometime he's going to turn
[1:37:44] it for his last time he said and then
[1:37:47] you won't be a privileged character
[1:37:51] yours how privileged we are his message
[1:37:54] believers how privileged we are to be
[1:37:57] able to hear a message of deliverance
[1:38:00] with so many abound is so many are
[1:38:05] unable to overcome we have the ability
[1:38:08] to overcome we have the ability we have
[1:38:11] the understanding we have these things
[1:38:13] that we mean realize the importance of
[1:38:15] that the privilege that that is but he
[1:38:19] said you won't be a privileged character
[1:38:20] if you turn it down for the last time
[1:38:22] you can sit in a church and listen to
[1:38:25] the gospel and agree with the gospel you
[1:38:28] might do this as much as say I know it's
[1:38:29] right but never put a finger on it to
[1:38:32] help it yourself see said you just
[1:38:35] listen to it because you say I believe
[1:38:37] it's right that's just sympathizing with
[1:38:39] it I could say I believe that's the
[1:38:41] $10,000 I don't mean I got it I could
[1:38:44] say that's good cold water but refuse to
[1:38:46] drink it oh god I wonder you coming as
[1:38:52] I've said before if you've come if you
[1:38:54] come I don't want to see anybody quit
[1:38:55] coming to church every person on that
[1:38:58] that's alive on the face of this earth
[1:38:59] has a right to come to the house of God
[1:39:01] and I want to become the house of God
[1:39:04] but remember if you just let that water
[1:39:07] pour over you constantly and you never
[1:39:09] get born again you just become more
[1:39:11] rotten you just become more rotten if
[1:39:17] you say that's good cold water but you
[1:39:19] never drink of it you just become more
[1:39:21] thirsty but you become dehydrated until
[1:39:25] you don't know that you're thirsty
[1:39:28] he said in this is eternal life it
[1:39:32] refused to do it
[1:39:33] one day you'll cross the line between
[1:39:35] judgment and mercy and you won't have
[1:39:38] the privilege to come and where
[1:39:39] save it if there's something infringing
[1:39:45] on your rights as a Christian get rid of
[1:39:47] it take it off and I'm speaking
[1:39:50] especially to us now we think of
[1:39:52] physical healing when we think of this
[1:39:54] but so many other things that the devil
[1:39:55] can come in and make us wear we're not
[1:39:58] living to our potential as children of
[1:40:00] God get rid of it you get a little idea
[1:40:06] or a little thought people are against
[1:40:08] you us how quickly the devil can make
[1:40:10] that a complex and then turn it into
[1:40:12] insanity in your life where are you
[1:40:16] actually going acting rationally because
[1:40:18] you get a root of bitterness you won't
[1:40:22] have the privilege one day to come and
[1:40:24] receive healing from that the other part
[1:40:29] of the year of Jubilee is that if the
[1:40:30] slave refused to go free and reclaim his
[1:40:33] rights to Liberty the day of Jubilee he
[1:40:35] could never be free again don't you want
[1:40:40] to be free I know it's heavy I don't
[1:40:43] mean for it to be that way but listen we
[1:40:45] have responsibilities as Christians just
[1:40:48] rights not just privileges but
[1:40:50] responsibilities we've got to step up
[1:40:54] say Lord if there's something that you
[1:40:56] know to do is wrong and I don't believe
[1:40:57] that I have to go down a list that some
[1:40:59] do it and say this is wrong and this is
[1:41:01] wrong this is wrong you know but if
[1:41:04] there's something you know is wrong
[1:41:05] don't excuse it kick it off do what it
[1:41:09] takes to get rid of it it's worth it
[1:41:11] it's worth it it's about our heads
[1:41:13] together
[1:41:16] don't let sin set in your life it's not
[1:41:19] worth it's not worth it to let it sit
[1:41:22] there it's worth it to get rid of it if
[1:41:28] there's something in your life that's
[1:41:30] not right and just talk to him I'm not
[1:41:33] saying you're not a Christian many times
[1:41:35] I find myself repenting because we all
[1:41:40] everyday miss the mark and thank God for
[1:41:43] the atonement for the blood of Christ
[1:41:45] and as has been said so many times
[1:41:48] eloquently over this pulpit and others
[1:41:49] that it's not up to our works it's a
[1:41:53] to Christ but we need to stay covered by
[1:41:55] the blood we have a responsibility
[1:41:57] you're not going to be lost if you're a
[1:41:58] Christian today you will not be lost but
[1:42:01] you have a responsibility to get rid of
[1:42:02] the devil
[1:42:03] to stand up and be a real Christian to
[1:42:07] be a child of God could we sing that I
[1:42:10] fill the pole in G I fill the pole if
[1:42:13] you know them could we just talk to the
[1:42:17] Lord for a moment and say Lord I'm I
[1:42:19] just want to be the kind of Christian
[1:42:22] that you want me to be it helped me to
[1:42:24] enforce my rights or maybe it's healing
[1:42:26] maybe it's something else you just let
[1:42:30] the devil beat you up over and over
[1:42:32] again on that don't let him do that
[1:42:35] the devil try to tell you're not
[1:42:37] forgiven the devil tried to tell you
[1:42:39] you're not up you can't be a Christian
[1:42:41] after your life being the way that it
[1:42:43] was or maybe something happened to you
[1:42:45] and you were a child and things have
[1:42:46] just been odd for you ever since and you
[1:42:49] think well I can never be normal don't
[1:42:50] buy that don't accept that you let God
[1:42:55] move in your life let God take care of
[1:42:58] those things he can do it he can do
[1:43:00] miracles in your life so you've got to
[1:43:03] be willing to let him and when a father
[1:43:05] is I come to this somber part of the
[1:43:07] service and knowing or that I'm speaking
[1:43:09] mostly to Christians today it may seem
[1:43:12] strange Lord but father I pray you'd
[1:43:15] cleanse us of all of our sins so many
[1:43:19] times Lord I myself will pray that way
[1:43:21] Lord forgive me of my sins not that I
[1:43:25] believe that you've not forgiven me not
[1:43:27] that I don't recognize Who I am and that
[1:43:29] I'm justified but that I've been filled
[1:43:32] with the Holy Spirit I've been sealed
[1:43:34] but yet I know that there's things that
[1:43:38] I do that's not pleasing to you and so
[1:43:40] lord I ask you to forgive me may we do
[1:43:42] that today so body give us where we
[1:43:45] failed you preaching it's not always
[1:43:49] just shouting and running sometimes it's
[1:43:52] hard Oh God would you just help us to
[1:43:55] recognize Lord that you want what's best
[1:43:58] for us
[1:44:00] whatever it is in our life that you
[1:44:03] don't want us to live underprivileged
[1:44:05] you don't want us to live with
[1:44:07] temptation all the time and trouble and
[1:44:10] struggle that we give in to Lord you
[1:44:13] want us to overcome we're so grateful we
[1:44:16] could be an overcomer Lord I pray for
[1:44:20] each and every person sitting in the
[1:44:21] sound of my voice today or watching Lord
[1:44:24] this morning I pray that you just move
[1:44:26] in our lives and we've gotten a little
[1:44:28] free with the truth and we haven't
[1:44:30] always spoken like we should the truth
[1:44:32] Oh God
[1:44:34] would you help us today would you help
[1:44:36] us to always tell the truth
[1:44:38] Lord if there's something that maybe in
[1:44:41] the business feel if something got a
[1:44:42] little shady Oh God
[1:44:43] help us Lord we want to be right if
[1:44:46] there's something that we've just kept
[1:44:49] in but it's hard to the world may not
[1:44:51] see it but you see it helped us sort to
[1:44:54] be completely clean order when we come
[1:44:57] to your house we can worship you without
[1:45:00] any with an understanding of what your
[1:45:03] blood did for us without any
[1:45:04] condemnation father I pray that you just
[1:45:08] move in our midst and wipe out
[1:45:10] everything that's unlike you I pray Lord
[1:45:13] that your bleach would just pour down in
[1:45:16] every heart just eliminate everything
[1:45:18] that's unlike you and send it back on
[1:45:20] the ones that did it in the first place
[1:45:23] I pray your granite father or Jesus weep
[1:45:28] lord I don't speak just of this church
[1:45:31] but these are good people but art I
[1:45:34] speak of us as a whole as the people in
[1:45:37] the message to the Lord we need revival
[1:45:39] we need you to speak again in our
[1:45:42] churches we need you to speak in our
[1:45:44] homes Lord we need you hard
[1:45:48] we can't make it without you we know
[1:45:52] there won't be a world sweeping revival
[1:45:54] again but Oh God would you just come
[1:45:56] down in this place this morning just
[1:45:59] speak to us once again or cleanse out
[1:46:02] everything that's unlike you and may
[1:46:05] your presence be so real among us and
[1:46:08] when we leave this place we couldn't say
[1:46:09] anything or do anything that would be
[1:46:11] outside your will I pray your granite
[1:46:13] Lord God maybe they're so close to the
[1:46:16] cross that others can see yes he's a man
[1:46:19] yes he's a human yes he made mistakes he
[1:46:21] makes mistakes but that man is a
