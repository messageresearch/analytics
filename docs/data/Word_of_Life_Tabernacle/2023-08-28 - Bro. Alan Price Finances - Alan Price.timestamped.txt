[0:00] to make it work
[0:01] so at any time this is going to be
[0:02] pretty informal so at any time stop and
[0:05] ask me questions if you want to except
[0:07] for my mother
[0:09] but anybody else can ask me questions
[0:13] all right so what uh what will title
[0:16] this
[0:17] um
[0:18] is good and Faithful Servants so we are
[0:21] called to be faithful in a lot of things
[0:24] you know as husbands we've got to take
[0:26] care of our family both in spiritual
[0:30] aspect
[0:31] Health aspect and then financially as
[0:34] well so
[0:36] we're going to go over this one's kind
[0:37] of going to be lay the groundwork for
[0:39] what we're going to talk about the
[0:40] second class will actually be where we
[0:43] go over the budget so you will have
[0:45] homework when you leave here today so I
[0:47] do apologize for that but it's fun and
[0:50] if you need me to ever do anything for
[0:51] you
[0:53] um
[0:53] as far as helping you with your budget
[0:55] let me know and I'll do that for you so
[0:57] this is one of my favorite quotes it
[0:59] says the starting point of all
[1:00] achievement is desire keep this
[1:02] constantly in mind it says a weak desire
[1:04] brings weak results so just as a small
[1:07] fire makes a small amount of heat so if
[1:10] you're going to do something if you ask
[1:12] my wife I'm An All or Nothing guy if I'm
[1:14] dieting
[1:15] I want to throw out all the food in the
[1:17] house and just have healthy food so
[1:19] it's kind of hard to do especially if
[1:21] you're a married couple getting on board
[1:24] with a budgeting takes a very very long
[1:26] time
[1:27] so actually just to give you a little
[1:28] background we will talk a little bit
[1:30] about Dave Ramsey and his Total Money
[1:33] Makeover that that whole thing that he
[1:35] does
[1:36] I don't agree with with everything that
[1:38] Dave Ramsey says but a lot of it is good
[1:41] good foundational stuff for a budget
[1:44] me and Jen had been married maybe two
[1:47] two and a half years and we're going on
[1:48] this we're going on a cruise and and we
[1:51] stopped at Jeremy and Rebecca's house
[1:52] when they lived in Magnolia and and
[1:54] Jeremy's an All or Nothing guy too he's
[1:57] you know if he's in he's in and if he's
[1:59] out he's out but he had this book laying
[2:01] there
[2:02] and he kind of we got there late at
[2:04] night and we set up to like one or two
[2:05] in the morning talking about The Total
[2:07] Money Makeover in the budget and and so
[2:09] he uh so I told you I was like let's go
[2:12] on the cruise have fun first then come
[2:14] back in budget so that's what we did
[2:16] we went
[2:18] wasted and squandered and had just a
[2:21] wonderful time and then we come back and
[2:22] then we got on the budget so that was
[2:24] about our third year of marriage
[2:26] and I'll kind of once we get in the
[2:27] slides I'll kind of go over what all
[2:29] stuff we did that is helpful not helpful
[2:32] and going from there but we'll start
[2:34] with a scripture here Matthew 25 it says
[2:36] for the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man
[2:38] traveling into a far country who called
[2:40] his own servants and delivered unto them
[2:43] his good so if you remember in Matthew
[2:45] 25 the first Parable that he gives is
[2:47] the the wise and foolish virgins so this
[2:50] is the parable immediately after that
[2:52] he said and unto one he gave five
[2:54] talents to another he gave two and to
[2:56] another he gave one and he said to every
[2:58] man according to his several ability and
[3:01] straightway took his journey
[3:03] so then the gentleman that received the
[3:05] five talents went and traded with the
[3:07] same and made him another five talents
[3:10] so now he had 10 total and likewise he
[3:12] that received two also gained another
[3:14] two so he went from two to four but he
[3:16] received one digged in the earth and hid
[3:19] his Lord's money
[3:21] so he took the one that he was given and
[3:23] did nothing with it right and so after a
[3:25] long time the lord of the servants come
[3:27] and reckon with them and he that
[3:29] received the five talents came and
[3:30] brought forth another five saying Lord
[3:32] thou delivered unto me five talents
[3:34] behold I have gained beside them five
[3:36] talents more his lord said to him well
[3:38] done thou good and faithful servant thou
[3:41] has been Faithful over the few things I
[3:43] will make the ruler over many things
[3:44] enter thou unto the joy of the Lord
[3:47] and he that received the two the same he
[3:49] came and delivered unto him for I gained
[3:51] another two talents besides them as the
[3:53] Lord said unto him well done good and
[3:55] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[3:56] over the few things I will make thee
[3:58] rule over many things enter thou unto
[4:01] the joy of the Lord and so we see that
[4:03] what God had given or excuse me what
[4:06] this what this master had given them
[4:08] they took it and multiplied it
[4:09] and they multiplied it for their
[4:11] Master's calls so and then he which
[4:13] received the one Talent came to came and
[4:15] said Lord I knew thou art a hard man
[4:16] reaping where thou has not sown and
[4:18] Gathering where thou Hast not strawed so
[4:21] he knew that that his master was was was
[4:24] really good at making money where he
[4:27] didn't have to actually do any work what
[4:28] we would call passive income he said I
[4:31] was afraid and wouldn't hid that talent
[4:32] in the earth Lo thou Hast
[4:34] is thine and he given back the one
[4:36] Talent and his Lord answered and said
[4:38] unto him thou Wicked and slothful
[4:39] servant thou knew us that I reap where I
[4:41] sow not and gather where I am not
[4:43] strawed now ought us therefore to have
[4:45] put the money in the exchangers and then
[4:47] of my coming should have received my own
[4:48] usury or with usury take down the talent
[4:52] from him and give it unto him which the
[4:53] half the ten Talent now and brother Ben
[4:56] wanted me to lay out a kind of a
[4:58] scriptural basis for the for the
[4:59] budgeting and financing I do believe it
[5:01] is scriptural because everything that we
[5:03] deal with we're not we're not Building
[5:05] Wealth for greed for the love of money
[5:07] but the overall goal is you know for
[5:10] time with family you know right now I
[5:12] don't own my own time if I want to have
[5:14] a paycheck I have to go to work
[5:16] unfortunately they don't just pay me to
[5:18] sit at home
[5:19] I've asked for that job but they don't
[5:20] have one of those yet
[5:22] so we see that we're giving our time for
[5:24] our money to take care of our family so
[5:25] we want to get to a point where we don't
[5:27] have to do that
[5:28] now brother Brandon
[5:31] he says in investments in 1962 he says a
[5:34] fellow that's got money wants to put it
[5:35] to good investment of course he said a
[5:38] man that has let's say as much as ten
[5:39] thousand dollars would like to put it in
[5:41] some investment he said don't keep it in
[5:42] your pocket because you know thieves
[5:43] will steal it and so you don't want to
[5:45] do that he said if you're a good sound
[5:47] businessman you want to put in something
[5:49] that'll draw dividends you want to put
[5:51] it into something for user he says you
[5:53] know about the talents in the Bible he
[5:55] said so you must put it to some use
[5:57] that'll draw dividends out of it some
[5:59] good Sound business he said and then
[6:01] doing this you don't want to put into
[6:03] something that's not sound he said no
[6:05] man would want to do that he said a good
[6:07] smart businessman wouldn't think of such
[6:08] a thing you men wouldn't he said put it
[6:11] into something that one of these get
[6:13] rich overnight schemes and said don't
[6:15] know where it come from he said you
[6:16] better be careful about that you lose
[6:17] all you got he said it's a gamble he
[6:20] said and gambling is not good Sound
[6:23] business so there's my scripture my
[6:26] quote for the for the financial seminar
[6:28] for brother Ben so but we're called to
[6:30] be good stew words now you have to find
[6:33] what your financial purpose is in life
[6:36] just as you have to find out is what
[6:39] your spiritual calling is you know if
[6:40] you're a minister you you're there to
[6:42] preach if you're a songly you're there
[6:43] to sing if you're a deacon whatever it
[6:45] may be if you're a prayer Warrior you've
[6:47] got to find what your purpose is
[6:51] so back to the story of the talents now
[6:54] Matthew 25 and 21 is is Lord said to him
[6:57] well done now good and faithful servant
[6:59] thou has been Faithful over the few
[7:01] things I will make the ruler over many
[7:03] enter thou unto the joy of the Lord so
[7:06] the the moral of that story to me is if
[7:09] you can't manage ten dollars you won't
[7:11] be able to manage ten thousand right
[7:14] that's the moral of the story and if you
[7:15] look at if you look at any financial
[7:17] studies the key is spend less than you
[7:20] make right if you spend more than you
[7:22] make you're going to go into the red
[7:23] that's just that's just the fact of the
[7:25] matter and and if you spend all you have
[7:27] you'll have none left over to invest or
[7:29] save for emergency now no one is born
[7:32] with the magical ability to manage money
[7:35] we've all got to be taught that now it's
[7:39] up to you as to what you're going to do
[7:41] with your life and your why you know why
[7:43] do you want to be financially stable why
[7:47] do you want to have money and again if
[7:49] you're driven by greed you may get a lot
[7:51] of money but you're still not going to
[7:52] be wealthy with your time and and all of
[7:54] that with your family
[7:56] so notice in Matthew 25 one thing I
[7:59] wanted you to notice is notice Who the
[8:01] Master gave more to he gave more to
[8:04] those that he knew would manage it
[8:05] correctly right he gave five talents to
[8:09] the one and they made him five he gave
[8:10] two to the other and it made him two he
[8:12] gave the least to the one that he knew
[8:15] would be more likely to not make him
[8:17] money
[8:18] so if you so this is something you
[8:20] always need to remember a man told me
[8:21] this a long time ago and he says if you
[8:23] can't manage ten dollars you can't
[8:24] manage ten thousand and that equates to
[8:27] throughout your whole entire life
[8:29] and money management is to be used with
[8:31] consistency you can say you start on a
[8:34] budget you follow that plan for six
[8:37] months and then you get everything in
[8:38] good shape and then you go back to your
[8:40] old habits then it's just going to be
[8:41] the same way you know you're just going
[8:42] to keep going through that cycle so it
[8:45] is a lifestyle change and it's not it's
[8:47] not always fun
[8:50] um I'm very fortunate because my wife
[8:52] who's not here she's watching kids is
[8:54] about as tight as me
[8:56] so we kind of get along in that aspect
[8:59] we didn't always At first she would be
[9:02] want to do it and then I wouldn't and I
[9:05] would want to do it and she wouldn't so
[9:06] there's just different things in life
[9:08] that you have to if you're a married
[9:10] couple I want to go ahead and tell you
[9:11] this just real quick if you're a married
[9:13] couple and your spouse does not agree
[9:14] and y'all sit down and agree to do this
[9:16] it will not work
[9:17] once the house divided against itself
[9:19] will not stand right so if you're going
[9:22] to do it you need to definitely pray get
[9:24] with your spouse you don't need to pray
[9:26] and discuss it you know as the man the
[9:28] the head of the household you know you
[9:30] want to be able to take care of your
[9:31] family you want to lead and guide them
[9:34] throughout throughout all their life
[9:38] um and so even setting up your children
[9:40] to do this because as we know marriage
[9:42] is difficult enough on its own right no
[9:45] husbands okay I'm raising my hand while
[9:47] it's perfect
[9:49] but anyways marriage is is Joel probably
[9:51] was the only one brother Ben's just
[9:53] waving his hands back and forth
[9:55] but marriage is tough enough without the
[9:57] burden of financial stress right
[10:00] so if you can alleviate one of those
[10:02] things it does make life a whole lot
[10:04] less stressful so you know me and Jen
[10:08] we've done the Dave Ramsey thing and I
[10:09] think we're on baby step six it's what
[10:11] it is you know there's seven steps and
[10:13] so we're on baby step six and and I will
[10:15] tell you this you know when you get that
[10:17] emergency fund built up to three to six
[10:19] months it's almost like you kind of have
[10:21] a weight lifted because even if your
[10:22] employer finds you even if you're a
[10:24] horrible worker you've three to six
[10:26] months you should be able to find
[10:27] another job right I mean you should be
[10:28] able to find find something else so I
[10:31] will tell you that it does take a lot of
[10:33] stress away that you just you didn't
[10:34] really realize was there but you're like
[10:36] well I've got to do this and it can even
[10:38] get you out of an unhappy job is which
[10:41] um one of the things that it did help me
[10:43] was when I left the funeral home going
[10:45] into banking it it allowed me to switch
[10:47] because I knew that I had that money in
[10:49] reserve in case I had to do anything
[10:50] else so it really does help now what I
[10:53] want to talk to you about just for a
[10:54] second is
[10:55] it's not what you make it's what you
[10:57] keep so somebody making 200 000 a year
[11:01] spending two hundred thousand dollars a
[11:03] year guess what they got at the end of
[11:04] the year zero hard easy banking math
[11:07] right there 200 minus 200 Zero you've
[11:11] got a guy making 35 000 a year and he
[11:13] spends 20. he's got more than the guy
[11:15] that made 200. simple math right so it's
[11:19] not what you make it's what you keep now
[11:21] a lot of times when you mention that
[11:23] from the pulpit people are like no we're
[11:24] supposed to give it to God and yes
[11:27] ties should be your first thing on your
[11:29] budget Ty's an offering the scripture
[11:31] says they robbed him in ties and
[11:33] offering right didn't just say ties it
[11:35] also said offering so those should be
[11:37] the two first things on your list and
[11:39] the good thing about that is it's easy
[11:41] to plan out
[11:44] so let's just say
[11:46] you spend
[11:48] five dollars a day
[11:51] five business days a week right so
[11:53] that's 260 days we take off the weekends
[11:57] that's about thirteen hundred dollars a
[11:58] year so I'm horrible for this
[12:02] um all you coffee drinkers are gonna
[12:04] hate me but your 13 coffees
[12:07] 7.50 that's about twenty four hundred
[12:10] dollars a year
[12:12] it's expensive it's the little things I
[12:13] think Benjamin Franklin says and I think
[12:15] it's later in here a small leak will
[12:17] sink a great ship
[12:19] so Allison's getting a 750 coffee
[12:23] Stewart's getting a 13 frap I don't know
[12:25] what it is that's 20 a day just on
[12:27] breakfast so where and I'm above no one
[12:31] here so I did the math one time I was
[12:33] getting
[12:34] about I've spent about nine bucks on
[12:36] breakfast every morning with an energy
[12:38] drink and a sausage biscuit or something
[12:40] else then I was going at lunch and spend
[12:42] about ten eleven dollars so that was 20
[12:45] some dollars a day that I was spending
[12:47] in food
[12:49] um and not healthy food you know there's
[12:51] there's a lot to this financial
[12:52] financial piece that also deals with
[12:55] your health
[12:56] you know whenever you're whenever you're
[12:58] more mentally stable and you you handle
[13:00] your your money management it makes you
[13:03] look at things a little bit different
[13:04] and you start looking at the longevity
[13:06] of things and that's where you start
[13:08] saying well
[13:09] you know I've got this planned for four
[13:11] or five ten years you start doing things
[13:13] even healthier at home if you start
[13:15] eating at home and not eating out
[13:16] actually it kind of trickles down to so
[13:18] many different things but money
[13:20] management is not hard mentally the
[13:22] numbers thing is really easy writing it
[13:24] down is really easy but it's emotional
[13:25] you know because we are geared and I
[13:28] think I've told brother Ben this before
[13:30] but you know people will talk to you at
[13:32] the bank or talk to you about almost
[13:35] their intimate life their their their
[13:37] darkest Secrets but they won't talk to
[13:39] you about money
[13:40] you know like if you know it's one of
[13:42] the topics I've been reading some
[13:43] different studies and and and a lot of
[13:45] people that are going on on dates and
[13:47] stuff now they will they will talk more
[13:50] like they'll be if they're meeting
[13:52] someone for a date they'll talk more
[13:53] about their history of sexual partners
[13:55] than they will about their credit card
[13:57] debt or other debt that's how intimate
[13:59] that is and so it's something that's
[14:01] geared in humans and and I don't know if
[14:03] they've actually figured out the why
[14:04] that it's geared so much in us but
[14:06] that's a secret part that we don't want
[14:08] to tell anybody else and and so we've
[14:11] got to get over that that's the first
[14:13] step you've got to get over is is pride
[14:15] and I am a horribly that's one thing
[14:19] that I've always struggled with and so
[14:21] driving a beat up truck for the last
[14:23] four years has really helped that I
[14:25] turned my air conditioner on with a pair
[14:27] of pliers it has helped my pride
[14:29] somewhat
[14:31] now that and that's a good thing I and
[14:34] honestly
[14:35] you know I go back and forth
[14:37] on a new vehicle and if you've got a new
[14:40] vehicle and you've got a vehicle payment
[14:41] know that I'm gonna say some harsh
[14:43] things but don't take it out on me okay
[14:44] so just give me just a little bit
[14:46] but
[14:48] you know to me I started looking at that
[14:50] and I was like you know
[14:52] I can drive a really really nice truck
[14:55] or I can quit working about 15 years
[14:57] earlier
[14:58] I was like I'm gonna quit 15 years
[15:00] earlier I was like this is an easy
[15:02] question for me now that's not for
[15:04] everybody
[15:05] but my why was I want to be the owner of
[15:08] my time and I want to spend time with my
[15:10] family now I am not against all debt I'm
[15:13] a commercial loan officer
[15:15] I make loans all the time
[15:17] and and I'm not against them and I have
[15:20] a couple loans on businesses that I do
[15:23] not have to pay so I want you to be very
[15:25] clear if you've got a loan on something
[15:26] that's making you money you should do
[15:28] that okay now if it's a poor investment
[15:30] it's only going to make you money for a
[15:31] year but you owe four or five years on
[15:33] it you need to obviously study that out
[15:35] okay but your why
[15:37] will always beat your reason to quit if
[15:39] you have a good why so married couples
[15:42] again you have to agree on this
[15:43] unfortunately it will not work with just
[15:45] one and then you've got to ask yourself
[15:47] why do you want to be financially stable
[15:49] you know you you asked this to a lot of
[15:53] people they want more they want more
[15:55] right they just say I want more and I
[15:57] want more money I want more money well
[15:58] if you're not happy with what you got
[15:59] now why would you be happy with more
[16:01] so you've got to get that you've got to
[16:03] get to that point where you realize well
[16:04] what do I really want you know me I say
[16:06] well I want more money what I'm saying
[16:08] is I want more time
[16:09] and I know no one likes to hear this my
[16:12] wife's not in here I want more time to
[16:13] go hunting and fishing be with my boys
[16:14] be with my little girl I wanna that's
[16:16] what I want when I say I want more money
[16:18] that's what I want and so that's kind of
[16:20] what my goal is but you've got to sit
[16:22] down with your husband and wife and and
[16:23] you've got to make that decision why do
[16:25] you want to be financially stable
[16:28] and to a lot of a lot of people thinking
[16:30] well that's a stupid question why
[16:31] wouldn't I want to be financially stable
[16:33] well then why aren't you right
[16:37] not a lot of amens on that man
[16:40] but I want to control my time I want to
[16:42] be with my family and I want to also
[16:43] change my my generational family so my
[16:47] children I want them to come into this
[16:49] different I pray my kids do not go to
[16:52] college
[16:53] I know that sounds crazy but I really
[16:54] pray they don't I would love to have
[16:56] enough rental houses by the time they
[16:58] get old enough that they could take over
[16:59] get a tradesman's job because I believe
[17:01] they can afford they can make a lot more
[17:03] money doing that those things or they
[17:05] can go there out of college and they can
[17:07] make just as much money doing those
[17:08] things
[17:09] so but that's just my own personal
[17:11] personal belief there
[17:13] but if they say they're going to college
[17:15] obviously I'm going to be go for it you
[17:17] know I'm I'm fine with that
[17:19] so gratitude is the best attitude
[17:23] if you're not happy with what you've got
[17:24] you will not be happy with more of it
[17:26] that's what we just talked about so
[17:28] Hebrews 13 5 says let your conversation
[17:31] be without covetness and be content with
[17:34] such things as you have for he has said
[17:37] I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[17:40] so I think one thing you need to
[17:41] remember when you're when you're coming
[17:42] into this is that that God is first
[17:45] right when you're doing this with your
[17:48] spouse and
[17:49] and you're doing this uh with your
[17:51] family
[17:52] you know the reason we put ties and
[17:54] offering up there first
[17:56] um is because that's our that's our duty
[17:57] to God that's that's what is expected of
[17:59] us but there is a a universal law and
[18:03] the scripture teaches about it in
[18:05] multiple places but when you the more
[18:08] you give the more you receive and so
[18:10] there is now
[18:12] there's kind of a caveat to that if
[18:14] you're giving to receive you know like
[18:16] if I go and and you know I give Caleb
[18:19] ten dollars but I know he's gonna give
[18:21] me you know maybe a few arrows back
[18:22] that's not giving that's a trade that's
[18:25] all it is so if you're you know if
[18:26] you're giving to church and you're like
[18:28] okay God's gonna give me I gave 200
[18:29] God's gonna give me 200 back that's a
[18:31] trade right you give without expecting
[18:35] anything in return that's the gift right
[18:37] that's where Jesus the gift unto us was
[18:40] salvation he gets he got nothing in
[18:42] return for that exchange now yes we get
[18:45] to spend we are his sons and daughters
[18:47] we get to spend eternity with him that
[18:48] that that's the exchange there but but
[18:50] that free gift of Salvation was nothing
[18:51] that you and I could do to earn it right
[18:53] and so we see that if you're not happy
[18:56] with what you've got if you're not
[18:58] grateful for what God has given you
[19:00] already why should he give you more okay
[19:02] so I'm just kind of laying a foundation
[19:04] for this class and I know it's it's a
[19:07] little bit back and forth and and I want
[19:09] to just jump into the budgeting and and
[19:11] the numbers and that's what I love doing
[19:12] but we're going to take it really really
[19:15] slow so
[19:17] so consistency is key
[19:19] in Proverbs it says a wise son maketh a
[19:24] glad father but a foolish son is the
[19:26] heaviness of his mother
[19:28] Treasures of wickedness profit at
[19:30] nothing but righteousness delivereth
[19:32] from death
[19:34] the Lord will not suffer the soul of the
[19:36] righteous to famish but he casteth the
[19:39] way the substance of the wicked
[19:40] he becometh poor that dealeth with a
[19:43] slack hand but the hand of the diligent
[19:45] maketh rich
[19:47] he that gaareth in the summer
[19:50] is a wise son he that sleepeth in
[19:52] Harvest is a son that callseth shame so
[19:55] many of y'all are probably familiar with
[19:58] you know make hay while the Sun's
[20:00] shining
[20:01] all right well that's what that last
[20:02] verse is is saying there you know if
[20:04] you're sleeping during Harvest time
[20:05] you're not you're not going to make any
[20:06] money
[20:07] but he that becometh poor that dealeth
[20:09] with the slack hands so
[20:12] what he's saying is you know if you're
[20:13] not diligent in what you're doing you
[20:15] will become poor and then it says but
[20:16] the hand of the diligent maketh he Rich
[20:19] so I want to make sure we look at the
[20:21] difference here
[20:22] sometimes working more
[20:25] does not always mean you're going to get
[20:26] more money you've got to be diligent
[20:28] with what you're making so again I go
[20:31] back to someone making two three four
[20:33] hundred thousand dollars a year if they
[20:36] spend two three four hundred thousand
[20:37] dollars a year that's still at the end
[20:38] of the year they have zero somebody
[20:40] who's making Thirty forty fifty thousand
[20:43] and only spending half of that they have
[20:45] more at the end of the year so you want
[20:47] to be diligent in whatever you've been
[20:49] given so
[20:51] if God's given you you know a 20 an hour
[20:54] job you want to be diligent with what
[20:56] God has given you you know first you
[20:57] want to pay your tithes you want to pay
[20:59] your offering and then
[21:01] from there you want to list your
[21:02] expenses in order of importance okay
[21:06] Now Dave Ramsey has this deal it's
[21:08] called the seven baby steps to financial
[21:10] peace and so step one is to save a
[21:13] thousand dollars
[21:14] I believe he calls us your rainy day
[21:16] emergency fund and he says I think the
[21:19] way he says it is is it's your rainy day
[21:21] fund and get ready because it's gonna
[21:23] rain so
[21:25] any of you that have had kids
[21:28] I have an HSA set up to where I put a
[21:30] certain amount in a week and it always
[21:33] gets really built up and I'm like oh yes
[21:36] I've got money for health care coverages
[21:37] you know and
[21:39] then my kids come along and it's like
[21:41] bam back in the basement they just they
[21:44] but that's what that money is for it's
[21:46] budgeted there for that purpose so if
[21:49] you've got children if you live a life
[21:51] you let them go outside get around other
[21:53] people they're going to get sick they're
[21:54] going to need these things so you you
[21:56] kind of know what you've got to plan for
[21:58] so Dave Ramsey's baby step number one is
[22:00] save a thousand dollars step number two
[22:02] is pay off all debt step number three is
[22:05] save three to six monthses of expenses
[22:07] for emergencies
[22:08] step four invest fifteen percent of your
[22:10] income for retirement step five save
[22:12] your college for your children
[22:13] six payoff house seven build wealth and
[22:17] give so you can see there's a lot of a
[22:19] lot of steps there
[22:21] now when Jen and I first started this we
[22:23] didn't know really how we were going to
[22:24] do it we didn't have a ton of debt I
[22:26] think we had
[22:27] we each had a car payment maybe a credit
[22:29] card maybe an ATV payment and a house
[22:33] payment and so
[22:35] that was kind of our stuff we had no
[22:38] kids so at that time I was talking about
[22:40] the bin about this in the back she
[22:41] worked as a as a home health nurse made
[22:44] plenty of money my money covered the
[22:45] bills we called her money the fund money
[22:47] and boy did we have fun with it it's
[22:50] been at all
[22:52] so you know I kind of look back and I'm
[22:53] like oh man I thought I'd just been
[22:55] smarter 10 years ago life would look so
[22:58] much different
[22:59] and so
[23:00] the first thing and and I love getting
[23:03] creative with this and I love seeing
[23:04] couples and people get creative with
[23:06] I've worked with with several different
[23:07] ones on this I've done it at work I've
[23:09] done it in church and I've just done it
[23:10] for people you know through the gym or
[23:12] wherever
[23:13] but the first thing is how to save a
[23:14] thousand dollars you know if anybody's
[23:16] struggling with money right now you're
[23:17] like oh man this is this is not going to
[23:19] happen you can do it I think Dave Ramsey
[23:22] says it really best when he says sell
[23:23] everything but the kids
[23:25] right you've got a thousand dollars
[23:28] worth of stuff laying around somewhere
[23:29] sell it
[23:31] you'll you'll find that whenever you
[23:33] lose an emotional attachment to money
[23:35] and items life gets a lot easier
[23:39] because you're you know you know you're
[23:41] emotionally attached to to to maybe this
[23:44] this item like I'm emotionally attached
[23:46] to my bow let's just use me for an
[23:47] example I'm emotionally attached to to
[23:49] my my hunting bow you know when you let
[23:52] go of that and it doesn't really become
[23:54] about the item but it becomes about
[23:56] maybe to me say the hunt the time with
[23:58] my children in the woods or the time by
[24:00] myself in the woods it becomes more
[24:02] about the experience than the item you
[24:04] know before I liked I liked being able
[24:06] to start my truck with the remote and
[24:08] get in it and drive and and do those
[24:10] things and it's not as fun turning my
[24:13] air on with a pair of pliers but now it
[24:14] gets me from A to B and I haven't had a
[24:16] payment in four five years so
[24:19] to me
[24:20] it's it when I when I remove myself from
[24:23] that emotional attachment to objects and
[24:25] Money life kind of changed a little bit
[24:28] now
[24:29] do not wait the time will never be just
[24:31] right start where you stand and work
[24:34] with whatever tools you may have at your
[24:36] command and better tools will be found
[24:38] as you go along the way that's a quote
[24:40] from Napoleon Hill so you sell
[24:43] everything that you've got except the
[24:44] kids
[24:45] and you can maybe throw your worst one
[24:47] in there
[24:48] yard sale everything you don't need or
[24:50] use and I'm really bad about this
[24:53] um and and Jen will tell you this if I'm
[24:54] not using something for a few weeks I
[24:56] will sell it on Facebook
[24:58] I just I cannot stand I mean if I have
[25:01] metal piled up behind my barn I will
[25:04] drive it to the scrap yard and and get
[25:06] rid of it it just it bothers me if I can
[25:08] see it there and I'm like you know that
[25:10] could be 20 bucks I'm gonna take it and
[25:12] do that now you don't have to get that
[25:14] bad
[25:15] but
[25:16] at first you need to kind of go crazy
[25:19] you need to kind of do this with all
[25:21] you've got now
[25:23] get a side job you don't need to have
[25:26] pride
[25:27] I had I think I've had two jobs at
[25:31] minimum for at least the last eight
[25:33] years until I quit embalming two years
[25:36] ago but I would work my day job then I'd
[25:38] go and bomb at night and then all that
[25:40] money would be used to pay off debt or
[25:43] do something else with it financially
[25:45] for the family so you've got to get
[25:48] creative with this you need to sit down
[25:50] with your spouse
[25:51] come over the plan how are we going to
[25:52] save a thousand dollars now
[25:54] you know a lot of items that we that we
[25:57] spend money on
[25:59] our generation is about consumerism it's
[26:02] about items
[26:03] you get on your phone you get on
[26:04] Facebook what do you have ads you know
[26:06] Instagram what do you have ads you get
[26:08] on YouTube what do you have ads we are a
[26:12] consumer based
[26:14] country
[26:15] it's about things
[26:17] my little boy I was giving him an
[26:19] example the other day
[26:20] and he had somebody had bought him this
[26:23] or he actually bought him this video
[26:24] game I made him buy it and I hate video
[26:27] games I just want to make sure you know
[26:28] that and these are clean and approved by
[26:30] the parents but I do not like them I
[26:32] think they think they I think they lead
[26:34] to addiction down the road and so we're
[26:36] we're working on that right now but so
[26:38] there's a lot of opinions coming from
[26:40] Alan tonight but I'm not preaching I'm
[26:42] not representing the church anyway this
[26:43] is just me so
[26:45] so he has this game for fifty dollars
[26:47] which I'll let him buy with his own
[26:48] money because he needs to respect what
[26:50] he gets and
[26:52] so he's like Daddy I can sell this
[26:55] 15 bucks and I'll have 15 bucks
[26:59] like but you you net lost 35 dollars
[27:03] right because you had 50 in the
[27:05] beginning
[27:06] so you you gave away and wasted 35 so
[27:09] I've explained that to couples before
[27:11] you know I've bought a 30 000 car and
[27:14] you and a couple years later you sell it
[27:16] for 20 you're like oh I got the 20 back
[27:17] good deal but you lost 10.
[27:20] right so explaining that to people
[27:22] sometimes loses pulls that emotional
[27:25] attachment to that object away a little
[27:26] bit you know I took my bow into the the
[27:29] shop the other day and you know I think
[27:31] I can't remember what I paid for it I
[27:32] traded my old bow in on it and some
[27:34] other stuff and but he offered me 500
[27:36] for it I think when I got it
[27:40] new is around eight nine hundred bucks I
[27:42] think I don't know my wife's not in here
[27:44] maybe a thousand I don't know
[27:46] if I traded in on it
[27:49] and so like to me all I heard was
[27:52] you're losing 500 really really loud in
[27:55] my head that's all I could hear and so
[27:57] when you begin to do that you begin to
[27:59] think a little bit more about your
[28:00] purchases and I've I've sat down with
[28:01] matney and talked to him about
[28:02] depreciating assets which we're not
[28:04] going to get into today and appreciating
[28:06] assets
[28:07] so we'll get on to that in like the
[28:08] third the third section but get creative
[28:11] I want you to save a thousand dollars as
[28:13] fast as you can okay so the next the
[28:15] next time when we come back we're going
[28:16] to actually do a budget I'm just gonna
[28:18] go over these baby steps real quick the
[28:20] baby step two is pay off all debt
[28:23] so you pay off all debt except the house
[28:25] you start with the smallest debt you pay
[28:27] it off first then you take the funds
[28:29] from the smallest debt you put it
[28:31] towards the next smallest debt this is
[28:32] called The Snowball Effect everybody's
[28:34] heard of The Snowball Effect
[28:36] um
[28:39] this is a tremendous way
[28:41] and a really fun way to pay off debt and
[28:43] I keep using the word fun
[28:45] but some of my favorite times was you
[28:48] know what gin would be
[28:50] budgeting money to being like okay
[28:53] rice and beans tonight for supper we
[28:56] saved eight bucks it's going to this
[28:58] that's some of my funnest
[29:00] funnest times
[29:02] yeah
[29:04] I have a different meaning of fun Joel
[29:09] so you start with your smallest debt so
[29:11] I'll give you an example and anybody who
[29:13] wants my slideshow can have it at any
[29:14] time
[29:16] you got credit card a balance is 375
[29:18] monthly payments 30.
[29:20] you've got an auto loan balance 6 500
[29:22] monthly payment 225. that number three
[29:25] is an ATV loan balance 7 800 monthly
[29:27] payment 199. so what you're going to do
[29:29] is you're going to take all your extra
[29:31] money after you save a thousand dollars
[29:33] let's say you have
[29:34] 300 left over than a month or a hundred
[29:37] you take all that and you apply it to
[29:39] your smallest debt you pay the minimum
[29:40] on everything else you don't let
[29:41] anything get behind
[29:42] and you do this until that card is paid
[29:44] off then the next month you have that
[29:46] payment in addition
[29:48] to whatever you have left over the month
[29:49] so it's two three hundred dollars
[29:51] you got the payment amount plus the two
[29:53] three hundred dollars you apply to the
[29:54] next one and you continue on and what
[29:56] happens is you're as you're freeing up
[29:58] that debt money
[29:59] the snowball gets bigger right so it's
[30:01] where you used to have a hundred dollars
[30:03] extra now you have two hundred dollars
[30:05] extra and then now you have three and
[30:06] four and five and so on and you continue
[30:08] to snowball down this now
[30:10] there are certain situations where
[30:12] businesses need debt I understand it um
[30:14] some of you self-employed guys that work
[30:16] for yourself sometimes the best tax
[30:17] write-off you got as a vehicle or
[30:19] equipment or maybe if it's a rental
[30:22] house it's a lawnmower weed eater
[30:23] whatever it is I understand that so
[30:25] you've got to take this understanding
[30:27] that a lot of this stuff is for W-2
[30:29] employees but it works and transitions
[30:31] to all kinds right it transitions down
[30:34] through there
[30:35] I am I am against Consumer Debt you know
[30:37] I'm not a big Consumer Debt guy I don't
[30:40] mind business stuff because it makes you
[30:42] money
[30:43] now you make all the minimum payments on
[30:45] the debt except until it's all gone okay
[30:47] and then you roll that money into the
[30:49] next one so does everybody understand
[30:49] anybody got questions no one spoke out
[30:51] or through anything
[30:53] yeah no everybody having fun
[30:56] that was not wholeheartedly
[31:00] Stewart's like I just want to get out of
[31:01] here it's 30 more minutes
[31:04] all right so so me and Jen some fun
[31:06] things that we did I keep using the word
[31:07] fun
[31:09] cutting expenses to me was the funnest
[31:11] thing in the world and so like
[31:15] I like to negotiate
[31:17] that don't matter what it is I just like
[31:18] to negotiate
[31:20] so I would call at T with I'd not even
[31:24] checked with Verizon I'd be like hey I'm
[31:25] leaving you Verizon's got a better deal
[31:26] I'm out you know what if we cut your
[31:29] bill you know you've been a good value
[31:30] customer I went down through that and I
[31:32] lowered my monthly expenses by a couple
[31:34] hundred bucks you'd have thought I had
[31:36] won a million dollars when I got off the
[31:38] phone for the day but take a day sit
[31:41] down and do those things finding
[31:43] subscriptions that you've had for years
[31:45] I had a Napster subscription which I
[31:48] think it was for music I don't even know
[31:51] might have been a podcast thing that I'd
[31:53] got and it was like 13.99 a month just
[31:56] been there
[31:58] for a year then two years and I was like
[32:01] oh when I got rid of that it was just so
[32:03] much fun
[32:05] so you want to go through and you want
[32:06] to you know 13.99 what's that that's a
[32:09] hundred and nuts
[32:10] 136 something more a year 150 bucks a
[32:13] year you know that I could spend on
[32:15] something else or save and invest or
[32:18] give to somebody that's in need
[32:20] uh my biggest thing
[32:22] now I went back through which I talked
[32:23] about earlier was was food and drink and
[32:25] energy drink you know energy used to be
[32:27] like 299 now it's like 368. it's four
[32:30] bucks when you go get a drink
[32:32] and coffee according to Allison is seven
[32:35] seven fifty I think Jen's is around nine
[32:38] yeah I think Jen's around nine coffee's
[32:41] expensive in Asheville
[32:43] I don't have a lot of options so it's
[32:44] just just out there
[32:46] she does not drink that a lot she makes
[32:48] coffee at home
[32:50] so you need to go through and in your
[32:53] homework when we get to the very end
[32:54] which I may have to skip ahead but I'm
[32:55] going to give you the the homework you
[32:57] got to look at through necessary
[32:58] expenses and then unnecessary expenses
[33:01] and my unnecessary side was huge my
[33:04] necessary was not really that bad so but
[33:06] examples you know necessarily expensive
[33:08] you may need internet at home
[33:09] when I called my internet provider I
[33:11] actually ended up saving 105 a month and
[33:14] got faster speeds
[33:15] but you know once you set it up you just
[33:17] kind of leave it and you let it go and
[33:18] and that's where you know you look at
[33:20] you look at your spiritual life it's the
[33:21] same way you have a little thing that's
[33:23] nagging at you just let it go for years
[33:24] and finally it builds up to one big
[33:26] thing so it's good to fix these things
[33:28] cell phone company I called save money
[33:31] on the phone bill
[33:33] you know
[33:34] how much
[33:36] and one thing that I look at with people
[33:37] is is how much is enough
[33:40] all right
[33:41] you know how many shoes do you need how
[33:44] many belts do you need if you ask me how
[33:45] many belts you need you need one belt
[33:47] okay you need one belt it could be Brown
[33:50] and it'll fit anything it'll match
[33:51] anything Joel's shaking his head
[33:57] I have one pair of dress shoes one pair
[33:59] of work shoes one pair of tennis shoes
[34:01] and one work boots it's all I need I got
[34:03] two feet
[34:04] can't wear them more at the same time
[34:07] now you don't have to be as Extreme as
[34:09] me
[34:10] you got again you shouldn't be unhappy
[34:14] right if this causes you to be an
[34:17] unhappy irritable person that your
[34:19] spouse is like oh man
[34:21] I just gave a dollar in the off extra in
[34:23] the offering and my husband just head
[34:25] flew off you know like you don't want to
[34:26] be you want to get to that point you
[34:28] want to do this but that's again goes
[34:30] back to why are you doing this you know
[34:32] for me again if I could get up in the
[34:34] mornings and and just be with my family
[34:36] I think that'd be just the greatest
[34:37] thing I love home more than anywhere
[34:39] that's it's hard to get me to go away
[34:40] from my house I enjoy my home
[34:43] and so so that's my why I want to do
[34:45] that so if you don't have the correct
[34:46] wife it's just a big build build up
[34:48] money and drive nice cars and do those
[34:50] things that's fine that's a good why you
[34:52] should do that if you can that's fine
[34:53] but you've got to make sure your why is
[34:55] right okay you don't want to you don't
[34:57] want to cause
[34:58] stress or hardship or anything else on
[35:01] your family life is hard enough so
[35:04] um so how much is enough you need to ask
[35:06] yourself that question you know
[35:08] I think I've got I won't I won't skip
[35:10] ahead but you know one thing that taught
[35:13] me working at a funeral for nine years
[35:15] is you don't take it with you
[35:17] right that's one of the I was very
[35:19] fortunate I say I was very fortunate to
[35:20] work in the funeral home but now a lot
[35:23] of the remaining people they would fight
[35:25] over money but the one that was gone not
[35:26] a word about it
[35:31] no one woke up and said hey put the
[35:33] money in the casket
[35:34] you can't do that you can't take it with
[35:36] you
[35:37] you can't so how much is enough what is
[35:39] enough now
[35:41] again that's up to you and your wife you
[35:44] individually that's up to you all
[35:47] so there was a study I did it one time
[35:49] it takes a very very long time but
[35:52] there's a book called your money or your
[35:54] it's called your life or your money
[35:56] it was written
[35:58] Vicki Robinson did a review of it I
[36:00] can't remember who actually wrote the
[36:02] book but
[36:03] what the study did is it had you go back
[36:05] and track every scent that had come into
[36:07] your life so like I went back even when
[36:10] I had birthday money I would write that
[36:12] down and the amount of money that I had
[36:13] had come into my life was astronomical
[36:16] it was a lot more than I would have
[36:17] thought
[36:18] and then I looked at what I had left
[36:20] over I was like oh
[36:21] so you can do this the book is called
[36:23] your money excuse me your life or your
[36:26] money and there's a work there's a work
[36:28] program in there that says track every
[36:29] sin that's coming to your life and what
[36:30] they deal with in that book
[36:32] and they call it life energy
[36:36] um they're a little hippie-ish
[36:37] but it's you're trading your life energy
[36:39] for for for money
[36:42] you're trading you so when I go to work
[36:44] eight hours a day
[36:46] I'm trading eight hours of my life which
[36:49] if you look at my life expectancy I'm
[36:51] almost halfway there at 45 years left of
[36:53] life expectancy that's that's where I'm
[36:55] at
[36:55] so if you look at that I'm trading eight
[36:57] hours of that precious time and I think
[37:00] if you if you were to go in the funeral
[37:02] home you know I've never had anyone say
[37:05] to me I wish they made more money I wish
[37:07] they did this always I wish I had more
[37:09] time
[37:10] that's what everyone has said is I wish
[37:12] we had more time I've never had anyone
[37:16] come up oh man I wish you had just
[37:18] bought this new car with this bunny that
[37:20] way I wouldn't have to go through
[37:21] probate nobody I wish I had more time
[37:24] so there's a lot of neat exercises that
[37:27] you can do and what that does is it
[37:29] paints a picture for you
[37:31] and you can kind of see
[37:33] where you've been where you're at now
[37:35] and then you have the choice I think
[37:37] what's the coolest thing is you have the
[37:38] choice to alter
[37:40] your future
[37:41] in a good way bad way whatever way you
[37:43] want you have the choice to now alter
[37:45] that and change that trajectory of your
[37:48] family and again that's why I say
[37:51] you know with with my kids I think it's
[37:53] in Proverbs it says a wise man leaves an
[37:55] inheritance to his children's children
[37:56] that's a big thing
[37:58] to leave it to your children's children
[38:00] you have changed the generational wealth
[38:04] of your family as to where your children
[38:07] come into an inheritance and it's so
[38:09] much and and they have been taught to
[38:11] manage that so well that their children
[38:13] and you change the generational wealth
[38:15] of your family
[38:17] now
[38:18] The Next Step baby step three save three
[38:20] to six months of expenses
[38:22] and I put in here free at last free at
[38:24] last but your debt is all paid off now
[38:27] and you've got
[38:30] throwing stuff Caleb
[38:32] so how do you figure out how much three
[38:34] to six months of expenses you need
[38:36] you write down your expenses and you
[38:38] multiply it you write down your monthly
[38:40] expenses you multiply it times three or
[38:42] six again hard math that's how you
[38:45] figure it out
[38:46] now
[38:48] you want to take your total budget this
[38:50] is not just bills that are actually
[38:51] going to come due in the next six months
[38:52] you want to look at your expenses over
[38:55] the year right so if you've got
[38:58] you know an electric bill is obviously
[39:00] higher in July and August in Arkansas
[39:01] than it is in April or May
[39:04] so you want to go back through it is a
[39:06] lot of homework but you get your bills
[39:07] from your electric company from January
[39:09] to December
[39:11] [Laughter]
[39:13] you can't be talking in class to it
[39:16] oh
[39:17] is she mom quit making noises you're
[39:19] bothering Stewart
[39:22] just the way you saw sometimes gets us
[39:25] son-in-laws
[39:27] but you want to annualize it okay and
[39:29] then you get an average that's how you
[39:30] want to save your three to six months
[39:31] expense and now I will tell you when you
[39:33] get this done
[39:34] it will it will give you a little peace
[39:36] of mind that is pretty nice
[39:38] and it's not you know in three months
[39:40] three to six months expenses a lot of
[39:41] people think well oh my gosh that's a
[39:43] lot of money well if you've cut your
[39:44] expenses down and you're just living
[39:45] what you necessity what you need it's
[39:48] really not that much you know I look at
[39:50] my house payment my electric payment
[39:51] whatever else I've got I list those
[39:54] expenses out and then I want to have
[39:55] three to six months worth of that
[39:57] so that I can manage okay and again this
[40:00] is
[40:01] we're not pulling any extra money from
[40:03] ties we're not pulling any extra money
[40:04] from offerings if we're given to a
[40:06] family member we're not pulling we just
[40:07] budget those things so that we know what
[40:09] we're doing
[40:10] it's I think Dave Ramsey talks about it
[40:12] really best it's like your your money as
[40:14] soldiers and you're telling each one of
[40:15] them where to go and we'll get into this
[40:17] year when we do the second class we'll
[40:19] do a zero based budget and it's where
[40:22] and Jenny had a hard time with us and
[40:23] she's streaming right now but and we
[40:25] still we talk about this today but you
[40:27] tell every dollar where to go so at the
[40:28] end of the month every every month is
[40:30] zero
[40:31] but you you told a hundred dollars to go
[40:33] to savings or 115 to go to investment so
[40:36] but at the end of the month it's always
[40:37] zero you always balance to zero and I'll
[40:40] explain that in the in the budget class
[40:42] but
[40:43] so for like me and Jen I put an example
[40:45] on here so I put Ty's offering
[40:48] um when Jen quit working one thing that
[40:50] we decided to do was to continue to
[40:52] contribute to her retirement account
[40:53] which is an IRA
[40:55] and so let's say you have a spouse that
[40:59] that's working or not working and of
[41:00] course you've got to get to these baby
[41:01] steps you've got to get through this
[41:03] but
[41:05] once we got through that and she did not
[41:07] have to work or we got a business where
[41:08] she could manage that
[41:10] we still continued donating to her or
[41:13] investing in her retirement so
[41:16] that's a good thing to do I'm not saying
[41:18] it's something you have to do but the
[41:20] thing we the way we've got our set up
[41:23] as Jen has an IRA is a Roth IRA so we
[41:26] pay the taxes on the way in and explain
[41:28] some some retirement stuff
[41:30] so a Roth IRA or a Roth 401k you pay the
[41:34] taxes on the way in so you get your
[41:36] money tax-free now 401K you cannot would
[41:38] start withdrawing to 59 and a half so
[41:40] even if you get financially free at 50
[41:42] you cannot touch your 401k for another
[41:44] nine and a half years an IRA the Roth
[41:46] IRA that we have set up after five years
[41:49] you can touch that money
[41:51] so what we have done is if we by the
[41:54] grace of God get to retire early before
[41:55] I can draw for my 401k
[41:57] we will pull from Jen's Ira to cover
[42:00] that until we can pull from my 401k so
[42:02] does that make that makes sense you need
[42:04] to set up your investment strategy for
[42:06] how you want your life to be in 10 years
[42:07] not for how it is now right so you know
[42:11] in 10 years you know people still be at
[42:13] home because I think when she graduates
[42:15] I'll be 50
[42:17] I don't know it's not that old but 50
[42:19] something 53
[42:21] maybe no
[42:24] yeah yeah it's not that old
[42:26] so our typical budget is Ty's offering
[42:29] investco or excuse me Jen's retirement
[42:31] account in AC
[42:33] Electric
[42:35] then we put money into our savings we
[42:38] budget
[42:39] we put enough money into our kids saving
[42:41] which I'll explain that a little bit
[42:43] Farm life now we have term life
[42:46] insurance which I'll go over if you are
[42:47] a if you are the income producer for
[42:49] your household you need term life
[42:50] insurance
[42:52] what you want to do is you want to try
[42:54] to have 10 years
[42:56] worth of life insurance so I think I
[42:58] have maybe over a million dollar term
[43:00] life policy for like a 20-year Rider
[43:03] I have a million dollars so that so that
[43:06] when I die but that doesn't that's not
[43:08] expensive it's like 57 a month if you're
[43:10] healthy and good
[43:12] a whole life policy for that amount
[43:13] would cost you two 200 plus now it does
[43:17] it does accumulate cash
[43:19] and and the way they sell you a whole
[43:21] life policy is is you get that money
[43:23] back at the end
[43:24] but my goal is to be self-insured by the
[43:26] time that I'm at retirement age where I
[43:28] have no debt so if I died my wife would
[43:30] have enough money to live right so the
[43:33] term life for you young working guys you
[43:36] need term life insurance for 10 years of
[43:38] what you're making now so that your wife
[43:40] does not have to go back to work within
[43:41] the next 10 years she can have time to
[43:43] think about it deal with it
[43:45] um
[43:46] God leads a new man into her life I
[43:48] don't know how that works but
[43:51] but she's got time all right she'd have
[43:53] to run to the next guy that's got money
[43:54] right we give her options
[44:00] some people like that joke
[44:03] but you do you you do need that so then
[44:05] we're going down to our ATT Bill State
[44:07] Farm for auto groceries gas restaurants
[44:12] and I had on here uh rent or or home uh
[44:16] house payment
[44:17] so a lot of people were like you know
[44:19] you can't eat out on this budget you can
[44:21] if you budget for it
[44:23] you can do whatever you budget for and a
[44:25] lot of people are like this tells you
[44:27] all the things I can't do and actually
[44:28] it tells you all the things you can do
[44:30] and so you set guide limits and and
[44:33] guide rails for yourself and so I'm
[44:35] getting about I'm getting really really
[44:36] close I'm gonna speed up
[44:38] so it is achievable
[44:40] um imagine you know when your homework
[44:42] tonight or over the next few weeks is to
[44:44] go home and write out your expenses and
[44:46] your income so that we can come back and
[44:48] we can do a budget
[44:49] but imagine having all the money that
[44:51] you typically spend on bills or
[44:52] unnecessary expenses momentary Pleasers
[44:55] all that money being saved for
[44:56] emergencies and just imagine how much
[44:57] better that would be you know go home
[44:58] tonight and imagine that and be like
[45:00] you know if
[45:02] if something happened to me tomorrow I
[45:04] really wouldn't have to worry about
[45:05] these things for for three to six months
[45:09] this fund is set up
[45:12] to give you peace of mind completely
[45:14] it's not something you invest
[45:16] you don't take this money and put an
[45:18] investment that you can't get your hands
[45:19] on
[45:20] this is money you just set aside for
[45:22] Peace of Mind it'll make your home life
[45:23] better it'll make everything better
[45:25] now there's nothing
[45:27] like the peace that Christ can give you
[45:29] Christ gives you a peace that passes all
[45:32] understanding but this financial piece
[45:34] is an Earthly peace this journey is hard
[45:36] enough don't make it worse by adding
[45:38] unnecessary stress on yourself okay
[45:42] we do not save The Horde we save to
[45:44] protect our families and Give Peace of
[45:46] Minds and a troubled word world is that
[45:48] right
[45:49] brother Bynum actually said God don't
[45:50] want you to be frowning God wants you to
[45:51] be happy he said the human heart was
[45:53] made to be happy and if you go and ask a
[45:56] lot of people what their stress is in
[45:57] life they will say money and even even
[46:00] for me
[46:02] you look at what inflation has done to
[46:04] the grocery bill of the average family
[46:06] over the last little bit is astronomical
[46:08] I bought two things of Velveeta cheese
[46:11] and her Mississippi mud cake this
[46:14] morning before church and it was 28
[46:16] dollars
[46:17] for the you know the really nice big
[46:20] Velveeta cheese
[46:22] that some of y'all may have ate just
[46:25] crazy how much that costs milk five
[46:27] dollars four four plus for a gallon of
[46:29] milk
[46:30] so
[46:31] in 2020 gas was one or 2019 179 now it's
[46:36] 339 349 so
[46:39] you know during that time having this
[46:41] extra money and having the the little
[46:44] Consumer Debt
[46:46] or not having that it your lifestyle
[46:48] doesn't have to change in those Ebbs and
[46:50] flows of the economy
[46:52] so so understand that
[46:55] baby step four is invest 15 of your
[46:58] income or retirement a lot of you
[46:59] self-employed guys or girls you don't
[47:01] have the option to where your employer
[47:03] comes in and says you know I'm gonna
[47:04] match three six percent whatever you
[47:06] give I'm gonna match it
[47:07] and it is hard to go find your own
[47:09] investing
[47:11] um financial advisor
[47:13] um I remember me and Jen tried one time
[47:15] this guy just made me so mad we paid off
[47:19] all our debt we had a little bit of
[47:20] money
[47:22] and uh
[47:23] I remember he sat down with us and we
[47:25] want to start investing this was before
[47:26] I think this is right after we got back
[47:28] and did all these steps and
[47:30] and it just wasn't enough for him oh man
[47:33] it just kind of flew all over me you
[47:35] know so it is hard to find a financial
[47:37] advisor because they're looking for Big
[47:38] Ticket items but find someone if you
[47:41] have to get turned away two or three
[47:43] times you'll eventually run into someone
[47:44] who has your your best interests at
[47:46] heart
[47:47] so
[47:49] um
[47:50] what you want to do is take 15 of your
[47:52] income and invest towards retirement now
[47:53] remember the way these baby steps work
[47:55] which we'll we'll go over that in the
[47:57] budget list them out for you about 13
[47:59] minutes
[48:01] you cannot move on to the next step to
[48:03] the previous step is done so you don't
[48:05] move to step three until two is done
[48:06] one's done you want me to four to one
[48:08] two and three is done
[48:10] so
[48:12] if you have an employer that that
[48:13] matches
[48:15] and I've heard a lot of people say no
[48:18] offense to message people and myself
[48:20] included
[48:21] but we all have this mentality that
[48:25] which I believe the Rapture could happen
[48:27] tomorrow bro Ben's getting really
[48:28] nervous
[48:30] but I've talked to so many message
[48:31] people who are like we don't need to
[48:32] invest because the Rapture is coming
[48:35] that's great I told brother Ben the
[48:37] other day
[48:38] I feel like I'm going to invest all my
[48:39] life and then as soon as I retire the
[48:42] Rapture is going to take place and I'm
[48:43] going to have all this planned out it's
[48:45] God's sense of humor for me which is
[48:47] fine either way I win right so you might
[48:50] as well go ahead and plan now
[48:53] because
[48:54] it would really sting to get to the end
[48:56] and be like oh I've got to keep I've got
[48:58] to keep working you got to keep working
[48:59] now my plan for retirement is many of
[49:02] you know I don't like to sit still
[49:03] yesterday our day off we worked all day
[49:07] and we enjoyed it the family did things
[49:09] together we and we cleaned out the cars
[49:11] we did these things and so you know my
[49:12] idea of retiring is not just to sit
[49:14] around and do nothing I want to be
[49:15] active I want to do things so
[49:18] when you hear this retirement phrase a
[49:19] lot of people think well I'm just gonna
[49:20] sit down and die
[49:21] that's not what you're that's not what
[49:23] you're supposed to do that's not it okay
[49:25] now you do not start investing until
[49:27] you're through baby step three and
[49:30] um
[49:31] you've got to understand when you get
[49:33] into investing
[49:35] you need a financial advisor and I'm not
[49:37] it so don't don't come to me with
[49:38] investing questions
[49:40] because you need someone who knows and
[49:42] understands the market and your age
[49:45] you know right now I was talking to
[49:48] somebody the other day an economic crash
[49:50] for me in the stock market is great
[49:51] because I buy things cheaper for the
[49:54] next three to five years but I'm not
[49:56] retiring for 10 plus so for me I can go
[49:59] and buy all this stuff cheaper but for
[50:01] somebody who's retiring in the next
[50:02] three to five years if they haven't
[50:03] pulled out and got into some fixed
[50:05] assets or fixed funds that's horrible
[50:07] for them
[50:08] so you need a financial advisor who's
[50:10] going to lead you in the right right
[50:11] direction they're going to look at your
[50:12] age look at your plan and they're going
[50:14] to go off of that okay I know we got off
[50:16] on the Weeds on that one
[50:18] maybe step five is safe for your kids to
[50:20] go to college I really do pray and I
[50:22] know I said it before I really pray my
[50:23] kids do not go to college I'm going to
[50:25] let them make the final decision
[50:26] obviously
[50:28] um but something neat that Jen and I do
[50:30] is we put
[50:32] um we opened some piggyback say pinky
[50:35] Bank savings piggyback
[50:37] nobody you know piggyback ride
[50:40] Piggy Bank savings for our kids and we
[50:42] put ten dollars a week in there it's
[50:43] budgeted so 30 a week goes to our kids
[50:45] now we use that money throughout the
[50:49] year we go to Brand Center we birthdays
[50:52] presents Christmas presents we have
[50:54] access to use that money and we do use
[50:56] it that's what it's there for so that's
[50:58] something cool we do because you know
[50:59] there's there's expenses that come
[51:00] through all the time but if you kind of
[51:02] just chip at it a little bit it really
[51:04] helps even equalize things out
[51:07] um
[51:08] my goal for my children just to tell you
[51:10] about I got nine minutes and I'm gonna
[51:11] speed through this and give you your
[51:12] homework
[51:13] my goal for my children is is to
[51:15] hopefully work for themselves or get you
[51:18] know you know if they want to be say a
[51:20] plumber
[51:22] um and they get they get that trades and
[51:24] they and they can work for themselves
[51:25] and they have the ability to make as
[51:26] much money as they want you know I think
[51:28] they say
[51:29] um the only business that has an
[51:31] infinite ability to increase
[51:33] profitability as an entrepreneur because
[51:35] they can make as much money as they want
[51:37] right now we know there's a limit to
[51:38] that but but still but that's what I
[51:40] would pray my kids would do
[51:42] and so I've already started working with
[51:43] my kids
[51:45] on what it is how to deal with money you
[51:48] need to talk to your kids about money
[51:49] they need to understand you know I
[51:51] talked to my Matty the other day I'm
[51:52] like you know when you ask me I'm going
[51:54] to take you to the store and you go and
[51:55] you go in there and you buy ten dollars
[51:57] worth of things I was like you know my
[51:59] mom worked hard for that money you know
[52:01] and trying to explain to them what the
[52:03] cost actually is it's her time that she
[52:06] had to go to work and earn that money
[52:08] and now she spent on that now if she
[52:09] wants to that's fine
[52:11] but it's not to where we always get our
[52:12] hand out we want things and teaching our
[52:14] kids
[52:15] because they're about to be filled with
[52:16] a life full of consumerism
[52:18] if you've been
[52:20] um I'm not saying anyone's been to an
[52:21] arcade lately but if you have what
[52:24] you've noticed used to you get tokens
[52:26] right you got tokens at the arcade you
[52:28] can play games with them now they've got
[52:29] cards they're training kids for for
[52:31] credit cards everything is centered
[52:33] around that that's what they're doing
[52:35] conspiracy theorist number one
[52:37] but you've got to teach your kids how to
[52:40] manage money and
[52:41] and I know I'm probably sound mean
[52:44] um but you know I want my kids to be
[52:46] workers too I don't want them to be lazy
[52:48] so going ahead and having them work now
[52:51] and paying them some money when they do
[52:52] work these things pay off down the road
[52:55] or I believe they will
[52:57] um and all of your kids are going to be
[52:59] different some are going to be natural
[53:00] Savers some are to be natural Spenders
[53:02] but teach your kids you know
[53:06] one thing I've really been working on is
[53:07] teaching your kids that the experience
[53:09] is so much greater than the thing
[53:11] right you know we're about to go on
[53:13] vacation
[53:15] or
[53:16] um the other day we went we rode over to
[53:18] the mountains and we just hit swimming
[53:19] holes all day we ate lunch
[53:22] cost us a little bit of money we drove
[53:24] the gas over there and we just hit free
[53:26] swimming holes on public land and that
[53:28] was a blast we collected rocks and
[53:30] teaching them it's more about the
[53:31] experience than us going to say Branson
[53:34] and spending a thousand dollars over the
[53:37] weekend but you've got to teach your
[53:39] kids that and and they see that it
[53:41] matters to you you know if if you're
[53:45] more about the items they're going to be
[53:47] more about the items they're going to do
[53:48] what you do baby step six is pay off the
[53:51] house
[53:52] um
[53:54] simple enough all excess cast goes to
[53:56] the house except for the 15 you're
[53:58] investing and what you have budgeted for
[54:00] the rest of your life and expenses
[54:01] baby step seven is called build wealth
[54:03] and give
[54:06] so the final step is don't be greedy
[54:08] when you become a person of value become
[54:10] a person that changes lives for the
[54:12] better
[54:13] so a quote from that book that I was
[54:15] talking about your money or your life he
[54:17] who knows he has enough is Rich so being
[54:20] happy with what you've got that's when
[54:21] you become wealthy if you live for
[54:24] having it all what you have is never
[54:26] enough so
[54:28] you know I was looking at I was reading
[54:29] the Joshua chapter one to our kids the
[54:32] other night before they went to bed
[54:33] before school
[54:34] and uh you know the scriptures be strong
[54:37] and very courageous and it goes down
[54:38] through there and what I never really
[54:39] realized you know the the two tribes and
[54:43] you ministers helped me out the two
[54:45] tribes that were getting their land on
[54:46] this side of Jordan
[54:48] right do you remember what Joshua said
[54:49] to them
[54:50] he said you're going to go cross with us
[54:52] and fight right
[54:54] and so I never really realized that and
[54:56] you know you get a lot of people who
[54:58] think
[55:01] and my promise is done I've been given
[55:03] my promise
[55:04] but what I love about the moral of that
[55:05] story is until everyone else had
[55:07] received their promise they had to go
[55:09] help
[55:09] right
[55:10] so
[55:12] you you older people you think well
[55:14] I'm done I've got my promise I've saved
[55:17] filled with a holy ghost I'm done well
[55:19] there's others that still need help
[55:20] fighting this fight right so so what
[55:23] that showed to me was like well yeah
[55:25] I've I've got it maybe I've got my stuff
[55:27] in control if you want to call
[55:28] Controlled Chaos
[55:30] but we should give and help others right
[55:32] so remember that
[55:36] five minutes I promise brother Ben
[55:39] so what we will do when we come back is
[55:41] we'll go over what's called a zero
[55:42] balance budget okay so what you're going
[55:46] to do when you go home tonight and this
[55:47] will actually tell who's wanting to be
[55:49] in the class and who's not but you'll
[55:50] write out your expenses you'll write out
[55:52] your income okay then what you're going
[55:55] to do is you're going to highlight
[55:57] your necessary expenses then you're
[55:59] going to underline your unnecessary
[56:00] expenses okay
[56:02] it's a little bit of work go to the bank
[56:04] get your bank statements pay for them if
[56:06] you have to
[56:07] whatever you got to do do it don't don't
[56:09] wait till tomorrow do it tonight
[56:11] and you're going to go through and
[56:12] you're going to list all this out and
[56:13] then I'm going to show you how to do a
[56:14] zero balance budget next week okay
[56:17] actually
[56:19] not sure when it is two weeks
[56:23] intentional spending once versus needs
[56:26] now
[56:27] money is something that you trade your
[56:29] life energy for you sell your time for
[56:32] money it doesn't matter if Ned sells his
[56:33] time over there for a hundred dollars
[56:35] and you sell it for twenty dollars an
[56:37] hour Ned's money is irrelevant to you
[56:39] the only real asset you have is your
[56:40] time the hours in your life that's
[56:43] really the only asset that we truly have
[56:45] you know if somebody sells their their
[56:47] money for or sells their time for a
[56:48] hundred dollars an hour and I sell it
[56:49] for 20 it doesn't matter that's
[56:51] irrelevant doesn't matter if people make
[56:53] more money than you doesn't matter if
[56:54] people make less money than you what you
[56:55] do with your time and your money
[56:57] management is between you and your
[56:59] spouse and God right so it's nothing
[57:01] that I'm going to get my nose into
[57:02] nothing anyone else should get their
[57:03] nose into but it is something you should
[57:05] get your nose into you should manage
[57:07] your money just like you manage your
[57:08] time
[57:10] and I put this in here just to kind of
[57:11] show you an example you know if you're
[57:13] if you're typical if you're 25 years old
[57:16] your life expectancy for a guy
[57:18] um is 54.8 years so it's about 480 000
[57:22] hours that you have left of life
[57:24] expectancy if you're 30 you got 50 years
[57:26] if you're 40 you got 40 years so
[57:31] the more of that time that I can buy
[57:33] back now
[57:34] the better that I'm going to be the
[57:36] happier that I'm going to be
[57:37] so a financial plan is something that
[57:39] has to be intentional you have to follow
[57:41] it and the thing that you have to
[57:43] remember
[57:44] with budgeting is where money controlled
[57:47] you now you control it
[57:49] it's where you lived your life by how
[57:51] much money you had or didn't have
[57:53] now you live your life on a plan okay it
[57:56] gives you the control back okay
[57:59] I uh I did a little thing for y'all just
[58:01] before we go I added up how many
[58:03] vehicles me and Jen had bought from 07
[58:05] to 2020 when we really got on the plan
[58:08] or 20 2018 sorry
[58:11] it's been about 227 thousand dollars on
[58:14] vehicles four-wheelers
[58:16] in about 13 years and that was just a
[58:18] new rig every year right new
[58:21] four-wheeler here new four wheeler there
[58:23] average car payment of 500 a month since
[58:25] 2000 to 2007 to 2020 is about 78 Grand
[58:29] so if you just had a car payment for the
[58:31] last few years that's what you're
[58:33] looking at
[58:35] so
[58:36] I factored up how much money that cost
[58:38] me in hours
[58:39] it cost me about 4 333 hours of my life
[58:42] to make those payments
[58:44] that I'll never get back
[58:47] so when I put in that I was like okay
[58:49] I get this you know
[58:51] you know it's 333 hours I didn't have
[58:53] with her thousand I didn't have Paxton
[58:56] two thousand I didn't have a matinee a
[58:58] thousand I didn't have a gin so it
[58:59] starts adding up
[59:03] I'm gonna skip through to the very end
[59:05] okay
[59:06] if you want to get with me after this
[59:08] we've got one minute your homework
[59:11] the first sheet you want to list out all
[59:13] your expenses I mean all
[59:15] if you spend money on something stupid
[59:16] just write down stupid expense
[59:19] the second sheet is you list out all
[59:21] your income if you work multiple jobs W2
[59:24] whatever it is you list it out
[59:26] then you go back to the first sheet you
[59:28] highlight your needs underline your
[59:30] wants second session we'll go over how
[59:33] to make a zero dollar budget the next
[59:35] financial class will be September 17th
[59:37] and that's when we'll actually get into
[59:38] the budget and we'll actually really dig
[59:40] into the Weeds does anybody have any
[59:42] questions or any comments
[59:45] no
[59:47] is it fun
[59:48] all right I think I think it will it
[59:51] will it will change your life for the
[59:53] better
[59:54] okay all right
[59:58] you were dismissed until three o'clock
