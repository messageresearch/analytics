that's what we want to look at this morning if the Lord will help us brother Bo song about it last night brother Wendell hit on it last night and I just got back to the room and it was on my heart I can't get it off so we're going to go this direction this morning and we trust it'll be a blessing to you we preach just just a while back but it's just on our hearts so we want to deliver our heart this morning appreciate each one coming out and appreciate all that was done for us while we was here and the wonderful food and the fellowship and the little cabin to stay in and I I appreciate that and heard some wonderful preaching some great men of God here and I feel the least of all of them and I have just a simple thought this morning because really that's the only kind I can preach but I trust it'll be a blessing to you if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of First John and we want to thank brother Ben for allowing us to come and just being here this weekend it's just been so wonderful uh I desire you to pray for my wife Monday morning early she's going to have surgery on one of her eyes and so we're going to be here tonight I'm going to leave early in the morning to get back in home I got about 600 miles to to travel and get back home to be with her so we can make sure I spend a little time before she has the surgery Monday morning so I appreciate you I know there's a lot to pray for there's so many needs but if you think about it just just say a little prayer for my queen I I appreciate that amen she sacrificed so much through the years first John chapter 4 I want to read verse 9 and also we only read Hebrews chapter 12 verse 2. do you love him yeah he's healing in his presence the Bible says this first John 4 9. and this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him that we might live through him Hebrews 12 2 amen thank you Father thank you Hebrews 12 2. looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God amen that's Bower heads I want to speak to you this morning on just a little thought of Because He Lives Heavenly Father we love you Lord we thank you for all that you've done for us father I pray this morning that you would make it real lord take us there God and let us see what you saw and feel what you felt father I commit this congregation and our self into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name and the Saints said God bless you you may be seated brother Branham in this scripture reading he says no God is saying here look unto me for I am God and there is none other and I like to say this morning that there is no God like our God there is no God like our God men make Gods out of their hands they fashion Gods out of their hands but we serve a god this morning that we didn't make with our imagination we didn't make with our hands but he made us with his hands and there is no God like our God he can do exceeding above all that you could ever hope for that you could ever desire for and you think well I know so much about God we've not even broke into the surface Harley of how great our God is and the prophet said and now God said here look unto me for I am God and there is none other and he said and I wonder in a time that we are living in now what could we look to that would be more solid than God and God is the word see so look to the word of God today for your answer look to the word of God today for your answer because let me tell you the Democrats don't have the answer the Republicans don't have the answer Washington don't have the answer but the answer today is here it's Jesus Christ the word the same yesterday today and forever the prophet said see look to the word of God today for your answer the Bible has the answer for this day it's had the answer for others day other days and it's gone it forever because it is Christy the same yesterday today and forever now there there is no stability in the society as we know it today they've ripped up the foundations of marriages they've ripped up the foundations of genders yeah and there's no stability in this unstable Society they have blurred the lies between right and wrong to the point that no they don't even know what the truth is anymore and so everybody is right in their own mind according to them and even in the days of Jesus we see this same attitude because Jesus stood before Pilate and pilate asked him what is truth and the sad thing about it is truth was standing right in front of it and then today when fox says CNN is fake and CNN says Fox's thing and everybody's looking for the truth of what they say is the truth and the truth is right here Among Us and yet they do not recognize it they call us a cult and Fanatics and this and that and bookworms and plain J's and all these comments that they made but they don't realize that truth is standing right before them that this all Hallelujah that this body that is on the Earth today is what God desired for this generation we didn't stagger into this thing God placed us here before the foundation of the world and he never put us here to lose he never put us here to give up or come on somebody but he put us here because he knew that we through the word would overcome the same amen the only foundation that is sure the only foundation that is true is the word of God on Christ the solid rock I stand on other ground is sinking sand amen that's not a song anymore that's a reality amen they say follow the science they don't even follow the signs if they thought of the science they wouldn't do some of this foolishness that they're doing amen amen but you see the word of God is an Ever present help in the time of trouble now when the children of Israel was living in the wilderness they were being bitten by snakes and the prophet said Moses couldn't pray for all of them so then God told him to go and erect the brass servant Serpent and put it on a pole and they were to look upon that brass Serpent and live and the prophet said let's take a symbol of that the first thing the brass serpent represented was Jesus himself because the serpent represented sin already judged from the Garden of Eden and Jesus was made sin for us knowing no sin but he was made sin for us the breast that the serpent made out of represented Divine judgment because brass is divine judgment and the pole of course was the cross and the brass serpent couldn't pray for anyone and they just looked at the brass Serpent and lived look and lived and that was a type of Christ and if they could look at that type and live if they could look at that type and live how much more are we to look at the anti-type Jesus himself Jesus himself to look and live the only way to live is through Jesus Christ for he said I am the way the truth and the life the prophet one time was up in Canada yeah and then some women come down through the hotel room with a bottle of liquor and they were drunk and they were kicking up their heels and he said I was standing there and they come by me and said one of them kicked up their leg and said whoopee this is life and he said I couldn't take it and I stepped out of the Shadow and said I grabbed her by the hand and said that's not life that's death that's death amen what the world calls living today it's death people starve they'll sell out their soul they'll shell out everything to be popular to have money there's nothing wrong with having money you got money God bless you but if that becomes your God that's wrong when you strive to become something big or something popular there's only one big one Among Us and people stop at this oil to be like this look what Collywood did to Miley Cyrus but people spend all kinds of money to buy Kate Spade pocketbook and what happened to Kate's face she hung herself in a hotel room because that is not living there is nothing that all it might satisfy the flesh for a while but it'll do nothing for the soul that hungers for God and God placed that desire in every one of us amen the Bible said she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she yet living the Bible says in First Corinthians 15 22 for as Adam as in Adam all die and Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive Hallelujah you see from the time we were conceived we were dying that's exactly the truth amen when I first come into this area I was 27 years old look at me today we're dying amen the promises you're born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life that natural birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated in a defeated World amongst defeated people a much defeated Creeds amongst defeated denominations but you've got to come to Victory somehow [Applause] and let me say there has to be a Victor before there could be a victory hallelujah look unto him and live the prophet said what did he do then he embraced the cross and on the cross he died for me and he died for you I want you to understand this morning the love of God so rich so pure that if he was the only person in the history of humanity that was ever lost he would have went to Calvary for you if you was the only person in the history of humanity that was ever sick he would have took every stripe on his back for your healing because you see the new birth is more than raised in your hand it's more than saying God sent a prophet it's more than having a picture of the pillar of fire the new birth is a personal experience you have met this person come on well I believe the message chose the devil but it ain't going to take him but one place and you know where that's at come on somebody but it is it's more than a handshake he wants it to be a personal revelation [Music] amen he embrace the cross he died for me and he died for you and for the world that he might restore us back again to God to what Sons and Daughters of God he didn't come to take us from a hog and make us a lamb he come to restore us back to our rightful position has Sons and Daughters of God [Applause] oh the prophet said if people can only see that if I could only pound that into the people Jesus died that he might take you away from this hybrid Church stuff that he might bring your minds and Faith away from what man has said back to what God Said come on not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days of Miracles has passed well maybe it won't happen it'll never happen with that kind of attitude it's a hybrid faith but he come to bring her faith back to the word of God for heavens and earth will pass away yet my words shall never fail amen then our faith don't rest on emotion it don't rest on sensation come on somebody it don't rest on how we feel Faith has a resting place that's the word of God Abraham [Applause] he might bring your minds and Faith away from what man has said back to what God Said not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days of Miracles past maybe it won't happen Jesus never died that we would have a weak Faith a hybrid Faith well I don't know if it'll work or not see he died to bring her faith back to what God Said he come to bring our faith back to what God Said because God will keep his word 100 times out of a hundred amen so go with me just for a few minutes this morning let's just take a little trip and if you go with me this morning now I can't preach as fast as these other guys I'm an old man so y'all better with me but go with me this morning young people we find ourselves in a garden and we see over there under a tree lays three men and they're sleeping and we go about a stone throw away and we hear a voice it's the voice of a man his voice is trembling he's in great agony and we can hear by the tone of his voice that he's afraid it is The Voice of Jesus brother Daryl Jesus afraid the Bible says in Hebrews 5 7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayer and supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared he's sweating because it's in agony he's shaking his body's shaking his voice his trembling and he's praying brother Kobe and his prayers so hard it's so sincere that he begins to sweat this ain't a God blessed Mama God bless daddy jumping this is praying from the depths of his soul here's a man that's wrestling it out with God between his will and the will of the father you see Jesus said many many times I come to do not my will but the will of he who sent me I only do that which I see my father do but here it's the only place we ever see that the will of Jesus comes into view and he's praying so earnestly and he sweats and this sweat is turning to Great drops of blood you see there's a medical condition known as hemotradosis and hematronosis is when the capillaries of the sweat glands they actually rupture and the blood sweet seeps into the sweat glands and you actually literally sweat blood it is like is it is a medical condition that happens under extreme physical and mental stress and the only place in the Bible re-read this is Luke Luke records this being a physician he understood what was happening for Luke said that being in agony and that word agony means a struggle for victory in the garden it was a struggle for victory because there has to be a Victor before there could be a victory [Applause] so in agony a struggle for victory the Bible said he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground okay he's praying yeah father if there be any other way for me Mark 14 he said Abba Father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me he said God you can do anything you're God you can do anything there could be another way don't make me drink this cup you're God you can do anything please I just got past for me and he gets up and he goes to his disciples where does he find him sleeping and he goes to Peter she said Peter wake up wake up Peter Peter just master what's wrong master I've never seen you like you're shaking I've seen you walk on water I've seen you raise the Dead I've seen you pray for I've seen you feed five thousand with the little boy's lunch I seen you walk on water but I never is that blood are you bleeding you're bleeding oh God Jesus said Peter Peter pray with me Peter much what do you want me to pray he goes back this time his brother being brought it out so well last night he prostrates itself to the ground father he went away the Bible says the second time praying he said oh Father if this gun may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done no you're asking for God's will in your life you're asking for a great thing because sometimes he'll bring a great trial to your family so that others can be helped right amen if there'd be no other way except I'd drink this cup Lord I will be done and the prophet said a conference was called he said Gabriel come down with that great sword wormwood came down other Angels Came Down sat around the rocks and here come that [Music] fill our fire hanging over his head and the angels are all watching what will be said what will be done In This Moment and the father begin to speak and the prophet said he said are you willing are you willing I can take you right now without Calvary you can go with me right now and let me say he could have because he was the sinless one I can take you right now with me are you willing is your love for the Brethren great enough is your love for that sinful stinking world that you were born in do you love them enough to forfeit your life do you love them enough to take their place to Bear their sins to the hardest cruelest death they will cut you to pieces they will drain every drop of blood from your body the prophecy there could be nothing thou that kind of death but him he could die of that kind of death but him and then that Comfort such a decision was made until the blood dropped from his brown he was under a strain and the sins of the world was upon him my sins my sins was upon him your sins was upon him Hallelujah Prophet said can you have that decision in your heart this morning can you forfeit that little filthy life of yours are you willing to look into his face and say not my will I'm a drunkard but I'll drink no more I'm a gambler but I'll gamble no more I'm immoral but I'll not be that way no more I'm a liar but I'll stop it today I'm a foul person but in this conference this morning I'll look into your face and I'll take like my master who died for me to make my way clear and I will say to him this morning not my will you will be done and after this conference with the father then guess who showed up Satan Satan began to talk to him just like he talks to you after you've had your conference with God oh you'll get a good blessing and you won't even pull out that road out there until the devil tell you you didn't get nothing somebody needs to tell the devil to sit down and shut up we don't we don't use that language around here we we teach our kids not to say shut up well then tell him to hush tell him something I don't ever understand what we let the devil do all the talking people come up in prayer and say the devil said this and the devil said that and the devil said this and the first thing I'm thinking is why do you listen to him you know he's a liar they can tell you everything the devil told them and they can't give you two good quotes that can't give you one good Bible scripture but they know everything the devil said somebody needs to tell him hush boy you're defeated my Lord Brooke Hallelujah my Lord broke your back of calvary the Here Comes Satan Satan with his poison breath he began to hiss like a serpent he began to say to our Lord the burden that you must carry far is it fair that you should pay for their sins you never drink you never lied you never lived immoral is it really fair that you should pay the price for their sins he's asking too much of you save yourself you can see he he saved himself he could save me yeah come on do you think do you think that in 2023 and all the technology and artificial intelligence do you believe they'll even care the calvary happened do you think they'll even acknowledge it by like the terrible devil this morning here in Hardy Arkansas there's a group of people that still cares there's a group of people that wants to say thank you Father thank you for saving my soul thank you for healing me thank you for restoring my marriage thank you for saving my children come on somebody we can't praise him enough if we had ten thousand tons we cannot praise him enough hey where there's a nod when has the nod become a form of worship wind is raising a finger oh God if I have breath give me breath to holler at a Hallelujah and an amen and I thank you Jesus I guess I have thanked the Lord ten thousand times for what he did for Jessica but if I live another 10 years I guess I'll thank him another ten thousand times because I can't hold Hallelujah every time I see her get up in the morning and come walking down the steps and I see her pick up a spoon I thank my God he opens eyes of the blood Hallelujah and he takes those in a wheelchair and makes him walk again and he raises the dead that's our God this morning [Applause] come on [Applause] Prophet said there was a time after a perfect life of 33 and a half years had been lived a man say I want you to understand this he saw brother he was anointed no no no the anointing left him in the garden he did not go to Calgary with a halo over his head he did not go to Calvary with a pillar of fire over his head he went to Calgary as the man the Bible said who in the days of his flesh not his anointing his flesh wanted to live as much as you and I want to live this morning a man who had something to live for he loved he loved the people he loved his disciples that sat around the campfire like we was doing yesterday at the restaurant just the time of Fellowship sitting around you know talking and laughing and just enjoying laughing he'd say Peter tell me a good fishing story Peter who don't like a good fishing story and I say Peter has some good news and they sit around and tell a big fish story oh they just laugh and slap each other and as I was laughing he would look upon their faces he would realize it's the only way the only way that they can live [Music] is I have to die it's the only way for the deal there's no other way probably said he loves sunsets he realized the only way his disciples could live the only way we could live was for him to die remember he spoke it in Prophecy he said hello all the world see me no more but ye shall see me because I live you shall live also he was the only man he was the only one who could fulfill that you see if he didn't do that that scripture would go unfulfilled no Organization no denomination no Pope no pastor it has to be healed he realized the only way they could ever gather together again as brothers was for him to die and to resurrect so they could follow in his steps Jesus father speaking to him now Satan and all this going on blood sweaters blood Fallen to the moment this momentous decision the Angels was waiting all he had to do was move a finger all he had to do was say I can't do it it's too great they would have turned the world upside down but they're in that moment of time when all this was going through and he was wrestling and out with his will he cries out not my will let the high will be done pretty steps to the will of the father and they come and arrest him all not long without water without food without rest they try him and they mock you and they slap him they took him from palatal and they tied him to a whipping post and they took these rods and they began to beat him across his naked back and those rods broke up the capillaries in his skin till it become bruised like brother Bo's foot bruised and then they took the Canon tail whip him on the back and those pieces of glass and pieces of bone and when they ripped it back like that it ripped his skin open and because the capillaries were all busted up the blood gushed from his back they beat him until they had to take turns because they got so tired you can see his kidneys through the wounds that was in his back stripe at the stripe after strife but the Bible says for the joy set before him he endured the cross Joy that's Joy Joy was eating that barbecue last night that was drill Joy Joy for the joy brother window what was on his mind what was he thinking as they whipped him at the whipping post prophet of God said that garment the blood from his body it just become one bloody garment slapping against his legs he made his way up Calvary and they throwed him down on the ground and they took this arm and they stretched it way back up and they nailed it to the tree and I took this one and I stretched it way back up and they nailed it to the tree and then they took his legs and crossed them and pushed them up on a platform and drove the nails to his feet and then they took ropes and they lifted him when it got so high he went and when it did Brother Bo off his bones come out of joint his shoulders dislocated his hips oh God I've been in surgery I've assisted doctors for years in surgery when I was a young man I've seen people come in with dislocated hips it's one of the most painful things you can ever experience and not one brother Davis both of his brother Colby and those at all all my bones I have a joint s they laugh at me they make fun of me they gave up on me with their mouths that's about me like dogs oh Jesus he was cut to pieces the Bible said his face was disfigured more than any man's face before you image oh I know Hollywood puts a little trickle of blood running down his face no my brother my sister his face was marked more than any man's face had ever been marked because remember Rome know how to crucify they knew oh my they knew how to bring the utmost punishment and they were crucified on the street out on the road so that when people passing through right they could see if this is what you do to Rome if this is what you do this is what happens if you come against Rome with his arms stretched out stretch the diaphragm and he smothered couldn't breathe so he would have to push up on the cross and when he pushed up it would relax his lungs and he could breathe he goes you go back down smother his mother [Music] laughs cut that down I said he was a man he died on Calvary for sacrifice bleeding and the blood running out of him like a mortal spit hanging all over his beard he was a man disgraced hanging in shame taking that place he was a man and when the pain got so great think about it when the pain got so great he cried out Eli lava suck back my God my God why is thou forsaken me oh what the hell so far from helping me hasty to help me oh I thought so far from helping me the Roar but the worst help me I'm dying yeah man who wanted to live the prophet I'm mad forsaken my God a curse hanging on a tree oh geez everything for sucking the creation that he created the moon the stars the sun everything blotted out man God nature everything forsook him nothing standing there he he died alone listen to me say to God there might have been days you felt so all alone there might have been days that you think I can't take another moment days when you felt no one cared for you no one loved you I guess all of uses have those kind of days but let me say to you this morning the worst day of our life has never been like this day has the stars ever forsaken us has the moon ever refused to sign for us has the sun ever refused to give its light but it did you God ever one time forsook us he said he wasn't by the window I'll never leave thee nor will I forsake thee no matter what we face in life we do not face it alone but he did he Wicked the calvary alone everything for sure what was he thinking how was he bearing the pain he labored so we could rest he suffered so we could be healed he died so he could live he was forsaken and you and I could have this promise I will never leave thee nor forsake thee he pushed upon the cross is my tongue he cleaveeth to my jaw you see there's a condition known as hypovolemic shock and hypovolemic shock is when your body loses so much fluid that the fluid that you have will go to the vital organs to keep you alive to go to your kidneys and to your liver into your heart into your brain it's the same thing when you brother son that's why we get cold in the morning our toes and our fingers because the heat of your body the core heat will go to the core of your body to keep you warm that's why our fingers and toes get cold and it's the same principle he lost so much fluid that the fluid went to keep them because you see he had life God gave him life like he gave us life and the fluid goes to keep the vital organs alive and his tongue his mouth was so dry and his tongue actually cleaved pushed up on the cross first I'm thirsty thirsty his body was dying and they ran and got vinegar on a sponge and they tried to give him a drink but he refused it oh my God the Bible said for the joy for him what Joy why was he willing to pay such a prize why was he willing to place the surprise I'm ready for somebody like me who am I that a king would bleed glory to God they not in the yard I gotta watch this shooting stars and I just raised my hands and I began to cry out I didn't care who hurt me I begin to cry out How Great Thou Art that I got to think Assad says there's billions and billions of stars and thousands upon thousands of galaxies that we've never even seen that they say exist and yet the Bible says our God created them all Bible says he knows every Star by name that God so great we've got to be someone like me you say before there was a world I loved you and I wrote your name in my book I was looking for you oh young people you see it maybe that's why you're here this morning yes he's come looking for you and all my failures thanks I'd be ashamed for you to even know that I ever done and all of that was worth thank you Glory for the joy brother dangerous for the joy what Joy could there be it's such a beating what Joy could there be in such agony why was he will Joy you see he looked forward in time you know what he saw he saw you happy he saw you free he saw you sitting here in church he saw you standing to your feet he saw you praising him and loving him he saw you changed he saw you healed he saw you free he saw you delivered he saw you restored he saw you redeemed do you realize what he saw do you understand what I'm telling you he saw he saw you and he said you're worth it for the joy of healing us he adored the whipping post for the joy of saving us he endured the shame the rejection the humiliation the pain the suffering Joy for the joy of hearing the shout of victory in the camp friends come on I don't understand how anyone could get upset because I get happy I want to yell thank you Jesus for what he did for my daughter you gotta understand how bad she was you've got to understand how bad she I worked in medicine I could read MRIs I could reseat these scares brother window I knew how bad she was and they want me to come to church and just oh come on and raise listen I'm not talking about a bunch of nonsense I'm not talking about a bunch of foolishness I'm just talking about loving to love him just talking about thanking him oh Hallelujah rejoicing for what he's done for me rejoicing but what has he ever done anything for you that in case you say thank you Jesus thank you [Applause] to hear the shout of Victory we are not a defeated people we are not a people that's been overcome Hallelujah We Are Victorious look at the back of the book we win [Applause] you know I think it's Florida I think I heard brother Andrew say it one time I saw it myself I think it's the Florida if I remember right you go so many places there's an Air Force Base down there that flies these fighter jets and when them things come over they rattled teacups in the cabinet so the people in the community got the complaining over the noise ain't too much noise around here I can't even sleep we'll sleep at home but no I know I know there's a preacher preaching one time he looked back there and the man was sleeping and he told the dick and said hey wake that man up the Dicker said you put him to sleep you wake him up anyway that's a different made myself laugh I'd say I've been guilty of that myself a few times he said I just too much noise around here we can't even rest so the Air Force put up a big sign at the entrance and it says pardon the noise but it's the sound freedom and I like to tell the devil this morning part of the noise but it's the sound of freedom in the camp hallelujah hallelujah it is a sound of freedom I was once bound but I'm free I was once dead but I'm alive it is the sound of freedom Hallelujah there we go the joy that was set before him Is Us our Salvation is the prize that made it all worthwhile that's why he was willing to suffer the shame so that we could make it into his kingdom he endured the cross he endured the cross so that we could be given eternal life this is the joy that was set before him that he could share the possession with us because remember we're not we're not just heirs we're joiners you see the difference between an heir and a joiner is if our daddy dies here we go for the reading of the will he gives Andrew the Cadillac with a spinning hubcaps he gives Ben the farm he gives Joel the hotel Up in Vegas and he gives me a goat and I have to feed that goat hey while Andrew drives off in that Cadillac now I'm on air I'm an heir I got something for my daddy but I didn't get what they got and the next three family reunion they'll hear about it I didn't get one thing I'm an heir but you see he didn't just make us heirs he made us join us and the Joiner means they oh my God they share The Possession together it means that whatever the father gave Jesus that's what he gave you [Applause] he died so that we could share in this inheritance together The Thirst in his heart could not be filled with water from a spring the only thing that would satisfy that that's why he didn't drink the vinegar it wouldn't satisfy it that thirst the whole book it was beyond the thirst of the flesh that he was longing for sunder hunger that he was longed for was her Fellowship and on that Resurrection morning he came forth oh in the joy for the Fulfillment of the word because when he came forth on that Resurrection morning he fulfilled the prophecy that he spoke back in John when he said because I live because I live For Whom the son that's me free it's free indeed every person here this morning can look and live coming down brother Andrews go pray I don't want to take his time tonight upon the cross it is finished and when he said those words brother boo down in hell all the prison cells of hell at once begin to burst open [Music] and the one who was held in the prison House of lust held in the prison House of addiction held in the prison House of cancer held in the prison House of arthritis all those who were held they could go free if this was manifested the love of God towards us because God sent his only son his only begotten son into the world that we might live through here you thought I was worth saving so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you cleaned me up inside you thought I was worth dying for so you sacrificed your life so I could be free so I could be whole so that I could tell Hardy Arkansas everyone I know he thought he thought I don't care what they think of me at Walmart I don't care what to come off somebody me and my wife went to Walmart here not long ago listen to me sisters I want to say something to you this morning I want to thank you for dressing modest and decent and like I he said brother the world thinks I'm so ugly but he thinks you're beautiful [Applause] there's a there's a girl with 15 different colored hair and a big ring through her nose Tony looked at my wife like she was crazy I was in Atlanta airport the other day and a guy came through the airport with a black cape from the top of his ears to his feet he was walking like Dracula and people was looking at him he's getting upset I thought what do you think I mean I'm eating Chick-fil-A and you just go I seen a guy have his entire head tattooed even the whites of his eyes and they think we're weird when he died so that we could be free you see he loved life the prophet said he loves sunsets he loved to sit around the campfire but he come to that realization the only way I could ever have this Fellowship again is I have to die you see Jesus I'm closer he never had but once to close but he never asked the father for a new suit oh my God how many do I have in my closet yeah he walked everywhere he went but brother Chris he never asked the father for a chariot one time you say Lord could you just give me a charity I could just make it down there this summer he never asked the father for a new suit he never asked the father for a chariot the Bible said he had no place to lay his head you know we did he never asked the father or a house but the only thing that he ever asked the father for the only thing that could satisfy that thirst was your fellowship he wanted to be one with you and for the joy have it our fellowship restored he endured the cross and said I was in Chi back Alaska I think I've told this before but it just comes on my mind it's one of those things you just never forget brother Wendell I know you've your brothers have experiences as a young girl came up in chivac Alaska 21 year old she said brother Daryl I'm an alcoholic she said I have tried everything to quit drinking and I cannot stop drinking she said I've been through the non-step program three different times and I stay sober for a while and then I find myself drunk again she's like a little boy I don't even know who the daddy is because I was drunk she started crying she said I've tried everything to quit drinking I cannot stop drinking and I said sis have you tried Jesus I said you just lay your alcohol right here at the feet of Jesus and you take his freedom and you walk out free you see sometimes we complicate it so hard if you'll only believe all things are possible amen and I begin to pray for that young girl I'll never forget it as long as I live I begin to pray for her and she began to scream it wasn't a nod it wasn't waving she was screaming from the top of her lungs I'm free I'm free I'm free yeah oh thanks of God I got this morning today every one of us is free the prison doors have been opened you can step out free this morning he made the price for you it's already been paid oh do you love him this morning he looked through time you know what he saw he saw you happy he saw you free he saw you serving him and loving him said you're worth it you thought I was worth saving so you came and changed my life you thought I was worth keeping so you clean me up inside you thought I was to die for so you decide could fast your life so I could be free so I could be oh so I could tell everyone I know you thought I was worth saving do you believe that this morning amen it's about our heads friend you say brother dial you just preaching on Calvary working on her emotion no I'm not interested in your emotion but I pray that my heart never becomes so calloused that Calvary gate touches I'm so glad that God can squeeze my heart and the juice comes out my eyes oh friend this morning can you see can you really see your worth [Music] what he's done for you can you this morning but now what do I got to do just step out of that prison house step out of that there's a lamp provided to support it you could go free only father Heavenly Father thank you Lord for Calvary thank you Lord for bearing my shame thank you for bearing my sins Lord and remove them as far as the East is from the West that I could stand here this morning Lord and say I've never done it in the first place it's dropped beneath the bleach of your blood never to be remembered against us anymore and father I pray Lord if there'd be one here maybe they've drifted God oh God maybe they've let the things of the world and their problems get bigger than their God they've lost that feeling Lord they've lost that feeling towards you they just kind of go through the motions just wondering how much longer is it going to be for we can get out but Lord if Calvary spoke to him this morning I wonder if they'd be willing to lay that aside I'd be willing if they would be willing to do what you did that day of the garden when you prayed not my will but let thy will be done Lord let there be one here this morning who say father I want your will for my life Lord I've got these Ambitions to be this to be there to be something else but father today lord it's not what I want it's not what I [Music] can do for me but it's what you've done for me Lord and if you're here this morning baby you've never accepted Christ as your savior maybe you've never heard it preached like this I I don't know I I ain't no kind of a Preacher friends but if somehow I convey to you how much he loves you and you can see that if he was the only person that was ever lost in Hardy Arkansas ever lost in the history of humanity he would have died for you but can you receive that kind of Love sometimes it's the hardest thing for people to do is to receive love but can you accept that someone loved you that much and I wonder if you would just raise your hand up to him and say father [Music] Lord I received that this morning God bless that hand all over the building if you're here and you've got code on the Lord why don't you just renew that Fellowship this morning do you see the joy you see the joy as you raise your hand to him as the tears run down your eyes I wonder if you don't look over at the angels and say it was worth it it was worth it to see them look at them look at them raising their heads look at them crying this morning look at them singing songs of praise for the joy he said because I live you shall live also Hallelujah [Music] amen if you're here this morning how many has a need in their body either he stripes on his back for your healing I wonder this morning if you could just lay that problem down and take his healing just thank him for it you see here not long ago I was in a restaurant [Music] and I asked the waitress for the bill and she said if there's nothing else the Bill's been paid for said someone saw you in here and they paid for your meal and I looked around I didn't see anyone now I could do one or two things I could have argued with her and I could have told her ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know you must have the wrong table you must be talking about somebody else they ain't nobody paid my bill for me I could have sat there and argued tried to do it myself trying to pay it myself or I could accept the fact that someone bumped that steak for me and you know what I did I accepted that and I walked out with a belly full of steak and it's the same principle this morning the price has already been paid it's already been paid you can argue you can debate well I don't know if it's for me or not oh it's for you you can argue about it you can say oh oh it's just it's just or or you can accept what he did for you this morning and walk out that door free so here's what I want us to do this morning just lay hands on one another the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe now listen to me I don't want you to say a prayer I want you to pray for that person you got your hand on I want you to pray from the depths of your heart that they can receive that dead Calvary maybe it's your daughter your husband your wife your your brother your sister [Music] in your prayer I'm not stand between them in an accident and let the Holy Spirit flow through you this morning would you do it that flow through me Holy Spirit meet that need of that person would you pray with me to hell Heavenly Father thou who has raised Christ from the grave and sent the promise of the Holy Ghost into the hearts of your children we bow into a great presence this morning we thank you dear God for Calvary we thank you Lord for what you have done for us you are our healer you are our sustainer you are our flame you're the keeper of our soul Hallelujah you're our friend you're our bridegroom you're our physician you are all in all and this morning God we look to you the author and finisher of our faith and God I lay my hand upon my brother and upon my sister this morning and I say to Satan you're Defeated come out of them this morning leave them for the glory of God oh Father may they receive that day of Calvary may they receive what you've done for them this morning I ask whatever sickness let every fear let every Spirit of depression let high blood low blood no blood arthritis sugar diabetes oh God whatever it would be this morning mental trouble physical trouble financial trouble marital trouble whatever it would be this morning I pray in the name of Jesus Christ by the save anointing that raised my Lord from the grave by that same anointed that gave Jessica back to me where that same anointed this morning move upon the hearts of your people dear God and loose them dear God on that day of Calvary it loosed us the prisoner doors are open and we can go free today granted this morning I received the god I received it Lord I receive what you did for me that day in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God for the glory of God Hallelujah Hallelujah do you love him amen amen Hallelujah isn't he wonderful this morning are you hungering for him today there's a
