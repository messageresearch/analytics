gospel but by Your Word Lord we we now can live by your spirit moving and living through us you manifest yourself in us we're so thankful for that today Lord we don't want to pass up this opportunity to make you King tonight or to elevate you to the highest place and Lord to place you there and know or that you you deserve to be there or we don't deserve to be where you put us but Lord we put you in the highest place tonight Lord you have the preeminence in this service I pray you continue to do that Lord move me out of the way and speak directly to the people we pray in Jesus name amen amen second Kings chapter 5 and verse 1. Second Kings 5 and 1 about preach me to death this morning so we'll try to get through this tonight and maybe try to close quickly but the Lord knows what we need do you believe that tonight he always knows what we need good to see each and every one of you with us tonight and those that are watching that had to go home I know where the Allen had to leave this morning got sick and so let's be praying for him and his family and each one the devil always fights always fights to keep us out of the house of God why because we have the potential yeah and we're Sons and Daughters of the king and so we learned about that this morning so the devil's going to fight our families going to fight our homes we're going to fight this church gonna fight other churches of Believers but we have the victory we've already won the victory through Christ Our Redeemer he won it for us and so we have to believe that tonight Second Kings 5 and 1 it says now Naaman captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given Deliverance unto Syria he was also a mighty man in Valor but he was a leper and the syrians had gone out by companies and brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on naaman's wife and she said unto her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria I love the faith of the little maid for he would recover him of his leprosy I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I'd like to speak to you for just a few minutes tonight on a topic of surrounded somewhere in Israel during the days of Elisha there was a little maid and those words little made are significant or they are they they mean a lot because it actually means small young unimportant and the root of it is insignificant we don't know her name she was so small and Unworthy of recognition maybe she was about the age of one of these young ladies sitting here in the front just a little maid and she was taken away from her family I can see her as she was brought away from her family and the people that she loved everything that she knew everything that she was and and they take her away by night and and and the band of syrians that took her can imagine her laying there with her hands bound and her feet bound she's laying by the fire and she's listening to them talk about how they killed her family and how they destroyed because they were a tool in the hands of God to bring judgment on Israel at that time and she laid there by herself and it must have been a lonely place it must have been a place where she felt like that she was completely surrounded by the by the enemy she she had nobody there to help her mom and dad were a long ways away perhaps dead at that time all of her family all the structure all the temple all the things of God that they had in Israel at that time it was all gone and she didn't have nothing she was being carried away a captive carried against her will a captive in Australia Strange Land and I think sometimes all of us feel like that we're surrounded by things beyond our control we're just covered up by problems covered up by circumstances of life and we're listening to the Devils that are surrounding us many times bragged about what they've done to our families and our friends and we feel that way we're surrounded by school surrounded by work surrounded by Family sometimes surrounded by trouble the word in the King James version is compassed compassed about when you see that in the King James it means to be surrounded but it's not just to be surrounded but for the enemy to be going around and around around the perimeter so to be compassed about with armies is when when the enemy would March around like they did at Jericho and go around and around and constantly making their presence known right and I'd just be honest with you sometimes that's the way I feel as a Christian and laodicea today we feel like we're surrounded by enemies right you feel like you're by yourself when you go but the Bobby if you go to work and you and you realize that there's not very many people live like we do not very many people love God the way that we do and they don't understand and then there's some good people out there but but the world for the most part has gone insane can I get an amen on that tonight it's gone completely and totally insane and so our children go to school and we wonder how will they ever make it through school our families we look at if they if we homeschool them but yet you have to get them out in the world to go to work and when they reach a certain age what are you going to do when they reach when they leave your home they turn 18 and you feel like they're out there on their own and there ain't no way to help him there ain't no way and and there's no way to look but they're surrounded by their enemies but sometimes it has to be this way so we can see who God really is so he can reveal himself to us job felt surrounded by his friends that should have come and and helped him should have come and offered a kind word or an encouraging word and they were constantly telling him he'd done something wrong he was a secret sinner in job 16 and 10 he said they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have submit me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against me it's like being on Facebook they're just gathered they're ganging up on me and they're constantly telling me I must be a secret sinner or I wouldn't be going through this but job knew that there was a sacrifice that he had made listen to me tonight you be sure and know that there's a sacrifice that you have made amen Hallelujah sacrifice has been made for you I'm glad for that tonight and he said they've gathered themselves together against me God hath delivered me to the ungodly turn me over into the hands of the wicked I was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he's also taken me by the neck look at this graphic language he said he's taken me by the neck and shaken me to pieces set me up for his Mark so it's like I was God's Target and God marked off his space and set me at 50 yards and started shooting arrows at me yeah he felt surrounded persecuted he cleaveeth my Reigns asunder does not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground David Felt This Way many times look at Psalm 22 when he was being hunted by King Saul he prayed and he cried out to God said be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help you imagine that little girl feeling that way there is none to hell many bulls have compassed me strong bull salvation have beset me around they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion he said I'm poured out like water all my bones are out of joint my heart is like waxing is melted in the midst of my bowels my strength is dried up like a puncture oh can you enter in with him and realize the situation he was in he didn't even know he was speaking of the future of him amen he said my tongue cleaveeth to my jaws I was brought me to the dust of death for dogs have come past me the Assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me they part my garments among them cast lost upon my vesture he said but be thou not far from me O Lord O my strength Hast thee to help me completely surrounded by enemies don't you know that's how Jesus felt on the cross let's just picture that for a moment I know this is simple tonight but it ought to bring something to us and make us realize where we're at and and how we should feel about what he did for us he was completely surrounded by enemies his friends all left him they left him there to die alone brother Brandon put it this way he said Yonder on the hill when they laid him down pulled his precious hands back those hands that stood to fever he said that hands that said to the poor widows woman's boy when it touched his brow the casket he was laying and he came to life those same hands you think well I should be rewarded for doing good look what he got for laying his hands on the sick they pierced his hands Oh my he said that same those same hands that said to the poor widow woman's boy would touch the casket he was laying and he come to life that one who called Dorcas back to life that one who called jairus's daughter to life that one who said Lazarus come forth them lips are bleeding now parching crying as the great cruel Nails driving to his hands in his feet they pierced my hands and my feet said the prophet 700 years before it happened what was it it was Abel's lamb said they flung him down in the ground in the flesh tore his poor body quivered and said I thirst they give him vinegar they riled and mocked and made fun of him and said you great miracle worker do something about it now but then the Skies begin to get dark lightning began to flash God was hiding his face and that's sometimes when we feel most surrounded by our enemies is when it seems like God pulled away from us and his absence is felt but I want you to know tonight that he give you a promise that you would never be left alone he said I'll be with you always I'll be with you always he was left alone so we wouldn't have to be yeah amen and when you get all by yourself and you feel like nobody can feel your pain nobody knows what you're going through it's at that moment that you know he's been there he knows what you're going through he's a great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity yes amen they riled and mocked and made fun of him said you great miracle worker do something about it now the Skies begin to get dark lightning begin to flash God was hiding his face he couldn't stand it no more oh God how cruel sin must be he said how cruel how cruel that caused that precious one to do that even such a price he paid until God himself hid his face the Angels failed their faces and turned around oh God to weeping with him they were there but they couldn't do anything about it and so they turned around they couldn't take it they turned their faces from him God turned his face from him oh I know we've all suffered but we've never suffered like that Oh my he said even such a price he paid till God himself hit his face the Angels veiled their faces and turned around the moon and the stars could not go any farther they could not shine no more the very God that created them was dying on the cross and he bowed his head before he did that he looked down there to them people gambling for His Garment to fulfill what the prophet said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing I hope we haven't gotten so cold that it doesn't mean anything to us anymore the love of Jesus talk about it in church but it becomes so common until we can sit and it don't mean anything anymore but he said now father forgive him they don't know what's All for Love like that I want to be that kind of a that kind of a character I want the spirit of Christ to express himself in me until I can be reviled and reviled not again father they don't know what they're doing all in love Adam slam God's provided Lamb slain from the foundation of the world there he died friendless completely surrounded by his enemies friendless even forsaken by God himself God he said and then his own father Forsaken and bleeding yeah we go around laughing again he's just like nothing had happened he said oh God it was that blood when was the last time you thought about this church it was that blood when Yonder in the hospital the doctor said he's dying it was that blood that healed me a little old sitter boy running around here it was that blood that forgive my sins right oh aren't you glad for that blood tonight it's that blood that heals me today it's that blood That Forgives me it's that blood that lets me stand here today and preach to you that blood that did it oh my it was that blessed taking me out of a debatable place that I was living and sent me and made your son oh poor dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood Keep Me Near The Cross Lord he said that's my vision that's what it is Yonder love all God's Great heart moving down there and all that comes by him will not be rejected they'll all receive everlasting life he that cometh to me he said I will in no wise cast out well the Branham says those things at the end of a sermon called the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it cost to rid Sin from our lives what an amazing title surrounded by his enemies he said father forgive them I want you to notice the attitude of the little maid she said to her mistress would God my Lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria he would recover him of his leprosy we don't know what happened to the girl in between we don't know how she was treated but somehow she had such a character and there's a reason for that our kids that don't just automatically happen but kids that are raised in the right atmosphere the kids that are have parents that care about them that provide a nice home a happy home as the prophet said kids that that have parents that care about them they tend to they tend to go to this place and when they're in struggles and they may be in trials they may be carried away even by Satan but there will be a testimony there as we said before there'll be some place they can go back to a home that they can go back to amen well that's what we want to provide for our children but the random put it this way he said they had a little girl there he said I want to show you the force of a testimony of a child who lived in a nation or perhaps a family who was under the influence of God you realize children your your testimony has Force your testimony has Force here was the little child one of you children one of you young people I should say wrote notes had notes I don't know big notes I got it there in my office we found it somewhere outside one of you made notes you made good notes by the way about the sermon that preached Wednesday night we were going over those notes and thinking about that what a testimony that is that a child even can understand some of that stuff was pretty deep it was pretty pretty much dig down deep in the message but you were understanding it writing it down and I thought my goodness we would think that these kids wouldn't even understand it but there's a force of a testimony of a child who lived in a nation and perhaps a family who was under the influence of God horse we just could repeat it over and over again but as we said we want to keep them hide them in the house of the Lord hide them in your family make sure you keep them in the in the presence of God she loved her master and her mistress they took her away they destroyed everything she knew she could have hated them she should have hated them and look how Christ shines through that little child even before Christ was ever here but we see Christ in every verse of the Bible here's a little child who's taken captive by her parents and she's all alone can you imagine being all alone family by yourself in a place where there's there's no help and there's nobody there and yet you learn to love instead of hate you you learn to you learn to care for the people that you were taking and it seems phenomenal that it could be but she was raised right she was under the influence of the supernatural we'll find that in just a moment he said now she loved her master and her mistress so when she seen Naaman probably a good-hearted good-natured man he said as far as we know according to history Elijah never healed a man with Leprosy there's never been a leper case healed in his day but the little girl being raised and brought up under the influence over in Israel yet an alien she was conducting herself as a believer oh my oh I want to raise children like that I want to see young ones come up like that they may be surrounded but they're under the influence not just children but but church members people that if you say well I go to Word of Life Tabernacle I go to some other church but but it could be a representation not of that church but of the of the actions of Christ that if I find myself surrounded by enemies I'll still Reach Out In Love I'll still say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing amen he had an alien she was conducting herself as a believer he said and that's the way we should do all the time is conduct ourselves no matter what our position is conduct ourselves as Believers ready at all times to give an answer for the hope that lieth within your brother random talks about the slave was taken and he was the son of a king but they didn't know it but they began to watch him and he said when the slave trader come by I begin to watch him he said I want to buy that one he said he's not for sale he said well what makes him so different does he eat differently do you treat him differently he said no he said it's just that I found out that over in Africa he was the son of a king and so he still holds his head high he still conducts himself though he's a slave he conducts himself as the son of the king or how that ought to be you and I tonight though we're in laodicea now we're in many ways we're surrounded by enemies yet we ought to feel like Sons and Daughters of the king we ought to conduct ourselves as believers brother random said how much that ought to be to the Christian church this morning what a challenge what a challenge can you say Amen to that on a three o'clock service in the afternoon what a challenge hey man what a challenge no matter what other men do and what those who profess Christianity does we must walk as Sons and Daughters of the king our morale should be wonderful amen oh that ought to I told him I wasn't going to preach at you tonight somebody told me he said give us a little bit of balm for all them wounds foreign but we got to walk your sons and daughters of the king our morale should be wonderful oh we're not we're not in the gloom and doom the Risen sign has dispelled the Gloom our morale should be wonderful we should never act as the world or live with the world we should keep our courage High knowing this that we are aliens we don't care about the world and what they think we are aliens pilgrims and strangers but someday brother JP we're going home do you believe that tonight someday we're going home amen he said we're at this time we're pilgrims this little lady was that type she said to her mistress she said I would God that my Lord name it was over in my country for we have a prophet over there that could heal him of his leprosy he said oh my how God used that child how did she know he said the same thing I was talking on last night inspiration from the very atmosphere oh my she was under such an atmosphere under the influence of such an atmosphere of the supernatural at home her parents must have believed in miracles they went to a church are you hearing me today that believed in miracles people that believed in the moving of the spirit of God and because amen her parents believed in Miracles and her church believed in Miracles when she was taken out of by captivity into another land she still was influenced by that under the influence of that atmosphere she received inspiration and when she received inspiration she spoke the word of God huh now there might be some things in your life that you never run across in the scripture might be some disease or or some trial or something they didn't have to deal with certain things that we deal with today and so there's things that you maybe you don't see a direct analogy to that in scripture but if you're under the influence of the right atmosphere and the inspiration of God you can actually speak the right things oh my I know I'm Healed because he said I'm the god that heals all your diseases no matter what they name I know I'm saved I know they may not have to deal with the internet but I know I'm an overcomer of of all of these things are you with me tonight because I'm under inspiration from that atmosphere he said now notice that child under inspiration was led to say those words we don't know if Elijah ever healing anyone else and maybe no one else no matter how many he prayed for oh God she said I would to God my Lord was over with my country my country we have a prophet yeah now watching this uh Elijah there never been a leper that we know of in the Old Testament healed until Naaman and he wasn't even a Christian as we would say today he was but she said my God oh my he's so powerful that if I'm at work and somebody asks for prayer I still believe God's A Healer if I'm at school and somebody asks for prayer I still believe that God's A Healer why because I'm under the atmosphere of the influence and the inspiration of God sir amen he said notice that child was under that atmosphere and so he said and led to say those words he said oh if we could say that now watch she said I would to God that my Lord was over with my country in my country we have a prophet he said oh if we could say that about our churches today I'm preaching the Word of Life Tabernacle now oh that we could say that about our churches today I want God that you could come under the influence that I live under and my church lives under for we believe that God Is A Healer do you believe that today we believe God is the savior we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit and I would God you lived in my country because we have a church where they still lay on hands we have a church where they still believe in healing we have a people I believe the message people ought to be that way I know there's a God in our midst there may be problems but there's a God who solves those problems I want God you lived in my country now she didn't go back and say well you know the preachers are not very because that's not what she heard yeah yeah that's not the atmosphere she was under gossip and a bunch of you with me now talking down about people all the time that's not the atmosphere she was under she was under an atmosphere that could bring inspiration she said my church is the best Church uh we have a prophet how do you believe that today you can talk bad about the message all you want to but I would God you were in my country I look out at the world surrounding us I look out with the people without hope and I look at them and some of them don't know if they're a boy or a girl or a man or woman or a cow or a pig or whatever it is that they are when they don't even know what side of the fence they belong what God you were in my country because we had a Prophet come in our day to set those things right just shine light on the word of God show us where we live at hey man I'm about to kill myself I haven't preached this sermon in 20 years as fresh and I had 20 years ago I believe he's still God today oh God that I would to God you could come under this influence I live under and my church lives under for we believe God Is A Healer we believe that God is a savior we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit I went to God you lived in my country we can condemn people and look down on people but we're the god you lived in my country just come to church come under that atmosphere things will change if you sit under it long enough that there's a seed of God there things will change she had that testimony in those circumstances now look now look at me church we are not surrounded by enemies we may think we are but we are not actually surrounded by enemies now there was prophet Elisha as he was the one that Naaman received healing by going and dipping seven times then in the muddy Jordan but that same Prophet was there one day and and the Syrian King was wondering why are we always having problems why why is it that uh we can't ever have a real victory in Israel and the reason was because Elisha was in the land and Elisha was was taking the words that were spoken in the king's bed chamber and going over and telling them to the king of Israel and so he had a problem he had a spy that wasn't even in the country so they actually marched down you think when the enemies against you why is he against you because you're doing something right yeah so the enemy come against the prophet Elisha and they marched down and surrounded the city that he was in listen the way to protecting Kings puts it and he said go Inspire where he is that I may sin and fetch him he was told him saying behold he is in Dothan he said therefore said he they're their horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and come past the city about for one man surrounded it and when the servant of the man of God was risen early gone forth Behold a host come past the city both with horses and chariots and his servants said unto him alas my master how shall we do huh that's the Doom and Gloom of a person that doesn't hasn't pierced the Veil are you with me now he can't see there's more with us than be with him we all get that way sometimes by the way because we live in the flesh which is the Veil we all get that way but here the servant will stand there and saying what are we going to do oh preachers are fighting with one another churches or splitting people are leaving the message what are we going to do people are having problems what are we going to do people got sin in their lives what are we going to do they're it's all around us oh we just pull back and sit down and wait for the end to come run off in a cave somewhere like Elijah did and God told him he said there's more than what you think there is but Elisha had a revelation oh my that the servant didn't have he said what are we going to do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and Elisha prayed said Lord I pray thee open his eyes open his eyes said he may see or if you're surrounded by trouble today if you're surrounded by enemies he was surrounded so you wouldn't have to feel that way you wouldn't have to feel like there's no hope you wouldn't have to feel like there's no way to have peace no way to have comfort no way for that cloud of depression to leave your life you wouldn't have to feel that way he would surrounded by enemies and and so we would not have to be look he said fear not they're more with us than be with him well I should pray Lord I open his eyes he may see and the Lord Open the Eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the chair the mountain was full yeah I don't know how many that the king of Syria brought but it wasn't enough amen whatever the amount was Elisha knew that God wouldn't sin the smaller Army oh I hope you hear me today he says hello to see you it's a bad place it's a bad condition yes it is but God will not have a smaller Army of angels with us amen then there are demons against us listen to me there was 200 million demons released from the Euphrates River 200 Millions released on the bride in an epic communical mood to try to come against the bride but whatever their number is it is not enough hallelujah oh that ought to be shouting ground tonight it is not enough oh god there are more with us than be with them remember it's always true Elisha didn't have to go out and count them he didn't have to go out and say one two three four five hundred thousand a million he didn't have to do that what was he doing he knew that God would be would provide a sufficient Army Glory more than enough oh God age of the Lord now watch the Lord opened his eyes the mountain was full of horses Chariots of Fire around about Elisha oh my watch the servant saw syrians Elisha saw angels now in Psalm 34 7 the Bible tells us that the angel of the Lord in campus in campus now we know the angel of the Lord is Christ that's in the Old Testament Angel of the Lord is Christ but now there's angels in camping because he brings his armies with him to encamp and brother Brown said that don't mean go back and forth right like the in the encompassing people that can pass around the city but they're encamped that means therefore our defense right and it says the angel of the Lord in campus round about them that fear Him and delivereth them now brother Brandon said when God opened his spiritual sight all around there he said the prophet stood Chariots of Fire and angels of fire he said why the Chariots of Fire outnumbered that Syrian Army by the thousands now think about it God had more than enough amen when we needed Grace he said Grace abounded if you go back and look at the original Super abounded when when it bounded more the Bible says about and more When sin abounded Grace Super abounded oh my when the when the when the demons come from the Euphrates River God sends an army of Chariots of Fire the Bible said the angels of God he said in Camp about those who fear Him He said just the same tonight yes I wonder if we can believe it tonight yeah yeah he said I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight had the power to strike across your eyes and say look standing around this Tabernacle tonight you don't know what you're doing when you come to church oh God you don't realize you're bringing my angels and his angels and your angels and they're all gathering in one place because I got them in camping around me he's got them and camping around him they're in one place oh god oh you thought it was just another church service no it's a Convention of angels there might be 50 people in the church service 30 people in the church it doesn't matter there's a Convention of angels because around each one of those servants there's hundreds maybe thousands of angels he said I wonder what would happen if you could see them standing around the Tabernacle tonight he said you would be a member here the rest of your life oh God you just think that look to your own church or to our church I want to believe that be real hard to miss a service if you knew there was an angel convention going on Angels sitting all out in the foyer we're not exciting to have that meeting everybody's people sitting out in the foyer man that made my heart feel good I wish I I want that to be every service or just save people out off the street and bring them in let that be every service but I'll tell you what there's more than them right now there's more than the seats or fall the building is full and you say well the devil's here yes he is but the angels of God are here and they position themselves between the devil and thus between the devil and his you know and God's people he positions he encamps angels oh my he said sometimes you can't see it with your natural eyes you can feel the impulse of it something near a sixth sense that denotes something is near brother Brandon talked about going to certain places he said I hope I'm not superstitious if I am I don't know it he said but then when you go into these places where they have amusements and gambling and dances it just looks to me like they're just little Devils sitting around everywhere he said they're just kind of a habitation for them they just stay there and then you got to go in he said take about five nights to preach them all out he said you know before you can get the meeting started but in the church house amen oh that's where we're at tonight in the church house I believe the angels of God and Camp around because of saints gathered there it's a noted place for God all people may not like it today they may not want to come to church people may say well we don't need it no more we'll just sit at home and play a tape or stream some other service but in the church house he said there's angels and camping around because Saints Gathering there it's a noted place for God where he comes and meets with his people who am I said but brother Ben I can't see them there's a reason for that look at Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 17. we'll take this and then we'll close it says we're in God willing more abundantly to show unto The Heirs of promised immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for God to lie I love that impossible we might have a strong consolation who have fled for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul well he's not talking about the kind of hope that only say well I hope I get healed that's not the kind of hope he's talking about that kind of hope is the enemy of Faith but this is expectation so we have this expectation as an anchor of the Soul when you feel it when you don't feel it the Anchor's still there right we have this hope as an anchor of the Soul both sure and steadfast which inrth now watch into that within the Veil it entereth into that within the veil in the veil he said the but the brown said and he's talking about this in the Hebrew series he said the veil is the flesh the veil is what keeps us from seeing God face to face in this church oh I'm not just saying these things these things are true now think about the veil our flesh can you imagine you know somebody ever sees an angel I don't doubt that they do many people sometimes I have a dream or a vision or see an angel but if they ever did you heard about it most of the time people will tell that story yeah I I saw an angel oh God because when they see it they believe it but now we can't we don't see Angels today why don't we see them because there's a veil there called the flesh we don't see him he said but it's the only thing that keeps us from seeing God face to face in his church it's just as real as if we could see him right now watch can you imagine if you went home today and you went and told your neighbors and told everybody put it on Facebook the angels of God were camped around us tonight we had a service where there was Angels Chariots of Fire well they were around this side they were camping you realize what they are they're around every part every person in the church now watch he he said here they were all around the church and you go home and you'd write about it you'd call your neighbors you'd say you know what there were Angels everywhere an angel convention all over the place and we shouted and we spoke with tongues and we cried and we well we'd have church wouldn't we yeah they're here maybe I should have preached this before you got so tired they're here yeah brother Brown said the Veil is what keeps us from seeing the Angels at their positions this morning standing by feet yes brother Branham when he was in that debate with the Baptist man he actually didn't he attended the debate he wasn't the one debating he was debating with Dr debating with Dr Bosworth was when the picture of the pillar of fire was taken over his head he's in that debate and he's standing there or he's sitting there in the back and they call him up to come pray and that's when the angel a picture of the Angel of the Lord is taken of the pillar of fire and at that time brother Brown tells the story he said there's hundreds of ushers lying the aisles but Rebecca Branham was there went to church that night with her dad and she said we didn't see no ushers he looked like he was walking down the aisle by himself and a prophet of God I I'm just crazy enough to believe there was angels and he let the pillar of fire be shown and taken a picture of it but he was always with him he wasn't just with him when they took a picture of it brother said he's standing here right now not three feet from where I'm at right now don't you realize he did not just promise that for prophets but he said if you could look Beyond the Veil of Flesh you'd see Angels standing here an angel standing here an angel standing over here what is it the angels of the Lord didn't come and Camp around those that fear God that's right I wish I could impress on you that's so real what keeps you from seeing them what keeps you from being in the presence of the Lord when you go to church the veil that's right the Veil the flesh oh my he said we are hid behind the veil and that Veil is the flesh we are Sons and Daughters of God we're in the presence of God the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him we're in the presence of God hey all the time you mean when I'm at home yes when I'm at church yes when I'm just at church there's a whole bunch of them together but when you're at home you still have your angels encamped about you when you're in school your angels are still encamped about you when you're wherever you're at whatever you're doing that's why I'm not scared that God won't have a bride God has a big enough Army to produce a bride in this time a big enough influence in this age he did not send a prophet for no reason you can preach Doom and Gloom if you want to but I believe there's somebody that's going to make it somebody's gonna make it somebody's gonna have Godly children somebody's gonna have a church on fire for God why we we may be hid behind the veil but if we can see there's Angels at their positions we're in the presence of God all the time he said I'll never leave thee neither will ever forsake thee I'll be with thee always even unto the end but the veil is the flesh that's what keeps us out of his presence but through the soul of the Spirit by our faith we know he's watching us he's standing by us here now if I could press through the Veil that Veil kept him hidden he appeared in many ways in the Old Testament but he was hidden for what he really was come down as a baby in a Manger veiled himself once again in flesh all that what God was poured himself into a baby brother said it was little Jehovah crying in the manger he veiled himself in that and he lived and he walked on the earth and many people didn't understand because the flesh hit him but those who understood like the woman at the well she said when Messiah comes he's supposed to do these things he said I'm he and she ran into the City and said there's a messiah in town the son of man is revealed himself she was sure it was him because she could see the eyes of face she could see behind the veil but he walked through this Earth and and then he went to if you go and read the rest I don't have time today but if you read in that Hebrew series but the brown talks about how that Christ when he died and he rose again on the third day he said he he is he ascended he said and then descended to give gifts unto men he said and when he ascended he said he broke all the Gloom that covered over the Earth he said he broke the veil of the flesh oh God oh God all the Risen Christ broke the veil he said he broke the veil of depression are you struggling with depression today he broke the veil of depression he broke through the veil and if you could just get past your own Veil get past that if you could just get in the spirit of God in the presence of God under the right atmosphere you'd begin to speak words of inspiration why because you're not only surrounded by enemies but you're surrounded by angels and the angels are between you and your enemies you can't fail any more than God could fail Hallelujah see behind it tonight if we can press through enough and this is a real problem in the world that we live in he broke through the veil LED captivity captive and they could see it was him I think musicians would come tonight and I'm going to close I wonder if we could press through the Veil oh my God that's the presence of the Lord is here if you close your eyes with me sometimes you got to shut out the things of the world shut out the movies you've been watching shut out the news even sometimes shut out the chatter people talking about you said things just shut it out let go of it let go of the bitterness and the pain it's the flesh that's the Veil seeing angels huh but if you could just Reach Out by faith now I don't say you might see them physically I don't say that you can't but how much greater would it be if you didn't see him with these eyes but with the eyes of Faith see I know Lord your word is true I might feel all by myself maybe you're a young lady you feel all by yourself I feel like a kid's at school and the kids at work or even the home they don't understand you nobody really knows who you are but you're surrounded tonight if you could just reach out let your faith reach out just you bump into them over here and over here everywhere you're surrounded you can't go nowhere David says wither can I flee from thy presence he said if I go to hell behold Thou Art there if I take the wings of the morning fly Beyond this oceans you're there everywhere around you why don't you just surrender to him tonight Lord I believe I believe let me look past my circumstances let me look past my what I've been going on what's been going on in my life lately and I'll be like that little girl who was in a foreign country felt like I've never been this place before sometimes you feel like that don't you I've never been here before I've never had this this kind of problems maybe your kids got sick and your parents are are fighting or you're or your family's all in a plus I've never been here before I don't know what it's like I don't know how to handle it but I know I'm surrounded by angels I know I can feel his presence if I could just get behind the veil that's the problem of our age if we could just get through that Veil and break through we can see God's just as real as he ever was just as able to bring Revival but lay able to see her rejected him this nation rejected him but you don't have to you're the Bride of Jesus Christ look Beyond the Veil tonight and see Angels at their position comforting Angels Angels bringing joy and present and peace and long-suffering Angels coming to serve you to war for you oh my well I'm just crazy enough to believe it tonight why don't we just press through that Veil tonight and see Angels at their position at every pew oh Lord I pray you would do it tonight open our eyes oh God May our spiritual eyes be open until we can see we see what's on the news we see what's in the world that we're living in we see the problems we see people falling away but oh God it you could help us see beyond that today I can see angels I see Supernatural things working on my behalf supernatural beings working in my family I see my healing I see salvation for my children I see things the world can't see because I know it's true and even when I don't feel their presence I know that if I can just get through the veil of Flesh they'll be there because the angel of the Lord never leaves oh God help us to believe it tonight help us to take you at your word Lord and stand with faith and Assurance knowing that you are near I thank you for these people or they waited patiently on Sunday afternoon I pray you'd reveal your angels to him or in some way if it's only or just a a sense of your presence if we believe you Lord we know we can feel you we can it's not about the feeling but Lord sometimes we get weary we get like Elijah we run from God and your Prophet told us that you had an angel with soft hands to touch the brow of Elijah and an angel that knew how to cook to cook him a meal I pray that it would be so today may we see Angels at their position and every pew a Convention of angels thousands and thousands of angels between us and the things of the world help us to break through to that Dimension tonight and see by faith the things that you've given to us I pray you'd Grant help us not to live below our privileges Lord but to see you is who you really are praying granted now as we worship in your presence for just a moment we ask these things in Jesus name is [Music] of the Lord is in this
