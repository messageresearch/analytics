amen do you love the Lord this evening amen just appreciate brother Peter and just the presence of the Lord that's that's here in this place amen we'll turn to Psalms 102 try not to hold you long tonight and I I really mean that I try to preach maybe 30 minutes I may preach less than that so I'm sure that'll make you young people kind of happy but no um just want to kind of talk about prayer tonight and and try to minister on on prayer a little bit might just be simple but it might help somebody amen Psalms 102 and if it's a little broken up you just forgive me and we just pray the Lord will will be with us tonight amen Psalms 102 And1 this is a prayer of of The Afflicted the Bible says when he is overwhelmed and porth out his complaint before the Lord it says Hear My Prayer oh Lord and let my cry come unto thee hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when I call answer me speedily for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an earth my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread amen you can be seated may God just bless his word amen have you ever felt like that just Afflicted overwhelmed you look here at at that word Afflicted it means poor and humble wretched you're you're needy and you know God God really has taken care of us in this hour there's people that have it a lot worse than we do there's there's always somebody that's got it worse than you do right but a lot of times we just see where we're at right and you look at the word that word overwhelmed it means to turn aside so you're so overwhelmed that you you maybe don't know which way to go you're turned to this side or that side you don't you don't know what step to to take you're you're enveloped you're just completely covered that's right you're you're to a spot where your strength is gone right you're so overwhelmed and and we've all been there somebody may be there this evening we may you may be there tomorrow you may not be there today but you may be there tomorrow where you're you're so overwhelmed that you even your strength is Zapped you could be a young person or a person of Fitness but you know something the trials of life things come and you're so overwhelmed that it takes your very strength away come on and I say tonight that if you're overwhelmed amen and there's troubles all around you as the Bible says there he he he was dried up as as the withered grass I say tonight if you're all dried up and you feel uh in week in your spiritual experience amen there is a fountain there's a fountain that we can come to tonight of Living Waters there's a source that you can go to by prayer thank Psalms 42 And1 as the heart panth after the water Brook so my soul panth after thee Oh God my soul thirsteth for God for the Living God when and and he asked this question when shall I come and appear before God Amen my soul thirsteth after this God but when shall I come and and appear before this God that can satisfy amen my thirst and you look at at a deer it says As the deer as the heart as the deer panth amen amen the deer is in trouble right amen he he he's being chased and overwhelmed amen by whatever whatever is coming against him whatever animal that would be a a pack of dogs brother brandom describes how a pack of dogs will chase after a herd of deer and they will take out a a hamstring of the one deer and they will attack the leader then the rest of the pack will eventually comes back to the leader and it makes them an easier pray and thirsting for life he says and that's the way the devil does he cuts you off from prayer meetings he's done cut the hamstrings right then amen you'll pull around from this church to that and you'll run from here to there but anytime the devil wants to gobble you up he's got you under your control when he cuts your prayer life brother you're gone when he cuts your thirst off and perverts it into the things of the world he's got you where he wants you he will let you gobble along there until you get to a certain place where you crash your life out without God right there sure he will so that's the purpose of the enemy to try to Corner you to try to get you to in injured amen where where you can't get to the water amen but amen I believe tonight there's a water source amen amen we're not a deer we ain't got to go out searching for it amen but you can speak to the Rock tonight amen you ain't got to go searching out for this and that amen there's a source tonight amen he's only a a voice away he's only a few words away if you'll just speak to the Rock tonight amen he'll come and refresh you as the deer if your heart's panning tonight amen he's a prayer away thank you Lord he's a prayer away oh yes amen amen God you are my source you're what I have need of he's a prayer away he's just a few words away if you can speak to him tonight thank you Lord Jesus amen so that's what the deer has to do he has to get to the water and if he can get to the water there's a refreshing if he can make it and I believe you can make it tonight amen we can make it tonight there's a rock here in our presence here tonight amen he's an everpresent Rock Amen and in that water amen is healing there's healing for the scarred there's healing for the injured there's healing for the brokenhearted tonight amen there's healing amen whether it be physical spiritual mentally whatever it would be there's a healing for you tonight whatever the need would be amen there's a rock there's a water that you can call upon thank you Lord and it will stop the bleeding of that injury oh yeah and so as brother R said the devil's always trying to overwhelm you trying to crash your your life amen but there's a refreshing amen for the people of God Amen when we can come to the house of God when we can come to the house of worship Amen to the House of Prayer amen amen and he asked the question when shall I come amen and appear before God Amen speak to theck talk tonight speak to him how far away is he he's he's on the present amen he's everywhere you need him to be amen tonight amen whatever you need God to be amen he will be that God for you he will come in that need and be your sufficiency amen glory to God thank you Lord I didn't know we was having a youth service tonight so try to make this as as youth oriented as I can good come on it was a surprise to me so nobody's fault I should have already known on amen that's right Psalms 61 and2 from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been my shelter and my strong tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever I will trust in the covert of thy wings for thou oh God has heard my vows and thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name you look at there he said for thou God thou has heard my vows and so you think about the vows that a husband and a and a wife a man and a woman would would say to each other they're they're committing to one another that they're going to they're going to live amen true to one another amen and as a Christian amen when you say I'm going to be a Christian I'm going to serve God I'm I'm going to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen you're taking a vow you're taking a vow you're taking on that name of a of a Christian amen and so God Amen will make you honor that vow amen and we must honor that vow right amen we must live true to our vow we must live true Amen to the commitment that we have made to God and if you do that God will commit himself that much more to you thank you L and he said thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name what is Heritage it's a possession it's your property it's your inheritance it's your portion it's your share amen if you'll if you'll if you'll bring your vows before God if you'll commit to him if you'll live for him not just in word amen but your life will produce amen that you love Jesus Christ that you want to live for Jesus Christ amen that you want to grow in your relationship to Jesus Christ amen he has given you a portion he has given you inheritage an inheritance tonight Isaiah 54 and 17 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn amen you're overwhelmed right you're overwhelmed you're Afflicted but no weapon formed against you shall prosper he said this is the heritage of the servants and brother Ben mentioned it this morning what are servants amen they are worshippers amen and you are the Servants of God in this hour amen amen there's no other people that can worship like the Bride of Jesus Christ amen we've received the vow of the message of the hour amen God has given us the vows amen of what he said he will do and we're here on the on the other end of that trying to uphold what God Amen the vows amen between us and our lord Jesus thank you Lord amen you are his servants yes amen and you have a Heritage as the worshippers of the Lord in this hour thank you Lord you have a Heritage that no weapon noap no weapon no tactic no snare No Lie the devil shall prosper against you amen nothing shall prosper no weapon amen it will not succeed in this hour amen it will not Prosper against you amen the Gates of Hell may come against you but you will withstand it hour thank you Lord that's your heritage yes sir that's your that's your possession sir as the people of God that's your portion amen every tongue every oppression every Affliction everything that would overwhelm you amen shall that that shall rise you sh every tongue that shall rise against you in judgment Thou shalt condemn amen help us Lord tonight you love the Lord oh amen David we look here at David David was a man of prayer you look at David the shepherd boy and brother ramam says here and a god- called man he said and I think of the rugged training he did to David he never so much as schooled him into some school but he schooled him in his own school I like that he said David was was a hunter and a Shepherd in his Psalms he wrote of Green Pastures and Still Waters because there he was alone by himself he wasn't contaminated with the things of the world he says God has got to get a man away from the things of the world so he can get him quiet so he can listen to God that still Small Voice that once in contact with God he becomes Fearless then notice that he didn't care what anyone says he'd been in the presence of God Amen and he know he knew God in the power of his resurrection and that's the place that God wants for you young people here this evening amen a young Christian as a young Christian there will be times amen where it seems that you're all alone but that is the time to draw not to God that is a time in your life that that God wants to come in and reveal himself to you amen and to get closer to God Amen what are we told to do amen read your Bible and pray that's right amen but but this is a Time amen as David amen going to God's School you you may go to different schools all through your life you may move around and go to this one but there's no school more important than going to God's school going on the back side of the desert amen and getting in tune with that voice getting in tune with God by prayer amen and and dedicating and consecrating your life to him amen and in that alone time and and I can say that I was there amen if you if you're a Christian starting out amen and you've been in the way perhaps you can testify of that that amen and I I real I remember that there was just such a it seemed like such a long period of time where it it seemed like I didn't have amen the friends like I used to have why because I gave up the things of the world I gave up those old acquaintances and that's just the way it's going to be that's the way it's going to be but but when you get to that place where you feel all alone amen amen that's where God God he's got you right where he wants you God help me to speak tonight he's got you right to a place where he wants you Amen to where you can really get into the word and listen to the message of the hour and hear the voice of God Amen and get in tune with what the spirit is trying to do what it's trying to say amen for your generation Amen to develop a prayer life and to come in in into that into the that prayer life amen where the spirit of God can come and speak to you and reveal amen his things his word to you amen as young people God don't want you mixed up with the world he wants you to himself he wants you to himself so he can use you so you can be a witness for God come on he wants you Amen to a place where the world is shut out and where he is shut in amen we read on here and then David we see him one day God permitted a bear to come in and and get one of his sheep and David took just took after that bear no doubt but what he prayed because a little later on he confessed to it he he prayed and asked God and me he was a caretaker over the Sheep he could not lose that sheep and he must save that sheep at at all cost and he grabbed his little Shing slingshot and took after that bear and killed him he he must he must have he must save that sheep you see that was that was what God was training him for thank you Lord so David was anointed to be king Oh my he was anointed to be king amen for his day God had trained him on the on the back side of the of the of the the pastor there just amen realizing what his purpose was that that he was to protect the sheep and he's seen how God had done that all along amen and that that encouraged David and so he was anointed by the prophet to be king King and he was in the camp of his Brethren one day and he heard the boast of the enemy amen but David was a man of prayer come on it did it didn't matter he had been in contact with God yes sir in Psalms 51 he says give ear to my words oh Lord consider my meditation hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my God for unto thee will I pray my voice shalt here in the morning oh Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and I will look up amen like David a man of Prayer in the morning Amen Let God hear your voice Amen Let Your let him hear your voice calling to him amen amen David acknowledged amen though he was anointed to be king amen he acknow he acknowledged who the real King was even though he was anointed to be king he gave God his rightful place he recognized that he needed his authority amen and and for with him he was without nothing yes thank you Lord he wasn't nothing and we're nothing right we're nothing without him we can't do nothing without him amen with us things are are impossible right well With God all things are possible amen we can't live a Christian Life it takes him living it through us we got no power of Our Own no authority of our own only power and authority that we have is what God gives to us come on and so we are Kings and Priests unto our God and we must recognize our King amen and we have been anointed in this hour to rule and Reign amen by by Jesus Christ so we must be in tune with his voice of authority if we are to overcome the enemy the the only way you're going to do it is to be in tune with that voice if you can't hear that voice amen you're not going to know what lays ahead but if you're in tune with that voice amen God God will give you a he'll give you the faith he'll give you the foresight amen amen he'll give you the courage for whatever whatever you go through amen amen he'll give that something within you he'll instill that something within you amen and if you've got the Holy Ghost everything you have need of for in life journey is already within you amen but you got to tap into that resource amen you got to speak to God In Prayer amen Jesus Christ amen he had to be in tune with that Spirit yes brother said he had to be in tune with that Spirit that's why he prayed amen that he could he could know the will of the father and he said how much more you and I have we got to pray Amen to be in tune with God amen amen to do the will of the father that's praise the Lord tonight thank you Lord he said look at David a witness now he knowed what he was talking about the opposition was against him sure it was against him but he know he was a witness he know what he was talking about amen you got to know what you're talking about come on when when you come up against the enemy you got to know where you stand right you got to know where you stand on God's word and if you stand on his word on his promises amen though all hell assail you you shall not be moved though all hell will come against you amen if you know who you are if you know where you're standing amen nothing can move you off of that Revelation offer your Authority and your power as anointed Kings and Priests amen because we have been anointed in this hour to be that oh thank you Lord so he know what he was talking about he said he said to to Goliath he had heard his boast you meet me as a Philistine in the name of philistin with armor and a sword and a a spear but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel he said amen that's the difference amen amen that's what made the difference and he said today amen amen by faith amen he had seen it God had showed him already on the backside of the pasture somewhere looking out over those sheep he had already given the bear into his hand he he had already given the line into his hand amen and these Sheep amen were the real sheep of God Amen those were this Earthly Sheep amen but this was God's Heritage this was God's people amen and he knew that he was anointed to be a protector over them and and heaven forbid if he was going to let some uncircumcised Philistine come in and take amen control and take the courage out of the camp amen don't let the devil come in and steal your courage don't don't let the devil come in and steal your praise tonight don't let him come in and take your joy away from you from serving God amen amen try to try to bring you down try to make you feeble and weak amen and overwhelm you amen amen we been we've got an anointed word among us we've got an anointed king amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen your protector I can't protect you but the word is here the word is here here in this hour amen amen amen is a king coming into Glory he's a king coming into power and that's the king that we're serving amen amen amen we can think so much so much or so little of yourself whatever oh yeah amen but there's one true king that we serve amen amen we might think that there's great ones there's little ones we're all the same there's none greater there's none smaller amen we're all on the same level amen we all needed the grace of Jesus Christ amen we all needed the king of glory to come into our hearts oh thank you Lord amen we're nothing without him you're nothing without amen being in tune with that voice by prayer amen if you don't go to him amen you're you're cutting yourself off you're cutting yourself off from that Source amen amen he said so little David starts he said when he gets about in the in the sling throw he said watch he had five Stones j s u s wrapped in his fingers he says faith faith f AI t h brother he got the thing to working right he said around and around and he said when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in a perpetual motion amen working in your soul something's got to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils was scattered amen like Roaches on the floor in the summertime when the lights are turned on he said Here Comes faith in Jesus here he come I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel and he began to swing that slingshot around and around he said the Holy Ghost AM man took that rock to the to the enemy the Holy Ghost it wasn't David it wasn't David's Own Strength but it was the Holy Ghost amen it was that anointing amen by faith amen he took it to the enemy oh yeah right amen help us Lord tonight oh yeah tried to get brother Joel to come back I tried amen so David amen by the Holy Ghost Faith got to going and that's what it takes amen get it going tonight amen let's get something going amen he knew that God would come on the scene he knew that the god W that was with him when the bear came when the line came amen he was in tune with that with the voice of God in tune with the spirit of God Amen and that's where your courage comes from amen that that's that's where amen your faith comes from and and and knowing where you where you stand amen amen you've talked to God about it amen you've been in a conference with God Amen and I I know every day every day we're going to face Devils we're going to face enemies amen greater and greater and greater amen but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen recognize the greater in you in this hour amen talk to him amen have a conference with him amen amen God sees what you're going to face God sees what you're going to go through amen and he'll give you the Courage the ability to face it that's right thank you Lord amen and so as I sung the song hey man when you're on The Winning Side the opposition doesn't matter right amen we're on The Winning Side tonight amen you're on the winning side with Jesus Christ amen when the battle came when the battle got hot and heavy David didn't have to pray about it he was already prayed up on Amen help us Lord help us Lord to be prayed up amen ready ready for the battle that's we'll shift gears here a little bit Luke 11 and 1 and it came to pass as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples I believe we can still ask him that here this evening don't you teach us to pray Lord amen how do we get closer to God brother R said read your Bible and pray how simple is that but we can still come to God teach us Lord amen we can still learn from his word we can still learn from the spirit of God in prayer and Jesus didn't teach us by only words but he taught by example right and he was our example and brother Bram says here in Feast of the trumpets he says Lord it was set on one occasion by thy disciples teach us to pray for when we catch sight of the great God of heaven we do realize how insufficient we are so teach us to pray Lord in our hearts now for the things that would be beneficiary to your kingdom and for thy servants thou knowest the need of every person oh yeah Matthew 6 you believe that tonight amen we're insufficient without him teach us Lord amen teach us to pray amen we we may be studied in the message we may we may have learned these prayers and and the right things to say and it's more than just saying the right things and getting up saying the right things amen but it's in sinc a sincerity God help us tonight to be sincere Amen to come before God teach me Lord bring me up higher bring my my relationship up with you Lord if I'm out out of tune with you Lord let me hear your voice let me get back in tune with you God Amen help me to come up higher than what I am Matthew 6 and9 very familiar scripture after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is is in heaven and give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us amen Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever so Jesus is showing us the approach here Hallowed be thy name so our approach to God is everything amen we acknowledge God's holiness amen you come to him and not just in any old way but we come to him in a in a Consecration and the Bible says without Holiness no man shall see God so we approach him amen how we approach him in worship amen not just God give me this God give me that but there's an approach to God Amen and Jesus is trying to show us here hallowed he said Hallowed be thy name amen we approach him in reverence we approach him in respect amen we come not to him Amen in our own own worthiness and our own righteousness amen but we come confessing our insufficiency amen and and even more so now that even after this this scripture was said amen amen the blood has been shed amen and so when you come to God when you come to God it's not you coming amen but you're coming amen amen under the blood under the righteousness of the blood and when we come under that blood in prayer amen Amen brother random said amen it's not your voice that God God hears amen but it's the voice of Jesus Amen it's your voice speaking through that blood amen amen don't worry about your unworthiness amen don't worry about amen our our obvious in uh insufficient amen amen there's a blood that's been spilled for you and I that your voice can go through even now even now God is with within speaking distance everything you have need of is within speaking distance and we speak through the blood we approach God we approach our intercessor through the blood amen he said thy kingdom come so not so much a a literal Place amen but a power that's right it's his kingship that you want want to come right it's you want God's Dominion amen his kingdom his dominion and his rule oh yeah and let thy will be done where in this earth right let it be done in this earth Amen in this body in this earth and vessel let this let this Earth be subject to your Dominion let this Earth be subject to your rulership amen amen let this Earth be under your Dominion thank you Lord and so what are you doing you're not just coming with I need this or I need that but you're coming in reverence you're coming in worship worship than and you're saying God let thy kingdom come let what you want done amen let it be done in this earth amen amen let it be done in this body of dirt and that's what you are thank you Lord how tall are you Peter 5'9 I'm a few inches taller than you I'm almost six foot six foot of dust yeah six foot of dirt and that's what we are amen but we have been formed to be Sons and Daughters of God right amen but you're dirt you're reformed from the dirt amen we come from the dust and we'll go back to the dust and so let me be his clay let me be someone that his will can be done and someone that he can form that he can fashion himself in amen that it wouldn't just be about me that it would be about him and and my commitment to him and and what he said he would do that I want to keep my part and and if we'll keep our part we know that God's going to keep his part right it's a little different tonight I'm just rolling with it I don't know I certainly love the Lord tonight oh yes so we're not here I take my time we're not here to establish our own kingdom and our own power and what we want to do but we're here amen thy kingdom come we're here to establish the kingdom of God God's kingdoms and brother Ram said you are Messiah holding forth the representation of the Messianic Kingdom amen amen when you surrender your will to God's will amen the Holy Ghost will come and anoint you to perform what God Said in his word of what would be and I I I think that's what brother brother Ben said today I think I heard him right it's not so much God speaking back to you though you can hear him in an audible voice and me but when God speaks it's his word living back through you amen and you're written Epistles read of all men amen amen and that's that's God's voice speaking back to you amen when God interprets his word when he does what he said he would do amen that's the voice of God speaking back through you when when he heals you come on he said in his word he would heal you amen and when you ask God to heal you he says all right I'm going to heal you he already said it in his word but God is is his own interpreter I wish I could preach tonight God is his own interpreter tonight amen and God will interpret his word through this Kingdom amen your needs whatever your need would be amen God comes down amen and you and God's will is done his word is done in you thank you Lord amen that's good you come under that Kingdom you come under that Authority you've approached God the right way and you come under that authority of the kingdom of God yes sir and brother R says you got to be identified with Christ is life living in you when you're identified with Christ is when Christ lives in you it isn't a ritual it isn't belonging in church that's all good but you you see the real sincerity of it he says and and that's What It Takes when he said when we come to Healing Services he said if you'll notice on the discernment line it's constantly tell the people to repent he said there you go till our prayers have become a tradition it's got to be it's got to go beyond a tradition it's got to go beyond a form right it's got to be a sincerity for you and I oh yes he goes on here he says we kneel down at night say Lord bless so and so bless so and so and help John do all he said you make a mascot and you make him some kind of Aaron boy God you do this and you do this that's not the way Jesus told us to pray he said Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come he said but we try to order God what to do for us amen that's the wrong approach that's right you can't approach God like that right that you know what's best yeah right because you're coming to the one that knows you're coming to the one that can order your St steps you're coming to the one that can give you the understanding that can give you the Revelation amen for every step of your life if if you s if you're in and it's not a tradition to you amen and you come in sincerity amen God will give you an answer he'll leave you either give you a yes or he'll give you a no he says here he said but you see when when they ask these things and they ask for it he said they don't ask as Jesus said we try to make God aaronb Lord you do this for me and you did this for me and you go and do that and tell him what to do but don't ever think that you're so spiritual that God has to listen to you come on right you can be uh so Heavenly minded that you're no earthly good on right amen you're so spiritual that you've got it all figured out and you will never get an answer from God with that attitude that's right people become so spiritual that they think they know better than the word yeah so spiritual they'll pray for something and if God doesn't tell them a yes or no amen they they think that they can just go on and go over the word because they're so spiritual and maybe the word already told you what to do but you're so spiritual you can't even see it oh my what an attitude amen that we should watch out out for amen yeah I I think about prayer prayer is not it's it's not something uh under legalism right yeah that's right amen it's not a legalism but it's a sincerity that you come before God and you need an answer you need to bring your request before God Amen it's not you going before God and telling God what you think about it oh my praise the Lord amen oh my let's wait on the Lord again I don't know where I'm going I'm just rolling with it tonight okay Jesus said when you pray in this manner Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done who find where where we do that we're always wanting God to run errands for us to do something he said but when we're willing to say thy will be done oh commit ourselves to him commit our ways to him and all that we are committed to him then that's when God will will move when you're willing to let him work on you and not you work on him that's simple isn't it amen you're willing amen Lord let thy will be done amen that you can commit everything to God amen amen that you haven't got it all figured out and brother R said watch out for a person that's got it all figured out amen I need God's leading in my life I need his leading in my life for my family I don't know everything I I don't understand everything about the message I still need a revelation of the spirit and the only the only way I can do that is if I get before God and I ask him to show me that's the only way amen for Flesh and Blood doesn't reveal it amen but my Father which is in heaven amen shows it to you oh yes amen I need understanding I need knowledge yes I need wisdom I need to know how to lead my family I I need to know am man I we we got to walk in this sech we got to walk in this life and while we're here amen we we got to depend upon Him we've got to to commit it to him amen oh thank you Lord try to hurry here come brother R said there's a permissive will and a perfect will isn't that right Brethren he said I feel like for a long time I've kind of been the permissive will of God and not the perfect will man if a prophet of God could be in the permissive will what about you and I he thought he thought he knew what was right and the right way and he was in the permissive will what about you and I amen we've got to watch he said now there's a perfect way and a permissive way and I feel that if God here on the platform can show me the things that has been in in my rooms and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me uh and what he wants me to do and to be but I feel as long as I've got it all hooked up or I feel that he won't put his hands on it as long as I'm doing it and that's the way it is anything amen God permitted the prophet to operate as he wanted to he permitted him and and he got to where it was really just him opting to continue to operate like that right but he wanted God's hands on what he done do you feel the same way I don't just want to live my life and how I want to live it amen I don't just want to walk about amen but I I want God's hand leading me amen I want to be under prayer under the spirit of Prayer in this hour amen God leading me Amen in this hour I want him to have control of my life every decision every move amen his perfect will he goes on as long as you're going as long as you're going to do it as someone talks about you and and you just talk back about them God can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself on he said just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him he said the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committ to God when you when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him just commit it to him and God will take care of it don't you believe that don't you believe that tonight don't you believe that tonight that God is able that if I commit it to him that if it's out of my power that if I commit it to the one that's got power that's got rule that it's that that's got Authority I say Lord let thy kingdom come thy will be done God it's out of my hands amen my children amen our children we've got to commit them back to God Amen they've got to walk in this world they're going to grow up they're going to live amen but we commit you back to God Amen and God has the rulership over that over your life and we believe that by faith amen we committed to him amen we committed to him by faith amen Psalms 37 and3 forgive me tonight Lord help us trust in the Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily Thou shalt be fed and me trust in him have confidence yeah amen he's your security tonight Delight thyself also on the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart amen don't look so down and out all the time be happy about it be happy in the Lord anyways no matter what happens or comes a day however that song goes I'm going to wear a smile and hold my head up high and say I'm happy in the Lord anyways commit commit thy way and the Lord trust also him and he shall bring it to pass amen your journey your life committed thank you Lord to him amen we look here I said I was going to be short and I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry forgive me Lord forgive me people in a time of decision we look at elaser he's known as the model servant why why was he known as the model servant he was sent to find a bride for Isaac and we find here brother Bram says he says we find out that elzar decided that though he was a good man and he was on a great Mission but he was under an oath amen he was under an oath and so he says now when a man gets to that place it's time not to use his own thinking so he knelt down and began to pray and he said Lord if you blessed me in the way and you've brought me here let it come to pass that the first damel that comes am me from the city to get water and he said because it was the evening time that they come out to get their water he said I'll go and ask her for a drink he said see was him asking a sign and if she gives me a drink he he said I'll also water your camels that will be the one that you have chosen he committed it to God he said Let It Be Your Choice Lord he said oh if we can only learn to to be a trusted servant of God like that then we could commit to things of God things to God it's the most powerful thing that I know of is a committ commit thy ways commit your thinking if you're sick and the doctors can't help you no more just to commit the the case to God and act like it's already done amen something will have to take place it just can't keep from it because God is a Creator he talks about a seed when you commit a seed into the ground am man you don't go the next day and dig it up you've got to commit it to the ground right that's right you've got to commit it to the ground and and you don't come back the next day and try to dig up dig it up or a week later and expect to for it to be fully grown it takes time but he says here is and you can put me on record after 30 years of preaching I can say this I've never one time sincerely asked God for anything and committed it to him he either give it to me or he told me why he couldn't do it yes sir amen if we'll take that attitude in this hour amen I think it'll take a lot of the disappointment away if we'll take that attitude that God I'm going to commit it to you amen you're either going to give it to me or you're going to tell me you can't do it whatever it is Lord let thy will be done thy kingdom come in this earth amen and if we have the right mental attitude towards God's word amen that's what brings it to pass do you believe that sir that's what brings it to pass commit it to him and know that he's in control of the thing amen Isaiah 56 and6 you love the Lord yes sir thought this was good we'll try to close on this if we can Isaiah 56 and6 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my Covenant even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine Altar for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people amen you you you love the Lord tonight I'll wind this down here amen he said he said the sons of the stranger and so we are those strangers we were the Gentiles that were alienated from God but by the blood of Jesus Christ we have been made partakers of that Kingdom amen amen we're committed to him to serve him to love him with all his Hearts Amen to be his servants to be his worshippers sir that is your purpose in this hour amen amen as he said to keep amen and not pollute the Sabbath amen and that's our purpose and it's our to keep and and and to not pollute this Christian life amen to be a people that take a hold of the Covenant take a hold of the message of the hour and to believe it with all your heart amen and he said I will bring them to my Holy Mountain amen and God will bring you to a place where he can reveal amen not man's ideas but to reveal his deity to reveal his power and his authority to reveal himself in the fullness of his love in the fullness of his grace thank you Jesus and they will be joyful in the House of Prayer Amen brother BR says heavenly father now we're assembled in the house it's called The House of Prayer the place where we come to Worship the Lord Jesus and all is great works and to teach his word and to believe that he is the word is that why we're here amen than amen judgment begins at the house of God Amen and this is a place where I come to find my faults yeah sure where you come to find your faults we we come here to find the the places that are loose and a little out of place where we can tighten those things up is that right and that's why we come here this is a house of worship this is a House of Prayer amen this place is dedicated to worship and prayer a place amen where people can feel free Amen to move as the spirit moves amen preach with me here this evening I'm winding it down amen amen why is there such a hold back on the people of God Amen in this hour and in this place why is there such a Hold Back come on why is there there such a hold back on on people coming to the Altar and praying why why is there such a hold back on that amen because that's the place amen where I came and I died out to myself I didn't do it out in the truck amen out there in the parking lot on my phone I did it here at an altar amen amen and this place has been dedicated as a house of worship as a House of Prayer amen amen where lives can be changed amen we ought to prioritize seeking
