[34:38] greetings for our home Church there in
[34:39] BlackRock as well
[34:41] if you got your Bibles tonight can we
[34:43] turn to Hebrews chapter 12 and
[34:47] I could preach this evening on the
[34:49] believer's focus
[34:52] something I've been preaching back home
[34:54] for a little bit so
[34:57] I've been just burning our hearts
[34:59] tonight
[35:01] Hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 and 2
[35:03] familiar scripture it says wherefore sin
[35:06] we also are compassed about with such
[35:08] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[35:11] aside every weight and the sin was just
[35:14] so easily beset us and let us run with
[35:17] patience the race that is set before us
[35:20] look at what he says here looking in
[35:22] other words look away from present
[35:24] conditions and focus in on the prize
[35:26] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[35:30] the author and the finisher of our faith
[35:34] can you say amen amen God bless you can
[35:37] have your seats this evening
[35:39] we realize this evening as we even the
[35:42] time of the signs that we're in and it
[35:45] just seemed like they're here their
[35:46] brother being there's no continuing City
[35:48] and there's nothing that is really sure
[35:51] in this life outside the baptism of the
[35:54] Holy Ghost and
[35:56] in this life and Satan has placed so
[35:59] many traps and he's watched us since we
[36:03] was just little fellows and brother
[36:05] Allen he knows how to fog up our our
[36:08] Focus the best that he can and it
[36:10] becomes a distraction I pray tonight
[36:12] that we don't allow the distractions uh
[36:15] to become our Focus this evening I
[36:18] believe he's standing here at Paul is
[36:19] just simply saying look unto him not
[36:22] that we're going to be exempt from
[36:24] troubles or trials or persecution or
[36:26] famine but looking unto Jesus the author
[36:30] the beginner and the finisher of our
[36:33] faith also Philippians chapter 3 verse
[36:36] 10.
[36:40] says that I in the third chapter 10th
[36:44] verse says that I may know him and the
[36:46] power of his resurrection and the
[36:49] fellowship of his serpent being made
[36:51] comfortable unto his death if by any
[36:54] means I might attain unto the
[36:56] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[36:58] have already obtained either we're
[37:00] already perfect but I follow after if
[37:02] thou May apprehend that for which also I
[37:05] have apprehended of Christ Jesus
[37:08] Brethren I count on myself to apprehend
[37:11] it but this one thing I do forgetting
[37:13] those things which are behind and
[37:16] reaching forth until those things that
[37:19] are before I press it's going to be a
[37:22] battle I press um brother Brandon told
[37:25] us that you receive the Holy Ghost every
[37:28] gun in hell is pointing at you he said I
[37:31] press to the mark and forgetting those
[37:35] things went behind Reaching Forward to
[37:36] things that are before I press toward
[37:38] the mark for the prize of the High
[37:40] Calling of God in Christ Jesus so keep
[37:44] our focus on the mark and not
[37:46] circumstances right I'm moving past my
[37:50] fears I'm moving past my doubts you know
[37:52] focus is the art of knowing really what
[37:55] to ignore yes
[37:58] amen not that we ain't going to have
[37:59] distractions but the focus is the art of
[38:02] knowing what to to to ignore and and
[38:05] don't give the devil you know any of our
[38:07] our attention and just press through
[38:11] every battle every trial and and knowing
[38:14] one thing as Paul said maybe none of
[38:17] these things move me because I'm going
[38:20] home amen this world is not my home I'm
[38:25] just the passing through hey Ben and no
[38:28] doubt you know in this age that we're
[38:30] living in it's hard to take a right
[38:32] attitude it's hard to you know keep a
[38:34] right attitude it's hey man any other
[38:37] Prophet told us you know the right
[38:39] mental attitude to the vain promises God
[38:42] will bring it to pass and and
[38:46] many times yeah in this journey we we go
[38:51] through uh questions we go through
[38:53] Temptations we go through trying times

[39:00] sicknesses hey badmouth at the end of
[39:03] the day amen as a Christian we jump
[39:05] right back up and amen We Begin our our
[39:09] focus never wavered amen because we go
[39:12] through trials and purchase persecution
[39:14] this life doesn't mean we're not
[39:16] Christians it doesn't mean we ain't got
[39:18] the Holy Ghost Amen brother Robert what
[39:20] it does mean amen that we're going to be
[39:23] greater we're going to be better we're
[39:24] going to be an overcomer hey because
[39:26] greater is he that is in me than the he
[39:29] that's in the world that's right in
[39:32] other words the right mental attitude

[58:25] look to one thing the voice which is the
[58:29] word of God that speaks to us churches
[58:33] and people can speak anyway but look to
[58:36] the voice our focus should be settled a
[58:39] voice which is his word
[58:41] that'll defeat Satan any time any place
[58:44] any condition under any circumstances
[58:49] he had to focus his mind to the will of
[58:51] God by the word of God and believe it
[58:54] if we can focus ourselves to the plan of
[58:57] God to what God wants for us and what
[59:00] God promised us and let everything else
[59:03] alone no matter how long it is
