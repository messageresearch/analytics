Glenn is good to see it tonight and and we're kind of in a last-minute kind of deal we had to call off our our regular services and go back to live-streaming course we're not limited to how many can be here but for tonight and then we'll let you know about Sunday so many of you are watching we've had a situation where someone from another church tested positive and they've been around some people from our church so we haven't had anyone from our church test positive but because of the closeness of the situation we thought in the abundance of caution that we would do that and never inspired me to preach to empty pews but but we're glad too that you're here tonight those of you that could make it and we're so so happy that you could make it and I'm sure there there's not much of a risk of exposure but but what was there would be from from that and those that were exposed to that we're taking caution and I believe we should but we also have a responsibility to preach the Word of God and hear the Word of God and so I'm glad that you're here tonight and those of you that are and I'm glad for those of you that are watching and if I didn't get a hold of you and let you know personally about it you forgive me for that we tried to let as meaning know as possible Genesis chapter 3 and verse 9 I want to talk to you tonight about accountability accountability and I believe this is important and it goes along with something that I preached here not long ago about responsibility and so we're gonna talk about accountability and maybe it'll be something that that would help us maybe a little bit heavy for a while but we get to the end there's something really good that I want to get to us something that's on my heart and so kind of just hang with me tonight hang on buckle your seat belts as my brother would say in and just try to stay with us as we go through this tonight Genesis chapter 3 and verse 9 and the Lord God called him to Adam and said unto Him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful for all that you do for us every day and grateful for your goodness and your mercy to us I pray that you would just continue to bless us tonight and Lord keep us in your perfect will oh how we need to know your will every step of the way every day god we pray that you would help us through this current situation Lord you knew what bumster would be in the road Lord and so we asked you to come and and just guide us and lead us Lord as only you can through life we pray in Jesus name Amen I mean god bless you you could be seated this evening we'll make some other announcements in the future as to future services as well so keep that in mind I had recently been thinking about a experience that I'd had when I was younger I used to deliver bread when I was a teenager to the back rooms of storage rooms of grocery stores and during that time there was an employee who sits at the back and his entire job his whole life is to sit at the back of the grocery store and count how many pieces of bread or how many rolls or how many sweets come in the back door grocery store and that's his whole life that's all that he does is to count that up and I found out that he's actually one of the highest-paid employees in the grocery store and that he's actually a union employee and and then he sits back there and brother David and I've always wanted to have one of those jobs but they never would have me but but he has it he has a pretty cushy job and the reason is because he's accountable he is someone who asked to give an account for every item that comes in the back door everything that comes in so we had to come come in and he would sit there and he would count you've got so many roles so many so many loaves of bread and he would know exactly what come in the store and he would report to the store manager exactly what the stock was and how much they had and if it didn't match at the end of the day he was going to be accountable for that and so there was a great reward that come with it he didn't have to work all that hard but he was the most accountable in the store when God come to Adam in the scripture that we read and he said Adam where art thou he's requiring Adam to give an account for his whereabouts and what he had done and I think it's interesting that he doesn't call out - he doesn't call out to Eve or to the serpent he didn't say serpent where art thou he didn't say to Eve were how but he said Adam where are you and the reason for that is because Adam was primarily accountable for what he for the rest of him and so he would speak to Adam first so Adam turns around and God says Adam where are you and Adam said I heard your voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked I went and hid myself and so at but Adam said but it wasn't my fault he said Eve made me do it right and so then he said hey don't blame me right and because the serpent made me do it and so God if you go back in that chapter he begins to speak first to the serpent and then to even find it's all the way back to Adam and he makes each one of them responsible for what happened so the surfer was responsible for what he did Eve was responsible for what she did but Adam was responsible for the entire thing and ever since the phone has been the case that he's been responsible because of his position and so we find that in a position you have a different level of responsibility or accountability than others do and Paul speaks to this accountability in Romans chapter 14 he says why that's now judged thy brother why does how said it not that brother or say well he doesn't do anything for God you know said we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ I want you to keep that in mind because I know what you're thinking but having been raised in a message and around the message you probably think well the bride doesn't come to the white throne judgment that's true we're going to show you that in a moment but there is a place that we have to stand and give an account for what we've done we've got to do that in Romans 14 11 he's goes on he says for it is written as I live saith the Lord every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess to God verse 12 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God every one of us shall give account of himself to God and ultimately God made Adam accountable and he made Eve accountable and he made the serpent accountable every one of us shall give account of himself to God in the 16th century that was a Protestant reformer in England by the name of Hugh Latimer and what's known as the great preacher of his day it would he had many opportunities to speak and once he found that he was to preach before King Henry the eighth that'd be kind of a hard thing to do that was the king that was known for cutting off the heads of his wives but he had to preach in front of him and he got up and he began to say this he says Latimer Latimer speaking of himself he said do you remember that you're speaking before the high and mighty King Henry the eighth who has power to command you to be sent to prison who can have your head cut off if it please him will you not take care to say nothing that will offend royal ears you can pause and continued Latimer Latimer do you not remember that you're speaking before the king of kings and Lord of lords before him and whose throne Henry the eighth will stand before him to him one day you will have to give account yourself he said Latimer be faithful to your master and declare all of God's word and he ended up giving his life during the time of the daughter of King Henry the 8th Queen Mary Bloody Mary but he but he had to give an account and he would rather give that account and have his conscience clear before God than before the King so each one of us kills in account but the Baron says when you're born God sets the record on and that's outdated my kids don't know how a record works but I'm actually old enough to have found a record in an antique store and played one and so I know how record works when but the Bell said you put a record on it don't make much noise for a little while and I'll think back and you remember when you put a record on it don't make much noise it's quiet and then all of a sudden it begins oh you here's a little scratching sound and then it begins he said it don't make much noise for a little while he said that's the little baby he said till it comes to accountability till it comes to accountability and begins to know right from wrong said then the noise starts he starts saying things and doing things he has to answer for and brother Bell says then when that life ends that record or tape is took off and laid in the great big library of God he said now how you going to get around it at the judgment bar it's played right back in front of you every move you made every thought that went through your mind I'll tell you what God knows how to record things I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ but wipes away all of our past sin once it's repented it goes under the blood and I'm so thankful for that because God keeps a record of the things of unrepentant sin now Jesus said it this way he said but I say to you that every idle word that men shall speak so in other words just something they just throw out there they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment every idle word well that would get some of us wouldn't it we say a lot of idle words they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment see the rabbit says every move you make every time you bat your eye it'll never die it's in the ether waves of the air television doesn't manufacture that it just picks up that wave of you and produces it on the screen it's there anyhow it always was every moves you ever made is still alive in the air he said now you see what we're gonna be at the judgement so if you had the ability today and then science has proved this that but they just don't have the ability to do it but if you had the ability you could go back and pick up the vibrations of the voice of Jesus Christ and replay it today because it's still circling the earth and I'm thankful for that because he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing but that that voice always circles the earth whatever Jesus said circles the earth whatever you say circles the earth the vibrations of it never never stop and brother Branham says even even your form even what you do it always is it always was every move you ever made is still alive in the air he said now you see what we're going to be at the judgement in Malachi chapter 3 in verse 16 and this taken by the Jews and they say that that there's a recording angel and that actually fits with some things that mother Benham said and we'll look at that in a moment but they say there's a recording angel because of this scripture it says then they that feared the Lord spake often to one another in the live hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord so was written before the Lord and that fought upon his name so it's not just the bad things that you do but the good things so he says that a book of remembrance was written and this is where they get the idea of a recording angel now Branham talks about this and he says I dreamed it he says he said I was standing one day and I was watching that great time he said not the judgment he said now I don't believe the church or the bride goes to a judgment he said but I was there when the crowns was being given out he said in the great big throne set up here in Jesus and the recording angel and all was standing there and brother Branham has another another time and that was a dream of the random has a vision and he talks about this vision and perfection of 1957 and you remember the vision because brother Branham walks into a some kind of a cafe or an establishment like that and he sees a woman that it's not what she should be at all and all painted up and and flirting with this man that was there's police officer but a man kind of has some hard thoughts about that situation and he stands there and he said when he when he did that he had a vision he said as I stood looking he said I got a little closer to him and I noticed him and I could hear him say Father forgive him now he sees a vision of the earth spinning and he sees that his own sin going out and hitting out like a bumper of the blood of Jesus Christ that surrounded the earth and he said I could hear him say Father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing he said and I looked down and there laid a book he said and there was a recording angel there and standing by his side he said and every time I send it was put down on the book and if you remember the vision I was talking about his whole life and how that when he was a young boy the angel would write those things down but there came a time he said when Jesus dipped his hand into his own side and pulled it out bloody and wrote pardon the crossed it well I'm so glad for that time but brother Graham tells us he said every time I send it was foot down on the book and my name was on it and I realized that someday that blood streak would be lifted and I would have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life speaking him before he got saved he said but I've seen by his mercy he was holding off my judgment don't think that God just gonna let you get by with whatever you want to get by with because nothing happens you do it and nothing happens you get by with it now but there's coming a day when the blood streaks going to be gone and the recording angel quotes the book and that's it or well the book is of my life is still open I want him to dip his hand and his sign it right across it pardoned so he said that blood streak would be lifted and I would have stand in the presence of God with my sinful life but I seen by his mercy was holding off my judgment now but the brand talks about how that when you get the Holy Ghost your godson or God's daughter he said that's true enough so when you are God's Son and God's daughter he can't lose you right you don't get saved so God can loose you but we're still accountable being saved doesn't remove accountability from our life because whether matter said but if you don't obey God walk in the light in the word walk in the lawyer walk in the light walk in the word believe God he said then you won't have any inheritance he said well that's just exactly the way God does it yet you're still son or daughter of God but you won't have any inheritance and I wonder about somebody who doesn't care about his inheritance I understand there's some that will just never never seem to really be able to grab ahold and it seems like that they struggle through life and I believe God understands but but when it comes to somebody that just turns down the things of God and says well I'm a Christian but I can just live any way I want to I don't wonder if that person is really a son or daughter of God because a son or daughter a real son or daughter of God cares about their inheritance so who are we accountable to let's look at that tonight first of all we are accountable to God just like Adam and Eve were Adam where are you every one of us are accountable to God sinners serpent seed seed of God Christians all of us none of us escape being accountable to God we are accountable first for our sins in first John 1:9 he says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness but I want you to notice what it says if we confess and that's not to me or to anybody else but that's confessing to God if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness but we have to confess it and unconfessed sin will be held accountable for that that's true and that's what we're marks of a Christian is you you repent quickly and there's an advocate there for you but but if you hold unconfessed sin in your life then there's something wrong you need to go back and really have an experience with God that's all I can say now but the writer says many people see some only three crosses on Calvary there was four one of them was the thief on one side the thief on the other side Jesus in the middle that's three crosses Judas hung himself on a sycamore tree which is a cross Kirstin is he that hangeth on the tree and there was the son of God came from God returning to God taking with him the repentant sinner remember that was the thief on one side that said father or he said bring take me with when you go to your kingdom he said he wanted to be forgiven and he was a repentant sinner but on the other side was the one who went to hell and he said Judas took with him the unrepentant sinner so a thief on one side had repented both of them had done the same thing both of them being guilty of the same acts but the one repented well I want to be with that one that repented I want to be someone who can repent when when I find sin has come in my life so Mel the son of perdition he said coming from hell we're turning back to hell taking with him the unrepentant sinner we find the importance of repentance in the ephesian church age which had fallen and the scripture says remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent new the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove that candlestick out of his place except thou repent God tells them to remember he said evidently something had left their minds oh I think we need to be reminded that we need to repent every day only something unless their minds they've forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin he said the origin of the first stage was Pentecost they had fallen from it they had forgotten the glory and laundr of it there was a time when it it was special to them and now it wasn't special anymore they can do without it said remember what you've fallen from and turn back to it he says they'd forgotten the Goron wonder have at that moment when you got saved and you remembered what it was like for the Jonah to have that sense that your sins were forgiven and you were clean you're a warship you had such joy in your life and then as life goes on you begin to kind of get oh it gets away from you but you have to remember where you come from remember your origin remember the glory and the wonder of salvation he said it was time to go back in mind and then reality back to when they could say for me to live is Christ I wonder sometimes if that's what God is doing shaking this world with viruses and everything else is he's shaking us he wants us to remember he wants us to go back to where we started back to purity he says when Ananias and Sapphira were dealt with back to the gate beautiful oh what a reproach it is to drift from God and countenance those acts that defile his name let those who name his name depart from sin keep their vessels pure for God I said God help me to do that today see that's accountability we've got to give an account so we've got to repent but the Rebbe said look at what you wants war in your heart and in your mind and in your life then go back to it what is the way back the way is the way of repentance if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance listen those of you their church members and those of you are watching tonight and those that are here we've been in in the church for a long time but he said if a sinner has to come to God by way of repentance in the lukewarm or backslider will have to repent that much more repent bring forth fruits meet for repentance prove it by your life said if you do not repent said God I will remove your lampstand certainly a church in that condition can't give light to the world it's light has turned to darkness God will then take away its faithful messenger and his faithful Shepherds and leave them to themselves and they will go on talking about Christianity but the rest of it repent quickly he says don't hesitate evidently emphasis did hesitate for her lifespan was not very long the glory of God decreased ever so rapidly was not long until the city was in ruins this glorious temple became a shapeless mass the land become a marsh inhabited by waterfowl the population was gone except for a few unbelievers in a squalid village there was not even one Christian left you imagine a place like Ephesus which if the book of Ephesians was these were people who were sitting there and they had the goods we might say we want an efficient Church brother branham even said we would be restored back to another efficient but there come a time when that efficient Church so it's not even one Christian left brother mastered the lamp was ripped from its place no it does not mean that she could not have repented it does not mean that we cannot repent we can but it must be quickly it must be a true heart cry to God in sorrow and then God will restore the glory shall come again oh my that's what we want so we have to give an account to God even though we're Christians for things we do in the flesh we give an account for that we give an account for the gifts that were given in Matthew 25 and verse 15 it says unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey so we know that different amounts are given to different people there's some people are given different opportunities than others some people are given different gifts and others some people are given a different a different type of ministry than others and and to us you know all that it does if you if you hear more you're responsible for more you're accountable for more the more that you hear the more you're accountable for when you hear less you're accountable for less so he gave to every man according to his several ability and he went in took his journey and we know the story how did he come and demanded an account of what they had done with what he had given them and desperations in 1963 brother brown said that Jack Moore said to me one time I'd hate to have to answer like you will have to at the day of the judgment he said God has put these people into your hands and you're gonna have to give an account for every one of them now think about that that's why he called out to Adam Adam where art thou he was the one in the original creation God put that garden in his hands and he said you're gonna have to give it account for everybody in the garden you get to name them you have to be accountable for so he says I'm gonna make you accountable God has put these people in your hands you're going to give an account for every one of them he said you're gonna answer for your ministry so that's been about 15 years ago maybe 18 since then I've been in desperation what will I do let me say only what you say Lord let me tell them what's the truth or don't say nothing oh how about a grip our hearts today let me tell them what's the truth oh don't say nothing it throws me in desperation but the Rebbe said someday I must stand yonder at the throne of God and give an account for my ministry give an account for these things that you've permitted me to do Lord in the midst of the people to declare the resurrection of the Lord Jesus I'm gonna be accountable but how much more messenger to the aged right so he has to give an account and that's why messengers many times are understood because they had to give an account zq had to be a watchman on the wall and so he had to do exactly what God said and he was misunderstood by the people because he had to give an account for what he would say he had to say it in a certain way and say only what God said and our prophet was the same way he said God he said I must answer for that Oh God burns zeal down into my heart more and more and wisdom that I might know how to lead two people to the Lord Jesus I say amen to that tonight you see the men with the biggest churches won't necessarily get the biggest rewards the people with the with the most greatest ministries won't necessarily have the greatest crowns but it'll be the ones who did the most with what they have right God gave you something he gave you a good mind or give you good hands to give you the ability to work whatever he gave you you give an account for that not for somebody else has not for what he gave somebody else but he gave you a gift and you give an account for that gift not for somebody else's so it'll be those who who stand there and and can give an account for each of the ones that they come in contact with now think about that you don't get a day off or moment off you know when you're on vacation you don't suddenly become unaccountable right when you're when you're not at church you don't suddenly become unaccountable to people or to god you're accountable and you'll be have to give an account for what you do in the ministry well though I'm saved and I believe God the God that saved me will keep me no matter what I do and that's a strong statement but I believe it I believe it doesn't matter what I do God will keep me he's not gonna lose me but I'll give it a count for what I do and I don't want to be embarrassed I don't want to stand up there and have to be embarrassed because of my ministry because I I took some time off or did something that wasn't right not not that I wouldn't rest but that I I misrepresented God to people because of things I was going through but now but the rest is but there will be a great general resurrection one of these days we'll all be called into the presence of God you say that's good for a preacher to have to give an account and a preacher is more accountable a messenger is more accountable but every one of us will be called into the presence of God we'll all be called into the presence of God to give an account for what we have done with what God gave to us what did he give to us Jesus Christ that's what he says every one of us will give an account for what we have done with what God gave to us Pilate had one moment in his life that mattered he had been probably to school all of his life and in the military to become what he was and had become the general counsel or the the governor of that state or that land that he was in and he stood there knows one moment in his life that mattered and that he was held into account for when he said I find no fault in him but they said crucify him anyway and he stood there and washed his hands from the blood of Jesus Christ but he could wash his hands he couldn't wash the stain off of his heart Pilate stood there you'll stand there be it be raised in that old body that he went down and he'd be raised in stand there at the judgment seat and have to answer for what he did with Jesus Christ but Pilate is emblematic of every one of us every one of us have to answer for what we did with Jesus Christ because we knew about it if we know who he is we have to answer for who he is Luke chapter 12 verse 47 says that servant which knew his Lord's will prepared not himself neither did according to his Will shall be beaten with many stripes he that knew not and didn't commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes Brendan whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required who men have committed much of him they will ask more now I want to take a few moments and I won't be extremely long tonight and some of you that thought you were coming to church tonight now you're sitting in your living room I know it's kind of disconcerting it is to me to to have to preach again like this but the Lord has some reason for it and so we have to remember that but but you know as we're sitting there as you're sitting there tonight or as you're here tonight I want you to think about who you're accountable to and why we're accountable to different kinds of people and the thing is we're accountable on different levels so parents are accountable for their children and we can say it this way children are accountable to their parents parents have a right to make taken account of their children right so you can say where were you what did you do you know and children have a certain responsibility to their parents but in Reverse the parents are accountable for their children right so the parents have the greater position of authority so we might say that there's some that have a thought we have authority over and there's others who have authority over us and on every level we're accountable both ways but it's like this so children are accountable to their parents but they're not accountable for their parents right it's not my children's fault what I do but it is my fault well they're little anyway to some still what they do I'm accountable for them right and but it doesn't go the other way they're accountable to me but not for me so we find a husband and a wife in a similar situation but not exactly a government and the governed right that the citizens of a nation are accountable in a certain way to one another into their government but not the way the government is to citizens an employee is accountable to his employer not to steal the staplers all right they say that and forgive me if any of you work at Dollar General but they say the greatest cause of theft at Dollar General is the people that work there that's that's the number-one cause of a favorite of loss at Dollar General is just the people that work there but you have to be accountable to who you work for or they're gonna make you accountable they'll you lose your job but your employer is accountable for you in a different way a congregation is accountable to a pastor and in some level but also a pastor is accountable to a congregation so I want to just look at these relationships tonight and see how we can be accountable to one another and what who we should be accountable to parents in Ephesians 6:1 it says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right so that means that if you're a child if you're living at home you're accountable to your parents but I will say this it doesn't end there because the Bible says honor your father and mother and the Lord for this is right and it doesn't end when you're grown because the Matthew 7 you can go read it we don't read it tonight for sake of time but it talks about the practice of Corbyn which is actually giving your parents a gift and saying it's enough now I'm done with you all right so they would take a sum of money and give it to the parents say this I'm buying you off for the rest of your life now I don't have to be accountable for what you do and whether you make it or not whether you live or not no that's not the way it works you might give them a million dollars today it doesn't make you unaccountable you still have to remember to honor your parents right those few of you who have parents here in the church you have to remember that you're still accountable and it's a shame what happens in this in this country sometimes because of our lack of accountability to our elders children are accountable in a different way it says that you father's provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord now so children are accountable in that they must treat their parents right they've got honor the father and mother but parents are accountable to not provoke their children so that is somebody we would be accountable for us the children if you have children to provoke them to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and I think he said Ye fathers because he knew we were prone to provoking our children not brother Joe but everybody else we fathers are prone to provoke our children and and when we do you know we tend to get a response and the Bible says provoke not your children to wrath don't make them angry needlessly right but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord always keep in mind what your job is what how you're accountable to your children so you're accountable to your children that makes sense you're accountable for them but also to God but also accountable to them they have a right to hold you to the scripture maybe not to their interpretation of it but but they have a right to hold you to that scripture that's absolutely true now and you have a right to hold them on to honor your father and mother a husband so there's an accountability that a wife has to a husband and a husband has a right to to hold his wife accountable in this way like why she was being subjection to your own husband's that if any obey not the word they are also made without the word be won by the conversation or the lifestyle of the wife that's a strong scripture and it's one that we don't like to hear today but then in the message we could take that and turn it around it also says the wife likewise she husband's right because we like that one it said likewise G wiseness is likewise G husband's dwell with them according to knowledge so again you see the accountability going both ways so the husband is accountable for the wife just like Adam was Adam where art thou it's his responsibility if the buck stops here it means it's my I'm accountable for it right but it also means that the husbands have an expectation that their wife would be in subjection and the wife has an expectation that the husband will not abuse that authority and well with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so it's almost like he's saying God is saying through his his messenger Paul he's saying or Peter rather if you do this if you don't do this your prayers are gonna be hindered if you don't treat your wife right I'm not going to listen to your prayers that's a strong statement isn't it those of us that are married need to listen to that so there's an accountability and especially in the marriage relationship it's it's both ways so Paul says in 1st Corinthians 7 for the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife you're accountable to one another even for your in natural things and we could go into depth in that but I think you understand you know that's the only place within the marriage covenant is the only place where there is a right to complete surrender of the body and the mind to one another within the boundaries of the Word of God it's within that marriage covenant and it's not a partnership I despised the word partner for my wife what we have is not a partnership it is a oneness she's me and I'm a hurry a partnership I could hide things from her I could have another part of my life that's not in the partnership right if you had a partnership made a partnership went open the feed store and with a partner you both could be there but the rest of your life is not accountable to that only what you do at the feed store and people treat a marriage as a partnership for everything they do in the marriage they're accountable for but if they leave and go out here if they're not accountable to it know you're one if you leave you take her with you if you leave you take him with you and so it's not a partnership it's not 50/50 sometimes it's a hundred to domestic and it has to go both ways when you get married you have to commit that you're willing to do 100 percent of everything that needs to be done to stay married and that's quite a commitment but there's times it takes that but then it'll swing back the other way and so there's times when you have to take up for the weakness of someone else but that's the oneness of it and there's no amount of fear or in this relationship specifically there's no amount of of holding the scripture over your wife's head that will ever make you her submit to you there's no amount of holding the scripture of your husband's head that'll ever make him love you but there's got to be love if there's not love there it's never gonna work only love can do that as quoted by Martin Luther King hate can't do that only love can do that well only love can keep a marriage together no amount of fear will ever make you accountable to one another I spent a little extra time on that because I believe that it's needful it I know I need it because we have to remember what we're doing we're not we're not separate we don't do things separately now if I wanted to have my own bank account that'd be fine but she has a right to know what's in it an absolute right to know how much money I make and what's in it because one of the things that I found is that what happens is when people start separating in their finances then they begin to separate in their oneness and pretty soon it's okay to do just whatever as long as I do it on my own time know my time is hers and her time is mine even when it comes to the Lord because Paul says the married man has to think of the things of his wife so there's times brother branham was going to move to Arizona but he waited until his wife was ready there's a reason for that because he was accountable to his wife and maybe I'm going out on a limb because I'm not preaching to very many here tonight but you just hang with me I feel like I'm just really really giving you the the business tonight you know you only got a few sitting here but but you know there's there's a level at which you're more accountable to your spouse than you are to God and in this sense that you are so accountable to that person that brother Baron said if you sinned against that person you'd want you'd have to repeat to them first because you send so much against God is against them because that marriage relationship has to be right so that's why Peter says God won't even hear your prayers unless you're one and that that's hard on all of us but we need to we need to take a good look at where we live and how we live now but embarrassed I wouldn't this be some sort of family to live in if I gather my family around me and I'd say lookee here missus Brenham you want to realize that you're mrs. William Branham thou shalt not have any other husbands while I'm gone don't you make eyes at any other man all these things don't you flirt at all if you do when I come back I'm gonna divorce you she'd turn around saying I'm a good man I want to tell you something also thou shalt not take out any other woman while you're gone thou shalt not do this or that if out if you do just consider yourself divorced when you come home he said now wouldn't that be a loving family C no if I really love her though I believe if I did make a mistake and slip and do something wrong I believe she'd forgive me for it because she loves me and if she did I believe I'd forgive her for it certainly because I love her but if I loved her like that as long as I love her like that she has no worry though she would forgive me I wouldn't hurt her for nothing I feel the guiltiest guy in the world I couldn't wait for the minute I'd tell her about what I'd done because I loved her well how are they held accountable they were held accountable to one another by love that's how we're held accountable to God because we love it love holds us accountable to its word when fear won't do it fear of Hell won't do it fear of losing your inheritance won't do it but it's love that doesn't we're accountable to government Romans 13 and 1 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers no power but of God the powers that be are ordained of God that's hard to remember sometimes and especially for them in that day because he was talking about Nero the powers that be in that day was Nero and those under him who was perhaps perhaps the most anti-christian government that ever was on the face of the earth was the government of that day and Jesus said give to Caesar what Caesar's the most anti-christian government the most anti-christian system possible and Jesus said give to Caesar what is Caesar's but to God what is God's but there's also responsibility of the government we'll look at that in Deuteronomy chapter 17 and verse 16 because this works not just in government and natural governments but also in the church and it even works in our homes because just because we have the ability to take certain prerogatives don't mean that we should write Deuteronomy 1716 but he shall not multiply horses to himself now he's talking about when Moses knew that one day they'd want a king he said when you do get a king he said here's how the king should act so there were limitations on what a king could do he shall not multiply horses to himself nor caused the people to return to Egypt so in other words he shouldn't have a fleet of Cadillacs right and he shouldn't make the people go back into nomination list and say doesn't believe the message no more if we just take it and put it in our perspective he said to the end that he should multiply horses for as much as the Lord said unto you you shall his fourth return no more that way neither shall he multiply wives to himself his heart turned out away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests of the Levites and it shall be with him he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the Lord his God and to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them why was it the king was accountable to God and he was accountable for what he did to the people and for the people now he said that he have not his heart be not lifted up above his brethren i watch so he needs to make sure that he keeps himself in the word so that he doesn't get a big head right that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren that he turned out aside from the commandment to the right-hander's for the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of Israel so we see the responsibilities of a king or we could say of a pastor or of a of a person who's in a position of authority a husband in the home there's a responsibility there to those that are governed there's a responsibility employer hasn't Titus chapter 2 and verse 9 will hurry through this Titus chapter 2 and verse 9 and exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again oh that's been hard for me over the years I worked for a lot of years in an office and that not answering again is hard but there's times you know I remember some years ago in an office I was sitting in an office and I was so mad at the way people were doing stuff and I had a co-worker a young lady that was sitting on the other side of the office we had cubicles and she was sitting where she could hear me and I was mad I wasn't saying anything wrong or anything like that but I was just she could she knew I was upset because of the way people did things and they just made my job harder and seemed like they did it on purpose and I got really upset and she was not a Christian and she knew I was a preacher and she was sitting over there and after a while she collared at me she said would Jesus have said that and I felt pretty low I got up the next that Sunday morning after a couple days it was Sunday and I got up in front of the church at 4:00 the Ivies in work and apologized for my attitude even though they hadn't known about it but I felt so bad about it I thought you know that's not that's not the Spirit of Christ and she knew enough about it to know that but we'll all get up there'll be seasons that we have but he said not answering again so we have and it were accountable to God for the way we treat our employer think about that but the employer is also accountable for the employee and you masters do the same things unto them he says forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is their respective persons with him we'll look again as we look at these relationships with one another and in life you look at a pastor and and that's something that we've just recently come in here and it's something that's on my heart that I have to be accountable and and we have to be accountable to one another and he says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls when he's speaking of secular Authority and also in the church he said as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so he says obey them that have the rule over you and again that speaks of secular authority but I believe it also applies to the church now Paul makes a strange statement and I'll just say this before moving on he says I am jealous over you with godly jealousy and that first word is different from the second word if you go back in the original the first word jealous is actually I have a deal for you but he says with godly jealousy and that word is actually jealousy like between a husband and wife it's jealousy he said for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ and it really struck me because it made him accountable for their virginity if we could say it that way he was accountable for their purity he was accountable that when they were presented to Christ and so he would sell us about it about keeping false doctrine away and all of these things because he says I having espoused her and engaged you to one husband now he was not jealous that someone else might take his place but he was jealous that some other man I take Christ's place are you with me today I have espoused you to one husband I don't want anybody to take his place so I'm jealous for him and Paul is alluding to the the practice that was exemplified by John the Baptist when he says I'm the one that stands by the bridegroom I'm the friend of the bridegroom so I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy because not because I might be replaced but because you might replace him you might go find some other lover some other husband Oh church if we can only recognize that's why we're so zealous for the word it's not because you might change preachers but it's so it's because you might change God or change who how you approach God and there's only one way that we can come to God and that same God has provided way and gods provided place which is Jesus Christ the congregation the pastor is responsible is accountable to God for the congregation but he's also accountable to the congregation feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly constraint works both ways he's saying don't be made to serve the people you know any also he's also saying do not force the people to listen that's hard to remember because Moses took the rod and he struck the rock he said you rebels he said I'll show you and God didn't let him go in the promised land for it because they're not God's sheep or not to be led by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre money but of a ready mind because that's that's what's in your heart and your mind to do neither as being lords over God's heritage but being examples to the flock we've talked about that before that's behaving in a haughty domineering manner as though you had dominion over the conscience of the people the word heritage is literally God's portions God's portions he has different portions everywhere there's portions here tonight portions listening in portions in other places I'm not responsible for the other portions I'm accountable for this portion and so I have to be an example to this portion I'm not a lord or a bishop over God's portions I'm accountable for this one first Peter five four and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you should receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away and this is the benefit of accountability you see accountability brings benefits in our lives and it's a big deal in corporate circles because they realize it brings benefits to a business if you can hold a leader accountable and the workers accountable and then it brings a great benefit that the business can thrive but we realized when we can be accountable in our homes in our marriages in our church if we can be accountable to God it does bring cooperation it does cause trust to be formed but it also brings eternal rewards he says when the chief Shepherd shall appear you'll receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away but the brand says yes I can see that God is going to give a special reward to his messengers and he's talking about those seven messengers that were in his hand he said who have faithfully discharged the responsibility he has placed upon them if they have received the revelation of the word for that age and faithfully preached in their day and lived what they preach they will receive a great reward 2nd Timothy 4:7 Paul is himself anticipating that reward he said I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith that seems like a bold thing to say but Paul could look back at his life and say I didn't know he served God but when I did I served him with all of my heart I made mistakes many times but but I always followed the will of God and I repented when I made those mistakes when ever was revealed to me I followed God I fought a good fight sure I got bloodied sometimes but it was a good fight I never just gave in I have finished my course I have kept the faith his fourth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing there's a reward waiting and I want you to notice as we're closing in just a moment I think that's the third time I've said that I get three every service but you go back to Jesus as he nears the end of his life and you see Paul they're nearing the end of his ministry begins to get retrospective about his ministry and he says I've fought a good fight I've kept the faith Jesus gets near the end of his earthly ministry and he says while I was with him in the world I kept them in thy name now it says if his ministry now is being over that God is holding him to attempt he's walking up to the Father and he's saying here's Peter here's Andrew here's Thomas Dowling Thomas but he was still a disciple here's Philip here's Matthew here's all the disciples they're all yours I have kept them in thy name when we think about that we looking back around our home lives we say well maybe if I'd have witness more to this person they'd have done better maybe if I'd have done this state have done better but listen he said I have kept him in thy name those that thou gave us to me I have kept and none of them is lost none of them is lost you realize that when Paul says I have another body already waiting in the heavens that God does not have some kind of machine that does away with the bodies that don't get used you would think about that every word body every word bride person if you can say it that way every member of the word bride will come to a word body there's no ability to do away with the word body he says so he says none of them is lost with the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled so he said every one of them I'm gonna give an account for and I'm also given a going to give an account for the Serpent's eat among us and the only reason well I'd love to be able to say this when I get to the end of my ministry but I'm afraid I probably couldn't I'm thankful that he could because he says none of them is lost with the son of perdition the only person who did not make it was one who's given every opportunity to make it but he was the son of perdition from the beginning now listen he was so accountable with Judas and see we think we we say well I'm accountable to them because they treat me right no we're accountable to everybody we meet everybody God puts in our realm of influence everybody that he puts in the church good or bad smart or dumb I'm glad the Devils included because that includes me but everyone he puts in the church we're responsible for them everyone who's put in the sphere of the influence of our life we are accountable for them some of them won't make it but let it be because that's what was in their heart at the end when it comes to the time when Judas comes up with the light tone judgment did imagine what that will be like because he'll speak to Jesus directly remember the Saints will judge to the earth but Judas was with Jesus and Jesus will say to him didn't I treat you like the rest of the disciples think about that for a minute didn't I treat you like the rest of them at the Last Supper they didn't even know who the one was even when Jesus identified directly that Judas was the one they didn't believe it because Jesus never treated him any differently even knowing who he was and so he'll stand there and say did not give you a gift to preach did not treat you the same as all the other disciples did not do everything right in front of you and give you such an example to follow that you had a pastor who never sinned see you won't ever be able to say that but Judas could say that but he did what was in his heart do you realize that Jesus did not lose one of them and he will not lose one of us and I got thinking about that but David is he do that because if I look but Joe if my own ministry and I look at what I can do I can see that some would be lost because they just couldn't put up with me but somehow I'm so thankful for the grace of God somehow with all the problems of ministry and all the problems God will send enough preachers into your life that you can be reached he'll send enough ministry you may have a bad one after a bad one after bad one but there will be somebody who come to your life that'll preach the truth because God is accountable to every one of his seed and he is accountable for every one of his feet he said none of them is lost and he does that not through one person so you can't reach everybody brother going through my ministry but he does it through an entire body so somehow through the body of Christ that is on the earth today every child of God will be saved do you ever think about that because when the last one comes in we'll go home and somehow every one of them won't be reached how does he do it he's not doing it just through osmosis or through the air he speaks through men and somehow God has enough men on the earth today that'll preach the gospel somehow he's got enough people in the earth today that can live the gospel or hope you're with me today he is so accountable to those that are in his bride those are in his mind that he will not lose one of them and he has to send preacher after preacher after preacher they will be found if one don't get them and another one don't get them there will be a time and a place when they will be found because none of them is lost except those who were meant to be that's why when we get to heaven the Bible says that the Saints cast the crowns at his feet because we couldn't do it we weren't even worthy of the rewards that we got because we couldn't do it without him he's the one that makes it work well I'm looking forward to that day I'm looking forward to that I believe in that I'm not one you know there's a lot of things we spiritual eyes but I don't believe in that's necessarily a spiritual thing I don't know exactly how it will happen but somehow we're going to cast our crowns at his feet whatever rewards that we earned be cast at his feet but the band tells the story if the musicians want to go ahead and come he tells the story about an old an old preacher named Sam and the old preacher had preached for the Lord all of these years and he finally got down to his deathbed and the people come to honor him and and he had he fell into it like a trance and he come back out as he says he's going coming in going out they said Sam what did you see what's on the other side he said well I thought I'd just come in the gate they just let me in said I was standing there and said one of the angels run up and said Sam come over now to receive your robe in your crown he said robe and Crown I don't want no robe and Crown just let me stand there and look at him because he makes it work because as much as I could be as I am accountable for you and I can be accountable I'm still human but he makes it work somehow the grace of God made causes the right person to come at the right time to speak to that soul sit don't talk to me about a robe and Crown I don't wonder a robe and Crown just then let me stand there and look at him for a thousand years that's enough robe and Crown I'm so glad that every one of us will have that opportunity but guest our crowns at his feet say thou art worthy thou art worthy because we couldn't do it on our own aren't you grateful for that today bow our hips if you know that old song when he reached on his hand for me Heavenly Father were so grateful or tonight's been a little different and none of us expected for it to be this way I didn't know until about three or four o'clock this afternoon we'd be doing this but so grateful Lord that you are accountable somehow you're accountable for the way this service goes I'm grateful for that Lord even for Judas you give an account for why he did what he did he was the son of perdition Oh God I thank you for that or I pray you would help us to rest in that tonight but as we look at these areas of our life and we see Lord different relationships in our life I pray you'd help us to be accountable to reflect you in that Lord as we reflect you in responsibility as we reflect you in all of these other things that we've talked about and faithfulness and we also wish reflects you and accountability that when the time comes for us to give an account for our lives that will stand there and say the time I gave my life to you Lord I made many mistakes but every one of them has been repent enough I turned quickly back to your life and your throne and I told everyone that I could about your love I displayed that love in my life may it be so Lord and we'd be able to say on that they may we not be embarrassed when we get there well I was hardly every Church I hardly ever did what I was supposed to do but but I made it oh God may we be able to stand there say Lord I want a crown so I can give him back to you I want to I want to see a reward like Paul said there's a great crown there's a great reward waiting but I want it so I can give it back a pretty good granite lord help us to set our mind on eternal things to anticipate eternal rewards so that we can receive earthly rewards those will come Lord but we want to anticipate eternal rewards beyond anything beyond the benefits of accountability that come naturally Lord may we have the benefits spiritually I pray thank you for these people Lord that have common Lord those that many that are watching tonight by streaming and those that'll hear later Lord I pray you'd help them they realize they're accountable for what they've heard I may not have set it all right but somehow you are accountable to your word and you'll make it sink down into their heart in the right way I pray you grant it now heal every sick person touch everyone Lord we pray in Jesus name protect us Lord from all things Jesus amen amen
