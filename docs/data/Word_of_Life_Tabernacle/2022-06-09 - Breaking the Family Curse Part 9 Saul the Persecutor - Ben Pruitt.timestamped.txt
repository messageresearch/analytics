[47:08] we ask these things in your precious
[47:10] name
[47:11] amen
[47:12] amen do you love the lord this evening
[47:15] i know i asked you that a lot but i
[47:17] trust the answer will always be from the
[47:19] heart yes
[47:21] yes we love the lord amen genesis 49
[47:24] 27
[47:25] and acts chapter 9
[47:27] and verse 1 as we continue speaking
[47:30] on breaking the family curse
[47:35] we're finally getting down to the
[47:39] breaking part
[47:41] we've talked a lot about the curse and
[47:43] we're going to talk a little bit more
[47:44] about that but
[47:46] there is a way to break it but it's not
[47:49] by human effort
[47:50] but by the grace of god
[47:52] genesis 49 27 while you're turning there
[47:55] i
[47:56] uh
[47:57] had been listening to paradox the
[48:00] message brother branham preached in
[48:02] december 1961
[48:04] and if you get a chance to go listen to
[48:06] that this week if you're just looking
[48:07] for a tape or or a sermon to listen to
[48:10] and get a chance to listen to that i
[48:11] think he'd do you some good he preached
[48:13] it several times but particularly the
[48:15] one
[48:16] that he preached there in jeffersonville
[48:18] in december 1961 i while listening to
[48:21] that i was inspired to something else
[48:23] completely different from this
[48:25] that we may speak on on sunday morning
[48:27] so it would go with that as well
[48:29] and then on sunday afternoon i i want to
[48:32] take a little time and explain to you
[48:34] maybe more in a sermon than just telling
[48:36] you but
[48:37] why we're are going uh
[48:39] on this mission trip that we plan on
[48:41] going out on on the end of the month
[48:43] and why we're doing it and
[48:45] and you know you do things and sometimes
[48:47] it's hard you can't explain everything
[48:49] but
[48:50] i i know that uh
[48:52] whenever we leave we don't want to be
[48:54] gone for long we like to be here with
[48:56] you but there are
[48:58] other sheep which are not of this fold
[48:59] and so we want to reach out as well when
[49:02] we have that opportunity and when the
[49:04] lord leads us to do that and and i
[49:06] believe that will be a blessing to you
[49:08] as well so we'll kind of try to explain
[49:10] ourselves on
[49:11] uh um well i will anyway i won't let
[49:14] joel have that opportunity but
[49:17] i'll do that anyway on sunday i'll be
[49:19] preaching to you a lot this month and
[49:21] you just pray for me and then next month
[49:22] i won't be preaching to you much at all
[49:24] because we'll be gone to egypt and then
[49:26] when we come back we'll have those
[49:27] meetings so remember the meetings july
[49:29] 14th
[49:30] through 17th and and be praying for
[49:33] those
[49:34] a lot of people coming in i've rented i
[49:36] know several folks have rented airbnbs
[49:39] and stuff in the neighborhood and
[49:40] and are coming in to be with us and so
[49:43] we're happy uh the lord willing will
[49:45] have those meetings and just be as best
[49:48] hosts we can be and also but we want to
[49:50] receive a blessing too and so i'm
[49:52] looking forward to that right after we
[49:54] get back
[49:55] all right uh we reading from genesis 49
[49:59] 27 benjamin
[50:01] shall raven as a wolf
[50:03] benjamin shall raven as a wolf
[50:06] in the morning he shall devour the prey
[50:08] and at night he shall divide
[50:10] the spoil
[50:12] and then acts chapter 9 and verse 1
[50:15] and saul
[50:17] yet breathing out threatenings and
[50:19] slaughter against the disciples of the
[50:21] lord went unto the high priest
[50:23] and desired of him letters to damascus
[50:26] to the synagogues that if he found
[50:28] any of this way whether they were men or
[50:30] women he might bring them bound unto
[50:32] jerusalem
[50:33] and as he journeyed he came near
[50:35] damascus and suddenly there shined round
[50:37] about him a light from heaven and he
[50:40] fell to the earth and heard a voice
[50:41] saying unto him saul
[50:44] so why persecutest thou
[50:47] me
[50:48] he said who art thou lord and the lord
[50:51] said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it
[50:54] is hard for thee to kick against
[50:57] the pricks i pray the lord would add his
[50:59] blessing to the word you may be seated
[51:01] this evening
[51:14] it came off
[51:16] i was trying to get the cap off the
[51:18] bottle
[51:19] i'm not very smart
[51:20] sometimes lighten up this evening a
[51:23] little bit can you all smile at me my
[51:25] goodness
[51:27] that's a tough crowd are you all tired
[51:28] tonight

[51:32] on this roof are tired today i brother
[51:35] isaac i feel so sorry for you i'm sorry
[51:39] i called joel yesterday and he said oh
[51:41] i'm in the truck watching the guys work
[51:42] i said yes but how it is
[51:48] the scripture said benjamin will raven
[51:50] and that word means to terror to rend
[51:53] as a wolf a few years ago in 2017 there
[51:56] was some attacks in israel by wolves
[51:59] of the same type that would have been in
[52:01] that day
[52:03] that they would have been talking about
[52:05] woes in israel
[52:06] and there are still was in israel today
[52:09] and
[52:09] they were attacking human beings they
[52:12] were actually attacking
[52:13] uh infants and babies they were they
[52:15] would they would scout out an area a
[52:17] wolf pack would scout out some people
[52:19] who were camping or some bedouins in the
[52:21] desert or something like that and
[52:23] they would begin to
[52:25] watch them and they would try to make
[52:26] off with the infants or the babies that
[52:28] were there
[52:29] and it became increasingly common and
[52:32] they began to realize that the animals
[52:34] were not playing and they were not
[52:36] feeling threatened but they were
[52:38] actually hunting for small humans they
[52:41] realized they recognized them as prey
[52:43] and that's not normally that's not
[52:45] normal for
[52:47] animals usually even a
[52:49] snake will actually
[52:51] will only defend itself when threatened
[52:53] they won't hunt humans normally
[52:56] but a wolf if they're in the right frame
[52:58] of mind will do that and and actually
[53:00] they found that a wolf will the nature
[53:03] of a wolf is to kill anything that is
[53:05] weak it's to attack
[53:07] anything weaker than it is and so they
[53:09] found in yellowstone
[53:11] national park that sometimes there'll be
[53:13] a herd of elk and they'll get in the
[53:15] deep snow and they'll be walking through
[53:17] the deep snow and trying to trying to
[53:19] make it to be the middle of the winter
[53:20] and they're just about dead tired all of
[53:22] them and and the wolves will find them
[53:24] and they they'll kill what they need to
[53:26] eat and then they'll keep killing
[53:28] and they'll slaughter an entire herd of
[53:30] elk rather than just kill what they need
[53:32] like most animals would and the reason
[53:35] for that is because
[53:37] the nature of a wolf is if it perceives
[53:39] weakness it'll go after it now we know
[53:42] that's not the nature of a christian
[53:44] because christ the spirit of christ is
[53:46] to help those that are weak how many
[53:48] know that tonight
[53:49] but that's the nature of of a wolf and
[53:52] that was the nature
[53:53] of the benjamin the nature that run in
[53:55] this family's train if we could see it
[53:58] that way was to attack was to was to
[54:00] rend was to tear and when they smell
[54:03] blood like a shark wheel a wolf is like
[54:05] that they get excited by blood and they
[54:07] go after another weak animal and as long
[54:10] as they perceive them to not be a threat
[54:12] they'll kill them
[54:14] and so that's the nature
[54:16] that drove king saul if we go back to
[54:19] the to the old testament that drove king
[54:21] saul to persecute david you'll find
[54:23] after we left saul that he had he tried
[54:26] to uh throw a javelin at david and and
[54:29] jonathan came back and interceded to
[54:31] saul for david and he said hey he's
[54:33] never done anything to you you've got no
[54:35] reason
[54:36] to be like this around him and so saul
[54:38] said you know that's true and he
[54:40] repented of what he did and i believe
[54:42] saul was sincere in that yeah
[54:44] but he just had this nature and y'all
[54:46] bear with me tonight i i'm having a
[54:48] little bit of a problem with congestion
[54:49] so i'm trying tonight just as hard as i
[54:52] can that's why i didn't wear a tie too i
[54:54] know you're shocked but
[54:55] but i can't i have to be able to breathe
[54:57] so it's one or the others so
[55:00] but it's the nature that
[55:02] drove king saul to do this and so
[55:04] jonathan intercedes to saul and saul
[55:06] being i think sincere he says well let's
[55:09] let's get david back in and he repented
[55:11] of what he did and so in first samuel 19
[55:14] 6 saul hearken unto the voice of
[55:16] jonathan and saul swear
[55:18] lord liveth he shall not be slain and
[55:21] jonathan called david and jonathan
[55:22] showed him all those things and jonathan
[55:25] brought david to saul and he was in his
[55:27] presence as end times past
[55:30] and verse 8 and there was war again
[55:32] now watch everything was okay for a
[55:34] while until there was another war and
[55:36] david went out and fought with the
[55:38] philistines and slew them with a great
[55:40] slaughter and they fled from him so so
[55:42] saul king saul looks at this and he says
[55:45] now here they are here he goes again
[55:48] he's going out and having these big
[55:49] meetings and doing these things and i
[55:51] just can't stand that and so he began to
[55:53] get jealous again and
[55:55] and he said and the evil spirit from the
[55:57] lord was upon saul as he said in his
[55:59] house with his javelin in his hand and
[56:01] david
[56:02] played with his hand and saul sought to
[56:05] smite david even to the wall with the
[56:07] javelin but he slipped away out of
[56:09] saul's presence and he smote the javelin
[56:11] into the wall and david fled and escaped
[56:14] that night
[56:16] now if we could fast forward now think
[56:18] about this
[56:19] we fast forward a thousand years
[56:24] now let that sink in for a minute
[56:27] it's more than a
[56:29] a thousand years later
[56:34] see time doesn't change
[56:37] the strain in a family
[56:41] and that's why you have a child
[56:44] sometimes and he looks different maybe
[56:46] like little henry looks a little bit
[56:47] different from the parents and you look
[56:49] at that and think where did that come
[56:51] from and and then as a child you begin
[56:53] to look at them and you begin to realize
[56:55] well i knew great uncle so and so or
[56:57] maybe i'll talk to my mother sometimes
[56:59] she'll say you know you look like
[57:01] your great-uncle or great-great-uncle
[57:03] that i never met
[57:05] and but i look more like them than i do
[57:06] like my father because some of those
[57:09] genes skip generations and come on down
[57:12] and that's why every generation has to
[57:14] have their own revival
[57:17] right you don't you don't pass on
[57:19] christian genes
[57:21] to your children
[57:23] right they have to be the gene of god
[57:25] themselves
[57:27] and i believe that they are but that's
[57:29] not passed on naturally they have to
[57:31] receive the holy ghost just like we do
[57:34] they've got to sit in an atmosphere just
[57:35] like we did
[57:37] they've got to be be born by the spirit
[57:40] of god they've got to have a revival and
[57:42] that's why i'm never against the revival
[57:44] among the young people because every
[57:46] generation's got to have it
[57:48] they've got to have it we had to have it
[57:50] they have to have it
[57:52] and so but when you have a strain and a
[57:54] family you can't say well eventually
[57:56] we'll get over it
[57:58] someday it'll just it'll just pass on
[58:00] out
[58:01] well maybe it will and maybe it won't
[58:04] because some of these genes that are so
[58:06] strong
[58:07] and a family will just continue
[58:10] on down
[58:11] until finally they'll pop up years and
[58:13] years later and you'll see things in
[58:15] your children that maybe you didn't even
[58:17] struggle with but other people in your
[58:18] family did
[58:20] so eventually we'll get over it doesn't
[58:22] work there's got to be a paradox in your
[58:25] life
[58:27] a paradox in your life
[58:29] nothing else will break the curse
[58:32] but a paradox
[58:35] brother adam in in the message paradox
[58:37] he begins and he begins to explain i
[58:40] only have one quote tonight but it's
[58:41] quite lengthy
[58:43] but he said according to webster a
[58:44] paradox is something that seems
[58:47] incredible
[58:48] but it's true
[58:51] it's something that seems incredible
[58:54] but it's true
[58:55] therefore a paradox then would be the
[58:57] same as a miracle
[59:00] right now
[59:01] now let's back up for a minute what
[59:04] happened saul
[59:05] king's soul
[59:07] persecuted david
[59:09] and that same spirit a thousand years
[59:12] later
[59:14] caused saul
[59:15] who was named after king saul you watch
[59:18] what you name your children
[59:21] right because it does matter
[59:24] and i don't think a child necessarily
[59:26] has to be named a biblical name but you
[59:28] name them something good
[59:30] right you don't want to name them
[59:31] something that that's bad and because
[59:34] brother branham said it mattered you say
[59:35] well i can prove to you it didn't matter
[59:37] well brother brown said it does so
[59:39] i'll i'll take his word on that and and
[59:42] he explained that there was much meaning
[59:44] in that in the name elvis and ricky and
[59:46] names like that and
[59:47] and so and today we've got all kinds of
[59:49] names but uh but now
[59:52] uh a paradox then
[59:54] has got to happen now he they named him
[59:56] after king saul and and here he was
[59:59] brought up and all of these things and
[1:00:01] we'll go through that in just a little
[1:00:02] bit
[1:00:03] and yet he does the same thing that king
[1:00:05] saul did
[1:00:06] without even trying to he doesn't have
[1:00:08] to try to do that he's got that same
[1:00:10] spirit those same genes that same he's a
[1:00:13] benjamite
[1:00:15] it's still carrying on all those years
[1:00:17] later don't think you're just gonna let
[1:00:18] it say well i got this little thing in
[1:00:20] my life but someday someday it'll be
[1:00:22] gone i'll get old i'll uh something
[1:00:24] there'll be something that'll take it
[1:00:25] away no deal with it
[1:00:28] take care of it now
[1:00:31] because it's not just gonna gonna get
[1:00:33] better
[1:00:35] hey man if there's sin in your life deal
[1:00:37] with it
[1:00:39] if there's bitterness in your heart deal
[1:00:41] with it
[1:00:42] that's why the scripture says today is
[1:00:44] the day of salvation don't wait till
[1:00:46] tomorrow
[1:00:47] deal with it right now
[1:00:50] deal with it if you have an unbelieving
[1:00:52] spirit if there's something in you
[1:00:53] questioning the message of the hour
[1:00:55] don't wait till you become a preacher
[1:00:58] don't wait until you until you become a
[1:01:01] deacon
[1:01:02] deal with it now
[1:01:05] make sure you have that crisis moment
[1:01:08] make sure you meet god on the backside
[1:01:09] of the desert now you need to deal with
[1:01:12] it
[1:01:13] because just putting it off it only gets
[1:01:15] worse
[1:01:18] now a paradox again has been he said
[1:01:20] would be the same as a miracle a paradox
[1:01:22] when something that seems like it just
[1:01:24] couldn't be
[1:01:25] the knowledge of the human mind it's
[1:01:26] altogether incredible but yet it's
[1:01:29] proven true
[1:01:31] now a miracle would be the same thing
[1:01:33] for a miracle cannot be explained he
[1:01:36] said a miracle is something that happens
[1:01:38] you cannot explain it that makes it a
[1:01:40] paradox it's incredible but yet it's the
[1:01:42] truth he said now people today a lot of
[1:01:45] modernists believe the days of miracles
[1:01:47] are past they don't believe there is
[1:01:49] such a thing as a miracle
[1:01:51] yet i believe that the world is full of
[1:01:53] miracles
[1:01:54] i wonder what our life would be like if
[1:01:56] we looked at the world like that
[1:01:58] the world is full of miracles
[1:02:01] he said i believe the paradox is
[1:02:03] constantly
[1:02:05] he said for instance i believe that
[1:02:07] every born-again member
[1:02:09] of the body of christ how many
[1:02:10] born-again members of the body of christ
[1:02:12] do we have
[1:02:13] he said every amen that includes you
[1:02:16] that includes me every member of the
[1:02:19] born-again body of christ is a paradox
[1:02:22] in themselves
[1:02:24] amen he said i believe each one of you
[1:02:26] methodist and presbyterian and lutheran
[1:02:28] that never had experienced the baptism
[1:02:30] of the holy spirit was in some formal
[1:02:33] church that did not believe in the
[1:02:34] genuine new birth well i don't want to
[1:02:36] ever be like that
[1:02:37] i want to be a church on fire not a
[1:02:39] formal church
[1:02:41] he said it has now received the baptism
[1:02:42] of the holy ghost is the perfect example
[1:02:45] of a paradox
[1:02:46] because something happened to you that
[1:02:49] changed your whole being and anyone
[1:02:52] could look at that and know what a
[1:02:54] paradox is a miracle
[1:02:57] amen so he goes further he said unless
[1:02:59] that happens you cannot be a christian
[1:03:03] there must be a paradox for you to
[1:03:05] become a christian
[1:03:07] because no one can change your spirit in
[1:03:09] a man
[1:03:10] and give him a new birth outside of god
[1:03:13] and i've been dealing with some things
[1:03:15] even as a pastor and some things in my
[1:03:17] own mind and my own heart and i've been
[1:03:19] dealing with some things and as i begin
[1:03:20] to think about them by the day i begin
[1:03:22] to realize that there's some things that
[1:03:24] i can't change outside of being able to
[1:03:27] deal within the word if a person is not
[1:03:30] able to deal within the boundaries of
[1:03:31] the word
[1:03:32] then that you can't really change the
[1:03:34] way that they're thinking
[1:03:36] and on some level counseling you can
[1:03:39] counsel someone but if they're not born
[1:03:41] again
[1:03:42] that counseling can only go so far
[1:03:44] it can only help so much at some point
[1:03:46] you reach a point where you just can't
[1:03:47] do any more
[1:03:48] because you can't change the spirit in a
[1:03:50] man
[1:03:52] you can't make them do right
[1:03:54] or a woman or a boy or a girl you can't
[1:03:56] make you can't change them you can sit
[1:03:57] there and tell them and as a pastor you
[1:03:59] can tell them somebody even that you
[1:04:01] have confidence in but if they're
[1:04:02] convinced that it's not right or that it
[1:04:04] is right they may have confidence in you
[1:04:06] and they'll sit there and you'll tell
[1:04:08] them this is what you need to do and you
[1:04:09] just won't do it because there you can't
[1:04:12] change the spirit
[1:04:14] but if a person gets the new birth
[1:04:16] they'll follow the word
[1:04:18] right and then you can guide them
[1:04:19] they'll be guided to be able to be led
[1:04:21] by the ministry and so sometimes
[1:04:23] and brother john beduca was here with us
[1:04:25] and brother john's a good pastor he he
[1:04:27] deals with his church in that way and
[1:04:29] and he was telling me he said you know
[1:04:31] he said there's some times that you just
[1:04:33] have to pray
[1:04:34] he said there's some things that you
[1:04:36] can't talk somebody out of
[1:04:38] when somebody gets a spirit on him he
[1:04:39] said sometimes you just need to pray and
[1:04:42] pray earnestly for that person
[1:04:44] and so that that's many times true
[1:04:46] because and sometimes if we get the deal
[1:04:48] and sometimes you get deal with your
[1:04:49] children you think well i i'm just
[1:04:51] there's nothing i can say and that's
[1:04:52] probably true there's nothing i can say
[1:04:54] there's nothing i can do but you can
[1:04:56] pray
[1:04:57] and prayer doesn't maybe change things
[1:04:59] today it might but it might change
[1:05:01] things 20 years from now if the lord
[1:05:04] carries
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:07] so prayer does change things
[1:05:09] just not in our timetable because god
[1:05:11] knows
[1:05:12] when the right season is for that seed
[1:05:15] to come to light
[1:05:17] so no one can change a spirit in a man
[1:05:19] and give him new birth outside of god
[1:05:22] god alone is the only one can do it
[1:05:26] it's a miracle
[1:05:28] now you think about it
[1:05:30] i've been in i've been in churches
[1:05:33] i've been in places here in other places
[1:05:35] where you preach your heart out and
[1:05:37] there's people there you know need to
[1:05:38] receive it and they don't get it
[1:05:41] and then there's other times you'll
[1:05:43] preach
[1:05:44] and it seems like it's just not much
[1:05:46] there
[1:05:47] but someone will come and give their
[1:05:49] heart to the lord
[1:05:51] and maybe many will come and several
[1:05:53] come and one
[1:05:54] will be give their hearts to the lord
[1:05:56] and and you look at it you realize
[1:05:57] something really happened
[1:05:59] in that person's heart and life and what
[1:06:01] what is it what is that it's god changed
[1:06:05] their life god brought them to an altar
[1:06:08] only god can give them new life we can
[1:06:10] preach it but only god can give them new
[1:06:12] life
[1:06:13] but it's god's method to preach the
[1:06:16] gospel that's the only way we can spread
[1:06:18] it is by preaching the gospel that's
[1:06:20] god's method is to preach the gospel
[1:06:22] maybe we'll deal with that on sunday
[1:06:23] night that's god's method of working
[1:06:25] that's what he does
[1:06:27] he didn't say that he would save the
[1:06:29] world by the internet
[1:06:32] do you know that
[1:06:33] he never said he would save the world by
[1:06:35] he never said he would go and go into
[1:06:36] all the world and and and type out
[1:06:38] sermons even give out books or tracks he
[1:06:40] said preach the word
[1:06:42] preach the gospel to every creature
[1:06:45] in power and demonstration so now
[1:06:47] but now it's some things you just can't
[1:06:50] change on your own but if the power of
[1:06:52] god could ever come down
[1:06:54] when the time is right it'll change
[1:06:58] and so you always so some people would
[1:07:00] react to that in a way because i know
[1:07:02] how some people think you know and and
[1:07:04] sometimes i'd like to think this way too
[1:07:06] but you can't afford to
[1:07:07] and that's kind of like well if i can't
[1:07:09] if i can't affect what time people
[1:07:11] change
[1:07:12] then i'll just wait and i won't really
[1:07:14] do anything i'll just keep
[1:07:16] keep doing this and just treading water
[1:07:18] until the time comes but that's not what
[1:07:20] we do
[1:07:22] we don't just tread water
[1:07:24] but we give every effort every time
[1:07:26] because we don't know
[1:07:30] right that's much effort on a wednesday
[1:07:32] night it's on a sunday morning as much
[1:07:33] effort as when there's 20 people when
[1:07:35] there's 100 people as much effort as
[1:07:37] when they're whatever it is whatever
[1:07:39] whether we're preaching here overseas or
[1:07:40] somewhere else i don't put any less into
[1:07:42] a sermon any less steady time to preach
[1:07:45] to you on a wednesday night than i would
[1:07:46] to go preach about the tim's or preach
[1:07:48] some other church that has a larger
[1:07:50] congregation i don't put any more effort
[1:07:52] into that in fact i put less in
[1:07:55] because you've heard it before
[1:07:58] but it's just the truth
[1:08:00] wherever i want that opportunity see we
[1:08:02] can be birthed by the word and those of
[1:08:05] you who have a new birth you can be
[1:08:06] refilled with the holy ghost you can be
[1:08:08] helped by the spirit of god you can be
[1:08:09] helped by the preaching of the word but
[1:08:11] we've got to keep our our shoulders to
[1:08:13] the wheel
[1:08:15] right
[1:08:16] so no man can no one can change the
[1:08:18] spirit of man give him a new birth
[1:08:19] outside of god god alone is the only one
[1:08:21] can do it it's a miracle how that god
[1:08:23] can take a man's faking and his ways and
[1:08:25] his life and everything aren't you glad
[1:08:28] god changed everything
[1:08:29] and change it from what it was to what
[1:08:32] it can be
[1:08:33] what he can make it
[1:08:35] he said for instance a few days ago and
[1:08:37] i've used this illustration of this
[1:08:38] story before but i just wanted to read
[1:08:40] it the way that he said it here he said
[1:08:42] a few days ago i was called in on a
[1:08:44] scene and now this is the same quote
[1:08:45] we're just continuing on he said on a
[1:08:48] scene or on a little something going on
[1:08:50] there was a fine young man very fine boy
[1:08:52] he was going with a little girl a very
[1:08:54] fine little girl out of a fine family it
[1:08:56] was actually brother branham's family
[1:08:59] the boy was his nephew i believe he said
[1:09:01] this boy all of a sudden came up with
[1:09:03] some kind of an idea and he just walked
[1:09:05] away
[1:09:06] he actually stood the girl up on a date
[1:09:08] he was i believe he was going to take
[1:09:09] her to church and he didn't take her he
[1:09:10] took someone else
[1:09:11] he said he did something wrong to the
[1:09:13] little girl and much has promised her to
[1:09:15] do a certain thing and then didn't do it
[1:09:17] instead of coming to the girl and
[1:09:19] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[1:09:20] it just wasn't in him to do it
[1:09:23] watch that
[1:09:26] amen if a person can be confronted by
[1:09:29] the word and not apologize
[1:09:32] that's a problem
[1:09:36] and i don't care if it's your kids that
[1:09:38] confront you
[1:09:41] because sometimes they do
[1:09:44] dad you know better than act like that
[1:09:49] it don't matter if it's the church
[1:09:50] confronting the pastor
[1:09:52] or the kids confronting or the pastor
[1:09:55] preaching the word
[1:09:56] and you hearing it if you're confronted
[1:09:58] with the word you realize lord help me i
[1:10:00] know i don't do that but i know it's
[1:10:02] true or i know i do that but i know i
[1:10:04] shouldn't do that and
[1:10:06] and then you you apologize you repent of
[1:10:08] that but it's a sign there's something
[1:10:10] wrong when we're confronted with it we
[1:10:11] know it's right
[1:10:13] but we won't do it
[1:10:15] he said now it's he said it's not easy
[1:10:17] to do sometimes and now he said it
[1:10:20] wasn't in him to do it the father mother
[1:10:22] called me to the scene said we would
[1:10:23] desire to know what is wrong with our
[1:10:24] boy he said no it's not easy to do
[1:10:26] sometimes but you must be truthful and
[1:10:28] honest he said therefore the boy was a
[1:10:30] christian as far as a believer he had
[1:10:31] repented and had been baptized at his
[1:10:34] position among the believers but yet had
[1:10:36] not received the baptism of the holy
[1:10:38] spirit no matter how much he thought he
[1:10:40] had he said you thinking you have and
[1:10:42] having it is two different things you
[1:10:44] might be able to try to say you have you
[1:10:46] might be able to show some evidence of
[1:10:47] some emotion but unless your life is
[1:10:50] vindicating what you're professing to
[1:10:51] have you still haven't got it
[1:10:54] listen
[1:10:56] yeah
[1:10:58] i i try to avoid hard subjects on
[1:11:00] wednesday nights on purpose
[1:11:02] listen if our lives don't cope with the
[1:11:04] word that's the evidence of the holy
[1:11:06] ghost
[1:11:08] that we can say amen to every word
[1:11:10] and if we're if we're confronted with it
[1:11:13] and we evade it or we we walk away and
[1:11:16] just shake our head and say well i'm not
[1:11:18] going to do that because i don't feel
[1:11:20] good doing that and it's not me
[1:11:24] there's something wrong
[1:11:25] either we never had the holy ghost
[1:11:28] or the holy ghost has lost its influence
[1:11:30] in our life because of backsiding
[1:11:35] either one of those circumstances are
[1:11:36] dangerous
[1:11:38] we need to come back to the fountain
[1:11:39] church i do
[1:11:40] many times i do
[1:11:42] now look he said i believe and he said
[1:11:46] uh no matter how many emotions how much
[1:11:47] you jump run sensations speaking in
[1:11:49] tongues or shouting whatever you might
[1:11:51] lay it upon which is all right i believe
[1:11:53] in all that too
[1:11:54] brother branham did
[1:11:56] he said but unless your life copes with
[1:11:58] your testimony you haven't got it he
[1:12:00] said because the fruit of the spirit
[1:12:01] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:12:03] fruit of any tree tells what it is jesus
[1:12:05] said by their fruit you shall know them
[1:12:08] he said now this young fellow's parents
[1:12:09] his mother is german
[1:12:12] we probably have germans in here i know
[1:12:13] we have germans in here tonight people
[1:12:15] of german heritage he said his mother is
[1:12:17] german he said no reflection on the
[1:12:19] german but there is a strain in that
[1:12:21] family he said and that is they'll just
[1:12:23] sit and you can talk to them and they'll
[1:12:25] just stare you right in the face
[1:12:28] he said this girl's sister the mother
[1:12:29] this boy her sister
[1:12:31] so this boy's mother's sister his aunt
[1:12:35] he's talking about her now he said i've
[1:12:36] come down the street many mornings
[1:12:39] this young lady be setting out in the
[1:12:40] yard and i'd say good morning to you and
[1:12:43] she'd just look at me
[1:12:45] and i'd stop and i'd say sure a fine
[1:12:47] morning he said she would just stand
[1:12:49] look right at you an intelligent woman
[1:12:51] and i'd say come up to see us sometime
[1:12:53] she'd just stand and look he said well
[1:12:55] her brothers are that way father and
[1:12:57] mother is that way
[1:12:58] he said now the father of the boy is
[1:13:00] strictly an irishman
[1:13:02] that was brother branham's side of the
[1:13:03] family
[1:13:04] he said moody and high tempered high
[1:13:06] strung he said his whole family like
[1:13:08] that except one other out of the family
[1:13:10] converted
[1:13:11] i like the way he put that
[1:13:13] one other out of the family converted he
[1:13:15] said this father and mother both are
[1:13:17] christians filled with the holy ghost
[1:13:19] and they now now remember this is
[1:13:21] important he said they were both
[1:13:23] christians and they brought this young
[1:13:25] men up in the way of the lord so they
[1:13:27] didn't do wrong
[1:13:29] sometimes we over blame ourselves is
[1:13:31] that a word overblaming
[1:13:33] we give ourselves excess blame
[1:13:37] right the child has to receive the holy
[1:13:39] ghost for themselves you got to promise
[1:13:41] that they would be there
[1:13:44] right
[1:13:44] what happens in between you don't know
[1:13:48] all right there's no promise of that but
[1:13:49] you have a promise they would be there
[1:13:51] because you and your house will be saved
[1:13:53] i'm holding to that promise aren't you
[1:13:56] amen but now
[1:13:57] here this boy he said this young man his
[1:13:59] father mother both christians they
[1:14:01] brought the young man upright now the
[1:14:02] young man is about 17 or 18 years old
[1:14:04] something along their very fine kid he's
[1:14:06] been a real model boy at home nice kid
[1:14:08] he's got a brother that's just vice
[1:14:10] versa
[1:14:11] must have not been a nice kid he said
[1:14:14] but the girls the mother's family lives
[1:14:16] close to he started to say i think the
[1:14:18] tabernacle he says a fine church
[1:14:21] he said but do you think they'd ever
[1:14:23] come over there no
[1:14:24] he said they know it's right but it's
[1:14:26] just not in them to ask forgiveness
[1:14:29] or ask pardoning
[1:14:31] he said they just won't do it it's just
[1:14:33] not in them
[1:14:35] oh my
[1:14:36] you realize what a serious thing that is
[1:14:39] church that's not what i'm preaching on
[1:14:40] tonight but you realize if that if
[1:14:42] that's something that you deal with you
[1:14:43] have a hard time doing that you need to
[1:14:45] overcome that
[1:14:47] because it'll keep you from the holy
[1:14:48] ghost it'll keep you from church
[1:14:50] it'll keep you from loving the people of
[1:14:52] god
[1:14:54] he said now the genes and the father and
[1:14:56] the mother of this boy said no matter
[1:14:57] how much they are converted
[1:14:59] still remains the flesh someone say the
[1:15:01] flesh
[1:15:03] okay pop quiz what what good is there in
[1:15:07] the flesh
[1:15:09] what did paul say nothing
[1:15:12] there is nothing good about the flesh
[1:15:15] well i'm predestinated not the flesh
[1:15:19] we go back and talk about that if you
[1:15:21] want to we can we can preach about it or
[1:15:23] we can study it and study it out but
[1:15:24] it's not the flesh it's inner man
[1:15:28] huh it's the inner man there's a that's
[1:15:29] a new creation
[1:15:31] that's born again that can't fall
[1:15:34] right but the flesh there's nothing good
[1:15:36] in the flesh and so nothing good
[1:15:38] and nothing good come together
[1:15:41] and have a child
[1:15:44] right
[1:15:44] because you don't have them in the
[1:15:46] spirit
[1:15:48] all right they're born after the flesh
[1:15:51] we don't have spoken word children so
[1:15:52] the children are born what are they
[1:15:53] nothing good
[1:15:56] oh my that's just hurting you with them
[1:15:57] little babies
[1:15:59] when they're so sweet but they'd go to
[1:16:01] heaven like that it's when they get
[1:16:02] older you know
[1:16:04] but when them genes start to manifest
[1:16:06] themselves
[1:16:08] now look
[1:16:09] now he said
[1:16:11] he said therefore he said the boy
[1:16:13] has got a complex in him just like from
[1:16:16] his mother's family
[1:16:17] they are not forgiving they will not
[1:16:19] apologize and that's where the boy
[1:16:20] stands
[1:16:22] and i said to the father no matter how
[1:16:23] much you've raised him up
[1:16:25] now look this was this was a boy was
[1:16:27] raised right
[1:16:28] went to a prophet's church
[1:16:30] part of a prophet's family
[1:16:33] did not have the holy ghost
[1:16:35] yeah right and so
[1:16:37] it looks like a minor thing that's a
[1:16:38] minor thing
[1:16:40] and maybe if it was our kid we'd defend
[1:16:42] him and that's what the parents did by
[1:16:44] the way
[1:16:45] defended their son
[1:16:47] but we defend him but yet
[1:16:49] a prophet of god could look at that and
[1:16:51] i won't be looking at you and telling
[1:16:52] you oh you don't have the holy ghost
[1:16:53] because it's more difficult for me i can
[1:16:55] only look at the outside fruits brother
[1:16:57] branham could actually look
[1:16:59] at the motives or the the thoughts he
[1:17:01] could he could perceive the thoughts of
[1:17:03] the boy's heart and he could see why he
[1:17:05] did what he did more so than what i
[1:17:07] could see
[1:17:08] right but only god knows the heart
[1:17:11] but brother brown could see being a
[1:17:12] prophet more than what i could see and
[1:17:14] yet if you have those fruits in your
[1:17:16] life there's something wrong
[1:17:19] right that would make you stubborn and
[1:17:20] not not apologize and do things like
[1:17:22] that that are harsh to people and not
[1:17:25] not make it right and so he said i said
[1:17:28] to the father no matter how much you've
[1:17:29] raised him up i said now look at you out
[1:17:31] of your family all of them drunks and
[1:17:32] fighting and shooting and cutting
[1:17:35] brother branham's family
[1:17:36] he said now look at your family to the
[1:17:38] mother he said there are a bunch of
[1:17:40] people just sit there won't speak very
[1:17:41] independent so forth irreverent to
[1:17:43] religion but i said it's not you
[1:17:47] aren't you glad for the blood of jesus
[1:17:48] christ
[1:17:49] it's not you you're the only one of all
[1:17:51] your sisters and brothers you're sweet
[1:17:53] kind and forgiving what does that and
[1:17:56] your tree he said part of that family
[1:17:57] tree yet you have received the holy
[1:17:59] ghost he said that's the thing that made
[1:18:00] you tender and sweet it's not your
[1:18:02] people anymore it's your christ that
[1:18:04] lives in you
[1:18:06] hey man i said to the boy look at your
[1:18:08] family practically all of them are
[1:18:09] drunks and so forth i said how moody and
[1:18:11] high tempered and high strung but you're
[1:18:13] not
[1:18:14] you're kind forgiving what is it the
[1:18:16] holy spirit you're no more what you are
[1:18:18] it's christ in you i said now that same
[1:18:20] thing has to happen to your son
[1:18:23] and the father raised up and said my son
[1:18:25] went to the altar he was baptized
[1:18:26] correctly in the name of jesus christ
[1:18:28] water baptism in the pool said i know my
[1:18:30] son has come to christ i said that may
[1:18:32] be all right all the outward motions he
[1:18:34] might be identified as a believer with
[1:18:36] the believers but until he has
[1:18:37] regenerated born again i've advised
[1:18:39] listen where he takes this i'd advise
[1:18:41] that young man to never marry a woman
[1:18:43] he'll make hell on earth for her
[1:18:46] until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit
[1:18:48] of christ comes in
[1:18:51] he said then that will be a paradox in
[1:18:53] itself
[1:18:54] to take the very nature of a boy that's
[1:18:56] bred between father and mother yet in
[1:18:58] his intellectuals he is trying his best
[1:19:01] to overcome it he can't do it
[1:19:04] you realize with our family tree joel if
[1:19:06] we could just look back at ours us being
[1:19:08] married to our wives as long as we've
[1:19:10] been proves that something's taken place
[1:19:15] proves to us anyway you don't know all
[1:19:17] my family
[1:19:20] but just being able to get along with
[1:19:21] your wife is not something that comes
[1:19:23] automatically
[1:19:25] in the pruitt family tree
[1:19:28] but why are we so different
[1:19:31] they say well do you have problems
[1:19:32] absolutely
[1:19:34] i used to say because we fight very
[1:19:37] little my wife and i we fussed very
[1:19:38] little but i used to be able to say i'd
[1:19:40] never had a a fight with my wife never
[1:19:42] never had a fuss with my wife and i've
[1:19:44] i've never never hit my wife i don't
[1:19:46] mean that kind of fight you got to watch
[1:19:47] what you say from the pulpit but i mean
[1:19:50] just verbally just just getting angry
[1:19:53] i could there was one time i could say
[1:19:54] i'd never been angry with my wife and
[1:19:56] that's not true anymore
[1:19:57] but it was probably months after we got
[1:20:00] married and well no i did get angry on
[1:20:02] our honeymoon i forgot about that
[1:20:07] sorry about that hun
[1:20:11] it was months later before i got angry
[1:20:13] again i used to say we never fight and
[1:20:15] that's
[1:20:16] i realize that's kind of portraying an
[1:20:18] image that's not exactly true
[1:20:20] because we'd still do that but there's a
[1:20:22] dominating force
[1:20:26] you know how hard it is for me to say
[1:20:28] i'm sorry
[1:20:30] it's hard it's difficult to tell people
[1:20:33] i need help
[1:20:36] very difficult
[1:20:38] but jt told me years ago he said ben
[1:20:39] you're more personal in the pulpit than
[1:20:41] you are out of it i said that's
[1:20:42] generally true
[1:20:44] because under the anointing sometimes
[1:20:45] you you expose yourself a little bit
[1:20:47] more than what what you would and to the
[1:20:49] people but i'll tell you this it's
[1:20:50] difficult for me naturally to do that
[1:20:53] but it's the power of god
[1:20:55] that grabs a hold of my human nature
[1:20:59] and bridles my tongue
[1:21:01] and bridles my temper
[1:21:03] are you hearing me bridle you you
[1:21:05] experience that you know what that's
[1:21:07] like you're about to say it by the joe
[1:21:09] and you're about to do something you're
[1:21:10] about to say something and the holy
[1:21:12] spirit comes in or maybe you do say it
[1:21:14] but you're angry and you don't sin
[1:21:16] because you repent
[1:21:18] amen
[1:21:20] aren't you glad for a god like that
[1:21:22] but i would say this if you're a young
[1:21:25] person especially if things run in your
[1:21:26] family you're gonna have to fight that
[1:21:29] don't just assume that it's right
[1:21:32] this is the way things are done fight
[1:21:34] that be different
[1:21:37] now brother brown said he'll never
[1:21:39] overcome it christ will have to overcome
[1:21:41] it when he lets christ in then he's
[1:21:43] already overcome then
[1:21:45] it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is
[1:21:47] born
[1:21:48] of the spirit of god he said i've seen
[1:21:50] critics stand off and make fun and carry
[1:21:52] on of a holy ghost revival after a while
[1:21:54] god get a hold of that same man and
[1:21:56] change him and here he stands right in
[1:21:58] the pulpit preaching the same thing he
[1:22:00] once hated it's a paradox how that god
[1:22:02] can take the unbeliever and make a
[1:22:04] believer out of him now we're getting to
[1:22:05] saul tonight he said i wonder if a man
[1:22:08] thinks that miracles has passed i wonder
[1:22:10] what kind of a scientific medicine you
[1:22:11] could give such a person to change that
[1:22:14] disposition in them to take that hatred
[1:22:16] and malice and strife out there is no
[1:22:18] one can explain it he said but it's a
[1:22:20] paradox because it's a miracle of god
[1:22:23] when a man has changed from the person
[1:22:25] that he is to a new creature in christ
[1:22:27] jesus he becomes a new creation he is no
[1:22:30] more what he used to be he is absolutely
[1:22:33] a new creation
[1:22:34] can you say amen to me tonight
[1:22:37] amen to the word
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:43] saul of tarsus
[1:22:46] was born around 10 a.d
[1:22:49] and lived around 57 years
[1:22:53] he was born in tarsus 961 miles from
[1:22:56] jerusalem
[1:22:58] born a roman citizen he had social
[1:23:00] status and wealth
[1:23:01] he was in the upper echelon of what we
[1:23:04] would call the society of that day at
[1:23:06] least in the upper middle class
[1:23:08] he gives us a glimpse of his life in
[1:23:10] philippians chapter three and verse five
[1:23:12] circumcised the eighth day of the stock
[1:23:14] of israel of the tribe of benjamin
[1:23:16] hebrew of the hebrews
[1:23:18] it's touching the law of pharisee
[1:23:21] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:23:24] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:23:26] the law
[1:23:27] blameless
[1:23:29] how many men of that day could even say
[1:23:31] that
[1:23:35] history tells us that he was under
[1:23:36] gamaliel for eight years and
[1:23:39] in jerusalem and then he returned to
[1:23:41] tarsus for a while which is why he
[1:23:42] missed the ministry
[1:23:43] of jesus he was
[1:23:45] then either elected to the sanhedrin
[1:23:47] council or was being groomed for that
[1:23:49] position as one of the brilliant young
[1:23:51] men that was coming in in the upper
[1:23:54] echelon of jewish society
[1:23:57] and in acts 22 and 3 he said i am verily
[1:24:00] a man which i'm a jew born in tarsus a
[1:24:03] city in cilicia
[1:24:05] brought up in this city at the feet of
[1:24:07] gamaliel
[1:24:08] and you know his parents had wealth and
[1:24:10] money because they transported him all
[1:24:12] the way
[1:24:12] paid for him to go to school all the way
[1:24:14] in jerusalem which was in that time a
[1:24:16] very very long journey
[1:24:19] and he was taught according to the
[1:24:20] perfect manner of the law of the fathers
[1:24:22] was zealous toward god as ye all are
[1:24:25] this day speaking to those jewish people
[1:24:28] he said i persecuted this way into the
[1:24:30] death
[1:24:31] binding and delivering into prisons both
[1:24:33] men and women
[1:24:35] it's also the high priest to bear me
[1:24:37] witness
[1:24:38] what a testimony paul was yes
[1:24:41] he's standing there as paul who was saul
[1:24:42] the persecutor
[1:24:44] he's standing there and say the high
[1:24:45] priest knows
[1:24:47] that he gave me letters
[1:24:51] he said in all the estate of the elders
[1:24:53] that would be the sanhedrin council from
[1:24:55] whom also i received letters unto the
[1:24:57] brethren and went to damascus to bring
[1:24:59] them which were there bound unto unto
[1:25:01] jerusalem to be punished
[1:25:04] listen to me that this man could be
[1:25:06] converted
[1:25:08] is truly a paradox
[1:25:11] see the but what's the difference now
[1:25:13] think about it we've went all through
[1:25:15] the life of saul and we've looked at him
[1:25:16] and how that family strain come out and
[1:25:18] it comes out a thousand years later in
[1:25:21] in saul of tarsus
[1:25:23] same family strain how is he ever going
[1:25:25] to end up any differently
[1:25:28] how is he going to avoid that
[1:25:30] oh my let me bring it down how are you
[1:25:32] ever going to avoid that
[1:25:34] how are you ever going to end up any
[1:25:36] differently how am i ever going to end
[1:25:37] up any differently listen the difference
[1:25:39] was the cross
[1:25:42] on this side of the cross saul
[1:25:44] of king saul could not overcome
[1:25:48] his benjamin heritage
[1:25:50] could not the difference was not the
[1:25:52] time only in that the time
[1:25:55] in that time
[1:25:57] christ was crucified on the cross
[1:26:00] rose again on the third day
[1:26:02] amen and the fact
[1:26:05] i hope you hear me tonight church
[1:26:07] the fact of a risen jesus christ
[1:26:11] made the difference
[1:26:14] between saul king saul
[1:26:16] and saul of tarsus
[1:26:18] one came
[1:26:20] bc
[1:26:21] in 1000 bc
[1:26:24] one came in a.d
[1:26:27] that made all the difference
[1:26:30] think about it they were both men of god
[1:26:36] they both went to heaven
[1:26:38] but our goal here as the bride of jesus
[1:26:40] christ is not just to make it by the
[1:26:42] skin of our teeth to heaven
[1:26:45] right our goal is to be good stewards of
[1:26:48] the mysteries of god
[1:26:50] we're not put here on the earth just to
[1:26:52] make it by the skin of our teeth we're
[1:26:54] put here to be good stewards of the
[1:26:55] mysteries of god to be a church that is
[1:26:58] just like that first church to be the
[1:27:00] representation of god on the earth today
[1:27:03] to be what god called us to be to be the
[1:27:05] overcomer of the lay of the sea and age
[1:27:08] that's what you and i were called to do
[1:27:10] and if there's going to be something
[1:27:11] that overcomes that makes us overcome
[1:27:13] our past that causes us to overcome our
[1:27:16] family history if there's going to be
[1:27:17] something to do that it's going to take
[1:27:19] the cross
[1:27:21] no matter how educated in the message
[1:27:23] you might become no matter how how good
[1:27:25] you are no matter how well you were
[1:27:27] raised no matter what family you were
[1:27:28] born to no matter who your pastor is
[1:27:30] what your last name is the difference is
[1:27:32] the cross
[1:27:34] the difference today is the same as it
[1:27:36] was then you've got to meet christ
[1:27:38] yourself
[1:27:40] and that will make all the difference
[1:27:44] saul of tarsus is just as stubborn as
[1:27:46] king saul
[1:27:48] just as bloodthirsty
[1:27:50] just as violent
[1:27:54] so how do you say that he said it
[1:27:56] in first timothy 1 15 he said this is a
[1:27:58] faithful saying and worthy of all
[1:28:01] exception
[1:28:02] that christ jesus came into the world to
[1:28:04] save sinners
[1:28:07] of whom i am chief
[1:28:10] he wasn't being humble look what he says
[1:28:12] next
[1:28:13] how be it for this cause i obtained
[1:28:15] mercy
[1:28:17] that in me first
[1:28:19] jesus christ might show forth all
[1:28:21] longsuffering
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:25] once paul was converted he realized the
[1:28:28] very first time that he ever was
[1:28:30] stubborn against god the very first time
[1:28:32] that he ever threw one of them people in
[1:28:34] prison the very first time he ever run
[1:28:36] down the people of god the very first
[1:28:38] time he ever condemned christ and
[1:28:39] condemned the way of the people of god
[1:28:42] and condemn christianity he realized he
[1:28:44] should have been struck down then but
[1:28:46] something grabbed a hold of him
[1:28:48] something waited on him amen
[1:28:50] something kept him through that time
[1:28:52] what was it the long-suffering of god
[1:28:56] amen he said for a pattern he said he
[1:28:59] might show forth all long-suffering for
[1:29:00] a pattern amen paul was the pattern for
[1:29:03] who to them which should hereafter
[1:29:05] believe on him to life everlasting paul
[1:29:08] is the pattern not only for the
[1:29:10] messengers of the age but also to every
[1:29:12] believer today
[1:29:15] amen do you believe that today he's a
[1:29:17] pattern of grace we don't have to be
[1:29:19] bound by our family history we don't
[1:29:21] have to be bound by the curse that the
[1:29:23] devil laid on us we don't have to be
[1:29:24] bound to what our genes say we should be
[1:29:27] yes sir
[1:29:29] we don't have to be that we're something
[1:29:31] more brother steward we're the bride of
[1:29:32] jesus christ
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:36] we've come to a different place
[1:29:39] hallelujah
[1:29:40] we've come to a a grace and not a law
[1:29:45] a place where we can find
[1:29:47] help in time of need
[1:29:49] a place where there's a mediator a place
[1:29:52] where we have an attorney
[1:29:54] who was also the judge
[1:29:57] a rigged court
[1:29:59] and saw
[1:30:01] amen
[1:30:02] could stand before god and god said you
[1:30:04] never did it in the first place
[1:30:09] oh my
[1:30:11] we find saul as a young man standing and
[1:30:13] watching the stoning of stephen
[1:30:16] we won't go through all through this
[1:30:17] tonight we'll just kind of touch the
[1:30:18] high points and
[1:30:20] and finish on this and then we'll maybe
[1:30:22] get back into it
[1:30:25] in acts 6 and 9 he said then there arose
[1:30:26] certain of the synagogue which is called
[1:30:28] the synagogue of the libertines
[1:30:31] and the cyrenians and the alexandrians
[1:30:34] and them of cilicia and of asia
[1:30:37] disputing with stephen you bible
[1:30:38] students you mark that cilicia celestia
[1:30:41] that is the place where tarsus is
[1:30:45] that's what saul's country and so they
[1:30:48] had their own church their own synagogue
[1:30:51] of like-minded well-educated
[1:30:54] if we could say hellenistic jews is what
[1:30:56] they were called they were
[1:30:58] jews who were educated as greeks and yet
[1:31:00] followed the law to the letter
[1:31:03] they were well educated and so they
[1:31:04] became the ones
[1:31:06] who disputed with stephen
[1:31:08] it was paul's church
[1:31:11] where he went to church those would have
[1:31:12] been his closest friends
[1:31:16] stephen
[1:31:17] at that point begins to preach
[1:31:19] he was a deacon
[1:31:21] he began to preach one of the greatest
[1:31:22] sermons ever ever recorded
[1:31:26] he starts out and he goes all through
[1:31:27] the history
[1:31:28] ends up calling them wided walls and
[1:31:31] a few other things and
[1:31:33] he gets down to the end of that sermon
[1:31:36] and the bible says when they heard these
[1:31:37] things in acts 7 54 they were cut to the
[1:31:40] heart
[1:31:42] and they gnashed on him with their teeth
[1:31:45] i've never preached a sermon that hard
[1:31:47] yet
[1:31:48] i've had people gnash their teeth but
[1:31:50] not on me thank goodness
[1:31:54] verse 55 but he being full of the holy
[1:31:56] ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven
[1:31:59] he didn't respond back in kind
[1:32:02] but he saw the glory of god
[1:32:04] and jesus standing on the right hand of
[1:32:06] god
[1:32:07] and said behold i see the heavens open
[1:32:10] and the son of man standing on the right
[1:32:12] hand of god
[1:32:13] then they cried out with a loud voice
[1:32:15] and stopped their ears
[1:32:17] and ran upon him with one accord
[1:32:20] and cast him out of the city
[1:32:23] and stoned him
[1:32:25] and the witnesses laid down their
[1:32:27] clothes at a young man's feet
[1:32:30] whose name
[1:32:31] was saul
[1:32:33] saul never tried to hide that by the way
[1:32:37] he never tried to hide what he did
[1:32:40] they stoned stephen
[1:32:42] calling upon god
[1:32:44] and saying lord jesus
[1:32:46] receive
[1:32:47] my spirit
[1:32:49] and he kneeled down and cried with the
[1:32:50] loud voice of the lord lay not this sin
[1:32:52] to their charge when he had said this he
[1:32:54] fell asleep
[1:32:55] i love the beauty of that
[1:32:57] he's being stoned but he fell asleep
[1:33:01] and saul was consenting
[1:33:03] to his death
[1:33:05] what that word means is that he was in
[1:33:07] favor of it
[1:33:09] he wanted it to happen
[1:33:11] he didn't pick up the stone but he was
[1:33:14] that was his church that did it
[1:33:16] and he put his stamp of approval on it
[1:33:18] and even went as far as to say i'll hold
[1:33:20] your coat well you stone him
[1:33:23] saul being destined perhaps to be the
[1:33:25] high priest or or be a great man like
[1:33:27] gamaliel in the in the sanhedrin of that
[1:33:30] day he couldn't do it himself
[1:33:32] but he put stephen to capital punishment
[1:33:35] by consenting to his death maybe if he'd
[1:33:37] spoke up
[1:33:38] maybe if he'd have stood in his defense
[1:33:40] like gamaliel did later
[1:33:42] for peter and john
[1:33:44] maybe if paul had done that
[1:33:47] there wouldn't have been a first
[1:33:48] christian martyr
[1:33:49] named stephen
[1:33:51] but he stood there
[1:33:53] as saul of tarsus
[1:33:55] consenting to the death
[1:33:57] of stephen it says and
[1:34:00] at that time there was a great
[1:34:01] persecution against the church which was
[1:34:03] at jerusalem this pack of wolves
[1:34:07] began to go after the weak
[1:34:09] they were all scattered except except
[1:34:11] the apostles
[1:34:12] and devout men carried stephen to his
[1:34:14] burial made great lamentation over him
[1:34:17] as for saul he made havoc
[1:34:19] of the church
[1:34:23] if you go and you can look up on the
[1:34:24] internet and you can see how wolf will
[1:34:26] go down that line of elk and you can see
[1:34:28] the dead elk just laying there not
[1:34:30] eating
[1:34:30] just killed
[1:34:33] wreaked havoc
[1:34:35] entering into every house
[1:34:37] hailing men and women committed them to
[1:34:39] prison
[1:34:41] the word havoc means he injured the
[1:34:42] church he arrived like a wolf he slashed
[1:34:45] and he cut
[1:34:47] he did everything he could
[1:34:48] to defeat the gospel
[1:34:51] aren't you glad the gospel cannot be
[1:34:53] defeated
[1:34:55] how did this man become the apostle to
[1:34:58] the gentiles a messenger of grace
[1:35:00] remember
[1:35:02] go back if you were listening if you
[1:35:04] were here
[1:35:06] or if you watched
[1:35:08] some time ago we read where king saul
[1:35:10] said he was the least of the tribe of
[1:35:11] benjamin you remember that when they
[1:35:14] come to him they ask him to be king he
[1:35:15] said he said i'm the least of the tribe
[1:35:17] of benjamin my family is is the smallest
[1:35:20] it's the least
[1:35:22] of the whole tribe
[1:35:23] i'm the least
[1:35:25] the benjamites are the least of the
[1:35:27] tribes and i'm the least of the least
[1:35:30] and remember how he said that that
[1:35:31] become a
[1:35:32] something in his mind that he felt that
[1:35:34] way
[1:35:35] and was good as long as god could use it
[1:35:38] but then he become arrogant in it
[1:35:40] because he felt like he pulled himself
[1:35:42] up by his bootstraps and and yet he had
[1:35:44] this insecurity which become an
[1:35:47] arrogance because it was overcompensated
[1:35:49] for
[1:35:50] because he could never overcome that
[1:35:52] well
[1:35:53] saul of tarsus had that same insecurity
[1:35:58] but now watch
[1:35:59] something
[1:36:01] got a hold of him
[1:36:03] because he comes back in first
[1:36:04] corinthians 15 9 says i am the least of
[1:36:07] the apostles
[1:36:10] watch
[1:36:11] i'm not me to be called an apostle
[1:36:14] because i persecuted the church of god
[1:36:17] people would just like to take one quote
[1:36:19] or one scripture could shut the door so
[1:36:20] we don't have to listen to paul
[1:36:25] but look at the next verse
[1:36:27] but by the grace of god
[1:36:31] you know there's some scriptures that
[1:36:32] fit certain people malachi 4
[1:36:34] and revelation 10 7 fit certain people
[1:36:36] we can find ourselves in there and and
[1:36:38] yet they've mostly fit one person this
[1:36:41] fits all of us
[1:36:45] this fits all of us
[1:36:47] because paul was the pattern of grace
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:51] he said i was i'm not mean to be called
[1:36:54] an apostle remember that was where that
[1:36:56] was where saul was and god used him for
[1:36:58] a while like that and then he got
[1:36:59] arrogant
[1:37:01] he said but by the grace of god i am
[1:37:03] what i am
[1:37:05] how do you overcome insecurity how do
[1:37:06] you overcome arrogancy this is the right
[1:37:09] balance
[1:37:10] no false humility no insecurity no
[1:37:12] arrogance or pride disgrace
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:18] by the grace of god i am what i am how
[1:37:20] many can say amen to that tonight by the
[1:37:22] grace of god i am what i am and his
[1:37:24] grace which was bestowed upon me was not
[1:37:27] in vain he said i'm not going to deny
[1:37:29] what god's done in my life i don't care
[1:37:31] how bad you feel about yourself how much
[1:37:33] you feel like you're the least of the
[1:37:34] preachers or or the least of the deacons
[1:37:36] or the least of the churches you got to
[1:37:38] recognize the grace of god has done
[1:37:40] something in your life you may have the
[1:37:42] least family you may have the worst
[1:37:44] track record in the past but the grace
[1:37:46] of god has done something in your life
[1:37:49] and you should be able to raise up and
[1:37:50] say by the grace of god i am what i am
[1:37:54] and the late and the grace that he
[1:37:55] bestowed upon me was not in vain because
[1:37:58] i recognized myself to belittle i
[1:38:01] recognized myself to not be able to do
[1:38:03] it on my own and so i labored more
[1:38:05] abundantly than they all but even when i
[1:38:07] labored it was not me but the grace of
[1:38:09] god which was with me
[1:38:12] amen
[1:38:13] amen that's the gospel
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:17] there's the right balance
[1:38:20] no false humility
[1:38:22] no insecurity
[1:38:24] no arrogance musicians go ahead and come
[1:38:27] just grace
[1:38:33] we went through this and i don't know we
[1:38:35] we're nearly done we may be done
[1:38:38] but
[1:38:43] how does that strain ever get broken
[1:38:46] by the grace of god
[1:38:48] and that grace is expressed in your life
[1:38:50] as a new birth
[1:38:52] and that new birth makes you act like a
[1:38:55] christian
[1:38:56] makes you do things beyond your own
[1:38:57] abilities
[1:38:59] you say i
[1:39:01] somehow
[1:39:03] i've labored more abundantly than all of
[1:39:04] them but it wasn't me
[1:39:07] i won't deny what god's done in my life
[1:39:10] but it wasn't me
[1:39:12] brother branham said it that way he said
[1:39:14] i i won't deny what an angel said to me
[1:39:16] at the river
[1:39:17] i won't deny what he said he said i'm no
[1:39:19] prophet
[1:39:20] he said i won't deny what he said
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:24] i'm the least of all amen take it down
[1:39:26] now our prophet he said i'm the least of
[1:39:29] all the preachers not even a preacher
[1:39:32] he said but one day
[1:39:33] he said if you make it to heaven he said
[1:39:36] you'll find me there he said when you
[1:39:37] hear he said you see a little cabin down
[1:39:39] by the river
[1:39:40] he said and you see you hear amazing
[1:39:42] grace how sweet the sound
[1:39:44] he said i made it by grace
[1:39:47] hallelujah
[1:39:48] let's bow our heads together
[1:39:51] heavenly father was so grateful for the
[1:39:53] grace of the almighty god
[1:39:56] so grateful for the
[1:39:57] for the times when
[1:39:59] we were beyond hope
[1:40:02] oh god
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:05] yet even in that moment as we said
[1:40:07] sunday night
[1:40:09] there was a place for us at the table
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:13] saul didn't realize it's all of tarsus
[1:40:16] but there was a place for paul the
[1:40:18] apostle
[1:40:20] already at that great table
[1:40:24] but that meeting in the air
[1:40:26] it was already a place made
[1:40:29] he didn't know it
[1:40:30] but one day he began to realize
[1:40:33] what you'd done for him
[1:40:35] and when he realized that he
[1:40:37] he just couldn't hold back
[1:40:39] even though they stoned him and they
[1:40:41] persecuted him
[1:40:43] and he was shipwrecked and left for dead
[1:40:47] yet he found himself one time in the
[1:40:49] prison
[1:40:50] been beaten laying there in the muck in
[1:40:53] the darkness
[1:40:54] of the inner prison
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:56] sitting there with silas with stalks on
[1:40:58] his feet
[1:41:00] and he began to
[1:41:01] sing
[1:41:03] a song of rejoicing
[1:41:05] because no matter what happened to paul
[1:41:08] he was no longer solved
[1:41:11] no matter how many times he got sick and
[1:41:12] how many times he got weary and how many
[1:41:15] times he was troubled no matter what
[1:41:16] happened to him what he went through he
[1:41:19] was no longer saul
[1:41:21] it was paul the apostle
[1:41:23] he could stand there and say i am what i
[1:41:25] am
[1:41:26] by the grace of god
[1:41:28] help us to recognize that today lord
[1:41:31] help us to know that and though our feet
[1:41:33] may be in stalks of prison
[1:41:35] we begin to sing at midnight
[1:41:38] raise our voice lord to you raise our
[1:41:40] worship to you lord we may be the least
[1:41:43] of all the preachers the least of all
[1:41:45] the churches the least of all the people
[1:41:47] but we can't deny what you've done in
[1:41:49] our lives
[1:41:50] we can't deny that you are a great god
[1:41:53] you are not bound
[1:41:54] by our weaknesses but you lord make a
[1:41:57] way there's room there for you to begin
[1:42:00] to move

[1:42:03] i pray that you move in every heart lord
[1:42:05] if there's one that hasn't overcome
[1:42:07] hard help them to know that it's only
[1:42:08] the by the cross will they overcome
[1:42:11] only by your grace will they be able to
[1:42:13] do that and i pray lord that they would
[1:42:15] take advantage of that help us to be
[1:42:17] humble or
[1:42:19] to listen
[1:42:21] or not to be stubborn oh god
[1:42:23] help me lord i recognize lord even in my
[1:42:26] own family there's a trait of that
[1:42:28] we can be stubborn
[1:42:30] oh god help me not to be like that
[1:42:32] save me from myself lord
[1:42:35] i find when i when i'm fighting when i
[1:42:37] begin to rank my enemies in order i
[1:42:39] always put myself at the top
[1:42:41] lord because i'm my greatest enemy
[1:42:44] before anything else
[1:42:46] it's me lord standing in the need of
[1:42:48] prayer i pray lord that every one of us
[1:42:50] would recognize that today
[1:42:52] lord and that we would bow to your
[1:42:54] omniscience we can't overcome on our own
[1:42:57] but lord if we can recognize the devil
[1:42:59] by your word and speak the word back to
[1:43:01] him lord we can overcome in this evil
[1:43:04] hour that we live in
