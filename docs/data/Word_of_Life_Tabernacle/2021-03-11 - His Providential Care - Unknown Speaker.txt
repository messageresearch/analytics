again he's here listen closely hear him call out your name he's here you can touch him you will never be the same let's bow our heads together maybe you'd have a a need you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand tonight i i believe god sees those needs and he's able to meet them tonight heavenly father or jesus hands were up all over the building tonight and i'm sure those that are watching as well lord i know that you're the god who can meet every need we're not depending on my strength or the strength of the people gathered together here tonight but depending on your strength lord to be able to overcome every obstacle in our lives father i pray we've not found your mind lord and followed you completely i pray you forgive us lord jesus if there's anything lord between us god would you take it out today we want to worship you with all of our heart lord as brother stewart already pray lord that we get put all of our effort all of our heart into it lord you deserve so much more than what we could give or we couldn't repay you for what you've done for us but we could worship you with all our heart and all of our mind all of our strength and we thank you for that tonight lord i pray you to help us lord in each one of these situations lord these needs i i pray that you would just move in a supernatural way lord as only you can't and i believe that you will i pray you'd grant it now and that's the service tonight move me out of the way god speak to your people i i believe you still do that lord and so i pray you would do it tonight ask in jesus name amen amen and god bless you turn with me if you would to exodus chapter 3 verses 7 and 8. it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight but john it's good to see you tonight good to have every one of you for the sam's good to see you on a wednesday night and it's always good to be in the house of the lord and i want to break away from our marriage series tonight to speak on his providential care and this is something that so you'll know i'm not preaching at you it's something i've actually preached before but but we do know that god has a way of speaking directly to our hearts doesn't he and i believe that he meant and intended for you to be here tonight and he intended for me to be here tonight and if he wanted us to be here and then arranged all of history for us to be at this moment then there has to be a reason for that and maybe sometimes we don't want to hear something but we still need to hear it and and that would be the case for every one of us tonight and i trust it'll be a blessing to you exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 keep us in your prayers we'll be uh headed out of town for a few days i'm going to a camp we're going to take peter to a youth camp and and i'm going to take my family up there and and spend a few days with brother wendell martin and them and and you just be praying for us and believe that the lord will help the young people there and i believe the lord will help you here but the steward will be preaching sunday morning and uh so i'm sure you'll be looking forward to that in exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and i've heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows he says i know he didn't have to guess at it he knew he heard and then verse 8 and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians because he knew he cared and because he cared he came down amen to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land in a large into a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening his providential care webster in 1828 defined providence as the act of providing or preparing for future use or application he said foresight timely care particular particularly active foresight foresight accompanied with the procurement of what is necessary for future use or with suitable preparation he says in theology the care and superintendence which god exercises over his creatures he that acknowledges the creation and denies the providence involves himself in a palpable contradiction from the same power which caused a thing to exist is necessary to continue its existence and so the idea of a god who could be powerful enough to make you and not powerful enough to provide for you every day in your life doesn't the two things don't mesh it doesn't line up there has to be he has to be able to provide for you and just treat this like it's sunday morning for a minute if you will i think everybody ought to come to church like it's sunday morning all the time it's just me you know we didn't come here to play church we don't come here to uh to just hear something nice and go home we come here to worship god and we believe that the one we worship is a real god he's a real god he's not somebody who can't intervene on our behalf he's not somebody who just sits back there and doesn't care he cares and he wants us to care as much as he cares now psalms 24 and 1 tells us that the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof and that word fullness means the entire contents of the earth the earth if i would say this bottle of water is mine and the fullness thereof that means everything in it is mine the water is mine every molecule of it everything is mine the earth is the lord's and the entire contents thereof the world and they that dwell therein brother branham says this he said you were all pre-planned by god and that's hard for us to understand sometimes you go tell that to the to the israelites who had lived under 400 years however many of those years they were in bondage there in egypt after all those years of bondage try to tell them that god pre-planned it but he did the cup of iniquity of the amorites but sam had to fill up and i don't understand that why did he have to wait until hundreds had died thousands had been beaten and and cruelly with taskmasters and all that brother david how how why did he have to wait i don't i don't know i don't understand but god does god understands god knows exactly why we're in the situation that we are tonight whatever that situation is whatever condition you find yourself in in life god knows he knows if there's money in your bank account or lack thereof he knows and he cares if if you're having trouble in your relationship if you're having trouble with a church or whatever it is that you're having trouble with he knows god knows because if he didn't know he couldn't be god he just wouldn't exist as god he couldn't be all-knowing and not know and if he knows then he cares he says i know what you're going through he's and brother baby says you're all pre-planned by god nothing happens by chance with god he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight so we could say that god provided you with the things you would need and he provided the earth with you right because we are not just blessed by the providence of god we are the providence of god have you ever thought about that god meant for us to be in the earth where we are he meant for us to be and go to church where we go to church he meant for us to be in the family that we're in and we wonder about that don't we god why would you put me in my family god bless you all you that are watching tonight man why would you put me in my family huh why would you make me the way i am there's a reason for that god intended for you to be exactly who you are do we really believe that tonight he puts you in a particular place not just to receive providence but to be providence to actually he actually hardened pharaoh's heart for the israelites sake amen god allows you to be there and even david went here was a man who was david was walking out of the city and a man started throwing stones at him and spitting on him and he said maybe the lord told him to do that god allowed it to happen listen if we really believe that god allows things to happen we wouldn't get so upset when it happens when it actually happens we get angry or somebody cuts us off on the road some we have a little problem with our spouse or somebody else and and we get angry think why why was i why did that have to happen to me brother robert why was why me but god allowed that to happen for a purpose and it's not fatalistic because he wants us to care he wants us to work he wants us to do but at the same time he had everything exactly where he wanted it to be look at the at the story of jonah jonah is running from god as hard as he can go a man running from the presence of the lord and god already knew he would run knew what the condition of his heart would be and used it for his own glory amen you think god is surprised by a situation with i'm just going to preach tonight you think god's surprised by a situation we find ourselves in he's suddenly worried about the world that we're in in 2021 he suddenly doesn't understand he said well my pastor fears for my family's this or this is going on i don't understand no he he already knew about it he already understood exactly where you would be and why you would be and what you're doing here but he puts you here for a reason so you are both what god provided for and what he has provided matthew 6 25 says therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life that's to take no anxious thought take no anxious thought we were talking about this gabe on sunday take no anxious thought for your life don't worry about it what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what you shall put on it's not the life more than meat and the body than arraignment he's saying let him provide for you let him be that that one who cares for you he said behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap or gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are are you not much better than they notice the language that he uses he said are you not much better you are much better and so he he doesn't he's not saying that god's just going to feed you like he does the fouls of the air right he's not leaving you on that level he's moving you up with the jt into another level where he's you gonna he's gonna care for you in a way i want you to watch this because it's providential god doesn't care for everyone in the same way that's true i got you thinking but it's true he cares for egypt and israel differently right he cares for esau and jacob differently brothers but he cares differently right and we'll read it in a moment but god cares differently for different levels and so it's just like me i care differently i care for you because this is the church that god has called me to and i'm responsible for it i i have to be i'm responsible for that i'm not here to play church right we're not here to if i want to be a pastor i have to be a pastor i can't i can't just play church because i'm responsible and so i have a different level for you of care than i do for somebody else i let the church down the road do whatever they want to whoever that is they may do things better or worse but that's not my responsibility this is my responsibility this is your responsibility too just on a different level you understand so you wouldn't have the care the same level of care that i would but you still have a level of care for the church that you wouldn't for some other church that's right i have a level of care for my children that i don't necessarily have for your children and i love your children but i have a different level of care i have responsibility for my own i have a right to have a family you have a right to have a family god had a right to have a family and you're his family so he said how much more would he care for you how much better are ye than sparrows he's not just caring for you like he does the sparrow he does care for the sparrow he does know every time one falls to the earth but how much more amen how much more does he care for you than he does for the sparrows listen he said which of you by taking thought can add one cubit into his stature and he goes on to talk about these things but he's telling you you cannot provide in that way for yourself because you can't change who you are and if there is not a god who cares for you providentially then you have no way of changing your outcome in other words if god doesn't care you caring doesn't make a difference right unless he cares me caring doesn't make a difference i could shout i can stream if god doesn't care no matter how much i petition him how much i lay myself down to him then it doesn't matter but if he cares for me hey man i believe he does tonight church i believe he cares for each and every one of us then if he cares for me then he watches he sees every time i fall to my knees he sees every time i cry out to him he sees every stress that i go through every problem that i have every time i get in trouble he sees all of it and he knows when i'm sick he knows what i'm hurting he knows everything about me because he cares for me and then so my caring can have an effect because he cares listen malachi 1 2 says i have loved you saith the lord yet you say wherein hastel loved us the children of israel in egypt might have said that where what good does it do to be the elect the jews down through history have kind of made a joke out of it that we're the elect of god that means we suffer like no one else it means we're persecuted like no one else what are the benefits of being the elect well the benefit is the way he cares for you and it doesn't mean that he's just gonna make everything easy for you listen church we're living in the smallest amount of time eternity is so much so much more than what we have here if he has to put us through a time here to get us ready for eternity if he has to put us through a hard hardship here to get us ready for over there he'll do what it takes he's not afraid he's not going back down why he'll allow things to come into your life sickness or something else to come in you say why did i have to go through that well you did because he cares and he cares for you in a way that is not just caring about your life here but about your life beyond the grave this is the smallest part we get focused on temporary things so much until until we're consumed with him but this is the smallest part he cares enough to send exactly what we need malachi 1 3 he says i love jacob in verse 2 and he says i hated esau in verse 3. how did he hate esau brother branham talks about that he loves him less in the sense that it's not a hate like we would have like we'd hold a grudge against him but he hates him in the sense that there was such a divide between the way he cared for jacob and the way he cared for esau right god set up the events that even when jacob was a shyster even when he went think about this the providence of god allowed esau to go out hunting one day and the day to be a certain temperature and the game to run a certain distance and everything to happen in such a way so that esau would get hungry because jacob had to have the birthright so the providence of god knowing jacob would be a shyster knowing who he would be and it didn't make it right but god still provided for him so the providence worked in esau's life in what you would say it's a negative way and that's why he says i hated esau laid his mountains in his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness i let him i let him do things that i would never let jacob do are you with me now i i treated him in a way i would never treat jacob but i treated jacob in a way that i would never treat him you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but god said that his love was elective love now watch he said the proof of his love is election and no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation but now because he chose you he doesn't stop there as an impersonal god who chose you and then leaves you but he continues to care for you right and so brother brown said he cared for his elected people in the days of the destruction of egypt it's that next slide he cared for his elected people in the days of the destruction of egypt they was down there in egypt and become slaves now again they were down there for years and if you'd have asked them how do you care how does he care for us remember when they first heard the message things got worse many times when you start trying to do something for god when the church starts turning the right direction the devil gets mad things start getting worse for a while it's going to because because and so they they hear the message and immediately it just causes them hardships they got to make bricks without straw immediately they got problems huh why because he cared he said well if he cared i'd have money in the bank account not necessarily if he cared he would he would have i'd have a good job not necessarily it's because he cares that you are where you're at now whether that's to wake you up and make something out of your life they needed to be there for that long for a reason and the cup of the iniquity of the emirates had to be full god had his own purposes all along but there had to be they had to reach a place to where amram and yokabad were down there praying all night brother brown tells the story and how that they had to want a deliverer they had to care god had to bring them to a state of care to where they cared enough to be delivered realize church that many times that's what god's doing in our life is he's actually bringing us to a place where we care enough to be delivered where we don't come to church the way we always came to church we don't just sit like we always said but we care enough god help us tonight to be delivered from our present condition to be what god wants us to be i watch people and then excuse me but they get in the worst messes of life and then they pity themselves say well god doesn't care about me and so they become more like they are and if they were halfway christians they become more like that see if that got you into that place it's not going to get you out of it god brought you to that place because he wants you to care he wants to create in your care don't you see that tonight church he wants us to care i've noticed that it's in my days of desperation i've noticed this for years when i really begin to get down to business with god there's something i don't understand that's when god really anoints me that's when god moves in my life because he he wants me to care and so it allows things to happen so that i'll care and it's not that i don't care at the other times but that needs to be a desperation in my life so brother mayor said he cared for his elected people in the days of moses he cared for the people he sent them what a prophet amen he said is that right and he separated his people from the unbelieving world from the coming judgment of that day he said well he hadn't done nothing for me lately wait a minute did you hear the same message i heard what did it mean to you was it just a man talking out there somewhere was it just another preacher when the going got rough did you give up on it or was it a call to your heart and your soul that that showed you that god cared so much that he wanted to deliver you out of denominationalism he wanted to separate you from those who would go down with the mark of the beast he wanted to make a difference and establish a connection where he could say i loved him so much it was just if i hated the others amen said did he do it he cared when egypt had heaped their sins so high until god had to send judgment because he had already told abraham and i will deal with that nation so instead of pouring out his wrath upon all of them he sent his care to them he sent his comforter to them he sent his word to them he cares he wants you to care he wants me to care but he already cares he cared enough to send his word that would separate us from the world not just in how we dress or how we look or how we have church but it would separate us in judgment so that we would be judged here we would not be judged over there so he deals in many ways more strictly with us here because we're his children amen so we receive correction so he sent his word to them deuteronomy 11 and 10 and i've read this to you before it's one of my my favorite old testament scriptures because it's just such an example of the difference between egypt and canaan but he said for the land whither thou goest and to possess it as not as the land of egypt from which you come out without soweth thy seed and water spit with thy foot as a garden of herbs so he's telling them he said there's a land of providence and it's better than a man-made system can i go a little bit farther and say the land of providence is better than my man-made system or yours whatever your your idea of what your life should be his land of providence is better than your man-made system right your plan the land that you go to possess is the land he says of hills and valleys right we've talked about that before it drinketh water the rain of heaven so if there's no rain it's dry it depends dependent on the ring where egypt was a society that had built the greatest civilization in the world based on a man-made system that would water the the crops whether there was rain or not that would create an oasis in the desert so that the people would always have water to protect against times like we hear about in joseph where there was a famine in the land but they protected against that by building canals and building all these these waterways so that they could irrigate the land and so they weren't dependent you know i found that when we lived in pigott that and the stewart could correct me i may be wrong about this but the way i understood it that the farmers down there the worst thing they could have is too much rain because in the ground you know soggy and stuff it cost them more money if it got real dry but they still watered the crops the crops didn't go without water because you're pumping water out of all the drainage canals and out of the mississippi river whatever that it is the water the crops are always going to get water it's a man-made system but this land they would go to is a land where they would be dependent on the reign of heaven so he says in verse 12 he said it's a land which the lord thy god careth for amen he cares for the land he cares for our land today the promises he cares he keeps the promises watered in our life as long as we care right that's that's what a prophet of god taught us now he said for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even until the end of the year his eyes are always upon it and what does that mean what does that care mean and it shall come to pass if you shall hearken diligently if you hearken diligently unto my commandments see this thing's just not automatic there's not a district presbyter somewhere turning on the spigot there's something that we've got to do we've got to be ready to have church we got to be ready to worship god we're not waiting on somebody to send us excuse me a message at a certain time and we just sit here and receive it but i'm waiting to hear from god what's my job what's brother stewart's job with aaron's job what is their job is to it's to wait on god and we prepare but we prepare according to that inspiration that we get believing that god has given that to us for a reason you don't take that lightly you don't take that half harley's diligently we hearken diligently to to hear from god because we believe that god has a better idea of how to care for the people then some sermon on youtube some sermon somewhere else god has a better idea so we look into the word we don't look to man's opinion we look to the word because god knows how to give us exactly what we have need of excuse me tonight i'm getting a little bit but you just you just pray for me i i want to see god move i believe we've seen god move but there's always more listen if we step back if we push back if we let ourselves be pushed back by the world and just become like everybody else and just drift along with the time anything goes it don't matter whether you come to church or not it doesn't matter whether you whether you believe the word or not what do you do what a prophet said don't matter anymore if you get to that place you'll have the same results that everybody else does when they go to that place because this is a land that relies on rain from heaven and so what did he say he said i will give you if you hearken diligently i will give you the reign of your land in this new season amen if you serve him with all your heart with all your soul verse 14 i will give you the reign of your land and its two seasons the first strain and the latter rain that thou mayest is gathering thy corn and thy wine in that oil he said you can have that stimulation of revelation you can be fed by the word of god but you've got to hearken diligently to the word to do that when brother stewart comes and preaches sunday morning you've got a heart condition you've got to be willing to reach out i'm not rebuking you i'm just saying that's what we have to do i've got to do it you've got to do it and sometimes god will put you in a straight you know he'll break down your body he'll do something to put you in a straight where you have to listen to him sometimes i have to get stirred up a little sometimes i think god uses people just to make me a little bit upset because he wants me to dig he wants me to repent he wants me to move it's true brother you said god don't do that he did it for brother branham he wanted him to move so he showed him a vision and said if you if you remain here this is what you're going to do you're going to knock that man over the hill that comes up there that ricky said bypass your troubles god will do that too for you aren't you glad for a god who cares listen brother branham says if they're ready to confess and repent and believe and accept god cares but you got to care first he said you've got to accept what he sent you so in other words before you can receive his care you've got to accept what he sent you you just stop there for a moment see people don't really doubt the gift they doubt the giver because if brother joe gives me a gift even if he throws it at me no matter what the delivery is i expect it to be a good gift because brother joe is a good giver now myself i'm not a very good giver i love to give but i'm not good at it you've met people like that i'll probably give you something you don't need so you're probably going to get a gift card and so but you begin to expect a level of gift from a person who's a good giver and so see when you brother branham talked about how you had to have respect for an office you're not having respect for the person you have respect for the office the person's in and you've got to believe i can't help you if you don't at least believe that i'm hearing from god even if it was god speaking through a donkey you understand it if you've got to make me a donkey in your mind to have god speak through me then so be it right because you can't get nothing unless you have respect for the office because the problem you have is really not with the gift it's with the giver and people who constantly complain about the gift if you give somebody a gift for the howard and they just constantly complain about it what are you going to think every time you see them they complain about it what are you going to what are you going to expect you say well i'm not they're not upset at the gift it's me it's the giver you understand people are not when they reject ministry they're not rejecting ministry they're rejecting the one who because it we read the quote saturday sunday afternoon god said in the church you're not rejecting the gift you're rejecting the giver oh god and you've got to trust him enough to not prepare the way before you and say well i'll come to church if everything's just right no you've got to respect and love him enough that you'll come to church if everything's not right because you believe somehow that god is going to bring rain somehow god is going to provide see god has a way of providing in the desert if you're in the land right that's what he did for elijah what did he do for elijah it was in the middle of a desert god said go up to the brook cherith and he was provided for and the ravens brought him food the ravens brought him a sandwich why did they do that he could expect that because god was going to take care of him he was where god wanted him to be god told him to go up there so god would provide for him while he was there don't you realize god puts you where you are today he allowed you to be where you are today than if he's big enough to allow you to be where you are in your life today he's big enough to speak through whoever is speaking it's got to be i remember they were always his people and the land had already been provided the opportunity to be cared for was there to be cared for by jehovah but how many times did god's people turn to idolatry even though they had the opportunity to be cared for by god the fact listen why do people turn so readily to idolatry because the fact that they made the idol when it ought to make them realize that it's not a real god because you made it but the fact that they made it makes them comfortable with it because with god you never know what he might do he might make you get out of your comfort zone he might make you like he does the little eagles when he pulls all the all the bark and everything out of the nest he might make you uncomfortable why because he's god he cares enough the mama eagle cares enough that she's willing to pull out all the little twigs all the rabbit fur everything that's there he's willing he cares enough she cares enough to pull all that out so that they'll be uncomfortable but so they'll go because they need to fly on their own and if we don't know that after all that we've been through in life and in the message of the hour after all these years since brother branham passed away we should know god wants us to fly he wanted us to fly listen they were still god's people but they had to remain in his care in order to benefit from it so brother branham says if you're ready to confess and repent believe and accept god cares but you got to care first you've got to accept what he sent you he said he so cared for them that they'd be sure there would be no mistake that they'd be sure that there would be no mistake listen he vindicated his prophet by a sign of a pillar of fire i love this to let the people see that it wasn't just this man walking along here but that it was god right above him and he was the one who was leading the way you see satan would attack this age so much with science that god would send even scientific vindication and show us in it with our where we could see it what god did other ages didn't have that but we were able to see why because that was the attack satan was making on this age god isn't real god doesn't care god he's somewhere else he's a god of history but god said he's praise the present tense god he said i'm a present tense god and he come down and showed himself vindicated his prophet for that reason to show that he cares god cares he said for people who cares god cares for those who care for him so he vindicated this man and proved that he was god's servant by sending them a pillar of fire to lead them to the very land aren't you glad he's the same yesterday today and forever he cares when you care but you got to care first he said you got to prove that you care so sometimes you have to come to church even though you may not get much out of it sometimes you've got to prove that you care sometimes you've got to be willing to to realize i don't know everything lord you know more than i do you got to prove that you care sometimes god will let it seem and brother adam even says this i don't have a quote tonight but he talks about how that god will make the church even seem to be against you to see if you care are you willing to push past that because you don't come here just to have a good time i don't come here brother sam just just so you can hear me preach i'd much rather hear somebody else preach but i come here because i want to i i want to worship god i want to do what he called me to do and if i i was called to be in the pulpit and so be it if you were called to be in the pew so be it or what chair or whatever you're sitting in but god called you to do that and to be that i'm not here just to have a good time and everybody pat me on the back and everybody say i did oh you did a wonderful job no if i never get an opportunity and i've said this before but i believe in my heart god help me remain this way if i never have the opportunity to preach again if this is my last sermon lord i don't want to be some some kind of a man that you can't use and throw away if you're wanting to do that if that's his desire is to use me for a while and then throw me away i have to be willing to be done that way or you can't use me in the first place i just have to be available and i preached to you about how the simon stood there when the cross of jesus when jesus was carrying his cross up the via dolorosa and here was simon standing there by the side of the road he didn't know why he was there but he was available and that's they say the number one ability is availability he was available and when the body of christ failed when the body of christ was so weak that it couldn't get back up you remember god didn't fall god knew what he was doing but god in his providence called simon to be right by the side of the road at the very intersection where the body of christ would grow to its weakest and just to pick up the cross and carry it for a while and if that's what god wants me to do if that's the only time he ever uses me let me be available are you with me or not if we have an attitude like that lord if you never use me if you prepare me for 30 years to preach one sermon let me be standing by the way because i don't do it for myself i do it for god you got to prove that you care and then god can use you i've watched that over the years if i get discouraged and disgruntled well i'm not being used to nothing sit back and kind of drag my feet that's what i got but if i prepare for that sermon like was the end of my life like it was the last day and i go preach those five people like was the last god was going to do something more for me he was going to use me more why because i cared but you got to care first you got to prove that you care amen god help us tonight do we care enough or we want to have church but do we care enough to have church when things aren't going the way we want them to be at church to be in the house of god to read the word regardless of how we feel do we care that much he cared that much excuse me i won't yell at you sunday because i won't be here just pardon me for a moment he dragged his body through 24 hours of being awake something like i think it was like nine trials that he went through through the day all the different ones that tried him sent him back to another one called him a liar spit in his face foss accused him took a a a crown of thorns and put it on his head took a a whip with 39 or with the lashes a count of nine tailing and whipped him with 39 stripes until the flesh was torn from his bones and the bible says his bone my bones they stare at me he cares so much that he put up with it and the bible says who for the joy that was set before him what was the joy for joe to be with me to be with you he cared so much that he allowed himself to be beaten i'll go through it for the sake of my bride that's what he did for our benefit up for his own for our benefit for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despised the shame was stripped naked and hung before the public as a criminal mocked and spit on his clothes were gambled on because he cared that we should ask ourselves the question do we care enough because again we couldn't repay them there's no way none of us humanly it couldn't be done humanly we couldn't experience that and go through that we'd break at some point because we're born in sin shape and iniquity but god didn't cause us to go through that but just the little trials and the momentary test that he calls us to go through if we could just care enough to go through that and when we're reviled not to revile again and when we're cursed to threaten not we care enough to be like jesus hebrews 12 1 says therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip why go back to hebrews chapter one he talks about how christ was better than the angels his word was more steadfast than the angels and he says because of this therefore we ought to give them more earnest heed because we don't do this because people will love us and i love to hear a good word just as much as anybody does but that's not why i do it if it ever becomes why i do it then it's of no benefit there's plenty of people doing it for the money there's plenty of people doing it for the fame god wants somebody will serve him because it's the it's what they're called to do and it's what they love to do we ought to give them more earnest he said for the word spoken my angel was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward he says how shall we escape if we neglect not if we despise it do away with it but if we neglect so great of salvation he cares so much for us how shall we escape if we neglect to care for him which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him excuse me if i sound just a little bit too evangelistic tonight but i think i needed this sermon if you didn't how shall we escape if we neglect you see everybody's looking for comfort today everybody wants comfort and you see that i've seen that here in america when i come back from overseas and come back into america everything's comfortable things aren't like that everywhere and i appreciated the comfort i'll be honest with you even our little little planes are more comfortable than the ones you ride on overseas and even our small airports have more amenities than theirs we like comfort especially in this nation but where do we find our comfort everybody's looking for it but see if we really understand how much he cares it becomes a comfort to us knowing that he provided a messenger to us that becomes a comfort to us he said well so-and-so doesn't like me and so-and-so doesn't but you provided a messenger with a message behold i send you elijah the prophet he didn't stop there he provided me with a church to go to he's provided with people with me with people that love me even some of you will sit and listen to me preach that's more than i deserve he cares so much and it's a comfort to us because we know if he cares for us than that then he cares for our finances he cares for our everyday life he cares for everything that we go through hebrews 2 and 4 god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders with diverse miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will in other words he says if we neglect so great of salvation this salvation didn't just come with word only but it come in power and demonstration of the spirit and it still does today do we care enough to respond to the gospel and just do what it says brother says when he was here on earth as i say he cared for the people so much till he healed their sick comforted their hearts told them about a place where he could go and prepare for them would come again to receive them unto himself he cared for them notice he cared so much until when he knew he must leave us in order to bring this great thing to us he said i'll not leave you comfortless but i will send the holy spirit he shall continue my care for you until he returns brother brown says there's no one cares like jesus knowing that his body is a high priest and a mediator of work that he's doing now that body must be in the presence of god at all times for intercession that god cannot see the sinner's sin he sees only the blood of his own son abraham and knowing that he sent back the holy spirit to continue to comfort his people does he care certainly he cares that presence that you feel tonight that that's stirring in your soul he cares enough to send that to you certainly he cares he was a comfort when he was here on earth as a man god made flesh god representing himself and expressing himself through a man christ jesus who promised that the works that i do so you do also i'm going to the father and going to send back the holy spirit which will be me in spirit form i'll be with you and dwell in you amen you care enough to comfort us like that now look when he come to the earth he comforted us the world is in a bad place today because they have no comforter and you know what i'm talking about some of you have been there many of you have there's no one to comfort and so people look for an idea or theology or doctrine or something that'll ease the nagging of their mind but he cares so much he didn't just send us a theology he sent us a person he said in ecclesiastes 4 1 that he said behold the tears i considered all the oppressions that were done in the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter we see that in the world today but he didn't leave you that way you experience the same problems the world does at times we are oppressed at times we we we feel the weight of the darkness of this world but he didn't leave you to deal with that alone you see jesus when he was here he said the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captains the recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord did you notice that how he did that ministry was he actually went out among the people and he cared for the people the bible says he was moved with compassion and yet there were a few that he cared for in a special way how did he do it well stewart he with his presence right he himself showed up at a pool called bethesda went through the 5 000 or more people that were there waiting at the water's edge and it comes down to one man and said do you want to be well do you care enough to be well he tells his disciples how much needs go by samaria and he go up makes his way to samaria and sits on a well at a certain time of day knowing that his disciples wouldn't understand he sends them into the village to buy food and so he sits there and waits on a harlot a woman who was no good who had six husbands five husbands the one she was with wasn't hers and so she was sitting there or he was sitting there waiting on her that's his providential care he loved her so much so that ought to make us excited tonight because don't you realize you're in that same place i'm in that same place he loved you so much that he come by hardy i don't know why the message come to hardy arkansas but god saw he cared so much that he provided you with a message right here in the place where you are he provided you with a church to go to he cared so much that he sat down by your will where you went to draw water and get whatever comfort you could find and he cared so much to find you in a shoe factory he cared so much to find you in a church home he cared you so much maybe you were in a cult maybe you were in a denomination but he cared so much that he found you anyway hallelujah amen he cared so much that he found me found you would you care back can you care back is there something in you does it create a care in you he cared for the woman at the well he cared for legion he had a need to cross over because there was a man there who needed to be delivered he cared he said how do we know he cares his presence is proof that he cares and how much more present can he be than he is in this day when a mighty angel come down in revelation 10 with an open book and put his feet on the land and on the sea how much more could he care than to show you that he's present hey bed amen listen he said he would send us another comforter in john 14 and 16 and verse 17 said even the spirit of truth in the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him free dwelleth with you and shall be in you verse 18 he says i will not leave you comfortless that word is orphanos it or orphaned it i will not leave you without parental care we don't like to leave our children even as they get older we like to stay kind of close by leave our son at camp but we don't like to be that far away god said i don't want to be far away from you i don't want to be a distant god i care for you so much i will not leave you without my care so it's more than just he does care that's how he carries his election but it's also a care of a father that gives us but the random says the people try to get together in this insane social life i wonder if he was prophesying about facebook and twitter and youtube and instagram the people try to get together in this insane social life he said don't tell me the world's not insane doing the way it's doing it sure is certainly it's a neurotic world and by the grace of god is the only way we'll escape it he said notice in this social life the people has come to a place that they socialize little clans and they get into there and think we're better than the next group see he said and it's just done that way and now we find all those things is because people are trying to find comfort they're trying to find something he said remember if you haven't heard anything else i've said tonight remember this remember your comfort is your religion if your comfort is everybody speaking well of you that's your religion if your comfort is what the world thinks that's your religion if your comfort is how many likes you get on facebook then facebook is your religion your comfort is your religion and you make those things your religion see so what a pity and realizing that death lays right before you you need a better comfort than the lights on facebook no matter what we go through in life it's still just a vapor it appears for a little while and it vanishes away brother branham says this he says we try to find comfort by saying i don't have to listen he said no that's true you don't have to listen but if you are predestinated to eternal life you will listen to it and you'll rejoice to it hallelujah i want to be one that rejoices to it amen i realize that the tear and the wheat both rejoice but they both rejoice i realize there's fake out there there's a fake dollar bill but brother branham told us that a fake was a reason to believe that there's a real amen there's got to be something real we try to find comfort by saying i don't have to listen it's true you don't have to listen but if you're predestined to eternal life you will listen to it and you'll rejoice to it it's your comfort it's the thing that you've longed for all your life it's that pearl that you're ready to forsake everything amen you want it because you know it's god's loving care for you it's something to settle the sin question to settle the unbelief to settle everything to you if you want it you don't have to live life wondering what's right embarrassing and ashamed if you want it you can settle it but i don't you don't realize what i've been through brother ben you don't realize how many people have hurt me you're still serving the god of excuses but there's a real and a living god we'll settle everything for you if you wanted but the random says this and i'm closing in just a moment jesus cared on us for the message of today to bring these same things to pass as he said until he died and rose again to send them by the holy spirit the comforter to show his ministry today that he's still alive he cared enough won't we care he said that's the thing won't we care he died for this ministry think about this he died in order that the holy spirit could be here in this day to show these things what did he do he ascended up on a high and then he gave gifts unto men he died in order that the holy spirit could be here in this day to show these things and he reserved that one that gift of a prophet and that elijah ministry to come at the end time why because he cares he died in order that the holy spirit could be here in this day to show these things he cared for you he cared to bring it here he cared to make the statement he cared because he loved you he cared enough to do it to send the holy spirit to this he said to make this ministry today he said that's how he proved he cared in that day because he come to vindicate what god said he would be that's the reason the woman recognized him she said i know when messiah cometh he's a prophet messiah cometh he'll tell us these things see he cared enough about the word of god to vindicate it to her he said now he sent the holy ghost and in this day of intellectual conception and he might by the same holy spirit prove through us that he's still the messiah prove it in the same way hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever he said now the question is do you care what do you think about it it's here it's been proven over and over do you care not to believe it do you care not to confess your sins that you're wrong confess your unbelief and accept it you care not to accept it he cared enough to die and rise again to bring it to you do you care enough to accept it amen he cared enough to conquer every enemy for you do you believe that tonight amen musicians go ahead and come we're closing he cared enough he cared enough to conquer every enemy from you and all you have to do is be sincere and believe it he conquered death that ain't nothing for me to conquer it's already conquered sickness ain't for me to conquer it ain't for christ to conquer it's already conquered i just have to care enough to believe it he said are you afraid of what somebody else has told you are you afraid of the doctor's diagnosis are you afraid of what the church will say to you are you afraid to stand there total total the devil say i've confessed my sins i've laid aside everything i believed every word here i am lord you realize what that woman at the well had to do she didn't have to go apologize for somebody else she went and preached the gospel in her own way you understand she went and testified to a bunch of men that she'd recently been living with god help us today but she cared so much about what a uh what a the son of god come to tell her about the word for that day that she went and testified to him anyway and brother brown said she cared about the word and she cared about her people do we care enough about the word and enough about our people to be at the house of god to confess our sins i don't care what anybody else thinks i'm going to serve god no matter what i've been no matter where i've been no matter what i've done or someone else has done here i am lord i believed every word created me a care you cared for me i care for you first peter 5 and 6 says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he careth for you hey man let's bow our heads together if you could just play something softly mr mary [Music] he cares enough and i had to think today yesterday and i actually had prepared to preach this a couple of weeks ago and we had a snowstorm and i didn't preach it and then i was looking over it this week and it just becomes such a burden on my heart and i said lord this must be the time that you wanted this to preach i don't know why i don't pretend to know i'm always a little amused when people think i'm preaching at them because i don't have that much control over what i say [Music] sometimes i don't i stand up here and i think god why'd i say that he has to be able to speak because he cares i just have to be the the conduit and the something that can plug in a microphone he can speak through yes i study and i prepare and i put all the notes up here but god has to move through that i could read all those notes in 20 minutes believe it or not god has to care enough to speak to our hearts god has to do that he won't care he does care but we can't receive the benefits of that care unless we care would you just in your heart tonight here in the building and those of you that are watching that i know you can't come on wednesday night it's just too far for many maybe you've worked all day and you're tired and it's been hard to listen but he cares for you [Music] if you just take a moment and realize how much he cares [Music] he cares enough to give you what you need not what you want to provide for you what you have need of whether that's a a great speaker or a poor one whether it's a mighty man or a valor or a timid man hiding in a in a well that god called the mighty man of valor whatever it is god cared enough to send it to you [Music] god cared enough to inspire me to preach he cares enough to inspire you to hear and he cared enough for you to come to church even when it's hard and maybe you've done it for year after year after year after year but he still cares he still wants to move in your life he still wants to make you different he wants to make you better the shame is not in falling down the shame is in not getting up everybody falls down everybody makes mistakes but if we won't get up that's on us because he cared so much to send us the message of the hour a deliverance message so that we could be god's people here in the end time would you just return that care to him in your hearts tonight lord lord created me a care created me a care lord if there's something if i've gone calloused if i'm if i'm not as as warm as i should be to the gospel if i've grown cold in my relationship with you and maybe that's caused me to grow cold in my relationship with others because the bible says because iniquity shall abound the love of many will grow cold sin causes that if i could just be warm again if i could just if i could just care again if there was just something in my heart that would supersede the emotions of the flesh and supersede the tiredness and supersede that say lord you cared for me i i care for you you created me a care lord [Music] i pray you granted heavenly father lord jesus i'm placing myself here on the altars these people here on a wednesday night lord let this be our prayer meeting tonight god you cared enough for us to send us a message of this day you cared and i thought i could think back and look over my life and see different ministries you cared enough for me to send a minister by my way and preach to me and i'm so grateful they weren't perfect men but you cared enough to send somebody by my way so that they could preach the truth i don't want to try to manipulate it lord i don't want to try to change it let it come lord if it hurts it hurts oh god created a care for the word of god created me a hunger for the things of god a desire to be in the house of god i want to lord because i know i get what i want and what i want is you most of all lord would you just create that in my life in my heart i pray you'd grant it lord i know god that there'd be many battles ahead to fight but we're getting awful close whatever battle lays in front of us i'm sure this world won't get any better it just keeps getting worse and worse but oh god whatever battle is left there to fight sometimes it's scary sometimes it feels like it's giants sometimes it feels like the sons of anak are growing up everywhere and there's just so many heads so hard to chop off but god if you could just if you could just let us grab the sword of the word and begin to chop lord if you could just anoint the ministry to grab the sword of the word and begin to chop against the devil that's what you want lord you want us to give us give it your our all you gave it your oh lord i'm so grateful for that creating us a care that it doesn't matter whether we're whether we're used and abused and thrown aside we'll still love you we'll still serve your people because that's what you want more than anything else you don't want sacrifice it's not how many sermons i could preach you want obedience oh god if obeying you means that this is the last sermon i ever preached god forbid that it would be if it was if that's what obeying you meant let me obey you lord let me follow you i pray and grant it now i pray you touch every heart thank you for these people who've come on a wednesday night i pray you bless every one of them lord everyone will hear this god i i don't mean to be the scold lord i'm scolding myself tonight i want to be right i want to be right not because i feel like i'll be lost but i want to be right because that's what you want lord i want to be right because i want to know that when i lay my head on the pillow at night that i've done what you required i've come your provided way i've not busted pulled and run off to tarsus but i've i've followed you lord i pray you granted god we don't want to run from your presence we want to run to it because that's your will in our hour i pray you'd grant it lord thank you for these people i pray you'd bless them abundantly during this week we pray in jesus name [Music] hallelujah oh i'm learning to lean on jesus [Music] couldn't you just worship him a moment isn't he worthy of our praise tonight just for a few minutes before we go he's
