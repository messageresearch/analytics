[45:18] isn't it good to be back in the house of
[45:19] the Lord on a Sunday morning I know U
[45:23] we've had some sick and good to see some
[45:26] you back this morning brother Jeff good
[45:27] to see you back this morning and and
[45:29] each one of you that's been sick or been
[45:31] out and and then we've got others that
[45:33] are still out and some that are
[45:34] traveling it's kind of a busy time of
[45:36] year let's just take a moment and set
[45:39] aside for the word of God today can we
[45:41] do that and just really feed on the word
[45:44] I I uh little under the weather myself
[45:47] so you have to bear with me and uh and
[45:50] just uh you know but sometimes it seems
[45:52] like when we're weak in body that's when
[45:54] the Holy Spirit becomes most real to us
[45:58] so I trust that'll be the case today
[46:00] Ruth 1 and verse
[46:03] 6 I want to go back as we preached last
[46:06] time that I preached on a Sunday morning
[46:09] I I preached come home to Bethlehem this
[46:12] morning this morning I want to speak on
[46:15] faithful messengers of the bride's
[46:17] Revival faithful messengers of the
[46:20] bride's
[46:21] Revival amen do you love the Lord amen
[46:24] are you happy to be in church amen amen
[46:30] ruth6 says then she arose with her
[46:34] daughters-in-law that she might return
[46:37] from the country of Moab for she had
[46:41] heard somehow she found out she heard
[46:44] somebody told her in the country of Moab
[46:48] how that the Lord had visited his people
[46:52] in giving them bread pray the Lord would
[46:55] add his Blessing L to the word you may
[46:56] be seated this
[47:04] morning Naomi had been in Moab for 10
[47:08] years her husband IMC had let his family
[47:11] there perhaps thinking they would go
[47:14] briefly and come home that's usually the
[47:16] way it starts isn't it it seems like
[47:19] well uh you know it's not working what
[47:21] we're doing and so we'll just do
[47:23] something different for a while and and
[47:26] you stray away from the word of God and
[47:27] you find out that when you do that it's
[47:30] much harder to come home than what you
[47:32] realized and it takes much longer and
[47:34] the road is much more difficult than
[47:36] what you realize to come home but I'm
[47:39] here to encourage you this morning that
[47:41] it's still worth it to come home the
[47:43] road though it may be difficult though
[47:45] you may face difficulties of all kinds
[47:48] and struggles of all kinds yet you need
[47:50] to come home it's worth it to come back
[47:53] to Bethlehem because there's been
[47:55] there's there been a return of bread to
[47:58] Bethlehem there's been a return of the
[48:00] spirit of God of the water of God of of
[48:03] The Well of Bethlehem has got water in
[48:05] it again and and the and the fields of
[48:08] Bethlehem have wheat in them again and
[48:10] so it's worth it to come back to
[48:13] Bethlehem in fact we must go back to
[48:16] Bethlehem as I heard someone say the
[48:17] other day that there are some people who
[48:20] God will allow to go uh uh Beyond his
[48:23] word and he doesn't stop them he just
[48:25] lets go but if you're the elect of God
[48:27] today you can only go so far he would
[48:30] only let Jonas go so far and then he
[48:32] turned him
[48:34] around aren't you glad for that today he
[48:37] would only let you go so far and then he
[48:39] turns you all the way
[48:43] around so the reason that they left
[48:46] initially was
[48:48] famine and it's always better to stay in
[48:52] the land than to leave and I want
[48:55] encourage you young people stay with the
[48:58] word of God keep doing what you're doing
[49:00] keep doing what the Bible says keep keep
[49:03] walking with God don't don't let
[49:05] anything discourage you from being what
[49:07] God called you to be stay in the land
[49:11] it's much better to stay there are many
[49:13] scars that you won't have many things
[49:15] that you won't have to deal with in your
[49:17] life amen and yet if you do stray
[49:20] there's a home to come back
[49:22] to and so there will be famines there
[49:26] there have been famines in the land and
[49:28] there were nine famines in in the Bible
[49:31] in Israel during the Old Testament nine
[49:34] different famines and the Jews say that
[49:37] the 10th would be Amos 811 where he said
[49:39] behold the days come sayith the Lord God
[49:41] I will send a famine in the land not a
[49:43] famine of bread nor a thirst for water
[49:46] but of hearing the words of the Lord and
[49:49] I believe we're living in that kind of a
[49:50] time today in that kind of a a famine as
[49:53] far as the world is concerned not for us
[49:56] I believe we have heard the word of the
[49:58] Lord yes so there was a famine in the
[50:01] land
[50:05] and Moses brought the people out of
[50:08] Israel he promised them a land flowing
[50:10] with milk and honey a productive land
[50:13] aren't you glad that God didn't just
[50:14] give us a land uh that that wasn't
[50:17] productive but he give us a a word he
[50:19] give us a place to be he give us a
[50:22] manner of life that we could live it we
[50:24] could be happy we we could have our
[50:26] healing we could we could have salvation
[50:28] for our children he didn't just leave us
[50:30] in a place where we didn't have what we
[50:32] needed aren't you glad you've got what
[50:34] you need today whatever you have need of
[50:36] it's there for you and so we have what
[50:40] we needed and the land was a land that
[50:42] had what they needed and yet it was a
[50:44] land that was uh dependent excuse me on
[50:47] rain it was dependent on rain and and we
[50:50] know that was different from Egypt and
[50:52] I've been over this before but just to
[50:54] kind of drop it in here so we we can get
[50:56] a picture of where I want to go today
[50:58] Egypt was very different Egypt had
[51:00] famines but it was only when the Nile
[51:02] did not flood in the spring because of
[51:04] snow melt in the mountains which was a
[51:06] very rare thing and so most years the
[51:09] Nile
[51:13] flooded I'm gonna get all that out of
[51:15] there in a
[51:16] minute most years the Nile flooded and I
[51:19] just don't get too close to
[51:20] me uh most most years the Nile flooded
[51:23] and and when it did it it it was caus
[51:26] the land to be fertile and the land
[51:28] become uh it become a uh a place where
[51:32] they could grow crops and a place where
[51:33] they could uh uh they could uh uh they
[51:36] could control the amount of water that
[51:39] the crops get and I've been there but
[51:40] the Joel's been there we've actually
[51:42] seen that they have the canals and
[51:44] things that go away from the Nile River
[51:46] you're going to have to fight with me
[51:47] today I'm fighting this cold and you're
[51:49] just going to have to fight with me so
[51:51] uh so if I stop talking you just going
[51:53] to have to start talking
[51:56] so now we know that the snow would melt
[51:59] and and they could control that and so
[52:02] uh so but Israel was not that kind of a
[52:04] land in Deuteronomy
[52:06] 11:10 it says for the land whether thou
[52:09] goest to possess it is not as the land
[52:11] of Egypt from whence you come out where
[52:13] thou sest thy seed and wat to it with
[52:15] thy foot as a garden of herbs but the
[52:17] land whether you go to possess it is a
[52:19] land of Hills and Valleys and drinketh
[52:22] water of the rain of Heaven a lamb which
[52:24] the Lord thy God carth for yes yes good
[52:30] land the Lord thy God carth for do you
[52:32] believe that you're that kind of land
[52:34] today something the Lord thy God cares
[52:36] for He said the eyes of the Lord thy God
[52:39] are always upon it from the beginning of
[52:41] the year even until the end of the year
[52:42] so he says God actually
[52:47] controls he actually controls the the
[52:50] rain the amount of moisture that they
[52:53] would get and the ability of the land to
[52:55] begin to produce what was on it and so
[52:58] it would not be a denominational land
[53:01] right come
[53:03] on I'm gonna get this out it would not
[53:06] be a denominational land so in other
[53:08] words denominations control Revival yeah
[53:12] all right I may just have to talk to you
[53:14] this morning denominations control
[53:15] Revival yes and and they control it in
[53:18] the way that uh they they bring in the
[53:21] best speakers
[53:24] and
[53:27] they bring in the best uh they bring in
[53:29] the best of all the uh singers and they
[53:31] bring in the they have the uh choirs and
[53:34] they have uh light shows and and
[53:36] everything like that but that's not how
[53:38] we produce Revival that's right we don't
[53:41] produce Revival with light shows we
[53:43] don't produce Revival with choirs we we
[53:46] have the uh the the Revival is on the
[53:49] inside do you believe that today aren't
[53:51] you glad for a Revival on the
[53:54] inside
[54:06] aren't you glad for a Revival that's not
[54:07] dependent on the
[54:09] weather a Revival that's only dependent
[54:12] on the word of God and the word of God
[54:14] says you can have Revival no matter if
[54:16] there's music or not
[54:18] right you believe that today
[54:22] yeah but Joel you may have take over in
[54:24] a minute
[54:31] it's a land of pro
[54:34] Providence a land that you can a land
[54:37] that you can you you can depend on God
[54:41] for and that's the way our lives are
[54:44] it's something you can depend on God for
[54:47] not a denomination amen and he says in
[54:50] Deuteronomy
[54:52] 11:13 and it shall come to pass if you
[54:54] shall hearken d dently into my
[54:55] Commandments which I command you this
[54:57] day to love the Lord your
[54:59] God to serve him with all your heart
[55:01] with all your soul that I will give you
[55:03] the rain of your land isn't that a great
[55:05] promise today yes the first rain and the
[55:08] latter rain yes I will send grass in the
[55:11] fields for that cattle th mayest eat and
[55:13] be
[55:15] full he said take heed to yourselves
[55:18] that your heart be not deceived and you
[55:20] turn aside serve other gods and worship
[55:23] them right then the Lord's wrath be
[55:25] against you and he shut up the
[55:27] heaven that there' be no rain so there's
[55:29] a reason why that there was a famine in
[55:31] the land right and the reason is because
[55:33] they left God come on there's always a
[55:36] reason why yeah that there's a famine in
[55:39] the land and the reason is because we
[55:41] leave God yes all right right come on he
[55:44] never left us
[55:46] right you know it's like the old story
[55:48] of the the husband and wife that had set
[55:51] when they were first dating and engaged
[55:54] and and first got married they used to
[55:56] sit right close together on the front
[55:57] seat of the car you know the old cars
[56:00] didn't have nothing in the middle you
[56:01] can sit right close and uh and uh but
[56:04] Dan he says amen he remembers those days
[56:07] and he they sat right close on the front
[56:10] seat and then and then over time you
[56:13] find that she's sitting against this
[56:14] door and he's sitting against that door
[56:16] and the wife began to complain she said
[56:18] you know I I I feel like we're just not
[56:20] as close as we used to be and the
[56:22] husband looked over he said well I'm
[56:24] still driving
[56:25] who
[56:27] Moved he said I didn't move oh my that's
[56:31] the way God is God didn't move we
[56:34] moved or aren't you glad he he's always
[56:37] there if you want to get up close to him
[56:39] again you can get up close to him
[56:42] again so he tells them stay close to the
[56:46] word so they will not stray into
[56:49] idolatry and be unable to possess the
[56:53] land yes stay close to the word so you
[56:57] will not stray into idolatry and be
[56:59] unable to possess the land he said take
[57:02] the words and in your heart and in your
[57:04] soul bind them for a sign on your hand
[57:07] frontlets between your eyes teach them
[57:09] to your children speak of them when you
[57:11] sit in the house and when th walkest by
[57:14] the way when thou liest down when thou
[57:15] risest up yes and thou shalt write them
[57:18] upon the doorpost of that house upon the
[57:20] gates that that your days may be
[57:22] multiplied and the days of your children
[57:24] in the
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] lamb which the Lord your swearing your
[57:29] fathers to give them as the days of
[57:31] Heaven on the earth aren't you glad
[57:32] that's a promise
[57:35] today
[57:37] good he said if you'll diligently keep
[57:39] all these
[57:41] Commandments to love the Lord your God
[57:43] to walk in all his ways to cleave un to
[57:45] him then will the Lord drive out all
[57:46] these nations from before you you shall
[57:50] possess greater Nations and mightier
[57:52] than yourselves oh what a promise that
[57:54] is today yes I can do more than I think
[57:57] I can do yeah do you believe that today
[58:00] do you really believe that you can press
[58:02] forward you can do more all right than
[58:04] what you think you can
[58:06] do from the time they came into the Land
[58:08] There was a cycle of Revival and death
[58:10] just Revival and death constantly and it
[58:13] was not because God didn't keep his
[58:15] promise it was because he did keep his
[58:18] promise he's promised he said if that
[58:21] you serve other gods he said I'll
[58:23] withhold the reign he said because I
[58:25] want you to love me yeah I want you to
[58:27] serve me you believe he still wants you
[58:29] to do that
[58:31] today he said I want you to be there
[58:33] right there with me yeah I want I he
[58:35] wants to be close to
[58:37] you
[58:39] somehow after spending a Whole Decade in
[58:43] Moab Naomi found out that the Lord had
[58:47] visited his people somehow she found out
[58:53] that he was a merciful god God yeah
[58:56] there there's a concept in the scripture
[58:57] and I want to get this to you this
[58:59] morning and I won't keep you long
[59:01] because I
[59:03] can't but there's a concept that David
[59:05] introduces in the scripture of forever
[59:09] Mercy or enduring
[59:11] Mercy right and it matters who you are
[59:14] yeah I believe every one of us are is
[59:16] someone that God has called if God
[59:17] didn't call you you wouldn't be here and
[59:20] if God has called you there's enduring
[59:23] Mercy for you there's forever Mercy for
[59:27] you and if you go in the Psalms David
[59:29] over and over says praise the Lord for
[59:31] his Mercy endure forever well come on
[59:34] his mercy endureth forever oh I'm so
[59:37] glad that when I mess up his mercy
[59:39] endureth
[59:40] forever when I can't do what I want to
[59:43] do his mercy endureth
[59:47] for he says in Psalm
[59:51] 1387 he said though I walk in the midst
[59:53] of trouble thou will revive me Thou
[59:56] shalt stretch forth thy hand against the
[59:58] wrath of mine enemies thy right hand
[1:00:00] shall save me the Lord will perfect that
[1:00:03] which concerneth me thy mercy oh Lord
[1:00:07] endureth forever do you believe that
[1:00:09] today thy mercy oh
[1:00:13] Lord aren't you glad for a merciful god
[1:00:16] he said forsake not the works of thine
[1:00:18] own hands yes so there was always a
[1:00:21] promise of Revival he said If my people
[1:00:24] what you're called by my name shall
[1:00:26] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[1:00:28] face and turn from their Wicked Ways
[1:00:30] then will I hear from Heaven I will
[1:00:32] forgive their sin will heal their land
[1:00:36] oh aren't you glad for that promise
[1:00:38] today amen and I know some people say
[1:00:40] well it's been too long since I've been
[1:00:42] in
[1:00:43] church it it's been too long since I've
[1:00:46] served
[1:00:47] God but he has enduring Mercy yes it's
[1:00:51] been too long since I've really prayed
[1:00:52] and felt his presence I but been I've
[1:00:54] been just mailing it in I've been going
[1:00:56] through the motions but he has enduring
[1:00:59] Mercy
[1:01:00] yes you know it been 2,000 years since
[1:01:04] the Jews rejected
[1:01:06] Christ
[1:01:08] 2,000 years since they said let his
[1:01:11] blood be on us and on our children but
[1:01:14] yet they will have their day of
[1:01:18] atonement why that's God's chosen people
[1:01:21] right right they will have their days of
[1:01:23] atonement and there will be an elect
[1:01:25] group of those Jews that will actually
[1:01:28] believe on Christ at the end time they
[1:01:32] will have they will receive the Holy
[1:01:33] Ghost they will have their day of
[1:01:35] atonement even 2,000 years later why
[1:01:39] because of the enduring mercy of
[1:01:41] God and so the Bible tells us that there
[1:01:44] would be there would be H there would be
[1:01:48] cities in Judah again there would be
[1:01:51] there would be uh the voice of joy in
[1:01:52] Jeremiah 33:11 the voice of of
[1:01:55] gladness the voice of the bridegroom and
[1:01:57] the voice of the Bride the voice of them
[1:01:59] that shall say praise the Lord of hosts
[1:02:01] for the Lord is good for his mercy
[1:02:03] endureth forever oh my what do they
[1:02:06] realize that God God's mercy went
[1:02:09] further than their
[1:02:13] Disobedience do you really believe today
[1:02:15] that God's mercy goes beyond your
[1:02:19] Disobedience can we really grab a hold
[1:02:21] of that concept that even if I miss
[1:02:25] it even if I miss the will of the Lord
[1:02:28] even if I mess up even if I don't do
[1:02:30] maybe haven't done everything I should
[1:02:31] do God's mercy went beyond my
[1:02:34] Disobedience and he called me out anyway
[1:02:37] and he loved me anyway and he trusted me
[1:02:40] anyway aren't you glad for that yes sir
[1:02:43] wonderful
[1:02:45] yes and when they come this
[1:02:49] time you realize they'll never backside
[1:02:52] again yeah yeah but JT all those years
[1:02:58] Jehovah had trouble because Israel just
[1:03:00] constantly kept backslide right they
[1:03:02] constantly kept going back to other gods
[1:03:05] he said I'm going to bring them to a
[1:03:06] place yes where they'll never backside
[1:03:08] again right he's I'm GNA put the son of
[1:03:11] David back on the
[1:03:13] throne right Christ is coming back on
[1:03:15] the throne the son of David why is he
[1:03:17] doing that because there will become a
[1:03:19] Time Israel won't back slide again you
[1:03:21] realize that's the that's the time he's
[1:03:22] called us to as well he's called a bride
[1:03:24] that would not fall he called a people
[1:03:27] oh my though we may backslide in our in
[1:03:30] our flesh and our spirit yet they sealed
[1:03:33] Us in to the day of our Redemption that
[1:03:35] we will not fall
[1:03:38] again we'll be home as they will be home
[1:03:41] because his mercy endureth yes forever
[1:03:46] yes and and we found for the entire
[1:03:48] church age that the cycle of Revival and
[1:03:51] death continues yeah it just keeps going
[1:03:54] right over Revival and death Revival and
[1:03:57] death Disobedience followed by famine
[1:04:00] followed by desperation followed by
[1:04:03] visitation followed by
[1:04:06] Disobedience and the cycle continues for
[1:04:08] Seven Ages but there had to come a time
[1:04:11] when the cycle would be broken we're
[1:04:13] living in that
[1:04:15] time and and and what I want to the
[1:04:19] concept that I want to get to this
[1:04:21] morning is that there must be
[1:04:24] somebody to tell
[1:04:28] Naomi somebody's got to be got to be a
[1:04:31] witness yes of what's going on in
[1:04:34] Bethlehem all right that can tell Naomi
[1:04:37] who
[1:04:38] strayed that there's there's wheat in
[1:04:40] Bethlehem again there's bread in
[1:04:43] Bethlehem again there's water there's
[1:04:45] been rain in Bethlehem all right so
[1:04:48] there's got to be somebody faithful who
[1:04:51] stayed true to God and I trust that's us
[1:04:53] this morning got to be somebody who's
[1:04:55] been faithful and trustworthy to
[1:04:58] actually bring the message that they
[1:05:01] that that they will believe when you
[1:05:03] tell them that there's something going
[1:05:06] on in Bethlehem and so the one came and
[1:05:11] and told Naomi about this visitation and
[1:05:15] in order for her to believe it I think
[1:05:16] first of all it would have to be a
[1:05:18] trustworthy person that would have to
[1:05:21] come and and Jesus said it this way you
[1:05:23] know you've got to trust in Christ and
[1:05:26] and he had to get the people the hardest
[1:05:28] thing to do is to get a human being to
[1:05:30] believe another human being yeah do you
[1:05:32] know that right and Jesus had to get
[1:05:35] human beings to believe in him yeah who
[1:05:38] was a human being and yet he was God in
[1:05:39] flesh yes but he said let not your heart
[1:05:42] be troubled he said you believe in God
[1:05:45] believe also in me and the hardest thing
[1:05:48] that we do as Christians is to get human
[1:05:51] beings to believe us right yeah yeah
[1:05:54] right because we are not perfect right
[1:05:57] we made our mistakes right we've done
[1:06:00] our things that are wrong yeah and the
[1:06:02] hardest thing to do is to get human
[1:06:04] beings to say to say I believe what
[1:06:08] you're telling me all right I can see
[1:06:10] that you're a witness of it now brother
[1:06:13] brandom the angel told Brother brandom
[1:06:15] what did he said what did the angel say
[1:06:17] if you get the people to believe you yes
[1:06:20] and then be sincere when you pray
[1:06:23] nothing shall stand before the prayer so
[1:06:25] there were two parts to it he said if
[1:06:27] you can get the people to believe you
[1:06:29] then be sincere and we find that playing
[1:06:32] out and brother brandom types his
[1:06:33] ministry to eleazer Abraham's servant
[1:06:36] Abraham's trustworthy servant Genesis
[1:06:38] 24:2 that the Bible tells us that
[1:06:41] Abraham spoke to his eldest servant who
[1:06:44] ruled over all that he had and so he's
[1:06:46] telling us that that there's there's a a
[1:06:49] trusted servant there he didn't just
[1:06:51] come to the uh to one that just started
[1:06:54] Ed he didn't come to one that that that
[1:06:56] wasn't uh wasn't responsible but he come
[1:06:59] to one who was responsible his eldest
[1:07:01] servant ruled over all that he had and
[1:07:03] he said he said promise me this that
[1:07:06] you'll go get a wife for Isaac yes he
[1:07:09] needed a trustworthy servant brother
[1:07:11] bandam said it's a beautiful lesson of
[1:07:13] Abraham a type of God the Father hunting
[1:07:16] for a servant to go find a bride for his
[1:07:18] son he said that's what the father is
[1:07:21] doing today he looking over his group to
[1:07:23] see someone that he can put trust in
[1:07:27] that'll take the message that he sends
[1:07:29] to the bride someone he can put a try
[1:07:32] say God let that be me today let that be
[1:07:35] me because we know it's not just
[1:07:36] preachers but it's all of
[1:07:39] us God wants a trustworthy servant he
[1:07:42] said he said he decided that elzer was
[1:07:45] the selected one because he'd found
[1:07:47] elzer a trustworthy servant he' been
[1:07:49] loyal and true and upright and just and
[1:07:51] honest he said that's the kind of a Serv
[1:07:54] that God can pick to take a message from
[1:07:56] him to the church as one that's been
[1:07:58] proven to be just he said do you
[1:08:00] remember my sermon last time here on
[1:08:02] selecting for the placing of a son how
[1:08:04] he was proven first and then adopted in
[1:08:06] the family or placed positionally and
[1:08:08] elzar met the requirement that Abraham
[1:08:10] was requiring and Abraham represents the
[1:08:12] model
[1:08:13] servant he said you've read the story in
[1:08:16] Genesis 24 how he did not go out until
[1:08:18] he was sent that's important we go out
[1:08:20] when he sends us and we go where he
[1:08:22] sends us
[1:08:26] he said there's many goes out just for
[1:08:27] what money they can get out of it there
[1:08:29] others I tell you what if you're in it
[1:08:30] for the money you're in the wrong ball
[1:08:34] game a lot of other things I could do to
[1:08:37] make
[1:08:38] money these others he said goes to make
[1:08:40] a great name for themselves I say Amen
[1:08:42] to that as well if you if you're if you
[1:08:45] are going out to make a great name for
[1:08:47] yourself this is not the place to be
[1:08:49] right and the preaching the message of
[1:08:51] the hour others goes out to be popular
[1:08:53] others goes because some man-made regime
[1:08:56] sends them but there's some that'll wait
[1:08:59] until God sends them he said the model
[1:09:01] servant will do
[1:09:03] that
[1:09:05] amen he said notice when he went he only
[1:09:07] went where he was sent to not just come
[1:09:09] over here because there's more money or
[1:09:11] down here because there's bigger crowds
[1:09:13] he went exactly where he was sent to he
[1:09:15] said God's looking for men today that
[1:09:18] will move when the holy spirit moves
[1:09:20] anywhere that he may send he said that's
[1:09:22] a model servant yeah he said not only
[1:09:25] that but when he got to his place where
[1:09:26] his messages was to be given he never
[1:09:29] boasted on himself he never spoke about
[1:09:31] how great he was he said or how great
[1:09:33] his meetings was or how great anything
[1:09:35] about himself he wasn't a boaster or
[1:09:37] proud but he only spoke of his master of
[1:09:39] his master's wealth and that his master
[1:09:41] had a son that was going to fall air to
[1:09:43] everything the master had he said what a
[1:09:46] beautiful picture of a real servant of
[1:09:48] God his whole attention is on the master
[1:09:50] telling the people not about himself but
[1:09:53] about about the master all right about
[1:09:55] the son and he's going to fall heir to
[1:09:57] All Things yes oh don't you believe we
[1:10:00] had a messenger in this age like that
[1:10:02] aren't you glad when you were in Moab
[1:10:04] when you were in denomination that God
[1:10:05] sent a prophet in our day that would
[1:10:07] tell you about somebody else that that
[1:10:10] wanted to marry you he didn't tell you
[1:10:11] about himself he told you about the one
[1:10:13] who was coming and he pointed us to
[1:10:16] Christ the
[1:10:20] word he wasn't a boaster or proud but he
[1:10:23] told about one had a son who was going
[1:10:25] to fall air to everything the master had
[1:10:27] yeah he said what a beautiful picture of
[1:10:29] a real servant of God his whole
[1:10:31] attention is on the master telling the
[1:10:33] people not about himself but about The
[1:10:34] Master about the son he's going to fall
[1:10:36] air to all things he said he has so much
[1:10:38] time talking about the master and the
[1:10:40] son until he has no time to boast on
[1:10:42] himself or his great regime or his
[1:10:45] denomination or some affiliation that he
[1:10:47] has it's all on the master oh aren't you
[1:10:50] glad for aren't you glad that God still
[1:10:52] has servants today that it's all about
[1:10:54] the master it's all about him it's not

[1:14:41] God that we wouldn't we wouldn't allow
[1:14:43] anything to come between ourselves and
[1:14:45] being able to help somebody
[1:14:48] yeah the disciples found the same thing
[1:14:50] with the case of epilepsy yeah when they
[1:14:52] went down to deliver it and and they
[1:14:54] couldn't do it but brother brand said
[1:14:55] here come Jesus he said and the devil
[1:14:57] saw that life he said he wasn't scared
[1:14:59] of their shouting and and screaming and
[1:15:01] hollering and all that he said but he
[1:15:03] was scared of that life yeah the devil
[1:15:06] was scared of that life oh let me live
[1:15:08] that kind of Life today let me have that
[1:15:10] Life of Christ he told the disciples he
[1:15:13] said you need to be more sincere this
[1:15:15] kind can come forth by nothing but by
[1:15:17] prayer and fasting you can't be in it
[1:15:19] for the money Paul told Timothy the love
[1:15:21] of money is the root of all evil
[1:15:23] he said which while some coveted after
[1:15:26] they have aired from the faith and
[1:15:27] pierced themselves through with many
[1:15:29] Sorrows but thou oh man of God flee

[1:15:40] going to be a fight yes I had to fight
[1:15:43] to get up this morning fight to come to
[1:15:46] church fight to stand here and preach
[1:15:48] but it's worth the fight huh I hope
[1:15:51] you're with me this morning it's it's
[1:15:53] worth the fight to be in the house of
[1:15:54] God it's worth the fight to reach one
[1:15:56] last Soul it's worth the fight if we got
[1:15:58] to fight every day of our
[1:16:01] life I think of others who fought much
[1:16:03] more than I fought and they fought and
[1:16:06] they continued to fight until the day
[1:16:07] that they died why because it was worth
[1:16:09] the fight yes yes
[1:16:13] wonderful amen I believe that today

[1:16:18] on eternal life where to Thou Art also
[1:16:21] called and has professed a good
[1:16:22] profession before many witnesses he said
[1:16:24] that's the kind of servant that I want
[1:16:26] that's the one I want going to Moab to
[1:16:28] tell Naomi that there's a Revival
[1:16:31] there's a bride's Revival in
[1:16:34] Bethlehem messenger must have personal
[1:16:37] experience with that
[1:16:40] Revival in other words he been to
[1:16:44] Bethlehem he drank the
[1:16:46] water he ate the
[1:16:49] bread oh I've told ministers before I
[1:16:53] said I want you to
[1:16:55] study I want you to study I like to see
[1:16:57] a man that's study before he gets in the
[1:16:59] Pulpit don't you you want to see
[1:17:01] somebody who's got something to say but
[1:17:03] most of all I want you to pray because
[1:17:06] if you're not if if you're not prayed
[1:17:07] through if you don't have personal
[1:17:09] experience then you're never going to
[1:17:11] you're never going to have anything that
[1:17:12] the people will believe there there's
[1:17:15] nothing that that that that will connect
[1:17:16] you to your message there's got to be
[1:17:18] something there that's connected to the
[1:17:20] message you got to drink the water yes
[1:17:23] if you're going to tell about Bethlehem
[1:17:24] you got to drink Pentecostal water
[1:17:26] sometimes all right right if you're
[1:17:28] going to tell people about Bethlehem you
[1:17:30] got to eat the bread of life you got to
[1:17:33] spend your time in the word so you got
[1:17:36] to have that experience with God it it
[1:17:38] was elaser that Abraham promised him he
[1:17:42] said when you go he said my angel he
[1:17:44] shall send his Angel before thee in
[1:17:46] Genesis 247 he said he shall send his
[1:17:48] Angel before thee and thou shalt take a
[1:17:51] wife unto my son from then but the B
[1:17:53] said El eer had the assurance that the
[1:17:55] angel was going before him then he could
[1:17:57] decide to go because he had something to
[1:17:59] back him up he said I think that ought
[1:18:01] to be the Assurance of every man of God
[1:18:03] that preaches the gospel that he's got
[1:18:05] something positive from God that'll back
[1:18:07] up what he preaches I trust that we have
[1:18:10] something positive today he said if you
[1:18:13] haven't got it Brethren it's for you he
[1:18:15] said God still sends his men with an
[1:18:16] angel before him when he goes to take
[1:18:18] the message to the church
[1:18:20] yes now
[1:18:23] Mary knew when she it's Christmas time
[1:18:26] and Mary knew that the baby that she
[1:18:28] carried was of the Holy Ghost why
[1:18:31] because she said he overshadowed me he
[1:18:34] has overshadowed her she knew whose it
[1:18:37] was and brother BR said so is every
[1:18:39] believer that accepts God's word into
[1:18:41] their heart he said I don't care what
[1:18:43] the systems say you know what it is it's
[1:18:46] a promise of God it was revealed to you
[1:18:47] by the Holy Ghost when you were
[1:18:49] overshadowed with his power you know
[1:18:51] where it's at he he said no man has a
[1:18:53] right to preach the gospel until he's
[1:18:56] met God back on the backside of the
[1:18:57] desert in that burning bush where
[1:18:59] there's no ecclesiastical system in the
[1:19:02] world can explain it away from you you
[1:19:05] got to have a backbone about you you got
[1:19:06] to have something when everything else
[1:19:08] fails that you're willing to do what God
[1:19:10] says you got to have something that
[1:19:12] you're willing to preach through
[1:19:13] difficulty you got to have something
[1:19:15] you're willing to testify through
[1:19:16] difficulty if you're going to be a
[1:19:17] Christian in this day and age you got to
[1:19:19] have something that you're willing to
[1:19:21] fight through and something that you're
[1:19:23] willing to grab a hold
[1:19:25] of the Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:19:27] suffers violence and the violent take it
[1:19:29] by force what it means is that you got
[1:19:31] to be willing to grab a hold of the
[1:19:33] promises of God you got to be willing to
[1:19:35] to say make it yay and amen in my life I
[1:19:38] can't just sit here like the like the
[1:19:40] three men did the three lepers at the
[1:19:42] Gate of Samaria they said why sit we
[1:19:44] here till we die Let's cross on over to
[1:19:46] the enemy camp let's go over and we're
[1:19:49] not going to the enemy camp we're going
[1:19:51] into the full Promises of God
[1:19:54] you got to have something that no man
[1:19:55] can explain away from you you're a
[1:19:57] witness to it in Luke 24 49 Jesus told
[1:20:01] the disciples he said ter in the city of
[1:20:03] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[1:20:05] from on high you need to taste the bread
[1:20:08] you need to drink the water before you
[1:20:11] go out and start telling people about it
[1:20:13] all
[1:20:14] right not only that but you got to be
[1:20:16] faithful to tell the story
[1:20:19] yes you believe that today yes the
[1:20:22] messenger has to be faithful to tell the
[1:20:25] story how shall they hear without a
[1:20:28] preacher I've told you it's my
[1:20:30] responsibility to stand here on Sunday

[1:21:11] that story you go to church when the
[1:21:13] doors are open all right you're telling
[1:21:14] a story yeah years ago I realized that
[1:21:17] my phone knows I go to
[1:21:19] church cuz it tells me how far it is to
[1:21:22] church church every time at church if
[1:21:24] we're ever on vacation or something

[1:21:31] the house of God oh my there ought to be
[1:21:34] something in our lives so we know oh
[1:21:36] it's not just another Sunday morning but
[1:21:38] I'm going to take my place with the
[1:21:39] Lord's despise few I'm going to do what
[1:21:42] God
[1:21:43] says all right amen you you've got to be
[1:21:47] certain and and and to be a faithful
[1:21:50] messenger of the bride's Revival you got
[1:21:53] to know there is a Revival yeah and
[1:21:55] you've got to be willing to preach the
[1:21:58] promise of that Revival yeah are you
[1:22:01] with me so far he said not only that but
[1:22:04] when elzar left the father of Isaac
[1:22:06] which represented the father of Christ
[1:22:08] he loaded the whole train of camels with
[1:22:10] good gifts for the bride so he did not
[1:22:12] just tell her about it but he showed her
[1:22:15] about it he showed her what the father
[1:22:18] had for her all right he said oh I feel
[1:22:22] religious right now he said oh how I
[1:22:24] love Jesus he loaded the camels full of
[1:22:26] good gifts to give to the bride and he
[1:22:28] never told her they were for another
[1:22:29] generation or another day but they were
[1:22:31] for the bride do you believe that today
[1:22:33] he never told her they were for another
[1:22:35] generation or for another day but they
[1:22:36] were for the bride and every truth
[1:22:38] servant of God that's sent out here has
[1:22:40] got a whole book full of divine promises
[1:22:42] that he can offer to the bride he said
[1:22:45] I'm so glad of that he's got gifts in
[1:22:46] there for her and he will not hold any
[1:22:48] of them back he will give every one of
[1:22:51] them freely do you believe that today a
[1:22:54] true servant a model servant a servant
[1:22:56] that God can put trust in he won't try
[1:22:58] to hide it back from her because he
[1:23:00] knows she is the oncoming Queen Oh my he
[1:23:04] knows who he's preaching to yeah
[1:23:06] wonderful he said oh there's no good
[1:23:08] thing withheld from them That'll Walk
[1:23:10] UPR right before him do you believe that
[1:23:11] today whatever you have need of this
[1:23:13] morning there's no good thing withheld
[1:23:15] from them who walk upright before him
[1:23:18] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:23:19] pray believe you receive them and you
[1:23:21] shall have them if you abide in me and
[1:23:23] my word in you ask what you will it
[1:23:25] shall be given unto you he said the
[1:23:26] book's full of it and every promise in
[1:23:29] the book is yours you the bride do you
[1:23:32] believe that today that ought to
[1:23:33] encourage us this
[1:23:35] morning to preach the bride's Revival a
[1:23:39] faithful messenger must have recognized
[1:23:41] The Awakening of the Bride brother the
[1:23:44] Bram said it would take those seven
[1:23:45] unknown Thunders to wake her up again
[1:23:47] but he said he'll send it he promised it
[1:23:49] he talks about how she was dead if the
[1:23:51] churches would forget their Creeds and
[1:23:53] forget their dogmas just take the Bible
[1:23:55] plead the promise it would come
[1:23:56] effective to them he said but you see
[1:23:58] Jesus said you with your Traditions make
[1:24:00] the word of God not effective to you he
[1:24:03] said well that's the same thing today
[1:24:04] with spiritual Eve the spiritual bride
[1:24:06] of today he said the church she takes
[1:24:08] the word of God and she won't accept it
[1:24:11] she accepts dogmas instead therefore the
[1:24:13] word is not effective to her because she
[1:24:15] tries to inject her Creed with the word
[1:24:17] and it won't work so he said she's dead
[1:24:19] we could say she's in a famine but
[1:24:21] there's a reason why she's in a famine
[1:24:23] there's a reason why she's dead she
[1:24:25] accepts dogmas instead of the word so if
[1:24:28] she would accept the word instead of
[1:24:30] Dogma what's going to happen Revival's
[1:24:33] on again yeah are you with me now he
[1:24:36] said I just keep reading this here heral
[1:24:38] of his coming across the headlines we
[1:24:40] need a prophet to return we need a
[1:24:41] prophet to return He said I guess when
[1:24:43] he does return they'll know nothing
[1:24:44] about it all
[1:24:45] right one year later he said this in
[1:24:48] 1964 he said everywhere now there's no
[1:24:50] Revival everybody's complaining
[1:24:52] ministers crying he said I was reading
[1:24:54] one of the outstanding papers that comes
[1:24:55] to the church a very fine paper I know
[1:24:57] the editor I know the people brother and
[1:24:59] sister Moore The Herald of his coming he
[1:25:01] said one of the finest papers on the
[1:25:02] field he said but they hardly will print
[1:25:04] anything unless it's about fast pre fast
[1:25:06] prey sound a trumpet he said how many
[1:25:09] reads that you know he said you see it
[1:25:10] all the time fast pray it's all you hear
[1:25:12] we're going to have a great breaking of
[1:25:13] the day there's a great thing going to
[1:25:14] happen all if you pray we're not too
[1:25:16] late yet why did they do that he said
[1:25:19] they want a Great Awakening they're
[1:25:20] crying believing that there will be an
[1:25:21] awaken in they're good people what why
[1:25:24] is it what have they done he said
[1:25:25] they've not recognized The Awakening of
[1:25:27] the bride all right they missed it so a
[1:25:30] faithful messenger has to have not
[1:25:32] missed the return of bread to Bethlehem
[1:25:35] yeah they have to be able to recognize
[1:25:37] you can't preach this message unless
[1:25:39] you've recognized there's bread back in
[1:25:41] Bethlehem that the Revival's on that the
[1:25:44] word has been revealed yeah he said
[1:25:46] they're believing they're crying there
[1:25:47] will be an Awakening they're good people
[1:25:49] by being a Christian they fill the pull
[1:25:51] of the hour but they have haven't
[1:25:52] recognized what's been done yes and so
[1:25:55] many people today that's what the
[1:25:56] problem is that's why they're trying to
[1:25:57] go back and say well we just go back and
[1:25:59] not have preachers anymore we just sit
[1:26:01] and and and do our thing and go through
[1:26:03] the form of it don't you realize what
[1:26:05] they're doing they did not recognize the
[1:26:07] Awakening of the
[1:26:09] Bride they can't recognize a bride
[1:26:11] Revival right in front of them yes
[1:26:13] because brother BR said be so simple why
[1:26:16] because it's in human beings yes that's
[1:26:18] right but a faithful messenger's got to
[1:26:20] be able to stay stand and
[1:26:23] I am the bride's
[1:26:25] Revival that's what the man said when
[1:26:27] they were looking for the Welch Revival
[1:26:29] those men rode across the sea and and
[1:26:31] they get off the boat and and in Wales
[1:26:34] and and there's a little policeman
[1:26:36] standing there swinging his billy club
[1:26:37] and they come over to him and said could
[1:26:39] you direct us to the bride or to the
[1:26:41] Welsh Revival and he said I am the Welsh
[1:26:45] Revival yeah you found it amen oh I
[1:26:48] believe every one of us ought to be able
[1:26:50] to say that today but if Naomi was
[1:26:52] hungry if Naomi was thirsty If she' lost
[1:26:55] everything that she had and she found
[1:26:57] herself down in Moab in a denomination
[1:26:59] somewhere that she could say I I
[1:27:02] understand that there's something going
[1:27:03] on cuz I see it in your life I see that
[1:27:06] you're a faithful messenger of the
[1:27:08] bride's
[1:27:11] Revival brother brandom tells us I'm
[1:27:13] closing in just a
[1:27:17] moment brother brandham tells us about
[1:27:19] two Cals in the springtime he said one
[1:27:23] of them had a great big fancy Barn all
[1:27:25] right he said that they had gold handles
[1:27:27] on the doors that that's a fancy Barn
[1:27:31] right
[1:27:32] there ours didn't have no doors just
[1:27:35] rolled something in front of it they had
[1:27:37] a fancy Barn gold handles on the doors
[1:27:40] and and uh everything was just perfect
[1:27:42] all laid out but they didn't feed the
[1:27:44] poor thing just just fed him scraps and
[1:27:48] so this this one was raised all winter
[1:27:49] he was kept up in the barn he just eaten
[1:27:51] yesterday Mana you know just just kind
[1:27:54] of just kind of didn't care what they
[1:27:55] fed him but there was another Old Barn
[1:27:57] said had holes in it and and and had all
[1:27:59] kinds of problem didn't look very good
[1:28:01] he said but on the inside it was full of
[1:28:03] hay yeah and on the inside he was eating
[1:28:05] this alphaalpha Hay all winter long he'd
[1:28:08] been eating he said come springtime the
[1:28:10] air begin to warm up and and and the
[1:28:13] birds begin to chirp again and he said
[1:28:15] they let these two calvs out here come
[1:28:16] the one calf out of the fancy Barn he
[1:28:18] can just barely move all right said he
[1:28:21] just got he I don't hardly have any
[1:28:23] ability at all so well I'm a little bit
[1:28:25] a little bit tired today I don't think
[1:28:26] I'll be able to make it to the house of
[1:28:28] God I just just you've been like that
[1:28:31] right all right come on come on we all
[1:28:34] have at some point or another depends on
[1:28:36] what we're feeding on yeah all right
[1:28:39] well I I just don't know if I can
[1:28:40] believe the promise or not said just
[1:28:41] kind of stumbling around the light
[1:28:43] blinds him you know he said but here
[1:28:45] come the other calf out of the old barn
[1:28:48] oh I like the good old way don't you he
[1:28:50] come out of the old barn he said but
[1:28:51] he'd been fed all winter said he was
[1:28:53] just as fat as could be and he'd come
[1:28:55] running out there jumping you ever seen
[1:28:56] a calf in the spring how they'll jump
[1:28:58] and rejoice why did they do that because
[1:29:00] they've been well fed they've been taken
[1:29:02] care of amen and so when he got out
[1:29:04] there in the green grass he could just
[1:29:05] enjoy the presence of God I believe
[1:29:07] that's the way we ought to be today
[1:29:09] that's the way we ought to be in the
[1:29:10] house of God we ought to be able to kick
[1:29:11] up our heels and jump and and be excited
[1:29:14] about the things of God why we've been
[1:29:15] well fed on the inside we found a seven
[1:29:18] course meal of God's word we've been fed
[1:29:21] the word of God we ought to be able to
[1:29:23] Rejoice like nobody else we ought to be
[1:29:25] able to worship like nobody else we
[1:29:27] ought to be faithful
[1:29:28] Messengers The wellfed Calf was a
[1:29:30] faithful messenger of the bride's

[1:30:06] gave
[1:30:07] her you know the Bible says that and her
[1:30:09] brother came to see and when he came to
[1:30:12] see the Bible says he saw that she had
[1:30:14] on what the prophet or what elzer gave
[1:30:17] her if the prophet was the model servant
[1:30:20] and he gives certain things to the bride

[1:30:35] about what he's saying and the Bible
[1:30:36] said he invited the messenger back to
