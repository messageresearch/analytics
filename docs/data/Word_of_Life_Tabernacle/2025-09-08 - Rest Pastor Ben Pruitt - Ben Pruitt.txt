And he has given me a song. Oh, he has. Yes, he has. He has given me a mey and song. Oh, he has. Yes, he has. [Applause] [Music] So many times I felt someone was watching over me. For there was too much on display. Like the day we went driving and my life was changed forever. The flames nearly took me that day. I could feel my heart racing as the grave of smoke and fire would seal my doom and claim another life. Like a hand from out of nowhere, I was lifted toward the sunlight. And with one breath, I knew that I survived. [Music] And now I know my keeper. I call him by his name. He's brought me through much danger. Spared me so much pain. He knew someday I'd see him. He was never far away. And now I know my keeper. I talk to him each day. I faced another fire. This one oh so vast. Millions there were helpless burning from their past. Satan thought that he would claim my sinful soul one day. But all in once a nail scored hand reached down and I was saved. Now I know my keeper. I call him by his name. He's brought me through much danger. cared through so much pain. He knew someday I'd see him. He was never far away. Now I know my keeper. I talk to him each day. And now I know my keeper. I call him by his name. He's brought me through much danger. Spared me so much pain. He knew someday I'd see him. He was never far away. And now I know my keeper. I talk to him each day. [Music] Now I know my keeper. I talked to him and Jesus is his name. How many enjoyed our specials here tonight? Let's stand. Can I add one in? Add one in. I'm free. Praise the Lord. I'm free.

From getting your blessing here tonight. But you know, you might as well just get what you came for because there's nothing else more important. Amen. What did he what did he talk about this morning? Being in the presence of God wasn't just anything in the presence, but you you were predestinated to be in the presence. You were elected to be here in the presence of the Lord. Amen.

I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. Let's sing this one here as we invite our pastor. Are you ready for the word of the Lord tonight? Amen. I believe that you're under expectation and you're going to get what you came for this evening. Amen. Let's just put aside everything that would try to hinder us tonight. Every every thought, every little besetting sin, anything that would come in and try to keep you from your blessing, don't let it stop you here tonight. Let's just open our hearts and receive from the Lord. How about that? Tonight, somebody say amen. Give the Lord another hand clap of praise. And I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? and thanks for that special night when I saw your glorious life. Came face to face with eternal life. Oh Lord, I thank thee. You didn't have to open my eyes. You could have easily passed me by. For the age I was living in was rich and poor and blind. And then I heard recognizing your name. Serpent sin and perfect faith. The bridge and the message of grace. And Lord I thank thee. We thank him now. And I just want to thank you, Lord, for letting me hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? And thanks for that special life. When I saw your glorious light, came face to face with eternal life. Oh Lord, I thank thee. I like this verse. God, even in my wildest dreams, did I think I'd see such things as the coming of the Lord, the rapture mystery. Well, I have heard, but now I see God in simplicity. The spoken word is the original seed. And Lord, we all thank thee with all your hearts now. And I just want to thank you for hear your word. What have I done to deserve such glory revealed in me? And thanks for special life. When I saw glory came face to face with eternal life, Lord, I thank thee. Let's give him a hand of praise. Aren't you grateful? Aren't you grateful that you heard those things? Amen. We heard his word. Let's bow our heads together. It's good to be with you tonight and good to have our visitors tonight. Let's just offer a prayer to the Lord and just believe whatever we have need of tonight, he'll give that to us. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so grateful to be in your presence once again. And Lord, we're so thankful that we've heard your word, Lord, that we could find a place of rest, oh God. Lord, our wandering soul would find a place that we can anchor in, Lord, and find a haven of rest. So thankful for that, Father. I pray that you'd bless your word tonight. Speak to us, Lord. Move me out of the way, Lord. I know you've done it before. I believe you can do it again. Pray that you'd move and speak to these people. I pray you'd heal the sick. Touch those that are in need. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Mark chapter 6. Mark chapter 6 and verse 30. Verses 30 and 31. Kind of a different uh text uh tonight. uh Mark 6:30 and 31. I want to speak to you on rest. Maybe a little bit of a dangerous subject on a Sunday afternoon, but I've approached this before, but maybe just approach it in a little bit different way tonight. And I know I've we've talked about the subject of rest, but maybe take it a little bit differently tonight. Mark 6, chapter chapter 6, verse 30. The apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught. You remember he had sent them out and and told him, "Go heal the sick and cleanse the leper." And they had done all of that. And he said unto them, "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure as much to eat. Pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. Rest in the original is to give intermission from labor to give rest or to refresh. To refresh as we talked about this morning, how that it's in the quiet. Brother Rand said that's how we get our refreshing is by getting that alone time with God. Refreshing rest. There is no human being physically including Jesus himself who was as human as we are who does not need rest. There was a a a great theologian by the name of Philip Meanthan. He was a reformation theologian with Martin Luther and he come to Luther's house one day and he said today he said we're going to talk and discuss the governance of the universe and Luther uh spoke back to him and I guess he he'd done his done some work and he was tired and he said today he said you and I are going fishing and he said we'll leave the governance of the universe to God and you know there's time and a place for everything, right? The the philosopher Essop supposedly he had a someone come to him and criticize him because they saw him playing a children's game and they said, "There's so many more important things to do." And he said, "I want you to take your bow that you use, the old style of bow they would use for war and for hunting." He said, "I want you to take your bow," he said, "and unstring it." And uh and so he unrung the bow and he says, "What does that teach you? What does the unstrung bow teach you? He said if you leave it strung, it will eventually break the bow. It will actually destroy the bow if you leave it strung long enough. He said at some point the bow has to be unstrung to be continue to be useful. And so that's what rest is. You can't remain under tension all the time or you end up not being useful. Can I get an amen tonight? Boy, I thought you'd all be jumping the aisles by now. you know, talking about rest and and and and this is a something that God has given us an ability to rejuvenate, to refresh ourselves from the things that we do even in the physical. Uh we find Elijah needed a place of rest. In first Kings chapter 19 and verse 4, he was running from the word of a woman and he had just been through a great meeting. But brother Brandham talked about how that these prophets when they come out from under the anointing were uh would come under almost what we would call a depression and they begin to uh uh begin to uh begin to feel very down and and Elijah went through that. He ran from from Jezebel and he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die. He He may not have been suicidal, but he was close to it. &gt;&gt; And and he said, "It's enough now, oh Lord. Take away my life, for I am not better than my father's." And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, an angel touched him. I'm so glad God still got those angels today that can still touch us. I believe they're here tonight. Brother Brandon said, "If you could see beyond the veil of the flesh, you'd see angels at their position at every pew." I pray we can see that tonight. I pray we could we could enter into that realm where we could feel the presence of the angels that are here to help us. And and so he he said he the angel touched him and said, "Arise and eat." And he looked and behold there was a cake baking on the coals and a crews of water in his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again. And you know it looked like Elijah needed a rebuke, &gt;&gt; right? It really did. Like it looked like this prophet needed a a a little kick. you know, and just angel needed to come down, give him a rebuke. But that's not what God gave him. He g send him an angel down to talk to him and give him something to eat and drink and laid him down again. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said, "Arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee." And he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights and Horeb the mount of God. Brother Brandon said he sent an angel and the angel touched him and he went to sleep. And when he woke up, there was some corn cakes or some kind of cakes baked laying by the side of him. He said, "Elijah, rise up and eat." He said, "There's the grace of God to his servant." See, he's resting him. He's resting him. So rest is more. Even in physical rest, it's more than just laying down. Because there's lots of times you can lay down and not rest. And you might take time off work but not rest. You might go on vacation but not rest. But God said, "I'm going to send my angels down so that Elijah can rest." And he said, "You know, Jesus said, "Come aside into the wilderness and let's rest a little while." Some of these guys that think you don't have to have rest, he said, "We find out they burn out pretty quick, too." &gt;&gt; He said, "If they don't take rest, they find themselves wrecked up somewhere." He said, "I think that's where our brother Billy Graham is tonight, trying to overshoot the mark. These human bodies are strong, but they need rest. There was a time Billy Graham had to come off the field for a while because he was just wore out. And brother Brand was speaking about that. He said, "Then he said, then you can take a little rest and go somewhere and they'll criticize you and say, I I thought he was a preacher. Look at him out yonder on the bank fishing or something like that." He said, "But that doesn't matter. Jehovah will take care of his own. I'm thankful for that." And while he was laying there under the tree, wearied and upset, God quietened his nerves, he fed him. He woke him up again and fed him again and put him back to sleep. Brother Brandon in another place said, "The angel with the softest hands went down where Elijah was just to wipe his brow and touch him so that he so that it wouldn't disturb him while he slept." I believe God still cares that much about you, brother Wes. I believe he still cares enough to give us rest tonight even when we need it in the natural. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and he said, you know, he said, I've often wondered what was in those cakes. What kind of vitamin did he get in those cakes? He said, however, whatever there was in there, it lasted him 40 days and 40 nights. He went in the strength of those cakes. He said, God knows tonight. He said, I need some of them. I'm sure this church needs some of them. I'm going to say, I can use some of them cakes tonight. Use some of them vitamins. He said, "God knows this church needs some of them." He said, "Come aside from the world. Let's rest a while. Let's talk a while." He said, "You you don't have time to rest." You say, John Wesley said that one time. He said, "I'm afraid to rest. I ain't got time to rest." He said, "You find yourself broke up if you don't take these rests." &gt;&gt; Again, brother Brandham talking about his own ministry. He said, "Remember friends, I've been constantly in the field since Christmas. just constantly going till I'm really tired, really tired this afternoon. It'll be quite a while before I got some get some rest. He said, "I got a few days coming. I'm going right out now for three or four days rest." But anyone knows, now I I'll just be honest with you. I didn't know this, but Brother Brandon said, "Anyone knows that you can't rest in three or four days." &gt;&gt; He said, "You got to take a complete rest &gt;&gt; and build up again." &gt;&gt; And I'm going somewhere with this, so just hang with me. I know everybody's like, "Brother Ben, what are you promoting?" Well, I'm about to take some time off, but it's cuz I'm having teeth cut out, not cuz I'm resting. But but he said again, he said this. He said, "Now, this is my vacation time. As you know, I've preached since December, January, February, March, April, May, June, and July." He said, "Enough, God willing, and I need special call. This is the season I take my rest, my vacation. I go hunting." Can you imagine? You know, I heard a I heard a story here recently about a a youth group that went and and they uh went and had a Nerf battle in a vacant home and and uh somebody owned the home. They weren't in just break into somebody's home, but they were in someone's home in the church and they had a Nerf gun battle and they got so much criticism over that. And I I thought, you know, I don't think we ought to criticize people for doing things like that. You know, I I think we I think we need to understand I think we need to understand that sometimes people need an outlet. They need they need a rest. They need a break. And not everything we do, you know, that helps us spiritually is spiritual in itself. I'll say this, if you ate a good meal and and had a a good diet this week and exercised and did, it'll make you feel better in church. &gt;&gt; And when you feel better in church, you amen better. you you when you're better in your health, you're a you're better in your spiritual life. I know there's people feel like we got to be a bunch of Catholics and and and crawl over cobblestones and hurt ourselves in some way to be message believers, but brother Brandham didn't teach that at all. &gt;&gt; Right? We don't have to listen. I can't do a thing to buy my salvation. He already paid for my my my way. He already made a way for me. I my sins were judged in his body on the cross. I can't be judged for sin. and I want to do everything I can for him, but when I need rest, he's provided a way to to have rest. &gt;&gt; All right? So, he said, he said, "That'll be his will." He said, "If there's no certain call," he said, "If the Lord should call me to do something else, them things are out of the picture." So, we do have a responsibilities. But he said, "God is always first. I want him to be first. You want him to be first. But then, if there's no certain call, and that be his will, that's what I'm to do now for the next couple of months is to go hunting to rest myself." You all know I'm not doing that. So, just I'd be lost as a goose. So, I'd have to go with some of you and that wouldn't be very restful for you. He said, uh, he said, "I'm going hunting to rest myself." He said, "You don't realize the world will never know what I have to go through with." See, and it's just such a strain. No wonder the Lord told his disciples when he was walking with them, "Come apart into the desert. Rest a while." He said, "I realize it more every day." And especially as my days get more upon the earth. You see, as I get older, you realize it. You hear our pastor saying amen to that, too. Said, "We can realize we're not boys after we pass 50." So, I guess I still am a boy in that in by that definition. He says, "We're not boys after we pass 50 years old." He said, "Now, we got to have a little time." &gt;&gt; Got to have a little time. Brother Brandon still preached 75 sermons that year. That's a lot. And in 1965, he preached 50. And you'll find as he got older, he preached less. But I'm glad he took the time &gt;&gt; to preach marriage and divorce, &gt;&gt; right? A man running from the presence of the Lord. Seed is not air with the shuck. I'm glad he took the time to do it. And if he hadn't have taken the time off, he wouldn't have been able to preach like he preached. Are you with me now? I'm not just talking about preachers. I'm talking about all of us, right? We need to make sure that we're ready when we come to the house of God. Let's come ready. Let's come rested up and ready to not just be a throw it away, but that that the service could be what God wanted it to be because you don't know who might show up that might need a blessing, might need might need to be born again, might need to be changed in the presence of God and and the difference may be you being ready for the service may be the difference in them in life or death for them. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, help me to be ready." So, uh, you know, and I I I've got a special place in my heart for pastors because that's what I do. It's all I've ever wanted to do and in my life and just pastor a church. I don't want to never wanted a big church. I' I I've got we've got more than I can handle now. And we got this great responsibility with these children and things and and I I don't want any more than that. And yet God has given us a great responsibility. I've I've preached since I've been here over 500 sermons. I've never used the same set of notes twice. I'm not just telling you that. But pastors, I think some of y'all go to brother Jason's, you ought to thank God for your pastor and and treat him right. Because a pastor goes through things that people don't understand. And we don't understand what a prophet went through. &gt;&gt; Right. Just as much as a regular person may not understand what a pastor goes through, we do not understand what a prophet went through &gt;&gt; because I'm not a prophet. Someone say amen to that. I don't fight those spiritual battles like he did. He said, "I wasn't called to kiss babies." He said, "I was called to to carry a sword." &gt;&gt; Right? And and yet we do fight spiritual battles, but not like he did. But I'm not built for that either. God didn't call me to do that. And but God did call me to do something. And Jesus when he looked at his disciples, he didn't say, "Now I need to rest. So I'm going to go away for a while." But he said, "You need to rest." Right? He He didn't say, "I need to rest." He said, "You need to rest." Cuz he knew that they would not be ready. And there was something coming for them. &gt;&gt; There was a time coming they needed to be awake. &gt;&gt; There was a time coming they needed to be on fire. And so he wanted them to rest while they had the opportunity so that they could be on fire when the time come. Look, he recognized their human limitations because he was every bit as human as they were. Yeah, &gt;&gt; he grew weary. He felt pain. In Hebrews 4:15, it says, "We have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points." Someone say, "All." He was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. He did not sin when he rested. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He did not sin. I know there's people think, well, you got to be out there 100 100% 100 hours a day if there was 100 hours in a day. But Jesus did not sin when he rested. Some of us need to get that revelation. &gt;&gt; I know there's brothers that feel like they got to be working all the time. I believe in working. If a man doesn't work, the Bible said he shouldn't eat. &gt;&gt; Right? If he's able-bodied and able to work, he ought to have a job and work. &gt;&gt; If that job's washing dishes or or doing something, working at McDonald's, he ought to work somewhere if he's able-bodied. And yet, there's men that can't that are disabled and unable to work. And I thank God that that we have the ability to help people like that and that government helps them and things like that. I thank God for that. But yet if you're able to work, you need to work. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are you with me tonight? But you know you here uh you know there's a time when you got to recognize you've reached your limit, &gt;&gt; right? And you need to be present with your family. &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that they're not always going to come to you and ask you for advice. &gt;&gt; So if you blow them off right now, what about later? &gt;&gt; Right? When they were when you want them to come, wish he would ask me about that situation he's in and then you don't have any power to have him come to you. But while they are coming, while they are asking questions, I'm preaching to myself, too. Let's not just run them off. Let's let's take time for them. We can't do that if we're just constantly working. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; Right now look again. I believe in working, but we got to rest too. Brother Brandon said Jesus was tempted like the Bible said he was tempted at all points like we are. Brother Brandon said he was tempted by drinking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by women. &gt;&gt; I know we don't want to think about Jesus like that, but he was every bit as much human as we are. Come on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There was a difference. He never gave in. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He always overcame. &gt;&gt; We over We We give in sometimes, don't we? &gt;&gt; There's times we don't overcome. But Jesus never gave in. &gt;&gt; He was tempted by everything that we are. He was a man. Oh, it makes me feel better. It really does. There's something about that when we recognize that. Recognize Jesus knows what you're going through. He was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him. The Bible said he did no sin. Amen. Now I want you to contrast this what Jesus said come aside and rest with Luke chapter 9. Luke chapter 9 Jesus is fanatical when it comes to following the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He he he's actually fanatical about it. Luke chapter 9 verse 57. It come to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said to him, "Lord, I will follow thee whethersoever thou goest." was verse 58. And Jesus said unto him, "Foxes have holes. Birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." He said, "I don't even have a home." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse 59, he said unto another, "Follow me." But he said, "Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father." That seems like a reasonable request. And Jesus said, "You're not going to work out." That was his job interview. And the guy says, "Before I can go to work, Lord, before I can follow you, let me let me go bury my father." And Jesus said, "Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." That's almost brutal. &gt;&gt; Verse 61. Another also said, "Lord, I will follow thee, but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house." And Jesus said to him, "No man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God." &gt;&gt; Right? Now, how can we reconcile that with someone said, "Let's go take a a vacation. Let's get away from the people for a while." That's what he told him. Now, remember, the people followed him and he ended up having to feed them. But thank God, we serve a God who can feed 5,000 with two loaves. And are you with me now? With five loaves and two fishes. But, but they don't seem like the same person. But you realize there's an appropriate time for everything. And when we have opportunity to serve in the kingdom of God, we ought to give it everything that we've got. Don't leave nothing back. Just just lay ourselves out for the kingdom of God. Press into the kingdom. Do everything we can while we have opportunity. Let's do it. We don't know how many services we we'll have. I Well, you say, "Brother Ben, it's it's Sunday afternoon or it's a Wednesday night or whenever it is." That's no excuse to not give everything to God. &gt;&gt; Let the dead bury their dead. Let's go have church. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But there's a time, an appropriate time for rest. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And so Jesus is teaching us that there's a time we need to give everything we've got while we're preaching. We ought to give everything we've got to our preaching. When we sing, we ought to give it everything we've got. We should not do anything half-hearted in the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And yet when when the appropriate time comes, we need to rest. We need to rest because there's coming a time we need to be rested so that we can stay awake, &gt;&gt; right? That's why we need to take our nap before church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Rest so that at the appropriate time &gt;&gt; you can stay awake. &gt;&gt; Jonah didn't make it. He wanted to sit up front, but he didn't make it. But now look, this same group of disciples come with Jesus to the garden of Gethsemane. And he knows they won't all stay awake. &gt;&gt; And that's all he wanted from them. He didn't ask them to intervene in any way. He just said, "Stay awake for me." &gt;&gt; Watch with me. &gt;&gt; It was a time they needed to be awake. &gt;&gt; Wasn't time to rest. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? But because they hadn't learned how to rest, they were sleepy at the wrong time. Remember what they'd been doing? They'd been arguing with each other &gt;&gt; over who was the greatest. &gt;&gt; And they got wore out. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. Fussing among preachers, among churches, who was the best. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Who had the greatest church? &gt;&gt; It's not even worth our effort. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Not even worth the effort. we might as well. That it's just a waste of time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; One trying to one up another. And they that's what they were doing. They were fussing over who got this seat in the kingdom and who got that one. And all the time Jesus had his face set toward Calvary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "You need to rest up so you'll be ready." And they didn't do it. At the Garden of Gethsemane, all he wanted was for them to stay awake. The Bible says Mark 14:35, he took Peter, James, and John and brought them a little bit closer than he did the others. And he went forward a little. Another place said he went a little further. I'm glad he went further than we could. He went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, "Aba, Father, all things are possible unto thee. Take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he cometh and findeth them sleeping and sith unto Peter, Simon, this is no time for a nap. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. People are wore out, stressed out. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can't listen in church. I'm preaching to all of us now. &gt;&gt; And it's not the time, &gt;&gt; right? To be resting. The time to rest is when we can get away from everything. Take the opportunity to get away and get along with God and things like that. There is a time for rest. But now he said it's the time to be awake. He said he he said, "Are you sleeping?" He said, "Could us not thou watch one hour? Watch ye and pray lest you enter into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is weak." &gt;&gt; Again, he went away and prayed and spake the same words. When he returned, he found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy. You ever been in a service where your eyes were heavy &gt;&gt; and it didn't matter how much the preacher shouted and screamed and run the aisles and spit and hollered and whatever your eyes get heavy and you get to the place where you you're almost in that position right now and you're just propping them open with toothpicks. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's the way the disciples were. Their eyes were heavy. &gt;&gt; You needed to rest &gt;&gt; when you had time to rest. And now their eyes were heavy. Neither whisked they what to answer him. They had no excuses. Lord, we're just tired. &gt;&gt; Said, "Don't you realize this is the greatest moment of the universe?" &gt;&gt; I'm about to pay for all of your sins. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Could you not watch with me for one hour? &gt;&gt; But that's the weakness of human flesh, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Said the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. But I'm so glad that when my flesh is weak and I don't do all that I should do, he takes up the gap and he goes a little further and he stays awake when I don't and he's and he's ready when I'm not. &gt;&gt; So grateful for that. &gt;&gt; It didn't stop him from doing what God called him to do. But it would have been nice if they could have stayed awake. He cometh the third time and saith unto them, "Sleep on." Now third time he comes, he don't even wake them up. He said, "Just keep sleeping. It's enough. Take your rest. It's enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rest when it is appropriate, so that when you need to be awake, you can be awake. Some of you out there saying, "Brother Ben, this has nothing to do with me." You might be surprised. There was two wood choppers one time had a wood chopping contest and and they're just they're just going at it, you know, and they're both they're both chopping wood and and but the one he takes a break about every 15 minutes, you know, and sits down and gets back up and chops more wood and then he takes another break and takes a long lunch and and the other one chops wood all day. He don't take lunch. You don't do just like a young preacher, you know, he just just 100 miles an hour, you know, he just ready going for it. And he's just disgusted by this other guy. He said, "How in the world is he chopping more wood than I am?" And the guy said, "The problem is you don't what you didn't realize was, well, while you thought I was resting, I was sharpening my axe, right? He took time off &gt;&gt; to stay sharp, right? so that he could cut some wood. I'm preaching to somebody tonight. I'm not sure who it is. &gt;&gt; You know, when David, we talked about David, Solomon building the temple. David writes Psalm 127 for Solomon. &gt;&gt; He writes it for Solomon. And he writes this in verse one. Except the Lord build the house. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got a great house to build, Solomon. But except the Lord build the house. They labor in vain that build it. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, it's got to be the Lord. Solomon, you're if you you you got to what? Do these things in the appropriate time. Except the Lord keep the city. The watchman waketh, but in vain. &gt;&gt; It's vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows. For so he giveth his beloved sleep. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe he still does that today. I believe it's there for us if we could just step aside and take a rest. Come aside and rest, he said. Now, we know there's a physical rest, a mental rest, and a spiritual rest. And just by looking at you, I know that you need all three. I know I do. We need all three. See, some people can never rest because their brain won't shut off. Those of you who are like me who overthink things, you you know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Others have physical problems. Keep them awake at night. Brother Bill, I Bill told me I had a bad night. I I didn't know that when I had these notes and things ready, but uh you know, I've been there. I know what that's like. But as you get older, that's becomes more and more frequent. You can't rest because physically you've got problems. I believe we have a healer tonight &gt;&gt; who can heal that, take care of that &gt;&gt; so he can give his beloved sleep and and and others need spiritual rest and and but sometimes one type of uh rest or one type of ailment leads to another. So a person might have a physical problem that leads to their brain not shutting off or their brain won't shut off because and it causes physical problems. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon was speaking to a man in the prayer line. He said the man is going from me. This isn't a a dime store discernment right here. This isn't one you find on the on the cheapo aisle on on the clearance rack at Walmart. This is real discernment. He said, "The man is going away from me years ago. Your trouble started. You probably look 15 years or more younger than what you are now. It's a nervous condition. You've been bothered with a nerve trouble." He said, "I see you can't sleep. You're up pacing around restless. It's a nerve cause you." He said, "You don't know what it is. Doctors can't locate what it is. They don't know what it is." But Brother Brandon was about to tell him what it was. He said, "Here's what it is. As a child, he was playing near a seller steps." The man himself didn't know what happened. But can you imagine what it must have been to be standing there and hearing this and then realizing, "Yes, I remember." As a child, you was playing near a seller steps and you fell and it's put a put a vertebrae that's slightly out in the back. This is like an advertisement for chiropractors. Cuz he said there's a vertebrae that's slightly out in the back. There's your trouble. &gt;&gt; He said you're nervous. You can't sleep at night. And he traced the trouble all the way back to falling as a child and a vertebrae is slightly out in the back. He said you didn't come from this city. You come from another city, a river. It's New Jersey. Camden, New Jersey. Your name is Frank. They call you Frank Sack. He said, "You're healed, sir. Your faith has made you well. Go on your road. God has made you well." &gt;&gt; What was it? He had to he had to Brother Brandham had to tell him, "What's wrong with you? It's not what you think is wrong with you." &gt;&gt; Right. Again, he told someone, "You believe with all your heart, you want to get over nervous condition." Uh-huh. Yes. And you have such a nervous condition, it makes poor circulation. Your hands go numb and your feet and extremely nervous. Then you can't sleep at night. He said, "I see you lying in the bed and you keep raising up looking for a time, looking towards the window. Very nervous." That's true. Only God can heal you. Some of y'all constantly looking at your watches, you know, looking back at the back. God needs to heal you of that. You know, he said you're always looking out a window, very nervous. Only God can hear you. Would you come near while I ask him? Sorry, heavenly father, bless this woman who I bless in thy name. May thy spirit come upon her. Rebuke the evil spirit and say to him, "Lay this woman in Jesus Christ's name." Amen. He said, "Now you're quiet. It has left you. You feel quiet now." That's right, isn't it? If it is, raise your hand. He said, "Now it will always stay from from you if you just keep on believing. It will always stay from you if you just keep on believing." When you come up, something was even trying to hold you back. When you How many times have you experienced that? You wanted to come up for prayer and something was keeping you back. Brother Brandham, identified that as the devil. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said he said you something was trying to keep you from coming. He said that that is right, isn't it? Wave your hand. It was the devil. He didn't want you to get here. Just like he didn't want you to come to this service tonight. He didn't want you to be here for he knows Jesus is here and he knew he'd have to leave and you're the witness yourself. He said, "Now go home and sleep like a baby." Oh, I tell you what, I believe God's still that same God today. He's still Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that's your husband. another case, that's your husband praying for your lady, right? He's trying to contact God. You are too. You got a prayer card to come in this line. If you believe what I tell you, he said, "You're praying, wasn't you, sir? If you believe, you won't have to." &gt;&gt; That's powerful. &gt;&gt; He said, "Your nerves was give way on you. Can't sleep at night in a terrible shape. You're not from here either. You've come from the north coming south. You've come from a big city where there's a river runs through the city." That's right. Oh, you've been a long time this way, haven't you, lady? And you've been healed once, too. A cancer or something. That's right. some kind of a condition that was with you and God made you well. Now listen what how how bad she had gotten. He said now you have you call preachers and things to pray for you and things like that to make yourself rest at night. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I know if somebody wants to call me so that they'll rest, go ahead and do it. I'm perfectly fine with that. But look what she had gotten to. She actually had to call. So, you know, it was a spiritual problem. It was a mental thing. It wasn't a physical thing, but it was something in her spirit, in her soul, and or something in her in her spirit. And and she begins, she has to call a preacher to even go to sleep. Maybe that's just cuz preachers put her to sleep, but preacher sleep hotline. You know, you know, they have these apps now. I'm sorry. I'm having a good time in the house of God tonight. Are you glad to be in the house of the Lord tonight? Praise the Lord. I uh they have these apps now that make you sleep calm and and apps like that. You know what they are. You all use them just like I do. And they play this music. I found old there's there was an old radio program back in the day called Songs in the Night with Moody Radio. I loved that cuz that preacher would put me to sleep faster than anything and some of those those songs and but they've got this calm app. We ought to start an app just for preachers just to talk, you know, so you can go to sleep. Brother Joel will be the most downloaded sermons on there. My daughter told me one time, you can laugh a little. It's okay. My daughter told me one time, she said, she said, "Dad," she said, "you're not my favorite preacher." Melody told me this, and you're not my favorite preacher. And I said, "Why not?" She said, "Well," she said, "I like Brother Ivy." And I said, "Why?" She said, "He's long-winded. I can sleep through his sermons." And Brother Joel had just started preaching back then. He was a little shorter. And and she said, "I like Brother Joel." And I said, "Why?" I said, "Why?" She said, "Well, I can stay awake through his sermons and they're short." So, I guess I was somewhere down the list. Whatever helps. This lady needed to call preachers at night just to make yourself rest. He said, "You believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ make you well. You believe that his power will now heal you. You got to take a hold quickly, sister." Brother Brandon would constantly say this. You need to you need to respond quickly, &gt;&gt; right? When when when the spirit moves, that's the time to move. It'll be like David listening for them rustle of the malberry bushes and when it's time to move it's time to move. &gt;&gt; Said if you will with all your heart Jesus Christ will make you well. Look at another one. Another example. Look how an entire family can suffer with no rest. Listen. Brother says, "Now you're here." He said, "I see you now. People can still hear me." He said, "The woman is having a sleepless time. She can't sleep." That's right. You're you're getting sick, too. You can't hardly eat. You're getting very sick. You're afraid it's gallstones. That's right. You're right. Sick, nausea, feeling. There's somebody else you're interested in. That's your husband. He has kind of a nervous mental nervousness. Kind of a real mental nervous. So, she's afraid she's got gallstones. She can't sleep. Her husband's got a mental nervousness. He's bothered with some kind of trouble he's in. Now, look how how it manifested differently in the different members of the family. She was worried about her about being sick and he's worried about something, too. Can you imagine some of the fusses that might have happened in that home? like the the the the brother look at the sister and say, "You don't understand me what I'm going through. I'm worried about something." And her be like, "Well, you're not even paying any attention to me. And here I'm hurting &gt;&gt; and it's just the devil." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right. And look, he said he said he was trying to get something, a business deal. It's a pension or something. He's trying to get it. That's right. A pension. So, he's concerned. He's nervous because he's trying to get his pension, provide for his family. He said, "I see a little boy." Now, these are obviously older people. And then he said, "I see a little boy. He's about 12 years old, something like that. He's just a little fellow and he's really not your son." Said, "You've raised him and there's something you think that he has something went wrong with him." Now, I don't want to take a show of hands now, but how many of you mothers and fathers, especially you moms, you really thought something was wrong with your kid, and there wasn't nothing wrong with him, &gt;&gt; but you really thought it was because you're concerned about your child. That's right. &gt;&gt; But but he was con she was concerned about this boy. It wasn't hers. They're older and that can introduce chaos in a home. Right? When you got an older couple with a younger child and he said he's just a little fellow. You've raised him or something. You think that something has went wrong with him. He isn't. He's just a little boy. &gt;&gt; He'll be all right. Sure. It's okay. Believe the right thing. &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you're hearing me tonight. Believe the right thing. How many can do that tonight? What things should I believe? What God said about you? &gt;&gt; What the word says about you. Believe the right thing. Believe that you're saved. Believe that you're healed. Believe that you're delivered. Believe that everything's going to be okay. &gt;&gt; Believe the right thing. Everything will be all right. &gt;&gt; Go believing it. God bless sister. He said, "By the way, do you believe God can tell me who you are? You believe God can tell me, lady, Mrs. Red?" He said, "That's who you are. That's right. And then he speaks to the 12-year-old who must have been there. He said, "Sunny, it's all right. You mind your auntie. She thought something had happened, but it hasn't. You're just a little boy. You don't mean to do that. Go ahead. You'll be all right." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; They were all worried. He's worried about a pinchion he may or may not get. She's worried about gallstones she doesn't have. Did you notice, Brother Brand never said, "You have gallstones." He said, "You think it's gallstones." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And she's worried about her little boy who 12 years old who's acting like a 12-year-old, &gt;&gt; right? And all of them got this. I shouldn't have preached on rest. And all of them are all of them are all upset and and brother Brandon said, "You just need to believe the right things." &gt;&gt; How many of us could do that tonight? Oh, I want to believe the right thing. &gt;&gt; Come inside and rest. Not but but we don't just want to rest physically but for mental and spiritual strain. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Jesus recognized not only not only the disciples needed rest but the people needed rest. They needed rest from running from one feast to another and and one ordinance to another and one law to another and and and one one place to one rabbi to another trying to get somebody that can feed them. And and they're they're they're running back and forth. And Jesus comes up to them. Give me that next sign. Jesus comes to him, begins to cry, "Come unto me." &gt;&gt; All you that are searching around for just the right preacher to help you, just the right church or just the right thing, come unto me. That's what we need is to come unto him. &gt;&gt; Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden. He said, "And I will give you rest." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I will give you rest. What was he talking about? The restlessness of searching for a redeemer, searching for somebody like the dove who was looking, remember when the dove was released from the ark the first time, it had nowhere to go. Brother said the dove would not sit on a carcass of an animal, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So it oh God, it couldn't sit there and so it was restless. It could not find any place of rest &gt;&gt; until it come back to the ark. And Jesus said, I am the ark. I am the place of safety. Come unto me all ye that are labor. He's still that place of safety today. He's still our place of rest. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon talked about that three rooms in your house. He talked about the the kitchen and and the parlor and he said that was the outer courts in the tabernacle and the inner court of the tabernacle. But the Holy of Holies is the bedroom. He said the bedroom was a place of rest. Oh church, it's a place of rest. It's a place where we can go and we can realize everything's been taken care of. We're safe and secure. where in Jesus Christ ran from one teacher to another, from one doctrine to another trying to please God. And Jesus said, "Come unto me." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And rest. &gt;&gt; Our rest is the Holy Ghost. Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 9. There remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. &gt;&gt; Now, we're talking about spiritual rest. You need physical rest. We all do. &gt;&gt; We need mental rest. Got to give yourselves a break sometime. Give yourself some credit. &gt;&gt; But we also need to know that he is our rest. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is our rest. The Bible say he for he that has entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his. Isaiah 28:10 says, "For precept must be upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little. For with stammering lips and another tongue, will he speak to this people to whom he said, this is the rest, wherewith you may cause the weary to rest." And this is the refreshing. Yet they would not hear. The Jewish people would not hear. They were blinded for our sakes. But he said, "Here it is prophesied right here in Isaiah." And it come to pass about 700 years later at Pentecost when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said they would be. This is the true Sabbath that was promised. Thus, when they were filled with the Holy Ghost, they ceased from their worldly works, their worldly doings, their evil ways. The Holy Ghost took charge of their lives. They entered into rest. There is your rest. That is your Sabbath. So thankful for that. Brother Bill, there's times we can't sleep at night. There's times physically we just don't have the rest that we should have and we haven't taken enough time or been smart about the way we did things and so we find ourselves worn out and overworked and all of those things. There's times our mind just won't shut off and we got too many things going on and you know what I'm talking about church and it feels like you can't pay all the bills and you can't take care of the kids and you can't do what you need to do and you feel down on yourself and you get depressed and worried. But remember, even during that time, you've entered into the holy place. You've gone beyond the outer court. You've gone beyond the court of the Gentiles. You're inside. And when you're inside, that is your place of rest. Listen to me. No matter what happens in your life, no matter how hard the trial is, no matter how deep the valley is or how high the mountain is, you are still a son of God. You are still a daughter of God. When I get to worry about the ministry and I get worried and thinking nobody wants to hear me. And I I get to a place where I get all down and upset. I remember I'm still a son of God. Even if I fail in my preaching, I'm still a son of God. Even if I can't do what I want to do around the church, I'm still a son of God. &gt;&gt; Even when I'm frustrated because I can't physically do what I need to do, I'm still a son of God. And nothing can change that. I could fail in every other aspect of my life, but I'm still a son of God. You might be struggling with work, but you're still a son of God. You might be struggling with your kids, but you're still a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me tonight? &gt;&gt; Come on, church. If this was the last message, I want you to rest. It may maybe if it was the last time, and it won't be. I believe that with all my heart, but if it was the last time I'd ever preached to you, remember you can rest in the promises of God. You can rest in what he said when he said, "Come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." You can rest in the fact that you're a predestined child of God, elected before the foundation of the world, that you were in his mind, that you are chosen in him before the foundation of the world. You can rest in that. You can rest in the fact that he sent the message by your way. You said, "Brother Ben, are you trying to make us feel better about ourselves?" No, I'm telling you the truth if you'll receive it. I'm If you just let it in, I'm telling you what God says about you. &gt;&gt; Come on. When are we going to listen? We listen to everything the devil had to say about us. We've listened to everything the church had to say about us. We've listened to everything the internet has to say about us. When are we going to listen to what God has to say about us? &gt;&gt; Oh, we care so much about what everybody else says. But Lord, what are you thinking? He says, "You're my child. You're my chosen ones." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; There's your wrath. Hallelujah. That is your Sabbath. It's not a day nor a year, but the eternity of being filled and blessed in the Holy Spirit. It is you ceasing &gt;&gt; and God doing. &gt;&gt; It is God in you willing and doing of his good pleasure. &gt;&gt; Jesus was at rest. He did just what the father told him to do. He didn't have to prove nothing, &gt;&gt; right? He went to the pool of Beth Bethea and he knew he'd be criticized for walking through that pool and all them people sitting there and they found out, well, you were here. Why didn't you empty the hospital? &gt;&gt; But that wasn't his purpose. He didn't care about the criticism. Brother Brandon said, "We should walk unconscious of criticism." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And he didn't care about that. He just wanted to do the will of the father. So he went to the one who could receive help, the one that was elected to get up off his c. And oh my went to that one. I'm so glad he came to me. &gt;&gt; He went to that one laying there and said, "Do you want to be well?" And they he said, "Yes, but I don't know how to be. Every time I get up, I can't make it to the water." And there was the well of water right there. He said, "If you want to be well, pick up your bed and walk." And he walked away. A well, man. Jesus didn't have to prove nothing to nobody. He didn't have to prove how compassionate he was. He just did the will of the father. Oh, that we could be that way. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Not that we we want to love people. We want to do everything we can for people. But listen, the best thing we can do is the will of the father. That's right. &gt;&gt; It's your Sabbath. It's your rest. Oh, that people might come into him and find that rest. He said there's a cry in all hearts for that rest, but the majority don't know the answer. So, they try to steal the cry by religious process of keeping certain days or accepting denominational creeds and dogmas. Musicians go ahead and come. But failing in that, many tried drinking, carousing, and every physical excess, thinking that by worldly pleasures there could be some satisfaction. But in such there is no rest. You say, "Well, Brother Ben, you're preaching to message people. Surely we would never Oh, I know that we're human beings." And sometimes you wish you could be just one of the good old boys that don't worry about nothing. just sits home and does whatever he wants to on a Sunday. Wish you'd just be one of the girls, drink your wine, and go to the beach and do all the things that they do there. And you just wish you could be one of them. But in such, there is no rest. There there's been a phenomena where this just comes to my mind so you forgive me but been a phenomena where you know I know people want to be famous and the best way to be famous the easiest way is the internet now in fact people who want to promote music that they're writing they no longer go to a record label they get on the internet if you can get become a star on TikTok you're a big star so they there are people you know The paparazzi is hated. That's the people who go around take photos. You know, they follow celebrities around, take pictures of them. Do you know there's celebrities who pay paparazzi to follow them around? who actually tell them where they're going to be and then talk about how much they hate it, but they actually go the places where the paparazzi are and and make sure they get put on camera cuz they're desperate to get a little more well-known, have a little more fame, just a little bit more money, and I'll feel good about myself. Somebody told me that somebody won the lottery today or yesterday or something. It was like $1.2 billion or some crazy number. But there's no rest in that. They found lottery winners usually lose the money. There's no rest in it. But I can tell you where there is rest tonight. Come unto me. He said, "All you that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." They smoke and take pills to quiet their nerves, but there is no rest in earthly potions. They need Jesus. Oh, God. He's still the ultimate remedy. I know doctors can help. Even sometimes a a counselor, somebody to talk to can help. But the ultimate remedy is always going to be Jesus. That is the heavenly remedy to a broken spirit. That is the heavenly remedy to a to an addiction. That is the heavenly remedy. God has provided a way. And the prophet cried out, "Is there no bomb in Gilead? Is there no position there?" &gt;&gt; Why is the health of the daughter of my people not recovered? They need the heavenly remedy, the rest of the spirit. Has your soul found that rest? As we bow our heads together, no matter how much you rest your mind and your body, you need that rest. But no matter how much you rest it, till your soul finds rest, you'll be like the dove released from the ark who might at first decided, well, I'll do this. I'll do that. I'll sit over here, but just couldn't do it. You tried maybe being a backslider, tried going out, but you just can't do it. Maybe you're watching today and we got several families on vacation, others traveling and things, but maybe you're sitting there and you you've tried everything. I just can't get rest in my spirit. Jesus is still standing here today saying, "Come unto me. Come to the word. Come and partake of the word of God and the shakina glory in the presence of God." And in that presence there is rest. In that word there is peace. There's joy in the house of the Lord. Has your soul found that rest? You may find no rest like the dove, but she made it back to her place of safety. Maybe that's what we need to do tonight. Just come back. I'll be honest with you. No matter how tired I am, how weary I am. And sometimes I'm so tired. We go to these meetings. Sometimes you get so tired. And I get so tired. Sometimes preaching or whatever, you're traveling overseas, we get tired. But no matter how tired I am, I always got five minutes or 10 minutes or half an hour to spend in his presence because there's something about being in his presence that brings you into rest in your spirit. And no matter how weary you are, you come to the house of God and you you just maybe frenetic, just just upset, but there's something about being in his presence just you say, "Lord, I know you that peace is for me. that joy is for me. Why don't you rest in him tonight? Why don't we just worship him consciously do that tonight? Let's just worship him with all that we have. And then Lord, I know I know there's a place of rest for me. You're welcome to come to the altar if you need to come and pray or if you want me to pray for you, but why don't we just why don't we just worship him tonight and say, "Lord, I I'm entering into the Holy of I know that's my place of rest. I know there's a place for me and I know you are that place and that person. Would you just pray that way? Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we worship you tonight. We thank you for your goodness and your mercy. Thank you for your love, Lord, towards us, Lord, that we were without hope and you died for my sins, Lord. There's I rest in that, God. I rest in it because I haven't been good enough and no other man has ever been good enough to make it in on their own merit. But Lord, I know that by your blood, I have been saved. I've been born again. Now, let me rest, Lord. Oh, I know my heart has been changed. I know my soul there's something's happened. There's a shakina presence there, Lord. May I may I learn to rest in it. Oh God, may I be like the dove who could not find rest any other place. May I find my way back to the place of safety. Each one of these people, oh God, you know what the future is for them. You know what lies ahead. We don't know, Lord, when we leave these doors what the future will hold. But you know, Lord, and you hold that future. And I pray God that you would help us to rest in that, to rest in your knowledge and and your design and your purpose for our lives. We thank you for that. I pray that you'd move, Lord, in a mighty way. Stir us up, oh God. May there be such a revival, Lord, in our hearts, oh God. Lord, as the brothers preach and things coming up over the next few services, may there be such a stirring of your spirit, Lord, until we know that we've been every time we come to church, we've been in the house of the Lord. May we not slack off when we come to your house. May we give it all that we've got. May we take the time, Lord, to be ready for the presence of the Lord. I pray that you grant it. We thank you for all that you do. We give you praise. We give you glory tonight for all that you've done today in Jesus name. Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
