[45:12] amen amen God bless you turn with me to
[45:15] Genesis chapter
[45:17] 15 isn't the Lord good to us tonight
[45:21] Genesis
[45:23] 15:13 I know I've been preaching a lot
[45:25] out of these chapters lately but I I
[45:28] just can't get away from it and we've
[45:30] been going back and
[45:33] forth Genesis 15 and
[45:37] 13 and he said unto
[45:40] Abram know of assurity that thy seed
[45:44] shall be a stranger in a land that is
[45:46] not theirs and Shall Serve them and they
[45:50] shall afflict them 400
[45:53] years and also that Nation whom they
[45:56] Shall Serve will I judge and and
[45:59] afterward shall they come out with great
[46:04] substance and thou shalt go to thy
[46:06] fathers in
[46:08] peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old
[46:11] age but in the fourth generation they
[46:14] shall come hither again for the iniquity
[46:18] of the amorites is not yet full I want
[46:21] to title this tonight we still believe
[46:24] in total Deliverance pray the Lord would
[46:27] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[46:31] seated when Moses came to pharaoh and
[46:35] said let my people go he was coming as
[46:38] the result of a commission that he'd
[46:41] been given at the burning bush where God
[46:45] spoke directly to him and he said uh he
[46:48] he said uh he said I will go down and
[46:52] deliver my people and but it was not an
[46:55] isolated event it was not an anointing
[46:58] that did not have a backing in Prophecy
[47:01] or in the word because God had already
[47:03] told Abraham he said your seed will be
[47:07] in bondage for 400 years he said but I'm
[47:09] going to deliver them and he said
[47:11] they're going to come out with a great
[47:13] substance so he doesn't just say they're
[47:15] going to come out but he says how
[47:17] they're going to come out he said
[47:19] they're actually going to come out with
[47:21] a great substance in other words they
[47:23] were promised a total deliverance from
[47:26] Egypt a complete deliverance from Egypt
[47:29] and I think we've been promised the same
[47:31] thing today we've been promised a
[47:33] complete deliverance and we we won't
[47:35] settle for anything less than that we
[47:38] don't want anything less than what God
[47:40] has for us in the hour that we're living
[47:43] we don't want to settle back and become
[47:45] Leo toan in our ways and lukewarm in our
[47:48] thinking we need to press forward and
[47:50] recognize that God has given us a great
[47:53] promise of total Deliverance in the hour
[47:56] that we live live in so we don't want to
[47:58] settle young people you don't need to
[48:00] settle for anything less than the very
[48:02] best of God's will for your life you
[48:04] don't need to settle for the permissive
[48:05] will of God in the age that we live in
[48:08] you seek the perfect will of God the
[48:10] perfect will of God for a marriage the
[48:12] perfect will of God for where you go to
[48:14] church the perfect will of God for the
[48:16] things that you you you have in life why
[48:18] because you you are able to do that in
[48:21] the hour that we live in don't settle
[48:23] for permissive will and say well I'll be
[48:25] just a good enough Christ CH to make me
[48:27] miserable no I don't want to be that
[48:29] kind of Christian I want to be somebody
[48:31] who possesses all the promises of God
[48:34] how many can say Amen to that tonight I
[48:36] want to possess everyone that God has
[48:39] for me I want to possess all of the
[48:42] promises so Moses come before Pharaoh
[48:44] knowing that God had promised a total
[48:48] deliverance and so in Exodus 10 God
[48:50] begins fulfilling his word by plaguing
[48:53] Egypt that was what he said he would do
[48:56] and they would come out with a great
[48:58] substance he said that Nation will I
[49:01] judge and he begins to do that but now
[49:04] Pharaoh attempts to begin to
[49:07] negotiate see because the devil's not
[49:10] just going to say well I'm whooped you
[49:11] know they they got me you got me it's
[49:14] 400 years the devil don't give up that
[49:16] easy but he tries if he can't get you to
[49:20] totally disbelief he tries to negotiate
[49:23] a
[49:24] settlement to make you happy but not
[49:27] give you everything that's yours to make
[49:30] you settle down and not really become
[49:33] all that God wanted you to be so in
[49:37] Exodus chap 10 and verse 8 and we've
[49:40] read this recently but I just wanted to
[49:42] go over this as we get into this tonight
[49:44] Moses and Aaron were brought again to
[49:46] Pharaoh he said unto them go serve the
[49:48] Lord your God but who are they that
[49:50] shall go so in other words he's saying
[49:53] okay okay you win there's been eight
[49:55] plagues nine plagues and it's okay you
[49:58] know you can go but he said when you go
[50:01] tell me who's going to go assuming
[50:04] they're going to leave some of them
[50:05] behind and Moses said we will go with
[50:09] our young sir and with our old with our
[50:13] sons and with our daughters with our
[50:17] flocks and with our herds will we go for
[50:20] we must hold a feast unto the Lord now
[50:24] we're going somewhere we're going to the
[50:27] supper of the
[50:28] lamb and in order to do that we're going
[50:30] to go with everything we're going to
[50:33] have peace we're going to have joy we're
[50:36] going to have healing we're going to
[50:38] have the salvation of our children we're
[50:40] going to have joy in the house of God
[50:43] we're going to have the presence of God
[50:44] Among Us we're not going to settle for
[50:46] anything halfway we're going to have
[50:48] everything God has for us oh and not
[50:52] what you want in your life brother Gabe
[50:53] it's so good to see you and Millie back
[50:55] in church and brother Justin back T
[50:57] tonight in your family don't you want
[50:59] everything that God has for you don't
[51:01] you want there's something there the God
[51:03] had a picture in his mind of what you
[51:06] would be in this hour and and and he and
[51:08] he wants you to become that he's helping
[51:10] you become that and I just want to yield
[51:12] to him and let let the word manifest in
[51:15] my life right amen I feel like I'm I'm
[51:19] shouting at you tonight but I just felt
[51:21] like I I was passionate about this I
[51:23] want to get it to you in a way that the
[51:25] way I feel it tonight
[51:27] listen he said they'll come out with
[51:28] great
[51:30] substance and so what is Moses saying
[51:33] he's saying we still believe in Genesis
[51:36] 15:14 yeah Moses would believe that
[51:39] because he wrote it right it was
[51:42] revealed to him he said this is what God
[51:45] told Abraham you'll come out with a
[51:47] great
[51:48] substance a and so Moses uh is is saying
[51:52] we're not going to take a slightly
[51:54] doubted promise see again Satan's trying
[51:57] to get you to disbelieve the promise in
[51:59] its entirety but if he can't do that
[52:01] he'll begin a negotiation right and I
[52:03] would ask you which part of the promise
[52:06] are you willing to give up on and I
[52:09] would hope that the answer would be none
[52:11] of it right amen none of it you don't
[52:15] have to and and we read this quote here
[52:18] a couple Services ago but just to bring
[52:19] it back to your memory maybe read a
[52:21] little bit more of it he said that's the
[52:23] way the devil wants a Christian to come
[52:25] it'll be all right for you to join the
[52:27] church but don't you never forgive
[52:29] Jones but I want
[52:31] forgiveness I want a complete
[52:34] deliverance he says you don't have to
[52:36] give up you're smoking you're drinking
[52:38] you're lying you're stealing you're
[52:40] fault finding backbiting you don't have
[52:42] to give that up just join the church but
[52:45] Moses wasn't a compromiser right he
[52:47] wanted complete deliverance he said
[52:50] we'll not leave one hoof behind I love
[52:53] that he said we'll take everything that
[52:56] belong bels to us when we go to Worship
[52:58] the Lord he said and that's the way the
[53:00] church ought to be he said we'll take
[53:02] righteousness we'll take Holiness we'll
[53:05] take the Holy Spirit we'll take a
[53:07] unified group when we go to the Altar
[53:10] and I love when brother Brandon preaches
[53:11] this a total Deliverance in 1959 you'll
[53:14] find that the church just had a
[53:16] vote and brother brandom deals with that
[53:19] all through this sermon about the church
[53:21] having a vote and the church had decided
[53:23] to do something and evidently there was
[53:25] a whole lot of attention in the church
[53:27] she said could that happen in a church
[53:29] where a prophet uh was the overseer of
[53:32] that church and a pastor there would
[53:33] that happen that church sure it could
[53:35] yeah right because people are human
[53:37] beings and there was a lot of dissension
[53:40] in the church over whether they should
[53:41] build a new church or not and I'm glad
[53:43] we don't have that tonight right we
[53:45] don't have that problem yet but but but
[53:48] you know things like that happen things
[53:50] come up they put in new deacons new
[53:51] trustees and so brother Brandon was
[53:53] challenging them he said we don't want
[53:54] to leave anybody behind he said whatever
[53:56] the church decides we need to follow
[53:58] that we need to we need to put up get
[54:00] behind it and and support it he said
[54:03] let's take a unified group when we go to
[54:05] the altar we'll be a real group we'll
[54:07] leave nothing behind someone say nothing
[54:10] we'll leave nothing behind we'll take
[54:12] everything there won't be one hoof stay
[54:15] back here you know he said and people
[54:17] can pray in such a way till the devil
[54:20] will have to give in don't you want to
[54:22] pray that way we ought to pray that way
[54:23] about these meetings we ought to pray
[54:24] that way about our children I'm going to
[54:26] pray in such a way that the devil have
[54:28] to give in Lord I'm not taking anything
[54:31] for granted I'm taking everything that
[54:34] you have given me sir now we have total
[54:38] Deliverance tonight through the blood of
[54:41] Jesus Christ that's how we have
[54:43] Deliverance brother brandom says all
[54:45] Jesus Works was
[54:47] complete everything was complete total
[54:51] delivered he totally delivered the leper
[54:54] from leprosy he to totally delivered the
[54:57] woman with the blood issue from her
[54:59] issue see the gospel is not a 12-step
[55:01] program right it's not getting better
[55:03] yeah right it's
[55:05] overcoming it's not putting up with our
[55:08] sin it's becoming what he wants us to be
[55:11] it's being purged being cleansed from
[55:14] our sin so it's not a it's not just well
[55:17] if we if we treat them right and if we
[55:19] baby him and we we pamper them a little
[55:21] bit then they'll eventually become
[55:23] Christians you know that's not the way
[55:24] it works at all but a real there's
[55:26] something about somebody who's got a
[55:28] seed of God on the inside that that when
[55:30] that word strikes it it begins to grow
[55:32] and you could put concrete over the top
[55:34] of it that seed will push right up to
[55:36] the middle of it why because because
[55:39] there's a seed of God there and so we
[55:42] don't have to baby that we can just
[55:44] preach the word of God and it comes
[55:46] up and so he said he totally delivered
[55:49] the woman with the blood issue from her
[55:51] issue he totally delivered the world
[55:53] from sin when he died at the day of
[55:56] atonement do you believe that a total
[55:58] deliverance from sin he totally
[56:00] delivered every sin he delivered the
[56:02] church so there's no need for us to live
[56:05] under
[56:07] privilege right there's no need you said
[56:09] what my brother Ben you don't understand
[56:11] my situation there is no need for us to
[56:13] live in under privilege do we believe
[56:15] the words that God said or not right
[56:19] we're going to believe what God said
[56:21] there's no need for us to live under
[56:22] privilege there's no need for us to live
[56:23] in a defeated State because he defeated
[56:25] the devil and took all the
[56:26] principalities and Powers subdued them
[56:28] under his feet and they have no legal
[56:31] rights to rule over you yeah right now
[56:36] you wouldn't let somebody uh somebody
[56:38] take all your guns out of your
[56:41] house most of you wouldn't Harvey said
[56:45] amen some of y'all you never let the you
[56:48] never let the government come in take
[56:49] all your
[56:50] guns but we let the devil come in and
[56:53] just take whatever he wants well there's
[56:56] 's my joy but you know I'm I'm going
[56:58] through a hard time so I can't have that
[57:00] no he promised a total
[57:03] Deliverance you got a right to have joy
[57:06] you got a right to have peace you got a
[57:07] right and it doesn't matter what's
[57:10] happened in your life you still have
[57:12] that right to take what God promised you
[57:15] the promise doesn't change listen no
[57:17] matter how hard they they whip the
[57:19] Israelites no matter how much they put
[57:21] them under bondage no matter how many
[57:22] they killed the promise didn't change
[57:26] no matter how heavy the bricks were no
[57:28] matter how hard the work was no matter
[57:30] how hot the sun was no matter how
[57:32] horrible a condition they were in for
[57:34] the Joe the promise still didn't change
[57:37] and I'm here to tell you tonight no
[57:38] matter what the devil does in your life
[57:40] no matter how hard he makes it no matter
[57:42] how stressed out you are no matter how
[57:44] worried you are about what's going to
[57:46] happen tomorrow the promis has never
[57:48] changed he still said I want to bring a
[57:50] total Deliverance to your life I want to
[57:53] help you I want to make you what I want
[57:55] you to be right do you believe it
[57:58] tonight yes
[58:00] amen
[58:02] hallelujah we are Christians filled with
[58:05] the Holy Ghost we don't have to have the
[58:08] devil dictate to us right all
[58:14] right I've told some of y'all a story I
[58:16] may have told it from the pulpit I don't
[58:17] remember but I come up here one time and
[58:20] and uh there was a a guy that was
[58:22] walking down the highway and he was
[58:24] actually walking up the highway walking
[58:26] up towards uh to the north but he'
[58:28] stopped here on one of our benches and I
[58:30] was ready for him to move on and I said
[58:32] something about it he'd been here a
[58:34] while and and he said uh he said well he
[58:37] said I would he said but I'm just taking
[58:38] a break he said I just live over here
[58:40] about five miles away and so I said well
[58:43] I'll take you home and so he uh I he got
[58:47] in the truck you know and my truck isn't
[58:50] always clean on the inside sometimes and
[58:53] I but it was pretty clean that day it
[58:55] was pretty good and
[58:56] and it but it had a few papers around
[58:58] maybe a Coke from Sonic or something
[59:00] like that and he he gets in that truck
[59:03] now remember he don't have a
[59:05] car he gets in my truck he said he said
[59:08] you know I always put a trash bag in my
[59:13] truck I thought well that's a good idea
[59:16] but you're getting a ride for
[59:18] me sit here tell me how dirty my truck
[59:21] is you realize what we let the devil do
[59:23] to us that's ridiculous isn't it

[59:28] us he gets in the ride with us and says
[59:29] well you know you know I you ought to do
[59:32] better you're not much of a Christian
[59:33] well he's not much of one
[59:38] either he said well you might go to hell
[59:41] well he's definitely going to
[59:44] hell right you're not going to make it
[59:46] well I know you're not going to make
[59:48] it we don't need him in in our lives
[59:52] dictating the terms to us and telling us
[59:54] what we can have and what we can't have
[59:56] no we need to have a total Deliverance
[59:59] in our lives he said Christ delivered us
[1:00:01] total Deliverance delivered us from evil
[1:00:04] delivered us from sin delivered us from
[1:00:06] Habits delivered us from Talking oh

[1:00:23] a total Deliverance today a complete
[1:00:26] total Deliverance he delivered our
[1:00:28] sickness he delivered us from sickness

[1:00:37] healer if you need healing tonight he is
[1:00:39] your
[1:00:41] healer amen the same God that promised
[1:00:45] total Deliverance to Abraham promised
[1:00:47] total Deliverance to us I want you to
[1:00:50] understand we're not living in the age
[1:00:52] of a partial Deliverance we're living in
[1:00:54] the age of a total Deliverance we're
[1:00:56] living in a Rapture age what that means
[1:00:59] is that there's a Rapture on and and one
[1:01:02] of these days our bodies are going to
[1:01:04] change and and it's going to be a total
[1:01:07] change a complete change we're going to
[1:01:11] this body is not going to stay like it
[1:01:13] is not one cell will be left
[1:01:17] unchanged praise God for that right not
[1:01:21] one Incorruptible cannot inherit
[1:01:24] Incorruptible so there can't be one
[1:01:26] corrupt oh God not one bit of DNA will
[1:01:29] be left
[1:01:31] unchanged right it'll be changed from
[1:01:33] the natural to the supernatural this is
[1:01:36] the age of 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I
[1:01:38] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:01:40] sleep but we shall all someone say all
[1:01:43] we shall all be changed verse 52 in a
[1:01:45] moment in the twinkling of an eye at the
[1:01:47] last Trump for the trumpet shall sound
[1:01:49] and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:50] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:01:54] just as real of a promise as the one
[1:01:56] that said you'll be in uh Egypt for 400
[1:01:58] years but you're going to be delivered
[1:02:00] with a great with a great
[1:02:02] Deliverance amen amen we still believe
[1:02:06] in the Rapture how many believe in the
[1:02:08] rapture we still believe that God is is
[1:02:12] uh is working among us and one of these
[1:02:14] days our bodies are going to be changed
[1:02:16] we still believe in
[1:02:19] restoration right that we have been
[1:02:21] restored according to Joel 2:25 I will
[1:02:23] restore to you the years that the Locust
[1:02:27] ha eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar
[1:02:29] the Palmer worm my great armony which I
[1:02:31] sent among you and you shall eat in
[1:02:33] plenty and be satisfied and praise the
[1:02:35] name of the Lord your God that it dealt
[1:02:37] wondrously with you and my people shall
[1:02:39] never be ashamed what what is he saying
[1:02:43] he's saying you're you're going to be
[1:02:44] restored we believe that happened in our
[1:02:46] day yeah we believe that's more than
[1:02:49] just a promise it's a reality we believe
[1:02:52] it's time to go knocking on Pharaoh's
[1:02:54] door
[1:02:55] right right say let my people
[1:02:58] go because this is the hour of
[1:03:00] restoration now if we were to be
[1:03:02] restored what would we be restored to
[1:03:04] we'd be restored to Jude three where he
[1:03:06] says I I exhorted you that you should
[1:03:08] earnestly contend for the faith which
[1:03:11] was once delivered to the Saints so we
[1:03:13] would be restored back to the faith it
[1:03:15] was once delivered to the Saints what
[1:03:17] faith is that brother BR says it's the
[1:03:18] same one that come down on the day of
[1:03:20] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's
[1:03:22] manifested today from glory to glory to
[1:03:25] glory right remember Paul says we're all
[1:03:28] changed into that same image from glory
[1:03:29] to glory and brother brand picks up on
[1:03:31] that and he says it's from one age to
[1:03:34] another from glory to glory but they
[1:03:36] could see partially in Luther and
[1:03:39] partially in Wesley and partially with
[1:03:41] the gifts in Pentecost but now we see
[1:03:44] him face to face now look we've been
[1:03:47] changed this isn't the age of the stalk
[1:03:49] this isn't the age of the tossel this
[1:03:51] isn't the age of the hus this is the age
[1:03:54] of the wheat coming back again the
[1:03:57] original grain how many know that the
[1:04:00] original grain so that original grain
[1:04:03] that Original Seed is a restoration back
[1:04:06] to the one that went down into the
[1:04:08] ground he said it's back to its original
[1:04:10] seed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:12] with the same signs same wonders same
[1:04:16] baptism same kind of people acting the
[1:04:21] same way with the same power come on the
[1:04:25] same sens
[1:04:26] all right it's from glory to glory right
[1:04:29] he said and the next will be changed
[1:04:31] from this Glory into a body like his own
[1:04:34] glorious body where we shall see him
[1:04:39] right we still believe that Malachi 4
[1:04:41] was
[1:04:42] effective behold I'll send you Elijah
[1:04:45] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:04:46] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[1:04:48] he shall turn listen there's no
[1:04:50] ambivalence about it there's he might
[1:04:52] turn maybe if they if everybody
[1:04:54] cooperates right that's not what he said
[1:04:58] it's just as oh my it's just the same
[1:05:00] way he told Abraham he said your seed
[1:05:02] will be as a Stranger in a Strange Land
[1:05:04] but after 400 years they'll be they'll
[1:05:06] come out with a mighty hand right there
[1:05:09] will be a complete deliverance and in
[1:05:10] this hour what did he say he said they
[1:05:13] he he said the heart of the children
[1:05:15] will be turned to the heart of the
[1:05:17] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[1:05:19] with a curse he shall turn yeah now
[1:05:22] watch he said brother brand said now we
[1:05:24] are promising Malachi 4 but the same
[1:05:26] system he always did as prophets that we
[1:05:29] would be restored back to the original
[1:05:31] Faith oh oh my back to the original seed
[1:05:36] back to the seed like it began on the
[1:05:38] day of Pentecost back to the same
[1:05:42] Doctrine
[1:05:43] on right word by word Power by power
[1:05:50] Spirit by Spirit the same thing just
[1:05:52] exactly like it was back in the
[1:05:54] beginning through S signs and wonders of
[1:05:56] the living presence of Jesus Christ
[1:06:00] after 2,000 years oh I believe a
[1:06:04] prophet's declaring something to us
[1:06:05] after 2,000 years he is still alive he
[1:06:09] said brother Ben what does that have to
[1:06:11] do with me listen if he's alive he can
[1:06:13] he's alive when you need him he's alive
[1:06:15] in your job he's alive at home he's
[1:06:17] alive when you're struggling with your
[1:06:19] children he's alive when you feel like
[1:06:20] you can't make it anymore he's alive
[1:06:23] when you get down to your lowest moment
[1:06:24] of Life he's still there young people
[1:06:26] he'll be there for you and with you he
[1:06:29] said I'll never leave you I'll never
[1:06:30] forsake you he's still alive after 2000
[1:06:33] years a prophet stood here and declared
[1:06:36] he's still alive didn't just say it but
[1:06:38] he proved it yeah right are you with me
[1:06:41] so far so that same Doctrine same power
[1:06:45] Same Spirit after 2,000 years he's the
[1:06:48] same yesterday today and forever we
[1:06:50] still believe yeah in Mark 16 yes go you
[1:06:55] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:06:57] to Every
[1:07:00] Creature we still
[1:07:02] believe in Acts
[1:07:05] two right when they staggered out like
[1:07:07] drunk men tongues of fire separated on
[1:07:09] each one of them we still believe in
[1:07:13] that kind of an
[1:07:15] experience right we still believe God's
[1:07:18] God does that sir we still believe in 1
[1:07:20] John
[1:07:22] 1:7 you know how much we believe we
[1:07:24] believe in all of of it but let me just
[1:07:27] read a few things that we believe we
[1:07:29] still believe 1 John 1:7 if we walk in
[1:07:31] the light how many are walking in the
[1:07:33] light tonight W boy that's almost total
[1:07:36] participation right there if we walk in
[1:07:37] the light as he is in the light we have
[1:07:40] Fellowship one with
[1:07:42] another oh we we can stop right there
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:46] preach
[1:07:48] listen the the scriptures declare that
[1:07:51] we would have Fellowship one with
[1:07:52] another yeah right and brother Brandon
[1:07:55] back set up and said if God is in your
[1:07:56] heart you'll want to be there every time
[1:07:57] the doors are open I realize things keep
[1:07:59] us out of church sometimes I'm not
[1:08:00] preaching about that but there'll be a
[1:08:02] desire in our heart to be with God's
[1:08:04] people there will be a desire to
[1:08:06] fellowship with God's you're not going
[1:08:07] to sit off by yourself Serve Yourself
[1:08:09] communion that's not what the Bible
[1:08:12] teaches right we still
[1:08:15] believe amen if we walk in the light we
[1:08:18] have fellowship with one another and the
[1:08:20] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses
[1:08:23] us from how much sin all sin all sin
[1:08:28] amen we'll have fellowship with one
[1:08:30] another and he cleanses us from all sin
[1:08:31] we still believe in Mark
[1:08:34] 11:23 huh where he said verily I say
[1:08:37] unto you whosoever shall say to this
[1:08:39] mountain this mountain say what mountain
[1:08:42] is that brother Ben whichever one's in
[1:08:43] front of you yeah whichever one you
[1:08:46] happen to be facing at the moment yeah I
[1:08:49] didn't know if you look on certain Maps
[1:08:52] do some of these Hills have names did
[1:08:53] you know that some of these Hills Hills
[1:08:55] have names this one over here is called
[1:08:57] bigger's Hill I don't know where they
[1:09:00] got that name somebody just gave it that
[1:09:01] name there's Hills all around it's got
[1:09:02] names oh but I'll tell you this it don't
[1:09:05] matter if they're named or not which one
[1:09:06] can you overcome the one you're standing
[1:09:08] in front of the one that's in your way
[1:09:12] that's the one you speak to amen little
[1:09:14] or big that's the one you speak to be
[1:09:17] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[1:09:19] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:09:20] shall believe that those things which he
[1:09:22] sayth shall come to pass he shall have
[1:09:24] whatsoever ever he
[1:09:27] saith that was manifested in our day we
[1:09:30] still believe and had he right spoke the
[1:09:32] word right after William brandham come
[1:09:35] there and talked to her and told her
[1:09:37] those things and and she said it's
[1:09:38] nothing but the truth and the presence
[1:09:40] of God moved down and she said it's
[1:09:42] nothing but the truth and he said you
[1:09:44] can have whatever you ask for and she
[1:09:46] asked for her children we still believe
[1:09:48] that that
[1:09:50] happened don't don't we we still believe
[1:09:53] it we're not going to take a partial
[1:09:54] Deliverance or or say well maybe it
[1:09:56] didn't really happen that way we believe
[1:09:58] yeah right are you with me now yeah we
[1:10:02] believe that he shall have whatsoever he
[1:10:04] say we still believe in
[1:10:06] Revelation we believe that God come down
[1:10:09] and opened the book in our day we
[1:10:12] believe in Revelation 10
[1:10:14] 1-7 we believe the book has been open we
[1:10:17] believe that when seven angels formed a
[1:10:18] cloud on Sunset Mountain fulfilling
[1:10:20] Revelation 10:1 brother Brandon was sent
[1:10:23] back to Tucson to preach the Seven Seals
[1:10:26] and we don't believe that he has to
[1:10:27] preach anything else I'm just speaking
[1:10:30] for you tonight but I know I know this
[1:10:32] is what you believe we don't believe he
[1:10:33] has to come back and preach anything
[1:10:35] else why because we believe we got a
[1:10:37] total
[1:10:40] Deliverance he was sent back to Tucson
[1:10:42] to preach the Seven Seals we still
[1:10:44] believe when the seventh Angels sounded
[1:10:46] the mystery was finished why the Bible
[1:10:48] said it would
[1:10:49] be the book was open we believe the
[1:10:52] Mysteries was in the Seven Seals brother
[1:10:55] said when those Seven Seals was open
[1:10:56] that opened up the entire Bible the
[1:10:59] Seven Seals was seal with seven
[1:11:00] Mysteries and in these Seven Seals held
[1:11:02] the entire mystery of it again he said
[1:11:05] but since the opening of those Seven
[1:11:06] Seals them Angels just behind the
[1:11:08] mountain Yonder this has become a new
[1:11:10] book yeah do you still believe it church
[1:11:13] do you believe it's a total
[1:11:15] Deliverance it's a completely new book
[1:11:18] it's an open
[1:11:19] book oh my oh my the Revelation I know
[1:11:24] sometimes you think well that's too deep
[1:11:25] for me I don't know if the seals are
[1:11:27] open or not you need to understand that
[1:11:29] the book is open let me tell you why
[1:11:32] because anything that's closed or or
[1:11:34] that you say well I that's just too deep
[1:11:36] for me I can't understand that the devil
[1:11:37] can attack you there right the devil
[1:11:40] come after you there but there's a
[1:11:43] people on the Earth today who believe
[1:11:44] the book has been open and because the
[1:11:46] book has been open all the power in it
[1:11:49] been released all everything that was
[1:11:51] written for our day can come to
[1:11:53] pass are you with me now yeah so it's
[1:11:56] important to believe the book has been
[1:11:57] opened since the opening of those Seven
[1:11:58] Seals of them Angels just behind the
[1:12:00] mountain Yonder this has become a new
[1:12:02] book it's the things that's been hid as
[1:12:04] being revealed as God promised in
[1:12:05] Revelation 10 he would do it and we are
[1:12:08] the privileged people that God has
[1:12:11] chosen of the earth that we might see
[1:12:13] and understand these
[1:12:15] things oh the devil trying to tell you
[1:12:18] you can't understand it but it's not
[1:12:20] really that complicated because it's not
[1:12:22] a mystery anymore it was a mystery yeah
[1:12:26] that's not a mystery anymore that we
[1:12:28] might see who's he talking about that's
[1:12:30] me I identify brother steart I identify
[1:12:34] with that that me I can see and
[1:12:36] understand these things not some
[1:12:39] mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying
[1:12:40] to make it up right it's the word of God
[1:12:43] made manifest proven that it's right
[1:12:45] proven not by science but by God that
[1:12:48] it's right again we still believe this
[1:12:50] don't we again he said the very day when
[1:12:52] this messenger not when he starts on
[1:12:55] when he begins to declare his message
[1:12:56] the first poll healing second poll
[1:12:58] prophesying third pole the opening of
[1:13:00] the word the Mysteries revealed no more
[1:13:02] higher order to reveal the word than
[1:13:03] prophets but the only way the prophet
[1:13:05] can be Vindicated is by the word and
[1:13:08] remember you know if the book's not open
[1:13:10] the prophet hasn't been Vindicated yet
[1:13:12] because this Prophet was to open all the
[1:13:15] mysteries of
[1:13:16] God so if the book's still closed the
[1:13:19] prophet's still not Vindicated but if
[1:13:21] the book is open the prophet's been
[1:13:23] Vindicated
[1:13:25] amen hallelujah no notice he he said
[1:13:28] he'll turn the uh he said to reveal the
[1:13:31] hidden truth been sealed in the word he
[1:13:33] told us this messenger of Malachi 4 in
[1:13:35] Revelation 10:7 is going to do two
[1:13:37] things one he will turn the hearts of
[1:13:39] the children to the fathers two he will
[1:13:42] reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:13:44] thunders in Revelation 10 which are the
[1:13:47] revelations contained in the Seven Seals
[1:13:50] that's just as plain as you can preach
[1:13:52] it right he said it will be these
[1:13:55] divinely revealed it'll be these
[1:13:57] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:13:59] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:14:00] children to the Pentecostal
[1:14:03] fathers so if we believe that the book
[1:14:06] is open then we believe the what has
[1:14:09] come the Original Seed has come and has
[1:14:11] been restored
[1:14:12] back and
[1:14:16] listen if it was just meant for brother
[1:14:18] brandham why did he have to preach
[1:14:21] it right why did he spend the last three
[1:14:24] years of his life preaching these things
[1:14:26] if we weren't able to receive it sir but
[1:14:29] there's got to be somebody on the earth
[1:14:31] that can receive it there's got to be
[1:14:33] somebody we still believe that the
[1:14:36] church was totally delivered from dogmas
[1:14:39] and Creeds into the blessing and the
[1:14:42] liberty of God yeah we still believe the
[1:14:45] book has been open and if the book is
[1:14:47] opened we will not leave here a week
[1:14:52] cast off right
[1:14:56] depressed halfway dressed are you with
[1:14:58] me now we will not leave here A bunch of
[1:15:01] people that have not received any kind
[1:15:04] of Revelation wondering whether we're
[1:15:05] going to make it or not we will not
[1:15:07] leave here at just a dwindling man bunch
[1:15:10] of people that don't know anything about
[1:15:11] the message we will leave here as a
[1:15:14] bride fully dressed the bride has made
[1:15:17] herself ready amen we will not leave as
[1:15:20] someone who is just uh uh has has not
[1:15:23] heard a clear Voice or a clear sound
[1:15:25] wondering what they believe we will
[1:15:27] leave here having the word in our
[1:15:29] hearts we will We Still Believe We Still
[1:15:33] Believe in a bride that has made herself
[1:15:35] ready we still believe in a Perfect
[1:15:38] sinless Bride not one word failing
[1:15:42] anywhere that's a quote go look it up
[1:15:45] not one word failing anywhere we still
[1:15:48] believe in that kind of
[1:15:49] bride now I know you say brother Ben
[1:15:52] you're crazy you're fanatical no this is
[1:15:55] the truth yeah right and no amount of
[1:15:58] Pharaoh's negotiation can change that
[1:16:02] yeah right and he negotiates with you
[1:16:05] every day try to get you to disbelieve
[1:16:07] some part of it say well you don't have
[1:16:09] to do this you don't have to do that you
[1:16:11] you got to settle you got to settle
[1:16:13] life's different now than it used to be
[1:16:14] no we still believe in a complete and a
[1:16:18] total deliverance we won't leave one
[1:16:21] hoof
[1:16:22] behind are you with me now
[1:16:25] we still believe that he is the
[1:16:28] word so when a spirit born Spirit-filled
[1:16:31] man in faith takes that word into his
[1:16:34] heart and places it upon his lips it's
[1:16:36] the same as deity
[1:16:39] speaking most of this St I'm saying is
[1:16:41] quotes but I just don't have time to go
[1:16:43] through all the quotes we still believe
[1:16:44] that a man can live so close to God till
[1:16:47] the devil don't know what to do with it
[1:16:50] come
[1:16:51] on Hallelujah the devil tried to kill
[1:16:53] you and he just can't do it the devil
[1:16:55] try to bring you down and you just can't
[1:16:57] do it the devil try to make you
[1:16:58] depressed and he just can't do it that's
[1:17:00] the kind of Christian I want to be I
[1:17:03] don't want to be a weak halfway kind of
[1:17:05] kind of person you say well I am weak
[1:17:07] well it's time to get strong then this
[1:17:09] hour let the weak say I am strong are
[1:17:12] you with me now we still believe in a
[1:17:14] complete deliverance we still believe
[1:17:17] the power of God can so change a person
[1:17:19] here at the altar that they can make him
[1:17:21] a completely new person in a moment
[1:17:25] we still believe that and if a person
[1:17:28] has been changed their attitude changes
[1:17:30] the way they the way they deal with
[1:17:32] people changes the way they deal with
[1:17:33] the church changes and something about
[1:17:36] it there's something about them that's
[1:17:37] different than what it was we still
[1:17:39] believe in a changed
[1:17:40] life right and it'll be evident you
[1:17:44] won't have to try to convince me that
[1:17:45] you're a Christian or convince somebody
[1:17:47] else are you with me now we still
[1:17:50] believe in a good oldfashioned sky blue
[1:17:54] skin
[1:17:55] sin killing
[1:17:59] religion right you ever heard brother
[1:18:02] Brandon say that we still believe in
[1:18:04] that we still we still believe we need
[1:18:06] preaching that makes Heaven high and
[1:18:10] Hell hot Gun Barrel
[1:18:14] straight right we still believe that we
[1:18:18] still believe the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:18:20] cleanses us from all
[1:18:22] unrighteousness we become sons and
[1:18:24] daughters of God by confessing our sins
[1:18:26] and accepting this Blood no matter what
[1:18:29] church you belong to and we believe that
[1:18:32] with all of our heart amen we still
[1:18:36] believe in
[1:18:38] screaming shouting and speaking in
[1:18:43] tongues say well we don't want that well
[1:18:46] that's the modern Church doesn't want
[1:18:48] that that's just identifies what church
[1:18:49] you're part
[1:18:53] of come on church we about have some
[1:18:55] meetings I get so tired of people say
[1:18:58] well it's just Pentecost no we've got a
[1:19:00] open book or something
[1:19:01] real we got something to shout about and
[1:19:05] not everybody's going to shout and run
[1:19:06] the aisles not everybody should but I
[1:19:09] tell you what if if there's something in
[1:19:10] your heart it begins to rejoice and
[1:19:12] bubble over because you feel the
[1:19:13] presence of God and you ought to be free
[1:19:15] to do what God has dictated for you to
[1:19:19] do we believe it'll be in
[1:19:22] order we still believe in church orders
[1:19:24] yeah but we still believe in screaming
[1:19:27] shouting and speaking in tongues yeah
[1:19:30] right you see brother Ben you still
[1:19:31] believe in tongues I thought you were
[1:19:32] against that no sir I believe in it I
[1:19:35] just believe it'll be in
[1:19:36] order and I'm not willing to negotiate a
[1:19:39] settlement say we got to be like
[1:19:40] Pentecost no we don't have to go back to
[1:19:43] Babylon we don't have to go back to
[1:19:44] confusion to have the presence of God in
[1:19:46] our midst we still
[1:19:48] believe that God's able to do what God
[1:19:51] does and we won't we won't sit here and
[1:19:54] try to Manu facture it we'll we'll just
[1:19:55] let God do what he
[1:19:57] does see we don't want to be identified
[1:20:00] with the modern Church do we he said the
[1:20:02] modern Church see if you say well I
[1:20:04] don't want any of that screaming and
[1:20:06] shouting and tongue speaking well then
[1:20:08] that means you agree with the modern
[1:20:10] church because the modern Church doesn't
[1:20:12] want any of these here screaming
[1:20:14] shouting tongue speaking acts 238 young
[1:20:16] and around her she don't want any them
[1:20:19] whooping and crying and screaming amen
[1:20:22] hallelujah said why such a child would
[1:20:24] it mean medely put her out of her
[1:20:26] denomination they had one like that in
[1:20:28] one of the churches why they throw her
[1:20:30] out right quick why you letting such
[1:20:32] stuff as this go along but you don't
[1:20:34] want none of them screaming hollering
[1:20:36] this is still a part of the message yeah
[1:20:38] blabbering acts 238 miserable creatures
[1:20:41] she thinks they are it would certainly
[1:20:42] embarrass her it would ruin her in her
[1:20:44] educated ethical scientific Society
[1:20:46] Church she belonged to here she can't
[1:20:48] have it so she don't want to be pregnant
[1:20:50] with the word because that's the only
[1:20:52] kind that the word can bring forth
[1:20:53] that's why some people are so scared of
[1:20:55] the moving of the presence of God
[1:20:56] they're so scared of the move of God
[1:20:58] because they're afraid of what it'll do
[1:21:00] to them and what it'll make them give
[1:21:03] up Sir because the presence of God does
[1:21:05] more than make you scream does more than
[1:21:08] make you shout but it'll make you
[1:21:10] live right are you with me now if it's
[1:21:13] received in the heart and not just on
[1:21:15] the emotions look he said that's the
[1:21:18] only she can't have it she don't want to
[1:21:19] be pregnant with the word because that's
[1:21:20] the only kind that the word can bring
[1:21:23] forth born of the spirit of God it has
[1:21:26] the spirit of God in it no intellectual
[1:21:27] Church joining and creedo bobbed hair
[1:21:30] painted face no such thing as that in
[1:21:32] all of it you don't find that in the
[1:21:33] word of God you find an
[1:21:35] oldfashioned you still believe in the
[1:21:37] oldtime
[1:21:38] religion right brother B we don't have a
[1:21:40] new religion he said we have an old case
[1:21:42] or new case of the old time religion
[1:21:45] because they were shouting even before
[1:21:48] time began in the mind of God we were
[1:21:51] shouting the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:21:54] yes
[1:21:55] and he said you don't find that in the
[1:21:56] word of God you find an oldfashioned
[1:21:58] Sanctified Sanctified that's the key to
[1:22:01] your screaming and you're shouting and
[1:22:03] you're running is to make sure you live
[1:22:05] just as high as you jump right he said
[1:22:08] we believe in oldfashioned Sanctified
[1:22:10] Holy Ghost filled child born in the
[1:22:11] spirit of God screaming hollering
[1:22:13] shouting praising God yes we still
[1:22:18] believe so well I don't see much of that
[1:22:20] don't change what you will what you
[1:22:23] negotiate don't don't start to negotiate
[1:22:25] it away hold out for the promises of
[1:22:28] God right that's why people end up in
[1:22:31] terrible situations where they try to
[1:22:33] make themselves believe that somehow God
[1:22:35] has spoken to them to go against the
[1:22:37] word it's because they've negotiated
[1:22:39] away the perfect will of God in their
[1:22:41] life we don't want to do
[1:22:43] that we want what God wants for
[1:22:48] us I've heard people say well brother
[1:22:50] brandom only preached that at brother
[1:22:51] Moore's Church to make the Pentecostals
[1:22:53] happy well what can you
[1:22:56] believe but you know what it is it's an
[1:22:58] attempt to
[1:23:01] negotiate huh but I want to be like
[1:23:03] Moses and S said let my people go and
[1:23:06] believe all the word not everybody's
[1:23:08] going to run do all speak with tongues
[1:23:10] no do all shout fact tongues is the
[1:23:12] least of the gifts do all do those
[1:23:14] things no but I still believe it's there
[1:23:16] all right I still believe it's part of
[1:23:17] the
[1:23:18] church huh how many are with me tonight
[1:23:22] we still believe in a total Deliverance
[1:23:25] a a blood that can cleanse from sin and
[1:23:27] take it away as far away as from the
[1:23:29] East to the
[1:23:30] West Amen brother Brandon preached this
[1:23:33] at Jeffersonville just in case you care
[1:23:35] where it was preached at he said today
[1:23:38] the scientific theory of the modern
[1:23:39] so-called religious groups has tried to
[1:23:41] prove that this blessed thing that we
[1:23:43] have called the holy spirit is only
[1:23:45] emotion see it just don't stand up
[1:23:47] according to their scientific theory he
[1:23:49] said I would like to ask them this what
[1:23:51] makes them change it's a good question
[1:23:53] isn't it what makes makes the drunker
[1:23:55] stop drinking what makes the prostitute
[1:23:57] cease her evil life what makes the
[1:23:59] cancer and the diseases depart from the
[1:24:01] people and the deaf dumb and blind and
[1:24:03] the dead to raise up explain that is
[1:24:06] that emotion it has emotion with it
[1:24:08] certainly anything that's alive has
[1:24:10] emotion anything that doesn't have
[1:24:11] emotion is dead excuse the expression he
[1:24:14] said I think we ought to bury some of
[1:24:15] our emotionless religion then because
[1:24:17] it's dead it has no emotion to it any
[1:24:20] religion has not emotion should be
[1:24:21] buried because it is emotional he said
[1:24:24] Jesus when he entered the city the
[1:24:26] children and all of them all of his
[1:24:27] friends crying hosan his friends were
[1:24:30] crying out all his enemies were crying
[1:24:33] out crucify him but his friends Cried
[1:24:35] Out
[1:24:37] hosan Hallelujah I want to be one of his
[1:24:39] friends don't you don't you want to be a
[1:24:41] friend of God Amen he said if they hold
[1:24:43] their peace he said those religionists
[1:24:45] of that day couldn't stand it was too
[1:24:47] emotional he said if they hold their
[1:24:48] peace the rocks will immediately cry out
[1:24:51] something must cry out because life was
[1:24:53] there oh I want life among us I want
[1:24:56] life among us I've told people before I
[1:24:58] I I don't want I don't want over
[1:25:00] emotionalism I don't want to see
[1:25:02] Pentecostalism run rampant but I'm
[1:25:04] scared to death of being dead all
[1:25:08] right there no life at all when there's
[1:25:11] a when there's emotion and and things
[1:25:13] happening in the church look it could be
[1:25:15] wrong it could be right but being Dead's
[1:25:18] never right all
[1:25:23] right right
[1:25:25] we still believe in Fellowship among
[1:25:26] Believers we're fixing to have some
[1:25:29] fellowship bunch of people coming I I
[1:25:31] just want that to increase brother Ben
[1:25:33] why do you want that for the size of the
[1:25:34] crowd no I want that
[1:25:37] because I realize how important it is
[1:25:40] for us for me and for you to fellowship
[1:25:43] with people we don't normally see that's
[1:25:46] right and you can't fellowship with
[1:25:48] people on Facebook not like you should I
[1:25:51] there's some amount of Fellowship there
[1:25:52] but not not real kindred Fellowship
[1:25:55] where you feel somebody's
[1:25:57] Spirit right and sometimes in coming
[1:26:00] together like this we break down walls
[1:26:02] and I've had people testify to me from
[1:26:04] other churches that come and said we've
[1:26:06] been told this about your church or
[1:26:07] we've been told this but we went there
[1:26:09] and we found that it was just you just
[1:26:10] wanted to serve the Lord and you wanted
[1:26:12] wanted people to be happy and you wanted
[1:26:14] to promote the message and that's what
[1:26:16] we want and so we find out we're not
[1:26:18] that
[1:26:19] different right we still believe in
[1:26:20] Fellowship yes we still believe in
[1:26:22] Hebrews 10:25 not forsaking the
[1:26:25] assembling of ourselves together
[1:26:28] together as the manner of some is but
[1:26:30] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:26:32] more you see the day approaching now it
[1:26:34] we've always limited that to one Church
[1:26:37] in my mind I've always limited that with
[1:26:39] not forsaking the assemblying ourselves
[1:26:40] together that means show up on Wednesday
[1:26:44] night right and that's the way we preach
[1:26:46] it a lot of times but Paul didn't limit
[1:26:48] it to one
[1:26:50] church he never said Let the church at
[1:26:53] Ephesus come together and let Let the
[1:26:54] church at at Corinthians come together
[1:26:56] and I'm sure they did whenever they
[1:26:58] could but he said not forsaking the
[1:27:00] assembling of
[1:27:01] ourselves and I take that to mean
[1:27:03] whoever
[1:27:05] can whoever is a Believer and has the
[1:27:08] ability to not everybody's able to come
[1:27:11] to a meeting so we'll have one here so
[1:27:13] some people can still participate in a
[1:27:15] meeting maybe you could never go to
[1:27:16] another state and participate in a
[1:27:18] meeting but you can participate in one
[1:27:20] here what is that Fellowship it helps
[1:27:23] you Heen
[1:27:25] listen Paul didn't limit it to one
[1:27:26] church and so I say when you have the
[1:27:28] opportunity assemble brother Brandon
[1:27:31] when he was at Tucson Tabernacle right
[1:27:32] towards the end of his life he talked
[1:27:34] about how he used to have to go to
[1:27:35] Jeffersonville and let everyone listen
[1:27:37] in on the telephone hookup I know
[1:27:39] they're promoting that today as as being
[1:27:41] the the end thing so well we've restored
[1:27:43] the telephone hookup and everybody just
[1:27:45] sits at home and listens to tapes but
[1:27:47] that's not what brother brandham said he
[1:27:49] he he said it used to be that you had to
[1:27:52] be spread out go listen to it he said'
[1:27:54] it used to be that we had to just have
[1:27:56] you in a telephone hookup he said 'well
[1:27:58] we don't have to do that no
[1:28:00] more God gives me a message I can walk
[1:28:03] right here to the pulpit and preach it
[1:28:05] and feel free to do it so brother br's
[1:28:07] elevating brother Perry's Church having
[1:28:10] an actual church over the telephone
[1:28:13] hookup yes sir right he said I can walk
[1:28:16] right here to the pulpit and preach it
[1:28:17] feel free to do it and I believe by that
[1:28:19] that God Almighty will bless you if you
[1:28:20] will just stand by this church now this
[1:28:23] group of people all right there's a
[1:28:25] blessing in that
[1:28:26] church if just stand by it you say well
[1:28:29] I don't understand everything that goes
[1:28:30] on just stand by it just stand by it you
[1:28:33] won't understand everything that goes on
[1:28:34] you may not agree with everything I
[1:28:36] preach but if I if if if you believe
[1:28:38] that God is here if you believe that
[1:28:40] we're preaching the word and you can
[1:28:42] take a little cherry out of it or a
[1:28:44] little pit out of it and spit that out
[1:28:46] but if you believe I'm preaching the
[1:28:47] word let's stand together let's stand
[1:28:49] for this church because it's more than
[1:28:52] me it's more than me it's people that
[1:28:55] have given their lives to see that Hardy
[1:28:57] Arkansas that there was a lighthouse in
[1:28:59] Hardy
[1:29:00] Arkansas
[1:29:01] right some of you have given your
[1:29:04] incomes and your lives and everything
[1:29:05] else over years to see that there was a
[1:29:08] church on this spot let's let's get our
[1:29:10] put our shoulder to the wheel get behind
[1:29:13] it he said let's speak not only that he
[1:29:16] said but let's go out and see if we
[1:29:18] can't get others to come in let's speak
[1:29:21] to others everywhere speak to them about
[1:29:23] our church and what it means
[1:29:25] what our church he said we're here we
[1:29:26] want you to come bring in strangers I'm
[1:29:28] sure it'll be good for all of us see we
[1:29:30] have a building which we are thankful
[1:29:32] for we're thankful for this place GA
[1:29:34] together but the most high dwelleth not
[1:29:36] in temples made with hands for Heaven is
[1:29:38] my Throne Earth is my foot stol where is
[1:29:40] the place of my rest but a body hast
[1:29:42] thou prepared me and we are a body of
[1:29:44] Christ so as we move from one building
[1:29:47] to another building now if you know
[1:29:50] anything about the history of the
[1:29:51] message what's happened buildings have
[1:29:53] sprung up people sprung up different
[1:29:55] places different groups different bodies
[1:29:57] of Believers he said we moved from one
[1:30:00] building to another building I believe
[1:30:02] in bringing our messages he didn't say
[1:30:04] just my messages he said our messages
[1:30:06] we'll come down and have healing
[1:30:08] services and anything the Lord reveals
[1:30:10] to us to do we'll have it right here in
[1:30:13] the church until it swells out so big
[1:30:15] you'll have to take it somewhere else
[1:30:18] and somewhere else until Jesus comes I
[1:30:21] say let's let's let's believe what a
[1:30:23] prophet said let's fellowship with
[1:30:25] everybody we can fellowship with there's
[1:30:28] plenty that we can't right two can't
[1:30:30] walk together unless they be agreed but
[1:30:32] let's make sure that what we're
[1:30:34] disagreeing on is actually
[1:30:40] important my grandpa used to say we
[1:30:42] can't all be right but we could all be
[1:30:46] wrong a lot of Truth to
[1:30:48] that see Jesus is
[1:30:51] here do we believe that tonight I'm
[1:30:53] closing in just a
[1:30:56] moment a lot of folks we want to try to
[1:30:58] have a prayer line this year and we we
[1:30:59] will if we have
[1:31:01] room a purpose to do that if we just
[1:31:03] have the room to be able to do it but I
[1:31:06] guarantee you all these folks who don't
[1:31:08] believe in prayer lines if brother
[1:31:09] brandom come back and stood here every
[1:31:11] one of them would have a prayer
[1:31:13] line right you think they'd keep brother
[1:31:15] brandom from having a prayer line in
[1:31:16] their Church oh we don't believe in
[1:31:19] prayer lines until brother brandom comes
[1:31:21] back right and then some of them aren't
[1:31:23] they're not return Ministry people but
[1:31:25] if brother Brandon was standing there
[1:31:26] they would have prayer
[1:31:28] lines well don't we believe Jesus is
[1:31:30] still
[1:31:33] here he's still here so he still works
[1:31:36] in prayer lines he still works by the
[1:31:37] preaching of the word he's still heals
[1:31:40] he never left oh my and what I want to
[1:31:43] do I I want to stand for a total
[1:31:46] Deliverance for a complete deliverance
[1:31:48] until we as message people start to act
[1:31:50] like children of God until being message
[1:31:53] people is not a pejorative
[1:31:55] anymore are you with me now let the
[1:31:58] world call us what they want to but the
[1:32:00] fact that we're message people I think
[1:32:02] there ought to be something in us that
[1:32:04] yeah I I identify with that that's not a
[1:32:07] bad thing I believe it's a good thing
[1:32:08] you say Well it hasn't been well let's
[1:32:10] change that then let's let's stand for a
[1:32:13] total Deliverance a complete belief in
[1:32:16] the message of the hour
[1:32:19] amen what are you going to do he said
[1:32:21] when you get all that group together
[1:32:24] right where the Revelation is perfectly
[1:32:27] in Harmony and God expressing it through
[1:32:30] his word by the same actions the same
[1:32:32] things that he did making the word
[1:32:33] manifest that's what Moses stood for he
[1:32:35] said I want all the group together not
[1:32:38] one hoof to be left behind and brother
[1:32:41] BR said what are you going to do when
[1:32:42] you get all that group together yes oh
[1:32:46] if the church only knew its
[1:32:49] position it will one day then the rap
[1:32:53] Rapture will go when it knows what it is
[1:32:56] we put a lot of work into this meeting I
[1:32:58] tell you what I hope we don't have to
[1:32:59] have it I hope the Rapture comes
[1:33:04] before but if it don't we'll gather on
[1:33:07] Sunday for another taste of heaven and
[1:33:10] Sunday night for another taste to heaven
[1:33:11] and next Thursday for another taste to
[1:33:13] heaven with a few more Believers we may
[1:33:16] not be able to bring the bride together
[1:33:18] around the world we can do our part in
[1:33:20] our area to see a total Deliverance
[1:33:23] we don't want to leave one
[1:33:25] behind we don't want to compromise on
[1:33:27] any promise of the word let's believe
[1:33:30] for a total deliverance we still believe
[1:33:32] musicians go ahead and come we still
[1:33:34] believe in eating the entire
[1:33:36] book what did he say in Revelation 108
[1:33:39] after the seventh angel had come with
[1:33:41] his message the mystery of God had been
[1:33:43] finished he said the voice which I heard
[1:33:44] from Heaven spake unto me again and said
[1:33:47] go take the little book which is open in
[1:33:50] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:33:52] upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:33:54] brother brand said that word has to come
[1:33:56] to pass it's God's word that's what
[1:33:58] Moses felt when he stood there he wasn't
[1:34:00] just going on what had happened recently
[1:34:02] although that had changed him and made
[1:34:04] him able to stand there it he had to
[1:34:06] have a burning bush experience but he
[1:34:08] wasn't only looking at that he was
[1:34:09] looking at what God had promised God
[1:34:12] promised him that after 400 years they
[1:34:14] would be delivered he said that word has
[1:34:17] to come to pass it's God's word plant it
[1:34:19] in your heart if you want to go in a
[1:34:21] Rapture how many want to go in a rapture
[1:34:23] I know that we all do plant it in your
[1:34:26] heart if you want to be Christians
[1:34:28] genuine place this word you said I I
[1:34:32] believe it was Ezekiel God said take
[1:34:33] that scroll and eat it up that the
[1:34:35] prophet and the word would become the
[1:34:37] same and every promise in there has to
[1:34:40] manifest itself because it's God's
[1:34:42] original seed I say let's stand for a
[1:34:46] total
[1:34:47] Deliverance let's if we stand before
[1:34:49] let's stand together if we stand before
[1:34:51] Pharaoh let's stand for a total
[1:34:53] Deliverance
[1:34:54] I will not accept a partial Revelation I
[1:34:59] believe in the opening of the word I
[1:35:01] will not accept a partial healing I
[1:35:04] believe a Rapture is coming I will not
[1:35:07] accept just a partial deliverance from
[1:35:10] denominationalism I believe in a
[1:35:12] complete total Deliverance by the
[1:35:14] message of the hour let me stand for
[1:35:16] that you young people stand for that
[1:35:19] you've got an experience with God some
[1:35:20] of you older young people I know you've
[1:35:22] had an experience with God God you stand
[1:35:24] for that don't let the devil talk you
[1:35:27] out of what you got you stand for if you
[1:35:29] have to stand by yourself you stand for
[1:35:31] it till Mom and Dad catch on fire stand
[1:35:34] for it till the church around you

[1:35:37] It Believe in a total Deliverance if it
[1:35:40] doesn't happen in my generation it'll
[1:35:42] happen in your generation or it'll
[1:35:44] happen in the next Generation but
[1:35:45] there's coming a day when we will not
[1:35:47] all sleep but we will all be changed in
[1:35:49] a moment in a twinkling of an eye let's
[1:35:51] stand Before the Throne of pharaoh the
[1:35:53] God of this evil age and say I will not
