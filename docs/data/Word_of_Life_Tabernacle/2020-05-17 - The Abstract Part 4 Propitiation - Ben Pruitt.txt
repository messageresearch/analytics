but you know we believe that no matter what happens we're in God's hands and so we're thankful for that today and for those of you that are watching and couldn't be here as well thank you for watching it it's good to see all of you back it brother Frank good to see you your family this morning and each one of you I am I just want to I want you to feel like family I feel like we should you know when we get to heaven we're going to spend a lot of time around each other I think there'll be something special with a mic about those that we knew those who we've spent time with while we were here we saw each other struggles we knew what each what we went through and I came through Laodicean you come through Laodicea there'll be something special about that will be raised even with our own generation with those people that we've known when we see our loved ones we'll see somebody we knew and that's so grateful I'm so grateful for that that I'll be there with you and I'm thankful for that today so we ought to feel like family here and when we come together in the house of the Lord it's so wonderful god bless you turn with me if you would to revelations chapter 5 verse 6 we'll go ahead and read this morning [Music] revelations five and six will also read from first John chapter two and verse two thank you for the music this morning I appreciated sister Alison's song this morning little by little and that song means a lot to me I we should not get discouraged we should remember the miracles it's easy as you're going through the wilderness to be sidetracked by the the Baroness of the place and and and the struggles that you go through just to get water and you know like the children of Israel but they begin to murmur and complain but they had an atonement they had a brass serpent brother Allen spoke so wonderfully on that Wednesday night and if you can get a chance to hear that sermon go back and listen to it it's it's it's wonderful to know that we have a God who's real and and provided an atonement it goes right with what we're going to talk about this morning and so don't be discouraged God's doing things and we've seem doing things in spite of the difficulty he's still moving he's still living he's still the same yesterday today and forever that's not conditioned on how we act or how everybody else acts or the condition of the world it's him he's the same and he if he's the same he can meet our needs this morning and I believe that he will continue to keep in mind that the meetings coming up this weekend about the IV's I'm gonna go and except for Sunday morning we'll have our regular service here but brother Andrew Glover will be there and by the Windell Martin so if you get a chance to go I'm sure they would appreciate it and and it would be a good meeting and get to hear the word of the Lord revelations five and six and I beheld in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and then first John - and - and he is he is say that with me this morning he is the propitiation for our sins not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world let's bow our heads together for a word of Prayer if you have a need you'd like to make known but wave uplifted hand this morning I'm sure God sees those needs Heavenly Father as we come and many have raised their hands Lord with needs today I pray God that you would just move on every heart whatever they thought that they had when they raised that hand father there's something that they need from you I pray God that you would meet that need today father we know that you're a healer we know that you're a miracle worker we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and so we ask you Lord to come and just meet all of our needs and bind us closer together as a family of God Lord may we recognize that each one of us is important in the house of the Lord I pray that you would just move as we settle into the word now it may you cause it to come forth and clarity Lord and without without the ideas of a man but maybe your word today maybe we understand these things though it may seem like we're repeating ourselves over and over but we just want to drive it home Lord how much that you mean to us and what our salvation is and what redemption is and so I pray that you just meet us here today and meet every one of these needs and we'll give you the glory and the honor for it in Jesus name Amen amen god bless you you could be seated this morning we found out that God was the original owner of the title deed to the earth which also is the title deed to our Redemption so it's personal to us the book is a book that we have an interest in and our name is there and so we found out that he was the original owner and that means that if we came from God we can go back to God we could say that a little more clearly if we came from God we will go back to God and we found out that Adam forfeited the title deed to the earth when he walked out with his wife with Eve and so they thought that couple when they left it was a forfeiture and so we looked through and like an abstract that as we turned the page we found that there was loss of title and but yet it couldn't go back to Satan but it had to go back into the hands of the original owner and so God had it in his hand and then so we found out that that meant that it was redeemable and we also found out that it was to come through the line of motherhood that that was to produce a redeemer as we continue this morning examining this abstract we find that a price must be paid to redeem what Adam lost so one of the things that had to be one of the requirements for redeemer is he had to be able to pay the price he had to be able to do it not only just worthy but he had to be able to meet whatever the requirement was and so what Adam lost had to be redeemed and what Adam lost was his position he lost his position also his fellowship he also lost his right to eternal life so these things needed to be restored to us and in the Bible the concept of the price that needed to be paid to appease the wrath of God is called propitiation propitiation it is an old English word that comes from a Greek word alas tree on which means sacrifice of atonement it speaks a propitiation and the idea of sin being done away with it's called expiation I know there's a lot of big words but I had to look them up too so but expiation of sin being cleared away being done away with but propitiation is more than that it's also the removal of God's wrath towards the sinner that God was was angry if we could put it in human terms like God maybe he doesn't get angry like we do but he was he was anger as sin and so he crossed God we God was we could call him the offended party and this is a legal term that propitiation is satisfying the demands of the party that's been offended right and so someone had to make those demands and that was God and this word also speaks of the Hebrew word for mercy seat that that was the profession in the Old Testament so it's the price paid to appease the anger of God but not only that to bring us back in fellowship with God so it's not just to make it where he's okay but to actually bring back that relationship with him again like Adam had in the garden and that's what we want we don't want just our sins covered or well our our sins have been forgiven but we want to please God right we want to please God if we want to please God why do we want to please God because we're his family right we're his family we want to please him we want to be able for the j.t to be near him and and him have the right attitude towards us and and in order to do that we would have to satisfy this terrible gulf this thing that had happened with Adams race now if you were driving in a car you had a passenger in the backseat and you were driving dangerously and you hit a tree and you damaged that person and you would not only hurt that person but you would perhaps hurt that relationship because if you were if you hit a tree and and then that person said well why were you driving that way why did you do that you knew better than to do that you did it anyway so there's been a loss of of your status with them so there's physical damages that would need to be paid but also in order to gain back that relationship you would need to satisfy the John everything they required and it wouldn't be up to you and be up to them right and so it wouldn't be me saying well I'll tell you what I'll give you $100 and you go on no you need to satisfy them somehow they need to be satisfied that it's okay that you made up for this oh my we couldn't do that on our own and if there's anything I want to get to you through these series of messages that said we could not appease God's wrath we couldn't meet God where he was but only about a blood of Jesus Christ and so you can't do it by legalism or by by thinking that well I'll do enough work so I'll be a message person or born in a message family or be a message believer and that will appease God it does not if he's gone but it's only by his sacrifice now so the perpetuation would be the amount paid to satisfy the amount they were required to satisfy the anger of the offended party and restore the relationship so if you take it back to the Old Testament it'd be like the Avenger of blood as they would come out if you'd accidentally killed someone or just by your negligence you'd killed someone a member of their family would be coming after you because it was eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth so they would be coming after you and they'd walk but in return and so what you would need is something that would satisfy them that would make it where they did not require that what would it take and and see God being just once he has required something he can't just lower the requirement right because if he if he did that then the requirement wasn't right in the first place see if I lower the penalty for crime it means that the penalty was too strict to begin with right but now he can't lower the penalty what does he do but he meets the payment he makes the payment so I want you to understand this morning that he who has offended sets the terms for the propitiation now that would help us a lot in our friendships and getting along with people by the way that if you do something to someone then you can't just sit there and say well now I'll make the terms of getting us getting back together No you've got to accept that you to be a friend you've got to be friendly right and so you've got to kind of accept their whatever they're willing to take if that makes sense within reason right but but yet there's there's part of you if you really want to be their friend and that's true of marriage is wealth you really want to stay together there's times you're gonna have to move a long ways from where you are to do that you've got to make a lot of sacrifices because you've got to satisfy the offended party it's not not up to you it's when they're satisfied of Genesis 2:16 says the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it from the day that thou eatest serve thou so surely died so he's saying that here he's saying here's what you could do to offend me here's what you could do to break the contract here's the only thing that you could do I'm giving you a perfect place I'm putting a perfect way before you but here the Joe's the only thing you could do to mess it up and guess what we did it and then that the way it usually goes with our lives that it seems like that if there's one thing that we can do to mess it up we do that and so they did that and it was an offense to God and if we could put it again in human terms realizing that God does it doesn't think like we do but but if we could put it in humans terms it's human terms that says this God has offended and so it's attitude towards mankind to change because you cannot let them inherit eternal life anymore you cannot let them stay in the Garden of Eden and so we find that we become offensive to God in that way because of sin and as human beings and I'm not talking about you as a predestinated seed of God but I'm talking about you as a human being as a human being you're born offensive to God and David realizes that because when he said and did what he did he said a gift see and the only have I sent now when we think in natural relationships brother Brown said you need to apologize to her because it's her you you did the wrong against but but in this case David realizes that ultimately to restore his fellowship with God he's got to make it right with God and in ultimately you know people can say what they want to and people will say what they want to and people will talk I don't understand that I don't understand I was speaking with someone here Friday and I don't understand people that don't want to see the best in someone I just don't can't comprehend people that don't want to see good in somebody I don't want to hope that they'll get better why would you ever want to throw somebody down on the pit and keep knocking him back down it doesn't make sense and it's not the Spirit of Christ but David realizes in order to be right he said it gives seeing the only have I sinned he sinned against your eyes sinned against bad she big sinned against the nation but he said against seeing the only have I sinned and done this evil in that sight that that might has to be justified when thou speakest and be clear when the judges he said Lord it's me I'm not going to make a defense I'm not gonna say it's me and I end but he goes even further he said behold I was shapen in iniquity so it's not just that I did what I did but I come into the world speaking rise in sin did my mother conceive me so God you are offended with me before time McGee but when I was born at the moment that I was born you were offended because you were offended with what Adam did what Eve did and I was identified with that you see we begin to sin before we even know how a child who has the Ricci age of accountability might may not be accountable for their actions but they're still sinners and the fact that they go to heaven as the baby for baby dies it goes to heaven but the round taught us that but it's the fact that if it does it goes to heaven is because of the blood of Jesus Christ it's because if it's more than just born in this world it's a sinner they're still sinners they need a propitiation they need somebody to meet that that debt but the random talks about a he said some time ago a chaplain told me he found a man laying on the field an officer and he'd been machine gun across his chest he was dying he said captain you're dying and through the struggles he said I know I am he said do you know God he said I used to he said well go back to where you left him go back to where you left him and there you'll find him again that'd be something for us wouldn't it you've got to go back where you left him so many people can't come back to God because they don't want to go back that far he said go back to where you left him and there you'll find him again and the captain dying said I just can't think right now the chaplain said you better think for your lungs were fastly filling with your own blood and you're dying captain they begin to try to think after a while a smile come over his face he said old chaplain I remember now where I left him I remember now where I left him he said start from right there captain he said all right chaplain he raised his highest or heaven he started like this now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep and if I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take and he died where did he leave him at the cradle that's where he found him at the cradle he hadn't even thought of God in between the time but he had to go back where he left him so wherever you leave him that's where you'll find him listen to this he will never walk in sin with you he will never walk in sin with you you might be a good American or a good church member but God will never walk in sin with any person or any nation people ready for this nation to come back and be prosperous and be great again God will never walk in sin with any nation or any Church he cannot tolerate sin it's an evil horrible stink in his nostrils he will not do it and no amount of personal holiness that you could do no amount of I'm living around doing I'm doing everything just the way I'm supposed to I got my long sleeves from along here and everything's just right no amount of that but a gypsy could ever redeem you and bring you back to where you can have these rights to this title again but it takes a man it takes a profession that God makes Genesis 3:23 says therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man the same man that he went to sought out that God sought out in the cool of the evening the same one who he looked for brother Joe to have fellowship with him he looked for him he said I want to I want to be with you I want to I want to spend time with you in the cool of evening that same God now after the chasm has been breached after the sin has been committed he drives him from the garden he placed at the east of the Garden of the Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life but the RAM said that tree of life in the Garden of Eden which could not be approached - because of the fall of Adam I love this is now given to the overcomer 3bet he said to the overcomer in the efficient church age I'll give the Tree of Life amen and so they sound given to the overcomer he said the flaming sword of the guarding cherubim has been sheathed but it was not sheath Eric's blood was bloody its blade was bloody with the blood of the Lamb and so we have a world today that's relying the church world today is relying upon the death of Christ as we are but not recognizing you're realizing that you've got to come under that blood you've got to come in to that word you've got to come in to that that body because if you don't you'll find yourself actually rejecting the very sacrifice that you need and so the world relies on that it's as well God loves me or he wouldn't have died for me and it's true but it's only those who accept him see you've got to accept what he did and walk in him and that sounds pretty simple and but you see so many people today and I think in message circles we don't understand like we should because so many people come to God like I'm a beggar and and I realized that we should come to God desperately but desperate for what purpose desperate to do away with this desperate for the flesh to be killed that's what waved the way we come to God we don't come to God desperate for God to move because he is moving he is moving he's the atonements already been made healing is already ours what are we just before it's not to pull God down as a Pentecostal Church would to try to work something up until God would come down but it's actually to meet God where he has already come to we're meeting God in that place where he already is Oh church and he's sitting there waiting for you this morning if you left him come back where you left him you can't come back to what people want you to be or want you to do you come back to his requirements so they left the garden with the propitiation of the lambs blood he he saw them leaving in the heart of God but the brendham talks about that how that the heart of God wouldn't let him stay that way so he had to make a provision and God's anger would be satisfied for a season by the blood of the Lamb but it could not restore seller's now but God did not just leave it like that but he said there will be one who had bruised the head of the serpent who would satisfy the wrath of God and this is the propitiation in Hebrews 11 and 4 it says my faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and we have no record that Abel and Cain lived any differently before that other than that one kept the garden and one kept the Sheep right and so other than that we have no record that they were almost in sin and the other one wasn't one went out and party to say I came went out to the bar and on Saturday night and then come to church Cain was religious he was religious he'd come to church this i cabled it he acted just like Abel did he had all the fundamentals just like Abel did but Abel by revelation it was just something in him that knew that God required something more than just good works he required something more than flowers he required something more than fruit he required something more he required blood because it was the blood that got messed up and so he required blood now you acquired the life now it says that God testifying of his gifts so hey boy what your brain satisfies me it pleases me and the Bible says that God accepted his offering and he rejected Cain's and Cain understood he was close enough to under two God to understand that he was rejected and many people aren't even aren't even able to do that today they don't understand they come and offering their deceit but Cain knew that there was a difference between him and Abel he knew that the sacrifices were different and it made him angry changed his countenance why because God was not pleased with him now but the Bible says seeing that the two boys trying to find favor with God to come back and that's what we want this morning we won't favor with God that's why we all come but there could be two people come both of them won't favor with God but one of them comes under the blood one does not who finds favor with God only the one who comes under the blood you know I can't come under my own merits I've got to come under the blood so now he said the two boys trying to find favor with God to come back because they knew they were just as fresh just fresh from the garden of life and they had fell on the other side by the transgression of their parents and made them subject to death just like we all stand this morning subjects to death and they wanted to know how to get back into that place where they could find life again and in doing so they were trying to find favor with God and Cain offered a beautiful sacrifice the flowers and the fruits of the field or whatever it was he put on the altar but Abel by spiritual revelation revealed to him that it was not the fruit of the field that caused the death it was blood that caused the death so he offered back blood of an innocent substitute and God accepted it and that has been God's propitiation for our sins ever since that very day no other way because if he had accepted on any other basis then we'd have had to come to that basis to find favor with god but God accepted only the innocent blood of an innocent subject I like this he said therefore if the beauty and the big places would have been God's acceptance today we'd have wondered would he come back on the backside of the desert to this little home sitting here by the railroad track we could put ourselves in there if it had been big places that God accepted what do you have come to Hardy Arkansas would he have come to this little church would Eve come to us who were lost in sins and trespasses would he have come to us who had no education or nothing that the world could speak of what do you come to us on the backside of the desert will he come back here and meet with us but if it had been a great Cathedral or the beauty that Cain offered why we'd find we've just been talking to ourselves and to the air but God came on the basis of the shed blood so no matter today how small we are how poor we are how much we would like to be offered a God a greater place but God wouldn't accept it no more than he will right now because we're coming on the basis of the shed blood of an innocent substitute with just Christ dying for us sinners hey man you can't get the gospel much clearer than that Romans 3:23 for all have sinned it doesn't say all will sin all have sinned and come short of the glory of God he said that's Baptist theology no that's the Bible right it's not bad discuss the Bible being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God so it was just the forbearance of God that was working in the Old Testament the forbearance of God still works today it still works with those who are not saved it worked with us before we were saved the forbearance of God God didn't judge us like we were aren't you glad he didn't but he saw there was something else he knew there was something else on the inside too by his for now he predestinated us and and so we were the seed of God but you could say even the world benefits from the forbearance of God and God is long-suffering and today people don't want to think about God being angry with them they don't want to think about God actually actually having a an attitude towards them that sin is wrong but yet you don't understand that without it if God is only a God of love I read something the other day where I said my God is not like your God my God is all love well my God is all love too but he's also a God of justice and so to be God at all he has to be a righteous God he got to be perfect to be God right and so in order to be a righteous God it means that he still has wrath if we could put it again in human terms he still has anger and we find that the vials of Revelation is worse we find that that's the wrath of God poured out on the earth now look all that time he stores it up he waits he for bears and he lets people live unless people go about their business and people think that because I'm ok well I went out and many times young people make that mistake they leave church and they go out for a while and they begin to ask the more they do they realize well God's okay with that I haven't been judged and so maybe I'll start doing something I didn't used to do and they go a little further and they go a little further and pretty soon they get into something that well God forgives me God loves me I can still go to church but you don't realize that it's the forbearance of God it's because God loves you then he doesn't strike you but he won't strike you because there come there's coming a day for judgment there's coming a day when the forbearance of God will be lifted there's coming a day for those things to take place you know people can wish something bad on somebody who did something evil to them I don't ever wish that because if you're evil to me I want you to be saved I want you to be changed because there's not a person on this earth that I want to go through the tribulation period and people if you think we're already in the period people don't understand it's a whole lot worse than this we see how the world was disrupted by one virus think about what's gonna happen when the wrath of God is poured out we see what happened in the first world war in the Second World War in the tragedy that happened during that time think what's going to happen beyond mercy this is during mercy this is during the forbearance of God when in the first world war even instructed the Angels hold back the winds don't destroy the earth at this time with those chemical gases and things that they end up science that unleashed on the earth don't destroy the Earth's at this time what was it ghost forbearance but he's made a propitiation a way to satisfy his wrath its judgment but they're coming today when the propitiation will be pulled back there'll be no more offering for sin there'll be no more sacrifices of mercy to become brass and then all the sudden it becomes a judgement seat and when it does there's no more mercy and we'll have to be gone because we need mercy are you with me now to declare his righteousness and righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare us at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded it is excluded well you don't understand the family I belong to it is excluded you don't understand what my church and how how many generations we've been in the message and how long we've known about these things it is excluded where is boasting every one of us has to come into the same shed blood many times I've seen our brother in Africa that they begin to think well I need to find some brother in America that I can be like it and be like them and make our church like theirs and then we can we can sit under them and it's fine to have examples to go by but many times they and I found myself preaching over and over to them you're under the same blood that I'm you share the same Redemption that I share there's no difference the message come in my language but you can receive the same Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost didn't come in my language but the message come in my language and then saw I think we ought to be a help anytime we can but the Holy Ghost come and it made them speaking they're here in their own language hey Ben amen so where is boasting boasting is excluded it's excluded I know I'm kind of bearing down on that this morning but I just feel that that we need to understand that I'm not just us but just and how we deal with people boasting is excluded well I've been able to live this way all of my life and do these things boasting is excluded if you've been able to live that way it's because God let you live that way God maybe give you good parents and gave you a good life and a good home to grow up in thank God for that boasting is excluded by what law of works name but by the law of faith therefore he says we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law now brother Branham says this and I've seen this so many times and sometimes it it's me as well that begin to pray in a way that it says if God you need to heal me God I need to be forgiven I had someone come one time and a young person in a prayer line and tell me that she said I just want God to forgive me and instead of praying for immediately I said you know God has forgiven you he made a way you just have to come to it and so it seemed people to pray and pray and pray for God to forgive them but God has forgiven he has made away he's made a propitiation that's what perpetuation is all about I just have to accept it at his terms right he's the one that signed the letter he saw on that that made the deal have you ever been involved in the legal system he's the one he's the one that made the deal he said you can go Frank he said you can be justified he said it'll be as though you never did it in the first place but you've got to brother Caleb accept that deal and when you accept it you abide by the terms of it Oh hope you're with me now when you accept it you abide by the terms out what is that repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost now look he said it remember those people goes around saying I got power to heal you that guy is telling you a lie he has no power to heal you Christ has already done it he said oh by confession of sins and so forth some priests being Minister forgiving your sins no sir your sins are already forgiven when Christ died on the cross he said it is finished what the complete plan everything Christ get it at the cross he said you're already saved every sinner saved I think about potentially every sinner saved if they'll accept it but there's got to be something in you to accept it every sinner saved but it'll never do you any good until you accept it he said you get down there at the altar and scream and cried you get gray-headed and your hairs fall out that's already happened to me so crying - you get great headed and your hair's fine it'll never do any good until you believe it's not the length of time you spend at the altar and people misunderstand I've said this before but that you don't come to the altar for that reason to get anything you come to the altar to give something you come to the altar to give up yourself you come to the altar I believe in an altar call I believe in God moving in that way but you come to the altar for that purpose to give up yourself even when you have a little hands laid on you you wouldn't have to have that to be healed but the reason you come is because you're coming in obedience to God's Word they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so in all you're surrendering yourself to the Word of God and you're just coming and letting allowing yourself to come in that path and God heals you I read an article today and that's not just limited to message believers I read an article this morning about how the science has and peer-reviewed medical study said if the hands are laid on someone in the name of Jesus Christ that healing takes place they prove that it's true if we could just believe that today people just come according to according to God's Word not even message believers or anything that I know I but they come that way and they did a study in Africa if those people went hands were later on deaf and dumb people actually begin to receive their begin to receive the ability to talk and the ability to hear after hands were later on my it's faith they believe what God said so it's not just limited to us but if we can believe that today we could believe I'm coming God according to your word I'm not just coming as because it's something that I can do but I'm coming because I'm surrendering myself to you I'm not coming necessary to get but to give to give myself away so that I can be you can move through my life see he said it'll never do any good to you except in you you can get down there at the altar and scream Christ you get gray-headed and your hairs fall out it'll never do it any good until you believe believe that Christ died in your step and he died a propitiation for your sins when you accept him as your Savior then salvation comes to you same thing by healing he was wounded for our transgressions with His stripes we are healed now when you come and you accept that propitiation there's some effects go with that there's an effective propitiation so it's not it doesn't happen in a vacuum right if you accepted that legal document that legal term this is what God's requiring for Proficient to bring me back into fellowship then then I'm bound to that and as a Christian we become a low slave to Christ and that means that we accept all of the work and that's how you know if someone's truly come to Christ and accepted the perpetuation because they'll follow all of the work that make a mistake they'll come right back and follow the work now when you accept the appreciation it does not simply expiate as we said you're saying or do away with it but it brings you back in fellowship that's in effect a propitiation and brother branham explained it this way said now the sale of the spirit life lays in the blood and when the blood cell of a lamb or an animal was broken the life that was in that cell could not come back upon the worshipper because it was an animal and we are a human being we are different the animal doesn't have a soul it's hard to tell some people that you know my kids love animals it's a good thing the mammals don't have a soul all them fish they play with while I'm fishing and kill that did be in trouble for that but the human being has a soul the spirit could not come back on the animal God's Spirit could not come back that turtle is never gonna be saved Esther the animal doesn't have a soul the spirit could not come back on him after he made his offering but yet he made it now he's talking in the Old Testament the worshiper would come and kill the animal and the life of the animal could not come back on the worshiper he made his offering he said and sincerely speaking with faith that he believed that perfect offering was coming but when the blood cell was broken Jesus Christ God was released well however you can't put it much simpler than that can you when the blood cell was broken in Jesus Christ God was released see he was caught that blood wasn't Jewish that blood wasn't Gentile that was a creative blood cell God himself hey man it's amazing that people could teach otherwise teaching the message because it's amazing to me because brother Branham deals with this I'm not purposely dealing with the Godhead but you deal with it almost every week you just have to read a few quotes you're gonna find what brother Branham talks about God Jesus being God it doesn't take long right he said God was really see he was gone that blood wasn't Jewish that blood wasn't Gentiles created blood so God himself he said announcer that blood making a propitiation for our sins cleanse us the believer takes all of his sins away from him as if he had never sent hey bad well I'm so grateful for that God puts him in the sea of forgetfulness now someone said he put a sign up and said no fishing no fishing in the sea of forgetfulness you're not allowed to go back and bring it up Bible says it this way who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifies we're not allowed to go back and bring it up God God puts it in the sea of forgetfulness hey bad God lets him to see if forgetfulness and the same God that was upon Jesus Christ continues in the believer doing the same works that he did here for it's the same spirit so now this is the effect of propitiation it's not just doesn't just happen in a vacuum it's not just well I come and accepted Christ and now I'm able to live any way I want to but it's his spirit comes back on me when I am saved then I become a part of God in the sense that his Spirit comes on me I have a measure of the same God that he is in his fullness God puts my sins and the sea of his forgetfulness in the same God that was upon Jesus Christ continues in the believer doing the same works that he did here it's the same spirit but I want to tell you Church and just to kind of kind of walk through this for a moment and we're plenty early and we have some time but I want to tell you that a lot of times we look for big things and and just speaking from experience that I have and some of you have much more experience than I do but many times it's not the people who have the greatest experiences with God that lasts but it's people who come to God sanely and realizing what they're doing they come to God and give themselves to Christ and and maybe you never really see anything other than their life changed and I've told you before but one of the greatest testimonies I ever heard of by the JT's stepson that that told me that he said he said you know he said I was there he said when Dad I'm a Christian this is many years ago now and he was helping me move up here in West Plains and he's told me I said I haven't seen you at church lately and I was hoping that you'd come back and he said well you know he said I don't want to be a I'd only be fake he said don't want to be a hypocrite and I said brother we all are at some point we've got to come in an atmosphere we can come back to God and Steve said but but brother JT is he said when he called him dad he said when dad when dad got saved he said I knew it he said he quit drinking he quit doing what he was doing he was a different person what a testimony for a young person to bring we got saved something changes and now that's the struggle for some of us because the JT some of us were born in the message dad didn't let me drink I wasn't allowed to smoke and and I was raised very strict and so I wasn't I didn't go out and do those things I never developed a taste for those things I still needed to be saved I still needed an experience with God but sometimes we don't have that clarity of one and it becomes a mental battle that Satan uses against you because you just you don't have that or maybe been a Christian for a long time and you just seems like you're plotting you're just going along and see well I remember one time I was saved I was changed but now I just don't seem like anything's happening but what God does he does and ways many times we don't even understand and we find ourselves changed years later and look back and say I'm not the husband that I was not the father that I was I'm not the Christian that I was I've moved on God has grown me into what I am today and so that's another reason why we give everybody grace because you look at somebody say well they've never really had an experience with God like we have but give them grace that they can move on because there's still time left for them but I would tell you if you're purposely delaying coming to Christ don't wait because we're at the end but many times we can't tell him sister Bruce had an interview with brother Branham and she I'm glad that they kept this where we could read it because it's important that we understand that it's not always the big things and she says well I make so many mistakes and brother Branham says that's why Christ had to die so that you with your mistakes wouldn't be lauded to you he took your mistakes your desire and your hardest to serve him I don't know if I have as much faith brother Perry green he used to say that he would God would never allow him to meet a person that wasn't predestinated he said because God doesn't waste Peregrine's time well I'm not sure I have that much faith but the RAM talks about three kinds of believers but you know what there is the truth to the fact that God allows you to meet the people that you do for a reason there's a reason for that I don't want to believe that anybody is a seed of the devil I don't want to believe that you're going to hell I wanna believe you're going to heaven but I know to get there you've got to come God's provided way he said your your mistakes are not allowed to you he is your profession see he is your sin offering your sins are not known hey man you're not a sinner before God Christ took your sins and became you because your desire is to serve Him and sister bruce says but I've never had an experience that I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that I could put my foot on he said all right notice this ordinarily a human being is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that's the nature of a human being he said she said yes he said that was your nature it changed once what changed he says Christ there you are sister that's it I'm glad we had a prophet in this day I don't have to jump through hoops to do it I don't have to join a certain man's church to do it you don't have to come to this church to be saved that make God pretty small you don't have to come you don't have to live in Hardy to be a messege believer you you don't have to go anywhere else in the world to be a believer you don't have to go people say well come here this is where God is moving God can move where you are I believe we ought to have a home church and be where God is I think we ought to make every effort to be in church but that's not our relationship with God what changed us what were you what are you now see where I can look back and I see myself I start to come to the house of garden I don't I just don't want the things I used to want there you are keep walking don't stop don't stop there keep coming keep walking come closely well I just don't feel comfortable yet around God's people just keep coming come to church come to the house of God meet we'll come closer and closer until you can finally be saved until you can finally know it was an assurance that sometimes gotta let you have that experience that you'll know but keep coming don't walk back because of what you feel it's not about what you feel Romans 8:1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and then it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh so he's saying the flesh was the problem the law wasn't the problem the flesh was the problem right and Paul makes that very clear the law cannot save you and Paul says if you're married to the law you've got to the whole husband has to die before you can receive Christ Paul even said for those that were uncircumcised in Galatians for them to be circumcised to become a part of the body of Christ he said what's to do despite to grace it was it was to reject grace because the law cannot make you a Christian the law is good but it's good in the in the in its completeness and the Bible tells us clearly that no one no one except Christ as ever lived the law and if you're guilty of one letter of the law you're guilty of all of it and that's what makes no sense so I'm gonna keep part of the law well where's your sacrifice are you gonna go back under bulls and goats because if you come over into Christ then you sacrificing you're not under the law anymore but if you're gonna stay under the law you've got to have a sacrifice somewhere and what you're doing is trying to live alone without a sacrifice which makes it even harder a law which nobody lived anyway oh my now look what he says and it soaks on the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law now this for purposes the effects of propitiation that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit say well I want to know how to be a good Christian I want to know how to live for God walk in the spirit and that's not something mystical but that's something the Spirit will lead you to the word will lead you in the word Romans 8 and for that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit so it's very simple brother Brennan says by your desire you can tell who is on the throne room of your heart by your desire thank god there's a longing to come to the house of God thank God there's something in you that wants to be saved thank God there's something in you that wants to be healed there's something in you that a desire there I was talking to someone the other day brother Stewart in there she said that they wanted to be prayed for I said that's good because I remember one time stopping on the way somewhere and people didn't even want to be prayed for it there was an accident in the man was bleeding I said can I pray for you he said you can if you want to didn't even have a desire to be pray for him I prayed for him anyway but he just he took it us as an offense someone said I would pray for it thought Oh God but if someone wants to be prayed for at least said something but the man that makes the statement if you like gospel music good Christian music that's something what moved from there go forward there's got to be something a thirst in you that calls out for God hey man he said for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded his life in peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God is not subject to law neither indeed can be so then things that are in the flesh cannot please God and this is important because this is what this is what propitiation is is coming to a place where you can please God and they that are in the flesh cannot please God he said but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his hey Ben amen and in Christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you now he said therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh now remember Romans 8 comes after Romans 7 that's the most important thing you'll hear all day Romans 8 comes after Romans 7 coz if you go back and read Romans 7 he talks about the flesh about this war that's going on but there's a way to walk in the spirit aren't you glad he made away the effects of the privation it's that fellowship with God again so therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall his word if I means to kill dead Oh holiness folks you know I thought would preach heavy on that side and not so much on the grace of God but but they preached on the dying and they talked about how they've never seen a dead man steal watermelons and it's it's a simple illustration but you know there's there's a point you that old man has to die you've got to keep under your body as Paul said bring it under subjection so that control tower brother Brennan talked about kids control your body and you can walk in the spirit so he says as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God he didn't say as many as went to word of life Tabernacle he didn't say as many has heard a certain preacher he didn't say it's me as did this out of the other as many as there that for the spirit of god that maybe going to word of life's tabernacle that maybe where you go to church and what you doing all those things but it's also led by the spirit they're the sons of God for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear you've not given another law you've been not men made to walk back and go back under that law but you've been given receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father hey bad brother better says how does it do it some about the scripture he said you say glory to God hallelujah don't bother me I'm a child of God and go out and do the things you do he said the Spirit of God will do the works of God what is that the effects of propitiation he said the Spirit of God will do the works of God Jesus said neither believe it's on me the works that I do shall he do also and yet we see something more even than just living a life for God but we're going back into full Redemption so there had to be something come here at the end time and we'll talk more about that where he claims those names were in the book where there's a fullness of the word in this age that hasn't been another ancients because this is the age of for redemption this is the age of adoption if we can put it that way this is the age of the manifestation of the sons of God Romans 8 and 16 the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then were heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us I'm sorry there's so much reading but I I couldn't put this any better than Paul did so he said for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who subjected the same in hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit he goes in another place the earnest of our inheritance we who have the firstfruits of the Spirit wait groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body you can argue the first about where we're at in that process and what's all been done but listen we have the ability now to go all the way back we have the word to do that but look I'm not fully redeemed yet is this body still here and this isn't the condition I'm gonna be in I bet some of you ought to shout about that this is not the condition and I'm stuck it very bad I mean there may be something happen in your body but think you had a stroke some of y'all had different things physical problems in your body and there's been things that affects you maybe you can get over it and you can become get better but it's still there's something that hinders you it's an evil and your flesh old ages that it's as you get older you just begins to hinder you more and more but you're not stuck there amen because we won't all sleep but we'll all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump look he said Branson what's everything waiting on what's the whole creation waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God it's waiting for the church to become into its position who is the son of God when had him he said where was his domain the earth he had domain over the earth we live in Earth it's what these bodies are people want to be able to speak something I know that's been said before but they won't be able to speak things into existence I want to speak peace be still and let my mind stop and be able to sleep are you with me now I want to be able to speak to my own body and let things happen to where where you know what sometimes you worry about things and the more that you become responsible for the more you worry about that's just true you get when you're young you're pretty carefree and I see young people they stressed out I think just wait till you get a family but you have that third kid you know there that fourth one then you go to stress then you have a right - but see those are things that I want to be able to speak to that and say and realize that it doesn't mean no good and so I can speak to that I can have domain over that I can take every thought that exalts itself against Christ and bring it into captivity are you with me now I know we worry I worry but it doesn't mean I have to sometimes I get sick it doesn't mean I have to stay sick I can be healed because healing is already taking place I can be safe I can come back because we have a word today by which we can come and say Satan I have dominion over this earth you don't have a right to be on here we'll talk more about that squatter how Satan is a squatter on our land we'll talk more about that you take the abstract the finished work the finished product take it and prove to Satan and that the Holy Ghost drive him out why it belongs to us or we don't have to be stressed out all the time there's no reason to live in fear there's no reason to live under anxiety there's no reason to live under under that that'll us and punish us but there's got to be a time when we say Satan how I want you to leave you're out and then we have to believe that we have the authority to do it so we'll guy come and sit and we'll talk more about it but some guy come and sit in your place sit in your house you come home there's some old greasy guys sitting in your chair huh he's sitting down there and he's he's sitting there eating or whatever he's doing smoking and drinking in your house whatever he's doing like it was his what would you do sit down beside him say well ain't nothing I can do so God just come in and set a cap throw a match too big I just know there's a law he's a squatter you don't belong there you don't belong there so you go down to the courthouse you get a copy of your need or your abstract whatever that it is this property belongs to me you know they'll ask you that if you try to kick somebody out don't ask me how I know I've know had to do that but I've had family that did there's a lot that they'll ask you the police will come and they'll say now are they on the deed with you huh no not on the deed with me okay don't matter if it's the son or daughter or whoever it is they're not on the deed right they don't have to say they're there because your benevolence I'd love to if we let Satan sit in our easy chair we let that stress and that worry and that fear sit there well I can't do nothing about it kick him off kick him off take the AppStore take the Word of God and begin to read it begin to pray and say go up this was he caught I know I have a right to get rid of it and so I'm asking him to leave it I'm gonna I'm gonna treat it as if he's left hey bets amen I'm gonna mop the my step father when when I was going with Brittany my stepfather Brittany said father when we were going together he would get up and leave and go to bed we knew it's time to go home it's time for me to go home he was done with our visit well the Ronnie was done we need to do that to the devil it's time to go tired of you sitting there man had dominion over the whole earth its body spirit so had dominion over the whole earth here we have our souls been redeemed now we have dominion we have the ability to create an atmosphere even in our spirit realm in our flesh round that God could live within us look here man had dominion over the earth the whole creation is waiting for the sons of God to be manifested Jean encapsulate this and I'm skipping some of this just a little bit of it just to save time but first John 2 and 1 this is our text this is what I kept reading over and over again just read this then we'll go maybe not immediately but we'll go he said my little children these things write I unto you that you sin not I love the way he puts it my little children that you said not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he sayeth I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is done in him not want us to think about this in the effects of propitiation here he is the propitiation of our sin if we know him for our sin if we know him we keep his Commandments if we don't keep his Commandments were a liar if we say we're in him but we don't keep our Commandments if we say we know him but we don't keep his Commandments he said but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected now you hear a lot about people that say well I keep the word every word of it brother Ben every word of it Matt I always always been right on that word is the love of God perfected in you because if you keep the word well notice what he's talking about he's saying if you do you keep his Commandments what is his commandment he loved one another loved one another he said as I have loved you he said the greatest commandment was to love God he said and then love one another whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected perfected you keep the Word of God samer out on the word we've heard it for years well you gonna stay right on the word that's right but it's the love of God perfected in you sometimes being right on the word means not saying everything you know sometimes being right on the word means you say Father forgive them they don't know what they're talking about why because to be right on the word is to have love perfected there and we don't we don't change the Word of God we we don't dare add to or take away from the word we want to stay right with what the word says this is the Word of God the Bible is the Word of God and today we have the revealed Word of God which is God's commentary on the Bible if we can say it that way the divine commentary in the Bible so we know that these line up what a prophet of God said what the word says it lines up we don't take the message and try to line the Word of God up with it we take the Word of God and we line up what our understanding of the message with that right because it will line up because he's a prophet but if we have the word and we keep the word the love of God will be perfected in us and if not there's something that we've left off of the word maybe like the Pharisees we've ties our pepper in the cloth in the cabinet oh god help us today but left off the way to your matters of the law love and mercy faith if we keep his Commandments but whoso keepeth this word in him verily is the love of God perfected that's what I want don't you want that today I want the love of God to be perfected in my life that's what we need as much believers more of that or the love of God perfection of my heart hereby know that we are in him he to say if he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked you can go read in 2nd Peter chapter 3 I believe it is where he says if when he was reviled he reviled not again when he was persecuted he threatened not let me be like that let me follow that example a perfect love but the bantam says this the Holy Spirit brooded his own body to live in Jesus Christ when he overshadowed Mary and created a brood of the blood cell in the womb there's the Godhead again he said that brought forth the son Christ Jesus were God Himself tabernacled on earth for thirty three and a half years and was the propitiation for our sins to redeem us and to bring reconciliation between lost men and a holy God I love this could kiss them and reconcile them together then in the cool of the evening remember that's what Adam lost was God wanting to meet with him in the cool of the evening God never did in God sought men out for salvation but he didn't seek Adam out for fellowship after he sent until there was a propitiation made he sought him out - to cry out Adam what have you done where are you but he want we want God to seek us out for fellowship not just so we can get something from him but so we can just sit there in the cool of evening and said Lord I love you I was so glad you came by for fellowship today isn't that wonderful when someone comes by for fellowship that's what we want with God we want that restored whether someone comes by and it's the Holy Ghost comes by and he comes by for fellowship and here he is to bring a reconciliation to kiss him and reconcile them together and in the cool of the evening when the Sun is setting over our brow he said when my life's journey is run and my race is finished I want him to kiss me to sleep as he did Steven when he was baffled from hand to hand he said I see the heavens open can you imagine what did he say lay not this sin to their charge rock hits him on one side he said I see heavens open that's the way how long he'll have to be let the storm scab people may throw stones or baby rocks come in my direction but let me be able to stay there and see a vision of Christ you say Lord I'm coming home I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God he said I want him to kiss me to sleep what does that speak of God's attitude toward Stephen God's attitude toward Stephen was such that he opened up the heavens in his time of persecution that's what I want I want God attitude not to be one of anger not to be one you say well it can't be that sister cross it can be if I haven't accepted it he still has wrath but if I come God's provided way his attitude towards me has changed his attitude towards me it's not one of judgment it's not one of fear but it's one of grace mercy and love he kisses me to sleep he did Stephen when he was baffled from hand to hand musicians go ahead and come I read an interesting article some time ago there's a song called in Christ alone it's a good song it's a modern him you might say it's kind of written in that formatted and but it was really recently written and was written by mr. Getty Keith Kenney and when he wrote it they were going to put it the Presbyterian Church was going to put that in their new hymnal and they have a committee that searches out songs to put this song in their new hymnal but there was a problem they called and asked him if they could use an alternative lyric because the song contained in it the phrase till on that cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied that's perpetuation if there's no wrath there's no satisfaction it had to be wrath that there's no reason for redemption he said well the crosses is only love though the cross was the wrath of God but God did it because he loved us and so the presbyterian church said we don't want that in our hymnal to say killing that cross was Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied and so much of Christian music today they sanitize the lyrics officially though what gets on the radio because they don't want to offend people by saying God was angry but if you don't recognize God was angry you can't recognize that there there's a blood for you very bad so he said still on the cross that Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied and so they they wanted to change that to the love of God was magnified but how could the love of God be back defined unless his wrath was satisfied and they rejected it I appreciate the songwriter rejecting the request and they did not include it in their hymnal because they didn't want to be identified with the wrath of God but I'm so grateful that I've gone beyond his wrath to have his mercy on me aren't you aren't you grateful that you have his mercy today and you can see on that cross the wrath of God was satisfied listen to the words it says in Christ alone who took on flesh fullness of God and helpless babe this gift of love and righteousness scorned by the ones he came to safe till on the cross as Jesus died the wrath of God was satisfied for every sin on him was laid here in the death of Christ I live hey man and the last verse there's no guilt in life no fear in death this is the power of Christ in me from life's first cry to final breath Jesus commands my destiny no power of hell no scheme a man can ever pluck me from his hand till he returns or calls me home here in the power of Christ I'll stand let's stand together by our hips I want the wrath of God to be satisfied I need a propitiation there was one made for me I beg you today I don't know what your life has been like but we need if there's anything we need in the church today it's a revival of the sense of God's presence when we don't live like we preach or live what we say we deny the omniscience of God God knows everything that we've done god help us today it was all about us He loves us anyway but he loves us because of the death of Christ on the cross that came to bring us back to him changed the attitude of God towards those who would receive it God be angry with this election could God got angry with Moses and tried to find him to kill him but his life grabbed us a sharpen our rocking and did what God commanded and it was blood God was satisfied Oh God we can just realize that today we need a revival of the sense of God of the majesty of God in our myths that we can know he's here he's nearest he knows everything that we do we don't need to hide from him there's no reason died we don't just feel bad when you go to church as well I just don't live right but then when I leave I'm okay we realize God is everywhere he knows well you don't have to feel bad you don't have to be convicted you can come to God and come to Christ you can make it right even as Christians we we fail so much but God we were as a Christian he said he don't look at your mistakes but the brand even said that he hears your voice but he doesn't see you receipts the blood hey man so grateful for that today let's just ponder these things as if you need to come to Christ today and we'll give you that opportunity right where you sit today did you just open your heart up to him and surrender yourself fully to his word let that propitiation become effective in your life if you're a Christian today maybe you've been struggling and I felt the Holy Spirit this morning reaching out to those that were struggling with fear and anxiety and things like that and if you struggle with that today I'll admit I do sometimes as well would you just lay that on him and justjust take up your right as a Christian and save this abstract abstract belongs to me this is my property I have a right to peace I have a right to to God moving in my home I have a right to to peace in my home and peace with others and peace with God I have a right to have faith and to believe he's the same yesterday today and forever could you just reach out to him that way you've struggled with that I know many of us doing this our Satan is fighting our minds trying to make us think he'll try to make it you think that I don't love you that people around you don't love you it's just the devil just cast down that imagination today and let God begin to cleanse out your heart say Lord I accept your permission for my sin for my sickness for everything that I have need a father I believe it's all in you I believe the land belongs to me because of your sacrifice Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you today thank you for Lord these people paying attention Lord though

please you sometimes or do you preach a sermon to sinner's and for sinners and it's Christians who are most pricked in their heart because they want to be clean they want to be right it just means

for that Lord we thank you for your move we thank you for what you've already done or what you've done for these people in years past but today is a new day Lord we want to see you move God I want to see you move like never before whether it be just a sense of your majesty and a sense of worship me when we walk in these doors Lord there would be such an awesome spirit of your presence that a sinner when they walked in with no they needed to repent and give their heart to God that are saying when they walk in would be immediately comforted your mind could be at peace because they feel the presence of God may it be so Lord but it be just a revival and stirring in our hearts card of how much we love you and how we need you and how we need you to be pleased with our lives thank you for
