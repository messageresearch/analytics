[1:06:58] arms and so uh anyways but uh uh Joshua
[1:07:03] the 14th chapter and we're going to
[1:07:06] start at the seventh verse uh says uh
[1:07:10] this is Caleb speaking here says 40
[1:07:13] years old was I when Moses the servant
[1:07:17] of the Lord sent me uh from Kadesh Baria
[1:07:21] to asy out the land and I brought him
[1:07:24] word again as it was in my heart
[1:07:27] nevertheless my brethren that went up
[1:07:29] with me made the heart of the people
[1:07:32] melt but I holy follow the Lord my God
[1:07:36] and Moses uh swear on that day saying
[1:07:40] surely the land where on thy feet have
[1:07:43] trotten shall be thine inheritance and
[1:07:46] thy children forever okay because thou H
[1:07:49] has holy follow the Lord my God and now
[1:07:52] behold the Lord hath kept me alive
[1:07:56] as he said these 4 and5 years even since
[1:08:00] the Lord spake this word unto Moses
[1:08:04] while the children of Israel wandered in
[1:08:06] the wilderness and
[1:08:07] now uh uh lo I am this day uh Four score
[1:08:13] and five years old as yet I am strong
[1:08:17] this day as I was the day that Moses
[1:08:21] sent me as my strength was then even so
[1:08:25] is my strength now for both to war to go
[1:08:30] out and to come in Praise the Lord then
[1:08:35] the 12th verse here now therefore give
[1:08:37] me this mountain everyone say give me
[1:08:40] this
[1:08:41] mountain man give me this mountain
[1:08:44] whereof the Lord spake in that day for
[1:08:46] thou heardest in that day how the Anakin
[1:08:49] were there and that the cities were
[1:08:52] great and fenced if so be the Lord will
[1:08:56] be with me then I shall be able to drive
[1:08:59] them out as the Lord
[1:09:02] said then if you'll go with me uh 1
[1:09:05] Corinthians the 2
[1:09:09] chapter amen First Corinthians the 2
[1:09:13] chapter
[1:09:17] amen so good to be a Christian in this
[1:09:22] age amen First Corinthians
[1:09:26] uh
[1:09:26] 2 and um
[1:09:31] 12 it says now we have receive not the
[1:09:34] spirit of the
[1:09:36] world but the spirit which is of god
[1:09:40] that we might know everybody say we
[1:09:42] might know know the things that are
[1:09:45] freely given to us of God Amen then one
[1:09:51] more scripture if you don't mind Romans
[1:09:53] the 10th chapter
[1:09:57] Romans chapter
[1:10:02] 10 and
[1:10:09] um the eth
[1:10:12] verse but what saith
[1:10:14] it the word is nigh thee even in thy
[1:10:18] mouth and in thine heart that is the
[1:10:21] word of faith which we
[1:10:24] preach amen could we just bow our hearts
[1:10:27] and heads to our Lord
[1:10:31] father it is certainly a good time to be
[1:10:35] in your
[1:10:36] presence Lord there's no
[1:10:39] other presence there's no other one that
[1:10:43] we would rather be with than
[1:10:46] you we thank you Lord for bringing us
[1:10:49] all together here
[1:10:51] today Father we know that you've got
[1:10:53] something in store you thank you for
[1:10:56] what you've done in the past two
[1:10:58] services and touching the hearts of your
[1:11:01] people now father I pray that you would
[1:11:04] help me just to get myself out of the
[1:11:06] way may you anoint the gift that you
[1:11:09] placed within me and may you now just
[1:11:12] speak through these mortal lips to your
[1:11:15] people and may the hearts and ears of
[1:11:17] your people be anointed to hear and
[1:11:19] receive of you we commit this service
[1:11:22] into your hands now in Jesus Christ
[1:11:25] Christ's name and the church
[1:11:27] says amen amen you can have your
[1:11:33] seats if I uh would have a a uh title it
[1:11:39] would be uh possessing our inheritance
[1:11:42] by our
[1:11:44] words amen and um you know in in our
[1:11:48] scripture reading uh Caleb um is is
[1:11:53] ready to possess his inheritance been
[1:11:55] waiting a while now and now it's time
[1:11:59] and and he realizes that he knows it's
[1:12:02] time that uh to to take his inheritance
[1:12:05] and and uh uh to inherit something
[1:12:08] that's that's the an inheritance as
[1:12:10] you've inherited it and to inherit it uh
[1:12:14] something is to come into possession of
[1:12:18] or receive especially as a right or a
[1:12:22] Divine portion amen so the prophet would
[1:12:26] tell us that for you to have an
[1:12:28] inheritance then someone would have to
[1:12:30] leave you that inheritance you don't
[1:12:33] have to beg for it you don't have to
[1:12:34] work for it you don't it it was just
[1:12:38] someone uh left you an inheritance and
[1:12:41] so you are the
[1:12:43] beneficiary of of what has been given
[1:12:46] you and and so uh it's it's yours it it
[1:12:50] it's yours legally it's yours because
[1:12:55] they left it to you of Good Will and so
[1:12:58] if if I said this way if God has given
[1:13:02] you something then you can have it do
[1:13:05] you believe that amen if God has given
[1:13:07] it to you then then then you can have it
[1:13:10] it's yours and it's yours for an
[1:13:13] inheritance and so uh we we find that
[1:13:16] Caleb got this inheritance by the word
[1:13:19] of the Lord and this is what he's saying
[1:13:21] uh through to Joshua that that I Reed
[1:13:24] this inheritance by by the word of the
[1:13:26] Lord through the mouth of a prophet
[1:13:28] aren't you glad for a prophet amen uh uh
[1:13:31] a lot of folks it's it's it's I I think
[1:13:34] it it behooves us to understand why God
[1:13:36] would send us a prophet why the lamb
[1:13:38] would open the book and and what this
[1:13:41] was all about it's not just for us to to
[1:13:44] to be message people but it's an
[1:13:46] inheritance that was given to us amen
[1:13:49] and and and so uh this wasn't just a man
[1:13:53] uh that was saying Caleb you can have
[1:13:54] that Mountain no Caleb understood the
[1:13:58] position of a prophet he understood that
[1:14:00] it was the word of the Lord that was
[1:14:02] spoken through that prophet and he was
[1:14:04] staking his whole life upon that word
[1:14:08] give me my Mountain a ain't that right
[1:14:12] and and so now Caleb you know Caleb has
[1:14:14] been a the the subject uh uh uh for many
[1:14:18] years uh uh preached about maybe even
[1:14:21] sung about and and things like that and
[1:14:24] so I don't have any anything new to say
[1:14:26] today about Caleb but but I do want to
[1:14:28] talk about him and and uh uh and I guess
[1:14:31] the the the reason uh that that we talk
[1:14:34] about Caleb is is because uh any real
[1:14:38] True Believer of today and I and I say
[1:14:41] only today in this age can identify
[1:14:46] themselves with Caleb because Caleb is a
[1:14:49] type of the believer of this day that is
[1:14:52] following the end time message you
[1:14:55] believe that amen see so now you think
[1:14:58] of it and just come to me and and Caleb
[1:15:00] is not the type of any denomination he's
[1:15:03] not the type of a Pentecostal he's not
[1:15:05] the type of a Baptist Methodist 7th Day
[1:15:08] Adventist and and and and to be honest
[1:15:10] he did not type Luther's age he did not
[1:15:13] type Wesley's age and he did not type
[1:15:16] the Pentecostal age he is a type of you
[1:15:19] today amen that that's that's our type
[1:15:22] and so if you ever want to know what you
[1:15:25] are and who you are look at Caleb if you
[1:15:29] ever want to know what drives you to to
[1:15:31] want to get more of God and closer to
[1:15:34] God and and and can you really make it
[1:15:37] is it possible Amen to overcome things
[1:15:39] look at Caleb because Caleb represents
[1:15:43] the end time believer that is following
[1:15:45] the message of the hour do you believe
[1:15:48] that amen and so so no matter how old
[1:15:51] you are or how young you are Caleb is
[1:15:54] your type and and young people just to
[1:15:57] let you know that this message is for
[1:15:59] you just as well amen if it wasn't for
[1:16:02] you and then then Satan wouldn't be
[1:16:04] fighting you as hard as he's doing but
[1:16:07] because this message is for you then
[1:16:10] Satan is fighting you tooth and nail
[1:16:12] just as much as he's doing the preacher
[1:16:14] just as much as he's doing the parents
[1:16:16] and and and all of these things and and
[1:16:19] so then if he is our type then it lets
[1:16:22] us know where we are at as the bride of
[1:16:26] Christ it lets us truly understand our
[1:16:30] age in what we're living in now Caleb
[1:16:33] was a genuine believer and he shows it
[1:16:37] there at Kadesh Baria if if you remember
[1:16:41] uh when he resisted the LIE of the 10
[1:16:45] spies and that's exactly what it was it
[1:16:48] was a lie they were not telling the
[1:16:50] truth to the people amen because God had
[1:16:55] said something different than what they
[1:16:57] were saying and so Caleb and Joshua with
[1:17:00] stood the lie and resisted that thing
[1:17:04] ain't that right you see remember before
[1:17:06] God would allow Israel to cross over
[1:17:09] into the the land of promise he brought
[1:17:13] them to Kadesh Bania and the prophet
[1:17:15] said he' done it to test them amen to
[1:17:19] test them and and he says well what kind
[1:17:21] of a test was it then he said it was a
[1:17:24] word test amen it wasn't a psychology
[1:17:27] test it it it wasn't a a a theology test
[1:17:32] it wasn't them sending them to a a
[1:17:34] school of Seminary and testing them
[1:17:37] based upon their IQ it was simply a word
[1:17:40] test God had given them a prophet God
[1:17:44] had showed them sign after sign after
[1:17:47] sign the pillar of fire was there among
[1:17:50] them God had proven he was with them and
[1:17:53] now it was time time to give them the
[1:17:55] word test can you say Amen yes sir see
[1:17:59] and so they they could not go over into
[1:18:03] the promised land until they were tested
[1:18:05] by the word now the prophet said God
[1:18:08] loves to put your faith to a test to see
[1:18:12] how you'll act upon it he'll let you be
[1:18:15] anointed and prayed for and then make
[1:18:17] you worse and say come on Satan give him
[1:18:21] to the test I know he believes me
[1:18:25] amen I know he believes me ain't that
[1:18:28] right and I want to just say this God
[1:18:29] ain't worried about you believing or not
[1:18:31] that that ain't the point he wants to
[1:18:33] let the devil know that no matter what
[1:18:36] comes your way no matter what Giant and
[1:18:38] what obstacle comes your way there's
[1:18:40] going to be a believer that will stand
[1:18:42] the test amen there's somebody that
[1:18:45] believes this message this message
[1:18:47] wasn't sent in vain this this message
[1:18:49] wasn't just given amen uh uh for for
[1:18:52] everybody to laugh at somebody and
[1:18:55] that's me amen how many calebs do we
[1:18:57] have tonight this morning amen there's a
[1:19:00] Caleb that's going to believe the
[1:19:02] message of the hour amen so he says see
[1:19:05] put him to the test now I know he took
[1:19:08] my word for it see he says God puts our
[1:19:11] test our faith to a test to see if we
[1:19:14] really believe that he is God can you
[1:19:18] say Amen so we we find that God as God
[1:19:21] brought Israel to a test well so has he
[1:19:24] brought the church amen to Kadesh Baria
[1:19:28] Amen in this time and and if you notice
[1:19:31] the prophet said now the test had to
[1:19:33] wait it could not come in Luther's age
[1:19:37] amen he says because they did not have
[1:19:40] the full gospel yet amen see it could
[1:19:43] not come in Wesley's time they didn't
[1:19:46] have the Full Gospel yet amen see so the
[1:19:49] test had to come in the age that that
[1:19:52] we're living in now this word Kadesh
[1:19:55] Baria is Judgment seat of the world and
[1:19:59] and uh uh Moses had had sent 12 Spies
[1:20:04] Amen to uh go across into the land of
[1:20:09] inheritance and when they came back then
[1:20:11] each one was required to give a report
[1:20:15] of what they saw what they heard amen
[1:20:19] what they thought about the land amen
[1:20:21] and they were to present it unto the
[1:20:24] people ain't that right amen and then
[1:20:27] the people had to make their choice amen
[1:20:30] as to what to believe see and so if you
[1:20:34] we remember that there's 10 spies that
[1:20:37] gave a negative report ain't that right
[1:20:40] they gave a negative report and they
[1:20:43] spoke contrary to the message of the
[1:20:45] hour and the negative is the only thing
[1:20:48] that they thought about amen they they
[1:20:51] could only see how small they were Amen
[1:20:54] in in in the land and they could only
[1:20:56] think about the negative they could only
[1:20:58] talk about the negative they they could
[1:21:00] only act upon the negative church we are
[1:21:03] not to be negative
[1:21:05] people and I understand it's we tend we
[1:21:09] can tend to be negative this is a
[1:21:11] negative age that we're living in amen
[1:21:15] there's more negative voices than they
[1:21:17] are positive that God would send us a
[1:21:20] prophit to get us away from the negative
[1:21:24] there's nothing negative in the in
[1:21:26] Christianity there's nothing negative in
[1:21:29] the message of the hour there's nothing
[1:21:31] negative can you say Amen see so we we
[1:21:34] find that that the negative was so
[1:21:38] overwhelming that they just couldn't get
[1:21:40] over it amen see they they they you well
[1:21:43] you know they saw the same things that
[1:21:45] Caleb and Joshua saw amen and And yet
[1:21:49] when they come back they they didn't
[1:21:51] even mention that they would just tell
[1:21:53] them we cannot make it amen they saw the
[1:21:56] Giants and they saw the wal cities and
[1:21:59] that's all they had in their report amen
[1:22:02] see and so their unbelief had blotted
[1:22:05] out all the promises of God to where
[1:22:08] they could only see the obstacles but if
[1:22:12] you notice Caleb and Joshua saw the same
[1:22:14] things amen that the 10 spies saw amen
[1:22:18] but their faith in God their faith in
[1:22:20] the word of God blotted out all the
[1:22:23] obstacles to where they could only see
[1:22:26] the promises of God can you say Amen yes
[1:22:31] sir well the 10 spies gave an evil
[1:22:34] report as as Paul would
[1:22:37] say and I'll say it this way any report
[1:22:40] that's negative is an evil
[1:22:42] report that's right see you see God said
[1:22:45] they could take the land but they said
[1:22:47] we couldn't take it ain't that right
[1:22:49] amen it's just the same way today amen
[1:22:52] see and then the people had to judge
[1:22:55] between man's word and God's word they
[1:22:58] had to judge between what a prophet was
[1:23:00] telling them and what man was telling
[1:23:03] them ain't that right I'll say this
[1:23:06] there ain't nothing wrong with this
[1:23:07] message we don't need another Messenger
[1:23:09] to rise up amen the message is not on
[1:23:13] trial it's our faith that is on trial
[1:23:16] Amen to where we will judge whether it's
[1:23:18] the message is right or whether man is
[1:23:20] right can you say amen that's right and
[1:23:23] that behooves all all of us now amen to
[1:23:26] that we have to make that decision amen
[1:23:29] now because the people were not really
[1:23:31] sold on the message of their day amen
[1:23:36] then they chose to listen to the 10
[1:23:38] Spies of what they had to say amen and
[1:23:42] and uh uh uh the reason why the Paul
[1:23:45] said they had an evil heart of unbelief
[1:23:48] ain't that right and their hearts melted
[1:23:51] within the prophet said they refused to
[1:23:54] take take all of the word they refuse to
[1:23:58] take all of the word sure there might
[1:24:00] have been the evidence of the land but
[1:24:03] there was also this amen you see they
[1:24:05] should have blotted out every negative
[1:24:08] thought amen and just stayed with the
[1:24:10] word God knew that there were giants in
[1:24:12] the land he didn't have to tell them
[1:24:15] that there was Giants in the land he
[1:24:17] just told them you will overcome and I'm
[1:24:19] going to tell you this there there may
[1:24:21] be negative things in your life and and
[1:24:23] you say well God just doesn't know about
[1:24:25] them that's a lie God knows every ounce
[1:24:29] of you he knows every bit about you and
[1:24:32] yet he doesn't mention that to you he
[1:24:35] mentions the promises of the hour and he
[1:24:38] says you're more than able to take the
[1:24:40] land there's no weapon formed against
[1:24:43] you that is going to
[1:24:45] prosper it's amazing how we try to
[1:24:47] remind God of how unworthy we are and
[1:24:50] how bad we are and and what a skunk we
[1:24:53] are God already know knows all of that
[1:24:55] amen he knows that but he's not dwelling
[1:24:58] on that he's dwelling upon the promises
[1:25:01] your
[1:25:03] inheritance now Caleb you know you know
[1:25:06] they they Jesus said they're everyone
[1:25:08] dead they they disbelieved they made
[1:25:11] their choice and and they're everyone
[1:25:14] dead but Caleb had a different Spirit he
[1:25:17] stealed the people and he gave his
[1:25:20] report we are more than able to take the
[1:25:22] lamb God's word word is true everything
[1:25:26] that God said Is Right can you say amen
[1:25:29] and he had evidence to bring back he had
[1:25:32] the evidence ain't that right I I just a
[1:25:34] word to his preachers the prophet said
[1:25:37] we've got to minister the heat's on the
[1:25:40] day is hot let's Minister and fight the
[1:25:43] fight of Faith Can you say amen and stay
[1:25:47] in the battle for the
[1:25:50] people now you know I I just say this
[1:25:53] way you know uh every the ministers that
[1:25:56] uh brother Daryl and brother Andrew and
[1:25:59] and uh uh the the past few nights you
[1:26:02] know they they were standing laboring
[1:26:05] fighting for us for the people can you
[1:26:08] say Amen a lot of times we don't
[1:26:11] understand what ministers go through
[1:26:13] amen we we we don't understand that the
[1:26:15] trials that they they they have we don't
[1:26:18] understand the pastor and how he goes
[1:26:20] through so many things amen but yet
[1:26:23] he'll stand here
[1:26:24] amen not tell you about his problems not
[1:26:27] tell you about his defeats not tell you
[1:26:30] about his failures and he ain't trying
[1:26:32] to be a hypocrite about it he's standing
[1:26:35] here telling you the promises of God
[1:26:38] aren't you glad for men of God that'll
[1:26:40] stand and tell you the promises of God
[1:26:44] yes sir amen could be discouraged and
[1:26:47] everything else but it doesn't matter we
[1:26:49] staying with the promise of the hour sir
[1:26:53] now there will always be two reports
[1:26:55] that we will hear a report of Faith
[1:26:59] which comes from the word of God and a
[1:27:01] report of unbelief which comes from the
[1:27:04] devil ain't that right now Faith and
[1:27:07] unbelief amen they they they they uh are
[1:27:11] influences that come from an Unseen
[1:27:14] World amen and and so we a lot of times
[1:27:17] we think well it's just me that is is
[1:27:20] thinking them negative thoughts no it's
[1:27:22] coming from an Unseen World
[1:27:25] well it's just me getting all worked up
[1:27:27] no it's coming from an Unseen World amen
[1:27:30] see you know one time brother brandham
[1:27:32] drew a a line to make an example and so
[1:27:36] he drew this line and he says in that
[1:27:39] line in in that line are the Mortal
[1:27:42] beings all Mortal beings live within
[1:27:44] that line and he says and then outside
[1:27:47] that line is the Unseen and above that
[1:27:49] line is angels and they they they are
[1:27:52] from above and and angels of God and and
[1:27:56] then below that line are demonic spirits
[1:27:58] and and and uh these things and so he
[1:28:01] says within the line is a conglomeration
[1:28:06] of Blackness and gity and sin and
[1:28:09] divisiveness of the world and and all
[1:28:12] these things and and and so uh but he
[1:28:15] says then then every Mortal being uh uh
[1:28:19] in that line are influenced from the
[1:28:21] world above or the world underneath
[1:28:24] every one of us are influenced by one of
[1:28:28] these worlds ain't that right but we're
[1:28:30] influenced from above or from beneath
[1:28:33] see and and and so he says all those who
[1:28:36] live in darkness are influenced from
[1:28:39] beneath amen I want to say it this way
[1:28:41] don't let your life live in darkness
[1:28:44] don't let your mind live in darkness
[1:28:48] amen don't succumb to the darkness of
[1:28:51] the age that we're living in it's an in
[1:28:54] fluence that will overwhelm you ain't
[1:28:57] that right so he says but in every once
[1:29:00] in a while in this line of darkness and
[1:29:02] gy there and sin and filth and mck amen
[1:29:06] there's little lights amen little lights
[1:29:10] dots he said now that's the born again
[1:29:12] Christian that is influen from the world
[1:29:16] above oh my see now demons bring
[1:29:20] sickness upon people as we know they
[1:29:23] cause authoriz they cause heart disease
[1:29:25] they they cause uh cancer they they they
[1:29:29] cause uh oh well they just every disease
[1:29:32] you can name they cause it it's it's
[1:29:34] that comes from demons ain't that right
[1:29:37] they they cause people to become
[1:29:39] depressed and tormented in their mind
[1:29:42] and tormented in their body amen they
[1:29:45] cause up anxiety amen I've never seen so
[1:29:49] an age where there's so much anxiety
[1:29:52] that is in the world today
[1:29:55] can you say
[1:29:56] Amen it I I you know and even us
[1:30:00] preachers we get attacked with anxiety
[1:30:02] sometimes amen and young people getting
[1:30:05] attacked by anxiety well that ain't you
[1:30:08] that that ain't you that that's that's
[1:30:10] coming from something amen other than
[1:30:13] you that is trying to torment
[1:30:16] you ain't that right now so so they they
[1:30:20] also cause people to disbelieve the word
[1:30:22] of God brother brand said demon Satan
[1:30:25] and his demons anoints Humanity to
[1:30:28] disbelieve God's word so these 10 spies
[1:30:32] they were anointed of demons of Satan to
[1:30:35] disbelieve God's word ain't that right
[1:30:39] amen see and and and so they they and
[1:30:42] and because the people listened to what
[1:30:45] them men had to say they themselves
[1:30:49] become Anointed with unbelief Amen to
[1:30:52] where they could not no longer see the
[1:30:54] the promises of God Amen see and so I I
[1:30:57] I say it this way be careful as to what
[1:31:00] you're listening to be careful as to
[1:31:03] what you're listening to there is no
[1:31:05] reason why we as message Believers
[1:31:07] should be confused as to what God
[1:31:11] Said can you say amen God has so
[1:31:14] Vindicated this message that every one
[1:31:16] of us should be at rest that this
[1:31:19] message is an absolute I know they say
[1:31:21] this message ain't the absolute this
[1:31:23] message is my absolute that's right you
[1:31:26] see the message of the hour was Caleb's
[1:31:29] absolute amen he was he you know he was
[1:31:32] 80 some years old and yet he took the
[1:31:34] mountain he possessed his inheritance by
[1:31:38] the word of a prophet because that word
[1:31:41] became his absolute he didn't care about
[1:31:44] his condition he didn't care how old he
[1:31:47] was he didn't care about the
[1:31:49] impossibility amen God had said I can
[1:31:53] possess list it this message is our
[1:32:00] absolute this ain't time to be
[1:32:02] confused this is time to be sold out
[1:32:06] this is the time to be convinced if God
[1:32:09] said it I can have it I ain't here to
[1:32:12] argue about it I ain't here to decide
[1:32:15] whether the prophet's right or you're
[1:32:16] right or this teacher right God said it
[1:32:19] I can have it you're going to find out
[1:32:23] that you can not possess your Mountain
[1:32:25] amen if you don't believe the word of a
[1:32:27] prophet how else are we going to do
[1:32:30] [Applause]
[1:32:31] it Church we're not
[1:32:33] Warriors we we're not equipped to meet
[1:32:36] the devil on our own in our flesh he
[1:32:39] whoops us all the time on our feelings
[1:32:42] he whips us all the time on our
[1:32:44] Sensations he whips us all the time on
[1:32:46] other things can you say the only way we
[1:32:49] can conquer this enemy is by thus sayth
[1:32:52] the Lord
[1:32:58] be careful that's what you're listening
[1:33:01] to now Faith cometh by hearing as we all
[1:33:04] know the word of God ain't that right
[1:33:09] and Paul would call it the word of faith
[1:33:12] amen the word of faith so Faith doesn't
[1:33:14] come that you can take that Bible and
[1:33:16] you get somebody that's Anointed with
[1:33:18] unbelief and take this very word and
[1:33:21] explain the promises of God to another
[1:33:23] age that ain't the word of faith that's
[1:33:26] an evil report the word of faith will
[1:33:29] take you right to the message of the age
[1:33:32] the word for this age and not leave one
[1:33:35] word out the word of faith will not
[1:33:37] consider your your problem the word of
[1:33:40] faith doesn't consider your situation
[1:33:43] the word of faith doesn't consider the
[1:33:45] impossibility the word of faith says you
[1:33:48] can go forward you can make it you can
[1:33:52] possess
[1:33:54] yes sir now if Faith come by the word of
[1:33:58] faith then we know that unbelief comes
[1:34:01] by words of
[1:34:02] unbelief the word of faith comes from
[1:34:06] one who is
[1:34:07] Anointed anointed can you say Amen their
[1:34:11] faith has been anointed amen think of it
[1:34:14] they could be facing the hardest times
[1:34:16] of their life and let their faith be
[1:34:18] anointed and it'll come forth the word
[1:34:21] of faith I can make it I will make make
[1:34:24] it I I I I can see the way
[1:34:27] out can you say Amen but when a man's
[1:34:31] begins to speak unbelief it shows that
[1:34:35] there's a he he has been anointed amen
[1:34:38] with unbelief can you say Amen you see
[1:34:42] there is an influence behind words that
[1:34:45] are spoken now the Bible says that
[1:34:48] Angels the angels are encamped around
[1:34:51] about those that fear the lord and amen
[1:34:54] they're there the prophet said they
[1:34:55] encourage us along the way aren't you
[1:34:58] glad for that they help us to believe
[1:35:02] they drive back demons from us do you
[1:35:04] believe that I believe the angels of God
[1:35:07] was here amen last night I believe they
[1:35:09] were here the the night before and they
[1:35:11] were they were driving Spirits away amen
[1:35:14] from our minds and encouraging our heart
[1:35:17] amen here was a man of God men of God
[1:35:20] preaching and I just believe just
[1:35:22] happened to believe that from the Unseen
[1:35:24] World there was an angel of God that was
[1:35:27] anointing their words to speak and the
[1:35:30] angels of God was Among Us and they were
[1:35:33] helping us to believe they were driving
[1:35:35] back amen everything to where we could
[1:35:38] receive the word there's there's angels
[1:35:41] that influence
[1:35:43] us they keep us from harm and from Evil
[1:35:47] do you believe that the b or the prophet
[1:35:50] said the angel of the Lord accompanies
[1:35:52] this message always no guarantee about a
[1:35:55] Baptist message or Pentecostal message
[1:35:57] or any other message amen but the angel
[1:35:59] of the Lord accompanies this message
[1:36:01] always so stay with the message believe
[1:36:04] the
[1:36:07] message now brother Brown said that he
[1:36:09] goes a step further he said you got to
[1:36:11] take it yourself to become part of it
[1:36:13] then you and the message become one then
[1:36:16] the anointing is with you as it is with
[1:36:18] others can you say Amen yes sir now so
[1:36:22] Satan's job is to get you to disbelieve
[1:36:25] God's
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:28] word that's right and if he succeeds
[1:36:32] then the word of God Becomes of no
[1:36:34] effect to
[1:36:35] you are you with
[1:36:37] me if he succeeds the word of God
[1:36:40] Becomes of no effect that was the point
[1:36:42] of the 10 spies amen they were anointed
[1:36:45] of the devil two and a half million of
[1:36:47] them amen was were people listen to the
[1:36:50] 10 spies instead of a Vindicated prop
[1:36:56] and when they chose to disbelieve God's
[1:36:58] word and believe a man the word become
[1:37:01] of no
[1:37:06] effect can you say amen that's right so
[1:37:10] brother Bram said we got to stop and
[1:37:12] separate don't don't be
[1:37:15] gullible don't just listen to anything
[1:37:17] that's been
[1:37:19] spoken don't just entertain any thought
[1:37:22] that just comes your way
[1:37:25] can you say Amen don't hang around just
[1:37:27] anybody as your friends if they're
[1:37:30] talking doubt stay away from them if
[1:37:32] they're speaking against this message
[1:37:34] stay away from them if they're trying to
[1:37:36] twist this message all up in your mind
[1:37:39] get away from it it's time for the word
[1:37:42] to have full effect in our
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:46] lives first John 4:1 beloved believe not
[1:37:49] every Spirit but try the spirits try the
[1:37:53] spirits and see whether they're of God
[1:37:56] or not because many false prophets are
[1:37:58] gone out into the world can you say Amen
[1:38:01] well now Caleb are type he refused to
[1:38:04] listen to the rhetoric of them 10 spies
[1:38:08] he refused to listen to the
[1:38:11] unbelief Oh my he stayed with the
[1:38:14] prophet of the age he stayed with that
[1:38:17] Prophet amen he knew what was happening
[1:38:21] he knew what was all about can you say
[1:38:24] amen and guess what the word became
[1:38:27] effective to him the word was effective
[1:38:31] ain't that right now it was years later
[1:38:34] that he enters into the land of rest
[1:38:37] amen he enters under Joshua's Ministry
[1:38:40] into the land of promise now outside the
[1:38:43] land amen the the children of Israel
[1:38:46] were just pilgrims St uh strangers and
[1:38:50] sojourners they they they weren't
[1:38:53] possessing in anything outside the land
[1:38:56] because it wasn't theirs the land of
[1:38:59] Egypt wasn't
[1:39:02] theirs can you say Amen you know so it
[1:39:05] wasn't God's idea for them Moses to
[1:39:09] conquer Egypt amen and build hisself an
[1:39:12] Empire and call it the land of promise
[1:39:15] no God says I'm going to lead you
[1:39:17] out I'm going to lead you out this ain't
[1:39:20] your land let the Egyptians alone you
[1:39:23] come out now numbers 34 one God says
[1:39:28] unto Moses command the children of
[1:39:30] Israel and say unto them when you come
[1:39:32] into the land of Canaan this is the land
[1:39:36] that shall fall unto you for an
[1:39:38] inheritance not Egypt this land of
[1:39:42] Canaan is your
[1:39:44] inheritance even the land of Canaan with
[1:39:47] the coast thereof you see now on their
[1:39:50] Journey they left Egypt and they come
[1:39:52] into the land of Esau
[1:39:54] but you never did find them possessing
[1:39:56] that that was not their
[1:39:59] inheritance they were just passing
[1:40:03] through amen Deuteronomy 2 and4 and
[1:40:06] command thou the people saying you are
[1:40:08] to pass through the the coast of your
[1:40:10] brethren the children of Israel which
[1:40:12] dwell in SE and and they shall be afraid
[1:40:15] of you take ye good un yourselves
[1:40:17] therefore meddle not with them everybody
[1:40:20] say meddle not with him for I will not
[1:40:22] give you of their land no not so much as
[1:40:26] a foot breath because I have given Mount
[1:40:29] seir unto Esau for a
[1:40:35] possession can I say it America's not
[1:40:37] your
[1:40:39] possession politics is not your
[1:40:41] possession Republican party is not your
[1:40:44] possession Democrat Party is not your
[1:40:48] possession there ain't no promises that
[1:40:50] they are offering us that they can give
[1:40:53] us that's not our possession we're not
[1:40:55] looking for America to prosper we're not
[1:40:57] looking for the world and and under
[1:41:00] under the government of man to prosper
[1:41:02] that's not our
[1:41:07] possession worldly things are not our
[1:41:10] possession materialistic things are not
[1:41:12] our possession sad to say people are
[1:41:15] getting so caught up in materialistic
[1:41:16] things they they they're they're they're
[1:41:19] leaving off the things that are
[1:41:20] important that's not your possession
[1:41:25] that's well they passed through the land
[1:41:28] of
[1:41:28] Moab but that wasn't their possession
[1:41:32] that wasn't their inheritance that God
[1:41:33] gave them so they could not settle down
[1:41:37] outside the land that God had given them
[1:41:40] Israel was not to fool around with Esau
[1:41:43] and Moab they were not to mess with him
[1:41:46] they were not to get entangled with him
[1:41:48] they were not to get involved with
[1:41:51] him can you say amen they were not to
[1:41:55] fuss with him they were just to pass
[1:41:59] through ain't that right now if you
[1:42:02] notice the church has passed through
[1:42:10] justification but they weren't to settle
[1:42:12] down in that
[1:42:15] land the church passed through
[1:42:18] sanctification that they weren't to
[1:42:19] settle down in that land ain't that
[1:42:22] right
[1:42:23] the church passed through the
[1:42:24] Pentecostal age baptism of the Holy
[1:42:27] Spirit but they were not to settle down
[1:42:30] in that land we had to keep moving now
[1:42:34] Luther thought he had arrived when he
[1:42:35] got to justification and when he failed
[1:42:38] to follow one he
[1:42:42] died Wesley thought he had arrived under
[1:42:45] justification Pentecostals thought they
[1:42:47] had arrived when they received the new
[1:42:49] birth can you say Amen but they did not
[1:42:53] receive the
[1:42:57] inheritance now this tells us that the
[1:42:59] new birth is not your
[1:43:01] adoption can you say that with me the
[1:43:03] new birth is not my
[1:43:06] adoption now people brother Brown said
[1:43:09] people think well praise the Lord I got
[1:43:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:43:12] settles it that seals me into the
[1:43:14] kingdom I'm a son and a daughter of God
[1:43:16] that's true that that don't have nothing
[1:43:19] to do with your inheritance yet another
[1:43:22] place brother Bram says when the
[1:43:24] Pentecostal church and these people in
[1:43:26] the last days here that's beginning to
[1:43:28] find the new birth being born again they
[1:43:31] thought that settled it no sir you're
[1:43:33] ups and downs and ins and outs and
[1:43:35] things like that God can't place you as
[1:43:38] a son but when you stay in the Kingdom
[1:43:42] stay in the gospel stay right there one
[1:43:45] of these days God will call you out set
[1:43:48] you aside adopt you as his son before
[1:43:52] the people and give you something
[1:43:53] that'll shake the nations with it amen
[1:43:55] see what I mean it's the adoption into
[1:43:58] the
[1:43:59] family brother brandom in his prayer
[1:44:01] said we believe that one of these days
[1:44:03] the holy spirit will move in not with a
[1:44:05] new birth for we receive that through
[1:44:08] Christ but you'll adopt your church then
[1:44:12] then she'll be clothed in the power of
[1:44:14] the resurrected Lord another place your
[1:44:17] adoption is not your birth your adoption
[1:44:21] is your placing
[1:44:25] ain't that right so then we find amen
[1:44:28] that the church had to pass through the
[1:44:31] land of
[1:44:32] justification they had to pass through
[1:44:34] the land of
[1:44:35] sanctification they had to pass through
[1:44:38] the land of the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:39] Ghost to get where we are
[1:44:44] today hello if the Lutheran would have
[1:44:47] moved on they would have been westens if
[1:44:49] the westens would have moved on they
[1:44:51] would have been Pentecostals if the
[1:44:53] Pentecostals would have moved on they
[1:44:54] would have been
[1:44:58] us ain't that right so now where are we
[1:45:02] at
[1:45:03] then well you know we are fulfilling
[1:45:07] Ephesians 1: 15 having predestinated
[1:45:10] everybody say having
[1:45:12] predestinated us unto the
[1:45:16] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:45:20] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:45:22] of his will you see this scripture was
[1:45:24] not speaking of Luther's day it wasn't
[1:45:27] speaking of of Methodist day it wasn't
[1:45:29] speaking of Pentecostal
[1:45:31] day of the age can you say Amen but it
[1:45:34] was speaking of sons of God in this last
[1:45:38] day that would come into their
[1:45:44] inheritance now notice brother Bram said
[1:45:46] in this age that we're now living this
[1:45:50] age it's beyond Pentecost
[1:45:53] see Pentecost has settled itself into
[1:45:56] organizations and started faking a whole
[1:45:59] lot about
[1:46:03] organizations can you say Amen so now I
[1:46:07] want to tell you where we're at we're
[1:46:08] not passing through the land
[1:46:12] again we're not just passing through a
[1:46:16] land we've
[1:46:20] arrived Caleb had come to the a place
[1:46:23] that he wasn't passing through people's
[1:46:25] land anymore he had crossed over into a
[1:46:28] land of inheritance and now he can say
[1:46:32] everything that the prophet gave me it's
[1:46:35] mine give me my
[1:46:42] Mountain we have entered the land a
[1:46:45] promise where the inheritance lays see
[1:46:48] because the inheritance lays in the land
[1:46:50] of promise and only everybody say only
[1:46:54] in the land of promise or in the land of
[1:46:58] inheritance did The Inheritance become a
[1:47:02] reality do you
[1:47:05] realize we are more closer than
[1:47:09] ever to a body
[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:14] change it's becoming such a reality to
[1:47:17] it Heaven is becoming more of a reality
[1:47:20] than this whole
[1:47:21] world right right our full Redemption is
[1:47:25] becoming more of a reality oh yeah than
[1:47:28] ever
[1:47:31] before can you say Amen Redemption
[1:47:35] everything that Christ had died for has
[1:47:37] become more of a reality to you and I in
[1:47:41] this age than it ever did in the days
[1:47:43] gone
[1:47:46] by thank you Lord now brother brandom
[1:47:49] said Israel shouted they danced sure
[1:47:52] they had a a great time but they found
[1:47:54] out they wandered for 40 years now and I
[1:47:57] wondering did you ever think what they
[1:47:58] did out there in the wilderness did you
[1:48:00] ever think of what Israel done God
[1:48:02] blessed them sure he did see they had
[1:48:04] Gardens their crops they married their
[1:48:07] wives and they raised their children God
[1:48:09] blessed them and he's blessed the
[1:48:11] Pentecostal move and sure but remember
[1:48:14] that wasn't what God send them out to to
[1:48:18] live in that Wilderness they was just to
[1:48:21] pass through the Wilderness they were on
[1:48:24] their road to the promised
[1:48:27] land can you say
[1:48:29] Amen so you never find Caleb trying to
[1:48:33] possess things what was not his to
[1:48:38] [Music]
[1:48:40] possess now when a man crosses over into
[1:48:43] that Promised
[1:48:45] Land his whole passion because we're
[1:48:48] looking at Caleb now his whole passion
[1:48:51] was to gain his inheritance that's right
[1:48:53] I want my inheritance on now I've kept
[1:48:56] quiet all this time I bore with
[1:48:59] everything but now I'm in the
[1:49:02] land and I want what God has promised
[1:49:05] me I want to ask you how many wants what
[1:49:08] God has
[1:49:09] promised I want what God has promised

[1:49:13] politics are doing I I ain't interested
[1:49:16] in what our government's doing I'm not
[1:49:18] interested in what Russia's doing I'm
[1:49:20] not interested in everything that's
[1:49:22] going on I just want my
[1:49:24] promise let them pick it Let them fight
[1:49:27] I just want a promise can you say Amen
[1:49:30] Let the churches do what they want to do
[1:49:32] I just want my promise that's where
[1:49:35] we're at in this
[1:49:42] age now if you look Matthew
[1:49:45] 6:19 Jesus says lay up not for
[1:49:49] yourselves Treasures upon Earth where
[1:49:52] and moth do the corrupt and where
[1:49:55] thieves break through and steal but lay
[1:49:58] up for yourselves Treasures in
[1:50:04] Heaven your your inheritance is eternal
[1:50:08] things right Colossians 3:1 if you be R
[1:50:12] then be risen with Christ seek those
[1:50:14] thieves which are above where Christ sth
[1:50:18] on the right hand of God set your
[1:50:21] affection on things above and not on
[1:50:23] things on the earth ain't that right so
[1:50:27] a man that is in the land of inheritance
[1:50:29] seeks to possess his
[1:50:34] inheritance now we all we all know amen
[1:50:37] according to the message of the hour
[1:50:39] that the promised land is to adoption
[1:50:41] Sons adopted Sons adopted Sons become
[1:50:45] heir to the
[1:50:48] inheritance can you say Amen they so so
[1:50:52] this is a this is an adopted son what
[1:50:54] what what is it then what is that
[1:50:56] adopted son he's no longer a child right
[1:51:01] under tutors and
[1:51:03] governors but now he's raised up into a
[1:51:06] position of
[1:51:11] authority not not saying oh I just
[1:51:14] wished I could
[1:51:16] overcome I I I I I I got a desire to be
[1:51:19] this but I just don't know if I can no
[1:51:22] no no you've been given a position of
[1:51:25] power it's a position of
[1:51:29] authority no bargaining with the
[1:51:32] devil Satan give it
[1:51:34] up give me my
[1:51:37] land it's an
[1:51:40] inheritance
[1:51:42] hallelujah hallelujah did you know that
[1:51:44] Caleb he didn't go into that land
[1:51:46] wondering what belonged to
[1:51:50] him he didn't just go around the land
[1:51:52] and said man i' I'd like to have that
[1:51:54] piece of property and Ephraim says oh no
[1:51:55] you can't have that that's mine
[1:51:58] oh so he just wondering around no he
[1:52:02] knew exactly what belonged to
[1:52:05] him church I want to just ask you do you
[1:52:07] know what belongs to you well I'll just
[1:52:10] tell you it makes the the prophet made
[1:52:12] it easy everything that Christ died
[1:52:15] for belongs to
[1:52:18] you
[1:52:20] everything everything

[1:52:25] everything if you need Joy it's yours if
[1:52:29] you need peace it's yours if you need
[1:52:32] forgiveness it's yours if you need just
[1:52:35] a rapturing faith it's yours everything
[1:52:39] that Christ died for is
[1:52:44] yours yes sir it's yours see so now it
[1:52:48] was revealed to Caleb he knew what was
[1:52:51] given to him and notice he laid claim to
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] it I don't know the simple but I hope it
[1:53:00] help you he laid
[1:53:04] claim he didn't sit there in the lawn
[1:53:08] chair drinking lemonade and Fanning
[1:53:10] himself or having somebody else to Fan
[1:53:13] him and said man I just don't know how
[1:53:16] I'm going to do this one maybe just
[1:53:18] maybe maybe we could deal with make a
[1:53:20] deal no he laid claim everybody say lay
[1:53:24] claim now now notice this word lay claim
[1:53:27] means to
[1:53:28] demand as being one's property to assert
[1:53:32] one's right or title to to say that you
[1:53:37] own
[1:53:38] it Church were in the age to lay
[1:53:42] claim it's mine what do you have need
[1:53:46] for doctor says you can't make it doctor
[1:53:48] says you'll always be sick do you have
[1:53:51] to accept that absolutely
[1:53:54] not you lay claim to what God has given
[1:53:58] you don't you let the devil talk you out
[1:54:01] of
[1:54:04] it can you say Amen now if you notice
[1:54:07] his his claim was a confession of
[1:54:10] faith on the prophet gave it to me God
[1:54:14] said I could have
[1:54:17] it so he had an authority behind his
[1:54:20] works
[1:54:22] it wasn't just something he thought of
[1:54:25] it wasn't just something he desired it
[1:54:27] was given to him under a Vindicated
[1:54:30] Prophet now he had the authority in his
[1:54:33] words to lay
[1:54:35] claim give me my
[1:54:39] mouth now we all know that it was a
[1:54:42] confession of faith and to confess is to
[1:54:44] say the same thing as say the same thing
[1:54:50] as I know it's been a attack you know or
[1:54:53] not attack but you know people think
[1:54:56] that we we we quote quotes too much I
[1:54:59] don't think you can quote them
[1:55:02] enough I don't think you can listen to
[1:55:04] the message
[1:55:06] enough
[1:55:08] hello it's your
[1:55:11] inheritance we let the devil talk to us
[1:55:15] we let him say things right here and we
[1:55:18] entertain it we let him talk and talk
[1:55:20] and talk and talk and talk why don't we
[1:55:23] let God have a
[1:55:26] voice let God have a say in the matter
[1:55:29] let God say about your
[1:55:31] situation don't let the devil say you're
[1:55:34] defeated what does God say about
[1:55:37] it you are an invincible Army how many
[1:55:40] believe you're Invincible you are an
[1:55:42] invincible Army we taken we're taking
[1:55:45] our
[1:55:47] inherit oh
[1:55:49] man could you imagine God bringing us
[1:55:51] into the promised land and then leaves
[1:55:54] us beggarly and weak No Authority behind
[1:55:57] our words no Authority behind our
[1:56:00] confession but every time every time you
[1:56:03] say I'm Healed every time you make a
[1:56:05] confession he's interceding for you the
[1:56:09] lamb is interceding for you every time
[1:56:12] you make that
[1:56:15] confession you got a you got all Heaven
[1:56:17] behind you that's what a prophet said
[1:56:20] all Heaven is behind you
[1:56:27] so Caleb was just confessing what the
[1:56:30] prophet said you said well that's
[1:56:32] getting a little absurd no the Bible
[1:56:34] says that the spirit and the bride say
[1:56:36] come the prophet said the spirit the
[1:56:38] prophet and the bride will be saying the
[1:56:40] same
[1:56:41] [Applause]
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:43] thing can you say amen I ain't saying
[1:56:46] what Trump says I ain't saying what
[1:56:48] Biden says I ain't saying what the evil
[1:56:50] thoughts that come into my mind I'm said
[1:56:52] exactly what a prophet said and nowhere
[1:56:55] did he say I'm defeated nowhere did he
[1:56:57] say that I have to give down to the
[1:56:59] devil but he did say I'm an overcomer he
[1:57:02] did say we are a super race a super
[1:57:06] [Applause]
[1:57:08] church and you say
[1:57:12] Amen see so the message of the hour is
[1:57:15] the absolute for every True
[1:57:17] Believer sir now if you allow me we can
[1:57:21] relate to Caleb
[1:57:23] desire to possess what was given to him
[1:57:26] because we've been given an inheritance
[1:57:28] as well God left us the prophet said our
[1:57:31] inheritance when was it left us God left
[1:57:34] it to us before the foundation of the
[1:57:36] world he left us an
[1:57:39] inheritance before the foundation of the
[1:57:41] world oh my amen so if you look at it
[1:57:45] and these are just what the Bible says
[1:57:47] and but Believers are ordained to
[1:57:50] eternal life amen
[1:57:53] so eternal life was given to you as an
[1:58:00] inheritance we have been
[1:58:03] predestinated
[1:58:04] called
[1:58:06] Justified
[1:58:09] glorified before the foundation of the
[1:58:12] world you know what that
[1:58:14] means well brother Bram goes into what
[1:58:17] justification means being justified as
[1:58:19] though you never did it in the first
[1:58:20] place
[1:58:22] walking in this life and never looked
[1:58:24] upon by God as a sinner
[1:58:30] again what an
[1:58:36] inheritance and he left this to you
[1:58:39] before the foundation of the
[1:58:41] world that you could have every right to
[1:58:44] lay claim to it lay claim to it young
[1:58:48] people lay claim to that
[1:58:54] hello according to the scriptures we are
[1:58:57] predestinated to the adoption of sons
[1:59:00] and our inheritance was predestinated to
[1:59:03] us and we were predestinated to obtain
[1:59:08] our
[1:59:10] inheritance now the Bible also says we
[1:59:13] were predestinated to be conformed to
[1:59:15] the image of his
[1:59:17] son It also says that an eternal city
[1:59:21] has been prepare for
[1:59:23] us hello it says that the changing of
[1:59:28] our body it's our inheritance from
[1:59:32] corruption to
[1:59:34] incorruption that belongs to us sons of
[1:59:38] God ruling and reigning is an
[1:59:45] inheritance you believe it than the Lord
[1:59:49] now the the promised land of the old
[1:59:51] test represented the holy
[1:59:53] spirit so now how do we know how do we
[1:59:57] know that we have this
[1:59:59] inheritance amen well Ephesians 1:13-14
[2:00:03] just uh putting it together the Holy
[2:00:06] Ghost is the
[2:00:08] earnest of our
[2:00:10] inheritance in other words it's the down
[2:00:14] payment ain't that right how many's ever
[2:00:18] have made a down payment on something
[2:00:19] that you want you you want something and
[2:00:22] you say I'm going to come and get that

[2:00:30] Ghost becomes our a down payment of our
[2:00:34] inheritance until the Redemption of the
[2:00:36] purchased

[2:05:51] with this promise from the very
[2:05:53] beginning because before the foundation

[2:06:47] 10 spies say there's just no way we're
[2:06:51] going to make it God already told him
[2:06:55] I'll send my angel before
[2:06:58] you I'll make the
[2:07:01] way he already told him
[2:07:04] that how can we as Holy Ghost filled

[2:08:15] saying these preachers ain't just
[2:08:16] preaching the message being
[2:08:19] passive this is something we're Ling
[2:08:21] claim

[2:09:06] ain't got time to dilly dally around

[2:15:34] days we come up you know of out of
[2:15:38] Eternity stepped into a little time
[2:15:40] space here and stepped out of time back
[2:15:43] into eternity we was before there was a

[2:16:19] inheritance now says the little touch
[2:16:22] that we have you said when I walk up
[2:16:24] there to that screen a while ago and
[2:16:26] they were screaming and praising God and
[2:16:29] the Holy Spirit falling and tears
[2:16:31] rolling down cheeks when he was seeing
[2:16:33] Oh hell the power of jesus' name when I
[2:16:36] stood this morning and heard that little
[2:16:38] duet this morning sing that beautiful
[2:16:40] hymn I suppose they sung it he says see
[2:16:43] and the Christians there them old
[2:16:44] veterans that was beating in war beating
[2:16:47] in war and the tears rolling down their
[2:16:49] cheeks what was it it was the earnest of
[2:16:52] their
[2:16:54] salvation aren't you glad we can enjoy
[2:16:56] it here but there's more to come can you
[2:17:00] say Amen oh do you love him as we get
[2:17:05] ready to close amen thinking of the Holy
[2:17:08] Ghost brother BR talked about it being
[2:17:10] the token life for this age which is the
[2:17:13] quickening power of God it is quickening
[2:17:17] us our mortal bodies to the word of God
[2:17:21] do you believe that amen no longer are
[2:17:24] we sitting back and say man I wish I
[2:17:26] could be that I wish I could have that
[2:17:28] no it is a quickening power to Quicken
[2:17:32] that word to
[2:17:36] us what is it it's the word of God which
[2:17:40] is Jesus Christ being impersonated in
[2:17:43] his
[2:17:45] church can you say Amen son of man
[2:17:48] revealed
[2:17:51] sir now the 10 spies they saw the
[2:17:52] evidence of the land can you say
[2:17:56] Amen but they didn't come into its
[2:17:59] fullness they partook of a little of it
[2:18:02] but they didn't come into its fullness
[2:18:05] can you say amen that's right now you
[2:18:07] know I I was thinking of this brother
[2:18:09] Bram said each ages had a dip of the
[2:18:11] Holy Spirit but they didn't go into it
[2:18:13] all the
[2:18:15] way they had a dip Luther had a dip
[2:18:18] Wesley had a dip Pentecost had a dip but
[2:18:22] they didn't go into it all the
[2:18:24] way ain't that right justification he
[2:18:27] said made way for sanctification and
[2:18:30] sanctification made way for the baptism
[2:18:32] of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the
[2:18:34] Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[2:18:38] itself to come right down into
[2:18:41] Perfection back to the word again being
[2:18:45] made
[2:18:47] manifest manifesting itself
[2:18:54] aren't you glad for that the word now
[2:18:58] taking on
[2:19:00] flesh we now becoming the
[2:19:04] promises we now whatever God promised we
[2:19:08] are now taking a hold of it oh yes yes
[2:19:12] yes yes oh do you love him amen amen
[2:19:16] amen so this is the day this is the day
[2:19:19] everybody say this is today that the
[2:19:22] word is to come into full
[2:19:27] effect when Jesus walked the Earth amen
[2:19:31] the word had come into full effect they
[2:19:34] were singing about Messiah they talked
[2:19:36] about Messiah he was Messiah everything
[2:19:40] that they' wrote about talked about sung
[2:19:42] about lived for there he
[2:19:45] was the word had come in full effect
[2:19:51] the word couldn't come in full effect in
[2:19:53] the church until this
[2:19:56] age can you say amen that's exactly
[2:20:00] right amen and when the word did come
[2:20:02] into full effect every scripture
[2:20:05] pertaining to the
[2:20:07] Messiah was
[2:20:09] fulfilled and I got good news for you
[2:20:11] today every scripture pertaining to this
[2:20:16] bride it's time for it to be
[2:20:19] fulfilled don't sit back and look at it
[2:20:22] and wish and hope and want step into it
[2:20:26] and lay
[2:20:27] claim lay claim Caleb can you say amen
[2:20:33] that's right see now you know
[2:20:37] Allelujah Jesus being the full word he
[2:20:40] said search the scriptures and in them
[2:20:42] you think you have eternal life but they
[2:20:44] testify of me but yet the people turned
[2:20:47] it
[2:20:48] down ain't that right now notice the
[2:20:51] church the prophet said was to go on to
[2:20:54] the full
[2:20:55] promise see it should be in her Splendor
[2:20:59] of
[2:21:00] Glory she should be waiting for the
[2:21:03] coming of the Lord but Luther didn't go
[2:21:05] all the
[2:21:06] way Wesley didn't go all the way
[2:21:09] Pentecostal didn't go all the
[2:21:13] way can you say amen he said and instead
[2:21:17] of that she scattered everywhere
[2:21:19] wondering which is
[2:21:21] right is this right is this right well
[2:21:24] I'll go join this and I'll go join that
[2:21:27] that's what that's the confusion of all
[2:21:29] this but this little bride is not
[2:21:33] confused we're not wandering around no
[2:21:36] more we are
[2:21:38] believers in what a prophet
[2:21:41] said and we have moved on beyond all of
[2:21:45] that all the doubt all the skepticism
[2:21:48] all these things and unbelief

[2:22:30] Joshua ain't that right yes sir in the
[2:22:34] message you know Paradox brother
[2:22:36] brandham spoke of the vision that he had
[2:22:38] of him standing on the mount on a map of
[2:22:41] Palestine said he was coming down to the
[2:22:44] Jordan River said as he was going you
[2:22:47] know got there he turned around to look
[2:22:49] where he come from he said I've come
[2:22:51] 2third of the way come that first and
[2:22:54] second
[2:22:55] pull there he was and he looked across
[2:22:59] Jordan and he says over there is where
[2:23:02] all the promises
[2:23:07] lay in that third
[2:23:10] pull the opening of the word is where
[2:23:14] all the promises
[2:23:16] lay that's where the power of God Lays
[2:23:21] can you say
[2:23:22] amen and he moved us in to that third
[2:23:29] pool first pull had nothing to do with
[2:23:32] us second pool had nothing to do with
[2:23:36] us that was for brother Brown's Ministry
[2:23:38] to call
[2:23:39] us but that third pull is for this
[2:23:44] bride it wasn't just for brother brandom
[2:23:47] it was for this
[2:23:49] bride we we ain't claiming our promises
[2:23:52] by by intellect we're not claiming our
[2:23:55] land through guns and weapons and
[2:23:58] through
[2:23:59] politicians we've been given thus sayth
[2:24:02] the
[2:24:05] Lord can you say
[2:24:07] Amen yes sir amen so we find that
[2:24:12] brother bram's Ministry was to take us
[2:24:15] over into that land and place Us in the
[2:24:19] land not bring us through another age
[2:24:23] another land but to place Us in that
[2:24:28] land can you say
[2:24:30] Amen this message revealed what belongs
[2:24:35] to
[2:24:37] us how many believes
[2:24:39] that it is positionally placing Us in
[2:24:43] the
[2:24:44] land now if you
[2:24:46] notice in the land is where the enemy
[2:24:49] becomes a real
[2:24:51] reality not only did the promises become
[2:24:54] a reality but the enemy become
[2:24:58] reality and it's in this age we are
[2:25:02] fighting the most hardest evil demonic
[2:25:05] age
[2:25:06] ever Prophet said demons are pouring in
[2:25:09] from
[2:25:10] everywhere why it's your time to
[2:25:17] possess it's your time to possess yes
[2:25:21] that's right young people are being
[2:25:23] attacked like never before we're
[2:25:25] experiencing things like never before
[2:25:28] mind battles and depression and and just
[2:25:31] one you get out of one trial you go to
[2:25:34] another sometimes you just seem like
[2:25:37] you're even fighting five trials at the
[2:25:39] same
[2:25:40] time that's the place we're
[2:25:44] in can you say amen and what's Satan
[2:25:48] trying to do keep you from your
[2:25:49] inheritance
[2:25:52] trying to keep you from your inheritance
[2:25:54] trying to get you to doubt trying to get
[2:25:56] you to walk
[2:26:00] back now notice brother brah said when
[2:26:02] you say you're going to do anything
[2:26:04] going to accept your healing or going to
[2:26:06] accept your baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:09] that's when the devil flies on you with
[2:26:11] all four
[2:26:14] feet it doesn't mean that God is against
[2:26:17] you it means you're actually doing
[2:26:19] something right
[2:26:20] [Applause]
[2:26:24] can you say Amen you're near the promise
[2:26:28] you're near to the answer that you've
[2:26:30] been looking
[2:26:31] for and Satan is guarding that trying to
[2:26:34] get everything he can to keep you away
[2:26:36] from it but you keep laying caim Caleb
[2:26:42] it's time for it in this
[2:26:44] age he'll tell you you're not going to
[2:26:46] make it in a Rapture I don't I I I'll
[2:26:50] just say you know just me I don't think
[2:26:53] there's ever time in this in any other
[2:26:55] age that there's a people that's really
[2:26:57] had a hard time with wondering if
[2:26:59] they're going to make
[2:27:04] it there's probably never been another
[2:27:07] time except this age when people have
[2:27:09] really fought whether theyve crossed the
[2:27:10] line or not think about it
[2:27:14] yeah it's this is the age I don't think
[2:27:17] there's any other age
[2:27:20] that people have had to fight
[2:27:24] anxiety and
[2:27:26] despair and just want to give
[2:27:30] up in the age that we're living
[2:27:33] in because we're so
[2:27:36] close so
[2:27:38] close to everything that God has
[2:27:41] promised
[2:27:44] us you're the one that's got to take
[2:27:47] it you and I are the one that's got to
[2:27:50] lay claim to it give me my
[2:27:55] Mountain I don't have to beg for it it's
[2:27:58] my
[2:27:59] right it's the age I've been born for
[2:28:03] such a time as this I'm not passing
[2:28:07] through I'm not giving the torch to
[2:28:09] another generation it's my promise it's
[2:28:13] my
[2:28:14] inheritance I will make it in this
[2:28:17] Rapture the Millennium is mine Heaven is
[2:28:21] mine that Eternal City is
[2:28:24] mine and I'm laying claim to it and
[2:28:28] Heaven is behind your
[2:28:30] words can you say
[2:28:32] Amen yes sir see brother R said we're
[2:28:35] longing for
[2:28:37] somewhere where there's no death come on
[2:28:40] how many's longing for that no Sor no
[2:28:43] heartaches no old age the land is
[2:28:47] somewhere and we'll never be able to
[2:28:49] achieve it by gun and fighting and so
[2:28:51] forth of the natural carnal weapon but
[2:28:53] there is a land that we can go to and
[2:28:56] it's a battle to get
[2:28:59] there it's a battle to get
[2:29:01] [Applause]
[2:29:03] there that's where the Giants become
[2:29:06] real was in the
[2:29:08] land when Caleb got to that land to
[2:29:11] claim his Mountain there's no doubt
[2:29:13] there was Giants and he had to keep
[2:29:15] looking up at them
[2:29:17] oh and no doubt let's just put it in our
[2:29:21] terminology in our way today no doubt
[2:29:24] them the words of them 10 men kept
[2:29:27] ringing in his ears we can't make it we
[2:29:30] can't make it we're as grasshoppers
[2:29:33] don't you think that Caleb felt that too
[2:29:36] but he would not give in that he had a
[2:29:39] mountain to claim he had a we to act
[2:29:42] upon that word became his absolute oh
[2:29:47] church and the mountain may be there and
[2:29:50] and the Giants maybe just seem
[2:29:51] overwhelming but you can make it the
[2:29:55] prophet said you
[2:29:57] will God said you will do you love him
[2:30:02] can you lift your hands unto the
[2:30:05] Lord hallelujah
[2:30:08] hallelujah brother R said keep walking
[2:30:11] keep pressing on every time you make a
[2:30:14] step into the kingdom of God that's
[2:30:16] yours all things are possible that's
[2:30:19] given and all things are given that's
[2:30:22] possible but it's a battle we're laying
[2:30:25] claim to Healing we're laying claim to
[2:30:28] full Redemption full adoption we're
[2:30:31] laying claim to the Salvation of our
[2:30:33] loved ones how got children that need
[2:30:36] saved hallelujah we're laying claim to
[2:30:39] that Hallelujah I don't care how way
[2:30:42] where they are the prophet said no
[2:30:43] matter how way where they are you
[2:30:45] realize what he's saying to you no
[2:30:48] matter how bad it looks no matter how
[2:30:51] lost it seem they are you've got a right
[2:30:53] to lay claim that's your inheritance
[2:30:57] you're in the land you're in that land
[2:31:00] of
[2:31:02] inheritance hallelujah we're laying
[2:31:04] claim to Total Deliverance the devil may
[2:31:07] be telling you oh you've always had them
[2:31:09] habits you've always had that oh don't
[2:31:10] you listen to that that may be a giant
[2:31:13] that you're looking at but there is an
[2:31:15] inheritance that you can have they claim
[2:31:19] to it thank you Lord laying claim to
[2:31:21] these things and by faith everybody say
[2:31:24] by faith we lay claim to it if the
[2:31:27] musicians will come
[2:31:30] Hallelujah you see Israel Israel could
[2:31:34] not enter into the promised land because
[2:31:37] of their unbelief do you understand what
[2:31:40] that means if they would have went into
[2:31:42] that land with their unbelief they would
[2:31:45] have become slaves to the Giants there
[2:31:48] would have been nothing in them to
[2:31:50] overcome them you had been too
[2:31:52] overwhelming because that's what
[2:31:53] unbelief does it magnifies everything it
[2:31:56] magnifies the impossibilities it
[2:31:59] magnifies the negative it magnifies it
[2:32:01] all because it's coming from the devil
[2:32:04] can you say Amen so God wouldn't let
[2:32:07] them come into that land amen those that
[2:32:10] were listening to all of that and would
[2:32:12] disregard his word amen see God never
[2:32:16] required them to overcome the enemy on
[2:32:18] their own they were to overcome them by
[2:32:21] faith in the word can you say amen amen
[2:32:25] I want to say this there is absolutely
[2:32:28] no way to overcome with
[2:32:30] unbelief there's absolutely no way to
[2:32:34] overcome by unbelief right leave
[2:32:37] unbelief
[2:32:38] behind can you say Amen unbelief what
[2:32:42] does it do it empowers the devil in your
[2:32:47] life it opens the door opportunity for
[2:32:51] the devil to come in and the more you
[2:32:53] listen to unbelief the more the devil
[2:32:55] can talk and the more you allow him to
[2:32:58] talk the more he gains power and the
[2:33:00] more he gains power the more in bondage
[2:33:02] you become that God never called you to
[2:33:05] come into that land sure sure sure
[2:33:09] you're going to have
[2:33:11] obstacles sure you're going to have
[2:33:14] Giants sure you're going to have
[2:33:16] failures sure you're going to meet the
[2:33:19] enemy
[2:33:20] but you are more than
[2:33:22] conquerors greater is he that is in you
[2:33:25] than he that is in this world if you
[2:33:27] fall get back up again dust your Brites
[2:33:30] off and keep
[2:33:32] fighting young people keep
[2:33:36] fighting God's got an inheritance for
[2:33:39] you
[2:33:40] too can you say
[2:33:42] amen
[2:33:44] hallelujah I don't know what song
