[43:25] one that did it i pray you'd grant it
[43:27] now we ask it in jesus name
[43:30] amen amen god bless you
[43:33] turn with me if you would to hebrews
[43:35] chapter 1.
[43:37] hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 through 14.
[43:43] it's good to see all of you in the house
[43:45] of the lord tonight and
[43:47] good to have caleb and sophie back with
[43:49] us tonight and i know there's a number
[43:51] of others that
[43:52] not able to be here but are watching
[43:54] tonight and god bless you as well
[43:56] hebrews chapter 1 and verse 1
[43:59] it says god who at sundry times in a
[44:01] diverse manner spake in time past unto
[44:04] the fathers by the prophets
[44:06] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[44:09] son
[44:10] whom hath appointed heir of all things
[44:12] by whom also
[44:14] he made the world being the brightness
[44:17] of his glory and the expressed image of
[44:19] his person and upholding all things by
[44:21] the word of his power
[44:23] when he had by himself purged our sin
[44:25] set down on the right hand
[44:27] of the majesty on high being made
[44:31] so much better than the angels as he
[44:33] hath by inheritance obtained
[44:36] a more excellent name than they
[44:39] i tell you what you could read this book
[44:41] of hebrews and just have a shouting
[44:42] spell
[44:43] just the way that paul writes this he
[44:46] says for unto which of the angels said
[44:47] he at any time
[44:49] or my son this day have i begotten thee
[44:52] and again i will be to him a father and
[44:54] he shall be to me a son
[44:56] and again when he bringeth in the first
[44:58] begotten into the world he saith and let
[45:00] all the angels of god worship him
[45:03] of the angels he saith who maketh his
[45:05] angels spirits his ministers the flame
[45:07] of fire
[45:08] but unto the sun he saith thy throne o
[45:10] god is forever and ever a scepter of
[45:12] righteousness
[45:14] is the scepter of thy kingdom thou hast
[45:16] loved righteousness and hated iniquity
[45:19] therefore god even thy god hath anointed
[45:21] thee with the oil of gladness above thy
[45:23] fellows
[45:24] and thou lord in the beginning hath laid
[45:26] the foundation of the earth and the
[45:27] heavens of the works of thine hands
[45:30] they shall perish but thou remainest and
[45:32] they all shall wax old
[45:33] and stuff of garment and as the vesture
[45:36] shalt thou fold them up and they shall
[45:37] be changed but thou art the same
[45:40] the years shall not fail but to which of
[45:42] the angels saith
[45:44] said he at any time sit on my right hand
[45:46] until i make thine enemies
[45:47] that footstool are they not all
[45:50] ministering spirits sent forth to
[45:53] minister
[45:54] for for them who shall be heirs
[45:58] of salvation let me read that last verse
[46:00] again i want to speak to you on
[46:03] uh new testament angels
[46:06] and that last verse are they not all
[46:07] ministering spirits
[46:09] sent forth to minister for them who
[46:11] shall be heirs
[46:12] of salvation i believe that's us tonight
[46:15] amen i pray the lord would add his
[46:17] blessing to the word you may be seated
[46:22] i didn't intend to do this in a series
[46:24] of sermons i just wanted to approach
[46:26] this tonight but
[46:28] there's no way we could even scratch the
[46:30] surface so i may
[46:32] pick this up again but
[46:35] the scripture that we just read is used
[46:37] by skeptics to point out that angels
[46:40] do not visit us today that was only for
[46:43] the old testament saints
[46:45] but paul's not saying that god doesn't
[46:47] use angels
[46:49] in fact he says that their purpose is as
[46:52] ministering
[46:53] spirits sent forth to minister for them
[46:56] who shall be heirs of salvation and so
[46:59] there
[47:00] are angels god does use angels today
[47:03] but he's saying christ is better than
[47:05] the angels and that's the theme of
[47:06] hebrews is
[47:08] christ is better than the angels christ
[47:10] is better than the law
[47:11] christ is better than the prophets
[47:12] christ is better than moses paul says
[47:14] that over and over again
[47:16] in the book of hebrews who he's saying
[47:18] he's saying that
[47:19] uh god uses angels but christ is better
[47:22] than the angels now
[47:24] in in fact he expressly affirms angelic
[47:27] intervention by saying that
[47:29] he actually says this is what they do
[47:32] this is what angels do they they're
[47:33] ministering spirits they come out
[47:36] and minister for them who shall be heirs
[47:38] of salvation or they
[47:40] attend to them and
[47:43] you know as and i'll just talk to you
[47:46] for a moment but
[47:47] as a minister and as a as a people of
[47:49] this message
[47:51] we have to be careful that we don't take
[47:53] all the supernatural
[47:54] out of what we believe or put it back in
[47:58] another time
[47:58] even if that time is 50 years ago we've
[48:01] got to believe that god
[48:02] still visits us today that these
[48:05] ministering spirits still come with the
[48:07] howard
[48:08] and come to us it may not be the angel
[48:10] that come to brother branham
[48:11] but there are angels who attend those
[48:14] who
[48:14] are the saints the heirs of salvation
[48:17] [Music]
[48:19] right and and so we believe god has sent
[48:22] forth angels in this day and
[48:24] and you've got to have a supernatural
[48:26] element to what you believe
[48:28] because if it's just word and i say that
[48:30] because i believe the word
[48:32] is supernatural how many believe that
[48:34] tonight the word itself is supernatural
[48:37] the word is alive it's quick the bible
[48:39] says and powerful and able to divide the
[48:41] asunder between the soul and spirit
[48:43] so the word itself is supernatural yet
[48:46] there's a supernatural element that we
[48:48] look to
[48:49] things that we can't explain we don't
[48:50] know how it happened we don't know
[48:52] anything about it we just know it's
[48:54] there
[48:55] we just know it happened right there's
[48:57] got to be that element to our experience
[48:59] in christ that there's something that
[49:01] god did
[49:02] that's beyond what we could dream up
[49:03] beyond what we could imagine
[49:05] beyond anything that we could have ever
[49:07] planned or put together
[49:10] a lot of what's taught today in bible
[49:12] teaching is that well if you take this
[49:14] and
[49:14] and a lot of it's true that if you take
[49:17] this element of faith and put it with
[49:18] this one and put it with that one and
[49:20] stack them together
[49:21] eventually you can have what you want
[49:23] you can name it you can claim it
[49:25] there's a lot of truth to that but there
[49:27] is also a supernatural element sometimes
[49:29] you're just waiting
[49:31] on god to do something
[49:34] and we don't we can't explain abraham
[49:36] could not explain why
[49:37] he had faith for the entire 25 years
[49:40] but one day an angel come by his way and
[49:44] it was about a year after that that
[49:46] that the baby was born in or nine months
[49:48] so it was
[49:49] god moving and sending angels and he
[49:52] said brother ben why does he use angels
[49:54] i don't know it's just how he chooses to
[49:57] do it
[49:58] right because he could do it all himself
[50:01] but he doesn't choose to do it that way
[50:04] sometimes he comes down himself in the
[50:07] old testament he would come in a
[50:09] in a body in a theophany form he would
[50:11] come like melchizedek made himself a
[50:14] body and came down
[50:16] and sometimes he appeared as the angel
[50:17] of the covenant
[50:19] and sometimes he sent another angel
[50:22] right and he sent it for different
[50:23] purposes at different times sometimes
[50:25] he'd speak directly to the prophet
[50:26] sometimes he'd send an angel
[50:28] to speak to a prophet to speak to the
[50:30] people sometimes he'd speak to the
[50:31] people
[50:32] with through an angel and then speak to
[50:34] him through the prophet
[50:36] right and so god has always used angels
[50:39] in his administration and i i don't
[50:41] again i don't understand why he does
[50:43] that but it's how he chose to do it
[50:46] and i wonder today if it if we could
[50:49] just
[50:50] take off our our cynicism for just a
[50:52] moment because
[50:54] i tell you what i'm cynical too
[50:56] sometimes
[50:58] because i was raised in uh in a in a
[51:01] place in a church where
[51:03] there were always angels and visitations
[51:05] and pillars of fire and different things
[51:06] going on all the time and
[51:08] and sometimes you look at that and think
[51:10] and you begin to get skeptical because
[51:11] you realize that a lot of those people
[51:13] don't live right
[51:14] and a lot of them where the rubber meets
[51:16] the road they're just not where they
[51:17] ought to be
[51:18] and sometimes what seemingly the most
[51:20] spiritual people are the ones that have
[51:22] the most
[51:23] seeming angelic visitations
[51:26] and it might be real though it might be
[51:30] because if you look in the scriptures it
[51:32] doesn't angels didn't just come to good
[51:34] people
[51:36] and they did come to the people of god
[51:38] but they come to others as well
[51:40] many times ministering spirits come but
[51:43] but they're there for our
[51:44] for our good right regardless of how
[51:47] they come
[51:48] now they're sent forth to minister for
[51:50] them who should be heirs of salvation
[51:52] and so it's for our
[51:53] benefit that they come they may come
[51:57] an angel might come and influence the
[51:59] the
[52:00] something in an area or in a church or
[52:02] something like that but it's for our
[52:03] benefit
[52:05] and there's people who are who are as
[52:07] false as false can be at the bottom
[52:09] that'll feel
[52:10] the presence of that angel just like you
[52:12] do
[52:14] right and they're completely false yet
[52:16] they're visited by
[52:18] that same angelic feeling that same
[52:20] presence that you feel
[52:22] and they're completely false and yet
[52:23] they feel the same thing
[52:25] but it's still they don't make the angel
[52:27] wrong
[52:29] now and brother branham explains that to
[52:30] us aren't you glad for the message of
[52:32] the hour tonight
[52:33] we don't have to be confused about these
[52:35] things
[52:36] but brother branham in the message and
[52:39] this is used against the message today
[52:41] by people who have left
[52:43] that say well god don't use angels
[52:45] anymore why did brother branham talk
[52:46] about angels
[52:48] and brother branham tells of many
[52:49] angelic visitations in the message he
[52:51] tells
[52:52] of an angelic visitation at his
[52:54] commission
[52:56] and when he tells it you know even to
[52:58] the people he was telling to it sounded
[52:59] strange
[53:01] and us today if you would tell that in
[53:03] the world today and we do
[53:04] it sounds strange to the world until
[53:07] it's sometimes we get kind of a
[53:08] backwards feeling about it with a caleb
[53:10] where we don't really want to tell about
[53:12] it
[53:12] about the supernatural because we think
[53:14] well you know
[53:16] you know god doesn't really work that
[53:18] way anymore and if he does you know
[53:19] people just won't believe it
[53:22] you know and so you kind of get a
[53:23] backwards feeling about that telling
[53:24] about a prophet and about signs and
[53:26] wonders and things like that
[53:27] but to the early church this would not
[53:31] have been strange
[53:35] brother brown's story of an angel coming
[53:37] would have fit right in
[53:39] with multiple angelic visitations in the
[53:41] early church in fact brother branham
[53:43] tells us
[53:44] that there were more angelic visitations
[53:46] in the new testament than in the old
[53:47] testament
[53:48] and you can look at that and see all the
[53:50] angels in the old testament but remember
[53:52] it was spread out over hundreds and
[53:53] hundreds of years
[53:55] but in the new testament in about 75
[53:57] years of history that we have in the new
[53:58] testament
[53:59] all these angels come and visited the
[54:01] church and and so god has actually
[54:03] didn't he didn't stop
[54:04] dealing with angels he didn't stop
[54:06] working through angels but he actually
[54:08] increased that after the church came
[54:13] now brother branham was speaking about
[54:14] an angelic visitation he said
[54:16] someone said not long ago said brother
[54:18] branham you're mistaken about that man
[54:19] that talks to you that was the lord
[54:21] because this was someone speaking to him
[54:22] a church of christ brother that
[54:24] didn't believe in angels or angelic
[54:26] visitation so he said well that must
[54:28] brother adam that must not have been
[54:29] an angel must have been the lord he and
[54:32] brother brother said i said it was an
[54:34] angel
[54:34] he said i'm sent from the presence of
[54:36] god he wasn't the lord he was an angel
[54:41] and again it sounds almost strange to
[54:43] modern ears but it wouldn't have sounded
[54:44] strange to them
[54:47] right and and we're supposed to go back
[54:49] to that kind of faith and practice and
[54:51] it's a restoration message
[54:54] to restore back the years that the
[54:56] canker were made away and the palm warm
[54:58] and all those things and so
[55:00] and so it shouldn't sound strange to us
[55:02] today
[55:03] to see angels ministering now brother
[55:06] branham tells about that he said he
[55:08] wasn't the lord he was an angel he said
[55:09] and god still has angels
[55:11] and they visit the people amen do we
[55:14] believe that tonight
[55:16] they visit the people he said not a
[55:18] worship of angels but angelic
[55:20] beings who are attributes of god sent
[55:23] forth to minister to the church
[55:25] through the people he said oh my he said
[55:28] how
[55:28] short we are of the real apostolic
[55:31] church today
[55:32] of the blessing and he brings it up in
[55:35] that same sermon he talks about how that
[55:37] well we have a lot of dancing he calls
[55:39] it bubble dancing we have a lot of
[55:40] things like that
[55:41] but how short we are of the real
[55:43] apostolic church
[55:44] today of the blessing of god which is
[55:47] a power that comes that will actually
[55:50] enable you as an anointing it's not just
[55:51] a good feeling
[55:52] that that's effects of the anointing but
[55:55] the anointing is an empowerment
[55:56] to be able to do what you wouldn't
[55:58] otherwise be able to do
[56:01] amen and we need that today don't we
[56:04] because we face the devil that's on the
[56:06] rampage
[56:07] you know it's amazing the modern church
[56:09] believes in demons but don't believe in
[56:10] angels
[56:13] and so it's a one-sided fight but alan
[56:16] they're fighting without any weapons
[56:17] because they they don't believe in
[56:18] spiritual warfare well you just have to
[56:20] pray and believe that god will
[56:21] but god has a has a side he got people
[56:24] on his side too
[56:26] in fact he said there's more with us
[56:27] than be with them
[56:30] hallelujah now
[56:34] in psalms 34 and 7 and the old testament
[56:36] promise was that the angel the lord
[56:38] encampeth around about them that fear
[56:39] him and delivereth them
[56:40] and those new testament believers but
[56:43] howard believed
[56:44] that they believed that
[56:48] they believed that god that an angel
[56:50] would actually be there god would send
[56:52] his angels
[56:54] i wonder if we can believe that tonight
[56:57] i know it's a little bit different kind
[56:59] of a sermon for me but just to kind of
[57:00] catch our attention in
[57:02] supernatural things if if we could
[57:03] believe that god sends his angels to
[57:06] this service
[57:08] his messengers could come and stand here
[57:10] and reveal to us the word
[57:12] and speak to us and help us in our lives
[57:14] and that old testament promise those new
[57:17] testament saints held on to that because
[57:18] god never did away with that
[57:21] now the first thing that we find
[57:25] in the new testament as far as an
[57:26] angelic appearance is in acts chapter 1
[57:28] and verse 10 immediately
[57:31] after the ascension of christ
[57:34] immediately there are two angels
[57:38] that show up on the scene and what they
[57:41] do is they begin to reveal
[57:42] secrets hidden in the word
[57:46] right watch what happens while they look
[57:48] steadfastly toward heaven as he went up
[57:50] they watched him go and he said okay
[57:52] what now
[57:54] right they needed to know what now
[57:57] now the coming of christ was all through
[57:59] the old testament if
[58:01] if you talk about his his uh his final
[58:04] coming
[58:05] but yet there was a hidden mystery of
[58:06] the second coming that wasn't revealed
[58:09] in the old testament it was there and
[58:11] tight but it wasn't revealed
[58:13] and how it would be and these angels
[58:16] come because one of the
[58:17] one of the things you'll run into when
[58:19] people try to tear down the message is
[58:20] they'll try to say well angels wouldn't
[58:22] come and reveal anything
[58:24] all angels would do is come and help you
[58:25] in some way
[58:27] well the first thing they did was begin
[58:30] to reveal the word
[58:31] because while they look steadfastly
[58:33] toward heaven these two men in white
[58:35] apparel
[58:36] which also said you men of galilee why
[58:38] stand you gazing up into heaven this
[58:40] same
[58:40] jesus now they're preaching corporal
[58:43] body
[58:44] they're preaching a return of christ
[58:47] that hadn't been known before jesus
[58:50] alluded to it he talked about it and all
[58:51] these things
[58:52] but they didn't know in what manner he
[58:54] would come but here come two angels that
[58:56] come down and reveal to the church
[58:58] he said which is taken up from you into
[59:00] heaven shall so come in like manner
[59:02] this same jesus which is taken up from
[59:04] you into heaven shall so come in like
[59:06] manner
[59:07] as you have seen him go into heaven
[59:11] huh i still believe that today
[59:15] you got to be careful how much you
[59:16] spiritualize
[59:18] right because if you over spiritualize
[59:20] things eventually you get to where
[59:21] there's no angels there's no help
[59:23] there's nothing oh it's just the word
[59:24] brother ben and i believe in the word
[59:25] more than anybody
[59:26] but the word has some power to it and
[59:28] some effects
[59:30] from him so
[59:33] if we see this then why would it be
[59:35] strange to see an angel come to a
[59:36] prophet
[59:38] to reveal the mysteries hidden in the
[59:39] word if those angels come to those
[59:41] original disciples
[59:43] to reveal to them the coming of the lord
[59:45] revelation 22 and 6
[59:47] speaks of an angel coming in the new
[59:48] testament so i'm skipping ahead here to
[59:50] the end
[59:51] and we'll touch some of these others
[59:53] maybe later if god helps us
[59:55] but in revelation 22 and 6 he said unto
[59:57] me these things are faithful and true
[59:59] and the lord god of the holy prophet
[1:00:01] sent his angel
[1:00:02] to show unto his servants the things
[1:00:05] which must be shortly be done
[1:00:08] sounds like god still reveals things in
[1:00:10] the new testament
[1:00:12] by angels
[1:00:16] now it was an angel with a revelation
[1:00:19] for john
[1:00:20] and we know there are heavenly angels
[1:00:22] and earthly angels
[1:00:25] maybe we'll get in more into this this
[1:00:27] is a fascinating study but
[1:00:28] maybe we'll get more into this at a
[1:00:30] later time but
[1:00:32] brother branham talks about how solomon
[1:00:33] built his temple and just give you some
[1:00:35] background and it's involvement gilead
[1:00:37] but the random is
[1:00:38] is talking before a prayer line and
[1:00:40] they're not having a prayer line where
[1:00:42] of discernment a discernment line
[1:00:44] they're having a prayer line where the
[1:00:45] ministers will come and lay hands on the
[1:00:47] people
[1:00:48] so he's lined up the ministers in front
[1:00:50] like like we would today
[1:00:52] and you have a double line and everybody
[1:00:54] lays hands on the people when they come
[1:00:55] through now people don't understand
[1:00:56] prayer lines i watch them when
[1:00:58] a prayer line is for the purpose of
[1:00:59] having hands laid on you
[1:01:02] you might stop and shout and scream and
[1:01:04] whatever you might
[1:01:05] go through and and stay for 20 minutes
[1:01:08] and somebody pray for you but that's
[1:01:10] that's valid okay that's a wonderful
[1:01:12] thing but a prayer line really all you
[1:01:14] have to do is have hands laid on you
[1:01:16] because that's what the promise of the
[1:01:17] word is they'll lay hands on the sick
[1:01:20] doesn't even say they'll pray
[1:01:22] so when brother branham had a prayer
[1:01:23] line like that what he called a fast
[1:01:25] line
[1:01:25] he would send the people through and
[1:01:28] then as they come through he'd lay hands
[1:01:29] on them
[1:01:30] and say bless my sister in the name of
[1:01:33] jesus something like that
[1:01:35] and they would come through why because
[1:01:37] it wasn't up to
[1:01:38] brother branham he was fulfilling the
[1:01:40] word by standing there and they were
[1:01:41] fulfilling the word by going through
[1:01:45] right now so we still believe in that
[1:01:47] today god still does that but that's
[1:01:48] what
[1:01:49] brother branham is talking about here he
[1:01:51] said did you ever notice how solomon
[1:01:53] built his temple
[1:01:54] he said listen close when you entered
[1:01:56] into the door what happened
[1:01:57] there was angels carved out of olive
[1:01:59] wood with their wings tipping across
[1:02:03] every worshiper coming to the holy seat
[1:02:06] come right down across the tips of these
[1:02:08] angels wings
[1:02:09] right down to the mercy seat right down
[1:02:12] to the altar
[1:02:13] and you can go and read that in in where
[1:02:15] he talks about how that he built the
[1:02:17] temple solomon built the temple it
[1:02:18] describes
[1:02:19] those angels wings that touched one
[1:02:21] another
[1:02:22] and were so wide and touched the walls
[1:02:24] of the of the holy of holies
[1:02:26] in solomon's temple now he said you know
[1:02:29] the order of solomon's temple he said
[1:02:32] well what is an angel a messenger
[1:02:35] he said get the dictionary find out what
[1:02:36] an angel means
[1:02:38] he said some of them some of them's
[1:02:40] heavenly messengers
[1:02:41] some of them's earthly messengers that
[1:02:44] god
[1:02:45] dwells in to bring his earthly
[1:02:48] message
[1:02:51] and brother adam's talking now about the
[1:02:53] ministers that are standing out there
[1:02:55] and are laying hands on people
[1:02:56] he said and these are messengers
[1:03:00] angels of the lord messengers to you or
[1:03:02] if we could only receive it like that
[1:03:05] now if we could only receive it like
[1:03:06] that we can see how god sent a prophet
[1:03:08] and he was a messenger to the age
[1:03:10] and we received that ministry if we
[1:03:11] could only receive if we can only see
[1:03:13] that god sends angels today
[1:03:15] not to take his place but to be stand
[1:03:17] there
[1:03:18] and fulfill the word messengers who
[1:03:22] he said they're standing there with the
[1:03:23] hands out to obey what god says lay
[1:03:26] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:03:28] it has to happen
[1:03:32] amen amen so it's not the length or the
[1:03:36] sincerity or anything of the prayer it's
[1:03:38] the fact you come according to god's
[1:03:40] word
[1:03:42] and god's word said lay hands on the
[1:03:45] sick and they shall recover
[1:03:47] and it has to happen so you should be
[1:03:48] expecting god to do what he said
[1:03:51] and that will bring a shout that will
[1:03:53] bring hallelujah that will
[1:03:54] maybe make you speak in tongues or
[1:03:56] whatever it does but it's what is it
[1:03:58] it's god
[1:03:58] fulfilling his word you get so excited
[1:04:02] because you know you don't have to shout
[1:04:03] you don't have to speak in tongues
[1:04:04] because the promise is true regardless
[1:04:06] of how you feel
[1:04:09] right now
[1:04:13] hallelujah he says do you believe that
[1:04:16] every one of you coming through
[1:04:19] amen i still believe in angels today
[1:04:23] look at that authority that god gave an
[1:04:25] earthly angel let's turn our attention
[1:04:26] for just a moment to revelation chapter
[1:04:28] 18
[1:04:29] and verse one because we're talking
[1:04:30] about angels that would come
[1:04:33] and now earthly angels and heavenly
[1:04:34] angels while we're talking about earthly
[1:04:36] angels
[1:04:37] let's look at this revelation 18 1 he
[1:04:40] said
[1:04:41] after these things i saw another angel
[1:04:42] come down from heaven
[1:04:44] having great power and the earth was
[1:04:46] lightened with his glory
[1:04:49] and brother branham explained to us what
[1:04:50] that was and i'll go on in just a moment
[1:04:52] but
[1:04:53] i was back here in the back and i'm kind
[1:04:55] of struggling with that verse i always
[1:04:56] have
[1:04:57] because of the way that it's written
[1:05:00] and but i believe what brother brown
[1:05:02] said about it but i've kind of struggled
[1:05:03] with that and i looked at
[1:05:05] into my my bible program on my on my
[1:05:08] ipad and it sets out a commentary on one
[1:05:12] side and the bible on the other
[1:05:13] and the commentary that happened to be
[1:05:15] pulled up when i pulled up that
[1:05:16] scripture was adam clarke's
[1:05:18] this is what he said about that
[1:05:19] scripture he said the earth was
[1:05:20] lightened with his glory
[1:05:22] he said this may refer to some
[1:05:23] extraordinary messenger
[1:05:25] of the everlasting gospel who by his
[1:05:28] preaching and writings
[1:05:30] should be the means of defusing the
[1:05:32] light of truth
[1:05:34] and true religion over the earth
[1:05:38] i looked at that and about how to spell
[1:05:40] by the same
[1:05:44] over 200 years ago under that anointing
[1:05:48] of a man you understand that knowledge
[1:05:49] of looking at the scripture and said
[1:05:51] well this must be
[1:05:52] a messenger amen an earthly messenger
[1:05:55] and that's what brother brown said it
[1:05:56] was even though
[1:05:57] the angel come down from heaven having
[1:06:00] great power and the earth was lightened
[1:06:01] with his glory now
[1:06:02] so it goes on in verse two he said he
[1:06:04] cried mightily with a strong voice
[1:06:05] notice what he does
[1:06:07] he cries and says saying babylon the
[1:06:09] greatest fallen has fallen
[1:06:11] and it's become the habitation of devils
[1:06:13] in the hold of every foul spirit
[1:06:15] in a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:06:18] bird
[1:06:20] he comes in and preaches an indictment
[1:06:23] on that system
[1:06:25] huh he comes and tells us why we're not
[1:06:27] part of that organized religion
[1:06:30] why we're not a denomination
[1:06:34] so he comes and he says she's become the
[1:06:36] habitation of devils and
[1:06:38] he said for all nations have drunk of
[1:06:39] the wine of the wrath of her fornication
[1:06:41] and the kings of the earth have
[1:06:43] committed fornication with her and the
[1:06:44] merchants of the earth are waxed rich to
[1:06:46] the abundance
[1:06:48] of her delicacies so he comes in
[1:06:50] attacking that
[1:06:51] that worldly church that uh that horror
[1:06:54] of revelation 17 and so he comes doing
[1:06:57] that and
[1:06:58] and then verse four he said then i heard
[1:07:00] another voice from heaven
[1:07:02] another voice noticed from heaven saying
[1:07:04] come out of her my people
[1:07:06] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:07:09] that you receive not of her plagues
[1:07:13] notice this angel is the last messenger
[1:07:15] before the coming of christ in the 19th
[1:07:16] chapter of revelation
[1:07:18] i had some of that in here and i took it
[1:07:20] out to save time but you go to the 19th
[1:07:22] chapter of revelation
[1:07:23] and begins to talk about a bride and how
[1:07:25] that she would be
[1:07:26] how that she would be putting on some
[1:07:28] clothes amen
[1:07:30] she'd be clothed in white raiment and
[1:07:32] all the things about a bride
[1:07:34] and he said this messenger he said
[1:07:37] it's the last messenger before the
[1:07:39] coming of christ in the 19th chapter of
[1:07:40] revelation the messenger's voice
[1:07:42] he said if we notice when he gave his
[1:07:44] voice on the earth
[1:07:46] there was a voice echoed again in heaven
[1:07:49] he said in the fourth verse he said the
[1:07:50] mess
[1:07:50] this messenger on the earth now watch
[1:07:53] this
[1:07:54] this is what god can do through an angel
[1:07:57] you believe he still uses angels
[1:07:59] this messenger on the earth was so
[1:08:01] inclined with god
[1:08:03] until when he spoken on the earth god
[1:08:06] echoed the same thing out of heaven
[1:08:10] hallelujah and brother brother says what
[1:08:13] is that fourth verse translation what
[1:08:15] does it mean
[1:08:17] he says god's voice speaking to his
[1:08:20] predestinated people
[1:08:23] hallelujah saying come out of here
[1:08:27] now we've heard the voice on earth have
[1:08:31] we heard the voice from heaven
[1:08:33] which echoes the voice on earth amen
[1:08:35] what is it the voice of predestination
[1:08:38] that's why some come and go that's why
[1:08:40] some leave the message of the hour
[1:08:41] countless nothing say he's a false
[1:08:42] prophet why they heard the voice on
[1:08:44] earth
[1:08:45] but they never heard the echo of it
[1:08:50] it's god's voice speaking to his
[1:08:51] predestinated people saying come out of
[1:08:53] her
[1:08:54] amen he said that just exactly what the
[1:08:56] voice was he's got people all
[1:08:58] out in there all out through babylon
[1:09:00] come out of her
[1:09:01] let you be not partakers of her sins yes
[1:09:04] they're out of that dogma and creates to
[1:09:06] the word
[1:09:07] made spirit and life amen
[1:09:11] that's what god can do and here in
[1:09:13] revelation 19 i may have kept some of
[1:09:15] this in here yes
[1:09:16] revelation 19 7 let us be glad and
[1:09:18] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[1:09:20] marriage of the lamb has come
[1:09:21] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:09:23] notice this messenger had to come
[1:09:25] this angel had to come in order for this
[1:09:27] bride to come
[1:09:30] his wife hath made herself ready in
[1:09:31] verse 8 and to her was granted
[1:09:33] that she should be arrayed in fine linen
[1:09:35] clean and white for the final enemies
[1:09:37] the righteousness of saints
[1:09:38] and he saith unto me right blessed are
[1:09:40] they which are called unto the marriage
[1:09:42] supper of the lamb
[1:09:43] and he saith unto me these are the true
[1:09:45] sayings of god
[1:09:46] and i fell at his feet notice to worship
[1:09:48] him
[1:09:50] who the angel the one that come down
[1:09:53] lighting the earth he's so powerful
[1:09:56] he said i fell at his feet to worship
[1:09:58] him he said to me see thou do it not
[1:10:00] i am thy fellow servant and of thy
[1:10:02] brethren have the testimony of jesus
[1:10:04] worship god
[1:10:05] for the testimony of jesus is the spirit
[1:10:07] of prophecy
[1:10:10] paul says are not they all ministering
[1:10:12] spirits
[1:10:14] they're not jesus he's better than the
[1:10:17] angels he's better than the messenger
[1:10:18] he's better than the pastor he's better
[1:10:20] even the messenger of the age
[1:10:22] amen but thank god god sends angels
[1:10:30] you've got to recognize it as an angel
[1:10:31] the old testament is full of stories
[1:10:33] where the angel would come and the
[1:10:35] person wouldn't recognize what it is
[1:10:38] and you remember when jacob is wrestles
[1:10:40] with an angel
[1:10:42] he wrestles with an angel the angel
[1:10:45] went as if he would go on he just passed
[1:10:47] by the camp
[1:10:49] and something about the way that he
[1:10:51] operated something about what he was
[1:10:53] doing
[1:10:54] alerted jacob to the fact i got i gotta
[1:10:57] wrestle with this man
[1:10:59] he got he got something for me there's
[1:11:01] something about it i got
[1:11:02] i need a change in my walk i need a
[1:11:05] change in my life
[1:11:05] and this man is able to tell me what i
[1:11:08] need he's able to tell me my identity
[1:11:11] hallelujah and jacob probably couldn't
[1:11:13] put that into words he probably couldn't
[1:11:15] couldn't explain it by himself but there
[1:11:17] was something inside of him
[1:11:18] that said this man is going to tell me
[1:11:20] who i am this man is going to tell me
[1:11:23] something about this this angel that god
[1:11:25] he come down
[1:11:26] by the way if we can only grab hold of
[1:11:28] the word like that today there's
[1:11:29] something about this message of the hour
[1:11:31] that'll get that'll reveal my identity
[1:11:34] there's something about what god said in
[1:11:35] this hour
[1:11:36] that'll show me that i'm not jacob i'm a
[1:11:39] i'm israel a prince with god
[1:11:41] not just a shy strum not just who i was
[1:11:44] but i've had a name change and identity
[1:11:47] change amen
[1:11:52] amen
[1:11:55] i just want to do some
[1:11:58] teaching tonight so y'all hang with me
[1:12:04] i'm looking god's word good
[1:12:09] he said now brother brown said now true
[1:12:12] angel
[1:12:13] he said now you're going to throw back
[1:12:14] joseph smith and so forth to me you know
[1:12:16] there's another objection people bring
[1:12:18] up
[1:12:18] you talk to them about the message of
[1:12:19] the hour and i've been thinking about
[1:12:20] this because i've had many opportunities
[1:12:23] since i've been here people come in that
[1:12:24] door
[1:12:24] and to talk to them about an angel
[1:12:26] messenger and about a message that comes
[1:12:28] in our day
[1:12:29] and people watch our services not just
[1:12:31] from messaged churches but people from
[1:12:34] the area
[1:12:35] and that come by and they see the church
[1:12:36] on the side of the road and i'm thankful
[1:12:38] that we're
[1:12:39] available like that that people can see
[1:12:40] it because there's got to be a
[1:12:42] predestinated seat out there somewhere
[1:12:46] and i've had the opportunity to talk to
[1:12:48] several people about this and it it's
[1:12:50] been on my mind that
[1:12:52] you know and i told you about the young
[1:12:53] man to come in and i've not seen him
[1:12:55] again but that young man come in a while
[1:12:56] back and said do you
[1:12:57] he proposed to me the question he said
[1:12:59] do you believe that god could still work
[1:13:01] through prophets today
[1:13:03] i said yes i do believe that let me tell
[1:13:06] you about a prophet
[1:13:08] that god worked through and see i
[1:13:10] believe god sends people by our way for
[1:13:12] that reason
[1:13:14] but one of the objections that people
[1:13:16] throw out there is well
[1:13:17] aren't you just like the mormons see
[1:13:19] joseph smith was visited by angels in
[1:13:21] fact
[1:13:22] he wasn't just visited by an angel he
[1:13:24] was visited i think by 28
[1:13:26] angels and i don't mean to make light of
[1:13:29] it but it just
[1:13:31] it didn't make any sense
[1:13:34] but brother branham said this he said
[1:13:36] you're going to throw back joseph smith
[1:13:38] and so forth to me but watch
[1:13:40] he said it don't work with the scripture
[1:13:43] a real true angel will come and
[1:13:45] vindicate the scripture to the dot
[1:13:49] he said notice he said that john fell
[1:13:51] down and wanted to worship that angel
[1:13:54] and he said see that you do it not now
[1:13:56] remember when those angels come to
[1:13:57] joseph smith he fell down before him
[1:14:01] brother branham never did that he fell
[1:14:04] down before christ he saw
[1:14:05] jesus twice i think he said but he fell
[1:14:09] down before him but he never worshiped
[1:14:10] the angel
[1:14:12] joseph smith fell down before the angel
[1:14:16] and the angel received the worship
[1:14:19] and the the mormons today will say oh we
[1:14:22] don't we don't worship angels joseph
[1:14:23] smith didn't worship angels but he
[1:14:24] prostrated
[1:14:25] himself before him a true angel he said
[1:14:29] won't be worshipped
[1:14:31] he said it's not worship of angels it's
[1:14:33] a ministry of angels
[1:14:35] that comes from god amen
[1:14:39] the angel is a servant
[1:14:42] he comes from the throne room of god he
[1:14:44] comes from god's presence
[1:14:45] and he says i'm sent from the presence
[1:14:47] of god to tell you
[1:14:49] very bad amen
[1:14:52] now angels in the new testament the book
[1:14:55] of acts
[1:14:56] the next instance that we find is in
[1:14:57] acts chapter 8 verse 26 i hope i'm not
[1:15:00] boring you tonight
[1:15:01] but you just stay with me acts chapter 8
[1:15:03] and verse 26
[1:15:05] it says the angel of the lord spaking to
[1:15:07] philip saying
[1:15:08] rise and go toward the south until the
[1:15:10] way that goeth down from jerusalem to
[1:15:12] gaza
[1:15:12] which is desert one of the other
[1:15:14] objections that people have is they say
[1:15:16] well if an angel would come
[1:15:18] why would god send an angel to
[1:15:20] commission a prophet
[1:15:21] why wouldn't he just do that himself but
[1:15:24] you find again in the book of acts that
[1:15:26] god does that very thing
[1:15:28] that he sends an angel down to a man
[1:15:30] named philip and tells him what to do
[1:15:34] right so the angel come to philip and
[1:15:35] said go down toward the south onto the
[1:15:37] way that go down from jerusalem to gaza
[1:15:39] which is desert what did he tell brother
[1:15:40] branham he told him go pray for
[1:15:42] god's sick people right i sent you to
[1:15:45] pray for the sick kings and monarchs and
[1:15:47] so forth and so
[1:15:49] it's the same thing so again the people
[1:15:51] in
[1:15:52] you tell that story in that first church
[1:15:54] they wouldn't have batted an eye
[1:15:57] this was happening all over the place
[1:16:00] right but today it seems strange
[1:16:04] and you might ask the question well why
[1:16:06] didn't the angel do it himself
[1:16:09] again but that's not how god works
[1:16:12] usually
[1:16:13] now the angel something sometimes it's
[1:16:14] in reverse order sometimes the angel
[1:16:16] prepares the way and then the messenger
[1:16:18] comes
[1:16:19] and we'll get to that in a moment but
[1:16:21] but usually
[1:16:23] usually god will send an angel to a man
[1:16:26] a heavenly messenger to an earthly
[1:16:28] messenger who then goes to the people
[1:16:32] right that's usually both the old and
[1:16:34] new testament how it works
[1:16:36] he would come to a prophet an angel
[1:16:37] would come to a prophet or to a great a
[1:16:39] righteous man somewhere
[1:16:41] or to a woman for that matter angels
[1:16:43] come to women in the bible
[1:16:44] do you know that angels come to him it
[1:16:47] was just limited to men but he would
[1:16:48] come to them and then they would tell
[1:16:49] the angel's message you remember what
[1:16:51] happened to mary and the others
[1:16:52] there at the tomb the angel come to him
[1:16:55] and told him go tell my disciples
[1:17:00] the very first thing that they ever had
[1:17:02] to do those disciples had to listen to a
[1:17:04] woman's testimony
[1:17:09] and a bunch of guys you know big burly
[1:17:11] men like that fishermen and
[1:17:13] tax collectors they were men's you know
[1:17:16] uh men's men or whatever
[1:17:20] they were manly men and here come these
[1:17:23] women who said hey we know something you
[1:17:24] don't
[1:17:27] some angels come and told us he's risen
[1:17:30] amen brother branham says this about
[1:17:34] about that he said oh lord he said wake
[1:17:37] up the church right quick lord he's
[1:17:38] praying
[1:17:39] he said and i'm sure you'll do it you
[1:17:42] said one time when you looked upon the
[1:17:43] harvest and said laborers are few
[1:17:46] pray the lord of the harvest that he
[1:17:48] will send laborers into his harvest
[1:17:51] he said now father we know that you want
[1:17:52] us to ask we're partners with you
[1:17:56] it's got to be us together he said we
[1:17:58] realize
[1:17:59] not even an angel can do it it takes men
[1:18:04] do we believe the words of a prophet
[1:18:06] today not even an angel can do it it
[1:18:08] takes them in he said philip was sent to
[1:18:10] the eunuch
[1:18:11] he said certainly lord he was sent there
[1:18:14] by an angel
[1:18:15] but it took philip's hands amen
[1:18:19] he said we realized a vision came to
[1:18:21] paul on his road down to
[1:18:22] damascus but it took ananias hands
[1:18:27] amen he said the church the called out
[1:18:30] the elected one
[1:18:31] peter was sent by vision up to cornelius
[1:18:34] but it took the apostle not the vision
[1:18:36] not the angel
[1:18:38] amen say oh god would only speak to me
[1:18:41] if he would only tell me what he wants
[1:18:43] me to know he tells you on sunday
[1:18:44] morning he tells you on wednesday night
[1:18:46] he tells you through the week if you
[1:18:48] listen to the prophet speaking on tape
[1:18:50] or
[1:18:50] however you listen to it he tells you
[1:18:52] all the time
[1:18:55] he don't just many times you don't come
[1:18:57] to us directly although he can do that
[1:18:59] but what does he do he sends this bin
[1:19:01] amen he sends messengers to come and
[1:19:03] tell us what we have need of
[1:19:08] hallelujah say why because that's the
[1:19:10] way he chose to do it
[1:19:14] it was hidden you go and study that
[1:19:16] sometimes god was hidden in simplicity
[1:19:18] because he was hidden in flesh
[1:19:21] hidden behind the veil of flesh
[1:19:24] huh it was too simple because he come
[1:19:27] and hid himself behind human flesh and
[1:19:29] people said this
[1:19:30] flesh we know what flesh is it can't be
[1:19:32] right
[1:19:34] because the only witness to it is him
[1:19:36] well that's the way it usually happened
[1:19:38] in the bible
[1:19:41] is that god would speak to one man and
[1:19:44] then that one man would come to the
[1:19:46] people and tell him about it
[1:19:49] so it's a watch i mean today people want
[1:19:51] affidavits they want the newspapers to
[1:19:53] carry it
[1:19:54] they want to go back and study it all
[1:19:56] out and find out did it happen
[1:19:58] you realize that the newspapers are
[1:19:59] controlled by the devil
[1:20:02] huh right or the democrat party one or
[1:20:06] the other maybe
[1:20:07] maybe the same thing
[1:20:12] but it is it's controlled the the world
[1:20:14] powers that be one of the
[1:20:15] greatest powers there is in the world is
[1:20:17] the power of the press
[1:20:19] it's controlled by the devil why would
[1:20:21] you ever expect they can't even write
[1:20:23] if there's an accident down here on the
[1:20:24] four lane they can't even write about
[1:20:26] the accident correctly
[1:20:27] and we know that's right they don't ever
[1:20:29] give all the details to their brother
[1:20:30] joe they don't ever
[1:20:31] get it all right huh and a lot of times
[1:20:34] they don't know nothing about it's just
[1:20:35] an agenda they already have a
[1:20:36] pre-printed story and just change the
[1:20:38] names and the dates
[1:20:40] and if you're good at noticing patterns
[1:20:42] you can go through the news and notice
[1:20:43] patterns over and over again
[1:20:44] every time there's a shooting they call
[1:20:46] for gun control i don't mean to get
[1:20:47] political but every time it happens
[1:20:49] every time
[1:20:51] because it's controlled by by a
[1:20:53] worldview it's controlled by the enemy
[1:20:56] all politics is conservative liberal
[1:20:59] whatever it is it's all controlled by
[1:21:00] the enemy
[1:21:02] and so is the press so you're not going
[1:21:04] to find vindication through that
[1:21:07] but it's got to be something that speaks
[1:21:08] to you that voice from heaven that
[1:21:11] speaks to you
[1:21:11] that says this is the word this isn't a
[1:21:13] mormon this isn't something else this is
[1:21:15] what god said he would do in the bible
[1:21:18] amen amen but he said it took
[1:21:23] he said the apostle not the vision not
[1:21:25] the angel he said god
[1:21:26] i pray tonight listen to a prophet's
[1:21:28] prayer i pray tonight that you'll wake
[1:21:30] people up
[1:21:31] and let them see that the promise is
[1:21:33] here
[1:21:34] amen oh i pray that you'll wake people
[1:21:38] up and let them see
[1:21:39] that the promise is here it was given to
[1:21:41] that church he said whosoever sin you
[1:21:43] remit
[1:21:43] to them you're remitted so i'm waiting
[1:21:46] on an angel maybe you're the angel god
[1:21:48] wants to send
[1:21:54] a messenger earthly and heavenly
[1:21:56] messengers now
[1:21:57] this is the attitude brother branham had
[1:21:58] and we'll move on but the attitude
[1:22:00] brother branham had towards earthly
[1:22:01] messengers was this he said young
[1:22:03] preacher get into the field
[1:22:05] i've taken this as a personal challenge
[1:22:07] in my life
[1:22:08] stay into the harness stay into the
[1:22:12] harness he said brother ben
[1:22:13] nobody let me preach stay in the harness
[1:22:16] stay in the harness keep studying keep
[1:22:18] keep preparing keep getting keep being
[1:22:20] ready because they'll come a day god
[1:22:22] will use you he may only use you one
[1:22:23] time
[1:22:24] he don't have to use you any more than
[1:22:26] that but stay in the harness he said
[1:22:28] young preacher get into the field
[1:22:29] stay into the harness he said all you
[1:22:32] young preachers and things don't you sit
[1:22:33] around
[1:22:34] don't you just sit and do nothing get
[1:22:36] out yonder and win a soul
[1:22:38] everybody wants to preach up here but
[1:22:40] there's a lot more to it than that
[1:22:42] huh i thank god for young men god's
[1:22:45] given us in this church that don't
[1:22:47] they they've never put pressure on me to
[1:22:49] preach and i appreciate that it makes me
[1:22:50] want to
[1:22:51] preach them more and i've tried to
[1:22:52] preach them more than they have preached
[1:22:54] but
[1:22:55] but i appreciate that it means a lot but
[1:22:58] there is something that we can do
[1:23:00] he said well i'm not just a preacher but
[1:23:02] you're a witness
[1:23:04] and brother brother said if you don't
[1:23:05] know anything else tell them how the
[1:23:06] fire got lit
[1:23:09] i got some good advice years ago from
[1:23:10] brother ivy that i never forgot on a
[1:23:12] telephone call
[1:23:13] i was going to preach for him the first
[1:23:14] time he said brother ben he said as
[1:23:16] message people we expect
[1:23:18] a person to be right when they preach to
[1:23:21] be correct about what they're saying
[1:23:23] because we're not living in the time of
[1:23:24] denomination anymore
[1:23:26] we expect when a man preaches that what
[1:23:28] he says is going to be right
[1:23:30] if he says something that's wrong people
[1:23:32] shut you down
[1:23:33] and so it's harder in some ways to get
[1:23:35] into a message pulpit than any other
[1:23:37] place
[1:23:38] and it should be because you you should
[1:23:40] have something to say
[1:23:42] we're not here just just wasting our
[1:23:44] time just spinning in the wind it's got
[1:23:46] to be anointed there's got to be
[1:23:47] something that's right it's going to be
[1:23:48] something for the hour
[1:23:49] that's for the day that you're living in
[1:23:52] and so but he told me this he said david
[1:23:55] used what he knew
[1:23:57] all he knew was a rock and a and a
[1:23:59] slingshot but he used what he knew
[1:24:01] and i've taken that and i've taken this
[1:24:04] in my ministry
[1:24:05] as through the years that i've been
[1:24:06] preaching he said don't just sit and do
[1:24:08] nothing
[1:24:08] get out you underwent a soul use what
[1:24:10] you've got you've got a testimony
[1:24:14] i hear some of you sometimes i'll hear
[1:24:16] your testimony and some of you i don't
[1:24:17] even know your testimony yet but
[1:24:19] those of you who have talked to me about
[1:24:20] it you you'll tell me how you come to
[1:24:21] the message of the hour what you've been
[1:24:23] through in your life
[1:24:23] some of the things that you've been
[1:24:24] through and it encourages me
[1:24:27] i know it would be an encouragement to
[1:24:28] somebody else
[1:24:30] it's an encouragement to me when i hear
[1:24:32] it tell your testimony go out you
[1:24:34] underwent a soul
[1:24:35] maybe you're not very good at telling
[1:24:36] but you can support somebody who does
[1:24:39] but he said get out you underwent a soul
[1:24:40] do something get on get moving don't
[1:24:42] stop
[1:24:42] he said young preacher over there god
[1:24:43] bless your heart brother branham never
[1:24:45] told him to stop
[1:24:47] he never told him to stay home and go
[1:24:48] get a job
[1:24:51] no if god's using them go and be used
[1:24:54] that was paul's attitude too paul's
[1:24:55] attitude was
[1:24:57] and i don't believe a minister should
[1:24:58] have a job unless his job is ministry
[1:25:01] right huh he said he got to provide for
[1:25:04] his family
[1:25:05] if not he's worse than an infidel right
[1:25:08] but but but you understand what i'm
[1:25:09] saying don't just sit and do nothing
[1:25:12] there's a world out there there you say
[1:25:14] well there only may only be one left and
[1:25:16] that one's probably in africa we don't
[1:25:17] know that
[1:25:19] you may walk in these doors next sunday
[1:25:21] morning
[1:25:24] and you've disqualified yourself so much
[1:25:26] i don't know who i'm preaching to
[1:25:27] tonight but just
[1:25:28] just hang with me for a moment we
[1:25:29] disqualify ourselves so much that we
[1:25:31] don't even want to talk to people
[1:25:33] well if this person knew what i was like
[1:25:35] and knew what i was i'm not always a
[1:25:36] perfect christian and i don't always
[1:25:38] think and say the right things
[1:25:39] but you don't understand just being
[1:25:41] friendly that somebody that come in the
[1:25:42] door could make a world of difference
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:47] but in the back of our minds so many
[1:25:49] times there's this there's this
[1:25:50] scarecrow that says well if they knew
[1:25:52] what we believed about angels and
[1:25:53] visitation all this stuff they'd think
[1:25:54] we were crazy
[1:25:55] well so what but if they knew the bible
[1:26:00] but i tell you what you'd be surprised
[1:26:02] how many how many people are sitting in
[1:26:03] a dead cold church somewhere
[1:26:05] in some denominational system that wish
[1:26:07] they had some
[1:26:08] some element of the supernatural in
[1:26:10] their life
[1:26:14] we find angels lastly giving
[1:26:17] instructions to believers acts chapter
[1:26:19] 10 and verse 1.
[1:26:23] see we haven't even got to peter and
[1:26:26] paul and all the other angels that
[1:26:27] visited
[1:26:29] men in acts and we won't get to those
[1:26:31] tonight but let's just take this one
[1:26:33] and then we'll close acts chapter 10 and
[1:26:34] verse one there's a certain man in
[1:26:36] caesarea called cornelius i don't know
[1:26:39] if i pronounced that correctly
[1:26:42] a centurion of the band called the
[1:26:44] italian band
[1:26:46] in other words he was he was way up in
[1:26:48] the military
[1:26:50] a devout man one that feared god with
[1:26:52] all his house
[1:26:53] which gave much alms to the people and
[1:26:55] prayed to god always
[1:26:57] god sees your generosity it doesn't go
[1:26:59] unnoticed by god
[1:27:01] right and god sees i'm when you pray
[1:27:05] you don't don't think that he don't see
[1:27:07] it he may not answer the way you want
[1:27:09] him to but don't think you don't see it
[1:27:12] this man prayed to god and gave alms to
[1:27:14] the people and he saw
[1:27:15] in the vision evidently or if i
[1:27:18] understand that correctly it means that
[1:27:20] when he saw the vision it was it was
[1:27:21] very clear to him
[1:27:23] he saw about the ninth hour of the day
[1:27:25] an angel of god coming into him
[1:27:27] and it shows us that because the ninth
[1:27:28] hour of day he wouldn't be sleeping
[1:27:30] he wouldn't be asleep so it's not a
[1:27:33] dream it's a vision
[1:27:34] and he saw an angel of god coming into
[1:27:36] him and saying unto him cornelius
[1:27:40] i know you think about the language
[1:27:41] that's used there brother brown talks
[1:27:43] about that angel
[1:27:43] he heard the footsteps bare feet on the
[1:27:46] floor
[1:27:48] and he saw that light and then he saw
[1:27:49] this angel come in step into the light
[1:27:52] and here it says an angel in the night
[1:27:54] there of the day an angel of god coming
[1:27:56] into him
[1:27:57] maybe walking through the door just like
[1:27:59] that
[1:28:01] why would an angel need to go through a
[1:28:02] door i don't know he can dissolve into a
[1:28:05] rainbow you've heard billy paul's
[1:28:06] testimony about that he can do whatever
[1:28:08] he wants to
[1:28:10] huh but but he chose to come to the door
[1:28:13] and he come into him
[1:28:15] however he got there he come into him
[1:28:17] amen and
[1:28:18] he saw that and sent him cornelius and
[1:28:20] when he looked on him he was afraid
[1:28:23] and see when you when you come to an
[1:28:25] angel it's always it makes you happy
[1:28:28] but an angel is a fearful thing brother
[1:28:30] branham said when he saw christ he said
[1:28:32] he was a man
[1:28:33] he said that look like just one word the
[1:28:35] whole world would be judged
[1:28:37] but he said it was also the most loving
[1:28:39] face that you ever could see
[1:28:43] but he was that kind of a man he had
[1:28:45] authority and this angel had authority
[1:28:48] he said and he looked on him he was
[1:28:49] afraid and said what is it lord
[1:28:51] and he said unto him thy prayers and
[1:28:52] thine arms or come up for a memorial
[1:28:55] before god
[1:28:57] amen you think god forgives god don't
[1:28:58] forget
[1:29:01] they've come up for a memorial before
[1:29:02] god now send men to joppa
[1:29:05] and call for one simon whose surname is
[1:29:07] peter
[1:29:08] he lodges with one simon and tanner
[1:29:11] we've seen specifics like this before
[1:29:13] haven't we
[1:29:14] you live on such and such a street your
[1:29:16] address is your name is
[1:29:18] amen go put that you wanna you wanna
[1:29:20] build some faith go put that in the
[1:29:21] message sometime
[1:29:22] go put into the message infobase put
[1:29:24] your name is
[1:29:27] huh your name is in quotes
[1:29:30] put it in there you'll find hundreds and
[1:29:32] hundreds and hundreds of times
[1:29:34] where brother branham tells somebody
[1:29:36] where they come from their name what
[1:29:38] their name was
[1:29:40] it would be impossible for him to
[1:29:42] memorize all those names
[1:29:46] and many times they didn't even have
[1:29:47] prayer cards sister brown didn't have a
[1:29:49] prayer card he said mr brown
[1:29:50] what was it he knew her name because god
[1:29:52] spoke the angel was there
[1:29:56] and it revealed to him in a vision but
[1:29:57] now he knew cornelius's name and he
[1:29:59] begins to tell these specifics he
[1:30:01] he lodges with one simon of tanner whose
[1:30:03] house is by the seaside
[1:30:04] he shall tell you what thou art us to do
[1:30:07] when the angel which spake in the
[1:30:08] cornelius was departed
[1:30:09] he called two of his household servants
[1:30:12] and a devout soldier of them that waited
[1:30:13] on him continually
[1:30:15] when he had declared all these things
[1:30:16] unto them he sent them to joppa
[1:30:20] you know watch he sent them to japan
[1:30:21] because he knew that they would he
[1:30:23] called it a devout soldier he didn't
[1:30:24] just tell everybody about it
[1:30:26] but he told somebody you knew he would
[1:30:27] believe and he went
[1:30:29] because he had a mission for him to do
[1:30:31] when he declared all these things unto
[1:30:32] them he sent them to joppa
[1:30:34] and so i would ask you tonight does god
[1:30:36] still work like that
[1:30:41] could god prepare the way
[1:30:45] i've seen him do it i've seen days when
[1:30:48] i was
[1:30:48] going to preach and i knew i was going
[1:30:50] to preach and i just couldn't get the
[1:30:51] mind of the lord oh once the presence
[1:30:52] come in the room and all at once i began
[1:30:54] to find out
[1:30:55] and it just began to flow and i just all
[1:30:57] of a sudden it took me about
[1:30:59] and it's this way you know if you're
[1:31:00] studying for a sermon but allan knows
[1:31:01] this is true
[1:31:02] if you're studying for a sermon and you
[1:31:04] have to dig it out yourself it could
[1:31:05] take
[1:31:06] days or you could take hour after hour
[1:31:08] but if there's something clicks all of a
[1:31:10] sudden you get that inspiration
[1:31:11] and you know you got it for some reason
[1:31:14] why because an angel
[1:31:15] i believe the angel god prepares the way
[1:31:17] we don't know why we say it but god
[1:31:19] knows
[1:31:21] and maybe he would go to your house and
[1:31:23] prepare the way maybe you don't even
[1:31:24] recognize him because you're busy and
[1:31:26] you're going through life just for
[1:31:27] everyday life just going on it's going
[1:31:29] about
[1:31:30] your business all of us in a presence of
[1:31:32] god comes in
[1:31:33] see we've got to stay where we can
[1:31:34] contact him stay where we can
[1:31:37] where we can feel it where we can know
[1:31:38] when he's there
[1:31:40] so many times we get so busy we just
[1:31:42] don't know it but he prepares the way i
[1:31:45] believe he still does that today
[1:31:46] i know he did brother branham's ministry
[1:31:49] brother brown tells a story in a sermon
[1:31:51] in 1948 called
[1:31:52] called the angel of god i won't read the
[1:31:55] whole story to save time but
[1:31:57] he tells a story about a woman who saw
[1:31:59] the angel of the lord and saw that with
[1:32:00] hair
[1:32:00] dark hair to his shoulders white robe he
[1:32:04] said
[1:32:04] she had never heard about the angel
[1:32:06] visiting him
[1:32:07] but she was telling the people that were
[1:32:09] there about this
[1:32:11] and she saw the angel of the lord she
[1:32:13] didn't know that it was the angel of the
[1:32:14] lord
[1:32:16] and she saw the same angel he saw and
[1:32:18] she
[1:32:19] when she was sick she was telling the
[1:32:21] people after she'd been prayed for she
[1:32:22] was telling them
[1:32:23] who was that man with brother branham
[1:32:25] who was that man with brother branham
[1:32:28] and brother branham tells us that this
[1:32:30] angel did not pray for the sick
[1:32:33] but she told him she said there was a
[1:32:35] man standing by you watching you as you
[1:32:37] prayed for the sick
[1:32:39] that's good enough for me
[1:32:44] she said that man that brother branham
[1:32:46] saul come in and give him his commission
[1:32:47] was standing there watching him
[1:32:50] as he prayed for the sick and so he's
[1:32:52] praying for the sick and
[1:32:54] and brother branham says now that's the
[1:32:56] angel of god
[1:32:57] he said he's been seen many times in the
[1:32:59] services
[1:33:00] he said and i know that he's here
[1:33:02] tonight i know that he's here he said
[1:33:04] i've felt him three or four times since
[1:33:05] i've been here
[1:33:06] now see brother branham didn't always
[1:33:07] see him but he knew when he was there
[1:33:11] and even the people could feel the
[1:33:13] presence of that angel
[1:33:15] brother branham would explain that in
[1:33:16] the prayer line that's his presence
[1:33:17] that's
[1:33:18] that's the angel of god now but lebron
[1:33:20] says
[1:33:21] he said now that someone might know he
[1:33:23] said now many people understand
[1:33:25] he's he misunderstands he said now this
[1:33:26] is in no means friends in angel worship
[1:33:28] it is not
[1:33:30] he said i do not pray in the name of the
[1:33:31] angel or even know his name
[1:33:36] do you know that brother brown did not
[1:33:37] know the name of the angel the lord that
[1:33:39] come to him
[1:33:40] he said but if you'll check the
[1:33:42] scriptures he said when god sends his
[1:33:44] people
[1:33:46] it's an angel that directs them
[1:33:50] maybe you've had an angel come to you
[1:33:51] and you don't know it
[1:33:54] maybe an angel sent you to church
[1:33:55] tonight
[1:33:59] when god sends his people
[1:34:02] amen and you see things happen in a
[1:34:05] supernatural way
[1:34:06] because there's evidently been a work of
[1:34:08] the holy spirit through angels or
[1:34:10] whatever way that god works god can work
[1:34:12] any way he wants to
[1:34:13] but you see things happen and so many
[1:34:15] coincidences stack up and you begin to
[1:34:17] think
[1:34:17] god was that you huh was that you
[1:34:21] we saw that we saw that happen with the
[1:34:23] church up here when we
[1:34:25] owe money here on the fellowship hall
[1:34:26] and i don't want to bring this up to
[1:34:28] pat myself on the back or or even the
[1:34:31] brothers and sisters from there but
[1:34:33] but but we saw god do that i believe god
[1:34:36] did that
[1:34:37] put a church up in the middle of nowhere
[1:34:39] across on the wrong side of the railroad
[1:34:40] tracks
[1:34:41] up for sale closed within one week
[1:34:45] for twice as much as i thought they
[1:34:46] would get
[1:34:49] and paid off a fellowship hall that we
[1:34:50] were worried about concerned about
[1:34:53] because of all that we were going
[1:34:54] through
[1:34:56] how do you know that an angel didn't
[1:34:58] visit the buyer
[1:35:02] are you with me now oh you've seen god
[1:35:05] move for you in miraculous ways many
[1:35:07] times and we don't even understand how
[1:35:09] or why
[1:35:10] because we're in this age that we live
[1:35:11] in there's such a darkness on the age
[1:35:13] but just remember he's still working
[1:35:17] very bad god will put something to plant
[1:35:20] a seed
[1:35:21] in somebody's mind let them let them
[1:35:22] feel influenced to do a certain thing
[1:35:24] and you don't know what that is many
[1:35:25] times
[1:35:26] i've seen someone would come to me after
[1:35:27] a service and they're influenced to say
[1:35:30] a certain thing to me
[1:35:31] and i can tell many times they're
[1:35:32] influenced by god to do that
[1:35:34] now sometimes people are influenced by
[1:35:36] the devil too
[1:35:38] that's true they'll come to you right at
[1:35:41] your weakest moment try to tear you down
[1:35:43] but god always when he comes he comes
[1:35:45] not to tear you down but he comes with
[1:35:47] the word
[1:35:48] ah he comes with the word and it's
[1:35:50] something that'll build you up amen
[1:35:53] amen or warn you of some danger
[1:35:56] an angel and you say well does
[1:35:59] this primarily how god works no he
[1:36:01] primarily works to the influence of the
[1:36:03] holy spirit in your life
[1:36:05] but he does work this way
[1:36:11] acts 10 34 peter says we won't read this
[1:36:14] whole sermon but
[1:36:14] in verse 34 he said peter opened his
[1:36:16] mouth instead of a truth i perceive that
[1:36:18] god is no respecter of persons
[1:36:21] why because god sent an angel to
[1:36:23] cornelius and when cornelius told peter
[1:36:25] about it he believed it
[1:36:27] it wasn't strange to him he says
[1:36:30] but in every nation that he that feareth
[1:36:33] him and worketh righteousness is
[1:36:34] accepted with him verse 44
[1:36:36] while peter yet spake these words he
[1:36:39] remember he preaches to him a sermon
[1:36:40] tells them about christ he said while
[1:36:43] peter yet spake these words
[1:36:44] the holy ghost fell on all them which
[1:36:46] heard the word he said well i received
[1:36:48] the holy ghost you can receive a
[1:36:50] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:36:52] while the word is being preached that's
[1:36:55] right
[1:36:56] but they received the holy ghost while
[1:36:58] the word was being preached
[1:37:00] amen it fell on all them which heard the
[1:37:02] word and they of the circumcision which
[1:37:04] believed were astonished
[1:37:06] that god didn't have to use her
[1:37:07] denomination he didn't have to use our
[1:37:09] own way of doing things
[1:37:11] god did it the way god does it in a
[1:37:14] supernatural way amen
[1:37:16] hallelujah some people you know they'll
[1:37:18] drag your feet because they think
[1:37:19] there's no way god could work in this
[1:37:22] there's no way oh that's too much
[1:37:23] emotion or that's too little or too much
[1:37:25] of this too much of that
[1:37:26] there's no way god can use this but when
[1:37:28] god does it you just have to let him do
[1:37:30] it
[1:37:32] and they have the circumcision were
[1:37:33] astonished because
[1:37:35] as many as come with peter because that
[1:37:36] on the gentiles also was poured out the
[1:37:38] gift of the holy ghost
[1:37:40] but they heard them speak with tongues
[1:37:41] to magnify god
[1:37:43] notice they knew that the holy ghost had
[1:37:45] been poured out on them
[1:37:47] now because they heard them speak with
[1:37:50] tongues and magnify god
[1:37:52] and this leads pentecostal people to
[1:37:55] believe well tongues must be the
[1:37:56] evidence of the holy ghost but you can
[1:37:57] find places in the scripture where
[1:37:58] someone does not speak with tongues
[1:38:01] after receiving the holy ghost but it is
[1:38:04] something that's common
[1:38:05] in the new testament it's not foreign
[1:38:10] and i just want to go here for just a
[1:38:12] moment and then we'll close i know i've
[1:38:14] used up all my time but
[1:38:15] they heard them speak with tongues you
[1:38:18] realize a troubling thought come to me
[1:38:19] several years ago
[1:38:21] that some of our message children could
[1:38:23] be raised in church and
[1:38:25] never hear tongues
[1:38:29] and and i don't mean to place it out of
[1:38:31] order because brother brandon put it in
[1:38:32] order
[1:38:33] and the way it should be because of the
[1:38:34] pentecostal church and things that were
[1:38:36] going on
[1:38:37] but there are many people today who have
[1:38:39] never spoken in tongues
[1:38:40] in the message i would say most most
[1:38:43] people
[1:38:44] i've never spoken in tongues i don't
[1:38:45] want to make you feel bad about that
[1:38:46] because
[1:38:47] brother branham only spoke in tongues a
[1:38:48] few times in his life
[1:38:51] right we know he was close to god
[1:38:54] but tongues is a valid expression of the
[1:38:57] holy ghost
[1:38:59] right we haven't done a way we don't
[1:39:01] tear out those those parts of the
[1:39:02] scripture
[1:39:05] i've heard people say that
[1:39:08] god forgive me but now i tell other
[1:39:11] people
[1:39:12] that if you think you shouldn't say you
[1:39:14] shouldn't say it so i'm going to keep my
[1:39:15] mouth shut about that but
[1:39:18] but you know if you the lord's just
[1:39:21] helping me all the time
[1:39:24] but you know if you if you go around and
[1:39:26] let me put it this way if you go around
[1:39:28] you say that
[1:39:30] that uh all they did on the day of
[1:39:31] pentecost was like talking on the
[1:39:32] parking lot after church
[1:39:34] that's not what a prophet said
[1:39:38] he said mary you go look it up what
[1:39:40] brother ram said happened
[1:39:43] he said that was his opinion i'd take
[1:39:44] his over mine
[1:39:48] god's still moves in these ways right
[1:39:51] but again it's not the evidence of the
[1:39:52] holy ghost
[1:39:53] so let's look at that for just a moment
[1:39:55] then we'll close i know i
[1:39:56] promised that four times now
[1:40:00] brother branham says this about about
[1:40:01] tongues he said don't ever face a person
[1:40:03] believe they got the holy ghost because
[1:40:04] they speak in tongues
[1:40:06] see but you believe they have the holy
[1:40:07] ghost because of the fruits that they
[1:40:09] bear for jesus said by their fruits you
[1:40:10] shall know them
[1:40:11] that's right by their fruit we all got
[1:40:13] that
[1:40:15] he said now but but now let me just not
[1:40:17] get away from that now
[1:40:18] he said because i don't want to dishonor
[1:40:20] a great gift that god has given
[1:40:22] and i believe that a spirit-filled man
[1:40:23] or woman or a child that lives under the
[1:40:25] altar of god
[1:40:26] won't live there long until they'll be
[1:40:27] speaking with tongues
[1:40:29] he said see i believe that he will do it
[1:40:31] or she
[1:40:32] he said now you can receive the holy
[1:40:34] ghost and maybe you didn't speak with
[1:40:35] tongues when you got
[1:40:36] it see but if you constantly lay there
[1:40:38] before god all the time
[1:40:40] with baptism after baptism striking you
[1:40:43] something's going to take place you say
[1:40:44] why did they
[1:40:46] speak with tongues because they were so
[1:40:48] full of the spirit of god
[1:40:51] right at some point you've got to be
[1:40:53] full enough of the spirit of god to do
[1:40:55] something beyond what you normally do
[1:40:58] maybe all you normally do is just sit
[1:41:00] there and you get so full of spirit of
[1:41:02] god you can just barely get the hand up
[1:41:03] but it's something
[1:41:07] right and someone said as i said i think
[1:41:09] i said that last wednesday night but
[1:41:11] you know you can you can say well it's
[1:41:13] just a carnal impersonation but
[1:41:15] so it's sitting like a bump on a log
[1:41:18] everybody's impersonating somebody
[1:41:22] right but the ron spencer told me one
[1:41:25] time he said
[1:41:26] everybody said they're afraid of getting
[1:41:27] in the flesh he said how else would you
[1:41:29] worship god
[1:41:32] huh you're in the flesh so you can't
[1:41:34] help it till we're resurrected
[1:41:36] get out of here he said but you didn't
[1:41:38] speak with tongues when you get it he
[1:41:39] said but if you constantly lay there
[1:41:40] before god all the time with baptism
[1:41:42] after baptism striking you something's
[1:41:43] going to have to take place
[1:41:45] he said you'll get so full someday do
[1:41:48] you can't talk nothing else so you try
[1:41:49] to say something you just can't say it
[1:41:50] no more
[1:41:51] you just can't say it many times that
[1:41:52] people realize he said that that was the
[1:41:54] holy spirit they'd go ahead and just
[1:41:56] open their heart up
[1:41:57] and let god speak to them and i've
[1:41:59] watched that
[1:42:00] i watch faces i know i look down quite a
[1:42:02] bit but i also watch people in church
[1:42:05] and i've watched people's faces while
[1:42:07] the preaching of the word is going on
[1:42:08] and you feel that presence of god and
[1:42:10] they don't know what to do with it
[1:42:13] right and they sit there and it's just
[1:42:14] like it's just this expression is i
[1:42:16] don't know what to especially people
[1:42:18] that are new
[1:42:19] you just just have no idea what to do
[1:42:21] with this
[1:42:22] huh and then you see them if they'll
[1:42:24] stick around eventually they'll
[1:42:26] they learn how to respond to that but at
[1:42:29] first many times they'll miss a blessing
[1:42:31] they'll come out of a good service and
[1:42:32] say well
[1:42:33] everybody got blessed everybody was
[1:42:34] excited i don't know why
[1:42:38] because they just still never got that
[1:42:40] full he said but you get so full someday
[1:42:42] till you can't talk nothing else see you
[1:42:43] try to say something you just can't say
[1:42:45] it no more
[1:42:46] he said you just can't say it many times
[1:42:47] when people realize that that holy that
[1:42:49] was the holy spirit
[1:42:50] they go ahead and just open their heart
[1:42:51] up and let god speak to them the bible
[1:42:53] said with stammering lips
[1:42:54] and other tongues while i speak to this
[1:42:56] people isaiah 28 18
[1:42:58] i was stammering lips with other tongues
[1:42:59] while i speak and brother branham
[1:43:01] goes on to demonstrate a stammer listen
[1:43:04] to the tape
[1:43:05] he said i want to ask you brethren have
[1:43:07] you ever felt the holy ghost shake you
[1:43:08] so bad
[1:43:09] you just can't couldn't hardly say
[1:43:11] nothing
[1:43:15] i don't want to listen i don't want to
[1:43:17] have a church
[1:43:18] where it can't happen are you with me
[1:43:22] i i understand not everybody does it
[1:43:25] i understand but i don't want to be
[1:43:27] raised my kids
[1:43:29] in a place where the spirit of god is
[1:43:31] completely shut off
[1:43:35] because i know what he did for me
[1:43:40] i know what it's like to be drunk in the
[1:43:41] spirit of god
[1:43:43] i know what it's like to have the word
[1:43:44] revealed so real to you
[1:43:46] that you forget about everything and you
[1:43:49] just sit there under that word and it
[1:43:50] just keeps flowing and
[1:43:51] keeps flowing i know what that's like
[1:43:54] and i want my kids to be able to
[1:43:55] experience that
[1:43:56] you understand and so i'm not
[1:43:59] if anybody again i'm a cynic by nature
[1:44:02] because of the way i was raised
[1:44:04] but i you can't let that that that way
[1:44:06] that you were raised impact you to the
[1:44:07] point where you can't worship god
[1:44:11] and sure we've all seen lots of
[1:44:13] impersonation but there's there's a reel
[1:44:15] somewhere
[1:44:16] and i believe it's here tonight amen and
[1:44:19] that's the word it's the word that
[1:44:20] changes our lives that's the difference
[1:44:21] in us and the pentecostals we don't do
[1:44:23] it because the music's on
[1:44:24] we worship god because the word amen as
[1:44:27] it's burning in our hearts hallelujah
[1:44:30] amen now
[1:44:34] he said he said you couldn't hardly say
[1:44:37] nothing would just sit quiet sometime to
[1:44:38] sit there and cry how did you do that
[1:44:39] well that's the holy ghost
[1:44:41] he said the reason people don't speak
[1:44:42] with tongues many times they don't know
[1:44:43] how to yield themselves to the spirit
[1:44:45] and they're looking for something way
[1:44:46] off when it's right on them
[1:44:48] he said that's the reason they don't he
[1:44:50] said and then some people just get
[1:44:51] themselves worked up in a motion
[1:44:52] and say a bunch of words has no meaning
[1:44:54] to it and still ain't got the holy ghost
[1:44:58] and try to say they have because they
[1:44:59] spoke in tongues he said but by their
[1:45:00] fruits
[1:45:01] you shall know them they spoke with
[1:45:04] tongues and magnified god the bible says
[1:45:07] but listen why did they hear the word in
[1:45:09] the first place
[1:45:11] musicians go ahead and come i'ma i'm
[1:45:13] gonna stop i'm almost done anyway
[1:45:17] why did they hear the word because an
[1:45:20] angel directed them to the message of
[1:45:22] the hour
[1:45:26] listen they heard the word because they
[1:45:29] were there that day
[1:45:30] you ever thought about that i want to be
[1:45:33] there
[1:45:36] someday god's going to move over you so
[1:45:37] much you might speak with tongues you're
[1:45:39] not going to do that unless you're
[1:45:40] under the spout brother brown talked
[1:45:43] about that
[1:45:44] bride being washed by the water of the
[1:45:45] word he said she can't be washed unless
[1:45:47] you stay under the spout
[1:45:49] unless you stay under that word uh you
[1:45:52] can't be washed if you're not there to
[1:45:53] receive it amen
[1:45:55] because i'm telling you there is a
[1:45:56] difference between the atmosphere here
[1:45:58] and the atmosphere just hearing the tape
[1:46:03] if you don't believe that talk to
[1:46:04] somebody who was in the meetings of
[1:46:05] brother branham
[1:46:06] talk somebody who was there that
[1:46:08] atmosphere that was there and that i
[1:46:09] believe that atmosphere carries on the
[1:46:11] tapes but it's the word that we hear
[1:46:13] but it's different when you're there
[1:46:18] amen you love the lord tonight
[1:46:21] what did the angel do it directed
[1:46:23] cornelius
[1:46:25] to the word amen to an earthly messenger
[1:46:29] who had the word what will
[1:46:30] true a true angel do today it will point
[1:46:33] you back to it
[1:46:34] to the word of god always it'll point
[1:46:36] you to an earthly messenger who has the
[1:46:38] word of god
[1:46:40] amen that's what we do we're not
[1:46:41] glorifying a man the angel wasn't
[1:46:43] glorifying peter but he was pointing
[1:46:45] cornelius to a messenger that could help
[1:46:47] him
[1:46:47] they could preach the word to him so he
[1:46:49] could receive the holy ghost
[1:46:51] listen why don't we see angels today
[1:46:54] because of the veil of flesh
[1:46:58] hebrews 6 and i'll just read verse 19.
[1:47:00] i've got verse 18 verse 19 says
[1:47:03] which hope we have is an acre of the
[1:47:04] soul both sure and steadfast
[1:47:07] which entereth into that within the veil
[1:47:09] the hope that we have
[1:47:10] goes beyond the veil
[1:47:13] this is the veil right
[1:47:17] why don't we see god moving in angelic
[1:47:19] visitations more because of this
[1:47:22] that's me too right this gets in the way
[1:47:26] the veil is the flesh the veil is what
[1:47:29] keeps us from seeing god
[1:47:31] brother branham says face to face in
[1:47:33] this church
[1:47:35] amen the veil he said is what keeps us
[1:47:38] from seeing the angels
[1:47:40] at their positions
[1:47:44] standing by the seats
[1:47:48] and rebecca branham told that story you
[1:47:50] know brother branham would tell how
[1:47:50] there were 300 ushers
[1:47:52] cleared the aisle so he could come down
[1:47:54] and and when he come down to pray
[1:47:55] and then the angel of the lord took to
[1:47:58] his picture the lord
[1:47:58] the pillar of fire had his picture taken
[1:48:00] with the pillar of fire in
[1:48:02] houston and all those ushers cleared the
[1:48:04] way
[1:48:05] and rebecca branham will tell that story
[1:48:06] she said there was no ushers there
[1:48:11] think about that there's no ushers there
[1:48:14] but in a supernatural realm
[1:48:18] a prophet of god is seeing something
[1:48:22] amen and he proved it because he took a
[1:48:24] pillar a picture of the pillar of fire
[1:48:27] with him amen he said the veil is what
[1:48:30] keeps us from seeing the angels at their
[1:48:32] positions this morning
[1:48:33] standing by the seats
[1:48:36] we play surely the presence of the lord
[1:48:38] you know that it's in sea i think
[1:48:44] the angel of the lord visited in the old
[1:48:45] testament a woman named hagar twice
[1:48:49] you remember the story that struck me
[1:48:51] the other day it's what got me thinking
[1:48:53] about angels
[1:48:55] it struck me why would he visit hagar
[1:48:58] twice
[1:48:59] he only visited sarah once
[1:49:04] it's true but the angel of the lord
[1:49:07] visited hagar twice
[1:49:11] the first time when abraham kicked her
[1:49:14] out of the house
[1:49:16] you remember the story or sarah was so
[1:49:18] mean to her she run away the first time
[1:49:21] right and she goes out in the desert and
[1:49:23] is there by a spring of water
[1:49:25] crying and weeping about her situation
[1:49:27] and hey the angel of the lord comes down
[1:49:29] and begins to talk to her and tells her
[1:49:31] don't be afraid of sarah
[1:49:32] go back into abraham's house you've
[1:49:35] heard you've read the story that's i
[1:49:37] believe in genesis chapter 16.
[1:49:39] if you go a few chapters over you'll
[1:49:41] find now ishmael has been born
[1:49:43] and he's getting to about 13 years of
[1:49:45] age he begins to make fun of isaac
[1:49:48] and sarah says the son of that woman is
[1:49:49] not going to be heir with the
[1:49:52] with my child and so sarah
[1:49:55] gets on abraham and abraham asked the
[1:49:56] lord and he said go ahead and send him
[1:49:58] out
[1:49:59] i'll make of him a great nation and he
[1:50:01] says this he said because he is thy seed
[1:50:06] because he is thy seed so an angel
[1:50:08] visited her
[1:50:09] not because of who she was
[1:50:14] but because she had abraham's seed he
[1:50:17] understood she had received seed from
[1:50:18] abraham
[1:50:19] that was his child even though it wasn't
[1:50:21] the
[1:50:22] seed by a promise it was still abraham's
[1:50:25] seed
[1:50:28] amen amen you think about that he said
[1:50:31] he'll be a wild man his hand will be
[1:50:33] against every man you see the muslims
[1:50:34] today
[1:50:35] how they've taken over that part of the
[1:50:36] earth
[1:50:39] why because they're abraham's seed
[1:50:40] natural
[1:50:42] right but god spoke through an angel to
[1:50:45] her the second time she was out there
[1:50:46] and she laid the baby down because they
[1:50:48] were going to die out in the desert
[1:50:50] and the angel the lord come and showed
[1:50:51] her where water was
[1:50:53] and spoke to her and said he won't die
[1:50:55] and god will make a great nation out of
[1:50:57] your son
[1:50:58] why because the boy was abraham's seed
[1:51:01] listen to me if god could do that
[1:51:05] for a boy that was just a natural seed
[1:51:07] not even by the correct
[1:51:08] order that was the seed of a slightly
[1:51:10] doubted promise if he could do that like
[1:51:12] we would say for a denominational system
[1:51:14] for something that wasn't even right if
[1:51:16] she could see an angel not once but
[1:51:18] twice
[1:51:19] that could save her when she was in
[1:51:20] trouble don't you know that god still
[1:51:22] has
[1:51:22] angels today don't you believe that god
[1:51:25] if hagar could see an angel how much
[1:51:27] more could god send his angels down
[1:51:29] in this building tonight he can send his
[1:51:32] angels down
[1:51:33] where you're at tonight that he could
[1:51:34] speak to you and if we could only look
[1:51:36] beyond the veil of flesh we'd see
[1:51:38] they don't always reveal themselves in
[1:51:40] physical form but they're here
[1:51:43] amen what do we believe it
[1:51:47] amen let's bow our heads together
[1:51:49] heavenly father
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:53] i think in the old testament of a time
[1:51:55] when
[1:51:57] elijah elijah the prophet was weary
[1:52:01] and the prophet of god told us that
[1:52:04] there at the juniper tree
[1:52:06] that there was an angel god found the
[1:52:09] angel with the softest hands
[1:52:12] to come down and caress his brow
[1:52:16] just to make him feel a little better
[1:52:18] found an
[1:52:19] angel that could cook to come down and
[1:52:22] cook food
[1:52:23] had vitamins in it that he'd go in the
[1:52:25] strength of it 40 days and 40 nights
[1:52:30] lord if you would do that for your weary
[1:52:33] prophet
[1:52:35] who didn't even have the courage to
[1:52:36] stand anymore
[1:52:38] for the word maybe there's some weary
[1:52:40] ones tonight lord maybe that's us
[1:52:42] tonight on a wednesday night if you do
[1:52:44] that at that moment lord
[1:52:46] i believe you could do it tonight lord
[1:52:49] maybe there's someone here that needs to
[1:52:51] feel the comforting hand of an angel
[1:52:52] maybe there's someone
[1:52:54] who's been through been through
[1:52:57] the worst period of their life they've
[1:53:00] been through the
[1:53:02] the storm that's so dark and so black
[1:53:04] they never thought they'd come out of it
[1:53:07] but you sent an angel in the midst of it
[1:53:10] to speak a messenger from god saying
[1:53:11] it's going to be okay
[1:53:14] i get in when he was hiding down there
[1:53:17] in the in the threshing floor he was
[1:53:18] hiding and the angel the lord come to
[1:53:20] him and said
[1:53:21] get in you're a mighty man of valor oh
[1:53:24] god i pray that would be so tonight
[1:53:26] i know the angels are here i know your
[1:53:28] holy spirit is here
[1:53:30] but i pray god that you would speak i
[1:53:32] pray lord that you would reveal yourself
[1:53:34] i pray lord you'd help us father to push
[1:53:37] beyond the veil of flesh
[1:53:39] maybe sometimes we just need to worship
[1:53:41] a little bit maybe sometimes we need to
[1:53:43] get past our job
[1:53:44] we need to get past what people did to
[1:53:46] us and what they said to us through the
[1:53:47] week
[1:53:48] we need to get past sitting in traffic
[1:53:50] lord sometimes we just need to come
[1:53:52] aside and rest
[1:53:53] for just a few moments and set our minds
[1:53:55] at rest so we can begin to push
[1:53:57] past that veil of flesh to be able to
[1:53:59] see angels standing at their positions
[1:54:02] it's always meant so much to me lord i
[1:54:04] believe it i take that word of a prophet
[1:54:07] today and i believe it
[1:54:08] i believe that the angels are standing
[1:54:10] here because it's based on your word
[1:54:12] which said
[1:54:13] that it encamps around those that
[1:54:14] believe him i pray you'd grant it lord
[1:54:17] i pray you'd move in every life may they
[1:54:19] recognize you
[1:54:21] lord in whatever way you work in our
[1:54:22] lives may we recognize you maybe we'd be
[1:54:24] quick to respond
