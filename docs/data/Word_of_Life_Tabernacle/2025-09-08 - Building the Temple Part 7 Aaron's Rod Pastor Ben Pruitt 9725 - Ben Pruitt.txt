Also, brother Bill told me this morning that he'd had a rough night, but uh he's here this morning. So, we're just believing that the Lord's going to take care of that. And brother Paul actually told me in the foyer coming in that he went to see the doctor and and uh I guess he had a pacemaker. It wasn't working or something and and he said they checked him out and his heart was beating all on its own. So, we thank the Lord for brother for the healing for brother Paul. Man, that's always always good to have a good testimony, brother Paul. And if I got them details wrong, talk to him. He's always got a good testimony for you, brother Paul does, and we appreciate his faith. Amen. If we could, Brother Jared, why don't you uh take these needs to the Lord this morning, buddy?

But we know who we are. &gt;&gt; And if he's fighting you, that means he don't have you. So let the devil keep fighting and we're going to keep winning and overcoming. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Give the Lord another hand clap of praise this morning. This this song here, I I don't think we sing the verses to it very much, but but I want to uh I want to try to sing the verses to this one this morning. I love the verses to this song. And we're going to sing, we'll sing the chorus first and then we'll go right into the verses with all your hearts now. Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord. [Music] Oh, come and quench this thirsting of my soul. Oh bread of heaven, won't you feed me till I want no more? Fill my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Oh. Oh.

Oh, won't you come and quench this deep thirsting of my soul? Oh bread of heaven, won't you feed me till I want no more? Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me whole. Let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we've got our cups right side up this morning. Lord, we want to be made well, made whole. Lord, there's many broken places, I believe, in every one of our hearts and every one of our lives, but Lord, you're healing us. We're so thankful for that. We thank you for that promise, Lord, of complete healing. One day, Father, when our bodies are made new again, we step into another dimension. Thank you for that, Lord. I pray that you would just continue to heal us this morning. Touch every heart, Lord, every every spirit, every soul, every every body, Lord, that may be sick or in need. God, I I don't know how to do it, but I know that you can. And I pray that you would move me out of the way. Diminish me, Lord, so that you might be magnified. I pray you do it this morning. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. Going to read from Numbers chapter 17 and verse 8. Numbers 17 and 8. As we continue to talk about the temple, we're going to go back this morning and talk about Aaron's rod. Spend a little time on that. Numbers chapter 17 and verse 8. And it came to pass that on the marorrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness. And behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds. I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word. You may be seated this morning. Good to have each and every one of you in the house of the Lord. Good to see our visitors today. God bless you. Thank you for being here. And each one of you that are here in the house of the Lord. We believe that that everything can be changed, lives can be changed, and our hearts can be changed in the house of the Lord. Brother Brandham said we either come in uh or we leave better or worse than when we come in. So, how many want to leave better today? That's what we want to do. So, let's just get right into the word of God because that's what does the changing. Uh the the uh rod of Aaron was one of the three original items in the ark. And and it was it's known as Aaron's rod that budded because there were other rods that were placed also in the presence of the shikina that did not bud. So, we know that Aaron's rod was not some random item kept in the ark of the covenant. It wasn't like uh Moses just walked up there and said, "Aaron, why don't you throw your rod in there and see what happens to it?" That that's not the way it happened at all. But it was actually by election. It was placed there on purpose. It was actually a vindication of the ironic priesthood that this was something that said that this is what God was going to use. This is who God was going to use. I would say this morning that you are not in the presence of God by accident this morning. You were placed here. There was a a conspiracy if you will of that God had before time to place you here in this place in this time in your body with the ability to listen and the ability to hear and the ability uh to respond to the word. He put you here for a reason this morning. And and so we need to know what that is. Now uh numbers 16 tells us kind of the the background and the priest story of uh of this uh rod and why it was there. It tells the story of Kora, a man named Kora, a man named Dayathan, a man named Abram, also a man named Anne. And those men are are mentioned in Numbers chapter 16 and verse one. Kora the son of Ishar, the son of Kath, the son of Levi. And then Dayan and Abram the sons of Eliab and Anne, the son of Pelith, sons of Reuben, took men. So they had other men with them. And they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel, 250 princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown. So they didn't come on their own, but this was a genuine movement uh that they had gotten other men on their side to come and and bring this to Moses and to Aaron. Now, we we know that Kora was actually Moses and Aaron's first cousin. So, it was not somebody that wouldn't have known them. It was somebody that grew up with them, that would have been very close to them, especially under the family structure that the Israelites moved under. And his family was actually called to service. They were called to be a part of the priesthood in the sense of they were to they were called to serve around the ark. They were called to serve the tabernacle. They were called actually to carry the ark on their shoulders. They were called to uh sing in in the sanctuary. They were called to do those things, but they were not called to the holy things. So, they were not to come into the holy of holies or to touch those things. And so, it was when the ark moved, it was actually covered by the sons of Aaron before it was moved. The holy of holies was never to be seen. The ark was never to actually be seen, but it was covered with badger skins and was not to be touched by anyone else except the son of Aaron. So, you can imagine how that must have felt to to Kora and his family that they walked up there and said, "Well, aren't we as holy as you are? Are we able like these other men are to touch these things?" And yet God had made a choice. And when God makes a choice, we ought to accept that choice that God makes. So Kora uh you know he comes before him for that reason. We find that Kora's family they did have a job. They did have a purpose but it wasn't to serve in the holy things. Numbers chapter 4 and verse 15. When Aaron had his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary and all the vessels of the sanctuary as the campus is set forward. After that the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it but they shall not touch any holy thing lest they die. So all of the So here was Moses and Aaron and here was Aaron's family was to be the priest and anybody else was was to serve but not to touch right not to view it not to touch it but just to serve in it. So he said they shall not touch any holy thing lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation. So they had a job an important job to do but it wouldn't be with the holy things. Now they were to be burdenbearers and this service was to continue. In Numbers 4:17, the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, "Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kathites from among the Levites, but thus do unto them that they may live." So in other words, make it where they they are not uh going into the Holy of Holies to be subject to death by touching something that they shouldn't touch. But but he said this, "Do this to them. When they approach under the most holy things, Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden." So what had to happen is when they would come in to the sanctuary, a son of Aaron or Aaron himself had to stand there and say, "Now you pick this up and you pick this up and you put you bear this burden and you roll this up." And so they become like a management over the the Korites and the Kathites. And so he said, "But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die." Now, if you're just thinking carnally and you're sitting back and you're looking and say, "Well, I've known Moses ever since he was a little baby and got and got put in the river. I've known uh I've known Aaron all of his life. I've known all these men. I know that they're just normal, natural men. I know that they're just a human like everybody else. And they're not the only ones that are holy. We came out just like everybody else did. So, we've got a right to do just like they do. And it must have looked like nepotism. It must have looked like Moses was just setting up his family to do everything. But it wasn't that at all. But God had chosen Aaron to do what he did. And God had chosen Moses to do what he did. Now, here's their complaint in number 16 and three. He said, "They gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, you take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them." Now, that's a true statement, &gt;&gt; right? It's a true statement. You take too much upon you. The Lord is among them. That that's true. The Lord was among the congregation. All the congregation was holy. But not all of them were called to do what Moses did. Not all of them were called to do what Aaron did. &gt;&gt; But it was a different calling. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they were right about that. But Moses did not choose himself. God chose Moses. &gt;&gt; And Moses was not just any prophet. He was a word prophet. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandon picks this up when he was in South Africa. He picks up this idea of being disputed with with a word prophet. So, Brother Brandham has men that go with him and they have an itinerary. And the Lord speaks to Brother Brandham and says, "Go to the natives." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Go to the natives. And these men uh were going to South Africa. And they said, "No, we're going to go to the white population, have these meetings here and there." And he said, "But the Lord told me to go to the natives." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And the Lord told him even to go hunting among the natives, right? And it seemed like, "Well, brother Brandon, you just want to go hunting. You don't want to you don't want to preach." And they had a an itinerary all set out for him. But what they were doing was disputing with the word prophet. And brother Brandham makes that very clear that they that's what they were doing. And he said he said he said God they said God has also spoken to us and brother Brandham went with them but he said we nearly all died right because of that. So in in in Jude 11 see we find that Jude said woe unto them for they've gone in the way of Cain. So there were some folks in the New Testament who were doing the same thing that Kora did ran greedily after the error error of Balum for reward and perish in the gains of Kora. What was the the gains of Kora? again saying is antilogia. It's a contradiction, hostility, rebellion, and refers to rebellion or strife or contradiction. And and you know, I want to be careful with this because makes it sound like, well, you can't disagree with the pastor. Well, I'm not Moses, &gt;&gt; right? I I don't have that job. Thank God for that. I'm not a vindicated prophet. I'm just a pastor. I You can argue with me. In fact, you could argue with brother Brandham, right? You can argue with a preacher, but the problem comes when you dispute with the revealed word, &gt;&gt; right? That a prophet brings. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You You can argue, but you can't argue with the word. You can dispute, but you can't dispute with a vindicated message. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So, we we want to be careful now. If we're going to be a church that that that is living, and we need to be a church that's alive, we need to be a church that's bearing fruit. We need to be a church that that has the love of God among them and the power of God among them and and we want to see sinners saved. We want to see people come into the presence of God and be changed. If we want to be like that, then we've got to be in a place where the word of God is elevated where we will not stand against the word prophet. We will not stand against the revealed word of the hour. Even if we are spiritual men, if if if God brought it in our day for us to consume, we ought to consume it. If God brought it in our day for us to hear, we ought to hear it. &gt;&gt; So, so one man in a generation could do what Moses did. And Kora could not take that place. But but brother Brandham said talked about how Kora's pride wouldn't let him submit to Moses's place that he had. And so he tried to impersonate. &gt;&gt; They they were not satisfied with what Jehovah had provided. though he had provided great things for them. I believe he's provided great things for us. But are we satisfied this morning with what he's provided? Are you satisfied with the with the salvation he's given you? Are you satisfied with your healing? Are you satisfied with the with the message of the hour? If you if you are satisfied God can work with you, but if you become rebellious, there's a there's a penalty for that. Now, they they were not satisfied with what Jehovah had provided. They made a camp, brother Brandham said, of creeds and dogmas instead of the living word. And we know that Kora was a a businessman, brother Brandham called him, who denied the ministry of Ephesians 4:10. So he looks at it and says, "Well, Moses, you're not doing a very good job, and Aaron, you're not doing a very good job. We can do just as good a job." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Even though we're not called to the holy things. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. And brother Brandham picks up on that that there's a movement that's starting back in the 1960s and you can see the fruit of it today, &gt;&gt; right? Or the lack of fruit if you put it that way of the charismatic movement. And not to pick on those people, but it but it hasn't produced a fruit of the gospel, of godliness, of holiness. &gt;&gt; What does it produce? Nonsense. A caricature. The world laughing at them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Gifts out of order. and and not just gifts out of order, but even a laughingtock even where you don't even people don't even reverence the gifts anymore. And brother Brandon said the reason why they wouldn't because they've seen so much out of order. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. People don't even reverence the spiritual gifts anymore. People don't reverence preaching anymore. And preachers, you know, used to be a preacher was a, you know, an honorable thing. Now you kind of you don't want to tell somebody you're a preacher because people suspect you're trying to steal money from them or or or do something terrible to them. Why? because it's a this movement has come on that it's all about the money and what businessmen invaded the pulpit who had no business touching the word of God &gt;&gt; right and brother Brandon tells us that in the church age book he said all over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups they're organizing the businessmen they've invaded the pulpit without a call from God they have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4:10 through13 that God gave the church has failed. So they are taking over. &gt;&gt; We hear things like that even around the message. &gt;&gt; Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy. &gt;&gt; He said called the gain sayings of Kora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it. They're blindly going on preaching experience for truth. So in other words, because I feel it or I say it or or whatever my truth is, that's what truth is. No, the truth is what God says. The truth is what the word says. God can't change his mind about his own word. Now look, he said they're blindly going on preaching experience for truth. May God have pity on them. May their eyes be open before it is too late. It's our prayer today that become that modern charismatic move. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That brother Brandham had a hand in in in in helping them and beginning that movement and he used it as an open door, a place where he could go and he could preach. But the businessmen began to invade the pulpit. Businessmen have their place. Thank God for businessmen. We need them. But let God called men do the preaching. &gt;&gt; Right. Numbers 16 and4 when they come against Moses is just a background. Now we get to what we want to say this morning. But it says when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face and he spake unto Corin unto all his company saying even tomorrow the Lord will show who are his. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And who is holy will cause him to come near unto him. even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him. And they gathered together before the tabernacle. And then in verse 20, it says, "The Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,"Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces and said, "Oh God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, with thou be wroth with all the congregation." So, so God told Moses to separate himself and the people from Corora, Dayathan, and Abram. In verse 28, Moses said, "Hereby shall you know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own mind." &gt;&gt; If these men die the common death of all men, if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open their mouth, and swallow them up with all that pertainth unto them, they go down quick into the pit, then you shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord. And the Bible goes on to tell us that the ground actually opened up and swallowed up those men. Right. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. I'll say the same thing has happened in our day. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The same thing has happened when they stood against the message of the hour. What happened to those men? They were swallowed up by the earth. &gt;&gt; Swallowed up with worlds and swallowed up. They had a name that they lived, but they were dead. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Swallowed up by materialistic things until the church doesn't even resemble a church anymore. It doesn't even resemble the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? the ground opened and swallowed them up. This is interesting. Just kind of a side note, but you know, Dayan and his family were killed and Abram and his family and Anne and his family. Kora was killed. But the Bible says in Numbers 26:11, "Notwithstanding, the children of Kora died not." &gt;&gt; See, they had a job to do. &gt;&gt; They really had a purpose. actually had a purpose in the house of God, &gt;&gt; if Kora had only seen that and stayed within his purpose, he'd have been fine, &gt;&gt; but he tried to go outside of it. &gt;&gt; But if he could have just stayed within his calling, &gt;&gt; he wouldn't have died, &gt;&gt; but God actually saved his children. Because remember the scripture we read, cut not off the sons of the Kathites, &gt;&gt; right? Cut not off the Korites because they they got a work to do. They got a job to do. In 2 Chronicles 20:19, you find there was a great victory. Remember, we talked about it before. There was a great victory during the reign, I believe it was of Hezekiah that it was during the or Jehoshaphat. It was during the reign of a king when they went down in there and they they worshiped and the enemy fell before them. When they worshiped, when they begin to sing and praise, the Bible said the Lord set up ambushments against these these enemies. And during that time, 2 Chronicles 20:19, the Levites, of the children of the Kathites, and of the children of the Korites. &gt;&gt; So even Kor's children stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with a loud voice on high. Why they went back to their place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And did what God called them to do. &gt;&gt; And when they did what God called them to do, there was no issue. But it was when they tried to step outside that. I hope you're hearing me, church. That's what as a minister, it's my job to do what God calls me to do and not to be try something bigger than what I am. Not to try to be the messenger of the age. Are you with me now? My job is to stand for the message of the hour and to preach the word of God and to help people any way that I can. Lord, help me to do that. But if I get beyond that and I get in trouble now, and the same goes true with anybody with any office in the church or any any job to do. All of us have some job to do. There's 11 psalms that were to be sung by the sons of Kora. Do you know that 11 of the psalms were written just for the sons of Kora to sing because they were fine in their position, but they couldn't stand in Moses' place or Aaron's place. So after this event number 17, that's just background to where we want to go this morning, the Lord spake to Moses, saying, speaking to the children of Israel, take every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes, according to the house of their fathers, 12 rods. Write thou every man's name upon his rod. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So they had a rod with each one. Each elder was identified with a certain family name. They identified they brought their rod and brought it up to where all the rods laid before the the tabernacle and they went and brought them into the holy of holies. There was a can we say it like this? A Methodist, a Baptist, a Pentecostal, right? oneness, tuness, go a little bit further, you know, return ministry, &gt;&gt; right? You could all the whatever name people want to be called by. &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; right? Five-fold ministry, tape, whatever name they want to be called by, but there would only be one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That would come to life. &gt;&gt; One rod out of all of those rods &gt;&gt; would bear fruit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh church, you realize what we're seeing today. What we're dealing with today is we're dealing with the fact that we're beginning to see the fruit of this message. I believe for years maybe we've struggled through some hard times, some dry times, but I believe we're beginning to see the fruit of what this message came to do. I I don't believe this is a time of worry and of fear, but I believe this is a time when we're beginning to see a blooming and a blossoming and a and a fruition of all the things that have been preached, God is choosing who is his. Even in a time of lessia, even in the darkest time that's ever been, even in a time when when all the other rods are failing to produce life, there is one that does. That's not this church. That's not my ministry, but that's the message of the hour. What God chose, the elect of God that God chose is bringing forth fruit in this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Write every man's name upon his rod, and thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. For one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers. Thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, that's the ark, where I will meet with you. It shall come to pass that the man's rod whom I shall choose shall blossom." &gt;&gt; Yeah. and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you." You see, Aaron's rod would prove that it wasn't Moses that made the choice. It was God making a choice. Numbers 17:6, Moses spake to the children of Israel. Every one of the princes gave him a rod of peace, and one according to their father's houses, even 12 rods, the rod of Aaron was among their rods. And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness. Now, keep in mind what they've just been through. Kora has just made a challenge. If you go read the rest of that chapter, Kora and Dayan and Abram were all consumed. And when they were, the people of Israel got mad. Children of Israel got mad at Moses. &gt;&gt; Cuz they said, "You've killed Israelites. You've killed our brethren." &gt;&gt; And Moses didn't do it. God did it. &gt;&gt; So Moses said, "Now we're going to see who God has called. &gt;&gt; Let's lay all the rods, all these dead sticks, &gt;&gt; in front preach &gt;&gt; of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Before the word, in the presence of the shikina, all the sticks were laid. Now look, he said, "It come to pass on the tomorrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and behold, the rod of Aaron, for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds and bloom blossoms and yielded almonds." &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. If you're not yielding fruit, one of two things is wrong. Either you come from the wrong tree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to go ahead and say that's not true of any of us today. I believe that you're the predestined of God &gt;&gt; or you wouldn't be here this morning. That's the way we we need to believe. &gt;&gt; But you can't get blood out of a tournament. If a person is not predestined elected by God, they can't be saved. &gt;&gt; And that's harsh, but it's the truth. I don't want to make us thank God for election and thank God for predestination. I say they can't be saved. They cannot be in the elect. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. A person cannot be in the elect. &gt;&gt; Right. Unless they are unless they are one of the elect. &gt;&gt; So, so that that could be the problem. But I'll say this. I don't think that's the problem. I think the problem if you're having trouble producing fruit in your life. Maybe all the fruit you produce has been evil. Maybe everything you try to do in your life has has been bad and it's all just produced something terrible in your life and you think, "I've just made a failure out of my life." Don't you realize maybe the problem is you've not been in the presence of the shikina. You've not been sitting there in front of the word because Aaron's rod was just like any other rod until it come in the tabernacle of testimony. Until it was placed before the shakina glory until it was placed right there before the man and the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That may be the problem. Just not enough time in the tabernacle of testimony. Moses brought all the rods before the Lord and to the children of Israel. And they looked and took every man his rod. And the Lord said to Moses, "Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels." Thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not. See, they thought the priesthood of Aaron was just Moses opinion, but God said was his word. Now, you realize today that we are kings and priests. We've preached on that lately, but how many know that you're kings and priests, spiritual kings and priests? 1 Peter 2:5, you also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. So you are a holy priesthood, a spiritual priesthood, a spiritual house. In other words, he's building like the ironic priesthood, but this would be a priesthood after the order of Melzdc because he was the great high priest after the order of Melzdc. See, it was no accident that Moses made Aaron a priest. It was no accident that we were identified by a word prophet in this age as the bride. &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I'm going to call you bride. See that you'll understand it." Yeah. &gt;&gt; Those who didn't hear it or didn't comprehend it, they can't. They might hear it and not comprehend it. But if you can understand that today, he's talking to you. Oh, come on, church. If if you can if you can grab a hold of that, know what that means, then he's talking to you, cuz that can only come by revelation. He said, "I'm going to call you bride." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That you'll understand it. What was he doing? He was telling you who you are, just like Moses told Aaron who he was. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But the but what vindicates that? Are you with me now? It's the life that you bear. It's the fruit that you bear that vindicates who you are. So this message came by a vindicated prophet. Not to not to prove who he was. Right. He there was a vindication to prove he who he was, but the message came to vindicate us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I don't need supernatural vindication. I need fruit vindication. &gt;&gt; I need manifestation vindication. I believe signs follow the believer. I believe supernatural follows the church of the living God. How many believe that today? We've seen lives change. We've seen we've seen the sick healed. We've seen we've seen everything happen like that. But I'm that's not what I'm looking for. That follows those that believe. But that's not what I'm looking for to vindicate my life. I'm looking for love and joy and peace and longsuffering and gentleness and kindness, the fruits of the spirit to begin to live what God said a Christian would be in Leodysia. for that to begin to manifest itself in my life. &gt;&gt; So the vindication of the message is us, &gt;&gt; right? The proof of who you are is when a dead stick. Now, why was it dead? Let's just stop there for a minute. It was dead because it was separated from the life of God. &gt;&gt; But it was still an almond tree, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But it was dead and it was separated from the life of God. And when it becomes separated from the life, it could no longer bear fruit. It just become a hard dead stick. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And and the older it got, the farther along got, it got harder. It got dead. It it would not naturally come to life unless it got in the presence of the shakina glory. &gt;&gt; It had to be reconnected to the life. &gt;&gt; So what it had to do now, it had to go through a process of of of blooming. Had to go through a process of blossoming. It had to go through a process of bearing fruit. And that's what we do when we come through. We come through. And as a church, you could say that the dead stick, if you typed it to being the entire church or the bride, it's come through justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then it begins to bear fruit. Now, in the presence of the dynamics and the mechanics, the word and the spirit, the dead stick that Aaron had carried for years become like a tree planted by the rivers of water. a 24 hours in the presence of the shikina &gt;&gt; made a stick that was completely dead begin to actually have fruit on it. So that's the three stages of life for an almond tree is buds, blossoms, and fruit. It was already an almond tree, &gt;&gt; but it had been cut off from life. Now, there's something special about an almond tree. Something special about an almond tree. It's not just like any other tree. There's a reason why God chose the rod from an almond tree. So, it had been cut off from the almond life, but it had to go through these stages to bear fruit. Now, in Jeremiah 1 and vers 11, Jeremiah had a very difficult message to preach. I I don't envy Jeremiah at all. In fact, he said, "I'm going to quit preaching." And God said, "No, you're not." You know, and Jeremiah did his best to quit. And he to try to give it up. And and I think we've all felt like that sometime or another. I'm going to quit being a Christian. And God said, "No, you're not." &gt;&gt; But Jeremiah had a very difficult message to preach. And he had to preach to the people, "Go on into Babylon. Go into captivity. You're not going to win this war." Could you imagine being in the Second World War, a war that threatened your very existence or something like that? And then people, you go into the White House and tell them, "You're not going to win. You're not going to win. You need to give in. You need to let it let the Japanese have it. at the we wouldn't even we throw the man in prison for spreading sedition and that's exactly what they did to Jeremiah but at the very beginning of his ministry in Jeremiah chapter 1 11 God showed Jeremiah something to strengthen his faith he said moreover the word of the Lord came to me saying Jeremiah what seeest thou and I said I see a rod of an almond tree &gt;&gt; cuz God was going to reveal to Jeremiah that things weren't always going to be as bad as they were right then &gt;&gt; oh come on church they weren't always going going to be taken into captivity. Listen to me, church. If you can just see a glimpse of hope this morning, if you may have been separated from life, but there's a lifegiver here this morning that can tell you it's not always going to be like that, but you begin to see a bud in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, he said, Jeremiah, what do you see? He said, I see a rod of an almond tree. And said the Lord unto me, thou hast well seen, for I will hasten my word to perform it. And the reason he said that, it's almost a play on words because the almond tree was the very first to bear fruit in Israel when everything else was still dead. The almond proclaimed spring is coming. &gt;&gt; So the almond tree bore fruit in March. You know, kind of like what happens around here is some yellow flowers, whatever those are. Forgive me for not knowing my basic flowers, but them yellow flowers come up and and that's escaping me this morning, the the name of them, but uh little daisies or something. &gt;&gt; Daffodils, that's what they are. Daffodils begin to come up and everything else is still dead. You ever notice that everything is still dead, but you just let a little warm sun come down at the right time of year in March &gt;&gt; and them daffodil start springing up everywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They don't bloom for long, but it's the first sign of spring, &gt;&gt; right? The first Oh, come on, church. The first sign of spring is the daffodil coming to life. And God told Jeremiah, he said, "I want you to I want you to look at the almond tree. &gt;&gt; What do you see, Jeremiah? An almond tree." He said, "That's the first thing that's coming to life. Everything else might look bad. Everything else might be dead. It might look like in your life that things are over. It might the doctor might have said you'll never be healed. The people my around you might say you'll never be any different than you are now. But look at the look what the almond tree says. &gt;&gt; There's a potential to the almond tree. It's the first thing. It's the first fruits of life. &gt;&gt; And God said, "I'm not going to leave you down there long. I'll hasten my word to perform it. Spring is coming." The almond proclaimed spring is coming. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And that's what it did to Aaron's rod. Brother Brandon said it so beautifully in a hidden life. He says in this same place they put Aaron's rod to make a decision who God had chosen and who he hadn't. And that rod that was a dead stick. In one night's time come to life, brought buds, brought flowers, and brought almonds. &gt;&gt; It both come to life, brought blossoms, and yielded fruits. A very typical pattern of the sinner being brought to God into the holy place. &gt;&gt; That rod was off of an almond tree and when it was cut off, it died. &gt;&gt; And when man was cut off from God, he died spiritually. &gt;&gt; You can't fix a spiritual death with a 12step program. &gt;&gt; You can't fix a spiritual death. Those things are wonderful, but that's not how you fix spiritual death. You can't fix spiritual death with just trying to reform. You young people say, "Well, I'll do better. I'll do better. I'll turn over a new leaf." That's not how you fix spiritual death. The way you fix spiritual death is by coming into the Holy of Holies, entering into the baptism of the Holy Ghost, believing the word, and walking into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Church, we do a lot of things as a church. We we we teach those that need taught. We we try to coach up our parents and our children and our young people and we try to teach our Sunday school children. I'm thankful for you teachers that do that. You're doing a wonderful job. I appreciate you doing it. We try to teach our young people how to act and how to behave and we try to we try to lift you up in every way that we can. We've even tried to, you know, talk about finances and talk about all those things cuz they're useful things. But the most important thing that we do &gt;&gt; is to bring people into the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because no matter how many much you teach a ro a dead stick how to bear fruit, it'll never bear fruit until the life of the word comes inside of it. &gt;&gt; And it begins to bear what it is. &gt;&gt; It has to be. That's that's it's got to be a process of got to come to life. So the most important thing that we do, but I think we ought to take time for it. I think we ought to make sure things are right for it. I think we ought to set an atmosphere for it. We ought to behave ourselves in the sanctuary because we know that this is a place where God can bring a dead stick to life. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's a place where God can move over a heart, over a mind, over a soul and begin to change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Begin to change a dead stick into a productive productive tree. Brother said, "When man was cut off from God, he died spiritually. But once brought into the presence of God, before the presence of God, he comes to life and he yields life. He yields blossoms. He yields fruit. Jesus come to a tree one time to look for fruit on it. It had everything but fruit." &gt;&gt; Remember the fig tree and what did he do? He cursed it. &gt;&gt; It had everything. It had leaves but it had no fruit. &gt;&gt; And that's what's the matter. He said with our churches today, we got everything but fruit. We can shout. We can speak with tongues. We can argue the scriptures. We can teach our theology, but when it comes to fruit bearing, the tree is very lean. Listen to me this morning. Word of Life Tabernacle. It don't matter how much we know. Doesn't matter how much we've been taught. How come we can explain the opening of the word? We can explain the mysteries from beginning to end. We can talk all about the seals and the church ages and everything else. If we do not bear fruit, we're worthless. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? If we don't bear fruit, we're worthless. We can't do anything for a lost and dying world. We can't be a credit to our community. We can't help people unless we bear fruit. It doesn't matter how much we can argue about the scripture. It doesn't matter how right we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or how much we shout or how much we dance or how much Come on, church. How much we get. I believe in those things, but it don't matter how much we do it. If we don't bear fruit, we're dead. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Brother Brandham looked at that denominational church, that Pentecostal church, which was very emotional, but he said, "The tree is very lean." Now, we see trees that aren't even emotional. That there's not even any leaves on them. This this the Pentecostal church that he looked at, they were emotional, but they were didn't have any fruit. The B said, "Notice what a beautiful picture of the sinner laying in the presence of God. This rod laying there, it was refreshed. She was fragrant brought the fragrance of the blossom. It yielded fruit. The buds came forth. He said, "Now the tree had to be an almond tree to start with." And Christ, you have to receive him before you come into this place. So the first step is to accept Christ. To receive him. If you haven't done that, you need to do that. To accept him. It's more than just a mental conception, but to accept him as Lord of your life. &gt;&gt; Lord, I accept you have control in my life. I believe in you. And he said, "Notice the first thing was a refreshment." He said, 'What makes the seed grow? Did you ever get of the morning, up of the morning, and find the dew that fell down from heaven and refreshes the earth? &gt;&gt; How many of you walked outside this morning and thought, "My, it feels good." &gt;&gt; It was refreshing, wasn't it? The coolness of it. And you thought, "My, what a refreshment to be in that in that place." Listen, we've got a honeysuckle bush not far from our door. I just love walking out in the morning when it's cool. I don't want to come out there when it's 99 and it's got high humidity, but when it's cool and and like it is now and and you get up in the morning and find the dew is fallen. Brother Brandon said, "How does it refresh it when it's at peace?" Now, listen to me. What what what many people are trying to do is they're trying to refresh themselves, but in a place where there's no peace, &gt;&gt; right? You're trying to refresh yourself, but you're always on your phone. &gt;&gt; Trying to refresh yourself, but you're always watching television. &gt;&gt; Trying to refresh yourself, but you're always just doing something, going somewhere and doing something and carrying on. But that's not what he called us to do. &gt;&gt; The way to refreshment is through peace. And the only peace we can find is with him. &gt;&gt; So we need to come into his presence, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Right. We need some time with God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I feel like today and I think we did a poll one time of young people and the young people in that that group that we were talking to said that the number one thing they struggle with is not, you know, young people struggle with a lot of things. pornography and and and the internet and and other young people not treating them right and all kinds of depression and but they said the number one thing they dealt with was was not read not being able to read their Bible and pray like they wanted to not having time to spend with God. And the truth is a lot of the other issues would begin to go away if we spent more time with the Lord. &gt;&gt; I see it as the number one lack and I'm preaching to myself and to every one of us. The number one lack &gt;&gt; that we preachers have &gt;&gt; the number one lack that people have is not spending the time in the presence of the Lord, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not taking the time. I'm not talking about just here in the church, although we should have it here too, but I'm talking about at home. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get down on your knees and pray to God and when when you talk to God alone, when you get out, maybe maybe you're out hunting or you're fishing or you're doing something uh you know, you're walking out in nature or something like that and you just you just get time to refresh yourself in the presence of God. You need that time. &gt;&gt; You need that time. And Satan's stolen that from us &gt;&gt; until technology has even invaded the hunting sphere and and fishing and things like that. So some places y'all go. I guess there's probably no signal, but but it's invaded everything that we do &gt;&gt; until we can't get off of it &gt;&gt; where we're connected all the time. And it's not that it's bad, but where do we find peace? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; You got to be able to find a moment where God can talk to you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's speaking, but we're not hearing him because of all the things that we got going on. &gt;&gt; So, the number one thing I think that we our services would be better. We'd have less less counseling to do. We'd have less problems in the home. We'd have come on, it'd affect every area of our life if we begin to get down on our knees and just really spending time with God and say, "Today, I'm going to let all these things go and I'm going to spend some time in the presence of the Lord. Brother B says the de don't fall in daytime. The de falls in the nighttime when everything is at peace. The de can never fall on you, my brother, as long as you're fussing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If that's the way, if your home is a constant fuss, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; How is the Holy Ghost going to speak? Y &gt;&gt; you said, "But brother Ben, I don't know how to stop." &gt;&gt; Just stop. &gt;&gt; If you didn't feel the need to say anything back, there wouldn't be no fuss. &gt;&gt; Said, "But that would mean I took the wrong." Exactly. &gt;&gt; There was no fuss. &gt;&gt; I don't even know why I'm saying this this morning, but there was no fuss when Christ went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; He didn't fuss with Pilate. He didn't fuss with Anna and the the high priest and Caesar. &gt;&gt; He didn't fuss with the guards. &gt;&gt; There was no fuss cuz he would not allow himself to fuss. He was like a lamb before the slaughter. Listen to me, church. What was he doing? He was doing it for a purpose for us. How I wonder if we could sacrifice ourselves for the purpose of peace in my home. I'm not going to I'm not going to just I'm not going to uh just fight and fuss and argue and and carry on. But some of you young people, you just you just bristle at everything mom and dad say, and you got to talk back and say something. Why don't you make a commitment today that you're going to keep your mouth shut once in a while and and for an opportunity for God to begin to heal your home? &gt;&gt; You're fussing and arguing and stewing about the things here on earth. He said, "Get along with God. Let the dew drops of mercy &gt;&gt; fall upon you in the stillness. how that God can get his believer with the curtains dropped around him alone to himself. You know, we complain about things. We ought to use them as opportunities. &gt;&gt; I know a lot of us drive. We drive to work. I drove to work for all my career 50, excuse me, 15 years. I drove no matter where I worked, I was 45 minutes from work. It just I don't know why it happened that way, but it just was. You know what I found? It was a great time in the presence of God. Some of the strongest moments and it wasn't always that way. You understand? Sometimes you you let things invade that and do other things. But but when I allowed it to happen, it was the most awesome time in the presence of the Lord. I got to where I coveted that time just me in in the car with a tape play or sometimes with nothing and just sitting there thinking about the things of God and the presence of God would come in the car. We we don't know. We complain about things. Maybe we ought to value that time. &gt;&gt; If you live a little ways from work, take that time today. I'm not going to worry about sports. I'm not going to worry about who beat who. I'm not going to worry about what's going on at the house. Lord, I just want to tell you how much I love you. I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. I just want to tell you what what the what what I would be without you, Lord. I just thank you for saving me. Thank you for healing me. Thank you for giving me my family. Thank you even if it's not complete yet. Thank you for the restoration of all that belongs to me. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; How that God can get his believer with the curtains dropped around him alone to himself. to bring down a refreshing from heaven that there's no other person, no other way in the world ever know it. Only that he's laying he that's laying there. Did you ever walk out in the morning and that real fresh cool feeling? God has refreshed his earth fragrance. Did you ever go into a rose garden? He said down my place they got a lot of honeysuckles. The honeysuckle don't smell much along in the heat of the day but it's early of the morning when all the air has been purified. That aroma of the honeysuckle. He said let a man be out fussing, fighting, stewing. You'll never get much of aroma from that of the gospel, but let him get alone one time in the stillness of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Every man that comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone first." &gt;&gt; I fight for that more than anything else in my ministry. Give me some time, some time where I can be by myself and spend some time in the presence of God. And yes, sometimes you got to sacrifice some things to do that. But Lord, let me have that time because fruit comes out of that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. said, "Every man ought to that comes ought to dwell alone first." I've told the preachers, "We want preachers to study. We want them to study. We want to study as much time as there is to study. We we want to hear something real. We want to hear something that you studied and you spent time on and things like that. We don't want to hear some some last minute sermon, but I'll say this. If you come to a time where you don't you only have time for one, pray." &gt;&gt; If you only have time to to pray, pray. And God will God will help you when you get up to preach. Get yourself in the presence of God. Even if you maybe couldn't study as much as you wanted to. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "Every man that comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone. First thing comes the fruits, yielding forth his fruits. Every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness, peace, love, joy, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience. Don't fuss about these other things. get that in your life and you'll never get it until you hide away with God in that land of adoption. You think about it, you know, say, "Well, me and my husband, we fuss all the time. It's harder to fuss when you just walked out of that presence." &gt;&gt; It just is. Well, me and my kids, we just fuss and fight. Well, they may need a whooping, but maybe they're too old for that. They just fuss and fight all the time. It's hard to do that if you brought your family together in his presence. It's hard. I've noticed people get to picking at one another in church, picking at the way the food is done or picking at the way this is done or that. Not nobody's doing that right now, but y'all are y'all are so gracious. I appreciate it. But they'll pick about the fellowship hall or pick about the Sunday school or pick about the preacher, pick about this or that. It's hard to do that &gt;&gt; if you've just been scoured out by his presence. &gt;&gt; And you really entered into the service and you you stood there and said, "Lord, I'm I know I'm a sinner. &gt;&gt; I need help myself, Lord." It's hard to look in judgment on anyone else. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "You get in that place and walk out, everybody looks good to you." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; See, some folks claim to have all the word. I don't doubt that they do. All the word was in the ark. &gt;&gt; But unless the shikina was there, it would just be a dead word. But in that presence, the word could produce life in a dead stick. It's refreshing. See, what is the word producing in your life? Remember there were two sons of Eli who were who really were in the ironic priesthood. They were in the right line &gt;&gt; but they were evil themselves. They were just in it for the money &gt;&gt; and other things. And they they come down these these sons of Balile the Bible calls them and and the children of Israel went down got beat in the battle with the Philistines. They said we know what we'll do. We'll go get the ark. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Hoffne and Phinehos the sons of Eli come out there with the ark. And they thought, "Boy, we're going to beat them this time." Even the Philistines thought they were beat. But the Philistines rose up and slaughtered them. Took the ark from them. What happened? It didn't produce anything. It didn't produce any life. Oh, church. There was no presence there because they had not they had not spent any time. They didn't even realize. And there was a baby being born to one of those brothers. I think it was Finos had a baby born at that time. And when the wife when the mother uh when the mother had the baby, she cried out and said, "His name is Kabad. The glory of the Lord has departed from Israel." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he did not depart when they lost the ark in battle. He had already departed or they would have never lost the word. While they still had the word, the glory had already departed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz the way they were living, &gt;&gt; right? Brother Brandon said, "Put Aaron's rod in there." An old dead almond tree. But as it went under the shakina of glory, everything it was sir. &gt;&gt; Do you feel like just a dry stick sometimes? Just a dead a dead almond tree. Just a you just dried up and said, "I haven't been in the presence of God in so long." But everything that you ever were is still in you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If you were chosen by God before the foundation of the world, you remember what peace was like. I remember what joy was like. I remember what it was like to enjoy church. I remember what it was like to shout down the house. I remember what it was like to feel the presence of God. Everything that you ever were, Brother Joe, is still in you. &gt;&gt; Still in you. It's just waiting to be restored. And when it come in the presence of the shakina glory, all the life that ever was in that almond tree begin to come out. &gt;&gt; Everything that it was, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; was restored again. I say, God, bring me back this morning. If I ever had joy, I can have joy this morning. If I ever had peace, I can have peace this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the way a sinner is when he goes under the shakana glory of the Holy Spirit. The veil dropped behind him. Everything that ought to have been." Oh, God. Everything that he ought to have been. Oh, if he had never sinned, if you'd have never left the Lord, if you'd never done what you did, everything that he ought to have been, &gt;&gt; son of God blooms out in him again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm so glad for restoration. I'm so glad he doesn't leave us cut off from life. I'm so glad he Oh, come on, church. He doesn't leave us in our dead condition, but when we come back in the presence of God, everything that we ever were. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "Remember, overnight it budded, blossom, grow almonds on it, fruits of the spirit, love, joy, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's where we need to get in the third step. Get over into the shakina glory where that little sacred light was hanging over the mercy seat. That's the place to stay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where the man of the pot of mana sat down by the ark. That's the place to live. Hallelujah. You say, "Brother Ben, I I've made a decision for Christ. I I believe the message. Why is my life not yielding more fruit?" Brother Brandham said, "There's a mini almond tree right here in Minneapolis tonight where he was preaching." He said, "But the only thing is, as long as you're outside of this hidden life, you'll never be able to be refreshed and bring forth the fruits that God intended you to do until you come into the presence of God." What makes trees bud? It's a refreshment. What makes the refreshing early of a morning? You go out of early morning, you'll find out after the night everything gets still. The dew falls, it brings a refreshing. The trouble of it is today people don't have time to get before God and get still. They got so many things to do. They belong to this. They got to do this. They got to have this. They got to go there. You don't have time. The devil just took up all your time. You don't have time to get still before God and get quiet. &gt;&gt; He said you're a nature. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So just like this is a I forget what they call a biosphere. This is a place where life is &gt;&gt; right and everything's independent on or dependent rather on one another. &gt;&gt; And if you take one thing like if you took coyotes out of the ecosystem it would change everything right? You take mosquitoes out as much as we hate them &gt;&gt; and it would change everything because there's some purpose &gt;&gt; in it right? So it's a nature. You you don't mess with nature you get in trouble. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They found that out. So you don't have time. He said you're a nature and after all nature gets quiet and still then the dew begins to fall that refreshes and brings forth life. You are a nature yourself. See there's got to be a nighttime. &gt;&gt; They say one of the most stressful things you can go through. You say, "Well, I want it to be sunny all the time." They say one of the most stressful things, some of you have experienced that where it's light in Alaska or wherever where it's light for 24 hours. They say after you've been there for a while, it stresses you out. That's &gt;&gt; right. Because there's no night time, &gt;&gt; there's no time to refresh. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we look at the still times, the quiet times when we're not doing anything and say, "Well, you know, nothing's going on. I'm just so bored." And you don't realize that's the time that you need &gt;&gt; to get still before God. The dew of heaven begins to fall and begins to refresh. I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but maybe that's why when we get older, but JT, as you get older, you get you can do less. Maybe God's getting you ready for his presence. &gt;&gt; You just get to a place where maybe physically you can't do as much. You got more time to spend in the presence of God. Maybe he's just getting you ready. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And maybe I know as you get older aches and pains come and things come and you don't understand why am I hurting? Why? But maybe just getting you ready for that time. &gt;&gt; You're going through the night but joy comes in the morning. Weeping endures for the night but joy comes in the morning. You got to go through the night time when you slow down a little bit and reflect on your life and really get down to business with God. &gt;&gt; I would say this to our young people. You need to do that now. That's right. &gt;&gt; Take time to do it now &gt;&gt; because you don't know that you'll have a refreshing in the senior years of your life. Brother said that's what we need to do. What we need to do is get away and get quiet before God so he can bathe you with the refreshment from heaven. Get alone to yourself. Close the doors. Pull them together. Say, "Now Lord, here I am in your presence." Brother B used an illustration. He said that there was a man who raised hogs and he said his mama raised hogs and his daddy raised hogs and his grandpa raised hogs. Brother Brandon said you got talking to him all you could talk about was hogs. &gt;&gt; Now that seems strange to us but you either in the cattle industry or if you love to hunt or fish or right it's hard not to talk about it. You know, if you're if you're got a certain trade that you enjoy doing, you know, even the funeral home, right? You talk about it. Brother Brandham said, "This man, all he could talk about was hogs. This is how I raise them. This is how I feed them. This is what I feed them." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said after a while, he interjected. He said, "Isn't there more to your life than hogs? Isn't there more than hogs?" Oh, church. It may not be hogs. That may seem kind of ridiculous, but maybe it's something else in our life. Isn't there more to our life than just work? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking just the preachers today. I'm talking to every one of us. &gt;&gt; Isn't there more to our life than just going to work? Isn't there more to our life than driving a truck or working in a factory or doing that? Brother said, "God didn't put you here to work in a factory just alone. He put you here as a testimony, a written epistle read of all men to live an honorable and decent life &gt;&gt; and a and a hid consecrated life with God so that men would know that Jesus Christ still lives and reign. You might be a hog raiser, but let me be a testifier while I'm raising hogs. Let me be a worshipper while I'm in the factory. Let me do what God's called me to do. &gt;&gt; Be what God's called me to be. Brother Brandon said, "Brothers and sisters, let me say this in the name of Christ. If you've never been in that place, come to him tonight. Get into that place. When you go home, close the door. Tell your husband not to bother you till tomorrow. Stay in there. &gt;&gt; Tell your wife the same thing. Say, "If I'm not out of here in the morning, tell the boss, I'm not coming to work today." Stay in the presence of Christ until something happens in your soul. as musicians come. Many times we we want to practice self-care. That's a buzz word today. Self-care. I guess there's some element of truth to it as there is to most things. You need to take care of yourself. We practice self-care and we are more I guess we recognize more the needs that we have in our own self and our bodies than any other generation ever did. We take care of ourselves. Let me tell you what the best kind of self-care is. Time in his presence. &gt;&gt; It's the best kind. &gt;&gt; Because there will be something from the inside begin to come to the outside. &gt;&gt; See, if we're just trying to change the atmosphere of our nature by taking in things, that's that might help for a while, but it'll never change who you are. But if you could ever get in the presence of the shikina glory, if you could ever get in the presence, oh my, of the one who created the universe, just get in his presence. He begin to heal you from the inside. Begin to take care of you from the inside. Just just go past the brazen altar. Go past the candlesticks to shoot bread. Come out of the court of the Gentiles into the holy place. Don't stop there. Keep moving. Some of y'all have come. You've ch your lives have changed. You've been sanctified your lives. You've done things differently. But it's time to go on in. It's time to go on in because outside you're still dependent on man-made light. whether the preacher preaches a good sermon, whether or not the people are good to you. But you need to go on into the Holy of Holies, go inside on the inside of the inside where the light of the hour is the shikina presence of God. Go in and stay there until you are changed in his presence, till your life begins to bear again. So, that's what I want to do. How about you this morning? Do you love the Lord this morning? I'm going to preach to you again this afternoon. Kind of take a related thought, but not the same. Let's bow our heads together. Maybe you'd like to enter into his presence just for a moment today. So, Brother Ben, I need a vacation. We all do. That's a valuable thing. But right now, we have an opportunity for time in his presence. Ben, I need a new new this or new that or new house, whatever it is. But right now, he has set before you an open door, this moment to walk into the Holy of Holies. Let that veil drop behind you. And Lord, it's just you and me now. God, once you ever go in there, church, you want to live there. You'll want to live there. There's something in your heart that longs for that. [Music] Oh, I don't want to be just an old dead stick. Tired of living up and down and in and out. I want to be in the Holy of Holies. I want to stay there in your presence until something changes. Well, I pray that'd be our prayer this morning. Maybe you can leave this place that brother said, "Go and shut your door. I'm Lord. I'm ready." Hallelujah. You're ready for things to be different. If you need prayer, the altar's open, but let's just all pray together for a moment. Heavenly Father, Lord, I feel your presence here this morning in the sanctuary. I thank you so much, Lord. Had to fight so hard this morning to even get to a place where I could preach things that happened. But Lord, I know that you're here this morning. I know that you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. I thank you for coming down among us once again. Lord, take me into the Holy of Holies. Let me live there, Lord, where I wouldn't do anything that would be unpleasing to you because I'd be inside where your presence is. I'd be conscious of it. Oh, grant it. Lord, take me away from all the fussing and fighting and stewing. Oh, God. Take me in to the Holy of Holies. Let the door shut behind me, oh God. Let me dwell in your presence. Grant that for every one of us, Lord. Lord, I don't care how long they've been a Christian. I pray this morning would be a ripening time in the presence of God, a blooming time. Maybe when they leave here, they say, "Well, I haven't I haven't blossomed out yet. I don't see the fruit." But if they even see a bud, Lord, may they rejoice in that and then just stay in your presence. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. It's got to go through a process, but may it begin now, Lord, before anything else is alive. May your children come alive in the presence of God. I pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [Music] Thank you, Jesus. In the presence of Jehovah, the presence. [Music] I'm so glad he's our king. Oh, the king. Could you just lift your hands to him and sing it this morning? Oh, in the presence in your presence, Lord. Oh, just forget about everything else for just a moment. Let me spend time in your presence, Lord. Hallelujah. Oh God Almighty. [Music] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh prince, you're the prince of peace. So all my troubles vanish. Oh all my trles vanish. I'm so grateful Lord Jesus. Oh arms are men. [Music] Oh thank you Lord. Oh, in the presence. Oh, of the king. Let's stand together. Don't don't don't rush it too much, church. It's still early.

Just make you welcome for a moment. &gt;&gt; Let him draw in your life in your heart. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what's going on around you. Just let him let him speak to you now for a moment. struggle. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, for the answers that I need. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, &gt;&gt; and then I come into his presence. &gt;&gt; All my questions, thank you, Lord. and all my questions become clear. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; And for that sacred moment, &gt;&gt; all my doubts just disappear. Glory. Thank you, Lord. Oh, in the praise. I'm so glad for your presence, Lord. [Music] Oh, thank you. You are God Almighty. God bless you this morning. We love you with all of our hearts. Oh, praise. Oh, thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord. Oh trles. [Music] Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And hearts are meeting [Music] in the presence of the king. [Music] And through his love, the Lord provided a place for us to rest. A place to find the answers in the hour of distress. Oh, now there's never any reason for you to give up in despair. Oh, just slip away and breathe his name. He will surely meet you there. Oh, it's in the presence. If you believe he's here this morning, would you just put your hands up to him? Oh, Jehovah, [Music] you are God Almighty. mighty. You are the prince of peace. [Music] All my trles vanish [Music] and hearts are bing. Oh, in the presence of the king. [Music] And all I want to do is love him. I'm so glad I feel his love for me. [Music] Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. [Music] Oh, so every day my heart will praise him. [Music] I know I'll never be the same. [Music] And all I want to do is love him. Love his holy name. I'm singing. All I want to do is love him. I'm so glad I feel his love for me. [Music] And Jesus paid the price of redemption. [Music] Oh, on the cross of Calary. Oh, so every day my heart is going to praise him. I know I'll never be the same. And all I want to do is love him. Love his holy. One more time with all your hearts now. Oh, we're singing. All I want to do is love him. I'm so glad I feel his love for me. Jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of Calary. Oh, so every day my heart is going to praise him and I know I'll never be the same. And all I want to do is love him. Love his holy [Music] [Applause] name. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise this morning. Do you love him? Amen. How many appreciated the word of the Lord this morning? Amen. We're going to sing this song here. God is good all the time. Keep see as we go. God bless you. We'll see you at 3:00 this afternoon. Well, God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time in the darkest night. His light will shine. God is good. He's so good all the time. Well, if you're walking through the valley and there are shadows all around, [Music] for he will guide you. Oh, he will keep you safe and sound. For he has promised to never leave you nor forsake you. And his word is true. God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this part of my God is good all the time in the darkest night. His light will shine. God is good. He's so good all the time. [Music] Well, we were sinners, so unworthy. But still for us, he chose to die. He has filled us
