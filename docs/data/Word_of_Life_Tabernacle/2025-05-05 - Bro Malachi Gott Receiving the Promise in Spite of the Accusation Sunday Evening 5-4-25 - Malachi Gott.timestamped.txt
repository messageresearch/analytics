[10:25] All the saints of God are gathered. Oh
[10:30] well, we will tell the story how we've
[10:35] overcome and we'll understand it better.
[10:39] Amen. First verse. Oh, we are often
[10:43] tossed and driven on the restless sea of
[10:46] time. Somber skies and howling tempest
[10:50] officer bright sunshine. In that land of
[10:54] perfect day, when the midst have rolled
[10:58] away, we will understand it better by
[11:02] and by.
[11:04] Oh now by and
[11:07] by when the morning comes when all the
[11:12] saints of God are gathered home now we
[11:16] will tell our story just how we overcome
[11:22] and we'll understand it better by and
[11:26] by. We are often destitute of the things
[11:31] that life demands. One of food and one
[11:35] of shelter. Thirsty hills and barren
[11:38] land. But we're trusting in the Lord.
[11:42] And according to his word, we will
[11:46] understand it better by and by. Sing it
[11:50] now.
[11:54] [Music]
[12:03] Tell the story just how we overcome and
[12:08] we'll understand it better by and
[12:12] by. Oh, trials dark on every hand. And
[12:16] we cannot understand all the ways that
[12:21] God would lead us to that blessed
[12:23] promised land. But he guides us with his
[12:27] eye and we'll follow till we die. We'll
[12:31] understand it better by and
[12:35] by. Oh, now by and
[12:39] by. When the morning comes, when all the
[12:44] saints of God are gathered home, now we
[12:48] will tell our story just how we
[12:52] overcome. And we'll understand it better
[12:56] by and by.
[12:59] Temptations, hidden snares often take us
[13:04] unaware. And our hearts are made to
[13:07] bleed. For many a thoughtless word or
[13:10] deed, and we wonder why the test when we
[13:14] try to do our best, but we'll understand
[13:18] it better by and
[13:21] by. Oh now by and
[13:25] by when the morning comes when all the
[13:30] saints of God are gathered home we will
[13:34] tell our story how we overcome and we'll
[13:40] understand it. Amen. Course one more
[13:44] time. Oh, now by and
[13:48] by, when the morning comes, when all the
[13:53] saints of God are gathered home, well,
[13:56] we will tell our
[14:01] story. Well, we'll understand it better
[14:05] by and by. Amen. Give you my hand of
[14:08] praise this evening. Amen. Amen. Let's
[14:11] try hold God. Holding God's unchanging
[14:14] hand. Amen. Well, time is filled with
[14:19] swift
[14:23] transition and
[14:24] not of earth unmoved can
[14:29] stand. Oh, just build your hopes on
[14:34] things
[14:37] eternal and just hold.
[14:40] Amen. Unchanging hand. Oh, we're singing
[14:46] now holding to God's unchanging
[14:50] [Music]
[14:52] hand. Oh, now hold to God's unchanging
[15:00] hand. Oh, just build your hopes on
[15:05] things
[15:08] eternal and then
[15:10] hold. Amen. Amen. That's what we want to
[15:13] do this evening. Amen. Oh, we got to
[15:18] trust in him who will not leave
[15:23] [Music]
[15:24] you. Oh,
[15:26] [Music]
[15:27] whatsoever years may bring.
[15:30] [Music]
[15:33] Now
[15:34] if my earthly friends
[15:39] forsake, we got to steal more closely to
[15:44] him
[15:46] cling. Oh, singing now. Holding to God's
[15:52] unchanging
[15:55] hand. Oh, Justin, holding to God's
[16:00] unchanging hand.
[16:02] [Music]
[16:04] Oh, now build your hopes on things
[16:09] [Music]
[16:11] eternal and just hold to God's
[16:15] unchanging
[16:16] [Music]
[16:18] hand. Oh, now cover it not this world's
[16:24] vain riches.
[16:25] [Music]
[16:28] for that so rapidly
[16:35] decay. You got to seek to gain those
[16:39] heavenly
[16:42] treasure. You know
[16:45] they will never pass
[16:49] away. Oh singing now hold to God's
[16:55] unchanging hand.
[16:58] [Music]
[16:59] Just hold to God's unchanging
[17:06] hand. Oh, now build your hopes on things
[17:14] eternal and then
[17:16] hold. Amen. I like this last verse here
[17:19] now. Singing when your journey.
[17:22] Oh, now
[17:24] when your journey is
[17:30] completed, now if to God you have been
[17:38] true. Oh
[17:40] fair and bright your homing
[17:46] gloryy. You know
[17:48] you're in raptured. So shall you. Amen.
[17:53] Play it for us
[17:56] [Music]

[18:20] Sing it now one more
[18:24] time.
[18:25] Oh, sing it now. Hold to God's
[18:30] unchanging
[18:33] hand. Well, now hold to God's unchanging
[18:39] hand.
[18:43] Just build your hopes on things
[18:49] eternal and then hold to God's
[18:54] unchanging hand. Give him a hand of
[18:57] praise this evening. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[19:00] Let's try a good old gospel ship if we
[19:02] can. Amen. Let's try that. Good old
[19:05] gospel ship.
[19:07] Well, I have good news to bring. And
[19:10] that is why I sing. All my joys with you
[19:16] I'll
[19:17] share. Well, I'm going to take a trip in
[19:21] that good old gospel ship and go
[19:25] sailing through the air.
[19:30] Now I'm going to take a trip in a good
[19:33] old gospel ship and I'm going far
[19:38] beyond the
[19:40] sky. Well, now I'm going to shout and
[19:43] sing until the heavens ring while I'm
[19:47] beating this world
[19:51] goodbye. Well, now if you're ashamed of
[19:55] me, you have no cause to be. For with
[19:59] Christ I am an

[20:07] you'll surely be left behind. While I go

[40:22] a tape. Brother Brandham said, he said
[40:24] he was a spare tire. I thought, "Oh my,
[40:25] what is spare tires?" Brother Brandham
[40:28] bad shape. Uh, but it's glad to see all
[40:31] your happy faces tonight. And we'll just
[40:33] go to the Lord in prayer before we get
[40:35] started here. If you have a need, I
[40:36] believe Lord's here to meet that need.
[40:39] So, we'll just go to him now.
[40:42] Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you so
[40:44] much for your love and for your mercy,
[40:45] God. Lord, we thank you for this time we
[40:48] get to come into the service, Lord, to
[40:50] worship you, Lord, again, and to just
[40:52] feel your presence, God. And Lord, you
[40:54] know, I'm nervous this evening, Father,
[40:56] but nerves are nothing to you, Father. I
[40:59] just pray you'd settle the nerves that
[41:01] somebody here would be helped, that
[41:02] you'd help me, Lord, because I know you
[41:04] can speak to me just as anybody else,
[41:05] Lord, that's listening, God. We pray
[41:07] that you'd bless this thought, Lord, the
[41:09] reading of the word. Father, just make
[41:11] it real to us, Lord. We commit all
[41:13] things into your hands and just ask this
[41:15] service would be for your glory in Jesus
[41:17] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. If you have
[41:20] your Bibles, we'll turn to Hebrews 13
[41:22] and
[41:23] 8. Know it's a very familiar scripture,
[41:25] but we'll start with the eth verse and
[41:27] work our way down to 14 and
[41:29] then we'll go to Psalms 89 right after
[41:33] that.
[41:35] subject I want to speak on is receiving
[41:37] the promise in spite of the
[41:42] accusations. Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ
[41:45] the same yesterday and today and forever
[41:48] be not carried about with diverse and
[41:51] strange doctrines. For it is a good
[41:53] thing that the heart be established with
[41:55] grace, not with meats which have not
[41:58] profited them that have been occupied
[42:00] therein. We have an altar whereof that
[42:03] they have no right to eat which serve
[42:04] the tabernacle. For the bodies of those
[42:07] beasts whose blood is brought into the
[42:09] sanctuary by the high priest for sin are
[42:11] burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus
[42:14] also that he might sanctify the people
[42:16] with his own blood suffered without the
[42:19] gate. Let us go thereforth therefore
[42:22] unto him without the camp bearing his
[42:25] reproach. For here we have no continuing
[42:28] city, but we seek one to come. We'll
[42:31] turn over to Psalms 89 verse
[42:35] 50. Says, "Remember, Lord, the reproach
[42:38] of thy servants, how I do bear in my
[42:41] bosom the reproach of all the mighty
[42:43] people wherewith thine enemies have
[42:46] reproached, oh Lord, wherewith they have
[42:48] reproached the footsteps of thine
[42:50] anointed. Blessed be the Lord forever
[42:53] more. Amen and amen." May the Lord bless
[42:55] you. may have your
[42:58] seats. So, speaking on receiving the
[43:00] promise in the face of
[43:03] accusations, you know, in every age and
[43:06] every day, people that's lived has had
[43:09] to bear reproach if they were going to
[43:10] stand for this word. There's always a
[43:13] measure of reproach that a believer has
[43:15] to go through. And that's just character
[43:18] development because Christ has
[43:20] determined that we have a character just
[43:22] like him. and he's coming back for a
[43:24] people with a character just like him.
[43:27] You look at Hebrews 11, the heroes of
[43:29] the faith, all these men, women that go
[43:31] down, there's so many of them, but they
[43:33] all had some mark against them, whether
[43:35] it was a national mark, a physical mark,
[43:37] a spiritual mark, some kind of problem
[43:39] that Satan would accuse them of not
[43:42] being able to receive the promises for
[43:43] their day. But we know in Hebrews 11, it
[43:46] says they did receive the promises for
[43:49] that day. But there's a greater promise
[43:51] that they were looking for. They were
[43:54] led by the spirit of God to do the
[43:56] things that they did in their lives.
[43:58] Now, Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus is the same
[44:01] yesterday, today, and forever. We know,
[44:03] brother Brown would campaign on that
[44:04] because it's a true promise of God. If
[44:07] Jesus did something in in his day, he'll
[44:09] do it again for us in this day. It's a
[44:11] promise. And it also says that we're
[44:13] looking for a city. So, we're not
[44:15] looking to build a city or a kingdom in
[44:17] this place, but we're looking for a
[44:19] better place. We're looking for a place
[44:22] that God has promised us. But it it
[44:25] gives a warning here because there's an
[44:26] accusation that's coming. And that
[44:28] accusation is to be carried away by a
[44:31] strange doctrine, a a you know, diverse
[44:34] doctrines, things that would be
[44:35] incorrect because Satan would want
[44:37] nothing more than to drag us away from
[44:39] the truth. That's what he's done from
[44:41] the beginning. Unbelief, Brother
[44:42] Brandham said, is as old as eating. And
[44:45] much of the word of God was considered,
[44:47] but there was that little bit of a lie.
[44:50] Brother Brandham was telling, he said,
[44:51] uh, a story of these group of men that
[44:53] were at a home meeting and they had seen
[44:55] the light, the truth on water baptism
[44:57] and were determined to be baptized in
[44:59] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:00] because that's what the scriptures tells
[45:02] us to be baptized by. And he said, one
[45:05] man got up in the home and rose up and
[45:07] spoke in tongues and said, "Hold on to
[45:09] what you got. stay hold fast to what you
[45:11] have, you'll be blessed." And all the
[45:13] other men said, "Well, I guess that's
[45:15] what we'll do." So, they didn't come and
[45:16] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[45:18] You see, Satan's accusation was trying
[45:21] to get them men to step away from the
[45:23] word and they got some man got enthused
[45:27] and he spoke in the name of the Lord and
[45:28] God had never even spoke to him because
[45:30] you've got to examine your vision by the
[45:33] word. If your vision doesn't line up
[45:35] with the word, it's of no effect.
[45:38] So these these group of believers that
[45:40] we've been studying on here in Hebrews
[45:42] 11, they didn't turn back from the
[45:44] promise. They kept pressing. They kept
[45:47] going. There was something in them, the
[45:49] spirit of God driving them to something
[45:51] greater than themselves. But it actually
[45:54] says that these all died in the faith,
[45:57] not having received the promises, but
[45:59] having seen them a far off, and were
[46:01] persuaded them, embraced them, and
[46:03] confessed that they were strangers and
[46:05] pilgrims on the earth. For they say that
[46:08] such things declare plainly that they
[46:09] seek a country. And truly, if they had
[46:11] been mindful of that country from which
[46:13] they came out, they may have had an
[46:15] opportunity to have returned. But now
[46:17] they desired a better country. We don't
[46:19] want to go back to the things of the
[46:20] world. We've got a better country to go
[46:22] to. We don't want to go back to the old
[46:24] ways. There's nothing in Egypt. The
[46:26] garlics and the leaks. There's nothing
[46:28] there for me. I'm going to a city that's
[46:31] got gold, streets of gold. It's got
[46:34] Jesus. It's got a promise.
[46:37] So that promise includes us. You know,
[46:40] Hebrews let Paul, he's speaking. He
[46:41] goes, "What would I say of Gideon,
[46:43] Barack, Samson?" He goes through so
[46:45] many. He talks about they were cruel
[46:47] mockings and scourges. How their bonds
[46:50] of imprisonment, Saul. He said, "All
[46:52] these having obtained a good report
[46:54] through faith received not the promise,
[46:57] God providing something better for us,
[47:00] that they without us should not be
[47:02] perfect." So God's got us in this
[47:03] promise. It isn't just for them. It's
[47:06] for us. God's got your name included.
[47:08] He's got my name included.
[47:10] What a wonderful thing.
[47:13] But we have to stand the reproach. And
[47:15] if they had to stand the reproach,
[47:17] mustn't we also stand the reproach?
[47:20] Brother Ram says this. He says, "You
[47:22] always have to stand the reproach in
[47:24] order to give your testing." Every man
[47:27] that comes to Christ must first be
[47:28] childed for the purpose that God has
[47:31] ordained you for. And remember, if you
[47:34] can just keep quiet, remember if he has
[47:36] called you for this, there's nothing
[47:38] that can keep it from happening. There's
[47:40] not enough devils in torment, but what
[47:42] God's word will be made manifest. You're
[47:45] born for a purpose, and nobody can take
[47:47] that your place. You might have
[47:50] impersonators and everything else, but
[47:52] they'll never take your place. God's
[47:54] word will triumph. It cannot fail.
[47:57] There's where every Christian ought to
[47:59] stand. Know that. And the trials will
[48:02] come up and seem every way to you. But
[48:04] remember, God has a purpose and it'll
[48:07] work out all right. I don't know about
[48:09] you, but that boosts my faith to know
[48:11] that it's going to work out all right.
[48:12] No matter what the situation, no matter
[48:14] what accusation Satan wants to throw at
[48:16] you or me, as long as we're found in the
[48:19] word, our lives are lining up. We're
[48:21] walking in the promise, we're going to
[48:23] receive the promise. We got a cloud of
[48:25] witnesses, as Paul says. A lot of this
[48:27] study comes out of Hebrews. But there's
[48:28] a great cloud of witnesses that tells us
[48:30] you can make it. Telling me that I can
[48:33] make it, but we've got to line up to the
[48:35] word. We can't get enthused. A lot of
[48:38] people die with enthusiasm.
[48:40] I watch people year after year said on
[48:42] message pews. Brother Jason, he this
[48:45] morning we had a wonderful service. He
[48:46] was talking about people get into a cage
[48:49] and they come up to them bars on that
[48:50] cage and and just enough to shout, just
[48:53] enough to rejoice, but then it's back
[48:55] into the cage when Monday comes. It's
[48:57] back into the cage when Tuesday,
[48:58] Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday, we're back
[49:00] up to the bar again, about to get out.
[49:03] You've got to break free if you're going
[49:04] to receive the promise. You've got to be
[49:06] willing to step through. Maybe it's
[49:09] uncomfortable. Maybe it's unknown. But
[49:12] God promised. He said, "I will never
[49:13] leave you. I will never forsake you." So
[49:15] he made us a promise that he will
[49:17] continue on with us. That's right. This
[49:20] thought it come to me because I was
[49:21] reading the book of Job. And if there
[49:23] ever was a man of God, I believe it was
[49:25] Job. Talk about a man that went through
[49:27] so much. And you know what I like about
[49:28] Job is me having two girls. Job was a
[49:31] real daddy. You know, he cared for his
[49:34] children. Job made a sacrifice
[49:36] continually. He was a good friend. He
[49:39] give advice. He loved people. He wanted
[49:41] to be a man of God. And you know, Satan
[49:45] accused him one day. And Job didn't even
[49:47] know any of this was happening. He had
[49:49] no idea that any of this was taking
[49:51] place. But God and Satan, there was a
[49:53] council that was held, Brother Brandon
[49:54] would say, and he said, "Did you
[49:56] consider my servant Job? There's no man
[49:59] like him in the earth. That man went
[50:01] through so much, but he held on to the
[50:05] promise because God made him a promise."
[50:08] And what what brought this thought
[50:09] actually to me was as I was reading his
[50:11] his friends, his so-called friends,
[50:14] their accusation against him. You know,
[50:16] Job, God don't do this to people that
[50:19] don't sin. God doesn't punish. No, God
[50:22] is determined to see you Christlike. And
[50:25] whatever it takes, God's willing to do
[50:27] because he knows the end from the
[50:29] beginning. You may stumble your way
[50:31] through right now and you're wondering,
[50:32] why am I going through this right now?
[50:34] God knows where you're going to end up.
[50:37] So if you stay faithful, there's a
[50:38] promise for you. Now I was listening to,
[50:40] you know, reading about these friends
[50:42] and their their accusation was, you
[50:45] know, God does not do this to righteous
[50:47] men. But if you'll notice in there snuck
[50:49] a little promise, a little blessing.
[50:51] Though thy beginning was small, thy
[50:53] latter end shall increase. Did them
[50:55] friends realize that they were blessing
[50:57] Job and everything that accusation? If
[50:59] you'll repent, this will happen. Job
[51:01] held on to the word and God give every
[51:03] single thing to him. He come to a grave
[51:06] in a full O age. He was restored
[51:08] everything that he had lost. He was
[51:10] given a promise and it was given by God
[51:13] because he stayed with the word.
[51:16] Think about Jesus. Jesus came in a time
[51:18] of a massive unbelief. Brother Brandon
[51:21] would say perhaps even like today a
[51:24] massive unbelief. But he had one
[51:27] promise. Jesus made it on one promise. I
[51:29] will not leave his soul in hell. Neither
[51:32] will I let my holy one see corruption.
[51:34] Me and you have thousands of promises
[51:36] that we can go back into this word and
[51:38] we can see God place a promise in there
[51:40] for me and you. He promised the Holy
[51:42] Ghost. He promised healing. He promised
[51:44] deliverance. He promised he would be the
[51:46] same yesterday, today, and forever for
[51:48] my situations and for your situations.
[51:50] He promised to be the same. And Christ
[51:52] had one. But he made that one promise
[51:54] for you and for me. And how wonderful it
[51:58] is to know that he he made a promise for
[52:00] you and me. You say, "So, well, Malachi,
[52:04] you don't know what I'm going through
[52:05] right now. I'm going through situations
[52:07] and I've got mental battles and and all
[52:09] these things. I don't know how to stand
[52:11] reproach." Well, Brother Brham in this
[52:13] message gives us the idea of how to do
[52:14] it. This is the way Jesus did it. He
[52:17] connected himself with God. Brother
[52:20] Brham said Jesus when he had come into
[52:23] the world, he came into a time of
[52:25] massive unbelief. That's right. He came
[52:27] in such a way that it caused the
[52:28] unbeliever to disbelieve more. God just
[52:32] he says it's so wonderful father he
[52:34] brought right in time and give him as a
[52:36] people thought an illegitimate child and
[52:38] never sent him in any schools and so
[52:40] forth. He was an odd sort of a boy but
[52:42] yet there was something about him that
[52:44] seemed to be what he said was the truth.
[52:46] What he spoke it was so and he never
[52:49] took credit for himself but he connected
[52:51] himself with God. It's not me that doeth
[52:54] the works. He said you claim God to be
[52:56] your father and you say he is. Then you
[52:58] don't believe me. If you can't believe
[53:00] me, believe the works that I do, for
[53:02] they are my credentials. They are the
[53:04] ones that testify of me. They are the
[53:07] one that speaks whether it's the truth.
[53:09] He'd go on to say, "Unbelief never
[53:10] stopped him. He just kept right on
[53:13] going. He healed the sick, raised the
[53:15] dead, cleansed the lepers, went right
[53:17] on. And when they didn't believe that
[53:18] such things could happen, he their
[53:20] unbelief didn't stop Jesus at all. He
[53:23] went right on doing just what he was
[53:25] supposed to do." That's the way we're
[53:27] supposed to be. We want to go on doing
[53:28] right what God has called us to do. And
[53:30] I ain't going to let anybody else talk
[53:32] me out of this word because it's been
[53:34] revealed to me. Like John said, he wept
[53:37] because he's seen his name in the book.
[53:39] I wonder, can we see our name in the
[53:41] book this evening?
[53:43] We're not to be a sad, mopey Christian.
[53:45] This is not a a life of rules and
[53:48] regulations and woe is me and I have to
[53:50] live this way. This is a love affair.
[53:52] God died for you and he revealed this
[53:54] message to you. Satan's accusation is
[53:57] you can't make it. But Christ come that
[53:59] you could make it. Unbelief didn't
[54:02] bother Jesus. In fact, when when the
[54:04] opportunity presented itself with
[54:06] unbelief, he cast it out. I think about
[54:08] Jaras's daughter when he got in there to
[54:11] heal that little girl and all them
[54:12] people were laughing and making fun of
[54:14] him, saying, you know, what are you
[54:15] going to do? She's dead. He said, get
[54:18] out. That's what we ought to do in our
[54:19] lives when we get around unbelief. We
[54:21] get around situations that that try to
[54:24] drag you down. Get out. Satan, I don't
[54:26] have time for your accusations. I've got
[54:29] a promise. God promised me. And you'll
[54:31] notice if you'll just do that, he said,
[54:34] "Little girl, come alive. There's life."
[54:36] When you get unbelief out of the way,
[54:39] life comes in. That's the way we ought
[54:41] to be. If we can just push out the
[54:43] doubts, if we can just push out the
[54:44] fears, let life come in because God's
[54:47] got life for you. Are you willing to
[54:49] accept it? Are you willing to take him
[54:51] at his word? That's the one thing we're
[54:53] fortified by is God's word. Unbelief,
[54:57] brother Ram says this, does not stop
[55:00] God. Does not stop his program. Does not
[55:03] stop his move. Does not stop nothing but
[55:06] the unbeliever. It stops him in his sin.
[55:09] And there he is looking at himself. What
[55:11] a position to be in. It ain't going to
[55:13] stop God. You can be as arrogant as you
[55:14] want to be against this message. You can
[55:16] call it every kind of other name. You
[55:18] can blasphe it. You can do whatever you
[55:20] want to do. You ain't going to stop God
[55:22] and you ain't going to stop God's people
[55:23] that are going on with God. It's just
[55:26] going to caught there and looking at
[55:27] yourself. That's all it's going to be.
[55:28] Because one of these days, God will
[55:30] prove that this message is true. Amen.
[55:33] He says, "Today, they say there's no
[55:35] such thing as the Holy Ghost." But that
[55:37] don't stop the people. They go right on
[55:38] getting it just the same. Say there's no
[55:41] divine healing, but they go right on
[55:42] getting healed just the same. Say
[55:44] there's no joy, but people go on
[55:46] shouting just the same. There's no such
[55:48] thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[55:50] that you Pentecostals talk about. But
[55:52] the people are filled with it every day.
[55:54] They might not be able to explain it,
[55:56] but they know they got it. He said
[55:58] that's the main thing. So unbelief
[56:00] doesn't stop God. We know we got it. I'm
[56:03] so glad to associate myself with people
[56:06] who has it. And I believe this evening
[56:07] I'm associate myself with people who's
[56:09] got it. I don't know about you, but I'm
[56:11] happy to have it. God give it to me.
[56:14] I'll take it. You know, I I I should be
[56:16] like, you know, I heard brother Andrew
[56:17] Glover one time when he was preaching.
[56:19] And he said, "I should be a statistic."
[56:20] You know, I should too. Should be a
[56:22] statistic of unbelief is what I should
[56:24] be. But God planted a seed inside of me.
[56:27] And he turned my life around in a way
[56:29] that it shouldn't have
[56:31] went. The greatest hindrance that the
[56:33] church has to receiving God's promise is
[56:36] unbelief. We're scared. We're always
[56:39] thinking God actually ain't going to do
[56:41] what he said he'll do. But if we'll just
[56:43] take God at his word, if we'll believe
[56:45] him for what he said he'll do, he'll do
[56:47] it. He'll stand by. It might not come
[56:49] out the way you think it's going to come
[56:50] out and it may take a little time, but
[56:52] God didn't give us a timeline. He just
[56:54] said, "I'll do it." He said, "If if you
[56:57] say to this mountain, you may have one
[56:59] little ex insignificant grain of sand."
[57:01] Brother Brandham said, "Move." But he
[57:03] said, "That mountain started moving."
[57:05] That's the way we ought to believe. But
[57:06] but people today, they don't want to
[57:08] believe. They want to turn over. And you
[57:10] know, like Romans 1 says to a reprobate
[57:12] mind. That's and I never understood that
[57:14] as well as I did the other day. Brother
[57:15] Jason said that a reparate mind is is a
[57:18] mind void of judgment. What a place to
[57:20] be when you're so cold on God that
[57:22] you're not even worried about the
[57:23] judgments of God. What an awful place.
[57:26] What an awful condition to be in.
[57:29] There's no promise in that. There's no
[57:31] promise in unbelief. You know, I think
[57:34] about the story brother would say. You
[57:36] know, uh a minister on the radio said,
[57:38] "I'll give $1,000 to anybody that can
[57:40] pro prove divine healing." Brother Bram
[57:42] said he had a man with a cancer, I think
[57:44] it was, or something that fell off. He
[57:46] went and got the man's doctor and he
[57:47] went and got uh uh the man and he got
[57:50] the news article that was written and
[57:52] went to this guy uh turns out the guy
[57:55] the money was over in Texas or
[57:56] something. There's always an excuse, you
[57:57] know, and uh he said, "I wanted to
[58:00] collect $1,000 for the missionary
[58:02] field." He said that man said, "I tell
[58:04] you what, let me get a little girl in
[58:05] here. Let me cut her hand. Let me see
[58:08] you heal her." He said, "Sir, you're in
[58:09] need of mental healing. He said, "Let
[58:12] alone worrying about a girl's, you know,
[58:14] a physical healing, cutting a child's
[58:17] hand." He said, "But that's that same
[58:18] old devil." He said that sir said, "I
[58:21] won't believe it. I don't care how many
[58:23] miracles you could prove. I won't
[58:24] believe it." He said, "Certainly not.
[58:26] You're an unbeliever. It wasn't sent to
[58:28] unbelievers, sir. It was only sent to
[58:30] believers. That's the only one that's
[58:31] ever going to see it." So the only ones
[58:35] that are ever going to see it is the
[58:36] believer. Little while in the world
[58:38] seeth me no more, yet ye shall see me.
[58:40] the believer, right? Brother Ram says
[58:43] this. He says, "If he lives, won't he
[58:45] produce the same thing? Won't his life
[58:48] produce as it did if it's living in
[58:50] you?" You know, that same old devil
[58:52] tries to say, "This message is not the
[58:54] truth." But, but God's going to prove
[58:57] someday that it is the truth. The second
[59:00] coming of the Lord is going to take
[59:01] place. If it doesn't take place, then
[59:04] we're all in error. We believe for no
[59:06] reason. All hope is lost. Our families
[59:09] that have went on, we're never going to
[59:10] see again. But we've been given a
[59:13] promise because he is coming. Brother
[59:15] Adam, he was talking in this tape. He
[59:17] said, "You scare people." Talking about
[59:19] the second coming of the Lord. He said,
[59:20] "Why scared? If your life is right with
[59:24] God, that's the most blessed thing we
[59:25] could ever think of. There is nothing so
[59:28] important as the coming of the Lord."
[59:30] And you notice that you sometimes you
[59:31] talk about the end of the world and all
[59:33] these events that are taking place.
[59:34] People get uncomfortable, but you don't
[59:36] have to be uncomfortable. Satan's
[59:38] accusation is you. He wants to make you
[59:41] uncomfortable. But if you've received a
[59:43] promise and if your life is lining up to
[59:45] the word, there's nothing to be afraid
[59:46] of. There's no bomb that Russia could
[59:49] ever sin. There's no war that could ever
[59:51] rise up. There's no no nothing, no
[59:53] pestilence, no nothing that can separate
[59:55] us from the love of God. There's a
[59:58] promise given to the believer. Brother
[1:00:00] Brandham says this. says, "There's
[1:00:01] nothing as important as the coming of
[1:00:03] the Lord. For if he does not come, we've
[1:00:05] been found in false witnesses. Our dead
[1:00:08] that's in the grave are perished.
[1:00:09] There's no hope left for us. And if
[1:00:11] Jesus doesn't come visibly the second
[1:00:13] time in the very light of the second
[1:00:15] coming is so important that this week,
[1:00:17] he said that we're approaching, believe
[1:00:19] he's talking about Easter, he said that
[1:00:21] Jesus when he was approaching it at the
[1:00:23] first time, the very shadows of the
[1:00:24] cross, he spoke very little of his
[1:00:26] death, burial, and resurrection. He
[1:00:28] spoke more on his second coming than he
[1:00:30] did his death, burial, and resurrection.
[1:00:32] It's a very important
[1:00:34] subject. He said in the Old Testament,
[1:00:36] there's many times more scriptures in
[1:00:38] the Old Testament pa pertaining to the
[1:00:40] second coming of Christ than there is to
[1:00:42] the first coming or yeah, first coming
[1:00:44] of Christ. Everything to the human race
[1:00:46] now after the atonement has been made
[1:00:49] rest solemnly upon the second coming of
[1:00:52] the Lord. So everything that we have
[1:00:54] need of is is just, I believe, just
[1:00:56] around the corner. I don't know how it
[1:00:58] couldn't be. It may not be in my
[1:00:59] lifetime, but still, it's coming. The
[1:01:02] promise is coming. Paul says this in 2
[1:01:04] Timothy 4:6. He says, "For now, I am
[1:01:06] ready to be offered. The time of my
[1:01:08] departure is at hand. I have fought the
[1:01:11] good fight of faith. I have finished my
[1:01:13] course. I have kept the faith.
[1:01:15] Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of
[1:01:17] righteousness, which the Lord, the
[1:01:19] righteous judge, shall give unto that
[1:01:21] day." Now, like this, not only to me,
[1:01:23] but unto all of them that love his
[1:01:25] appearing. So there's a a crown of
[1:01:27] righteousness, not just waiting for
[1:01:29] Paul, not just waiting for Peter, not
[1:01:31] just waiting for these great men of God,
[1:01:32] William Brandham. There's a there's a
[1:01:34] promise waiting for you. There's a
[1:01:36] promise waiting for me, a crown, crown
[1:01:39] of life. So we don't want to be scared
[1:01:42] when we're caught not doing the word.
[1:01:44] Don't be scared about being caught. Be
[1:01:47] scared because you're destroying
[1:01:48] yourself. Because unbelief doesn't
[1:01:50] destroy God. It doesn't destroy his
[1:01:53] plan. It doesn't destroy his works. It
[1:01:56] only destroys the unbeliever. Unbelief
[1:01:59] only destroys the unbeliever.
[1:02:02] Romans 3 says, "For what if some did not
[1:02:04] believe? Shall their unbelief make the
[1:02:07] faith of God without an effect?" So, we
[1:02:10] want to accept God's provided way. The
[1:02:12] Pharisees one day come up to Jesus and
[1:02:14] and they claim to have sight. And Jesus
[1:02:15] said, "Because you claim to have sight,
[1:02:17] your sin remainth." But I think about
[1:02:20] that that publican that was in the
[1:02:22] temple that said, 'Lord, I'm a sinner.
[1:02:24] Have mercy on me. How many honest hearts
[1:02:27] can we have, you know, this evening that
[1:02:29] says, 'Lord, I need you. If I'm going to
[1:02:32] receive this promise, I must have you.
[1:02:35] Not a hotty spirit, a humble, contrite,
[1:02:38] broken up spirit that will receive a
[1:02:41] promise. Brother Bram says this. He
[1:02:43] said, "What kind of church is it going
[1:02:44] to take to receive a promise?" He said,
[1:02:46] "It's going to take a scriptural church.
[1:02:49] He says, "And that's the great church of
[1:02:50] the living God has done in these last
[1:02:52] days. It's to bring the people the
[1:02:54] recognition the living God among the
[1:02:57] church. That's what it's raised up for.
[1:02:59] And the church is to come back not to a
[1:03:01] creed like a Roman dogma or something.
[1:03:03] It's to come back to the Bible. Get back
[1:03:06] to the word no matter what it says. Just
[1:03:08] cope with the word. Not to use our own
[1:03:11] thinking. Stay with the word because
[1:03:14] it's the promise of God." Another place
[1:03:17] he says this, he says, "It isn't a
[1:03:19] change of mind. It's a new creature."
[1:03:21] The church doesn't need a facelifting.
[1:03:24] It needs a conversion. It needs to be a
[1:03:26] new creature. And unbelief will push you
[1:03:29] over to the side. Many of them say,
[1:03:30] "Well, now I believe, you know, the Holy
[1:03:32] Ghost. We believe in the Holy Ghost in
[1:03:35] our place, but we believe when we
[1:03:36] believe God, we receive the Holy Ghost."
[1:03:38] Now, you see how close that is. He said,
[1:03:40] "What if the disciples after six days,
[1:03:42] Matthew said to Andrew, you know what? I
[1:03:44] believe we already got it. Let's accept
[1:03:46] it by faith. He said it never would have
[1:03:48] happened. The only way that they knew
[1:03:50] how it would be when it come was what
[1:03:52] the way the scriptures to prove what it
[1:03:54] would be when it did come. That's right.
[1:03:57] So, we don't want to just be enthused.
[1:04:00] We want a life. We want something behind
[1:04:02] it. It takes a life, not just
[1:04:05] enthusiasm.
[1:04:07] He says in these last days, what's it
[1:04:09] going to take? It's a scriptural trained
[1:04:11] church on the line for there's going to
[1:04:13] be carnal impersonations rise. The Bible
[1:04:15] said as Jambre and Janis Janice
[1:04:18] withstood Moses so will these men of
[1:04:20] reprobate mind concerning the truth. So
[1:04:22] there's going to be
[1:04:24] impersonators. I think about uh Jeremiah
[1:04:27] and Haniah. Brother Brandon was talking
[1:04:29] about he said that Haniah you know
[1:04:32] Jeremiah walked into the king's court
[1:04:33] with a wooden yoke upon his back and he
[1:04:36] had thus sayeth the Lord Nebuchadnezzar
[1:04:38] is coming where you know the the king of
[1:04:40] the north is coming and Haniah rose up
[1:04:43] and got all enthused and said thus
[1:04:45] sayaith the Lord the vessels of the Lord
[1:04:47] be full in two years. He said his vision
[1:04:50] didn't line up with the word. He got all
[1:04:52] enthused and he got out of the word. He
[1:04:54] said but I like the attitude of
[1:04:56] Jeremiah. Jeremiah never even argued
[1:04:58] with him. He said, "Amen, Haniah, let it
[1:05:01] be." That's the way of a true believer,
[1:05:03] not to argue God's word. We're not here
[1:05:05] to fight quotes with quotes and
[1:05:06] scriptures with scriptures, and we don't
[1:05:08] want to see anyone cast down. We want to
[1:05:10] only see people prosper. He had a good
[1:05:13] attitude. He said, "Amen, Haniah. These
[1:05:15] people are are my people, too." Jeremiah
[1:05:17] realized that, you know, the he he was a
[1:05:20] Jew, and he loved them people just the
[1:05:22] same as anyone else. But but he had to
[1:05:24] stay with the word. We love people, but
[1:05:28] we got to stay with the word. Don't let
[1:05:29] anybody else separate you from this
[1:05:31] word. And Jeremiah started to walk out
[1:05:34] and God come back to him and said, "Go
[1:05:36] back and tell him I never spoke to him."
[1:05:39] And within that year that he would die
[1:05:40] and it happened just the way that
[1:05:42] Jeremiah the prophet had said. So
[1:05:43] there's a danger to
[1:05:45] enthusiasm. We got something to be
[1:05:47] enthused about. But we want to make sure
[1:05:49] that we're sealed in, that we've met
[1:05:51] God's requirement. Brother Ram says
[1:05:53] this. God makes a promise that he would
[1:05:55] bless, but those blessings are under
[1:05:57] conditions. You've got to meet those
[1:05:59] conditions to make that work. So, we got
[1:06:03] something to be enthused about. I think
[1:06:04] about Paul and Silas, though. Here they
[1:06:06] are bound in chains in a jail in a
[1:06:09] prison cell. Probably couldn't lift
[1:06:11] their hands. Probably couldn't worship
[1:06:12] the Lord. But they had a life behind it.
[1:06:15] And they got enthused. So enthused they
[1:06:17] began to sing. And you notice when they
[1:06:19] began to sing, prison bars started
[1:06:21] busting. chain started falling off and
[1:06:23] even to the point that they were able to
[1:06:25] to tell the jailer, "Fear not, you know,
[1:06:28] we're all still here." And that jailer
[1:06:31] was was so convinced by their message.
[1:06:34] They lived a life. They lived something
[1:06:36] to be worthy of the gospel of. And
[1:06:38] that's what we want to do. They had
[1:06:41] perfect faith. Brother Brandham said,
[1:06:42] "That's what it's going to take. It's
[1:06:44] going to take a perfect faith." Let's
[1:06:46] see anybody accomplish anything by their
[1:06:48] unbelief. Have you known anybody to
[1:06:51] accomplish anything by worry, by doubts,
[1:06:54] by fears? Faith. Brother Ram said,
[1:06:58] "Faith has gotten me out many times." He
[1:07:00] says, "What does faith do? What what
[1:07:02] does the word of God do? It creates a
[1:07:04] faith." Well, what could faith do if you
[1:07:06] was going to be shot in the morning? He
[1:07:08] said, "It could deliver me. It has done
[1:07:10] it many times." See, see, sure, there's
[1:07:12] no value in unbelief at all. There is
[1:07:15] value in faith. Believing God's word and
[1:07:18] taking God at his
[1:07:20] word. Faith is not ridiculous. It's not
[1:07:23] ridiculous to the believer and it's not
[1:07:24] ridiculous to
[1:07:26] God. Faith is, Brother Ram says, faith
[1:07:29] is ridiculous to everybody, but to God
[1:07:31] and the one that has it. Now, it's not
[1:07:33] ridiculous to God because he's the
[1:07:35] author of faith. And it's not ridiculous
[1:07:37] to man that has the faith because he's a
[1:07:40] believer in God. So, it isn't ridiculous
[1:07:42] to him. God is the author of it. He
[1:07:44] created it. And the man who received it
[1:07:46] from God, of course, it isn't ridiculous
[1:07:48] to God because he created it. He knows
[1:07:50] what it is. And the believer that
[1:07:52] receives it, it isn't ridiculous to him
[1:07:55] because by is the substance of things
[1:07:57] hoped for, the evidence of things he
[1:07:59] can't see, taste, smell, smell, hear,
[1:08:02] but he knows it's there. It's not
[1:08:04] ridiculous to him because it's just as
[1:08:06] good as done. He don't have to worry
[1:08:08] anything about it. He knows God told him
[1:08:10] and God said it. That's enough for him.
[1:08:13] All right. So, we want to have faith.
[1:08:15] God wants us to have faith. And unbelief
[1:08:17] won't destroy his plans. It won't do a
[1:08:19] thing to them. He'll go right on just
[1:08:21] the same. I'd like for somebody to take
[1:08:23] their unbelief, he said, and stop the
[1:08:25] son. Oh, yes. He said, but it did for
[1:08:27] Joshua. Faith will do it. Unbelief will
[1:08:30] get you nowhere.
[1:08:32] So, we want to have perfect faith. We
[1:08:34] want to be lined up with the word
[1:08:35] because that's what'll get us there.
[1:08:37] Think about the children of Israel. The
[1:08:39] reason they could not enter into rest
[1:08:41] was because the word they heard was not
[1:08:43] mixed with faith. The word must be mixed
[1:08:46] with faith. It says in Hebrews here it
[1:08:49] says, "Let us therefore fear lest a
[1:08:51] promise being left us of entering into
[1:08:53] his rest any of you should seem to come
[1:08:56] short of it. For unto us was the gospel
[1:08:58] preached as well as unto them." But the
[1:09:00] word preached did not profit them
[1:09:02] because it was not mixed with faith in
[1:09:04] them that heard it. For we which have
[1:09:06] believed do enter into rest, as he said,
[1:09:08] as I have sworn in my wrath that they
[1:09:10] shall enter into my rest, although the
[1:09:13] works were finished from the foundation
[1:09:14] of the world. For he spake in a certain
[1:09:16] place of the seventh day on this wise,
[1:09:18] and God did rest on the seventh day from
[1:09:20] all his works. And in this place again,
[1:09:23] if they shall enter into my rest, seeing
[1:09:25] therefore it remainth that some must
[1:09:26] enter therein, and they to whom it was
[1:09:29] first preached enter not because of
[1:09:30] unbelief. So we're not looking towards a
[1:09:33] day, you know, the Ephesians 4:30 says,
[1:09:36] "Grieve not the Holy Spirit." That is
[1:09:38] the rest. The Holy Spirit is your rest.
[1:09:42] And it takes faith to enter into that
[1:09:46] rest. So there's no need in arguing
[1:09:49] God's word. There's no need in
[1:09:51] unbelief. There's only faith, perfect
[1:09:54] faith. Think about this in in Jude 19.
[1:09:57] says, "Michael the archangel when
[1:09:59] contending with the devil, he disputed
[1:10:01] about that disputing about the body of
[1:10:03] Moses. He d not bring him a railing
[1:10:06] accusation, but said the Lord rebuked
[1:10:08] thee." So that right there proves it's
[1:10:09] not of God to argue. He knew what
[1:10:12] happened to Moses. Hey, I'm not got time
[1:10:13] to argue with you, Satan. That's the way
[1:10:15] we ought to be in our lives. I ain't got
[1:10:17] time to argue with you, Satan. You want
[1:10:19] to argue that? Well, you know, is the
[1:10:21] message really the truth? No, it is the
[1:10:23] truth. I ain't got time to argue with
[1:10:24] you. Well, I seen on ww.disbelieve
[1:10:26] disbelieveth this.com. No, I ain't got
[1:10:29] time for that. I'm marching on with a
[1:10:31] promise. This has been revealed to me
[1:10:33] that it's the truth.
[1:10:37] Satan wants us to argue God's word. I
[1:10:38] think about that little woman that was
[1:10:40] caught in the act of adultery. Them
[1:10:42] Pharisees, they brought that woman, they
[1:10:43] drug her up, this woman of ill fame,
[1:10:46] caught in the very act before the most
[1:10:49] high, holy God, Jesus, standing before
[1:10:52] in human flesh. And they they wanted to
[1:10:55] to accuse Jesus. They wanted to get him
[1:10:57] on this law. They didn't worry about the
[1:10:58] man. Who cares about the man? The man
[1:10:59] was caught. He should be stoned, too.
[1:11:01] You know, we don't worry about the man,
[1:11:02] but we want to see what you're going to
[1:11:04] do about this woman. We want to accuse
[1:11:05] you, Jesus. Are you going to make the
[1:11:06] right decision? He just stooped down
[1:11:08] into the sand, started writing their
[1:11:10] sins, maybe perhaps one by one, they
[1:11:13] started leaving. We don't know what he
[1:11:14] wrote, but maybe it was their sins. That
[1:11:16] woman standing there, he said,"Woman,
[1:11:19] where are thine accusers?" Now the one
[1:11:21] that could have accused her gave her a
[1:11:23] promise and said, "Neither do I accuse
[1:11:25] you. Go and sin no more." And that woman
[1:11:27] left with a promise of life. Didn't he
[1:11:30] do the same for us? He could have
[1:11:32] accused us of of the wrongs that we done
[1:11:34] in our life, but instead he stretched
[1:11:37] his arms on Calvary. And he gave me a
[1:11:39] promise. He gave you a promise that this
[1:11:43] promise, as Acts 2:38 says, is to you
[1:11:45] and to your children. As many as them
[1:11:47] are far off, as many as our Lord our God
[1:11:49] shall call. Are we going to take his
[1:11:51] promise today? Musicians, if you please
[1:11:54] come, we'll close on
[1:11:56] this. You feel down sometimes you
[1:11:58] wonder, you know, am I going to make it?
[1:12:01] Am I not going to make it? Christ said
[1:12:03] you will make it as long as you're in
[1:12:05] the word. Read this here. It says, I'm
[1:12:08] telling you, there's no other fountain I
[1:12:09] know but the fountain. It cleansed me
[1:12:11] when I was dirty. It keeps me cleansed
[1:12:14] because I want to live right. It drink
[1:12:16] the fresh water that fills my soul with
[1:12:18] joy. I can be ever so down and feel that
[1:12:21] I can't hardly go another round. Can't
[1:12:24] go nowhere else. Then I kneel down and
[1:12:26] put my finger on a promise and say, Lord
[1:12:27] God, thou art my strength. Thou art my
[1:12:31] satisfaction. Thou art my all in all. I
[1:12:34] begin to feel something bubbling up from
[1:12:36] inside me. There I come out of it. You
[1:12:39] want to come out of it this evening? I
[1:12:41] want to come out of every unbelief
[1:12:43] that's in my life. just put my finger on
[1:12:46] a promise of God and say, "Lord, you
[1:12:49] promised it." When I'm going through
[1:12:51] situations, life's not always a a bed of
[1:12:54] ease. We know that. But God gave us a
[1:12:57] promise. He said, "I'll never leave you.
[1:12:59] I'll never forsake you." He's so good to
[1:13:01] us. Are you happy to serve him? And we
[1:13:04] can stand to our feet. God bless you
[1:13:06] this evening. I hope something helps you
[1:13:07] this evening. Just want to encourage you
[1:13:10] to keep fighting, keep believing,
[1:13:12] because there's promises for you.
[1:13:13] There's promises for me. God loves you
[1:13:16] very
[1:13:17] much. Let you sing, buddy.
