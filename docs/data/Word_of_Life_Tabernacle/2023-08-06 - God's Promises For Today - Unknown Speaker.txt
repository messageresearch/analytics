to see you back there and each one of you that are here this morning God bless you we'll talk Justin Atlanta made it back this morning God bless you and all of our regular folks good to have you today Exodus chapter 6 and verse 1. we're gonna kind of continue a little bit from what we preached Wednesday night if you weren't here weren't able to hear that you can go back and watch it if you want to we'll just kind of pick that up this morning and I want to talk about God's promises for today it says then the Lord said unto Moses now shalt thou see what I will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land and God spake unto Moses and said unto him I am the Lord I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty by my name Jehovah was I not known to them and I have also established my Covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel whom the Egyptians keep in bondage and I have remembered my Covenant he said wherefore say unto the children of Israel I am the Lord he said I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians I will rid you out of their bondage I will redeem you with a stretched out armor with great judgments I will take you to me for a people I will be to you a god you shall know that I am the Lord your God which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians he said I will bring you in unto the land concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob I will give it to you for an Heritage he said I am the Lord and Moses spakes so unto the children of Israel but they hearken not unto Moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning Wednesday night we spoke on anguish of spirit and the word anguish means to be short of spirit to be impatient in patience brought on by circumstances by things that were going on around them they were impatient with God because of the way things had worked out and so God they come to Moses we we relate the story to you and they told him why why have things gotten harder why why is it worse now than it was when we first came into the land why why here you brought the message to us and we believed it and and and we agreed with it but now now it seems like things have just gotten worse they didn't work out the way that we thought that they would and and then in Exodus 6 God responds and and he says I gave them seven promises seven seven I Wills that he gave them he said I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians I will rid you out of their bondage I I will redeem you I will tell thank you to me for a people I will be to you a God I will bring in you in unto the land I will give it to you for inheritage listen he was he was reinforcing to them the promises that he was revealing to them the promises that pertain to their day and their hour and yet they could not see that those promises were relevant because of the task Masters because of the hard bondage because of the struggles that they were going through they could not see oh my how many times has anguished of spirit has the shortness of our of our spiritual sight that kept us from seeing what God promised us in this day there are promises specific to our day not just for 40 years ago not just for tomorrow but promises specific for today he said I will redeem you I will bring you out I'm going to give you the land and that's the time that we live in today he said I will it was a positive promise this is a positive message but many people only see the restrictions they only see what they can't do and the reason why that's all that they see is because they of Anguish a spirit of they see the bondage they can't look by faith and so we found out Wednesday night that the the antidote to that was to wait on the Lord they wait on the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings like Eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint so we wait on God brother Branham tells us that man is always praising God religious man for what he done and always pointing people to what he's going to do and then ignoring what he's doing that's right isn't that just the nature of man he said that's just man he's made that way he's always been that way so we find that that was the case when Jesus come to the Earth that all of the promises were fulfilled in him yet people could not see the Fulfillment of the promise because he was walking in flesh there's something about the fact that God manifests his promise in flesh you realize he only manifests his promise through flesh how many know that this morning God could have chosen to use anything he wanted to use that manifest his promise but his promised word is manifested in flesh and so his promised word was manifested in the flesh of Jesus and they could not see it because they knew that Jesus was a man he was a man but he was also God right but they could see that he was a man brother Stewart so they could not recognize the promises of God in that man and so now when Jesus come to the Earth and and he began to he began to speak and he began to do he began to act what was it all the promises of the Old Testament someone say all this morning every promise of the Old Testament was fulfilled in the body of Jesus Christ every one of them oh my all the types all the ceremony there's a reason why we don't drag goats up here and sacrifice them there's a reason why I don't wear a linen ephod and walk up here and do all kinds of things and and we I don't have a holy of holy so we can go into it or Tabernacle or shoe bread there's a reason why we don't do those things because all of the types were fulfilled in Christ all of the Old Testament was wrapped up in a body of Flesh and was displayed he said I didn't come to do away with the law but I come to fulfill the law he was the Old Testament manifested this is what God meant this is what God intended this is what God was right so now but people looking back looking forward could not see what was going on right then yeah that God hidden failed in flesh go listen to the unveiling of God when you have time go go sit in your home or in the car or somewhere listen to the unveiling of God body God unveiled before us and you'll find brother Brandon talking about these things now when when he came to the Earth all these promises were fulfilled the promise of that day was fulfilled in Christ Psalms 40 and 7 he said lo I come in the volume of the book in other words in the entirety of the book it is written of me and Hebrews in Hebrews Paul lets us know that he's speaking of himself a speaking of Christ look 421 he began to say unto them this day and wouldn't you like to have been there that morning what a positive message this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears that's a positive message right there but they couldn't see it because they said this is Joseph's son this is the carpenter we grew up around him we some of us went to school with him we uh you know or whatever that it was that they did we played in the dirt with him and they couldn't see past the veil of the flesh oh God if we could only see it this morning so he was the manifestation of all the promises of the Old Testament all the types all the Shadows all the ceremonies all was manifested in Jesus Christ now in the New Testament so our the Bible is made up of two Testaments or two covenants the Old Testament was was wrapped up in Christ and then we have a new testament now the New Testament or the New Covenant also contains promises right and this is what they they were trying to understand well why are we under bondage why are we going through these things but he said the promises are still true God's still doing what he does and remember when you get sick when you get lonely when you get discouraged when there's people's like nothing's working out remember God still keeps his word he keeps his word today he'll keep his word tomorrow he kept his word yesterday he has not changed because you messed up he has not changed because you're different than he used to be or if I could drive that home to you today he has not changed because you're different he didn't change me oh God because you made a mistake he did not change because you got old he did not change because we live in another time he said I'm God and I change the heart Hallelujah so the unchanging God the same yesterday today and forever is still God today and any promise of the word is able to be manifested in your flesh today now we don't manifest the Old Testament ceremony but what do we manifest the New Testament right oh my God I'm going to show you that in just a moment so now in the New Testament all these promises were made but all to be revealed at the time of the end God Reveals His word how you've all heard brother Brown say it how does he fulfill his word by bringing it to pass God interprets his word by bringing it to pass right so now we find in the scripture if you just permit me for a moment to go over some things that you know but just to reinforce our faith we find a scripture in Daniel 12 and 4. he says Thou Daniel shut up the worse and seal the book now what was this the Old Testament was revealed the Seal of the Old Testament was broke in Jesus Christ but the Seal of the whole thing the whole the entire book was filled with Seven Seals right and it was sealed with Seven Seals and and so there were things pertaining to the end time that would be sealed and would only be made known at the end time right so he said Daniel shut up the word seal the book even to win to the time of the end I think even a fool could see today we're at the time of the end and so he says many will run to and fro there will be all kinds of programs on the internet there will be all kinds of programs on on TV they'll tell you about the end times and and they'll they'll pretend to speak for God and many of them they have good ideas they have good things but we would have to have an authoritative word there's got to be an opening at the end time there's got to be a something we can rely on we got to have an absolute somewhere something we can we can put our hat on and say this is the truth God could just leave us without any ability to say this is true oh God we don't realize what this message did for us now look so now when the Mania run to and from knowledge will be increased and then but down in verse 9 the same chapter he said go that way Daniel for the words they're closed up and sealed till the time of the end these words pertaining to New Testament promises now we live in the end time we have seen the Fulfillment of this scripture of Daniel 12. how many believe that we have seen that he said how can you say that well because God interpreted his word by bringing it to pass look at Revelation chapter 10. Revelation chapter 10 and verse 1. what happens at the end time we know this is the end time because he cried time will be no longer there'll be no more delay so there comes a time when the Last Promise is unveiled hey man amen I will I will I will you see where I'm going now I will I will I will bring you out I will give you a future home I will bring you into a land I will I will I will and finally The Last Promise is unveiled oh look at what happens in Revelation 10-1 I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven close with the cloud a rainbow is upon his head his face was says it worth a son his feet is pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book sir the same book brother Branham tells us right that was that was what was sealed with Seven Seals but when this angel had that book it was open he had a little book open he had his hand a little book open he sent his right foot upon the sea his left foot on the earth we talked about that how that one Beast would come out of the sea one Beast would come out of the earth you remember and he'd put his right foot on Hollywood if we could say it that way but his left foot on on uh on denominational systems he he stood there and put his feet showing he had Authority oh my don't tell me you can't live this message this message was there's an authority come in our hour that an anointing that's coming our hour that allows us to live it lets us live it so he puts his right foot on the on the land he's left foot on the sheer vice versa however it was and and now when he stands down there his right foot on the feet his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice that's when a lion roarth when he'd cried seven Thunders uttered their voices when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me fill up those things which the seven Thunders uttered right them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him to liveth Forever and Ever who created heaven and the things that there in our and the earth and the things that they're in our and the Sea and the things which are there that there should be time no longer if you go look in the original list no more delay right time no longer oh I'm glad I live in that hour because what that means is ahead of myself now what it means is that the promises are available today I'm not waiting on him to tell me what he will do are you with me now I can have my healing because he's already told me that's been revealed to me I can have the salvation of my children because he already told me I can have a Rapture because he already told me it's already been revealed I'm not waiting on somebody else to come and reveal it to me oh do you realize what God did for us with the message of the hour he said you can you I will I will I will and he did it right Hallelujah now so we can we can take advantage of those promises today now look he said and they swear by him that liveth forever and ever time will be no longer now but verse 7 . this is familiar isn't it in the days of The Voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound so he's saying seal up these things seal them up don't tell nobody don't don't write it down but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound brother says when he starts on his ministry right he said it's real Menace he's not not at the beginning he said but when he starts on his ministry he said when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished yes yes so there's both an opening and closing and I'll show that to you in a moment the book is open but it's also complete or closed in the sense that in the sense that is complete yeah yeah Hallelujah no more promises to be written no more Mysteries that we need to know to get out of here right your life will adjusting what confidence that gives us as Believers in this message that whatever God wanted to tell me whatever he said he would do he said I will bring you out I will do this I will do that whatever he wanted to tell me he told me by the voice of the seventh angel Revelation 10 7 The Mystery of God would be finished that means I can't add to it somebody else can't add to it that means your favorite preacher won't add to it now there won't be another person to say well we're going to change it do it this way now whatever that Prophet said it's the promise that we have this message is not a drudgery it's not a bondage it's not a it's not some kind of do's and don'ts or a list of do's and don'ts but it's a reality of the Living Word of God living inside of us it's the very presence of God himself I'm not what I am I've told you this before I'm not what I am I don't do what I do in spite of the message I do what I do because of the message my family is safe because of the message our church is what it is because of the message yes sir nobody tell you that the message doesn't work no more or you need some man to come and add another promise you just need to see what's there you just need to turn on the lights yeah the brown said it was like a like a supermarket or we'd call it today like a Walmart he calls it an arcade but it's a place where you go in and you look in you you flip on the light and you look around her stuff all over the place everything in it's yours do we can't we really see that today up on this shelf is healing it's yours on this shelf is peace it's yours on this shelf is is an absence of strife in your home that's yours on this shelf is your children that's yours [Music] joy in the in the house of God that's yours whatever he said that's why we don't want to change it we don't want to make it different because what it means so much to us it's ours and so we just look around take it down we just take it down now and and we begin to manifest it now there's no more delay when the mystery of God is finished as it declared to a Servants of prophets there's now no more delay no more mystery everything that God said he would do now watch he has done in seed form no more seeds to be planted God help us today I'm talking about word seeds at the end time Martin Luther there had to be a certain thing it was cultivated and planted in his age a certain thing it was cultivated and planted in West these days in the Pentecostals at the end time but finally the last seeds came up there were Brides churches churches Brides brides right but there's got to come one he said well brother Ben where is it you're it yeah it's got to be us oh God help us today see everything that God said he would do is done so we're waiting on the maturity and that's why brother random said if you go back to what we've preached Wednesday night he said patience patience he said you preachers listen to me right have patience don't try to force something that God didn't say you see why it's so important why did I why do I come preach even about the gifts and things why what will the writers to do because we want to make sure that we stay with the message of the hour because that's our that's our food that's what was stored up for that's what we live on that's what makes us alive that's what makes it anytime we begin even if it looks like we need to do it yeah we don't want to get off what a prophet said because when we get away from what a prophet said what we're doing is we're actually cutting ourselves off from the life the life is in the word that's good amen but now watch in the days of the voice all these things will be finished so now now it's complete now there's uh I hope I can get this across you this morning now there's a bride on the Earth brother random called it an infant bride yes yes which will manifest Every Word of Promise of the New Testament yeah as a mature bride yeah yeah right so now brother Brown's thinking about that promise of the New Testament I may not have time to get to all this this morning but he said it's just the New Testament that's all he said he fulfilled the Old Testament now it's the New Testament another piece to be fulfilled he said see the new and oldest husband and wife I like that the groom fulfilled the old and the bride will fulfill the new yes watch it taken the old to foreshow the new Christ come the Masterpiece to fulfill that now his bride someone say his bride now his bride will fulfill everything that's in the New Testament amen hallelujah another Masterpiece is in making yeah but you know why people can't see it's a masterpiece because it's the chip off think about this for a minute what did Brother random teach us about the bride he said Michelangelo built a masterpiece and he was so inspired by that he hit it with a hammer right he chipped off a piece of it and the bride is that ship that's what he taught us so the bride can we say it this way is seen as the flaw s oh my but brother rather said that's what makes it a masterpiece he was wounded he said no man that's why he was bruised for our iniquity well it's seen as weakness in Christ is actually the very thing that makes us strong don't you see it you can't see well I could never be the bride I could never come up to what you're preaching I could never do those things but can you can't you see that the very fact that you are weak God needed something that was weak that's why he created man to begin with he needed something that was weak so he could put he had that flaw had to be there it's what made the Masterpiece but he said Michelangelo couldn't pick up that piece and make it part of the whole again but Christ picked up the piece and put it back in its place served I'm gonna have to calm down a little bit get through this foreign I started to say I'm getting too old and I looked over there by the bill no I'm not getting too fat that's what it is you're a masterpiece not when I watch but how do you know you might ask that question how do I know that I'm his bride how do I know I people tell me oh you're the bride well how do I know brother Brandon says this he said you are known when Jesus Christ lives in you by his life and the promised word of this day reflects itself yes sir I love that he said now the same word that was reflected in Moses could not be reflected in Elijah because that was another day the same one that was reflected Noah could not be in Moses because say Noah built an ark Moses say to people that's exactly what was promised the same light was reflected in one wasn't in the other but one told of the other one all the New Testament speaks of this hour do we believe that today Jesus Christ speaks of this hour he said who is it then some man oh God who is it some man it's Jesus Christ the son of God manifesting reflecting the light on the word that he promised for this day he said when man see you living like him when he sees your character and your conduct with the word just exactly like he was the word being manifested then man will see Jesus Christ they won't have to look around anywhere else and say what does this Creed teach what does that Creed teach they'll know what God is when they see you why you've been brought back you've been brought back to the Masterpiece the the flaw has been restored see God didn't call us to leave us out in the world and leave us in sin we were there one day all of us were he said such were some of you but God did not call us to leave us there he called some from the very lowest of the low but he didn't call you to leave you there he called you to bring you out and restore you back to the masterpiece they'll know what God is when they see you so you manifest you and I manifest the fullness of the book Hallelujah do you see why the seals were so important in the message because it's the opening of those seals of the word that tells us who we are and it doesn't tell us by saying Stuart Duckworth is a preacher at the end time the seals don't say that but what they do is identify brother Stewart's character in the word yeah what a bride would be doing and our name is there and so when we look at that we see what God's done in our life we begin to see Mama that's me so the message of the Seven Seals now watch brother Bible says something interesting he's here he says in their closing I referenced it a minute ago in their closing so the book was open but in a sense it was closed because the message was finished does that make sense the book is open but we're not writing new chapters that makes sense no he said the seventh seals closes the New Testament oh my God sealed it up don't you see what that means somebody can't bring to you something outside of the New Testament if there was a New Testament Church that's the way this church has to be yes because if it's something outside of the New Testament it's not what it's not what a prophet said it's not what the Bible says right it would have to be wrong because the book has been sealed and closed up the Revelation is complete now your Revelation may not be complete you're not pure I'm not to my full level of maturity yet you're not fearful level of maturity yet but you you gain Revelation but it's Revelation that's already in the book are you with me now so the Mysteries was in the Seven Seals he says I hope I'm not boring you this morning he said when these Seven Seals was open that opened up the entire Bible the Seven Seals it was still with seven mysteries in those Seven Seals held the entire mystery of it and it was the book of redemption New Testament I watch these are not the old it only proclaimed for the New Testament he said they cannot be made perfect without us so now having the Old Testament revealed in Christ the New Testament revealed by the message of the hour which you're going to find out in a minute what what that is right that's in flesh right God didn't just send us a message how to put this and make it clear God didn't just sent us a message of voice he sent us a man that makes sense he didn't just send us a voice he sent a man William Branham there's a reason why he sent a man because God was going to manifest in that man and show the sign of the son of man Jehovah was going to live in that man yeah yeah and I'm not but the thing is we don't want to limit it to that we want to say all the brothers said about that because he told us it wouldn't be just limited to that now we won't show the sign of the son of man because him being a part of the Bride that's already been shown right we don't have to show that against once to a generation what are we shall we we fulfill our part of the body whatever our part of the body is we fulfill that in our hour right he already fulfilled his part we're fulfilling our part but he did not call just a voice he called a man and the man that God called manifested it wasn't he didn't just tell us but he actually lived it you see why he we see why his whole life and things that the things that he did it was so mysterious to people because God was allowing a man to come to that maturity somebody had to come to that maturity he was allowing a man to come to that maturity where he could speak to the storm yeah he could speak to uh he could speak to the to the cancer yeah but then he he gave us a clue of what's coming because what does he do he goes in to have he writes house and had he writes speaks because she here oh my she hears the word and he's telling her what was manifested in his life and she said it's nothing but the truth right you see what I'm saying so we don't just spend all our time glorifying that man but what do we do God make me fulfill my part right now the Mysteries within the Seven Seals when the Seven Seals often opened up the entire Bible it was the book of redemption New Testament they could not be made perfect without us so what that means is we are now subject to every promise someone say every promise of the word now he said God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark this is a living thing not some dead cold formal Creed but a living God his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive Hallelujah and subject to every promise in the world then what does that do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you you're manifesting but see we miss it because what does God do whatever the man preach before the opening of the seals God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same you realize that by doing what you do and when I come out I just had my mind on this message but I meant to say something about kids days yesterday and how much we appreciated what was done there and we appreciate the Sunday School teachers for doing that sister Rebecca and sister Sophie and all the helpers because what you're doing you don't realize what you're doing you're fulfilling a part yeah [Music] you realize you are the revelation of the word made flesh for those kids god with skin on it and by fulfilling your part in doing what God in Godly order in a church that God has set up a way for us to have church and I'm glad that he did I'm glad he didn't leave it to my idea your idea he said a place for us to have church a way for us to do these things and and so when he set that up then we have it uh here all we have to do is fill our part the play's already been written yeah I don't have to go rewrite it I don't have to go but I'm an actor in the play Oh My and I'm stepping into my part and if that part's taking care of the young people taking care of the children let me do that with all of my heart so we're thankful we're thankful for deacons and trustees and people because you don't realize what you're doing yeah I'm thankful for people like brother Harold I'll pick on him that just come and sit in the service but I I Harold I see him on the screen because of where he sits don't move brother Harold but I see that white head sitting back there and every time I'm blessed because I I know my own weaknesses I'm aware that I'm a man I'm aware that we these things we have are so precious because they could all fall apart in a minute but Danny we realize that people could get hurt but when I see a faithful person a faithful member of the body of Christ may not do anything else but just sit in the presence of God but when they come to the house of God on Wednesday night and Sunday morning and Sunday night and Wednesday night and Sunday morning and Sunday night and I see them there but her that inspires me it says be faithful in your part but the Herald's doing his part you go do your part are you with me now they've done their part oh God let me do my part some of you have filled your part you've been manifesting the word for 40 50 years let me do my part today there's a part for me let me fulfill it let me be an encouragement to somebody else eternal life is living for others how could we ever do away with the body of God's people when all of eternal life is living for others and that's what we do here that's why we have church you don't this church does not and should not exist to support my lifestyle should not exist solely to have a place for people to be deacons or a place for people to be trustees or a place for people to be song leaders it does not exist for our egos it does not exist to Pat us on the back but this church exists because the Bride of Jesus Christ are worthy of being of having a preacher they're worthy of feeling the presence of God they're worthy brother said if I had a drop of blood and a charger he said he wouldn't mean as much as the body of Christ he said because you're the purchase of that blood [Music] we don't come here together to to build each other as egos up we come here together because we're the body of Jesus Christ and somebody's got to preach somebody's got to think somebody's got to work that's right so we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ seated together manifest the entire body of Christ there's no leaven among you that's the age we're living in there was always leaven there was listen there was always leaven until the time to go home but in this hour the the shuck is being separated from the wheat there's always leaven until the end time and at the end time a prophet of God declared there's no leaven among you right just the word only seated in Heavenly places in the door where he puts his name Christ Jesus then you might ask me brother Ben if I'm subject to all of God's promises for today why do I struggle for my healing why is it difficult to go to church somebody said amen why do I struggle with besetting sin somebody said oh me brother Ben you know we're message Believers we don't we do why do we struggle with thoughts sometimes we can't control why do we struggle with the settings and why do we struggle with disobedience sometimes a disobedient nature why do I have trouble in my home with the benefit if this is how if this is who I am or what I'm subject to why do I have trouble the children of Israel might have thought the same thing and it they got they dwelled on it so much that they could not hearken to what Moses was saying yeah when he began to preach and then promises they couldn't see it they just couldn't grab a hold of it the gap between what they were hearing and what they were seeing caused them to be disillusioned you ever heard that word disillusioned I thought of that when I thought of these people in in Exodus 6 they were disillusioned with the prophet and the message to be disillusioned needs to be disappointed in someone or something that one discovers to be less good than one had believed now he's not any less good right than what we believed but it looks like it yeah so we're disillusioned because maybe we had in our minds an illusion to begin with to be disillusioned means to have the illusion taken away and maybe we had an illusion in our mind to begin with that everything would be easy and and because we're in the message that everything would work just like it's supposed to and that's not what happens at all right everything sometimes falls apart sometimes everything falls apart though both those statements are true everything we're human beings we live in a condition even though in one sense we've come into the promised land we're living in the land where all the promises lay in another sense we're still in the bondage of Flesh so both of those types can hold true and so now the the the dictionary Again State said disillusionment is having lost faith or trust in something formally regarded as good or valuable why people don't go to church anymore you want to know the real reason they lost trust in its value and when when a prophet of God very clearly tells you to do something and you don't do it anymore what is why you've lost some amount of trust in the prophet of God right listen to me church just because you say you believe the message doesn't mean you live it yeah there was a gap here was Moses right in front of him God veiled himself in Moses stood in front of them walked in front of them and they said they said we don't we can't Moses we we believe you're a prophet but we just can't grab a hold of these promises because of these situations right so someone I said well my job keeps me from it my my my uh my marriage my relationship is my you don't understand I'm I'm sick in my body but don't you realize that that promise is for your healing yeah don't you realize that promises for your finances don't you don't mind it's all included this is not the hour of a partial fulfillment this is not the hour of a partial problem but every promise in the book is is wrapped up in the bride every promise of God so you in other words like this becoming disillusioned people become disillusioned with the message even though they would fight you over you if you said you did not you don't believe the message anymore but what do they do they lost the value of what he was saying yeah yeah what he was telling them lost faith or trust people lose Faith or trust in Preachers yeah yeah and so it just becomes white noise and I know I realize that only so much of what I say gets through the veil because everything has to pass through my veil in your Veil flesh right so only so much gets out because it's my veil and I don't always do things right all right so you look at you look at me and say brother Ben especially if you've known me a long time but then I I saw you one time and you you were you you know you you snapped at your children you snapped at your wife you did something that see that's a veil of Flesh they don't make it right it's wrong I have to repent of those things just like you do but you see what happens because of that Veil that word that I preach has to pass through that yeah yeah and it has to pass through your Veil and so I realized that only so much gets through and that's why we just keep repeating it keep repeating it keep repeating we keep coming back you keep hearing I'm the bride I'm the bride I'm the bride wow it passes through my veil it passes through your Veil but that's the way God intended for it to happen and eventually one day you find yourself when you tell yourself over and over it's a it's a it's a faith it's up here as we talked about a couple weeks ago this and talking with some of the brothers there's an intellectual Faith it's got to be an intellectual Faith before it be can become a subconscious faith and so you you say I believe it I believe it I believe it but one day it drops in It Gets behind the veil brother said if we could if we could only press through the veil of the flesh he said we would see Angels at their positions at every pew why because and the promise is not the Angels would would come in a certain building the promises that the Angels would have Camp around those that feared the Lord he said we see Angels at every pew the message isn't what I thought it was some might say going to church hasn't helped me like I thought it would living as a Christian is much harder than I thought it would be some of you young people are going to have to face that one day because right now if you don't have the Holy Ghost mom and dad is going to be it right they're they're going but you listen to your kids listen to me for a minute they're coming you got to decide there's coming today that you've got to you've got to believe the message for yourself you've got to understand even our children understand way more than we think they do but you got I believe that the book is open I believe that that a prophet of God came I believe that the message of the hour is true I believe listen I was I was the age of Landon when I first started I was preaching at your age well anybody but I was I don't say it to intimidate you I didn't know what I was talking about but I was his age when I begin to dig into the message for myself and I got a hold of a church age book because we didn't have computers back then Peter when he was young one time I started wearing glasses and uh he was talking to me you know he was riding home from church one day and he said yeah he said he said I guess could you didn't wear glasses before because I started wearing glasses when I was 30. he said I guess you or somewhere at 27 or 30 something like that he said I guess you didn't wear glasses before because they didn't have them when you were young they had glasses but what we didn't have was the message on the computer y'all remember or if they did it was that one person that could afford that high-priced computer to download all that stuff because it had to be the Gateway 2000 or whatever that it was and it cost like six thousand dollars you had to download all the folio views and everything you had to know how to use dos and all those I remember when I first started preaching out and I went to a church and they had that and I sat there just printing quotes man I could look them up and print them I was so happy look them up and pretty had to type a command to print the quotes and that's what we had to do but what was it I was that age when I began to just because you're young it doesn't mean that you can't hear that you can't feed that you can't Know Who You Are amen you can know who you are you may not have all the ins and outs figured out but you can know I'm a Believer son I'm of God do you believe that today you can know that God has been merciful to my family he's loved us he's kept us he's brought us out I want to serve him with all of my heart so he can fulfill himself even in a child you can manifest the word for your day yeah now see I want us to think about this for a minute we get disillusioned because people are human don't we isn't that mainly the reason why people don't believe in Preachers right that's right well preachers make mistakes they're human yes sir that's right but they don't make the message any less right Randall said of a Catholic priest preached the word he said I'd say Amen to it all right yeah look why wasn't God disillusioned when Adam fell have you ever thought about that and God that's sitting in heaven if we could say it that way God's sitting up there with Jason he's sitting up there and he goes he uh looks down there he says oh oh you wouldn't believe what Adam and Eve have done oh my they they made such a mess of things made such a mess of things they're just they're just uh oh my oh they've disobeyed the word I'm so disappointed oh I I'm so disappointed you know he was disappointed he was saddened he was even angered if we could put it in human emotions but he already knew it was going to happen so he was not disillusioned because God understood something that we don't understand see when you're disillusioned you quit because you're disillusioned the church let me down so I'll quit Wednesday nights on what they thought I'd be so I'll quit going on Wednesday nights it'll be better if you were there that part's free church is what I thought it would be so I'll just I just pull back I thought that reading the Bible every day would just would make everything right and I find myself falling asleep trying to read so I'll just quit I'm disillusioned see but that's that's not what God did right oh my when Adam messed up when he messed up what did God do he already had a way provided for them to come back so he was not disillusioned Hallelujah listen God wasn't disillusioned with you when you fell when something happened in your life when you made mistakes when you were a sinner he was not disillusioned he knew who you were before he ever made you he knew what you would do but he loved you anyway aren't you grateful for that today he was not disillusioned by my stubbornness by my stupidity but he loved me anyway you already knew that I was human there's the key he made us human see why people get disillusioned with the message they get disillusion with preachers they don't understand the human element he made he made us weak on purpose in fact his attributes could not be fulfilled in Adam and Eve unless they were flesh could fall see the Bible says in Psalms 103 8 the Lord is merciful and gracious are you still with me this morning just a few more minutes the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger I'm so glad that he is plenteous in Mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins I can't read that without some emotion coming up in my heart and my voice I can't read that because I know that if he dealt with me after my sins I wouldn't be here brother Paul I could not live if he dealt with me after my sin he's not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear Him as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pityth his children so the Lord pityth them that fear Him for he knoweth our frame he remembers that we are dust and do us some good to remember that the preacher is human the deacons are human the people are human the prophet was a human the reason the Jews could not see God's promise being fulfilled in Christ they could not see past the Dust you know what our job in life is basically if you want to look at it one way is to minimize the cloud of dust around us I'm going to make an obscure pop culture reference just warning you remember Big Ben how many members the the character pig pen on peanuts some of you are brave enough to raise your hands nothing wrong with peanuts the character pigpen remember I think that was his name pigpen he wandered around everywhere he went through was just a cloud of dust and Charlie Brown tells him he said you're the only person I know that could take a bath and come out dirtier than you were he just said just a cloud of dust around him you realize what we do is we got a sticky nature we got a cloud of dust my job as a preacher to try to let the Holy Spirit of the reign of the Holy Ghost settle that dust as much as possible so that you can see Christ Living in me our job as Christians is to let the rain the water the spirit flow over us the washing of the water of the word flew over us too to settle the Dust but he said he remembers that we're dust I'm so glad for the Joe that he does he knows our frame amen John 6 41 says the Jews murmured at him because he said I'm the bread which came down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know we know his dust how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven he could not see it because he became a son of man we find out here that God has always he said had skin on him when Moses seen him he had skin on him look like a man God was behind the curtains he had skin on him and God tonight in his church is failed in his church with skin on it still the same God tonight but now as ever the skin fails what catches the Traditions they just can't believe that is god making them people act like that it's because God has failed in his church in skin skin on it that's right he is hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer why could they not see the message of the hour because God sent it in a man he sent it through a man ifested through a man why can they not believe the move is on for the bride because it's through men and women huh when their tradition veiled traditions of the elders and the word is broke through of course they then comes in plain view we see him deity again failed in human flesh you say well that's easy for me to see and brother Branham but brother Branham was dust too he was just too just like we're dust man was born of a woman in a few days and full of trouble he was dust but yet he so subjected himself to the spirit of God that he become more than just a prophet or something like that but he become the first amen something that could be waived over the people Christ the word was waived in him but the Branham himself is not the wave sheep but it's Christ in the bread in that flesh can we see that can we separate it it's hard he was not a God but he was God in flesh you are not God but your God in flesh and he had a certain work he had to do and you have a certain work you have to do he said Hebrews 1 said so also Genesis 18 you remember God was a man sitting there eating talking with Abraham told what Sarah was doing and sent behind it and Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh he said now remember Jesus didn't say when the Son of God is being revealed because they might have recognized it as the son of God but they could oh my they could not recognize him as the son of man now watch he said when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings not Son of God but to son of man again back in his church again in the last days we find out that he promised that in God's promises that's the promise for today I hope you hear me now the son of man fulfilled or manifested the sign of the son of man manifested by a prophet that's already been done right that don't have to happen that's already happened we're living in a late hour we're living in the time after the one came to Abraham and told him this is Sarah your wife's in the tent behind you your name won't be Sarah Sarah he'll be Sarah and she's in the tempting how did she laughed but you know in a year you're going to have a promise a promised son we're living in the time we're waiting on the on the Fulfillment of it of the Rapture the fullness of the rapture but now watch there's no way I can get through this I've gotta I've got to stop I'm gonna find a place now look brother brother we believe we're living in the hour that when God is doing something how many believe that today he said we believe we're living among them now I believe tonight I'm preaching to that congregation that's laying waiting out there just to get right I really believe that with all my heart I would say it's the same now as it's always been he said now we believe that the Hours come that Saint John 14 12 must be fulfilled we believe that Malachi 4 must be fulfilled we believe that Luke 17 30 must be fulfilled we believe that all these prophecies he said would come to pass this day we believe they must be fulfilled and we believe we're seeing them fulfilled right now brother Brandon you go look it up let's if you go we talk about Revelation 10 Mighty Angel you said when will that be fulfilled well the Brandon said was already fulfilled go look it up in uh in what is the attraction on the mountain he said three years ago is prophecy now it's history yes yes what is the attraction on the mountain God fulfilling his word oh my sir now look what is God's promise for today to as is for a bride to fulfill the New Testament Promises of God yeah so there's to be a spiritual bride raised up there'll be the Royal seat of the royal faith and Abraham's royal son she has to come on the scene in the last days and the time and the place is a promise that's given to her but see the devil doesn't believe that you are her right well you know but he didn't believe that he was him and he does not believe that you were her so the devil gets us disillusioned by pointing to human weakness many times he doesn't attack the word directly but he attacks the body of the word which is the church the bride right how many people have I seen leave the message I've told you this before but they end up leaving the message forsaking a prophet forsaking the message altogether but it started because they got a root of bitterness against a member of the body yeah yeah and they end almost every case they have a root of bitterness against some preacher or something that happened or the way the people treated them and they end up leaving the message all together you said that could never happen to me you better get that root of bitterness out of your heart [Music] right so-and-so didn't treat me right so-and-so didn't forgive me when they should have forgave me so I'm so messed up and they shouldn't have messed up well that's the truth but you better get rid of that because Satan's trying to use that to get you disillusioned with the body and if he can get you disillusioned with the body eventually you'll get you disillusioned with the word itself even tries to point to our own flesh give us disillusioned with ourselves but the brown said he knew the word was for that hour but he doubted this humble little man being that word Matthew 4 and 1 Jesus was led up to the spirit of the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward 100 hungered and when and when I don't know how to say that hungered or hungered and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread now he knew he was the son of man a son of man but he said if you're the son of God right he had a hard time seeing he was the son of God because he was the son of man God hid himself in the womb of a virgin Oh Glory and Satan couldn't see if that for sure if that was him or not so he might come to you and he might tell you the same thing well if you were really the Bride of Jesus Christ why do you struggle financially oh he's never talked to you like that huh if you were really the bride why'd you lose that job if you're really the bride why'd you lose your car if you really the bride why'd your house get foreclosed on well praise God he said well God and he'll point you to scripture it points you the message says you're supposed to be blessed but you live in a body of Flesh you make mistakes so do I yeah yeah but Jesus answered him correctly Jesus didn't make any mistakes but still the flesh kept Satan from seeing who he was but Jesus knew who he was so he doesn't answer through the flesh but he answers by the word he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that precedes out of the mouth of God the next time the devil tries to tell you you're a sorry no count you can't even keep a job you can't do this out of the other you just look back at the Devil and tell him man shall not live by bread alone he said if you were the Son of God why would you be hungry if you were the Son of God why do you struggle don't you see he's doing the same thing today because he can't see the veil of flesh but look back at him and say I believe the word regardless man won't live by bread alone I'm going to keep going to church I'm going to keep living for God I'm gonna keep doing what's right even if it's a struggle I'm gonna do it because man will not live by bread alone you never said it would be easy you took him to Pinnacle of the temple I just kind of heard through this so we can get done took him the Pinnacle of the temple said if you I'll be the Son of God cast myself down in other words if you're the word made flesh why do you struggle why are you tempted Jesus was tempted in all like points like we are yet without sin why didn't he just keep you from mistakes so he says if you're the word quit trying to live it quit trying to go to church just let yourself fall from the Pinnacle of the Temple because if you're really the word you'll survive realize that's a devil talking to you if you're really the bride you can do without the church you don't have to come to church you don't have to do what a prophet said you can do without you can do without those things you you can wear those pants you can if you're really the bride he'll catch you see what Satan was doing yeah he was trying to tempt him he said be any of you scripture he'll give his angels charge concerning thee why why don't you know you're predestined he won't let you fall but Jesus said it is written again thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God he tries to tell you to quit church he tries to tell you to quit on quit on him quit on the message you just say thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God website thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God because God's inside of me I can speak the word too stay well there's nothing for you to do just let yourself fall there is a part for you to play because brother Brown says he knows if the people gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army she will have to fight but she cannot be overcome or you listening to me today no man can stand before even the promise of the Rapture is already something that's in her Hallelujah the shout is the message and you become the message what does that make you makes you a part of the rapture brother Brandon said here you are tonight after 1900 years he's speaking of Christ he's praying he said you're just as much alive tonight as you was when you talk to the woman at the well it's God manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband of the same self-flash these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word in the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last time God identifying himself the word are you hearing me this morning the word in the church so the Rapture begins in your flesh I'm afraid I'll miss it you can't miss it if you're already on the ride never stood in line for a roller coaster and I want to raise your hand then they start putting in people thank you miles they put them people up in front of you and you know the fast pass people they bring you up in front of you they just get to go and you're like I'm gonna miss this because this thing shuts down every 15 minutes you know or there's a thunderstorm coming and they're going to shut it down for lightning you know I'm gonna miss it I'm still in line see if you're still in line you could miss it but once you get on yeah and that thing starts to roll you're moving now going back then on a ride one time a girl decided she didn't like it she just got off it got offside they'd shut the whole thing down but my boat went through it was already in the water oh Church you just realized if you're a part of the bride of Christ you're already in the water you're already on your way you're already on the track the devil can't stop you if he wants to God's promise for today behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling but not the last Trump the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised Incorruptible we shall be changed God's promise for today Romans 8 11 it's the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead blood these are new testament promises it's the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead wasn't you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you Brother Bear talks about all these things Divine Healing the power of God all these other things is in every individual in here let's proceed The Bachelor of the Holy Ghost you're planted in Christ the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir everything you have neither for this life's journey even the Rapture is right in you then he said don't resent that that's the truth the Rapture is in us now how improve it by the gospel those who he called he justified those who he justified he's glorified those in heaven today were glorified in the presence of God right now and today we're glorifying the presence of God right now I'm just pushing out to it he said all you have to do is drink like a tree and you just you just push out the fruit push out the leaves but you just have to drink you're planted by a river of water drink amen don't be dissolution but your musicians go ahead and come don't be disillusioned by your own weakness I'm typing these things this week this is about the fourth version of it I went through it's been about 10 hours back in this office on Friday something like that just frustrated because I was down on myself it must have been does that happen to you because I'm human I got down on myself and I'm sitting in the office that's why God calls me in because it gives us something don't you love what brother Brandon would tell people be honest with the people and tell them this is what I went through yeah yeah I'm just being honest with you this is one of the hardest weeks of my life and there was no reason for it just just my old mind this won't leave me alone y'all experience times like that yeah I got done with Wednesday night preaching I preach hard sometimes when you preach hard you get under a different anointing and it's just like you you come out of that and you get in the moly grubs just no other way but the ram calls it on Monday he said you want to kick the cat and and we don't kick the cat but you want to and that's just not good that way Friday but I'm typing these things just while I'm being disillusioned by my own weakness if I was a real man of God I'd do better than this but I read this this is one of God's New Testament promises for today if you're struggling today I want you to hear this he said unto me because Paul struggled he didn't understand he said I got this Thorn In the Flesh and three times I've asked you to take it away from me he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee he said brother Ben did that just wake you up and set you on fire right away no I need to go home and sleep first I needed to go through another day but then eventually it hits you or you were this is your promise I I may go through a valley but I'm coming out on the mountain I may have some hard times but I've already been strapped in I'm already in the ride I'm going home people may doubt me preachers May doubt me the church might doubt me you can say the same thing today people might doubt that you can do what God called you to do but he said my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect and weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities he said if I'm going to brag about something I'm going to brag about that time that I got beaten until I was almost dead that's what Paul says if I'm going to brag about something I'm gonna brag about the times I got thrown in prison if I'm gonna brag about something see they couldn't see Brother David what was going on behind the scenes while he was in a prison house the people said his ministry is washed up he don't even have two coats he had to send for his other coach all his friends forsook him they didn't understand that the New Testament promises that we live by today we're being written while he was in prison and they could not see it because of the weakness of the flesh but he said my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me I'll say this this morning if the New Testament promises were written in weakness and yet they were the promises of God that are the absolute that we rest our soul on revealed in this hour by a Prophet by the opening of the word if they could be written in weakness if they could be revealed by a prophet who was a man in weakness couldn't they be manifested the same way and you think nothing's going on nothing's happening and all the time the Rapture all the Clockwork everything's moving just the way it should be what did we say Wednesday night I read that to you three nights in a row right before brother Branham died he told the people he said everything nothing is out of cater he uses those words three times in a row the Rapture things that are to be modern events made clear about prophecy I believe it's the other one three times in a row there's nothing out of cater he was about to get killed in a car wreck but there's nothing out of cater right the promises keep moving keeps going it's too big to fail yeah yeah Hallelujah but they manifest themselves in such a strong way in weakness we can't see it would you bow your heads with me don't don't get disillusioned because of your weaknesses look at God's promises for today you know why people can't serve God it's not because of what they've done I want you to hear me Church because of a lack of faith in the promises of God if you struggle you think I I do good for a while now backsliding I just can't serve you like I want you God remember it's not you say well I'll do this I'll do that it's not of Works lest any man should boast it's the gift of God you really want to come where you want to be where you need to be in God you really want to come where you need to be believe the promises look away from the bondage look away from the anguish Spirit look away from the things of the world and say Lord I believe help thou my unbelief I believe anybody that ever got anything from Jesus looked past the veil of Flesh that I believe help thou my unbelief could we do that today whatever you're struggling with I don't know what it is but whatever's on your heart today whatever you whatever you go through whoever you're is moving in your life we got communion tonight you said brother bin I don't want to take communion with this this thing in my heart like it is why don't you just repent and let go of it let it go let let God begin to work in your life it only takes a moment you don't have to hoops and and then do a bunch of illegalistic things you just have to serve God believe believe that's all he asks of you to do he don't ask you to do it yourself believe it leave it and walk forward in the promise and when you really believe it you begin to manifest it because his Spirit dwells inside of you Hallelujah Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray for the people here today Lord I pray Lord for myself my own life Lord as I'm fighting these same devils let the people fight I I go out every day and fight the same doubts and fears and frustrations but Lord I got a sword you gave me an open book oh God I'm so grateful for it you revealed the mysteries in my day so that all of the promises of God could be fulfilled in my flesh all of my part of the promise of God for my hour will be fulfilled in me I believe that Lord I trust you today Lord I trust you I give it all to you oh God lord I wait upon you today I want to be patient help me not to invent some new idea or to come up with something that'll speed it along Let Me Wait Lord in the presence of this of the word and of the son of man oh God revealing himself in my hour Let Me Wait let me let me be patient let me not get caught up in what's going on in politics I mean I'll get caught up with what's going on even in my own family Harding in other families God Even in our church Lord we don't want to get so caught up and what's going on that we can't see the promises of God I pray you granted Lord help us help these young people God his children Lord especially I think of him I heard if they they played and laughed and had fun together and that's part of what we do it's part of what we do is help our children we want to let them know that we love them we care about them the Lord most of all today help them to know that you love them that you care for them bigger little small or bigger or in between you care for your children and I'm so thankful for that Lord for the outcasts for the for the one that feels like nobody loves them nobody cares you care and I'm so grateful for that today Lord we love you help them to know it Lord help them to feel it or may there be such an atmosphere or among us that they could feel the care Lord that you manifest toward them and you you manifest that through other members of the body we're so grateful for that today Lord thank you for them Lord I pray for each one Lord help us not to be disillusioned in the message of the hour let us keep our vision of what you've done for us the Lord in knowing that we are human or not to be discouraged because we are human but knowing that we are
