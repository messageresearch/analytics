[36:02] or to change our nature to change what
[36:05] we were and to transform us into sons
[36:08] and daughters of god
[36:09] we would not be conformed to this world
[36:11] but that we would be transformed by the

[36:17] lord just continue to renew our mind by
[36:19] your word we thank you for it well lord
[36:22] i pray that we would accept it there
[36:24] would be no spirit of rebellion or
[36:26] spirit of fear or or something that
[36:28] would keep us from
[36:30] wholly embracing your word but lord that
[36:32] we would believe that it is you lord
[36:34] that is speaking to us tonight we ask
[36:36] and we pray lord if there's one that's
[36:39] sick among us i pray you'd heal them
[36:41] lord give us everything that we have
[36:42] need of and we'll give you the praise
[36:44] and the glory and the honor we pray in
[36:47] jesus name
[36:49] amen
[36:50] amen
[36:52] i sure appreciate that song i am
[36:54] redeemed to tell them
[36:56] i am redeemed amen
[36:59] we're going to read from genesis chapter
[37:00] 49 verse 27
[37:03] and then deuteronomy chapter 33 verse
[37:06] 12. this will be our final installment
[37:10] of the
[37:12] series on
[37:14] the family curse breaking the family
[37:17] curse
[37:18] on the tribe of benjamin
[37:21] i trust that you've gotten something out
[37:23] of this
[37:24] but we're going to review these
[37:25] scriptures genesis 49 12 27
[37:28] deuteronomy 33 and 12.
[37:31] and then also we'll read romans 11 and
[37:34] 1. that's a new scripture romans 11 and
[37:37] 1 genesis 49 27 deuteronomy 33 12 and
[37:40] romans 11 and 1 i'll give you a minute
[37:42] to get there
[37:51] i was trying to
[37:54] preach without my monitor tonight so
[37:57] my voice cutting out a little bit i'm
[37:58] trying to get used to it i got to go
[38:00] overseas and do without that stuff and
[38:02] uh we're going to egypt and we just got
[38:05] the books printed by the joel i forgot
[38:06] to show you the picture
[38:08] we got the books printed over there and
[38:10] and so thank god for that the word is
[38:13] powerful it's sharper than a two-edged
[38:15] sword i believe the word of the hour is
[38:17] is powerful it it'll do something and if
[38:21] we can just get it in the language of
[38:22] the people and then uh let the word come
[38:25] to them and then also
[38:27] as we said sunday with the with the
[38:29] fivefold ministry and how god uses that
[38:31] to
[38:32] uh to
[38:33] expose the word to the people to bring
[38:36] it to them and
[38:37] how will we hear without a preacher and
[38:39] so that's what we want to do tonight we
[38:41] believe that god wants to
[38:43] open the word to us but to do that we
[38:45] have to be receptive to the word it
[38:48] doesn't do us any good to sit here or to
[38:50] stand here tonight unless we're
[38:52] receptive to what we're reading so when
[38:53] we read
[38:54] we're reading now the word of god
[38:56] genesis 49 and 27 it said benjamin shall
[39:00] raven as a wolf
[39:01] in the morning he shall devour the prey
[39:04] and at night he shall divide the spoil
[39:06] so this was the birth path that benjamin
[39:09] was born under
[39:10] this was what they were destined if you
[39:12] could say it that way
[39:14] to do and to be
[39:15] and then in deuteronomy 33 12 we see
[39:18] another birth path for benjamin
[39:20] benjamin he said the beloved of the lord
[39:22] shall dwell in safety by him the lord
[39:26] shall cover him all the day long
[39:28] and he shall dwell between
[39:30] his shoulders
[39:32] then i like romans 11 1
[39:34] where paul is coming back and he's
[39:36] explained how that
[39:38] the true circumcision is by faith and
[39:42] that's how we're circumcised from the
[39:44] flesh is by faith
[39:46] and but he comes back in romans 11 he
[39:47] said i say then hath god cast away his
[39:51] people he said god forbid
[39:54] for i also am an israelite
[39:56] of the seed of abraham
[39:59] of the tribe of benjamin he said god
[40:02] saved me
[40:04] god changed me if he can change me
[40:07] he can he can bring deuteronomy 33 12
[40:11] out of what was genesis 49 27. amen
[40:15] that's the story of our life isn't it
[40:17] amen god bless you you could be seated
[40:28] pray for that at the end of the service
[40:29] a prayer request
[40:33] you know there was something in the
[40:35] tribe of benjamin as we've talked about
[40:37] it that god could use
[40:39] but if left unchecked it would become
[40:42] destructive and i think that's true
[40:45] of any of us there's something about
[40:46] your nature
[40:48] that god can use
[40:50] but he don't want to leave you like you
[40:52] are because every one of us came to the
[40:54] earth born in sin shapen in iniquity
[40:58] and so god can't use us just like we are
[41:01] there has to be a
[41:03] a transformation that takes place
[41:06] whether we like it or not though god
[41:08] makes us who we are for a purpose
[41:11] he made us and brother billy made you
[41:13] and he made sister karen he made me
[41:15] he made each one of us the way that we
[41:17] are
[41:18] and there's value in that i don't want
[41:20] to uh you to think that well god just
[41:23] has to change my personality he's got to
[41:25] change everything about me but what he
[41:27] actually does is he makes us a new
[41:29] creature but that new creature is not a
[41:32] complete destruction of the old and
[41:35] you'll find that taught if you go back
[41:36] and listen to the sermon a future home
[41:38] of the heavenly bridegroom and the and
[41:40] the earthly bride you'll find that
[41:42] brother branham teaches us that the
[41:44] earth was an attribute of god how many
[41:46] know that tonight the earth is an
[41:48] attribute of god and so if the earth is
[41:50] an attribute of god he said you're a
[41:52] part of the earth your your body is made
[41:55] up of the dust of the earth and so you
[41:57] therefore are an attribute of god more
[41:59] than just the
[42:00] there's a seed of god within you
[42:02] spiritually
[42:03] but you're an attribute of god and so
[42:05] god doesn't destroy his attributes but
[42:08] what does he do he comes and he remakes
[42:10] it he he burns up the atmospheres of it
[42:13] what did god do to you and for you
[42:16] brother jt when he saved you he didn't
[42:18] just
[42:19] do away with jt he didn't take away the
[42:21] way you necessarily the way you said
[42:23] words and he didn't turn you into a tall
[42:26] dark and handsome individual but what
[42:28] did he do to jt he took the atmospheres
[42:31] of your life and he burned it up
[42:34] right and that's what needs to happen to
[42:36] us that's how you break the family curse
[42:38] that's how you that's how you become
[42:40] something different what god actually
[42:43] intended for you to be in the first
[42:44] place so he doesn't take gabe and make
[42:46] him something different but he makes
[42:48] gabe the way he wants him to be
[42:50] right without the without all these
[42:53] curses that come in the family without
[42:54] all the the hindrances of the past
[42:56] without all the without all the years
[42:59] and years that satan has worked maybe in
[43:01] your family to try to make it a certain
[43:03] way and god will bring it back to what
[43:05] it's supposed to be
[43:07] amen and one day we'll be in a body
[43:09] that's the way it's supposed to be not
[43:11] just the
[43:12] not just this but even that body it
[43:15] won't be something different it'll be
[43:17] you
[43:18] the way you were meant to be
[43:21] are you with me tonight
[43:23] so i want us to find value in who we are
[43:26] and yet realize that we must be born
[43:29] again
[43:30] in order to become who he wants us to be
[43:33] you don't want us to be cookie cutters
[43:36] and all be copies of someone else
[43:39] he don't want me as a preacher as a
[43:41] pastor to be a copy of somebody else he
[43:43] wants me to be me
[43:45] he wants you to be you
[43:47] right he wants you to be who he called
[43:50] you to be he made you to be who was in
[43:52] his mind for you to be before the
[43:54] foundation of the earth but satan has
[43:56] come and corrupted through the fall and
[43:58] done all of these things but he's
[43:59] bringing you back
[44:01] out of time into eternity again now he's
[44:04] transforming us back to his original
[44:06] purpose he's destroying he destroys the
[44:09] atmosphere of sin in your life and he
[44:11] actually remakes you into a new creature
[44:14] he calls it a new creature a new
[44:15] creation but it is you
[44:18] it's just it's just in uh he takes the
[44:22] uh the same person and he makes a new
[44:24] person now
[44:25] when he does that many times we get
[44:27] confused because we begin to think well
[44:29] you say brother ben i i thought i was
[44:31] saved and then i did something after i
[44:33] got saved after i got filled with the
[44:36] holy spirit i did something that reminds
[44:38] me of who i used to be
[44:43] how many of you have done that
[44:45] we've all we can all be honest and say
[44:46] i've done things that remind me maybe i
[44:49] don't smoke or drink anymore i don't do
[44:51] drugs i don't do those things but yet at
[44:53] some point i i did something i said oh
[44:55] god
[44:56] and quickly i repented but i thought i i
[44:58] i you know that here
[45:00] that's who my family is that's not me
[45:03] that that's not who you made me to be
[45:06] and so i think and many times people
[45:07] come and they'll say well i thought i
[45:08] got saved i thought i was filled with
[45:11] the holy ghost young people do this so
[45:12] come to an altar
[45:14] and and be just full of the holy ghost
[45:15] and leave him
[45:17] and then they'll go out and and they'll
[45:18] find themselves attracted to the wrong
[45:20] thing or or there'll be a wrong spirit
[45:23] come on them and they'll repent of it
[45:25] but the the shame that comes with it
[45:27] because well i thought i was different
[45:29] but see you still have the same things
[45:31] that you have to deal with
[45:34] right you still have the same weaknesses
[45:36] in many ways but now there's a control
[45:38] tower there now there's a man running
[45:40] the ship now you're not wandering across
[45:43] the ocean by yourself but there's a
[45:45] captain in the ship
[45:47] so now it's the time that you can call
[45:48] on god and say god i know you're in
[45:50] charge
[45:55] so we shouldn't get discouraged when we
[45:58] act like a pruitt
[46:01] and you put your own family name in
[46:03] there
[46:04] right
[46:06] and yet we should not make that the
[46:08] standard
[46:10] are you with me now or we're called to
[46:12] the scripture we're called to be the
[46:14] word
[46:16] right so we so he's making us that
[46:20] now
[46:22] with there's nine spiritual gifts that
[46:25] is given to the church and this kind of
[46:27] teaching tonight but just to kind of
[46:28] wrap these things up and
[46:30] and and hopefully be done tonight
[46:32] but there's nine spiritual gifts that
[46:34] are given to the church and those gifts
[46:36] are the ability to do something
[46:40] right to speak in tongues or
[46:42] or different gifts that are given to the
[46:44] church to prophesy
[46:46] and those are spread through the church
[46:48] but then we also find other gifts that
[46:50] are given in ephesians 4 11
[46:53] that are specific men called to specific
[46:56] places
[46:57] for a specific work and i want to show
[46:59] you how god
[47:00] uses who you are he doesn't destroy that
[47:04] but then he comes and transforms it and
[47:07] and that's what he did with the apostle
[47:08] paul ephesians 4 7 says unto every one
[47:11] of us has given grace according to the
[47:14] measure of the gift of christ so we all
[47:16] have a measure of the gift of christ the
[47:18] gift is christ
[47:20] but we all have a measure some a certain
[47:22] amount of ability that he gives us he
[47:25] makes us a certain way wherefore he
[47:27] saith when he ascended up on high he led
[47:29] captivity captive he gave gifts unto men
[47:32] now watch now he gives gifts to men and
[47:34] then he gives gifted men
[47:37] right there there are some men that
[47:39] these are predestined offices and i'm
[47:41] going to show you where brother branham
[47:42] makes the difference between that of the
[47:44] nine spiritual gifts he said he gives
[47:46] some apostles and some prophets and some
[47:49] evangelists and some pastors and
[47:52] teachers
[47:53] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[47:55] work of the ministry
[47:56] for the edifying of the body
[47:59] of christ so if we pass the need for
[48:01] that then we pass the need for
[48:03] edification
[48:05] right so as long as we need edified
[48:08] we need the ministry
[48:10] so god said in the church brother
[48:12] branham said now there's nine spiritual
[48:14] gifts goes in each local body which is
[48:16] tongues interpretation of tongues
[48:18] prophecies and so forth but there is
[48:20] five predestinated offices of the church
[48:23] apostles
[48:24] prophets teachers pastors and
[48:26] evangelists that's what god sent in the
[48:28] church he said the holy spirit he said
[48:30] that's an office the holy spirit might
[48:32] fall on one tonight and speak in tongues
[48:34] and the other give the prophecy and so
[48:36] forth and then next night it might be on
[48:38] somebody else and somebody else like
[48:40] that he said that's local gifts in the
[48:41] body to keep us straight so we need
[48:44] those gifts to keep us straight
[48:46] he said but in the church alone five
[48:48] offices
[48:49] apostles means missionaries
[48:52] apostles prophets teachers
[48:54] pastors and evangelists god sets those
[48:57] in
[48:58] the church he said now let's believe
[49:00] with all of our heart i love this
[49:02] that through these ministering gifts
[49:05] that the great god of heaven will send
[49:07] christ
[49:10] that's how he works he sends the skits
[49:12] he said and through these ministering
[49:14] gifts that he would send christ among us
[49:16] tonight not that we'll see the man the
[49:19] gift
[49:20] but that will see jesus
[49:22] right if you get a gift you think of the
[49:24] giver
[49:26] right you're not
[49:27] it's to make you think of the giver
[49:29] that's why they say it's the thought
[49:30] that counts
[49:31] because it's the giver that you're
[49:33] thinking of
[49:34] and that's what we want to do now
[49:36] again he said as we know there's local
[49:38] gifts of nine gifts in the church but
[49:40] there's offices of the church and god he
[49:42] said that's predestinated or for
[49:44] ordained god has said in the church
[49:46] apostles then prophets and teachers
[49:48] pastors evangelists and so forth that's
[49:50] god's gift set in the church he said
[49:52] then there is nine spiritual gifts that
[49:54] operate in the local body i feel like i
[49:56] can't hear myself i know i probably can
[49:58] brother joel but
[49:59] he said there is nine spirits that's
[50:01] what you get when you get all this
[50:02] technology you get used to it
[50:04] he said there is nine spiritual gifts
[50:06] that operate in the local body
[50:08] of believers he said they must be
[50:10] checked by two or three judges before
[50:11] they're given to the church this is very
[50:13] important because we don't just let
[50:15] someone come in here and begin to
[50:17] prophesy
[50:18] write or begin to begin to speak in
[50:20] tongues and with tongues interpretation
[50:23] you understand a person can speak in
[50:24] tongues quietly in prayer and i would
[50:26] have no problem with that but if a
[50:28] person would speak in tongues in the
[50:29] midst of the congregation you would wait
[50:31] on an interpretation but really that
[50:33] should be judged first
[50:35] right because before it's given to the
[50:37] church because sometimes they could be
[50:39] wrong
[50:40] he's but then he goes and he talks about
[50:42] prophets he said notice these prophets
[50:44] they were born
[50:46] he said in jeremiah god said before you
[50:48] was even conceived in your mother's womb
[50:50] i ordained you a prophet over the
[50:52] nations moses was born a prophet
[50:55] on the baptist 712 years before he was
[50:58] born he was the voice of one crying in
[51:00] the wilderness yes
[51:01] isaiah the prophet speaking of him he
[51:03] said see these gifts are born gifts
[51:06] now he's not just talking about a
[51:08] prophet he said these are predestinated
[51:10] gifts
[51:10] born gifts if you're a minister in the
[51:12] fivefold ministry you were born a
[51:14] minister
[51:16] right your mama might not have thought
[51:17] you was one
[51:19] your daddy might not have thought you
[51:20] was one
[51:21] but you were born that way
[51:24] right you couldn't help it
[51:26] that's right now the bible tells us the
[51:28] gifts and calling of god are without
[51:30] repentance the gifts and calling of god
[51:32] are without repentance so paul
[51:34] understood this now
[51:36] as we pick up the story of paul he
[51:38] understood after his conversion that god
[51:40] had called him to be who he was before
[51:43] his conversion so
[51:44] he knew that he he had nothing to do
[51:47] with that god had already called him to
[51:48] be
[51:49] an apostle
[51:51] and see god needed who paul was
[51:55] i want you to understand this tonight
[51:56] and and you're not going to understand
[51:58] this from the baptist church or the
[52:00] methodist church nothing against them
[52:02] but we understand this by the message of
[52:03] the hour you're a gene of god
[52:06] you're a thought of god
[52:08] god thought about you and he made you
[52:10] the way he wanted you
[52:13] right and maybe what he made you and so
[52:15] you think of yourself right now and you
[52:17] say well god must have made me
[52:18] imperfectly but that's not what god made
[52:20] you he made what you could be
[52:22] he put in you he doesn't he doesn't make
[52:25] the fruit tree the apple tree
[52:27] immediately an apple tree but he makes a
[52:28] seed and within it is the ability to be
[52:31] an apple tree
[52:32] and then when it's put in the right
[52:34] atmosphere it'll grow and produce apples
[52:37] right and so god puts something in you
[52:40] and that's something he wants to be
[52:41] expressed in a certain way and so with
[52:44] paul we could say it like this he could
[52:46] say god has not cast away his people god
[52:48] needed his people
[52:50] now think about this as it relates to
[52:52] the israelites for a moment god needed
[52:54] benjamin
[52:57] see he needed benjamin to be that
[52:58] protector and we went into it how that
[53:00] benjamin would be there in the
[53:01] millennium
[53:03] right and be the protector of the king
[53:05] you remember that
[53:07] benjamin would be the protector of the
[53:08] king the scripture says that in the
[53:10] millennium so he's looking all the way
[53:12] down there see god's looking past what's
[53:14] going on right now
[53:16] yes are you hearing me tonight
[53:18] he's looking past what's going on right
[53:19] now he said well i'm sitting on a
[53:20] wednesday night in church and i feel
[53:22] like you know things just aren't going
[53:23] like i thought they would go but god's
[53:25] looking past what's going on right now
[53:28] maybe he needed a mother maybe he needed
[53:29] a housewife maybe he needed a carpenter
[53:31] maybe he needed a factory worker he
[53:33] needs you
[53:36] right he needs you he needs you to be
[53:37] here
[53:38] god could have done it any way he wanted
[53:40] to but he uses people to do it
[53:43] so god needed paul
[53:45] and he needed him to be born in tarsus
[53:47] and he needed him to be raised a certain
[53:49] way and he needed him to be a benjamite
[53:53] are you with me now
[53:54] god don't do anything by accident
[53:57] but not only did god need paul but god
[53:58] needed joel
[54:00] he needed to be born a certain place
[54:02] are you with me now
[54:04] god needed you
[54:06] not just the ministry we'll get to that
[54:08] in just a moment because but the
[54:09] ministry ordering to a certain thing but
[54:12] so are you
[54:15] god needed you
[54:16] he needed a bench of mine he needed
[54:18] somebody who would be a protector of the
[54:20] word
[54:21] but he don't need a ravening wolf
[54:24] he don't need a persecutor
[54:27] so oh my
[54:28] so he drops down
[54:30] when the time is right
[54:32] into paul's life
[54:35] and paul thought he had a pretty good
[54:37] career going on he thought he was a
[54:38] pretty good pharisee he thought he was a
[54:40] pretty good man he thought he was
[54:42] everything he was supposed to be but god
[54:44] dropped down into his life do you
[54:45] remember the moment when god dropped
[54:47] down into your life
[54:49] there come a day when god dropped down
[54:50] into your life and all of a sudden he
[54:52] changed what you were to what you could
[54:54] be
[54:55] and he began to do a work in your life
[54:57] he began to do a work in paul's life and
[54:59] so paul could would go on from that
[55:01] moment and he recognized that god did
[55:03] this i am what i am by the grace of god
[55:05] as we read to you i believe last
[55:07] wednesday night i am what i am by the
[55:09] grace of god so we find whenever paul
[55:11] would introduce himself to the people in
[55:13] his ladders
[55:14] let's look at how he would do that
[55:16] he said it this way in romans he said
[55:18] paul a servant of jesus christ
[55:21] called to be an apostle
[55:23] separated under the gospel of god
[55:26] all called and separated
[55:29] in first corinthians 1 he said paul
[55:31] called to be an apostle of jesus christ
[55:33] through the will of god
[55:35] and sosthenes our brother
[55:38] again in ii corinthians 1 1 paul an
[55:40] apostle of jesus christ by the will of
[55:43] god
[55:44] notice how he he keeps reminding him i
[55:47] don't think he's just reminding them
[55:49] but he's reminding himself
[55:52] paul you were a pharisee
[55:54] paul you were saul of tarsus you were a
[55:56] persecutor of the church
[55:58] how did he get past that see the great
[56:00] thing to me about paul is not so much
[56:03] that the people would ever accept him
[56:05] because the people saw that jesus had
[56:07] done something in his life
[56:09] but the hardest thing how would he ever
[56:11] accept it
[56:13] right but brother brown said he spent
[56:14] three and a half years in arabia
[56:16] comparing the experience that he had
[56:18] with the word
[56:20] right hallelujah and when he got done oh
[56:23] my that's we need the experience but we
[56:25] need to spend some time take some
[56:27] wednesday nights and compare the
[56:29] experience we have with the word
[56:32] and so he spends three and a half years
[56:33] in arabia comparing his experience with
[56:35] the word and then what what does he do
[56:37] he comes back and he knows god did this
[56:42] i couldn't do it by myself i couldn't
[56:43] make myself an apostle
[56:46] i couldn't make myself a preacher
[56:48] so i can have confidence so he's not
[56:50] like saul remember saul was always
[56:53] worried somebody's going to take my
[56:54] position somebody's going to assert me
[56:56] somebody's going to take over the
[56:58] kingship paul don't have to be like that
[57:00] he said whether they preach a strife or
[57:02] whatever he said some preach wanting to
[57:04] add affliction to my bonds he said but
[57:06] nevertheless christ is preached
[57:09] why can paul be like that why can't he
[57:10] stand there in flamingo and say paul a
[57:12] prisoner of jesus christ
[57:15] why can't he do that because he knows
[57:18] he's bound to do this it wasn't him that
[57:19] did it was god that did it
[57:22] are you with me tonight
[57:24] he knows it had to be predestined
[57:27] by god
[57:28] i hope we would i wish we would get a
[57:30] revelation of that
[57:33] and we wouldn't spend all so much time
[57:35] worrying
[57:36] well maybe i'll miss the rapture maybe
[57:38] i'll i know god called you to something
[57:43] maybe we need to remind ourselves
[57:46] when we write a letter
[57:49] benjamin the seed of god
[57:52] are you with me
[57:54] luella the seed of god
[57:57] the bride of jesus christ
[58:00] the elect of the hour
[58:04] that'll break that curse off of you
[58:06] thinking oh my family i'm the least of
[58:08] the tribe of benjamin i i i come from
[58:10] the least family and then you get all
[58:12] worried and self-conscious about what
[58:14] you're doing oh god i pray that he would
[58:16] break that off of us tonight and we'd
[58:18] begin to step forward and say i am what
[58:20] god made me i can do what god says i can
[58:23] do
[58:24] are you with me tonight yeah and it's
[58:26] not some joel osteen thing where he and
[58:29] i called his name but but you know the
[58:31] man that would stand up there and just
[58:33] we got that satellite radio and he's
[58:35] always on there and peter will turn him
[58:36] on because he
[58:39] he likes to hear that i guess and
[58:42] he'll sit there and just just chuckle
[58:44] you know and he's just concentrating
[58:45] you're called you're you're the elective
[58:47] guardian but he's
[58:48] right but see paul went took his
[58:51] experience
[58:52] number one he had a real experience
[58:55] and then two he took his experience
[58:56] compared it with the word
[58:58] and then he could have confidence he's
[59:00] not just saying it he's not just
[59:02] standing up there and saying you're
[59:02] elected you're called you're chosen but
[59:04] he's standing and saying i'm elected i'm
[59:06] called i'm chosen because god said i was
[59:09] god came down in my life i've seen the
[59:11] pillar of fire i met god on the back
[59:14] side of the desert in a burning bush
[59:16] i've had an experience with god
[59:19] are you with me now
[59:21] paul an apostle by the will of god
[59:24] galatians paul and apostle not of men
[59:27] neither by man
[59:29] but by jesus christ
[59:31] and god the father who raised him from
[59:33] the dead ephesians 1 1 paul an apostle
[59:36] of jesus christ
[59:38] by the will of god
[59:40] oh my to the saints which are at ephesus
[59:43] and to the faithful in christ jesus
[59:45] first timothy paul an apostle of jesus
[59:48] christ by the commandment
[59:52] he said paul i'm going to show you what
[59:54] you're going to do i'm not going to give
[59:55] you an option
[59:57] because you wouldn't pick you to do it
[1:00:00] you'd pick somebody else the church
[1:00:02] wouldn't have picked paul
[1:00:03] paul wouldn't have picked paul
[1:00:05] but god chose paul
[1:00:08] and so paul has to come out and say i'm
[1:00:09] an apostle not by the commandment of man
[1:00:12] but by the commandment of god
[1:00:15] i didn't take my position because i got
[1:00:18] all the men in the message to agree this
[1:00:19] was that you would be a good pastor of
[1:00:21] that church you'd be good no i am what i
[1:00:23] am by the grace of god
[1:00:24] you are what you are by the grace of god
[1:00:27] we don't bring people through a some
[1:00:29] kind of
[1:00:30] a a a place a a cemetery as brother
[1:00:33] branham calls it a seminary where we
[1:00:36] begin to
[1:00:37] graduate them out and then we pick a
[1:00:38] church for them that's not what we do in
[1:00:40] the message of the hour what do we do we
[1:00:41] watch a man's life and and we see what's
[1:00:44] going on within how he struggles and
[1:00:46] what he does and and and how he's how he
[1:00:48] how he ministers and what his ministry
[1:00:50] is you watch it it becomes self-evident
[1:00:52] and through the the fire you throw him
[1:00:55] in the fire and see what he does
[1:00:57] and through the fire of life it produces
[1:00:59] something in his life where he can
[1:01:00] become a pastor
[1:01:02] become a leader are you with me now or
[1:01:05] become an evangelist there's nothing
[1:01:07] special in that sense about the pastor
[1:01:08] he could be any of these five gifts or
[1:01:10] for that matter any member of the bride
[1:01:14] you don't just become a deacon because i
[1:01:16] said you were one
[1:01:18] you don't just become a
[1:01:20] a prayer warrior because i said you were
[1:01:23] one you become that through the fires of
[1:01:25] life and god worked that in your life
[1:01:28] until that's the gift that began to
[1:01:29] manifest in your life
[1:01:32] you understand you went through the fire
[1:01:33] of life
[1:01:34] and it was revealed there was gold in
[1:01:36] there
[1:01:38] oh my
[1:01:40] amen that ought to give us confidence
[1:01:43] to do whatever job we've been called to
[1:01:45] i can look at you and say i think you're
[1:01:47] a good deacon i think you're i think we
[1:01:48] have wonderful deacons i'm so glad to
[1:01:50] see what god's doing among us but i
[1:01:52] think we have wonderful song leaders but
[1:01:54] i can't just look at you and say this is
[1:01:55] what you're going to be you got to be
[1:01:57] called to that
[1:01:58] on some level and again not all those
[1:02:01] gifts are predestined gifts sometimes
[1:02:02] god could use you for a while
[1:02:04] and then set you down
[1:02:06] but these predestined gifts are born
[1:02:08] that way
[1:02:09] you understand
[1:02:11] now
[1:02:12] so that's why a deacon is not
[1:02:14] necessarily a lifelong thing although
[1:02:16] for brother danny
[1:02:18] it's approaching that
[1:02:20] but it's not necessarily a life sentence
[1:02:24] right because you might be called to
[1:02:26] that for a season
[1:02:27] right but a minister of the gospel if
[1:02:29] he's an evangelist if he's a pastor now
[1:02:31] his ministry may change but the gift
[1:02:33] that he has was always there
[1:02:36] whatever he was ultimately meant to be
[1:02:37] was always there
[1:02:39] so he says i'm gonna i'm an apostle by
[1:02:41] the will of god by the commandment of
[1:02:44] god he said paul a servant of god an
[1:02:46] apostle of jesus christ according to the
[1:02:48] faith of god gillette
[1:02:50] i love that and the acknowledging of the
[1:02:52] truth which is after godliness so god
[1:02:54] called me to be this
[1:02:56] and so he was adamant again we've been
[1:02:58] over this but in galatians he was
[1:03:00] adamant that his gospel was not from man
[1:03:02] not even from himself
[1:03:05] he said i didn't make this up
[1:03:08] see if you made up your gospel then your
[1:03:10] gospel is only as strong as you are
[1:03:15] and if you can't change your body i
[1:03:17] don't want to hear a made-up gospel that
[1:03:19] you made up
[1:03:25] because you can't you can't change it
[1:03:27] who you are
[1:03:29] but this this gospel
[1:03:32] will change our bodies one day
[1:03:35] how will it do that if i made it up it's
[1:03:37] not going to happen
[1:03:38] but if i believe the word
[1:03:41] hey man one day it's going to change my
[1:03:43] body i believe in a supernatural god
[1:03:47] right who has a supernatural word
[1:03:49] and so paul said i didn't make it up
[1:03:52] i didn't get it from just myself
[1:03:55] and he said that he uses the reason for
[1:03:57] that he says because you know what i was
[1:04:00] he said you've heard of my conversation
[1:04:01] or my lifestyle in time past in the
[1:04:04] jewish religion
[1:04:05] that beyond measure i persecuted the
[1:04:07] church of god and wasted it
[1:04:09] and profited in the jewish religion
[1:04:11] above many my equals in my own nation
[1:04:13] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:04:15] traditions of my fathers
[1:04:17] but when it pleased god
[1:04:19] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:04:23] and called me by his grace
[1:04:25] see this isn't about us
[1:04:27] it's not about well i figured it out
[1:04:29] i made it up no paul said i didn't
[1:04:32] figure it out i didn't make it up but it
[1:04:34] would the revelation i got matched the
[1:04:36] word
[1:04:37] because god had pleased god to reveal
[1:04:40] his son in me supernaturally
[1:04:42] that i might preach him among the
[1:04:43] heathen immediately i conferred not with
[1:04:46] flesh and blood neither when i up to
[1:04:47] jerusalem to them which were apostles
[1:04:49] before me but i went into arabia and
[1:04:51] returned to get into damascus what was
[1:04:52] it to compare his experience with the
[1:04:54] word
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:57] because god's the true experience will
[1:04:59] always compare with the word
[1:05:02] and but so we got it from god he said
[1:05:03] and get it from myself
[1:05:05] it's important salvation doesn't come
[1:05:07] from us right
[1:05:08] it comes from god
[1:05:11] paul was always an apostle
[1:05:14] he just didn't know it
[1:05:17] but now see then after he realizes that
[1:05:19] now he can't boast about being one
[1:05:23] all right
[1:05:24] because he is the proverbial turtle on a
[1:05:26] fence post
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:29] the turtle's on the fence post he can't
[1:05:32] he didn't get there by himself
[1:05:35] he can't climb there
[1:05:37] nothing he can do to get there oh my
[1:05:40] that's the way we are church
[1:05:42] that's the position we stand in today
[1:05:44] by the grace of god i i can't make
[1:05:46] myself a believer i can't make you a
[1:05:48] believer but i'm here i believe and you
[1:05:50] believe why
[1:05:52] because god placed us here
[1:05:55] and put within us something that could
[1:05:57] believe
[1:05:59] now
[1:06:01] again he couldn't boast about it he said
[1:06:02] in first corinthians 9 16 though i
[1:06:04] preached the gospel i have nothing to
[1:06:07] glory of
[1:06:08] for necessity is laid upon me
[1:06:11] yea he said woe is unto me
[1:06:14] if i preach not the gospel
[1:06:17] yes so it's not that i want to i can't
[1:06:20] not
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:24] i'm afraid to not preach
[1:06:27] that's why you won't tell a real
[1:06:28] god-called man that not to preach
[1:06:30] anymore
[1:06:32] not to stand in the pulpit and preach
[1:06:33] you can't tell a god called man that
[1:06:36] right he'll find somewhere to preach
[1:06:38] because there's something inside of him
[1:06:41] you know he said if i do this thing
[1:06:42] willingly i have a reward some of us are
[1:06:45] not very willing to preach are we
[1:06:46] brother allen
[1:06:48] some of us are not willing
[1:06:49] but if we do it willingly he said
[1:06:51] there's a reward for that
[1:06:53] but if against my will
[1:06:55] a dispensation of the gospel is
[1:06:58] committed unto me and so he's saying i
[1:07:00] was the only one who could do it
[1:07:04] that's where you want to be
[1:07:06] in a place that god creates for you that
[1:07:08] you're the only one that fits that place
[1:07:11] you understand you're the only one that
[1:07:13] fits in that marriage
[1:07:14] you're not replaceable
[1:07:17] you with me yeah you're the only one
[1:07:19] that fits right where you do in the
[1:07:20] church
[1:07:22] you're not replaceable that's why we
[1:07:23] don't hop around jump from place to
[1:07:24] place and pillar to post
[1:07:26] we're not replaceable
[1:07:29] are you with me and again god may call
[1:07:30] you to a certain season to a certain
[1:07:32] thing and move you but you'll fit where
[1:07:34] you are you belong somewhere
[1:07:37] because you're in the mind of god god
[1:07:39] don't do anything haphazardly
[1:07:41] and so you sit there and you worry oh am
[1:07:43] i doing what uh am i am i able to do
[1:07:46] anything i'm just useless in the church
[1:07:48] you're never useless you're here for a
[1:07:51] reason
[1:07:54] you're here for a reason
[1:07:57] i
[1:07:58] excuse me for digressing tonight but
[1:08:00] we'll get over it i've got six minutes
[1:08:01] left is what i've got on here but it may
[1:08:04] be a few more minutes than that but
[1:08:07] we uh you know every person in this
[1:08:09] church there's a there's a reason for
[1:08:11] you
[1:08:12] right there's a reason
[1:08:14] there's a purpose for you it matters
[1:08:17] it matters that you're here and i don't
[1:08:19] mean just necessarily in the building
[1:08:21] although that matters too
[1:08:22] but it matters that you're in the church
[1:08:25] it matters that you're a part of the
[1:08:27] church even the little ones it matters
[1:08:30] wyatt's sitting over there and jason and
[1:08:32] melody and the other young ones that sit
[1:08:34] and the young ones in the back and the
[1:08:35] ones that that come it matters that
[1:08:37] they're in the church
[1:08:39] right it matters that millie's in the
[1:08:41] church and the ones that have joined us
[1:08:43] and and several of you weren't here two
[1:08:46] years ago when we come and it's been two
[1:08:47] years now
[1:08:48] as of a couple of weeks ago i believe
[1:08:50] it's been two years since i've been the
[1:08:52] pastor here and during that time a lot
[1:08:54] of things have changed and several of
[1:08:56] you are new but it matters that you're
[1:08:58] here
[1:08:59] what would we do i think so many times
[1:09:01] at different ones and think what would i
[1:09:03] do without a brother danny or brother
[1:09:05] harvey or or brother gabe or
[1:09:07] or brother joel or or or any one of you
[1:09:10] that are sitting here and i don't want
[1:09:11] to leave any of you out because some of
[1:09:12] you don't do much in the actual service
[1:09:14] what would i do without brother harold
[1:09:16] i think what would i do without brother
[1:09:18] harold being here and and i think about
[1:09:20] that and i think god you put him here
[1:09:23] and and there must be a reason why he's
[1:09:25] here
[1:09:26] right and what would i do without sister
[1:09:28] fritz back there and she's expressed to
[1:09:30] me before she don't want to be where
[1:09:32] she's not doing anything because she's
[1:09:33] always done something for the gospel and
[1:09:35] she feels useless when she's not working
[1:09:37] and so she wants to print my address
[1:09:39] labels and do things and and do things
[1:09:42] for me in the church and i thank god for
[1:09:44] that but that's not what makes you
[1:09:45] useful sister fritz says the fact that
[1:09:47] you're here it shows us that that
[1:09:50] there's a dedication in your heart
[1:09:52] i think about the story someone told
[1:09:54] there's a
[1:09:55] they said this this lady that was deaf
[1:09:57] she went to church and she never heard a
[1:09:58] thing
[1:09:59] and they asked her they said why do you
[1:10:01] bother going to church you can't hear
[1:10:03] and she said but i just want the devil
[1:10:04] to know which side i'm on
[1:10:09] so it matters that you're here
[1:10:11] it matters don't let the devil beat you
[1:10:13] up and say well i i come from a bad
[1:10:16] family i've come through a hard time i
[1:10:18] i've been through many struggles and it
[1:10:20] don't matter it seems like nobody ever
[1:10:22] notices me but god notices you
[1:10:25] he sees you and you have a reward for
[1:10:27] doing what god wants you to do
[1:10:30] are you with me now
[1:10:32] and so but but now to paul he said there
[1:10:35] was a dispensation place to me i
[1:10:37] couldn't help but be who i am i've got
[1:10:40] to do what you call me to do how many
[1:10:42] ever felt like that i didn't necessarily
[1:10:44] want to be in this message but god
[1:10:46] called me to this message
[1:10:48] i can't do anything different than this
[1:10:50] message
[1:10:51] are you with me now this word is who i
[1:10:54] am
[1:10:55] it's part of me
[1:10:57] it's predestined other people don't
[1:10:59] understand that but it's predestined to
[1:11:01] me
[1:11:03] amen
[1:11:04] i'm just preaching to you tonight but
[1:11:05] just
[1:11:06] now
[1:11:08] so paul says where is my what is my
[1:11:09] reward then verily that when i preach
[1:11:11] the gospel i may make the gospel without
[1:11:13] charge
[1:11:14] and so paul would do extra things he'd
[1:11:16] make tents and give the money back to
[1:11:18] the church even though he goes through a
[1:11:20] list and says the ministry should live
[1:11:22] by the offering but he does that because
[1:11:24] you don't want to abuse his power in the
[1:11:25] gospel and we've been over that
[1:11:27] but he does and he does that though so
[1:11:29] because he feels like i want a reward
[1:11:31] and i can't get a reward for being an
[1:11:33] apostle
[1:11:34] because god made me an apostle
[1:11:37] are you with me now
[1:11:39] jeremiah experienced the same thing in
[1:11:41] jeremiah 29 jeremiah took a lot of heat
[1:11:43] for preaching what he preached
[1:11:45] because every one of jeremiah's sermon
[1:11:47] was sermons was hellfire and brimstone
[1:11:50] it was he got up he was the weeping
[1:11:52] prophet he got up and preached the
[1:11:54] babylonians are coming you just need to
[1:11:55] surrender
[1:11:57] actually threw him in jail over it and
[1:11:58] they persecuted him over it
[1:12:00] but guess what he was right
[1:12:03] but jeremiah stood there because he said
[1:12:05] you sinned in the and the babylonians
[1:12:08] are coming and he said okay i'm not
[1:12:10] going to preach anymore he said i'll not
[1:12:11] make mention of him nor speak anymore in
[1:12:13] his name
[1:12:15] but his word was in my heart as a
[1:12:17] burning fire shut up in my bones
[1:12:20] i was weary with forbearing i could not
[1:12:23] stay
[1:12:24] god did that
[1:12:26] god made you who you are
[1:12:28] not because you wanted to or you willed
[1:12:30] it or you made it up
[1:12:33] god pulled you and dragged you and
[1:12:35] pushed you and
[1:12:36] propped you up and set you on the fence
[1:12:38] posted here he is
[1:12:43] amen who set the city on the hill right
[1:12:47] you ever think about that
[1:12:48] i didn't until just now
[1:12:51] who set the city on a hill
[1:12:53] god did he said a city set on a hill
[1:12:54] can't be hid why is the city on a hill
[1:12:58] god put him on the hill
[1:13:01] amen
[1:13:02] god put him on a hill god put you where
[1:13:04] you are to shine in the age that you're
[1:13:06] in
[1:13:07] are you with me now god did that
[1:13:10] brother branham tell us it's in things
[1:13:12] that are to be it's very common quote
[1:13:14] and you've heard me say it many times
[1:13:16] but he said in my father's house there's
[1:13:17] many kinds of mansions he said i don't
[1:13:20] believe that when we get to heaven we'll
[1:13:21] be just everybody look just exactly
[1:13:23] alike i don't believe that we'll all be
[1:13:24] brought blondes or brunettes or little
[1:13:27] or big or giants
[1:13:29] my brother monroe champion if you're
[1:13:30] listening tonight brother monroe god
[1:13:32] bless you i'm glad and maybe maybe he
[1:13:34] would listen sometime and i know he's
[1:13:35] told me he has but
[1:13:37] monroe was a good friend of mine but
[1:13:38] mother monroe had a doctrine or an idea
[1:13:41] he believed his faith was that he was
[1:13:43] going to be six foot tall and have
[1:13:45] blonde hair
[1:13:46] and be perfect weight and proportioned
[1:13:49] and everything like that when he gets
[1:13:50] over there
[1:13:51] so that's what it's the off and he
[1:13:52] looked like
[1:13:54] and i had a problem with that
[1:13:57] because i think god made me perfect
[1:14:02] in his eyes
[1:14:04] thank you for reminding me
[1:14:09] but we are perfect in god's eyes
[1:14:11] but that'd be wonderful you think well
[1:14:13] but the thing is i told him i said you
[1:14:15] know you and me would look exactly alike
[1:14:19] if we got over there you couldn't even
[1:14:20] tell god's a god of variety
[1:14:22] he don't want us to look exactly alike
[1:14:25] so when we get there we're not going to
[1:14:26] be a bunch of robots
[1:14:29] right and all looking and acting and
[1:14:32] i'll have the same personality wouldn't
[1:14:33] that be dull
[1:14:35] see when you get to heaven you're still
[1:14:37] going to have your personality
[1:14:39] brother harvey's going to be taking
[1:14:41] water bottles and saving them and
[1:14:46] it's still going to be you
[1:14:49] all right
[1:14:51] but david's still going to be a fireball
[1:14:53] some of you are going to you're still
[1:14:54] going to be you do you understand
[1:14:55] tonight
[1:14:56] you're still going to be you i'm still
[1:14:58] going to be me praise god
[1:15:01] but we'll be a perfect version of that
[1:15:04] thank god
[1:15:06] he said i believe god is a god of
[1:15:08] variety the world proves that he's got
[1:15:10] big mountains little mountains he's got
[1:15:11] planes he's got deserts he's got
[1:15:13] different things because he made it the
[1:15:14] way he wanted it and he made the season
[1:15:17] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[1:15:19] seasons it shows he's a god of variety
[1:15:21] he made you in a
[1:15:22] variety amen some men are real
[1:15:25] blusterous some are real dogmatic others
[1:15:27] are fine he said
[1:15:29] others are kind
[1:15:31] you just find all different kinds of
[1:15:32] people
[1:15:34] in his kingdom
[1:15:35] and he talks about how you can't compare
[1:15:37] peter to andrew
[1:15:39] and we went over that how different they
[1:15:41] were in their makeup and then he talked
[1:15:43] about paul and how scholarly that he was
[1:15:46] and how he thought differently than
[1:15:47] these others
[1:15:48] but god made him that way
[1:15:51] god wanted him that way
[1:15:53] notice he said many mansions many kinds
[1:15:55] of mentions like many kinds of hills
[1:15:57] many kinds of rivers springs lakes they
[1:15:59] were here when you come here first
[1:16:00] because the kindness amen of your
[1:16:02] heavenly father placed them here he
[1:16:05] talked about mountains and rivers and
[1:16:06] plains and he said god unloaded his
[1:16:08] mortar box for me he said so i could
[1:16:10] have mountains but other men would look
[1:16:12] at that and say he said it's just two
[1:16:13] different natures but we'll both be in
[1:16:15] heaven
[1:16:16] right he said but the father knew that
[1:16:18] you would be here well here's the
[1:16:20] important part
[1:16:21] he said and prepared everything for you
[1:16:24] before you got here
[1:16:26] he said amen your first coming here he
[1:16:29] had it ready for you when you got here
[1:16:32] that's how
[1:16:33] predestined you are
[1:16:35] just how predestined am i well
[1:16:38] the world was prepared for you
[1:16:43] before you got here
[1:16:46] hallelujah
[1:16:47] god made hardy arkansas or whatever it
[1:16:50] is that that you've found contentment
[1:16:52] and
[1:16:53] and lived in your life god made that for
[1:16:55] you
[1:16:57] are you hearing me now
[1:16:59] the kindness of your heavenly father put
[1:17:01] it here
[1:17:02] he said you your father knew that you
[1:17:04] would be here and prepared everything
[1:17:06] for you before you got here you had it
[1:17:08] ready for you when you got here
[1:17:10] and so we find then that not all of us
[1:17:13] fit into ephesians 4 11 because those
[1:17:14] are predestined gifts
[1:17:16] men who are gifts in the body
[1:17:18] but all of us do fit into romans 8 28
[1:17:21] where he said all things someone say all
[1:17:24] things
[1:17:25] all things work together even your
[1:17:27] family background
[1:17:30] amen that's included in all
[1:17:32] even your genes even the even the wars
[1:17:35] even the struggles amen
[1:17:38] even the trials oh we ought to worship a
[1:17:40] god like that
[1:17:42] even the struggles of life he made you
[1:17:44] that way
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:47] we are the called we are all called for
[1:17:50] a purpose
[1:17:51] he said for them that love god to them
[1:17:53] or the called according to his purpose
[1:17:56] brother branham speaks again of prophets
[1:17:58] he said the man who's seen the vision or
[1:17:59] heard his voice never altogether
[1:18:01] understood it
[1:18:03] many cases he didn't know
[1:18:06] now that's scriptural
[1:18:08] because he's just an instrument of god
[1:18:11] it's god's thoughts expressed through a
[1:18:12] man's lips moses said there'll be a
[1:18:14] prophet like me
[1:18:16] he may not even know what he was talking
[1:18:18] about
[1:18:19] david said my hands are pierced
[1:18:22] my hands and feet they pierced he didn't
[1:18:24] even know what he was he thought he was
[1:18:25] talking about himself
[1:18:28] they rent my garments
[1:18:30] he didn't know why he was saying it
[1:18:31] that's what brother branham taught us
[1:18:34] he said it's god's thoughts expressed
[1:18:36] through man's lips
[1:18:38] because a thought is a word expressed
[1:18:40] god does his own choosing by his
[1:18:42] predestinated choosing
[1:18:45] he done it in every age he set forth the
[1:18:47] man for each age he said like when moses
[1:18:50] when he was to fulfill what he told to
[1:18:52] abraham moses was born a proper child
[1:18:54] can i have a few more minutes tonight
[1:18:56] sorry i just i need to finish this and
[1:18:58] be done with it he said he was born that
[1:19:00] way because he was born for that purpose
[1:19:03] and so we find out that god does that in
[1:19:05] every age watch god does his own
[1:19:08] choosing by his own predestinated
[1:19:09] choosing chooses prophets and things for
[1:19:12] the age
[1:19:13] fixes his nature the man's nature the
[1:19:16] man's style of preaching
[1:19:18] on their gift and all that he does just
[1:19:20] to meet the challenge of that day
[1:19:23] oh my
[1:19:24] god that's why paul and brother branham
[1:19:26] were so similar in their approach but
[1:19:27] yet so different
[1:19:29] right because paul was called to the
[1:19:30] first church age
[1:19:32] brandon was called to the last church
[1:19:34] age
[1:19:35] you've had different pastors that
[1:19:37] different men in different areas they're
[1:19:38] different
[1:19:40] right god calls a man to to meet the
[1:19:42] challenge of that time
[1:19:44] you can say the challenge of that church
[1:19:48] are you with me now not that you're a
[1:19:50] challenge to me but you understand the
[1:19:52] ministry itself is a challenge
[1:19:55] satan is challenging us today
[1:19:57] but god calls a man to that challenge
[1:20:01] so it doesn't do me any good to whine
[1:20:02] about it and gripe about it
[1:20:05] oh i'm preaching it myself now
[1:20:08] oh like moses all the people the people
[1:20:10] you know
[1:20:11] all these people they just murmur and
[1:20:13] complain but then when god said okay
[1:20:15] i'll just do away with him he said lord
[1:20:17] yes
[1:20:18] take me instead
[1:20:21] the people you know are can be a
[1:20:24] challenge the place can be a challenge
[1:20:26] but god called you to it
[1:20:28] your family might be a challenge
[1:20:31] but god called you to that challenge
[1:20:34] your marriage might be a challenge
[1:20:36] but god called you to that challenge
[1:20:39] are you with me now he did not he didn't
[1:20:41] call you to meet an enemy that you can't
[1:20:44] defeat i shouldn't have put that in
[1:20:46] marriage together but
[1:20:52] but he didn't call you to a challenge
[1:20:54] that you couldn't win or you hear me
[1:20:56] tonight
[1:20:57] but god creates the man and sent him
[1:21:00] he said in his own mind he said we are a
[1:21:02] germ of the gene of god he knew that man
[1:21:05] would be there at that age he knew that
[1:21:07] man would be there at that age before
[1:21:09] there ever was a molecule or a light or
[1:21:10] anything else in the earth
[1:21:13] and so it's not just preachers because
[1:21:14] he goes on to say that if you are a son
[1:21:16] of god how many sons of god do we have
[1:21:19] or a daughter of god how many daughters
[1:21:21] of god do we have
[1:21:22] to meet the challenge of this hour he
[1:21:25] said manifested son or daughter of god
[1:21:28] he said he knew what bed and time you'd
[1:21:30] be planted you're in god all the time he
[1:21:31] knew what bed and time you were planted
[1:21:33] but now you're made a creature a son of
[1:21:34] god manifested son or daughter of god to
[1:21:37] meet the challenge of this hour to
[1:21:39] vindicate the true and living god of
[1:21:40] this hour
[1:21:42] glory the message that's coming forth in
[1:21:45] this time
[1:21:47] god don't do things like we do
[1:21:50] he needed paul to be born in tarsus
[1:21:54] and i'll just go over these things
[1:21:55] quickly before we close
[1:21:57] he needed paul to be born in tarsus
[1:21:59] a city hat that had a roman arena in it
[1:22:03] think about it he couldn't be born in
[1:22:05] jerusalem
[1:22:06] he had to be trained in jerusalem but he
[1:22:08] couldn't be born there you say oh you
[1:22:10] don't know what's trouble he couldn't be
[1:22:11] born there
[1:22:12] because he would say things like this
[1:22:14] he'd say
[1:22:15] he'd say run the race with patience
[1:22:18] he said runners that running a race he
[1:22:20] said they they they strip aside
[1:22:22] everything they lay aside every weight
[1:22:24] why do we have those scriptures because
[1:22:26] paul was born close enough to a roman
[1:22:28] arena
[1:22:30] that he could see it
[1:22:33] i keep under my body bring it under
[1:22:35] subjection a boxing metaphor
[1:22:38] because here was a young man that was
[1:22:39] educated and wealthy enough he could go
[1:22:41] to the games
[1:22:46] we miss we we don't understand god
[1:22:49] sometimes
[1:22:50] he needed him to be a roman citizen
[1:22:53] because he had to go and stand in front
[1:22:55] of caesar
[1:22:56] and one of the most wicked rulers that's
[1:22:59] ever been
[1:23:00] can you imagine what he must have felt
[1:23:01] like brother david one day
[1:23:04] that nero had seen a lot of things
[1:23:06] he was one of the most wicked men that's
[1:23:08] ever lived
[1:23:09] and he stood there that day and paul
[1:23:12] oh my here comes this little jew
[1:23:15] in front of him he said what's this man
[1:23:16] doing here
[1:23:18] well he's a roman citizen and every
[1:23:20] roman citizen has a right
[1:23:23] to stand before nero
[1:23:25] get his head chopped off
[1:23:29] but that's why they couldn't crucify him
[1:23:31] because he was a roman citizen they
[1:23:32] couldn't crucify citizens
[1:23:34] so he had a right to stand there because
[1:23:36] god for some reason
[1:23:39] nero won't have an excuse
[1:23:43] the man who
[1:23:46] oh god you think god's not merciful yeah
[1:23:49] he chose to have the gospel preached to
[1:23:51] the man who took christians put oil and
[1:23:54] tar on them and put them up as torches
[1:23:55] in his garden
[1:23:57] and god sent paul to that man
[1:24:00] he said brother ben you're wasting your
[1:24:01] time preaching to those people you're
[1:24:02] wasting your time preaching to that
[1:24:04] person trying to reach that person god
[1:24:05] sent paul to preach to him
[1:24:09] he had to preach to nero
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:13] in acts chapter 21 and verse 37 this is
[1:24:16] kind of how it came about that he would
[1:24:18] end up in rome because they would have
[1:24:20] killed him right there the jews wanted
[1:24:22] to kill him
[1:24:23] and and so there was a great chaos going
[1:24:25] on they were trying to kill him and the
[1:24:26] romans come and god him the soldiers and
[1:24:28] as paul was to be led into the castle he
[1:24:30] said to the chief captain he said may i
[1:24:32] speak unto thee
[1:24:33] he said can you speak greek
[1:24:36] he didn't expect him to be able to
[1:24:39] how why could he speak greek
[1:24:41] because he was raised in tarsus
[1:24:44] he said are you not that egyptian which
[1:24:47] made an uproar and led out in the
[1:24:48] wilderness four thousand men that were
[1:24:49] murderers it's funny how people
[1:24:51] they get the joel osteens and the many
[1:24:53] hens but they don't ever see the truth
[1:24:58] and this man missed jesus
[1:25:00] and he said you're that egyptian because
[1:25:02] there was an egyptian that come before
[1:25:03] jesus
[1:25:05] that made an uproar and led into the
[1:25:06] wilderness 4 000 men that were murderers
[1:25:09] but all they see is the false that's
[1:25:12] what the world sees
[1:25:13] but paul said i'm a man which i'm a jew
[1:25:16] of tarsus
[1:25:18] a city in cilicia he
[1:25:20] that's who he was
[1:25:22] he wasn't denying who he was
[1:25:24] he said a citizen of no mean city
[1:25:27] i come from a big city
[1:25:29] may not look like it i may be ragged and
[1:25:32] beaten and bloody but i come from a big
[1:25:34] city
[1:25:35] i come from tarsus
[1:25:37] a citizen of no mean city and i beseech
[1:25:39] thee suffer me to speak unto the people
[1:25:42] when he had given him license
[1:25:44] paul stood on the stairs and beckoned
[1:25:46] with the hand and of the people and when
[1:25:47] there was made a great silence he spake
[1:25:50] unto them now in the hebrew tongue
[1:25:52] saying men brethren and fathers hear my
[1:25:55] defense which i make now unto you and
[1:25:56] when they heard that he spake in the
[1:25:58] hebrew tongue he had to be born in
[1:26:00] tarsus he had to be raised in jerusalem
[1:26:03] he spent eight years under gamaliel
[1:26:05] he spoke hebrew
[1:26:08] oh my
[1:26:09] they kept the more silence
[1:26:11] they listened to him because he spoke to
[1:26:13] them in their own time
[1:26:15] god calls this man for a reason
[1:26:18] he said i'm verily a man which i'm a jew
[1:26:20] again he reminds them i'm a jew i was
[1:26:22] born in tarsus the city and cilicia yet
[1:26:25] brought up in this city at the feet of
[1:26:26] gamaliel
[1:26:27] taught according to the perfect manner
[1:26:29] of the law of the fathers and was
[1:26:31] zealous toward god as you all are this
[1:26:32] day but i challenge you to go and read
[1:26:34] the rest of the chapter because brother
[1:26:36] adam said every time paul gets in a
[1:26:37] tight spot he goes back to his
[1:26:39] conversion
[1:26:41] because being born in tarsus could only
[1:26:43] go so far
[1:26:44] being born in cilicia could only go so
[1:26:46] far
[1:26:47] being taught at the feet of gamalia
[1:26:48] would only gain you so much favor but he
[1:26:51] said i was didn't stop there
[1:26:53] amen he said i was taught i knew the law
[1:26:56] but the law couldn't make a change in my
[1:26:58] life the law couldn't change the binge
[1:27:00] of mine the law couldn't make me into
[1:27:02] what god wanted me to be but i met god
[1:27:04] one day on the damascus road how many
[1:27:06] could say amen to that tonight
[1:27:08] i met god
[1:27:10] he said i was just like you i was
[1:27:12] jealous toward god
[1:27:14] him and notice how he used to he was to
[1:27:17] appeal to them and yet he could not
[1:27:18] place confidence in who he was or what
[1:27:20] he had learned
[1:27:21] he told them about his conversion
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] he told him about the supernatural if
[1:27:27] you don't believe in the supernatural
[1:27:29] you're in a sorry shape
[1:27:31] because any idea can be talked out of
[1:27:33] you
[1:27:36] he comes always comes back to the
[1:27:37] supernatural
[1:27:39] the pillar of fire that appeared to him
[1:27:41] he said finally my brethren in
[1:27:43] philippians 3 1 rejoice in the lord this
[1:27:44] is at the end now of his life
[1:27:47] he said to write the same things to you
[1:27:48] to me indeed is not grievous but for you
[1:27:50] it is safe i hate preaching the same
[1:27:52] thing over and over and sometimes i feel
[1:27:54] like i tell you the same things read the
[1:27:55] same scriptures and paul said
[1:27:57] it's
[1:27:58] he said it it's easy for me to do that
[1:28:01] he said but for you it's safe in other
[1:28:03] words you need to hear it
[1:28:05] you need to be reminded rejoice in the
[1:28:07] lord how many times did he say that
[1:28:11] he told him he said beware of dogs
[1:28:13] beware of evil workers be aware of the
[1:28:15] concision
[1:28:16] the dogs he was speaking of was the
[1:28:18] judaizers
[1:28:20] that's right
[1:28:22] beware of the concision those who would
[1:28:23] separate themselves from the body
[1:28:26] he said for we are the circumcision
[1:28:28] which worship god in the spirit and
[1:28:30] rejoice in christ jesus
[1:28:32] and have no confidence
[1:28:36] this is where i'm closing this evening
[1:28:38] you have no confidence in the flesh
[1:28:40] see god made me who i am but that's not
[1:28:42] where i put my confidence
[1:28:46] are you with me now
[1:28:47] whether i had a good home or a bad home
[1:28:49] that's not where i put my confidence
[1:28:52] god brought me up a certain way but i
[1:28:54] don't put my confidence in that but i
[1:28:56] put it in a supernatural birth
[1:29:00] amen
[1:29:01] he said though i might also have
[1:29:02] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[1:29:04] think if he hath whereof he might trust
[1:29:06] in the flesh i'm more he said you think
[1:29:08] you've got a way to trust the flesh he
[1:29:10] said i do he said i was circumcised the
[1:29:12] eighth day
[1:29:13] of the stock of israel of the tribe of
[1:29:15] benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews
[1:29:18] as touching the law of pharisees
[1:29:20] concerning zeal persecuting the church
[1:29:23] touching the righteousness which is in
[1:29:24] the law blameless but what things were
[1:29:26] gained to me those i counted lost for
[1:29:29] christ
[1:29:30] yay dallas i count all things say all
[1:29:33] things
[1:29:34] all things all the things i've been
[1:29:36] through all of my past but lost for the
[1:29:38] excellency of the knowledge of christ
[1:29:40] jesus my lord for whom i have suffered
[1:29:42] the loss of all things
[1:29:44] and do count them but done
[1:29:46] use this very strong language
[1:29:48] that i may win christ
[1:29:51] and be found in him
[1:29:53] not having my own righteousness
[1:29:55] which is of the law but that which is to
[1:29:57] the faith of christ the righteousness
[1:29:59] which is of god by faith
[1:30:01] i love this that i may know him and the
[1:30:04] power of his resurrection the fellowship
[1:30:06] of his sufferings being made conformable
[1:30:08] unto his death if by any means somehow
[1:30:10] detained unto the resurrection of the
[1:30:11] dead he said my pharisaic law who i was
[1:30:14] being taught by gamalia being one of the
[1:30:16] smartest men in the world on the fast
[1:30:18] track to be the high priest he said that
[1:30:20] won't get me anywhere when it comes to
[1:30:22] change of the body
[1:30:25] not as though i had already attained
[1:30:27] either we're already perfect but i
[1:30:28] follow after let me say amen to this
[1:30:30] tonight
[1:30:31] that i may apprehend
[1:30:34] that for which i also am apprehended
[1:30:37] so he says i'm not just sitting there
[1:30:39] and believing in in in fatalism
[1:30:42] predestination is not fatalism
[1:30:46] there is a difference
[1:30:48] i'm going to apprehend
[1:30:50] that for which i am apprehended
[1:30:54] right so i'm pressing
[1:30:56] what he's already pressed for
[1:30:59] are you with me now the cross of christ
[1:31:01] makes me pick up my cross
[1:31:04] they say that the iranians
[1:31:06] have the highest level of accidents the
[1:31:08] most accidents in the world is in iran
[1:31:11] and the reason for that is because they
[1:31:12] believe allah wills all things
[1:31:15] and so they if they get in an accident a
[1:31:17] wreck and the daughter gets killed or
[1:31:18] someone gets killed
[1:31:20] allah wills it
[1:31:22] so it's fatalism
[1:31:24] so they don't even bother to drive
[1:31:25] carefully
[1:31:27] that's a fact
[1:31:30] they don't bother i see we don't live
[1:31:31] like that
[1:31:33] that i may apprehend
[1:31:37] i i take i persevere i press
[1:31:41] that for which also i am apprehended i
[1:31:44] couldn't apprehend unless i was already
[1:31:46] apprehended unless he had grabbed a hold
[1:31:48] of me i couldn't grab a hold of him to
[1:31:50] put it in arkansas language
[1:31:53] brethren i count not myself to have
[1:31:55] apprehended
[1:31:57] see i i may apprehend there's something
[1:31:59] more a body change
[1:32:02] a rapture
[1:32:03] he said but this one thing i do
[1:32:05] forgetting those things
[1:32:08] oh god
[1:32:09] forgetting who i was forgetting what i
[1:32:12] did
[1:32:14] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:32:16] and reaching forth under those things
[1:32:18] which are before i press toward the mark
[1:32:22] here he's using the imagery from the
[1:32:24] running from the races that he's seen as
[1:32:27] the last moment they would stretch out
[1:32:30] stretch out like a runner in baseball
[1:32:32] diving into the base
[1:32:34] i pressed toward the mark toward the
[1:32:36] finish line for the prize of the high
[1:32:38] calling of god in christ jesus
[1:32:40] let us therefore as many as be mature as
[1:32:43] be perfect be thus minded
[1:32:47] and if in anything you'd be otherwise
[1:32:49] minded
[1:32:50] god shall reveal even this
[1:32:52] unto you
[1:32:54] musicians go ahead and come we're to
[1:32:56] have no confidence in the flesh
[1:33:00] so we we press forward
[1:33:03] we keep under our body
[1:33:06] that's why paul can understand grace
[1:33:07] like nobody else can
[1:33:10] you get it
[1:33:12] you see it
[1:33:13] paul understands grace like nobody else
[1:33:16] because the re he has grace therefore he
[1:33:19] works
[1:33:22] god couldn't have called any other man
[1:33:24] but paul
[1:33:25] to preach the message of grace
[1:33:28] listen
[1:33:29] when paul told of his translation into
[1:33:32] the third heaven he also let us know
[1:33:33] that something in his body wasn't right
[1:33:34] we don't know what it was but the
[1:33:36] brandon said it was perhaps his eyes in
[1:33:37] other places he talked like it wasn't
[1:33:40] but we know he had bad eyes because he
[1:33:42] talks in galatians about how
[1:33:44] he has to write when he writes his own
[1:33:45] letters many times he dictated them but
[1:33:47] when he had to write his own letters he
[1:33:49] had to write in big letters
[1:33:51] because he couldn't see
[1:33:53] he had a thorn in the flesh
[1:33:56] he asked god three times to take it away
[1:33:59] and brother branham even dwells on that
[1:34:00] and says he you know he didn't just he
[1:34:02] didn't just say well it's the will of
[1:34:03] god he asked him to take it away
[1:34:06] and god gave him an answer he said to me
[1:34:08] my grace is sufficient for thee
[1:34:11] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:34:13] weakness can we say it this way my
[1:34:14] strength is made perfect in who who have
[1:34:16] made you to be
[1:34:19] and sometimes he allows us to be a
[1:34:20] little bit of ourselves
[1:34:24] are you hearing me
[1:34:26] he lets a little bit of that family tree
[1:34:28] creep through a little bit of that no no
[1:34:30] i'm not talking about sin now i'm just
[1:34:31] talking about just the way we were
[1:34:33] and that kind of creeps in and we think
[1:34:35] oh god
[1:34:37] that's not what i'm supposed to be
[1:34:39] but he wants to remind you who you are
[1:34:42] so that the glory won't rest on you but
[1:34:44] it'll rest on him
[1:34:46] he said most gladly therefore he said
[1:34:49] for my grace is sufficient for thee he
[1:34:51] said for my strength is made perfect in
[1:34:53] weakness
[1:34:54] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:34:56] glory in my infirmities so he said i'm
[1:34:59] going to boast about something
[1:35:01] not about being an apostle
[1:35:06] i love this
[1:35:08] he said i'm not going to boast about
[1:35:09] being an apostle
[1:35:10] or sitting under the feet of gamaliel
[1:35:13] or being he's not just a fact
[1:35:16] he didn't try to hide it it's just what
[1:35:18] his life was
[1:35:19] but i'm not going to boast about that
[1:35:22] what am i going to boast about
[1:35:24] my weaknesses
[1:35:27] but he wasn't out there saying oh i go
[1:35:29] down to the bar and drink on friday
[1:35:31] nights bless god i have grace in my life
[1:35:33] it's not what he's saying
[1:35:36] in spite of my eyes
[1:35:38] or whatever it was the thorn in the
[1:35:40] flesh in spite of my body in spite of
[1:35:43] being in prison in spite of being beaten
[1:35:47] i still bring the message
[1:35:49] in spite of people
[1:35:50] living a life in front of us that would
[1:35:52] turn us away from it
[1:35:54] but we will come anyway
[1:35:57] you're in church tonight anyway so you
[1:35:59] don't glory in your strengths
[1:36:01] in your gifts
[1:36:03] but in spite of how my headache
[1:36:06] i went to church
[1:36:09] are you hearing me in spite of my
[1:36:11] struggles in spite of my my bank account
[1:36:14] i still worship to god
[1:36:16] i will glory in my infirmities
[1:36:20] amen that the power of christ may rest
[1:36:24] upon me therefore i take pleasure
[1:36:26] what an attitude
[1:36:28] in infirmities and reproaches what did
[1:36:30] he do he looked at him and said you got
[1:36:31] a whip bring it on
[1:36:34] you're going to lead me for dead bring
[1:36:35] it on i take pleasure
[1:36:37] in the fact that they tried to kill me
[1:36:39] and couldn't
[1:36:41] i take pleasure in the fact that a snake
[1:36:43] bit me but i shook it off
[1:36:45] are you hearing me tonight
[1:36:47] you're gonna have to come back and
[1:36:48] listen to this again not because i said
[1:36:50] it but
[1:36:51] i know you're tired
[1:36:53] i take pleasure in the fact that i'm
[1:36:55] still here
[1:37:01] i take pleasure in necessities
[1:37:04] i wake up in the morning i have no idea
[1:37:06] where the bread's coming from today
[1:37:08] but i know he's a provider
[1:37:12] i wake up there's sickness in my body
[1:37:14] i'm in need
[1:37:15] but he's always met my needs
[1:37:18] some of you are getting older you know
[1:37:19] what i'm talking about
[1:37:21] lord i i'm rejoicing in the fact that i
[1:37:23] woke up this morning
[1:37:25] i don't feel good but i woke up
[1:37:28] and i still made my way to the side of
[1:37:29] the bed and got down on my knees and
[1:37:31] began to pray
[1:37:33] and i still came to church and i still
[1:37:35] as long as i'm able i still
[1:37:37] even though he was in jail he still
[1:37:39] managed to write the new testament
[1:37:44] when i'm weak
[1:37:46] then i'm strong
[1:37:49] and the message shalom brother branham
[1:37:50] calls that the growing pains of grace
[1:37:56] growing pains
[1:37:58] of grace
[1:38:00] would you bow your heads with me tonight
[1:38:03] i know i put a little bit too much on
[1:38:04] the plate tonight
[1:38:06] tried to feed too much hay to do a few
[1:38:08] cows
[1:38:11] but if you would just just think about
[1:38:13] what
[1:38:14] what the lord is trying to tell us
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:18] i'm not bound to be what my genes are
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:22] i'm gonna i can apprehend
[1:38:24] because i am apprehended
[1:38:28] i can i can become more than my
[1:38:30] limitations
[1:38:33] in spite of what the devil has done to
[1:38:35] me i'm still here
[1:38:38] i still love him
[1:38:39] still worshiping
[1:38:44] he's still my my first love
[1:38:49] he'll always be
[1:38:51] a glory in that because that means the
[1:38:52] power of god rests on me
[1:38:55] that's the grace of god
[1:38:57] by his grace i am what i am
[1:38:59] would you just think about that for a
[1:39:00] moment as we pray heavenly father
[1:39:04] maybe there's someone here the devil's
[1:39:06] tried to get at them in this way to
[1:39:09] try to make them think well the way i
[1:39:10] was raised and when i when i come
[1:39:12] through i i can't be a real christian i
[1:39:17] but paul stood there and said i i
[1:39:19] persecuted the church
[1:39:21] i didn't want to be saved
[1:39:24] but you saved me anyway lord
[1:39:28] i had no desire to serve you in this way
[1:39:30] lord
[1:39:32] but you came and supernaturally changed
[1:39:34] my life and put a desire there to make
[1:39:36] me press
[1:39:37] toward the mark
[1:39:41] so he said i'll rejoice in that
[1:39:44] oh god help us to do that tonight
[1:39:46] help us to rejoice in our infirmities i
[1:39:48] know it's difficult
[1:39:52] paul reminded them of that over and over
[1:39:53] again rejoice in all things again i say
[1:39:56] rejoice
[1:39:57] he said it's necessary for me to remind
[1:39:59] you
[1:40:01] it's good for you to be reminded
[1:40:04] rejoice in my infirmities because when
[1:40:06] i'm weak i'm strong
[1:40:09] because i'm still here still serving god
[1:40:11] i pray you'd help the people or those
[1:40:13] that are watching tonight those that are
