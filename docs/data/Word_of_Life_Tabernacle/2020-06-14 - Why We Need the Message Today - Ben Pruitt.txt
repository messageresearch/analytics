and if you're here Lord then everything will be okay I pray you grant it now and we thank you for all that you've done move me out of the way today and may you speak to your people we pray in Jesus name amen and God bless you you couldn't be seated for just a moment there's just a couple of things I want to go over before we get into the preaching this morning thank you for the music I enjoyed very much the music this morning it's good to have all of you here with us it's good to have both Tom and sister Nancy with us and it's been good to have you all with us over these this time that I've been here and I appreciate that and you're very much a part of the church family we want you to know that and and perhaps you'll be able to something will happen you'll be able to stay but if you do have to leave then we understand it and thank God if you have family clothes that you're able to fellowship with and be around you want to be close to your family and I know they do and and but we're family as well we'll continue to be wherever you live so we appreciate you guys we've been dealing with this coronavirus thing for months now and I know you're sick of hearing about it but but we've reached a place where as you can see we've taken the ropes off the pews and we're able to sit where we want to within reason and and things like that we've not moved out of the woods yet the state is still the cases are increasing and things like that but we've got to be a church we've got it there's some things we have to do to be a church and so we want to do those things and continue to wash your hands and stay safe and don't come to church if you're sick and that goes against everything I've ever done because I've always went to church sick but but if you're sick during this time it'd be best to stay home and and not spread that and and to stay safe and use the common sense that God gave us and we'll attempt to continue to do things in a common-sense way you've noticed that we we've not been passing the offering plate and it's not because we don't believe in taking offerings but it's just because it reduces the chance of spread and so it's back there in the back and you're welcome to use that and we will resume that at some point there's some things that are going to be coming up and I know that you're busy during the summer and so I want you to kind of keep these dates in mind so if you're going to be going and you can kind of keep these dates in mind that you can try to be here if you can but Andrew Glover will be with us on Wednesday and I apologize that it's on a Wednesday night but he's coming through the area he'll be with us on Wednesday June 24th so put that on your calendar but Andrew I know you love him and I love his ministry as well it love him and and he's a real friend and so we want him to come and then but Aaron McGarry is supposed to be here on the weekend of the 28th and that's in pencil we're not positive of that yet but just keep that date in mind as well so if we do if he does come we'll have two services that weekend along the 28th and depending of course on the circumstances with the coronavirus I'd like to begin having two services and would you pray with me about that but what we can do on Sundays and and you know I would I'd love to be in church all the time but I don't want to wear you out either and so we want to do the best we can to work together as a church towards that end so and then we haven't had communion in a long time and I've become convinced that we need to have a more regular communion of foot washing service it's been impossible to do during the pandemic we want to do that during the month of July and the weekend that looks like it would work for that because the first weekend of the month is a is a holiday weekend and some of you will be gone so we're going to try to do that on July 12th the Lord willing and again it's subject to all of these conditions with the coronavirus and things but we're going to try to have a communion and foot washing service on July 12th the Lord willing so keep that in mind because I know it's been a long time and and we want to do that to fulfill our expectation because he said do this until I come and so we want to continue to keep that that ordinance but the Darrell Ward is supposed to be here also in July on the 19th and he's got a trip planned for overseas he's probably not going to be able to go and so I've asked him to come here if he can't go overseas and so that would be on the 19th if we could it'd be nice by then if we could have a dinner during that time and so it'd be nice to try to do that on the 19th so these are things that are coming up and those dates again the 24th of this month for the Andrew Glover with Aaron McGarry on the 28th the Lord willing and then in July on the 90 on the 12th communion and then on the 19th the Lord willing but the Darrel will be here that weekend one more thing I'd had my heart to resume doing our study of first Corinthians but I didn't want to do that during our regular Wednesday night service I've been praying about doing that but the Caleb texted me the other day and asked if we could resume doing that and that meant a lot to me because I knew there was somebody that wanted to that took advantage of that and and so we want to try to do that I'm gonna try to do it on off night you don't have to be here but it'll be something that will be recorded and you'll be able to take advantage of that and I'd like to do that all the way through the scriptures we believe in the Bible we believe what the Bible says and so the Word of God is is our refuge in our strength and so we want to go to the word as much as possible learn as much as we can about the Word of God so I'll try to do that a couple of times a month I'm in the process of moving right now to Ashe flat to that area for the time being and so while we're doing that we want to take advantage or after we've done that we want to take advantage of the opportunities we have to do as much teaching as we can do you love the Lord this morning a man I know you've got about half of a but you welcome to ask me about it and and we'll remind you of these states as they're coming up let's stand together mmm Malachi chapter 4 I I want to take us back to the basics of our faith today and I want us to examine in our hearts as we're reading from Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 and also from Romans 1 verse 16 I want to examine why we believe what we believe and why we're here and my subject today is why we need the message today I didn't want to ask it as a question because it's not that I'd I'm questioning whether or not we need the message I want to tell you why we need the message and I want to remind us of that that this message is our life and it's what makes us different from from other churches and other places because we believe a message and we'll get into that today and I trust it'll be a blessing to you Malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord verse 6 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse Romans 1:16 a very familiar scripture says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek let's bow our heads one more time as we've talked for a while and just invite the presence of the Lord back with us Heavenly Father we thank you for being here with us today and asked you to come and anoint these words and move me out of the way so you can speak to your people this morning we pray in Jesus name Amen god bless you you could be seated this morning it's good to have you all with us this morning good to have my brother once again my mother here this morning as well and trust we'll be seeing more of them in the future there's a story that's told of a tool company that manufactured drill bits and they begin to lose money and as they were faced with these financial losses the company executives gathered together to discuss the problem and the CEO challenged the the executives of the company says how can we revive the bit market there was silence for a moment and finally one member of the team spoke up and he said there's not a market for bits there's a market for holes what people need is holes and they buy the bit to make the whole and it become a truism in business that the customer never buys a product but he buys the satisfaction of a watt or a need to put it another way there's no market for products there's only market for what products can do and you find that illustrated with the Xerox Corporation over the years and and different copy machine industry corporations what they've realized is that people don't want copy machines people want copies okay nobody's ever walk up in the morning and said I want a copy machine in my house I want a copy machine in my business they're in the way they're they're expensive they're annoying they make noise right but you need copies and so you have a copy machine because you want copies and we could we could take that you know as an analogy to other areas of our life and also to when it comes to the message of the hour and even to church and all of those things that it's not the building itself is that that we want we want a church because of what the church does we want we want to a message we need a message because there's a need for what the message does for us in our lives the message is not something that God sent to us on a whim that it would just be it would just be said to us and it be something that we could take it or leave it but it's something we desperately needed and some of you that come and it's easier to see if you come out of the world but even those of us are raised in the message as well there come a time in your life when become a desperation it wasn't just something that this is a nice new idea but I needed this message there's a hole in my life that needed to be filled there's a there's a wall there's a desperate need there and that need comes from somewhere it comes from God that and brother branham called it a deep calling to the deep it's something that they said if there's a deep calling then there's got to be a deep there to respond to that call and so something in your life cried out for the message of the hour something in your life was was calling for it and whether you were born in a message family or or you come to the message on your own you begin to look at it you begin to see I needed that it fills a need it's not disposable it's not just something I can believe today and then tomorrow there's some holes in it or some things I don't understand so I'll just leave it alone oh it's a it's a desperate longing that I have in my life I needed this message so much so that if it did not exist God would have to send it to me and we could ask the question does the need for the message still exist do you still need it do we still need it oh can we just go back to denominations can we go back to the world can we go back to what we were is there still something in us that cries out for the message of the hour is there still that longing that cries out mr. Lord I needed something to correct me I needed something to wash me I needed something that would have justified that is something that would tell me who I am so it's not just Irish or the message itself that we're looking at but it's that need for the message and so God sent a message to fill that need what is the message what are we talking about when we talk about the message the message is not a material object our place it's not a person but it is the revealed world of this hour the revealed word of this hour is the message of the hour and that revealed word comes to the prophet of Malachi for because the Bible tells us the word comes to the prophets sure the Lord God will do nothing except he says it by service he does it by servants the prophets and so we believe that the message come for that reason and now bill abarim talks about the message and he says notice he said it was not just to get together and talk about it but all the Jews come together and saying I'll tell you I tell you fellows you know I I believe that Moses is right because he said look we see God identifying himself with Moses because we see the pillar of fire we know what happens we know the identification that God has given Moses it's right you know he said we've got to have the blood in the door I believe that so you can believe all of that and you should believe all of that but that's not taking advantage of what the message offers right you can say I believe in copy machines I'm glad they're here I see what they do right but if you don't you have to have one in order to have copies and the cry of this age is photo capture the cry of this age is for a change of the body and something inside of us that just desires that we want that and so if there's something inside of us a deep calling for a rapture deep calling for a restoration that deep calling this message is what brings us through that 30-man so it's that calling that we have inside of us that actually called for the message of the hour very bad it actually produced a gulf knew you would need it and so by predestination he said it before you got here so that you would have it at the end time amen so now he said you can say I believe that we've got to have the blood of it all I believe that but you know after all I believe I'm just about as good as anybody really a covenant Jew I've been circumcised up in my offerings and ties into the congregation why even the priests I eat dinner with him well I'm just as good a man as the rest of you are he said that isn't what happened well not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message we can talk about it all day it's wonderful it fills a need there's all these things but we gotta get under it we gotta let that message come into our lives we were coming together to get in the message and the message is Christ he is the Lord that's right here source for the message of Christ he is the word he said we're to get into it get beneath it yes sir that's what we're supposed to do and I'm telling you this morning that needs still exist and I may seem very elementary but we need to be reminded of that because the devil's go do everything he can to make the message optional in your life and to make what a prophet tallest optional that it's just something can be taken or left but it's not optional it's something we have to we come under it's something that we surrendered to because not just because a prophet said but because we believe it's the Word of God right and so there was a need for the Israelites for protection what was that why was the land saying why was the Bogue put on the door it wasn't just because they wanted to redecorate their houses let's go down to Home Depot and buy some red paint put it on the door nose because God required it because there was a need the Death Angel was in her hand there was a death going on all over the land and in order to not die in order to be saved they had to have the message bear to hear Moses message and apply it it was there not just a sitting listen to it but they had to hear it and they had to apply it in the heart they had to apply put it over the top poster say this is mine I'm identifying with my family is under this message we're doing what a messenger said and when they did that they were free from that death and I'm here to tell you there's a virus and oil in today there's a death that is much worse than any coronavirus there's a death that's much worse than any kind of a of a sickness or anything they might have but there's a spiritual death for him today and we see it on every hand we on the faces of the people and we see it in denominationalism and I'm I'm not having those people but we see it in those systems that they've actually become that that woman that was walking in that brother beheld a saw in the vision that she was walking naked in front and then throw rock and roll beating going down into hell and we see the churches doing that today we see them actually fulfilling that vision and we see darkness and honey we see death and O'Haire and we see that the message of the hour brings us to a place where we don't have to die brings us to the place where not only do we not have to die but we can live and our bodies can be changed at a moment in a twinkling of an eye it brings us to the possibility and the potential for the rapture they needed it it was an optional who I can do it or maybe I just won't maybe I'll put it off no apply the token see this message we need it because it brings restoration Matthew 17 and 11 says jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall first come and restore all things the early church fathers after the time of the other early church of Peter and Paul then as it went on down that there was taught and they understood the words of Christ meant that there would be another coming of Elijah understood in the early church in fact there's a man by the name of Albert Barnes you may or may not be able to read that but Albert Barnes was a Presbyterian theologian from the 1700s in this country and Albert Barnes when he did his commentary he goes through a long list of the people who believed that Elijah would come again it was understood and believed in the early church that this would take place that this was not just it's not something I am telling you this because the need for restoration was understood so they looked at this and said there going to be an Elijah come to restore all things and so this is Louie Albert Barnes puts it he said he implies the coming of Elijah other than that of John the immerser John the Baptist since he was already martyred all things were not yet restored he said this must also be the fullest fulfillment for the great and terrible day of the Lord is the day of judgment of which all earthly judgments however desolating is the destruction of Jerusalem are but shadows and Ernests so he understood he said before Lord's coming all things return to his first coming since that coming whole it's on to the second which is the completion of the first and of all things in time our Lord's words Elias truth shall first come and restore all things Albert Barnes speaking it seemed to me to leave no question that as John the immerser came in the spirit and power of Elias before his first coming so before the second coming Elijah should come in person as Jews and Christians have a like expected now they believed would actually be Elijah and they believed he would come at the end and they didn't see that the difference that and and the the Tribulation Period in those things but the understood he had to come so they didn't see a difference between a fourth and a fifth Elijah but they knew he had to come right and so now they said he said this has been the Christian expectation from the first he quotes a man named Justin Martyr who was an early church father and one of the one of the early apologists in the church after the time of the Apostles and he asks someone he was debating with he said should we not conceive that the Lord of God has proclaimed Elias to be the forerunner of the great and terrible day of the second coming certainly was his opponents replied Justin continues our Lord Himself taught us in his own teaching that this very thing should be when he said that Elias also shall come and we know that this shall be fulfilled when he is about to come from heaven and glory I say amen to that they understood Elijah needed to come and and it wasn't just limited to them but even in by the rams town people the church understood that and today they're not looking for anything because the church has just become a a place where you go to feel good right but but back then these people understood Elijah had to come we can say like Jesus said of John except Elias has come already and we can say like Jesus that have joined that Elijah's come already and they did too and what they did to John they rejected him and but yet there's a group that believed and a group that was corrected by his message to Christ right now he needed to come to restore all things and that word restoration is to bring back to a former original or normal condition as the building statue or painting so we find that the church today as that exists in in the nominal Church is not the normal condition of the church and we shouldn't look to that as our example so we needed somebody to come to bring us back to what the church ought to be that normal condition bring us back to the original condition of the statue the original condition of God's masterpiece so then we could begin to think and ought you to think with me this morning as we begin to wonder what it would be like if the message should not come there's an old movie called It's a Wonderful Life and I'm sure you've seen it and the entire movie is most of you perhaps the entire movie is about a man named George Bailey who begins to despair of his life and thinks he hasn't done enough and so he goes out to commit suicide jump off a bridge and an angel comes to him named Clarence of course it's Hollywood but it comes to him and begins to tell him about out what is life or what life in that town would be without George Bailey what it would be like and I want us to think like that about this message if this message had never been if God had never sent a prophet what condition would we be in today and it goes beyond our it goes beyond just us today and having a church core structures like this wouldn't exist because we exist because of the message right and there's no two ways around that we're here we exist because of the message of the hour and so churches like this wouldn't exist of course but there were also have been no healing revived as far as we know in in the 40s there would have been no old Roberts Tommy Hicks jack code took their inspiration from brother Ramblers meetings I think we could save that the charismatic church that we see today TBN wouldn't exist the charismatic church and when we know that they don't accept the message but that's where it all spun from those revivals and so the Pentecostal church as the world knows that today wouldn't exist and there would be no church on the earth now think about this that teachers all of the things commonly known and understood and practiced at the time of the early church and those of you have been to different churches you could go and you could find a different kind of church and you can find one that teaches this about a certain thing that we teach it would be right but there's other things that you couldn't you couldn't sit there with and you can find another one to teach of something else but and maybe one of the teachers who oneness of the Godhead but another one that teaches a different thing that and but maybe this one doesn't teach election and you find in the church today as far as the churches that I've been to in the churches that I've studied there's no church that teaches what we do and I said what we do in the major doctrines of this message because there's a reason for that they didn't accept the Prophet we did right and so here these churches teach you know one might teach the oneness of the Godhead but they're not teach election and I don't know that just right there pretty much excludes everybody because I don't know of a single church that teaches the oneness with the Guardian and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but also election right and so you would have someone believe in holiness but have no grace some will believe in grace but have no holiness we could take something as we talked this morning about communion when you take something as simple as communion and foot washing you just try to find a church that does both right and that would have been practiced in the early church but but since then has been taken away from the church and not just in the early church but would have been practiced 100 years ago in most churches but but not today and so you think where does that come from we the communion the majority of churches today serve grape juice and crackers it don't seem like a big thing but the early church if you transported them transplanted them back to this day or up to this day and put them here they wouldn't know what to do in most churches I think about it though it would just be no don't be no familiarity to them because they were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we've just proven my history that's what they did baptize the name of Jesus Christ and very few churches do that today and so as I said they deny the other doctrine for the early church election was a big deal back then and to the early church fathers they called themselves the elect the press they understood that but the church today doesn't understand that in large part we could go on we could say talk about holiest and there's no women preachers things like that the early church I believe would be comfortable although the times are different different kind of building things like that but they would be comfortable sitting in a message church that operated under the basics of the message but they wouldn't be comfortable sitting in a nominal church then I ask you do we need a message did we need a message if there's no need for a message then we would just continue like they were and there will be no restoration back and people are looking for something else and something to come and you know if you don't believe you have been restored then Elijah has to come right and so we believe in ideas already come now if you believe in logic aim but he didn't do everything he was supposed to do that you believe Elijah hasn't finished his job which means you're still looking for coming of Elijah and what we have isn't anything because everything could change right but we believe we have a complete revelation and it's not and people get into this word you ought to take every word and parser to know it's the doctrine and the teaching that brother impalas is a perfect revelation of Christ the things that he taught us and God corrected him on some things there's a maturing of the revelation time goes on but we can look at the totality of it and see what God was teaching to us what he was telling us it's so simple that a fool sitting there there in that's right but yet people don't understand because they don't have revelation but they're looking for Elijah to come back well I would say if you don't believe he's done his job you should be looking for him to come back but I will tell you Elijah has already been here just based on what we see today that God can work in a church like ours in a church like this and do what he said he would do are you with me so far God did in so we could say like Peter didn't John 668 that Simon Peter answered him and said Lord who shall we go well what other teacher can we go to the teaches us the things about eternal life where did we go and find what we have need of now where did we go thou hast the words of eternal life and God sent this worthless message was not but a man was message it was God's message that he sent by William Branham now you can't separate brother Branham from the message because he's that's who God sent it by so if you don't accept that messenger you never received the message but he was just the messenger right and so there you have to keep that in mind it's it's the message of Christ he told us the message is Christ so but a man taught us that and so we see that we need the message for restoration and we need this message today not only for restoration but because at the end time there is promise to be certain revelation that would be given to us so if you believe we're in the end time I think the probably the biggest obstacle to accepting this message would be if you didn't believe we were at the end time but you can talk to just about anybody but a JT in the store that sees what's going on and they think we're at the end time if they have any Bible knowledge at all they understand that this is this getting close to the end time we're getting close and so and so but you have to kind of accept that to believe the message you have to believe that we're at the end time but if you just look at history that enough should teach it's just the view of history that were at the end time it just can't go on like it is and so we find what at the end time in believing that then the Bible promises that there would be revelation and and things that would be unsealed at the end time so that we could see it right it'd be unveiled in film Daniel twelve and four he said but Thou O Daniel shut up the words seal the book even that to the time of the end he said many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased but see he said sealed up to the time of the end no Matthew Henry said this about this verse he said truth is the daughter of time truth is the daughter of time so God brings truth with time at the right time right truth is the daughter of time scripture prophecies will be expounded by the accomplishment of them therefore they are given and that's for that reason they were reserved there told us before that when they do come to pass when they believe but there told us in mystery form so that we can when it comes to pass only the wise will see right but now how would God get that mystery to us Daniel 2 / 9 again he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time at the end right till the time of him many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked should do wickedly none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand the words are closed up the prophecy should not be understood but in its accomplishment and this is Adam Clarke speaking he said the prophecy should not be understood but in its accomplishment and then the depth of the wisdom and Providence of God will be clearly seen in these matters he said we must wait till the time of the end and and he actually takes it and did some calculations based on numbers in the book of Daniel which I don't agree with his calculations but I agree with his conclusion he said will not arrive before the 20th century and he's writing that in the in the 17th century in the 18th century and he's writing at the end of the 17th century at beginning I believe in the 18th century and he's writing these things and says it won't be until the 20th century but now we see the end times he said we here see the reason why these prophecies are at present so imperfectly understood so he's saying it's not time for it yet but it will come a time it'll be understood the audience understood that ministers understood that and in Revelations 10 4 the Bible tells us when the seven thunders about as their voices I was about to ride and heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders either write them not the angel chimed so stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swore by him that liveth for ever and ever who created the heavens and the things that therein are earth and the things that there are all in the sea the things which are therein that there should be time no longer you can't call us that were in the end time any more than that me John Logan or more delay if you look in the margin but he said but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets so here he says there'll be a mystery sealed up to the end time and here he says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God will be finished so and he said as he has declared to his servants the prophets so if it come by a prophet it also need to be revealed by a prophet and so if you look at the scripture honestly if we don't believe in this prophet we have to look for another one right and the reason why people look for another one even around the message is because they don't believe this one because if you believe this one you will know it for another remember what when when I like it when the Elijah that day when John's Eagle I got filmed over he got put in prison and Matthew 11 2 says when John had heard the prison the works of Christ he said to his disciples and said unto Him art thou either should come or do we look for another prophet do we look for another message do we look for another Christ he said either should come until we look for another jesus answered and said unto me go and show John again those things which you do here and see hey man look what the message does amen see if it meets the lead amen he said the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the Deaf hear the dead are raised up the poor but the gospel preached thundered him you said well I've never seen that well I have because I can identify with all those things I've been spiritually deaf I've been spiritually dead I've been poor in the spiritual and the natural and the gospel was preached to me amen by they needed cleanse from sin I've been those things and the gospel is preached to me he said him blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me that's to the scene whose service should not be offended in me so god seated up the mystery until the time of the end and then we have to say is this him or if not we should be getting ready for another I stay this morning he's met the need of my life and when I say he I mean Jesus Christ our Lord has met the need by providing a message through a messenger in our time now we find that an example of this if you if you're still wondering about whether God those things this way look what God did with the mystery of grace to the Gentiles he sealed it up for thousands of years for four thousand years this was sealed up it was there but they didn't understand it well look at that and I say 11:10 it says in that day there shall be a root of Jesse would stand for an inside of the people to it shall the Gentiles seek and the read and read his rest shall be glorious none of seems pretty plain to us we know what that means because we're Gentiles seeking that root of Jesse right but to someone to a Jew or to someone who lived before the opening of this if we could save this seal that's understanding that's this mystery before the opening of this they didn't understand it wasn't common knowledge that the gospel would go to the Gentiles and in fact many even in the in the Jewish church and they that accepted Christ couldn't accept this mystery but ball believed it because it was given to him it was revealed to him hey man now Isaiah 66 19 again it was written he said I will set aside among them I will send those that escape with him into the unto the nations to Tarshish Pro and Lord to draw the boat to to Baal and Javan to the Isles of far off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles isaiah 42:1 behold my servant whom i pulled my elect and whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles but but it was a mystery and we look back and say pastor it should have been playing to them but they didn't understand because it took God's man the Apostle Paul to bring it out to him it took that messenger to bring that because it wasn't time yet but when it was time God called a man to bring the message some else in in Matthew the early church understood that had been fulfilled in Matthew 1217 Matthew writes he said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying behold my servant whom I've chosen my beloved whom my soul is well pleased I will put my spirit upon him he showed so judgment to the Gentiles he shall not strive nor crying neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets bruised Reed shall he not break smoking flax shall he not quench till he sent forth judgment unto victory and in his name shall the Gentiles trust you can also go into Jeremiah in different places but there's one more place in Isaiah in Isaiah 49 6 he said it is a light thing that thou should have to be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved of Israel I will also give me for a light to the Gentiles and and the Jews understood this was speaking of the Messiah but he said I will also give me for a light to the Gentiles that that must be my salvation unto the end of the earth now this is again evident now but only because the mystery was revealed Paul does that in Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 1 he said for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you word so Paul is saying God trusted me with this mystery with the understanding of it how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote afore in C words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it has now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be fellow hairs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel he said this was hid but God revealed it to me so why do we think it's strange that something was hid and revealed at the end time without this message we don't understand what the book says about the end and without this message were troubled and the flowing people don't understand the message correctly and they don't it's not taught correctly what they do is they get worried to get fearful because they see everything happening and they don't understand it but we understand we understand at the end the wise letter said what do we understand we understand that God sent us a message to get ready so we know these things we know it's getting worse and worse the church is still looking for worldwide revival but we know better we know that the coming of the Lord is near without this message we don't understand that because the book is still sealed oh my we can only understand that the book is open which means that we can have an understanding of who you are and what time we live in let me say this as well that we need this message today because it makes Christ real to our generation we're not just preaching a Christ of history we're not just preaching a God of two thousand years ago but we're preaching Christ today and it's just as dangerous and excuse me for a moment but if you're going to take a crisis of history if you only preach a message of history then that's just as dangerous as only preaching a crisis of history the message that we received is still alive today the messages of life the message Joe does what it does and these things that we've been taught are important it's not one it's not that well we can leave that off and we'll just sleep no we believe what we've been taught with an understanding we understand that it was not another scripture another Bible but it was God interpreting his word bringing it to pass and showing it at the end time and showing us that he was real that he is real and so we don't do what we do in spite of the message we do what we do because of the message and as a pastor and I want you to understand this as we go into these at this time as we're just beginning I want us to understand that everything I do I have to do it under the umbrella of the message I can't go outside the boundary of that I don't have that authority because I believe God sent a message no more than Luther had the authority to go outside of the boundary of his message of justification or Wesley his message and those who were faithfully taught taught what they thought but brother Brown said me were not me many did not understand how important it was to say what the messenger said and we were saying that it's not that is important so much too to repeat the words that he repeated but to convey the message to convey the message so that order remained in the formulas given in the spirit of it in the power of it in the in the image of the fullness of it it would remain to our generation and so you can say well we can take the words of it but you could take a translation of English you take a translation of this sermon today put it in French and it might mean something a little different but if I could ever make someone who was French I hope you listening to me now I understand what I'm saying if I could ever get across to them the mystery of what I'm saying that person could teach those who understood eeeh oh my and if I could ever what God needs on the surface not just people who can we want to say what the Prophet said but not just to repeat the words but to understand what he understood in the sense and I believe he made it plain to us he didn't leave it in mystery form and of course something left to mystery it's something that we didn't need to know and so those things we still don't understand that are written there we had we start to come to an understanding we don't put a period on what we believe what we understand we believe there's still mystery to us but not mystery to the prophet of the age and and even it might have been spoken in the mystery form and we see it come to pass right we can see that we can identify that but it's still this message okay so we need this message today because it makes Christ's real it puts to our generation I have confidence as we preached on Wednesday night I have confidence because God sent a prophet that spoke in my generation have confidence that what he said was true and then God identified him with the sign of the Son of Man which will look at God identified him as the prophet of the age and identified not only that but identified his own presence with us if he identified himself present with us then I believe he's still here today and so I preached under those auspices now under my own authority but under the message and if I failed to believe the message you know why did I keep pastoring why would I keep preaching because this is all I know to preach are you with me now and not because I just don't understand anything else but because this is truth to me and it's truth because it's made real in my life so in Luke 17 to 28 he says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Sun manus revealed it's revealed that is to say is present all along and this is from the pulpit commentary and and I'm bringing these Saints today from these commentaries and things to show you that this was understood this need was understood but they didn't see who did it they didn't see that the message did it because I hadn't come yet but they saw that there was one needed so now he says he's been present all along to the wrong age of the waiting only an impenetrable veil has hid him for more lives but there comes a day when the Son of Man is revealed and but the random goes back always to Abraham and Sarah and how of it when the angel come to them he knew the secret of satis heart and the tip behind it and that was stand in our generation for the first time that in 2,000 years that we know of it was done in our generation look and so that proved who he want us to prove that that God was in the flesh on the earth and now we find that God is in flesh today on the earth proved it he was in the flesh of a prophet he's in the flesh today of a ride in a measure you understand none of us are the fullness of God the Godhead but we have Christ in a measure but Christ is in flesh now and he was in a measure in his prophet but he come and proved himself to be there now what did he do when he revealed himself to Abraham he knew the secret of Sarah's heart when he was revealed to the Jesus he knew the secret of Philip and Nathanael knew the secret of Peter was nameless was father was when he was revealed to the Samaritans he knew how many husbands the woman at the wall had and when he was revealed in our day he knew people's house numbers and where they come from what their sickness was the same God now look the man said the presence of Jesus Christ which ought to illuminate the church to know that in this last case were Creed's and denominations and isms and everything has got the word smothered out and Jesus the word on the outside of the church and you seen him come right back among the people and identify himself as promised yes he promised in the last day when the Son of Man is being revealed he was revealed in the baptism he was revealed in divine healing here he is in his last attribute he said remember that was the last thing that Abraham saw before the fire fell and judge the Gentile wall and before the promised son came on the scene Isaac this is the last thing that the Christian Church will see in the sign of miracle until the appearing of Jesus Christ I hope you with me now again we're not looking for earth-shaking science we believe in miracles we're not looking for miracles and science to shake the earth God already did that he'll do that again to the Jews but that's not promised our generation brother Brown is very clear about that he said this is the last thing the Christian Church will see in the sign of miracle until the appearing of Jesus Christ if God has give me a favor before you he said believe me in the name of the Lord there's nothing else left in the Bible to be done but take on the mark of the beast he said but and you have the seal of God amen and so you sit there on do you get worried people worry about that what's the mark of the beast right now I'm afraid they're gonna put a chip in my hand they're gonna tattoo me they're gonna do something like that no you don't have to be afraid why because you're the seal of God the antidote to not taking the mark of the beast is not to refuse the vaccination or refuse a number or something like that but but it's to have the seal of God and if you have the seal of God you'll know what to accept or what to refuse you won't accept the teaching of the church or you won't accept to do the deeds of the Church of the Catholic Church or the the nominal church but you'll you refuse to take the mark of the beast because you have the seal of God why because God made himself president our day hey man but Jesus said when the Son of Man is revealed from heaven but the brown says let me close by saying this that the Son of Man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother branham it is now and I hope I won't have to make this so personal instead of this own meeting but that your spirit within you this give you by God can read what I'm talking about the Son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years just search in mercy and the reason why I needed this message was and the reason why it had to become real to me but cannabis because I needed mercy you needed mercy you needed God to pour out his mercy on a generation that's lost God has forgot about God that doesn't understand God we need God's mercy we need God's mercy so our homes could be right we needed God's mercy so our churches can be right we need God's mercy so that we can have what we have I don't preachers fighter the message I preached because a prophet told me to do what I do and the reason why my prophet told me that was the mercy of God the mercy of God that allows us to have church like we do it's some mercies of God that he sent a message and didn't just leave us in dead denominations he has come now in mercy revealing himself to his church amen it's being laughed at and scoffed at is it today be laughed at all over the world stuff to him but Jesus was laughed at he was scoffed at when he was here the bride will be rejected as well the masterpiece has got to be rejected he said the next time he reveals himself it'll be in judgment on the world and the nations have forgot God and sinned the way of grace they're damned grace away listen he revealed himself to us and mercy he will reveal himself to them in judgment we got a sneak peek because we got he showed himself to us so that we could see who he was so that we could see still here so we didn't get caught up in this world which is revolving into chaos and evolving as it does down into hell he says the next time he reveals himself it'll be in judgment on the world and the Nations has forgot God send away their day of grace because they have forgotten God and they're doing the same thing that they did to the angel of the Lord back there mocking and making fun of it but he's here now in mercy look we understand that today it's not up to me as well I just I've done so much now I just can't believe the message anymore because I know he revealed himself at mercy if there's any mercy to you it all comes from this message he said my life's been messed up I've been married two three times I've had all these problems but if he didn't come in this message to show you what the truth was that was mercy to you that was Christ he wanted to show you what you've done wrong and pound you over the head with it but it was grace to you it was great to me your sister just a certain way you think well I just can't keep doing that it just it's not in my heart listen it was mercy if you ever really understand it was Marcy was Christ here by heart today Church I want you to hear my heart God deals with the heart he doesn't do what the head he deals with the heart in my heart today we need this message God still needs preachers preaching this message why because that's what a prophet restored to us he will come in judgment upon the nation's and while he's being revealed in mercy while he's being revealed in my fury he says hurry hither run quickly children get away from these man-made Babylonian theological walls of unbelief and cold formalism run away from man-made theology get out in the middle of the field in cost grace over here in the middle of the field and away from this get away from me hey men the man who says he looked at me like if a man had any kind of spirituality about him of the Spirit of God in him when he's seen the Lord Jesus - just what he said he would do it would throw this heart in such a way that he couldn't hold his peace any longer you wanna know why I preach this why a man he said that you threw his heart in such a way when he seen God do what he said he would do he would throw his heart in such a way that he couldn't hold his peace in your hunger he would set the nation of fire with the message he said as it was in them days so will it be the message went forth and they merely laughed and mocked devil if someone who was telling some kind of an idle tale and that's what they do today when we tell them God said prophet God sent a messenger and God has a message today God has a people God has a bride they laugh at it they make relevant they called it some kind of an idle tale but it was a mercy and it was a grace it was a deliverance said did you notice what the angel said I can't do nothing do you come here there what was it it was a message of deliverance before one speck of fire could fall from heaven a lot had to get out of Sodom before one drop of rain fell from heaven Noah when is the art but the robber says it this way in crashes the mystery of God revealed he said before they shut us up we'll go up before one gospel fell from heaven Noah know the art before the atom bomb can strike this nation the church will go in the rapture to meet the Lord Jesus and if the sputnik's and the missiles were sent and the hammers will pull back the Angels are all standing in order the great corridors of heaven is crowded full the hopes are all in tune the great bands already practiced up there's a homecoming time pretty soon for the Church of the Living God he's been waiting is coming everything is in order I'm so glad he said I'm getting so tired oh for that great hour in the body of Christ the church in this time the Bride of Christ during this Junction time remember so shall it be in the coming of the Son of man when the Son of Man is being revealed from heaven brother branham take sent it to a different place then the world takes it because they take it to the Sodom condition and whether Brown does talk about that but he takes it beyond the Sodom condition he said during that time the secrets of the hearts were being revealed to a elect group and we get discouraged when we just look out at the Sodom condition as I said anybody can tell us the end time looking at the Sodom condition but if you could only look and see what God did he said but God did that 50 years ago 60 years ago yes he did but he's doing it today you don't have to send that prophet again to discern the hearts but the Lord is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I have confidence that if I preach this message that people will be saved I have confidence when I preach this message the bride will be healed probably free the bride will come to their place why because this message is what I needed and it's what you needed it met the need that was called for in this hour they bed there was materials hidden in the earth for thousands of years nobody found a use for but then all of a sudden they begin to make devices that required certain materials and when they did all the sudden they needed that and it becomes valuable what was worthless become valuable why because it was needed during our time and the things written in the scripture the theologians thought might have been worthless God and this time brought them why we needed so I function and device in this time to be able to connect to heaven the son of man when that day when the Son of Man has been revealed from heaven that's will be like the days of lot that's a day that we live in we have the message but it's not enough just to hear it even to realize that you need it you could go I've been lately every time I go in a store saying I need a riding lawnmower and Peter has been reminding me every day I don't want a riding lawnmower I'll get my own lawnmower I'm just saying this the he Peter's been remind me that cuz he's the one that's the Mohawk the time or more as you can say as you can see I don't know much but we have a big yard now and a big yard where we're moving and so Peters he's getting concerned about that he's saying Debbie that'll take me all for months and it'll Harvey yard looks so good here he'd been mowing the yard and I thank you for that but the Harvey but you've been helping us out doing that and I told Peter I said well you could help with Harvey come up here mow and he just about died because he's got to push him over but it's self-propelled when I was a kid I didn't have us help propel push mower it's self-propelled forgive me for picking on you this morning beater bit but you know he's getting anxious every time we go in the store we need to look at the riding lawnmowers but it doesn't do me any good unless I buy it we can talk about it we can acknowledge our need for it but until I buy it he's got a push are you with me now you can talk about the message you can acknowledge your need for it you can say I did would really help my family to be in a church and to be believed the message in and to have all these things that to have the church said in order would really help but don't do any good unless you take advantage of it it doesn't do you a bit of good to empathize with it or sympathize with it unless you're willing to come under it and no matter what happens in your life to say lord I messed up but I'm coming under your message I'm coming under the word if I have to repent whatever I have to do I'm coming under the word and then we have fellowship under that word under that blood hey man let's bow our heads together this message is a message of mercy if you haven't responded to that message of mercy would you do that today would you do that today I believe it takes a moment's time if you haven't really dedicated yourself to the message and come under that token really let your life be cleansed by the Holy Spirit would you just do that today would you start that journey you've never been baptized would be glad to do that for you if you've not responded would you do that if you have if you have responded would you just take a moment this morning and recognize what the message means to your life too many times we look at it and we present it to our children as a hindrance to our lives oh we can't do that because the message says that we can't we can't do that because brother branham said no we we believe the Word of God was revealed in our day we don't do those things because we believe we want to please God we love him with all of her heart we believe that it wasn't just because brother Branham said it but because God revealed it to our age through a prophet would you just talk to the Lord for a moment if you've never received the token never really believed you never had that change of life or if you've never if you just lightly haven't thought about what the message does for you would you do that bring yourself under that token make sure that the token is on display in your life I'll bless you for that Heavenly Father we thank you for your word today Lord Jesus how we needed this message or now is raid bad about about how this message was the message of mercy just made me want to run all over the church because I realized sword that I couldn't make it without your mercy without your blood and because of what you did on the cross because of what you've done in our day I fought by completing that redemption by opening the book to us with Lord we wait for the fulfillment of it in our bodies Lord has been our souls in the hell a seal of God we thank you for it we ask you Lord that we would we would change our thoughts Lord perhaps about this message of what it means to us we we are not ashamed of this message we believe in the right way sometimes we get ashamed of those who misuse it who abuser to make a cult out of it but Lord we we were sent a message for a reason and of course the devil would try to come and try to make something out of it that it's not Lord we want to stay right in the middle of your grace let others do what they want to hard but as a church we want to stay away from those denominational walls let's stay right in the middle of your grace help us Lord help me Lord to stay right where I should be Oh God help me not to get to the place where I become what I despise what a hey Lord you really dealt with me about that Oh God help us Lord that we could remain in the middle where we can be God's mercy we could be a source of mercy because we believe this message because we've been changed by it I don't know just to believe it or just to acknowledge it but to be changed by if we really believe we'll accept it will come under it will be changed by it I pray you grant it now you sent this message because there was a predestinated seed that could receive it or we're thankful that we have that seed within us to receive it and we know that there are others we pray lord you'd help us reach that last seed so we can go home thank you for all you do in Jesus name on this day this glory stay just to get together there's never been a day while stand together there's never been a day you need prayer the altars open this morning like this day I'm
