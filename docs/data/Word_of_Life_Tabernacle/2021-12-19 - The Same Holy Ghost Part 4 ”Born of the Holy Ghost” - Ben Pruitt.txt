and we're so thankful for that and um glad i say a whole bunch compared to how many adults there are there's a whole bunch of children so we're we're happy to have them matthew chapter 1 and verse 18 no service on wednesday night as well as you spend time with your families this week now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privately while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost i want to tell you this this morning as we think about these things what has been conceived in your life even if you've just been saved you've just given your heart to the lord maybe you have a long ways to go to experience the full birth of the word and and to receive the baptism of the holy ghost but let me tell you this that which is conceived in you is of the holy ghost amen amen god bless you today you may be seated someone wrote this i thought it was good the people of that time that first christmas time were being heavily taxed faced every prospect of a sharp increase to cover expanding military expenses they had a threat of world domination by a cruel ungodly power intoxicated band of men it was at just below the threshold of consciousness moral deterioration had corrupted the upper levels of society and was moving rapidly into the broad base of the population intense nationalistic feeling was clashing openly with new forms of imperialism conformity was the spirit of the age government handouts were being used with increasing lavishness to keep the population from rising up and throwing out the leaders interest rates were spiraling upward in the midst of an inflated economy external religious observance were considered a political asset abnormal emphasis was being placed upon sports and athletic competition racial tensions were at the breaking point but it was in such a time and amid such a people what sounds like today doesn't it it was in such a time and amid such a people that a child was born to a migrant couple who had just signed up for a fresh round of taxation and who were soon to become political exiles and the child who was born was called among other things emmanuel god with us you see as we look at this time of the year and we see people talking about a baby in a manger but him being there was not an impulsive act of a god who was scrambling to find a way to somehow fix the world that had broken but it was actually before there was ever a sin before there had ever been a fall before there had ever been a reality of being away from the presence of god or before even anything was created god already knew how he would become flesh he had already planned in fact the bible tells us that he was crucified before the foundation of the earth and so god had created in his own mind himself a body for the purpose of redemption and fellowship and so brother branham says this about it he said today when they try to make him just a philosopher or a teacher he said it just boils me well that boils me to day two that gets my temperature up when i try to make him just a philosopher or a teacher he was emmanuel hallelujah god created himself a body a son amen and came down and dwelt in that body god in christ amen he was the bible tells us in revelation 3 and 14 the beginning of the creation of god he is the beginning of the creation of god but the bible also says in ephesians ephesians 2 and 10 we are his workmanship don't get down on yourself for the way you're made up and especially as you've received the holy ghost and you come to the house of god many times we get down on ourselves and you say well i wish i could be like so and so i wish i could be more like a brother so and so he seems to be so spiritual see we are his workmanship really what you're doing if you claim to have the baptism of the holy ghost and you claim that he's working in your life you're really down on him because the bible says we are a new creation i know that there's still a sticky nature on the outside and many of the things that were passed on to us from our from our family still represents itself in that sticky nature but if you have the holy ghost this morning and i trust that you do there is a controlling tower on the inside there's something on the inside that overrides that thing to the effect that we never have to give in we don't ever have to give up we don't ever have to let the flesh dictate to the spirit what our lives are going to be amen so don't get down on yourself quit making excuses because of your sticky nature because there's something on the inside that overrides that a creation a new creation of god we are his workmanship created in christ jesus can you imagine a man walking into a shop and here the the artist has placed all of his sculptures on display and you walk in there and you just start to criticize them you begin to look down on them and you begin to say well that that he's not much of an artist what are you doing when you when you put down the art you're putting down the artist i hope you're hearing me today when you talk about the art you're talking about the artist when you run your mouth about the art you are running your mouth about the artist quit spending all your time looking around and seeing how bad god's workmanship is and let him begin to work on your life are you with me this morning god we are his workmanship he we are created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them amen now how did god create i want to look at that that this morning the bible says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period and then in verse 2 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved we could say the holy ghost brother branham calls it the anointing the logos the light the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters and god said let there be light and there was light now you'll find in that word moved and i've brought this to you before but i want to remind you of it today that in deuteronomy 32 and 11 where it says as an eagle stirs up her nest uttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh and beareth him on her wings that word fluttereth is the same word that's in genesis 1 2 has moved moved it's actually moving in the nest fluttering in the nest i got to looking at that and i began to look at the the tactics that eagles use to keep their young to bring them to a birth and actually what they do you know the little eagle he's an eagle to begin with but the mother eagle and the father eagle have to take care of him to cause him to come to a birth if he's left by himself he'll never come to a birth you just think about that and say there had to be an eagle created at some point to bring the rest of the eagles to the birth amen well that's just the way it is spiritually as well but here now the mother and the father eagle build a nest and and they and the mother lays the eggs there in the nest usually too and they'll lay them there in the in the nest and actually they there is a constant movement in the nest it's not as still as what we think it is they actually keep it at a temperature of about 105 degrees fahrenheit and and they have to keep it hot and even and this just really struck me even the eagle will will pluck out its own feathers until there's a bare spot on its breast it's called a brood patch because what it does is trying to get the egg closer to the oh my to the internal heat of the mama eagle don't you realize that god plucked out his own feathers came down among human beings that that were little little lonely little eggs so didn't even know anything about him he come down among us so the heat of god's presence would be closer to us so he could brood over us or aren't you glad he did that for you amen and so here they actually what i want to emphasize this morning is that there's movement in the nest that it's not just a still place with heat but there's movement every two hours the eagle will take the egg and we're actually being careful not to puncture the fragile walls of the egg it'll actually turn it every two hours because otherwise the the embryo would actually stick to the side of the egg or it would not it would be cold on one side and hot on the other and you realize sometimes you think well why is what's happening why is it happening in my life why am i going through what i'm going through when you're just being turned in the nest right you're just being turned in the nest you say well brother ben i have the holy ghost i'm i'm a foreborn christian but you still have that sticky nature you still are living a body of flesh you still have to struggle with this flesh we are in one sense we we are saved we have been saved or already at calvary we are we were saved before the foundation of the earth for that matter we are being saved that we have been saved we are being saved and we will be saved because one day this body is going to be changed right and that's the fullness of adoption in our bodies is going to come to fruition at some point but you find then that that well you're in the nest and you begin to while we're in this world we we begin to feel movement and we think well if if god would just leave me alone for a while if he would just allow me to sit back and i could heal i could i could i could learn i could do something no he wants movement because he realizes that as you're going through life if you don't have some movement you're actually going to die in the nest and so he'll let things go be hard on you he'll let trials come your way why because he wants that movement to come in your life now he brews he fluttereth he moves in the nest he doesn't just he doesn't just sit quietly but if you'll watch an eagle or even a hen for that matter it's constant movement they're constantly shifting in the nest now the holy spirit is the atmosphere that brings the word to life how many believe that this morning now none of god's creation can have life without it we absolutely must have the holy spirit in our midst and in our own lives to be able to have life and that starts even before the token even before when you were first called by god it was the holy spirit calling you amen i hope you can see that today brother branham even talked about it being the holy spirit with your methodist grandmother he said or your pentecostal grandmother and you think well they didn't have nothing but they had the holy spirit even though they may not have known what to call it right but it was the whole same holy ghost brother random says that we have today but it's just in a different stage of the of the grain you understand now we have the fullness of it now we are the created children of god you know what that means we have a father some of you didn't have much of a father some of you had good fathers some of you are good fathers some of you didn't have much of a father but we have a father i want to and i got sometimes i get lost in these quotes and sometimes we'll just pull a little bit out of it you don't really see the breadth of what brother branham is talking about but he talks about this and and he says did you ever notice jesus said when he cast out a devil he done it with his finger if jesus said if i cast out devils the with the finger of god he said see what a devil is to him amen he said well my i got there's devils there's devils attacking me there's devils attacking my children he cast that out with his finger with his finger he said see what a devil is to him for healing it's just a little thing but watch when his sheep is lost he said what did he do he went and got the sheep and put it on his shoulders what's the strongest part of the man he said his back and his legs he said see the devil's nothing to him amen oh i hope we can recognize that today the devil is nothing to him he just puts him away with his finger cast him out with his finger but when it comes to the sheep he puts it across his shoulders and hold its feet and he packs it with the strongness of his body amen you're not held by his finger but you're held by the strength of his body oh that ought to make a bad dish out how to make somebody in hardy arkansas excited hey man even at christmas time when the world is in a doom and a gloom and wondering how they're going to pay off the credit cards that they spent way too much money on gifts for people that'll throw them in a corner somewhere they're wondering how they do it but even during that time it ought to make people happy to know that you're carried in the strength of god hallelujah so he said he packs it with the strongness of his body till he gets it back to the fold god loves his children he said well that's not very hard we wanted something harder don't get used to getting beat up god loves his children yeah we ought to get beat up sometimes but make sure it's by the word but don't just become an abused spouse gets used to being beat up god loves his children amen hallelujah he said now how did he get them this is a continuation of the quote he said the holy spirit went forth and brooded over the earth how did he get them how did they become children the holy spirit went forth and brooded over the earth in other words we could say it this way how did he bring them to manifestation the holy spirit went forth and brooded over the earth and as the he says as it went cooing he says he began brooding cooing he said let's just say for the talk's sake he was calling cooing like the evening dove when she set him cooing to her mate and as he begins to coo over nothing but a bleached desert of volcanic eruption he said look coming down the hill there i see some polish begin to move over with some calcium i notice again he said the strange thing a little moisture and petroleum begin to run together and right from under a little rock a little easter flower raised up its head life come on the earth and it screams did you know that the holy ghost was a worshiper yeah sure oh the prophet of god as he's drawing this drama for us he's showing us this picture life come on the earth and the holy ghost screamed said come father look at this all it was was the easter flower by the game it wasn't finished i hope your children are hearing me today don't get discouraged about where you're at because you aren't finished yet the old songs that he's still working on me he's not finished with you yet just an easter flower under a rock just a barren landscape it looked like something had come and just bombed it out it was just a void nothing there to it but the holy spirit began to coo over that certain spot under that rock there come a little flower and he screamed out and he said come father look at this amen oh i think it ought to make us happy to see even the slightest movement towards god you realize how many people don't move towards god at all how many people don't want nothing to do with god you say brother man i've made mistakes i've struggled i've done things that are wrong do you realize how many people never had the desire that you do to go to church they never had the desire that you do to hear the message of the hour never had the desire that you do to love god with all of your heart they never wanted it how many people never did want to see god never did want to come to god but you there was something placed on the inside of you before the foundation of the world that brought you directly to the house of god we ought to be excited about every sign of life we ought to be like the holy spirit that runs around and says look father amen there's a sign of life i see god begin to move amen go around critical well everybody in the church is dead will you be the sign of life that the holy ghost can come by and scream father look at this amen i wish i was 100 pounds lighter we'd really preach that notice you know wishing won't do it will it [Laughter] now he said god the father looks it over and said that's very pretty just keep on cooing hallelujah you realize that's how he looks at you you're the creation of god this is how he creates is by his holy spirit notice in the beginning but the man said the holy spirit began to brood over a bleak desert he said excuse my emotions but when there was nothing had never been nothing but the holy spirit was sent from god not an intellectual you don't brood by intellectualism i hope you're hearing me you mothers don't take care of your babies intellectually you do it emotionally and i hope you're hearing me this morning you don't brood over your child you don't take care of your children intellectually in fact even before they're born many times there's things that you desire and you want it's not an intellectual thing it's not because you've planned it all out and you've got it all like sometimes we do i know my wife had the baby book and all those things but we try to plan it all out and sometimes there's something that seems irrational why does mama want that because it's not an intellectual thing a birth is actually an emotional thing if you can put it you take care of them from compassion not from intellectual because intellectuals might say well leave the baby crying in the crib it'll be okay but brother branham taught us not to do that not that you could never let him cry for a minute but brother branham taught us not to just let him scream and cry he said take care of them show them love now why would a prophet care about that it's showing us something spiritually god's caring for us he's cooing to us it's not an intellectual conversation that we're having with heaven it's not a contract it's not us agreeing to certain things and god agreeing to certain things and when we get it all agreed to because we've got it all right then then we're going to make it in the rapture that's not what it is at all it's not an intellectual conversation [Music] how many of you are married good number of you now look how many of you had an intellectual conversation with your wife before you got married think about this some of you couldn't have an intellectual conversation if you tried i'm one of you but you don't have intellectual conversations in fact they seem silly to people that listen in i won't embarrass our engaged couple this morning but there's perhaps others of you that have unintellectual conversations huh you just walked up to somebody and said will you marry me i got three houses and three jobs and you looked like you'd make a good wife will you marry me if you agree and sign the contract will not no you don't have an intellectual conversation what do you do you get down on one knee will you marry me the hardest moment of your life your hearts are fluttering there's emotions involved in it you're not having an intellectual conversation those late night telephone calls if you were allowed to have them whether you probably had them whether you were allowed to or not it's not an intellectual conversation hope you hear me we don't deal with god by intellectuals he don't brood over us by intellectuals he don't come and brood over us by intellectuals it's with understanding but but not by intellectualism but it's the brooding of the holy spirit he is making love that's the way brother branham put it to his church brooding and cooling over it he says the holy spirit was sent from the presence of god to make love over the earth and as it was he stretched his big wings around the earth and began to make love or to brood cool over the earth he said i can see calcium and potash coming together and a little easterly stood up the holy spirit brooded out of the earth and he kept brooding and as he cooed and brood he said i began to see trees come up birds begin to fly from the earth animals begin to walk and then he kept cooing and a man came up called adam think for a moment if you had caught that in the middle of it somehow and maybe just right after that one easter lily was there under the rock and you heard a screaming and shouting god rejoicing over his his creation you might have looked at it and said there's no reason to shout there's no reason to be excited because there's nothing but baroness i don't see anything good but see when he saw the very first thing he's already seen it in his mind completed it's just as good as if it's completed the moment you gave your life to christ it was just as good as if yes you have to go through the process yes you'll feel the birth yes you'll you'll go through that you've got to you can't have a birth and not know it but from the very moment he knew who you were he knew all about it and he and he rejoiced over you amen now i'm not preaching that because some joel osteen kind of thing preaching that because a prophet taught it right that's not health wealth and prosperity only to the elect and sometimes to the elect he stands by while they struggle but it's still for their health their spiritual wealth and their prosperity that's kind of health wealth and prosperity i believe in now watch she said he said he kept coo and a man came up called adam and adam looked lonesome so he made a byproduct for him he took a rib from his side made him a sweetheart eve and he loved adam and he loved eve and i can see little eve as she laid her head against the shoulder of adam she was everything that a woman could ever expect and more as she laid against the big strong shoulder of her sweetheart adam they walked through the garden perhaps maybe the lion roared she couldn't be scared because there was no fear so he said sweetheart that is the lion i will call him leo the lion come forward she to the tiger you come here and lay down and they followed them like kittens the winds began to blow and the leaves hair began to blow and she said oh that wind peace be still and the winds obeyed him he was the son of god she was his sweetheart i can hear him say dear do you see the sun setting it's time that we talk to the father so they went up to the cathedral the great tree and as they knelt down all of a sudden a heavenly glowing light came down the logos the holy spirit that had brewed them out of the earth came down father god oh my not a different person but the same person came down the holy spirit the holy spirit that created himself in the womb of mary the holy spirit came down and talked to them he said children have you enjoyed yourself today yes father i've come down to kiss you good night to lay you down to rest tonight he kissed him on the cheeks and laid them down nothing could harm listen church we were given an insight into what it was like not from the standpoint of an intellectual but from the standpoint of how it must have felt and ever since i've heard it brother andrew i've wanted to go there i want to go to church there i want to be in that cathedral i want to sit there under that tree i want to hear him don't see i'm not content this message has restored us back it's restored us back to it brother ramon said pentecost plus he said that plus it's restored but i'm not comfortable yet i hope you're hearing me this morning i'm not ready to rest on our laurels i'm not ready yes we believe in healing yes we believe in salvation we believe in the holy ghost and coming on the church and all those things and blessing us but we want that same holy ghost to take us all the way back to where we can be in that eden again and it's going to happen this is the message that takes you back not back just to pentecost but all the way back to eden hallelujah aren't you glad you serve a god that can take you back to that spot and a prophet of the hour came to show us what it was like i want to be in that church he lets us know what that's like once in a while don't he he just comes down among us and settles down and it's just like he's just so close amen and if it wasn't for these bodies that are still cankered sinful amen if it wasn't for this flesh you and i could fellowship with him in that extreme closeness that he meant for us too but one of these days brother joe this body's going to be changed and there will be nothing hindering us from walking in that garden and fellowshipping with him in the cool of the day hallelujah well i'm looking forward to it aren't you you ever get a revelation of that you quit bickering and fussing and fighting the stupid because it's not just going to be you going to be all of god's children i don't want anybody there i can't get along with so you know what i'm going to do i'm not going to keep them out i'm going to start getting along with people he said that's not important god thinks it is i'm not gonna get through this this morning just bear with me notice he says he says i've come down to kiss you good night to lay you down to rest tonight he kissed him on the cheeks laid them down nothing could harm them he was right in the bushes with them the lion he laid the lion down he laid cheetah the tiger down he laid them all down to rest and father was so pleased nobody unhappy nobody crying no sin everything was just right father was so pleased amen and then sin by knowledge intellectual he said i hope you're getting it by intellectual sin entered the world by trying to find more light getting something that wasn't in the word of god god said the day you eat there of that day you'll die but eve wanted something new he said oh can you see from my heart i'm not trying to cross up someone i'm only trying to lay out in view thus saith the lord the word nothing but that not fantastics and big churches and intellectuals but listen oh if we can just listen this morning to listen to the one who brewed us from the earth hallelujah sin entered he said and now friends listen to this watch this closely he said now friends if the holy spirit was the only instrument that god used to brood us out of the earth oh my and we did come from the earth we were here before there was an earth he said remember here is encouragement for you people that's to be praised if the holy spirit by brooding made the physical being who is the architect of our bodies who is the architect of our bodies if the holy spirit oh my made the physical being who is the oh if you're sick this morning grab hold of the promise of god if the holy spirit made the physical being who is the architect of our bodies he said oh god many people see it the holy spirit gave you your appendix hallelujah i'm be careful about letting them take it out you know prophet of god said the holy spirit gave it to me i know sometimes we have to have those things taken out in this imperfect world but originally god had a purpose for it the holy spirit gave you your appendix your eyes your nose your mouth your heart and put a new spirit in you and then come to live in you he's listening to this church and i take it as a challenge this morning do not by any means except intellectual things theology that's contrary to the bible but stay only with us saith the lord he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we are healed you say brother ben i don't understand why you read so many quotes why do you try to stay so close to the message of the hour listen if all i can be accused of when i'm done with whatever my ministry is on the earth is staying close to the message then i'm okay with that if all i can be accused with is staying close to the scriptures i'm all right with that if by preaching the gospel i'm staying close to the scriptures because he said to preach the gospel i'm okay with doing that i'll take your criticism are you with me now amen because i'm staying close to the word that's what every one of us need to do amen god help me to do it he said don't do not by any means except intellectual things the all is jesus contrary to the bible but stay only with thus saith the lord he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed he said the holy spirit brooded his own body to live in jesus christ now we're coming down to it he's still in the same quote the holy spirit brooded his own body to live in that which is within you he said is of the holy ghost hallelujah well how do you think you're saved you're not saved by intellectualism you're saved by the holy ghost now think about you say well you say by the word that's true the word and the spirit are inseparable logos in the beginning was the holy ghost the whole the christ the anointing is the anointed word right if you have the holy culture say you have the holy ghost to feel the reign of the holy ghost and you don't and you deny the word you don't have it right you can't separate the two the holy spirit rooted his own body to live in jesus christ when he overshadowed mary and created or brooded a blood cell in the womb that brought forth the son christ jesus where god himself brother branham says that too many times for me to say anything different god himself tabernacled on earth for 33 and a half years and he made was made a propitiation for our sins to redeem us and to bring reconciliation between lost man and a holy god to kiss them and reconcile them together that oh my think about this for this purpose that in the cool of the evening when the sun is setting over our brow when my life's journey is run and my race is finished i want him to kiss me to sleep hallelujah as he did stephen when he was baffled from hand to hand he said i see the heavens open and jesus standing at the right hand of god he said there you are what is that the same holy ghost not just the same one it was at pentecost yes he's the same one but the same one at the beginning of time at the very beginning that come out and moved on the face of the waters the same holy ghost that's moving over your life today the same presence that you feel amen aren't you glad you can feel it you wouldn't have to there's times you don't feel it but aren't you glad it gives you moments when you can feel it you can become sensitive to it i'm glad that we can luke 134 mary asked the angel she said how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall notice overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god now notice that word overshadow is enveloped enveloped it's actually if you put something the word envelope comes from that if you put something in an envelope or an envelope you take it and you put it inside of it and you close it up so that it's sealed in hallelujah and you'll get that after a while it's sealed in the letter's sealed in the end you you envelop is to is to come completely over not to leave anything amen that would that would not be covered to put a tent oh my to put a tent over it oh we could go there for a while hey man i i want a tent i i'm not looking for for a canvas tent i'm looking for a covering of the holy ghost that envelops the church how carnal people can be now look to put a tent over now have you ever noticed that when a shadow comes it changes the atmosphere if you've ever worked out on the farm or out in the out in the heat of the day and i actually did that at once in my life one time in my life way back in the day i actually worked on a farm i know what it's like to be out there with the cows and out there and with the crops in the field and my grandpa had old equipment nothing he had had a cab on it so everything we were always out in the sun and out in the wind and the rain whatever that it was when we were helping him out he'd give us a dollar a day or take us and buy us a hamburger and that was a good uh boy i need to be quiet about this i know some of you all work for a living don't you dad's get your grandpa's getting the ideas but he'd take us out there by the bill and and make us work you get out there and you're just so hot and there may be one big tree left standing in the field i always wondered why he left that tree in the field and one tree in the cow pasture just one tree but if you go over there in the heat of the day as soon as you walk under it the atmosphere changes it's about 10 degrees cooler maybe 20. why is it so much cooler because when you're standing there it actually is changing the fact that the tree is there changes the atmosphere around it it lowers the temperature so the condition is right for you to sit and enjoy it don't you realize that's the kind of place the house of god ought to be that's the kind of place we ought to come to when we come to the house of god we ought to be able to walk in and come to a place not where everybody's criticizing one another making fun of one another talking about this one and talking about that one we that we should stop that you quit smoking years ago you quit drinking years ago quit talking about people it's just as bad if the holy ghost can take these other things out of your life you can take that out of your life that was extra right there but don't you want to be able to come to a place where you walk in and you know amen i believe your church that you go to can be like that and not only that your home can be like that when you walk into it you can have a place where it's not just worldliness and things going on yes you have fun yes there's there's laughter there but it's a place you can walk into and the temperature the atmosphere changes the thing you've been under at work the thing that you've been around why because under the atmosphere of the shadowing the overshadowing of the holy ghost the temperature changes oh i wish people would recognize that brother branham talks about that being out in the desert how that in the desert there will be little cactus he said and they got little stickers on them and he said the reason they do he said it's just leaves rolled up real tight he said the reason it is because of the atmospheric conditions that are there they never get any rain he said if you would let rain fall in the desert for a while it would begin to blossom like a rose and those things would begin to unfurl if you let the reign of i'm talking about the real holy ghost not just an emotion not just a sensation but the real reign of the holy ghost will change the atmosphere in the building where you're not all the time sticking one another and bleeding one another but till there's a presence of god listen i believe he wants to change the atmosphere of this area until you're not just sticking one another all the time but until you believe that all things are possible and you're sitting there under the tree hallelujah amen notice brother branham says god's life which is in the greek called zoe moving through them and in them quickened their minds to his word he said now let me say it real quietly now the spirit of god that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of god he said see it does it he said look and i'm trying to show you let you realize that i'm speaking out of the church he said it also quickened the life in him he said although they only was his attributes to begin with but if god said in this day back in the beginning john doe will be my servant millions of years ago he said now john doe is born in sin we're all john or jane doe you understand amen that's who we are he's born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lives because he's immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join a pentecostal church don't know he might join a message church might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of god once he said john doe is bound to recognize who his father is hallelujah just as that eagle recognized who the mother is it's got to realize it you see when brother branham said that he said he was born again when he realized he was not the son of charles and elle branham but he was the son of god and people say well that means there was no sensation how did he come to that realization by being in the atmosphere of the holy ghost are you with me now it had to be now look john doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who his mother was he's got to realize it see he said only that john doe is god's attribute to become where you won't hear this down at the baptist church today i saw a lot of i bless their hearts you know people some of them serve god better than we do because they serve god by all we know all they know but i saw a little video of one this morning and they were coming out there their christmas sweaters and their reindeer and their santa clauses and everything he'd come out we were in a hurry he knew the people was in a hurry and wanted to preach a quick sermon but jason and i ran into uh one the other day and and it was a preacher that was come walking around and and come in the restaurant there where we were we were talking about preaching he walked in there he said i preach and we said okay and i guess he was a pastor somewhere he said yeah he said i've learned you can't preach longer than 12 minutes we looked at each other and we didn't want belly now we preach he said you can't keep people's attention longer than 10 minutes no not unless you have an atmosphere are you with me this morning not unless you can create an atmosphere that people want to be in the house of god a christian longs for that you see in that atmosphere john doe is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's got to realize it see only he said that john doe is god's attribute has become a word spoken and then the holy spirit seeks that word out i love that he said here it is he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of god god's word a christian as i said longs for that for that atmosphere for the overshadowing that produces the works of god in our mortal flesh brother branham said i certainly is speaking under a place and if you go back and look you'll find that this was just a few people under incorrect leadership historically it proved that out but brother branham saw a few people gathered together he'd come and preach to him in prescott arizona he said you can lay he said certainly he said if i said amen and walked out the door he said i'd say it would pay me every sunday to drive up here or have my children even to come up to sit under an atmosphere like this because it's always the atmosphere that brings the results and you wonder sometimes and i'm just preaching at home folks now y'all the rest of you can shut your ears but sometimes we wonder why we we get to a point where we just we get discouraged and you say well i guess i'll go back to church when i get encouraged again that's not the time to get go back to church it's when you're discouraged because that's where the atmosphere is like i said especially if the atmosphere at your home is broken and sometimes it just is you can come to the house of god and get that atmosphere and go back and change the atmosphere at your house look brother brown said you can he said it's the atmosphere that brings results you can lay a seed out there in the ground no matter how much that seed is germatized and lay it there it's got to have an atmosphere to make it live he said the sun has come has to come to a certain power he said bring it to a certain atmosphere an egg has to have an atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter how fertile it is it's got to have that atmosphere he said and i think that in a group like this amen he said i think in a group like this christians hatch out are born again in such an atmosphere as this he said this is the kind of atmosphere i was born under hallelujah he said no matter where i go and visit the cold world and mission fields and so forth i can even stand and close my eyes and think of this atmosphere hallelujah the holy spirit created the atmosphere that would bring a conception of the word by overshadowing mary listen once the holy spirit makes you a new creation what does that make you know what he created things certain things for certain reasons but when he created you what did he create you created you in his own image he created you to be a creator the messiah come to be the firstborn among many brethren to bring messiahs then what do you do you go and you're a little creator and you build your own atmosphere you get to do that by your words now i told you recently you got to watch what you tear down because everything that you say and that's why jesus said every idle word will be judged at the day of judgment he said if when you speak you either build up or you tear down every time you speak with every word that you say you either build up or you tear down now be careful what you tear down because when you tear something down you need to be able to build it up there are some times you have to tear down there are some times with your children you have to correct them be careful what you tear out of their lives when you go and you begin to criticize the ministry you begin to criticize people everybody around you and you just get that critical spirit on you what you're doing is tearing something down in the minds of your children and you don't realize that what god wants you to do is build up something that will bring a respect be careful what you how you use your voice because you're a creator and god didn't go out there and build with his hands he created by his words hallelujah and then the holy spirit rooted it to life you just go speak with no holy spirit to back it up you're going to get nothing but if you go and speak the holy spirit if you're if you're speaking with a heart full of love and you're speaking with the right motives and the right you know at the right time when god compels your speech all of a sudden you begin to see the holy spirit make it happen oh my we've all seen that haven't we no brother brandon said don't fuss don't fuss see i got a problem i can't get past some things brother brandon says i just can't get around don't fuss you say brother ben have you ever fussed yes sir yes ma'am it's probably a lady that asked that don't fuss he told us not to the holy spirit agrees with the word now brother bram didn't just say that he was a word prophet and the bible says that think on these things as much as is possible live peacefully with all men so he said don't fuss see temper breeds temper first thing you know you grieve the holy spirit away from you you'll be fussing back watch he said so he said don't fuss now sometimes you just have to walk away from a fuss that's what he's saying because pretty soon you'll be fussing back then the holy spirit takes his flight temper breeds temper and love breeds love be full of love jesus said this will all men know you're my disciples when you have loved one for another that's the fruit of the holy spirit is love notice he doesn't say the evidence but the fruit there was a time he considered maybe that love was the evidence of the holy ghost but he'd come to find out that wasn't true but it is a fruit of the holy ghost he said did you know you were a little creator yourself he said you know that certainly you've seen people that you just love to be around praise god he said you i know you all love to be around me he said you don't know why just that loving type of person have you seen that just as kind there you like to be around them they create that atmosphere by the life that they live the way that they talk their conversation see god didn't idly just walk around say well let there be light man that light don't look very good let there be darkness everything he said he meant oh if we can only realize the power of our words you walk into a into your house some of you know this walk into your house i was a actually 7 30 to 4 30 but eight to five kind of worker you know you come in at night walk in if dinner wasn't ready i got two options got two options so you smell something burning have you ever done that don't raise your hand you walk into a into your home you smell something burning i remember one time i i've told you the story before you just bear with me i'll close in a minute i was we just got married we were there in west plains in a duplex nest next to sister fritz she was our landlady at the time and we were in that little duplex and my wife was learning to cook and we had a little oven in there and she had a we bought some frozen pizzas and don't laugh about that it was good food at the time i must have gotten fed good because i gained 80 pounds after we got married but we were sitting there and she was doing that how was it work and i come home and i can smell it burning isn't that an awful feeling you're hungry you walk in the house and it's burning and and what had happened she didn't have a regular pizza pan and she'd put it on her and it spilled off or something or maybe still when she tried to take it out i think it was and it spilled all over the place and it was burning the cheese was burning such an awful smell the burning of fake mozzarella cheese on the top of a pizza it's burning and as that aroma come in the door and i walked in i said what did you do you can't even cook pizza i had two choices i chose the wrong one now my wife's not the type to snap back she don't do that i thank god for that she don't snap back but she will get quiet and that day she just had about enough she just got real quiet i walked back out the door when i walked out the door i'll never forget it they're sitting on my doorstep was a turtle dove i walked outside the door and i slammed the door and the dove got startled and flew away i thought my god what have i done because brother branham said when you have that wolf nature the devil fly away and i i walked back in the house my wife was standing there crying trying to clean up the mess i think we're gonna have to eat we're gonna do something i can't remember what we did we'll get something else i'm sorry that atmosphere changed so you're a creator you got two choices this morning what kind of service you're going to have how are you going to worship god and some of us some of the atmosphere you're living in right now as a result of things you said to each other this morning see you've got to apply the holy spirit you've got to create an atmosphere i'm going to skip down here just a little bit the holy spirit is given to you you'll have to find me the holy spirit is given to you you must apply it yourself now brother bran i'm in the token that's where i'm going to now is in the token brother branham it says in paragraph 372 he said get ready apply it believe it clean up he said let your children let your family let your loved ones see it in you he said that's right it'll take effect now you're you're the creator you have to apply the token no matter how much the token is available you've got to actually put it on the door how do you apply the token well your creator now look he said then apply the token in prayer he said with consideration with believing apply it with such love now i can remember hearing sermons about applying the token when i was a kid and they were always angry have you ever heard a sermon about you better apply the token getting dark out there better apply the token and there's there's some merit to that you know because we do it's a dark time right but brother branham didn't say apply it in anger he said apply it with such love and so forth to you know it's going to take place i heard a man say the other day some preachers never raised their voice unless it's in anger and that's you know that that's the truth god help us not to be like that lord if i'm going to raise my voice let me do it in worship listen he said he said apply it he said with love with such love and so forth you know it's going to take place it's going to take place that's all apply it in confidence believing it's going to help hey man when you talk to that child now some of you are going to go on christmas as i'm closing this morning you're going to be around family maybe that you're not normally around you're going to be in atmospheres that are different you're not always going to be in the atmosphere that you're used to being in and so you have to become a creator notice he said apply it he said in confidence believing it's going to help when you talk to that child when you talk to your husband talk to your wife talk to this loved one believe that it's going to help just stand there and say lord i've claimed them they're mine i'm getting them for you lord hallelujah who am i i'm getting them for you lord some of you all are claiming your children you should have claimed 20 years ago by creating an atmosphere in your home i'm not saying that to make you feel bad but if you have children today claim them not after they leave while they're at home apply it you you claim by faith after they left but the best time to do it is to create an atmosphere while they're at home listen he said apply it create that atmosphere and he said around you that those well love this create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it that family member who smokes drinks cusses they come in that atmospheric atmosphere that you've created out of love and applying the token and they come in there and they think boy i haven't wanted to smoke for an hour or two for some reason maybe they feel convicted of their sin but there's something in them i want that and they just drop right into it he said oh you are he said if you got the token you create a spirit around you a power that when you walk people know that you're a christian they love for you to say something to them don't you want to be that kind of person instead of the person that everybody dreads to talk to because they know they're going to get criticized they love for you to say something to them by the bailey i don't mean to embarrass you'd be sitting back there but the bailly don't say much the herald doesn't say much but when he says something it's usually good i like that so i'll go around brother bailey and try to get him to talk you know i want him to say something to me because it's usually good don't you want to be somebody that people want to say something praise god amen be an encouragement some of you have been such an encouragement for me and i won't call you but you know who you are sometimes i'll get down and i'll get a text from somebody just praying for you today but ben i think my god i i don't know what i did to deserve that i didn't do anything to deserve that but i know it's the love of god in people's hearts you creating an atmosphere can change the atmosphere in your pastor's home oh my now look he says apply it create that atmosphere around you they'll just drop right into it he said you are if you've got the token you create a spirit around you of power when you walk people know you're a christian they love you to say something to them they believe your word what you say they hold on to it make yourself believable by the atmosphere around you oh my he said apply the token then walk with it claim your household you must do it now this is evening time he said now you've been listening a long time how many you've been listening for a long time i don't mean this morning i mean all your life you've listened to the message of the hour you've been listening for a long time now this is the evening time time to apply it amen it's applying time now the wrath will strike one of these days it might be too late then apply the token with with confidence but you bow your heads with me musicians come we'll just break off there there's so much more i could say but i think you understand my heart this morning i trust that you do every head bowed and every eye closed you're gonna be around people you're not usually around you're going to find yourself in situations that you don't usually find yourself in maybe a christmas party at work if you go to those things maybe i remember being in christmas parties there wasn't another person there there was one lady who was church of christ everybody else was just heathens where i worked every christmas they'd come i remember the one year my boss declared an alcohol-free chris christmas even though they all drank because they they knew i was a minister and every christmas i got to pray with those people the one time of the year they would listen to me they were thankful when i finished quick for several years i got to pray with those people every year i'll never forget that the atmosphere you create around you will have to make people have confidence in you and you've experienced this you know this when you go to work and somebody asks you to pray maybe they don't believe nothing like you but it's the atmosphere that's there create an atmosphere this christmas that is so full of the holy ghost you know to do that you've got to forgive to do that you've got to love to do that you've got to care about people you take the toke you say lord i can't do that by myself you take that token and apply the blood to the door let that atmosphere be a creator of an atmosphere of love in your house this christmas it'll cause the word to be born in your family it'll make you a real christian would you just talk to god for a moment just right where you're seated just talk to him for a minute lord i want to be a creator maybe you've created some things that are bad lord help me to tear down those things not with not with evil in my heart not out of malice but out of love to tear down what's wrong and to build up what's right to create an atmosphere in my home and among my family that people can be changed if all i ever got done in the ministry is to change the people in my family to see them progress to the holy ghost i want more than that i want to see everyone that god brings but it's all i ever got done is for my daughter sitting here on the front row to be under such an atmosphere of the holy ghost that she would know that she needs to be born again she know what it's like to feel god tugging at her heart that's all i want that's enough could you just do that every one of your creators not just the preacher we work hard to create an atmosphere here in the church why don't you create an atmosphere in your home i know some of you have at heart i know some of you maybe you have parents that aren't right or children it's hard it's hard for a young person when mom and dad maybe don't serve the lord but you go create an atmosphere do it with your words do it by being like him maybe sometimes you just won't respond but you create the right atmosphere [Music] miracles can be born in that atmosphere that's the atmosphere i was born under i trust you as well heavenly father lord jesus as i feel your presence here this morning lord we come down to christmas time and we know lord that what an atmosphere it is for us but the writer said it ought to be a time of worship we know you were born on december 25th but you were born lord the world just commercialized it and even some christians take it to a place where all they do is spend money and they hate this time of year but oh god may it be a reminder to us that you were born that you were that you not only were born but you walked the earth you were tempted and all like manner like we are you're a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities maybe you went to family gatherings that weren't so nice when you did you turned water into wine when they run out of the right atmosphere let me be the one that could be a creator and create that atmosphere back in the home again i pray you'd grant it lord you know what that's like you not only were born but you raised lord you came you died you rose again on the third day you came back on the day of pentecost and you manifested yourself in our hour or among us we're so grateful for that today lord there's just something in our hearts lord are these people that are praying and talking to you right now oh god there's something in their heart they want to be under that tree sit there as the kind of presence of god flows down lord we want to be in that city that we've read about oh god we want to see you in that body lord we we love you as you are in the holy spirit but we want to make it till we see you face to face oh we're so such a desire in our hearts today god lord may we do everything lord in our power to be there if there's one here that's never received you at the holy ghost i pray god right now that you'd fill them with the holy ghost lord may they begin to seek it lord if they need to come to an altar and die out help them to die lord we don't come to an altar to get something we come to give up ourselves so you we can be filled but lord they can be filled where they're sitting this morning i pray that it would be so thank you for it thank you for your love thank you for your mercy thank you for the atmosphere of your word i pray that children would be born or those that have been conceived would be fully born into the kingdom of god we pray in jesus name amen amen let's stand together could you just worship him a moment i know we got a busy day but just worship him a moment let the reign of the holy spirit fall and if there's something in you to respond to the word there's something in you to respond to the rain just step up your hand and say lord i'm so grateful i'm so happy that you put something in me that wants to worship under that tree under that atmosphere under the shade of the enveloping of the holy ghost under
