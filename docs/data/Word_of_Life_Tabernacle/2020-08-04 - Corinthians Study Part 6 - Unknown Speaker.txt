========================================

thank you for joining us today for our study on the book of first corinthians we'll give you guys just a moment if there's a few that want to join us live today if you can't join us live you're more than welcome to join us um later on um we'll have it uploaded to facebook into youtube as well so that you'll be able to watch a little bit later on um i want to go over just a few things that we talked about last time last week just so that we can kind of uh give you a chance to join us today um we looked at verses one through five of chapter two of first corinthians we found that paul did not represent himself as an orator he didn't show himself to be excellent in speech he said i came not to do with excellency in speech we found that apollos on by contrast was an orator he was educated revelated and dedicated if you'd say it that way but he was not the messenger to the age and so we found that you have to always look at not the person that speaks the best but who brings the word to the age and that was paul and apollos was not wrong apollos was a good man and he was a great preacher of the gospel but he was a person who was a carrier of the message he was not the messenger himself and and we've seen that in our day we also found that paul when he came he preached with power and demonstration of the spirit for the effect of changing lives that's why he preached was for the effect of changing lives so let's go into first corinthians chapter two and verse six and before we do let's have a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for all the things that you've done for us we thank you for your word we thank you for the peace that passes all understanding i pray lord that somehow this would be a blessing to us lord during the week lord maybe as just a little break from our jobs and things that we have to do i pray god that you would help us and keep us in your perfect will lord as we bring these things lord may it be only your word and nothing else i pray for each one that's sick or in need or that would watch this that they would be blessed they would receive what they have need up we pray in jesus name amen first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 6 he says paul is paul writing he says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world more of the princes of this world that come to naught that word perfect is the greek word this is the next slide the greek word telios which means brought to its end finished wanting nothing necessary to completeness perfect it's consummate human integrity and virtue when it's talking about of men but it also means full grown adult of full age mature and that's the context that paul is bringing in in here is of those that are mature those that who are able to handle it because he later on explains that the corinthians were babies when it comes to these things and he speaks of that also in hebrews how that those that are of the full age those that are mature in christ can receive the deep things of god and so he says we do speak wisdom so he's contrasting this with what he's already told us that he said i come not into you with excellency of speech and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom but here he says i come to you we do speak wisdom among them that are perfect we don't speak this wisdom to the world but we speak this wisdom to those who are mature christians he said yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught so in verse 7 he says but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory so this wisdom was not known by the world in general and brother branham says uh something in christ is the mystery of god revealed that i thought was good as we come out of this this phase where paul is talking about how he came to them in fear and trembling and all of these things and brother branham says paul this great intellectual man never tried to express his great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the lord and he lived the word so that it expressed through him he lived so godly until they seen jesus christ in him that's what i want to do so much so they wanted his handkerchief to take it and lay it upon the sick he said there is the life of christ so not so much in in the mysteries that paul knew but in the fact that he lived it in such a way until they saw jesus christ in him verse 8 says which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory if they had known that he was the lord of glory if they had known this mystery if they had been had insight into this hidden mystery they wouldn't have done what they did but they did it because they didn't know and the fact that they were princes which that word as the next slide princess is arkhan which is a ruler a commander a chief or a leader the fact that they were the leaders or chiefs of the people did not automatically mean that they knew the hidden mystery and this is something again that paul is hitting at that it's not always the wise it's not always the great man it's not always even a great speaker a great orator but someone who knows the hidden mystery if you want to know about christ you're not going to find him in the wisdom of this world you're going to find him in the wisdom that comes from god so brother branham he picks up on this and christ crisis mystery of god revealed again and he goes over these verses that we've went over the last few verses and they he said you said you're wrong about rabbis and preachers there and then he says who crucified him so he reads the scripture and then he kind of comes back at him and he says you say you're wrong about rabbis and preachers well who crucified him it was preachers that did it so just because someone is a preacher doesn't mean that they know this hidden mystery just because someone's a rabbi just because someone says that they know the word just because someone has a youtube program or or television program doesn't mean that they know this hidden mystery but watch their life watch what they do watch how they act among the people and then you'll begin to see do they demonstrate the power of the gospel to change a life that's what you want to look at so so that's the very class that crucified him was rabbis and preachers verse 9 says but as it is written i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him i love this scripture it's one of that i quote constantly i have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them to love him that you can't even imagine it hasn't even entered into your imagination what god has done and what he's prepared for those that love him and so and speaking of the things that they didn't know and god still reveals down to the age but now paul takes that and i think it's interesting because paul takes that scripture and he paraphrases it to get the sense and application now there's there are people i will teach you today that it's wrong to do that you can't paraphrase the scripture well if if it's wrong to do that then paul was wrong because paul does it constantly in the new testament he paraphrases he puts the scriptures together brother branham also does that he paraphrases the scripture he takes one scripture and puts it with another scripture um the scripture where he talks about lord i'm with you always even to the end of the world takes one scripture i'll be with you even in you until the end of the world takes one scripture puts it with another scripture and and makes his thought but the thought and the context is the same so this is the original that paul is taking it from isaiah 64 4 for since the beginning of the world men have not heard or perceived by the ear neither have the i seen o god beside thee what he has prepared for him that waiteth for him so the sense is the same and we've talked about that before that you can't always go just by did they say the exact words word for word but did they convey the meaning did they convey the meaning and that's what preaching is is conveying the meaning not to find a meaning that's not there but to convey the meaning that's already there so paul does that now brother branham and and i put this in here just kind of as an extra thing but brother branham does talk about that how that these scribes and these ones can miss him and and the world they've not seen they don't know even though they do know the words they know the exact language that was used but they don't know the hidden mystery he says no one can doubt but what the scribes and pharisees and the great scholars of the year 33 a.d this is that was that next slide knew the exact laws of grammar and the exact meanings of the words in which the old testament was written but for all their superb knowledge they missed the revelation of god's promised word manifested in the son now catch those words they missed the revelation of god's promised word manifested in the son and it do you good to go back and listen and or read an exposition of the seven church ages if you go back to where brother branham says this you'll find that he talks about how all these greek scholars and how that they've gone back to the original text and but they can't even agree among themselves about the word even though they have the original text so they're not just using the king james version or whatever version you use but they're using the original text and they still cannot agree one with another and the reason why they can't agree is because it hasn't been revealed to them so brother random tells us that for all the superb knowledge that the scribes and the pharisees had they could not see they did not know the word manifested in the son he said there he was set forth from genesis to malachi with the whole chapter devoted to him in his ministry and yet except for a few who were illuminated by the spirit they missed him entirely the next slide he said but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit so they missed it having all these advantages being able to read the original greek and the hebrew which is something i've always wanted to be able to do i can go back and look at the translation but i've never been able to read the actual you know read it in the original language it's such a blessing to be able to do that but even though they could do that and they were familiar with the scriptures in a way that couldn't even compare with us today but it was not revealed to them he said but god hath revealed him unto us by his spirit so paul says i'm not relying on my knowledge of the original language but i'm relying on the fact that these things have been revealed to me by the spirit the spirit searcheth all things a the deep things of god the deep things of god and when we look at that we kind of look at that word that that verse is saying the spirit searches all things even the deep things of god that's not actually what he's saying he's saying this in the god's word translation on that next slide has a better translation of it where he says the spirit searches everything especially the deep things of god so when he says yey we might take that wrong but it's drawing your attention to it it's especially the deep things of god so it's not as though the deep things of god were the the limit of what he would do but that's the things that he reveals to us verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man or the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god so he says now we have received verse 12 not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god and this is dispensation the things that are freely given to us is the things we are granted is it's what it is in the original it's the things which we are granted is the things given to us in our dispensation and and i'm so thankful that we live in the dispensation of the open book and the dispensation of the fullness of times and the dispensation when these things were to be revealed in the dispensation when all of these things would all of these things that were unknown all these loose sins would be tied up so he says we we know the things that are freely given to us of god and i'm so grateful that we can know we don't just have to guess but we can know the things that are freely given to us of god so these are things we can know we don't have to guess at now he says the secret things and this is in deuteronomy 29 29 the secret things belong to the lord our god so there are things that god keeps and this is this idea of dispensationalism or the things that are freely given the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belonging to us so the things that are revealed we have a right to know how are we going to know them only by the spirit of god those things which are revealed belonging to us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law how are we going to know what to do unless we have the word and so he says there are things that are secret many things in that time were secret that are now revealed many things that were in the old testament were revealed in the new testament and now we live in the time of the fullness of the revelation because the bible tells us that he reveals his secret this is the next slide he said surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so he says before he does anything he's going to reveal this secret the thing that's been held the thing that we didn't know he reveals that to his servants the prophets then in revelation 10 7 he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to who to his servants the prophets so how we gonna know the secret we're gonna know the secret by the spirit as he reveals it to us through the prophets i hope we understand that verse 13 he says which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom speaketh or teaches teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual now this is important and we're going to go down right to the end of the chapter today so we'll be just a few more minutes but he says comparing spiritual things was spiritual and this is the idea of comparing look at that next slide if you would then the spiritual things with spirituals the idea of comparing one part of the revelation with another so it's the revelation of the gospel with what the jews had the discoveries of the new testament with the types and prophecies of the old the comparing of matters of revelation with or that's what we compare we don't compare matters of revelation with matters of science things supernatural with things natural and common that's the wrong measure but we compare spiritual things with spiritual and so many people get mixed up by this today they say well if i could prove that the cloud scientifically was a supernatural cloud then i would believe no you don't compare spiritual things with natural things you compare spiritual things with spiritual things you compare the events and the signs of the messenger they are with the scripture spiritual things with spiritual things not spiritual things with so and this is matthew henry that says it's written several hundred years ago but it's still good he said the comparing of matters of revelation with matters of science things supernatural with things natural and common is going by a wrong measure spiritual things when brought together will help to illustrate one another but if the principles listen to this if the principles of human art and science are to be made a test of revelation we shall certainly judge a myth concerning it and the things contained in it that's what people are trying to do today you don't judge spiritual things by human art and science we do not make human art and science a test of revelation but revelation is compared with previous revelation you compare what one prophet said with what another prophet said not with what scientists say all right so brother branham says now remember and this is in the sixth seal he said now remember he said i've always taught that in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established he said in the scripture just like you can't take one scripture and prove nothing lest there is something else that goes with it and and brother branham takes an almost funny illustration it's not funny but it's amusing he said see i can take one scripture and say judas went and hung himself i can take another one and say you go do the same so that's two scriptures but i'm not comparing them accurately because he said but see it won't blend in with the rest of it it won't blend in with the rest of it it has to blend in and you'll find brother branham taught us that all the way through the scripture from genesis to revelation it's got to blend in the whole thing verse 14 he said but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god so this is where jesus said you must be born again because he said if you're not born again you can't see the kingdom and to see we know is to understand he said the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned now brother branham tells us he says there's or actually this is um from a commentary the cambridge commentary it says there's but little analogy between mental and spiritual discernment or processes which the apostle has been contrasting through the whole this chapter so let's take it like this two different ways of looking at things natural discernment is a result of knowledge investigation and argument that's how you you decide what something is we we look at the world and and we see well this is a desk how do we know this is a desk well that's the result of knowledge investigation and argument someone could tell me that it is i could use it as that i could investigate and see if that's the case and we could argue about it and see who has the better argument as to what it is and i said no it's a table i say it's a desk it's a table my argument is what has uh drawers i can pull out and there's things i can do with it i couldn't do with just a table so it's a desk so that's how you come to a conclusion of what something is which is what discernment is it's the result of knowledge investigation and argument but the faculties which produce this spiritual discernment are sharpened by self-discipline humility communion with god love of god love of the brethren that's not how you come to knowledge naturally but it is how you come to knowledge spiritually and too many times we try to get spiritual knowledge spiritual discernment through natural processes and you can't do that you want to know more about the scripture love god more you want to know more about the scripture learn how to love the brothers learn self-discipline learn humility learn communion with god verse 15 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things he himself is judged of no man he judges all things but he judged but he is judged by no man that next slide is john wesley he said but the spiritual man he that hath the spirit discerneth all the things of god wherever we've been speaking yet he himself is discerned that's how he translate the word translates the word judged he himself is discerned by no man no natural men they don't understand what he is nor what he says and we know that that brother branham taught us that as well first corinthians 2 16 for who hath known the mind of the lord that you may instruct him in other words how are you going to how are you going to get into the mind of god how he thinks why he thinks about what what he does who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ we have the mind of christ what a blessing that is how do we have the mind of christ by the spirit of god brother branham says it this way and i'm closing we're almost finished but the member says here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he once done with the word who can know the mind of god who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him so paul is telling the corinthians don't rest in your great men don't rest in your natural ability don't rest in the names of these great men paul and and peter and apollos and even christ but rest in the fact that you have the spirit of god which gives you the mind of god the mind of christ and that means the word is in you you have the mind of christ and the spirit of christ is in you to know what he wants done with the word and that's important because it's one thing to know the word it's one thing to know the letter it's another thing to know what he wants done with the word and this is a problem in the corinthian church because they know the word and they're a real church a real bunch of believers that they are a real group of believers but they don't know how to apply the word to their everyday lives and that's what we're going to get into as we move on to the book of first corinthians he says she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord what a blessing that is what a promise that is to us as the bride of christ he said then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose and i'm so grateful that we serve a god who is not just a dead letter but it's something that can be a purpose in our lives that can produce a life that is lived that can be worthy of the gospel it can be an example to our brothers and that can be changed from what we were to what we can be today to live under the blessings under the fountain of god's blessings let's pray heavenly father thank you for once again meeting with us today i pray god that you would just move and and anoint these words to our hearts as we go throughout our day thank you for all that you do we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you thank you for watching today
