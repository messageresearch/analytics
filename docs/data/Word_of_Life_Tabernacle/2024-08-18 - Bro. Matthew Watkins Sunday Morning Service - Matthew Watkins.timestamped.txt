[43:57] it's my first time getting to meet your
[43:59] pastor and brother Joel and his family
[44:01] there but I've just certainly felt right
[44:03] at home and uh I love the body of Christ
[44:07] I'm just glad to be part of the same
[44:08] family and uh and I believe that we uh
[44:11] come from different parts of the of the
[44:14] country I'm from South Carolina and
[44:16] you're from Arkansas but you know really
[44:18] truly we're not really from either place
[44:21] but actually our citizenship as Paul
[44:23] said is from above and so that's why we
[44:26] have something in common you know and
[44:28] you find that uh wherever you go and no
[44:30] matter what part of the world you travel
[44:32] in you just have an affinity you feel
[44:35] around Believers and uh brother brandham
[44:37] said what is that he said that's that
[44:39] true you that's that Zoey life inside of
[44:41] both of you amen and so you have
[44:43] something to Fellowship over so if you
[44:45] don't know me I'm brother Matt Watkins
[44:47] this is my first time ever speaking here
[44:50] and and uh and so I just bring you
[44:52] greetings from my father brother Jason
[44:54] Watkins and we're there on the on the
[44:57] east coast and we are about as far east
[44:59] as you can go before you
[45:01] drown so we are just right there in the
[45:04] hot humid South and uh really glad to
[45:07] just uh glad to be here amen and
[45:10] certainly this counted a privilege and
[45:12] an honor to be able to speak to you and
[45:14] and uh and so I get that out of the way
[45:17] just to say I I want to just be able to
[45:19] go right to the word amen I'm just going
[45:21] to pretend like I'm at home preaching
[45:23] and uh won't have any of those firsttime
[45:25] Blues
[45:27] preaching at a church so if you love the
[45:29] word then I got something in common with
[45:31] you because I do too amen and so we just
[45:34] want to uh be used of the Lord Jesus
[45:36] amen this morning I wonder if um if you
[45:38] have your Bible you could just turn to
[45:40] judges actually Numbers chapter 33 first
[45:43] and then we'll look at the Book of
[45:44] Judges amen Numbers chapter
[45:50] 33 and I just want to
[45:53] um minister to you this morning on
[45:56] something the Lord just brought back
[45:58] some inspiration to me just here
[46:00] recently spoke this just recently and
[46:03] you know when you go and travel
[46:05] somewhere and you Minister there's uh
[46:07] you know there's so many things that
[46:09] you're nervous about and you're uh
[46:12] you're you're waiting over and talking
[46:13] to the Lord and and uh you just there's
[46:16] anything let me just say that anything I
[46:18] would say today would be good and ain't
[46:21] because I'm a good preacher it's because
[46:23] the word we preach from is just a good
[46:25] word and anything you could preach would
[46:27] be good and be beneficial but I just
[46:30] want to say Lord out of everything that
[46:32] I could say today could you just use me
[46:35] to come and speak to a an individual
[46:38] amen an individual heart and so I I
[46:41] didn't brother Ben didn't give me the
[46:43] the rap He didn't sit me down and tell
[46:45] me give me all the notes things he wants
[46:46] me to preach on or say or give me any
[46:49] kind of intel on anybody and uh and I'm
[46:51] glad for that as an evangelist you come
[46:54] and you got to you got to you're lucky
[46:55] because you don't know any body don't
[46:57] know anything you can say what you want
[46:59] to say and uh and then brother Ben will
[47:02] pick up the pieces when you
[47:03] leave but um but I really want to be
[47:06] used of the holy spirit this morning and
[47:09] I believe he he uh he has something he
[47:11] wants to say Amen I'm going to minister
[47:14] to you and I'm going to title this
[47:16] called out of judges and into Ruth
[47:20] called out of judges and into Ruth
[47:23] Numbers chapter 33 and we'll just begin
[47:25] reading here down in Bible there at the
[47:27] very bottom at verse 51 we'll begin
[47:32] reading this is the Lord speaking
[47:35] through
[47:36] Moses and he speaks to Moses and he says
[47:38] this in the plains of Moab right by
[47:41] Jordan near Jericho so it's right before
[47:43] they cross over and he says speak unto
[47:46] the children of Israel and say unto them
[47:48] when you are passed over Jordan into the
[47:51] land of Canaan then you shall drive out
[47:54] all the inhabitants of the land from
[47:56] before for you and destroy all their
[47:58] pictures and destroy all their molten
[48:01] images and quite pluck down all their
[48:04] high places and you shall dispossess the
[48:08] inhabitants of the land and dwell
[48:10] therein and notice the colon there in
[48:12] your Bible it's a conditional promise
[48:15] for I have given you the land to possess
[48:19] it so we know it's a
[48:21] promise and he says in ver verse 54 you
[48:24] shall divide it then in verse 55 says
[48:27] but if you will not drive out the
[48:29] inhabitants of the land from before you
[48:32] then it shall come to pass that those
[48:34] which you let remain of them shall be
[48:38] Pricks in your eyes and thorns in your
[48:43] sides now I couldn't imagine anything
[48:45] much more painful than a thorn in my eye
[48:49] prick in my eye thorn in my side and he
[48:51] says they'll become Pricks in your eyes
[48:53] and thorns in your sides and shall Vex
[48:56] you in the land wherein you dwell
[48:59] moreover it shall come to pass that I
[49:01] shall do unto you as I thought to do
[49:04] unto them look at Judges chapter one
[49:07] just look straight over there and we'll
[49:09] just read a few verses and have you be
[49:11] seated now I'm going to do something
[49:13] that our church at home loves this thing
[49:15] brother Ben it's a little onh hour timer
[49:18] on my
[49:19] watch praise the
[49:22] Lord see at my church they all set
[49:24] timers with me though and make sure
[49:26] you're not pausing that thing are
[49:28] you but U helps me to keep track of my
[49:31] time and so uh when Siri says I'm I'm
[49:34] over then I'm done then we'll we'll try
[49:36] to quit and when it stops I just tell
[49:38] our church we've stepped into
[49:43] eternity I'm just kidding don't
[49:46] worry Judges chapter 1 let's just begin
[49:50] reading here at verse 20 now this is the
[49:52] the record of of all the instruction
[49:55] everything that you had seen before and
[49:57] I just want to I'm going to just jump
[49:59] through a lot of this because I've
[50:00] spoken this in many parts and I don't I
[50:02] just want to feel what the Lord wants me
[50:05] to say today and then we'll move on but
[50:07] I want you to notice that he records
[50:09] this in numbers through a prophet you've
[50:10] got a promise you've got a prophet
[50:12] you've got instructions what more really
[50:14] do you need but the Bible records the
[50:17] record of these families these tribes of
[50:21] the victory or the defeat that took
[50:23] place in their life and he records this
[50:26] beginning we'll just be begin reading
[50:28] here at verse 21 and the children of
[50:30] Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites
[50:33] that inhabited Jerusalem but the
[50:35] jebusites dwell with the children of
[50:37] Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day
[50:39] meaning the day that it was written
[50:41] verse 27 and neither did Manasseh drive
[50:44] out the inhabitants of Beth Sheen and
[50:46] her towns nor tanic and her towns nor
[50:50] the inhabitant of door in her towns
[50:52] notice move on down to verse 29 neither
[50:55] did Ephraim drive out the can Canaanites
[50:57] verse 30 neither did Zebulon verse 31
[51:00] neither did Asher verse 32 verse 33
[51:03] neither did Nepali and he goes all the
[51:05] way down of this list of partial Victory
[51:10] now remember that brother bham said that
[51:12] the the Canaan is not a type of the
[51:14] Millennium because there's still war
[51:17] right and so this was a record of the
[51:20] promise of or The Inheritance that God
[51:22] had promised them and then when they go
[51:24] over under the instructions the word of
[51:27] the prophet and they go under to take
[51:29] Victory and this is the record of what
[51:30] Tak takes place and what you find is a
[51:33] very sad picture that actually outside
[51:35] of Caleb that there was none of them
[51:38] that really fully possessed what God had
[51:42] given them and he comes down in Judges
[51:45] chapter 2 this is where we're just going
[51:46] to pick up our context here and I just
[51:49] we'll have you be seated Judges chapter
[51:51] 2 and an angel camea from the Lord came
[51:53] up from gilgal to bokeum and said I made
[51:55] you to go up out of Egypt
[51:57] eypt and brought you into the land which
[51:59] I sworn to your father and said I will
[52:01] never break my Covenant with you you
[52:03] shall make no league with inhabitants of
[52:05] this land you shall throw it on their
[52:06] altars but you've not obeyed my voice
[52:08] why have you done this wherefore I also
[52:11] said I will not drive them out from
[52:13] before you but they shall be as thorns
[52:15] in your sides and their gods shall be a
[52:18] snare unto you notice that lowercase
[52:21] gods and their gods shall be a snare or
[52:25] a trap and he says in the people in
[52:27] verse four when the angel of the Lord
[52:30] spoke these words un the children of
[52:31] Israel when the that the people lifted
[52:33] up their voice and wept called the name
[52:35] of the place bokeum and they sacrificed
[52:38] there unto the Lord Lord Jesus we just
[52:41] bow our heads before you asking for your
[52:44] Divine
[52:45] help now Lord how greatly I need you
[52:48] this morning Lord I'm no one nobody
[52:52] father I consider myself Lord the most
[52:55] unworthy Lord the least among these Lord
[52:58] that I speak to today God I I think
[53:02] about how many needs Lord is in my own
[53:05] family at my home Church lord it's just
[53:08] a mirror of I know no doubt there's many
[53:10] needs Lord here there's many mothers and
[53:13] fathers and husbands and wives and the
[53:15] pastor and the preachers and the whole
[53:18] body Lord we're all just your children
[53:20] Lord and if I could say we're all a
[53:22] needy people Lord if we ever needed you
[53:25] we need you right now
[53:27] yes I pray God that you would move me
[53:28] out of the way take this thought Lord
[53:30] that you've placed upon my heart God I
[53:33] just become subservient Lord now to your
[53:36] spirit I move myself completely out of
[53:39] the way Lord and I'll just follow your
[53:41] lead may you come and and feed your
[53:44] children we ask it we ask it in the name
[53:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you
[53:50] can be
[53:53] seated the prophet of God says here in
[53:55] the message Redeemer and Redemption and
[53:59] this is quoting actually uh this is the
[54:02] the third slide brother if you're going
[54:03] to follow me you could display that if
[54:05] they have that he says during the time
[54:07] of the judges when the first thing there
[54:10] come a time when Israel got away from
[54:12] God when they did the water supply was
[54:16] withheld and when people get away from
[54:18] God today the water supply is withheld
[54:22] and all other blessings will be withheld
[54:26] held it's amazing I don't have time so
[54:29] much today but it's incredible really if
[54:32] you go home and you read and study the
[54:33] Book of Judges you'll find this phase or
[54:36] this this this uh spot where we know
[54:39] that brother Bon shows us that God LED
[54:41] them through prophets and then through
[54:43] priests and then through Kings and this
[54:45] was that Port that portion or that phase
[54:48] that he's leading them through judges
[54:50] now that word judge is not judicial as
[54:53] you would think of a judge who would sit
[54:55] and pride over the Affairs of men but
[54:58] actually that English word is savior
[55:01] it's the same word we use for Jesus
[55:03] saves it just means delivers and so
[55:06] these men that God put over them was a
[55:09] time where God would deliver them from
[55:12] their oppressors we find this actually
[55:14] if you just look and you could just do a
[55:16] quick study in slide number two brother
[55:18] I'm not controlling it I have some of
[55:20] these but the king of Jericho would be
[55:22] an oppressor and then God would send oel
[55:25] king of Moab would come and and he would
[55:26] send a man named Ehud the ammonites and
[55:29] he would have a shamgar we all know that
[55:31] story The amalekites and he would send a
[55:33] Deborah or baric the Philistines with
[55:35] Gideon you also know the story of Samson
[55:38] and abdden and all these men that the
[55:40] Bible records and we notice that it was
[55:43] actually something as the prophet of God
[55:45] said everything in the Old Testament was
[55:48] a shadow or a type of something that
[55:50] would have a greater fulfillment as
[55:52] God's plan unfolds you see history is
[55:56] all God's plan all right in fact history
[55:58] just means his story and so it was all
[56:01] the unfolding story of God's Redemptive
[56:04] plan from the beginning and everything
[56:06] that's included in that both righteous
[56:08] deeds and unrighteous Deeds evil men and
[56:11] righteous men as the Bible says in the
[56:13] Apostle Paul says in the house of God
[56:15] are many vessels some to honor some to
[56:18] dishonor he points to pharaoh and says
[56:20] for such a purpose I've risen thee up
[56:23] and so all of everything that's happened
[56:24] from the beginning of time has been
[56:27] God's history or God's story and we
[56:30] notice that the prophet further tells us
[56:32] about the Book of Judges that the Old
[56:35] Testament had Church ages seven just
[56:38] like the Gentile Church in a shadow the
[56:41] old in the ages would have a greater
[56:44] fulfillment how many knows that that the
[56:47] prophet said that everything that you
[56:48] read has compound meaning and so we know
[56:51] they would have an application at that
[56:54] time when it was written but it would
[56:55] actually
[56:56] have a greater fulfillment or a greater
[56:59] application as Paul says these things
[57:01] were written for our examples of whom
[57:03] the ends of the Earth have come and so
[57:06] God moving towards his promise or moving
[57:09] towards his plan so you can always see
[57:11] that what God was doing in this Book of
[57:13] Judges as we find would just be a
[57:16] pattern that would actually play out
[57:18] through history it's incredible because
[57:20] if you go and study the Book of Judges
[57:22] you'll find one Keith refrain that is
[57:25] repeated it over and over and you'll
[57:27] find it in judges beginning in judges 16
[57:30] you'll find it in chapter 17 you'll find
[57:32] it in chapter 18 and it's this one verse
[57:35] that says in those days there was no
[57:39] King and so the people did that which
[57:42] was right in their own eyes friends I
[57:46] don't know of anything that could be
[57:48] more uh applicable or a description of
[57:52] the world that we currently live in
[57:54] right now to where the world has lost
[57:57] their absolutes it's a world to where
[58:00] their their own moral compass or their
[58:02] own uh what they think is right and you
[58:05] could say that that's the ENT what's
[58:07] leading the world today is is a spirit
[58:09] to say don't tell me what to do I'll do
[58:11] what I want to do if don't tell me how
[58:13] to live I'll live how I want to live and
[58:15] and people have gone crazy the world's
[58:17] gone crazy a man doesn't know what a man
[58:20] is a woman doesn't know what a woman is
[58:22] schools don't know which bathroom to use
[58:24] it's a world and I know I'm preaching to
[58:26] you these are kind of things that aren't
[58:28] just at home in South Carolina they're
[58:30] they're here in Arkansas they're WR down
[58:32] I don't care where you from listen I'm
[58:34] I'm glad I'll be honest with you as I
[58:36] travel the the the the you know the
[58:38] North America and all through the world
[58:40] I'm glad I was born in the United States
[58:43] of America I'll be further and say I was
[58:45] glad I was born in the South and I hope
[58:47] that's not offensive to anybody but I am
[58:49] I go places and I'm really glad I'm born
[58:51] in the what they call the Bible Belt and
[58:53] you got churches you know but let me
[58:55] just stop here and say that it doesn't
[58:57] matter now where you go doesn't matter
[59:00] what sea you're on doesn't matter what
[59:02] Coast you're in doesn't matter what
[59:04] country you're from the tidal wave of
[59:07] the depravity of mankind has spread from
[59:10] sea to
[59:11] Sea and the entire world the Bible says
[59:14] in Revelations that they have dranken
[59:16] from the wrath of her fornication
[59:18] they've they've became intoxicated this
[59:20] is the age that you live in it's an age
[59:22] to where the minds of men have they've
[59:25] lost their mind
[59:26] it's a neurotic age and you deal with it
[59:28] every single day and so I'm getting away
[59:31] from my notes and and to be honest I'm
[59:33] the most comfortable when I'm away from
[59:36] them but let me just say that it's it's
[59:39] a world that's completely lost their
[59:40] mind they they they and and they've
[59:43] they've went insane and you say brother
[59:45] Matt why why did that happen I'll tell
[59:46] you why it happened because a white
[59:49] house is not controlling the world a a
[59:52] president is not controlling anything
[59:54] people vote and that's fine but let me
[59:55] just say that there's one thing that
[59:58] controls history and it's a book of
[1:00:00] Prophecy that they've rejected and
[1:00:03] kicked out of their schools and kicked
[1:00:04] out of our society and they don't
[1:00:07] realize it's the very thing that is
[1:00:09] controlling World in modern
[1:00:11] events and so we know that this this
[1:00:14] this time of Judges was actually it was
[1:00:17] like as brother the prophet of God
[1:00:18] points to the church ages through the
[1:00:20] Old Testament and actually if you go
[1:00:22] study that Book of Judges you'll see
[1:00:24] that that refrains repeats over and over
[1:00:27] that everybody did that which was right
[1:00:29] I'm going to just read it to you in
[1:00:31] judges 17:6 in those days there was no
[1:00:34] King and every man did that which was
[1:00:36] right in his own eyes and so that's the
[1:00:38] key that you can find in the Book of
[1:00:40] Judges it's a constant message that's
[1:00:42] repeated and in fact you'll find that
[1:00:45] there's a pattern we're going to look at
[1:00:46] it here let me not get a too far ahead
[1:00:48] of myself but let's look at it here in
[1:00:51] Judges chapter 2 if you have your Bible
[1:00:52] just follow along with me here for a
[1:00:54] moment and the Bible says in verse 7 if
[1:00:57] you could just turn up this one right
[1:00:58] here brother I'm not I don't hear so
[1:01:00] well on my right side but if the left
[1:01:02] side if they have it that'd be wonderful
[1:01:04] just a little more notice in verse 7 and
[1:01:06] the people serve the Lord all the day so
[1:01:09] you know what you have here is God tells
[1:01:11] them you know that that that you didn't
[1:01:13] drive out and because of that because of
[1:01:15] the failure of one generation it's going
[1:01:18] to become the curse of the Next
[1:01:21] Generation and actually that's always a
[1:01:24] pattern that you'll find as the that the
[1:01:26] failure of the preceding generation or
[1:01:29] the victory that they could get would
[1:01:31] very likely determine how much Victory
[1:01:33] the next would get John Wesley said
[1:01:35] something so powerful he said what one
[1:01:38] generation tolerates the next generation
[1:01:40] will embrace you could find it in
[1:01:43] history because it's it's a repeating
[1:01:45] pattern as the old poet says the the
[1:01:47] people are doomed to repeat history
[1:01:49] because they never learn from history
[1:01:52] and so it's a repeating pattern that
[1:01:54] always continues to repeat that that it
[1:01:56] was in the days of Judges that they so
[1:01:59] God God tells them because you didn't
[1:02:00] get Victory because you didn't drive
[1:02:03] them out because you didn't complete
[1:02:05] have a complete Victory and you stopped
[1:02:07] short of the promise of God because of
[1:02:09] that it's going to come to pass that
[1:02:11] those things which you let remain are
[1:02:13] going to be Pricks in your eyes and
[1:02:15] thorns in your sides and shall Vex you
[1:02:18] now these were not ungodly people this
[1:02:20] was actually the same group of people
[1:02:23] that came out of Egypt on under a
[1:02:26] prophet through God's word through God's
[1:02:29] prophet and notice in Judges chapter 2
[1:02:32] God says you have not
[1:02:34] obeyed my voice that's right now God
[1:02:38] never said nothing but through a prophet
[1:02:40] God actually equates the instructions
[1:02:42] through Moses as his own voice and says
[1:02:46] when you heard from Moses you were
[1:02:47] hearing from my heart right and you've
[1:02:50] not obeyed my voice why have you done
[1:02:55] this yes it's incredible because you
[1:02:58] watch as this story unfolds they begin
[1:03:01] to cry they weep they make a sacrifice
[1:03:04] and the Bible says something so amazing
[1:03:06] that it says in verse 10 Joshua in verse
[1:03:09] 8 Dies they bury him in verse 9 in verse
[1:03:12] 10 that generation were gathered un
[1:03:14] their fathers and there arose another
[1:03:18] generation after them so the curse that
[1:03:23] God
[1:03:24] pronounces actually
[1:03:26] people live their entire life and they
[1:03:29] never see the Fulfillment of that curse
[1:03:33] that's right it's not until the next
[1:03:36] generation of young
[1:03:38] people who are raised in the message and
[1:03:42] the Bible says that there raises up an
[1:03:44] entire generation which knew not the
[1:03:48] Lord which knew not the works which he
[1:03:51] had done and they the children of Israel
[1:03:54] served did even in the sight of the Lord
[1:03:56] and served balam notice this and they
[1:03:59] forsook the Lord God of their
[1:04:03] fathers come on yeah I mean if we listen
[1:04:06] friends remember this is just a shadow
[1:04:09] this is just a repeating pattern because
[1:04:12] what you'll find in judges is a circle
[1:04:16] yeah come on and you'll notice that I'm
[1:04:19] preaching to you on caught out of judges
[1:04:21] and into Ruth right come on because
[1:04:23] you'll notice that judges is actually
[1:04:25] actually a pattern that repeats yes to
[1:04:28] where God would send them a deliverer
[1:04:31] right they would they would come under
[1:04:33] Revival under that deliverer and then
[1:04:36] when that deliverer would die or that
[1:04:38] judge the Bible says the Bible says they
[1:04:41] would then begin to sin again they would
[1:04:43] go back into bondage worse than the
[1:04:45] first time and then they would come to a
[1:04:47] stage of repentance and God would send
[1:04:49] another deliverer and then there would
[1:04:51] be Revival and then that Revival that
[1:04:54] judge would die and then they would go
[1:04:56] back into sin and then back to slavery
[1:04:58] and then back you can see it's just a
[1:05:00] circle from revival to the death of the
[1:05:03] judge to repentance to sin back to
[1:05:06] slavery back to corruption back to
[1:05:08] Revival and if you study the Book of
[1:05:11] Judges you'll find something incredible
[1:05:14] that that cycle of Revival and death
[1:05:18] repeats seven times that's right and
[1:05:22] it's incredible when you think of that
[1:05:24] correlation as brother in the Ephesian
[1:05:26] Church age shows us that pattern in the
[1:05:28] ages and he says the Ephesian age was
[1:05:31] just like Israel yeah and he says that
[1:05:34] they demanded a king to be like other
[1:05:36] nations when they did that they rejected
[1:05:38] God but that's the history of the church
[1:05:39] notice this so that entire generation
[1:05:42] raises up the Bible says they don't know
[1:05:45] the Lord they forsook the Lord God of
[1:05:46] their fathers and they said they served
[1:05:48] Bell and asero and notice in verse 14
[1:05:51] the Ang Lord was hot against them and he
[1:05:53] delivered them the hand of their
[1:05:54] spoilers verse 15 whatsoever they went
[1:05:57] the hand of the Lord was against them
[1:05:58] for evil verse 16 nevertheless the Lord
[1:06:02] raised up judges oh yes and yet they
[1:06:06] would not verse 17 hearken under their
[1:06:08] judge but they went a whoring after
[1:06:10] other gods and bowed themselves unto
[1:06:13] them they turned quickly out of the ways
[1:06:16] of their father which their fathers
[1:06:17] walked in obeying the Commandments of
[1:06:20] the Lord but they did not so in verse 18
[1:06:22] says and when the Lord raised up judges
[1:06:26] then the Lord was with that judge oh yes
[1:06:30] notice this and he says when the Lord
[1:06:33] raised up judges the Lord was with that
[1:06:36] judge and delivered them out of the hand
[1:06:38] of the enemy all the
[1:06:41] days of the
[1:06:44] judge and so we see this pattern I know
[1:06:46] I don't have to go through so much
[1:06:49] Foundation because you're Believers here
[1:06:50] today but you know that a prophet shows
[1:06:52] us how that under each messenger that
[1:06:55] God would a a trumpet would sound which
[1:06:58] what was that trumpet that was a shout
[1:07:01] or a trumpet a gospel trumpet that the
[1:07:04] prophet said would gather the bride
[1:07:06] under that messenger together right and
[1:07:09] brother bam says but notice what would
[1:07:10] happen that man would die it' go off the
[1:07:13] scene he said and the people God would
[1:07:15] put his bride away the elect of that age
[1:07:17] to sleep and then the people would
[1:07:19] denominate around the man's teachings
[1:07:22] I'm just preaching in what a prophet
[1:07:24] tells you in the church age book and
[1:07:25] they would denominate around that man's
[1:07:27] teaching and brother bham says a plague
[1:07:30] would fall death would settle in and so
[1:07:31] you notice this is exactly what takes
[1:07:33] place in judges that as long as the
[1:07:36] messenger was there as long as the
[1:07:38] Revival under that messenger was there
[1:07:40] there was Revival in the church there
[1:07:42] was Revival in the meetings uh you know
[1:07:44] there there was just a Burning Flame but
[1:07:46] when that messenger leaves then that
[1:07:48] Revival begins to fade the fire begins
[1:07:51] to die and then the people would form a
[1:07:54] denomination around his
[1:07:57] teachings and then brother bam says and
[1:07:59] then that pattern just repeats and so
[1:08:01] notice as long as the judge was alive
[1:08:04] they would serve the Lord the B that's
[1:08:06] what we just read and the Lord is with
[1:08:08] that judge and he says he says all the
[1:08:11] days of the judge notice this here in
[1:08:13] verse 19 and it came to pass this is an
[1:08:16] important word you could preach a sermon
[1:08:18] right here when the judge was dead yeah
[1:08:22] that's right yeah yeah you know what
[1:08:25] never ceases I hope I can just be real
[1:08:27] with you and transparent just be myself
[1:08:30] but it never ceases to amaze me because
[1:08:32] I've witnessed it with my own eyes it's
[1:08:34] so incredible how you watch the lives of
[1:08:37] some people and actually only
[1:08:41] circumstances will reveal what that
[1:08:45] person is actually anchored
[1:08:47] to it's amazing because they can go for
[1:08:51] years and it looks good they look like
[1:08:54] Believers and it's as long as that Papa
[1:08:57] or that Ministry or that father or that
[1:09:00] church as long as they're alive then
[1:09:03] that family looks like Believers dresses
[1:09:06] like Believers talks like Believers
[1:09:07] knows all the good things to say is at
[1:09:09] every
[1:09:11] meeting and it's amazing because I've
[1:09:13] watched it as long as that testimony or
[1:09:15] that judge you would call a pillar I'm
[1:09:18] just going to slow down here for a
[1:09:19] moment because of that pillar and that
[1:09:22] pillar sometimes in a family doesn't
[1:09:24] realize
[1:09:25] what his testimony is
[1:09:27] holding and what will happen is you'll
[1:09:30] always watch people and as long as that
[1:09:33] judge or that father or that preacher or
[1:09:35] whatever it is if they're only anchored
[1:09:38] to the testimony of that
[1:09:42] man and they're never anchored to Christ
[1:09:46] brother random says I'm afraid we're
[1:09:47] getting people to church we're getting
[1:09:50] into a Doctrine we're getting them to an
[1:09:52] idea but we're not getting them to
[1:09:54] Christ yes sir now now I I'll just say
[1:09:57] that that even that word Christ could
[1:09:59] become I hate to say this but a generic
[1:10:01] term because I'm not talking about just
[1:10:04] a Jesus of of of of the of the even
[1:10:06] Jesus of the stories of the Bible it's
[1:10:09] wonderful to know the stories of Jesus
[1:10:11] of the Bible but you got to have an
[1:10:13] anchor that goes further than the
[1:10:16] letter because the letter kth so you got
[1:10:20] to know I'm not just talking about Jesus
[1:10:22] as everybody knows him as Jesus of
[1:10:24] Nazareth I'm talking about the the
[1:10:26] Christ who was revealed in this
[1:10:29] generation and when a person never meets
[1:10:32] that
[1:10:33] Christ then watch what happens to
[1:10:35] people's lives when that judge dies what
[1:10:39] it reveals is is that their testimony
[1:10:41] was only ever anchored to that man or
[1:10:43] that Ministry or that church and when
[1:10:46] that man falls away or leaves the
[1:10:48] message or leaves the church and you
[1:10:50] watch I'll just go and preach it here
[1:10:52] you watch how people are they you know
[1:10:53] that they it's incredible because the
[1:10:55] church almost gives a life of its
[1:10:58] own and it can deceive many people to
[1:11:00] think that they're actually connected to
[1:11:02] to Christ when they're really only
[1:11:04] living off the life of the church and
[1:11:06] you'll always notice it because as long
[1:11:08] as the church is good to them then
[1:11:10] Christ is good to them then they love
[1:11:13] Jesus and they're going to heaven and
[1:11:15] you know they they they want the Lord
[1:11:16] but watch when that church is not good
[1:11:18] to them when that church fails them
[1:11:20] because churches will fail you and
[1:11:23] people will fail you and pastors will
[1:11:26] fail you and let me go further fathers
[1:11:29] will fail you I failed my children many
[1:11:32] times I'll just be honest and and and
[1:11:35] and you watch whenever that the if they
[1:11:37] only anchor to that then the second that
[1:11:40] that whatever that is fails them then
[1:11:42] they don't just leave the church they
[1:11:44] leave
[1:11:48] everything it's sort of like a boat
[1:11:50] that's floating on the tide you always
[1:11:52] you're fine you know when you're there
[1:11:54] anchored I've been on the Buford River
[1:11:56] many times and man when you're anchored
[1:11:58] you don't even notice that there's a
[1:12:00] tide you don't even notice that there's
[1:12:02] a current but you pull up that anchor
[1:12:04] let that anchor get pulled up one time
[1:12:06] and it may not look like much at first
[1:12:08] but after about five minutes you realize
[1:12:10] hey I'm a little further from the bridge
[1:12:12] having to cast a little further what's
[1:12:14] going on here what you don't realize is
[1:12:16] that your anchor has been pulled oh come
[1:12:19] on your anchor has been pulled and
[1:12:23] you're just drifting down the
[1:12:26] die and I've watched people in their
[1:12:28] lives and and as long as the Papa was
[1:12:31] there and he believed the message but
[1:12:32] Watch What Happens the second that that
[1:12:34] judge dies then suddenly they look like
[1:12:37] Believers for a little
[1:12:39] while and then they start to change
[1:12:42] their manner of dress their
[1:12:46] attitudes their
[1:12:49] behavior they become relaxed drifting
[1:12:53] that's what Ephesus means relaxed and
[1:12:56] drifting come on and then you watch
[1:12:59] after a while poof they're
[1:13:03] gone and you say what
[1:13:05] happened this is the pattern of
[1:13:08] Judges that as long as the judge was
[1:13:11] alive listen to what brother random says
[1:13:12] here this is the Ephesian Church age
[1:13:15] prophet of God said now history keeps
[1:13:19] repeating itself notice I got these in
[1:13:21] Red so that you can just catch them
[1:13:24] history keeps repeating itself in the
[1:13:28] generation of Israel we see Revival in
[1:13:31] one
[1:13:32] generation only to see the fires
[1:13:35] fading right so this is the pattern it's
[1:13:39] the same exact pattern as judges brother
[1:13:40] random says you see Revival in one
[1:13:42] generation only to see the fires
[1:13:45] fading and in the Next Generation
[1:13:48] brother bandam says in the third
[1:13:50] generation Embers may be glowing
[1:13:52] slightly but in the fourth
[1:13:55] there may be no vestage
[1:13:57] whatsoever of that original
[1:13:59] flame then God lights the fire again and
[1:14:05] the same
[1:14:08] process is repeated notice what he says
[1:14:12] here some of the and I I could preach
[1:14:15] about a Revival of a church of an age of
[1:14:18] a of I don't care what you but how about
[1:14:20] we talk about our own here today how
[1:14:22] about we point the microscope just a
[1:14:24] little further than just
[1:14:25] generally and say Lord shine a light
[1:14:27] down right here where are you at this
[1:14:30] morning because you notice brother
[1:14:32] Brandon gives you the signs or the
[1:14:34] symptoms of a Dying Revival brother bam
[1:14:38] says the fervent desire to please God oh
[1:14:41] my the passion the passion oh
[1:14:47] my the passion to know his
[1:14:52] word the cry
[1:14:55] for reaching out in the
[1:14:57] spirit all begins to
[1:14:59] fade and instead of that church being on
[1:15:02] fire with the fire of God it's cooled
[1:15:04] off and became a bit formal that's what
[1:15:07] was happening back there to the
[1:15:10] Ephesians that second generation coming
[1:15:13] on was just like Israel they demanded a
[1:15:16] king to be like other nations the
[1:15:18] prophet says when they did that they
[1:15:20] rejected God but they did it anyway that
[1:15:24] is the
[1:15:26] history of the
[1:15:28] church now I'm not talking about neither
[1:15:31] is the prophet talking about the bride
[1:15:34] notice the the separation here this
[1:15:36] isn't the history of the elected this is
[1:15:39] the pattern of the
[1:15:41] church because you notice what you'll
[1:15:43] find is is the brother bam says that God
[1:15:45] at the seventh age notice I'm just going
[1:15:47] to go off my notes Here for a moment
[1:15:49] that in the first age it was the Alpha
[1:15:51] and the prophet said that was Christ
[1:15:53] that was what it Paul had he had the
[1:15:55] abstract the token zoy life he had the
[1:15:58] abstract the full abstract to the title
[1:16:00] sir and brother baram says but notice in
[1:16:02] that first age the alpha it was all
[1:16:04] Christ but he said through the age of
[1:16:06] the reformers through the age through
[1:16:09] the church ages the prophet said they
[1:16:11] had dips of the Holy Ghost but he says
[1:16:14] it wasn't all
[1:16:16] Christ right that's why Luther could
[1:16:19] smoke a pipe believe in a trinity and
[1:16:22] God could wink at that ignorance come on
[1:16:25] because brother Bram says they could
[1:16:27] only serve him under the strength that's
[1:16:30] my word not his they could only serve
[1:16:32] him under the strength of the word or
[1:16:36] the token life that had been released
[1:16:39] for that age right and brother bham says
[1:16:42] that notice here in those middle in
[1:16:44] those ages he said it was all the the
[1:16:46] first was all Christ under that Alpha
[1:16:49] but in those under that Reformation the
[1:16:51] prophet says and Paul says in
[1:16:53] Corinthians that God in times past has
[1:16:55] winked at the ignorance but now he
[1:16:59] requireth that all men repent in other
[1:17:02] words what are you saying brother Matt
[1:17:04] what I'm saying to you is you are not
[1:17:06] living under a partial releasing of the
[1:17:10] token Life of Christ but actually at the
[1:17:13] crucifixion of the word in this
[1:17:15] generation would produce the same power
[1:17:19] oh come on somebody help me Preach Today
[1:17:22] brother baram says that under that token
[1:17:24] light and I'm getting away way way way
[1:17:26] far away but I'm just going to preach
[1:17:28] that brother bam says that notice that
[1:17:31] that that token the prophet says that
[1:17:33] when that believer took that lamb into
[1:17:35] his home and he would go through that
[1:17:37] 14-day inspection period and the prophet
[1:17:40] links that 14 days of inspection to the
[1:17:43] ages to the age of the reformers that
[1:17:46] they didn't have the Zoe life all they
[1:17:50] had was the lamb before it was crucified
[1:17:53] before it was slain
[1:17:55] but brother brandom says but in the
[1:17:57] evening
[1:17:58] time it wasn't going to be an inspection
[1:18:01] of a lamb just looking at his word and
[1:18:03] looking at what maybe they probed at or
[1:18:05] thought what a Believer looked like or
[1:18:07] thought what the Holy Ghost was they
[1:18:09] thought it was a gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:11] they thought it was speaking in tongues
[1:18:12] and it is as part part of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:15] is the gifts of the Spirit but you can
[1:18:17] have his gifts and not have
[1:18:20] him you can have his word and not even
[1:18:23] have him brother bam says you might
[1:18:26] speak in tongues you might not you can
[1:18:28] have but listen friends what came in
[1:18:29] this generation was not just going to be
[1:18:32] another dress code or a Doctrine or a
[1:18:35] thinking or some kind of intellectual
[1:18:37] knowledge or even a what what was going
[1:18:40] to come was not just some outpouring of
[1:18:42] emotion but it was going to be the life
[1:18:46] of the Lamb would come back on the
[1:18:50] believer and the Very Zoey token literal
[1:18:53] Life of Christ
[1:18:55] that's why brother brandom could say
[1:18:57] it's not just a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] it is the Holy Ghost
[1:19:04] himself and so notice this here it was
[1:19:07] it was under those ages that brother bam
[1:19:10] says that you notice here and let's just
[1:19:12] pick it up how the prophet says it he
[1:19:14] says that second generation coming
[1:19:16] almost just like Israel that's the
[1:19:18] history of the church it isn't long
[1:19:21] until you see them stop doing things
[1:19:24] that
[1:19:27] they and start doing things they
[1:19:31] wouldn't do
[1:19:34] initially they change their manner of
[1:19:37] dress isn't it so incredible that some
[1:19:41] of the first things people do when they
[1:19:42] leave the message is they change their
[1:19:45] manner of
[1:19:48] dress I know it seemed so simple friends
[1:19:50] but I don't believe it's really that
[1:19:52] simple as simple as you think it is you
[1:19:54] see to a person who doesn't have a
[1:19:56] revelation of Christ then the message is
[1:19:59] just dos and don'ts and rules of what
[1:20:01] you don't do and you don't do and you
[1:20:02] don't do and you don't do but what do
[1:20:05] you
[1:20:05] do if all we have is a rule book of dos
[1:20:08] and don'ts and that's the sad part about
[1:20:10] many people is they get cleaned up the
[1:20:13] Bible says they get clean they get empty
[1:20:15] but they never get filled and one of the
[1:20:18] most dangerous spots you can be as a
[1:20:20] Christian as a person is a person who's
[1:20:22] clean but empty in fact Jesus says you
[1:20:26] were better dirty and full of sin than
[1:20:29] to be clean but empty that's right isn't
[1:20:33] that incredible true that when the
[1:20:35] unclean Spirit leaves a man it goes into
[1:20:37] dry places and he cometh and find the
[1:20:39] house swept notice there's nothing more
[1:20:41] dangerous to a Believer than being
[1:20:43] cleaned up but not
[1:20:46] full and you become a negative Christian
[1:20:49] what does that mean that means I don't
[1:20:50] do this and I don't do that and I don't
[1:20:52] do this and I don't do that and I don't
[1:20:53] go here and I don't do do that I don't
[1:20:55] wear that I don't watch
[1:20:57] that you have all of the you you've
[1:21:00] removed the pleasure of
[1:21:02] sin come on but you don't have any joy
[1:21:05] of the Holy
[1:21:07] Spirit come on and Jesus says that the
[1:21:11] condition of that man is
[1:21:13] worse than before the spirit left the
[1:21:16] man that's right that's why the older
[1:21:19] brother to the prodical son was in a
[1:21:21] worse condition than the prodical son
[1:21:22] living with pigs yeah and he was at
[1:21:25] church his whole
[1:21:26] life and he said Lord I've done all
[1:21:29] these things and and notice what happens
[1:21:30] the second that his brother comes home
[1:21:32] he gets mad and gets angry at all the
[1:21:34] music and shouting and
[1:21:36] dancing and he says what is this I hear
[1:21:38] my stinking rotten low down good for
[1:21:40] nothing brother and I was here father
[1:21:43] this is go read this in luk the book of
[1:21:44] Book of Luke and he says I was here the
[1:21:46] whole time I was in church I never
[1:21:49] transgressed thy commandment what was it
[1:21:51] that was older brother syndrome who was
[1:21:53] clean from sin but empty of the Holy
[1:21:57] Ghost on and I've done all these things
[1:21:59] and I've never transgressed your
[1:22:01] commandment and I was at church every
[1:22:03] Sunday and I I paid my TI and I I was
[1:22:06] there every time Dad I was I never
[1:22:08] failed you I never went out like this
[1:22:10] but and he notice he says but the second
[1:22:12] that this my
[1:22:14] brother who's been living in sin in the
[1:22:17] filth of sin right the second he comes
[1:22:20] home you put a ring on his
[1:22:22] finger and put a clo SM on him and you
[1:22:25] kill the fatted
[1:22:28] calf ain't that how some people are they
[1:22:31] can't get they get so upset when someone
[1:22:33] has the joy of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:38] come and notice what the father says he
[1:22:41] says my son you have been ever with me
[1:22:44] and all of these things have been here
[1:22:47] the whole
[1:22:48] time in other words Revival was always
[1:22:51] for you but you never made your availed
[1:22:53] yourself to it the joy of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:55] was always there but you never availed
[1:22:57] yourself to it the fatted calf was
[1:23:00] always here we could have always had it
[1:23:03] come
[1:23:03] on and notice this here this brother
[1:23:06] Adam says they change their attitudes
[1:23:08] and their behavior they get lack that's
[1:23:11] what Ephesus means relaxed and drifting
[1:23:15] notice I know you know this very well he
[1:23:17] says that cycle next slide of Revival
[1:23:22] and death has never ever
[1:23:26] failed I have this here and you can go
[1:23:28] to the next slide and we don't have to
[1:23:29] teach on this too much but I'll to show
[1:23:31] you that actually for seven years this
[1:23:34] pattern repeats from sin to slavery to
[1:23:39] repentance and then to
[1:23:42] deliverance and actually you go through
[1:23:45] the entire Book of Judges and I couldn't
[1:23:48] even today read you the entire book you
[1:23:51] have to go read it for yourself if you
[1:23:53] go read the End of This Book it's a
[1:23:57] horror story and it's not a record of
[1:24:00] the bites it's not a record of the
[1:24:03] amorites it's a record of the
[1:24:06] Israelites and their life becomes into
[1:24:09] such chaos hold on come on because they
[1:24:12] lived and I just want to preach here for
[1:24:14] a moment they lived in that judges cycle
[1:24:18] yeah come that judges pattern that ever
[1:24:20] repeats over and over and over and over
[1:24:23] again it just continues to repeat every
[1:24:26] man did that which was right in his own
[1:24:28] eyes if it feels right must be right if
[1:24:31] it looks right must be right and what's
[1:24:35] right for you might not be right for me
[1:24:37] but what's right for me is what's right
[1:24:38] for me your truth may be your truth but
[1:24:41] my truth is my truth and we might both
[1:24:43] be right well that's not what Jesus
[1:24:48] said and we live in such a pattern to
[1:24:51] where they get in that judges cycle and
[1:24:53] they don't even realize it that their
[1:24:55] life is just and listen friends I'm
[1:24:58] talking about a experience that
[1:25:00] Believers people can get into such a
[1:25:03] condition they don't even realize that
[1:25:05] for 30 years they've been living in a
[1:25:08] circle they've been living in just a
[1:25:10] repeated pattern of good victory here as
[1:25:14] long as there's Revival man they're on
[1:25:16] fire but then the minute that that dies
[1:25:19] they go right back into sin and then
[1:25:21] they go right back into slavery because
[1:25:23] sin always always leads to slavery
[1:25:25] that's true and then they go right back
[1:25:28] into slavery then God comes again and
[1:25:31] special meeting Youth Camp preacher some
[1:25:33] experience Calamity happens crisis takes
[1:25:36] place and man they're at the altar again
[1:25:39] and they're repenting again and they
[1:25:40] live forever on this
[1:25:44] pattern come on and it's a constant
[1:25:47] circle of
[1:25:50] Judges come on you say brother Matt what
[1:25:53] will determine I'm going to tell you
[1:25:54] what would determine it the prophet of
[1:25:56] God said when people get away from the
[1:25:59] word when their lives get away from the
[1:26:02] word they get away from God and the
[1:26:05] water supply is withheld and they can go
[1:26:08] for years I've watched people suffer
[1:26:11] under the listen I'm not talking I'm not
[1:26:13] I'm not talking about uh you know I'm
[1:26:15] talking about good
[1:26:16] people who love the
[1:26:18] Lord but they go in this repeated
[1:26:21] pattern of judges of good times and bad
[1:26:24] times times of up times of down some
[1:26:27] moments of Victory some moments of
[1:26:29] defeat victory in the mountain no
[1:26:32] victory in the Valley come
[1:26:35] on and you watch people live their life
[1:26:38] like a roundabout right and they they
[1:26:40] get on the roundabout of life and they
[1:26:42] go around and around and around and
[1:26:44] around and around and around and they
[1:26:46] they you know that roundabout of life
[1:26:48] when you you know you you you grow up
[1:26:50] and you you get a job and you get a
[1:26:51] career and then you get married and then
[1:26:54] after you get married you have children
[1:26:56] and then you have a home and then you
[1:26:59] get on that roundabout and you you go to
[1:27:01] work and you work eight hours then you
[1:27:03] come home you say hello to the family
[1:27:05] you veg on entertainment you go to bed
[1:27:07] you wake up you go to work you work
[1:27:09] eight hours you come home greet the
[1:27:11] family veg on entertainment you go to
[1:27:13] bed you wake up you work eight hours you
[1:27:15] come home you greet the family you veg
[1:27:18] on entertainment you go to bed you wake
[1:27:19] up you work8 hours you come home and
[1:27:22] then you greet the family then you veg
[1:27:23] and entertainment then you go to bed you
[1:27:25] wake up you work 8 hours you come home
[1:27:28] and you do that for about 30 years then
[1:27:31] you
[1:27:32] retire and then you get off the
[1:27:34] roundabout about where you got
[1:27:38] on and that's life and people go around
[1:27:43] and around and around and around in
[1:27:45] judges and they never come out of judges
[1:27:48] and enter the
[1:27:52] story you see Ruth Life Starts in this
[1:27:57] pattern that's where she's
[1:27:59] from that's her history that's who she
[1:28:03] is that's where she should have
[1:28:05] died that's where her life should have
[1:28:08] just been another tragedy of Judges
[1:28:11] she's a moabit she has no business being
[1:28:13] there with Naomi it's no different than
[1:28:15] the man she marries and her father and
[1:28:17] her mother his mother saw boaz's mother
[1:28:20] and you notice Rahab had no business
[1:28:22] being in the lineage of Christ she
[1:28:25] should have died with the rest of
[1:28:26] Jericho she's just a nobody living on a
[1:28:29] wall prostituting herself there was no
[1:28:32] Torah red in Jericho there was no local
[1:28:35] church she could go to she was just
[1:28:37] another casualty a part of the wicked
[1:28:40] age of lady oia just another Atomic f
[1:28:43] for atomic age but
[1:28:48] Grace but somehow I don't know how you
[1:28:51] say how did she find herself I don't
[1:28:54] know how she found herself what did she
[1:28:56] do brother Matt how do we find her name
[1:28:59] I'm going to tell you how she believed
[1:29:01] the words of the
[1:29:03] messengers she said I know a god I've
[1:29:05] heard about a god listen friends do you
[1:29:08] realize she believed in a God that she
[1:29:11] only ever heard about she'd never seen
[1:29:14] him she'd never talked to him she' never
[1:29:16] sat in church she'd never had the
[1:29:18] opportunities but she believed the words
[1:29:20] of the messenger and the Bible say she
[1:29:23] said give me a true
[1:29:25] token oh and because she believed the
[1:29:27] words of a messenger of Joshua God said
[1:29:31] here's an inside here's a token and that
[1:29:34] token's not just going to be for you
[1:29:36] little Rahab it's going to be for your
[1:29:38] children it's going to be for your daddy
[1:29:40] for your mama for your whole
[1:29:42] family I'm talking about this
[1:29:46] token
[1:29:48] Hallelujah sir she shouldn't have been
[1:29:52] there she had no business being
[1:29:55] there and Ruth had no
[1:29:59] business coming out of
[1:30:01] Judges somehow she finds herself she had
[1:30:05] no business being there she should have
[1:30:07] died with the rest of them oh I think of
[1:30:10] God's Prophet as he sat there on that
[1:30:12] little bank and the brother brandham
[1:30:14] says my family he said the Brams were
[1:30:16] just Fighters and drunks and alcoholics
[1:30:19] my mama and my daddy think about that s
[1:30:21] years old and he's laying there on a
[1:30:24] bank fishing trying to there you know
[1:30:26] thinking about his life he's thinking
[1:30:28] about how the night before he was laying
[1:30:30] on that bank till 3:00 in the morning
[1:30:33] waiting for the party to end at his
[1:30:35] daddy's house laying there on the roof
[1:30:37] of that watching the Moonlight not
[1:30:39] wanted to go home to be around that
[1:30:41] filth say what are you saying brother
[1:30:43] Matt I'm saying that had Satan had his
[1:30:47] way he would have died another
[1:30:51] brandom he would have been just like his
[1:30:53] dad
[1:30:54] he would have been just like his mama he
[1:30:56] would have been just like his history
[1:30:58] he's laying there and brother Von says I
[1:31:01] I was laying there waiting for the music
[1:31:02] to end daddy and mommy says party and
[1:31:05] there the the music and the alcohol
[1:31:07] think about that a little seven eight
[1:31:09] year old boy and he's laying there one
[1:31:12] night and he and he and he and he says
[1:31:14] uh he says there it was in the snow and
[1:31:15] I built me a little fire the next summer
[1:31:18] brother Bam's fishing and he says I I
[1:31:20] look down and he says there I was
[1:31:22] fishing he says I look down thinking of
[1:31:24] about his life and he says and I noticed
[1:31:25] a Little Flower and he says that Little
[1:31:28] Flower came up and I looked and I said
[1:31:30] hey how'd you get there yeah brother Bon
[1:31:34] says you shouldn't be
[1:31:36] here he says I I build a fire over top
[1:31:39] of
[1:31:41] you and he says that should have killed
[1:31:43] you not only that he says uh he says the
[1:31:46] snow was here last here and he says it
[1:31:49] froze you over and he says but look at
[1:31:51] you you made it look at you you're here
[1:31:56] oh my brother my sister look at you look
[1:31:58] at your life you'd be honest there'd be
[1:32:01] anywhere you'd be but in the house of
[1:32:03] God believ in a token message there'd be
[1:32:05] anywhere you should have been any other
[1:32:07] place you should have been another
[1:32:09] statistic of this wicked age but somehow
[1:32:13] you're
[1:32:16] here somehow I want to serve the Lord
[1:32:19] somehow in spite of everything the devil
[1:32:21] has sent in my life I still got to do
[1:32:23] desire to say I want to be like Jesus I
[1:32:26] want to live the word of God in my life
[1:32:29] somehow the prophet of God said I looked
[1:32:32] and said you shouldn't be here Little
[1:32:33] Flower but somehow you're here he said
[1:32:36] at that moment a voice spoke and said
[1:32:38] you are not the son of Charles and El
[1:32:40] brandom but your identity is in Christ
[1:32:44] in another
[1:32:48] dimension had man had his way he would
[1:32:50] have been another random oh
[1:32:54] somehow Grace yes
[1:32:57] sir Ruth you should have died yeah you
[1:33:01] should have been another
[1:33:03] statistic of that roundabout of Life yes
[1:33:08] oh
[1:33:09] my you should have just died there Ruth
[1:33:12] you don't know something so powerful
[1:33:13] brother Joel if you go study the Tanakh
[1:33:16] and you look at a Jewish Bible in your
[1:33:18] Bible Judges and Ruth are two books but
[1:33:21] did you know in the original Hebrew
[1:33:22] Bible judges and Ruth are the same
[1:33:27] book see brother Matt what does that
[1:33:29] mean what I'm trying to tell you is
[1:33:30] they're not two different stories in
[1:33:33] other words your story doesn't have to
[1:33:35] end in
[1:33:38] judges but there's a new
[1:33:41] beginning come on I'm talking about a
[1:33:43] new
[1:33:44] story I'm talking about God rewriting
[1:33:47] your life how the devil would have
[1:33:49] written it and you think of how it would
[1:33:51] have ended and that the the tragedy of
[1:33:53] the end and end but God said no that's
[1:33:55] not how it's going to end I'm going to
[1:33:57] call that little girl out of that judges
[1:33:59] cycle out of the pattern of her daddy
[1:34:01] and her mama and the destruction of her
[1:34:03] family and I'm going to join her to a
[1:34:06] man named Boaz and she's going to come
[1:34:09] off of the circle you see Ruth is not a
[1:34:11] circle Ruth is a straight line you say
[1:34:14] what line brother man it's a path of
[1:34:17] redemption it's a path of the lineage of
[1:34:20] Christ and your identity is not in this
[1:34:22] world that's why why you can't fit in
[1:34:25] that's why you're not comfortable here
[1:34:27] you're only comfortable in the house of
[1:34:29] God worshiping the Holy Ghost because
[1:34:32] that's who you really
[1:34:39] are loud
[1:34:41] environment I use this as a gauge to
[1:34:44] know whether I'm in the right
[1:34:47] place I get scared when that loud
[1:34:49] warning go doesn't go off brother
[1:34:51] Jo good come on
[1:34:54] sir trying to look at my timer thank you
[1:34:58] Siri notice this here because you'll
[1:35:00] find can we go a little bit
[1:35:02] further you'll find that actually this
[1:35:06] pattern even brother Bron picks this up
[1:35:09] you can find this pattern in jehoash and
[1:35:12] second Kings turn in your Bible if you
[1:35:13] could you can look at it with me too
[1:35:15] I've got actually on the slide verse
[1:35:17] slide nine this is 2 Kings 12 I want you
[1:35:19] to notice because what you're going to
[1:35:21] find is that just like a father had
[1:35:24] Victory and then a son comes along and
[1:35:27] notice the life of Solomon you're going
[1:35:29] to find something in your Bible that
[1:35:31] Solomon brings in that David never
[1:35:35] brought in you'll never find these
[1:35:37] things under the worship of David but
[1:35:40] actually under his son because he has
[1:35:42] many strange wives he brings in this way
[1:35:46] of worship that the Bible refers to as a
[1:35:49] high place how many has read that in
[1:35:51] your Bible
[1:35:52] before and it was a Canaanite way of
[1:35:55] worship to where they would take a high
[1:35:57] place and they would worship upon that
[1:35:59] high place and then this plague enters
[1:36:03] the children of Israel and the temple
[1:36:06] worship is mixed in with this Canaanite
[1:36:12] worship and you'll find that actually
[1:36:15] those high places that Solomon gets from
[1:36:17] the Canaanite
[1:36:19] women now listen I I can imagine when he
[1:36:22] first brought it into church man it was
[1:36:24] just a gasp people couldn't believe it
[1:36:27] they couldn't believe it it was just I
[1:36:29] couldn't believe he would do that but
[1:36:31] you know after you you can think
[1:36:33] something against it but if you don't
[1:36:34] make a
[1:36:36] change then after a while it becomes a
[1:36:38] little easier to to digest then a little
[1:36:41] and it sort of offends you at first but
[1:36:44] then after a while you you just sort of
[1:36:46] get used to it and then after a while
[1:36:48] brother Brandon said it starts as a
[1:36:50] saying and then it moves to a you know a
[1:36:52] do then it becomes the irrefutable
[1:36:54] Doctrine then they crown
[1:36:56] him and it's amazing how you watch
[1:36:59] people's lives at first if brother bam
[1:37:00] talked about lot and said lot the sins
[1:37:02] of Sodom and vexed Sodom vexed his
[1:37:05] righteous soul but he didn't have the
[1:37:06] plain gumption to say something
[1:37:10] about and he tolerated it and what one
[1:37:14] generation tolerates the Next Generation
[1:37:18] Embraces and so no doubt at first it was
[1:37:21] egregious but after a while it just
[1:37:23] it'ss there people get more used to it
[1:37:25] more used to it more used to it until
[1:37:28] eventually it's just what we
[1:37:32] do and this generational curse I know
[1:37:37] you've heard that many times before but
[1:37:38] this is a real one you're actually
[1:37:39] looking at that generational curse that
[1:37:42] Solomon brings in plagues good men good
[1:37:46] Godly men Good Men Who feared the
[1:37:50] Lord but they could never go past
[1:37:55] and I'm filling the Holy Spirit here
[1:37:56] come on they could never break the
[1:38:01] ceiling they could never go past as far
[1:38:05] as Daddy went that's how far they went
[1:38:09] yes and as long as he walked in the ways
[1:38:12] of God then they seem like they could go
[1:38:14] that
[1:38:15] far come on listen friends let me just
[1:38:18] say this you will never lead a person to
[1:38:20] a place you've never been all right come
[1:38:23] on
[1:38:25] you can emotionally want to and think
[1:38:27] but if you've never entered there
[1:38:28] yourself how can you lead others to
[1:38:31] come that's why a father can never
[1:38:34] really lead his children to the Token if
[1:38:36] he's never really been led to the Token
[1:38:38] himself come on you'll never lead your
[1:38:40] children in true unadulterated worship
[1:38:42] if you've never got it yourself come
[1:38:46] on and so so as long as the father got
[1:38:50] there then the children seem like they
[1:38:52] could I want you to notice in 2 Kings 12
[1:38:56] in verse 1 because the writer of Kings
[1:39:00] would always list the name of the king
[1:39:03] his age his mother's name and then it
[1:39:07] would always say one or two things he
[1:39:10] did that which was right in the sight of
[1:39:13] the Lord or it'll say he did that which
[1:39:16] was evil in the sight of the Lord that's
[1:39:20] right and then it will link his life
[1:39:24] to his natural lineage right of his
[1:39:27] father now notice second Kings chapter
[1:39:31] 12 verse one in the second year of juu
[1:39:34] jehoash began to Reign and 40 years
[1:39:37] reigned he in Jerusalem his mother's
[1:39:39] name was Z of berseba and
[1:39:42] jehoash did that which was right can
[1:39:46] somebody say praise the
[1:39:48] Lord praise the Lord come on say it with
[1:39:51] me he did that which was right right the
[1:39:54] Lord praise the Lord he's a good man
[1:39:56] he's a Godly Man good King good boy
[1:39:59] wanted to serve the Lord had it in his
[1:40:02] heart purposed it in his
[1:40:04] heart he wants to walk in the ways of
[1:40:06] God but notice the
[1:40:09] disclaimer he did that which was right
[1:40:12] all his
[1:40:14] days wherein jeod the priest instructed
[1:40:18] him verse three but but but yeah the
[1:40:24] high places were not taken
[1:40:27] away the people sacrificed and burn
[1:40:31] incense in the high
[1:40:34] places chapter 14 of 2 Kings verse four
[1:40:38] verse one the second year of joash son
[1:40:40] of jehoash king of Israel amiah the son
[1:40:42] of joash King of Judah he was 25 years
[1:40:44] old and began to rain R 29 years and
[1:40:47] verse three says and he did that which
[1:40:49] was right praise the Lord oh that was
[1:40:52] weak come on we got four of you can we
[1:40:54] get 40 he did that which was right
[1:40:56] praise the Lord praise the Lord thank
[1:40:59] god he's a good man he wants to serve
[1:41:02] the Lord he did that which was right in
[1:41:06] the sight of the Lord notice this yet
[1:41:09] aha
[1:41:11] aha so you mean it's not just good
[1:41:15] enough to want to do that which was
[1:41:18] right in the sight of the Lord yet not
[1:41:23] not
[1:41:25] like David hold on brother Joel David is
[1:41:31] not this man's father you see but
[1:41:34] somehow there's a link come
[1:41:37] on between natural
[1:41:40] lineage and Heavenly
[1:41:42] lineage notice yet not like David his
[1:41:47] father he did according to all things as
[1:41:53] joash his father
[1:41:56] did so as much Victory as joash had this
[1:42:00] boy could likely he'd get that much too
[1:42:04] but wherever the Father the generation
[1:42:07] call it a preacher a pastor a church
[1:42:09] doesn't matter what it is as long as
[1:42:11] they're only linked to an Earthly
[1:42:13] lineage come on then they're
[1:42:17] Bound by that Earthly
[1:42:20] lineage and the prophet of God says you
[1:42:22] say B that's not so bad my daddy was a
[1:42:24] good man my mom well that's good praise
[1:42:27] the Lord not everybody has that
[1:42:28] testimony come on but let me just say
[1:42:30] something do you hear today the prophet
[1:42:32] of God said that out of the grab bag of
[1:42:34] life you didn't choose this but every
[1:42:37] single one of you have idioc secenes and
[1:42:40] tendencies and things that bother you
[1:42:42] things that you war against things that
[1:42:44] bother your
[1:42:46] flesh listen I know they're good people
[1:42:48] here in Arkansas but but we are too in
[1:42:50] South Carolina we got to share we got
[1:42:52] our Fair share problems as you got here
[1:42:55] come on and you got good people but
[1:42:57] notice out of that grab bag of Life the
[1:42:59] prophet of God said there's certain
[1:43:00] things that come that you inherit from
[1:43:03] your mother and your father or your
[1:43:04] grandfather or your grandmother and you
[1:43:06] didn't ask for those things did anybody
[1:43:09] anybody here did did y'all did anybody
[1:43:10] here do we have anybody here that was
[1:43:12] born and before you were born like on a
[1:43:14] video game you got to choose how tall
[1:43:16] you would be how how much you'd weigh
[1:43:18] you know the color of your hair the
[1:43:20] darkness of your skin your complexion
[1:43:22] anybody oh so you mean you didn't you
[1:43:25] mean you didn't get to choose your own
[1:43:27] life or what you look like you didn't
[1:43:29] get to choose what things bothered you
[1:43:31] what things you didn't bother what
[1:43:33] things didn't bother
[1:43:34] [Music]
[1:43:36] you that's why brother ROM says some men
[1:43:38] are certain way and other men are not
[1:43:40] and if you ever try to get one man to
[1:43:42] try to relate to another he'll always
[1:43:44] criticize him because he doesn't
[1:43:46] struggle with that that's right come on
[1:43:48] but let me say just because you don't
[1:43:50] struggle with it don't mean it's not
[1:43:52] real listen there many things that I
[1:43:54] can't relate to of certain people but I
[1:43:56] promise there's many things that bother
[1:43:58] me that you can't relate to and let me
[1:44:00] just say I've got to fight my battle and
[1:44:02] you've got to fight yours stop trying to
[1:44:05] tell me how to fight mine I'll stop
[1:44:06] telling you how to fight yours that's
[1:44:08] the prophet of God said just block your
[1:44:10] man and we'll get the touchdown after a
[1:44:16] while and notice here it was something
[1:44:19] in his life that he couldn't help Paul
[1:44:21] said the creature made subject in other
[1:44:24] words he's a slave he's he's he's
[1:44:26] subservient he says he's made subject to
[1:44:29] vanity he's created that way come on not
[1:44:33] willingly but by reason of the S of him
[1:44:35] who created him the same in Hope come on
[1:44:38] and so in other words he doesn't choose
[1:44:40] it it's just part of his
[1:44:44] Canaan that he's got to
[1:44:47] conquer and brother and notice here in
[1:44:49] the scripture he did that which was
[1:44:51] right how be it it verse four the high
[1:44:55] places ain't it amazing it points
[1:44:57] straight to that every single time how
[1:44:59] be it he never could break it he did
[1:45:01] that which was right praise the
[1:45:03] Lord but he can never overcome this
[1:45:08] Azariah 27th
[1:45:10] year jeroboam king of Israel began
[1:45:15] Azariah the son of
[1:45:17] amaziah 16 years old was he when he
[1:45:20] began to reain young man his mother's
[1:45:22] name he did that verse three and he did
[1:45:25] that which was
[1:45:26] right in the sight of the Lord praise
[1:45:30] the Lord but according to all his father
[1:45:37] and Messiah had done he did that which
[1:45:40] was right according to all his Earthly
[1:45:44] lineage you see some people can walk
[1:45:46] their entire life and never step out of
[1:45:50] Judges come on and that judges cycle is
[1:45:53] just walking in the ways of your Earthly
[1:46:01] lineage he notice save verse four that
[1:46:05] the high places were not
[1:46:09] removed right jotham verse uh 32 I got
[1:46:13] three minutes left we're going to have
[1:46:15] to go in a little bit of Eternity here I
[1:46:16] hope you can hold with me here for a
[1:46:18] moment and the second year PE of the son
[1:46:21] of Ralia verse 32 began jotham the son
[1:46:24] of Uzziah 5 25 years old was when it
[1:46:27] begin to
[1:46:28] rain and verse 34 and he did that which
[1:46:32] was
[1:46:34] right he did that which was right he's a
[1:46:37] good King he did according to all that
[1:46:42] his
[1:46:44] father
[1:46:46] Uzziah how be it the high places were
[1:46:51] not removed the
[1:46:53] people sacrificed and burn incense still
[1:46:57] in the high
[1:46:59] places he was never set
[1:47:04] free he never entered the land of
[1:47:07] Bethlehem Judea Ruth could have stayed
[1:47:10] on that same cycle you see he had never
[1:47:14] entered notice this here brother Bon
[1:47:16] picks us up in Paradox he says for
[1:47:18] instance a few moments ago he begins to
[1:47:21] tell about this young man and he says I
[1:47:23] was called to a little something and
[1:47:25] there was a fine young man very fine boy
[1:47:28] going with a little girl very fine
[1:47:29] little girl and a fine family this boy
[1:47:31] all of a sudden come up with something
[1:47:33] some kind of an idea and he just walked
[1:47:36] away he did something wrong to the
[1:47:38] little girl as much as promised her to
[1:47:40] do a certain thing and he didn't do it
[1:47:41] and instead of coming to the girl and
[1:47:44] apologizing like a gentleman should do
[1:47:49] it just wasn't in him
[1:47:54] right right now that's an important word
[1:47:57] come on it just wasn't in him what was
[1:48:02] in him brother Matt a good boy we just
[1:48:06] learned it he's a fine young man had a
[1:48:09] good daddy good Mama good
[1:48:12] raisin but this wasn't in him he just
[1:48:17] couldn't say sorry right on some people
[1:48:21] say sorry but they're never really
[1:48:23] saying sorry on
[1:48:28] right can I just say something
[1:48:32] here you don't realize the power of
[1:48:36] forgiveness come on that's right and you
[1:48:40] don't realize the Liberty I have watched
[1:48:43] it set families
[1:48:45] free when God starts with a man maybe a
[1:48:49] woman maybe a young person I don't care
[1:48:51] who it is yeah and when that person can
[1:48:55] can I know it's so simple but when they
[1:48:57] can really look at themselves and as
[1:48:59] brother bradam says I looked in the
[1:49:00] mirror and I realized the biggest enemy
[1:49:02] I
[1:49:04] got is staring me back in the
[1:49:09] mirror say who gets in the way brother
[1:49:11] Bram says William brandham gets in the
[1:49:15] way he just couldn't apologize it just
[1:49:19] wasn't in him father and mother called
[1:49:21] me to the scene and said we would desire
[1:49:24] we would desire to
[1:49:26] know what's wrong with our boy EAS you
[1:49:30] brother Brandon says no it's not easy to
[1:49:31] do sometimes you're right it's not come
[1:49:34] on but you must be truthful and honest
[1:49:37] therefore the boy was a Christian praise
[1:49:40] the Lord somebody say with me praise the
[1:49:44] Lord he was a Christian as far as a
[1:49:48] Believer he had repented good praise the
[1:49:51] Lord had been baptized praise the Lord
[1:49:54] had his position among Believers Lord
[1:49:58] but yet had not received the baptism of
[1:50:01] the Holy Spirit come on no matter how
[1:50:05] much he thought he
[1:50:08] had now notice how brother Bram
[1:50:11] deciphers that he hasn't received the
[1:50:13] Holy
[1:50:14] Spirit notice what he says you thinking
[1:50:18] you have it and having it is two
[1:50:21] different things
[1:50:23] you might be able to try to say you have
[1:50:26] and you might be able to show some
[1:50:28] evidence of some
[1:50:30] emotion oh so brother Brandon wasn't
[1:50:32] looking at emotion or no
[1:50:35] emotion but unless your
[1:50:44] life unless your life come on is
[1:50:49] vindicating what you're professing to
[1:50:52] have still you haven't got it right no
[1:50:54] matter how many emotions how much you
[1:50:58] jump run sensation speaking in tongues
[1:51:02] shouting whatever you might I love that
[1:51:05] he says that because but that might not
[1:51:07] have hit your list but let me just put
[1:51:09] what a prophet said whatever you might
[1:51:11] lay upon it which is all right I believe
[1:51:15] in all of that too but unless your life
[1:51:19] oh I believe if we'd get back to what
[1:51:21] the for a prophet said we'd stop with
[1:51:23] the confusion of who's got it who don't
[1:51:26] have it what you got to get to get it
[1:51:28] let your life I say God let my life cope
[1:51:31] with my
[1:51:34] testimony unless your life copes with
[1:51:37] your testimony then you haven't got it
[1:51:39] because the fruit of the spirit
[1:51:40] vindicates what you are just like the
[1:51:42] fruit of any tree tells you what it is
[1:51:44] Jesus said by their fruits you shall
[1:51:46] know them sir now this young fellow's
[1:51:49] parents aha so to diagnose the ISS is he
[1:51:53] first goes to the Earthly
[1:51:56] lineage now here's his
[1:52:00] judges here's the
[1:52:03] cycle his he says not to the parents his
[1:52:06] mother's a German I hope you're not
[1:52:08] German
[1:52:10] today no reflection on the
[1:52:13] German but there's a
[1:52:15] strain in that family that is they'll
[1:52:20] just sit you could talk to them they'll
[1:52:24] just stare you right in the
[1:52:26] face got a lot of people in church like
[1:52:29] that sometimes don't we
[1:52:31] brother it's the reason God told
[1:52:33] Jeremiah don't look at their
[1:52:37] face preachers look over people
[1:52:39] sometimes you you got up here one time
[1:52:41] you'd know
[1:52:42] why oh yes they'll just sit there and
[1:52:45] stare at
[1:52:46] you brother bandam says right in the
[1:52:49] face the girl sister the mother this boy
[1:52:51] or sister I come down Street many
[1:52:52] morning young lady be sitting out the
[1:52:54] yard I'd say good morning to you she'd
[1:52:57] just look at me and I'd stoping I'd say
[1:53:01] sure a fine
[1:53:03] morning she'd stand look right at you an
[1:53:08] intelligent woman I'd say come up and
[1:53:11] see us she'd just stand and look well
[1:53:15] her brothers are that way father and
[1:53:17] mothers that
[1:53:18] way now the father of the boy so he
[1:53:21] stops with the mother mom now the father
[1:53:24] of the boy is strictly an Irishman I
[1:53:27] hope you're not Irish Moody High
[1:53:31] tempered High Strung yeah that's his
[1:53:36] whole
[1:53:38] family it's like that how did brother
[1:53:40] Brandon know because this is his
[1:53:44] nephew and he's talking about his own
[1:53:46] Brandon
[1:53:48] family they're high strung they're Moody
[1:53:51] they're temperamental that's his whole
[1:53:53] familyes like that what is that brother
[1:53:56] Matt that's his entire Book of
[1:54:00] Judges good things but he's a good
[1:54:02] brother he is she's a good sister she
[1:54:05] loves the Lord she is and she can be and
[1:54:08] she may never realize she's never broken

[1:54:12] cycle come on very good and he says the
[1:54:17] father mother notice his whole family's
[1:54:19] like that except one or the other out of
[1:54:22] the family converted oh
[1:54:25] yeah now in this
[1:54:30] boy inside of him the prophet of God
[1:54:33] tells us in greatest battle ever fought
[1:54:35] you are not who you are who you see in
[1:54:37] the mirror listen you might see me you
[1:54:39] might hear me preach but you may not
[1:54:41] know me at all you know who knows me I
[1:54:44] know me and God knows who I really am
[1:54:46] and people you can see one thing on the
[1:54:48] outside and think you know them like a
[1:54:51] book on and then find out a year later
[1:54:53] my goodness how could they have done
[1:54:55] that problem is you never really seen
[1:54:57] who they really
[1:54:58] are Prophet said because you're not who
[1:55:01] you see in the mirror in fact brother
[1:55:03] bham tells us an angel the visitation of
[1:55:05] an Angel brother the prophet of God said
[1:55:07] he said that did you know that you've
[1:55:09] actually never seen who you really are
[1:55:11] he said in fact none of us have ever
[1:55:13] actually seen
[1:55:15] us CU who we really are is not this it's
[1:55:19] that c Jean Zoey life on the back part
[1:55:21] of God's mind you say brother Matt why
[1:55:23] you happy because this doesn't always
[1:55:25] look like this and I'm glad to know that
[1:55:28] this ain't who I really am you say who
[1:55:30] are you really brother Matt I'm that
[1:55:32] seed who feeds on the word who says Amen
[1:55:35] to the word who says yes Lord change me
[1:55:39] I Repent oh
[1:55:40] God that's who you really
[1:55:44] are in this boy father and mother
[1:55:48] brother brother says now in this boy the
[1:55:50] father and mother both are Christians
[1:55:52] filled with the Holy Ghost and they have
[1:55:54] brought this young man up in the way of
[1:55:55] the Lord now the young man is about 17
[1:55:57] 18 something along there verifying kid
[1:55:59] has been a real model boy at home now
[1:56:01] nice kid and he's got a brother that's
[1:56:03] just vice versa but the girl the brother
[1:56:05] the mother's family lives close to a
[1:56:07] fine church do you ever think they'd
[1:56:09] ever come over there oh they know it's
[1:56:11] right but it's just not in them to ask
[1:56:18] forgiveness right you say brother mat
[1:56:22] you mean that after you're born of the
[1:56:24] Holy Ghost I'm not talking about a gift
[1:56:26] of the Holy Ghost I'm not talking about
[1:56:28] just being justified in your in your
[1:56:29] mind and intellectually you know the
[1:56:31] word you mean brother Matt when a
[1:56:33] person's really truly born of the spirit
[1:56:35] of God has the token living which
[1:56:37] brother bam said the token is the Holy
[1:56:39] Ghost when they're sealed by the Holy
[1:56:42] Ghost do you mean to tell me brother
[1:56:44] Matt that after that
[1:56:46] moment that the Holy Ghost work is not
[1:56:49] finished in them yeah that's right good
[1:56:53] come on you mean there's more that the
[1:56:56] Holy Ghost wants to do besides change
[1:56:58] your Soul's position that's good but I'm
[1:57:01] sealed with the Holy Ghost I'm going
[1:57:03] yeah means I got a ticket to the Rapture
[1:57:04] that's right but you mean that the Holy
[1:57:07] Ghost still has something more he wants
[1:57:09] to not just affect my soul you mean he
[1:57:12] wants to get into my personality
[1:57:16] traits you mean he wants to change the
[1:57:19] but that's my family that's just who we
[1:57:21] are that's just how my daddy was and
[1:57:23] that's just how I that's just the way I
[1:57:24] see
[1:57:26] things you're caught in judges you say
[1:57:29] the Holy Ghost wants to move into my
[1:57:31] human spirit and get in my memory my
[1:57:34] conscience my reasoning imagination
[1:57:36] affection he wants to change that part
[1:57:39] even of Me no brother he wants to go
[1:57:41] further in fact he wants to change your
[1:57:45] body he wants to change every part of
[1:57:48] you listen a lot of people stop with the
[1:57:51] baptism all ghost that's only the
[1:57:53] beginning of the
[1:57:54] work now God wants to work as a brother
[1:57:57] prophet of God said as The Headstone
[1:57:59] nears the body those in the body will be
[1:58:02] so much like the word till they're in
[1:58:05] his very image
[1:58:07] sir wonderful and so God wanted to get
[1:58:11] further into this man's heart yes notice
[1:58:14] this the girl mother's family you ever
[1:58:17] think they come to church ask
[1:58:18] forgiveness ask pardon they just won't
[1:58:20] do it it's just not in them now the
[1:58:25] jeans in this father the mother of this
[1:58:26] boy no matter how much he's talking
[1:58:29] about the mom and the dad who's been
[1:58:30] born again the father the mother the
[1:58:34] jeans and the father and the mother of
[1:58:36] this boy no matter how much they are
[1:58:40] converted Still Remains In the Flesh
[1:58:45] that's been inbred out to this boy
[1:58:48] therefore the boy has got accomplish
[1:58:54] just like from his mother's
[1:58:58] family and they are not forgiving they
[1:59:01] will not
[1:59:03] apologize and that's where the boy
[1:59:11] stands and if he dies there he'll die
[1:59:16] with the
[1:59:17] judges come
[1:59:20] on that's where he
[1:59:23] stands baptized Christian believer name
[1:59:28] amongst the church but never been really
[1:59:31] born of the spirit of God I said to the
[1:59:34] father no matter how much you've raised
[1:59:38] him up I said look at you out of your
[1:59:42] family all of them drunks and fighting
[1:59:45] and shooting and cutting and so forth
[1:59:47] now look at your family to the mother
[1:59:49] there are a bunch of people just sit
[1:59:51] there won't speak very
[1:59:54] independent so forth irr irreverent to
[1:59:58] religion but I said it's I love this
[2:00:00] part so much oh
[2:00:02] yeah but I
[2:00:05] said it's not
[2:00:11] you thank you Lord thank you
[2:00:14] Lord you're sweet you're the only one
[2:00:19] out of all your sisters and brothers and
[2:00:22] you're sweet you're kind you're
[2:00:26] forgiving what does that and your part
[2:00:31] your tree part of that family tree yet
[2:00:34] you have received the Holy Ghost that's
[2:00:37] the thing that made you tender and
[2:00:41] sweet it's not your
[2:00:45] people
[2:00:47] anymore
[2:00:49] come it's your Christ yes sir that lives
[2:00:53] in
[2:00:56] you it's not your people oh my brother
[2:00:59] my sister until you can say it's not my
[2:01:03] family it's not my dad might have been
[2:01:05] good and I'm thankful for a good dad but
[2:01:07] you've got to break out of that Earthly
[2:01:09] book and you've got to step into an
[2:01:12] eternal
[2:01:13] book and say God let me die to myself
[2:01:17] let me die to my passion let me die to
[2:01:21] my pride oh as the prophet said take
[2:01:23] your pride and stomp it under your feet
[2:01:26] take that temper and hold it before the
[2:01:28] Holy Ghost I don't care what it is today
[2:01:31] say
[2:01:32] God let me be able to say it's not my
[2:01:37] people it's my
[2:01:40] Christ I said to the boy look at your
[2:01:42] family all drunks how Moody High
[2:01:45] tempered High strong but you're not
[2:01:47] you're kind you're forgiving what is it
[2:01:50] the Holy Spirit
[2:01:52] you're no more what you are it's
[2:01:57] Christ in and the same thing has to
[2:02:02] happen to your
[2:02:06] son brother Brandon says father raised
[2:02:09] up said my son went to an altar he was
[2:02:12] baptized correctly in the name of Jesus
[2:02:14] and water baptism the pool said I know
[2:02:16] my son has come to Christ I said that
[2:02:18] may it be all right all the outward
[2:02:20] motions
[2:02:22] he might be identified as a Believer
[2:02:24] with the Believers but until he's
[2:02:26] regenerated born again I'd advise that
[2:02:28] young man to never marry a woman he'll
[2:02:31] make hell on Earth for her until that
[2:02:35] gentle sweet forgiving I just raise my
[2:02:39] hand and say Yes
[2:02:41] Lord how many wanted to say Lord yes
[2:02:45] until let that gentle let that sweet let
[2:02:48] that forgiving Spirit of Christ come in
[2:02:52] all right then that will be a paradox in
[2:02:55] itself to take the very nature of a boy
[2:03:00] that's bred between father and mother
[2:03:02] and yet in his intellectuals he's trying
[2:03:05] his best to overcome it he can't do it
[2:03:08] he'll never overcome it Christ will have
[2:03:10] to overcome it and when he lets Christ
[2:03:13] in then he's already overcome it'll be a
[2:03:15] perfect Paradox when a man is born of
[2:03:18] the spirit of God do you know the first
[2:03:21] thing it's recorded as I close in
[2:03:22] Hezekiah you say brother Matt did Kings
[2:03:24] in that way no there was another boy and
[2:03:27] the Bible says that and it came to pass
[2:03:28] in the third year of hosia son of elah
[2:03:31] Hezekiah the son of ahaz begin to rain
[2:03:33] 25 years old was it begin to rain and he
[2:03:35] reigned 29 years his mother's name was
[2:03:37] Abby the daughter of Zachariah and he
[2:03:39] did that which was right praise the Lord
[2:03:42] according to all that David do you
[2:03:44] realize David was not his father he was
[2:03:47] not his Earthly lineage but what
[2:03:49] happened he broke the link of his
[2:03:51] Earthly father and he was
[2:03:56] connected and what's the first thing he
[2:03:58] did in the next slide he removed the
[2:04:01] high places in other words he said it
