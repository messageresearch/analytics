[42:16] believe it grab a hold of the promise oh
[42:20] God that we buy your stripes we are
[42:23] healed Lord I believe that it can come
[42:26] to pass even tonight Lord that the
[42:28] symptoms will begin to leave and people
[42:31] begin to worship you for that Lord for
[42:34] some it's not sickness physically but
[42:36] maybe just a little cold in spirit or
[42:38] maybe you had a hard day at work but
[42:40] Lord I pray you'd help us to put all
[42:42] that aside and just let you speak to
[42:46] speak to we want to hear from you lord
[42:47] your voice matters to us oh God lord we
[42:51] we take a lot of time to hear from all
[42:53] kinds of people but Lord tonight we want
[42:56] to hear from you
[42:57] move me out of the way Lord don't let me
[43:00] say the things that I would say but what
[43:03] you would have to speak Lord
[43:04] oh how we want to feel your love
[43:07] expressed through your words Lord God or
[43:10] do you want to tell us how much you love
[43:12] us and or even in correction Lord
[43:14] sometimes that well that's how you show

[43:18] Lord God oh we love you tonight thank
[43:21] you for this people Lord I pray that
[43:23] you've bless them abundantly for coming

[43:27] be Revelation and peace and joy in their
[43:30] hearts when we leave thank you for it oh
[43:33] we thank you for loving us Lord
[43:35] [Music]
[43:46] amen Revelation chapter 6 and verse 5.
[43:49] I'm going to go into maybe my favorite
[43:53] of the four horse riders the third seal
[43:57] I really enjoy this sermon if you
[43:59] haven't heard it on tape recently I
[44:01] encourage you to go back and listen to
[44:03] it the third seal
[44:05] remember we'll have two services on
[44:06] Sunday and for the Allen's finances
[44:09] class as well on Sunday afternoon
[44:11] we'll have services
[44:14] uh in Galena Missouri starting Friday
[44:17] night the 22nd and if any of you could
[44:20] go I know it's a little ways up there
[44:22] but they really showed up for our
[44:24] meetings so I know some of you planning
[44:26] on going so if you can go even if it's
[44:28] just for one night I'm preaching
[44:29] Saturday morning and Sunday morning so
[44:31] you know what services to avoid if you
[44:34] want to uh if you want to do that my
[44:36] brother Daryl Ward will be preaching on
[44:38] Friday night and Saturday night so the
[44:40] Lord willing and uh so we're looking
[44:42] forward to that and just being with
[44:44] those folks and then brother Josh Martin
[44:47] will be here for those of you that can't
[44:48] go for two services that Sunday and so
[44:51] I'm sure you're looking forward to that
[44:52] but Josh is a wonderful preacher and a
[44:55] singer as well maybe he'll sing for you
[44:57] because he just had a baby so at least
[45:00] he's not expecting one this time so
[45:01] hopefully but Josh if you're listening
[45:03] or you listen to this later that uh
[45:05] you'll uh you'll show up this time so
[45:07] kind of an inside joke between us
[45:10] amen let's go to Revelation six and five
[45:16] and says we need to open the third seal
[45:18] I heard the third be say come and see
[45:21] and I'll be held and low a black horse
[45:23] and he that set on him had a pair of
[45:25] balances in his hands
[45:27] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[45:29] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[45:32] penny three measures of barley for a
[45:35] penny see thou hurt not the oil and the
[45:39] wine but Lord without his Blessing to
[45:41] the word you may be seated I thank the
[45:43] Lord for the presence of the Lord we
[45:44] feel here this evening
[45:47] I believe that each one of these seals
[45:50] are relevant today maybe none of them
[45:52] more than this one as each one of these
[45:55] Powers these horses as the Bible calls
[45:58] this brother Branham says that each one
[46:00] of these horses ride out into eternity
[46:02] and so these powers are still around
[46:04] today but I thank God for an anointing
[46:07] to combat that power that we still have
[46:10] today as well now brother Branham gets
[46:13] right into it and if you're following in
[46:15] the seal book it's around paragraph 250
[46:17] is where we're going to jump in so
[46:19] brother ran them extensively backgrounds
[46:21] the third seal and then just in the last
[46:24] uh 30 minutes or so the tape he gets
[46:27] really into it uh into what the seal
[46:29] actually is but there's a tremendous
[46:31] background we're getting a little bit of
[46:32] that and then the seal so brother Brian
[46:34] said the lamb opens another seal another
[46:36] one of the living creatures like a man
[46:38] so remember there was the the lion the
[46:41] ox the man and the eagle this is the
[46:44] living creature like a man that said
[46:46] come see remember whenever the enemy
[46:49] does something the spirit of the Lord
[46:50] raises up his standard against him and
[46:52] that's what's happening in this age when
[46:55] this was taking place and he said when
[46:57] he does there come a rider on a black
[46:58] horse he said this this writer let's
[47:01] discuss him if you'll notice the first
[47:03] Rider who he was we found out last night
[47:06] scripturally that the second rider was
[47:08] exactly the same man only he was on
[47:10] another horse he said what happened he
[47:13] changed his ministry we found out he was
[47:15] an antichrist he changed his position
[47:18] you can see him as he begins to ride and
[47:21] then he's crowned and then he becomes
[47:23] and he gets off his white horse rides
[47:25] his red horse and he takes a sword in
[47:27] his hand and now he gets off his red
[47:29] horse and he rides his black horse so
[47:32] brother Branham tells us that this black
[47:34] horse is about the time of the Third
[47:36] Church age when he gets off and he
[47:38] begins to write so that is the time
[47:40] remember you can't look at the seals
[47:42] exactly like you do the church ages but
[47:44] it just gives you a reference point as
[47:46] this thing begins to happen now he
[47:49] begins to write and and there were three
[47:51] stages before Satan became incarnate he
[47:54] was the Antichrist he was the false
[47:57] prophet he was the Beast now brother
[47:58] random typed that and said the church
[48:00] went through justification
[48:02] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[48:04] Ghost so you had Antichrist false
[48:07] prophet Beast Incarnation right
[48:12] justification sanctification the baptism
[48:15] of the Holy Ghost where are we living at
[48:16] tonight we're living in the age of the
[48:18] Incarnate God we're living as brother
[48:21] Brandon put it in a play on words he
[48:22] said incarnate men hey man that's the
[48:25] age that we're living in I believe
[48:27] that's us tonight that's the bride he
[48:29] wants to he wants to Avail himself
[48:31] behind the bride in this day
[48:33] so he said the writer this writer is the
[48:35] same one but another stage of his
[48:37] ministry the first stage a white horse
[48:39] see he he was just a teacher just an
[48:42] antichrist teacher well we've seen him
[48:44] in that form before haven't we even in
[48:46] our age we've seen him he's just a
[48:48] teacher he was against the word of God
[48:51] and brother Branham defines Antichrist
[48:54] here it's a wonderful definition he said
[48:57] now how can you be an antichrist if you
[49:00] were going to say I remember there is an
[49:02] incarnate Antichrist but how could you
[49:05] be an antichrist he said anybody someone
[49:07] say anybody
[49:09] that denies that every word of this
[49:12] isn't true and to be taught just the
[49:16] same is an antichrist because they deny
[49:20] the word and he is the word so they are
[49:24] against the word by saying that the
[49:27] every word isn't true and that it's not
[49:30] to be taught just the same don't you see
[49:32] where every Spirit of false doctrine
[49:34] that we're Believers here tonight every
[49:36] Spirit of false Doctrine that's ever
[49:37] come in this message everything that
[49:39] even that that maybe affects you
[49:41] personally every little false thing that
[49:43] comes along every little Antichrist
[49:45] Spirit what does it do it exalts itself
[49:47] against the word by not teaching what
[49:49] the word teaches by saying well that's
[49:51] not for us anymore we don't have to do
[49:53] that anymore maybe that was just for
[49:55] brother Brown's time maybe that was just
[49:57] for another age maybe that was just for
[49:58] the early church don't let him do that
[50:00] to you whatever God said is still true
[50:04] we believe that tonight
[50:05] so an antichrist denies the word by
[50:08] saying well we don't do that anymore the
[50:10] days of Miracles has passed no more
[50:12] preachers no more you see what that
[50:14] spirit is maybe on good people but it's
[50:17] an antichrist spirit
[50:19] right so now he said First Stage White
[50:22] Horse He was just a teacher but an
[50:24] antichrist spirit in its Doctrine and
[50:27] its quality that's important it was an
[50:30] antichrist spirit and he's not in this
[50:32] stage he wasn't incarnate so the people
[50:35] even that carried this Spirit were not
[50:37] necessarily Antichrist people
[50:40] you understand but They Carried an
[50:42] antichrist spirit and it's important to
[50:44] separate that brother said we're not
[50:45] against the people we're against the
[50:47] system
[50:48] right so we don't treat people bad say
[50:50] well you're an antichrist he's an
[50:52] antichrist they're Antichrist no you're
[50:54] identifying the the doctriness against
[50:56] the word that's what the Antichrist is
[50:58] he said it was innocent it couldn't hurt
[51:00] nothing seemed like just go on he said
[51:02] that's the way Satan comes in
[51:04] right and just like he did Eve in The
[51:06] Serpent and and remembers we're going
[51:08] through this where I'm moving through as
[51:10] quickly as I can so when brother Brandon
[51:12] would go off he'll he'll talk about even
[51:13] the serpent and we're just moving right
[51:15] through that but you can listen to that
[51:17] on the tape read it in the book now this
[51:19] spirit this Antichrist Spirit he said
[51:21] watch this Antichrist Spirit rise up
[51:23] amongst the early church a doctrine of
[51:25] nicolaitan Nico conquer the laity make a
[51:28] holy man and so the spirit produced
[51:31] denominations right that's the
[51:33] nicolating spirit was the Antichrist
[51:35] spirit in the early church that produced
[51:37] an unscriptural Dogma placing man over
[51:39] man facing Bishops over uh over pastors
[51:43] right and that was the the original
[51:45] Antichrist we don't answer the
[51:48] headquarters of any kind we answer to
[51:50] Christ
[51:52] and so you said my brother Ben you
[51:54] preach it may be a little bit different
[51:55] than other pastors or or this other
[51:57] Pastor you know you're not preaching
[51:58] maybe what someone else is but I'll say
[52:00] this there's more similarities than you
[52:01] realize because I believe God's got a
[52:03] bright all over the world whose
[52:05] preachers are preaching the same thing
[52:06] but it's not because somebody told us to
[52:08] it's not because you've got somebody
[52:10] sending out literature and telling us
[52:12] this is what you preach on this week
[52:14] it's because you get the mind of Christ
[52:16] and that's what we strive to do so this
[52:19] Spirit produced denominational Logistics
[52:21] which could not be churches because
[52:23] brother Brandon said there's only one
[52:25] church and that's the mystical body of
[52:28] Jesus Christ he said and you're born
[52:30] into that by predestination all right so
[52:34] you were predestined to be born you're
[52:36] predestined to become a son or daughter
[52:37] of God and look at this he used the
[52:40] scripture John 6 39 this is the Father's
[52:43] will which has sent me that of all
[52:45] someone say all oh which he has given me
[52:48] I should lose nothing
[52:51] Hallelujah well that ought to give you
[52:53] courage tonight that ought to that'll
[52:55] give us Faith tonight I'm going to make
[52:57] it I'm going to be all right no matter
[52:58] what comes against me what can separate
[53:01] me from the love of Jesus Christ of all
[53:03] he has given me I will lose nothing yes
[53:06] sir
[53:07] oh do you love him tonight
[53:09] so now he says but should raise it up
[53:12] again at the last day so everyone who
[53:15] was predestined to be born will be in
[53:18] the resurrection
[53:19] thank God for that
[53:21] so same writer now he said this first
[53:24] stage he was innocent and second now if
[53:27] you want a little bit higher a little
[53:27] more to that more than they said the
[53:29] second stage the Bible said he'd be
[53:31] given a crown that he crowned a man a
[53:32] Superman
[53:33] and then the Bible didn't call him a
[53:35] pope the Bible called him a false
[53:36] prophet he said of course he must be a
[53:38] false prophet by his his Antichrist
[53:41] Spirit the Antichrist against the
[53:42] original word
[53:44] he said now when he did that what did he
[53:46] do then he Satan took his political
[53:48] power which he was already over
[53:51] now we've established that right Satan
[53:53] is over every Kingdom
[53:57] this one
[53:58] that's why things happen like they do
[54:01] the devil someone said the devil's in
[54:04] the details but he is he's in every yeah
[54:06] it's the system it's a it's not going to
[54:08] be like this in heaven it's not gonna be
[54:11] like this during the millennium the
[54:13] reason things that run like they do we
[54:15] don't want to get too used to the way
[54:16] things run every it's a devil now we got
[54:19] to learn how to well we've got to live
[54:21] we we got we're a part of this world but
[54:23] we're we're going to be in this world
[54:25] but we're not going to be of it in other
[54:27] words We're Not Gonna We're not gonna be
[54:28] like it we're going to be like the word
[54:30] amen but we do have to live here well we
[54:33] have to learn here we have to learn how
[54:36] to uh the Bible says be wise as a
[54:38] serpent and harmless as a dove we've got
[54:40] to learn how to do those things and yet
[54:42] recognize that this world is controlled
[54:44] by Satan
[54:46] and so anytime you you know you get
[54:49] stuck in an airport overnight or or you
[54:51] get to you see all the things that
[54:53] happen you know you get out of hearty
[54:55] sometimes things begin to happen you
[54:57] know you begin to realize it's not just
[54:59] Hardy that's controlled by an antichrist
[55:01] Spirit but it's the whole world
[55:04] it's controlled by an antichrist system
[55:06] the whole thing well it's fixing to go
[55:09] down into a tribulation period and then
[55:11] go ah and then be destroyed but we're
[55:14] not going down we're going up so he said
[55:17] when you see these things happen look up
[55:19] your Redemption draweth night
[55:22] so he said Satan took his political
[55:24] power which he was already over took the
[55:26] religious power he had already been
[55:28] crowned put them together
[55:29] so the Nicene Council then finally
[55:32] resulting in the doctrine of purgatory
[55:34] which took them several hundred years
[55:36] actually to get everybody in line where
[55:39] they could begin to teach Purgatory but
[55:41] finally they did he said now his great
[55:43] power comes he was made Victor of heaven
[55:46] and worshiped as God ruler of the Earth
[55:48] by uniting the church and state Together
[55:51] made him ruler on Earth give him a crown
[55:54] over that
[55:56] right that's what you don't expect too
[55:58] much from the politics of this Earth
[55:59] because he already had that and he has
[56:01] religion too
[56:04] right he has the church I'm glad I'm
[56:06] part of the Bride I'm glad there's been
[56:09] a distinction with Harvey made in my day
[56:11] I'm glad there's a difference between
[56:12] the church and the bride because he's
[56:14] ruler of the church
[56:16] nominal again we're not talking about
[56:18] the people we're talking about the
[56:19] system
[56:20] Revelation 13 2 the Beast which I saw
[56:23] was like to a leopard his feet was the
[56:25] feet of a bear his mouth is a mouth of a
[56:27] lion and where to get his power and
[56:29] authority the Dragon
[56:31] Satan gave him his power and his feet
[56:34] his position and great Authority
[56:38] he said now brother Brandon's going to
[56:40] get into this now he said now I have to
[56:42] say this just the way it come to me
[56:44] and then if it comes to me now look look
[56:47] how brother Branham did if it come to me
[56:50] and didn't compare with the rest of the
[56:51] scriptures then God never give it
[56:55] scripture has to agree with scripture
[56:58] and anything is contrary to the
[56:59] scripture listen he said if that angel
[57:01] of the Lord told me anything that wasn't
[57:04] scriptural I wouldn't believe him
[57:08] that's pretty powerful isn't it if the
[57:10] angel of the Lord he said that angel of
[57:12] the Lord the one who told him all these
[57:13] things but I'm glad that he didn't I'm
[57:16] glad he found it in the word many times
[57:18] he said the angel would come to him he
[57:19] said and tell him what it was and he'd
[57:21] go in the scripture and find it right
[57:23] and so it wasn't by his own effort the
[57:25] angel brought it to him but it had to
[57:27] match up with the scripture he said
[57:29] scripture has to agree with the
[57:30] scripture if the angel Lord told me
[57:32] anything it wasn't scriptural I wouldn't
[57:33] believe him he talks about the Chicago
[57:34] Ministerial Association and how they
[57:36] dragged him in there and began to
[57:38] question him on the godhead and so God
[57:41] had explained I believe it's the tape if
[57:43] you go and listen to it you can see how
[57:45] brother Brandon deals within me deals
[57:47] with them very kindly but he said if you
[57:49] can disprove it come Stand By Me
[57:52] if you can disprove it by the scripture
[57:54] he said I don't want to deal with your
[57:55] theologians he said bring the scriptures
[57:57] and disprove it and they couldn't do it
[58:00] right and and so uh even they said well
[58:03] we'll be baptized but they never showed
[58:04] up to the baptism why it wasn't who they
[58:07] were but I'm glad it's who I am
[58:10] I'm glad that my the the desire that's
[58:13] in me matches up with the word of God
[58:15] so but they told him they said we'll
[58:17] believe it if the angel told you
[58:21] isn't that interesting they told him I
[58:23] said if the angel said
[58:25] that it's to baptize the name of Jesus
[58:27] Christ we'll believe it he said I can't
[58:29] believe you'd be fooled by something
[58:30] like that
[58:31] see if the angel come to you and told
[58:34] you say well I had a dream I had a
[58:35] vision those things are wonderful but
[58:37] don't take that over the word God's
[58:39] primary method of dealing with us is
[58:42] always always the word of God
[58:45] and sometimes it seems like well God
[58:47] does not speaking to me like he usually
[58:49] does I'm not hearing in a supernatural
[58:51] voice like maybe I have in the past but
[58:53] remember even in the times when he is
[58:55] silent his silence speaks volumes
[58:57] because he is already spoken in his word
[59:00] and sometimes he wants us to grab a hold
[59:02] of the word that's right in front of us
[59:04] and go do the word go live the word
[59:07] become Lord he said he don't show us
[59:09] prophets everything
[59:10] but he he causes them to make decisions
[59:13] for themselves because he wants you to
[59:15] grow in the character of Jesus Christ
[59:18] now but the brown said here's the
[59:21] mystery of this
[59:22] he said and when it revealed to me early
[59:24] this morning before daylight I went
[59:26] quickly to the scripture and began to
[59:28] look search it up
[59:29] I love that he said now here is the
[59:32] mystery of the black horse according to
[59:33] what it was revealed to me
[59:35] he has started writing him in the time
[59:38] of the Dark Ages
[59:40] that's what the Dark Horse represented
[59:42] the Dark Ages now listen to this it was
[59:45] a time of midnight
[59:48] to the true believers
[59:50] that was left
[59:52] a time of midnight in fact you couldn't
[59:54] even identify a group of True Believers
[59:58] there were so few
[1:00:00] during this time it was literally one
[1:00:03] here one over there a little group over
[1:00:06] here there was no organized Church of
[1:00:09] True Believers
[1:00:11] during the Dark Ages everything had been
[1:00:14] taken under the control of this
[1:00:16] Antichrist system and he tells them out
[1:00:19] there in one of the church ages he said
[1:00:21] you got you have a little strength left
[1:00:24] a little strength left
[1:00:26] he said practically all hope had been
[1:00:29] taken from the true church
[1:00:32] for this fellow controlled both church
[1:00:36] and state
[1:00:37] what are they going to do now I told you
[1:00:40] that these seals are relevant to today
[1:00:42] we need to recognize this that this even
[1:00:44] happens today part of Satan's job in his
[1:00:48] power as a in this black Court's power
[1:00:50] this ability that he has to make you
[1:00:53] hopeless
[1:00:55] to make you hopeless to make it so dark
[1:00:57] remember that it wasn't just the middle
[1:00:59] the Dark Ages that were dark have you
[1:01:01] ever seen the way the angel of the Lord
[1:01:03] Drew out the church ages it was not here
[1:01:05] there was a little there was there was
[1:01:07] there was dark there was light and then
[1:01:09] it got darker and darker and then it got
[1:01:11] lighter and lighter but in the labor to
[1:01:12] see an age what happened it got dark
[1:01:14] again
[1:01:15] brother Brandon said it was a complete
[1:01:17] blackout
[1:01:18] and he only left just a little bit of
[1:01:20] light for the sake of the Bride
[1:01:22] right oh my see we live in that hour a
[1:01:25] time like that when Satan controls the
[1:01:28] church and state
[1:01:30] and you don't recognize it but it's true
[1:01:32] he controls the whole system
[1:01:34] now look look how hopeless it would have
[1:01:36] been for them who lived during that age
[1:01:38] he said all didn't agree with
[1:01:39] Catholicism was killed that's the reason
[1:01:42] he was on a dark horse
[1:01:44] he just controlled everything
[1:01:46] he gets off his red horse of going
[1:01:48] slaughtering people gets on his Dark
[1:01:51] Horse where he controls every detail of
[1:01:54] their lives
[1:01:56] that's what he still wants to do today
[1:01:59] I thank God for the message of the hour
[1:02:00] which is a message of Deliverance
[1:02:04] in a time in a time of total blackness
[1:02:07] in a timing of gross Darkness since the
[1:02:10] Bible said be gross Darkness on the
[1:02:12] people that's the age we live in Gross
[1:02:13] Darkness on on your workplace growth
[1:02:15] starting us on the schools gross
[1:02:17] Darkness on the churches but during that
[1:02:19] time he set a rise and shine for thy
[1:02:21] light has come
[1:02:23] the age that we live in oh that ought to
[1:02:25] make every one of us rejoice
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:28] look it was just hopelessness of the
[1:02:31] Dark Ages he said Catholicism had taken
[1:02:35] over he said now watch all hope was gone
[1:02:41] that's his black horse
[1:02:43] you think he still don't ride that today
[1:02:46] hopelessness
[1:02:49] now think about that for a minute
[1:02:52] so we go on here he is on his black
[1:02:55] horse now coming forth Dark Age I
[1:02:59] couldn't do nothing without the Catholic
[1:03:01] Church snuffing it out
[1:03:03] every little Revival he stamped on it
[1:03:06] yes every little move of God he put him
[1:03:08] in prison yes
[1:03:10] threw away the key
[1:03:11] he could excommunicate them take away
[1:03:14] their their life take away their
[1:03:15] livelihood take away their money he
[1:03:17] could do whatever he wanted to yeah he
[1:03:19] was in control
[1:03:21] he says they've gotten power he said
[1:03:24] just about the time the church got set
[1:03:27] up and got empowered they smothered out
[1:03:29] everything else
[1:03:31] he said now there is your Dark Horse
[1:03:33] representing that Dark Age
[1:03:36] now all Hope's gone no hope at all
[1:03:39] everything looked dark
[1:03:42] for the little believers
[1:03:44] his balances or his scales in his hand
[1:03:47] you see calling out measure of wheat for
[1:03:50] a penny three measures of barley for a
[1:03:52] penny he said see actually that is we
[1:03:55] and barley is the natural staff of life
[1:03:57] that's what bread and stuff is made from
[1:04:00] but you see he was charging for this
[1:04:02] so now watch he said what it means is
[1:04:04] that he was charging his subjects for
[1:04:07] the kind of the hope of life
[1:04:09] that he was sending out to them
[1:04:12] so he was making them pay for Darkness
[1:04:17] it was a spirit of Darkness that in
[1:04:20] order to have any glimmer of hope now
[1:04:23] brother Madam taught us about America he
[1:04:24] said America is like a a little boy
[1:04:26] whistling going through a graveyard
[1:04:28] right makes you pay for comedy hey come
[1:04:32] on church maybe you pay for the kind of
[1:04:35] hope
[1:04:38] listen to me he's trying to do the same
[1:04:40] thing today
[1:04:42] makes you pay
[1:04:43] to have any kind of entertainment
[1:04:45] try to make you pay to have any kind of
[1:04:48] Hope in your life or other other words
[1:04:49] you're just going to work going to
[1:04:51] church going home
[1:04:53] right he's got control of everything
[1:04:54] can't seem to get my healing can't seem
[1:04:56] to get right
[1:05:02] he started making them pay
[1:05:04] making them pay for prayers
[1:05:06] charging for prayer they still do it now
[1:05:09] that Spirit still exists today
[1:05:12] you've seen it on TBN haven't you
[1:05:17] send me a 50 donation and I'll send you
[1:05:19] this book cost me 50 cents to print
[1:05:23] or I'll send you this little trinket for
[1:05:25] 50 bucks
[1:05:27] or 500 bucks whatever it is
[1:05:30] what was it paying for a hope
[1:05:33] you sold this seed you'll get something
[1:05:35] back
[1:05:36] in that layout of seeing
[1:05:38] now I believe in sowing to see you can
[1:05:40] get something back I believe in that
[1:05:42] biblical principle but but we're not
[1:05:44] listen there's no force in it that
[1:05:47] there's no there's nobody's going to
[1:05:49] come to your door and knock on your door
[1:05:50] if you don't pay your ties maybe I
[1:05:52] shouldn't have said that but
[1:05:55] nobody's gonna come knocking nobody it's
[1:05:58] voluntary
[1:05:59] right there's no Force to it I'm not
[1:06:02] gonna I'm not gonna quit praying for you
[1:06:04] because you didn't pay your tithes you
[1:06:06] didn't pay the right offering I'm not
[1:06:07] going to treat you any differently
[1:06:09] are you with me now because we don't
[1:06:12] charge
[1:06:13] for the hope of life
[1:06:16] now watch he was starting at that very
[1:06:18] time of making them pay for prayers
[1:06:20] charging for prayer they still do it no
[1:06:22] Venus
[1:06:24] what's interesting if you go if you look
[1:06:27] on the iTunes app store if you go on
[1:06:29] there and look at the app you can get a
[1:06:31] Catholic app a novena's app they still
[1:06:33] charge for it
[1:06:35] to get the good ones
[1:06:38] all right they have little novenas you
[1:06:40] can say they're free they said but if
[1:06:42] you want the good ones
[1:06:43] that'll really help get them people out
[1:06:45] of purgatory
[1:06:47] right right then you got to pay for it
[1:06:49] pay extra
[1:06:51] give me that Spirit of charging you
[1:06:53] don't charge
[1:06:55] I hope you understand this you really
[1:06:57] there was a there's a fundamental
[1:06:59] problem if we start charging
[1:07:01] for the message
[1:07:04] we don't do that don't charge for Hope
[1:07:06] of life
[1:07:07] we financed what we can't even this
[1:07:09] church we're not going to start begging
[1:07:11] you for money to build new a new church
[1:07:13] or or two or to do anything like that
[1:07:16] we're not going to beg you for money to
[1:07:17] do that if we have the money we'll do
[1:07:19] the very best that we have with the
[1:07:20] money we have but we're not going to
[1:07:21] start charging for the hope of life
[1:07:24] well brother man liking that he said
[1:07:26] they said well you know we could save
[1:07:28] the world if we had enough money he said
[1:07:29] that's not the truth
[1:07:31] nobody all God needs is a man in his
[1:07:34] hand if you just get one man in his hand
[1:07:37] he could go to the part of the world
[1:07:39] that there's a predestinated seat in and
[1:07:41] he began to it began to change that and
[1:07:43] and that one will come in at the right
[1:07:46] time
[1:07:47] so we do everything we can with what we
[1:07:49] have but we don't charge for nothing
[1:07:51] because what was he doing capturing the
[1:07:53] wealth of the world the scale weighing
[1:07:56] out measure of wheat for a penny three
[1:07:57] measures of barley for a penny Rider on
[1:08:00] a black horse she he was stripping his
[1:08:02] subjects of their money
[1:08:04] listen he said brother Ben you've just
[1:08:06] been typing this no I haven't he said
[1:08:08] you see where that old money taken in
[1:08:09] church comes from
[1:08:12] said get away from that stuff
[1:08:14] to build an organization now what he's
[1:08:16] what's he talking about he's not talking
[1:08:17] about offerings brother Brown instead of
[1:08:18] service wasn't complete without an
[1:08:20] offering he's talking about that getting
[1:08:22] up I've been there in denominational
[1:08:23] Church to say who will pledge 500 and
[1:08:26] and who who'll pledge a thousand and
[1:08:28] stand there and just beg and beg it was
[1:08:29] the biggest part of the service
[1:08:31] he said you see what that oh where that
[1:08:33] old money taking Church comes from get
[1:08:35] away from that stuff to build an
[1:08:36] organization a big something million
[1:08:38] dollar here he said you see what the
[1:08:40] mother of it is he was charging for that
[1:08:43] kind of a life that he was given to his
[1:08:45] subjects charging for Prayer by the
[1:08:47] priests to pray people out of purgatory
[1:08:49] charging
[1:08:51] now look that's what a novena is it's a
[1:08:54] prayer when you say it it it
[1:08:58] it gives them a little relief
[1:09:01] and if you could be good enough and say
[1:09:03] it enough and pay enough
[1:09:05] you might get them out of Torment
[1:09:08] because the Catholics do not believe
[1:09:10] that the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[1:09:12] you from all sin
[1:09:13] they believe that everybody has to go to
[1:09:16] a place Between Heaven and Hell because
[1:09:17] nobody's good enough to go to heaven and
[1:09:20] so that everybody has to go for the
[1:09:21] doctrine of purgatory come from because
[1:09:23] they realize people aren't living it
[1:09:25] well you can't live it without the
[1:09:26] spirit of Christ and the truth is we
[1:09:28] don't rely on your own Works to get into
[1:09:30] heaven anyway you rely on the blood of
[1:09:32] Jesus Christ you're justified by faith
[1:09:34] alone
[1:09:35] but the Catholic Church said well no
[1:09:37] one's going to have to get into heaven
[1:09:38] so there must be a place Between Heaven
[1:09:40] and Hell where they just stay in that
[1:09:43] state until somebody down here Works
[1:09:45] them through it
[1:09:47] because they didn't do enough work
[1:09:48] themselves
[1:09:50] and he said somebody have to charge for
[1:09:51] that bring the wealth of the world to
[1:09:53] him into himself into the church itself
[1:09:56] and he is still writing
[1:09:59] he said oh sure he is
[1:10:01] yes sir
[1:10:02] still writing
[1:10:04] but I thank God for a voice
[1:10:08] because in the middle of that darkness
[1:10:10] in the middle of that Dark Age a voice
[1:10:12] spoke out
[1:10:14] Hallelujah Revelation 6 6 I Heard a
[1:10:17] Voice
[1:10:18] sure I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[1:10:21] four beasts I Heard a Voice in the midst
[1:10:23] of the 4B say a measure of wheat for a
[1:10:25] penny three measures of barley for a
[1:10:27] penny and see thou hurt not
[1:10:30] the oil
[1:10:32] and the wine
[1:10:33] now brother Branham
[1:10:36] oh my brother Branham taught us that the
[1:10:39] oil symbolizes the spirit are you still
[1:10:41] with me tonight
[1:10:42] if the Holy Spirit Leviticus 8 12 is one
[1:10:45] of the references he poured the
[1:10:46] anointing oil upon Aaron's head and
[1:10:48] anointed him to sanctify him zechariah's
[1:10:50] Vision where he talks about how that the
[1:10:53] oil was flowing to the golden pipes and
[1:10:55] he answered and speaking to me this is
[1:10:57] the word of the Lord unto cervable
[1:10:59] saying not by might nor by power but by
[1:11:01] my spirit saith the Lord
[1:11:03] so this is the spirit of God you've
[1:11:06] talked about the foolish and the wise
[1:11:07] virgins Matthew 25 3 they that were
[1:11:10] foolish took their lamps took no oil
[1:11:11] with them but the wise took all in their
[1:11:13] vessels with their lamps he said now oil
[1:11:16] typifies spirit and wine symbolizes
[1:11:18] stimulation of Revelation all in wine in
[1:11:21] the Bible he said is associated together
[1:11:23] always you find that if you go put oil
[1:11:25] and wine into a search engine brother
[1:11:27] Branham didn't have that he looked it up
[1:11:29] into concordance but if you took oil and
[1:11:31] wine together in a search engine and
[1:11:33] just put it together you'll find all
[1:11:34] kinds of references will come up
[1:11:36] including Joel 2 23 he said be glad then
[1:11:39] you children who died and rejoice in the
[1:11:41] Lord your God he hath given you the
[1:11:42] former Reign moderately he will cause to
[1:11:44] come down for you the rain the former
[1:11:46] rain the latter rain in the first month
[1:11:47] the floors should be full of Wheat and
[1:11:49] the fat shall overflow with wine and oil
[1:11:52] right so they would be restored now and
[1:11:55] it's that way off to the scripture he
[1:11:57] said when the truth of a promised word
[1:11:59] of God has been truly revealed to his
[1:12:02] Saints how many Saints do we have here
[1:12:05] you say oh brother Ben I'm not a saint
[1:12:06] you don't understand what a saint is a
[1:12:08] saint is a Sanctified one how many
[1:12:10] Saints do we have here you've been
[1:12:12] washed in the blood of the Lamb amen and
[1:12:14] so when it's been revealed to his Saints
[1:12:17] it's filled with oil they all get
[1:12:19] stimulated oh
[1:12:21] yeah
[1:12:22] now I know one has a different effect on
[1:12:25] some people than it does on other people
[1:12:26] but they all get stimulated
[1:12:29] he said Gloria I feel it right now
[1:12:32] stimulated with joy shouts
[1:12:35] he said well we don't need that anymore
[1:12:37] oh you don't need the stimulation of
[1:12:39] Revelation you must not feel the
[1:12:41] darkness of this age pressing in on you
[1:12:43] but I Heard a Voice it said don't hurt
[1:12:46] the don't hurt the wine don't hurt the
[1:12:48] oil
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:51] and so he said the the truth of the
[1:12:54] promise word has been revealed they all
[1:12:55] get stimulated stimulated with joy
[1:12:57] shouts and when it does it has the same
[1:13:00] effect upon them that wine does upon a
[1:13:04] natural man
[1:13:05] because when the Revelation has been
[1:13:07] given of the truth of God and the True
[1:13:09] Believer filled with oil and the
[1:13:11] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[1:13:13] becomes so great that he makes him love
[1:13:16] the way brother Brandon but it says
[1:13:17] behave himself unnormally
[1:13:21] so whichever way you would act normally
[1:13:24] you don't act normal anymore
[1:13:27] you begin I don't care who you are if
[1:13:29] you get it if you get enough of the wine
[1:13:31] you begin to behave yourself unnormally
[1:13:36] all right take some of this real quiet
[1:13:38] maybe they maybe they start talking
[1:13:40] somebody that talks all the time maybe
[1:13:41] they get real quiet maybe somebody oh
[1:13:43] start crying maybe somebody gets real
[1:13:45] joyful but it's just something it does
[1:13:47] to you it just takes you out makes you
[1:13:49] comfortable takes you out of yourself
[1:13:50] don't you see it's stimulation of
[1:13:52] Revelation he said that's right makes
[1:13:54] them behave themselves unseemingly and
[1:13:57] he says see that's what's the matter
[1:13:58] with them right now
[1:13:59] and why he said that is because people
[1:14:01] were shouting yeah
[1:14:03] huh
[1:14:04] go listen to the tape
[1:14:06] so he begins to talk about the upper
[1:14:08] room and he talked about how that when
[1:14:10] they went into the upper room he said
[1:14:11] they he said if you want a scripture for
[1:14:13] it it's Acts 2. and he said if you go
[1:14:16] into the upper room and and they begin
[1:14:18] to tell one another well I believe we've
[1:14:20] stayed here long enough we've been here
[1:14:21] seven days I think that's long enough I
[1:14:23] I think we're good message Believers so
[1:14:25] we can say it that way I think we're
[1:14:27] we're okay we just go on out and preach
[1:14:30] I think it's time we just went out and
[1:14:32] preached but he said Peter had the keys
[1:14:33] to the kingdom he said not yet boys
[1:14:36] he said wait until
[1:14:38] wait until
[1:14:39] and so so he said you stay here until
[1:14:42] you stay there until Joel's prophecy
[1:14:45] comes to pass until Isaiah's prophecy is
[1:14:48] Vindicated so you stay and you wait on
[1:14:51] the promise of God and then you begin to
[1:14:53] see the Vindication of that of what God
[1:14:56] promised in the age that you live in
[1:14:57] Isaiah 28 11 for which stammering lift
[1:15:00] and another tongue will he speak to this
[1:15:02] people to whom he said this is the rest
[1:15:04] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[1:15:06] rest and this is the refreshing yet they
[1:15:08] would not hear
[1:15:10] so what is it here would come a people
[1:15:12] where this rest would come this
[1:15:14] refreshing would come he said what is
[1:15:16] wine in the Bible refreshments this is
[1:15:18] the refreshment that comes from the
[1:15:20] presence of the Lord so you see wine
[1:15:22] represents stimulation of Revelation and
[1:15:25] when the Holy Ghost fell and they seen
[1:15:28] the fire of God fall upon them mine that
[1:15:31] begin to stimulate them
[1:15:35] I think
[1:15:37] you know I've heard it said that if you
[1:15:39] if you sing if you sing a song Run That
[1:15:42] lyric through through your brain first
[1:15:44] I wonder if we don't need to run it
[1:15:46] through our hearts
[1:15:49] the blood will never lose its power
[1:15:51] the hell ought to stimulate somebody
[1:15:56] he is our peace who has broken down
[1:15:59] every wall that ought to stimulate
[1:16:00] somebody Amazing Grace how sweet to
[1:16:03] sound it saved directs like me that
[1:16:05] ought to stimulate a response it's a
[1:16:07] revealed truth
[1:16:09] oh he didn't say it had to be some deep
[1:16:11] dark mystery but just revealed truth
[1:16:13] that's relevant for the age you live in
[1:16:15] revealed truth I see it sometimes I get
[1:16:18] so happy when I see you come to church
[1:16:20] because you are the revealed truth of
[1:16:22] the of the day I see Christ manifested
[1:16:24] in your life and I see you in the house
[1:16:26] of God and it makes me happy I begin to
[1:16:28] get stimulation because I see the
[1:16:30] revelation of God in your life when I
[1:16:32] see young people grow up and get married
[1:16:33] and start to serve God with all their
[1:16:35] heart yeah they have their ups and downs
[1:16:37] but we begin to see Christ identified in
[1:16:39] that couple what are we doing cause
[1:16:40] stimulation
[1:16:42] cause us to have joy
[1:16:45] because in all the ups and downs of Life
[1:16:47] somebody's representing the truth
[1:16:49] somebody is living the word of the hour
[1:16:53] I don't believe our services should ever
[1:16:55] be dull
[1:16:57] because if it's no you don't understand
[1:16:58] the word yeah that word that we have you
[1:17:01] don't understand the god that we serve
[1:17:03] you don't understand what time it is in
[1:17:05] the history you don't understand the
[1:17:06] darkness that's all around you but you
[1:17:08] don't understand the light that you have
[1:17:11] should never be dull
[1:17:12] there should be a stimulation of
[1:17:14] Revelation on the believer
[1:17:16] Hallelujah he said wine represents
[1:17:19] stimulation Revelation when the Holy
[1:17:21] Ghost fell they seen the fire of God
[1:17:23] fall upon them he said my that began to
[1:17:25] stimulate them the first thing you know
[1:17:27] they got so stimulated to the people
[1:17:28] actually thought they were drunk but
[1:17:30] they were stimulated by the Revelation
[1:17:32] he said my God here it is God's
[1:17:34] Vindicated Revelation made plain to them
[1:17:36] they was happy about it
[1:17:38] God promised it here it was revealed to
[1:17:41] them and Vindicated to them amen he said
[1:17:43] here was a man standing there saying
[1:17:45] this is that God always used a man he
[1:17:48] never used a mechanical device he used a
[1:17:50] man to stand at the word of the hour and
[1:17:52] say this this is that this is that what
[1:17:57] you are what the word said you would be
[1:17:59] and when the when you see that when you
[1:18:01] see it begin to come to pass it
[1:18:02] stimulates you
[1:18:04] God promised it amen God promised it
[1:18:07] here was revealed to them and Vindicated
[1:18:09] to them amen God promised me my children
[1:18:12] I see it as a revelation it brings joy
[1:18:14] to my heart God promised me my my
[1:18:16] healing I see it as a revelation even
[1:18:18] before the symptoms leave I see it as a
[1:18:21] revelation it brings joy to my heart
[1:18:24] when the Revelation opens up to me
[1:18:27] God promised it
[1:18:28] here it was revealed to them and
[1:18:31] Vindicated to them
[1:18:33] here was a man standing there saying
[1:18:34] this is sad this is it and there it was
[1:18:37] being Vindicated by the same sign that
[1:18:40] we have today
[1:18:42] the Holy Ghost is still here
[1:18:45] Hallelujah
[1:18:47] okay Peter boldness
[1:18:49] he walks out there and he begins to
[1:18:50] preach
[1:18:52] Hallelujah he said oh you men of Judea
[1:18:55] he was scared to death before he was
[1:18:57] saying he wasn't even one of them but
[1:18:58] now he began to preach he said you
[1:19:00] crucified Christ but there's hope
[1:19:02] there's a way out
[1:19:04] he said oh how wonderful revealed
[1:19:06] revealed they become so stimulated when
[1:19:08] they seen it Vindicated he said that
[1:19:09] just always does that someone say always
[1:19:12] such that always does when I see that
[1:19:15] God promised to do a certain thing in
[1:19:16] this day he said he promised to break
[1:19:18] off these seals in this last day and you
[1:19:21] don't know the joy the glory when I seen
[1:19:23] him reveal this stand there and watch it
[1:19:24] happen
[1:19:25] he says in his search field he said he
[1:19:28] said I started to run and said I like to
[1:19:30] wake up wake up all the neighbors
[1:19:32] when he showed him early in the morning
[1:19:34] what it was why it was a promise of God
[1:19:36] being fulfilled
[1:19:38] and here I see it Vindicated made
[1:19:40] perfectly right you hear me say I feel
[1:19:42] religious he said that's what's the
[1:19:43] matter the stimulation is so bad I just
[1:19:45] about ready to go cutting up you know
[1:19:46] stimulation from Revelation they become
[1:19:49] so stimulated over the Revelation listen
[1:19:51] that they Vindicated the promise
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:19:57] so the stimulation was part of the
[1:20:01] promise
[1:20:02] I hope you hear me now you say well it's
[1:20:04] word only it is but the word said yeah
[1:20:08] the word said that that his Spirit would
[1:20:10] fall young men shall prophesy old men
[1:20:12] shall dream to all those things the word
[1:20:14] said that we could have her healing the
[1:20:16] word said we could have joy the word
[1:20:18] said that's part of the word and the
[1:20:20] stimulation they received actually
[1:20:22] worked to fulfill the word and
[1:20:24] Vindicated the promise in them
[1:20:27] hallelujah amen oh I love it he
[1:20:30] Vindicated the promise in them
[1:20:33] now watch he said oh my they broke out
[1:20:35] the joy of stimulation to the people
[1:20:38] said they're drunk on new wine when God
[1:20:40] revealed his promise to them not only
[1:20:42] did he reveal it but he proved it yeah
[1:20:44] look at the woman at the well
[1:20:46] oh my now look look at the woman at the
[1:20:49] well
[1:20:50] and and he said then the stimulation
[1:20:52] started
[1:20:53] and and he talked about how Jesus come
[1:20:55] to her and he told her about to he told
[1:20:58] her what was wrong with her he told her
[1:21:00] the revelation of her life he revealed
[1:21:02] to her the revelation of the word and
[1:21:04] then she said I perceive you're a
[1:21:05] prophet she said when Messiah comes he's
[1:21:08] he's supposed to do these things and he
[1:21:09] said I had to speak to you and he
[1:21:12] what did she do
[1:21:13] she got some stimulated she ran
[1:21:16] that's what the Bible says
[1:21:18] he said away she went shouting
[1:21:22] yeah glory to God
[1:21:24] she didn't go like a Baptist
[1:21:26] forgive me if you're Baptist tonight man
[1:21:29] she didn't walk back here
[1:21:31] Oh Our Father you know well good message
[1:21:34] today
[1:21:35] Levi go home think about it for a while
[1:21:39] that's so wonderful wasn't that
[1:21:41] wonderful just no shook hands with
[1:21:43] somebody on that wonderful it's not what
[1:21:44] she did
[1:21:45] she ran
[1:21:47] she went away shouting
[1:21:49] and she went down through the city
[1:21:52] he said now she left her old water pot
[1:21:55] her old denomination yeah I went down
[1:21:58] there and said to the men come and see
[1:22:01] now brother Brian said if you only knew
[1:22:03] the Eastern tradition he said that's
[1:22:05] wrong for her to do that maybe we got
[1:22:06] some of them Eastern Traditions today
[1:22:09] if you knew the Eastern tradition that's
[1:22:11] wrong for her to do that he said yes to
[1:22:13] a woman of that time nobody would listen
[1:22:15] to her
[1:22:16] she should not make a commotion she
[1:22:18] should stay in the background
[1:22:20] that's what they said she should say he
[1:22:22] said no sir she she had a mark and if
[1:22:25] she would go down the street like that
[1:22:26] and act like that the men of the street
[1:22:28] would pay no attention of her but
[1:22:30] brother she had a Word of Life there
[1:22:32] she was stimulated it was like trying to
[1:22:34] put a house out on fire on a windy day
[1:22:37] he said oh there's something fan on it
[1:22:38] she was ready
[1:22:39] John Wesley told his young preachers
[1:22:41] they said well how should we preach he
[1:22:43] said you just get so on fire for God two
[1:22:45] people come from miles around to watch
[1:22:47] you burn
[1:22:50] people go look at the fire don't they
[1:22:52] you see a great big fire you stop you
[1:22:54] slow down you want to look and see what
[1:22:56] it is amen she got so on fire hey but
[1:22:59] she wasn't a preacher but she was the
[1:23:00] first one to witness the gospel in that
[1:23:02] town she'd come to them and she said
[1:23:04] come see a man who told me all the
[1:23:06] things that I ever did
[1:23:07] hey man he said you couldn't put that
[1:23:10] out that was God's fire burning she said
[1:23:12] if you don't believe it he said you just
[1:23:14] come over here where the meeting is
[1:23:15] going on I'll show it to you
[1:23:17] and so the men went out there he said he
[1:23:19] didn't now listen listen to this you'd
[1:23:21] say well if I if I saw brother Branham
[1:23:23] appear Discerning the secrets of the
[1:23:26] heart then I believe
[1:23:29] oh Church
[1:23:31] Brother Francis he did it one time
[1:23:34] never did it for the men
[1:23:37] he just did it for her
[1:23:39] you realize that entire group
[1:23:42] of Samaritans remember he said it had to
[1:23:44] come to the Jews
[1:23:45] the sign of the Messiah had to be shown
[1:23:47] to the Samaritans had to be shown at the
[1:23:49] end time to the Gentiles
[1:23:51] right but the entire group it was shown
[1:23:54] once
[1:23:56] once
[1:23:57] was enough for the Samaritans
[1:24:00] I'll say it like this once is enough for
[1:24:03] me
[1:24:04] if it had only been one time but it
[1:24:06] wasn't one time it was thousands and
[1:24:08] thousands of times today everybody's
[1:24:09] like well if you just say a word if I
[1:24:10] could just get a word of discernment for
[1:24:12] me no I believe God could do that but
[1:24:14] don't you realize what's been done he
[1:24:17] said he did it one time he didn't do it
[1:24:19] one more time but they knew something
[1:24:21] that happened to that woman
[1:24:23] she would change so they believed him
[1:24:29] brother Paul that's that's the greatest
[1:24:31] testimony
[1:24:32] of this message
[1:24:34] I was changed
[1:24:36] so they believe him
[1:24:39] you want people to believe you want your
[1:24:42] kids to believe the message
[1:24:43] I was changed so they believed him
[1:24:47] I remember the JT's not here tonight but
[1:24:49] I I remember brother JT when he was much
[1:24:52] younger I love that man
[1:24:54] I I love all of you but but JT and I
[1:24:57] have been close been through a lot and I
[1:24:59] remember his son one time Steve who
[1:25:01] passed away in a in a tragic automobile
[1:25:03] accident
[1:25:04] but their son Steve had had told me he
[1:25:08] would help me move he'd come to church
[1:25:09] for a little while and then he quit
[1:25:12] and he was helping me move and I was
[1:25:13] talking to him about his soul I said
[1:25:15] Steve I said why don't you come back to
[1:25:17] church I said we we love you and we'd
[1:25:19] like to see you back in the house of God
[1:25:20] he said you know he said I just don't
[1:25:22] want to come to us right I said I don't
[1:25:24] want to be a hypocrite I said well
[1:25:26] we're all Hypocrites on some level
[1:25:30] it's hard to live you know just
[1:25:32] legalistically you got to trust in the
[1:25:34] blood of Jesus I was telling him these
[1:25:36] things and and he's telling me he said
[1:25:37] well he said you know
[1:25:38] he said I tell you what he said I want
[1:25:40] what my dad had
[1:25:42] called him dad his steps and say I want
[1:25:44] what dad had
[1:25:45] he said because when Dad married my mom
[1:25:47] said he was a drinker he was he would he
[1:25:51] would do all those things he said but I
[1:25:52] saw the day he got saved
[1:25:54] he'd come home and everything changed
[1:25:57] he was old enough to remember everything
[1:25:59] changed he said if I ever come to Christ
[1:26:01] he said I want what dad had
[1:26:04] yeah I said God help us today if we're
[1:26:06] changed
[1:26:07] people will believe it
[1:26:09] people will believe him
[1:26:12] I believe he's in glory today I believe
[1:26:13] the Lord took him home he had a hard
[1:26:15] time had a hard time living it I believe
[1:26:17] the Lord took him home
[1:26:18] I've seen God do that many times God
[1:26:21] promised us our children he didn't say
[1:26:22] how
[1:26:24] promises they'd be there and I believe
[1:26:26] it
[1:26:28] but they knew say he knew something
[1:26:29] happened to JT because he wasn't that
[1:26:31] kind of person naturally I pray that my
[1:26:34] kids can see something happen to me
[1:26:37] I was never a drunkard I was never out
[1:26:39] there like that but I pray that they
[1:26:40] could see that the message has changed
[1:26:42] me made me a new person made me
[1:26:45] different oh I pray it's done something
[1:26:47] for you that your children can see that
[1:26:50] others can see they were still they were
[1:26:52] she was so stimulated by she was so
[1:26:54] changed about him she was changed so
[1:26:56] much that they believed him they
[1:26:58] believed on him she was so Changed by
[1:27:01] the revealing of the son of man the word
[1:27:03] that's what the revealing of the son of
[1:27:05] man is the discernment was only the sign
[1:27:07] of the son of man but the revealing of
[1:27:09] the son of man is the word is the
[1:27:11] opening of the word the fullness of the
[1:27:12] word she was so Changed by the revealing
[1:27:14] of the son of man word she was so
[1:27:16] stimulated by the message that they
[1:27:18] believed it oh you know they're not
[1:27:19] going to care about it if we don't care
[1:27:21] about it but if you care about it if you
[1:27:23] carry it with you if you become part of
[1:27:25] it if it becomes your life they care
[1:27:27] about it
[1:27:29] it'll produce something in your life
[1:27:32] Faith cometh by hearing hearing the
[1:27:34] promise of God the word of God watch it
[1:27:36] being made real
[1:27:37] because it's a seed when it's sowed
[1:27:39] it'll take life it'll produce just what
[1:27:42] it's talking about
[1:27:43] he said then what does it say to this
[1:27:45] writer in Black don't you hurt my wine
[1:27:47] and my oil and we're closing I know I've
[1:27:49] gone a little bit long on Wednesday but
[1:27:50] thank you for thank you for staying with
[1:27:52] me
[1:27:53] he said oh I've just got a little bit of
[1:27:54] it down there but there's still a little
[1:27:55] bit there
[1:27:57] amen he said now you can go on through
[1:27:59] and measure out all that kind of life
[1:28:01] that you're putting out that's up to you
[1:28:03] you're going to pay for it down there
[1:28:04] when you come across that wine in oil
[1:28:06] you leave it alone
[1:28:08] you said in other words like this if you
[1:28:10] catch some of my little flaw that's
[1:28:12] filled with my oil and wine see wine and
[1:28:14] all of the pure word and you're going to
[1:28:16] kill them because you're doing it that's
[1:28:18] what he was doing in that age he said
[1:28:20] they know where they're he said don't
[1:28:22] you force him to say hail Mary or do
[1:28:24] anything like that or some of your
[1:28:26] creeds
[1:28:27] keep your hands off of them they know
[1:28:29] where they're going for they are
[1:28:31] anointed with my oil and by being
[1:28:33] Anointed with my whole they have the
[1:28:35] wine of Joy because they know my Word of
[1:28:37] Promise I'm going to raise him up again
[1:28:42] I've thought about it before how that
[1:28:43] they would Gather in the catacombs and
[1:28:45] they would be hiding from the church
[1:28:49] not hiding from a Roman Emperor anymore
[1:28:51] but hiding from the church it must have
[1:28:53] been difficult to understand must have
[1:28:55] been difficult for him as their mothers
[1:28:57] and fathers and little babies everything
[1:28:59] else was taken and slaughtered
[1:29:01] and they gathered together in the
[1:29:03] catacombs and said and maybe you know
[1:29:05] wouldn't be like us gathering together
[1:29:06] so-and-so's not here today he's sick
[1:29:09] think about it together but John's not
[1:29:11] here today
[1:29:13] they killed him last week
[1:29:16] sister so-and-so was fed to the Lions
[1:29:19] imagine what kind of prayer requests
[1:29:22] you'd have in the early church
[1:29:24] think about it for a minute
[1:29:28] here's a little sister sitting there her
[1:29:30] husband's locked up somewhere she don't
[1:29:31] know if he's gonna be okay here's little
[1:29:33] brother and yet there was Joy
[1:29:37] Indescribable unexplainable Joy
[1:29:41] said by the bed I've been going through
[1:29:42] a lot but yet there's joy
[1:29:45] why is there Joy why is there joy
[1:29:47] unspeakable and full of Glory in a time
[1:29:50] when there's Darkness everywhere in a
[1:29:52] time when it seems like the that Beast
[1:29:54] system that Antichrist system controls
[1:29:56] everything how can you have joy because
[1:29:58] a voice spoke
[1:30:01] yeah
[1:30:02] a voice spoke into that age
[1:30:05] I'm talking about the voice of a man I
[1:30:07] will show you in just a minute a voice
[1:30:10] spoke into that age
[1:30:11] he said don't hurt the wine and oil
[1:30:15] just because you're sick doesn't mean he
[1:30:17] don't love you
[1:30:19] just because you know doesn't mean he
[1:30:22] don't love you anymore
[1:30:23] just because you have hard decisions to
[1:30:26] make doesn't mean he doesn't care
[1:30:28] He does care
[1:30:29] so he spoke into your age a word
[1:30:34] that would bring such an anointing on
[1:30:36] you that when it's because all of these
[1:30:39] things wrap up these things accumulate
[1:30:40] it's like a snowball it accumulates into
[1:30:42] our age
[1:30:43] all of the victories all of the
[1:30:45] overcoming all of the promises are
[1:30:48] accumulated in our age
[1:30:50] so we have the joy that they had when
[1:30:52] they were taken down to be to be burned
[1:30:54] at the stake
[1:30:58] how I could have joy
[1:31:01] it's kind of job
[1:31:05] they couldn't legally work
[1:31:08] they couldn't go to church legally
[1:31:13] they couldn't say that Jesus was God
[1:31:17] they couldn't be baptized if they were
[1:31:19] caught
[1:31:20] they did it anyway
[1:31:22] oh my
[1:31:23] yet they had the wine of Joy how do we
[1:31:25] know because he said touch not
[1:31:29] amen oh in the hours of my darkest
[1:31:32] struggle I'm so glad that the voice of
[1:31:35] the Lamb is spoken in my day and said
[1:31:37] touch not
[1:31:38] wine and the oil
[1:31:42] oh my
[1:31:44] he said they have the wine of Joy
[1:31:46] because they know my Word of Promise I'm
[1:31:47] going to raise them up again
[1:31:49] we find out he measured it out and
[1:31:51] charged for it exactly wheat natural
[1:31:53] life that's what they was living on
[1:31:54] symbolizing Spirit whole enjoy the wine
[1:31:56] that's spiritual life don't hurt that
[1:31:58] I'm so glad he leaves that for us you
[1:32:01] might be sick you might have troubles
[1:32:02] you might have financial trouble every
[1:32:04] other kind of trouble but he said don't
[1:32:06] touch the wine and the oil the things
[1:32:07] that really matter don't touch that
[1:32:11] did you notice that he said notice it
[1:32:13] was not one of the four beasts that said
[1:32:15] don't touch the oil in the line
[1:32:17] oh my God who was it I Heard a Voice in
[1:32:20] the midst
[1:32:21] Hallelujah what was it the lamb he said
[1:32:25] it wasn't the four beasts the lamb said
[1:32:27] it why he's going to take his own that
[1:32:29] belongs to him he is redeemed it can I
[1:32:32] say it this way tonight he belong you
[1:32:33] belong to him you belong to him don't
[1:32:36] you touch that oil
[1:32:37] he said not the four beasts but the lamb
[1:32:39] was the one that said it there here was
[1:32:41] the voice of the Beast voice of the
[1:32:43] writer so many voices in our day the
[1:32:45] voice of Satan the voice of the voice of
[1:32:48] people the voice of the age
[1:32:50] but here was the voice of the Lamb
[1:32:53] saying don't you touch that
[1:32:56] aren't you glad for that tonight
[1:32:58] he said to the best of my understandings
[1:33:00] musicians come
[1:33:01] best of my understanding the best that I
[1:33:03] know of with all that I believe in my
[1:33:06] heart he said that's the true meaning of
[1:33:07] those three seals I want to thank God
[1:33:10] for him I'll say this that it's the
[1:33:12] Revelation he give me he gave that to me
[1:33:14] the revelation of it he said and I do
[1:33:16] believe we're living in the last days
[1:33:25] this message is not a man's idea
[1:33:28] I know
[1:33:30] I get criticized sometimes I criticize
[1:33:32] myself
[1:33:33] I read a lot I I preach a lot I just
[1:33:35] repeat what brother Brandon said
[1:33:37] this message come from the throne
[1:33:40] it didn't come it wasn't just brother
[1:33:42] Brandon's idea something he had an idea
[1:33:43] of I'm not talking about the voice of a
[1:33:45] man but there was a voice of the Lamb
[1:33:48] that spoke in the midst
[1:33:50] of the message
[1:33:52] a voice of predestination but David that
[1:33:54] we heard
[1:33:55] and somehow in spite of the darkness in
[1:33:57] spite of the failures of men in spite of
[1:33:59] the troubles that were going on all
[1:34:00] around us in spite of sickness in spite
[1:34:02] of trouble in spite of loss in spite of
[1:34:04] Darkness
[1:34:06] unexplainable unexplainable Joy but
[1:34:09] Harold
[1:34:10] say
[1:34:12] maybe you just don't grieve like other
[1:34:14] people maybe I know we grieve I know we
[1:34:16] have trouble but there's something
[1:34:18] inside there's a joy
[1:34:20] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:34:23] Paul says we don't sorrow like others
[1:34:25] who have no hope
[1:34:27] There's Hope in the age that we live in
[1:34:29] because the lamb spoke
[1:34:32] I said don't touch the wine in the oil
[1:34:34] aren't you glad for the revelation of
[1:34:36] that third seal
[1:34:37] that's life to us
[1:34:39] message not a man's idea the message
[1:34:41] came from the throne when we realize
[1:34:43] that realize who we are that revelation
[1:34:46] will stimulate us to believe the word to
[1:34:49] live the word to rejoice in the word
[1:34:50] amen let's bow our heads together
[1:34:54] sorry I took long I well I wanted to
[1:34:57] stop at 8 20 we're right about there

[1:35:04] just so much there that we can say but
[1:35:09] I just
[1:35:12] maybe you experienced a little bit of
[1:35:13] that Darkness
[1:35:16] all these horses just ride out to the
[1:35:18] end
[1:35:20] seeing that deceiving that black horse
[1:35:23] maybe you've seen a little bit of that
[1:35:25] red horse that Force
[1:35:30] seen a little bit more of that black
[1:35:31] horse

[1:35:38] a Pale Horse
[1:35:40] rides today
[1:35:42] in the fourth seal
[1:35:45] hopelessness that's what the devil wants
[1:35:47] to do to you he wants to back you into a
[1:35:49] corner and say well there's no way out
[1:35:51] you might as well just give up why would
[1:35:54] you hold to the message
[1:35:57] why even bother believing why bother
[1:35:59] living it
[1:36:00] he said brother big you never feel that
[1:36:02] way you get up in the pulpit and preach
[1:36:04] oh you you don't know
[1:36:07] many times
[1:36:09] many times
[1:36:10] almost on a weekly basis I lay there at
[1:36:14] some point and think I can't do this
[1:36:17] I just
[1:36:19] it'd be so much easier if I just give it
[1:36:22] up
[1:36:23] if I didn't bother
[1:36:25] but I hear the voice of the Lamb
[1:36:30] speaking into the darkness
[1:36:34] so don't touch the line in the oil
[1:36:37] [Music]
[1:36:39] in my darkest times in the in the hour
[1:36:42] and when it seemed like the whole world
[1:36:44] was gonna go I'm glad I have this
[1:36:46] message

[1:36:49] happened to my bible glad I have a
[1:36:51] church I can go to

[1:36:57] everything else I know some of you that
[1:36:58] are watching you you want to be in the
[1:37:00] house of God so bad and you can't be but
[1:37:03] remember he said don't touch the wine in
[1:37:05] the oil you can have the stimulation of
[1:37:07] Revelation right where you're at
[1:37:10] stimulation of Revelation
[1:37:12] that that comes in because of the holy
