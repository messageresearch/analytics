and some of the ladies as well um brother John baduka passed away this morning he uh give my composure a little bit I I love brother John very much and uh i' been um trying to confirm this morning it was just this morning and uh we need to pray for his church uh we've been very close to them over the last few years probably goes back about eight or 10 years for me uh brother John every time I've went to Africa he's been there with me and uh I preach his EAS Easter convention uh last year I was planning on going uh this year as well and preaching with him and benine but the John was a great man of God he was a uh he was a leader there in his country in Togo and uh was well known all around the world he had spread the gospel to uh many different countries in Africa in fact fact he lost his daughter on a missionary trip uh he was a real missionary he he really loved this message had been pastoring for probably close to 40 years he was in his 60s and just passed away unexpectedly this morning and was a very good friend to me so y all pray for the family we're going to we'll find out about the funeral arrangements and things he was in the US they'll have to ship his body back and things but uh he's in a better place and every one of us have to go that route we'll either go by grave or by the Rapture but I'm looking forward to seeing brother John again and I trust I'll see every one of you there as well and that's what we want to do it's why we work it's why we do what we do but uh but John just meant a lot to me and uh you just pray for those that loved him I know brother Ivy is in France today I spoke with him this morning and he loved him as well and just meant a lot to us and I'm I'm a little bit of a baby you had to forgive me but I'm glad I'm that way I don't want to ever get hard towards these things people mean a lot to me and I want to see you everyone make it that's why we do what we do that's why we preach we want to we want to see you make it we want to we want to spend eternity together and sit down at that table that's thousands of miles long I I just believe it'll be there I don't know how it'll be I just believe we'll do it somehow we'll sit there and and I'll meet some of those people that I preached to and preached with and and so you just pray for the church and and the family and I'm sure God will take care of them as well let's Stand Together just had to get my composure for a moment Genesis chapter 13 as we continue to speak about Abraham today Genesis 13-14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou Thou Art northward and South norward and Eastward and Westward yes other words look in every direction as far as you can see all all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it of it yes I will give it unto thee do you believe that promised today he said I will give it unto thee then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamory which is in Hebron and built there an altar unto the Lord I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word this morning you may be seated lot is Abram's nephew his brother's son was a part of his father Tara's household when God called Abram by Grace he commanded him to leave his country and his Kindred and specifically his father's house he said get out of thy country from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and so he was specifically commanded to do that his father's house would be his Nativity his Kindred his Nativity his Kindred uh his uh his father's uh household and we know that lot was a part of that now we don't know why Abraham did not fully obey God at that time but I I think it may have been for the right reasons or he thought that it was the right reasons because he wanted to take care of lot he probably felt close to lot didn't want to hurt him and he may have felt responsible for him since lot's father Abraham's brother had passed away and yet we know that Abraham and lot were of different values in God's economy and brother brandom says it like this he put it so wonderfully he said all these Believers he said so he identifies lot in this place as a Believer he said all these Believers as we could go on for hours he said all these were like a bunch of change out of your pocket in God's hands he said you pull out a bunch of change there's pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars dollars all in coins he said now that's what the world is in God's hand there is some people that just can't have a penni's worth of it and God can only use them in a penny way he said that's all they can buy he said don't reject them right don't reject them Abraham's separating from lot was not Abraham rejecting lot right what he had to separate from was unbelief right his journey the way that he's going as we talked about it last week it was an incredible uh thing that Abraham had to believe and lot did not have the capacity to believe like Abraham did he just didn't have that in him and yet he would could be a valuable part a part of God's economy but not like Abraham and so God had to make them go their separate ways even though Abraham had to go his way and lot had to go his way but it had to be a a place had to come that place and yet Abraham had to continue to love him and and to care for him brother B said don't reject them if they can't believe the real truth don't turn them down don't kick them out and say they're not in it because God uses pennies sometimes and I've told you many times before but darl Ward early on when I was probably 17 years old he told me brother Ben you may only be a dime worth of Minister that may be all that you'll ever be he said but if you only give God a nickel he said you're robbing God of five cents right and so that that that's the truth like our ad itude towards that matters God uses pennies sometimes Lord whatever I am let me be all of it let me be everything you've called me to be let me let me strive to enter into the kingdom of God and give the effort that's needed I know it's only by Grace I know it's only by election that I can be saved but let me put forth the effort that that would make me fulfill your will oh God so so lot was just a penny he said now he said Abraham was a silver dollar now what made the difference between the penny and the silver dollar wasn't natural birth they were closely related it wasn't gen genes physical genes what was it it was election all right election is the only thing that made the difference between Abram and lot right and so but yet brother R said it took a hundred lots to make an Abraham he said a 100 carnal Believers will never stand in the presence of a genuine Christian that's separated from the car things of the world living in Christ Jesus where the word can flow through him oh that's what I want to be I want to be one of those genuine Christians this morning that God can use as a silver dollar in the age that we live in h you know uh there's a theme park in Branson called Silver Dollar City and the reason it's called Silver Dollar City is because they used to give change there in silver dollars and when they would give change they did that on purpose so that people when they went to the gas stations when they went to the grocery stores that they would when they showed up with a silver dollar they said oh you've been to Silver Dollar City because they were using that money that they' given them which wasn't commonly used and don't you realize that's what we are we belong to God and when PE when we when we live our lives in the world people see who we are and where we came from you don't belong to Silver Dollar City you belong to the Eternal City you belong to the New Jerusalem amen you're a part of the Bride aren't you glad for that today so he said 100 Lots couldn't make an Abraham he can only take a Penny's worth that's all he's God right he said so you see people that say I don't believe in healing I don't believe in these things just know it's a penny but just let him alone all right just a Penny's worth so that's all he can buy don't stop him just let him alone he said remember that's just all the farther he can go right so that that's all that's all he can do just let him alone brother brandom titles uh that sermon that we was preaching that in God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief it does not say a total separation from unbelievers I I think we misinterpret that sometimes although at times an unbeliever can have such an influence in our lives that we we we we've got to go our separate ways there is a time for that and yet it is not a total separation from unbelievers cuz how you going to do that you couldn't even go to church right you could even live with yourself right right because because in our Even in our own selves we're a three-part being right we're a body flesh and spirit you could say it like this you're a you're a believer in your soul your spirit is kind of a make believer right because it it it can go either way and your flesh is an unbeliever right you can't even live with yourself but but so it's not separating from the people as much as it is separating from the unbelief right but but yet lot and Abraham had to go their separate ways now he just wasn't a a believer of the caliber of Abraham brother random calls him in other places a carnal believer or a make believer he said there is always three classes of people in a religious gathering Believers make Believers and unbelievers always them three he said and there they was there is the unbelieving sodomite the make believer lot and Abraham the elected church again he said another Street three classes of people the unbeliever make believer and believer he said now the unbeliever was the sodomite the make believer was Lot the normal Church the denominational church he said Abraham represented the church elected called out separated he wasn't in Sodom to begin with he said Oh my he said watch that angel never went to that other church he come to the elected Church oh Church you realize we we're walking a repeat brother brand said every believer walks that repeat of Abraham's Journey we're walking a repeat Fe of Abraham's Journey as we're walking by faith and with the angel has come to us and the son of man has been revealed in our day and so we we've had that experience with God and all we're waiting on now is the the change of our bodies aren't you glad for that today brother B said you've received your last sign and now we're waiting on the change of the body yes so what we need then is to separate from unbelief right usually within our own hearts right that's what I want to do this morning I just want Faith to be there look brother brandham talks about this he said Abraham is all Mortals not an immortal man not a man that can't make a mistake but constantly made mistakes but no matter how many mistakes he made his anchor still held for he had the promise he said so he took with him Sarah he took lot he took his daddy and as long as they was with him God could not bless him he said the old man finally died and they buried him he went on up a little farther and lot backslid and you know what happened there and then he separated himself from him Oh my he said then God appeared to him again and said now Abraham look all over the ground it's all yours when he made the right choice that's it separate yourself from everything so Abraham is elected but he's got to make a choice that will cause him to receive the benefits of his election but God knew what choices you would make yes and he knew what before he ever chose you he knew exactly what you how you would separate from unbelief and you would believe the word of the hour but even Sarah you say well Sarah's included in there well yes but Sarah was Abraham's wife she was an unbeliever too yes sir right she she laughed when God spoke but yet oh my yet God would not do away with her Abraham could not separate from her because they were they were one and brother BR typed that to us I'm getting kind of ahead of myself this morning but brother B typed that to us he said God could not destroy us when we disbelieve he said because we're part of him oh I'm so grateful for that today yes but we want to separate from unbelief yeah now uh brother brand said you know what happened there he separated himself he made the right choice he said maybe that's the reason some of us are not getting along so well we're holding on to things we ought to let go in the separation a little doubt a little Wonder right yeah a little skeptic wonder if it's right I read this quote to you last week but I'm just laying a a foundation some folks lay a foundation never finish the sermon but we're just kind of trying to get somewhere this morning he said but how could it be wonder if it's right could this be could that be cut loose this morning oh if could just we could just do that this will cut loose no let that little doubt go let that little skeptic go well I wonder if the message is right I wonder if brother the been a real Minister I wonder if the church is right just let all that go say Lord I want to receive whatever you've got for me today I want whatever you've got I don't want one Speck of doubt in my heart yes sir yes you you don't want to defend your doubts let them go cut them loose yes you may like them you know it may be your little nephew you know that you like and you want to keep him around but let him go are you with me now you might as well there's nobody so miserable as somebody who who who's not really living it and they know it or they're or or they're holding grudges and they know it and yet they still trying to serve God and trying to go to church and do a try and just let it go let it go there's no reason to hold on to it just let It Go Let it Loose and let God fill you with faith this morning he called you you're he knows you're able to do that that yeah amen that's good now he said cut it Loose this morning Hebrews 12 said let us lay aside every weight every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us the sin what is that the unbelief that does so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that set before us looking to Christ the author and finisher of our faith so again he's talking about separating from unbelief brother BR said God said Abraham in order to walk with me you've got to separate yourself from the rest of them he said uh he said God Demands a total separation but you want to bring a lot of the world along with you he said when you come in and receive the Holy Ghost you say well I was taught to be this and I was taught the days of Miracles has passed he said you better leave that thing behind as long as that holds with you it'd be like Abraham started out with lot and his father there's trouble in the camp yes see you you you've taken ideas from psychologists and philos opers and and and from parents and from and from your upbringing and from a denominational church somewhere and you got to separate from that before you can ever be helped by the gospel because it's it's a it's against the word of God and so anything now some your parents may be helpful but anything that they say that's against the word Let It Go your family may be helpful but anything they say that's against the word let it go this word's got to be Paramount in our lives it's got to have preeminence in our lives preeminence in the church if the word has preeminence then we can begin to see God move then we can begin to see Unity among the people then we can begin to see a power in the Church of God again and I want to see that I want that with all of my heart and I believe we see that but we want to continue we want to press further we want more than what we have now how we going to have it how we going to have it by putting the word back in preeminence again above my thoughts above my feelings above my hindrances above everything else yes amen I'm not amening myself as brother BR said but amen means so be it come on Hallelujah God never did bless Abraham until he separated himself he said and done what God told him to do you'll never receive the holy ghost in the fullness you'll never walk in the spirit of God until you totally separate yourself from your things from unbelief he said get away from the world come out of the world he said as soon as Abraham believed God by justification Believing on the Lord were Justified immediately God called Abraham to Total separation from all unbelief he said is that the way he did in you I I think we can all agree with that we may have been like Abraham and not immediately made a separation but he called us to it right it may have taken us some time it may you may still be working on that but he's called you to it he's called you to a total separation from unbelief he said is that the way he did in you separate yourself from your kindreds from all your Associates come out of the pool rooms come out of the danals come away from the things of the world God calls for a total separation to Abraham's seed because that's what he called Abraham and brother brandham uh illustrates that by using two instruments on the platform and saying one was Abraham and one was Abraham's seed and whatever works for Abraham works for Abraham's seed right now the Covenant was made to both Abraham and his seed after him and as Abraham was called by Grace by election so is his seed called oh my by grace and election they heard the voice of God now going back to last week you remember you got to hear it you got to have that experience you it's necessary that you hear from God you got to know that you heard from God yeah right but when you hear from God then you got to separate yourself from the things of the world he said Abraham was commanded uh to to to do that as Abraham was called by grace and election he said so is his seed called by grace in election they heard the voice of God and believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness he said you heard the voice of God in a barro everywhere it was at you believe God can do that absolutely he can do that he said and Abraham was commanded to abstain and to separate himself from the things of the world and so is the Seed of Abraham separate themselves from the seed of the things of the world right he said now as we find out Abraham never fully obeyed he said no that's the away with a lot of us people as soon as we go out and make a confession we think well now we've joined Church we're going to be pretty good people I I just need to preach this for a minute some of you young people you need to separate yourself yeah I don't mean separate yourself from the church that's the last thing you need to do I mean separate yourself from your ideas separate yourself from friends that are dragging you down separate yourself from unbelief that comes in tries to tell you that you're not going to make it separate yourself from those thoughts that tell you you're not worth anything and and there you're no good and and there's no power in your life you separate yourself from that let God move in your life let him do what he does separate yourself from worry constantly anxiety constantly in your life let it go cut it loose and let God begin to move and you begin to see something happen in your life some of us Elders need to separate ourselves from everything that's unlike the word oh we we we want bring this into it bring that into it let's believe the message of the hour let's believe the word that God brought let's believe that the Bible is true let's accept it and move forward right amen amen it's time we separated herself from unbelief yeah and just believed God hallelujah he said well now we'll go make a confession well we join Church we're going to be pretty good people we're neighbors said it won't hurt to smoke a lter won't if I just keep my card party that won't hurt anything but remember God never did bless Abraham until he fully obeyed and God will not bless his seed until you fully obey separating yourself from the things of the world if you're if you're messing around on the internet looking at things you shouldn't look at separate yourself from that that's why you sit under condemnation in the service separate yourself from those things let it go let it go you don't need it God's got a better plan for you he's got a better place for you good oh church I just feel his presence here this morning I want to separate from everything that's unlike unlike the Lord yes he said come out from among them be separate said Lord I will receive you touch not their unclean things you abide in me my word in you ask what you will and it'll be done to you in the Old Testament they had what they called a water of Separation It's Made From the Ashes of the red hepher and the red hepher is Christ that's a type of Christ and and so we could go into all of that but red is is a color of atonement it's a color of atonement and so the red hepher is Christ and brother brandom or Moses rather in the law in numbers 199 he says this a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp in a clean place so a man that is clean will lay them up in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it's a purification for sin verse 13 it says whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead dead and purifieth not himself defileth the Tabernacle of the Lord and that Soul should be cut off from Israel because the water of Separation was not sprinkled upon him he should be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him so now he had to there had to be a water of separation and if you went and touched a dead body you had to go get washed again now come on church we got to be washed and if you go out and touch and medle with the things of the world you need to come back and get washed again by the water of the word it's not just a one time thing but we're washed every time we hear the preaching of the word by the water of the word amen so he said the waters a separation is the word Paul said in Ephesians he has washed us with the water of the word see waterers a separation of the word preaching the word separates you don't you see why the devil hates that he wants to do away with that is preaching the word that separates you you hear the word and say I'm wrong I've done that many times Church many times you hear the word and you say I'm wrong I better quit this I'm playing church I better quit that he said see that's the Waters of Separation oh my just let yourself be washed by it he said it's the Waters of Separation Paul tells us in Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and and cleanse it with what with the washing of water yes by the word by the word if you know something's wrong just let go of it and and when you hear the preaching of the word say Lord I'm wrong I Repent that's all it takes it doesn't take a big show just say Lord I'm wrong I'm sorry and he'll begin to move in your life again amen I'm so glad for that kind of Grace I'm so glad for that kind of love that kind of blood what good would Grace do me if it left me in my sin yeah what good would Grace do me if it left me like living like I always live what good would election do me if it just left me out in the world in the muck and the mire but it didn't leave me there it called me out into the presence of God hallelujah amen sorry for screaming at you this morning but it's just stirring my heart in Ephesians Paul said he said over there that God by the preaching of the word the Waters of Separation Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word and the word of God is the Waters of separ separation for it's by renewing by the Water by the word hearing the word separates it he said now the unbeliever or the man in sin was outside he said here's a little part we don't want to pass that the water of Separation must be kept in a clean place and the preacher that preaches the gospel should be a clean upright man not a cigarette F fiend not a dope addict not a drunkard or a golf player on Sunday afternoon so forth like that no sir it must be kept in a clean Sanctified holy vessel one that holds the mystery of God in his heart other words he won't be doing these these things say well he didn't mention what I do but okay if your heart don't condemn you don't worry about it but if it does what he said the preacher that's where I stand this morning I got to hold the mystery of God in a clean Place hold the mystery of God in his heart must be in a clean church where they play Bingo in the basement Lottery have soup suppers what was the problem with soup suppers wasn't cuz they had had a potluck the problem with soup suppers was because they use it to pay the preacher instead of paying their tith right dances for the Young Folks preach the word amen preach that's what it we are no matter what happens Church no matter how we've got wonderful music we've got wonderful we' got wonderful programs we've got things we want to do with the children and and youth with the young people but the the thing we must do is preach the word the word must be declared across the pulpit we I've got an obligation to preach the word we've got to hold that high we've got to elevate that because that's the most important part of the service he said you don't have to have all this nonsense keep with the word and the word separates sinners from their sin yeah he said then every man out of Fellowship come up first through the waters of Separation at the congregation and he was sprinkled with these Waters now what was it the waters spoke of a dead sacrifice that went on before him the dead heer died in his place and when we preach the word it isn't on any denomination it's on Christ the sacrifice who died in your stead to sin Oh my he said you're out of Fellowship can't get prayer answered everything is black around you out of Fellowship come back to the word now yes he said the word goes to cutting separates you well you ought to do this you ought to do that this is here you don't have Fellowship no more you got yourself out of communion he said that's the Waters of Separation tells you what you should do right oh my we are separated from unbelief Washed by the Water of the word why do we have to be separated now think about it church we had to be separated for a union you know where I'm going right yeah all right we had to be separated for a spiritual union look at Romans chapter 7 Romans chapter 7 ver1 know you not brethren for I speak to them that know the law howth the law at dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband now look brother brandham took that spiritually he wasn't just looking at marriage and divorce he took it spiritually he said you had to be separated from your old husband right he had to die Hallelujah he had to Die the old man's got to die now you go read Romans chapter 7 I challenge you read Romans chapter 7 read Romans chapter 8 and when you get finally to Romans chapter 8 what what happens Romans chapter 88 vers1 there is therefore now when after separation there is therefore now after the invisible Union hallelujah hallelujah oh I love this after the invisible Union has been made oh there's been a secret wedding that's went on do you believe that church we've been United with the word we're we're being united with him here so we can go to the wedding supper there there's been a secret wedding ceremony going on and we and we're we're coming the word and as we as we are Washed by the Water of the word as we are separated from our sin what what what's going on Church what's happening is that now condemnation is being removed from us yes that's that's what we used to do that's who we used to be but God don't even see it [Applause] anymore yes there's a separation it's not just well don't do this and don't do that it's not just sanctification but it's actual separation and it's the killing of the old man yeah so you and I can be free right and live in the message of the hour the light of the hour listen sir there is therefore now no condemnation of them who are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh after the spirit he the bridegroom took away your shame you you've heard this read so many times but now think about it as along with Abraham separating from lot you've got to separate from unbelief right your old husband and then the bridegroom the only way you can do that is by the ashes of the red hepher right the Waters of Separation The Death his death on the cross and then when you accept that you believe that in this hour then he washes you by the water of the word he the bridegroom took away your shame put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life he said that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world yeah right so you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church no that doesn't sound right does it you're not washed by the church right cuz the church might not be completely clean right come on church not everybody you go to church with is going to be a believer and that's just the way it is but we love him anyway we right brother in every congregation there was three kinds of Believers but we don't kick them out let God let God do what God does because the truth is I'm a poor judge of who is and who isn't right right so we we just let we we let it go but but yet we we realize we must keep sin out of the church we got to do those things but we rely on the Holy Ghost to do those things as much as we can now now look you're and I believe the Holy Ghost is always right but now our first husband was the world and we are not washed by the church from the world so it's not that we reform people into believing the gospel you got to be washed by the word right not by the church now look he said that doesn't sound right no no you might find that in the almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word you are standing oh church I feel like preaching this is almost like it's almost like singing Standing on the Promises and everybody sitting down you can't hardly do that can you but you're standing he not talking about where you're literally standing what he talking about your positioning Christ you are standing all right Hallelujah sir that ought to give us such Faith like Abraham it ought to give us such faith God called me God elected me I am standing right someone say it with me this morning I am standing I am standing where are you standing completely yes completely all right now you got to believe it You' got to accept it but if you have you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning right Hallelujah sir how we can forgive people that's why we don't hold things against people because we know what we were yeah and what we came from and what God forgave us of and what God changed us from that's why we can let it go that's why we can we can we can love our enemies why because we know we were not standing in that place but he brought us into that place and we had nothing to do with it right he come in and he and he caused his word to be preached and it separated us from the things of the world we did not have our own desire we had his desire amen as though you never did it doesn't not give you great confidence that you you can see your brother and I know people say well you didn't completely know them maybe they weren't maybe they were a fraud maybe they were this sad of the other but I believe I'll see my brother again I believe that you'll see your friends and your family the ones that you that you love I believe you'll see them again not because that you got any any right to say that even by their own life because allers have sin and come short of the glory of God but because of the blood of Jesus Christ every one of us can only stand on the blood that's the only standing with have right are you with me now well you don't know what they've done well in his eyes that's right I don't think we even know what we've done that's right but he don't even see it no more Hallelujah so this is my message to the church now Hallelujah he said you're standing you are standing Hallelujah if you're standing on God's word how many are standing on God's word this morning if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every TT where are you standing I'm trying to tell you he said pull away from them Shucks what's he telling you there's got to be a separation from the Shu pull away from them Shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the sun pull away from them Pentecostal ideas them Baptist ideas them Lutheran ideas pull away from it and come out in the sun in the presence of the son Hallelujah he said I hear the coming of the combine you're standing I don't know you can choose not to believe a prophet's words I choose to believe it all right I choose to believe that he was inspired by God to say that and he said you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God see brother Ben you trying to stir people up I wish you'd get stirred up about about the fact that your sins are forgiven and you've been washed in the blood of the Lamb I wish we could get stirred up about it I wish we really understood it yeah I believe it'd make put a tear on our cheeks wouldn't it it put a shout of joy in our in our heart it put a it it put an amen on our lips if we only knew what he did for us right Hallelujah yes Hallelujah every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God God washed in the blood of Jesus Christ Oh Glory to God believes every word of God stands as though you never sined at the first place you are perfect thank you Lord come on Church why we let that devil beat up on us for God called you God elected you God separated you and if you're not separated but see that's the reason we have condemnation because of lack of Separation right but if we'll just let the word not anything we do just let the word do it let it separate us from the world and when we let it separate us from the world there is therefore now no condemnation right now look you are perfect oh my yeah I have never stood and brother Caleb and looked in the mirror in the morning while getting ready and looked at myself and said you are perfect you ever done that brother Harold problem may be the hair you know maybe he did his hair and just right you are perfect but I've never I've never even never even crossed my mind right because it's just so apparent so evident but Abraham right he believed he called those things which were and so they were not those things which were not as though they were and so you could today by the authority of the word of God you could stand and look in the mirror and say you are perfect why can you do that by the blood of Jesus Christ let anybody say what they want to say let people talk how they want to talk you are perfect in the eyes of Jesus Christ glory to God brother Bren said if I was supposed to die in the morning and a man took my place I cannot die for that sin yeah somebody took my place right and Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that I might become him the word he said let me hold true to it not the church the word yes said oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming wor and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated yes oh I love this yeah he said just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day now look how he ties this washing of the water of the word sometimes we read portions of this but I'm reading several paragraphs to you out of this message invisible Union because I want you to understand what he's saying he's saying that by the word that was coming forth in his own Ministry then that we were being Washed by the word that was oh God that was coming forth we were being washed by that because it was not something different from the Bible it was light on the Bible and when it come to us when that opening of the word came it actually opened Christ to us it opened Grace to us it opened Revelation to us of who he was and who we are so brother brand said just what the Bible said would happen it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts things taking place my he I couldn't even keep up with it we're near the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word he said the call of the Holy Spirit searching the hearts you're standing completely you never sinned at the first place Hallelujah God don't even know nothing you don't know it yeah that is the most incomprehensible thing about God I challenge you to find something something that is harder to understand than the fact that a God who knows everything that ever happened right now he ain't like me I may look at you today and forget your name tomorrow he don't do that I forgot my wife's name one time and we'd been married for 16 years at the time and a brother asked to be introduced to her Minister brother he and his wife were standing they were introducing El and and he said he said and this is and I said this is she said Britney yeah this is Britney that's how forgetful I am I'm so glad it's not up to me see it'd be easy it would be easy to believe that I forgot your sins I forget everything but he don't forget nothing right nothing he knows every detail of every thought of every you realize that church we try to hide from God and we try to we try to sit there and think well I'm going to hold on to this and God don't know he knows right he knows every detail of every thought that you've ever had right yeah right oh God he knows it he knows every not just you but everybody has ever born he is omniscient means all knowing means there's nothing he doesn't know except your sin somehow I hope you're with me this morning somehow out of all of this knowledge out of all this understanding out of all this this this this greatness of God he's so great that he cannot remember your sin he couldn't recall it if he wanted to church it's in the sea of forgetfulness Church the worst thing you can do is wallow in it so you made a mistake you messed up you messed up bad you messed up publicly don't wallow in it walk on you got to really repent there's got to be a real repentance in your heart there's got to be a real separation separation means you're going to do things differently you you repent you turn from it you walk a different walk yeah but you can't wallow in it right now we can't forget we're human beings but God has forgotten yeah and wallowing in your in your mistakes is not going to make you a better Christian right it's not going to help anybody getting depressed all the time because you're not what you once was that's not going to help nobody I just church I'm I'm here as your pastor this morning I got to preach it's not going to help nobody to sit there and talk about how bad you are and how how how wrong you are and all these things let it go and let God move in your life let him take care of it waiting on some great Supernatural something to happen there was something Supernatural happen in our day the seals were open and God spoke to you and said and said you or never did it in the first place be Washed by the Water of that word let it overcome you let it wash over you let it do away let it separate you from every thought of the enemy that's good amen hallelujah he said it's in the God don't even know nothing it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser yeah right listen when Jesus was tried he was falsely accused right he was falsely accused right he never did anything they accused him of doing now when the Devil comes before Christ oh my and tells him about your sin that you did that's been repented of you realize it's as false in the presence of God thank you amen all right God don't say I know they did it but I forgive them that's right he don't say that all right he says no they didn't do it rightall oh in fact he doesn't just say they didn't do it but he said you did it every oh God everything that the accuser accuses the bride up he puts it right back on him and said you did it they didn't do it oh church we that ought to make us that ought to make us jump the fuse today you did it he didn't do you didn't do it but he did it the devil did it you didn't do it from the first you were accused of it by the accuser but he's a false witness in the presence of God hallelujah oh glory to God he said really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washed and your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of Christ wash in the blood of Christ press ious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love whatever you are he said you are Servants of God whatever God wants you to do where your place is God placed in the church some Apostles prophets teachers p P he placed that by virtue of his own predestination you were that to begin with and how could we remove those offices from the church all right right you were that to begin with your first wedding was an olded it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that that would be God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and washed you by the water of the washing of the Water by the word the word not the denomination the word wash you but if you won't stand in the water water of the word now here's where we talk about separation again how you going to be washed said you're still as spotted as Eve was it's as simple as hearing the word preached and not fighting it if it's the word that's all it is hearing the word preach and accepting it oh God is washing for the JT listen there will be people who have committed murder or theft or adultery but because they've been Washed by the Water of the word they will not stand in the Judgment now listen there will be others who just had a bad attitude that's it but they'll be judged for it because they refus to stand under the water the washing of the water of the word I just want him to wash me I want him to take I just want him to take you take it out of my life the r said oh dear dying lamb thy Precious Blood shall never lose its power till all someone say all the ransom Church of God be saved to sin no more what is sin sin is unbelief unbelief in what the word un belief in God which is the word pure unadulterated oh Hallelujah leaving soon for the skies where are you standing church he said standing ready thank your garments Washed by the Water the bleeding word the word become blood the word bled for you you washed in bleeding word the word bleeding the life of God in the word and the Word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes and be cleaned and sanctified but the washing of the water of the word makes your mind and heart stay on God and on his word oh do you believe that this morning yes yes Abraham and lot had to separate they had to separate because of strife not so much between them as between their herdsmen Genesis 13:5 lot also which went with Abram had flocks and herds and Tents the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together there was a Strife between the Herdman of Abram's cattle and the Herdman of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite and the perizzite dwelling then in the land and what did you have you had two competing interests for the same resources right Lots herdsman's out here fighting with Abram's herdsman listen to me many times white people struggle in fully obeying God they have two competing interests in their life all right and one hasn't taken dominion over the other and because they're together they're not separate unbelief and Faith they actually both war in the mind and they get equal ground come on you give them equal time yeah and unbelief and Faith compete and there's Strife between unbelief and Faith right and what has to happen there has to come a separation Amen Let lot go his way let the unbelief go its way so your faith has room to grow and Abram said to lot let there be no Strife I pray between me and thee between my Herdman and thy Herdman for we be Brethren he said is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand I will go to the right if thou depart to the that's yeah that is right if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left but Abraham the man of God sir brother said gave lot his choice and took what was left oh I just love that a real believer will give you your choice he's willing to take what left there's no selfishness in a real believer not at all and lot looked around right the this what the flesh always wants by the way and beheld the plain of Jordan was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as th comest un zor wasn't the part of Egypt we visited verse 11 then lot shows him all the plain of Jordan Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves one from the other brother BR said lot like so many today seen the opportunity if he ever got away from that strictness why he might make himself a few dollars oh he said he might be a popular man so he looked down towards Sodom and it was a well-watered land a big city fine industry Sal and so forth you know what I don't know how the world's even appealing to people today did anybody watch the debate that's the leadership of the world brother Allan admitted it that was the leadership of the world I was like good grief what has happened to us but yet the world is still a pull because people look and see the well watered plane this it'd be so much easier if we were away from this strictness of the message way they feel and so they look at that well watered plane said they had to export from there and again it was full of Big Time women with all their Jezebel paint and everything just a great time his wife kind of felt a little that way too because he we find out after he become mayor down there she kind of like the way of the people that's the only thing you have to do is get mixed up with something God wants you to separate yourself get so far away from them things that you don't even see them at all all right if there's a spirit that's bothering you something that's causing you to act differently than you've acted before and act in ways that are against the word maybe that you're hanging out around the wrong people right and that's easy to fix for most of us God wants you to separate yourself get so far away from them till than them things so you don't even see them at all that you want to see one thing how many want to see one thing this morning one thing that's him what he promised yes Genesis 13:12 Abram dwelt in the land of Cana and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly brother brand said Abraham was a separated person from the world when God called Abraham at 75 years old separate yourself from your Kindred from all the unbelief come out into a world that you've never walked in before amongst some people you've never known before come out and separate yourself from anybody that would be contrary to what you're believing then would be a Nazarite to the Lord because he was holding a promise of his son he had to separate from his father his mother his Kindred what separated him not because he was a good man Church what separated him not because he was a good man but because he believed that God was able to keep the promise he'd give him why do we follow the message of the hour why do we live like we live brother Stewart not because we're better men but because we believe we believe in the promise God's given us we believe we're going to a rapture we believe so it's not a hard thing for us to live and act like Christians because we believe hallelujah hallelujah how many Believers we got here this morning oh I just love it we should we should just be sitting in Heavenly places with so many Believers I believe that you are listen only after unbelief was separated from him and he had fully obeyed God could Abraham then become a possessor of all things yeah Genesis 13:14 the Lord said to Abram after that lot was separated from him brother Bram emphasizes the after he said lift up now thine eyes look from the place where thou art northward and Southward Eastward Westward for all the land which thou seeth to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever if Abraham listen if Abraham had been in the valley with lot if he had went with him or if he' made that choice he would not have been able to see it might be harder to live up on the mountain but at least you can see Church lot is blind in the valley he can't see beyond the walls of his denomination he can't see beyond the walls of Sodom he can't see cuz he's in the valley but Abram's on the mountain Glory he's up up on if you see if you know the Topography of that land and how it's a great valley it's it's it's hundreds of miles it's great valley that goes down and here at the land of Israel's M mountainous and here it goes down on that side where modern day Jordan is goes down into the valley and lot chose the valley but Abraham if he had been in that Valley he could have never helped lot get out of it are you with me now he could have never helped him but because he was on the mountain he could see he said whatever you see that wouldn't have been much if he' had been in Sodom but what whatever you see you can have that's yours now look he had been Washed by the Water of the word now he could walk through his possession right we're going to finish this tonight I just it just means so much to me but I'll just say this Abraham said could possess that land because what was on it God gave it to him right oh and now we're getting it's getting good yeah it probably hard on Abraham to see lock go so his nephew and not just his nephew he'd helped raise him it was like his son and Abraham didn't have any children he had to separate from anything that he had to separate from anything that would approximate or try to distract him from the promise right if he put maybe all of his future in lot God said you got to separate from him but when he was on the mountain and he looked all around yeah he could see then right that's when you that's when you can help somebody when you're standing on the mountain of Grace when you're walking in the message of the hour and the light of the hour then he could see and he said he all that was in the land God give it to him and lot was a part of that land yes sir so Abraham had a right to it the only way he could really help lot is by separating from unbelief but now Abraham possessed all things even what yes all right Hallelujah as we close if the musicians would come this morning you cannot possess all things until you've been separated from unbelief by the washing of the Water by the word the Bible says the word of God is quick and Powerful means it's alive it's powerful it's sharper and any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit separating the joints and the marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart Abraham had to say Lord I believe what you told me I believe what you told me if it calls me to separation so be it Lord yes let me fully obey you yes let me be separated I'm not saying of people today so much as as being separated from thoughts that would exalt themselves against the mind of Christ let me be separated from every thought let me be separated from every deed let me be separated from every word that is not your word let me be separated from every thought that would exalt itself against the knowledge of Christ let me be a possessor of all things even my backsliding nephew are you with me now let me be a possessor of all things let me be a help to my community how can I do that by being a real Believer by standing on the mountain being able to see and you can be a help to the pennies be a help to the to the half dollars be a help to the silver dollars would you bow your head with me for a moment Heavenly Father Lord Jesus as we preached this morning and I I've just been crying this week for a a real Revival among us oh God lord I believe we're in the bride's Revival but Lord we we see es and flows oh God in our church and Lord we believe that we want Revival we want it to stay in Revival we we want you to move Lord Lord and and to do that we know there must be a separation from unbelief not from people Lord but from the unbelief that so easily besets us I pray God that that would be the case today I pray you'd move Lord we thank you for what you've already done my heart was encouraged this morning by by text and Lord and testimonies from people that said they've been praying Lord for the service and I know I know Lord that you were here you are here I pray you'd work
