[1:20:33] this bride with a lot of talent.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Now, and uh what a tremendous
[1:20:45] uh blessing it was to sit back there. We
[1:20:47] were we were sitting back in the office
[1:20:48] and and just the presence of the Lord
[1:20:51] was back there so strong and um uh I I
[1:20:56] told Brother Ben, I don't even want to
[1:20:57] sing. I don't I I'll just get up there
[1:20:59] and say a few words. Amen. But um uh we
[1:21:03] sure enjoyed that. We want to say it's

[1:21:27] all of the hospitality.

[1:21:32] the ministries that you bring in. And we

[1:21:37] you. This is a lot of work for a for a a
[1:21:40] congregation to put on,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; but we we uh we need it and we enjoy it.
[1:21:46] Amen. And we say God richly bless you.
[1:21:49] I'd like to look here in the book of
[1:21:50] Micah, the sixth chapter.
[1:21:54] And um so good to see all of our our uh
[1:21:58] ministry friends, minister friends here.

[1:22:07] uh appreciate just seeing all of our all
[1:22:11] of our uh my friends that I've had over
[1:22:14] the years and and uh it's just been a a
[1:22:17] tremendous blessing. So good to see
[1:22:19] them. And I also want to say that it's
[1:22:21] it's good to have a good showing from

[1:22:26] you Pawnians that that made the way over
[1:22:29] here and uh uh man just a just wonderful
[1:22:35] wonderful meeting. Let's look here at
[1:22:37] Micah uh 6 and um the sixth verse.
[1:22:42] Wherewithi shall I come before the Lord
[1:22:46] and bow myself before the high God?
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Shall I come before him with burnt
[1:22:52] offerings,
[1:22:54] with calves of a year old? Will the Lord
[1:22:58] be pleased with thousands of rams
[1:23:01] or with 10 thousands of rivers of oil?
[1:23:05] Shall I give my firstborn for my
[1:23:07] transgression?
[1:23:09] For the fruit or the fruit of my body,
[1:23:11] for the sin of my soul?
[1:23:14] Hath he thath thee? Hath he hath showed
[1:23:18] thee, oh man,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; what is good?
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; What do the Lord require of thee, but to
[1:23:26] do justly, to love mercy, and to walk
[1:23:30] humbly
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; with thy God?
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[1:23:35] Father, we want to thank you today for
[1:23:37] your love and the blessings that we have
[1:23:41] received even now. Lord,
[1:23:45] services last night was wonderful.
[1:23:49] Tonight's been glorious.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; But Lord, we're asking that you would
[1:23:54] open your words of life to us and that
[1:23:57] you would, Lord, that you would
[1:23:59] strengthen your people and that you
[1:24:00] would speak to us. Lord, take things out
[1:24:03] of our hearts that need to be taken out
[1:24:05] and add those things that should. Lord,
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Father, I ask that you would hide us all
[1:24:11] behind the cross.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That you would anoint your servant,
[1:24:15] Lord, to only say what you would want me
[1:24:17] to say. I ask for liberty, Lord, to be
[1:24:20] amongst us all. We give ourselves to you
[1:24:23] now. In Jesus name we pray. Can the
[1:24:27] church say amen?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You can be
[1:24:32] seated.
[1:24:34] I want to take a uh a thought out of
[1:24:37] this scripture here. Amen. What does the
[1:24:41] Lord require of me?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; that was the question that the
[1:24:46] worshipper was asking. What does the
[1:24:49] Lord require of me? I I want to come
[1:24:51] into his presence.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to bow down before the most
[1:24:56] high.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:24:58] What what would please the Lord?
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Shall I come with yearling calves and
[1:25:05] burnt offerings and thousands of rams or
[1:25:09] Amen 10,000
[1:25:11] rivers of oil?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; You You What can I do? Give me a list.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Because nothing is too great. You name
[1:25:21] it, I I will do it. Lord, I will do
[1:25:23] anything to prove my love to you. I I I
[1:25:27] I'll Amen. I I I I'll just whatever is
[1:25:30] required.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd climb the highest mountain to
[1:25:34] seek your approval. I
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I' I'd be a missionary in Africa
[1:25:39] if if if I knew that you would be
[1:25:42] pleased with me.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are and I and I and I want
[1:25:47] to say, Amen. It's not always in will
[1:25:50] worship. God's not looking for will
[1:25:53] worship. Right.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for, Amen. somebody
[1:25:58] that's got a lot to offer.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for a rich man who
[1:26:04] will, Amen. put a lot of money in the
[1:26:06] offering plate or
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; God's not looking for some super duper
[1:26:11] talent.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; God's not interested in we'll worship.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; God is interested in the worshipper.
[1:26:22] Can you say amen?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, there are many that show
[1:26:27] the great uh incredible acts of will
[1:26:30] worship there. Brother Brandham would
[1:26:33] talk about the the the ones the natives
[1:26:37] uh you know overseas that that would
[1:26:40] walk over the hot coals, hot bed of
[1:26:43] coals. They there there are many. I I've
[1:26:45] I've I've I've preached among the Native
[1:26:47] American uh um much in my ministry and
[1:26:51] and they've got scars in their in their
[1:26:54] heads and their chest and their Amen.
[1:26:56] from those who have done the Sundance
[1:26:58] and doing a lot of things to to try to
[1:27:01] earn the presence of God or to to to to
[1:27:05] come and and and to prove that uh
[1:27:08] they're sincere in their worship. It's
[1:27:11] something that they that they longed uh
[1:27:14] uh to to for the creator to know that
[1:27:17] they truly love him and they try to do
[1:27:20] it in one way or another. But see, God's
[1:27:22] not interested. Amen. And I, you know,
[1:27:25] I've been even in the Pentecostal realm.
[1:27:27] I was raised in a Amen. in the apostolic
[1:27:30] world to where Amen. The guys couldn't
[1:27:33] wear short sleeves and Amen. You you you
[1:27:37] didn't wear rings and hallelujah. You
[1:27:39] couldn't wear your hair in the middle. I
[1:27:41] don't know what I'm going to do now.
[1:27:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Uh there there were a
[1:27:46] lot of these things. Your skirt had to
[1:27:48] touch your ankles. There there was a lot
[1:27:50] of things that men have put together in
[1:27:54] order to try to appease God and to
[1:27:57] please God. And then we come up with
[1:27:59] man-made righteousness. We come up with
[1:28:02] man-made Amen. You know, and we can
[1:28:05] judge one another that way. Well, I'm
[1:28:07] more holy than you. I'm more. God loves
[1:28:10] me more. I love God more. But God's not
[1:28:13] interested in will worship.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; God's not interested, Amen. in somebody.
[1:28:18] He's looking for somebody who will give
[1:28:22] him their lives.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Mankind wants the status quo, a list of
[1:28:31] dos and don'ts to to to judge by. Can
[1:28:35] you say amen? But worship is more than
[1:28:38] lip service in a church.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Worship is not merely a rutistic a
[1:28:43] ritualistic form. Many times we have the
[1:28:46] attitude of this is what we do and this
[1:28:49] is how we do it and Lord this is what
[1:28:52] I'm giving you here tonight. And and and
[1:28:55] I wonder sometimes if we walk out of the
[1:28:58] service and we miss everything. We miss
[1:29:02] the presence of God. We leave the
[1:29:04] presence of God. Amen. Where his heart
[1:29:07] does not touch our hearts
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; is because we have added things and we
[1:29:11] have subtracted things and all God is
[1:29:14] truly interested in is all of you.
[1:29:19] [Applause]
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; You see, you can have all of the forms,
[1:29:25] you can have the rituals, you can have
[1:29:26] the quotes, you can have everything
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; and still be a formal powerless church
[1:29:33] member. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; And then the prophecy that was spoke of
[1:29:37] the first coming of Christ would come to
[1:29:39] pass in the bright coming of Christ.
[1:29:41] Amen. Where Jesus said, "This people
[1:29:43] drawth nigh unto me with their mouth and
[1:29:45] honorth me with their lips, but their
[1:29:47] heart is far from me."
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; I should have had brother Andrew preach
[1:29:53] again tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; God's looking for worshippers. That's
[1:30:01] right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says, "God wants a
[1:30:02] complete surrender."
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? God wants a
[1:30:06] surrender. How can God show you
[1:30:09] realities
[1:30:10] before you surrender yourself to him?
[1:30:13] You've got to surrender. Listen, you've
[1:30:17] got to surrender. Can you say amen?
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I don't think we should ever come to
[1:30:21] church with a critical spirit.
[1:30:25] I I don't think we should come to church
[1:30:27] with a Amen. with a a complacent
[1:30:30] attitude. I'm just coming to show up.
[1:30:33] I'm just coming to to to pay my dues.
[1:30:35] I'm just coming because this is what is
[1:30:37] required of me to do. Well, can you say
[1:30:40] amen? Often time we offer God poor
[1:30:43] praise. We come tired. Amen. We're not
[1:30:46] interested in the moving of the spirit
[1:30:49] because we are meeting a status quo and
[1:30:52] that's all that matters to us.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you there's some sons
[1:30:57] and daughters of God, amen, that is
[1:30:59] going to stand up to the occasion and
[1:31:02] say, "God, I want to be everything that
[1:31:04] you've ordained me to be. I want to be
[1:31:06] the bride that you've called me to be. I
[1:31:09] want to be the powerhouse that you've
[1:31:10] called me to be. If my name was put on
[1:31:13] that book, then let me manifest that
[1:31:15] book. Let me give everything I am to the
[1:31:19] cause of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; The Bible says God is among his sons and
[1:31:29] daughters. And yet we can fail to
[1:31:32] understand what God is doing today,
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; why he's revealing himself and
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; and where God is taking us and
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and the restoration. Why
[1:31:45] are we to be re uh restored back to
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; there? Psalms 82 and1.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; It says God standeth in the congregation
[1:31:53] of the mighty.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; He judges among the gods.
[1:31:58] How long will you judge unjustly?
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; And accept the person of the wicked.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Defend the poor and the fatherless. Do
[1:32:06] justice to the afflicted and needy.
[1:32:08] Deliver the poor and needy. And rid them
[1:32:11] out of the hand of the wicked. Yet they
[1:32:13] know not. Neither will they understand.
[1:32:16] They walk on in darkness. All the
[1:32:19] foundations of the earth are out of
[1:32:21] course.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; I have said you are gods,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; and all of you are children of the most
[1:32:26] high.
[1:32:27] But you die like men
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; and fly and fall like one of the
[1:32:31] princes.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Now, what am I getting to here tonight?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; I believe God is looking for surrendered
[1:32:40] hearts.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; He's looking for his uh uh his body that
[1:32:48] he can manifest his word to
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; and through. Now, Brother Brandham would
[1:32:53] tell us, he said, "Cain worshiped."
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "All of all of his carnal
[1:32:58] works,"
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; he said, "Just like the carnal church
[1:33:01] today,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; they go to church.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; They worship. Cain worshiped.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; He wasn't an infidel. He wasn't a
[1:33:08] communist. Cain was a believer.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; He went to God. He built an altar. He
[1:33:13] done everything religious that Abel
[1:33:15] done, but he didn't have the spiritual
[1:33:18] revelation of the will of God.
[1:33:21] Blessed be the name of the Lord. There
[1:33:22] you are. Do you see it? He didn't have
[1:33:25] the spiritual revelation. That's what's
[1:33:28] the matter with the church today. Jesus
[1:33:31] said he'd built his church on that
[1:33:35] spiritual revelation. He says, "Do you
[1:33:38] get it? Oh my, your eyes can come open
[1:33:40] now and see the spiritual revelation."
[1:33:43] Cain came and he built an altar. He
[1:33:47] worshiped. He brought sacrifice. He
[1:33:49] knelt down. He praised God. He worshiped
[1:33:52] God. But he done everything religious
[1:33:55] that Abel done. And God flatly refused
[1:33:58] him because he didn't have the spiritual
[1:34:01] revelation. Somebody say, "God, give me
[1:34:04] revelation." Follow the same line of
[1:34:06] Cain right down through the ark and
[1:34:09] through the ark unto Israel from Israel
[1:34:11] to Jesus from Jesus right now till today
[1:34:14] and see if that carnal fundamental stiff
[1:34:17] and starchy scholarly I I mean man who
[1:34:20] have the scriptures who knows all the
[1:34:23] doctrines and the theologies and they
[1:34:25] can explain it boy just like that but
[1:34:28] without the spiritual revelation. So if
[1:34:31] I am going to be accepted by God and my
[1:34:35] worship is going to be accepted by God
[1:34:38] then my worship must be according to
[1:34:41] divine revelation.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Well can you say amen? So
[1:34:50] it's not in my jumping and my shouting.
[1:34:52] It's not in my speaking in tongues. It's
[1:34:55] not in my prophecies. It's not in how
[1:34:57] good I can preach. How good I can sing.
[1:35:00] It's in my worship according to divine
[1:35:05] revelation.
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Someone say, "Thank God for
[1:35:12] revelation."
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You might not be rich, but if you've got
[1:35:17] revelation,
[1:35:20] are y'all hearing me here tonight? It's
[1:35:22] not who's who. It's the divine
[1:35:25] revelation within you.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Now, That's it.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Worship has much to do with your words.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an incredible honor to come
[1:35:36] before God.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an honor to express our love
[1:35:40] with words.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; It's it's an honor. Amen. To to sing an
[1:35:46] expression of our worship and our heart
[1:35:49] and we testify of his goodness. And I
[1:35:52] believe congregational praise is
[1:35:54] important.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; I do. Many membered bride, the body of
[1:35:57] Christ coming together. Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Some of you that's showing
[1:36:01] up for halfway through song service, you
[1:36:03] should be ashamed of yourself
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; because it's showing you, it's showing
[1:36:08] the people around you that you might not
[1:36:10] be worshiping according to revelation.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Those that are only amen showing up to
[1:36:17] church for your favorite preacher, it
[1:36:19] might be showing that your worship is
[1:36:22] not well praise the Lord. For those of
[1:36:26] you, Amen. that is trying to just follow
[1:36:28] the high class in the message or the the
[1:36:31] best preacher of the message. I want to
[1:36:33] tell you, you better get a revelation
[1:36:35] because God's got a body here on this
[1:36:38] earth that he's going to reflect himself
[1:36:40] through. He's going, "Come on, church.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; I want to be part of that body."
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and 31. Oh, that men would
[1:36:54] praise the Lord for his goodness and for
[1:36:57] his wondrous works to the children of
[1:36:59] men. Let them exalt him also in the
[1:37:02] congregation of the people and praise
[1:37:04] him in the assembly of the elders.
[1:37:06] Psalms 111 and 1. Praise ye the Lord. I
[1:37:09] will praise the Lord with my whole heart
[1:37:12] in the assembly of the upright and in
[1:37:14] the congregation. God believes in going
[1:37:17] to church,
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; but worship is not acceptable worship.
[1:37:25] All right.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Until it's revelated worship.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Because what God's looking for is
[1:37:36] somebody to understand his purpose, his
[1:37:40] will, his plan for this generation
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; so that he can live his works
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; through them.
[1:37:47] When Jesus said, "Search the scriptures
[1:37:49] for they declare who I am."
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; And they are they that that you're
[1:37:55] thinking that you've got eternal life
[1:37:57] by.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; You are worshiping something that you
[1:38:00] don't have a revelation of. And I just
[1:38:03] want this to really sink in deep because
[1:38:06] this bride, the only thing that
[1:38:08] separates you from another denomination
[1:38:11] is the spirit of God and divine
[1:38:15] revelation.
[1:38:17] Can you say
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; But you see the revelation of what God
[1:38:22] is doing in your hour.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; The heart.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a deep understanding of what
[1:38:28] God wants from his bride.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Did you know that the prophet said the
[1:38:32] bride will do nothing except God first
[1:38:36] shows her?
[1:38:38] She has found her place in him in such a
[1:38:42] way that everything about her and her
[1:38:46] attitude and her thought process is to
[1:38:50] honor
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; him.
[1:38:54] Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; When revelation truly strikes home of
[1:39:00] what God has redeemed you young men for,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; oh yeah,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; your worship changes.
[1:39:09] when when it really strikes home of what
[1:39:12] God's called us ministers for
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; our preaching changes
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; when it well come on church that we are
[1:39:20] in the final stretch
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; that the anointing is upon the body of
[1:39:27] believers and that we are fixing to go
[1:39:30] into a rapture into a body change. You
[1:39:34] know what that does? It takes the
[1:39:36] lackness away. It takes the insincerity
[1:39:39] away. And it brings about a reality of
[1:39:44] more of God.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Then praise takes on a different nature.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Praise.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Praise becomes an expression of
[1:40:01] Amen. Well, the musicians aren't there
[1:40:02] tonight, but God, here I am. Hallelujah.
[1:40:06] I love you. I thank Well, can you say
[1:40:08] amen? Amen. Your praise is no longer,
[1:40:11] well, I'm having a good day. It don't
[1:40:13] matter whether I'm having a good day or
[1:40:14] a bad day. I'm just honored. I'm part of
[1:40:19] the great plan of redemption. Amen.
[1:40:22] Well, I I my my lights have just been
[1:40:24] shut off. Oh, but I'm thankful
[1:40:29] that there is the almighty hand of God
[1:40:32] upon me and has separated me to himself.
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Praise becomes an expression of respect
[1:40:40] and gratitude,
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; an enthusiastic expression
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; of love
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; and admiration.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there is a revelation of
[1:40:53] God doing something right now. in you.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Turn to your neighbor and say, "God's
[1:40:58] doing something right now
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; in you."
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:06] [Applause]
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; When you get that kind of a revelation,
[1:41:10] the church body becomes extremely
[1:41:12] important to you.
[1:41:13] [Applause]
[1:41:15] When you get that kind of a revelation
[1:41:17] that I belong to the to to the earthly
[1:41:20] body of Jesus Christ,
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; then I understand that I cannot do it
[1:41:24] without you and you cannot do it without
[1:41:27] him and he can't do it without you. And
[1:41:30] maybe you guys don't even Hallelujah.
[1:41:32] can't even stay in the same room
[1:41:33] together. But there is a reality there
[1:41:36] saying I need you.
[1:41:42] Amen.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Well, the church conflict is all over
[1:41:45] then because now there's a revelation. I
[1:41:47] belong to the literal body. Amen. The
[1:41:49] the the the the earthly body of the Lord
[1:41:52] Jesus Christ. But come on, church. Amen.
[1:41:56] If we had that kind of a revelation,
[1:41:57] amen, there wouldn't be all of this
[1:41:59] nonsense that goes on and all the
[1:42:01] fussing and the fighting and the
[1:42:02] feuding. Amen. And the sarcasm. There'd
[1:42:04] be a reality that I belong to something
[1:42:07] greater than me. I am part of a body
[1:42:10] that is greater than me. I am a member
[1:42:12] of the supernatural body bride of Jesus
[1:42:16] Christ. The realities of God are in me
[1:42:21] expressing through me to my brother. Can
[1:42:24] you say amenise?
[1:42:27] [Applause]
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. When you catch the revelation
[1:42:33] of the will of God today
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; that you belong to that body.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; You'll know.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; You'll know
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; that your brother's important.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Is this okay here tonight?
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; It's no wonder that Jesus said, "Upon
[1:42:49] this rock, I'll build my church."
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; What was that rock?
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; The revelation
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; of who he is.
[1:42:59] If Jesus were to quote that today, upon
[1:43:02] this rock, will I build my church? It
[1:43:06] would have to be the revelation of who
[1:43:09] the bridebody of Christ would be.
[1:43:13] [Applause]
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; When we look at the desperation,
[1:43:23] we look at the call, we look at the
[1:43:25] responsibility upon the shoulders of the
[1:43:28] bride of Jesus Christ,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; man, it should throw us into desperation
[1:43:34] because there is a loan of
[1:43:36] responsibility.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; that is upon your shoulders.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're old or
[1:43:43] whether you're young.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether you're a pastor, an
[1:43:46] evangelist.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whether you're uh uh whether you
[1:43:50] are running the sound,
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; whether you're a musician.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. It doesn't matter what you are.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; I'm wanting you to feel the load of the
[1:44:02] responsibility tonight.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Because this all rests upon the
[1:44:06] shoulders
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; of his earthly body.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus responsibility.
[1:44:13] It was Jesus responsibility to surrender
[1:44:16] his will to God.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus responsibility to say not
[1:44:22] my will but thy will be done.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; My meat is to do the will of him that
[1:44:28] sent me.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he come to earth for a
[1:44:34] purpose. The father's purpose.
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. No wonder Jesus got along really
[1:44:44] well with the father.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he was the father."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that he had to
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; He had to die to his flesh every day.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham. Hallelujah. Josh sent
[1:45:02] me a quote and I almost used it, but I
[1:45:03] thought, well, you probably going to
[1:45:04] preach that here in a minute or later
[1:45:06] on. But Amen. I It was a It was a
[1:45:09] powerful quote. Amen. where brother
[1:45:10] Brandham is talking about Jesus had to
[1:45:13] die to the will of the father
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; and so does he. So do you.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham would say in
[1:45:20] ashamed he says his word has to live
[1:45:23] itself out for every generation in
[1:45:26] desperations. Brother Brandham would say
[1:45:28] amen. See it working and showing that
[1:45:30] it's not a man it's not just a preacher.
[1:45:33] It's not a certain congregation. It's
[1:45:35] the Holy Spirit showing the same thing
[1:45:37] it did when it was embodied in the body
[1:45:40] of Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied in
[1:45:43] the body of his bride. And that should
[1:45:47] throw us into desperation.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; I'm here with a purpose.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; I'm responsible.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; For this message,
[1:46:04] And we can shout around the message all
[1:46:06] we want
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; and we can say amen and do little twirls
[1:46:09] on every service.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; But if we ain't got the revelation and
[1:46:13] it's not sinking into you and you're not
[1:46:15] finding yourself harnessed up to that
[1:46:17] word,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; your worship's in vain.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Good job, brother Windle. Keep it up.
[1:46:28] Thank you.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Think I will.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Doing all right.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You surrender yourself to
[1:46:34] that word.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; The word living
[1:46:38] in action.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible bride.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Not some man-made bride.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible bride.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Smitten and afflicted of God.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; No beauty that we should desire her. But
[1:46:52] we But yet we did esteem her. Smitten
[1:46:55] and afflicted of God. That's right. She
[1:46:57] stands alone. She is smitten from all
[1:47:00] the denominations according to
[1:47:01] Revelations 3. She is smitten out of the
[1:47:03] Leoysian church age. She was raised up
[1:47:06] in see. Amen. The church was raised up
[1:47:09] in the Leosian age. That's the husk.
[1:47:12] Amen. It goes on. She stands alone like
[1:47:15] the bridegroom rejected of man and
[1:47:19] despised and rejected of the churches.
[1:47:22] The bride stands that way. What is it?
[1:47:24] It is his masterpiece. It's the word
[1:47:28] that he can work through.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; It's the word that he Oh, come on,
[1:47:35] church. You are that predestinated word
[1:47:39] for this day. And you're the word that
[1:47:42] he can work through and manifest himself
[1:47:47] through.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Good preach. Owning up to our
[1:47:57] responsibilities
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; is acknowledging and accepting
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; the consequences. Responsibility is to
[1:48:04] owning up to it is to literally means to
[1:48:08] acknowledge and accept the consequences
[1:48:10] of our actions.
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Both the positive and the negative.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; Rather than shifting the blame
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; to somebody else.
[1:48:21] But to look in the mirror and say, "Hey,
[1:48:22] Bubba,
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; you're just stupid."
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; And you need to surrender your will to
[1:48:28] God.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And don't be telling your neighbor
[1:48:30] they're stupid. I say, "Look in the
[1:48:32] mirror." Hallelujah.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Shifting the blame is I
[1:48:37] could be a better Christian if my wife.
[1:48:39] I could be a better Christian if my
[1:48:41] husband. I could be a better Christian
[1:48:42] if my pastor. I could do a whole lot
[1:48:45] better. Well, I want to tell you, Eve
[1:48:47] was doing pretty good when she fell.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; But the the prophet said, "The bride
[1:49:00] will not fail in this day."
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she's been given a word and
[1:49:06] she's got a sense of responsibility
[1:49:08] about her. She's not taking this message
[1:49:11] and just playing with it. She's taking
[1:49:13] this message and she's coming under the
[1:49:16] headship of that word and she's saying,
[1:49:18] "God, be it unto me according to thy
[1:49:21] word." Come on, church. Be it unto me.
[1:49:24] And I think before God can ever use us,
[1:49:27] we're going to have to surrender our
[1:49:28] wills. We're going to have to surrender
[1:49:30] our sins. We're going to have to
[1:49:32] surrender the big eyes and the little
[1:49:34] U's. We're going to have to surrender it
[1:49:36] all. lay it on the altar and say, "God,
[1:49:39] whatever you've called me for, I want
[1:49:41] you to anoint me. I want you to forgive
[1:49:43] me. I want you to take me to Calvary and
[1:49:46] wash me from my selfish ways. Wash me
[1:49:50] from my egotistic spirit. Wash me from
[1:49:54] my pride."
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. owning up to our responsibilities.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the prophet said.
[1:50:10] We've got to own up to our
[1:50:11] responsibilities.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; He says it's where Amen. It's about
[1:50:15] taking personal accountability for our
[1:50:16] choices.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; And then we're accountable for the
[1:50:21] outcomes.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; It ain't the preacher's fault that your
[1:50:30] kids are backslid.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; It ain't the guy. Amen. In the
[1:50:40] schoolyard that's responsible.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; They're my sons.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; They're your daughters.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; How you raise them in your home.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; Well, y'all got real quiet there. Maybe
[1:50:52] we ought to preach here for a little
[1:50:54] bit.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; It does matter what you allow in your
[1:50:56] home.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; It does matter that your children sees
[1:50:59] you going to church. It does matter,
[1:51:01] Amen, that you pay your tithe. It does
[1:51:04] matter that you walk with God. It does
[1:51:06] matter that your children seize your
[1:51:09] faithfulness in the house of God. It
[1:51:11] does matter for us preachers, amen, to
[1:51:13] be humble before the name of the Lord
[1:51:16] and to show the realities of his wired
[1:51:19] in humility before the congregation.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; It's important.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; There is a responsibility.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; If the word of God says
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; that the love of many would wax cold
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; and the prophet's interpretation of that
[1:51:42] scripture that there would not be any
[1:51:44] love found anywhere in the world except
[1:51:47] for in the bride.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty heavy weight of
[1:51:54] responsibility.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; Responsibility refers to the obligation
[1:52:00] to do something. The accountability is
[1:52:02] the estate of being answerable for those
[1:52:04] results.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham says, "And when you see
[1:52:08] this in this day now when the word of
[1:52:11] God has been has made these promises of
[1:52:13] things that we see happening now, now
[1:52:16] then we've got to take the
[1:52:18] responsibility
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; to either face up to it or get away from
[1:52:21] it.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; You just can't stay neutral.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You've got to do something about it.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Some move has got to be made. You can't
[1:52:30] come in that church door and go out the
[1:52:32] same person you came in. You're either
[1:52:35] further away or closer to God every time
[1:52:38] you come in or go out.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, how easy it is for people to sherk
[1:52:45] these things. He says,
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is the requirement?
[1:52:51] Amen. I don't want your things. I want
[1:52:53] you. When I have you, then you'll gladly
[1:52:57] give in the re through the revelation of
[1:53:00] why you're giving.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Prophet says you can, God can only use
[1:53:06] what we give him,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; what we give to him.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Now, there is a lot of you will say, I
[1:53:12] give 15 minutes on Sunday morning. If
[1:53:14] you preach any longer than that, I'll
[1:53:16] just get up and go home.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well,
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; most of you stayed. Hallelujah. That's
[1:53:21] good. Amen.
[1:53:23] Hallelujah.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Well, he says that's that's what that's
[1:53:27] what you give to God. Amen. Some of them
[1:53:29] said, "Well, maybe I can suffer a half
[1:53:32] hour. I I don't know how how I can do
[1:53:34] it." Well, see, then then that's what
[1:53:36] you get. 15 minutes, a half hour. What
[1:53:39] What can you give? The prophet is
[1:53:41] asking, "What can you give?" God will
[1:53:44] receive what you'll give him. But God
[1:53:47] wants all of you.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; He wants every bit of you. He wants all.
[1:53:52] He wants everything you are. He wants
[1:53:55] your life. He wants your testimony. He
[1:53:57] wants every minute you live. He wants to
[1:54:00] live right, act right, talk right, do
[1:54:03] right. He wants everything perfectly
[1:54:05] surrendered to him that he can lead you
[1:54:08] and guide you and put you in places he
[1:54:13] wants you to go.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Led
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; of the spirit.
[1:54:20] I'm the body.
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; I'm the body. There's a revelation that
[1:54:24] is striking my heart
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; that I am his body.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; He says, "You take yours first and go
[1:54:36] out and spend and have your big times."
[1:54:38] And
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; when you go to church on Sunday morning,
[1:54:40] you give him a quarter. Come
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; on now.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; But you go and buy a $50 present to give
[1:54:45] the Joneses that lives next door to you
[1:54:47] or something. Amen.
[1:54:50] Enough to get up in your society ranks
[1:54:52] and then give Jesus the last.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; There's a bunch of these kind of quotes.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; The unwelcome Christ. He said he's
[1:55:02] worthy of the best. What do you do for
[1:55:04] him?
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; You give him the leftover.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; You said, "Brother Wendle, now now
[1:55:08] listen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; I like last night's preaching because it
[1:55:11] was revelated."
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Better say amen about my preaching
[1:55:16] tonight, too, though.
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:24] Hey, you you see you see what I'm
[1:55:27] saying? But but but now now this here's
[1:55:28] just getting to meddling. In order to
[1:55:30] come into the glorious relationship, in
[1:55:34] order for the bride to be what God has
[1:55:36] called this bride to be, then there's
[1:55:38] got to be some house cleaning.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; There's got to be some attitude
[1:55:42] cleaning. There's got to be some some
[1:55:44] real looking. Well, I tell you what,
[1:55:46] there's going to have to be some phone
[1:55:48] cleaning, some computer cleaning.
[1:55:50] There's going to be Come on, church. The
[1:55:53] things you allow, the things that you
[1:55:55] put in front of God.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; And yet, God's called you to be his
[1:56:01] earthly body.
[1:56:02] [Applause]
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Says he's worthy of your best.
[1:56:15] What do you give him? The leftover.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; You run around all day and just give him
[1:56:21] three minutes at night before you go to
[1:56:22] bed.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; In bed,
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; whispering a three-minute prayer.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Keep my boys, keep my girls, keep my
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; And you look at your clock and that's
[1:56:34] only been 30 seconds.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Revelation
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; of the realities.
[1:56:42] He says, "Oh yes, you run around all day
[1:56:44] and give him the three minutes at night
[1:56:45] before you go to bed.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Jesus deserves your best, friend.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; He deserves everything you got.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; But what do you do about it?
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; You give him just anything." And he
[1:56:55] takes it. He takes it anyhow.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; He takes it.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; But you know what? He deserves the first
[1:57:02] place.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus ought to have the first place in
[1:57:06] every life.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; But we give him about the fourth place.
[1:57:09] He deserves the first. Well, you say, "I
[1:57:11] pray once a day." Well, that's all
[1:57:13] right. He receives it. If you want to
[1:57:15] give him fourth place, that's all right.
[1:57:17] He'll take it. You only went to church
[1:57:19] once this year, maybe, and wore the new
[1:57:21] hat and everything. But he never condemn
[1:57:23] you for it. That's what makes him God to
[1:57:26] me. If you want to give him fourth
[1:57:28] place, fifth place, he will take it. He
[1:57:30] will take anything you give him. But he
[1:57:33] ought to have the first place.
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:42] Yes, sir.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Exactly right, brother.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That feminist spirit
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; will keep a woman from appreciating the
[1:57:55] true marriage covenant
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; and what that woman was created for.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Is the mic on? Did y'all hear that?
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; That feminine spirit
[1:58:09] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; But God created the woman
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; to be the help meetat
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; to the man.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Her calling, her purpose, her
[1:58:25] fulfillment comes in giving unto her
[1:58:29] man. And as her man succeeds, she
[1:58:33] succeeds.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, y'all didn't know that. Come on.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Well, y'all ever listen to any of the
[1:58:40] messages.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; How many's ever read in the Bible in in
[1:58:47] First Corinthians? He makes it very
[1:58:49] clear. The woman, the man was not made
[1:58:52] for the woman, but the woman was made
[1:58:57] for the man.
[1:58:59] [Applause]
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. and what you do
[1:59:06] at home and what you're what Hallelujah.
[1:59:08] Glory. Y'all start smiling at me.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; But that same spirit that comes into
[1:59:14] them
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; and you start treating your husband,
[1:59:17] Jesus Christ, the word,
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; as though he don't matter.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; You start treating Jesus Christ, the
[1:59:25] word, as if he's he's just second place.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; He'll take it.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; He'll take it. But he ain't going to
[1:59:35] share his glory with you.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; You can be a wannabe and a halfway all
[1:59:42] you want to, but God does not make
[1:59:45] halfway preachers. He does not make
[1:59:48] halfway Christians. He makes full.
[1:59:53] He's ordained you to be a believer.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; What does the Lord require of me in
[2:00:05] these days when the mysteries have been
[2:00:07] unveiled, the symbols interpreted, the
[2:00:10] open book, Amen, available to the sons
[2:00:13] of God. Surely there's some
[2:00:15] responsibilities that are coming with
[2:00:16] it. The opening of the seals is not the
[2:00:18] new form of legalism. The opening of the
[2:00:21] seals is not a certain code of conduct.
[2:00:23] The opening of the seals is a bedroom
[2:00:27] relationship
[2:00:28] between you and Jesus Christ.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Oh man.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham talking about in
[2:00:49] the choosing of the bride 65. He talks
[2:00:52] about the two churches. One of them is a
[2:00:53] denominational birth.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; It's going to going to be given one one
[2:00:58] day to to the one these days at the
[2:01:02] World Council of Churches which will
[2:01:04] produce the the world to the world the
[2:01:06] antichrist through denomination. And
[2:01:08] that's exactly the truth. I may not
[2:01:09] leave to see it. I believe I will. But
[2:01:11] you young people remember you heard a
[2:01:13] minister say that that finally that'll
[2:01:16] finally wind up. That is the mark of the
[2:01:18] beast when she forms the World Council
[2:01:20] of Churches. She'll give birth to her
[2:01:22] son, the Antichrist. But the other is
[2:01:24] impregnated, too.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; There's a surrendered woman who is
[2:01:31] impregnated, too. Well, y'all ought to
[2:01:33] be shouting right now.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; There is a woman on earth, the bride of
[2:01:38] Jesus Christ, that he wants to
[2:01:40] impregnate with his word. Can you say
[2:01:43] amen?
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. All right.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; She's impregnated by the word of God.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; And it will bring forth the body, the
[2:01:51] finished body of Jesus Christ, which is
[2:01:53] the bride. The body of Christ alone
[2:01:55] isn't isn't finished yet. Amen. Uh how
[2:01:58] how many how many knows that a man and
[2:02:01] woman is one. Christ is one body. The
[2:02:03] word the bride will have to be the rest
[2:02:06] of that body. And you and the two
[2:02:08] together makes one body again like Adam
[2:02:11] was at the beginning. Man, his wife are
[2:02:14] one. Amen. Now she, the true bride, is
[2:02:17] so sold out to him. Someone shout,
[2:02:20] "Yes."
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; The true bride is so sold out to him
[2:02:26] that she uses no mind of her own. His
[2:02:29] mind, of course, it's his will and his
[2:02:31] will is his word.
[2:02:34] Yes, sir.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; So, what is divine worship?
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Come on now. All right.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; What is divine worship?
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; It's praise with a meaning.
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's life
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; with a meaning.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; It's going to work
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; with a meaning.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; It's serving your husbands
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; with a meaning.
[2:03:06] Everything about you, you are the very
[2:03:09] bride body of Jesus Christ. He's
[2:03:12] impregnating you with this. What are we
[2:03:15] looking to? The coming Oh, God. Amen.
[2:03:18] The bride body is going to produce the
[2:03:21] very word Jesus Christ himself.
[2:03:25] [Applause]
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Exactly right.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; divine worship would have to know we
[2:03:33] know where he is.
[2:03:35] We understand the purpose of his word
[2:03:37] and we know our placing. Can you say
[2:03:39] amen?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; The prophet would put it this way,
[2:03:43] brother. If you ever amount to anything,
[2:03:44] you got to love God better than your
[2:03:46] wife, your husband, your children, your
[2:03:48] pastor.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; You everything there is.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; You've got to love God first.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; God gets first place.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; So, as we stand here today, Amen.
[2:04:01] There's a lot of there's a lot of
[2:04:03] sometimes questions around well do we
[2:04:06] believe in tongues or do we believe in
[2:04:08] prophecies and do we believe in I just
[2:04:10] believe in the bride falling in love
[2:04:11] with Jesus.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; I believe in Jesus having the perfect
[2:04:15] way in his church.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; And if Jesus wants to speak in tongues,
[2:04:18] we'll let him. If Jesus wants to
[2:04:20] prophesy, we'll let him. If Jesus wants
[2:04:23] to do those things, we'll let him. But
[2:04:25] there's one thing that I have found.
[2:04:27] Amen. I left a long time in Pentecost.
[2:04:29] Amen. I am not following after signs
[2:04:31] that Amen. that come and fall. Come and
[2:04:34] fall. Amen. There's one desire I have
[2:04:36] and that's for the Lord Jesus Christ to
[2:04:38] be satisfied with me. I want God to be
[2:04:41] satisfied with my life. I want to live a
[2:04:43] humble life that God can call me and
[2:04:45] anoint me and oh, come on, church. Amen.
[2:04:49] Death throw everything else aside and
[2:04:51] say, "God, I just want to fall in love."
[2:04:53] Is that not what the prophet said? He
[2:04:55] says it'll do better than all the gifts
[2:04:57] you ever had. divine love.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Can I have a few more minutes?
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 58
[2:05:11] and two.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; He says, "Yet they seek me daily and
[2:05:15] delight to know my ways. As a nation
[2:05:17] they did righteous and forsook the not
[2:05:21] the ordinance of their God. They asked
[2:05:23] me the ordinance asked of me the
[2:05:25] ordinances of justice and they take
[2:05:27] delight in approaching God. Wherefore
[2:05:29] have we fasted, say they, and thou
[2:05:31] seeest not.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Wherefore have we afflicted our soul,
[2:05:35] thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the
[2:05:38] day of your fast, you find pleasure, and
[2:05:39] exact all your labors.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; Behold, you fast for strife and debate,
[2:05:43] and smite with a fist of wickedness, and
[2:05:46] you shall not fast as you do this day to
[2:05:48] make your voice be heard on high. Oh my.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Is it such a fast that I've chosen?
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; A day for a man to afflict his soul? Is
[2:05:55] it to bow down his head as a bull rush
[2:05:57] to spin sadcloth and ashes under him?
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Will thou call this a fast an acceptable
[2:06:02] day of the Lord? Is not this the fast
[2:06:05] that I have chosen?
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; To loose the bands of wickedness,
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; to undo the heavy burdens.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; To let the oppressed go free
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; and to break every yoke. Come on.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; I Isn't that what God is looking for? Is
[2:06:22] a body that he can work through.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; A body that he can
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the heartbeat of God.
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the heartbeat of God. You look
[2:06:37] at Jesus and you can see the very
[2:06:39] pulsation of divine grace and divine
[2:06:42] love.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; We're the heartbeat of Christ.
[2:06:47] We're the feminine sight of Jesus
[2:06:50] Christ.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Our love, our desire is to serve him,
[2:06:56] honor him, feed him, praise him.
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; We are his helpmates.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; We are his Oh, come on, church. Help me
[2:07:08] preach. I I I hope I'm doing all right
[2:07:10] here tonight. Amen. God, get us back to
[2:07:13] that point where our hearts are soft and
[2:07:17] humble and pure before God.
[2:07:20] [Applause]
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Question and answers.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Is the bride of Christ and the body of
[2:07:36] Christ the same? Yes, sir.
[2:07:39] When God gave Adam his bride from his
[2:07:41] side,
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; he said, "She is flesh of my flesh and
[2:07:43] bone of my bone."
[2:07:45] &gt;&gt; Is that right? When God gave Christ his
[2:07:47] bride,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; the spirit gave the flesh, the bride
[2:07:51] and pierced his side under his heart,
[2:07:54] water, blood, and spirit come forth
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; that become the flesh of his flesh,
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; the bone of his bone. We are the flesh
[2:08:01] and bones. The bride will be the flesh
[2:08:05] and bones of Christ.
[2:08:08] Flesh,
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; brother Sam. The flesh
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; and bones
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; of that living eternal spirit
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; walking in school.
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; Flesh and bones.
[2:08:20] Flesh and bones. Like like Amen. those
[2:08:24] disciples Peter and John. Amen. They
[2:08:26] they look at the crippled man. Everyone
[2:08:28] else had passed by. But here comes
[2:08:30] something. Amen. Within and they stopped
[2:08:33] and they said, "Silver and gold have we
[2:08:35] none, but such as we do have.
[2:08:39] Come on.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; It was the continuation.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; It was the continuation. What can you
[2:08:44] say? Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the church will
[2:08:47] come through justification Luther
[2:08:49] sanctification through Wesley baptism of
[2:08:52] the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and
[2:08:54] go right on into the perfection of the
[2:08:56] son of man when the husband and the wife
[2:08:58] will be the selfsame person. God will be
[2:09:02] so manifested in his bride, his church,
[2:09:05] till they will both be the same. Someone
[2:09:08] shout hallelujah.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A surrendered life. There is
[2:09:13] a responsibility. As my as a husband,
[2:09:16] I've got a responsibility. My wife has a
[2:09:19] responsibility. Amen. As the bride of
[2:09:22] Jesus Christ, I have a responsibility.
[2:09:27] I'm stepping up to my responsibility and
[2:09:29] I'm saying, Lord, I want to be
[2:09:32] everything
[2:09:33] that you want me to be.
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; So they asked, "Will the bride have a
[2:09:45] ministry?"
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; The bride will have a ministry.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:09:53] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; That's what is taking place.
[2:09:57] through the five-fold ministry.
[2:10:00] [Applause]
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; Is that not a quote?
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Truth, brother.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; You know what my desire is? Is Lord, I'm
[2:10:16] going to yield myself to you.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; according to your word.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; I don't have to have the biggest
[2:10:24] churches. I don't have to have the best
[2:10:25] of talents. I don't have to have Lord,
[2:10:28] if you just give me a revelation of who
[2:10:29] you are so that I can properly serve you
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; because I have found there's been too
[2:10:35] many people with gifts and callings.
[2:10:36] There's been too many people, Amen. And
[2:10:38] all it's done is made them hot shots.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; And then hot shots can't really do too
[2:10:42] much for the Lord. They're building
[2:10:43] kingdoms for themselves. They're doing
[2:10:45] this. They're doing that. Amen. Well,
[2:10:46] praise the Lord. And we now we can all
[2:10:49] get there, can't we? God's not
[2:10:51] interested in what you can bring to the
[2:10:53] table. He's interested in a body that he
[2:10:57] can impregnate by his spirit.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; it would have to be
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; because a woman and her husband become
[2:11:15] one.
[2:11:16] &gt;&gt; They become one and so does the bride in
[2:11:19] Christ become one. The ministry of the
[2:11:21] bride and the ministry of Christ is the
[2:11:23] same.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Remember these former treaties, O
[2:11:26] Theophilles, have I wrote to you that
[2:11:29] Jesus be to do and continues to do. His
[2:11:32] death didn't stop him.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; he returned again. Not a third person,
[2:11:37] but the same person returned again in
[2:11:39] the form of the Holy Spirit to continue
[2:11:41] his work on and continues on, says the
[2:11:44] book of Acts.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; What's required of this bride
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; in the last days?
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Am I doing all right?
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; What's required of this bride?
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; This humble bride.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; This bride that God finds no fault in.
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; This bride that is just as perfect as
[2:12:12] Jesus Christ.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; This bride that he has created. He
[2:12:18] created his own bride.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; What would you boys do if y'all could
[2:12:23] create your own bride?
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; But you can
[2:12:29] Jesus created his own bride.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; And everything about her is lovely.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; His righteousness is her righteousness.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; His divine character is her divine
[2:12:44] character. Amen.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; All he wants
[2:12:48] is for her to look back at him
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; and not follow the serpent.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Not go whoring after other things like
[2:12:59] the Hallelujah.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; But to fall in love with this one who
[2:13:07] created her.
[2:13:09] [Applause]
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:13:14] Hallelujah.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; Question and answer 64.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, "Who is your
[2:13:20] little queen in the home? She ministers
[2:13:23] food to you." Is that right?
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now the bride ministers Christ
[2:13:31] the word."
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; Man should not live by bread alone, but
[2:13:34] by every word. Right.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; She ministers the word to the king,
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; manifesting his promised word in the age
[2:13:44] that she's living in.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; We are feeding Christ
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; his word.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; By manifesting
[2:14:00] &gt;&gt; the word in our age.
[2:14:04] How do I feed Christ?
[2:14:07] Man, if I'm feeding him by taking his
[2:14:11] word and making it my word.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Taking his desires and making it my
[2:14:17] command.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; I am feeding Christ his very own word.
[2:14:28] That's his favorite supper.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; He loves it. Amen.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say amen?
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Now, watch this. He She ministers the
[2:14:39] word to the king
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; by manifesting his promised word in the
[2:14:43] age he's living in.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said something then you didn't
[2:14:46] get it. Amen. Notice. Oh my. That was a
[2:14:48] good one. Ministering in the age the
[2:14:52] word.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:15:00] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense here tonight?
[2:15:02] Absolutely
[2:15:04] sir.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; They asked brother Brandham they said so
[2:15:08] so they they said so will everyone cast
[2:15:11] out devils raise the dead will everyone
[2:15:15] fulfill he said you have said that that
[2:15:17] that this has got to happen.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:21] and and he says, "Will every true
[2:15:23] believer do the works that Jesus said?"
[2:15:26] And in in John 14, uh he says, "The heal
[2:15:30] the sick, cast out devils, raise the
[2:15:32] dead." Uh he said, "I don't think that's
[2:15:35] in John 14, but all right, it's in
[2:15:37] Mark." But is or is this only to be
[2:15:39] Elijah? Must the believer do all this?
[2:15:42] Do do we really that really believe? If
[2:15:45] he really is a real believer, will he
[2:15:47] raise the dead and do great miracles?
[2:15:50] on
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; brother was fixing to answer the
[2:15:56] question.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now they're asking now is
[2:16:00] this just for you
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; or is this required of us all?
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in my name they'll cast
[2:16:07] out devils.
[2:16:10] &gt;&gt; And if you don't have a revelation
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; of who you are and what the bride body
[2:16:15] is, you'll miss it.
[2:16:23] Watch this.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now it that is among the
[2:16:27] believers."
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Every man doesn't have those gifts.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; And don't mean that just one person will
[2:16:33] do it.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; There will be groups of people. Like for
[2:16:37] instance, if we had a little girl in the
[2:16:39] church or a little boy, somebody that we
[2:16:41] love real well, and life would go out of
[2:16:43] them, the whole church would get
[2:16:46] together and they'd go to fasting and
[2:16:49] praying.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; That is a
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; That is the bride body feeding Christ
[2:16:58] his word.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; The whole church would get together and
[2:17:03] go to praying and fasting. Lord have
[2:17:05] mercy on that child. God could raise it
[2:17:06] up. How many ever read the nin fathers
[2:17:09] and them, you know, that's the way they
[2:17:11] done it in the early church. They'd all
[2:17:13] get together, you know, and and and even
[2:17:15] raise up their pastor sometime and the
[2:17:17] different ones if God seen fit to do it,
[2:17:19] but they done it. So, brother Brandham
[2:17:22] is saying it's not that this one's going
[2:17:23] to do it and that it's going to be a
[2:17:25] bride body. Oh, church of the living
[2:17:28] God. Amen. If we could just understand
[2:17:30] that all of us peeons matter. We all
[2:17:33] matter. You matter. You young men
[2:17:35] matter. You young ladies matter. You
[2:17:37] elders matter. We all fit into the body
[2:17:40] of Jesus Christ. And we have that
[2:17:42] responsibility.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; One more quote and then I'm going to I'm
[2:17:52] going to Amen. Start settling down here.
[2:17:56] Amen.
[2:17:58] He said the church is so carnal it feeds
[2:17:59] itself on worldly cra and
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; get things of the world just like the
[2:18:03] vultures church politics. They don't let
[2:18:06] the Holy Ghost send a man to the church.
[2:18:08] They they have to have politics and the
[2:18:10] denominations is going to receive him or
[2:18:12] not. Amen. They they're like the world.
[2:18:14] They dress like the world. They look
[2:18:15] like the world. They act like the world.
[2:18:17] They're vultures. They like the world.
[2:18:19] They're they're lazy and they're soft
[2:18:21] and they're compromisers. Brother, I
[2:18:23] don't want to be that.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's all there is to it. He says, "But
[2:18:27] did you ever see an eagle compromise?"
[2:18:29] No, sir. There's no compromising in him.
[2:18:32] Neither does a genuine Christian. He
[2:18:34] ain't soft. He'll go hunt his food until
[2:18:37] he finds it. Amen. Yes, sir. He'll find
[2:18:40] his meat. He wants fresh mana. He'll get
[2:18:42] down there and dig until he finds it.
[2:18:44] He'll fly higher and higher. The higher
[2:18:47] you go, the more you can see. So, it's
[2:18:49] time for the eagles of this day to get
[2:18:51] to flying higher and dig into God's
[2:18:53] promises and not live on vulture food
[2:18:56] that's been killed years ago. Get out of
[2:18:59] it politics and voting in and voting out
[2:19:02] and saying this, that, and the other.
[2:19:04] Holy Spirit has no more ride away in the
[2:19:06] church than other. There's no more
[2:19:08] prayer meetings. There's no more
[2:19:10] agonizing with God to fulfill his word.
[2:19:12] There's no more believing that the word
[2:19:14] is still the same yesterday, today, and
[2:19:16] forever. But there is a bride.
[2:19:21] Yes, sir.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; There's a bride that says, "My man can
[2:19:28] do it."
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Good preacher.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; I love it when my wife brags on me.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; I like it when she does it in front of
[2:19:53] me, but I also like it when she's doing
[2:19:54] it and she don't know I'm there.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; She's always saying, "Well, I tell you
[2:19:57] what, Wendle just really she says things
[2:19:59] that she don't tell me.
[2:20:04] I'm going
[2:20:06] [Laughter]
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; I'm thinking I'm going to go put some
[2:20:13] after shave on. Oh,
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; She bragging on it.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:20:28] There ain't no one there ain't there
[2:20:30] ain't there there ain't no one could be
[2:20:31] tore down like a man from his wife by
[2:20:33] his wife
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; and there ain't no one that can be built
[2:20:36] up
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; like a man's wife
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; says I find no fault
[2:20:48] [Applause]
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; the blood of Jesus Christ is my my
[2:20:56] redeemer can do it.
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; We We had a lady we we've had a lady in

[2:21:50] "Now, Brother Windle, I know you're
[2:21:52] going to be mad at me cuz I didn't go
[2:21:53] through the prayer line." And I said,
[2:21:54] "Yeah, me and you going to talk." She
[2:21:56] said, "But no, listen. I was holding a
[2:21:58] baby for them out there, and so I just
[2:22:00] felt like this is what I needed to do. I
[2:22:01] was holding a baby for for for someone
[2:22:03] else." And she said, "But the presence
[2:22:05] of God came back there in the back
[2:22:07] anyways."
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Now, Mr. Pastor was saying, "Listen, I
[2:22:14] don't want to go to no more hospitals. I
[2:22:15] wanted you in that prayer line."

[2:23:37] &gt;&gt; Agonizing.
[2:23:39] &gt;&gt; Agonizing. I know.
[2:23:41] &gt;&gt; I know there's a lot of unbelief in the
[2:23:43] world. And I know that the devil's
[2:23:45] trying to come in our church and tell us
[2:23:47] that God can't do it. But there's going
[2:23:49] to be somebody that's going to be
[2:23:50] agonizing in prayer and calling out to
[2:23:53] God and say, "God, I believe you're
[2:23:55] true. I believe your word is true. I
[2:23:58] don't care." Amen. What all the what
[2:24:00] what all they say. I don't care what the

[2:29:20] ministers, he said, the revelation that

[2:29:24] says, you know, I

[2:30:19] We need one another.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Dear God, it's time for the big shock
[2:30:27] stuff to be over.
[2:30:28] [Applause]
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; When the prophet of God say, "Amen." He
[2:30:35] says, "If we look at this watch," he
[2:30:37] holds his watch up to find out what time
[2:30:39] it is, unless every instrument in that
[2:30:42] watch is coordinating one with the
[2:30:43] other, we'll never know the correct
[2:30:45] time. Is that right? And that takes all
[2:30:48] of us all together. If we want to see
[2:30:50] that third pull really do something for
[2:30:53] God, it's the coordination with every
[2:30:55] one of us together to humble ourselves
[2:30:59] before God.
[2:31:01] &gt;&gt; Confess our wrongs and pray and believe
[2:31:05] God for these things.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; Help me, Lord.
[2:31:17] Yes Lord.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord.

[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; I know this might not be a convention
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; message,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; but it's a
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; What do we want?
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Why did you all come all this way?
[2:32:39] There's way over a dozen states
[2:32:40] represented here

[2:33:17] And son, it'll produce.
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; The word will produce.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; Just needing somebody surrendered.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Just needing somebody
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; that'll own up to their
[2:33:32] responsibilities. Oh yes,
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; I told a young lady the other day,
[2:33:38] marriage is not for children.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Marriage is a responsibility.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Don't sherk,
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; pastors.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Don't sherk your responsibility.
[2:33:56] &gt;&gt; Evangelists, don't sherk your
[2:33:57] responsibility.
[2:34:01] [Music]
[2:34:04] This is the final leg.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; We are.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; We are the last.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:34:15] &gt;&gt; you young people, don't leave it to your
[2:34:16] mas and daddies and your youth leaders.
[2:34:18] It's time for someone to say, "God,
[2:34:22] I'm going to surrender everything that
[2:34:24] I've got.
[2:34:26] Glory to
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to live my life for you.
[2:34:32] I'm tired of playing on the fence.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of just giving it halfway.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus.
[2:34:44] [Music]
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; David had sinned.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; against God. And a great plague had came
[2:34:52] out and was killing tens of thousands.
[2:34:57] There David knew it was his own fault.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; There he was looking at his regrets.
[2:35:08] And I believe it was the prophet Gad
[2:35:10] that came up to him and said, "David,
[2:35:13] you've sinned against the Lord,
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; but he's just told me you get up there
[2:35:18] to the threshing floor of Arana."
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; And you offer a sacrifice.
[2:35:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; He'll meet you there. Amen.
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:35:28] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that David
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; He ran
[2:35:34] &gt;&gt; to the threshing floor of Urana. Arana.
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; And he says and and and Arana sees and
[2:35:42] he bows and he says, "What can I do for
[2:35:44] my king?" And he says, "I've come to buy
[2:35:47] your threshing floor for I want to offer
[2:35:50] unto the Lord
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; that that he is worthy of."
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And the Bible says, "Take
[2:35:58] and I give it to you and I'll give you
[2:36:00] all the ox and sheep that you need and
[2:36:03] all of the utensils."
[2:36:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he treated him as one
[2:36:09] king to another.
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; And David says, "I will not offer
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; to my God that which I which has cost me
[2:36:22] nothing."
[2:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:24] That's right.
[2:36:25] &gt;&gt; I will not offer to my God anything
[2:36:29] &gt;&gt; that doesn't cost me something.
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:36] &gt;&gt; Power.
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he bought the
[2:36:41] threshing floor.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; He bought the oxen.
[2:36:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; He paid for it all.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He got it all together
[2:36:50] and he begin to worship the Lord and
[2:36:52] calling unto the Lord
[2:36:55] and the Bible says that God met with
[2:36:58] them
[2:37:00] &gt;&gt; and the plague was stopped
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; the death angel. Come on, church.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; If there's somebody I you might be in
[2:37:08] there and you might be living, you're
[2:37:10] living you're being accountable. You're
[2:37:13] living with
[2:37:16] &gt;&gt; All right. Come on.
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; The junk of your decision
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; making
[2:37:24] &gt;&gt; and maybe it's cost you your children
[2:37:26] and maybe it's cost you your marriage
[2:37:28] and maybe it's cost you your walk with
[2:37:30] God.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[2:37:36] But if you can hear the prophet
[2:37:38] &gt;&gt; saying that if you'll just surrender to
[2:37:40] God, you'll come at the altar of his
[2:37:41] word.
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to take some sacrifice.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to die to yourself.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; You're going to have to give up your
[2:37:52] pride. You're going to have to give up
[2:37:53] these things. You've got to come
[2:37:55] sincerely before God.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to play with you.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; I'm not playing with my salvation. And I
[2:38:01] sure ain't playing with the salvation of
[2:38:03] my children. Exactly right.
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; Some families are children are are are
[2:38:13] are doomed because of the
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; absolutely
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; sins of the parents.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; Because mom and dad didn't want to take
[2:38:21] care of it.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It's the truth.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; What do I do, brother?
[2:38:27] [Music]
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; What does God require of me?
[2:38:34] Do I give him thousands of rivers of
[2:38:36] oil? Do I bring 10,000 oxen?
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; Can I give him my firstborn? Yes, sir.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; God's just wanting somebody
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; will give him their all.
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; God's just wanting somebody.
[2:38:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; To say, "I need you more than I need
[2:38:58] anything else."
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; Take me,
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; my things. You can have my things, too.
[2:39:04] But I want I want you to have me.

[2:39:12] me. Take me.
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go through life. I don't
[2:39:16] want to go through life running. I I
[2:39:19] want right now. I want you right now to
[2:39:21] make that decision before God.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:39:30] You're predestinated for this day.
[2:39:32] That's right.
[2:39:32] &gt;&gt; You're ordained for this day. He created
[2:39:35] you for this day. Not to be the puppet
[2:39:37] of the devil.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; But he's created you to be the powerful
[2:39:42] bride of Jesus Christ.
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; Under his headship.
[2:39:52] &gt;&gt; You are powerful. Yes, sir.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[2:39:59] Father,
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; that chopped up here tonight.
[2:40:11] What do you require of me?
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; What do you require
[2:40:18] of this preacher?

[2:40:24] I know you've given me gifts and
[2:40:33] I know you've
[2:40:36] got me to preach.
[2:40:39] God,
[2:40:41] what do you want of me?
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; I live two lives of Daisy.
[2:40:51] Oh,
[2:40:52] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you forgive me, Lord,
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; for my lack of passion,
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; you
[2:41:01] Lord.
[2:41:03] I'm asking, God, that you would take
[2:41:04] this congregation as they're
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; searching in their hearts.
[2:41:11] What would you require of them? Lord,
[2:41:13] we're given it all.
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:41:17] &gt;&gt; We're going to open every door. We're
[2:41:20] not going to keep one door closed.
[2:41:23] Come in our hearts right now. We open it
[2:41:25] up.
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; Take everything that's ungodly away from
[2:41:30] us. Everything that is not like your
[2:41:32] spirit, take away from us, Lord.
[2:41:37] &gt;&gt; We want souls to be saved. We want the
[2:41:40] sick to be healed. We want your purpose
[2:41:43] to be fulfilled in our lives and through
[2:41:46] our lives. Forgive
[2:41:50] us.
[2:41:53] Give us your grace right now, Lord.

[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; I want us to play real softly and you
[2:51:22] all sing it. Just Isn't he sweet to us
[2:51:25] tonight?
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Is he the sweetest name you know?

[2:52:17] the sweetest
[2:52:19] name
[2:52:21] I know.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to pray as I continue to play
[2:52:26] and we're going to pray over the food.
[2:52:28] Now, you're welcome to slip out and go.
[2:52:30] If we all go at once, there'll be a
[2:52:33] line, but if you just want to slip out
[2:52:34] and go, but some of you want to stay in
[2:52:36] worship. I believe his presence is here.
[2:52:39] This is an atmosphere that babies can be
[2:52:41] born into the kingdom of God.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; This is an atmosphere when we can lay
[2:52:46] aside every weight and the sin which
[2:52:49] does so easily beset us and run the race
[2:52:51] with patience.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; So, if you need to go, God bless you. I
[2:52:55] I'm going to pray and you'd be welcome
[2:52:57] to be dismissed, but if you can stay and
[2:52:59] worship with us, that'd be wonderful as
[2:53:01] well. As brother Kobe leads us, let's
[2:53:03] bow our heads together. Heavenly Father,
[2:53:07] Lord, I it's been our privilege to be in
[2:53:09] your presence tonight.
[2:53:13] &gt;&gt; What do you want from me? Lord Jesus,
[2:53:18] sometimes it's easy to look at the big
[2:53:20] things. Lord, I'd give you rivers of oil
[2:53:22] or
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; thousands of oxygen, but Lord,
[2:53:27] you want me.
[2:53:29] You want each one of us. You want a
[2:53:31] surrendered heart.
[2:53:34] I pray God that you'd help us Lord. We
[2:53:38] don't even know how to surrender without
[2:53:40] your leadership and guidance in our
[2:53:42] life. Help us, oh God. We lay our will
[2:53:46] down before you, oh God. Lord, all of
[2:53:49] our life, all of our plans, all of our
[2:53:51] hopes and dreams, we put it in your
[2:53:54] hands tonight. Believe that you'll take
[2:53:56] it. For you bless the food. We thank you
[2:53:59] for those that have worked so hard today
[2:54:00] to prepare this food that they've made
[2:54:02] it all themselves. And Lord, you know
[2:54:04] who they are tonight. I pray God that
[2:54:06] you bless them abundantly.
[2:54:09] Strengthen their families. Bless them
[2:54:10] God for their service to your people. We
[2:54:13] thank you for your presence Lord as we
[2:54:15] worship you. I pray that you just move
[2:54:17] among us Lord. We pray in Jesus name.
[2:54:22] Amen. Amen. Brother Josh Bennett will be
[2:54:24] preaching at 11:00 tomorrow morning. God
[2:54:27] bless you. Now let's just sing that
[2:54:28] again as we worship him. Now if you need
[2:54:31] to leave you feel free to go.
[2:54:34] Oh my Jesus
[2:54:38] is the king.
