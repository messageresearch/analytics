TRANSCRIPT
========================================
laughs well hopefully everybody enjoy it I think it's fun I like doing this kind of stuff so I guess it's turned out a budget to me we don't do it like we used to me and Jen used to really really kick out and track it daily so she said she said I'm good okay all right so we're gonna pick back up where we left off um so I'll kind of I'll be able to control the screen a little bit so we will have PowerPoints up you can take the camera off me if you want put it on the slides but so I'll kind of do a quick review so we talked about last time about the the master coming to three individual servants and he gave one five talents he gave one I think two and then the other one he gave one and so and this is directly after the the parable on the ten virgins with oil five width five without they sold there so um you know this was to me is pretty important in the in the scripture what we're what we're looking at here and and again what you've got to remember is financial peace is great but there's nothing like the peace that Christ gives you which is the peace that past all understands so you should never try to overpower that piece with this one okay so you've always got to fall in line with that first you know it's it's it's everything falls under that but this does give you an additional added peace with that but we went through that scripture and we titled this good and faithful servant so what God gives us we want to be faithful with and I think I'm put in there you know if you can't manage ten dollars you can't manage ten thousand so if you're not faithful in the least you can't be faithful in the whole okay so we we went through that he gave into one five gave him to one two gave into one one and so we know the the servant with five went and multiplied it five times over the servant with two doubled his and then I think the one with one Talent went and buried it and did nothing with it and so you know we're supposed to be faithful in the things that we do and I did have someone reach out to me it's pretty cool you know they were like well you know we have a little money and you know we we have it stashed back and they they listen to the seminar and you know that you know in that scripture the master says you know you should at least um had gained usury on it so which is interest and so they actually went and did that so just it's the little things that add up and and pay off in the end so um money management is a long game and I'm just going to do this quick review real quick it's it's a long game it's not something that you can do and just snap your fingers and overnight be like okay we got this we're good this is something that takes time and it takes consistency so don't think that tomorrow you're going to be like oh we got everything under control this is going to be a time thing and it's going to take you some time money management is not hard mentally you know it's really a two plus two game it's a two minus two game if you got five dollars and you spend six you're negative one dollar if you got five and you spend four you got one dollar okay so it's not a hard mental game but it is an emotional game and most of the spending that we do really is emotional you know if you look at the ads that pop up on Facebook and Instagram you know they've got an algorithm to see what you're looking at they know what you want you know it's hunting season for me and all that's popping up on my feed right now is hunting boots so that's what I'm looking at it's what I want they know that's what I want and so that's what they're giving me so um again going over we went over last time with married couples unfortunately this doesn't work if just one of you are on board you both have to be on board so if one of you is kind of driving and pushing this and the other one's not unfortunately it's not going to work things may get better but the overall plan will not will not work unless you're both on board and I put in here a quote that we read last time if you're not happy with what you have now why would you be happy with more of it so remember gratitude and gratefulness is is the best attitude that you can have because a lot of people look at as getting money as well I get money and you want to be greedy but the overall goal of this remember is not to be greedy not to not to store up and just for us but it's to it's to become financially free and then we're able to give and able to give back to those in need so um remember that we're going to go over the baby steps one more time and kind of just go over that and then we're going to work on today is just budgeting so just how to do a standard month-to-month budget okay does anybody have any questions from last time anything all right so again the seven baby steps so the first one is to save a thousand dollars the second one is to pay off all debt step three save three to six months of expenses for emergency step four is invest fifteen percent of your income for retirement five is safer college for your children if you want to I'm a little leeway on that I really hope mine don't go to college but I'm hoping we have some other options by then number six is pay off the house and seven is build wealth and give and so let's talk about maybe step one real quick and then we'll jump into the budgeting so saving a thousand dollars the easiest and quickest way to do this is sell stuff that you don't need find stuff around the house that you don't use sell it build that up really really quick second you want to pay off all debt we went over this last time you used What's called the snowball method you take your smallest debt okay so let's say you've got 500 on a credit card it's forty dollars a month and you maybe have three other credit cards and a car payment you list those out greatest to smallest okay and it's not payment amount the smallest is the balance okay we're going off the balances all right so we've got a credit card you owe 500 on monthly payments 40. we do our budget we've got an extra eighty dollars in the budget or an extra hundred dollars in the budget all that extra money goes to that debt okay after you pay off that debt which was 500 which had a monthly balance of 40 then that 100 you have left over in your budget plus the 40 now goes to the next step so now you're paying 140 extra on that and so as you see you pay off that debt maybe say it was a hundred dollars a month well now you have two hundred and forty dollars freed up in your budget you continue that on and you see that's why they call it a snowball it continuously gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger So eventually after you pay off those debts you know you maybe have a three extra three hundred dollars on the budget extra four extra five you're throwing that on dead and it just kind of snowballs from there um after you do that you save three months three to six months expenses for all emergencies um the way that you figure this out is you go over you look at your year from last year and we'll go over how to budget in this and how to figure up you know some of you self-employed people um maybe you have side jobs different things I'm gonna I'm gonna go over all that how you figure out all this how you figure this all out saving three to six months expenses you go out and you look at your total last year if you can if things have changed you've gotta you gotta Factor those in but let's say your monthly expenses are around say three thousand dollars okay that's that's 36 000 a year that it costs you to live and So within that let's say that your house payment insurance gas groceries you want to plan to buy new clothes plan to buy new tires once a year oil changes for your vehicles you want to go on vacation so you budget all this out and so you do that and then you're going to figure out how much that is factored over the year and so let's say it's three thousand so that means you got to put nine thousand in a savings account now this is not money that you invest so you don't put this in Investments this is money that you can go and grab immediately okay this is money you can go and get it goes in a savings account money market something like that you want again you want to earn as much interest as you can on this money you know but this is not checking account money we all know if we put money in our checking account it magically disappears step four is invest 15 of your income for retirement now I did have several people reach out to me um self-employed people or people that work for employers that don't offer retirement plans and this is very very common where we live you just need to go find a financial advisor and figure out how to start investing um for retirement but remember you don't do any of these steps until the one previous above it is completed okay um save for college for your children I'm really hoping mine want to start their own business or work for themselves or you know invest in rental houses or something that they can do that they don't have to do that but if they if they end up being really smart like their mom they might be okay at college and they can they can go off and do it fortunately if they get my brain they're going to struggle they got put on academic suspension and academic probation in college by the way still turned out okay got kicked out of college for my my brain see it all worked out in the end right nobody left I really thought I'd get some laughs off of that all of you expected they were like no we expected you to get kicked out of college we we fully expected it yeah I guess it was academic probation first then academic suspension but they let me back in and I finished and got my degree in something that I don't even work in anymore so praise the Lord step six is pay off the house step seven is build wealth and give again we are not doing this to be greedy we're doing this to give back I believe the the scripture that we read last time I'm not going to go back through those because we just we just don't have enough time a wise man leaves an inheritance to his children's children so you know the goal is to create a generational wealth we can get our families ahead in life again it is not to be um just rich and have all this money and not and not be giving with it so the next slide so we're going to go over what what a budget is a budget tells you what you can do not what you can't do okay so a budget is a guy to tell you what you have the power to do most people look us at a budget and they say well this is going to tell me everything that I cannot do that's not it it tells you what you can do so you know if you like energy drinks and you want to spend 379 a day on it five days a week you need to put that in your budget all right so if I want to spend 20 a week on energy drinks I just put simply put that in my budget make sure I plan for it a budget is about planning okay and so I did um like anyone else good would do I went and isolated a quote in the in the message and I got this from Brother random in 1952 and I'm just kidding about isolating a quote but he said we're never out to receive Finance never and he's talking about going overseas on a mission trip he says if I ever get that in my mind God help me to act gentleman enough about me to walk off the field and pray through till God gets my heart right with him again see it's not that he said but we're a little bit desperately needy now he said it's true he said because I was out of service for about seven months I went several hundred dollars in debt and I've got to get that up he said then I've got to make up my budget for overseas where I'll know of it where I know a vision is calling me and he says I believe when it's all made up then God will let me go so look at how important the budget was to him you know he did not even want to go overseas until that budget was made because he didn't want to waste God's people's money is that right so it appears to be him he wasn't even going to go on the mission trip until that budget was made and set and what he needed to do over there so I think if the prophet was careful with God's children's money God's children should be careful with their money as well so I found that quote he only mentions budget about five times in the scripture excuse me in the message but when he does he's usually dealing with with a mission trip or they were building I think for a church fund he talks about that and then one other place he was talking about another another mission trip so um again some quotes a budget tells your money where to go instead of wondering where it went so I think Dave Ramsey talks about this a lot that's actually a quote from Dave Ramsey and he talks about this a lot is is every dollar is like a little soldier and you're going to tell it what to do so every dollar is an employee to you and you see that you tell it well this one's going to go here this one's going to go here and a lot of what I'll show you today is called a zero balance budget um this scares a lot of people my wife's not a big fan of it sometimes but what it is is at the end of the month you balance out at zero to having no money left but you tell that money to go into savings you tell the extra money to go here and go here and go there it is a little difficult because it doesn't give you much leeway for error you know so let's say you've got 300 budgeted for groceries and you've got fifty dollars budgeted for eating out and you you go 25 over budget so you went 75 well you got to pull that money from somewhere else it doesn't magically just appear at the bottom line so you got to go pull that from another budget because you're working with your total monthly income so used correctly a budget doesn't restrict you it empowers you and it really does it's hard it's it's hard to get on a budget but once you start it really does let you know it kind of gives you that peace of mind where you're like you know I know where this money's going I know where it's coming from and it just kind of makes everything fall in line there um I did this quote in two it was from an unknown author but it says more money can't fix bad spending habits so I think we talked about that a little bit last time is the more you make or you know a lot of people make a lot of money but it's not about how much you make it's about how much you keep right you know so somebody making a quarter of a million dollars a year and spending a quarter million dollars a year and then someone making 30 000 a year and spending twenty thousand at the end of the year they actually the lower income individual has more money than the high income earner so um always always remember that's how much money you keep okay here's simply the definition of a budget it's estimate of income and expenditure for a set period of time we are going to do our budgets based off of a monthly time period okay I did we will get into self-employed people here in a minute and kind of talk about how they need to do their income because it is very difficult for a self-employed income or self-employed individual to balance theirs over a year so your budget needs to be completed monthly and checked weekly and in some cases daily so it depends on where you are in the baby steps and how often you need to be checking in with your budget the main thing again with couples because most of the people here are married couples you've got to be on the same team okay if you're an individual that's great it's you no one else you can sit down and you kind of can hold yourself accountable but a husband and wife you both got to be on the same page okay just remember that it won't work House Divided will not stand so um it's good to plan for the year or even three or five years but your budget needs to be completed monthly so I'm really big in setting setting goals you know so you have something to strive for so you should set a one-year goal where you're going to be in a year um and again to me this is really fun you can sit down with a calculator and you can see where you're going to be financially um you can and that's with nothing going wrong and those changes as you go through the year um but but it's very very fun now you're going to prepare your budget on your net income which is Tech take home pay okay so we're not doing it off the gross like everybody else you know like the government and all that it's not gross this is your take-home pay so this is cash that you have to work with Okay so remember that so let's go over um real quick income so I did this just simply for the math okay so let's say your bring home pay is 500 a week okay let's average that over the year so we're going to take 500 times 52 how many weeks are in a year we come out twenty six thousand okay twenty six thousand divided by 12 is 2166 dollars per month so your monthly income bring home pay is 2166 dollars now let's talk about self-employed individuals you need to use last year's income average that out over a monthly rate now I know some of you you're going to have more work in the winter or you're going to have more work in the summer but you still need to average it out over the year because you need to know what you're working with now so if the previous year's net income was thirty thousand you divide that by 12 you come up with your monthly income of twenty five hundred that's what you need to base your budget off of now if you're new to being self-employed you do not have your past history you do not have a set weekly income what you're going to do is your expenses should not be varying that much right your your life expenses should not be changing week to week one week you shouldn't have to spend you know a thousand dollars to live in the next week a hundred those should be kind of kind of set so and again your expenses which we'll go over here in a minute you should know what those are going to be based off of the next month right so you would figure your expenses at a monthly rate and your income at a weekly rate okay so what it is is you plan your budget for the month and then week one say you make 750 but then week two you make 375. you factor that out over the month and you just check your budget weekly so it's like where am I at now so I can know where I'm going to be next week okay this is tedious but it is necessary so I don't put giving under expenses that'll come next but this should be the first thing that we look at doing um tithing I put 10 percent if you have any questions talk to your pastor don't ask me about tithing because I will not instruct you on tithing offering if you're given simply to receive then you're doing it wrong so the thought here is not to just give so that I get back I'm going to give this and God's going to bless me now that's a good thought to have that's the belief that you should have that's the faith that you should have but you should give without wanting to receive right if you're giving to receive that's not a gift that's a trade it's like I'll trade God five dollars for health you know that's a trade it's not how this works like well I'm gonna give my wife a back row but she's giving me one after I give her one that's just a trade you know man Stone Cold faces in the audience tonight so you'll never out give God but you need to track it and plan for it okay you got it all y'all are like she still hasn't given me that back rub back this is not a fair trade but that's what a gift is right you know if I was if Stewart gave me 12 arrows he's like hey I want to give you these and then I gave him 100 bucks back that's just a trade it's not a gift okay so tithing talk to your pastor offering set in your budget know what it's going to be and follow it okay now there's going to be times where maybe a special Minister come through or the pastor asks you to give to a certain thing then you do that as you feel led right and then you go back and adjust the budget and say well I took an extra 20 30 40 50 100 out of this I'm going to calculate it out of this and so you know we decided to give to a missionary so we're not going to eat out this month we're gonna do something else okay well it's pretty pretty easy to do um always give without remembering and always receive without forgetting I thought that was a really really cool quote that I had um logged back so always give without remembering which means don't give to receive you're not giving this so that people know what you did or so that even you know what you did and then always receive without forgetting so when you're blessed remember that okay Malachi 3 8 I threw this scripture in there because I think I mentioned it in the previous one will a man rob God he says yet you have robbed me but you say wherein have we robbed thee and he said in ties and offerings so you know the Viewpoint a lot of people like well you know I'm I've got to pay my tithes that's my duty to God but you also want to pay and actually give an offering as well I believe the more that you give the more that God will bless you but again if you give if you give with the attitude that you're going to receive you're given in the wrong Spirit and the wrong the wrong mindset right so next we're going to talk about his savings so the emergency fund Jen and I still use the emergency fund um all the time so what what we do is even though we have you know I think we're on baby step six even though we have the the money over here in a different account that we have set up the way that we use the emergency fund is is say if we're running through the week and and maybe we're going to come up short or or we need extra money for something that that is planned we pull from that thousand dollars so I always keep that emergency fund tied to my checking where I can get to it very very quickly um you know you can even set it up automatically as a sweep into your account that if you go under a certain amount you can pull over from it but then the way I have it set up is I give I think it's like 45 dollars a week is directly deposited into that fund so when it gets over that a thousand when it gets up a couple hundred dollars I'll transfer that out and move it around but a lot of times you know if I have to use it it'll build back up very very quickly or it's usually right there but I try to keep an eye on that always try to keep that at a thousand so if you use the emergency fund redo your budget and build it back to a thousand you know this is kind of your rainy day fund and it's always going to rain at some time any of you who have lived in the last few years know that you're going to need some extra cash at some time to do something and again these are emergencies a vacation is non-emergency a birthday is not an emergency a new bow unfortunately is not an emergency the money is not for impulsive purchases right this is for immediate emergencies so an emergency is when your tire blows out our emergency is when something happens wrong with the car an emergency is when you have to take your kid to the emergency room and health insurance covers this but you got a hundred dollar copay or whatever it is those are emergencies okay a vacation is not a new purse it's not an emergency nothing is is an emergency okay a sale at your favorite store is not an emergency no one likes the budgeting part as much as the last one Jen asked me how the last one was like it went really really good and so she didn't get to come to it and so she's sitting on this one and it's not going very very good so everybody's just kind of like but tell me what to do with my money and husband's wife you'll have that conversation when you start budgeting especially if you're a dual income so get ready for that one nobody yep all right expenses let's go over expenses I'm trying to get people to lighten up just Just a Touch so I kind of listed out expenses now these are going to vary for each family right some of you are going to have different fees you may have an HOA fee I've never lived in a nice enough place to have homeowners association so you know some of you are going to have different fees but you need to budget those in whatever those fees are you're also going to have annual fees and what I like to do is if I have a big annual fee I factor it out over the month okay so like if I have my gas bill we use propane to heat the house our hot water heater runs off propane so you know I buy that I think I buy it about once a year and it's about four or five six hundred dollars but you want to factor that out over the months okay so you know if it's if it's 600 you divide that by 12 you set aside that much money through the month now you don't need to leave it in checking account or it will get swallowed up in that set it aside open a different account put that in there so that you budget for it so but most typical families your expenses are going to be housing vehicle transportation food health insurance personal and debt so I do want to go over just a few things with you now again a lot of this is a matter of opinion and I have a lot of people get mad at me when I talk about vehicles or homes or amounts or any of that and it's okay to be mad at me it's not going to bother me at all so when I tell you this it doesn't mean that you need to go and just well this is what Alan said and brother Ben put him up here so we've got to follow it you know blindly no that's not the case all I'm telling you is the average that is factored out for for us this is what we should do so mortgage rent this this is the we're going to go into the housing so we're going to individualize all these items in our budget we're going to go over those so for housing usually first is mortgage or rent right you got your home payment or your rent the payment should never exceed 25 of your take-home pay so this is where a lot of people get mad that doesn't mean that if you have if you pay more than 25 your take-home pay that you need to go and sell your house and do something really really crazy you obviously need to get guidance but you shouldn't have a house payment or rent that's more than 25 percent of your take-home pay so this individual that we're going to do a budget on we've already done their income they make 500 a week bring home pay 25 of the 2166 which is their monthly income net income is 541.50 that individual should not get a house payment or rent higher than that okay now this is just you know this person that we're doing this Budget on I gave them a credit card payment an auto payment and a house payment so you may not have an auto payment you may not have a credit card payment then you can squeeze a little bit more into your mortgage and rent so remember this is not set in stone but these are good things to remember so the way that I did mine and Jenny's when we were looking at this we wanted to do a 15-year mortgage it had a better rate now the payment was double it was practically actually it was about 75 percent more and so that's good but at that time I think Jen was still working in nursing I was working still and I think I was even embalming on the side so that payment wasn't that bad now when Jen quit nursing and went full time at our business that changed a little bit that payment kind of increased a little bit so it's pretty high now it's still not over 25 percent of my take-home pay but that's something you want to pay attention to okay so like if you do have a dual income or or you're wanting to slow down on your workload you want to kind of be thinking about that in the future like you know do I want to pay for this for 30 years or 15 years so the goal is to get a 15-year mortgage you're going to get a lower interest rate and the amount of interest that you'll pay over the life of the loan is going to be direct drastically less okay so um then next we have electric water gas trash internet phone Etc so now you could go through your budget and you figure out what you need for your house how much you need um you know some of you are not going to have a gas bill some of you may have natural gas instead of propane but the main thing when you're doing this is you want to make sure that you don't leave any stone unturned anything that you're going to have to pay for for that year you're going to want to make sure that you do so I've got an example for you if you bought a hundred and fifty thousand dollar house at six percent and you did a loan term of 30 years the total interest you'll pay over the life of the loan is a hundred and seventy four thousand that's the interest not including your payment not including your principal reduction Okay so so the 150 000 house that you bought you actually paid 324 000 for it over a thirty year so you paid a hundred and seventy four thousand interest if you do it on a 50-year loan you pay 77 000 in interest so you pay almost a hundred thousand dollars less than a year in just half the term so remember that when you're going into this interest is calculated over the balance daily interest is accrued daily it never takes vacation it never sleeps it is there always earning and accruing so it never stops but it's figured off your balance a lot of people have a have a problem with like well how am I paying this much this much this much interest is figured off your balances your balance is 150 your payment's 800 a month but 400 of that goes to interest your payment reduces your balance reduces by 400. 400 went to interest vanishes the other 400 goes to principal reduction you now owe 149 600 interest is now figured off of that and it slowly slowly slowly amortizes out FYI little lesson okay so those are your expenses for your housing next is vehicle and transportation so and I've got some information on vehicles in here that people are going to get mad at me about too but it's okay gas tires oil change and maintenance so me and Jen have been trying to figure out a way to buy a vehicle through our business because we do not want to go buy a vehicle because I've preached so hard against them but we want one so bad so we've been going back and forth on this for forever can we afford one yes 100 do we want to do that no we're very divided on it so you know we go back and forth I just want you to know how the struggle is like even though we have the money to do it it's it's hard to go and just say man I want to do I want to spend it on that though you know do I want to do I want to get a thousand dollar payment or do I want to travel two weekends a month or do I want to travel one weekend a month and you know so so there's there's these thoughts all the time no matter you know where you get in this financial piece program or where you get in this you're always going to have these challenges it's not just going to vanish to where you don't have to make decisions anymore But A good rule of thumb is and what we've come to because we've been talking about this for months now um you know finally the other day we we didn't have kids we sat down we kind of talked and you know we decided not to do it the next day we were both sending vehicles that we were finding online now we're probably not going to buy them but you're still going to go through these struggles it's not going to change any bit you're like well we don't have car payments and our cars work fine mine's a little loud and old and doesn't have a full-size Back Seat but it gets this from A to B hers you know we were talking to it's like he'll forget your new vehicle the kids are just going to destroy it anyways you know they've ripped our seeds they've just destroyed the vehicle destroyed it so these are things that you've got to think of right but you want to plan for gas Tire oil changes and maintenance I know people that will go get a new car so they want to put tires on it don't be that person change your oil maintenance your car these are very very important things for longevity of vehicles you know my vehicle is 20 24 years old Jens is right at 18 15 years old they run fine hers actually has more miles I think it's like 206 we had to have new wheel bearings put in and brakes and it was 900 bucks and that's a pretty expensive bill but that's better than a 900 monthly payment every month so you've kind of got to factor these out and say you know once you get that payment you've got sales tax you've got your insurance that's going to go up on a vehicle that's priced more if you get a loan on it you've got to have full coverage because the bank requires it you know there's all these little factoring things that kind of trickle into this okay but you need to factor for gas tires oil changes maintenance anything that's going to fall under that vehicle transportation okay all right food groceries restaurants you should not be eating out if you're not gracely greatly reducing your debt so a lot of people remember when me and Jen were doing the program we're pretty hard on this and um you know like if the church was going to McDonald's we wouldn't go we would just Skip and we'd go home and eat you know it just it just was what it was so it's not fun to maybe do this part I thought it was because I like my wife and I like being home so to me it's better than seeing any of you guys so you know I was fine with it but it doesn't work for everybody there's a lot of social people out there that that require that social interaction so now you should never recluse and pull away that's bad right I love all of you you're welcome in my house anytime after the fall of 2026 but you know this this is a hard part it's not as fun to go home and say eat a bologna sandwich when you have money that you could spend on eating out but that's why you've got to know the why we talked about this in the last one why do you want to do this and again I gave you my wife so I can spend more time with my family and have Financial Freedom where I can work for myself do whatever I want and so that's kind of my why so got 23 minutes left so I really highly wouldn't recommend eating out I've had people argue with this a lot of um what's really funny is I wasn't given this seminar about three or four times and I've done a lot of individuals one-on-one but somebody will always come back to me after this and tell me a better way what they're doing that's better than this so I can tell you I can't tell you what you're doing is better or worse I'm not going to get into that argument with you or or discuss that if you come up with me with something I'm just going to stand there and Nod my head and say that's crazy and then walk away I can tell you one thing this plan does work okay if you're not going to stick to the plan just don't stick to the plan but if you're gonna do it do it with your whole heart do it wholeheartedly and I promise you great things will happen so the next we're going to go to is Health since I own a gym I put a gym membership in here just if any of you want to give me money um but you got medicine gym supplements and doctor visits there's other things that fall within this so you should be thinking about that um I think if any of your if any of your employees offer an HSA account you need to be using it if they don't you can set one up through your bank easy peasy your HSA is deducted out of your gross different than other expenses so the government does not tax your HSA dollars the same way they tax your income dollars so you make this income and you actually say you give um me and Jen what I give I think I give a hundred dollars a week to HSA and if I was to just take that income the government would take like 40 percent of it but instead they only take like 10 or 15 it's a much lesser percentage so I get to keep that out now you can only use it for health related costs but the government does not tax it the same so they are very important to have you can build this up over time you can use it for long-term Health we use it for all of our co-pays um ER visits you get an HSA debit card you use it like that so if you don't have that you can set that up on your own okay if you do have it when you give to it you'll notice that your net doesn't change as much when you give to that okay so um I believe health is very important over the overall lifespan when you get older the better you took care of yourself at a younger age probably the better unless there's drastic health conditions the better you're going to be off in your older age all right next is insurance so we went over this last time health insurance I've been very fortunate that my employer or my wife's employer has always given health insurance benefits I understand that it's very very expensive if you do not have an employer that offers this I hear it's insanely expensive I know there's there's opportunities out there for others what I would do is reach out to a family that's similar to yours in size and location and see what they're doing figure out if there's um I think there's some families that do this Christian Medishare I think there's something that come through Obamacare that people can still tap into so look at all of those options it's very important to have health insurance if you can if you can get it for free or qualify for some kind of program go for that auto insurance anything that you do on you should have insured now um I was actually thinking talking about gin you know on my truck I don't think it's really if I went to sell it it's not worth much but I think I still have full coverage on it so maybe paying 75 80 a month when I could maybe pay 40 because the insurance company's not going to give me that much anyways so if you know if I if it lasted another year I'm going to recoup my my losses in that monthly payment so you know could switch that from Full to liability so there's things like that but remember if you do that you're taking that risk to where they're not going to give you a dime for your vehicle so always make sure you have that factored right risk first reward life insurance we talked about this last time every head of household income producer should have term life insurance it is easy to do I think I have a million or more in coverage now it's a 20-year term okay so when I turn I think I got it when I was 30 this last time because we increased it maybe 30 32 when I turned 52 it goes away now the insurance companies typically went on these because they they really do factor that you're going to live beyond that but if there was a catastrophic event a vehicle wreck something else any hunting accident anything like that they would pay and so you want to set this up to 10 times if you bring home pay so if you make if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you want to have a term life policy insurance covering five hundred thousand dollars a year that way your wife does not have to go back to work for a good 10 years she can live continuously as she is for 10 years you should have it I think a million dollars coverage on me um my blood work's good my blood pressure is good my heart rate's good so the stuff that they did I think it was like 57 a month so to me it's worth having that so that that my family would be taken care of if I died homeowners insurance Etc so whatever types of insurance you have some of you self-employed people may pay for like um a Disability Policy through like Aflac or something like that you can buy those policies just make sure you budget for It Whatever It Is personal phones clothes Child Care entertainment subscriptions cut any subscription if you can restaurants date nights vacation Etc so this is where the budget remains fun you you plan for the things you're going to do so if you want to take your wife on a date once a week or once a month um just depending on how much she can stand to be around you you want to plan for this okay phones one thing that I've found is phones are so expensive I cannot tell you how much I want to overthrow ATT but the phone bills are just ridiculous try to find the best and the good thing is there's a lot of plans out there now that can get you similar to equal service for a lot less of the price and no contract try to find something like that especially if you're starting off you do not need 5G Wi-Fi coverage while you're driving down the road you know get what you need okay but but try to limit these you don't need every time they come out with a new phone you don't need to go get a new phone they're expensive they always lock you back into a contract you know if your phone breaks and it's a hundred dollars to get a new screen or they can set you up on a 27.99 monthly payment plan for 36 months which one should you do 100 screen y'all should have been shouting it at me okay so you want to be thinking about these things okay these are things that you just you kind of ingrain in yourself and eventually you'll change and be a grouch like me when somebody tries to sell you something nobody left again so the phones close again I think I was telling Joel this you only need one belt it can be reversible if you want but you only need one belt you only got two feet you don't need a ton of shoes I'm sorry you just don't I have dress shoes work shoes weed eating shoes hunting boots and I do have two sets of hunting boots got me there I got two sets of hunting boots but remember this is not about the items you know we talked about last time you know I want you want to have an experienced you want to have a good fun life right that's what I want to have for for me and my family so to me it's not about the items you know it's not about those things so just try to limit those things and and buy necessity items um entertainment I know none of you have any music apps or Disney Plus or Netflix or YouTube none of y'all have that because we're in the message so if you do have it cut it subscriptions if you've got magazines subscriptions I don't even know who reads magazines anymore but cut them uh if you've got any subscriptions on your phone like games or apps or anything like that cut those things out okay budget for restaurant date nights vacations Etc so if you want to budget for a vacation you just figure out how much the vacation is going to cost whatever's left over in your budget you put to that okay now these are going to factor into the debt here in a little bit and then you plan that out okay um birthday parties are not a surprise we know what that's going to be we know that our kids are going to have one every year they're going to remind us about six months ahead of time so we can kind of plan for those things right at least my kids do um and what I do me and Jen do that I really like is we put um ten dollars a week into an account for our kids um it's automatically pulled out and we use that occasionally for birthdays Christmas sometimes it builds up this last time we went on vacation Jen doesn't even know this she just lets me do it but I took out 150 you know I took 50 out of each one we use that for them to have fun at the beach gas whatever it was wherever that money went it went to them going on vacation so so that's something cool that you can do and you just kind of have access to that money where birthday's Christmas whatever else it's not a surprise you can just jump in and do that now some of you got five seven kids that kind of adds up over the week if you're given ten dollars per child so you may need to factor that out pun intended for all the four family kids in here still only you got three so um so let's talk about debt here for a minute auto loans it's a good rule of thumb now again this is where people are going to yell at me and get mad at me and text me later but again this is just my opinion so you should never own Vehicles exceeding half your annual income now this is even if you're debt free or not debt free so if you make a hundred thousand a year your vehicle shouldn't be more than fifty thousand dollars now again what I tell people is if you're debt free you have the money to do it or you're not debt free and you have the money to do it do what you want to do I don't care okay if you if you like doing those things you should do them this is not for everyone this is for people who want Financial Peace they don't they don't want items or things they just want to live a little bit different they want to lay down at night and just kind of kind of breathe a little easier so and that doesn't mean the people that that have auto loans aren't right I've had them I've had them almost all my life I just don't have them now and have it for the last five or six years and don't want another one that's just me it's not for everybody so I mean we kind of want another one and when I say we I strongly mean my wife but I'm kind of there with her but again I'm not chopping any of you down if you've got one I think I showed y'all in the last and the last program that you know we had spent a hundred and 50 some thousand on vehicles in our first seven eight years of marriage so again this is not for everyone this is for for who wants to live just a little different okay so personal loans and credit cards now you're going to have debts that's fine so the next slide that I'm going to show you is going to be kind of an example budget now if any of you want me to sit down and do your budget with you it's kind of hard to see on the screen um if any of you want me to do that that's fine I will definitely do it for you um no charge but just know I'm going to be in there telling you what to do so you don't have to listen but that's just the that's just the UN unfun perk that comes with it so the monthly budget we did with someone who brought home 500 a week this is their net pay this is what they get paid and then I also added in an additional monthly income of 250 for a side job so let's say let's say you go do something once a weekend you go and clean gutters or you go mow a few yards or you go clean a house or you clean vehicles on the side whatever you do you get an additional 250 in income so the way you figure that is 500 times 52 so they're 52 weeks in a year it comes out to twenty six thousand divide that by 12 months in the year that comes up to 2166 dollars plus your 250 sign job gives you a net income 2416 okay so out of that I put the ties at 215 offering at five or offering at 50. now these are monthly expenses you give as you fill in okay so this doesn't mean if you're giving 75 now you need to drop it to 50. brother Ben be getting on to me okay don't do that you give as you fill it okay I think I factored I don't remember how I factored the offering but it was like five or ten dollars every time we were in church I think it was five dollars it's 15 times a week I put 15 a week that you were given an offering you feel free to give three times that amount okay this was just a factor that I did I put their ex their expenses their mortgage and rent was 6.75. now that's over the 25 percent of their bring home pay so they're already off a little bit there electrics 125 your electric fluctuates if any of you live through the summer of 2023 August and July electric bills were not fun I think my last one come in on August was 200 did not like it at all but it is what it is right water is 25 some of you have a well I don't have to factor in water if you have a well you don't have to factor in water either homeowners insurance auto loan credit card auto insurance term life insurance clothing groceries gas internet phone and so after you factor all these items out and I I did these pretty close to what they should be okay for someone making this amount of money having a house that would have a 675 dollar payment I factored this out the best they could and so their balance remaining is 41 Okay so and you know a lot of you are like oh man well I have more than 41 dollars in the month some of you are like well I don't even have 41 dollars well it doesn't matter what you have left what you don't okay you're going to factor this to your lifestyle okay now what you do with that remaining forty one dollars does anyone want to tell me what you do with the rain 41 dollars no do not treat yourself Allison you add it to the smallest debt okay and so so this forty one dollars let's see what our smallest debt is smallest dead is going to be the credit card it has a monthly payment of 45 and I think I gave them a balance of around 500. so that forty one dollars is going to go back into the budget until that gets paid off that debt is forty five dollars So at the end of this when that gets paid off you have eighty six dollars extra in the budget right now I'm thinking some of you are crafty you're going to find ways to cut the budget you're going to find things to sell that you don't need um one thing that I like to do is I like to scrap stuff I don't know how I find metal but I like scrap and stuff it's just fun going to the scrap yard you know I enjoy it I like I like scrap of metal you know last time I took a load I made like I don't know 270 dollars took me a long time to do it but I loved it it was fun so find Nifty ways to make extra money and you're like man do I really want to put the time into that you know do I want to do these things that's again up to you what's your why why do you want to do this so as you go through and budget remember the budget is there to tell you what you can do what you not what you can't do now husbands and wives hear me well you don't want to come in let me tell you if you're trying to convince your spouse to do this if you come in guns blazing like this is what we're doing and you're going to submit yourself and we're going to do this it's not going to work it's not and most of the time it's the wife doing this to the husband it's not it's not the other way around unfortunately it's more that way so so just know the better that you can present this to them the better it's going to come across okay me and Jen did not always magically agree on money I think our first two or three years most of our fights were over money or her family that was it you know um this is why Jen doesn't come to these but but that's what it that's what it was and so they talk about divorces and the majority of divorces are over financial problems so a good way to limit these is to kind of plan for these now you're not going to always find a spouse that's going to fall into line with this you're just not some people are just not going to do it so what you've got to do then is just really get out on your knees and pray that God can change them and you do the best that you can right but I think if you can come together and you can agree on this it will drastically change your life it'll change your home life or how your kids perceive home life how they perceive giving and and all these things so you need to set the tone for your family but again you want to agree on these things when you come together to do your first budget there's going to be one person that wants to slash everything me and there's going to be one that wants to kind of put money where it should go like well we should put money to where we eat out once a week or once a month because we don't want to just alienate ourselves from everything and go home and eat rice and beans and not talk to anyone with the lights off you know that's not good either so can it be done sure would it be fun no but it can be done so you don't want to do those things you want to find that happy median so you don't want to come into your spouse and be like you know I know that you like coffee you got to quit that's just destruction waiting to happen if you tell your spouse they got a quick coffee be like Jen tell me not to drink energy drinks I'll be like you're kind of crazy you're creeping me out a little bit you know so you can't do those things and this is not this is definitely not marriage counseling but I will promise you your fights or if you do argue about money now this is going to fix 100 of those arguments excuse me the message we don't argue we discuss so this is going to fix those discussions got to throw that in our pastor has a perfect church we got five minutes before I kind of close this out does anybody have any questions or thoughts or or comments I know most people just hit me up after the the thing but if you if you have any questions right now I mean ask away but I'll give you time while I close it up the budget is set monthly you know what your expenses are going to be okay if you have an annual expense remember Factor it out over the month go get you if you have a big Bill that comes up at the end of the year and go open up a free checking account or a free savings account you don't want anything with fees you don't want paper statements you just want to put that money there and never touch it okay go do that put that money aside if you've got a big 500 tax bill that comes due at the end of the year or 250 whatever it is go set that money aside and do not touch it okay you know um if if you have if you have unknown income like let's say you are self-employed one thing that I've talked to several people about is once they get this um once they kind of get their life in line on the financial side self-employed individuals are able to go through those slower times because they have this additional cash set back for that they maybe paid themselves for that there's a really good book and I think me and brother Isaac were talking about it it's called the richest man in Babylon a lot of people won't read it because he doesn't give ties an offering but you can just read it and know you're going to give ties an offering but what he talks about in that book is paying himself first and so that's what I've tried to do and Jen and I have tried to do is is to always pay ourselves first now when I say that know that we pay God first right we give our 10 then we pay ourselves first so before I pay debt anything like that I've already got automatic transfers going into savings and then all of our retirement money plan going into the Investments so I can't I can't get my hands on that to spend it I've already paid it to where it goes somewhere where I can't just go and easily access that money so the more that you can do that now again you don't want to do any of that until your debt debt free okay this is this is a baby step and I have a lot of people come up to me at the end and they'll be like well we want to go ahead and start investing but we're not debt free and and all this stuff it doesn't work that way you've got to go through the baby steps okay any questions tell me see I like that yeah I agree hey me going to the Bow Shop saves me every day yeah yeah see that's the thing that I'm embarrassed most with like if me and Jen set down to do a budget and I have to budget hunting season in then she's going to know how much I actually spend on it it's not fun to do yeah that's where the scrap that's right that's where you go and sell scrap metal yeah so baby steps one more time and we're done save a thousand dollars tips to do this sell everything but the kids right sell clothes on Facebook scrap metal find something in your garage that you don't use that you haven't used um you know DVDs that you don't watch anymore because you just don't watch DVDs because you're a Christian so you just you sell those anything that you've got sell that you don't use okay and I'm being light-hearted and joking but anything that you don't use so right it's really easy to do so save a thousand dollars then you pay off all debt do that with a snowball method save 36 months of expenses for emergencies next is invest fifteen percent of your income then you're going to save for your children's College pay off the house build wealth and give okay all right that's all I got I don't know if we'll do another Don't Clap yet I don't know if we'll do another one Stuart's so ready to leave I don't know if we'll do another one but if we do it'll just kind of be a recap of this but if you need help with your budget let me know okay [Applause] thank you
