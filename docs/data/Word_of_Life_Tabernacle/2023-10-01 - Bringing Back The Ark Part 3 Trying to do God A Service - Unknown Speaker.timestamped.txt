[48:10] Sunday morning and when we can all get
[48:12] together you know I know a mother feels
[48:15] like when all their children are around
[48:17] the table at Thanksgiving is just a
[48:19] highlight of your life you know if you
[48:21] could ever get them all there that's
[48:22] what we feel about church sometimes we
[48:24] could ever go get everybody here but but
[48:27] I'm glad you're here this morning and
[48:29] thank you for coming and we just enjoy
[48:31] so much the fellowship with you and
[48:33] around the word of God because I know
[48:36] you're Believers and and it's so good to
[48:38] preach the Believers I don't know what
[48:40] we would do if we had to preach
[48:41] unbelievers all the time make Believers
[48:43] I know there's some of that in every
[48:45] church but I'm just going to believe
[48:46] your Believers this morning
[48:48] and that you're wanting to hear the word
[48:51] of God so you just pull on the word and
[48:53] I know God will bless you this morning
[48:54] and even questions you may have maybe he
[48:57] just answered those and I wouldn't even
[48:59] have to know about it he could just
[49:00] answer it and uh isn't he don't you
[49:02] believe he can do that this morning he's
[49:04] that kind of God I know he's done it
[49:06] before he can do it again good to see
[49:08] each and every one of you this morning
[49:10] first Chronicles 13 and 1 and David
[49:13] consulted with the captains of thousands
[49:15] and hundreds and with every leader
[49:18] and David said unto all the congregation
[49:21] of Israel if it seemed good unto you and
[49:23] that it be of the Lord our God let us
[49:26] send abroad unto our Brethren everywhere
[49:28] that are left in all the land of Israel
[49:30] with them also to the priests and
[49:32] Levites which are in their cities and
[49:34] suburbs that they may gather themselves
[49:36] unto us
[49:38] let us bring again the Ark of our God to
[49:40] us
[49:41] we inquired not at it in the days of
[49:43] Saul
[49:45] and all the congregations said that they
[49:47] would do so
[49:50] for the thing was right in the eyes
[49:52] of all the people and we'll pick that up
[49:55] and read some more here in just a moment
[49:57] amen the Lord has blessing to the word
[49:59] you may be seated
[50:04] got communion tonight don't forget that
[50:06] always a wonderful time and then uh
[50:09] we'll have next Sunday night like to
[50:11] have a youth service for uh young people
[50:13] all of you can show up I expect you to
[50:15] show up if you normally come on on a
[50:17] Sunday night but uh but I want to gear
[50:20] that to the young people if we can and
[50:22] just support them how many appreciate
[50:23] our young people and and the children go
[50:26] ahead that's all right
[50:28] some of you didn't clap because you feel
[50:29] like you're young so
[50:32] but I want to gear that towards them
[50:34] next Sunday night but Joel's going to
[50:36] preach and just be praying about that
[50:38] you know we we every one of us every
[50:40] generation has to have their own Revival
[50:42] and and I felt that really strong on
[50:45] Wednesday nights you know our children
[50:46] need to be saved they need to be born
[50:48] again and and they need to come to
[50:50] Christ and they need to know that
[50:52] there's a fountain open in the House of
[50:53] David for sin and for uncleanness you're
[50:56] going to make mistakes but there is a
[50:59] blood that can cover every sin every
[51:02] mistake every problem you believe that
[51:05] yeah
[51:06] amen
[51:08] amen
[51:10] the ark as we've left it a couple of
[51:12] weeks ago was that courageous jerem for
[51:15] a hundred years
[51:17] and during that time Samuel had come and
[51:20] gone Saul had come and gone and now
[51:22] David was King
[51:25] and the Ark needed to be brought to its
[51:27] place
[51:28] and David understood that he felt the
[51:31] pressure of the hour to bring it to its
[51:34] place but there was a time
[51:36] and a season for that now I want to take
[51:39] all the mystery out of this sermon this
[51:41] morning and and tell you up front that I
[51:43] do not believe that we're living at this
[51:46] time where the ark is shut up somewhere
[51:48] and we have no access to it and we have
[51:51] no ability to uh to look at it I believe
[51:54] we're at the other side of this story
[51:56] when the ark has been restored back to
[51:59] the temple and the and the presence of
[52:01] God moved the pillars and and in
[52:04] Solomon's Temple that is a type of the
[52:06] Bride the the place where we are today I
[52:09] believe that's where we're at I do not
[52:11] believe this is a time of hoping for
[52:14] Revival I I do not believe this is a
[52:16] time of looking for somebody to come
[52:19] along and and give us Revival or a time
[52:22] of looking to some man or some group of
[52:25] men or somebody to get an idea that'll
[52:27] bring Revival I believe this is the
[52:30] bride's Revival I am the Revival for the
[52:33] hour that I live in you are the Revival
[52:35] for the hour that you live in so you
[52:38] know many times we this may be brother
[52:40] branham's sermon on trying to do God of
[52:42] service maybe one of the most
[52:43] misrepresented sermons that there are
[52:45] because what he's preaching about is
[52:48] something that took place during the
[52:50] time he was living and yet and yet
[52:53] people could handle God's word wrong
[52:54] today I understand that but that's not
[52:56] what he's talking about he's talking
[52:58] about a Pentecostal move that wanted
[53:00] Revival but they didn't want to pay for
[53:02] it they wanted Revival but they didn't
[53:04] know what season they were in they
[53:06] wanted Revival but they didn't consult
[53:08] the prophet they wanted Revival they
[53:10] understood a need for Revival but they
[53:12] didn't understand that the ark had to be
[53:15] brought back at the right time by the
[53:16] right person in the right way but I'm
[53:18] here to tell you this morning the ark
[53:21] has been brought back by the right
[53:22] Prophet at the right time in the right
[53:25] place
[53:26] and you and I live in a time of
[53:27] unlimited possibility we live in a time
[53:30] when everything is open and the book has
[53:32] been open and I don't care if it's 10
[53:34] years or 100 years or a thousand years
[53:37] until the coming of the Lord but we live
[53:39] in a time when we can grab a hold of the
[53:41] things of God there's no more delay
[53:43] there's no more looking back at another
[53:46] age you're looking forward to another
[53:47] age this is it
[53:49] or you want Revival this is it are you
[53:53] wanting the power of God this is it
[53:54] we've just got to participate in it
[53:57] we need to be a part of it
[54:01] this is what's coming
[54:03] if not now as we preach here some months
[54:06] ago if not now when
[54:07] if not here where
[54:11] it's not us who
[54:13] yeah
[54:14] somebody's got to do it and it won't be
[54:17] any kind of a it's not a one-man
[54:19] Ministry anymore it was a one-man
[54:21] Ministry and a prophet but this is a
[54:23] bride move
[54:25] we've moved on from that we've moved on
[54:27] from politics we've moved on from those
[54:29] things we've moved on from denominations
[54:32] now there's a time I I'll say this if
[54:35] you Now's the Time To Worship yeah Now's
[54:38] the Time to Now's the Time to praise God
[54:40] Now's the Time to believe for what you
[54:42] have need of Now's the Time to walk in
[54:44] Victory Now's the Time we're not living
[54:46] in a denominational age
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] so I'm not going to preach this this
[54:52] morning to scare you all if I do
[54:54] something wrong I'm going to I'm going
[54:56] to bring the ark back in the wrong way
[54:57] no that's not the point of it at all we
[55:00] want to see where that move that
[55:02] denominational move was mistaken and
[55:05] were they messed up and and true people
[55:07] could do that again today but not if you
[55:10] know where you're at
[55:11] not if you know what you believe
[55:17] so it's a word Revival brother Brandon
[55:18] says not an intellectual Revival or an
[55:20] emotional Revival but a word
[55:22] because it started by the word of a
[55:25] prophet amen right right so so just to
[55:28] get that out of the way now there's a
[55:30] principle in Scripture that obedience is
[55:32] better than sacrifice how many
[55:33] understand that today obedience is
[55:36] better than sacrifice
[55:38] so it's never right to do the right
[55:40] thing the wrong way
[55:43] the end never justifies the means
[55:46] you could be as right as rain about your
[55:49] Doctrine and mistreat people with it
[55:53] the end never justifies the means
[55:56] it is never okay no matter how right you
[55:59] are about what you believe or how right
[56:02] I am about what I believe it is never
[56:04] okay to mistreat people because they see
[56:07] it differently
[56:08] it's not okay to treat people wrong and
[56:11] that goes for all of us church it's not
[56:13] okay somebody's a little bit different
[56:15] or they're new or something like that we
[56:16] were all new one time we were all a bit
[56:19] different one time we were we've all
[56:20] been caught up in sin we've all had a
[56:23] past we've all had things that went on
[56:25] but I'm so glad for the blood of Jesus
[56:26] that covers every sin
[56:28] so it's never right to do the the right
[56:31] thing the wrong way
[56:33] do the right thing the right way
[56:36] hey man it is possible to do it
[56:39] this isn't politics
[56:41] the end does not justify the means
[56:45] right you can't just go in there and say
[56:46] well you never want to see how the
[56:47] sausage sausage is made but you like the
[56:49] the result that's not how the word works
[56:53] right you got to do the right thing the
[56:56] right way
[56:57] at the right time
[56:58] and the thing is we can do that by the
[57:00] help of the Holy Spirit
[57:02] so there's an idea and I've preached it
[57:05] before and you've heard it I'm sure
[57:06] there's a theory called chaos theory
[57:08] that that you know any amount of chaos
[57:12] whenever you have a complex system say
[57:14] like the weather and you introduce any
[57:17] amount of difference in that no matter
[57:19] how small it is at the beginning of it
[57:21] but random describes it in a simple way
[57:23] he said if you have a shotgun or a rifle
[57:25] he said it's not it's not uh just
[57:28] exactly right he said you may start off
[57:30] just a little bit wrong when it gets to
[57:31] the end it's that far off
[57:33] and the reason is because of Chaos
[57:35] Theory Chaos Theory means that uh it's
[57:38] the butterfly effect if a butterfly
[57:40] flaps its wings in South America it
[57:43] might result because of of what it does
[57:46] to something and it does to something
[57:47] and it does to something it might result
[57:48] in a typhoon in the Pacific
[57:51] right because everything matters yes
[57:55] and so I know some of you now you're
[57:57] going to be thinking about that the rest
[57:58] of the sermon and
[58:00] but it's true everything matters and
[58:02] that's why no matter how legalistic you
[58:04] are you can never govern your life to
[58:07] the point of well I'm just going to do
[58:09] every little thing right and then I'll
[58:11] be okay you can't do that you don't even
[58:13] know what right is
[58:14] but those that what those who are the
[58:16] sons of God they were led by the spirit
[58:19] of God
[58:20] and he's the only one who can do that
[58:22] because he knows you're tomorrows he
[58:24] knows why that the thing happened the
[58:25] way it did he knows why you lost your
[58:27] job he knows why you lost your loved one
[58:29] he knows why you went through what you
[58:31] went through because any little thing
[58:32] down here might have affected something
[58:34] up there so he said he said we know that
[58:36] all things someone say all things all
[58:39] things work together for the good to
[58:41] them who are called the called of Jesus
[58:43] Christ then they love God so we know
[58:46] that whatever he does is good
[58:50] I want to talk to you about that tonight
[58:51] maybe before communion whatever God does
[58:53] is good we got to trust him in that
[58:57] so but but there's there's an idea that
[59:00] little things matter they do matter
[59:03] little things matter sometimes just just
[59:06] the fact that you come to church or or
[59:09] that your attitude in church it matters
[59:11] to the whole service
[59:12] talks about a child running around the
[59:14] sanctuary one service
[59:16] and how it would have an effect on the
[59:18] next service
[59:19] every little thing matters Benjamin
[59:21] Franklin put it this way he said for
[59:22] want of a nail the shoe was lost
[59:25] for one of a shoe the horse was lost for
[59:28] one of a of a rider the battle was lost
[59:31] for one of the battle the kingdom was
[59:33] lost and offered one of a horseshoe nail
[59:38] so the little things matter the Bible
[59:40] said the little foxes spoil the vine
[59:42] so in good intentions are not enough we
[59:45] need to do things according to the word
[59:46] right
[59:47] so David's intentions were good when he
[59:50] wanted to bring the ark back he was
[59:52] right
[59:53] that the ark needed to be restored
[59:56] he was right about about wanting to go
[59:59] get it he was right even to call a
[1:00:01] meeting
[1:00:02] that's not what David did wrong but God
[1:00:04] does not brother said God does not give
[1:00:06] us merits on Good Intentions there's
[1:00:09] only one way to serve God that's by
[1:00:11] doing his will his command and God being
[1:00:14] Sovereign there's no one to tell him
[1:00:16] what to do or how to do it he does it
[1:00:19] the way he knows the right way to do it
[1:00:22] but one great thing about God aren't you
[1:00:24] glad for a great God he has not left us
[1:00:26] he said without knowing what's the truth
[1:00:28] and how to do it
[1:00:30] Hallelujah he doesn't punish us without
[1:00:32] telling us what to do right right he
[1:00:35] always gets a warning before judgment
[1:00:36] he's a God that speaks the word and
[1:00:39] expects his children to believe it and
[1:00:42] therefore he knows what's best and when
[1:00:43] to do it and how to do it he said we
[1:00:46] have our ideas of it but he knows
[1:00:49] so we should always examine what we're
[1:00:51] doing no matter what it is no matter how
[1:00:54] little it is by the word
[1:00:56] and when I'm when I'm talking about that
[1:00:58] just take the scriptures and then take
[1:01:00] the light on the scriptures which is the
[1:01:02] message of the hour and see if what
[1:01:03] you're doing matches up
[1:01:05] and if you don't understand it or you
[1:01:07] you can't search it out go and ask your
[1:01:10] pastor or ask a a minister about that I
[1:01:13] appreciate you asking questions but then
[1:01:15] if you still don't understand begin to
[1:01:17] seek the Lord ask him to reveal it to
[1:01:19] you
[1:01:21] because many times though it's not the
[1:01:23] things we don't understand that gives us
[1:01:25] problems it's the things we do yeah and
[1:01:27] I found a lot of times people are
[1:01:29] looking for a way out of the word
[1:01:31] and so that's why they uh they question
[1:01:34] something it's not because they don't
[1:01:35] don't understand it sometimes and
[1:01:38] sometimes we do have sincere questions
[1:01:39] but other times it's just we really
[1:01:42] would like for God to make an exception
[1:01:44] yeah
[1:01:46] now come on you're human you've been
[1:01:48] there
[1:01:49] would be really nice Lord if you make an
[1:01:52] exception in my case
[1:01:54] but the word is to the word and I've
[1:01:55] always told people this you're going to
[1:01:57] mess up you're going to do things
[1:01:58] sometimes that are stupid because human
[1:02:01] beings have a stupid element to them
[1:02:04] that's just the way it is you're going
[1:02:06] to be stupid sometimes but but just but
[1:02:09] just acknowledge that the word is true
[1:02:12] the word is true no matter what I do no
[1:02:14] matter what you do no matter what
[1:02:15] somebody else does the word is Right 100
[1:02:18] times out of a hundred
[1:02:20] so you acknowledge the word is true and
[1:02:22] and surrender your life to that word and
[1:02:24] move on
[1:02:25] so there don't try to justify what you
[1:02:28] do now just because something is a
[1:02:30] religious Act
[1:02:32] does not mean that the Lord is in it
[1:02:34] right
[1:02:35] right and we see many people having
[1:02:37] religious acts today just because it's a
[1:02:39] religious act doesn't mean God is in it
[1:02:41] you say well brother so-and-so said we
[1:02:43] should worship this way well that don't
[1:02:45] mean God's in it right it may be a
[1:02:47] religious act but that don't mean God's
[1:02:48] in it well well the Baptists go to
[1:02:51] church the Methodist and I'm I've got no
[1:02:52] problem with that with those people
[1:02:53] there's Godly sincere people uh in those
[1:02:56] groups but but they're under a system
[1:02:58] just because they're religious don't
[1:03:00] make them right
[1:03:02] like my grandpa always said this he said
[1:03:04] he said we can't all be right but we
[1:03:06] could all be wrong
[1:03:07] but somebody's got to be right
[1:03:10] somebody's got to be right so there's
[1:03:12] got to be something that you stand on
[1:03:14] something you can grab a hold of
[1:03:16] something that's true yes so now so how
[1:03:19] do we know if what we're doing is is
[1:03:21] thus saith the Lord if it's according to
[1:03:23] the word but the Bible said there were
[1:03:24] five musts
[1:03:27] that get give us uh tell us whether it's
[1:03:29] the word whether it's the will of God or
[1:03:31] not five musts
[1:03:34] now this is what he said he said it must
[1:03:35] be his time
[1:03:37] it must be his season so it must be his
[1:03:40] time must be at the right time it must
[1:03:42] be a season he talks about it can't be
[1:03:44] like Noah's gospel yeah right it's got
[1:03:46] to be the in today's light yeah the
[1:03:49] light of the hour
[1:03:50] he said it must be the man he chose so
[1:03:53] just because something is timely just
[1:03:55] because something is in the right season
[1:03:57] doesn't mean that you're the one to do
[1:03:59] it
[1:04:00] yeah right or I'm the one to do it so
[1:04:03] there's always got to be an element of
[1:04:04] it you've got to be the one that was
[1:04:05] chosen to do it you say how will I know
[1:04:07] that and I keep going back to this
[1:04:09] brother Brandon said one way you know
[1:04:10] that you have a gift to see if you can
[1:04:11] do it or not all right
[1:04:13] all right don't don't kick against the
[1:04:15] Pricks if it's something you you're
[1:04:17] obviously not good at and and it's not a
[1:04:19] blessing to the bride you'll probably
[1:04:21] shouldn't be doing it
[1:04:22] I know that's too simple for some people
[1:04:24] but many times that's that's the way it
[1:04:26] is
[1:04:27] you gotta be the man for the job but the
[1:04:29] woman for the job in a job that a woman
[1:04:31] can do it must be a prophet now whatever
[1:04:35] Brandon is saying here he's saying that
[1:04:37] a prophet it's got to come to a prophet
[1:04:40] the idea had to come to a prophet
[1:04:43] right we have church order the way we do
[1:04:45] because of a prophet
[1:04:47] right we we have uh we have all our
[1:04:50] services everything's ordered the way it
[1:04:51] is because it comes from the scripture a
[1:04:53] prophet preached the word but a prophet
[1:04:55] said it in order yeah
[1:04:57] so we do those things because of profit
[1:04:59] so the idea for this revival had to come
[1:05:02] from a prophet yeah I'll go a little bit
[1:05:04] farther the announcement of this revival
[1:05:07] had to come from a Prophet come on hey
[1:05:10] man he had to announce that it was
[1:05:13] coming and that it was on now and
[1:05:15] finally the prophet must be Vindicated
[1:05:17] so it can't be just anybody that sees
[1:05:19] Visions yeah because he said your old
[1:05:21] men shall dream dreams your young men
[1:05:22] will see Visions yeah right we believe
[1:05:25] that there will be people who see
[1:05:27] Visions but they're not that Prophet
[1:05:28] right
[1:05:29] right there will be people who have true
[1:05:31] prophecy but they're not that prophet
[1:05:34] right so the idea for this revival must
[1:05:37] come through not just any Prophet but a
[1:05:39] Vindicated Prophet if you go back and
[1:05:41] study it but the brown said a Vindicated
[1:05:43] Prophet is a prophet to the age
[1:05:45] right someone say that with me a prophet
[1:05:47] to the age
[1:05:48] right what is that I mean there's only
[1:05:51] five stars in his hand right five
[1:05:54] Messengers that's it they're not six
[1:05:57] there's not or seven rather I said five
[1:05:59] they're seven
[1:06:00] some of y'all Said Amen to that
[1:06:03] I'm not one of those
[1:06:05] there's seven Messengers right
[1:06:08] I wasn't trying to trick you I messed up
[1:06:10] there's seven messages in his hand right
[1:06:12] yeah so there's not eight there's not
[1:06:14] six
[1:06:16] let's see if you pay attention now
[1:06:19] there's not 12.
[1:06:21] they're seven yeah Seven Stars one for
[1:06:23] each Church age and the seventh was the
[1:06:26] last one and he was the one who was
[1:06:27] revealed the mystery to the age
[1:06:29] so it's not just a prophet not just any
[1:06:32] Prophet but a Vindicated Prophet are you
[1:06:34] with me so far
[1:06:36] now David had some of these things
[1:06:39] but not all of them right
[1:06:42] right so you find that
[1:06:44] in first Chronicles 13 15 David gathered
[1:06:46] all Israel together
[1:06:48] from shy of Egypt even into the
[1:06:50] entering of emath to bring the Ark of
[1:06:52] God from kurdisturium now again it
[1:06:55] wasn't wrong to bring the people
[1:06:56] together
[1:06:57] but why is he bringing the people
[1:06:59] together what time are they coming
[1:07:01] together and did it begin with the
[1:07:03] Vindicated prophet
[1:07:05] verse 6 and David went up in all Israel
[1:07:07] to Baylor it is to courage of cheer him
[1:07:09] which belonged to Judah to bring up then
[1:07:11] it's the Ark of the Lord that dwelleth
[1:07:13] between the cherubims whose name is
[1:07:14] called on it and they carry the Ark of
[1:07:16] God in a new car oh my
[1:07:19] yeah out of that remember They carried
[1:07:20] it on a new card out of the land of
[1:07:21] Philistines nothing bad happened
[1:07:24] right so now they're doing it again a
[1:07:27] new car well that's the way it came up
[1:07:28] so it came back to us so it must be
[1:07:30] right the denominations come brought so
[1:07:33] much light they did things a certain way
[1:07:35] it must be right but it's not right
[1:07:37] today because we know better
[1:07:39] right so so now they they come up with a
[1:07:42] new card and and uh and he carried the
[1:07:46] Ark of God and USA in Ohio Draves the
[1:07:48] cart and David and all Israel played
[1:07:51] before God with all their might with
[1:07:52] singing with Harps with sulturies with
[1:07:54] Timbers with symbols and with trumpets
[1:07:58] must have been some service
[1:08:00] and when they come to the threshing
[1:08:02] floor of chadon USA put forth his hand
[1:08:05] to hold the ark
[1:08:07] he didn't have bad intentions he was
[1:08:09] just caught up in a system that had gone
[1:08:11] wrong
[1:08:13] right and for the auction stumble and
[1:08:16] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:08:18] against us and he smote him because he
[1:08:21] put his hand to the ark and there he
[1:08:22] died before God and David was displeased
[1:08:25] because the Lord had made a breach of an
[1:08:27] uza wherefore that place is called Perez
[1:08:30] USA to this day and so with their
[1:08:33] attempt to bring the ark remember they
[1:08:35] had to take it back and leave it in
[1:08:36] somebody's house and Lord will get to
[1:08:38] that and finish this up next week
[1:08:40] but he he they took it back and put it
[1:08:43] in someone's house and they said we
[1:08:45] can't handle the word it it just not
[1:08:47] we're not able to yet I'm so glad we
[1:08:49] don't live in that day
[1:08:51] I'm so glad we don't live in the day
[1:08:53] when the word cannot be opened to us but
[1:08:55] I'm glad that the word has come and we
[1:08:57] live in the time we can inquire of God
[1:08:59] and we can receive from God
[1:09:02] so wonderful now what went wrong
[1:09:06] brother Brandon said there were three
[1:09:07] things that went wrong
[1:09:09] three things he said they'd already done
[1:09:12] one thing wrong two things wrong he said
[1:09:13] first they never consulted Nathan
[1:09:16] right so remember they consulted all the
[1:09:18] leaders but there's no mention they
[1:09:19] consulted the prophet right right
[1:09:21] Prophet Nathan was the prophet during
[1:09:22] that time
[1:09:24] he said the next thing they did they
[1:09:25] went down there by not Consulting the
[1:09:27] word of God where Samuel was the word in
[1:09:29] that day never consulted the word of the
[1:09:31] Lord when they did they went contrary to
[1:09:32] the word of God so that's they built a
[1:09:34] new art new cart right
[1:09:36] so he said here this good man that had
[1:09:39] been a caretaker he was a bishop
[1:09:41] thought well here I don't want God to be
[1:09:44] let down
[1:09:45] so he put his hand on the ark
[1:09:48] where he wasn't a levite and he died
[1:09:52] three things he says
[1:09:54] so let's let's put it just in another
[1:09:56] way so you'll catch it this morning
[1:09:58] Nathan wasn't consulted
[1:10:01] the ark was carried on a new cart
[1:10:04] and uza put his hands
[1:10:06] on the ark
[1:10:08] now
[1:10:10] brother random said God revealed the
[1:10:11] thing to them by David and by the
[1:10:13] ministers and by the people and by the
[1:10:15] captains of thousands and captains of
[1:10:17] hundreds but not by Nathan who had thus
[1:10:20] saith the Lord
[1:10:22] so whenever somebody comes to you and
[1:10:23] said this is what you should be doing
[1:10:25] this is the move of God this is what we
[1:10:27] should be doing as a church we need to
[1:10:29] go and find out if if it was the prophet
[1:10:33] that said it we need to find out have
[1:10:35] you consulted the message of the hour
[1:10:38] is this something that a prophet taught
[1:10:41] is it plain simple teaching is it what a
[1:10:44] prophet said yeah
[1:10:45] yeah see because and that's where people
[1:10:47] get all down through history of this
[1:10:49] message we can say history and how it's
[1:10:51] been uh maybe 60 years since this
[1:10:54] message came along and its strength and
[1:10:56] its fullness and and here come uh here
[1:10:59] come one move after another after
[1:11:01] another and once they had this
[1:11:02] Revelation and that one and they said go
[1:11:04] here and go there but remember that's
[1:11:06] exactly what Jesus said to watch for he
[1:11:09] said they'll say here is Christ the
[1:11:10] anointing here is Christ the anointing
[1:11:12] he said don't follow them yeah right one
[1:11:15] after another after another they had one
[1:11:17] idea after another after another but I'm
[1:11:19] not following an idea I'm following the
[1:11:21] word of God yes sir
[1:11:24] so they had one Revival after another
[1:11:26] after another one thing after another
[1:11:28] after another but there is a Revival for
[1:11:30] me there is a Revival for us we are
[1:11:33] living in a time of the return of the
[1:11:35] Ark
[1:11:36] when the arc has returned there is a
[1:11:38] Revival but it's not the Revival that
[1:11:40] men taught us yeah but it's one that
[1:11:42] Nathan the Prophet The Prophet to the
[1:11:45] age the Vindicated Prophet said would be
[1:11:48] so they they consulted everybody else
[1:11:50] but him
[1:11:51] yeah and the Lord said he would do
[1:11:53] nothing until he showed the prophet of
[1:11:55] the age
[1:11:56] what'd he say the Lord God will do
[1:11:58] nothing surely the Lord God will do
[1:12:00] nothing except to revealth his secret to
[1:12:02] his servants the prophets Amos 3 7.
[1:12:04] so he would do nothing except he showed
[1:12:07] the prophet of the age first what to do
[1:12:09] yeah you see what they did they went
[1:12:10] straight out of the word of God went and
[1:12:11] put the ark upon a new car so they went
[1:12:13] about to do it apart from God's
[1:12:15] commandment and God's provided way
[1:12:18] and again I don't
[1:12:20] many times
[1:12:22] this message
[1:12:23] in particular this uh this part of the
[1:12:26] message is sermon brother Branham
[1:12:28] preaches is used to scare people into
[1:12:30] doing nothing yeah
[1:12:32] well you should never have me she should
[1:12:34] never go to me you really need to just
[1:12:36] sit home and listen to your pastor uh
[1:12:38] you know I'll say this if all the
[1:12:41] preaching you ever heard was me you
[1:12:43] would not come into maturity as a bride
[1:12:46] do you know that
[1:12:48] if I'm all the preaching you ever heard
[1:12:50] you would not
[1:12:52] come into maturity as a bride how do you
[1:12:54] know that brother Ben because the Bible
[1:12:55] says that they'll come into maturity
[1:12:58] until we all come in the unity of the
[1:12:59] faith there would be five distinct
[1:13:01] Ministries we don't even have five
[1:13:03] preachers in the church
[1:13:07] so if all you ever feed on is this
[1:13:09] church
[1:13:10] boy it got quiet
[1:13:13] so I have no problem with you feeding on
[1:13:15] whatever you can get fed yeah but first
[1:13:18] we ought to feed where God has placed us
[1:13:20] because God has something to say right
[1:13:23] to us see he loves us so much he got
[1:13:25] something to say to me he's got
[1:13:27] something to say to you and this is
[1:13:28] where he wants to say it but he got
[1:13:30] something to say but there will be
[1:13:31] evangelists and and Prophets and and
[1:13:34] teachers he said how can you say that
[1:13:35] because he said there would be
[1:13:38] there would be inspired preaching there
[1:13:40] would be all of those things that would
[1:13:42] come and then preach to you and that's
[1:13:43] why we try to have other preachers and
[1:13:45] other ministers and I say take advantage
[1:13:47] if anybody's preaching the truth go go
[1:13:50] go listen to it
[1:13:53] I have no problem with that
[1:13:54] just make sure you know what what
[1:13:56] direction the church is headed and and
[1:13:58] where you're at because God provides so
[1:14:01] so simply for us but you can't just
[1:14:03] listen to me this is not I am not the
[1:14:05] pastor to the world yeah
[1:14:08] or the pastor to the age as brother
[1:14:10] Branham put it
[1:14:11] yeah that's not I'm not
[1:14:13] God had a prophet
[1:14:15] I'll say this we need to be getting in
[1:14:16] that message
[1:14:20] but but again
[1:14:22] you can receive from all the fivefold
[1:14:24] ministry I believe God's got them today
[1:14:25] do you believe that happened
[1:14:27] and he said well brother Ben they got a
[1:14:29] bit different idea than you do they
[1:14:30] could be right
[1:14:36] I'm not the end of all knowledge
[1:14:39] I just said he had five stars in his
[1:14:41] right hand I mean
[1:14:45] are you with me now I'm not trying to
[1:14:47] disparage myself or make you think less
[1:14:49] of me but you can't think less of me
[1:14:51] than I do so
[1:14:54] be all right someone said somebody
[1:14:56] talking about you and the man said well
[1:14:58] that's all right he said they couldn't
[1:14:59] they couldn't say what if they knew what
[1:15:01] I knew you know
[1:15:04] didn't say nothing about me it's worse
[1:15:05] than what I knew I was a sinner yeah
[1:15:07] but I come to Christ
[1:15:11] so uh you know I don't always have the
[1:15:13] right idea but we try to stay as close
[1:15:15] to the word as we can but the bear said
[1:15:17] about baptizing babies he said let them
[1:15:19] do that if they want to but we want to
[1:15:21] try to stay as close to the Bible as we
[1:15:22] can
[1:15:23] it's closer that's what my desire is let
[1:15:25] me say it's close to the word of God as
[1:15:27] I can
[1:15:28] amen so there may be things I'm not
[1:15:30] telling you I would preach an error I
[1:15:32] don't believe I would I believe God will
[1:15:33] protect us here I believe he'll keep us
[1:15:35] but I believe he keeps other people too
[1:15:37] and and there's others that you can you
[1:15:39] can feed on and you can be a part of
[1:15:41] that but but remember God God made us a
[1:15:44] body it's not a one-man move right
[1:15:46] it's a body I'm getting way off my notes
[1:15:50] here but we have Trustees for a reason
[1:15:53] and trustees do their job I don't even
[1:15:55] have to know about it
[1:15:58] I know that sounds but really I mean
[1:16:00] especially minor things like that if
[1:16:02] it's a big thing that's going to cost a
[1:16:03] lot of money the whole church ought to
[1:16:05] decided we have Trustees for a reason we
[1:16:07] have beacons for a reason
[1:16:09] and if the deacons decide they want to
[1:16:10] uh they need to do something and and
[1:16:13] I'll be glad I'd be happy if they'd
[1:16:15] inform me about it before they do it so
[1:16:17] I would know what's coming but if they
[1:16:19] decide to do something that's up to them
[1:16:20] they have a job that I don't have
[1:16:23] the deacons have a job the trustees have
[1:16:25] a job the song leaders have a job I've
[1:16:27] got a job
[1:16:28] stay right here with the word but so do
[1:16:30] you every one of you has a job in the
[1:16:32] church every one of you belong in the
[1:16:34] house of God if God has put you here
[1:16:36] you've got something to do you matter in
[1:16:39] the house of God it matters that you
[1:16:41] show up in the house of God it matters
[1:16:43] that we see your face it means something
[1:16:46] yeah God cares I care the people care if
[1:16:50] you show up and you know if we care and
[1:16:52] we ought to and I want to commend you
[1:16:54] I've gotten so many testimonies of
[1:16:56] people say oh the church is so friendly
[1:16:57] let's keep that up Church let's keep
[1:17:00] doing that let's be as friendly as we
[1:17:02] can be let's talk to people you don't
[1:17:04] know that might be the last seed of God
[1:17:06] that might be the last one and it might
[1:17:08] be because you're reading them at the
[1:17:09] door that they have the right attitude
[1:17:11] to come to church
[1:17:13] right never get cultish and clenished
[1:17:17] remember the Antichrist Spirit started
[1:17:18] with a click in the church
[1:17:20] should never do that right
[1:17:22] well we need to be together we're a body
[1:17:24] yeah yeah so Brandon that says this
[1:17:26] because and my point in all of this is
[1:17:29] to say that
[1:17:31] that this message is used to scare
[1:17:34] people
[1:17:35] but that's not what I want to do at all
[1:17:38] I want to I want you to do things for
[1:17:40] God
[1:17:41] I want you to live for God I want you to
[1:17:43] be happy I want you I want us to have
[1:17:45] meetings I want us to I want to do
[1:17:46] everything we can for God I'm trying to
[1:17:49] explain myself on putting these services
[1:17:50] on the internet I don't do that because
[1:17:52] I think I'm the world's pastor we do
[1:17:54] that because if I can help one person if
[1:17:56] this church could help one person by
[1:17:58] being wide open on the internet then
[1:18:00] we'll do it right I just I don't have
[1:18:02] enough Hubris in me to say that I can be
[1:18:05] everybody's Pastor I can't be
[1:18:07] and this can't be everybody's church but
[1:18:10] God is called somebody to listen
[1:18:13] so we'll just be as open about it as
[1:18:14] what we can be
[1:18:16] yeah so but I don't I want you to do I
[1:18:19] want you to serve god without fear yeah
[1:18:22] and but know where you're at no that
[1:18:24] you're serving him under the word of the
[1:18:25] hour no the ark has been restored
[1:18:28] stay with the message
[1:18:31] sober the random one time is having an
[1:18:33] altar call and he says this he said
[1:18:35] listen friends he said I know they say
[1:18:36] Pentecost they organize Pentecost he
[1:18:38] said that's wrong
[1:18:39] Pentecost is an experience
[1:18:42] the Methodist get it the Baptist get it
[1:18:44] all then get it Pentecost is not
[1:18:46] organized it's an experience he said if
[1:18:48] you haven't had the experience of
[1:18:50] Pentecost come receive it now
[1:18:52] he said remember if you believe me to be
[1:18:53] a servant as Prophet remember there is a
[1:18:56] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:18:58] in the midst of all the fanaticism there
[1:19:00] is still a genuine Holy Ghost there is a
[1:19:03] genuine life do you believe that today
[1:19:05] he said you come believe it right now he
[1:19:07] said oh that must be early in his
[1:19:08] ministry 1964.
[1:19:12] making an altar call Brother Branham how
[1:19:14] could you
[1:19:16] being a little sarcastic there
[1:19:19] in case you're a person who doesn't
[1:19:20] doesn't understand sarcasm easily I try
[1:19:23] not to be sarcastic in the Pulpit for
[1:19:25] that reason because I don't always get
[1:19:27] sarcasm
[1:19:28] now look brother said if there's someone
[1:19:30] sitting here that's never had to be that
[1:19:32] beginning Spirit experience
[1:19:35] You Gotta Have It brother Brandon taught
[1:19:36] us the Holy Ghost was not just an idea
[1:19:39] or an assimilation or just you become it
[1:19:42] you got to have an experience with God
[1:19:45] and so he said if there's someone here
[1:19:46] that's never had that beginning Spirit
[1:19:48] experience got that same spirit that
[1:19:51] poured out in the beginning why should
[1:19:52] we take a substitute why should we take
[1:19:55] something fanaticism why should we take
[1:19:57] some radical cold formal indifferent
[1:19:59] Creed when the Pentecostal skies are
[1:20:02] full of the real genuine article why
[1:20:04] take a substitute he said Lord he's
[1:20:06] praying he said let's go back to the
[1:20:08] beginning and receive it like they did
[1:20:10] at the beginning and had the same work
[1:20:11] signs Wonders that there's the same
[1:20:14] fruit
[1:20:15] love joy peace long-suffering goodness
[1:20:17] meekness gentleness patience let's
[1:20:19] preach all of it let's have all of it
[1:20:22] let's believe all of it I'm I'm out for
[1:20:25] a church that's got the signs in it and
[1:20:27] it gets in it but I want a church got
[1:20:28] love in it Church got gentleness in the
[1:20:30] church got peace in it I want to see us
[1:20:32] bearing the Fruit of the Spirit
[1:20:34] let's do it all
[1:20:37] I refuse to take someone's false choice
[1:20:40] yeah to your wife you if you believe the
[1:20:42] word you can't have any emotion nonsense
[1:20:46] not what a prophet taught
[1:20:49] right right how they work again they
[1:20:51] were not wrong to have a meeting
[1:20:54] you can't show me in the message where
[1:20:55] brother Brown said they were wrong to
[1:20:56] have a meeting
[1:20:57] and we're not wrong to be emotional
[1:21:00] how do you know that brother Ben because
[1:21:02] when they brought the ark back they did
[1:21:04] it in the same way yeah they called all
[1:21:07] the singers back together and had the
[1:21:08] same meeting but this time under the
[1:21:10] direction of the word
[1:21:11] [Music]
[1:21:14] no they they were not wrong to dance
[1:21:18] because David danced before the Lord
[1:21:20] with all his might Michael criticized
[1:21:22] him and and she lost her ability to have
[1:21:25] children because she criticized that
[1:21:27] so so we don't want to do that we don't
[1:21:29] want to be a non-bearing church I'm not
[1:21:31] talking about an accident almost
[1:21:32] spiritually
[1:21:33] so they were not wrong to dance or to
[1:21:36] have music
[1:21:37] so but you know
[1:21:40] I think the problem begins with not
[1:21:42] Consulting a profit because many people
[1:21:45] I found many folks are not really
[1:21:47] concerned about not Consulting brother
[1:21:49] Branham
[1:21:50] they're concerned because nobody
[1:21:51] consulted them
[1:21:56] it wasn't their idea
[1:21:59] you let it be the pastor's idea or The
[1:22:01] Bishop's idea or the Evangelist idea boy
[1:22:03] it's all good yeah yeah right but
[1:22:04] because it wasn't their idea and they
[1:22:07] said well it must be wrong
[1:22:08] I'll say this you worship God how you
[1:22:10] feel to worship God
[1:22:12] I Don't Dance much because number one I
[1:22:16] don't want to cause any earthquakes
[1:22:19] I'm standing in their church and brother
[1:22:21] uh brother Ben I think they're
[1:22:24] I don't want to reveal any secrets but I
[1:22:25] think they've been in plans anyway they
[1:22:27] may build a new Sanctuary but the old
[1:22:29] sanctuaries got a wooden floor it's up
[1:22:30] on it's not concrete like this I'm glad
[1:22:32] ours is concrete but they got a wooden
[1:22:35] floor and I stood up there and realized
[1:22:37] you know they had a name for me in the
[1:22:39] meeting because there's two bins so they
[1:22:41] called Ben beard younger Ben and me
[1:22:43] Elder Ben because he's he's two years
[1:22:46] younger than me
[1:22:49] and I got to preaching I think it was
[1:22:50] Saturday morning and I got or Sunday
[1:22:52] morning I got winded and I said you know
[1:22:54] I said it shouldn't been the name
[1:22:57] shouldn't have been uh Elder Ben should
[1:22:58] have been Big Ben
[1:23:01] and and I really did you know if I had
[1:23:03] fallen because because I got to
[1:23:05] preaching you know and I got kind of
[1:23:07] weak and I thought well if I fail I'm
[1:23:09] gonna I'm gonna break through this floor
[1:23:11] and we found out later the floor may
[1:23:13] have had some problems
[1:23:16] I heard a pop what
[1:23:20] brother Harvey come to me said brother
[1:23:21] Ben you're probably be the last preacher
[1:23:23] to preach on this floor
[1:23:30] but
[1:23:31] Where'd I started with that
[1:23:36] Joe's lost
[1:23:38] that's he's always lost so don't matter
[1:23:42] I found again people are not worried
[1:23:44] about Consulting a profit they're
[1:23:45] worried about Consulting them I believe
[1:23:47] in the dance
[1:23:49] that's where I was going I believe in a
[1:23:50] dance
[1:23:51] but if I do much dancing you might not
[1:23:53] have a floor left
[1:23:55] because this is wood
[1:23:57] up here
[1:23:58] but but I'll say this not everybody's a
[1:24:01] dancer yeah yeah but there's times I
[1:24:03] feel like an old dinosaur and I just
[1:24:04] want to sit at the back and I'll be
[1:24:06] honest with you and let the young people
[1:24:08] take it there's times I feel that way
[1:24:10] but also know that there's a real power
[1:24:12] of God and there's a real presence of
[1:24:14] God and again as I said earlier I don't
[1:24:17] I want to be like Moses and say Lord if
[1:24:19] your presence is not with us then then I
[1:24:22] will not want to go I don't want to go a
[1:24:24] service without the presence of the Lord
[1:24:26] I don't want to go a time of gathering
[1:24:28] together without the sweet influence of
[1:24:30] the Holy Spirit
[1:24:32] I want him to be present not just in our
[1:24:34] services but in our homes
[1:24:36] it's your home just become a place where
[1:24:38] it's a dead dry confession where you
[1:24:40] pray over your food and you pray with
[1:24:42] the kids but there's no there's no
[1:24:44] feeling in it then we need to get back
[1:24:46] to what really that's good that you do
[1:24:47] it but you need to get back to where
[1:24:49] there's a feeling in it where there's
[1:24:50] something inside of you it may not be a
[1:24:52] big dance or a big show but there needs
[1:24:54] to be a reality to it
[1:24:57] all right
[1:24:59] I've told you before you know we want
[1:25:02] our young ones to come to an altar and
[1:25:03] we do yeah we want them to serve God we
[1:25:06] do but maybe it ought to start with us
[1:25:08] maybe we ought to be the ones coming to
[1:25:10] the altar many people we ought to be the
[1:25:12] one seeking God for our children we I
[1:25:14] will say this I refuse to lose this
[1:25:16] generation I refuse to get so busy that
[1:25:19] this generation passes on and they go
[1:25:21] out in the world again I say it's time
[1:25:24] we took advantage of the word that we
[1:25:25] have and lived for God and do what God
[1:25:28] says keep our children
[1:25:31] say you can't do it I absolutely believe
[1:25:33] you can
[1:25:36] there may be some leave they'll come
[1:25:38] back yeah
[1:25:39] yeah because we there's a power here
[1:25:41] yeah but I believe there's a power to
[1:25:43] keep them yeah
[1:25:45] these young men dressed in suits and
[1:25:47] ties right here in the front I tell you
[1:25:49] what we got four people four kids where
[1:25:52] we're raising a new generation in this
[1:25:54] church I'll tell you what
[1:25:55] I got four young men on the front row
[1:25:57] we're wearing suits and ties I tell you
[1:25:59] what keep it up boys keep it up it's not
[1:26:02] just how you dress but it's how you
[1:26:03] approach God
[1:26:06] I don't want to lose one of them I don't
[1:26:08] want to see one of them go out and
[1:26:09] experience even what I experienced and
[1:26:11] even though I was mostly in church and
[1:26:13] to live for God I don't want him even to
[1:26:15] have my scars I don't want them to have
[1:26:17] some of the scars you all have you ever
[1:26:18] are you with me now I want to see them
[1:26:20] live for God with all of their heart I
[1:26:22] want to see them and seek the Lord with
[1:26:23] all their heart
[1:26:25] I know sometimes you think that that
[1:26:27] we're tough and rough and and we just we
[1:26:30] got rules and things like that that's
[1:26:32] not what
[1:26:33] that's not about do's and don'ts yeah
[1:26:36] but it's about we're trying to protect
[1:26:38] you I want to see you be able to worship
[1:26:40] God and have no memory of those things
[1:26:42] that that come back and try to keep your
[1:26:44] hands down and try to keep you from from
[1:26:46] doing what God said I want to see you be
[1:26:48] able to Worship in Freedom
[1:26:51] love God with all of your heart
[1:26:55] I don't want to repeat the mistakes in
[1:26:57] my past
[1:26:59] I hope you forgive me this morning I
[1:27:02] I guess I got comfortable got way off my
[1:27:04] nose but I don't want to repeat I don't
[1:27:06] want to repeat my dad's mistakes
[1:27:08] I don't want to make it a law I don't
[1:27:10] want to make it a that's something where
[1:27:11] I beat my kids into submission and and
[1:27:13] then they're always just trembling in
[1:27:15] fear and and learn how to be good
[1:27:17] Hypocrites I don't want that I want
[1:27:19] something real I want something I want
[1:27:21] my kids to know there's a home to come
[1:27:23] back to there's a power of God to live
[1:27:25] there's something that can keep you in
[1:27:26] this world whether you go to private
[1:27:28] school or public school or home school
[1:27:30] there's still a God who can keep you
[1:27:43] all right breaks down good
[1:27:46] y'all just pulling too hard
[1:27:49] I'm not gonna get to this but
[1:27:51] bogus dollar only proves there's
[1:27:53] something real right
[1:27:56] we don't have to just because David made
[1:27:58] a mistake but it'll keep us from having
[1:28:01] meetings right
[1:28:02] don't keep us from rejoicing worshiping
[1:28:04] God yeah just a scarecrow yes because it
[1:28:07] proves there's something real let's have
[1:28:09] the real
[1:28:10] thank you Lord
[1:28:12] these discernments visions brother Brown
[1:28:15] said we have plenty of impersonations we
[1:28:17] always but remember before there could
[1:28:19] be a bogus dollar there has to be a real
[1:28:21] dollar first
[1:28:22] there has to be a real dollar then
[1:28:23] they're they're made off of that it's
[1:28:25] like we had a real Moses and a real
[1:28:27] Heron we had a jamberson Janice after
[1:28:29] them he said you see how it all comes
[1:28:31] they see it and then they try to
[1:28:32] impersonate that when there's truly one
[1:28:34] original
[1:28:36] and I'll say this if someone has a gift
[1:28:38] I wouldn't fight that I just watch and
[1:28:40] see what it produces
[1:28:42] well it produced it could be a real gift
[1:28:44] that people use in a wrong way but thus
[1:28:46] saith the Lord came in our age to a
[1:28:48] prophet to the eagle of the age and
[1:28:50] under that anointing every one of us
[1:28:52] have thus saith the Lord not because
[1:28:54] we're prophets but because we have a
[1:28:56] prophet's message
[1:28:58] the brainer said there are spirits of
[1:28:59] the gifts that's in the church but the
[1:29:01] only person that has a right to say thus
[1:29:02] saith the Lord is a Vindicated problem
[1:29:05] everything else is to be judged before
[1:29:07] it presented to the church
[1:29:09] the bride has thus saith the Lord or she
[1:29:12] keeps still what is this saith the Lord
[1:29:13] the message of the hour
[1:29:16] is that all right yeah
[1:29:17] there's only one Messenger to this age
[1:29:20] brother Branham I don't have time to get
[1:29:22] into all this but brother Branham talks
[1:29:24] about how and this this meant a lot to
[1:29:26] me he said there'd be I don't deny
[1:29:27] there'll be people like agabus and
[1:29:29] things like that I'm sorry I'm going to
[1:29:31] skip on you sister Joanna he said but I
[1:29:33] deny upon the infallible evidence of the
[1:29:35] word that there's more than one major
[1:29:36] prophet messenger who will reveal the
[1:29:38] Mysteries as contained in the word and
[1:29:40] who has the ministry to turn the hearts
[1:29:41] of the children to the fathers thus
[1:29:43] saith the Lord by his unfailing word
[1:29:45] stands and shall stand and be Vindicated
[1:29:47] you say how has he Vindicated you're the
[1:29:49] Vindication of this message the fact
[1:29:51] that you are still here every other ism
[1:29:54] is gone it's washed up in the Dustbin of
[1:29:56] history that we are the Vindication in
[1:29:59] spite of the Cults and everything else
[1:30:00] we still believe the message of the hour
[1:30:02] we are the Vindication my family your
[1:30:05] family is a Vindication of this message
[1:30:11] Hallelujah
[1:30:15] Seven Stars
[1:30:17] in his hand as we said not eight or nine
[1:30:19] if I waited till I got to my note side I
[1:30:20] got it right
[1:30:26] Deuteronomy 4 brother uses that in this
[1:30:28] sermon
[1:30:29] he said he said no hearken Israel into
[1:30:32] the statutes under the judgments which I
[1:30:33] teach you to do them that you may live
[1:30:35] and go in and possess the land which the
[1:30:37] Lord God of your father has giveth you
[1:30:38] you shall not add into the word which I
[1:30:40] command you neither shall you diminish
[1:30:42] ought from it neither shall you
[1:30:43] diminished heart from it that you may
[1:30:45] keep the Commandments of the Lord your
[1:30:46] God which I command you he said so say
[1:30:49] hi in the name of Jesus Christ don't you
[1:30:51] add one thing don't take put your own
[1:30:53] ideas in it you just say what is said on
[1:30:55] those days you just do exactly what the
[1:30:57] Lord God has commanded to do don't add
[1:30:58] to it he said I bring heavens and earth
[1:31:00] before you today in a challenge has God
[1:31:02] ever said anything he has not fulfilled
[1:31:04] and done exactly what he said he would
[1:31:06] do for us hasn't he done it just the way
[1:31:08] he said he would do it he said that's
[1:31:09] exactly so will he continue to do it
[1:31:12] just don't add to it don't take from it
[1:31:14] just believe it and we'll come over for
[1:31:16] the Lord your God for we're nearing the
[1:31:18] going into the land
[1:31:20] Hallelujah Amen brother Brandon said
[1:31:22] it's got to come a Bible word Revival
[1:31:24] we've read that recently so I'll skip
[1:31:25] past it but he talks about him how that
[1:31:27] when it falls today and quickens you get
[1:31:29] the same results you did in Acts 2. how
[1:31:31] many believe that he said always has and
[1:31:33] always will be because it's the spirit
[1:31:35] of God that conditions the atmosphere
[1:31:37] yeah remember they never consulted
[1:31:39] Nathan
[1:31:40] right are you still with me this morning
[1:31:43] they never consulted Nathan
[1:31:45] but we did yeah
[1:31:48] yeah say brother Ben how can you how can
[1:31:50] you be sure how can you have a meeting
[1:31:51] how can you have a church how can you
[1:31:54] why don't you just go back and sit and
[1:31:55] listen to the prophet because we
[1:31:57] consulted Nathan
[1:31:59] Hallelujah we consulted the prophet of
[1:32:02] the age
[1:32:03] and brother Branham
[1:32:05] got the idea
[1:32:07] from the angel
[1:32:11] God spoke in our day yeah hey man give
[1:32:14] me that next quote there he said some of
[1:32:16] you people that really believe this to
[1:32:17] be the truth we're entering in another
[1:32:19] age we're entering the raptured age you
[1:32:21] know the church can't go in this
[1:32:22] condition it can't get any better it
[1:32:24] must get worse it's got to get worse it
[1:32:26] can't go like this see it's got to be
[1:32:28] something and it's moving right now for
[1:32:31] him it's on the move is on for the bride
[1:32:34] that's the saith the Lord then we don't
[1:32:37] have to wait on somebody to come along
[1:32:38] and start it I don't have to wait on
[1:32:40] some preacher or some church to start
[1:32:42] the Revival their Revival's in me
[1:32:45] when they went overseas in the Welsh
[1:32:47] Revival the policeman was standing there
[1:32:49] and he's standing and the the delegation
[1:32:51] from the U.S comes to him and they said
[1:32:53] where is the Welsh Revival Oh my he said
[1:32:55] it's right here they said where he said
[1:32:58] I am the Welsh Revival they didn't have
[1:33:00] to wait to find it they had already
[1:33:02] found it because they found somebody who
[1:33:04] embodied the Welsh Revival
[1:33:07] let me be that person yeah that believes
[1:33:09] God
[1:33:11] during my Revival people got the wrong
[1:33:12] idea what a Revival is they think well
[1:33:14] often were in Revival nobody will ever
[1:33:16] be sick nobody will ever be come on
[1:33:18] huh
[1:33:20] there will be a Revival like that
[1:33:22] it's a part it's the ending of this
[1:33:23] revival
[1:33:25] when we go home
[1:33:27] won't be nobody sick there
[1:33:29] won't be nobody unhappy in that new body
[1:33:31] we'll understand we'll know even as
[1:33:33] we're known
[1:33:35] while we're here we get sick
[1:33:37] we have trouble but you're still in
[1:33:39] Revival
[1:33:40] why a prophet Prophet said the word was
[1:33:44] coming back and did come back
[1:33:46] see we didn't put the Ark on a new card
[1:33:49] the brand said that was a a new
[1:33:51] denomination he started he started up he
[1:33:53] said when you start wrong you keep on
[1:33:55] going wrong I'm skipping down
[1:33:57] he said again that's the way David did
[1:33:58] he had it hitting his way so he just
[1:34:00] said you know what I'll do we're moving
[1:34:02] he had a revelation we're moving now so
[1:34:03] we'll do a new way
[1:34:04] the days of Miracles has passed so we'll
[1:34:06] just make us another organization
[1:34:08] we'll build a new cart showing a new
[1:34:10] thing that started he said what a false
[1:34:12] prophecy
[1:34:13] you've got to go back the way God said
[1:34:15] do it and put it on the shoulders of the
[1:34:17] Levites and that was over the heart the
[1:34:19] ark the word is not to be packed upon a
[1:34:21] new denomination upon the theories of
[1:34:23] some man but in the heart the word of
[1:34:25] God is not to be handled by
[1:34:27] denominations it's to be handled by the
[1:34:29] heart of a man where God can come in
[1:34:31] there and reveal himself
[1:34:33] again he said the Levi's shoulders was
[1:34:35] God's original way to do it they put on
[1:34:37] a new cart remember that's their second
[1:34:38] mistake
[1:34:39] right the first mistake they didn't
[1:34:41] consult Nathan the second mistake they
[1:34:42] put it on a new cart he said now it'll
[1:34:44] never work they didn't consult the right
[1:34:46] way and that's what's happened today
[1:34:48] when men no matter how sincere try to do
[1:34:50] him a service outside of his provided
[1:34:52] way of revealing it they always mess it
[1:34:54] up
[1:34:55] God sets it in his way man no matter how
[1:34:57] sincere you try to do it outside of that
[1:34:59] you'll mess it up
[1:35:00] again he said the word is not in the
[1:35:02] mind it's in the heart not on a new cart
[1:35:04] he said it represented something new
[1:35:06] spoke of every denomination there'd ever
[1:35:08] be
[1:35:08] he said but the he said the word is a
[1:35:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the heart
[1:35:12] of man not in some ecclesiastical move
[1:35:14] the holy spirit is The Treasure of God's
[1:35:15] love in the heart of men and women to
[1:35:17] obey it was on the shoulder of his
[1:35:18] ministers his ministry is supposed to
[1:35:20] Levi's put it up over their left
[1:35:21] shoulder and packed an ark like that
[1:35:23] because it was up over their heart they
[1:35:25] had the burden of the word on their
[1:35:26] heart
[1:35:27] come on he said God won't leave his
[1:35:30] program that's the reason we know that
[1:35:31] this day's got to be simple somebody
[1:35:33] comes along and says we don't need
[1:35:34] preachers no more I don't need to go to
[1:35:35] church anymore
[1:35:37] he said that spirit's just in the
[1:35:39] message it's not it's in the world
[1:35:41] everywhere I've noticed people I try to
[1:35:42] witness to anymore you know what they'll
[1:35:44] tell you yeah I have church in my house
[1:35:47] if I tell them I'm a pastor I've been
[1:35:49] told that two or three times recently
[1:35:52] interesting
[1:35:53] Church in your house where did that
[1:35:55] Spirit come from
[1:35:56] I believe you could have it in your
[1:35:58] house if that's all you had
[1:36:00] the Main Place overseas I've had Church
[1:36:02] in people's homes yeah We Were Young in
[1:36:04] this message many times we had churches
[1:36:05] at homes it's where the bride is
[1:36:07] gathered together that's where we ought
[1:36:08] to be
[1:36:09] right if you're so picky you can't find
[1:36:10] a church anywhere that that
[1:36:17] I gotta quit
[1:36:19] somewhere there's a church and I'll say
[1:36:20] this be happy
[1:36:22] if you can't be happy going here go
[1:36:23] somewhere else be happy
[1:36:25] we'll try to make you happy but we can't
[1:36:27] you know we're going to change the word
[1:36:28] the word is what it is
[1:36:31] so so you you go and be happy and live
[1:36:33] for God do what's right it's too late an
[1:36:35] hour to be fussing and fighting and come
[1:36:37] on and be caught up in drama over time
[1:36:41] God won't leave his program God in the
[1:36:43] beginning could have made the sun preach
[1:36:44] the gospel the winds preaching off for
[1:36:46] an angel preach the gospel the ordain
[1:36:47] men for that purpose and he never
[1:36:49] changes it he never ordained
[1:36:52] denominations he never ordained groups
[1:36:53] of men he ordained men to preach the
[1:36:55] gospel not Machinery Mechanical Devices
[1:36:57] or any Angelic being it was men yeah
[1:37:00] it may anything contrary to that as a
[1:37:02] new car the third mistake they made USA
[1:37:04] put his hand on the ark
[1:37:06] brother Brown said he was killed because
[1:37:07] he was under that false inspiration
[1:37:10] many true Christians he said losing
[1:37:12] their experience back in old dead
[1:37:13] denominations because they're putting
[1:37:15] their hand on the ark when they're not
[1:37:16] ordained to do so
[1:37:18] brother Brandon again he said it was
[1:37:20] when that man died that David with the
[1:37:21] anointing saw what he had done wrong
[1:37:24] said David's anointing was right
[1:37:26] but when he saw people die listen
[1:37:29] if people are dying
[1:37:34] for the sake of God's people yeah
[1:37:37] yeah pay attention
[1:37:40] yeah right I say that because their Ward
[1:37:43] told me that he's always offering to
[1:37:44] sing for Brother Louie
[1:37:46] and uh you know but Daryl's not much of
[1:37:48] a I think he's actually a pretty good
[1:37:49] singer better than me but they don't
[1:37:51] think he's much of a singer so he's
[1:37:52] always offering to sing and Brother
[1:37:54] Louie always texting back and he said
[1:37:56] you come sing at five o'clock and and he
[1:37:58] said we don't have church at five
[1:37:59] o'clock he said that's right
[1:38:01] so you can sing then
[1:38:03] and then he was having dental trouble
[1:38:06] and but Daryl man said this I don't know
[1:38:07] but he said but Louie's having dental
[1:38:09] trouble and he he texted him and said
[1:38:11] I'll just pick Sunday morning he said
[1:38:12] that's all right with you he said I'll
[1:38:13] just take that and believe respond back
[1:38:16] he said for the love of God's people no
[1:38:20] foreign
[1:38:23] I say this in a serious way for the love
[1:38:26] of God's people
[1:38:28] if people are dying because of what
[1:38:30] you're doing
[1:38:31] wake up yeah
[1:38:34] preach the word quit preaching your
[1:38:36] complexes quit preaching your anointing
[1:38:38] your emotions but preaching everything
[1:38:40] else preach the word
[1:38:42] for the love if you see people being
[1:38:44] messed up being destroyed being torn
[1:38:46] apart preach the word
[1:38:49] so when that man died David with the
[1:38:51] anointing saw what he had done wrong
[1:38:53] though he said oh David you Pastor can't
[1:38:55] you see your dead Creeds and
[1:38:56] denominations you're holding on to can't
[1:38:58] you see what it's doing it's killing an
[1:39:00] oozer spiritually dead and you wonder
[1:39:02] why there ain't no Revival so letting
[1:39:04] your women cut their hair paint their
[1:39:06] face wear shorts send your boys away to
[1:39:08] Ricky schools somewhere like that he's
[1:39:10] talking about going to Seminary he said
[1:39:12] and so forth like that where half of
[1:39:13] them comes home homosexuals and
[1:39:14] everything look what you're doing
[1:39:17] should we do this with our children
[1:39:19] should we do that watch your children
[1:39:22] for the love of your children
[1:39:24] do the right thing by them
[1:39:26] watch your children every family is
[1:39:28] different every family's in a different
[1:39:29] situation watch your children every
[1:39:31] church is Sovereign watch your church
[1:39:34] yeah God help us to take the burden of
[1:39:37] the word on our heart for the church
[1:39:39] that we go to yes
[1:39:40] innocent people die why don't we put our
[1:39:43] hands on the ark
[1:39:44] immoral living in the church is always a
[1:39:47] symptom of false teaching
[1:39:49] always is they are commingled
[1:39:52] I cannot stand here and tell you I
[1:39:54] preach the truth and live in immorality
[1:39:56] it's impossible
[1:39:58] because what I preach is more than what
[1:40:00] I say
[1:40:01] but it's what I do and what I present to
[1:40:03] the people right
[1:40:04] and we've got to recognize that church
[1:40:06] and many times you see people start to
[1:40:09] go out and we see a
[1:40:11] all over the all over the place message
[1:40:13] children young people going out and
[1:40:15] becoming homosexuals marrying girls
[1:40:17] marrying girls boys marrying Boys still
[1:40:19] listening to tapes
[1:40:22] claiming to be right with God because I
[1:40:25] believe they have the token because they
[1:40:26] listen to a tape it's baloney yeah
[1:40:30] but they're going out and doing those
[1:40:32] things and and some take such they have
[1:40:35] they idolize their Pastor or somebody
[1:40:36] else and say well I had an emotion or
[1:40:38] something and I'm not gonna live any way
[1:40:39] I want to nonsense
[1:40:41] others are pastors have so closed them
[1:40:43] off from the from the word and from the
[1:40:45] from the spirit of the word that there's
[1:40:47] no Revival and they begin to go into
[1:40:48] immoral living because there's no
[1:40:50] Revival at all
[1:40:52] For the Love of God's people can't we
[1:40:55] look and see what's going on and come
[1:40:57] back to the word come back to what God
[1:41:00] Said come back to the Revival that that
[1:41:03] Nathan brought that the prophet to the
[1:41:05] age brought
[1:41:09] say it could never happen to us
[1:41:10] absolutely it could yeah
[1:41:12] but it won't
[1:41:14] say how do you say it won't because I
[1:41:17] won't let it
[1:41:18] you won't let it
[1:41:21] not going to sacrifice my children on
[1:41:23] Bill's altar yeah
[1:41:28] I'm gonna do what's right
[1:41:31] we're going to do a try you're gonna
[1:41:32] make right decisions how do you know
[1:41:33] that brother Ben I say that by faith but
[1:41:35] I know that because you're the Bride of
[1:41:37] Jesus Christ somebody's going to live it
[1:41:40] somebody's going to be it somebody's
[1:41:42] going to hold on to their children
[1:41:45] I don't mean to hold them in a way of
[1:41:47] holding them back from the world I mean
[1:41:49] to implant something in them that they
[1:41:52] can believe
[1:41:55] show them such a life
[1:41:58] that they no matter what they said they
[1:42:01] can say I want what dad's got yeah
[1:42:04] I want what I want what Mama's Got
[1:42:07] I may not understand it I may not agree
[1:42:09] with it but I want what they got because
[1:42:11] I know what happened when they got saved
[1:42:12] I know they were changed I know what my
[1:42:15] home life is like the prodigal son said
[1:42:17] I he said I oh God he said I know how my
[1:42:21] dad treats his hired servants
[1:42:24] and it has such an impact on me that I
[1:42:26] want to live for God I want to go back
[1:42:28] even if I'm just a servant but when he
[1:42:31] got back he wasn't just a servant he was
[1:42:32] a son yeah God help me to live so my
[1:42:35] children if you can see the Revival in
[1:42:37] me not just in the way I preach or the
[1:42:39] what I do God help me to live it at home
[1:42:42] help me to live it at home help me to so
[1:42:44] that people can see so my children can
[1:42:46] see dad's got something really he makes
[1:42:48] mistakes he's human but there's
[1:42:49] something real
[1:42:58] good
[1:43:00] I told you I'm being a little bit
[1:43:02] personal here I'm done I'm gonna have to
[1:43:04] quit
[1:43:06] uh
[1:43:08] brother Daryl Ward I appreciate that
[1:43:10] meeting with this weekend he was always
[1:43:13] been such an impact on me
[1:43:15] but it's not been because of way he
[1:43:16] preaches
[1:43:18] it's not what he preaches
[1:43:20] so I watch that man live
[1:43:23] and I saw what he's been through and his
[1:43:25] testimony and things and and I've gotten
[1:43:27] over the years at times where we'd be
[1:43:29] really close and then sometimes we don't
[1:43:30] talk for a long time but but I've gotten
[1:43:32] to where I I kind of rely on that you
[1:43:34] can rely on a life yeah
[1:43:37] yeah the way a person lives the way they
[1:43:39] treat people
[1:43:40] the way they the way not just what we do
[1:43:43] in church but what we do at home
[1:43:45] gotta let the Revival go not just the
[1:43:48] church I want the church to be in
[1:43:49] Revival but let the Revival be in my
[1:43:51] home let the Revival be at my altar at
[1:43:53] the house let it be let it be in my
[1:43:55] prayer closet let it be in my house oh
[1:43:57] God
[1:44:02] let me live such a life
[1:44:04] before the people that they may not
[1:44:06] agree with me but they can't deny I'm a
[1:44:08] Christian
[1:44:10] yes
[1:44:12] brother Brandon said don't ever start an
[1:44:13] organization
[1:44:15] I just get past
[1:44:16] oh my
[1:44:18] so don't ever start an organization
[1:44:19] don't try to build on anything else stay
[1:44:22] humble before the Lord your God for it
[1:44:24] looks like the gates may open until the
[1:44:25] promised land soon then let us go in
[1:44:28] with the true singing and rejoicing when
[1:44:30] the bride and groom takes its place at
[1:44:31] the throne
[1:44:33] we don't want to even in sincerity see
[1:44:35] what we do matters to our children it
[1:44:37] matters to us or what David did matter
[1:44:38] to USA
[1:44:40] and David woke up and said I don't want
[1:44:41] anybody else to die
[1:44:43] because of what I've been doing we have
[1:44:45] been running the church we have been
[1:44:46] doing in my house I don't want anybody
[1:44:48] else to die and so he put the heart back
[1:44:50] in his place but today the ark the ark
[1:44:52] belongs in the house of God it belongs
[1:44:54] in our home who can stand before it we
[1:44:56] can't
