[44:20] garden of eden as soon as the man
[44:21] realized that he had sinned
[44:23] instead of him running up and down the
[44:24] street of paradise saying father father
[44:26] where are you
[44:27] he was hiding and it was god running up
[44:29] and down the way hollering adam adam
[44:31] weareth thou
[44:32] see the nature of man instead of coming
[44:34] out and confessing in the open and being
[44:36] sincere about it and saying
[44:38] god i've sinned forgive me he'll run and
[44:40] hide behind something
[44:41] and the one thing adam did which is a
[44:43] great strain on man he made himself a
[44:45] homemade religion he says now
[44:47] we know the word religion means a
[44:48] covering and adam instead of saying god
[44:51] cover me he made himself some aprons out
[44:54] of fig leaves and he and eve
[44:56] and they worked all right along as god
[44:58] wasn't around but when they came in the
[44:59] presence of god they realized that their
[45:01] fig leaf religion wouldn't work he said
[45:04] and brother there's
[45:05] he said there's so much of that today
[45:07] that i'm afraid to tell you you're going
[45:09] to find the same thing when god comes
[45:11] again that that homemade
[45:12] fig leaf religion will not stand in the
[45:14] presence of god he says god
[45:16] had to make a covering for them you
[45:18] believe that this evening
[45:20] so we see that whenever we try to cover
[45:21] up or we try to do anything by our own
[45:23] ideas or our own works or our own
[45:25] practices
[45:26] it cannot it's not good enough for the
[45:27] presence of the lord is that right
[45:29] there's only one way and that's through
[45:30] the shed blood of jesus christ that
[45:32] anyone can get to the father amen
[45:34] now matthew 2 and verse 6 and i'll read
[45:36] some scriptures just as we go down
[45:38] through here just interjecting little
[45:39] pieces as we go down through here just
[45:41] pointing to christ as the types and
[45:42] shadows and
[45:44] and in matthew 2 and 6 and now in
[45:45] bethlehem in the land of judea
[45:48] are thou not at least among the princes
[45:49] of judah and for out of thee
[45:51] shall come a governor and shall rule my
[45:53] people of israel
[45:55] and so we see here in psalms 37 and 23
[45:57] the steps of a good man are ordered of
[45:59] the lord and he delighteth in his way
[46:02] though he fall he shall not utterly be
[46:04] cast down for the lord upholdeth him
[46:06] with his hand
[46:07] i have been young and now i'm old and
[46:09] yet i have not seen the righteous
[46:10] forsaken nor his seed begging bread
[46:13] he said he is merciful and lendeth and
[46:16] his seed is blessed depart from evil and
[46:18] do good and dwell forevermore for the
[46:20] lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not
[46:22] his saints
[46:23] they are preserved forever but the seed
[46:25] of the wicked shall be cut off
[46:27] the righteous shall inherit the land and
[46:29] dwell therein forever do you believe
[46:31] that
[46:31] now i'm just going to read through this
[46:33] if we could fellowship by redemption and
[46:35] kind of go through a few quotes here in
[46:36] a few different scriptures and
[46:38] and just look at this as the lord would
[46:40] lead us just that god is always going to
[46:41] make a way and
[46:42] we know that that way is jesus christ is
[46:44] that right now friends he said it's the
[46:46] only road back he said i've seen many of
[46:48] them that could dance in the spirit they
[46:49] could speak in tongues it could run all
[46:51] over the building and everything else
[46:52] and still
[46:53] no fellowship just as miserable as they
[46:55] could be because they had built the
[46:57] wrong foundation
[46:58] that's right he says we've got to get
[46:59] the right thing and the first thing he
[47:01] said that's the only foundation for
[47:03] fellowship
[47:04] he said there's only one time and one
[47:05] ground that god ever spread the welcome
[47:07] back
[47:08] or the welcome mat back to adam's fallen
[47:10] race he said only one and that was in
[47:12] the garden of eden
[47:13] when he spread it back by the way of the
[47:15] shed blood and he said i believe in the
[47:17] blood he says
[47:17] not talk about it but i mean worship in
[47:20] it amen do you believe that tonight
[47:22] it's not a blood that we can just point
[47:23] to and say well this is it or this is
[47:24] that but we've got to worship in that
[47:26] blood we've got to
[47:27] come as believers and say and when we're
[47:29] forgiven of our sins
[47:31] we can't let satan constantly be
[47:32] bringing that back up and bringing it
[47:34] back up we've got to walk as sons and
[47:35] daughters of god
[47:37] into righteousness is that right it's
[47:39] not our righteousness but it's his
[47:40] righteousness that makes us clean
[47:42] now he said he didn't say when i return
[47:44] will i find dress codes or polished up
[47:46] message people
[47:47] he said will i find faith now we know
[47:49] that when we find that faith it will
[47:51] lead to the good things is that right
[47:53] when we find the spirit of god it's like
[47:54] brother it's like the minister said one
[47:56] time
[47:57] you don't clean the fish until you catch
[47:59] it you want to get people to christ
[48:00] and let christ clean them up is that
[48:02] right now faith is a revelation a
[48:04] revelation of what it's the revelation
[48:07] of the will of god in your life and and
[48:09] we see that the will of god
[48:10] the will of god is that none should
[48:12] perish but that all should have eternal
[48:13] life so we see that god come and made a
[48:15] way
[48:16] when adam and eve when they that the
[48:18] fall took place in the garden of eden
[48:19] god
[48:20] instantly come and wanted to make a way
[48:22] it was the shadow of christ forecoming
[48:24] with the shed blood of the lamb is that
[48:25] right
[48:26] numbers 24 and 17 he says i shall see
[48:29] him
[48:30] but not now i shall behold him but not
[48:32] nigh there shall come a start of jacob
[48:34] and a scepter and shall rise out of
[48:35] israel and shall smite the corners of
[48:37] moab and shall destroy
[48:38] the children of seth or seth and
[48:40] jeremiah 23 and 5 behold the days come
[48:43] saith the lord that i will raise unto
[48:45] david a righteous branch
[48:46] and a king shall reign and prosper and
[48:48] shall execute judgment and justice in
[48:50] the earth
[48:51] and in his days judah shall be saved and
[48:53] israel shall dwell
[48:54] safely and this is his name where by he
[48:57] shall be called the lord our
[48:58] righteousness
[49:00] now brother branham says in 1965 in
[49:02] god's chosen place of worship he says
[49:03] now notice
[49:04] not one word of the shadows fell he says
[49:06] not one word ever failed not one shadow
[49:08] he said
[49:09] everything typed perfectly he said he's
[49:12] god's chosen place of worship and
[49:14] and god's name is given to him he is
[49:16] god's place of worship so that means you
[49:18] can't worship any side anywhere else
[49:20] outside of christ is that right
[49:22] and god's name is given to him he was
[49:24] the word of god he's the name of god
[49:25] he's both the word of god and the name
[49:27] of god he's the word made flesh
[49:30] he was the word of god the lamb of god
[49:32] the name of god and was god and he said
[49:33] that's what he was and the chosen
[49:36] only place of worship to god amen so if
[49:38] we see anybody worshiping
[49:40] anywhere else other than jesus christ
[49:42] it's wrong is that right
[49:43] the bible teaches us that there's one
[49:45] way back to the father and that's
[49:46] through
[49:47] jesus christ he said and god refuses any
[49:50] other place besides in jesus christ you
[49:52] cannot worship him
[49:53] anywhere he said in vain they do worship
[49:56] me teaching the doctrine
[49:57] doctrines and commandments of men today
[50:00] we have creeds and dogmas and everything
[50:01] that teaches this is the way and that is
[50:03] the way and jesus came and said
[50:05] i am the way the truth and the life and
[50:07] no man can come to god
[50:09] but by me in other words i'm the door to
[50:12] the sheepfold all
[50:13] without are thieves he is the only
[50:15] approach he's the door he's the way the
[50:17] truth and the life
[50:18] all there is the only interest the only
[50:20] place the only worship
[50:22] the only name so we see we look through
[50:24] scripture brother brahm says everything
[50:26] is tied to jesus christ he says all the
[50:28] old testament is tied to him when the
[50:30] new testament is tied to him and the
[50:31] church today
[50:33] is tied to him by the word of his
[50:34] commandment there's not another place or
[50:36] another name or anywhere
[50:38] where god ever promised to meet man only
[50:40] in jesus christ his chosen place of
[50:43] worship do you believe that tonight
[50:45] amen we can't find it in our pastor we
[50:46] can't find it in the singers or the
[50:48] musicians we got to go back to jesus
[50:50] christ
[50:51] and i love how brother branham he says
[50:52] they were complaining that he was
[50:53] preaching on jesus too much and that's
[50:55] what i believe the prophet said hey if
[50:57] there's anything i can preach on i want
[50:58] to preach on him is that right
[51:00] so if there's anything as christians we
[51:01] ought to be excited to talk about it
[51:03] ought to be jesus christ
[51:05] that's the focus that's the theme that's
[51:07] the everything that's been the theme of
[51:08] the message is to get us back to christ
[51:10] is that right
[51:11] the prophet had a restoring ministry
[51:12] restoring us back to what to christ is
[51:14] that right
[51:16] he wasn't restoring us back to signs and
[51:18] wonders or a prophet or a pastor
[51:19] or this group or this organization he
[51:21] was pouring us back to jesus christ
[51:23] because he knew
[51:24] that that was the only way that we could
[51:26] as a bride as the
[51:27] spotless bride of jesus christ that was
[51:29] the only way we could make it through
[51:30] laodicea was with
[51:32] jesus christ is that right amen do you
[51:35] love the lord this evening
[51:37] amen i will not hold you very long and
[51:42] i know a bunch of you have worked today
[51:43] and i know we come to worship in the
[51:45] spirit of the lord so just
[51:47] everybody don't be nervous and be fine
[51:50] we'll be all right and we'll
[51:51] we'll have you home or having mcdonald's
[51:53] as soon as you can but
[51:55] i believe we come we focus we focus on
[51:57] the word of god we ought to give him our
[51:58] attention amen
[51:59] amen so just and that's the hardest
[52:01] thing for me even as
[52:02] even when i'm ministering to not think
[52:04] about the things of the day and not
[52:06] think about the things that are going on
[52:07] and and going on in the world and and so
[52:10] you know i think we just sometimes if we
[52:12] can come in and we can just set those
[52:13] things aside just for a few moments
[52:15] amen and focus on him god will speak to
[52:17] us amen
[52:18] amen it's not you know it's it's it's
[52:20] not god that doesn't show up sometimes
[52:22] it's us that doesn't show up amen
[52:25] romans 15 10 and again he saith rejoice
[52:27] she gentiles
[52:28] with his people and again praise you the
[52:30] lord all you gentiles and lord him and
[52:32] ye
[52:32] all you people and again isaiah say
[52:34] there shall be a root of jesse and he
[52:36] shall
[52:37] rise and reign over the gentiles in him
[52:39] the gentiles trust
[52:41] now the god of all hope fill you with
[52:43] joy and peace
[52:44] and believing that you may abound in
[52:46] hope through the power of the holy ghost
[52:48] so he's speaking of christ there in luke
[52:49] 1 30 and the angel said unto her
[52:51] fear not mary for thou house found favor
[52:53] with god and behold thou shalt conceive
[52:56] in thy womb and bring forth a son and
[52:57] thou shalt call his name jesus and he
[53:00] shall be great and shall be called the
[53:01] son of the highest the lord god shall
[53:03] give unto him the throne of his father
[53:06] david and he shall reign over the house
[53:08] of jacob
[53:09] forever in his kingdom there shall be no
[53:12] end
[53:13] now we see here brother branham's going
[53:15] to go down and i'm just going to kind of
[53:16] go down through this quote here just for
[53:17] a few moments adding some scriptures in
[53:19] as we go through it and just kind of
[53:20] look
[53:21] at jesus and how how everything was was
[53:23] typed for him coming in the old
[53:25] testament you know
[53:26] with the pillar of fire it was god above
[53:28] us then god jesus came down and
[53:30] god was made flesh and it was god with
[53:31] us amen and then the holy spirit come
[53:34] down and it was god in us is that right
[53:36] and so we see you know many times we'd
[53:37] like to go back and and and be with god
[53:39] with us we'd like to see jesus we'd like
[53:41] to see the flesh and like to see those
[53:43] things
[53:43] but the most powerful that it that the
[53:45] believers ever had was not god with
[53:47] jesus but it was
[53:48] jesus in the believer is that right so
[53:50] we live in the best day that we can live
[53:52] in we
[53:53] we we have the most power that we've
[53:55] ever been given it's not that we have
[53:56] more power than christ
[53:58] and that's not what the scripture
[53:59] teaches but we have that same power and
[54:01] a greater quality is that right
[54:03] now isaiah 40 and verse 3 it says excuse
[54:06] me all those
[54:07] men were great men and they died in the
[54:09] line but finally one day in bethlehem of
[54:11] judea
[54:12] the royal seed was born he said which
[54:14] all the rest of them were just shadows
[54:16] but the royal seed was born not of a man
[54:18] but he was born by a virgin with the
[54:20] power in his veins to conquer
[54:22] death and hell and god had made a
[54:24] promise now isaiah 40 and verse 3 the
[54:27] voice of him that crieth in the
[54:28] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[54:30] lord
[54:30] make straight in the desert the highway
[54:32] for our god every valley shall be
[54:34] exalted and every mountain
[54:36] and a hill shall be made load in the
[54:38] crooked shall be made straight in the
[54:40] rough places plain
[54:41] and the glory of the lord shall be
[54:43] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[54:44] together for the mouth of the lord hath
[54:46] spoken it
[54:47] now brother man says an ordinary man
[54:49] could not do it
[54:51] he said but if god makes a promise he's
[54:53] just the same god
[54:54] that he was a few minutes before with
[54:56] abraham jehovah jireh the lord
[54:58] shall provide the way to take the gate
[55:01] do you believe that
[55:02] now we see that it was it wasn't just an
[55:04] ordinary man and there's certain things
[55:05] that
[55:06] that you can do as an individual that i
[55:08] can't do and there's certain things i
[55:10] can do as an individual that you can't
[55:11] do and
[55:12] and as the body of christ we've got to
[55:14] pull those strengths together amen
[55:16] there's prayer warriors there's singers
[55:17] there's
[55:18] there's those that can preach there's
[55:19] those that can pastor there's those that
[55:21] can lead there's
[55:22] deacons and trustees and those together
[55:24] we can't maybe all be one thing or
[55:26] maybe even what we want to be but god's
[55:27] whatever god has called us to be we have
[55:29] to be that
[55:30] is that right amen you know if i was to
[55:32] go and ask matthew to come in
[55:34] and do my job for me tomorrow he's my
[55:35] little boy is eight years old
[55:37] he probably couldn't do that or some
[55:39] things paxton he's three there's things
[55:41] i can't ask him to do that matinee can
[55:42] do
[55:43] i can't save paxton go out and feed the
[55:45] dogs matany that's his chore every
[55:46] morning he goes out and feeds the dogs
[55:48] and
[55:48] and it wouldn't be fair for me to ask
[55:50] paxton to do the same thing
[55:51] because he can't open the lid to the can
[55:53] he can't reach in he can't get the food
[55:55] out
[55:56] and the dogs would just be attacking him
[55:57] the whole time and there are certain
[55:59] things that
[56:00] that that god has called us to be that
[56:02] wouldn't be fair to ask me to do
[56:03] something that he would ask you to do
[56:04] and
[56:05] and so we see that whenever whenever we
[56:07] were looking down through time all these
[56:08] great men
[56:09] you know you look at you look at moses
[56:11] you look at joshua you look at caleb but
[56:13] they were not qualified
[56:15] to do what christ was qualified to do is
[56:17] that right
[56:18] you even look at the prophet brother
[56:19] branham he was not qualified to do what
[56:21] christ was qualified to do is that right
[56:24] so it's not that we can put what jesus
[56:26] christ was on a man
[56:27] but we've got to understand that jesus
[56:29] christ he was the boy he was the son
[56:31] the virgin born son of god is that right
[56:33] he was god made flesh
[56:35] everything the fullness of the god had
[56:37] bodily all dwelled within this man jesus
[56:40] christ is that right
[56:41] he says how are we going to do it he
[56:43] says joshua died moses died the rest of
[56:46] them died but god said he shall possess
[56:48] the gates of his enemy he said how is he
[56:50] going to possess death
[56:52] and so that was the question you know
[56:53] all down through time
[56:55] you look and men had conquered lions men
[56:57] had conquered moses had come up and the
[56:59] red sea had parted they
[57:00] the the the the all the the children of
[57:03] israel crossed across and
[57:04] and you see that they come to jericho
[57:06] and the walls fell and then you see
[57:08] later on down through all these things
[57:10] job all these things that happened but
[57:11] every one of them had died
[57:13] is that right so who was going to
[57:15] possess the gates of death and
[57:17] proverbs 30 and verse 4 he says who that
[57:19] sended up into heaven or descended
[57:21] who hath gathered the wind in his fist
[57:23] who hath bounded in the waters in a
[57:25] garment who hath established
[57:27] all the ends of the earth what is his
[57:28] name and what is his son's name if thou
[57:30] can tell he said every word of god is
[57:33] pure and he is a shield unto them
[57:35] that put their trust in him add not unto
[57:38] his words lest he reprove thee and thou
[57:40] be found a liar
[57:42] he said he's got a way of doing things
[57:44] and this is back to the quote brother
[57:45] branham
[57:46] is speaking here he says he's got a way
[57:47] of doing things he shall possess
[57:49] the gates of his enemy the royal seed
[57:51] was born he was tempted in every manner
[57:54] like we are just as you have to be
[57:56] tempted
[57:57] he said so was he he said the devil
[57:59] quickly taken him when he received the
[58:00] holy spirit into the wilderness 40 days
[58:02] and nights to be tempted
[58:04] and when he come out at his death they
[58:05] drove nails in his hands and spit in his
[58:07] face
[58:08] and went through every sickness but when
[58:10] he was here on earth he proved that he
[58:11] could conquer
[58:12] sickness he said when peter's wife's
[58:14] mother laid of the palsy he touched her
[58:16] hand and the fever left her
[58:18] when the leper cried at the gate unclean
[58:19] unclean he says if you will
[58:21] you can make me whole and he said i will
[58:23] be thou whole
[58:25] he conquered and took the gate of
[58:26] leprosy he took the gate of fevers he
[58:28] made
[58:28] nature obey him so we see that as jesus
[58:31] christ come we realize this was a
[58:33] different
[58:34] amen we realized that he was different
[58:36] than all the other men before him he had
[58:37] a power there was something different
[58:39] about jesus christ
[58:41] you look back in history and and you
[58:43] know many times you look at theologians
[58:44] and they talk about
[58:46] some people don't believe in jesus
[58:47] christ that he was god made flesh but
[58:49] they believed historically that he was a
[58:50] figure
[58:51] you know they believe all the miracles
[58:53] and all these things were done but they
[58:54] can't explain them
[58:55] so they just say it was a historical
[58:57] fact and they look at that that way but
[58:59] as you as believers as you and i we
[59:01] believe
[59:01] that he was the son of god is that right
[59:03] and that when he died on the cross
[59:05] our sins were paid for is that right
[59:07] that ours by his stripes we are healed
[59:09] so that when we ask for healing we can
[59:11] point back to the cross
[59:13] just as israel could point back to the
[59:14] brazen serpent in the desert as that
[59:16] ride and claim their healing is that
[59:18] right why that was representing sin
[59:20] already judged
[59:22] do you believe that amen if i get back
[59:24] on the atonement i'll never get back on
[59:26] anything else but
[59:27] we believe that that was done for you
[59:28] and i so that when my children are sick
[59:30] i can look back to that and say by his
[59:32] stripes
[59:32] they are healed is that right when i say
[59:35] that i'm going through a trial or see
[59:36] that my family's going through a
[59:37] situation i can point back to that and
[59:39] say
[59:39] as he overcomes so shall i overcome is
[59:42] that right
[59:43] isaiah 29-18 as in that day shall the
[59:46] death hear and the words of the book and
[59:47] the eyes of the blind shall see out of
[59:49] obscurity and out of darkness
[59:51] isaiah 29 and 19 the meek shall also
[59:53] increase their joy
[59:55] in the lord and the poor among men shall
[59:57] rejoice in the holy one of israel
[59:59] you see he was the seed of abraham the
[1:00:01] royal sea
[1:00:02] he was the one promised was given to
[1:00:04] through him abraham and all the seed
[1:00:06] that followed him
[1:00:08] up to be royal seed and all the seed
[1:00:10] after him god's promise is true how many
[1:00:12] believe god's promise is true tonight
[1:00:15] and so that's the thing we can believe
[1:00:16] that god's promise is true we can
[1:00:18] believe that
[1:00:18] the the the promises that were ordained
[1:00:20] or the promises that were written in the
[1:00:22] scripture
[1:00:22] the promises that were spoken of by the
[1:00:24] prophet to the bride we can believe they
[1:00:26] were true
[1:00:27] but we have to act on them is that right
[1:00:29] amen he said we have a checkbook we just
[1:00:31] have to make out the chick is that right
[1:00:33] he said and we see that that god's
[1:00:35] promise is true he conquered sickness
[1:00:37] and he conquered temptation
[1:00:39] when the enemy spit in his face and
[1:00:41] smote his jaw he turned to the other
[1:00:43] side
[1:00:44] when they jerked the beard from his face
[1:00:46] and spit on him he never riled back he
[1:00:48] conquered the gate of temptation
[1:00:50] and took it he said then you say my
[1:00:52] temper won't let me do it he says you
[1:00:54] seed of abraham yes sir he conquered it
[1:00:56] for you
[1:00:57] when he was riled upon he riled not back
[1:00:59] is that right
[1:01:00] amen we can't have somebody not put on
[1:01:02] their blinker in front of us and not get
[1:01:04] mad
[1:01:05] is that right not a lot of amens on that
[1:01:08] one but sometimes we've got to look at
[1:01:09] this and say hey
[1:01:10] is my attitude is my is my spirit where
[1:01:13] it should be is it line up with christ
[1:01:15] is that right so we look many times in
[1:01:17] the scripture and we look at the
[1:01:19] the things that christ had done and he
[1:01:20] was to be our primary example for how we
[1:01:22] should live our lives is that right
[1:01:25] i believe they were first called
[1:01:26] christians at antioch because their life
[1:01:28] was based on jesus christ is that right
[1:01:31] genesis 17 and 19 and god said sarah thy
[1:01:33] wife shall bear thee a son indeed and
[1:01:35] thou shalt call his name
[1:01:36] isaac and i will establish my covenant
[1:01:39] with him
[1:01:40] for an everlasting covenant and with his
[1:01:42] seed after him now remember the
[1:01:44] the the the the sermon that brother
[1:01:47] barron preached the unconditional
[1:01:48] covenant we look at the
[1:01:49] the covenant that he had with abraham
[1:01:51] and just to kind of just
[1:01:52] identify that and speak on that just for
[1:01:54] a few moments he made the unconditional
[1:01:56] covenant with abraham and what that was
[1:01:58] was
[1:01:58] he didn't base it on abraham's works or
[1:02:00] abraham's abilities he said it was an
[1:02:02] unconditional covenant
[1:02:04] because he said i'm going to swear by
[1:02:05] myself that this will happen
[1:02:08] it's like if he come and made a covenant
[1:02:09] with me he says alan i'm not going to
[1:02:10] put any of this on you it's like if i
[1:02:12] went and got a loan
[1:02:13] and he says alan i'm going to pay this
[1:02:15] back for you it's none of it's going to
[1:02:16] be based on you or
[1:02:17] on your works or your deeds or on your
[1:02:20] on your
[1:02:20] on your stature anything that he said he
[1:02:23] based that unconditional covenant on the
[1:02:25] word of god is that right
[1:02:26] it was nothing abraham could do to mess
[1:02:28] it up there was nothing that anybody
[1:02:29] could do to mess it up
[1:02:30] god had spoke his word and when he spoke
[1:02:33] it it was not going to return unto him
[1:02:35] void is that right
[1:02:37] now he says here he says when he was
[1:02:39] made fun of he held his peace when he
[1:02:41] was called a devil he held his peace
[1:02:43] he had one business and that was the
[1:02:44] father's business
[1:02:46] he went about doing that and finally
[1:02:48] they took him to a cross and death had
[1:02:50] to face him
[1:02:51] he said all the rest of them had
[1:02:52] conquered the seas they had conquered
[1:02:54] nature they had conquered lines they'd
[1:02:55] conquered fire
[1:02:57] they had conquered everything but death
[1:02:59] and but here was the one
[1:03:00] beating in his veins and that had the
[1:03:03] conquering power of death
[1:03:05] so they took his hands and stretched him
[1:03:06] out and nailed him to a cross they beat
[1:03:08] him and stripped him till his bones
[1:03:10] stared at him
[1:03:11] but when he did they had done all they
[1:03:13] could do and death struck him and said
[1:03:14] now i'll take you
[1:03:16] and satan said now i'll take you like i
[1:03:17] did joshua i'll take you like i did
[1:03:19] daniel
[1:03:20] and i'll do all this because i'll make
[1:03:22] you die
[1:03:23] now we know that this as we go down
[1:03:25] through this quote i know many of you
[1:03:26] have read it many times but
[1:03:28] but just if you just bear with me just
[1:03:29] for a few moments and and we see that
[1:03:31] this
[1:03:32] this this was a little bit different
[1:03:33] than all the other prophets all the
[1:03:34] other
[1:03:35] all the other people before him this was
[1:03:37] a little bit different jesus was coming
[1:03:39] down to a point
[1:03:40] and we know that that he had to die as a
[1:03:42] man in the garden of gethsemane we know
[1:03:44] the spirit of god left him
[1:03:45] and we see he had to come and he had to
[1:03:47] die as a man and
[1:03:48] and and we see that those that all of
[1:03:50] our sins and and you know i had a lady
[1:03:52] ask me one time and i've spoke about
[1:03:54] this before but
[1:03:55] you know they used to offer up the blood
[1:03:57] of goats and and sheep is that right as
[1:03:59] a sacrifice and it was a covering of sin
[1:04:01] and
[1:04:01] and and we see that that as that was a
[1:04:03] covering of sin if i were to take a
[1:04:05] sheet and cover up this pulpit
[1:04:07] and this was to typify my sin that
[1:04:09] pulpit would still be there is that
[1:04:10] right and
[1:04:11] the sheet was a covering the blood of
[1:04:13] the bulls and goats was a covering
[1:04:15] but this blood it was different it took
[1:04:17] the sin away as brother branham preaches
[1:04:19] or talks about in the sermon it was like
[1:04:20] the son of god had crossed a chasm
[1:04:22] and whenever that son of god had
[1:04:24] repented of his sins and
[1:04:26] had been washed in the blood of jesus
[1:04:27] christ the blood of jesus christ bridged
[1:04:29] that chasm and the son of god
[1:04:31] walked back on the side with christ and
[1:04:33] the sin that he had committed was laid
[1:04:35] back
[1:04:35] upon the accuser is that right so we see
[1:04:38] that everything that we had done
[1:04:40] everything that satan had caused us to
[1:04:41] do is
[1:04:42] as brother branham talks about selling
[1:04:43] us out in the pawnshop everything that
[1:04:45] we had done wrong
[1:04:46] all of our sin is laid back upon satan
[1:04:49] and he will stand
[1:04:50] and be judged for that is that right and
[1:04:53] we will be judged by the righteousness
[1:04:55] of jesus christ
[1:04:56] so isaiah 53 and 1 it says who hath
[1:04:58] believed i report and to whom is the arm
[1:05:00] of the lord revealed
[1:05:02] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:05:03] tender planet as a root out of the dry
[1:05:05] ground he hath
[1:05:06] no form nor comeliness and when we shall
[1:05:09] see him there is no beauty that we
[1:05:10] should desire him
[1:05:12] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[1:05:14] of sorrows acquainted with grief
[1:05:16] and we hid as it were our faces from him
[1:05:19] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[1:05:22] surely he hath borne our griefs and
[1:05:24] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[1:05:25] him stricken
[1:05:26] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[1:05:29] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:05:31] bruised for our iniquities
[1:05:32] and the chastisement of our peace was
[1:05:35] upon him
[1:05:36] and by his stripes we are healed do you
[1:05:38] believe that
[1:05:40] it says i in verse 6 all we like sheep
[1:05:42] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[1:05:44] to his own way and the lord hath lay
[1:05:45] down
[1:05:46] him the iniquity of us all he was
[1:05:49] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:05:51] not his mouth he was brought as the lamb
[1:05:53] to the slaughter
[1:05:54] and a sheep before her shearers is dumb
[1:05:56] he opened not his mouth are you thankful
[1:05:58] for that tonight
[1:06:00] he was taken from prison from judgment
[1:06:02] and where
[1:06:03] who shall declare his generation for he
[1:06:05] was cut off out of the land of the
[1:06:06] living
[1:06:07] for his transgression of my people was
[1:06:09] he stricken
[1:06:10] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:06:12] and with the rich in his death because
[1:06:14] he had done no violence neither was
[1:06:16] there any deceit in his mouth
[1:06:18] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[1:06:20] and hath put him to grief
[1:06:22] when thou shalt make his soul an
[1:06:24] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:06:27] and he shall prolong his days and it
[1:06:29] shall pleasure the lord
[1:06:30] and shall prosper in his hand are you
[1:06:32] thankful for that
[1:06:33] and now what was amazing to me as many
[1:06:35] times you look at the scripture and you
[1:06:37] see things that are going on in today's
[1:06:39] times and
[1:06:40] and i'm not typifying anything or
[1:06:41] spiritualizing anything but
[1:06:43] you look at what's going on with israel
[1:06:45] right now and i may not be saying it
[1:06:46] correctly but hamas i believe
[1:06:48] is is how you pronounce it in the hamas
[1:06:52] is that right i don't watch the news or
[1:06:53] listen so i read it
[1:06:55] and i'm not very intelligent in that so
[1:06:58] hamas okay
[1:06:59] there we go so you look at the people
[1:07:01] that are standing up for this hamas
[1:07:03] that are against israel and and it's you
[1:07:05] know you see the
[1:07:06] the homosexual side standing up for
[1:07:08] hamas and which in their religion
[1:07:10] they actually kill homosexuals right you
[1:07:13] see you see all these things and
[1:07:14] it's so stupid it's just like they bring
[1:07:16] in barabbas and jesus
[1:07:18] and they're choosing barabbas and we see
[1:07:19] that again in this day that they're
[1:07:21] choosing barabbas again
[1:07:22] openly and just to us as believers we
[1:07:25] look at and we say this is nonsense this
[1:07:27] is just ridiculous at what they would be
[1:07:29] doing but when you look back at you look
[1:07:30] at barabbas a murderer thief
[1:07:32] the worst criminal that they had
[1:07:33] compared to jesus and the great things
[1:07:35] that he done that they chose and cried
[1:07:36] out
[1:07:37] for barabbas and we see it again in this
[1:07:39] day
[1:07:40] and we just we just say again come quo
[1:07:43] come quickly lord jesus
[1:07:44] amen amen do you love the lord this
[1:07:47] evening
[1:07:48] amen didn't mean to get off topic there
[1:07:50] for a few moments but just something
[1:07:51] that just
[1:07:52] just come to me thought we'd share and
[1:07:54] brother branham goes on he says and he
[1:07:55] died until the sun got ashamed of itself
[1:07:57] he died until nature got ashamed
[1:07:59] and it failed to operate he said the sun
[1:08:02] went down in the middle of the day and
[1:08:03] the stars wouldn't come out
[1:08:04] he died until the elements was so black
[1:08:06] you couldn't see your hand before you in
[1:08:08] the middle of the day he says imagine
[1:08:09] nature
[1:08:10] said let me die with him he said brother
[1:08:12] then the devil he sent his precious soul
[1:08:14] to the bottomless pits of hell and there
[1:08:16] the gates open
[1:08:17] he said but he come out on the third day
[1:08:19] conquered it he said amen his seed
[1:08:22] shall possess the gates of the enemy he
[1:08:23] said he conquered death he conquered
[1:08:25] hell
[1:08:26] and on that easter first easter morning
[1:08:28] he conquered the grave and he says and
[1:08:29] now we
[1:08:30] stand more than conquerors through him
[1:08:33] who loved us amen do you believe that
[1:08:34] this morning
[1:08:35] or this evening so we see that we become
[1:08:37] more than conquerors
[1:08:39] through him who loved us so we see that
[1:08:41] jesus went to the grave he conquered
[1:08:43] death
[1:08:43] hell in the grave and as you and i will
[1:08:45] conquer that in the rapture is that
[1:08:47] right
[1:08:47] and death and hell will be defeated so
[1:08:50] john wanted or
[1:08:50] it was defeated then is that right john
[1:08:53] 1 4
[1:08:54] in him was life and the life was the
[1:08:56] light of men
[1:08:57] now we see that through jesus christ
[1:09:00] there's no other person that did
[1:09:02] in the scripture in history that did
[1:09:03] what jesus did is that right
[1:09:05] you look at muhammad and he's still at
[1:09:07] his grave is that right
[1:09:08] there were no guards that muhammad's
[1:09:10] grave to keep him from coming back alive
[1:09:12] and
[1:09:12] and i love you know i heard one time a
[1:09:14] minister speaking
[1:09:15] you know that when they when they when
[1:09:18] they buried jesus
[1:09:19] you know they talked about the disciples
[1:09:21] coming back and stealing them and you
[1:09:22] know they were they were
[1:09:24] they were spreading this but but how
[1:09:25] powerful of a man he had to be
[1:09:28] that they would actually guard his grave
[1:09:29] that he was so powerful they would
[1:09:31] actually believe that he
[1:09:32] if anybody could raise from the dead it
[1:09:33] could be this one is that right
[1:09:36] so we see that that's how what power he
[1:09:38] had that people could see in his life
[1:09:40] you know if you were to look at you were
[1:09:41] looking to go in a cemetery today you
[1:09:43] don't see anybody guard in a grave
[1:09:44] that somebody could come back is that
[1:09:46] right because they don't hold that
[1:09:48] power but when one come with that power
[1:09:50] they knew that it was real is that right
[1:09:53] now as believers in this day as sons and
[1:09:55] daughters of god we ought to believe
[1:09:58] and know that god has given us the
[1:10:00] strength through his holy spirit
[1:10:02] amen what christ had in fullness we have
[1:10:04] in measure is that right
[1:10:06] where christ had the ability to do
[1:10:07] certain things you and i now have that
[1:10:09] in measure do you believe that
[1:10:11] so that means that anything that christ
[1:10:13] anything that was that was a promise
[1:10:15] to the bride of jesus christ is the is
[1:10:19] is able for us to do is that right
[1:10:21] i believe brother branham says we may
[1:10:22] not have the power to do it but we have
[1:10:24] the authority is that right
[1:10:26] to call on that power as sons and
[1:10:28] daughters of god we have the
[1:10:30] authority to use the word of god to
[1:10:32] defeat the devil at any time do you
[1:10:34] believe that
[1:10:36] now we see that as sons and daughters of
[1:10:38] god not only
[1:10:39] do we have this this authority but we
[1:10:41] have a great responsibility with
[1:10:42] it to represent christ in this day
[1:10:46] you know if anybody's going to see
[1:10:48] christ in this day it's going to be
[1:10:49] looking at you and i is that right
[1:10:52] that is we are to be witnesses of the
[1:10:54] father in this day
[1:10:56] now we look many times and and
[1:10:59] and i'm going to be closing just here in
[1:11:00] just a few minutes i know it wasn't very
[1:11:02] long but
[1:11:03] it's just a little thought that was
[1:11:04] given to us and just pray that it would
[1:11:05] be blessing you in some way now
[1:11:07] and we look at moses when he come to the
[1:11:08] red sea he says now in our pilgrim
[1:11:10] journey we notice that out in the
[1:11:11] wilderness
[1:11:12] why they began to sin after god had
[1:11:15] blessed them
[1:11:16] and brought them through the red sea
[1:11:17] said isn't it strange though that the
[1:11:19] children of israel on their journey god
[1:11:20] led them
[1:11:21] and the first thing right into the death
[1:11:23] trap he said right up to the red sea and
[1:11:25] pharaoh's army coming and pursuing he
[1:11:27] says there's mountains on one side and
[1:11:28] the sea had them cut off
[1:11:30] but god's camp went through the sea he
[1:11:32] said many times god's let us
[1:11:33] god lets us get dried up like that then
[1:11:36] he looked down through the pillar of
[1:11:38] fire and the sea rolled back and they
[1:11:39] went across he said god
[1:11:41] made a way of escape he always will in
[1:11:44] every instant are you thankful for that
[1:11:46] he said notice they went straight right
[1:11:48] ahead through the wilderness and
[1:11:49] into the wilderness to sin he said isn't
[1:11:51] that strange from one trial
[1:11:53] to another he said some through the
[1:11:54] water some through the floods some
[1:11:56] through deep trials but all
[1:11:58] through the blood are you thankful for
[1:11:59] the blood of jesus christ today
[1:12:01] that that every sin that we have that we
[1:12:04] have been caused to commit or
[1:12:05] that was committed that he would wash it
[1:12:07] completely away that it would no longer
[1:12:09] be attached to you and i is that right
[1:12:11] i believe i've heard it said before it's
[1:12:13] not that he turns us a new chapter but
[1:12:14] he gets us a completely new book is that
[1:12:16] right
[1:12:17] that everything that was contributed to
[1:12:19] you or attributed to you is now laid
[1:12:20] back
[1:12:21] on the accuser do you believe that amen
[1:12:24] many times
[1:12:25] we look at it and we say there's no way
[1:12:26] that i can do it but it's through christ
[1:12:28] that we can do all things amen
[1:12:33] do you love the lord this evening
[1:12:38] amen isaiah 35 8 and a highway
[1:12:41] shall be there and and away and it shall
[1:12:43] be called the way of holiness and the
[1:12:45] unclean shall not pass over it
[1:12:47] but it shall be for those the wayfaring
[1:12:49] men though fools
[1:12:50] shall not enter therein he always makes
[1:12:53] a way
[1:12:54] now we look here and we see that when
[1:12:57] when jesus
[1:12:58] came and he made a way for us to get
[1:13:00] back to the father is that right
[1:13:02] it wasn't to get back to a religion or a
[1:13:04] belief but it was to get back to god is
[1:13:06] that right
[1:13:07] and that should be the main focus of
[1:13:10] every believer it's not to do this or
[1:13:11] not to do that
[1:13:12] but it's to get back to him as the bride
[1:13:15] of jesus christ that's what we ought to
[1:13:17] be focused
[1:13:18] on is getting back to him now you look
[1:13:21] in
[1:13:21] in today's time and and i begin to look
[1:13:24] at religion and
[1:13:25] and where it's going and the things that
[1:13:27] they agree with and what i would call
[1:13:28] modern day religion and
[1:13:30] and even in message churches not only in
[1:13:32] in denominational churches but in
[1:13:34] message churches and in in maybe even
[1:13:36] our own lives maybe outside of church
[1:13:38] and we look and we say what is the goal
[1:13:40] here you know what what is the goal
[1:13:42] why would you be a partaker of this
[1:13:44] religion if you're not going to follow
[1:13:45] through with jesus christ if you believe
[1:13:47] in the bible why would you want to take
[1:13:48] this part out
[1:13:49] and this part out and just say well this
[1:13:51] is for us and this is for us but
[1:13:53] you want the full benefits of god you
[1:13:55] want you've got to take the full word of
[1:13:56] god is that right
[1:13:58] i believe it was henry ford that said
[1:14:00] and i'm just going to throw this in
[1:14:01] there he says whether you think you can
[1:14:03] or you can't
[1:14:04] either way you're right and so i'm not
[1:14:06] one of those and you
[1:14:07] you hear a lot of ministers say that
[1:14:09] this is not just a positive thinking
[1:14:11] right they say this is not just positive
[1:14:13] preaching or or that
[1:14:14] and i'm not saying that that's wrong or
[1:14:16] anything but we should as christians we
[1:14:18] should have a positive outlook
[1:14:19] we've been given the fullness of the
[1:14:21] word we've been given the fullness of
[1:14:22] the godhead bodily jesus christ we've
[1:14:24] been given the holy ghost
[1:14:25] so everything that he was in the
[1:14:27] fullness we are now in measure so we
[1:14:29] should have a positive outlook on life
[1:14:31] that whenever sickness comes we can pray
[1:14:33] and ask the father anything in his name
[1:14:35] and he will give it to us is that right
[1:14:37] that if sickness or trials or anything
[1:14:39] comes we can go to the father we can go
[1:14:41] to the throne
[1:14:42] and we can ask anything in his name and
[1:14:44] he would give it to us but we've got to
[1:14:45] have faith
[1:14:46] to believe that he will do it do you
[1:14:48] believe that
[1:14:49] amen so we see here um and brother
[1:14:52] brahem says in awakening jesus he says
[1:14:54] well here is where he
[1:14:55] challenged the proof he says he that
[1:14:57] believeth on me
[1:14:59] the things that i do he says in other
[1:15:01] words you will be an amateur messiah
[1:15:03] messiah he said that's exactly right he
[1:15:06] says for his life
[1:15:07] if it be in you it ain't you it's him he
[1:15:10] said see
[1:15:11] you ordained to carry his work on do you
[1:15:14] believe that
[1:15:14] i i like that he says you're ordained to
[1:15:17] carry his work on and that means you
[1:15:19] were chosen you were
[1:15:20] you were for ordained predestinated to
[1:15:22] carry on the work of jesus
[1:15:24] christ amen we're not here to point
[1:15:26] people to a prophet we're not here to
[1:15:27] point people to a church or point
[1:15:29] people to a pastor we're here to point
[1:15:31] people to jesus christ you believe that
[1:15:34] amen i'll close just with this just in a
[1:15:36] few minutes and
[1:15:37] i put this quote in from charles
[1:15:39] spurgeon just because i liked it so much
[1:15:40] he said if
[1:15:41] if salvation had been by works our lord
[1:15:43] could have not said to the man
[1:15:45] the thief dying at his side today thou
[1:15:47] shalt be with me in paradise
[1:15:49] he said that man could do no works his
[1:15:51] hands and feet were fastened to the
[1:15:52] cross he was in all agonies of death
[1:15:54] he said no it must be by grace all
[1:15:58] conquering grace amen do you love the
[1:16:00] lord this evening
[1:16:01] so we can't say well this one does this
[1:16:03] or this one does that we are all on an
[1:16:05] equal playing field of grace
[1:16:07] it's that unmerited unfavoring grace or
[1:16:09] unwavering grace that jesus would come
[1:16:12] and do this for us
[1:16:13] hebrews 9 8 the holy ghost this signify
[1:16:16] that the way into the holiest of all was
[1:16:18] not yet made manifest
[1:16:20] while the first tabernacle was yet
[1:16:22] standing which was a figure for the time
[1:16:24] then present
[1:16:26] in which we were offered both gifts and
[1:16:28] sacrifices that could not make him
[1:16:30] that did the service perfect as
[1:16:32] pertaining to the
[1:16:34] conscience he said which stood only in
[1:16:36] meats and drinks and diverse washing and
[1:16:39] cardinal ordinances
[1:16:40] imposed on them until the time of
[1:16:42] reformation
[1:16:43] but christ being come as a high priest
[1:16:46] of good things to come
[1:16:48] by a greater and more perfect tabernacle
[1:16:50] not made with hands
[1:16:52] that is to say not of this building
[1:16:54] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:16:56] but by his own blood he entered in once
[1:16:59] into the holy place having obtained
[1:17:01] eternal redemption for us
[1:17:03] he said for if the blood of bulls and
[1:17:05] goats and the ashes of a heifer and
[1:17:07] sprinkling the unclean
[1:17:08] sanctifieth to the purifying of flesh
[1:17:10] how much more shall the blood of christ
[1:17:13] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:17:15] him without spot to god
[1:17:17] to purge your conscience from dead works
[1:17:20] to serve the living god
[1:17:21] are you thankful for that i believe the
[1:17:23] scripture said he entered in once
[1:17:25] because that's all we needed was one
[1:17:27] time and that was abolished sin
[1:17:28] that abolished death that conquered hell
[1:17:31] death the grave
[1:17:32] everything he conquered it at calvary do
[1:17:34] you believe that
[1:17:35] amen do you love the lord this evening
[1:17:38] and we'll go ahead and have the
[1:17:38] musicians come if they would and
[1:17:40] i know it's been short but i pray
[1:17:42] something was said that would just bless
[1:17:44] your heart tonight and
[1:17:46] and i would want to read just another
[1:17:47] quote here in the paradox if i could and
[1:17:50] now he says here stands a group of
[1:17:52] people to be prayed for he says now we
[1:17:54] realize if the scripture is true
[1:17:55] and the god of heaven who could create a
[1:17:57] squirrel could create a ram
[1:17:59] and could stop the sun for a whole day
[1:18:00] for 24 hours they could keep
[1:18:02] fire from burning people in a furnace
[1:18:04] for three hours he could stop the mouth
[1:18:06] of lions he could raise the dead could
[1:18:08] walk on water
[1:18:09] could take biscuits and feed five
[1:18:11] thousand he said
[1:18:12] that though that's the word made flesh
[1:18:15] in human beings he says now
[1:18:16] does everybody understand that he said
[1:18:18] now the same god that promised that
[1:18:20] in the last days these things would
[1:18:22] reoccur again
[1:18:24] he said but he cannot do it until
[1:18:25] there's somebody he can work them with
[1:18:27] and work on he said you see what i mean
[1:18:30] he says now let's believe that
[1:18:31] emphatically
[1:18:32] with all our hearts that it's going to
[1:18:34] be this way
[1:18:35] and so god or what brother braden is
[1:18:37] saying here is that that jesus
[1:18:39] has done these things and he's needing
[1:18:42] human beings
[1:18:42] in this day to do those same things
[1:18:45] again is that right
[1:18:46] and so we see that as believers as sons
[1:18:48] and daughters of god
[1:18:50] if we are to be christ-like we have to
[1:18:52] first have faith in his word is that
[1:18:54] right
[1:18:55] we have to believe that everything that
[1:18:56] god spoke everything that christ spoke
[1:18:58] in his word we have the authority as
[1:19:01] believers
[1:19:02] to use that in this day do you believe
[1:19:04] that
[1:19:05] and i'll finish with this just as you
[1:19:07] played something softly before we pray
[1:19:09] said joshua stopped the sun the s-u-n by
[1:19:12] faith
[1:19:13] he said but blind bartimaeus stopped the
[1:19:14] s-o-n by faith
[1:19:16] and that same faith will bring him from
[1:19:18] glory where he controls the solar system
[1:19:21] in the universe it will bring him down
[1:19:23] to this tabernacle tonight
[1:19:25] that same childlike faith so we see that
[1:19:29] i don't want to focus on the needs or
[1:19:31] what your situation is or what your
[1:19:33] what your trial is or or what your
[1:19:35] sickness is
[1:19:37] but if you have that same childlike
[1:19:39] faith it can bring him down tonight we
[1:19:41] don't look
[1:19:42] at the trial or the circumstance of the
[1:19:44] situation because
[1:19:46] if we have christ that doesn't matter
[1:19:49] right
[1:19:50] he can conquer it he's already conquered
[1:19:52] it at calvary
[1:19:53] but we've got to be able to come and be
[1:19:54] able to get in his presence
[1:19:56] so much that we can let him overshadow
[1:19:58] our life and control our life that
[1:20:00] our situations and our and and our goals
[1:20:03] and our family would be led
[1:20:05] completely by him do you believe that
[1:20:08] amen we certainly want to move ourselves
[1:20:12] aside so that that the lord could come
[1:20:14] and be in control of our life
[1:20:17] and that he could completely lead us
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:20] amen maybe if you have a need tonight as
[1:20:22] we just bow our heads maybe just put it
[1:20:23] before the lord this evening
[1:20:28] amen just ask him just to come and meet
[1:20:29] your need and
[1:20:31] maybe you have a family situation or a
[1:20:33] sickness or
[1:20:34] or something special just something dear
[1:20:36] to your heart that you just like to ask
[1:20:38] the lord and
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:41] as we pray just just believe that what
[1:20:44] you ask in his name that he will give to
[1:20:46] you
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:49] dear lord we just come before you this
[1:20:51] evening
[1:20:53] lord we know lord just the message was
[1:20:54] just a little chopped up and
[1:20:56] just real quick but but god just as a as
[1:20:59] a reminder to us as believers and sons
[1:21:02] and daughters of god that you are the
[1:21:03] way
[1:21:05] lord that when we get distracted by the
[1:21:07] things of the world and
[1:21:09] the things that are going on around us
[1:21:12] or that we can just center our lives
[1:21:14] back and focus in on you
[1:21:17] lord that you will lead us and guide us
[1:21:20] lord in the way that you have
[1:21:21] you have chosen for our lives to be
[1:21:27] lord i pray for the those that if they
[1:21:30] they be sick lord if they be listening
[1:21:32] god i pray to send healing power while
[1:21:34] the word goes forth lord that
[1:21:36] your your healing power would go and
[1:21:38] just touch them
[1:21:42] lord if we if we ask anything in your
[1:21:46] name lord your word says
[1:21:48] if we ask anything and we believe it
[1:21:50] lord it shall be given to us
[1:21:54] lord if there's people struggling with
[1:21:55] financial situations god we pray you
[1:21:57] just bless them
[1:21:58] your word says you've never seen a son
[1:22:01] or daughter begging bread
[1:22:02] [Music]

[1:22:43] pull our faith together tonight

[1:22:48] our eyes on the goal
