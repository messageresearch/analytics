to uh again let you know that uh we'll be traveling to Sister Carol's funeral and so I won't be here Wednesday but brother Joel will be here I know there'll be some others traveling as well so keep them in your prayers and then um there's a couple of meetings coming up and I mentioned these because uh these churches have been very helpful to us in our annual meetings in traveling uh and being here with us and that's in Pony Oklahoma and it's about a six-h hour trip so I know many of you won't be able to make it but if you are able to go uh i' sure appreciate you being there I I've got to preach at that meeting so I I'm not looking forward to it maybe as much as I would normally but we normally go but uh but as far as I I do always enjoy the meetings it's always a wonderful time but brother Shawn Martin will be there preaching as well and brother Jonathan Martin so the meetings will be wonderful so other than hearing me it'd be a good meeting for you to go to and uh so we would uh you know if you can make it and then that's September 11th through 15th and then um Galina meetings that happen every year and that church just shows up uh for our meetings that's only uh two and a half three hours away by Branson and so that their annual meetings are the 25th to the 29th so maybe you could make it to one of those and if you can I'm sure it'll be a blessing to you Genesis Chapter 18 and verse one says then the L uh Lord appeared to him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day that's all we'll read for now let's uh Lord at his Blessing to the word you may be seated Abraham had been on his journey for a long time he was 75 when God called him and at this point he's almost hundred years old he's old older than the oldest person sitting here this morning and at this point he had no idea when he would have that baby none it could be another 25 years it could be another 50 years he didn't know yeah and I'm sure you know every sign pointed against it because at this point also his body had not been changed back and so he was waiting there and and I'm sure that people come to him and Brandon put it this way that he'd taken on the name of of Abraham God had changed his name from Abram to Abraham and Abraham means father of Nations father of Nations and people probably come by and laughed at him said how many children do you have now Abraham how many children do you have now and the truth was that uh he still didn't have the promised son and yet and and it become a pressure on him and I'll say this this morning that when you take on the name of being a Christian there's a certain amount of pressure that comes with that there's a certain amount of the world of expectations that comes with that maybe you're waiting on things in your life to line up with the confession that you're making but just hold on because God if he promised it in his word he will do it for you and you got to hold on to that don't don't get discouraged because things haven't turned out out exactly like you wanted them to all at the front you got to hold on sometimes you just got to keep coming and keep coming and keep coming and one day there's a revelation that comes one day you meet God on the plains of mamory yes sir oh my and then you begin to realize oh it's coming real soon it's happening right away but up to this point every sign pointed against it and the more Revelation that Abraham received the more pressure he was put under because it seemed like that he could never meet or match the the promise that he was given and I'll say that we can never change our own bodies we can never produce a rapture we can never do that on our own it'll take a supernatural move of God it'll take God doing it himself in our lives we can't do that we won't see our loved ones again just based on our own efforts we're not going to be able to do that it'll take God to do that but just hold on to the promises morning hold on to the promise he gave you we will not all sleep but we shall all be changed that's a promise that he gave us just like he gave to Abraham oh my but the Bible says that he staggered not at the word of God through unbelief he went right ahead making ready keeping all the booties ready and the bird eyye that's I think a baby food actually and everything he was going to have the baby and and and H correct me later if that's wrong he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God that word staggered implies a mental struggle yes right but he didn't give in to it come on he felt it but he didn't give in it he he he had those thoughts like you would what if it isn't true right what if there's a problem what what if what if I'm just unable to do it he had those thoughts we know he did because even when he received the promise first Abraham laughed then Sarah laughed we know that they weren't perfect people we know they didn't just always but he staggered not means he never gave in to that doubt that was there he never gave in he will always and the Bible say he was strong in faith that word strong actually implies an increasing strength that the longer it was which should have weakened his faith but the longer he waited on the promise he got stronger church he didn't get weaker he got stronger and I believe that's the same way Abraham's seed is here today the more we wait the longer we wait the more it seems like it's it's it's farther off it's farther off we're farther down the road than we ever thought we'd be the world is worse than we ever thought it would be and yet we're strong in faith as strong now Caleb said I'm as strong now as I was 40 years ago it may seem like it's it's gotten worse it may seem like things are worse but we've been getting stronger and being fully persuaded what he had promised he was able also to perform now Abraham would receive one last sign before his body change look at Genesis 18:1 the Lord appeared notice three things notice who appeared yeah the Lord appeared when no noce where it happened in the plains of mammory yes and when it happened in the heat of the day these things are important I believe it's instructive to us Genesis 12:7 tells us and this is the first time the Lord appeared to Abraham it's that same language the Lord capital L O R D appeared unto Abram said unto thy seed will I give this land and there builded he an altar unto the Lord who appeared unto him Genesis 17 we've talked about this he he appeared to him again when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram said to him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect look and and he he he appeared now appear is to show it Den notes the act of seeing in a literal and a figurative sense so he perceived that the Lord was there now the Lord appears in a lot of different ways he appeared to Abram maybe in a vision maybe he appeared in a dream maybe he appeared in a in a wind or Whirlwind or a pillar of fire but in in this instance in Genesis 18 he appears in in a man yes he appears in the flesh of a man Genesis 18:2 he lifted up his eyes and looked and all three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground notice what he says and he said my Lord my Lord now remember he got the Revelation in Genesis 17 of who God was of God's name you say well that's not important whether you believe in the one God or three gods or 10 Gods it is important because he got a revelation of God's name in Genesis 17 Genesis 18 He said my Lord he said if now I have found faith favor in thy sight pass not away notice he wants to keep him there he wants to entertain him he said pass not away and he said I pray thee from thy servant now if you watch that 18th chapter immediately after the change name God Appears to reveal himself in flesh after the name is made known who he is God Appears in flesh Abraham one a hot day just a few weeks or months before Sodom was burned and Isaac come on the SE and Abraham is sitting out under his Oak and we'll get to that in just a moment but that the plains of mamory better translation is actually the oak tree of mamory and so lot is down in Sodom and they're enjoying the pleasures of the world yet he's Pastor lot probably had him a nice little congregation down there but Abraham after he had been revealed to him Elohim was who he had been talking to him so now he'd been talking to God all this time but now in Revelation or in Genesis 17 he says I am I am Elohim I am the almighty God right I am I'm the Old and New Testament I'm I'm All Abraham that you'll ever need and so he's revealed to him in that way and now he comes and oh my he's sitting under the Oak and here comes three men three men now walking like human beings and the effect of the revelation of who God was that he it had upon Abraham what it did to him was after his name was changed from Abram to Abraham he seen three men coming and he called the three one my Lord three of them being one not so with with lot he saw two coming he said my lords but Abraham's Vision Revelation showed him he was the all-sufficient Elohim and brother BR said his seed is to receive the same thing I want you to understand this said brother Ben how does this matter to my life I want you young people to understand this I want you this message was not about telling us who brother brandham was it was about telling us who a prophet was or who God was rather it wasn't about telling us who a prophet was although we needed to know that but it was about telling us who God was and who was God God was all sufficient God was Elohim so before he could receive his body change he had to receive a message of headship a message of authority a message that says I am the almighty God I still care about your body I still care about about healing I still care that's what he he come in with healing in his wings and healing revivals and said I still care about you I still oh my aren't you glad that he did he' come in Revival and showed us that he cared but he come revealing the secrets of the heart showing us that he was still God and he was showing us something he was saying he said Abraham I'm God and and I'm I'm big enough to change your body I'm big enough to keep you through Leo deia I'm big enough to take care of you big enough to take care of your children yes huh let's just be real we're real people this morning I the greatest challenge we have you see all these young people sitting on the front row and the second row and the third row and the back rows all these kids scattered throughout the church at the challenge and we live in a in a terrible age to grow up in right it's a terrible confused mixed up age and yet that we serve an almighty God we had to have a revelation that this message was sufficient that that God was going to give us a a message that was more than a man but it would be something that would give us a revelation of who he was of his sufficiency of his willingness to help of his willingness to be there of his of his presence in the age so he was the all-sufficient Elohim and so that challenge is that we can get you from from where you are and and and if the Lord carries in my generation if it doesn't come in my generation it'll come in yours if it doesn't come in yours it'll come in the next but I really believe the world can't go that much longer so how if we do have time to get these children raised how do we get them raised how do we get them to believe God how do we get them to to do that and it's not a matter of convincing it's not a matter of even teaching although we want to teach all that we can but we need them to meet God all right come on and we believe that God come down in our age and showed us that he still wanted to meet with us he didn't just want us to know him as an abstract thought he didn't want us to just know him as a as a as a God who was in in print but he wanted us to know him as a God in flesh a God In My Flesh a God in your flesh that's how he wanted to reveal himself to Abraham before the body changed oh my oh there's a great truth here and if your kids ever recognize that God is in flesh see if they can see God in you it's going to be a whole lot easier come on church that many times the reason the kids back sit and and begin to leave is because they didn't see God in the parish but if they can see God in you they'll begin to begin to come back to the Lord and begin to realize hey there is a God there there is a there is a love there there's some people who no matter what happens they're going to serve God anyway they need to see God in flesh and that's what this message is about you can talk you can tell them all about what God did through a prophet but unless they see God in flesh what that little story brother brandom told about the little boy that was caught in the storm or he was in his bedroom and the Storm come on he run in his mama's room and she said don't you believe that God will take care of you he said yeah but I want a god with skin on him that's right God in flesh that's the the Revelation he gave Abraham yeah oh God help us to be that today yes and I know I'm taking a slow this morning but that's that is the challenge of this hour it's not to build churches it's not to it's not to promote Ministries but it's to be God in flesh not in a sense of of taking the authority and saying I'm God and I can do this no but to represent God to a world that needs God Amen to children that need God yes and you young people you got to meet him you got to meet him for yourself but I want to represent him to you and your parents and all of us want to do that now look he said Lord capital l r d any scholar knows that Elohim the all sufficient one a man said to me one time you don't believe that was God he said I sure do Abraham said it was God he talked to him he should know he he does all through there Abraham refers to him as the Lord he said you mean God is standing there eating that flesh of the calf and drinking the milk from the cow and eating cornbread praise God if God can eat cornbread I can too you know Jesus is the bread of life right that's why I can't stay on a low carb diet very long you know I'm just messing with you he didn't say he was the diet Slim Fast of life you know come on you can laugh he ate cornbread God did God church we make God sometimes so you know oh we want to we want to have this this God that we present to our children is you better not mess up you better not God ate cornbread probably poured milk in it CU that's when cornbread's best you know pour your milk and your cornbread but the Bill's getting hungry eat that at night God come down ate cornbread they killed the calf for him he ate the calf he ate steaks cornbread that's good God come down Fellowship just like we did at our house last night with a few of the brothers and we're sitting there fellowshipping God came down to Abraham just like that just like we do over here in the fellowship hall just like we do many times for the trip on Sunday night or we get together we Fellowship together what are we doing oh church God came down to Abraham just like that and all Abraham saw all a normal person would see is men walking it's just three men but Abraham could see beyond that because God's giv him such a revelation of who he was that he recognized there was something different about this one man he said that's God that just p and made a body of Flesh yes I said he did it he said he said why don't you just know our he said why you just don't know our God why he could reach over look at the power of almighty God he take a handful of dust reach over and take a handful of dust brother we're made out of 16 elements petroleum Cosmic light potach different elements and calcium and he said just caught it together breathed into it so God to make a body all he had to do pick up a handful of dust and he has a body you think he can heal your body all he had to do was to make a body was that's it now look and and and and he walked down in the earth I'm so glad he's that sort of a father he said though the skin worms destroys this body yet he'll call you he promised he'll do it he's Elohim he jerked another handful and said come here woodworm or whoever it was the Angels come down let's let's go down and look at Sodom and see what's going on and Abraham after the Revelation he'd seen it and he knew that there was one God and he seen it he said my Lord come aside sit down let me wash your feet it was the Lord who appeared and and we find that again in Genesis 18:13 and I'm going to go back and forth a lot in this in this 18th chapter Lord willing uh in future weeks but the Lord said to Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have assurity bear a child Jam old who said that the Lord said it right brother you'll hear Brother brand say that wasn't me that was him yeah right the Lord revealed the secrets of the hearts this was God in a flesh body revealing the secret of Sarah's heart and we're told that that would happen again in Luke 17:28 it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed the son of man the son of man not the Son of God he's been the Son of God all down through the church ages but now he's going to reveal himself as a son of man like he did to Abraham and time when lot was in Sodom and the fire was about to fall it was fulfilled in our day and God come down made the secrets of the hearts known and we'll get more into that as we uh maybe get further into this chapter and we know that that was one to a generation how many know that today and and and again we'll get further into it but brother BR said you might not be able to do this we have one of them in one generation one of them in one generation he said there was one Moses the rest of them just believe what he said again he said I don't say you're Pastor anybody would would take the gift to discernment they don't have to do that that's not their calling it's not they calling to do that to be one in an age one in an age so I don't have a pressure here to reveal the secrets of your heart we've already seen that but you see God moved in that part of his body to do that he he became flesh in that part of his body to do that what will he become flesh in my body to do well if I'm called to be a pastor he'll become flesh in my body to be a pastor he'll become flesh in your body maybe to be a housewife maybe to be a factory worker maybe to be a dad maybe to be a mom maybe to be a young person on fire for the Lord he becomes flesh in your body come on all right huh you said that's getting out there wait just a minute and I'll show it to you he wants to be revealed in your flesh not just one man now the son of man was revealed in the flesh of a prophet and so because he was a prophet he did what the Bible said he would do he was the prophet to the age when the son of man who is the word how many know that this morning the son of man is the word it's more important than you think it is and it matters more to our lives than we think it does the son of man who is the word when he's expressed in your life he he will produce reproduce the word in your life right come on now right he'll reproduce the word what does that look like he'll reproduce love joy peace longsuffering gentleness Faith right he reproduces that that don't mean you'll look like other message people that's not what that means at all it means you look like Christ huh we may have a message culture but that's not what we're called to we're called to look like Christ we're called to be Christ to the generation we live in Lord help me to be that and and if if the culture of the church doesn't agree with the word we go with the word if the culture of the message doesn't agree with the word we go with the word we don't do what what everybody else does we don't have to follow what everybody else does we follow the word because it's the son of man that come in our age and revealed himself sir he revealed him oh Church aren't you glad he did he revealed himself in our age Hallelujah he wants to reveal himself in your flesh as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as the days of lot modern Billy Graham and or Roberts it's those two a two other Angels yeah right men like them or Roberts Billy Graham went down to Sodom preached them sodomites blinded their eyes with the gospel one Angel stayed back messenger with Abraham and the elected group what kind of sign did he do what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him watch will be manifested in his bride yeah yeah in the last days yes sir hallelujah amen what is the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you he wants to be Christ in me Christ in you and what God did through a prophet in our generation is show us how possible that was right what was he doing to Abraham he was showing him oh God he was showing him that there was there was a reality to what he was about to experience he said Abraham it's time and a message come God come down our generation revealed the sign of the son of man to show us it's time it's time to become God in flesh but again I don't want you to overthink that yeah see God in flesh in your flesh may not go out and speak to every storm right because you're just part of the body yeah right he may use one member to speak to the storm but he may use you to comfort your children yeah to take care of your house yeah huh to do your work to support the church to to to help out to to clean the wash the dishes that may be God in flesh comfort those who need comforting yeah and you say well and you always know see when when we do what the word says then it's God in flesh and when it's not it's just flesh right cuz we still got that part right that that that flesh body that come to Abraham that was not born of a woman but brother Brandon was born of a woman right and I was born of a woman and so I've got a sticky nature and I and I'll say things and do things that aren't right but but when God is speaking when when I surrender to God God will always do what's right are you with me now so that's not Jesus wasn't Jesus talking to Abraham it was it was Christ it was pre-incarnate Christ but Jesus that what we think of as Jesus the son and not had been born but it was a man in human flesh and Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing as Jesus said well as it was in the days of Sodom watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church but the bride is called and that day the son of man will be revealed what to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride he said the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together he said the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman he said do you see what I mean his son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his word so real it'll unite the church and him as one the bribe and then she'll go home to the wedding supper she's already United he said we go to the wedding supper not the marriage he said because the marriage of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they to become one he said and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again what did he tell John in Revelation chapter 10:8 he said prophesy again what does it do it manifests the word again not his part of the word our portion of the word yes sir are you with me now yeah it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing so that's who appeared who was it it was God himself where did he appear he appears in the plains of memory Abraham was only here because he gave lot his choice and lot went to Sodom I want you to know that a prophet in our day even had to make a choice you got to make a choice right yes now let me be very clear to you I believe in predestination I believe in election but you got to make a choice right the Bible says choose you this day whom you will serve as for me in my house we will serve the Lord you got to make that choice you you can't stay in the valley of decision forever you got to make a choice and and he told the prophet because you've chosen the Narrow Path the harder way you walked of your own choosing that picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way because of this momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits see what a glorious decision I made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous Victory and love divine what is that that is a choice that Prophet had to make God knew he would make it but he had to make it and you've got to make it and Abraham had to make it and when he made his choice and and allowed lot to go his way and he took the harder Road he become a candidate then for a body change God already knew he would do it but Abraham had to make a choice see the son of man is only revealed in you when you choose the harder path are you with me I wish I had a little bit more I've been I've been sick and I kind of that's my excuse this morning but I I have two reasons why it's difficult to breathe I'm fat and I'm and I've been sick but he made a choice are you hearing me today you got to make a choice and it's the choice that determines whether the son of man will be revealed in your life yes it's the choice that you make it's a choice I'm going to I'm going to go to church I'm not going to let people keep me out of the House of God I'm not going to let complexes keep me out of the house of God that's a choice that you got to make like Abraham made he said I'm going to go to church I'm going to serve God I'm going to do what's right I'm not going down there in Sodom I'm going to believe the message of the hour people might laugh at me people might think I'm funny and I dress funny and I look funny but I made a choice I'm going to serve God with all of my heart oh how many have made that choice this morning I'm going to serve God I'm going to love him with all of my heart I'm going to do do what the Bible says I'm going to follow the word you've got to make that choice and then the son of man begins to be revealed now the son of man is the word and the Word was revealed through a prophet but the word is also revealed through your life as you live now BR said the very day the son of man is revealed Revelation 10 1-7 he said read it when you get home the seventh Angel's message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man the messenger is revealing the son of man so brother Brandon was not the son of man he very emphatically said that if somebody teaches that it's just wrong he's not the son of man he's the a son of man revealing the son of man he said but the messenger is revealing the son of man he said can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shuck he can't organize it it's the grain itself again the son of man revealed in the seventh angel now the son of man revealed in Preachers well it's hard to swallow but it's true but also in teachers and pastors and evangelists and Housewives yeah all right Factory workers yeah huh even construction workers used car salesman I couldn't think of a worse occupation so we just I'm sorry if you're a used car salesman Joel used to be one they can be saved it's the son of man revealed in oh Church revealed in Gabe revealed in Millie revealed in their children the son of man revealed in a life that had hardship but now you see something begin to come from it the son of man revealed in in Isaac Catherine aren't here today but they're I know they're they they've gone through a lot but the son of man revealed in Isaac and cathine the son of man revealed in Sister Luella and sister lilan the son of man revealed in a pastor the son of man revealed in the congregation are you with me now the son of man wanted to reveal himself yeah in Us in Preachers and teachers and housewise and Factory workers so now I may not even get through this this morning but we can pick up next time but Yahweh this is the way the another translation puts it Yahweh which is the word the Hebrew word for God Yahweh the Lord appeared to him by The Oaks of mammory and he was sitting in the doorway of the tent at the heat of the day and I want you to understand where he was so we know who came to him and I want you to understand where he was he was he was in the right place at the right time he was under a shade tree In the Heat of the day all right this is important yeah he heard the word in the right atmosphere even though the day was hot and and this shade tree was we could say a fully restored bride tree that Abraham was sitting under brother BR said he was waiting years had passed the beauty had faded and Sarah was old and he was old and one day Abraham still keeping separated oh I love that he didn't quit his separation because he got old but he still kept his separation representing the Seed of Abraham today separated from the world called out set aside that's Christians real believing Christians set aside called out Abraham standing there on the hill things wasn't going too good he wasn't Rich he later become rich but he wasn't Rich at that time his cattle was starving lot was doing fine he was down in Sodom looked like lot made a better choice and there will be moments in your life for the land and where it looks like other people made better choices than you've made but you stay with your choice you stay with where God called you to why because you know that you're not looking at the moment you're looking for the future you're looking for your family you're looking for your children you're looking for for a body change one day you're looking for a Rapture one day it's not about today other people may have more friends today other people may have more money today other people might have bigger Church today there might be more exciting things going on but I'm not looking to today I'm looking for tomorrow I'm looking for tomorrow sir so I I made my choice you made your choice we're sitting there under the oak tree he said lot was doing fine and his daughters belong to all the societies and I my said I imagine they was just like sodomites what there they was down there in Sodom and one day while Abraham sat in the shade of the oak Oh Glory to God where his tent was pit he seen three men come walking he said there's just something about a Christian when you see Christ you can recognize the Bible tells us that we don't have time to go into it this morning but the Palmer worm and the Locust and the cankerworm and the caterpillar have eaten away excuse me fruit of God what brother the random calls the bride tree types it to that he said there were four messengers of death four messengers of life on the tree was fruits the Palmer worm be to eat away at the fruits I think I I put a slide on here for this I'm not yes the fruits of Palmer worm a brotherly kindness Joy he be to eat away at that the leaves that the Locust ate away The Fellowship of the the cooling Fellowship of the leaves and the cankerworm ate away the Doctrine which was the bark you'll find all this in restoration of the brid tree the the caterpillar ate away the pulp the life itself the spirit itself and so all these things were eaten away but the kind of tree I believe Abraham was sitting under was a restored tree that had its Spirit its life back had its Doctrine back had its Fellowship back and had its brotherly kindness and its joy and its fruits back so Abraham is sitting under the shade of of that tree and he recognizes that the one who is speaking is more than a man it's God speaking the promise of a changed body and that message become the method by which God will change his body just like this message is the method by which God will change our bodies and Genesis 18:14 says is anything too hard for the Lord all right oh I'm so glad that's the promise we have too at the time appointed I will return unto you according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son and so what happened he was sitting under the tree at the right time in the shade oh it's important that we keep the right atmosphere here in the church it's important that we pray it's important that we call out to God you say if we're just waiting on the rapture we SE our last time what what are we doing here well we're staying under the tree yeah because In the Heat of the day you need the shade of the tree you need the shade of a good gospel meeting you need the shade of being in the house of God you need the comfort of being around the people of God get ready Abraham this your last sign he said according to the time of life Sarah shall have a son noce when he appeared he appeared in the heat the heat hot out I don't mean naturally I mean spiritually the heat is on and people do one of two things in in the heat either they come together at a cooling Source or they separate see the Bible Paul being a prophet he he foresaw this he said don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another so much more as you see the day approaching as it gets hotter right he said keep going to church yeah that's simple instructions isn't it but we needed it for this day brother BR said you know when the heat of the day is on the sheep all get together and they stand against one another and they make shade for each other and they support each other yes you know and and and to do that they get together and I don't know who you know there's always a leader right and the sheep and I don't know exactly how that works but one stands somewhere and then they all just stand where that one is I don't know why there's so many Believers in Hardy Arkansas no clue but but the Sheep just tend to stand together yeah right you said well why there why not why can't everybody stand at my house come to my house and and and and be shadeed for me well sheep just tend to come together because the important thing is not where it is but that they get the the support and the shade from each other brother B said that's the way the Sheep of God should do is kind of Stand Together close places yeah close places and support one another with our faith I don't like close places I'm a little bit claustrophobic and the bigger I get the the more claustrophobic I get we went up in the arch how many have ever been in the Arch in St Louis that's a close place they put you in this little elevator but it's not really you get in this little ball and and you have to bend down to get in there and I sit in there and I'm all scrunched up like this I'm sitting like this and I that door closes and I'll be honest with you I panicked just a little bit because I thought there's nothing they can do if this thing quits working and this thing was made in the 60s I mean it's got 60s designed I thought this thing if this thing quits working I'm done I mean if it stops and you know how it kind of slows down at the end I I'd be over you you'd have a they have to put me in a home cuz I couldn't have sit there well the week after we left that thing broke down I'm reading in the paper I said Britney look at this and you think I'm bad you we didn't tell Britney how small them things were before we got on it and all five of us in one of them little pods and I thought well that's a I don't like close places but sometimes you need to get in close places uncomfortable sometimes it makes you uncomfortable to be around people but you need people you need your brothers and sisters and and so sometimes you got to support one another you got to get in a close place or you're never going to see The View and the view was tremendous by the way I recommend it I don't recommend the transportation but if you want to see it there's only one way to see it get in close places oh Church brother B said sheep are funny little creatures in one way there's another thing we might learn of sheep tonight when the weather's real hot he said did you ever see sheep they won't separate themselves one be at one place and one at another but Right In the Heat of the day the Sheep will all stand together all stand together you know what they're doing they're making shade one for the other they're having fellowship and a lot of times our response to getting hurt is to separate ourselves but that's exactly what the devil wants us to do because then that's when the wolf attacks right but when we get hurt we have to we have to risk being hurt more but that's God's method of healing oh Church listen he said I'm just trying to be a pastor this morning to help you and somebody helps me know these things he said now someone said is that necessary brother brandom it certainly is is that necessary it certainly is there's nothing like having a real good Dependable friend when the troubles are blazing and the heat's on you can go to this friend and sit down and just explain it to them talk it over in personal confidence and kneel down and pray together and know that this person is a good God saved man or woman you can put confidence in I don't think we should wait necessarily on them to come to us I think we ought to go to our friend I think that's the same way with God we need to go to our friend we need to talk to him we need we need to we need to sit down right there with him and get close to him go to a friend you say well they didn't come to me well go anyway that's it's good to do that come let us reason together say the scripture come let us Stand Together see if you want friends you got to huddle with the Sheep Bible says a man that has friends must show himself friendly but there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother I'm so glad for for Christ so glad for the Holy Ghost aren't you because when you don't have friends or it seemed like you're all alone he said I'm the Good Shepherd of the sheep and maybe you find yourself all caught off all by yourself he said I'm coming after you I'll leave the 99 and I'll come after you aren't you glad he's willing to do that today aren't you glad he's that kind of a shepherd He said I want to come after you even when you get away from the other sheep I want I still want you I still I still want to be your friend right amen Jesus told his disciples he said henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I've called you friends all things I I've have heard of my father I've made known to you br said was right In the Heat of the day yeah about 3 or 4:00 in the afternoon I suppose when the Western Sun was shining down hot there in Canaan the direct rays of that heat can raise blisters quickly so you can't sit out in that heat you get burnt he was sitting out there in the tent door with his head down perhaps studying or thinking about God he raised up his eyes and he seen three men coming oh I love this and somehow Abraham wanted to be friendly he had this experience with God out of a desire to be friendly brother Joe that's a blessing in your life that you want to go talk to people Abraham just wanted to go talk to these men it's a blessing to be hospitable it's a blessing to want and some of us are I myself I'm not a guy that wants to go do that but I realize it's necessary like like I need to reach out I need to get out beyond my shell sometimes what is it it's a blessing Abraham wanted to be friendly so he thought them fellas walk kind of strange yet Dusty from the road an ordinarily dressed and they come walking up and Abraham went out and invited them otherwise something like this s you're tired your feet must be weary he said no I have a nice shade tree here won't you come in and sit down under the shade tree I'll fetch a little water I'll wash your feet for you it'll refresh you get you a cold drink then you can go on your journey Abraham was friendly and he became God's friend did you know that the Bible calls Abraham the friend of God James 2:23 the scripture was fulfilled which says Abraham believed God and was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God I want to be his friend today don't you Abraham sitting out there not expecting anything he was in the poorest of the land it was In the Heat of the day an odd time for something to happen but he seen a man come walking three of them something in his heart told him it was God and he held on to it he wouldn't let them pass by he said oh God May that happen here I say may it happen this morning don't let it pass by hold on to it come in sit down under the oak I'll fetch a little water I'll be a servant to you let me wash your feet I'll bring you a morsel of bread you satisfy your soul and then you may go on for this reason my Lord Has Come to Me In not too sure but he knew that there was something sparked in his heart it must be the time oh Church there was Abraham that called out having life kind of hard persecuted made fun of sitting out in the wilderness on the bare ground in the shade of the oak tree but when the hour of the message came oh I love it he looked out in the heat of the day and he seen three men coming up dust all over their clothes and Abraham looked again he knew there was just something about it a real Born Again child of God knows the spirit of God when it strikes yes sir my sheep knew my voice it was just like any other service it was just like any other day it was just like any other hour but that morning in that in that Sunday morning service he looked around and he was sitting under the oak tree in the shade of the service and he sees something happen he said Lord today I'm going to entertain you Lord what is it that you have need of what is it that you want let me wash your feet and when he did oh church when he begin to entertain the angel what happened yeah God began to speak yes said it's coming the message that he believed all those years became real to his heart right it was hot I'm closing now in just a moment he might have been ill-tempered CU you get that way when it's hot I know I do nothing worse than being too hot come on that's why we crank his temperature down in here I know some of y'all is sitting there thinking oh right now I'm cold but there ain't nothing worse than being too hot because when you get hot you fall asleep and I hate to sleep during the day because something might happen what happened Sarah was tired she was in a bad mood Abraham might have been ill-tempered but he was under in the right place sir at the right time he had the right response I say this morning is the right place and the right time what will our response be who was it the son of man I know I've dwelt on just a little part of this this morning but it's the son of man wants to reveal himself where where under a rest stored brid tree When In the Heat of the day yeah huh in the darkness of Le to Sea brother BR tells a story musician go ahead and come the Rand tells a story about about animals in India he tells it in several places he said there was a great earthquake about to come and he when he went to India he read in the paper that said the earthquake must be over because the animals are going back and he said what had happened is that when the earthquake was coming or the days before it happened he said all the all the animals he said In the Heat of the day they left the walls which normally during the heat of the day they would actually stay against the walls the man-made structure that was there that would keep them cool but he said these animals in the heat of the day they left the man-made structure and they come out in the middle of the field and they all huddled together go go you can go read where he says he said that the Sheep left every man-made shelter and stood together in the middle of the field yeah brother brand picks that up he said can't you see Spirit-filled people something is fixing to happen all right oh my there's an earthquake coming sodom's about to get burnt it's time to huddle together it's time yeah so I'm afraid that maybe I won't fit in with the rest of the sheep all the rest of the sheep are that way too you know we're all just a little odd we couldn't be bride we the Oddball right and and I think we need to be more open with each other I think people need to recognize that brother Brandon was a human I'm a human there's only one man that was ever lived a perfect life as a human that was Jesus Christ we need to recognize we need one another I may get irritated at you but I need you you might get irrit iritated at me but you need me may not like everything about you I may get tired you know the Bible says talks about a friend if you continue to come to a friend's house you know eventually you get wear out you're welcome but but we need each other right we need one another we we need to stand together In the Heat of the day that's what breaks my heart when I see people fracturing and let's promote this church or that one that's not what we're about let's get out in the middle of the field Stand Together In the Heat of the day we need one another he said don't look for some great big Universal something sweeping nothing but the coming of the Lord Jesus he said remember just remember the words and the promise of the Lord won't you come on in right quick get away from them big walls the resurrection is near at hand now I want you to notice this is there to play something softly mamory was in the place of the Resurrection where Abraham was sitting in the tent of the day he later bought that [Music] field for Sarah to be buried in and when he died he was buried in that same field and there was a place where job was buried it oh church it was the same place where where where Joseph said said don't leave my bones in Egypt take me back you remember the story brother brother brother BR brings it out how that Abraham bought the cave in the field of mpil that that's in that same plane of mammory the area of Hebron in in the in Israel if you go look at it today it it's in the West Bank you realize why Israel can't give up their property their rights because if they have a two-state solution and every just hunky dory and there's a Palestinian State Israeli State Israel no longer owns that spot right they would be giving up that spot you realize well there can't be no peace oh church because that's a literal land but we don't have a literal land we have we we are buried in Christ brother B says let me be buried in Christ and where am I at I'm sitting under the shade of the oak tree where in Christ and the place that I'm sitting in is the place he's going to raise me from that's the place where the Rapture told church that's where the Rapture is going to happened when when when Jesus was crucified and the graves were open Abraham and Sarah come walking out of that place and went walking into Jerusalem you and I come walking out of the if we go by way of the Grave we'll come up where in Christ we'll come up in the very place where we sat there and entertained The Message In the Heat of the day oh Church the same spirit that you feel now the same presence that we have here in the services the same thing will raise you up one day we just got to believe it we just got to be like Abraham and say Lord what do you need let me let me wash your feet Let Me Entertain You Let Me treat you right I believe there's something different about this service I believe you're going to make yourself real to me we bow our heads together [Music] don't you love him this [Music] morning oh that secret place that's under the oak tree standing there in the shade in the shade of a little company Abraham and Sarah but that was his little church under the oak tree he a little church there I say oh God I know it's not limited to this building but let this building be that oak tree that tent door let my home be that oak tree let let the atmosphere come in that place of shade of the oak where everything I do is influenced by the shade where In the Heat of the day I can I can sit there and just say Lord I know you love me what Can I Do Lord can I wash your feet but what can I do I have a message that says my body is going to change one of these things make it real to me Lord reveal yourself to me manifest yourself through me in the son of man Ministry in my life would you just pray that way this morning maybe you've never accepted Christ now would be a good time if you've never really believed on him never really believed on the message of the hour and believe that message hour is Christ that's all we're talking about it's just how God has revealed himself to us in this hour if you've never done that would you do that today maybe you find yourself hurting and you find problems in your life and you just feel like well maybe I maybe it's time to quit maybe I don't know I realize I preach every every time I preach maybe there's someone sitting there that they just feel like maybe this is it and I just leave don't do that is come under the shade of the oak tree come under the message of the hour to just let him talk to you this morning get together it it might be difficult some of them sheep smell bad they don't they don't they're not exactly maybe like you but come together with the Sheep of God it'll provide shade for your life it'll influence you in the right direction God help us today you young people I know you get sometimes I believe the presence of the Lord is here this morning I know you get sometimes where you feel like you know I'm just just
