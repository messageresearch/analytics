[0:00] what was the noise the proof of
[0:04] life amen just like in the manger the
[0:07] noise was a proof that God deity had
[0:10] been born in human vessels again deity
[0:14] had been born but it wasn't just any
[0:15] noise come on now watch it wasn't just
[0:18] noise for the sake of noise but it was
[0:20] noise fulfilling the word of God there
[0:23] you go with other tongues I with with
[0:25] other tongues and he said with uh all
[0:27] these things I'll speak to my people
[0:29] I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh and
[0:30] and people begin to wonder what's going
[0:32] on and Peter stands up and begins to
[0:33] preach and he says this day these people
[0:35] are not drunk as you suppose but this is
[0:38] that this noise amen is the result of
[0:42] people being
[0:43] born yes Christ being born in the hearts
[0:46] of the people oh I trust that would be
[0:49] the case with us today we would never be
[0:51] a dead cold place it would never be a
[0:53] silent place but that way the noise
[0:55] could be a not just noise for the sake
[0:57] of the music not just noise for the s of
[1:00] well so and so is doing and I might as
[1:01] well do it too but no it's because
[1:03] there's a living God because he's being
[1:06] manifested in the hearts of the people
