[50:38] end i've been in prayer lines where you
[50:40] just feel that anointing come on but i
[50:42] believe right there this morning those
[50:43] that came forward i believe there was an
[50:45] anointing there
[50:46] to take care of every issue that you
[50:48] came with if we just believe it
[50:50] that's where that's where the thing lies
[50:52] is where we can believe if we can ever
[50:54] come under that anointing there and then
[50:56] just believe that that what we had need
[50:58] of was already taking place it's already
[50:59] done it's a finished work
[51:01] if we can just go believing
[51:03] james chapter 1 verse 25
[51:06] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[51:08] of liberty and continueth therein
[51:11] he being not a forgetful hearer but a
[51:14] doer of the work
[51:16] this man
[51:17] shall be blessed
[51:19] in his deed and you may be seated
[51:21] and we'll turn over there to ii kings
[51:23] this is a little bit of a longer
[51:24] scripture reading so i was going to let
[51:26] you sit for this second kings chapter 5
[51:29] and we'll read verses 1 through 14. this
[51:31] is talking about
[51:33] naaman
[51:34] and the prophet elisha here says now
[51:36] naaman captain of the host of the king
[51:38] of syria was a great man with his master
[51:41] and honorable because by him the lord
[51:43] had given deliverance unto syria he was
[51:45] also a mighty man in valor but he was a
[51:48] leper and the syrians had gone out by
[51:51] companies and had brought away captive
[51:53] out of the land of israel a little maid
[51:55] and she waited on naaman's wife and she
[51:58] said unto her mistress would god my lord
[52:01] were the were with the prophet that is
[52:03] in samaria
[52:05] for he would recover him of his leprosy
[52:08] and one went in and told his lord saying
[52:11] thus and thus said the maid that is of
[52:13] the land of israel and the king of syria
[52:15] said go
[52:16] to go and i will send a letter under the
[52:19] king of israel and he departed and took
[52:22] with him ten talents of silver six
[52:24] thousand pieces of gold and ten changes
[52:26] of ramen
[52:27] and he brought the letter of the king of
[52:29] israel saying now when this letter is
[52:31] coming to thee behold i have therewith
[52:34] sent name in my servant to thee that
[52:36] thou mayest recover him of his leprosy
[52:38] and it came to pass when the king of
[52:40] israel had read the letter that he rent
[52:42] his clothes and said am i am i god to
[52:45] kill and to make alive that this man
[52:47] does send unto me to recover a man of
[52:49] his leprosy
[52:50] wherefore consider i pray you and see
[52:53] how he seeketh the quarrel against me
[52:55] and it was so when elisha the man of god
[52:58] had heard that the king of israel had
[53:00] written his clothes that he sent to the
[53:02] king saying
[53:03] wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let
[53:06] him now come to me and he shall know
[53:08] that there is a prophet in israel
[53:10] so naaman came with his horses and with
[53:12] his chariot and stood at the door of the
[53:14] house of elisha and elisha sent a
[53:16] messenger on him saying
[53:17] go and wash in the jordan seven times
[53:20] and thy flesh shall come again to thee
[53:23] and thou shalt be clean now there's the
[53:25] order from the prophet of god right
[53:27] there that is the word of the lord to be
[53:29] believed and then he had to do it
[53:32] but naaman was wroth and went away and
[53:34] said behold i thought he will surely
[53:36] come out to me and stand and call in the
[53:38] name of the lord as god and strike his
[53:39] hand over the place and recover the
[53:41] leper
[53:42] are not habana and
[53:44] far par rivers of damascus better than
[53:47] all the waters of israel
[53:49] may i not washing them and be clean see
[53:51] he wanted a different way
[53:52] a better way
[53:53] something that looked better felt better
[53:56] may i not wash them and be clean so he
[53:58] turned and went away in a rage and his
[54:00] servants came near and spake unto him
[54:02] and said
[54:03] my father if the prophet had bid thee to
[54:06] do some great thing would thou not have
[54:08] done it
[54:09] how much rather then when he saith to
[54:11] thee wash and be clean
[54:13] then he went down and dipped himself
[54:15] seven times in the jordan according to
[54:17] the saying of the man of god and his
[54:19] flesh came again like unto the flesh of
[54:21] a little child and he was clean
[54:24] obeying god may seem foolish but it does
[54:27] bring results
[54:29] naaman here is given the prescription to
[54:31] be healed
[54:33] but it seems just a little bit
[54:34] far-fetched it seems like something it
[54:36] just doesn't hold with prestige the way
[54:39] he would want it to it's not something
[54:41] he wants to do because it doesn't feel
[54:43] good it's dirty water it's something but
[54:45] see there was a test that had to come to
[54:47] see if he was serious about getting
[54:48] healed if he was serious about wanting
[54:50] the word of god or if he just wanted he
[54:52] wanted the prophet to come and say hey
[54:53] you're healed you're good to go you
[54:55] don't have to come up here and stand at
[54:56] the altar you don't have to pray through
[54:58] the man of god doesn't have to lay hands
[55:00] on you none of these things have to
[55:01] happen just just go and just just have
[55:04] an intellectual talk and be well
[55:07] but he was able to hear the instruction
[55:09] but then there's something else to the
[55:11] instruction he had to actually go and
[55:12] obey what the prophet said
[55:15] brother brahm says this about name and
[55:16] he said now did you notice people they
[55:18] want to get this healed they want to get
[55:20] healed and they get and get the holy
[55:21] spirit the way they think they ought to
[55:23] have it he said now come on down brother
[55:26] if you'll bring me up and take me into a
[55:27] room where nobody will see me and you
[55:30] lay your hands upon me and bless me put
[55:32] the holy ghost in me i'll accept it he
[55:34] said oh no naaman wanted to accept his
[55:36] healing like that one time but elisha
[55:38] told him to get out there in the old
[55:40] muddy jordan and dip seven times he said
[55:42] i can just see him get off his chariot
[55:45] oh a great man hold his nose here he
[55:47] comes out in the water tiptoeing like a
[55:49] cat in molasses he said you know it's
[55:51] coming out like this he said you know
[55:53] getting out like that get down this
[55:54] water he said oh i hate to do this
[55:56] some people come to the altar like it
[55:58] was some sickening affair for them he
[56:00] said oh i don't want to do that he
[56:01] ducked down one time and then he still
[56:04] got leprosy why because he said seven
[56:06] times
[56:07] you've got to dip in the jordan
[56:09] still got leprosy the prophet said seven
[56:11] times right until he obeyed the word
[56:14] completely and until you obey it
[56:16] completely he still had the leprosy oh i
[56:19] would like to be i want to be saved i
[56:21] want to be filled with the holy ghost
[56:22] but there is a prescription you must
[56:23] follow to get that he had a good man
[56:26] standing on the bank said the prophet
[56:28] said seven times father see just keep on
[56:30] dipping that's it you don't get it the
[56:32] first night just dip until you get it
[56:35] just keep on till you get it and the
[56:37] water didn't have the healing but doing
[56:39] what the word said
[56:41] obedience to the word brought the
[56:42] results see it wasn't in the water if i
[56:45] go step in the water one time the
[56:46] baptism will never save you but the
[56:48] obedience to the word of god he said
[56:51] when you'll be baptized you shall
[56:52] receive the gift of the holy ghost now
[56:54] the holy ghost wasn't in the water but
[56:55] it is a gift that god gave you once you
[56:57] follow the word
[56:59] it doesn't matter how foolish this
[57:00] sounds doesn't matter how much of an
[57:02] inconvenience it would be to you well i
[57:03] don't want to get wet in my best clothes
[57:05] if god is tugging at your heart to get
[57:07] baptized go get baptized follow the word
[57:10] and a blessing will come
[57:12] he said if you love me keep my words the
[57:14] rich young ruler wanted to get the
[57:16] benefits of following jesus but when he
[57:17] had to give up something when he had to
[57:19] be maybe just a little bit more poor or
[57:21] had to give away something then he
[57:23] stopped that's the problem today we
[57:24] don't want to go into a way that would
[57:26] that would seem foolish to the world but
[57:28] god requires a separated people to come
[57:31] out of babylon to come out of the things
[57:33] of the world and be separate saith the
[57:35] lord so that we can go forward into our
[57:37] inheritance why is it because we we
[57:40] think we've got to be in the biggest
[57:41] church or have the best pastor and we
[57:43] have the best pastor by the way but if
[57:45] you think you've got to have the biggest
[57:47] church or you've got to have the the
[57:49] nicest building and drive the best cars
[57:51] you're looking at the wrong thing but he
[57:53] said come according to the word of god
[57:55] and when you come according to the word
[57:56] the blessing will come
[57:59] sanctification will come when you follow
[58:01] the word justification will come
[58:03] according to the word the holy ghost
[58:05] will come upon you when you follow the
[58:07] word of god
[58:09] brother branham said this
[58:11] he said there's one thing to teach
[58:12] something there's another thing for god
[58:14] to confirm it and say it's the truth
[58:16] there's one there's one thing to say
[58:18] something another thing to do something
[58:20] it's not hearers it's doers he said show
[58:23] me your faith without your works and
[58:25] i'll show you my faith said paul by my
[58:27] works if you believe it you'll act upon
[58:29] it that's it
[58:31] he said well why don't you come and join
[58:32] with me why don't you believe me well of
[58:34] course we have regulation and our
[58:36] regulation is a tradition of the elders
[58:38] which says if you don't belong to the
[58:39] sanhedrin or the denomination here at
[58:40] jerusalem why we'll all be
[58:42] excommunicated and therefore we can't
[58:44] accept it see it had to be a certain way
[58:46] and that's the way it was with jesus so
[58:48] many missed him because he didn't come
[58:50] in a pink decorated hospital room he
[58:52] come out there in a manger and people
[58:54] missed the messiah even though he come
[58:56] and did the works because he didn't come
[58:58] according to their mental ideas and
[59:00] conceptions but he come according to
[59:02] god's way and they missed it
[59:05] a virgin shall conceive but it didn't
[59:06] come according to the way they thought
[59:08] it should happen
[59:11] no man was willing to admit that no man
[59:12] could do the things that he did except
[59:13] god be with him why god is proving his
[59:15] gospel god always did it he said now my
[59:18] clergy brethren and sunday school
[59:19] teachers let us reason for a minute did
[59:22] you know religion is one thing salvation
[59:24] is another did you know it come from
[59:26] genesis realize that cain was a
[59:28] religious man just as religious as abel
[59:30] was he came before the lord he realized
[59:32] that he was immortal he had to die and
[59:33] he built an altar unto the lord and a
[59:36] church he brought it in made a sacrifice
[59:38] to the lord paid his tithes paid his
[59:40] offerings as it were to the lord and
[59:42] besides that he knelt down and worshiped
[59:44] the lord he did all the things that
[59:45] looked right
[59:47] and so if belonging to church and
[59:48] supporting the church and bringing in
[59:50] your tithes and offering and kneeling
[59:52] down and worshiping is all that god
[59:53] requires a man to do then he would be
[59:55] unjust to condemn cain because cain done
[59:58] every bit of it he said but the only way
[1:00:00] that abel was just it was a spiritual
[1:00:02] revelation it wasn't by the works it was
[1:00:05] by faith and if you believe by faith a
[1:00:08] true faith in the word of god then
[1:00:10] you'll act upon it the action don't come
[1:00:12] first the faith comes first and then
[1:00:14] you'll act upon the word of god you hear
[1:00:16] the word then you'll act upon the word
[1:00:19] not him that worketh but him that
[1:00:20] believeth not apples and peaches and
[1:00:22] pears are the fruits of the land he says
[1:00:24] that brought us out of the garden of
[1:00:25] eden but it was the blood and jesus
[1:00:27] vindicated the same thing when he said
[1:00:29] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:00:31] you simon peter when he confessed him to
[1:00:33] be the lord he said you never learned
[1:00:34] this in a seminary you never learned
[1:00:36] this from some church but my father
[1:00:38] which is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:00:40] you and upon this rock i will build my
[1:00:43] church there is the prescription and the
[1:00:45] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:00:47] it spiritual revealed truth of the
[1:00:50] living god when god has revealed to you
[1:00:53] by the holy spirit not by a theology not
[1:00:55] by mental thinking but by the actual
[1:00:57] birth of the holy spirit don't we want
[1:01:00] to follow the word through the holy
[1:01:02] spirit see otherwise it's just a bunch
[1:01:04] of rules and regulations we think we've
[1:01:06] got to do this and i've got to do that
[1:01:07] but when god reveals that thing to do
[1:01:10] then you act on it that's when you do it
[1:01:13] it's no longer a rule it's no longer a
[1:01:14] regulation but that's by grace you have
[1:01:17] obeyed the word of god
[1:01:19] he said jesus christ raised from the
[1:01:21] dead you have eternal life that's the
[1:01:22] revelation wish we had time to bring it
[1:01:24] through the bible he said look at korra
[1:01:26] moab in the bible when israel come up
[1:01:27] there was moab come from the sons of lot
[1:01:29] which was by his daughter and they had a
[1:01:31] great place a great church when they
[1:01:33] come down to curse israel they built the
[1:01:35] same kind of altars pray to the same god
[1:01:37] made the same sacrifices bullocks they
[1:01:39] offered a sheep representing the coming
[1:01:41] of christ and fundamentally speaking
[1:01:44] everything that moses was offering down
[1:01:46] there balaam was offering up here
[1:01:49] so if god only requires fundamental
[1:01:50] teaching as intellectual god could not
[1:01:53] refuse balaam's offering but the reason
[1:01:55] why did he refuse balaam and except
[1:01:57] moses is because moses there was signs
[1:02:00] and wonders god was vindicating they had
[1:02:02] divine healing a brass serpent they had
[1:02:04] a smitten rock they had joy do we have
[1:02:06] joy today they had the leading spirit
[1:02:08] they had a pillar of fire they had
[1:02:10] everything among them signs and wonders
[1:02:13] god proving that he accepted them that's
[1:02:14] the way it is today it was when jesus
[1:02:17] and nicodemus stood together nicodemus
[1:02:19] in a fine church
[1:02:20] orthodox as it could be taught to the
[1:02:22] very last word and jesus was also but
[1:02:25] god was with jesus rabbi we know that
[1:02:27] thou art a teacher come from god for no
[1:02:29] man can do miracles you do except god be
[1:02:32] with him so they recognize here that
[1:02:34] jesus was actually come from god they
[1:02:36] recognized these these pharisees
[1:02:38] actually knew that this was a man sent
[1:02:39] from god but they couldn't obey the
[1:02:42] works they couldn't obey the words that
[1:02:44] jesus taught why because it sounded
[1:02:46] foolish to them and they had a
[1:02:48] preconceived idea and a mental idea of
[1:02:51] how things should happen they had a law
[1:02:53] over here but there was a revelation of
[1:02:55] blood that they completely missed
[1:02:58] he said now notice they could admit
[1:02:59] jesus was a man sent from god and so
[1:03:01] they go on down here they couldn't
[1:03:02] believe from the heart or they would
[1:03:04] follow see
[1:03:05] this is how it was he said he followed
[1:03:07] and did the words and he spoke and then
[1:03:08] that works would be followed them that
[1:03:10] believed so it wasn't just the works but
[1:03:12] you believe first
[1:03:14] you have to believe something before you
[1:03:16] can actually go do it if if brother ben
[1:03:19] told me to stand on my head if there was
[1:03:21] if i didn't believe that would do me any
[1:03:22] good i'm not going to do it if i could
[1:03:24] do it i wouldn't do it unless i really
[1:03:26] believed
[1:03:27] that it would be for a purpose of
[1:03:29] healing so to be dipped in the river of
[1:03:32] jordan seven times you think about it
[1:03:33] this way
[1:03:34] he had to believe that it was actually
[1:03:36] going to heal him
[1:03:38] or it wouldn't done him any good
[1:03:39] if you come up here and we lay our hands
[1:03:42] on you and you feel the anointing of the
[1:03:44] holy ghost upon you we can do we can we
[1:03:46] can pray and we can pray but if you
[1:03:47] don't believe it's not going to do you
[1:03:48] any good you have got to believe
[1:03:51] before the healing takes place brother
[1:03:53] branham in the prayer lines many times
[1:03:54] you'll hear him say this go believing
[1:03:56] and if you believe you'll get what you
[1:03:58] ask for
[1:04:00] but what was the prescription you have
[1:04:01] to believe we have a part to play in
[1:04:03] this thing we have to do something about
[1:04:06] it and it's not a work but we should
[1:04:08] want to do something when god's word
[1:04:10] said something that's grace that caused
[1:04:12] us to believe in the first place and
[1:04:13] when grace has taken hold of our hearts
[1:04:15] then we act upon the word of god
[1:04:18] we are a part of another he said don't
[1:04:20] you never let satan tell you anything
[1:04:21] else
[1:04:22] being a part of one another we are a
[1:04:25] part of him we are fellow citizens of
[1:04:27] the kingdom enjoying these blessings
[1:04:29] together of the resurrection
[1:04:31] the son is just now on you and now
[1:04:33] you're growing into a blossom life like
[1:04:35] he was to be resurrected completely in
[1:04:37] the last day your potentials you have
[1:04:39] now
[1:04:40] we just got to believe that your
[1:04:42] potentials what you will be
[1:04:45] after the body change is already in you
[1:04:47] now
[1:04:48] what you will be is here
[1:04:50] the theophany is here
[1:04:52] the word body is here but we have got to
[1:04:55] believe that it will happen we have got
[1:04:57] to believe that a resurrection is coming
[1:05:00] or else world worshiping in vain he said
[1:05:02] your body come in obedience to it didn't
[1:05:04] it in obedience to what a church know
[1:05:06] the word which is the life then you are
[1:05:08] now resurrected from the dead you are
[1:05:10] already already resurrected from the
[1:05:12] dead if you believe it
[1:05:15] he said
[1:05:17] the potentials they're already there
[1:05:19] think about that he said your body come
[1:05:21] into obedience to what the word now he
[1:05:23] said and the bible tells us in james 1
[1:05:25] 21 24 through 24 he said wherefore lay
[1:05:28] apart all filthiness and superfluity of
[1:05:30] naughtiness and receive with meekness
[1:05:32] the engrafted word which is able to save
[1:05:35] your souls we have to believe that he
[1:05:37] said but be doers of the word and not
[1:05:40] hearers only deceiving your own selves
[1:05:43] think about it like that i can sit and i
[1:05:45] can hear the word and i can read this
[1:05:46] bible millions of people read this bible
[1:05:48] through on it maybe on a daily basis but
[1:05:50] it's not doing them any good if they're
[1:05:52] not taking the letters out of the book
[1:05:53] and putting it in the heart where they
[1:05:55] can take it and put it into action it
[1:05:57] doesn't do any good for god to call a
[1:05:59] man to preach if he never preaches it
[1:06:01] doesn't do any good for you to say well
[1:06:03] i believe in a prophet if you're not
[1:06:04] going to do what he says
[1:06:07] oh i believe in hearing the tapes they
[1:06:08] won't do you no good if you don't
[1:06:10] actually believe what's on the tapes
[1:06:12] i believe everything in this bible it
[1:06:14] don't do me no good if i completely go
[1:06:16] against it it does mean no good if i
[1:06:18] just believe from a head knowledge
[1:06:20] because i have not applied that to my
[1:06:22] heart i have not actually believed what
[1:06:24] i'm doing is i'm actually a
[1:06:25] make-believer and brother branham said
[1:06:27] out of the three kinds of believers the
[1:06:29] make-believer was the worst kind why
[1:06:31] because he says i know it's right to go
[1:06:33] to church i know it's right to pay my
[1:06:35] tithes i know it's right i know the word
[1:06:37] is right i know the message of the hour
[1:06:39] is right but when it comes down when the
[1:06:40] rubber hits the road they can't do it
[1:06:43] they can't do what he said he said and
[1:06:46] right here in james he said he said
[1:06:48] you're deceiving your own selves he said
[1:06:50] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[1:06:52] not a doer he is like unto a man
[1:06:54] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:06:56] for he beholdeth himself and go with his
[1:06:58] way and straightway forgetteth what
[1:07:01] manner of man he was
[1:07:04] but whoso looketh into the perfect law
[1:07:07] of liberty
[1:07:08] perfect law of liberty think about it
[1:07:10] it's not a law of bondage this is a
[1:07:12] perfect law of liberty by grace and
[1:07:15] continueth therein he being not a
[1:07:17] forgetful hearer
[1:07:19] but a doer of the work
[1:07:21] this man shall be blessed in his deed do
[1:07:23] you want a blessing
[1:07:25] obey the word of god not through rules
[1:07:28] not not because i said to do it not
[1:07:30] because one of these other ministers
[1:07:31] said to do it because the word says to
[1:07:33] do it
[1:07:34] and when you fall in love with the word
[1:07:35] of god the word of god will come down
[1:07:37] into your heart and it's a love affair
[1:07:39] you actually feel bad when you don't do
[1:07:41] the word you say well i failed god i had
[1:07:44] this happen to me and it kept me out of
[1:07:46] church and this over here kept me out of
[1:07:48] my position here and i couldn't i
[1:07:50] couldn't show up on this service and and
[1:07:52] i couldn't do this and maybe maybe time
[1:07:54] or maybe there's an ox in the ditch or
[1:07:55] maybe this happened that's okay but but
[1:07:57] think about how that that hurts your
[1:07:59] heart because you're saying i can't do
[1:08:00] it because i really had a legitimate
[1:08:02] reason but there's still something in
[1:08:04] there that is wanting you to obey the
[1:08:06] word of god and that is the spirit of
[1:08:08] christ trying to bring your body under
[1:08:10] subjection
[1:08:12] do you want a revival
[1:08:15] in your life every one of us should want
[1:08:16] that
[1:08:18] then we have to come god's provided way
[1:08:21] we don't just make the revival but the
[1:08:23] revival is in us we are the revival but
[1:08:26] we don't just make it happen by just by
[1:08:28] just going about our business and never
[1:08:30] actually obeying the word of god
[1:08:32] reading the bible doesn't save me
[1:08:33] reading the bible doesn't cause revival
[1:08:35] in my life but acting upon the word sure
[1:08:37] can he said you want to be healed come
[1:08:39] into obedience to the word you want your
[1:08:41] family saved
[1:08:43] do you want to see all of your family
[1:08:44] saved
[1:08:45] apply the token according to the word
[1:08:48] and it will happen see we just have to
[1:08:50] believe that this word is able to do it
[1:08:53] we have to believe that when we come
[1:08:55] expecting that that's something we say
[1:08:57] all the time did you come expecting
[1:08:58] something good from the lord but that's
[1:09:00] a real thing
[1:09:01] there really is a
[1:09:03] something you can get from god if you
[1:09:05] come expecting something good from god
[1:09:07] but if you come and you think well i'm
[1:09:09] just going to hear another preacher i'm
[1:09:10] just going to have another sermon and i
[1:09:12] have checked a box and i've come and
[1:09:14] i've done what i've had to do then you
[1:09:16] really haven't met god yet you're just
[1:09:18] going through the motions and the rules
[1:09:20] but when you get down on the inside and
[1:09:22] something says
[1:09:23] you can't wait to be a church with the
[1:09:25] believers brother branham said if god is
[1:09:27] in your heart
[1:09:28] you can't wait to be where other
[1:09:29] christians are at
[1:09:32] you can't wait
[1:09:33] you can't stay home
[1:09:34] you can't just sit at home and because
[1:09:36] see it's not about us it's not about
[1:09:38] myself it's about serving you and you
[1:09:40] serving one another that's the way god
[1:09:42] intended it to be because why a love and
[1:09:45] because in our hearts we want to obey
[1:09:47] the word and we know what to do and so
[1:09:49] therefore when we when we get the holy
[1:09:51] ghost in us we can't go against the word
[1:09:54] because the spirit will lead you and
[1:09:55] guide you into all truth
[1:09:58] brother braham says it like this
[1:10:00] he said another fellow actually read out
[1:10:01] of this sermon last time and but he said
[1:10:03] quickening power he said this fellow had
[1:10:05] quickening power his name was philip he
[1:10:07] was so full of quickening power he was
[1:10:09] having a great big meeting down at
[1:10:10] samaria devils was being cast out people
[1:10:13] was baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:10:15] they was having a real meeting and the
[1:10:17] spirit spoke to him on the dynamics come
[1:10:19] down and said leave this revival but
[1:10:21] what will the minister say don't make
[1:10:23] any difference what they say see he was
[1:10:25] full of quickening power he had the
[1:10:27] gasoline the dynamics was falling upon
[1:10:29] him he said go out into the desert and
[1:10:31] he found a eunuch there and baptized in
[1:10:33] the name of jesus christ one man who
[1:10:35] took the message down to ethiopia he
[1:10:37] said is that right and he obeyed god see
[1:10:40] he would have never found that man had
[1:10:42] he stayed at the big meeting but he had
[1:10:43] to go
[1:10:45] you have to go according to the word
[1:10:47] because somebody may miss a blessing
[1:10:49] because of your disobedience to the word
[1:10:53] in obedience to god if you have never
[1:10:55] been baptized in the name of jesus
[1:10:56] christ do it and watch the quickening
[1:10:59] power pick you up then
[1:11:01] you believe that
[1:11:03] have you been baptized then believe that
[1:11:05] the quickening power is yours
[1:11:07] god has already sent the holy ghost to
[1:11:09] the church we have to follow the
[1:11:11] prescription and it will come upon you
[1:11:14] he won't lose one of you
[1:11:16] when stephen done this great thing are
[1:11:18] not stephen but phillip done this great
[1:11:20] thing to leave that great revival and
[1:11:22] obey the commandments of god when he
[1:11:24] fulfilled
[1:11:25] by baptizing this eunuch in obedience to
[1:11:28] god he was so full of the quickening
[1:11:30] power till it caught him away
[1:11:33] you want a rapture
[1:11:34] follow the word that quickening power
[1:11:36] will take us all out of here
[1:11:38] have you followed the word in baptism
[1:11:40] then believe that the quickening power
[1:11:41] is there for you
[1:11:42] how do we get it
[1:11:44] obedience to the word you say well
[1:11:46] that's a rule that's a thing we have to
[1:11:47] do this is not something we have to do
[1:11:50] this is something we want to do because
[1:11:52] grace has taken place in our hearts
[1:11:55] when the word says to do a certain thing
[1:11:57] that's why we do it it's not because of
[1:11:59] it's not because there's a list of rules
[1:12:00] hanging on the back door it's not
[1:12:02] something back there you have to come to
[1:12:03] church and if you're late we're going to
[1:12:04] lock you out or if you don't come on
[1:12:06] wednesday nights you can't come on
[1:12:07] sundays or if you don't come on sunday
[1:12:09] morning you can't come to hear me on
[1:12:10] sunday nights but what it is is like
[1:12:13] this
[1:12:14] it's a love affair that is in your
[1:12:16] hearts you can't help but serve god you
[1:12:19] can't help but do what god wants you to
[1:12:21] do because the word has actually
[1:12:23] penetrated your heart and it has come
[1:12:25] into a way that that we say well well if
[1:12:28] i'm at home sick even sometimes you're
[1:12:29] like oh i miss church because i'm sick
[1:12:31] and maybe you had to but but but there's
[1:12:33] something in your heart that just longs
[1:12:34] to be with the other christians if
[1:12:36] that's not there it's time for a checkup
[1:12:39] in the church of god if there's not a
[1:12:41] love for the word of god if you can read
[1:12:43] the word of god and you say well i don't
[1:12:45] need that it's not for me then there's
[1:12:47] something wrong on the inside
[1:12:49] there's something we've got to do
[1:12:51] there's something we've got to change
[1:12:52] in our lives
[1:12:54] it's not the rules
[1:12:56] but we've heard the word
[1:12:58] we see it's been vindicated we follow
[1:13:00] the only message today that has a
[1:13:02] vindicated prophet
[1:13:04] to follow
[1:13:06] the only one we have the least we can do
[1:13:09] is obey what he said to do the least we
[1:13:11] can do is take the word of god and hold
[1:13:14] tight to it we see how the how you can
[1:13:16] be disobedient disobedient to the word
[1:13:18] and you can live like the world you see
[1:13:20] the chaos of the world and how they're
[1:13:22] acting and how how there's such darkness
[1:13:24] all around but we have literally had a
[1:13:26] light come in our hour and we can walk
[1:13:29] in that light and do what the light has
[1:13:31] showed us the light on this word you see
[1:13:33] it was open to us and when the bride has
[1:13:36] seen that open book then we can walk
[1:13:38] according to that word there's no doubts
[1:13:40] there's no fears there's nothing that
[1:13:42] can come upon us nothing can separate us
[1:13:45] from the love of god that is in christ
[1:13:47] jesus why because the word has been
[1:13:49] revealed to us you'll see people with
[1:13:51] bibles sitting on their shelves but
[1:13:52] there's not an open book there it's a
[1:13:54] closed book and i heard it said like
[1:13:56] this one time it's like it's got a seal
[1:13:58] upon it they can open the book they can
[1:14:00] see what it says but they don't know
[1:14:02] what it said it's like reading a book in
[1:14:04] a dark room you can open the book and
[1:14:06] you can feel the pages and turn them but
[1:14:08] if you can't see the words the light
[1:14:10] hasn't been shown on it yet but when the
[1:14:12] light comes on then we can see what the
[1:14:15] word says when the light comes on we can
[1:14:17] do what the word says if you want to be
[1:14:19] healed do what the word says
[1:14:23] come in obedience to the word and watch
[1:14:25] your family change come in obedience to
[1:14:27] your word watch your children act
[1:14:29] different
[1:14:30] they'll look at you well you used to not
[1:14:33] do that you used to not go to church and
[1:14:34] you used to not act like that you used
[1:14:36] to cuss and drink and smoke and all
[1:14:38] these things but listen when god really
[1:14:40] gets a hold of you it'll change you from
[1:14:42] the inside out and there'll be something
[1:14:44] come upon you where you can't do the
[1:14:46] things of the world you'll step out and
[1:14:48] you'll try to drink and you'll try to
[1:14:49] smoke it and as soon as you get a hold
[1:14:51] of that there'll be something on the
[1:14:53] inside that'll make you put it down why
[1:14:55] because a change has happened
[1:14:57] a change has come on the inside
[1:14:59] brother braham talks about the little
[1:15:00] dove and and how the the oil they oil
[1:15:03] themselves and and it comes from the
[1:15:04] inside is something that just completely
[1:15:06] just constantly happens and that's the
[1:15:08] way with a christian when the oil of the
[1:15:10] holy ghost is overflowing in you it it's
[1:15:13] constantly cleaning you up it's
[1:15:15] constantly bringing you under subjection
[1:15:16] to the word now the flesh may never be
[1:15:18] subject but the body will be different
[1:15:21] because something on the inside is
[1:15:23] starting to show on the outside and so
[1:15:25] you say well i can live any kind of life
[1:15:27] and be a christian but think about it
[1:15:29] like this god has put something on the
[1:15:32] inside of you not just to put it there
[1:15:34] not just to say well this one here will
[1:15:36] make it in the rapture but he's going to
[1:15:38] live like satan until then no god has
[1:15:40] given you the right to be partakers of
[1:15:43] his holiness partakers of his grace he
[1:15:46] has given you the authority to walk all
[1:15:49] over them devils that try to hold you
[1:15:51] back
[1:15:52] you have an authority this bride is
[1:15:54] equipped with everything it's not
[1:15:56] something we put back on a prophet it's
[1:15:58] not something we put into the future
[1:16:00] this is not something that's going to
[1:16:01] happen or what did happen it's something
[1:16:03] that's happening right now
[1:16:05] we get caught up in our in our
[1:16:07] slothfulness and and we we don't read
[1:16:09] the bible like we should and then when
[1:16:10] we do it's it's like well i've got to
[1:16:12] read the bible today because because a
[1:16:14] christian reads their bible but if
[1:16:15] you're just doing it just to do it and
[1:16:17] you're not actually reading what it says
[1:16:18] and doing what it says then maybe you're
[1:16:21] just wasting your time or god's time but
[1:16:23] listen when you see something and when
[1:16:26] the light has really struck you
[1:16:28] when you see it in the word it's not
[1:16:30] that hard to do what the word says but
[1:16:33] see there's a battle in the mind that
[1:16:34] tries to hold you back from what the
[1:16:36] word says to do there's something in the
[1:16:38] mind that tries to keep you from that
[1:16:40] why but there's an obedience there and
[1:16:42] it comes from more than rules it comes
[1:16:44] from more than what the pastor gets up
[1:16:46] here and says but the obedience comes
[1:16:48] from within because grace has taken a
[1:16:51] hold and by grace you have now been
[1:16:54] being able to obey the word of god think
[1:16:56] about it like this here when there was a
[1:16:57] man that come to jesus
[1:16:59] brother b was talking about this morning
[1:17:01] and he come and had he not put the mud
[1:17:02] on his eyes and had he not went down to
[1:17:04] the pool to wash he would have never
[1:17:06] received his healing jesus was standing
[1:17:09] there could have spoke the eyes into
[1:17:10] existence
[1:17:12] he didn't have to do anything
[1:17:14] but he did have to obey the word
[1:17:16] and it comes down like this no matter
[1:17:18] how foolish it sounds to preach the
[1:17:20] gospel when the bible says go into all
[1:17:23] the world and preach the gospel i don't
[1:17:25] care how foolish it sounds or how crazy
[1:17:27] it sounds i you say well we've got a
[1:17:29] better preacher over here or we've got a
[1:17:31] prophet we can just press play you go
[1:17:33] right on and do that but if you're
[1:17:34] denying the word of god that press and
[1:17:36] play won't do you no good
[1:17:40] but there's got to be more than just a
[1:17:42] rule
[1:17:43] more than just a time to come together
[1:17:45] and sit down and do our due diligence
[1:17:48] time to all come together and pray no i
[1:17:49] tell you if you want to pray before god
[1:17:51] when god puts the desire there and says
[1:17:54] kneel down before me and pray do it no
[1:17:56] matter where you're at no matter what
[1:17:57] time of the day it is
[1:18:00] we must believe the word sorry i'm
[1:18:02] yelling at you
[1:18:03] we've got to believe the word it's not
[1:18:05] and it's not rules i want to get that
[1:18:06] through through our heads and through
[1:18:08] our minds and our hearts
[1:18:09] it's not a rule brother brand because
[1:18:11] brother graham said we had to do a
[1:18:12] certain thing that's not why we do it
[1:18:15] we do it because our hearts have been
[1:18:17] sanctified by the word
[1:18:19] and now there is something on the inside
[1:18:21] that actually makes us do those things
[1:18:23] when we hear it it actually make you
[1:18:25] feel bad
[1:18:27] you ever had your toes stepped on i have
[1:18:30] you ever felt bad about something you
[1:18:32] did
[1:18:32] some little white lie you told me you
[1:18:34] didn't realize you told it but you said
[1:18:36] something and you didn't really get the
[1:18:37] facts of it so you said it and now all
[1:18:39] of a sudden you kind of come you now you
[1:18:42] have condemnation
[1:18:43] and when you have condemnation and you
[1:18:45] come to church it's condemnation upon
[1:18:47] condemnation upon condemnation and you
[1:18:49] sit there you're like well i'm not
[1:18:50] obeying this part of the word and i
[1:18:52] failed god in this manner and the next
[1:18:54] thing you know then you're just full of
[1:18:55] condemnation and you get nothing out of
[1:18:57] the service but if we can repent before
[1:18:59] god and come under subjection to the
[1:19:01] word of god even if we don't look like
[1:19:03] it yet even if you haven't had time to
[1:19:05] go repent yet do it in the heart first
[1:19:08] and then go make it right and come
[1:19:10] before the before god and say lord
[1:19:13] whatever your word says i'll do it
[1:19:15] i don't care if it's crazy i don't care
[1:19:17] if it costs me money i don't care if it
[1:19:19] costs me prestige or status i will do
[1:19:21] what the word of god says
[1:19:23] can somebody say yes lord i'll do your
[1:19:26] word yes lord is all we have to do is
[1:19:29] say yes when the spirit of the lord
[1:19:31] comes upon you dance like david dance
[1:19:34] when the spirit of the lord comes upon
[1:19:36] you do what the spirit says to do
[1:19:40] he the hath and ear
[1:19:42] let him hear what the spirit says to the
[1:19:44] church
[1:19:45] i believe there's a spirit here today
[1:19:47] that can tell you
[1:19:49] what you have need of
[1:19:51] i believe that god is still an
[1:19:52] ever-present help when you have trouble
[1:19:55] i believe that when you have depression
[1:19:57] and sickness
[1:19:59] there's still a god who is the healer of
[1:20:01] all
[1:20:02] your diseases it doesn't matter what
[1:20:04] you've been through what you're going to
[1:20:06] go through there could be something
[1:20:07] horrible happen tomorrow that you don't
[1:20:09] even know about but god's got you
[1:20:11] god has already seen it he knows what's
[1:20:14] going to happen and he's already there
[1:20:16] to take care of it you say why would god
[1:20:18] let me do this why would he why would he
[1:20:20] hurt me and why would he allow me to be
[1:20:22] hurt like this because sometimes he
[1:20:24] wants to see if you can hold on abraham
[1:20:27] and sarah had to hold on for a long time
[1:20:29] but the word of god did come to pass and
[1:20:31] it'll still come to pass for you
[1:20:34] but you have to obey it well that was
[1:20:36] for another day
[1:20:37] we don't preach no more
[1:20:39] we don't do these things no more but
[1:20:41] through the foolishness
[1:20:43] of me standing up here and slobbering
[1:20:45] all over the place
[1:20:46] somebody could be saved
[1:20:48] through the foolishness of a person
[1:20:50] getting up here and looking like an
[1:20:51] idiot you could be saved through the
[1:20:54] foolishness
[1:20:55] god saw something good could come out of
[1:20:57] it
[1:20:59] a broken life
[1:21:01] something that looked horrible
[1:21:02] to the world
[1:21:04] you could have been in drugs and alcohol
[1:21:06] you could have had a divorced family and
[1:21:08] maybe you've lost loved ones but there's
[1:21:10] something that god has got in store for
[1:21:13] you when you can come under subjection
[1:21:15] to the word of god
[1:21:17] he's a god of second chances
[1:21:19] we've questioned we failed to believe
[1:21:22] but he's still been faithful anyway
[1:21:25] through it all god is faithful
[1:21:28] what we want is not always what god
[1:21:30] wants us
[1:21:31] to have
[1:21:32] what we want is not always the will of
[1:21:34] god what we want to do is not always in
[1:21:37] god's plans
[1:21:39] and we think that we think that god's
[1:21:40] not allowing us to do something when god
[1:21:42] is trying to tug at us a little bit say
[1:21:43] let's go let's do this
[1:21:45] see and let's go
[1:21:47] and we can be clean
[1:21:49] let's go this way
[1:21:51] and god will have a blessing for you do
[1:21:53] you believe that tonight god has
[1:21:55] something in store for every one of us
[1:21:57] but you've got to believe and then act
[1:22:00] upon what you believe
[1:22:02] see they would come in the prayer line
[1:22:04] and they would come and brother braham
[1:22:06] said do you believe and they would
[1:22:07] mostly i would say yes they would say
[1:22:09] yes yes i believe
[1:22:11] but see you can say that
[1:22:14] but do you really believe
[1:22:16] sometimes he would say
[1:22:18] if you believe that stomach condition go
[1:22:20] eat your supper
[1:22:23] now if i said no i can't go eat
[1:22:25] because it's going to affect me then i
[1:22:27] didn't really believe in the first place
[1:22:29] you remember john ryan he come to the
[1:22:30] prayer line
[1:22:31] and brother bram said he was healed
[1:22:33] and he went up there and he set the
[1:22:35] balcony a little bit and he come back in
[1:22:36] the prayer line again and he said
[1:22:38] brother graham you said i was healed and
[1:22:40] i still can't see but the brahman said
[1:22:41] you said you believed me
[1:22:44] see that's the problem right there god
[1:22:45] allowed him
[1:22:47] to be put through a test
[1:22:49] and every son or daughter that comes to
[1:22:52] god
[1:22:53] must be tested
[1:22:55] you've got to be tried will you make
[1:22:57] that decision because there is a part
[1:22:59] for you to play it is grace that has
[1:23:02] brought you here and grace will lead you
[1:23:04] home but you do have to believe the word
[1:23:06] of god and if you believe the word of
[1:23:08] god god will is obligated to back up the
[1:23:12] word
[1:23:13] there is an obligation that god has as
[1:23:16] well
[1:23:16] it's not just on us but it's on god also
[1:23:19] so when god has given us the word and
[1:23:22] he's given it to us in so many forms
[1:23:25] we don't have an excuse in this age
[1:23:27] of anything
[1:23:29] we have the written word we have the
[1:23:31] spoken word we have it on our phones we
[1:23:33] have it on our computers we have it
[1:23:34] everywhere anywhere you want it you can
[1:23:36] get the word of god
[1:23:38] 24 hours a day seven days a week and not
[1:23:40] every country has that privilege
[1:23:43] but we become slothful worshipers
[1:23:46] we become so so it becomes common to us
[1:23:50] the word of god has become so common
[1:23:52] that we we just take it or we leave it
[1:23:55] if the preacher says something and we
[1:23:57] agree with it well i've heard that
[1:23:58] before but maybe you need to hear it
[1:24:00] again or god wouldn't put it on the
[1:24:02] man's heart
[1:24:03] you say well i know all these things i
[1:24:05] would say that most most people in here
[1:24:08] would know most of the message and you
[1:24:09] know most of the scriptures but it must
[1:24:12] be preached
[1:24:13] in the power and the demonstration and
[1:24:16] in the foolishness
[1:24:17] because god still has something for you
[1:24:20] god still has something for
[1:24:22] you can say hebrews 13 8 over and over
[1:24:24] but it's still true
[1:24:26] you can say you can say well god sent a
[1:24:28] prophet
[1:24:29] i don't care who i hear that from i
[1:24:31] still say amen to it because he did
[1:24:33] we've witnessed it in this day we
[1:24:35] witnessed the word of god and his power
[1:24:37] in this day but it didn't stop with him
[1:24:39] it's still in the bride of christ
[1:24:41] it didn't stop with brother branham it
[1:24:43] didn't stop with your pastor it didn't
[1:24:45] stop when there was one man that failed
[1:24:47] you it won't stop when the next one
[1:24:48] fails you but god is still god and he's
[1:24:51] still here to bring to pass his word
[1:24:55] all we have to do is believe it
[1:24:57] but if you really believe it you will
[1:25:00] act on it
[1:25:02] brother braham says this
[1:25:04] he said that ought to tear the heart
[1:25:05] he's talking about when we see the
[1:25:07] atonement and the blood of christ that
[1:25:09] ought to tear the heart of any sinner to
[1:25:12] realize that christ becomes sin
[1:25:15] that you
[1:25:16] through righteousness of his obedience
[1:25:19] to god might become him
[1:25:22] in the presence of god let me say that
[1:25:24] again that you through righteousness of
[1:25:28] his obedience
[1:25:30] jesus
[1:25:31] had to obey the will of the father or
[1:25:34] none of us would have the plan of
[1:25:35] salvation we have
[1:25:37] you say well i don't have to obey the
[1:25:39] word jesus himself had to obey the word
[1:25:42] of god
[1:25:43] or would everyone be lost today
[1:25:46] his obedience to god might become excuse
[1:25:49] me that's you
[1:25:50] through the righteousness of his
[1:25:52] obedience to god
[1:25:54] might become him in the presence of god
[1:25:57] to stand without blemish think about it
[1:26:00] i can become him before god
[1:26:04] amen i hope you can really get that
[1:26:07] because of his obedience
[1:26:10] he took my place
[1:26:12] so that i could become him
[1:26:14] i can become christ the word myself
[1:26:18] i am the portion of god i am the portion
[1:26:20] of christ on the earth the body of
[1:26:22] christ why because of his obedience
[1:26:26] because of what he did nothing i could
[1:26:28] do but the least i could do was say
[1:26:30] because he was willing to take the cross
[1:26:32] then i'll pick up my little cross every
[1:26:34] day i'll take the word of god i'll take
[1:26:37] the way with the despised few because
[1:26:39] i'm going to go through with jesus to
[1:26:40] the end i won't stop i won't give up
[1:26:43] there's nothing going to stop me now
[1:26:45] because god's word is here and he's made
[1:26:47] me a son of god and i can stand with no
[1:26:50] sin at all before god
[1:26:53] i can stand completely redeemed before
[1:26:55] god
[1:26:57] he became sin
[1:26:59] took the sin question out of us
[1:27:02] we can break the word drink
[1:27:05] tell dirty joke just
[1:27:07] lie
[1:27:09] not even bad in our eyes sometimes
[1:27:12] that tells you that there's not been the
[1:27:13] nature change that we must have
[1:27:16] we've got to have the true
[1:27:18] word of god
[1:27:20] living in us
[1:27:22] that's the only way to obedience
[1:27:24] if you follow it by a rule
[1:27:26] if i'm told to do something and i don't
[1:27:28] believe it in my heart i may do it for a
[1:27:30] little bit but i won't continue in that
[1:27:32] way
[1:27:33] if i know to do right and don't do it
[1:27:36] it becomes a sin what is sin the prophet
[1:27:38] taught us that is unbelief smoking and
[1:27:40] drinking and all these things is no
[1:27:42] different than just saying i'm not going
[1:27:44] to gather with the elected on sunday
[1:27:45] morning no
[1:27:47] it's no different you say well i can't
[1:27:48] do this and i can't do that it's no
[1:27:50] different
[1:27:52] to disbelieve one word of god than it is
[1:27:54] to smoke or drink
[1:27:56] no different it's all unbelief
[1:27:58] now if you don't know to do right then
[1:28:00] there's a difference there but if you
[1:28:02] know to do it then it becomes sin to you
[1:28:06] you say well that's hard it's the word
[1:28:08] it's the truth anyway it hurts me
[1:28:11] sometimes it hurts you sometimes maybe
[1:28:13] but when the word of god is made flesh
[1:28:15] before you
[1:28:17] you being made flesh before god then you
[1:28:20] must believe what the word says and when
[1:28:22] you become part of the word how can you
[1:28:24] disbelieve
[1:28:26] how can you not believe what you are
[1:28:30] i am the word of god made manifest how
[1:28:32] could i disbelieve that
[1:28:34] because the very word of god that came
[1:28:36] in our day and proved that that that he
[1:28:38] could put on he could create squirrels
[1:28:40] the very word of god that came in our
[1:28:42] day and proved that all these things
[1:28:44] could happen all the miracles could
[1:28:45] happen he could discern the secrets of
[1:28:46] the hearts and all these things could
[1:28:48] happen if i believe that to be true
[1:28:51] then i have to believe that jesus christ
[1:28:53] was the same
[1:28:54] then
[1:28:56] and in between
[1:28:58] and now and he'll still be that same
[1:29:00] christ tomorrow
[1:29:02] why because i've seen
[1:29:05] i've heard
[1:29:06] now i've got to act upon it
[1:29:08] i see the word of god to be true i see
[1:29:11] the message of the hour to be revealed
[1:29:13] now let me to go and live it now if i
[1:29:15] don't to reject it is what
[1:29:18] it's judgment
[1:29:19] but to receive it
[1:29:21] is life
[1:29:22] there's grace for you right there to
[1:29:24] receive the word is life
[1:29:27] to receive the whole word is the life of
[1:29:31] christ living through you
[1:29:34] because it is the word of god
[1:29:36] have we fallen in love with christ
[1:29:40] where we can't help
[1:29:41] but obey the word
[1:29:43] have we fallen in love with god so much
[1:29:47] you can't help but you make a mistake
[1:29:49] you do something wrong he said lord
[1:29:50] forgive me immediately
[1:29:53] you can't just go around sinning and not
[1:29:54] feel bad about it if there's a holy
[1:29:56] spirit inside of you
[1:29:57] it will make you act different it will
[1:30:00] make you do things different now it may
[1:30:03] not happen overnight
[1:30:05] because your body has to come under
[1:30:06] subjection but there will be a change
[1:30:08] and it may be gradual i may not see it
[1:30:10] you may not see it but only you know if
[1:30:13] god is dealing with your heart and if he
[1:30:16] is there will take change
[1:30:18] there will take a change little by
[1:30:19] little
[1:30:21] and as someday you will come in to the
[1:30:23] full maturity of the life of christ
[1:30:27] because why you are part of him
[1:30:30] you are already
[1:30:32] in christ now
[1:30:34] because you've taken on the word of god
[1:30:37] we've lost the feeling sometimes for for
[1:30:39] god we've grown cold sometimes in our
[1:30:41] prayer life maybe it's time for a
[1:30:43] checkup for every one of us you see are
[1:30:44] you preaching to me i'm preaching to
[1:30:46] myself
[1:30:47] maybe i need to check my prayer life
[1:30:49] do i need to pray more yes i do
[1:30:51] do i need to get down before god more
[1:30:53] yes i do
[1:30:54] the prophet of god said a christian
[1:30:56] reads his bible and prays every day
[1:30:59] i need to do more of that
[1:31:01] you said but now it doesn't come from
[1:31:02] just doing the deed
[1:31:04] but believing what you're reading
[1:31:07] an action will follow
[1:31:09] an action will follow
[1:31:11] i want to live this life according to
[1:31:13] the word of god brotherham says this and
[1:31:16] i'm about to run out of time so i'll
[1:31:17] close shortly
[1:31:19] he said why he's in his church universal
[1:31:22] the great holy apostolic pentecostal
[1:31:24] catholic church what a name
[1:31:27] around the world
[1:31:28] jesus in every member
[1:31:31] and every member
[1:31:32] he was only in one man
[1:31:35] god was then
[1:31:36] now god's in his whole church
[1:31:40] right this hour people's being healed
[1:31:43] somebody right here i believe can be
[1:31:44] healed right now why because christ is
[1:31:46] in this universal church
[1:31:49] he's not a god of far off he's a god
[1:31:51] it's a present god he's a present help
[1:31:54] in the time of trouble
[1:31:57] right this very minute people's
[1:31:58] receiving the holy ghost you believe
[1:32:00] that
[1:32:01] people can be refilled with that same
[1:32:03] holy ghost here tonight do you believe
[1:32:05] that
[1:32:07] if he was just standing here alone in a
[1:32:09] man form as he was then he could only be
[1:32:12] talking to this audience
[1:32:15] but now he talks the world over
[1:32:17] by the holy ghost
[1:32:19] he's speaking through individuals
[1:32:22] all over the world
[1:32:24] by the holy ghost he's speaking to you
[1:32:26] right now
[1:32:27] by the holy ghost
[1:32:29] he says is it you speaking no it may be
[1:32:31] something right in here talking to you
[1:32:32] it's the holy ghost in you
[1:32:34] that is saying yes that's true i need to
[1:32:37] do that lord help me obey and line my
[1:32:40] life up to the word
[1:32:41] not something i have to do but something
[1:32:44] i want to do
[1:32:46] a life i want to live i want to live
[1:32:49] the way he wants me to live
[1:32:51] i want to give
[1:32:53] to god's people
[1:32:55] the way he gave to god's people
[1:32:59] nobody gave a better sacrifice
[1:33:02] but he went in obedience to the word of
[1:33:04] god
[1:33:06] so there she was she's talking about
[1:33:08] this prostitute woman and we'll be
[1:33:10] closing shortly she's talking about this
[1:33:11] little woman is washing his feet there
[1:33:13] she was in his presence she moved around
[1:33:15] i can see those little eyes look at her
[1:33:18] and her heart nearly failed
[1:33:20] there's the man that forgive that woman
[1:33:22] and note her heart he knew that woman of
[1:33:24] samaria
[1:33:26] he knew she had five husbands
[1:33:28] he knows how guilty i am he does
[1:33:31] he knows how guilty i am
[1:33:33] he knows how guilty you are he knows
[1:33:36] just how low down
[1:33:38] every one of us are
[1:33:40] he knows us
[1:33:42] she looked him in the face and she
[1:33:43] recognized it
[1:33:45] now she never looked over at the
[1:33:46] pharisees
[1:33:48] or looked at the charts to see how many
[1:33:50] members belonged to the church whether
[1:33:52] she joined it or not
[1:33:54] she looked at jesus
[1:33:56] and she felt guilty
[1:33:58] listen church can you look at the blood
[1:34:01] of christ or the sacrifice we have and
[1:34:02] not feel a little guilty
[1:34:04] if you can
[1:34:05] you need a checkup
[1:34:08] she couldn't hold her tears any longer
[1:34:10] she looked down at his feet and the
[1:34:12] tears began to drop off on his feet she
[1:34:14] was so ashamed she fell down on her
[1:34:16] knees she and he'd seen her she couldn't
[1:34:19] hold her tears any longer there's
[1:34:21] something about when you get around
[1:34:22] jesus you start crying not some cold not
[1:34:26] some starchy cold confessions and
[1:34:29] putting your name on the book and
[1:34:30] joining the church you've got to die to
[1:34:33] yourself and be born anew
[1:34:36] can you die out to yourself no but he
[1:34:39] can bring a spirit into you that can
[1:34:41] cause the old nature to die and the new
[1:34:44] life of christ can take hold of you
[1:34:47] something that god does
[1:34:49] and what we do
[1:34:51] is yield to him
[1:34:53] and the word will take an effect in our
[1:34:56] lives
[1:34:58] that was preached in the message the
[1:34:59] meanest man i know
[1:35:02] you ever known any of those
[1:35:05] no matter how far you've gone
[1:35:07] there's still a way back
[1:35:09] no matter what you've done
[1:35:11] there's still forgiveness
[1:35:13] if you repent
[1:35:15] no matter
[1:35:17] how far
[1:35:18] that little woman went into sin
[1:35:20] when she seen jesus
[1:35:23] she repented in her heart maybe she
[1:35:25] didn't say a word to him maybe she
[1:35:28] couldn't say nothing in the moment
[1:35:30] but there was something inside of her a
[1:35:33] broken and a contrite heart it wasn't no
[1:35:35] cold form formal stiff neck person that
[1:35:38] come down to the altar and they come
[1:35:40] down for a show and they get up and they
[1:35:42] fix their coat and walk back to their
[1:35:43] seat why because she had seen jesus and
[1:35:47] i can't help but look out here tonight
[1:35:49] and see a part of christ sitting in the
[1:35:51] building and i can't help but think if
[1:35:53] he can forgive you and he can forgive me
[1:35:55] then he can forgive the lowest sinner in
[1:35:57] the city if we can forgive and we can
[1:36:00] repent and we can go forward into the
[1:36:02] word of god and believe that the word of
[1:36:04] god is still real and is still on the
[1:36:06] throne the god of abraham isaac and
[1:36:09] jacob the god that come down and came in
[1:36:12] the flesh of jesus was the same god
[1:36:14] that's here today he came down on the
[1:36:16] prophet and he showed us that christ was
[1:36:18] alive that he's still god
[1:36:21] god never died he's still god he had no
[1:36:23] beginning he has no end he's still here
[1:36:26] living in and through you today
[1:36:30] when the holy ghost comes inside of you
[1:36:33] it will change your life
[1:36:36] jesus said if you love me
[1:36:38] do what i say
[1:36:40] brother branham talks about it
[1:36:42] and this is not in my notes so i'll be
[1:36:43] careful
[1:36:44] jesus brother bram talks about
[1:36:47] when you say you believe
[1:36:50] and you don't do what you say
[1:36:53] you're just a liar
[1:36:54] and the truth is not in you
[1:36:57] there's nothing there's nothing worse
[1:36:58] than a person that says i believe
[1:36:59] everything the bible says
[1:37:02] and then when it says assemble
[1:37:03] yourselves together oh but that was for
[1:37:05] the apostles
[1:37:07] when it says
[1:37:09] and i hope you're hearing me i know
[1:37:10] you're tired i'll close shortly i hope
[1:37:14] if not you can set me down shortly
[1:37:18] he said
[1:37:19] when you think about this when the
[1:37:21] people
[1:37:22] brother branham said that in the baptist
[1:37:24] i i was able to talk to a man one time
[1:37:25] and he said well the the apostles were
[1:37:28] sent to go out and go into all the world
[1:37:29] and preach the gospel but that's not for
[1:37:31] us
[1:37:32] these signs shall follow them that
[1:37:34] believe
[1:37:35] in my name they shall cast out devils do
[1:37:38] you believe that's true if it's true
[1:37:40] it's still happening
[1:37:42] anything god ever put in the church
[1:37:44] is still in the church
[1:37:46] it still has an effect on the people
[1:37:48] it's still true because it's the word of
[1:37:51] god and if god can't change his word
[1:37:54] can't change
[1:37:55] nothing can change as the musicians come
[1:38:01] i wasn't kidding
[1:38:02] let us stand together
[1:38:04] brother branham says this in a prayer
[1:38:08] and this struck my heart
[1:38:10] he said our heavenly father we thank
[1:38:11] thee for every gracious word that's
[1:38:13] written in this bible
[1:38:14] seeing that we are compassed about
[1:38:17] with such a great of cloud of witness
[1:38:20] two and a half million people died
[1:38:21] perishing in the wilderness of unbelief
[1:38:23] and only two that believed
[1:38:25] was permitted to go over
[1:38:27] father god i pray you help us to see
[1:38:30] that
[1:38:31] and look to what it means
[1:38:34] let us not be disbelievers in thy word
[1:38:37] but may we not only be hearers
[1:38:40] but doers
[1:38:41] of the word he said grant it lord can we
[1:38:44] say granted lord
[1:38:46] i don't want to just i don't want to
[1:38:47] just hear the word
[1:38:48] i want to go act on it
[1:38:51] i don't want to just be a so-called
[1:38:53] message believer
[1:38:55] i want to live the message
[1:38:56] let the message come in me and live
[1:38:58] through me to where when the world looks
[1:39:00] at me yes i may look different i may
[1:39:01] look strange but i can tell you this
[1:39:03] there's going to be a day when we're all
[1:39:05] gathered
[1:39:06] in a rapture not in this place or that
[1:39:08] place but universal rapture
[1:39:10] and we're going to look strange maybe
[1:39:12] then too one another we're going to
[1:39:13] start seeing body changes take place
[1:39:16] but think about it when you believe the
[1:39:17] word there's a reward
[1:39:19] for that believing
[1:39:21] that's coming amen and i believe we can
[1:39:23] also be blessed now
[1:39:25] through healing
[1:39:26] through the holy ghost moving in the
[1:39:28] services
[1:39:29] the presence of the lord settling among
[1:39:30] us by believing and obeying the word of
[1:39:33] god
[1:39:34] let's bow our heads as musicians would
[1:39:36] play
[1:39:38] something brother braham says this i'll
[1:39:41] just read it as they're playing
[1:39:43] he's what we need today is some
[1:39:44] old-fashioned revivals
[1:39:47] some sweeping
[1:39:48] revivals
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:51] power of the lord we need men and women
[1:39:53] who's willing to sell out to everything
[1:39:54] in this world to burn every bridge
[1:39:56] behind them
[1:39:58] we need to take the world today we
[1:40:00] ministers like the old norwegians used
[1:40:02] to take a country when they went in by
[1:40:04] ship and they hit the shore and set the
[1:40:06] ship of fire and burned it behind them
[1:40:07] they had no way of escape that's the way
[1:40:09] we ought to do it burn every bridge and
[1:40:11] every escape sell out everything
[1:40:15] for the kingdom of god and keep moving
[1:40:17] on there's no place of stopping there's
[1:40:20] no place for compromising
[1:40:23] but we can believe the whole word of god
[1:40:25] do you believe with all your hearts
[1:40:29] your heavenly father lord as we come
[1:40:30] this service lord
[1:40:33] lord if there's an unbelieving spirit if
[1:40:34] there's a doubt in the heart of a person
[1:40:37] here
[1:40:39] maybe they've struggled like naaman
[1:40:42] but nevertheless that's your word
[1:40:44] he went ahead and did it anyway though
[1:40:46] it sounded foolish
[1:40:48] when he went down the seventh time he
[1:40:50] come up with the skin like of a child it
[1:40:52] was soft it was new it was healed
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] we obey the word of god i believe even
[1:40:58] now
[1:40:59] that word of god can take an effect in
[1:41:01] our lives
[1:41:02] and make us anew we can be cleansed
[1:41:06] go thou and be clean
[1:41:10] may we take this word
[1:41:12] and go
[1:41:14] believing
[1:41:16] acting
[1:41:17] and receive our blessing
[1:41:20] in jesus name
[1:41:22] if there's one in here
[1:41:24] who's dealing with a spirit of unbelief
[1:41:28] let this be the day when you cast that
[1:41:30] unbelief down he's still a god of second
[1:41:33] chances
[1:41:34] he's still a god
[1:41:35] [Music]
[1:41:37] not of rules
[1:41:38] but of grace
[1:41:41] he can forgive you
[1:41:43] for that unbelieving spirit
[1:41:47] if there's one if you would slip your
[1:41:48] hand up to him
[1:41:50] i believe there's a god here
[1:41:52] who will answer that
[1:41:54] prayer today
[1:41:56] as we sing that to him he became
[1:42:01] he
