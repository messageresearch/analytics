[21:35] ing despair
[21:38] when he came
[21:41] to me there

[39:08] this evening been through some hard
[39:10] times but I'm not giving up amen if you
[39:13] have your Bibles let's turn to Matthew 7
[39:15] and 24.
[39:17] then also Luke 6 and 47
[39:20] it's been an owner being here today I
[39:22] pray something was said this morning
[39:24] that was a blessing
[39:26] um I'll try to keep it short tonight but
[39:29] it's good to have brother Dylan with me
[39:30] he uh my wife we had a baby two weeks
[39:34] ago so she hasn't been traveling with me
[39:36] but Dylan's been my wife this weekend so
[39:39] is cooking ain't too very good but
[39:42] anyways
[39:43] now we've had fast food this weekend so
[39:46] bless his heart but Matthew 7 and 24
[39:49] therefore whosoever heareth these
[39:51] sayings of mine and do with them I will
[39:54] liken him unto a wise men which built
[39:57] his house upon a rock and the rain
[39:59] descended and the floods came and the
[40:01] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[40:03] it fell not for it was founded upon a
[40:06] rock and everyone that hearethy sayings
[40:08] of mind and doeth them not shall be
[40:10] likened unto a foolish man who built his
[40:13] house upon the sand and the rain
[40:15] descended and the floods came the winds
[40:17] blew and beat upon that house and it
[40:20] fell and great was the fall of it and in
[40:22] Luke 6 and 47 who I like about that
[40:25] scripture was it was the same winds the
[40:27] same rains there was the same pressure
[40:29] but two different results there was two
[40:32] different foundations bringing forth two
[40:34] different results you look at Luke 6 and
[40:36] 47 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[40:40] sayings and doeth them I will show you
[40:42] to whom he is like he is like a man
[40:45] which built up built a house and and dig
[40:47] deep and lay the foundation upon a rock
[40:50] and when the floods arose the stream
[40:53] beat vehemently upon that house and
[40:55] could not shake it for it was founded
[40:57] upon a rock can we bow our heads this
[41:00] evening dear gracious Heavenly Father
[41:02] Lord we thank you for your grace and
[41:04] your mercy of love your love that you've
[41:06] given us father Lord as we come into
[41:08] your house one more time I ask that you
[41:11] would anoint us Lord As I Lay myself
[41:13] aside Lord I ask that you would speak
[41:14] through these lips of clay father Lord
[41:16] you know the needs that are in the
[41:18] building Lord I ask that you would speak
[41:20] to the heart speak to the needs father
[41:21] Lord we ask these things in your
[41:24] precious name amen you may be seated
[41:27] and I'm just going to continue on what I
[41:29] spoke on this morning on the season of
[41:31] pressure but we're living in a shaky
[41:33] time it's a time of pressure it's coming
[41:36] against homes it's coming against
[41:37] families churches marriages young people
[41:40] Elders you're not immune to pressure you
[41:43] say people don't lose their temper right
[41:46] away but it's pressure upon pressure
[41:48] upon pressure and there finally comes an
[41:51] explosion and I believe that's what the
[41:53] devil is trying to do in this day is by
[41:57] pressure he's trying to get people to
[41:59] turn away from their faith to turn away
[42:01] from the things of God it's pressure
[42:03] coming against the church and brother
[42:06] Branham says see full of pressure
[42:08] doctors are that way nurses are that way
[42:10] psychiatrists are doctoring
[42:12] psychiatrists pressure he said
[42:14] something's wrong seems so strange the
[42:16] whole world is going some way the
[42:19] nervous are doctoring the nervous but
[42:21] you know you but you know in all of it
[42:22] the doctors doesn't seem to have the
[42:24] answer the hospital the Medics they
[42:27] don't have the answer because they're
[42:28] nervous too but there's only one that
[42:31] has the answer that's God he is the
[42:34] answer he says the nervous are Doctrine
[42:36] the nervous the psychiatrists are
[42:38] doctoring a psychiatrist pressure is
[42:41] getting to the people that are supposed
[42:43] to have the answers pressure is getting
[42:45] to the people that are supposed to have
[42:47] the solutions supposed to have the ones
[42:50] you're supposed to go to that you can
[42:52] trust they're buckling under the
[42:55] pressure you know brother Branham says
[42:56] you can walk out on the street and feel
[42:58] the pressure he says you can see uh you
[43:02] see a young man going down the road 60
[43:03] miles an hour he's trying to hurry up
[43:05] and get home he says he gets home and
[43:07] supper ain't ready yet because he's home
[43:09] too early he says then his wife says
[43:12] something smart and then they get into a
[43:13] spat he says what is it pressure has
[43:15] built up and it's caused an explosion
[43:18] the Bible says men or men's hearts are
[43:21] failing them for fear what is it it's
[43:24] pressure there's no security in politics
[43:26] there there's no security in National
[43:29] Security but you see God has given us
[43:32] something in this generation in an
[43:34] uncertain time he's given us a security
[43:36] where we can found our life upon we can
[43:40] build our house upon a foundation and
[43:43] know even though it is a shaky time even
[43:45] though it's an uncertain time we've got
[43:48] some certainty brother Branham says oh
[43:50] we we have unrest among the Nations
[43:52] Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom
[43:55] against Kingdom be perplexed of time to
[43:58] stress between nations the sea roaring
[44:00] why the world seems like it's in a
[44:02] nervous prostration another thing our
[44:04] jobs our jobs are so uncertain I was
[44:07] talking to a young man uh just returned
[44:09] from the Army back in the hall come back
[44:12] he had no job and you don't know one day
[44:14] from the next whether somebody is going
[44:16] you're going to get up to a place of
[44:18] seniority and somebody steps down to
[44:20] keep from being retired and I find
[44:22] something against you and now you're on
[44:24] the street you've got no job you're past
[44:26] 25 it don't get much good to look for a
[44:29] job now anyways he says it's a shaky
[44:31] time you see you can't rely on on the
[44:34] stock market you can't rely upon your
[44:36] job you can't rely upon a wealth of
[44:38] currency is going up and down we got
[44:41] nothing to put our confidence in but God
[44:44] has given us something in the midst of
[44:46] us in the midst of uncertainty he's
[44:49] given us a foundation you see I believe
[44:51] it is the separating time the Bible
[44:54] talks about the farmer that was showing
[44:56] the the seed of Wheat and then the enemy
[44:58] come along and he sold the tares and the
[45:01] Bible says that the servants come up to
[45:03] the farmer and says do we go and pluck
[45:06] up the Terrors he says no but just in
[45:08] case we don't want to pluck Up the Weed
[45:10] as well but wait till the Harvest time
[45:13] whenever they're whenever they're coming
[45:15] forth and bringing forth fruit he says
[45:17] then go pluck up the tears bind them for
[45:19] the burning but you gather up the wheat
[45:22] to go into the barn and so it was a
[45:24] separating time brother Branham says let
[45:27] them they'll be filthy be filthy still
[45:29] let them they'll be holy be holy seal
[45:32] still so the seed hasn't changed but the
[45:35] only thing is is now they're bringing
[45:37] forth fruit they're bringing forth what
[45:39] is on the inside and so that's why we
[45:42] see so many people that was raised up in
[45:44] a message church so many people that
[45:46] said on a Pew but then the pressure got
[45:48] to them and then they turned away and
[45:51] started to manifest the fruit that was
[45:54] really on the inside you see that's what
[45:57] the pressure does pressure shows what is
[46:00] on the inside you know like I said this
[46:02] morning pressure will show your
[46:04] character character is who you are
[46:06] whenever you're by yourself you can wear
[46:08] a nice suit you can have long hair long
[46:10] dresses but what are you when the
[46:12] pressure gets to you if when you're on
[46:14] the jobs title or or you're home with
[46:16] the children you see pressure is going
[46:18] to bring out what is only against sign
[46:21] but I believe that we can live in the
[46:23] midst of the pressure but still bringing
[46:26] forth the life of Jesus Christ we don't
[46:29] got to bring forth the life of a
[46:30] hypocrite the life of a make-believer
[46:32] but in the midst of laodicea the most
[46:35] wicked day that there is there can be a
[46:38] virtuous life that is the living in the
[46:41] midst of chaos the world is looking for
[46:43] a living God the world is looking for a
[46:46] genuine savior the looking for reality
[46:48] and you've got what the world is looking
[46:51] for in in every pill that the drug
[46:54] addict takes he's looking for something
[46:56] and every drink the trunk drinks he's
[46:59] looking for something the woman of the
[47:01] whale every man that she went with she
[47:04] was looking for a satisfaction but one
[47:07] day the satisfaction come by her way and
[47:10] she was never the same you've got what
[47:13] the world is looking for in the midst of
[47:16] the pressure you've got what the world
[47:19] is looking for but we see it taking
[47:21] place all over preachers uh song leaders
[47:24] deacons all of them are turning away
[47:26] from them a message where we thought
[47:28] they were Charlotte men but they never
[47:30] was built upon the foundation they
[47:33] claimed the message as their own they
[47:35] claimed the prophet as their own but
[47:37] once it come to building upon it you see
[47:40] you can claim to be a message believer
[47:42] but if you're not building your house
[47:44] upon it it's not going to do you any
[47:46] good you know I can say if I'm building
[47:48] a house I can say my Foundation is right
[47:51] over there that's where I'm building my
[47:53] house but if my house is over here
[47:55] clearly my house ain't on the foundation
[47:58] that I'm claiming it to be on but in
[48:00] order for it to be on that Foundation I
[48:03] gotta build I've got to construct I've
[48:05] got to base everything that I'm doing on
[48:08] that Foundation come on somebody and in
[48:10] order for the message to be your
[48:12] foundation it's got to dictate or it's
[48:15] got a bigger thought pattern It's gotta
[48:17] might be our belief system you see I
[48:20] don't believe the message it's just
[48:21] opinions I don't believe the message is
[48:24] just good ideas but the message is to be
[48:26] the absolute to the pride of Christ what
[48:29] is the absolute brother Josh it's the
[48:31] final sayup it's the typos it's what you
[48:34] point back to you know uh whenever
[48:37] you're in a discussion and somebody
[48:38] brings up uh when somebody brings up a
[48:41] uh the Trinity you're pointing right
[48:43] back to scripture and they can say well
[48:45] I don't believe it that way but you've
[48:47] got an absolute that you're tied to and
[48:49] I believe we can tie ourselves to the
[48:52] word and say Satan you can bring up all
[48:54] the pressures that you want to bring up
[48:56] but I'm tied to something that is
[48:59] unmovable oh my your shame we're living
[49:02] in a day of pressure it's more than just
[49:05] an idea of pressure but it's a reality
[49:07] There's real pressure coming against the
[49:10] minds that's coming against bodies it's
[49:12] coming to get Spirits it's coming
[49:14] against you trying to destroy your soul
[49:17] but God has given us something that is
[49:19] anchored or so in the midst of the
[49:22] pressure oh my you see the word is given
[49:25] us right and wrong I believe this
[49:27] message has given us right and wrong you
[49:30] know brother Branham says that there's a
[49:31] Razor's Edge difference between rights
[49:34] and wrong you look at the world of the
[49:36] world don't know if they're boys they
[49:37] don't know if they're girls they don't
[49:38] know what they are and in the midst of
[49:40] confusion God has given us certainty
[49:43] where we can know what is right you see
[49:46] this the message has given us the
[49:48] blueprint of the word of God he's there
[49:50] the message has given us an insight to
[49:53] what was in God's mind before the
[49:55] foundation of the world but not only
[49:57] what was in God's mind but he let us
[50:00] know the tactics of the devil and let us
[50:03] know what he is doing in this day that's
[50:05] why the message must be the absolute
[50:08] because if it's not we're going to
[50:10] dismiss what we don't like we're going
[50:12] to dismiss what we don't want to hear
[50:15] come on somebody we're gonna start to
[50:18] dismiss it and start to embrace our
[50:20] opinions
[50:21] oh my you see you see how the Bible says
[50:24] in First Corinthians 3 and 10 according
[50:27] to the grace of God which is given unto
[50:29] me as a wise master builder I have laid
[50:32] the foundation and another build of
[50:34] their own but let every man take heed
[50:36] how he buildeth thereupon for another
[50:39] Foundation can no man lay that which is
[50:42] laid and which is Jesus Christ now if
[50:44] any man build upon this Foundation gold
[50:47] silver precious stones wood hey stubble
[50:49] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[50:52] for the day shall declare him because it
[50:55] shall be revealed by fire and the fire
[50:57] shall try every man's work of what sort
[51:00] it is he says there's only one
[51:02] Foundation that you can build upon but
[51:05] he says there's many foundations he says
[51:07] there's gold there there's wood there's
[51:09] Treasures there's good Stones you can
[51:11] build upon but what's going to withstand
[51:14] the pressure he says the fire is going
[51:17] to try every man's work and see what
[51:20] sort it is oh my so the pressure is
[51:23] going to try the foundation and whatever
[51:26] your foundation is upon is how it's
[51:29] going to respond to the pressure you
[51:32] look at First Peter 4 and 12 11 thinking
[51:35] not strange concerning the fiery trial
[51:37] which is to try you as though something
[51:39] strange happened unto you so the
[51:42] pressure is coming and is determining
[51:45] what you're built upon but what I love
[51:48] about this is it's having an opposite
[51:50] effect upon the rhyme the same pressure
[51:53] that is causing many to backslide the
[51:56] same pressure that is causing many to
[51:58] turn away from the message is the same
[52:01] pressure that is that that is giving an
[52:04] assurance to the bride that what I'm
[52:06] standing upon is the truth well others
[52:10] are falling away I'm standing while
[52:12] other marriages are falling away I'm
[52:15] standing while other families are
[52:17] falling apart I'm standing the pressure
[52:20] is letting you know what you've got is
[52:23] the truth oh my the Baptists are trying
[52:26] but they can't do it but sure doing it
[52:29] come on somebody the pressure is letting
[52:32] you know what you've got here's the
[52:34] truth
[52:35] and if you know what you got is the
[52:37] truth stand upon it build upon it base
[52:41] your life upon him you see the Bible
[52:43] says whosoever Hearth these chains of
[52:45] mine and do with him I will liken him
[52:48] unto a wise man which built this house
[52:51] upon a rock so it goes more than just
[52:54] hearing it we got to put it into action
[52:56] oh come on now we can't just hear it but
[53:00] it goes from hearing it to doing it to
[53:02] putting it in the action that's a better
[53:04] get into action that's why I say the
[53:07] message has to be the absolute because
[53:09] you're never going to put it into action
[53:11] if it's not because if you think it's
[53:13] this way then you hear the message says
[53:16] this way oh God I think it's this way
[53:18] you're going to walk down another path
[53:20] you're going down another Direction but
[53:22] if you want to go in the direction that
[53:25] the bride is moving the message has to
[53:28] be your foundation but the Branham says
[53:30] the move is on for the Bride Watch the
[53:32] move on the bride it's the message of
[53:35] Malachi or let us removing the bride in
[53:38] a Direction Where The World Is Gonna Get
[53:40] You Ready for a tribulation the pride is
[53:43] getting ready for the Millennium the
[53:45] pride is getting ready for the marriage
[53:48] supper of the Lamb what is doing it the
[53:51] direction is based upon what you're
[53:53] building upon oh Hallelujah it all
[53:57] starts with your foundation what are
[54:00] your basing your house upon oh my you
[54:04] see brother Branham says this Moses
[54:06] scriptural sign he was that great
[54:08] prophet of God that went down there to
[54:10] deliver them and they recognized that
[54:12] they recognized the sign he was the
[54:14] exact scripture promise Vindicated he
[54:17] says Jesus was the promise of scripture
[54:20] Vindicated to the woman or he Jesus uh
[54:23] he says oh he was the interpretation
[54:24] Jesus was the interpretation of the
[54:27] scripture his own life interpreted the
[54:30] scripture then he says don't you see the
[54:32] message of the hour can be recognized
[54:34] Where We Are the message itself from the
[54:38] scripture interprets to you the hour we
[54:41] are living it is the interpretation oh
[54:44] my you see I got into a discussion the
[54:46] other day uh about the absolute and the
[54:49] brother says that the Bible is my
[54:51] absolute not the message and I agreed
[54:54] with him the Bible is my absolute but
[54:56] what is the interpretation of the Bible
[54:58] without the message
[55:00] come on now the brother brother Branham
[55:02] says Revelations is a book of symbols
[55:04] how can we understand the symbols
[55:06] without the interpretation of the
[55:09] symbols I don't believe whenever I say
[55:11] the message it's my absolute that I'm
[55:13] separating it from the Bible but we know
[55:16] what the Bible says because of the
[55:19] message come on now I don't believe in
[55:21] dear find brother Branham I'm not saying
[55:23] if he like cherry pie that's the
[55:25] absolute we're supposed to be eating
[55:27] cherry pie I don't believe that but the
[55:29] scripture interpretation that he brought
[55:32] is to be the foundation of the Bride is
[55:35] to build upon it is the absolute that is
[55:38] pushing it it is the typos oh man
[55:41] there's there's doctrines all over the
[55:43] place you see everybody has the same
[55:45] Bible that we are reading out of but
[55:48] there's thousands of the nominations
[55:49] there's thousands of interpretation we
[55:52] needed somebody to come and bring the
[55:55] interpretation and say there's not three
[55:57] Gods there's one God uh evening and even
[56:00] an apple it was a sex act we needed the
[56:03] interpretation to bring us back to the
[56:06] foundation oh man it is the foundation
[56:09] that the apostles laid is what we are
[56:12] building upon
[56:14] Hallelujah it is the foundation but the
[56:17] random says this and then next the
[56:19] message that opened up the Seven Seals
[56:21] which which undone all the hidden
[56:23] mysteries of the Bible the doctrines and
[56:26] so forth which the world so rudely
[56:28] attached nowadays attacks it and says
[56:31] the truth he says here the other day in
[56:33] Arizona splashing tapes to try to make
[56:35] me say things that I didn't say just
[56:37] remember the vision about Arizona uh the
[56:40] proposition the Bible says it was far
[56:42] better for you to have a rock at your
[56:44] neck and another thing whosoever let him
[56:47] be a preacher or what he will will take
[56:49] one word from it or add one word to it
[56:52] people putting their own interpretation
[56:54] upon the word as it's been given trying
[56:57] to make it say something that I did not
[56:59] say he says not my word it is his word
[57:03] and I say Amen to that this message was
[57:06] not a word from a hillbillion from
[57:08] Kentucky but it was the word from
[57:11] almighty God to the bride that she can
[57:13] build her life upon and go in a
[57:16] direction
[57:17] oh my we can move in a direction and
[57:21] know that in the midst of insanity we've
[57:24] got something changed that we can build
[57:26] upon so Jesus is saying if you take the
[57:30] word that I'm bringing I will build the
[57:32] house oh my I'm going to build the house
[57:35] what did what did Jesus tell Peter Upon
[57:38] This Rock I will build my church what is
[57:41] that rock it's the rocket Revelation so
[57:44] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[57:47] the foundation that the bride is going
[57:50] to build upon and that that is just
[57:52] something that struck me the other day
[57:54] once you choose the right foundation it
[57:57] goes from you trying to build the house
[57:58] and now God is building the house how is
[58:01] he building it by you applying the word
[58:04] then the word starts to build up the
[58:07] house oh Hallelujah that's why this
[58:10] bride cannot fall because it's built up
[58:12] by the word that's where this bride
[58:14] can't be deceived because she's built up
[58:17] by the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus
[58:20] is making a personal claim not a man a
[58:23] man's not going to build my church the
[58:25] pope ain't gonna build my church the
[58:27] bishop ain't gonna build my church but I
[58:30] am going to build my church upon the
[58:32] revelation of who I am and he was
[58:35] letting Peter know this is the
[58:37] foundation not your Sensations not your
[58:40] opinions not on your emotions but this
[58:43] the revelation of who I am you go and
[58:46] you preach that because that is what I'm
[58:49] building my church upon oh my you look
[58:52] at First Corinthians 3 and 16. know
[58:54] you're not that ye are the temple of God
[58:57] and so the house the God is going to
[59:00] dwell in is your life you're the house
[59:03] that is going to come and dwell in if
[59:06] it's on the right foundation oh my look
[59:08] at Colossians 2 and 7 rooted and built
[59:11] up in him and established in the faith
[59:13] and she had been and taught abounding
[59:16] therein with Thanksgiving rooted and
[59:18] built up in him so we're not being
[59:21] rooted in man's ideas and man's opinions
[59:23] but we're established upon the saith the
[59:26] Lord which is the revelation of Jesus
[59:29] Christ in the beginning was the word the
[59:32] word was with God and the Word was God
[59:34] and I believe that's what we're being
[59:37] built in is the word of God we're being
[59:39] built in something solid but the Branham
[59:42] says well you've got the same Choice
[59:44] today she's fixing to bring forth the
[59:46] perfect word back there and the word is
[59:49] coming for the word bride he says the
[59:51] woman is a part of a man taken from him
[59:54] so the church will have to be a word
[59:57] abiding church every word of the Bible
[1:00:00] not systems not dogmas or nothing added
[1:00:03] to it it'll have to be the unadulterated
[1:00:06] pure virgin word that's right and I say
[1:00:09] that's what we've got in this generation
[1:00:11] and what the word wasn't defiled but it
[1:00:14] was was the perfect word that was
[1:00:16] brought from the mind of God for us to
[1:00:19] build our life upon oh man you believe
[1:00:22] that this evening and I believe that we
[1:00:24] are an invincible Army that is Walking
[1:00:27] In Step you look at Ephesians 2 and 19.
[1:00:29] now therefore you are no more strangers
[1:00:32] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[1:00:35] the Saints and of the household of God
[1:00:37] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:00:41] Apostles Helm the prophets Jesus Christ
[1:00:44] himself being the Chief Cornerstone we
[1:00:47] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:00:50] prophets and the apostles so that's what
[1:00:53] this message come to do is to bring us
[1:00:55] back to the foundation that the
[1:00:57] denominational systems got off of oh my
[1:01:01] you see there's no rapturing faith in
[1:01:04] the foundation of the nominations but
[1:01:06] there is rapturing Faith on the the
[1:01:08] foundation of the Apostles that's why
[1:01:11] this Bride is a marching and staff it's
[1:01:14] because she's come back to the
[1:01:16] foundation that the apostles first laid
[1:01:18] oh my look out for Psalms 127 and 1 a
[1:01:22] song of degree for Solomon except the
[1:01:24] Lord built the house they labor in vain
[1:01:26] that building so we're not wanting to
[1:01:29] just build any house but we're wanting a
[1:01:31] house the God himself is building up the
[1:01:35] God himself is constructing oh my you
[1:01:39] all hope you're following me this
[1:01:40] evening I'm trying to move fast so I so
[1:01:42] if we can dismiss fast but you look at
[1:01:44] Joshua 24 and 14 it was Joshua's
[1:01:47] proclaiming as for me and my house we're
[1:01:50] going to serve the Lord and you notice
[1:01:53] he's making a statement about the
[1:01:55] promised land he wasn't wanting to build
[1:01:57] his house in the wilderness but he was
[1:02:00] wanting to build his house in the
[1:02:02] promised land Upon This Mountain upon
[1:02:04] his inheritance and that's what the
[1:02:06] attitude of the Bride has to be is I'm
[1:02:09] not building my house in the wilderness
[1:02:11] in confusion but I'm building my house
[1:02:14] upon thus saith the Lord this message is
[1:02:17] what is guiding us into our inheritance
[1:02:20] that's what I'm building my house upon
[1:02:23] the Gates of Hell May blow against your
[1:02:26] house but if you're on a solid
[1:02:28] foundation you can't be blown away
[1:02:31] hallelujah we're shining upon something
[1:02:33] solid brother random says I want to get
[1:02:36] this on God's word for after all this is
[1:02:38] the only foundation that anyone can
[1:02:41] build upon correctly God will never
[1:02:43] recognize any foundation but this word
[1:02:47] come on now remember God is building the
[1:02:50] house and the only way he will build the
[1:02:52] house if it is on the foundation of his
[1:02:55] word
[1:02:57] oh Mash I'm so glad God gave us a
[1:03:00] prophet in this generation to bring us
[1:03:02] back to the foundation so that Christ
[1:03:04] can come and dwell in the house so it
[1:03:07] matters what we're founded upon we don't
[1:03:09] want to build our families just on
[1:03:11] anything but we want to build our
[1:03:13] families on something that God is
[1:03:16] constructing you see uh I heard brother
[1:03:18] Branham say it the other day he was
[1:03:20] talking about he was in New York City
[1:03:22] and him and another brother was walking
[1:03:24] down the street and he's seen this big
[1:03:26] old building a beautiful building they
[1:03:27] said they went and shine and he says the
[1:03:29] interior was beautiful but he said there
[1:03:31] was one problem nobody was inside of it
[1:03:34] using it and he said he found one of the
[1:03:36] one of the men that was around there he
[1:03:38] went up to him and he says how come
[1:03:40] nobody's in this building how come
[1:03:42] nobody's using him and he says it's
[1:03:44] because the the Builder was so worried
[1:03:47] about the inside of him that he failed
[1:03:50] to dig the Footers deep enough and he
[1:03:52] says since the foundation ain't solid
[1:03:54] now the inside is going to start the
[1:03:56] crumble down he says that the building
[1:03:59] is starting to crumble down so nobody is
[1:04:02] wanting to dwell in the house because of
[1:04:04] the foundation and I thought my that's
[1:04:07] why many churches are they dormant
[1:04:09] that's why many families don't have the
[1:04:11] presence of God in it that's why many
[1:04:13] marriages don't have the presence of God
[1:04:15] in him because he's not going to do well
[1:04:17] in a house that is on the wrong
[1:04:19] Foundation come on somebody you might
[1:04:22] have to dig a little bit you might have
[1:04:24] to dig through man's ideas through man's
[1:04:27] opinions but if you dig deep enough you
[1:04:29] will find that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:04:32] yesterday today and forever oh you see
[1:04:35] man man's ideas has starting to twist up
[1:04:38] this message again but if you can push
[1:04:40] past all of man's ideas and just say
[1:04:43] what is on the tapes we are on the right
[1:04:46] foundation hey come on somebody but the
[1:04:49] Branham says God is The Interpreter of
[1:04:51] his own word so once God's
[1:04:53] interpretation comes we don't need a
[1:04:55] man's interpretation we need God's
[1:04:58] interpretation that is the foundation
[1:05:00] that God is building upon but the random
[1:05:03] says for you're not built upon the right
[1:05:05] foundation just if you're not built upon
[1:05:08] the right foundation it's just no good
[1:05:10] he says what's the use of the building
[1:05:12] of building upon a foundation that's
[1:05:14] already been condemned he says watch the
[1:05:16] goose he says what would be the use of
[1:05:19] trying to put paper in paint on an old
[1:05:21] building if the government has already
[1:05:23] condemned he says that's where many
[1:05:25] people are trying to do today by
[1:05:28] reforming they're trying to reform we'll
[1:05:30] start a church we'll turn a page we'll
[1:05:32] do something a little different than we
[1:05:33] used to do you'll never get anywhere
[1:05:35] like that it's just foolish to even try
[1:05:38] he says seeing you're only wasting your
[1:05:40] time well now if you believe that if you
[1:05:43] believe I believe I will stop quick I
[1:05:45] quit my lying and stealing all those
[1:05:47] things are good as they are you're still
[1:05:49] a million miles off of the road he says
[1:05:51] you've got to come back to the
[1:05:53] foundation you've got to build a new
[1:05:55] place not patch up the old one but build
[1:05:58] a brand new one you've got to come back
[1:06:00] Star right that's the reason you see so
[1:06:02] many faulty mistakes so many people
[1:06:04] indifferent people who profess
[1:06:06] Christianity
[1:06:08] he says that's why you see so many
[1:06:11] Hypocrites it's because they're built
[1:06:13] upon the wrong Foundation trying to
[1:06:16] build up a house but they're built on
[1:06:18] opinions they're built on ideas but God
[1:06:21] has given us a foundations here I know
[1:06:23] back home we've got many that buy old
[1:06:25] houses and fixes and fixes them up I
[1:06:27] don't know if anybody does that here but
[1:06:29] I've got an old house right my dad's go
[1:06:31] to old house I mean it's got old houses
[1:06:32] and we try to make them look good on the
[1:06:34] inside we can repaint them we can
[1:06:36] retexture them but if you don't do
[1:06:38] nothing with the foundation the pressure
[1:06:40] on the foundation is going to crack what
[1:06:43] is on the inside you see my dad has a
[1:06:45] big old tree on his front in his front
[1:06:47] yard and they're The Roots is starting
[1:06:49] to get under the foundation and even
[1:06:52] though he remodeled the inside of it the
[1:06:55] cabinets are Level the doors are level
[1:06:56] but since there's pressure upon the
[1:06:59] foundation it's starting to crack and
[1:07:01] now the inside is being affected of what
[1:07:05] is on the foundation come on now your
[1:07:07] family still look great and be great and
[1:07:09] wonderful but what about the foundation
[1:07:12] what are you built upon what are you
[1:07:14] striving upon because if it is on the
[1:07:17] wrong Foundation the pressure is going
[1:07:19] to get to the inside but if it's built
[1:07:22] upon thus saith the Lord the pressure
[1:07:24] can come against the foundation it can
[1:07:27] come against the inside but it will not
[1:07:29] prosper
[1:07:31] Hallelujah if you're built upon the
[1:07:33] right foundation no pressure let the
[1:07:36] devil send your way can't Prosper we can
[1:07:39] have families that are on fire we can
[1:07:41] have children that are on fire with the
[1:07:44] things of God but it comes to the right
[1:07:46] foundation oh my the foundation is
[1:07:49] messed up and now the doors are unlevel
[1:07:51] the cabinets are unlevel they're all
[1:07:53] uneven and that's exactly what brother
[1:07:55] Branham was talking about he says the
[1:07:58] foundation is wrong on this building and
[1:08:00] it's it's affecting the inside oh my I
[1:08:04] don't want to be a house that is
[1:08:06] unoccupied by God I want him to come and
[1:08:10] occupy my house my home my church oh my
[1:08:14] you see what destroys foundations it's
[1:08:17] Roots it's something that gets a next to
[1:08:20] the foundation and it starts to crack it
[1:08:22] it starts to make it crumble and that's
[1:08:24] where many people fall as they start to
[1:08:27] build upon a foundation but then they'll
[1:08:29] let Roots come and they file them let
[1:08:31] the root of bitterness come when he
[1:08:33] found him they left lukewarmness come
[1:08:34] and he file it the formalism come and he
[1:08:37] file it and now the roots is disrupting
[1:08:40] the foundation but if we dig deep enough
[1:08:43] not in complexes not not in bitterness
[1:08:46] but if we dig deep enough upon the
[1:08:49] foundation of the word there's no roots
[1:08:51] can disrupt us
[1:08:54] Hebrews 12 and 15 looking diligently
[1:08:57] lest any man should fall from the grace
[1:08:59] of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:09:01] bringing up trouble you thereby many be
[1:09:05] devoured he didn't stay all was defiled
[1:09:08] he says many are defiled by the root of
[1:09:11] bitterness and I'm so glad he put just
[1:09:13] many not all because in the midst of
[1:09:16] people being defiled were standing we're
[1:09:20] not being defiled by bitterness we're
[1:09:22] not being defiled by lukewarmness but
[1:09:24] we're standing against it you see that
[1:09:27] that offense that comes against your
[1:09:29] foundation must be dealt with this
[1:09:31] morning I talked about the offense that
[1:09:34] you got towards God but then there's
[1:09:36] offenses that you have toward your
[1:09:38] brother that you have to hurt your
[1:09:39] sister that you have towards the
[1:09:41] preacher towards the Deacon those are
[1:09:44] bitterness that is our roots of
[1:09:45] bitterness that is coming against your
[1:09:48] foundation but you notice that the Bible
[1:09:51] shows us how to deal with them you look
[1:09:53] at Matthew 16 and 22 then Peter took him
[1:09:57] and began to rebuke him saying being far
[1:10:00] from thee Lord there shall not be unto
[1:10:02] thee so Peter turns to Jesus and rebukes
[1:10:06] him and says what he is saying is not
[1:10:09] the truth and you would think this would
[1:10:10] hurt Jesus but instead of being offended
[1:10:13] at Peter look how he deals with it the
[1:10:17] next verse in Matthew 16 and 23 but he
[1:10:20] turned and set unto Peter get thee
[1:10:22] behind me Satan Thou Art and offense
[1:10:25] unto me so he turns the offense from
[1:10:28] Peter to the pressure come on now why
[1:10:32] did Jesus share what what about the
[1:10:34] brand I'm saying God hates and loves the
[1:10:36] sinner but hates the sin he separates
[1:10:39] the sin from the end of Israel and
[1:10:41] that's what we got to do with offenses
[1:10:43] if somebody hurts you you see they got
[1:10:46] the pressure got to them I'm not
[1:10:48] offended at my brother but I'm offended
[1:10:50] at the pressure I'm offended at the
[1:10:53] devil that is trying to disrupt Unity
[1:10:56] come on somebody Jesus did again
[1:10:59] offended at Peter but he had turned that
[1:11:01] offense and got offended half the devil
[1:11:04] and I think if there's ever a time to
[1:11:07] get offended of the devil it's this time
[1:11:09] we need to turn our offense towards the
[1:11:12] devil because what happens whenever you
[1:11:13] get offended at a brother you stop
[1:11:15] talking to them you stop talking to them
[1:11:18] and I think we need to stop talking and
[1:11:20] talking to the devil we need to stop
[1:11:22] talking to the spirit of unbelief we
[1:11:25] need to stop talking to the devil that's
[1:11:27] coming and trying to disrupt your
[1:11:30] foundation what happens when you get an
[1:11:32] offense at your brother you see it you
[1:11:34] see him coming this way you turn around
[1:11:36] and you walk the other way what's the
[1:11:39] Bible say shun the very the very
[1:11:41] appearance of evil I think we need to
[1:11:43] get offended at the Devil and say you
[1:11:46] know what there may be pressure coming
[1:11:48] against me but I'm turning the other way
[1:11:51] I'm not listening to the voices of the
[1:11:54] pressure who might turn the offense from
[1:11:57] the devil from Peter to the devil oh man
[1:12:01] I think if we put the message up in
[1:12:03] front of our family let me do the
[1:12:05] offenses we will have a house on fire oh
[1:12:09] my we'll have a house on fire not on the
[1:12:11] not with the things of the world but
[1:12:13] with the things of God you know brother
[1:12:15] Branham talks about the the one time
[1:12:17] there was a church that was on fire a
[1:12:19] natural fire and that the pastor the
[1:12:22] pastors turned around and he's seen a
[1:12:24] man that he hadn't seen in a long time
[1:12:26] he'll turn around and he says my my well
[1:12:28] I haven't seen you in a long time he
[1:12:30] says well I haven't seen the church on
[1:12:33] fire in a long time either I think if we
[1:12:35] get to house this on fire with the
[1:12:37] things of God that Revival will move
[1:12:39] into the church if we get families on
[1:12:42] fire with the things of God that Revival
[1:12:45] will come into the church the pastor
[1:12:47] don't bring the Revival families bring
[1:12:49] the Revival pastors don't bring the
[1:12:52] Revival in the homes you bring the
[1:12:55] Revival come on somebody this building
[1:12:57] ain't necessarily the church you're the
[1:12:59] church you're what the Revival is
[1:13:01] remember the Welsh Revival remember they
[1:13:04] were looking for the Welsh Revival and
[1:13:05] they come up to the to the placement and
[1:13:07] they said sir where's the Welsh Revival
[1:13:10] he says you're looking at it they said
[1:13:12] no no you don't understand where's the
[1:13:14] location of the Welsh Revival he says
[1:13:16] it's right here I am the Welsh Revival
[1:13:19] he was Tabernacle the Revival Hallelujah
[1:13:23] I think it's time that we Tabernacle the
[1:13:26] bride's Revival what is the branch
[1:13:28] Revival it's a word Revival it's arrived
[1:13:31] the soul the seed that was on the inside
[1:13:34] Hallelujah this message has come to a
[1:13:38] bride that was a part of the word
[1:13:40] whenever this word come across your path
[1:13:42] there was a response to it because
[1:13:44] you're a part of it you're a part of
[1:13:47] this word no brother banham he talks
[1:13:49] about the eagle he says whenever Mama
[1:13:51] Eagle come across the Barnyard and she
[1:13:54] began to scream out the baby eagle
[1:13:56] recognized the stream and says that's
[1:13:58] who I am I'm a part of that screen and
[1:14:02] whenever he recognized that scream the
[1:14:05] word started to lift it up out of the
[1:14:07] out of uh the the Barnyard and the
[1:14:11] message would have come across your way
[1:14:12] something responded saying I pump from
[1:14:16] the word I come from the thoughts of God
[1:14:19] and you could not help but respond
[1:14:21] because you're a part of it Hallelujah
[1:14:24] are you a part of it this evening it's
[1:14:27] your origin it's who you are you see a
[1:14:30] builder don't get there by itself but a
[1:14:32] building has to have a base where it
[1:14:34] started where it was constructed upon
[1:14:37] you know I started thinking about a
[1:14:38] McDonald's didn't get worldwide by
[1:14:40] itself I was in England last year and
[1:14:42] there's a McDonald's in England in
[1:14:44] Germany there's a McDonald's you know it
[1:14:46] didn't get worldwide by accident but it
[1:14:49] had an origin it had some place where it
[1:14:52] started and now that establishment
[1:14:54] wherever it goes it may go across the
[1:14:57] seas and wherever it goes it's always
[1:14:59] pointing back to its origin
[1:15:02] come on now it looks like the same ones
[1:15:05] in the states the one in Germany looks
[1:15:07] like the ones in the states the one in
[1:15:09] England looks like the ones in the
[1:15:10] states what is it it might be in a
[1:15:12] different location but it's always
[1:15:14] pointing back to its origin oh my we
[1:15:18] might not be in heaven we might not be
[1:15:20] in the mind of God but we are in a place
[1:15:23] where we're pointing back to our origin
[1:15:25] we're on the foundation of the word and
[1:15:29] we're pointing back what we're laying
[1:15:31] hands on the sick and they're recovery
[1:15:33] we're living an undefiled life what is
[1:15:36] it our Tabernacle our house is pointing
[1:15:39] back to our origin if Pentecost have the
[1:15:42] power to speak in tongues this pride has
[1:15:45] the power to speak in tongues come on
[1:15:47] somebody if the first church laid hands
[1:15:50] on the sick the second bride will lay
[1:15:52] hands on the sick and expect miracles
[1:15:55] why we're pointing back to our origin oh
[1:15:59] mine we're producing another book about
[1:16:02] continuation of the book of Acts it's
[1:16:05] not the work doing it by yourself but
[1:16:07] we're pointing back to its origin
[1:16:10] hallelujah we're just building or a
[1:16:12] house opponent and it's producing the
[1:16:14] results
[1:16:16] oh my it's producing the results that's
[1:16:19] what I want to be I want to be a result
[1:16:21] of Christ but you see if you compromise
[1:16:24] on what you were founded upon you lose
[1:16:27] the characteristics of your origin you
[1:16:30] know brother Branham talks about America
[1:16:31] and he says and we are all American I
[1:16:34] think so in the church tonight we're all
[1:16:36] American citizens we're thankful to be
[1:16:39] American but yet what happened to our
[1:16:41] American Heritage what was it he says we
[1:16:44] begin to compromise and as soon as we
[1:16:47] compromised we lost the sacredness of
[1:16:50] our heritage because we compromised he
[1:16:53] said says we won print we run presidents
[1:16:55] four times that breaks down the
[1:16:57] Constitution we do things today to this
[1:17:00] little parking meter that we have on the
[1:17:02] street that's unconstitutional there are
[1:17:04] such such a thing and there's no such a
[1:17:07] thing in the Constitution it gets
[1:17:09] against the Constitution yet we do it
[1:17:12] and we do all kinds of things that's
[1:17:14] against the principles that this nation
[1:17:17] was founded upon he says we do
[1:17:19] everything contrary we've lost our
[1:17:21] heritage because why we compromised on
[1:17:25] the principles that we was based upon is
[1:17:28] that the definition of Heritage is a
[1:17:31] property that descends to an heir an
[1:17:34] inheritance of Birthright so America has
[1:17:37] lost its inheritance because they've
[1:17:40] compromised upon their origin oh my but
[1:17:43] this pride is not compromising but she
[1:17:46] is standing faithful upon the word and
[1:17:48] her inheritance it's something of Her
[1:17:51] Imagination but her hair inheritance she
[1:17:54] is claiming every time she steps out her
[1:17:57] bed she's claiming her inheritance she's
[1:17:59] living a life she's producing the
[1:18:02] Greater Works she's producing the life
[1:18:04] of Jesus Christ oh my Christ is inside
[1:18:08] of the house betraying his thoughts oh
[1:18:12] my you see we're not letting offenses
[1:18:14] dictate our foundation oh my you may say
[1:18:17] brother Josh I've been offended of this
[1:18:19] brother I've been offended at that
[1:18:21] brother there's a solution the Bible
[1:18:23] says in Psalms 107 and 19 then they
[1:18:27] Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and
[1:18:29] he shaveth them out of their distresses
[1:18:31] he sent his word and healed them and
[1:18:34] delivered them from their destructions
[1:18:36] oh my you don't gotta stay up in that
[1:18:39] root of bitterness you don't get a stamp
[1:18:41] in my complex he has sent his word that
[1:18:45] blind you up with the right foundation
[1:18:47] you may be eating up with bitterness you
[1:18:49] might be eating up with any anxiety but
[1:18:52] God has sent his word to break up the
[1:18:55] old Foundation that sure built upon and
[1:18:58] to direct you to the true foundation
[1:19:00] where you can have joy unspeakable and
[1:19:03] I'm full of Glory you can have a peace
[1:19:06] the passive Hall understanding
[1:19:08] Hallelujah he sent his word within
[1:19:11] itself with an authority he didn't send
[1:19:13] a dead letter but he sent a word that is
[1:19:16] that has happened backing it up that is
[1:19:19] destroying every root you look at
[1:19:21] Matthew 7 and 28 and it come to pass
[1:19:24] when Jesus had ended these sayings the
[1:19:27] people were astonished at his Doctrine
[1:19:29] or at his word for he taught them as one
[1:19:32] having Authority not as the scribes
[1:19:37] did you catch that he they were
[1:19:39] astonished not at his actions but they
[1:19:41] what they were astonished at his word
[1:19:43] they said okay there's something
[1:19:45] something strange here you're saying the
[1:19:48] same things that the scribes are saying
[1:19:50] but they've got no Authority behind him
[1:19:52] but you do
[1:19:54] what made the difference he was the
[1:19:56] interpretation of the Scrolls it was the
[1:20:00] word coming off of the Scrolls and now
[1:20:02] in a body The Same Spirit the Rope the
[1:20:05] Scrolls Was the Same Spirit that was
[1:20:08] making the scroll live oh my that's what
[1:20:11] separated Jesus from the Pharisees was
[1:20:14] there was a life behind the letter and
[1:20:17] what separates you from the rest of the
[1:20:19] world we're not just reading quotes or
[1:20:21] not just reading scriptures but the word
[1:20:23] the spirit the Rope the word is living
[1:20:26] in a vessel making the word live there's
[1:20:30] a separation taking place in the midst
[1:20:33] of the pressure while the Serpent's heat
[1:20:35] is portraying the life of who they're
[1:20:38] portraying the bride is portraying the
[1:20:40] life of Jesus Christ in the midst of
[1:20:43] uncertainty the pride is standing stable
[1:20:47] upon a foundation with the life behind
[1:20:49] it you look at Matthew 8 and 8 the
[1:20:51] Centurion answered and said Lord I am
[1:20:54] now worthy that there should has come
[1:20:56] under my roof but speak the word holy
[1:20:58] and my servant shall be healed for I am
[1:21:01] a man under Authority having soldiers
[1:21:04] hunting me I say to this man go and he
[1:21:07] goeth into another come and he cometh
[1:21:09] into my servant do this and he do with
[1:21:11] him he was making a statement that Jesus
[1:21:14] you have authority but I've got
[1:21:16] Authority as well but it's not a
[1:21:18] supernatural Authority I can speak to my
[1:21:22] servants and they go I can speak to this
[1:21:24] one and they go but you've got a
[1:21:27] supernatural Authority that I don't got
[1:21:29] and this bride has a supernatural
[1:21:32] Authority that the world don't have
[1:21:34] you've got something that the world
[1:21:37] longs to have oh my look at Matthew 8
[1:21:40] and 16 and when even when they even was
[1:21:43] come they're brought unto him many that
[1:21:45] were possessed with devils and cast out
[1:21:47] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:21:51] that were sent oh he healed the he
[1:21:53] cashed out Spirits with this word and
[1:21:56] hear all that were sick but should
[1:21:58] notice what was his ministry based upon
[1:22:01] the next verse that it might be
[1:22:03] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the
[1:22:07] prophet if you look to the scripture
[1:22:09] it's always saying that that it might be
[1:22:11] fulfilled about this Prophet by that
[1:22:14] Prophet his foundation was always
[1:22:16] pointing back to his origin his actions
[1:22:20] was always pointing back to the word oh
[1:22:23] come on now and that was the example of
[1:22:25] the Bride our actions is to always to
[1:22:28] point back to the word or decisions is
[1:22:31] to point back to the word well our
[1:22:33] everyday life is is to point back to the
[1:22:36] word because rebuilt upon the right song
[1:22:39] were built on the same Foundation you
[1:22:42] see brother Branham says this it can't
[1:22:44] come through a rag that drums right down
[1:22:46] and says it was in another day it was in
[1:22:48] another day it's forever the same he's
