[47:15] left verse 37 and they answered and said
[47:17] unto him where Lord and he said unto
[47:20] them wheresoever the body is thither
[47:23] will the Eagles be gathered together and
[47:25] you may be seated may the Lord add his
[47:26] blessing to the word tonight we see an
[47:29] age here and as it was in the days I
[47:31] think we can say that we are truly in
[47:33] those days I think we can say that we've
[47:35] seen those days again it was a time
[47:37] where there was uh sod sodomites and
[47:40] there was all kinds of things and it was
[47:42] the it was it was the going thing it was
[47:44] it was okay to be that way in that time
[47:47] and you'll see it is today it's almost a
[47:48] bad thing to be a good Christian family
[47:51] because people look down on you but but
[47:53] you know if you're if if if you're
[47:54] living like the world and you're doing
[47:56] like the world and you're acting like
[47:57] the world and and maybe you've got women
[47:59] marrying women and men marrying men and
[48:02] then it becomes a common thing that's
[48:04] accepted in society well you'll find
[48:06] that that's that's Bible days again and
[48:08] we'll see that there had to be someone
[48:11] that was called out and set aside for a
[48:13] time that would happen like this now now
[48:15] I know you a lot of people say well lot
[48:17] was our type but lot's not our type
[48:19] because lot was down there hanging out
[48:21] with him and the mayor of the city and
[48:23] and he kind of loved where he was at but
[48:25] if you look there you'll notice Abra was
[48:27] away from all this Abraham had no desire
[48:29] to be around this group Abraham wanted
[48:32] to be set aside so he could hear from
[48:33] the Lord Abraham was a type of what we
[48:36] need to be today and I believe Abraham's
[48:38] seed has a desire to get out of here can
[48:41] you say Amen Abraham's seed has no
[48:44] desire to stay in this world any longer
[48:45] I know we live here and I know we've got
[48:47] to stay here and and work among the
[48:49] world and and you know you want the
[48:51] nicest house and the nicest car and
[48:53] those things are good but in that time
[48:55] when you see that becomes the main f
[48:56] focus and that becomes the main thing
[48:59] and you start to see where where the
[49:00] world is is going it's groping in
[49:03] darkness it's grouping in darkness it is
[49:05] a time where everything is coming uh to
[49:07] aead everything is coming to its total
[49:10] Destruction but there's a group of
[49:11] people here that are set aside and are
[49:14] getting ready to leave this world now
[49:16] where will these people be they'll be
[49:17] sitting there and they'll be feeding on
[49:20] the body word of the son of man now
[49:22] brother Brandon would say it like this
[49:23] he said he said now anyone who has the
[49:25] slightest bit of the real Spirit of of
[49:26] God in them can feel the hot blast of
[49:29] the oncoming judgment in your spirit you
[49:31] can discern and know that there's
[49:33] something fixing to happen how many can
[49:35] say Amen to that there's something going
[49:37] on and he said there's something fixing
[49:38] to happen the whole world is quivering
[49:40] the little Nations and the big Nations
[49:42] for the hands of the Communist and the
[49:44] ungodly and the bloodless and the
[49:45] heartless and the Cults and lays the
[49:48] power to send this world to its ashes in
[49:49] one minute's time it's here we're at the
[49:52] time now where all it would take is just
[49:54] a button or or or just a just an order
[49:56] for from a from a world leader that is
[49:58] completely gone insane and what you
[50:00] would see as you would see this world
[50:02] completely destroyed now now I'm not
[50:04] trying to paint a bleak picture here
[50:05] tonight because I want to show you what
[50:07] the world is coming to but I want you to
[50:09] also recognize that you are not of this
[50:11] world you are just in this world you are
[50:14] not partakers of the plagues that are to
[50:15] come you are not partakers of the Wrath
[50:17] that is coming well come on somebody
[50:19] you're not here for the tribulation
[50:21] there's somebody that is here for a
[50:23] Rapture but I want to show you the time
[50:25] when all this is going to take place now
[50:27] he said there he said just the mercies
[50:29] of God being longsuffering is all that's
[50:31] holding it we can become Russia
[50:33] satellite before in the morning and yet
[50:35] we don't notice it we just go right on
[50:36] and they don't know they don't know what
[50:38] about what all this nervous condition's
[50:39] about and when the world is becoming
[50:41] neurotic even the psychiatrists
[50:43] themselves are having nervous breakdowns
[50:45] the natural will never be able to
[50:46] interpret the supernatural he said
[50:48] neither could The Magicians and the
[50:50] astrologers ever read the handwriting on
[50:52] the wall it took the Spirit-filled man
[50:54] of God to do so and those as olers could
[50:57] not read the unknown tongue see the
[50:58] worldly churches don't see where we are
[51:01] the the government don't know where we
[51:02] are but if you've been in this message
[51:04] and you've read your Bible and the
[51:06] spirit of God has come into you then you
[51:08] know your day you know your hour and you
[51:10] know that the message must come in this
[51:13] time and the revealing of the son of man
[51:15] had to come he said they've Dilly DED
[51:17] along in big things of rock and roll
[51:19] parties and B uh shindigs in their
[51:21] churches and cold formal sermons well
[51:23] come on somebody it's not time for a
[51:25] cold formal no more it's not time to
[51:28] just have just have another another
[51:30] gathering so that we can see how many
[51:32] people's going to show up no it's time
[51:34] that we start feeding on the word of God
[51:36] again and let the word of God get us
[51:38] ready for a Rapture let the word of God
[51:40] change these bodies because that's what
[51:43] it's going to take can you say amen and
[51:46] the gospel has been neglected and they
[51:48] know nothing about the Supernatural Well
[51:50] that's where the world's at that's the
[51:52] condition they're in and that's that's
[51:54] exactly how it's supposed to be now
[51:56] that's not Doom and Gloom for the bride
[51:58] because we can see the world getting in
[52:00] condition for us to go take a Rapture
[52:02] well I know they're going down I I tell
[52:04] you what and and you say well I'm
[52:06] worried about my loved ones I'm worried
[52:07] about my family well I say we ought to
[52:09] pray for them and and we need to try to
[52:11] get them to church if we can and we need
[52:12] to try to call out their names before
[52:14] the Lord but if you'll just have faith
[52:16] of Abraham then you won't lose a one of
[52:18] them to the oncoming storm you won't
[52:20] lose one of them to this destruction
[52:21] that's coming because you and your house
[52:24] shall be saved you're not going to lose
[52:26] them I I tell you what you say what if
[52:27] they're here in the tribulation just
[52:29] pray for their soul that when your
[52:31] body's changed you can see them on the
[52:32] other side I I tell you however they
[52:34] make it is okay with me I I yes I want
[52:37] them to go through the through the
[52:38] Rapture just like I want to go in the
[52:39] Rapture and I want to see every one of
[52:41] you go in the Rapture but let's just
[52:43] pray that they make it however they make
[52:44] it we want to pray for the souls listen
[52:46] there's going to be many saved there's
[52:47] going to be many lots that are going to
[52:49] be saved but they're not going to be
[52:50] like Abraham that are set aside and and
[52:53] waiting for the Rapture to come waiting
[52:55] for the body change believing in the
[52:57] promise of God now some of you young
[52:59] people you're you're going to you're
[53:00] going to hear this as you get older if
[53:02] the Rapture don't come in the next 5
[53:04] years the next 10 years the next 15
[53:06] years what you're going to hear is well
[53:08] we've heard this all our life and it's
[53:10] just not going to happen well you know
[53:11] what you're an Abraham seed and Abraham
[53:14] heard for 25 years you're going to have
[53:16] a baby it's going to happen the promise
[53:18] is coming but it did come and it will
[53:21] come well come on somebody it will come
[53:24] in someone's generation if it's not your
[53:27] generation brother Bill then it may be
[53:28] my generation if it's not in my
[53:30] generation it may be in one of my
[53:31] children's generation but it's going to
[53:33] happen just as sure as I'm standing here
[53:36] it will happen so I say let's let's drop
[53:39] the negativity I know the scientists are
[53:41] saying well it's not going to happen
[53:42] we've been here for millions of years
[53:44] and and you know there's nothing to all
[53:45] this fanaticism there's nothing to the
[53:47] message of the hour but I want to point
[53:49] you back to a time as in the days of
[53:51] Noah when there was a bunch of people
[53:53] who heard the same sermon over and over
[53:55] over and over over and they said it's
[53:57] not going to happen it's not going to
[53:59] happen but somebody was preparing to get
[54:02] on a boat I say somebody has got to be
[54:04] preparing to get out of this place I'm
[54:07] not going through a tribulation I'm not
[54:09] going to be here when the bombs are
[54:10] falling I'm not going to be here and
[54:12] leave my children in this condition I
[54:13] said I'm taking them with me in a
[54:15] Rapture can you say amen I tell you what
[54:18] I think we need some people to get on
[54:20] fire for God in this message and start
[54:22] setting ourselves aside whether it's
[54:24] Sunday morning Sunday night Wednesday
[54:25] night and start are taking ourselves out
[54:27] of this world and set aside with God and
[54:29] hear the voice of God and let God speak
[54:32] to your heart again I think we become so
[54:34] accustomed to the things of the world
[54:35] that if we can just come to church and
[54:37] we we we you know we dot our eyes and
[54:39] cross our tees and well I did my due
[54:41] diligence for the week no no there's an
[54:43] Abraham group that is just they're
[54:45] longing to get out of here they can't
[54:47] wait to get out of this place and
[54:48] they're doing everything they can to get
[54:50] ready for it I say that's you tonight
[54:53] you that are set aside you little fock
[54:56] that are gathered together and feasting
[54:58] on the body word of the son of man you
[54:59] are the ones tonight you are the ones
[55:02] that are going in a Rapture it's not
[55:03] going to be the ones going out here and
[55:05] they have to have a program for this age
[55:07] group and a program for that age group
[55:09] and well can you say man you got to have
[55:11] something for the seniors you got to
[55:12] have a Bunko game and and a bingo game
[55:14] and you got to have a party for this and
[55:16] a party for that no what we want is the
[55:18] word of God and the services again I'm
[55:20] not against I'm not against having good
[55:22] things in the church and programs in the
[55:23] church I'm not against that but the main
[55:25] attraction ction to the believer is
[55:27] where the word is the Eagles will come
[55:31] and feast on that word where the body
[55:33] son where the body word of the son of
[55:35] man is that's where we are feasting
[55:37] today and brother Brandon would say it
[55:39] like this he said it seems to me that
[55:41] men who are made in the image of God
[55:43] feeling this great pressure coming on
[55:45] should go to safety can you say Amen but
[55:48] they don't do it they won't listen
[55:49] though the warning voice of God speaks
[55:51] day after day night after night but men
[55:53] desires to live in sin you know it's
[55:55] late than we think can you say amen he
[55:58] said you know it's later now this is in
[56:00] 1958 by the way it's later than we think
[56:03] you you look at the you look at the
[56:04] trajectory of the world from the time
[56:06] that brother Brandon was here on Earth
[56:08] to where it is now and you can see a
[56:10] world that is going into total chaos and
[56:13] coming destruction but you know what it
[56:15] is we're looking at it and we're
[56:16] thinking well it's been this long it
[56:18] just couldn't happen but think about it
[56:20] Sarah might have thought that but the
[56:22] baby came anyway think about it
[56:24] somebody's going to be sitting there and
[56:26] going to think well it's not going to
[56:27] happen and they're going to be looking
[56:28] for you and you're going to be gone and
[56:30] then they're going to be saying well why
[56:32] why didn't we wait for the Rapture to
[56:33] come see God doesn't do it in your time
[56:36] or in the way the world would think it
[56:37] should come but God is going to come
[56:41] exactly on time with his program and
[56:44] take home who is ready to meet him at
[56:46] that day I tell you I just want to be
[56:48] ready if he comes next year if he comes
[56:50] in the next 5 minutes if he comes in 10
[56:52] years 20 years if I'm a 100-year old man
[56:55] I want to stand here and say is coming
[56:57] he's coming back for me he's coming back
[56:59] for you if I see Elders go by the way of
[57:01] the Grave then they're going to rise
[57:03] first because I believe in a Rapture and
[57:06] I know it's coming now listen I know
[57:08] there's people today that are attacking
[57:09] the Rapture they're saying the Rapture
[57:11] is nothing it's not going to happen and
[57:13] they're saying well there's no Bible for
[57:14] it I'm going to tell you right now there
[57:15] is Bible for it the dead in Christ shall
[57:18] rise first it will not hinder those well
[57:20] come on somebody it will not hinder you
[57:22] that are awake it will not hinder me
[57:24] brother Bill if if the if the Lord
[57:26] carries another 50 years then your body
[57:28] is going to come up before mine but I'll
[57:30] tell you what I just want to be ready
[57:32] and be among those few that when my
[57:34] loved ones start to appear I want to be
[57:36] able to see them how about you I don't
[57:39] want to stay here when the bombs are
[57:40] coming listen nobody should be getting
[57:42] ready for tribulation if you know this
[57:45] message and if you see where you are
[57:47] then you need to be getting ready for
[57:49] the oncoming storm but don't be ready to
[57:51] stay here be ready to look up because
[57:54] your Redemption draweth not your
[57:56] redemption's coming in the morning I
[57:58] tell you what you've heard it said
[57:59] between 6:00 and 9 I don't care when he
[58:01] comes whenever he comes I want to be
[58:03] ready whatever that Prophet said I'm
[58:05] going to hold to it why because in every
[58:07] generation there was a prophet with the
[58:09] word of the Lord you say you can call me
[58:11] crazy for saying I believe what a
[58:13] prophet said I believe what a prophet
[58:15] said I believe every word of it why
[58:18] because if as in the days of Noah the
[58:20] unbelievers didn't make it on the boat
[58:22] come on somebody the ones that doubted
[58:24] the promise of Abraham they never never
[58:26] saw the promise fulfilled but it was the
[58:28] ones who would stay there and the
[58:30] promise would come to pass it was Enoch
[58:32] who who would come and and he would walk
[58:34] with God all of his days he would be
[58:36] translated that's our type right there
[58:39] if you walk with God and stay in the
[58:41] message of the hour then you will never
[58:43] face death and if you would go by way of
[58:45] the Grave you still didn't face
[58:49] death so I say tonight it's time that we
[58:52] quit looking at the destruction that's
[58:53] coming but we start looking up because
[58:56] when we see the destruction coming we
[58:57] know that our time's coming too our
[59:00] time's coming too we don't have to worry
[59:02] about what's going on around is if we
[59:04] know who we
[59:06] are brother R said it like this he said
[59:08] it's later than we think he said the
[59:10] scriptures declares it's later than we
[59:12] think Jesus said as it was in the days
[59:14] of Noah and the days of lot so shall it
[59:16] be in the coming of the son of man let
[59:18] us see what's taking place in the days
[59:20] of the coming of the destruction and the
[59:21] Judgment the days of Noah and the days
[59:23] of lot they were both affiliated with
[59:25] the Third destruction Jesus said just as
[59:27] it were in those days so will it be when
[59:29] the son of man comes the second time
[59:31] it'll be just like it was
[59:34] then now we can see where we're at we
[59:37] anybody that's got any Supernatural
[59:39] understanding or any Spirit about them
[59:41] can see where we are brother M would go
[59:43] on to say he said we're taught that in
[59:45] the days of Noah not only at that time
[59:47] but in the days of lot is Junction times
[59:49] and every time before judgment comes to
[59:51] the Earth and this is where I want to
[59:53] get to tonight God always sends a mercy
[59:57] call he could have never sent judgment
[1:00:00] had he not sent Malachi 4 that showed us
[1:00:02] a way to get out of here he could have
[1:00:04] never sent judgment to this earth until
[1:00:07] he first come and warned America said
[1:00:09] this is your last chance this is this is
[1:00:12] your last warning he had to come and
[1:00:14] preach the invasion of the United States
[1:00:15] he had to come with a message that would
[1:00:17] get a bride ready well come on somebody
[1:00:19] he had to come or we could never have a
[1:00:22] Rapture because that part of the
[1:00:24] scripture had to be fulfilled first and
[1:00:26] when he came now we can look forward and
[1:00:29] say that scripture's been fulfilled and
[1:00:31] now the rest is going to be fulfilled
[1:00:33] and we know well come on somebody we are
[1:00:36] blessed to know what we know and to see
[1:00:38] what we've seen and we're not looking
[1:00:40] down at this world we're not Earthbound
[1:00:42] we're not a chicken we're not down here
[1:00:44] looking around at what else we can peck
[1:00:46] on and who we can hurt and and and what
[1:00:48] what we can make down here we can get a
[1:00:50] better Coupe Hallelujah but I tell you
[1:00:52] what we can do we can look up and you'll
[1:00:54] hear the voice of Mama Eagle someday and
[1:00:56] it's time to get out of here it's time
[1:00:59] to go home brother Bill it could come
[1:01:01] tomorrow you could still see this
[1:01:04] Rapture you could still see
[1:01:06] it you could still see it I don't care
[1:01:08] if you're 100 years old sitting here
[1:01:10] tonight you could still see it because I
[1:01:12] believe we are that close to the coming
[1:01:15] of the Lord now I I know people say what
[1:01:17] you've been saying I heard a brother I I
[1:01:19] say he's a brother he used to be in the
[1:01:21] message years ago and I was talking to
[1:01:22] him down in Hot Springs and he he said
[1:01:24] I've been I've been hearing about the
[1:01:25] rapture since I was a little boy and
[1:01:27] here I'm in my 50s and and I said well I
[1:01:30] said here's the problem with quitting
[1:01:31] believing that is someday it's actually
[1:01:33] going to happen and then if you've quit
[1:01:35] looking for it you're not going to be
[1:01:37] ready when he comes and he said well he
[1:01:39] said that may be he said but you know
[1:01:41] even if you go through the tribulation I
[1:01:42] said buddy you don't want to be here in
[1:01:43] the tribulation if you really know
[1:01:45] what's going on in the tribulation quit
[1:01:47] looking for the tribulation to get you
[1:01:49] out of here and start looking up I say
[1:01:52] it's time we start looking up what about
[1:01:54] you Word of Life we need to qu looking
[1:01:56] at what's around us and I tell you it's
[1:01:58] nice to have a good car and a good job
[1:02:00] and all those things but that's all
[1:02:01] temporary and when the Rapture comes
[1:02:04] those things are all going to be left
[1:02:05] behind anyway but I'm telling you what's
[1:02:07] going to get out of here and what is
[1:02:08] your Eternal thoughts tonight it is can
[1:02:10] I take my family with me can I be ready
[1:02:13] myself can I go on a Rapture can I be
[1:02:15] like he not can never taste death that's
[1:02:18] what the bride wants to do that's where
[1:02:20] we're looking for we are not looking
[1:02:22] around and see how the biggest church or
[1:02:25] if we can do this better or that better
[1:02:27] no we're not looking for more programs
[1:02:29] we are looking for a
[1:02:32] Rapture that's what the bride's looking
[1:02:34] for sir brother R said it like this he
[1:02:36] said Enoch he sent an angel he sent a
[1:02:38] message God sent a prophet to the Earth
[1:02:40] named Enoch and he said what what did
[1:02:42] man do they ate and they drank and they
[1:02:43] planted they build they they rejected
[1:02:45] the call of the message and I would like
[1:02:46] to go on and say this it's not wrong to
[1:02:48] build it's not wrong to plant your
[1:02:50] potatoes or it's not wrong to do that
[1:02:53] but don't let that hold you here and
[1:02:54] don't be like well I hope the the Lord
[1:02:56] holds a Rapture I'm no all we're looking
[1:02:58] for as Believers is a Rapture if he
[1:03:01] comes before I get my new car praise the
[1:03:03] Lord for it if he comes before I get my
[1:03:05] house built praise the Lord for it I say
[1:03:08] if he comes before anything else happens
[1:03:10] praise the Lord for it I'm not looking
[1:03:12] to build a kingdom here but I'm looking
[1:03:15] for a kingdom to come I'm looking for
[1:03:17] someone to come for me why because I'm
[1:03:19] ready I I I want to lay in this message
[1:03:22] and lay in the presence of the son
[1:03:24] that's what's going to get you out of
[1:03:25] here
[1:03:26] can you say
[1:03:27] amen he said they were turning it down
[1:03:29] what did we find them doing laughing
[1:03:30] scoffing making fun marrying wives
[1:03:33] living in adultery building planning
[1:03:34] that's what you'll find that's the
[1:03:35] church world but that's not you that's
[1:03:38] the church world uh there's never been a
[1:03:39] time where the message was under attack
[1:03:41] like it is now if you go back and look
[1:03:43] to the men who actually were with
[1:03:44] brother brandham and men who didn't even
[1:03:46] disagree with him they spoke very highly
[1:03:48] of brother brandham and they would
[1:03:49] actually testify of the great things
[1:03:51] that God was doing in his ministry but
[1:03:53] now you get somebody that's got a
[1:03:54] YouTube channel and they decide they can
[1:03:56] go after the Vindicated prophet of the
[1:03:58] hour and tell you you know what we we
[1:04:00] don't believe him because he he we don't
[1:04:01] have any proof of this well you don't
[1:04:02] have any proof of Noah you don't have
[1:04:04] any proof of Jesus you don't have any
[1:04:06] proof that the Bible exists but you
[1:04:08] believe it because Believers have faith
[1:04:10] to believe the word that has already
[1:04:12] happened listen I'm not looking for
[1:04:14] proof I'm looking for Rapture I'm not
[1:04:16] looking for somebody to theologically
[1:04:18] explain how the message is right or how
[1:04:21] the message is wrong but what I'm
[1:04:22] looking for is a Vindication of the
[1:04:25] scriptures that said the dead in Christ
[1:04:27] shall rise first I want to see my loved
[1:04:29] ones coming I'm not looking for some
[1:04:32] YouTube channel to tell me who's right
[1:04:34] and who's
[1:04:35] wrong what you've got is you've got a
[1:04:37] bunch of unbelievers sitting around with
[1:04:38] keyboard Warriors and and I'll tell you
[1:04:41] what when the destruction comes I
[1:04:42] guarantee you they're going to be
[1:04:43] wishing they were right there with you
[1:04:45] but you know what they're doing they
[1:04:46] they're so brave because they can't see
[1:04:48] the message listen I don't wish any ill
[1:04:50] on them but I know who we are I know
[1:04:53] where we're going I know this message is
[1:04:55] right and I will not be talked out of it
[1:04:58] come on somebody if you were talked into
[1:05:00] this message you can be talked out of it
[1:05:02] but this is a revelation to me I can't
[1:05:05] see nothing else no more why because I I
[1:05:07] quit looking I quit looking I don't even
[1:05:09] look for the sights anymore I don't even
[1:05:11] want to go look and and say where was
[1:05:13] brother Brandon's mistakes I could care
[1:05:15] less if he was a man and made mistakes
[1:05:17] what I'm looking at is word excuse me
[1:05:20] the word that was promised to come and
[1:05:23] it has come and it is is getting a bride
[1:05:28] ready so I'm not looking for another
[1:05:31] Prophet I'm not looking for another I'm
[1:05:34] not looking for another time another
[1:05:37] church age messenger I'm not looking for
[1:05:39] another Revival but the Revival that
[1:05:41] we're in now is a word revival can you
[1:05:44] say
[1:05:45] Amen it is a word Revival now brother B
[1:05:48] said it like this he said now he said
[1:05:50] each message both lot and Noah their
[1:05:52] message consisted of this grace mercy
[1:05:55] and Deliverance Grace God's mercy to the
[1:05:58] people was uh was presented through
[1:06:00] Grace and deliverance was presented to
[1:06:02] the people but they turned it down what
[1:06:04] do we find them doing laughing and
[1:06:06] scoffing that's what we find them doing
[1:06:08] now what was it it was the unbelievers
[1:06:10] calling the message of the hour
[1:06:13] false you know history repeats itself if
[1:06:17] you were a scoffer now if you are a
[1:06:19] scoffer now you would have been a
[1:06:21] scoffer in Noah's day you would you
[1:06:23] would have been you would have been
[1:06:23] laughing at Abraham when he was old when
[1:06:26] an old man about ready to have a baby
[1:06:27] you would have laughed at him well let's
[1:06:29] just go ahead and call it like it is you
[1:06:31] say well I'd have believ that no you
[1:06:33] wouldn't have been a Believer then
[1:06:34] either because you you're an elect to
[1:06:36] believe and you can't help but believing
[1:06:38] this day you see where we're at church
[1:06:40] it's later than you think it is this is
[1:06:43] the people that are overcoming not by
[1:06:45] being proved that the message is right
[1:06:47] but by a revelation that they can see
[1:06:49] the evening light is here and the
[1:06:51] Rapture is at hand can you say Amen
[1:06:55] said most of the time we try to bring
[1:06:57] this message our words seem like the to
[1:06:59] the world as just like lots did to his
[1:07:01] kin folks it seems to me that were
[1:07:04] mocking to them or they were Idle Words
[1:07:07] Their pastors either bypassed this great
[1:07:09] message of Deliverance or tried to
[1:07:10] explain it out into another generation
[1:07:12] to come listen close but the facts of it
[1:07:15] is the Angel of the Lord is present to
[1:07:18] confirm the word and manifest the power
[1:07:22] of the Holy Ghost and these signs shall
[1:07:24] follow so somebody say these signs shall
[1:07:26] follow these signs shall follow them
[1:07:29] that believe they tried to Mock and they
[1:07:30] said to lot why they just made fun of
[1:07:32] lot his own Kindred and lot was just a
[1:07:34] man the Bible said that their sins vexed
[1:07:36] his righteous Soul daily to see the
[1:07:38] perversion and this nation is loaded
[1:07:40] with it the the misusing of the human
[1:07:42] body and when it's on the Rampage
[1:07:44] alcoholics dope uh dop addicts and
[1:07:46] teenage juvenile delinquency just like
[1:07:48] it was then and Men mock at it and when
[1:07:50] they see the supernatural signs of the
[1:07:52] Lord they they try to say that we're
[1:07:54] mocking religion
[1:07:56] these crazy people are trying to tell us
[1:07:58] we're the ones
[1:07:59] crazy yeah someone said us long ago
[1:08:03] wrote me a letter to brother Bram
[1:08:05] speaking he said some great doctor of
[1:08:06] divinity said Mr brandham get next to
[1:08:09] yourself you're trying to impersonate
[1:08:11] the Lord Jesus said you're only making a
[1:08:13] mock he said how little this poor
[1:08:16] decrepit man knew that it's not a man
[1:08:18] that can do that it's the sign of the
[1:08:20] end time oh can you say amen he he said
[1:08:22] it's a sign of the end time he's and
[1:08:24] he's fulfilling it but they mocked at
[1:08:26] lot they said oh don't listen to him
[1:08:27] that man's crazy how could this great
[1:08:29] place be destroyed how could Sodom and
[1:08:31] Gomorrah the greatest City you known to
[1:08:32] Earth how could it be destroyed with
[1:08:34] fire and brimstone they say today how
[1:08:36] could this world be burned over how
[1:08:37] could the world be destroyed oh look at
[1:08:39] our military look at look at what we've
[1:08:40] got we we're bigger we're greater we're
[1:08:42] more powerful no you're not there
[1:08:44] there's somebody raising up right now
[1:08:46] that has the ability to take this world
[1:08:48] out and if you see the government is so
[1:08:51] corrupt now it could be your own
[1:08:52] government do it well come on somebody
[1:08:55] money is the money is the root of all
[1:08:57] evil the love of money is the root of
[1:08:59] all evil and what you're seeing now is
[1:09:01] you can pay off any politician that's
[1:09:02] running I tell you I know I know I know
[1:09:05] I'm in Trump country so I won't say
[1:09:07] nothing bad about him but listen anybody
[1:09:09] that's in brother bam said you could put
[1:09:10] an Abraham Lincoln in there you could
[1:09:12] put a George Washington in there and
[1:09:13] that's not going to restore this country
[1:09:15] I'm not saying it wouldn't make it
[1:09:16] better financially for a while and
[1:09:18] that's why you vote and you go down to
[1:09:19] the pools and do what you do but here's
[1:09:21] what I'm going to say to you tonight

[1:09:33] you one of these days is going to be the
[1:09:34] final president and I don't care what
[1:09:36] party they are they're going to be right
[1:09:38] there when the world goes into total
[1:09:40] chaos and destruction well come on
[1:09:42] somebody that is not what we're looking
[1:09:44] to for our Salvation we are looking to
[1:09:48] the word and the message of the hour
[1:09:50] because that is where the hope of the
[1:09:53] believer rest
[1:09:55] that's what we look for I I I listen I'm
[1:09:58] you know I'm not trying to get into
[1:09:59] politics you you know I understand
[1:10:01] there's there's there's worse principles
[1:10:02] in one than the other and I get all that
[1:10:04] but listen let's not look let's not look
[1:10:05] to that for our Salvation let's not you
[1:10:08] know we we we can argue about that all
[1:10:09] we want to but let's get our families
[1:10:11] let's show them let's not try to convert
[1:10:13] them from Democrat to Republican let's
[1:10:14] try to convert them from what they are
[1:10:16] to the message of the hour because
[1:10:18] that's the only way they're getting out
[1:10:20] of here
[1:10:22] alive everything else is just temporary
[1:10:25] everything your new car your best job
[1:10:28] your your your good clothes everything's
[1:10:30] temporary everything we have here this
[1:10:32] is temporary this is not going to last
[1:10:34] through the tribulation but you are
[1:10:37] because you're not going to be there
[1:10:39] well come on somebody you're not going
[1:10:41] to be there this is your promise this
[1:10:44] message has come to call you out of
[1:10:47] where you are and take you to a place
[1:10:50] where it's already been promised of that
[1:10:52] I tell you what there's a city already
[1:10:53] built there's a house already made that
[1:10:55] wasn't made with hands but I'll tell you
[1:10:57] what there's there's a house there and
[1:10:59] there's a city and there I tell you what
[1:11:01] there's Jasper walls and I tell you what
[1:11:02] this place where we're going cannot be
[1:11:04] described in the English language but it
[1:11:07] is a place that is Everlasting Joy
[1:11:09] Everlasting peace there's no more sorrow
[1:11:12] there's no more death and I tell you the
[1:11:14] way to get there for the bride of Christ
[1:11:16] is without ever tasting death you may
[1:11:18] never have to taste death you could go
[1:11:21] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:11:22] and caught up forever and be changed to
[1:11:25] our Lord I tell you that's the hope of
[1:11:27] the believer that's the hope of the
[1:11:28] message of the hour that's what I
[1:11:30] believe that's what Believers
[1:11:33] believe Believers are not looking to
[1:11:35] stay here brother R said God be merciful
[1:11:39] to this poor miserable blind wretched
[1:11:40] and naked Nation that's what they are it
[1:11:44] it's just it's a place that has already
[1:11:45] been you know it's been condemned if
[1:11:47] you're looking for Revival among the the
[1:11:49] modern churches I would say it's over
[1:11:51] for them now I I it's not over for us
[1:11:54] this Revival that we are in for the
[1:11:56] bride will never
[1:11:58] end there's a Revival there's a cycle of
[1:12:01] death there's a cycle of life and a
[1:12:03] cycle of death and a it's over and over
[1:12:05] brother Gabe it's it's a it's it's life
[1:12:07] and death over and over but this bride
[1:12:09] Revival was a word Revival and the word
[1:12:12] can never die see we are not we are not
[1:12:15] just here listen I I I believe in
[1:12:17] shouting I believe in dancing I believe
[1:12:19] in speaking in tongues but that is not
[1:12:21] what the bride is looking for th those
[1:12:23] things will follow the Believers those
[1:12:25] things can happen but the bride is
[1:12:27] looking to the word to change their
[1:12:31] bodies I believe when the bride sees
[1:12:33] that word I believe they may jump and
[1:12:35] they may shout and I tell you what it's
[1:12:37] hard to hold your peace when you can see
[1:12:40] that the word of God is about to change
[1:12:42] your body just like it did Abraham and
[1:12:43] Sarah but listen what it is we're not
[1:12:46] looking for the signs to vindicate us
[1:12:48] but we're looking for the word and the
[1:12:50] signs will follow the word not the not
[1:12:52] the word following the signs because
[1:12:54] well not many in that day will they not
[1:12:56] say well I have not I done this and have
[1:12:58] not I done that and have not I cast out
[1:13:00] demons listen there's going to be many
[1:13:02] do that but under this message the
[1:13:05] message is what's Vindicated and the
[1:13:07] signs will follow the messenger always
[1:13:10] in the message brother R said I want you
[1:13:12] to notice something just for a moment
[1:13:14] that comes to my mind Before Destruction
[1:13:16] of Sodom and Gomorrah we find that God
[1:13:18] had a prophet up on top of the mountain
[1:13:20] by the name of Abraham and he had given
[1:13:22] him a promise and he was willing to take
[1:13:24] the hard way way and preach the real
[1:13:26] true word than to live in sin that's
[1:13:28] what we need now we need to be willing I
[1:13:30] I'm not saying that we cut people off
[1:13:32] and hurt people no but see Abraham
[1:13:35] Abraham didn't ever he wasn't the one
[1:13:36] that pulled himself away but lot did
[1:13:39] Abraham had to separate himself from
[1:13:41] unbelief but he said you can take this
[1:13:43] or you can take that you you you it's
[1:13:45] whatever you want because I'm going to
[1:13:47] stay here I'm going to go over here
[1:13:48] where the Lord is already provided I I
[1:13:50] you know you're not going to get out of
[1:13:51] this world you're going to have to rub
[1:13:52] shoulders with the world tomorrow you're
[1:13:54] going to be in school with worldly kids
[1:13:56] that have no idea what we believe and
[1:13:58] what we're talking about but can I go
[1:13:59] ahead and just say this for a minute it
[1:14:01] I'm I'm not I'm not really concerned
[1:14:03] about that I'm concerned about you and
[1:14:06] what is your response to the
[1:14:09] world what is your response when the
[1:14:12] world laughs at you what are you going
[1:14:13] to
[1:14:14] do think about it if you were in Noah's
[1:14:18] day and they laughed at you would you
[1:14:19] have said well okay we're we're just
[1:14:21] going to stay over here and you know we
[1:14:24] don't we don't we don't want to get on
[1:14:25] that boat there's a lot of animals on
[1:14:27] there and it smells
[1:14:29] funny we don't have to go to church in
[1:14:33] this day to be a believer and it's true
[1:14:37] you don't have to go to church to be a
[1:14:38] believer but a Believer will go to
[1:14:41] church and a Believer will not a
[1:14:45] Believer will not laugh and make fun of
[1:14:48] the message of the hour I would say it
[1:14:50] like this a Believer is not going to
[1:14:51] persecute the message of the hour when
[1:14:54] you hear a preacher that all they can
[1:14:55] preach is brother Brandon's mistakes I
[1:14:56] say watch out for the man I just I'm
[1:14:59] just saying it like it is tonight I'm
[1:15:00] not worried about the mistakes of
[1:15:02] Abraham when the commentary of his life
[1:15:04] was written the mistakes were never
[1:15:07] mentioned I'm not pointing to a man's
[1:15:09] mistakes I'm pointing to the message
[1:15:11] that he brought I'm pointing to the
[1:15:12] message that he brought I'm not saying
[1:15:14] he wasn't human he was human he was
[1:15:16] human I think we can agree on that but
[1:15:18] I'm not pointing you to the humanity of
[1:15:20] William brandom I'm pointing you to what
[1:15:23] God sent in this day and that was a
[1:15:25] Vindication that the son of man would
[1:15:28] come again in the days that we see that
[1:15:30] are happening I say we are that ought to
[1:15:32] excite the bride that ought to make us
[1:15:34] think thank the Lord for sending a
[1:15:36] prophet thank God for sending Elijah in
[1:15:38] this time because we can see scripture
[1:15:41] being fulfilled in a humble Kentucky man
[1:15:43] I'm not looking for his mistakes come on
[1:15:45] somebody I'm not looking to point out
[1:15:47] where he was right and where he was
[1:15:48] wrong but I can point you to the message
[1:15:51] it wasn't a message of a man it was the
[1:15:53] message that God sent for us in this
[1:15:56] time I think we need to quit looking at
[1:15:58] our ourselves and saying well you know I
[1:16:01] I I I think we need to quit looking at
[1:16:02] the man part so much and and trying to
[1:16:04] point out mistakes Even in our brothers
[1:16:06] Even in our preachers in the message I
[1:16:07] think we need to quit doing that why
[1:16:09] because what we're doing is we're just
[1:16:10] setting the our kids up for failure
[1:16:12] we're setting our kids up for a time
[1:16:14] where where our kids are going to be
[1:16:15] like well I mean if there's a full of
[1:16:17] mistakes and and if we can't even trust
[1:16:19] the man for this and I tell you what
[1:16:20] we've done we preached our young people
[1:16:22] right out of the church I say it's time
[1:16:24] we quit pointing to the mistakes in the
[1:16:26] message and start pointing to the word
[1:16:29] that has come it is a Vindicated word by
[1:16:32] a Vindicated Prophet that has come to
[1:16:34] get a people that have been called for
[1:16:37] such a time as
[1:16:39] this can you say Amen brother R said the
[1:16:42] scripture speaking Sarah I'm almost done
[1:16:44] I
[1:16:46] promise no nobody nobody believes me I'm
[1:16:50] sorry Abraham I I'll prove you I prove
[1:16:53] you wrong tonight Sarah was be 89 so
[1:16:56] many years ago it ceased to be with her
[1:16:57] as it was with women but yet Abraham
[1:16:58] held on for he knew that God was able to
[1:17:01] keep his promise can you say amen he was
[1:17:03] faithful he stayed by the word the word
[1:17:06] the word that God had spoken to him
[1:17:08] that's how Angels appear to people is
[1:17:10] when you stay by the word not by
[1:17:12] man-made theology but by the word thus
[1:17:15] sayith the Lord that's when the Angels
[1:17:17] appear well can you say Amen Abraham
[1:17:19] stayed by the word and while he was
[1:17:21] sitting under the oak one day he saw
[1:17:23] three men coming up and he was spiritual
[1:17:25] for he knowed that God was still God and
[1:17:28] as these men begin to appear Abraham run
[1:17:31] out to meet them and says sir stop in
[1:17:34] just a moment and let me fetch you just
[1:17:35] a little water to wash your feet and
[1:17:37] I'll make you a cake and and you can
[1:17:39] refresh yourself and then you can be
[1:17:40] going for this cause you have come out
[1:17:42] now brother brandom goes on to say this
[1:17:45] watch the nature of this Angel bringing
[1:17:47] the last message Before Destruction he
[1:17:48] said Abraham I'm going to keep my
[1:17:51] promise to
[1:17:52] you I love that that's Our Father God he
[1:17:57] had no beginning of days no ending of
[1:17:59] days well come on somebody he was more
[1:18:01] than able to keep the promise because he
[1:18:04] wasn't born like you're born he he
[1:18:06] didn't die like you die but this was a
[1:18:08] man who never knew no beginning and
[1:18:11] never had an end and he's the same God
[1:18:14] that was vindicating himself night after
[1:18:16] night meeting after meeting in a prophet
[1:18:19] it was the it was not the man it was God
[1:18:22] revealing himself through the man and I
[1:18:24] would say today that's the same just
[1:18:26] like brother brandom said that's our
[1:18:28] Father God I'm not pointing you to
[1:18:30] brother brandom I'm not pointing you to
[1:18:32] another messenger I'm not pointing you
[1:18:34] to another pastor but I'm pointing you
[1:18:36] to a message and the messenger that
[1:18:39] brought it would would yield himself to
[1:18:42] the message of the hour and would bring
[1:18:44] you a message to get you out of this
[1:18:46] world that ought to make somebody happy
[1:18:49] because we're not going to stay here in
[1:18:51] the tribulation I hope somebody's
[1:18:53] hearing me tonight the message had to
[1:18:55] come so that you could have a way
[1:18:59] out I know it's Wednesday night and
[1:19:01] you're tired and I'm screaming at you
[1:19:03] but we'll be all right listen because
[1:19:06] the word is here it's not something I
[1:19:09] could bring brother Ben never brought
[1:19:10] the word you can name any of your
[1:19:12] favorite preachers they never brought
[1:19:13] the word but but God sent the word for
[1:19:16] the hour and God will use the men that
[1:19:18] he chooses to use God will use the
[1:19:21] whatever method he uses to get this word
[1:19:24] out God is still God that's our father
[1:19:27] that's the one who can speak and he can
[1:19:30] every promise every promise he's ever
[1:19:33] promised will come to pass can you say
[1:19:36] amen he said it was a dark time for
[1:19:38] Abraham his faith was being
[1:19:40] tested his faith was being tested he
[1:19:43] held on to his testimony all those years
[1:19:45] but then the angel showed up and said
[1:19:46] I'm going to keep my promise well that
[1:19:49] was a good day for Abraham he was
[1:19:51] starting to see some Vindication of a
[1:19:52] promise now he said now we find that in
[1:19:54] those hours of real stress that's
[1:19:56] usually when the spirit of God moves in
[1:19:58] he let the Hebrew children walk right
[1:19:59] into the fiery furnace but he but he
[1:20:01] never moved a hand but when he moved he
[1:20:04] moves I like that when he moved he moves
[1:20:08] it might be just right there at that
[1:20:10] moment when they're ready to push the
[1:20:11] button for the bombs to come but that's
[1:20:14] when you'll be caught up to meet your
[1:20:16] lord I tell you that ought to make
[1:20:17] somebody happy tonight that we will not
[1:20:20] be here when the bombs are coming we are
[1:20:23] not going through the destruction
[1:20:25] why because you are Abraham's seed look
[1:20:28] over at somebody and say you're
[1:20:29] Abraham's
[1:20:31] child every one of you every one of you
[1:20:35] you say well that's a long time
[1:20:37] ago but God protected that seed all
[1:20:39] through Every Generation generation
[1:20:41] after generation until in this day he
[1:20:43] would see another person another group
[1:20:45] of people another people that needed the
[1:20:48] faith of Abraham are you hearing me you
[1:20:50] needed that Faith to get out of here
[1:20:52] because there's going to be a lot of
[1:20:53] people trying to talk you out of the
[1:20:54] message message of the hour there's
[1:20:55] going to be an evil spirit here and an
[1:20:57] evil spirit there and they're going to
[1:20:58] come after our young people and our old
[1:21:00] people and our married couples and well
[1:21:02] come on somebody those devils are not
[1:21:04] here just to play around they're here to
[1:21:06] try to stop you from making a Rapture
[1:21:09] but we know who we are we know in whom
[1:21:12] we have believed and he is more than
[1:21:15] able to keep that which he's
[1:21:18] promised and I'm not going to I'm not
[1:21:20] going to stop believing now just because
[1:21:22] it's been this long or that long listen
[1:21:24] I'm still a young man but some of you
[1:21:25] have been believing this message for a
[1:21:27] really long time but you just hold on
[1:21:29] just hold on because it's going to be
[1:21:31] worth it all when you start to see those
[1:21:33] bodies change and your loved ones
[1:21:35] changing listen I know the message is
[1:21:37] under attack but I'm here to Proclaim
[1:21:39] this message is a Biblical message and
[1:21:42] it is still
[1:21:43] true that's right I don't care if he
[1:21:46] comes in your generation I don't care
[1:21:47] when he comes listen I I know I know
[1:21:49] people put a put a limit on God but I
[1:21:51] say take the limit off of God I say take
[1:21:53] the limits off of him because if you're
[1:21:55] putting a time limit on him I can show
[1:21:57] you hundreds of years and prophecies
[1:21:59] after prophecies but from Isaiah and
[1:22:01] Jeremiah and even times when Jesus would
[1:22:04] come David prophesied things they had no
[1:22:07] idea what the prophecy meant they had no
[1:22:09] idea what he was talking about but when
[1:22:10] they saw the Fulfillment of the prophecy
[1:22:13] they could look back and say this day
[1:22:15] that scripture is being fulfilled before
[1:22:17] your eyes and I can say we can see as it
[1:22:20] was in the days of Noah so shall it be I
[1:22:24] can say this day that scripture has
[1:22:27] already been revealed come on somebody
[1:22:29] we're already seeing the world in that
[1:22:31] condition we're already seeing it just
[1:22:33] like it was then when you can see that
[1:22:35] the natural affection of a man is
[1:22:36] different and the natural affection of a
[1:22:38] woman is different if you can't see that
[1:22:40] then you've never read your Bible but
[1:22:42] this is that time and it's time for the
[1:22:45] brid group to be getting ready for the
[1:22:48] promised son to
[1:22:51] come this is your time this is your time
[1:22:54] now get out of here before I before I
[1:22:56] make myself a liar again now we find
[1:22:58] that in those hours of real stress
[1:23:00] that's when God moves he moves he said
[1:23:02] now I'm going to go on down here ways he
[1:23:03] said now Jesus promises here that in the
[1:23:06] last days the son of man will be
[1:23:07] revealed again in that same type of
[1:23:09] group The Royal Seed of Abraham just
[1:23:11] before the fire falls remember the
[1:23:13] church never received any more witnesses
[1:23:15] Abraham and them didn't the promised son
[1:23:17] that they were looking for was brought
[1:23:19] right away after that and the church is
[1:23:21] looking for the promised son he will
[1:23:23] come right after the days of this
[1:23:25] ministry that's what a prophet said and
[1:23:28] I say Amen to it he will come right
[1:23:30] after the days of this ministry he
[1:23:33] didn't say he's coming right now he said
[1:23:35] he's coming right after the days of this
[1:23:36] ministry I tell you what in the days of
[1:23:38] the voice I'm here I'm ready I'm
[1:23:40] listening I know the message has come he
[1:23:42] said now he'll come right after he said
[1:23:44] he'll be revealed from the heavens now
[1:23:46] we see it too plain it's got to be if
[1:23:49] you're a Bible reader you can see it as
[1:23:51] plain in the scripture listen there are
[1:23:53] people the only way way that the
[1:23:54] denominational churches are able to
[1:23:56] Discount this is they have to say the
[1:23:57] Bible is
[1:24:00] wrong the only way that you can say that
[1:24:03] God was not going to send a Malachi for
[1:24:04] a prophet you have to say the Bible was
[1:24:07] wrong can you say Amen if if you say
[1:24:10] well as it was in the days of Noah well
[1:24:12] that was that was just their their
[1:24:13] opinion well then the whole Bible's just
[1:24:15] an opinion but something's got to be our
[1:24:18] absolute something's got to be right and
[1:24:21] I say this Bible is still right and
[1:24:24] wrong I'm going to take the Bible over a
[1:24:27] theological explanation every day of the
[1:24:29] week I'm going to take this Bible and
[1:24:31] this message that has come with a
[1:24:33] Vindicated Prophet every day of my life
[1:24:36] until the coming of the Lord why because
[1:24:38] I know who I am and whom I've had
[1:24:41] believed and he is more than able to
[1:24:44] bring a Rapture for me he's more than
[1:24:46] able Brother David to bring a Rapture
[1:24:48] for you he's more than able brother Gabe
[1:24:50] just what he's done in your life and
[1:24:52] sister Millie's life that same God that
[1:24:55] could do that is the same God that's
[1:24:57] going to cause a body change in these
[1:24:59] people same
[1:25:01] God when the doctor says no baby God
[1:25:04] says there's going to come a baby when
[1:25:06] the doctor said Abraham and Sarah was
[1:25:07] too old there come a baby anyway it's
[1:25:09] not always when you want it but it'll be
[1:25:11] right on
[1:25:13] time Moses he didn't want to deliver
[1:25:15] those children but God spoke to him in a
[1:25:17] burning bush he didn't want to go but he
[1:25:19] had to
[1:25:21] go Moses had heard of him being the
[1:25:23] great Jehovah but then he could see him
[1:25:25] he was in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:25:27] I've heard of you but now I see you what
[1:25:29] was he seeing in his word Vindicated oh
[1:25:33] that's what we need to look at tonight
[1:25:34] let's start looking at the word that's
[1:25:36] what's Vindicated not a man not me not
[1:25:39] you but the word is Vindicated and we
[1:25:42] become part of that word oh come on
[1:25:44] somebody he said he would bring them out
[1:25:46] with a mighty hand he said now notice he
[1:25:48] said the burning bush gave indication to
[1:25:51] what the prophet Abraham had said would
[1:25:52] take place I've heard of it but now I
[1:25:54] see it he said now we've heard that in
[1:25:56] the last days the son of man will will
[1:25:58] come among his people and reveal himself
[1:26:00] to the people in the same way he did
[1:26:02] that just before the destruction of
[1:26:04] Sodom and the son of man what did he do
[1:26:06] he know the secrets that was in Sarah's
[1:26:08] heart also give the promise to Abraham
[1:26:11] Abraham had heard God's Voice come on
[1:26:14] somebody how many's heard the voice of
[1:26:16] God today he might have seen him in
[1:26:18] different ways I don't know how he
[1:26:20] talked to him through dreams or through
[1:26:21] prophecies but this time he saw him he
[1:26:24] said I've heard of you but now I see you
[1:26:27] and the church has heard of God they've
[1:26:29] read of him and what he did and he
[1:26:31] promised but now we see him with our own
[1:26:34] eyes just like job did I've heard of you
[1:26:37] but now I see you my what it difference
[1:26:41] we we may not have had the faith of
[1:26:42] Abraham in the first six six Church ages
[1:26:45] but now we have seen the Vindication of
[1:26:48] scriptures in our time and we can say he
[1:26:52] is more than able because because he has
[1:26:54] kept that part of the promise and he's
[1:26:56] faithful somebody say he's faithful to
[1:26:59] keep that which he's promised in this
[1:27:01] day he said my he said Moses had a
[1:27:03] crisis and cried out and he said we find
[1:27:05] out Exodus 14 13th and the 16th verse he
[1:27:08] said Moses in that great strain there
[1:27:09] were the children of Israel inspiration
[1:27:11] struck him and he said what he was
[1:27:13] supposed to say not knowing he said
[1:27:15] stand still and see the salvation of God
[1:27:17] God had never spoke to him yet the
[1:27:19] inspiration struck him and they said why
[1:27:21] did you bring us out here we ought to
[1:27:23] have died in Egypt was it because there
[1:27:24] was no Graves down there bring us out
[1:27:26] here and let us die he said we could
[1:27:28] have lived in peace as slaves until we
[1:27:30] died but you brought us out here and
[1:27:32] Moses the prophet knowing he had access
[1:27:34] to God was inspired and he said stand
[1:27:37] still and you'll see the salvation of
[1:27:39] God for the Egyptians you're looking at
[1:27:41] today you'll never see them
[1:27:45] again the world that's looking at you
[1:27:48] that is trying to laugh at what you
[1:27:49] believe and make fun of you there'll
[1:27:51] come a day when you'll never see them
[1:27:54] again but what you'll see is him coming
[1:27:57] in the Clouds Of Glory for a people that
[1:28:00] is getting ready oh I wish somebody
[1:28:02] preach with me here for a minute you'll
[1:28:03] never see your enemy again when you get
[1:28:06] ready to get out of here I tell you what
[1:28:08] every one of them is laughing every one
[1:28:10] of them that's making fun they everyone
[1:28:12] dead but you have went into the land you
[1:28:15] have promised you have you have taken
[1:28:17] hold of the promises of God why it's the
[1:28:19] message of the hour that called you out
[1:28:22] and it's the same message that that will
[1:28:24] take you in can you say Amen it's not a
[1:28:27] message that has come with with just
[1:28:29] another another slant to an old Doctrine
[1:28:31] but this is a message that come with a
[1:28:33] certain time and a certain people in
[1:28:35] mind and it has come for a prepared
[1:28:38] people for a Rapture I say let's just
[1:28:41] get ready let's look up for your
[1:28:43] Redemption is drawing nigh your
[1:28:45] Redemption is coming well can you say
[1:28:48] Amen I'm going to I'm going to finish
[1:28:49] reading this and we'll try to get out of
[1:28:50] here he said God tells you what to do
[1:28:53] rise up and start walk
[1:28:54] he said it's all over when you can do it
[1:28:56] that way that's the way God does it when
[1:28:58] you see God manifested now through
[1:29:01] yourself he said it was God that told
[1:29:03] him to do it now all that was present
[1:29:05] all of Israel that was present saw the
[1:29:08] inspiration that struck Moses they seen
[1:29:10] God with their own eye blow that water
[1:29:12] back from one side to the other that
[1:29:14] Pillar of Fire LED them right across the
[1:29:16] sea he heard of God then they seen God
[1:29:19] and Joshua was in an hour of crisis when
[1:29:21] the armies was routed and the sun was
[1:29:24] going down now Joshua was a prophet and
[1:29:26] he knew that if the armies ever had a
[1:29:28] chance to unite again and come against
[1:29:30] him he would lose more
[1:29:33] man he knew that they were they were
[1:29:35] powerful armies they could come against
[1:29:36] him he said but there's only one thing
[1:29:38] if he could keep them running he'd WRA
[1:29:40] him everyone down but there wasn't
[1:29:42] enough light to do it so Joshua stood
[1:29:44] and raised his hands and said Son stand
[1:29:46] still and a moon hang over aelon till I
[1:29:49] get through with this battle and the son
[1:29:51] stood still and they heard Joshua speak
[1:29:54] and then they seen God with their own
[1:29:56] eyes in action now they had heard but
[1:29:59] now they could see oh come on somebody
[1:30:02] that ought to bring some faith in some
[1:30:03] people this is not an age where we just
[1:30:05] have to say I've heard about Moses I've
[1:30:07] heard about Elijah but I have seen in
[1:30:10] this day a Vindication that this message
[1:30:14] is real and it is the same message that
[1:30:16] brought the children of Israel out it is
[1:30:18] the same message that took them into the
[1:30:20] promised land and it's the same one that
[1:30:22] called you out of dead trespasses and
[1:30:24] sins and it's the same one that's going
[1:30:26] to take you in a Rapture can the church
[1:30:28] say Amen can the church say amen that's
[1:30:31] what you're looking for that's what the
[1:30:33] message is that's what it is it's a
[1:30:35] coming out and a going in the same
[1:30:38] message the same God we have heard but
[1:30:41] now we can see it is a message of
[1:30:43] Deliverance if you can believe it
[1:30:45] tonight it is a message of Deliverance
[1:30:48] the ones that didn't believe they
[1:30:49] couldn't follow but let me tell you if
[1:30:51] you can follow this message it is a
[1:30:53] message of complete and total
[1:30:56] Deliverance to you and to your household
[1:30:59] now I'm going to just read this and I'll
[1:31:01] close musicians go ahead and come my
[1:31:03] time is up it looks to me like if a man
[1:31:06] had any kind of spirituality he said the
[1:31:08] spirit of God him when he seen the Lord
[1:31:10] Jesus do just what he said he would do
[1:31:13] it would thrill his heart in such a way
[1:31:15] that he couldn't hold his peace any
[1:31:16] longer he would set the nation of fire
[1:31:19] with this message I wonder how many
[1:31:20] people we've got tonight that could set
[1:31:22] the nation of fire with this message
[1:31:23] message and say come see a man who not
[1:31:26] only told me but now I see can you say
[1:31:29] Amen it will be he said he said so it
[1:31:31] will be the message that went forth they
[1:31:34] merely laughed at it and mocked at it as
[1:31:36] someone who was telling some kind of an
[1:31:38] idol Tale But it it was a mercy and it
[1:31:40] was of Grace and it it was of
[1:31:43] Deliverance can you say amen and the
[1:31:45] angel said that morning to lot after he
[1:31:46] had given the message he said hasten and
[1:31:48] come hither for I can do nothing until
[1:31:51] thou Hast come hither I want you to
[1:31:52] notice this now he said we have to cut
[1:31:54] it short here he said I can't do nothing
[1:31:56] till you come hither what was it it was
[1:31:58] a message of
[1:32:00] Deliverance and before one Speck of fire
[1:32:03] could fall from Heaven La had to get out
[1:32:05] of Sodom and before one drop of rain
[1:32:06] fell from heaven Noah went into the ark
[1:32:09] and before the atomic bomb conract this
[1:32:11] nation the church will go in the Rapture
[1:32:14] can you say amen and he said to meet the
[1:32:16] Lord Jesus and if the Sputnik and the
[1:32:18] missiles are set he said and the Hammers
[1:32:20] are pulled back and the angels are all
[1:32:21] standing in order he said the great
[1:32:23] corridors of heav are crowded full the
[1:32:25] harps are all in tune the great bands

[1:32:36] in the coming of the son of man when the
[1:32:37] son of man is being revealed from heaven
[1:32:38] now remember before the rain fell Noah

[1:32:44] holding the hand of Russia with the
[1:32:46] atomic bombs until the church comes
[1:32:48] together and one great body of Christ I

[1:33:06] done then again in our day I say we
[1:33:09] should have no reason to disbelieve I
[1:33:11] say if let the faith of Abraham arise in
