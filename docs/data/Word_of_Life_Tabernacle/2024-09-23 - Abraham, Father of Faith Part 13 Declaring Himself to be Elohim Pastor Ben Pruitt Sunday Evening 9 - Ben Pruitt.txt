thank you for being here this afternoon it's good to have our visitors with us and just make yourself feel welcome tonight Genesis uh chapter 18 and verse 9 we're going to go back to our series on Abraham just briefly tonight and I trust it'll be a blessing to you as we talked this morning about the revealing of the son of man and um and dealt with that at the end time and I just did that to kind of set up where we're going to be going and with Abraham going forward you pray for me I've been talking all day I just have an Affliction in that area it helps when brother Joel's here because brother Joel talks a lot and he gives me a chance to rest so but we sure sure appreciate our ministers brother Stuart brother Joel are both out today brother Joel traveling back from Georgia and brother Stuart preaching we thank God for these fine men of God that he's given us to help and we sure need the help and sure appreciate those men Genesis 18 and9 says they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated it was God who came down in a body of flesh created himself a body God the creator of the universe he he took some dust we went over it just a couple of weeks ago and blew into it created himself a body and then he come down in that body and let's go have a potluck with Abraham let's go talk to Abraham see what Abraham's got to say and I want he wanted to reveal himself he wanted to fellowship with Abraham I I believe he still wants to fellowship with you tonight he still wants to fellowship with you he he wants to fellowship with me he wants to he wants to reveal himself to to us we just have to take the time to make him welcome so he can do that now the way that he did that now when he come down remember he had dust on his clothes brother brandom gives us that that detail of how he come down he looked like a weary traveler he come down just as any other uh human being would be and he come down in such a way that it seemed like that uh that they just uh that that he was just an ordinary man and to anyone without that caliber of faith that Abraham had it would seem like that this was just another man just another service just another passer by just another preacher but to Abraham he looked at it and said there's something more about what God's doing this is God speaking he said I've heard that voice before but there had to come a confirmation of Abraham's faith something that was done at that time that would tell him this is who I say it is this is who I think it is and so God was going to do something now we know that he is the word we talked about that this morning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word the Bible tells us is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart it's alive and powerful and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so we know that when God came one of the things that you could know God by is he would know things about us that we don't even know about ourselves he would know our past and our future he would know do you realize God knows everything about you tonight he knows everything you struggled with he knows he knows what you've been through during the week he knows what your bank account looks like he knows the Bible says if he if he cares for the sparrow if not a one will fall to the ground he said how much more are you worth than many sparrows we should always believe God knows us and he he cares about us but here at the end time we needed to know that God was speaking and so God was going to allow him to do something that he did when he was here on the earth to show us who he was not a man but God now look now Elohim come down in flesh and again that's a hard concept for some people because they see the flesh but it's God in us Christ in you Paul says the hope of glory so it's not just God in a prophet or God in this body that he created now he's he's separated himself into the body of Believers into his bride he comes down he begins to speak to him can you imagine if you just imagine the scene and the setting of it here's Abraham in the tent door he sees the dusty Travelers passing by and he stops him he says why don't you sit down here he said let me wash the Dust off your feet let me let me uh let me make you welcome and they come in and they begin to eat a meal and he's standing there shoe the flies away all of a sudden the man looked up at him and he said oh my this was going to identify which of these three was God in flesh he looked at him and he said where's your wife Sarah oh my notice what he says where is Sarah thy wife notice he did not call her by her old name Sarai which is s a r AI he called her by Sarah which was a name she'd only had for one day Abraham had only had his name for one day and Sarah had only had hers for one day what was it he was calling them by the names he gave them and so he identified himself by identifying who they were there's a revelation in that church he identified himself by identifying them and so he showed them who they were now watch what he did he actually God had changed Abraham's Name by inserting an H in the middle of his name what was he doing in the H at the end of Sarah's name what was he doing he was he was combining his name with their name he said I'm going to be your helper I'm going to be El Shai I'm going to I'm going to work through you I'm going to see that the promise is fulfilled and that your bodies are changed so notice now what he does when he comes and reveals himself he calls them by name and he said he said Abraham where's your wife and how did he know she was he was married where's your wife Sarah and and he it wasn't her name originally but he called her some of you kids like this by her princess name cuz Sarah means princess her old name I looked it up it means dominated thank God for a new name so she went from dominating to being princess aren't you glad that God doesn't just leave you with your old identity when he saves you he don't just leave you with your old identity he don't just leave you with all your sin and the baggage and the things hanging on you what does he do brother West he calls you out and he said I'm going to give you a new name I'm going to call you by your Royal Name by your Priestly name I'm going to call you Sarah amen Sarah princess he called her by her princess name a a and so this would be a sign that God knew her he knew who she was where is your wife Sarah it would show that this was a prophet he'd come as a prophet as we talked about this morning that the son of man would be uh a son of man would be a prophet that would come and that's how God would reveal himself as through a prophet he identified himself the one that stayed with Abraham identified himself he was sitting with his back to the tent he said remember he had been Abram till just a day or two before that and and now she is Sarah and he is Abraham notice he called him not his first name his given name but he called he said Abraham where is your wife Sarah Sarah princess and he identified himself by this sign calling their names and knowing the secrets of the hearts I've already quoted this scripture he said but the word of God is quick and Powerful do you believe it's powerful today let's say it to the the logos of God the word is alive and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing us under Soul and Spirit of the joints and Marrow is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so in other words he knows the secrets of the heart are you with me so far tonight he knows the secret of the heart I'm working a lot harder than anybody else here so I know it's tired man it's hard on a Sunday afternoon but let's just look at the word from me doesn't that refresh your soul doesn't it do something for you look the man looking at Abraham Sarah in the tent behind him said why did Sarah laugh saying how can these things be he identified himself and we know that this setting according to Luke 17:30 as as it was in the days of Noah Noah as it was in the days of lot this setting is to be repeated at the end time at the revealing of the son of man now brother BR said look at the world today if it ain't a common Sodom and Gomorrah I never seen one he said this a long time ago in the 60s look at today if it's not Sodom out there what is it right we live right in the middle of Sodom but look church that's not what our focus is on we're not focused on Sodom because we've been called out of Sodom and so our focus is not on what's going on all around us although that's part of it we see the signs of the times but our focus is not on that but Abraham was talking to the one who knew the secrets of his heart and I believe that the one that knows the secrets of your heart is still here today he's the same yesterday today and forever and he wants to talk to you he wants to he wants to have a communication with each one of us but he talked about Sodom and Gomorrah and how lot was sitting there and just grieving his righteous Soul like ministers today in many places who are afraid to speak out against sin afraid to speak out against the worldliness that's going on why because they they didn't have the audacity to stand up for what was right and that was lot it vexed his soul but he never did nothing about it he said that's the modern Sodom and Gomorrah today but there are some of those who are outside of Sodom I love this that's born out there not by the will of man but by the will of God and the seed of God can you say Amen to that today were you born outside of Sodom I didn't come from from Sodom I'm Sodom is not my destination Sodom is not my end I'm not going to end up in the tribulation period I'm going in a Rapture he said watch the identification there not just the preaching he said but the sign identified the word of God made flesh in a man there multiple examples in the scripture of the son of man revealing the secrets of people's hearts and he did that to show who he was so he did that to Abraham think about it you kids can even understand this he did that to Abraham he revealed The Secret of his heart and he said not only knew that he wanted a baby that he was married but what his wife's name was and said you're going to have a baby about this time according to the time of life so now he showed him who he was and Abraham said my Lord and identified him as Elohim now in in in in the gospels when Jesus came to the Earth he identified himself to Peter in John chapter 1 and verse 40 it says one of the two which heard John speak and follow him was Andrew Simon Peter's brother he first findeth his own brother Simon I love Andrew in the scripture if you go look him up Andrew was a helper Andrew was always getting somebody in the presence of Jesus I think that ought to be all of us he was getting somebody in the presence of Jesus and so he was uh he he first finds his own brother Simon says to him we we have found the Messiah which is being interpreted the Christ and he brought him to Jesus and when Jesus beheld him now notice he doesn't know anything about him but he said Thou Art Simon the son of Jonah thou shall be called sephus or Peter which is by interpretation a stone can you imagine what would that have done to him well it confirms in his heart that this is the one that Andrew told him about Andrew tells him it's one thing to hear it it's another thing to have the secret of the heart revealed and so in verse 43 we find a man named Phillip and the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto him follow me and Phillip was of bada the city of Andrew and Peter and Phillip findeth Nathaniel and sayith unto him so he goes looking for somebody to tell that we found the listen if you find the Messiah you're going to look for somebody to tell if you found the truth you're going to look for somebody to tell about it you're not going to be ashamed of it you're going to be looking for somebody that needs to hear it and so he found somebody that needed to hear it and he said we found him who are they talking about who Moses in the law and the prophets did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph notice who we found he saying we found the Messiah and Nathaniel said unto him and Nathaniel may be being a little bit of a legalist right right he says can there any good thing come out of Nazareth and Philip saith unto him come see what a great answer what a great answer can there be any good thing come out of come out of Hardy Arkansas come and see come see for yourself can there be any good thing come out of the place where you live he just said come look at him come see and Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith of him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no G listen to this this is powerful Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest thou me now you couldn't have told an Israelite by dress in that day from a bedin from a from an Arab or really have Arabs in but a Palestinian of any type they all look the same on the outside how did he know and how did he know that he was an honest man now think about it he he how did he know that and and Nathaniel said unto him whence knowest thou me I love Jesus answer Jesus answered and said to him before Philip called you when you were under the Fig Tree I saw thee now this is important how did Jesus know the things that he told the people he saw it right he had a vision of it he he he saw it in a vision so somebody comes to you and says I have a word from the lord well could be a word from the Lord could be a prophecy could be one of the nine spiritual gifts but the way that he saw it was by Vision because when the son of man came to the Earth he come as a prophet right but he was also God wrapped in flesh but he come as a prophet and so he sees it by Vision which is how a prophet would see it he said when you were under the Fig Tree I saw thee God's got eyes on you tonight he knows what you're going through he got eyes on you he knows what's what has happened what will happen he knows all about it so they had been taught that Messiah would be a prophet again remember the son of man they'd been taught according to Daniel according to Ezekiel they had been taught that the son of man the Messiah would be a son of man would be a prophet and so they recognized that that there must be something about him and so this was a sign that it was him in John chapter 4 we'll use this as a third witness so we could use others as well in John 4:4 the ible tells us that Jesus must needs go through Samaria he he had a a need to go by that way what was it there was a predestinated seat of God in Samaria that needed to be talked to that needed to have a conversation with Elohim so Jesus just like he went as a Dusty traveler to show himself to Abraham he goes and appears to the woman at the well she don't know where this man come from here she's coming up at a different time than everybody else did because of her uh her her her stigma she had because of the Scarlet Letter that she carried she was unable to come when everybody else did so she'd come up by herself and just at that moment here was Jesus sitting by the well and he just happened to be at the right place at the right time do you remember when you met him do you remember what it was like what was it Jesus found you you weren't necessarily looking for him but he was looking for you and he come by the place where you were he must needs go through Samaria I'm so glad the message come by my way I'm so glad that the gospel come by my way I'm so glad that I heard it I'm so glad I grew up where I did in the family why because God enabled me to hear the message I'm happy of that believe God's enabled you to hear it today and all of your life when you've heard it you can say thank God you had need to go by my way he begin to talk to her about the water now brother brandom tells us so when we go to witness to somebody don't don't beat them over the head with Doctrine right how do you witness to somebody he said talk to them about fishing something they're interested in talk to them and then after a while you can become friends with the person because they'll never accept it unless they believe that the one telling it is has an interest in their life right your kids are never going to believe you unless they know you love them you can beat them all you want to you can you can you can make them tow the line and keep all the rules but if they don't know you love them they're never going to believe it right because you you you've got to have that conversation brother brandom calls it contacting a spirit you got to have that conversation you got to have the time to spend with them God help us today he talks to about the water and and and and how the well and all those things and then he says something strange in verse 16 Jes Jesus saith un her go call thy husband and come hither call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and said I have no husband boy she's gotten good at telling that detail she got good at obscuring her past when someone ask but Jesus knew all about it and Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have not no husband for thou Hast had five husbands see she was looking for something Church she was looking for something and many times we see people on drugs people people on addicted to alcohol people addicted to cigarettes you look at and what are they doing they're looking for some fulfillment they're looking for something in their life that'll that'll make a difference in their life it's not and I think looking at that you say well why are they doing what they're doing because they're a sinner but we have a savior there's somebody who can save that person she was looking for something she couldn't find it so she had five husbands he said he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that say thou truly and the woman saith unto him sir now watch this she'd been taught that a prophet when he came would have this kind of knowledge and she said I perceive that thou art a prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship and Jesus said unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet Jerusalem worship the father you worship you know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him He said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in Truth Listen church it's not enough to just have the letter the letter kth but the spirit giveth life we've got to worship Him in spirit and in truth John 4:25 the woman saith in him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he has come he will tell us someone say it with me all things he will oh church and Jesus said unto her I that speak unto thee am he what was he doing declaring himself glory to God oh I don't mean to do I need to calm down on Sunday afternoon what was he doing he declared himself oh she was a seat of God he never told the Pharisees that plainly he never told pilate plainly he never told many others plainly but he told the woman at the well he said I am he that speaketh to thee he said I'm that person I'm the one you read about in the scriptures I'm the one Moses talked about I'm the one David sing about I'm the one that they pointed to all through the Old Testament I am he what was he doing declaring himself to be the god the logos the word that come from God and made a body of Flesh lived on the earth oh Church Jesus said I'm he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou why talkest thou with her oh my woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ brother brand said the reason she believed is because she had representation in heaven which shows us that always you know living the Pharisees lived much better lives but they did not have representation in heaven so they could not believe oh but she had the capacity to believe something on the inside when she saw the sign of the Messiah she didn't try to explain it away she didn't say well somebody told you that she said Thou Art the Christ can't come see a man who told me all the things I ever did is not this the Christ these three Witnesses among many others as I said tell us he is the Messiah he is the Messiah and yet he told us that when they looked for him for a sign they were always looking for another sign he said a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet Jonah and he left them and departed the sign of the Prophet Jonas which is Jonah what was the sign of the Prophet Jonas what was Jonah a type of he was a type of the Resurrection that's what Jesus said as the son of man was as Jonas was three days in the belly of the well so will the son of man be three days in the belly of the Earth right what was a sign of the Resurrection so in other words a sign that he was living that he was alive I want to show you because we realize and and and tonight I don't want to get too technical I want to preach this as much as I can but we realize that God still loves us he still cares about us he still knows and he come down in a prophetic gift in this generation that was one to an age that would tell us that but then he didn't stop there he's still a discerner of the secrets of the hearts but he come down in this special way in our generation so we could see that he was the same in leoa in this church age as he was at the Beginning Church age he was the same now as he was when he walked the shores of Galilee listen to this I this is from one service one service brother brandom is talking to the people he said the first thing I I see to the woman she's got sinus trouble it's a bothering her he said it's exactly right it's a headache like across their sinus it bothers her and I see you kneeling and praying now this isn't somebody supposing something it's not somebody that but what is it it's the same God not the man but God the same God that oh church that sat there and told Nathaniel when when you were under the Fig Tree I saw you that same God he said I see you kneeling in a room I hear what you're saying you're asking a worthy thing you believe he still hears you tonight you're asking a worthy thing you're asking God to give a CH give you a child a baby you're Barren and asking God to give you a baby that's right God bless you I've never seen him fail on one yet a woman in Chicago he said 50 something years old come and ask for a baby she got a fine boy she might have regretted it later she's 50 something years old but huh but because he said that was something it was a good desire it was something that that God wanted to give to his children he said may God grant it to you again he he says this he said seems like I I see like swamps or something I don't know whether it's this country lot of Cedar looks like swamp Willow it's kind of passing looks like Arkansas to me he said was you ever in Arkansas he said it seems to me like it was Arkansas it's Arkansas it's Jonesboro Arkansas the Blessed old Bible Hour Tabernacle where you're from and you're down there and you're trying to contact there's somebody else in there that's trying to make a contact said it's an aged woman that's standing he said you're from a rolling country maybe Missouri he said that's your mother he said there she sits right there she's got hardening of the arteries these aren't even people that were coming up to the platform it's just people in the audience that come to hear him in another state in another place he said that's right exactly the truth go believing and may the god of heaven give you the desire of your heart my sister through Jesus Christ's name again he said little lady sitting on the end of the seat there you're bothered with a nervous condition isn't it got real weary spill spells come on you don't fear it's gone from you you believe he can still deliver from nervousness today what was he doing there's a reason why this builds faith it builds Faith because we believe he's the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change if he healed somebody in 2,000 years ago he'll heal somebody tonight if they approach him in the same way if he healed somebody in 1965 he'll heal somebody tonight the same way oh I I don't I don't need a vision or or even a prophet to speak I believe God still does all of those things but I don't need those things to believe it I believe he's still the same and I believe that the Bible says if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover how many believe that today they shall recover what does that do it builds our faith knowing if he did it in my generation he can do it for me what was he doing declaring himself like he did Abraham Abraham you need a special portion you need to know this is him he said I'm declaring myself to be L him Hallelujah Oh my he said you got a nervous Condition it's gone from me what about you sitting there with prostate trouble we we believe God still heals that don't we brother Danny said the man looking down across the balcony right up there the elderly man prostate trouble getting up at night you believe sir raise up your hand standing right up here that's it you believe white shirt on sitting all right it's finished you're healed have you got a prayer card he said you don't have a prayer card you don't need one they use prayer cards to keep line or keep ordering the lines when they would have prayer lines and people today have tried to attribute this discernment to that and it's it's absolutely nonsense you don't have to read very far in the message to realize brother Brandon wasn't reading prayer cards because there are literally hundreds or thousands perhaps of cases where he spoke to people in the audience they he never met and never met again and some of them I've known and talked to some of you all known and talk to him brother brand preached future home there's two women on future home that he calls out that are from this area that I knew personally and one of them was Sister Brown I was her pastor for a while and I knew sister Brown never knew brother brandom she didn't know anything about him all she knew she was going to Jeffersonville cuz she'd heard that he was preaching and she went up there to hear him preach and she was sitting there she' come with somebody else with a worse condition than her and she's sitting there brother Brown speaks to her he said you little lady sitting on the edge of your seat he said he said you've got a signus trouble she didn't come with a great need but God cares about the small things too he said you got a sign of trouble if you believe it'll leave you and her testimony to me at a hundred years old when I met her was that God delivered her and she never had it again am you say that's something that you don't do by some kind of a trick are you with me now Satan wants to feed that to you to scare you but I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus [Applause] Christ he's still the same today he speaks to another lady he said you have a different type of nervousness the lady sitting there with a little paper in her hand you got a nervous condition too but yours is a weary type of nervous nervousness you're mentally upset all the time just seems like that you get gloomy and weary feeling isn't it that's right many times you get real weak before your day's work is done you have to sit down your strength is depleted isn't that right sometimes you get so weary you walk over to the window I see you pull back the window I see you pull back the window and walk back and forth that's powerful the sun shining down on the side makes you have a real gloomy weary feeling isn't that right if that's right raise up your hand hand that's right he said I'm not reading your mind but sister it's over your faith has touched him now now you go and be real happy said this lady Satan lied to you I seen a dark shadow come to you and said you're going to lose your mind go crazy he said that to you that's right suggested suicide and everything else but it didn't do a bit of good oh I think we could we could Rejoice right here for a while because that old same Devil he's still alive today and he still torments and he's tried to suggest suicide to many of you you but it didn't work why because God came by amen God came by and delivered you from that Spirit oh he's still a deliverer today Oh my he said that's right he said he said God it didn't do a bit of good God's healed you that's right you're going home now to be well again he said it's the lady with glasses on here she stands right here before me there she is he said viruses isn't it sister now we've had our fi of viruses haven't we he said got a virus isn't that right he said they don't even know what to call it so that's just an excuse the doctor give you that's all but it don't do no good now it's over what was it God declaring himself not the man but God was saying I'm here it's over you can go ahead and be well your faith made you well he said I don't know these those people I never seen them I don't know you but I challenge you in Christ's name to believe the Bible is true and Jesus raised from the dead he said Do You Believe believe that lady sitting right there yes had more faith than you thought you had some of you don't think you got enough Faith to believe that lady didn't think she had enough Faith to attract The Prophet's attention but he said you got more faith than you think you had I think we got a lot of people sitting here that's got more faith than they thought they had come on church he said faith is a subconscious thing so you don't work up Faith you can't sit there say I want more faith I want more faith that's not how it works faith is just something you believe huh it comes by hearing the word what happens you hear the word and suddenly you just say I know it's right yes I know I'm Healed you hear Hebrews 13 and8 and you say I know he's the same yesterday today and forever I me cont testify of that tonight I I know it's real subconscious it's not something you work up it's just something you come to something that comes that comes to you he said people try to he said to look to their intellect for Faith When Faith doesn't lay in here reasons lay here Faith lays in the soul he said now that trouble with your foot and leg you believe that Jesus Christ makes you well you do you accept it believe it he said I had a little arthritis too but Jesus Christ make you well you believe it he said all right then you can have it amen she just kind of had to come to herself for the angel the Lord was standing over her Hallelujah Jesus said if thou can't believe all things are possible it's one service oh Church it happened night after night place after place all over the world you're bothered aren't you lady you're worried about something at your side you're having numb spells in it that's right isn't it you're afraid it's gallbladder trouble causing it yes but listen what it is really you've got a growth on the spine now the doctor had told her it was her gallbladder you know there's a reason they call it practice medicine the doctor said it's a gallbladder but a prophet not because he was who he was but because of the Angel of the Lord that that that wanted to declare himself to be Elohim wanted to declare himself to be God he he spoke through him and he said he said you got a growth on the spine it's not gadder trouble he said ' isn't that right that's what's cutting the nerve off it isn't the gallbladder he was mistaken on that' we take a doctor's word like it's like it's the Eternal Word of God we ought to quit doing that the doctor might have given up on you but God never gave up on you the doctor might say it's cancer and I believe in doctors I believe we should go to doctors but just because the doctor says it don't mean it's going to happen believe [Music] God are you with me so far right he said it's that that's what's he said he was mistaken on that he said what it's really he said uh you've got to grow grow on your spine said growth in the spine pinching the nerve that's what's causing your numbness you have a gallbladder trouble but that isn't causing the numbness he said not going be well again same service you believe God will heal you that rupture mother sitting there with a little checked dress on you were praying saying Lord Jesus let this be my night isn't that right little mother sitting right there have faith in God believe him I wish you'd Lay Your Hands on the lady next to you he said CU she's got fitis that's bothering her bad said oh Lord I pray Lord Jesus you'll heal her and make her well he said mother being that you did that I love this he's there's a little lady sitting there and he's just having her lay hands on everybody around her why God works in a body God work oh church God said they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall that was the Eternal Word of God the same God that said Malachi 4 would come the same God said he would reveal the secrets of the heart that same God said they'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Hallelujah qu letting the devil beat you up say Well I'm always going to be this way you believe God's word over any doctor over anybody else it's little old mother sitting there he said the the lady with her hands on the lady mother Bean you did that he said turn your hand right back around catch the lady sitting behind you she got trouble in her side she wants to be healed too one service that was repeated hundreds of times and many times he told them their names their addresses where they come from what their Town looked like told sometimes 15 16 17 levels of detail about it what was it for he's doing the same thing that God did for Abraham look what he said he said see when I speak of this one who's come down from heaven a gift sent from God I just declare him here that's right amen again he said you just receive it only thing this does is just declare his presence a vindication a of him being here now he said he would be here right we should believe that but to Abraham's seed he said at the end time the son of man will be revealed what was it God said I'm I'm G to I'm G to I'm gon to give you the sign of the Messiah brother B said he did it to the Gentiles he did it to the Samaritans but it had never been done it had never been done it wasn't just a gift of Prophecy this wasn't just some man getting up and and randomly saying things until until he gets it right no but it was God showing a vision to a prophet and in doing that it wasn't even a vision like we could have visions or dreams that would have to be judge and it would have to be interpreted but this was not that it was a prophet of God standing there with thus sayeth the Lord and he stood there and told the people and was never wrong look what he said look what he said he said I will declare this that Jesus Christ the same great healer that walked the Sea of G Galilee is in this building now do we really believe that church I know it's 3:00 I know that food's setting a little heavy but look do you really believe it he's in this building now fulfilling that it might be fulfilled which you spoken by himself saying I will be with you even in you to the end of the world and the things that I do shall you do also again he said I declare that Jesus Christ raised from the dead and living among us today and the very thing things that he did then he does tonight in his resurrection he looked out upon his audience he knew the secrets of their hearts is that right he does tonight oh my now he said to the audience again he said here's a stranger I've never seen the man I don't know him never seen him God knows that far as I know I never seen him in my life but I declare that Jesus raised from the dead that the same things that Jesus did when he was here in a body that you could see is right here today doing the same thing he has raised from the dead and alive forever more blessed are your eyes and those who see these things and Believe on the Lord Jesus but what did he tell Thomas to be more blessed for those that have not seen and yet still believed but it happened in our generation said now let him speak from here this powerful statement and declare whether he's alive or not oh this this gospel is more than just word only there power and demonstration of the ho Holy Spirit brother Bram said there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ are you still okay I've got just a few more minutes and we'll close he said there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ it's two different words he said now is the appearing the coming will soon be he's appearing in the midst of us doing the works that he once did in his church he said now you're a part of that church and by Grace you believe I am a member of that church' he said' no I'm not a preacher you know I'm not I have not the education to do it sometimes I feel reluctant standing here by men of God who's called to that office there are Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists not all are Apostles not all are prophets not all are teachers not all evangelists he said when I'm standing here but my Ministry is a different Ministry from a pastor or teacher I'm not he said if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean it but this is my Ministry to declare him that he is here what was John the Baptist ministry the same Ministry when he stood there in the water and he stood and he saw Jesus coming and he said Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world and here stands uh here stands the Elijah of the end time and he stands in the meeting and he says Behold the Lamb of God he's here hallelujah he's a same yesterday today and forever he's going to change your body before Abraham could have a body change and go back back to where he could have a child he had to have an appearing there had to be an appearing of God in his life oh Church there's got to be you got to recognize what God did but you also got to recognize what God's doing let him speak to you through his body today amen amen listen he was not the only one to make a declaration are you with me now God wants to declare himself through you brother BR said when we're born of him we're filled with him see your life his life is in you then all someone say all all our actions should declare him he said it was like life like taking life out of one tree and putting it in another it may look different but the life is the same he said we have his name we should bear his name and remember we are now as his bride someone say now pregnated with his Spirit the church bearing children pregnant by his spirit with his name bearing his name bearing his life bringing forth the signs of his life evident with the preeminence evidence of his resurrection showing he's not dead but he's alive forever more how's he doing it today he did that through a prophet he don't have to do that again that was written in the scripture he would do it he does not have to come that way again but he did promised to be the same yesterday today and forever and so if he ever was a Healer he'll be a Healer today if he ever was a savior he'll be a savior today if he ever did preach the word he'll be a preacher today if he ever come to a housewife in her time of trouble he'll come to a housewife in her time of trouble today if he ever put put oh my if he ever put meal in the barrel he'll put meal in your Barrel why he's the same yesterday today and forever don't give up church we get discouraged because life doesn't turn out turn out like we think it ought to the son of man has been revealed we should not give up but we should press forward are you with me now church i' I've given all that I've got today trying to preach you let you know this is what God did in our day and what he's doing now this is eternal life and Vindicated he said vindicates to the world that we are alive in him Hallelujah he's coming for it what a word Vindicated bride somebody who's eaten the word and become the word hallelujah he said she'll be a little bitty group listen he said Jesus was God in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight is still God manifest himself he said brother Ben I I wish I could have been back there you said these things I got these needs in my life

Jesus is in you when tonight it's still God hallelujah manifest himself in the last days the son of man revealing himself where in his church Hallelujah the revealing of the son of man was never meant to just be limited to one body but he was separated into a many body the son of man revealing himself in his church the human flesh making himself known oh my church we only get a revelation of that
