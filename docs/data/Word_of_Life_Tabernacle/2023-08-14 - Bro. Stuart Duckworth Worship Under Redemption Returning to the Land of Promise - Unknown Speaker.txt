have need of is here Lord may we just just partake of that Lord at some point in this service Lord and Lord has come to that realization we love you we thank you for your people here tonight we pray that you'll bless him bless your word as it would go forth we pray in Jesus name amen we turn the Book of Ruth tonight the first chapter and got my new fancy iPad here I'm trying to figure out which angle I prefer better we'll figure it out as we go amen amen with this uh it's been a while since we preached and and I just been busy and probably certain things limited me from that but amen we're here this evening and we would just want to kind of continue that that line of thinking of worship under Redemption and just title it returning to the land of promise amen Ruth one now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the lamb and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was a lemonade and the name of his wife Naomi in the name of his two sons melon and Chilean aphrodites of Bethlehem Judah and they came in the country of Moab and continued there and elimelech Naomi's husband died and she was left in her two sons and they took them wives of the women of Moab the name of the one was oppa and the name of the other Ruth and they dwelled there about 10 years and melon and Chilean died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband and then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of mold before she had heard in the country of mobile how that the Lord had visited his people and giving them bread or of course she went forth out of the place where she was her and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah amen just pray the Lord bless his word you can be seated here when the story starts out as is a lovable sweet woman Naomi and her name means Pleasant elimelech her husband which means worship a pleasant worship I mean that's that's what a true family that serves God really is it's a place of pleasant worship I mean a place where the blood and the protection of God is applied and we when we started preaching uh this thought we we kind of went from you know the thought that we're we're going back to what Adam and Eve lost we're being redeemed back to that back to that family the image of that family where where God would come down on the cool of the evening and there they would worship amen and that that's what God wanted he wanted a man he wanted to see that family and and we live in a time where the family has just been completely broke down completely destroyed amen but we as Christians amen we we're we're not to partake in that amen our families should be built up in the things of God is that right and I just I just think about you know just the the support group that we have just as as Christians and not just as Christians but message believers right we have we we have we know so many people you know we know people and in every almost every state in different countries we have just a huge support group and a lot of people don't have that amen but the the home should be a a pleasant place of of worship a place where am in the protection amen of God is amen where the token has been applied and in a place where a place of love and faith amen amen for the things of God Amen for for the promises of God and and the things that we hold oh dear amen that ought to be something that that is talked about and amen that is the center of our homes amen breach amen a place where the presence of God is welcome amen just like our church here amen just like in our lives our homes amen should should match that amen should be that same type of atmosphere it can be that same type of place amen we're amen we're the fear of God is amen we're the angels of God are welcome amen where there's protection amen where there's where there's safety and where there's peace amen not a place where our our kids would would want to leave as as soon as they could but a a place of peace and a place of rest amen amen and that to me that's what a a blessed family a blessed home is come on remember we begin to look at this family here and you know amen even though we would be Believers that that doesn't make us immune from troubles sickness or strike we're all gonna get sick and then we're going to deal with sadness and then with Gloom and and be weary at times and sometimes we cause that and sometimes it's just a trial to test your faith amen but we continue our thought that that we are under Redemption amen we're not just under a Doctrine we're not just under an idea or a denomination amen but we as Believers were living under amen Redemption under the power of redemption amen and God Amen in that law of redemption is here to bring us through amen he's here to keep us by his power as we heard this morning amen kept amen by the power of God amen and there's power in Redemption Eminence power in the word and the things that we believe amen I think so many times we we Overlook and we we don't really realize and we're not able because we can't realize we can't really partake of the things that we have received amen but if we could just understand the power amen of the bleeding word of the power of redemption and the things that we we're trying to preach and that we're trying to portray if we could really partake of that amen the power they will bring in our lives so under the word for this day amen the opening of the word the fullness of the word that's been revealed and if we we were just talking in the back and it just kind of struck me here just just a few minutes ago under the opening of the word if we're waiting for something to happen amen we can't partake right now we're waiting but because the thing has been open to us maybe you don't quite understand it and you're you may we may never just understand everything but if you can if your faith can grasp amen that the fullness of the word has been open then what you have need of and it's here at this very moment and the age and the hour that you're walking and it's here for you to partake of is the fullness of the word has been revealed not just a portion but it's the power of redemption imminence the power of redemption the fullness of Redemption where it's bringing us to that fullness of redemption amen we're not just to save people here remember we're saved amen we're sanctified amen we're not just just filled with the Holy Ghost but we're standing here as a people amen ready for the Rapture amen and and and it's a complete work of Grace Redemption isn't as we said it's not just an idea it's not just a Doctrine I mean Redemption isn't just a partial truth amen Redemption is impartial but it's a complete work and to bring the person to bring the person amen him into that place of Grace Amen to where if the Rapture come right now I'll be ready to go that's why we have received in this hour him and we're worshiping and we're living under that that Redemption it's a complete work of Grace and so we're we're not immune to the things along the way we're not immune to to bad things happening to us sickness striking or different things the Redemption of Jesus Christ but it redeems you from sickness and then you can be healed amen it forgives sin it not only does it forgive sin but it destroys sin amen the power of the blood is so you never done it in the first place amen that's the power of the blood that's the power of the bleeding word amen thank you Lord and what we have come under it redeems you brother Brian says it redeems you from everything that's wrong double everything that was wrong with your life your past and we'll get into that I mean it redeems you from everything that's wrong every bad choice that you've made every bad choice that your family's made and you can say here this evening that I mean there's a lot of wrong in my life there's a lot of bad decisions a lot of problems amen still yet in my life or my family amen I just don't feel like I'll ever be strong enough or good enough to overcome it all amen but he takes all the wrong amen and we take on his righteousness we didn't have to be good enough amen but a lamb came forth amen one that was worthy amen and he showed himself alive it's after 2 000 years so you and I and then he come down and he opened the word he opened the seals to you and I the word amen of the top of it's been blowed open hey man we don't have to be good enough he came down and he was good enough and he's here to take all the wrong amen he's he's here to take away every spot every wrinkle every blemish amen and we take on his righteousness amen I mean the price has been paid by the one who who is worthy and he is Our Redeemer amen it has been paid by the one who has already overcame amen amen as we go on with this family elima Lake and his family they left the land of promise because of famine it was a time of drought a time of Hunger amen and brother Brian said a Jew's first mistake is when they leave the land of promise and the same for a Believer when when we get out of Christ that's when we get into trouble that's when bad things begin to happen right but stay in Christ that's what we're trying to as a preacher that's what you're trying to get the people to do that's what you're trying to do stay in Christ stay in the word make sure your experience matches the word amen stay in his promise for you stay in your land of what God has given you Abraham after he received the promise he had the Covenant of the Holy Ghost in type he had met Elohim God come down in flesh amen and met there with Abraham under the tree amen Abraham received the message amen he and Sarah received their body changing and returned back young so they could receive the promised son well here we are yet Abraham left the promised land of blessing and went to career right after that right after he had met Elohim there he left yeah what happened a little famine a little trouble caused him to doubt caused him to come on Sarah let's go we got to do something about this we gotta we got to try to do something about it ourselves you can imagine there being Sarah you know they're probably feeling pretty good about that time amen their strength had been renewed they'd been changed and they're a little doubt to come in a little little trouble and there they set out on a 300 mile Journey on the back of a camel Amen to leave where God had told him to stay amen but when he went down there he got into trouble hey man he went down there and he lied about Sarah being his wife and almost got a good man killed and brother Branham says here he says if jehovah-jari said the drought come on he left it anyhow he said God told you to do something you didn't do it you're back sliding so Abraham was backslid and any Jew left Palestine was back backslid that's their Promised Land amen so he left he he received the Holy Ghost in tithe yeah he'd met Elohim God and flesh God come down and met with Abraham amen and he gave him strength back in his body received the message and then he gave him that promise he confirmed that promise to him amen but at a little trouble and this just shows Humanity it shows him and we're the same way we're the same way sometimes a little trouble will cause you to doubt and cause you to backslid and cause you to try to go do it on your own but that's when we get into trouble we get out of the land but we've got to we've got to return back to the land amen we've got to come back to the land amen but even even in Abraham's backsliding it shows the elect not not that we would be better if somebody else would do the same thing but it shows the favor of God Amen even in his backslidings and wanderings God come down and would show him Grace I mean he was showing favor I mean he would he would bring restoration he would restore his wife back to him amen but but he had to repent he had to repent yeah he had to repent of his backside he's right sure right yeah we have that ability here as Believers to repent when we do things wrong amen and I asked this question what what do you do when you realize your backslid what do you what do you do come on really what what a lot of us do and what we've done through the years you just let it go you go on and you go on and sometimes we go hours sometimes we go days sometimes we go months sometimes you go years right what what do you do when you're backslid what do you do you start Right Where You Are don't let another minute go by oh yeah yeah you just stop where you're at and you ask God to forgive you and he is able and he is just to be able to do that do you believe that here this evening amen don't let it go on and on don't let it go on for weeks and months and I find myself here more recently oh God keep me true amen Wash Me Lord keep me clean sanctify me refresh me amen fill me a fresh with the Holy Ghost amen maybe I said something or done something that I you know just that little funny feeling you know what I'm talking about don't let it go on and on just just go to God with it and then return back amen amen God forgive me if I've said something wasn't right amen amen stayed prayed up church and then stay in his presence amen if we get out of step with the word get back instead and Believers sometimes sometimes we test God we see how see how much we can get by with come on now I know that's that's hard and that's top you know we get to feeling good we get to feeling things are going really good we'll get quiet on me things are going really good and you just and I'll just slip just a little bit you all know it's true that's right but that's human nature to be that way amen but but I don't want to live like that right hey man I want to be consistent I want to be a consistent believer I want to I want to stay prayed up I don't want to live in a bad Sun conditioning and I don't want to live amen where the Holy Ghost is grieved in my life amen because the Holy Ghost is bringing me from Victory to Victory hey man I don't have the victory without him amen without that personal amen so I I want to stay right I want to I want to be believing right amen I wanna I wanna stay in the land of promise that's good so we'll test it we'll test God and amen and God will let you do that but he'll he'll make it hard on you the message of Grace brother Brian says oh Abraham how Abraham tested God's patience told him Abraham stay in this land don't you go out of it but as soon as a famine come Abraham run and he says Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by grace and how do we test his patience today we're up and tomorrow we're down one day we believe in the next day we're wandering today we're methodists tomorrow we're Baptists today we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow little tummy ache comes and we don't know whether we to believe it or not but yet in the midst of all that God wants us to stay put but he saves us anyhow and if it wasn't for the grace of God we'd all be gone sure God Saves by his grace even in Ephesians 2 8 for by Grace you are saved through faith not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in I I love that scripture I probably call that scripture quite a bit amen but to think that that no man could boast amen the bad with you and I the bad has always outweighed the good we could never do good anything good enough to Merit his grace because his grace is an unmerited favor that he shows towards us by God's grace he holds us up in this hour by God's grace he saved me from a life of sin and by God's grace he'll take me in a Rapture amen God has a Grace provided amen for every step of the journey no matter how stubborn amen no matter how bad Sin we get sometimes a real believer they may get knocked down amen they they may stay down for a little bit but if you're a real believer you've got to get back up amen and walk in the grace of God Walk Amen in the workmanship amen that he has create created you into amen the beds always outweigh the good no man can boast there wasn't one that was but one that was worthy amen amen and it's simply his grace and favor on our lives as his redeemed we were completely lost without him yeah yeah amen that's right amen but with him we're completely redeemed amen we're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus Under The Works of redemption amen is redemption bringing us back bringing us back Amen to what we were in his mind amen I believe this word it's not just taking us back to Azusa Street come on come on it's not just taking us back to Amen to what fell on the day of Pentecost remember we're going back to what Adam and Eve lost right we're going back to that amen and I think that I think I believe that we're we're even going back further than that we're going back to what we were in his mind yes I mean you can take Adam and Eve even they're at their best they were vulnerable remember we're going back even beyond that to where we're just we're the queen of God we're the Queen of Heaven and that's the position that we'll hold in the Millennium amen we won't just sit outside the city remember we will be in the city all right brother Brown he said this and it may may stump you it shouldn't confuse us but there will be those outside the city he said that we'll be doing what Adam and Eve did amen during the Garden of Eden they'll be dressing and chilling he said but they're redeemed and then the elect of bride will be inside the city as the queen amen we're going back Beyond even further than what we can see sometimes that's what Redemption is bringing us back to yeah Hallelujah well thank you Lord brother Ram says here in the kinsman redeemer he said Naomi because of a famine wandered out from the lands and went into Moab finding bread and so she left she left God's land she left the land that she had you know God's Promised Land There was a famine there yeah but there was bread in in this other land in the land of Moab he said she didn't have to do that because the rest of them stayed in Judea Bethlehem Bethlehem means the Bethel the house of God house of praise and they stay there but something you know a little trouble happened and this this family that caused him to leave and no matter how desperate or bad things get they get gone always has a way of sustaining his people in a time of need and in times of trouble right right amen amen don't we don't have to jump from church to church you don't have to run down try to run down the best preacher in the message man if you'll just stay in your lands if you're to stay in your land if you're to stay in your position no matter how bad things get God will come on the scene because God is our sustainer God is our refuge if we'll just stay put he'll provide for us God is always amen being able to meet the need in time amen so they left their home to wander into so sojourn and then they left Bethlehem I mean they left the place the house of God's bread and Judah Judah means praise they left the house of God's bread the house of praise in the land I mean in the land amen if they would have just stayed in the land was everything that God's people would ever need he would he would provide it there it was a land I mean it was a land of bread it was a land of worship hey man amen they got out of the land of worship they got out of the land of bread can you see what I'm saying here amen we've got to return church amen if we're out of Step we've got to return unto that land Amen in that land there was there was bread there was worship there was Joy amen there was Redemption it was the law of redemption amen oh if we're out of Step amen it's time to return amen brother Branham says here he goes on the kinsman redeemer he said now the mohabbats originated from an illegitimate child which was law to daughters and they had after the escape the fires of Sodom by the grace of God then the daughters got their father drunk and lived with him as wife and they brought forth a child and one of them was originated and brought in the nation of more supposedly to have been Christians he said but we're mixed in paganism and see leaving the promised land no matter how bad it was the sojourn in another land brought trouble so we could look at we could look at Moab as it was a land of bad decisions and you you go back to a lot and man in any time lot would make a decision that seemed to be the wrong decision Abraham said you go this way I'll go this way amen but lot chose the well-watered plains is that right he chose he chose wrong amen and and there he he got tied up amen with the politics of the city of the city that God would destroy God he got tied up with it another bad decision don't get caught up in politics don't become the mayor of the place that God's going to destroy right don't get tied up with those things don't get tied up with unbelief in the world right and there they went on and they made bad decisions his wife was she turned back and she was amen turned to a pillar of Saul another bad decision in that line of family there right and so they left there and amen another bad decision after a bad decision you understand what I'm saying there Amen in the land of bad decisions amen but if you see here this family amen predestination this is where predestination comes in if God ordains something to be it will be right amen there's a predestination and a foreknowledge and man there will take all the wrong as we said earlier all the bad decisions it will bring redemption in that Amen in God's purpose amen God's purpose it is predestination and it's foreknowledge his purpose for you and I am in the midst of all the everything that is wrong about us amen he has a Plan of Redemption and it is greater than our bad decisions amen out of that he will bring Redemption he will bring life from death amen and who is this was good he says here that the the predestinated is the only ones that's considered in Redemption no one else only they're predestinated and he said people might be making like they are but the real Redemption is those that are predestinating because the very word redeemed means to bring back to redeem something is to to bring it bring it back to its original Place says hallelujah so it's only the predestinator that will be brought back because the others didn't come from there see bring back he said being Eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had is thought of what she was only he wanted you he wanted me to stand in the Pulpit he said he said he wanted you to sit in the sea tonight he said then we aren't serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to Earth to serve his purpose amen that's a lot to swallow there but only the predestinated or considered in Redemption amen amen the one that left home left the Heavenly he came to Earth to serve his purpose and when Jesus came amen amen it was God God becoming human God the amen humiliated himself amen he came and he was ridiculed and made fun of they called him illegitimate they called him the devil amen but he was the Prince of Peace he was the very Heart Of God expressed through Humanity he wasn't a lesser person but it was the same person it was what God was in the human form amen but amen not just as he come to El to Abraham in the in the form of Elohim but this one came to be born Amen to live and breathe and die man that he could redeem amen that we could come into the land of redemption that we could come amen from our mistakes and our bad decisions and then we could go to the land of redemption and be redeemed because we were in his mind amen because we were considered as a predestinated Amen to be redeemed yeah that's good he was a very Heart Of God he came and he overcame amen he overcame as a man not using his power because we heard this morning amen not not using his own power amen but he took the word and it's seasoned amen Satan would try to take him amen and use the word out of the Season yes it was the word amen but it was out of a season amen and he said Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone amen but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God Amen we're not just isolated to a scripture amen but this broad amen she will be the fullness amen of the manifestation of the revelation of the hour amen we will take on Amen you may not see it now but we will take on the identity of this message just as Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament we will fulfill the New Testament and then when Jesus had overcame and he amen when he died and he rose again he said I come from God and I go back to God Amen and when this Earthly or this Earthly journey is over in man we come on screaming we bypass the Heavenly we bypass our Theo often his brother Brandon said amen when we come down to be tempted Amen to be tried Amen to prove who we were amen and when we overcome that Last Enemy when we overcome the last devil amen we came from God and we'll go back to God Amen in a Rapture Grace yeah oh thank you yes come on now I don't mean to yell at you amen amen we come from God and we're going back to God despite our bad decisions yeah amen amen we all had a decision to make we all had to decide at some point yeah you you had to make a mental decision for yourself even though we're predestinated you had to make the choice that I'm going to serve God but I I can't do this on my own anymore right you tried you tried to you tried to amen shake the all the wrong that that was in your life we tried we tried we tried to do it our own but there come a time when we had to surrender right we couldn't do it our own we had to do a decision amen I'm dead I'm dead and sin and trespasses amen and I want that life amen I want the life of the Holy Ghost living in me amen I can't do it on my own I need him we had to make that decision that we we could no longer do it on our own Ruth one verse 8. Naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mother's house Lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me the Ruth and orpa they hadn't had they had to make a decision Naomi try she tried to persuade them to go back go back to their homes go back to their religion go back go back to their gods go back to where they came from later on said they lifted up their Voice verse 14 and wept again an orpha kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth clave unto her you see the predestination there hey man she she come from paganism she come from bad decisions she knew nothing of of the law of redemption of of the bread and different things that was really there remember there was something in our heart she claimed unto Ruth going to Naomi I'm sorry she said behold our sister-in-law has gone back under her people in her under her Gods return Thou after her sister-in-law after Thy Thy sister-in-law and Ruth said and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest thou will go and whether thou law just I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God shall be my God Amen where you die that's where I die where you're where you're buried that's where I'll be buried I mean there was something different about Ruth right and brother Brown says here he says one of our darn laws orpa said she would return back to her country to her Gods to her church to her people and Naomi tried to get Ruth to go back but she said you your people are my people your God is my God Amen where you're buried I'll be buried I'll not turn back yeah I'll not turn back and that that was in her lineage as we said before if you look back that was in her lineage or her great great great grandmother turned back amen but there was something there was a predestination there there was something in root that was different there was something drawing her I'll not turn back and brother Brown said that's when a person has caught the vision don't make any difference what her people said you're going over there to become a holy Roder or something that didn't make any difference to Ruth because there was a purpose of God to be fulfilled and just as sure as you're hungering tonight for the Holy Spirit there's something in you pulling you that's a that's a purpose of God in your life that God has for you to be fulfilled just like it was with Ruth he said that's what God wants and man it's not that borderline halfway but an absolute I mean it's a full surrender to the kingdom of God amen he goes on here he says notice Ruth was willing to forsake her Gods forsake her past life for sacred people forsake everything in return with Naomi no matter what the circumstance was she was willing to go on he said that's the way every man or woman that comes to Christ must first be willing regardless he said I never like to tell people you're going to prosper or be a rich man now or God's going to bless you you ain't gonna have no sickness I don't promise him that because God doesn't promise him that he said I say if you're really born again in your heart I don't care how rough the road gets you'll stand and hold on to God's unchanging hand no matter what lays before me if Jesus goes with me I'll go amen that's the determination of every believer that that's a faith amen that has to be in our heart no matter what happens I'm gonna go on with Jesus I'm gonna go on with the word amen no matter amen I may have fell down a thousand times I'm going to get back up I'm gonna go on hey man I'll wander down here pretty

wings of almighty God at Pentecost the Gentile Church the bride and when she returned he was barley seasoned amen they had returned back to the land amen they had been on a journey they had been
