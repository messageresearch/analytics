[53:04] going to go this direction this morning
[53:06] and we trust it'll be a blessing to you
[53:08] we preach just just a while back but
[53:10] it's just on our hearts so we want to
[53:12] deliver our heart this morning
[53:13] appreciate each one coming out and
[53:15] appreciate all that was done for us
[53:18] while we was here and the wonderful food
[53:20] and the fellowship and the little cabin
[53:22] to stay in and I I appreciate that and
[53:26] heard some wonderful preaching some
[53:28] great men of God here and I feel the
[53:30] least of all of them
[53:32] and I have just a simple thought this
[53:34] morning because really that's the only
[53:36] kind I can preach but I trust it'll be a
[53:38] blessing to you if you have your Bibles
[53:40] turn with us to the book of First John
[53:41] and we want to thank brother Ben for
[53:44] allowing us to come and just being here
[53:46] this weekend it's just been so wonderful
[53:49] uh
[53:50] I desire you to pray for my wife
[53:53] Monday morning early she's going to have
[53:55] surgery on one of her eyes and so we're
[53:58] going to be here tonight I'm going to
[53:59] leave early in the morning to get back
[54:01] in home I got about 600 miles to to
[54:03] travel and get back home to be with her
[54:06] so we can make sure I spend a little
[54:08] time before she has the surgery Monday
[54:10] morning so I appreciate you I know
[54:11] there's a lot to pray for there's so
[54:13] many needs but if you think about it
[54:14] just just say a little prayer for my
[54:16] queen I I appreciate that
[54:20] amen she sacrificed so much through the
[54:23] years
[54:25] first John chapter 4 I want to read
[54:27] verse 9 and also we only read Hebrews
[54:29] chapter 12 verse 2. do you love him
[54:34] yeah
[54:36] he's healing in his presence
[54:42] the Bible says this first John 4 9.
[54:47] and this was manifested the love of God
[54:50] towards us
[54:53] because that God sent his only begotten
[54:56] son into the world
[54:58] that we might live
[55:02] through him
[55:04] that we might live
[55:08] through him
[55:10] Hebrews 12 2
[55:16] amen
[55:22] thank you Father
[55:25] thank you
[55:29] Hebrews 12 2.
[55:33] looking unto Jesus
[55:35] the author and finisher of our faith
[55:39] who for the joy that was set before him
[55:42] endured the cross
[55:45] despising the shame and is set down at
[55:48] the right hand of the Throne of God
[55:52] amen
[55:53] that's Bower heads I want to speak to
[55:56] you this morning on just a little
[55:58] thought of Because He Lives
[56:06] Heavenly Father
[56:10] we love you Lord
[56:13] we thank you for all that you've done
[56:16] for us
[56:18] father I pray this morning that
[56:21] you would make it real lord
[56:24] take us there God and let us see what
[56:27] you saw
[56:28] and feel what you felt
[56:32] father I commit this congregation and
[56:34] our self into your hands
[56:36] For Your Glory
[56:38] in Jesus name
[56:40] and the Saints said
[56:42] God bless you you may be seated
[56:48] brother Branham in this scripture
[56:50] reading he says no God is saying here
[56:53] look unto me
[56:55] for I am God and there is none other
[57:00] and I like to say this morning that
[57:02] there is no God like our God
[57:06] there is no God like our God
[57:09] men make Gods out of their hands they
[57:11] fashion Gods out of their hands but we
[57:13] serve a god this morning that we didn't
[57:15] make with our imagination we didn't make
[57:17] with our hands but he made us with his
[57:20] hands and there is no God like our God
[57:23] he can do exceeding above all that you
[57:25] could ever hope for that you could ever
[57:27] desire for and you think well I know so
[57:29] much about God we've not even broke into
[57:31] the surface Harley of how great our God
[57:34] is and the prophet said and now God said
[57:37] here look unto me for I am God and there
[57:38] is none other and he said and I wonder
[57:40] in a time that we are living in now what
[57:43] could we look to that would be more
[57:45] solid than God and God is the word see
[57:48] so look to the word of God today for
[57:51] your answer look to the word of God
[57:53] today for your answer because let me
[57:55] tell you the Democrats don't have the
[57:56] answer the Republicans don't have the
[57:58] answer Washington don't have the answer
[58:00] but the answer today is here it's Jesus
[58:03] Christ the word the same yesterday today
[58:05] and forever the prophet said see look to
[58:08] the word of God today for your answer
[58:09] the Bible has the answer for this day
[58:11] it's had the answer for others day other
[58:14] days and it's gone it forever because it
[58:16] is Christy the same yesterday today and
[58:19] forever now there there is no stability
[58:22] in the society as we know it today
[58:25] they've ripped up the foundations of
[58:27] marriages
[58:31] they've ripped up the foundations of
[58:33] genders
[58:35] yeah
[58:36] and there's no stability in this
[58:39] unstable Society
[58:41] they have blurred the lies between right
[58:43] and wrong to the point that no they
[58:45] don't even know what the truth is
[58:47] anymore
[58:48] and so everybody is right in their own
[58:50] mind according to them
[58:53] and even in the days of Jesus we see
[58:55] this same attitude because Jesus stood
[58:57] before Pilate
[59:00] and pilate asked him
[59:02] what is truth
[59:07] and the sad thing about it is truth was
[59:10] standing right in front of
[59:12] it
[59:13] and then today when fox says CNN is fake
[59:16] and CNN says Fox's thing and everybody's
[59:19] looking for the truth of what they say
[59:21] is the truth and the truth is right here
[59:23] Among Us and yet they do not recognize
[59:26] it
[59:28] they call us a cult and Fanatics and
[59:31] this and that and bookworms and plain
[59:33] J's and all these comments that they
[59:35] made but they don't realize that truth
[59:37] is standing right before them
[59:40] that this all Hallelujah that this body
[59:43] that is on the Earth today is what God
[59:45] desired for this generation we didn't
[59:48] stagger into this thing God placed us
[59:50] here before the foundation of the world
[59:52] and he never put us here to lose he
[59:54] never put us here to give up or come on
[59:57] somebody but he put us here because he
[59:59] knew that we through the word would
[1:00:01] overcome the same
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:05] the only foundation that is sure the
[1:00:08] only foundation that is true is the word
[1:00:11] of God
[1:00:12] on Christ the solid rock I stand on
[1:00:16] other ground is sinking sand
[1:00:21] amen that's not a song anymore that's a
[1:00:24] reality
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] they say follow the science they don't
[1:00:30] even follow the signs
[1:00:33] if they thought of the science they
[1:00:35] wouldn't do some of this foolishness
[1:00:36] that they're doing
[1:00:39] amen
[1:00:41] amen
[1:00:43] but you see the word of God is an Ever
[1:00:46] present help in the time of trouble
[1:00:51] now when the children of Israel was
[1:00:53] living in the wilderness
[1:00:55] they were being bitten by snakes
[1:00:59] and the prophet said Moses couldn't pray
[1:01:02] for all of them
[1:01:03] so then God told him to go and erect the
[1:01:06] brass servant Serpent and put it on a
[1:01:08] pole and they were to look upon that
[1:01:11] brass Serpent and live
[1:01:13] and the prophet said let's take a symbol
[1:01:15] of that the first thing the brass
[1:01:16] serpent represented was Jesus himself
[1:01:21] because the serpent represented sin
[1:01:23] already judged from the Garden of Eden
[1:01:26] and Jesus was made sin for us
[1:01:30] knowing no sin but he was made sin for
[1:01:34] us
[1:01:35] the breast that the serpent made out of
[1:01:37] represented Divine judgment because
[1:01:41] brass is divine judgment and the pole of
[1:01:45] course was the cross and the brass
[1:01:47] serpent couldn't pray for anyone and
[1:01:49] they just looked at the brass Serpent
[1:01:51] and lived look and lived and that was a
[1:01:54] type of Christ and if they could look at
[1:01:57] that type and live if they could look at
[1:01:59] that type and live how much more are we
[1:02:02] to look at the anti-type Jesus himself
[1:02:07] Jesus himself to look and live
[1:02:11] the only way to live is through Jesus
[1:02:14] Christ for he said I am the way the
[1:02:17] truth and the life
[1:02:22] the prophet one time was up in Canada
[1:02:25] yeah and then some women come down
[1:02:26] through the hotel room with a bottle of
[1:02:28] liquor
[1:02:29] and they were drunk and they were
[1:02:31] kicking up their heels and he said I was
[1:02:33] standing there
[1:02:34] and they come by me and said one of them
[1:02:37] kicked up their leg and said whoopee
[1:02:39] this is life
[1:02:40] and he said I couldn't take it and I
[1:02:43] stepped out of the Shadow and said I
[1:02:45] grabbed her by the hand and said that's
[1:02:47] not life that's death
[1:02:53] that's death
[1:02:56] amen what the world calls living today
[1:03:00] it's death
[1:03:04] people starve they'll sell out their
[1:03:06] soul they'll shell out everything to be
[1:03:08] popular
[1:03:09] to have money there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:11] having money you got money God bless you
[1:03:12] but if that becomes your God that's
[1:03:15] wrong
[1:03:16] when you strive to become something big
[1:03:19] or something popular there's only one
[1:03:21] big one Among Us
[1:03:24] and people stop at this oil to be like
[1:03:26] this look what Collywood did to Miley
[1:03:28] Cyrus
[1:03:31] but people spend all kinds of money to
[1:03:33] buy Kate Spade pocketbook and what
[1:03:36] happened to Kate's face she hung herself
[1:03:38] in a hotel room
[1:03:40] because that is not living
[1:03:43] there is nothing that all it might
[1:03:45] satisfy the flesh for a while but it'll
[1:03:47] do nothing for the soul that hungers for
[1:03:50] God
[1:03:51] and God placed that desire in every one
[1:03:54] of us
[1:03:57] amen the Bible said she that liveth in
[1:04:01] pleasure is dead
[1:04:03] while she yet living
[1:04:06] the Bible says in First Corinthians 15
[1:04:08] 22 for as Adam as in Adam all die
[1:04:12] and Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:04:16] shall all be made alive
[1:04:22] Hallelujah you see from the time we were
[1:04:25] conceived
[1:04:26] we were dying
[1:04:29] that's exactly the truth
[1:04:33] amen
[1:04:35] when I first come into this area I was
[1:04:37] 27 years old
[1:04:40] look at me today
[1:04:42] we're dying
[1:04:44] amen the promises you're born defeated
[1:04:49] and that birth can never bring you to
[1:04:52] life
[1:04:52] that natural birth can never bring you
[1:04:56] to life because you're born defeated in
[1:04:59] a defeated World amongst defeated people
[1:05:01] a much defeated Creeds amongst defeated
[1:05:04] denominations but you've got to come to
[1:05:07] Victory somehow
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:09] and let me say there has to be a Victor
[1:05:12] before there could be a victory
[1:05:17] hallelujah look unto him and live the
[1:05:21] prophet said what did he do then he
[1:05:23] embraced the cross and on the cross he
[1:05:26] died for me
[1:05:30] and he died for you I want you to
[1:05:33] understand this morning the love of God
[1:05:36] so rich so pure that if he was the only
[1:05:39] person in the history of humanity that
[1:05:42] was ever lost he would have went to
[1:05:45] Calvary for you
[1:05:47] if you was the only person in the
[1:05:49] history of humanity that was ever sick
[1:05:51] he would have took every stripe on his
[1:05:54] back for your healing
[1:05:58] because you see the new birth is more
[1:06:00] than raised in your hand it's more than
[1:06:02] saying God sent a prophet it's more than
[1:06:04] having a picture of the pillar of fire
[1:06:06] the new birth is a personal experience
[1:06:08] you have met this person
[1:06:11] come on
[1:06:13] well I believe the message chose the
[1:06:15] devil
[1:06:17] but it ain't going to take him but one
[1:06:19] place and you know where that's at
[1:06:21] come on somebody
[1:06:23] but it is it's more than a handshake he
[1:06:27] wants it to be a personal revelation
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:31] amen
[1:06:33] he embrace the cross
[1:06:35] he died for me and he died for you and
[1:06:39] for the world that he might restore us
[1:06:41] back again to God to what Sons and
[1:06:45] Daughters of God
[1:06:48] he didn't come to take us from a hog and
[1:06:51] make us a lamb
[1:06:53] he come to restore us back to our
[1:06:56] rightful position has Sons and Daughters
[1:06:58] of God
[1:06:59] [Applause]
[1:07:02] oh the prophet said if people can only
[1:07:04] see that if I could only pound that into
[1:07:07] the people Jesus died that he might take
[1:07:11] you away from this hybrid Church stuff
[1:07:16] that he might bring your minds and Faith
[1:07:18] away from what man has said back to what
[1:07:21] God Said
[1:07:24] come on not a hybrid Faith well maybe
[1:07:27] the days of Miracles has passed well
[1:07:28] maybe it won't happen it'll never happen
[1:07:30] with that kind of attitude it's a hybrid
[1:07:33] faith
[1:07:35] but he come to bring her faith back to
[1:07:37] the word of God for heavens and earth
[1:07:39] will pass away yet my words shall never
[1:07:42] fail amen
[1:07:44] then our faith don't rest on emotion it
[1:07:46] don't rest on sensation come on somebody
[1:07:48] it don't rest on how we feel Faith has a
[1:07:51] resting place that's the word of God
[1:07:53] Abraham
[1:07:55] [Applause]
[1:07:58] he might bring your minds and Faith away
[1:08:01] from what man has said
[1:08:03] back to what God Said
[1:08:06] not a hybrid Faith well maybe the days
[1:08:07] of Miracles past maybe it won't happen
[1:08:09] Jesus never died that we would have a
[1:08:12] weak Faith a hybrid Faith well I don't
[1:08:15] know if it'll work or not see he died to
[1:08:17] bring her faith back to what God Said
[1:08:23] he come to bring our faith back to what
[1:08:26] God Said
[1:08:30] because God will keep his word
[1:08:32] 100 times out of a hundred
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:39] so go with me just for a few minutes
[1:08:40] this morning
[1:08:42] let's just take a little trip
[1:08:46] and if you go with me this morning
[1:08:49] now I can't preach as fast as these
[1:08:50] other guys I'm an old man so y'all
[1:08:51] better with me
[1:08:55] but go with me this morning young people
[1:08:59] we find ourselves
[1:09:01] in a garden
[1:09:04] and we see over there under a tree lays
[1:09:08] three men
[1:09:10] and they're sleeping
[1:09:13] and we go about a stone throw away
[1:09:17] and we hear a voice
[1:09:21] it's the voice
[1:09:23] of a man
[1:09:27] his voice is trembling
[1:09:32] he's in great agony
[1:09:36] and we can hear by the tone of his voice
[1:09:41] that he's afraid
[1:09:46] it is The Voice
[1:09:49] of Jesus
[1:09:52] brother Daryl
[1:09:54] Jesus afraid
[1:09:57] the Bible says in Hebrews 5 7 who in the
[1:10:01] days of his flesh
[1:10:02] when he had offered a prayer and
[1:10:04] supplication with strong crying and
[1:10:07] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:10:10] from death and was heard in that he
[1:10:17] feared
[1:10:21] he's sweating
[1:10:23] because it's in agony he's shaking his
[1:10:25] body's shaking his voice his trembling
[1:10:29] and he's praying brother Kobe
[1:10:32] and his prayers so hard it's so sincere
[1:10:36] that he begins to sweat
[1:10:39] this ain't a God blessed Mama God bless
[1:10:41] daddy jumping this is praying from the
[1:10:43] depths of his soul
[1:10:46] here's a man that's wrestling it out
[1:10:48] with God
[1:10:50] between his will and the will of the
[1:10:54] father you see Jesus said many many
[1:10:57] times I come to do not my will but the
[1:11:00] will of he who sent me
[1:11:02] I only do that which I see my father do
[1:11:07] but here it's the only place we ever see
[1:11:10] that the will of Jesus
[1:11:12] comes into view
[1:11:15] and he's praying so earnestly
[1:11:21] and he sweats
[1:11:24] and this sweat is turning to Great drops
[1:11:28] of blood
[1:11:31] you see there's a medical condition
[1:11:32] known as hemotradosis
[1:11:35] and hematronosis is when the capillaries
[1:11:37] of the sweat glands they actually
[1:11:39] rupture and the blood sweet seeps into
[1:11:42] the sweat glands
[1:11:46] and you actually literally sweat blood
[1:11:51] it is like is it is a medical condition
[1:11:54] that happens under extreme physical and
[1:11:58] mental
[1:11:59] stress
[1:12:02] and the only place in the Bible re-read
[1:12:05] this is Luke Luke records this being a
[1:12:08] physician he understood what was
[1:12:10] happening
[1:12:12] for Luke said that being in agony and
[1:12:15] that word agony means a struggle for
[1:12:17] victory
[1:12:20] in the garden it was a struggle for
[1:12:23] victory because there has to be a Victor
[1:12:25] before there could be a victory
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:30] so in agony a struggle for victory the
[1:12:34] Bible said he prayed more earnestly
[1:12:38] and his sweat was like drops of blood
[1:12:40] falling to the ground
[1:12:44] okay he's praying yeah
[1:12:47] father
[1:12:49] if there be any other way
[1:12:54] for me
[1:12:56] Mark 14 he said Abba Father all things
[1:12:59] are possible unto thee
[1:13:01] take away this cup from me
[1:13:05] he said God
[1:13:07] you can do anything
[1:13:09] you're God
[1:13:13] you can do anything
[1:13:15] there could be another way
[1:13:19] don't make me drink this cup
[1:13:22] you're God
[1:13:24] you can do anything
[1:13:29] please I just got past for me
[1:13:33] and he gets up and he goes to his
[1:13:36] disciples
[1:13:38] where does he find him
[1:13:41] sleeping
[1:13:45] and he goes to Peter
[1:13:47] she said Peter
[1:13:49] wake up
[1:13:51] wake up Peter
[1:13:53] Peter just
[1:13:57] master
[1:14:01] what's wrong master
[1:14:04] I've never seen you like you're shaking
[1:14:08] I've seen you walk on water
[1:14:11] I've seen you raise the Dead
[1:14:13] I've seen you pray for
[1:14:18] I've seen you feed five thousand with
[1:14:20] the little boy's lunch
[1:14:24] I seen you walk on water
[1:14:26] but I never
[1:14:29] is that blood
[1:14:31] are you bleeding
[1:14:34] you're bleeding
[1:14:36] oh God
[1:14:37] Jesus said Peter
[1:14:41] Peter
[1:14:44] pray with me Peter
[1:14:46] much
[1:14:57] what do you want me to pray
[1:15:02] he goes back
[1:15:04] this time
[1:15:07] his brother being brought it out so well
[1:15:09] last night he prostrates itself to the
[1:15:10] ground
[1:15:15] father
[1:15:19] he went away the Bible says the second
[1:15:20] time praying he said oh Father
[1:15:25] if this gun may not pass away from me
[1:15:27] except I drink it
[1:15:32] thy will
[1:15:34] be done
[1:15:38] no you're asking for God's will in your
[1:15:40] life
[1:15:41] you're asking
[1:15:43] for a great thing
[1:15:47] because sometimes he'll bring a great
[1:15:48] trial to your family
[1:15:51] so that others can be helped
[1:15:54] right amen
[1:15:56] if there'd be no other way except I'd
[1:15:59] drink this cup Lord
[1:16:05] I will
[1:16:06] be done
[1:16:08] and the prophet said a conference was
[1:16:10] called
[1:16:12] he said Gabriel come down with that
[1:16:14] great sword wormwood came down other
[1:16:17] Angels Came Down sat around the rocks
[1:16:19] and here come that
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:23] fill our fire
[1:16:26] hanging over his head
[1:16:28] and the angels are all watching
[1:16:31] what will be said
[1:16:33] what will be done In This Moment
[1:16:38] and the father begin to speak
[1:16:41] and the prophet said he said are you
[1:16:42] willing
[1:16:45] are you willing
[1:16:47] I can take you right now without Calvary
[1:16:49] you can go with me right now and let me
[1:16:53] say he could have because he was the
[1:16:55] sinless one
[1:16:58] I can take you right now with me
[1:17:03] are you willing
[1:17:05] is your love for the Brethren great
[1:17:07] enough
[1:17:09] is your love for that sinful stinking
[1:17:12] world that you were born in
[1:17:14] do you love them enough to forfeit your
[1:17:16] life do you love them enough to take
[1:17:18] their place
[1:17:21] to Bear their sins to the hardest
[1:17:24] cruelest death
[1:17:27] they will cut you to pieces
[1:17:29] they will drain every drop of blood from
[1:17:33] your body
[1:17:37] the prophecy there could be nothing thou
[1:17:39] that kind of death but him
[1:17:41] he could die of that kind of death but
[1:17:43] him and then that Comfort such a
[1:17:45] decision was made until the blood
[1:17:46] dropped from his brown he was under a
[1:17:48] strain and the sins of the world was
[1:17:50] upon him my sins
[1:17:52] my sins was upon him your sins was upon
[1:17:56] him
[1:17:59] Hallelujah
[1:18:06] Prophet said can you have that decision
[1:18:07] in your heart this morning
[1:18:09] can you forfeit that little filthy life
[1:18:11] of yours are you willing to look into
[1:18:13] his face and say not my will I'm a
[1:18:16] drunkard but I'll drink no more I'm a
[1:18:18] gambler but I'll gamble no more I'm
[1:18:20] immoral but I'll not be that way no more
[1:18:22] I'm a liar but I'll stop it today I'm a
[1:18:25] foul person but in this conference this
[1:18:27] morning I'll look into your face and
[1:18:29] I'll take like my master who died for me
[1:18:31] to make my way clear and I will say to
[1:18:34] him this morning not my will
[1:18:38] you will be done
[1:18:44] and after this conference with the
[1:18:47] father
[1:18:48] then guess who showed up
[1:18:50] Satan
[1:18:53] Satan began to talk to him just like he
[1:18:56] talks to you after you've had your
[1:18:58] conference
[1:18:59] with God
[1:19:02] oh you'll get a good blessing and you
[1:19:04] won't even pull out that road out there
[1:19:05] until the devil tell you you didn't get
[1:19:07] nothing
[1:19:09] somebody needs to tell the devil to sit
[1:19:11] down and shut up
[1:19:19] we don't we don't use that language
[1:19:21] around here we we teach our kids not to
[1:19:23] say shut up well then tell him to hush
[1:19:25] tell him something
[1:19:28] I don't ever understand what we let the
[1:19:30] devil do all the talking
[1:19:33] people come up in prayer and say the
[1:19:35] devil said this and the devil said that
[1:19:37] and the devil said this and the first
[1:19:39] thing I'm thinking is why do you listen
[1:19:40] to him you know he's a liar
[1:19:43] they can tell you everything the devil
[1:19:45] told them and they can't give you two
[1:19:46] good quotes that can't give you one good
[1:19:48] Bible scripture but they know everything
[1:19:50] the devil said somebody needs to tell
[1:19:52] him hush boy you're defeated

[1:19:58] your back of calvary
[1:20:04] the Here Comes Satan
[1:20:08] Satan with his poison breath
[1:20:11] he began to hiss like a serpent
[1:20:16] he began to say to our Lord the burden
[1:20:22] that you must carry
[1:20:24] far
[1:20:30] is it fair
[1:20:32] that you should pay
[1:20:35] for their sins
[1:20:37] you never drink you never lied
[1:20:40] you never lived immoral is it really
[1:20:43] fair that you should pay the price
[1:20:46] for their sins
[1:20:51] he's asking too much of you
[1:20:55] save yourself you can
[1:21:00] see he he saved himself
[1:21:07] he could save me
[1:21:11] yeah come on

[1:21:24] technology and artificial intelligence

[1:21:30] the calvary happened
[1:21:34] do you think they'll even acknowledge it
[1:21:36] by like the terrible devil this morning
[1:21:39] here in Hardy Arkansas there's a group
[1:21:41] of people that still cares
[1:21:44] there's a group of people that wants to
[1:21:46] say thank you Father thank you for

[1:22:13] a Hallelujah and an amen and I thank you
[1:22:16] Jesus

[1:22:24] thousand times for what he did for
[1:22:26] Jessica but if I live another 10 years I
[1:22:29] guess I'll thank him another ten
[1:22:31] thousand times because I can't hold
[1:22:33] Hallelujah every time I see her get up
[1:22:35] in the morning and come walking down the
[1:22:37] steps and I see her pick up a spoon I
[1:22:39] thank my God he opens eyes of the blood
[1:22:42] Hallelujah and he takes those in a
[1:22:44] wheelchair and makes him walk again and

[1:22:49] morning
[1:22:50] [Applause]
[1:22:53] come on
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:23:03] Prophet said there was a time
[1:23:05] after a perfect life of 33 and a half
[1:23:08] years had been lived a man
[1:23:12] say I want you to understand this he saw
[1:23:15] brother he was anointed no no no the
[1:23:17] anointing left him in the garden
[1:23:19] he did not go to Calgary with a halo
[1:23:22] over his head he did not go to Calvary
[1:23:24] with a pillar of fire over his head he
[1:23:26] went to Calgary as the man the Bible
[1:23:28] said who in the days of his flesh not
[1:23:31] his anointing his flesh
[1:23:39] wanted to live
[1:23:40] as much as you and I want to live this
[1:23:42] morning
[1:23:44] a man who had something to live for
[1:23:47] he loved he loved the people he loved
[1:23:50] his disciples that sat around the
[1:23:52] campfire like we was doing yesterday at
[1:23:54] the restaurant just the time of
[1:23:55] Fellowship sitting around you know
[1:23:56] talking and laughing and just enjoying
[1:23:59] laughing he'd say Peter tell me a good
[1:24:01] fishing story Peter who don't like a
[1:24:02] good fishing story and I say Peter has
[1:24:04] some good news
[1:24:07] and they sit around and tell a big fish
[1:24:09] story oh they just laugh and slap each
[1:24:11] other and as I was laughing
[1:24:13] he would look upon their faces
[1:24:16] he would realize
[1:24:19] it's the only way
[1:24:20] the only way
[1:24:22] that they can live
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:27] is I have to die
[1:24:29] it's the only way for the deal there's
[1:24:31] no other way
[1:24:36] probably said he loves sunsets
[1:24:38] he realized the only way his disciples
[1:24:40] could live the only way we could live
[1:24:42] was for him to die
[1:24:46] remember he spoke it in Prophecy he said
[1:24:48] hello all the world see me no more but
[1:24:50] ye shall see me because I live
[1:24:55] you shall live also
[1:24:59] he was the only man he was the only one
[1:25:02] who could fulfill that
[1:25:06] you see if he didn't do that that
[1:25:08] scripture would go
[1:25:10] unfulfilled
[1:25:13] no Organization no denomination no Pope
[1:25:16] no pastor
[1:25:20] it has
[1:25:22] to be healed
[1:25:24] he realized the only way they could ever
[1:25:27] gather together again as brothers
[1:25:32] was for him to die
[1:25:34] and to resurrect
[1:25:36] so they could follow
[1:25:38] in his steps
[1:25:43] Jesus
[1:25:44] father speaking to him now Satan and all
[1:25:47] this going on
[1:25:49] blood sweaters
[1:25:51] blood Fallen to
[1:25:57] the moment this momentous decision
[1:26:00] the Angels was waiting all he had to do
[1:26:02] was move a finger all he had to do was
[1:26:04] say I can't do it it's too great they
[1:26:07] would have turned the world upside down
[1:26:12] but they're in that moment of time
[1:26:15] when all this was going through and he
[1:26:17] was wrestling and out with his will
[1:26:21] he cries out
[1:26:24] not my will
[1:26:27] let the high will be done
[1:26:29] pretty steps
[1:26:31] to the will
[1:26:33] of the father
[1:26:34] and they come
[1:26:36] and arrest him
[1:26:38] all not long
[1:26:41] without water
[1:26:43] without food
[1:26:45] without rest
[1:26:47] they try him
[1:26:50] and they mock you
[1:26:53] and they slap him
[1:26:57] they took him from palatal
[1:27:00] and they tied him to a whipping post
[1:27:04] and they took these rods and they began
[1:27:06] to beat him across his naked back
[1:27:09] and those rods broke up the capillaries
[1:27:11] in his skin
[1:27:13] till it become bruised like brother Bo's
[1:27:15] foot bruised
[1:27:17] and then they took the Canon tail whip
[1:27:21] him on the back and those pieces of
[1:27:24] glass and pieces of bone and when they
[1:27:26] ripped it back like that it ripped his
[1:27:28] skin open and because the capillaries
[1:27:30] were all busted up the blood gushed from
[1:27:33] his back
[1:27:39] they beat him until they had to take
[1:27:41] turns
[1:27:42] because they got so tired
[1:27:49] you can see his kidneys
[1:27:52] through the wounds
[1:27:54] that was in his back
[1:27:58] stripe at the stripe
[1:28:01] after strife
[1:28:09] but the Bible says
[1:28:12] for the joy set before him
[1:28:16] he endured
[1:28:18] the cross
[1:28:23] Joy
[1:28:25] that's Joy
[1:28:32] Joy
[1:28:33] was eating that barbecue last night that
[1:28:35] was drill Joy
[1:28:38] Joy
[1:28:40] for the joy brother window
[1:28:43] what was on his mind
[1:28:45] what was he thinking as they whipped him
[1:28:48] at the whipping post
[1:28:52] prophet of God said that garment the
[1:28:55] blood from his body it just become one
[1:28:57] bloody garment slapping against his legs
[1:29:01] he made his way up Calvary
[1:29:04] and they throwed him down on the ground
[1:29:06] and they took this arm and they
[1:29:07] stretched it way back up and they nailed
[1:29:10] it to the tree and I took this one and I
[1:29:12] stretched it way back up
[1:29:14] and they nailed it to the tree and then
[1:29:17] they took his legs and crossed them and
[1:29:18] pushed them up on a platform
[1:29:20] and drove the nails to his feet
[1:29:24] and then they took ropes
[1:29:26] and they lifted him
[1:29:31] when it got so high
[1:29:33] he went
[1:29:35] and when it did Brother Bo
[1:29:38] off his bones
[1:29:40] come out of joint
[1:29:42] his shoulders dislocated
[1:29:46] his hips
[1:29:49] oh God
[1:29:50] I've been in surgery I've assisted
[1:29:53] doctors for years in surgery when I was
[1:29:54] a young man I've seen people come in
[1:29:56] with dislocated hips it's one of the
[1:29:58] most painful things you can ever
[1:30:00] experience
[1:30:02] and not one brother Davis
[1:30:04] both of his brother Colby
[1:30:07] and those at all all my bones
[1:30:10] I have a joint
[1:30:13] s
[1:30:14] they laugh at me
[1:30:16] they make fun of me
[1:30:19] they gave up on me with their mouths
[1:30:23] that's about me like dogs
[1:30:31] oh Jesus
[1:30:34] he was cut to pieces
[1:30:37] the Bible said his face was disfigured
[1:30:40] more than any man's face before you
[1:30:48] image
[1:30:52] oh I know Hollywood puts a little
[1:30:54] trickle of blood running down his face
[1:30:56] no my brother my sister
[1:31:01] his face was marked more than any man's
[1:31:03] face had ever been marked because
[1:31:06] remember Rome know how to crucify they
[1:31:09] knew oh my they knew how to bring the
[1:31:11] utmost punishment
[1:31:13] and they were crucified on the street
[1:31:15] out on the road so that when people
[1:31:17] passing through
[1:31:19] right they could see if this is what you
[1:31:21] do to Rome if this is what you do this
[1:31:23] is what happens if you come against Rome
[1:31:34] with his arms stretched out
[1:31:37] stretch the diaphragm
[1:31:41] and he smothered
[1:31:43] couldn't breathe
[1:31:45] so
[1:31:47] he would have to
[1:31:48] push up on the cross
[1:31:52] and when he pushed up it would relax his
[1:31:54] lungs
[1:31:55] and he could breathe
[1:31:57] he goes
[1:32:04] you go back down
[1:32:07] smother
[1:32:09] his mother
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:15] laughs
[1:32:17] cut that down
[1:32:21] I said he was a man he died on Calvary
[1:32:23] for sacrifice bleeding and the blood
[1:32:25] running out of him like a mortal spit
[1:32:27] hanging all over his beard he was a man
[1:32:28] disgraced hanging in shame taking that
[1:32:32] place
[1:32:33] he was a man and when the pain got so
[1:32:37] great
[1:32:38] think about it
[1:32:40] when the pain got so great he cried out
[1:32:49] Eli

[1:33:59] a curse hanging on a tree
[1:34:02] oh geez
[1:34:05] everything for sucking
[1:34:08] the creation that he created the moon
[1:34:12] the stars the sun everything blotted out
[1:34:14] man God nature everything forsook him
[1:34:18] nothing standing there he he died
[1:34:21] alone
[1:34:26] listen to me say to God there might have
[1:34:28] been days you felt so all alone there
[1:34:31] might have been days that you think I
[1:34:33] can't take another moment
[1:34:34] days when you felt no one cared for you
[1:34:37] no one loved you
[1:34:38] I guess all of uses have those kind of
[1:34:41] days
[1:34:41] but let me say to you this morning the
[1:34:44] worst day of our life has never been
[1:34:46] like this day
[1:34:49] has the stars ever forsaken us has the
[1:34:52] moon ever refused to sign for us has the
[1:34:56] sun ever refused to give its light
[1:35:00] but it did you
[1:35:02] God ever one time forsook us he said he
[1:35:06] wasn't by the window
[1:35:07] I'll never leave thee nor will I forsake
[1:35:10] thee no matter what we face in life we
[1:35:13] do not face it alone
[1:35:16] but he did he Wicked the calvary alone
[1:35:20] everything for sure
[1:35:30] what was he thinking
[1:35:33] how was he bearing the pain
[1:35:37] he labored
[1:35:40] so we could rest
[1:35:42] he suffered
[1:35:44] so we could be healed
[1:35:46] he died so he could live
[1:35:49] he was forsaken
[1:35:51] and you and I could have this promise
[1:35:54] I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[1:35:59] he pushed
[1:36:01] upon the cross
[1:36:05] is my tongue he cleaveeth to my jaw
[1:36:10] you see there's a condition known as
[1:36:13] hypovolemic shock
[1:36:15] and hypovolemic shock is when your body
[1:36:18] loses so much fluid
[1:36:21] that the fluid that you have will go to
[1:36:23] the vital organs
[1:36:24] to keep you alive
[1:36:26] to go to your kidneys and to your liver
[1:36:28] into your heart into your brain
[1:36:31] it's the same thing when you brother son
[1:36:33] that's why we get cold in the morning
[1:36:34] our toes and our fingers because the
[1:36:36] heat of your body the core heat will go
[1:36:38] to the core of your body to keep you
[1:36:40] warm that's why our fingers and toes get
[1:36:42] cold and it's the same principle
[1:36:45] he lost so much fluid that the fluid
[1:36:47] went to keep them because you see he had
[1:36:49] life
[1:36:50] God gave him life like he gave us life
[1:36:57] and the fluid goes to keep the vital
[1:36:59] organs alive
[1:37:00] and his tongue his mouth was so dry
[1:37:03] and his tongue actually cleaved
[1:37:10] pushed up on the cross
[1:37:19] first
[1:37:23] I'm thirsty
[1:37:27] thirsty
[1:37:31] his body was dying
[1:37:34] and they ran and got vinegar on a sponge
[1:37:36] and they tried to give him a drink but
[1:37:37] he refused it
[1:37:39] oh my
[1:37:42] God the Bible said for the joy
[1:37:45] for him
[1:37:47] what Joy
[1:37:51] why was he willing to pay such a prize
[1:38:01] why was he willing to place the surprise
[1:38:05] I'm ready for somebody like me
[1:38:10] who am I
[1:38:11] that a king would bleed
[1:38:17] glory to God
[1:38:20] they not in the yard I gotta watch this
[1:38:23] shooting stars
[1:38:26] and I just raised my hands and I began
[1:38:29] to cry out
[1:38:30] I didn't care who hurt me
[1:38:33] I begin to cry out How Great Thou Art
[1:38:38] that I got to think
[1:38:42] Assad says there's billions and billions
[1:38:46] of stars
[1:38:48] and thousands upon thousands of galaxies
[1:38:51] that we've never even seen that they say
[1:38:53] exist
[1:38:55] and yet the Bible says our God created
[1:38:59] them all
[1:39:01] Bible says he knows every Star
[1:39:06] by name
[1:39:09] that God so great
[1:39:20] we've got to be someone like me
[1:39:25] you say before there was a world

[1:41:33] he endured the shame the rejection the
[1:41:36] humiliation the pain the suffering
[1:41:42] Joy
[1:41:43] for the joy of hearing the shout of
[1:41:47] victory

[1:42:28] nonsense I'm not talking about a bunch

[1:42:31] loving to love him just talking about
[1:42:33] thanking him oh Hallelujah rejoicing for
[1:42:36] what he's done for me rejoicing but what
[1:42:39] has he ever done anything for you that
[1:42:41] in case you say thank you Jesus
[1:42:47] thank you
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:52] to hear the shout of Victory we are not
[1:42:56] a defeated people we are not a people
[1:42:58] that's been overcome Hallelujah We Are
[1:43:01] Victorious look at the back of the book
[1:43:04] we win
[1:43:05] [Applause]
[1:43:13] you know
[1:43:15] I think it's Florida
[1:43:17] I think I heard brother Andrew say it
[1:43:18] one time I saw it myself
[1:43:21] I think it's the Florida if I remember
[1:43:22] right you go so many places there's an
[1:43:25] Air Force Base down there that flies
[1:43:26] these fighter jets and when them things
[1:43:28] come over they rattled teacups in the
[1:43:31] cabinet
[1:43:33] so the people in the community got the
[1:43:36] complaining over the noise
[1:43:39] ain't too much noise around here
[1:43:43] I can't even sleep we'll sleep at home
[1:43:50] but no I know I know there's a preacher
[1:43:52] preaching one time he looked back there
[1:43:54] and the man was sleeping
[1:43:56] and he told the dick and said hey wake
[1:43:58] that man up
[1:43:59] the Dicker said you put him to sleep you
[1:44:01] wake him up
[1:44:08] anyway that's a different
[1:44:11] made myself laugh
[1:44:16] I'd say I've been guilty of that myself
[1:44:18] a few times
[1:44:20] he said I just too much noise around
[1:44:22] here
[1:44:24] we can't even rest
[1:44:26] so the Air Force put up a big sign at
[1:44:28] the entrance
[1:44:29] and it says pardon the noise
[1:44:32] but it's the sound
[1:44:34] freedom
[1:44:40] and I like to tell the devil this
[1:44:42] morning part of the noise but it's the
[1:44:45] sound of freedom in the camp
[1:44:48] hallelujah hallelujah it is a sound of
[1:44:52] freedom I was once bound but I'm free I
[1:44:56] was once dead but I'm alive
[1:44:59] it is the sound of freedom
[1:45:05] Hallelujah
[1:45:07] there we go
[1:45:12] the joy that was set before him Is Us
[1:45:16] our Salvation is the prize that made it
[1:45:18] all worthwhile that's why he was willing
[1:45:20] to suffer the shame so that we could
[1:45:22] make it into his kingdom he endured the
[1:45:25] cross he endured the cross
[1:45:28] so that we could be given
[1:45:31] eternal life
[1:45:33] this is the joy that was set before him
[1:45:38] that he could share the possession with
[1:45:42] us because remember we're not we're not
[1:45:45] just heirs
[1:45:48] we're joiners
[1:45:51] you see the difference between an heir
[1:45:53] and a joiner
[1:45:55] is if our daddy dies here we go for the
[1:45:58] reading of the will he gives Andrew the
[1:46:00] Cadillac with a spinning hubcaps
[1:46:04] he gives Ben the farm
[1:46:07] he gives Joel the hotel Up in Vegas
[1:46:10] and he gives me a goat
[1:46:16] and I have to feed that goat hey while
[1:46:18] Andrew drives off in that Cadillac
[1:46:21] now I'm on air
[1:46:22] I'm an heir I got something for my daddy
[1:46:25] but I didn't get what they got
[1:46:27] and the next three family reunion
[1:46:29] they'll hear about it
[1:46:31] I didn't get one thing I'm an heir but
[1:46:33] you see he didn't just make us heirs he
[1:46:35] made us join us and the Joiner means
[1:46:37] they oh my God they share The Possession
[1:46:40] together
[1:46:42] it means that whatever the father gave
[1:46:44] Jesus that's what he gave you
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:49] he died so that we could share in this
[1:46:53] inheritance together
[1:46:56] The Thirst in his heart could not be
[1:46:59] filled with water from a spring
[1:47:02] the only thing that would satisfy that
[1:47:05] that's why he didn't drink the vinegar
[1:47:06] it wouldn't satisfy it
[1:47:08] that thirst the whole book
[1:47:11] it was beyond the thirst of the flesh
[1:47:13] that he was longing for
[1:47:18] sunder
[1:47:19] hunger that he was longed for
[1:47:22] was her Fellowship
[1:47:26] and on that Resurrection morning
[1:47:29] he came forth
[1:47:31] oh in the joy for the Fulfillment of the
[1:47:35] word
[1:47:38] because when he came forth on that
[1:47:39] Resurrection morning he fulfilled the
[1:47:41] prophecy that he spoke back in John
[1:47:44] when he said because I live
[1:47:46] because I live
[1:47:55] For Whom the son
[1:47:58] that's me free
[1:48:00] it's free
[1:48:01] indeed
[1:48:03] every person here this morning
[1:48:06] can look and live
[1:48:11] coming down brother Andrews go pray I
[1:48:13] don't want to take his time tonight
[1:48:18] upon the cross
[1:48:25] it
[1:48:28] is
[1:48:36] finished
[1:48:39] and when he said those words brother boo
[1:48:42] down in hell all the prison cells of
[1:48:46] hell
[1:48:47] at once begin to burst open
[1:48:54] [Music]
[1:48:57] and the one who was held
[1:49:00] in the prison House of lust held in the
[1:49:03] prison House of addiction held in the
[1:49:05] prison House of cancer held in the
[1:49:07] prison House of arthritis all those who
[1:49:09] were held they could go free
[1:49:17] if this was manifested the love of God
[1:49:19] towards us because God sent his only son
[1:49:22] his only begotten son
[1:49:24] into the world that we might live
[1:49:27] through here
[1:49:30] you thought I was worth saving
[1:49:32] so you came and changed my life you
[1:49:35] thought I was worth keeping so you
[1:49:37] cleaned me up inside you thought I was
[1:49:39] worth dying for
[1:49:41] so you sacrificed your life
[1:49:44] so I could be free
[1:49:46] so I could be whole so that I could tell
[1:49:48] Hardy Arkansas everyone I know
[1:49:51] he thought
[1:49:53] he thought I don't care what they think
[1:49:55] of me at Walmart
[1:49:57] I don't care what to come off somebody
[1:50:00] me and my wife went to Walmart here not
[1:50:02] long ago
[1:50:03] listen to me sisters I want to say
[1:50:05] something to you this morning
[1:50:07] I want to thank you for dressing modest
[1:50:10] and decent
[1:50:12] and like I
[1:50:18] he said brother
[1:50:19] the world thinks I'm so ugly
[1:50:23] but he thinks you're beautiful
[1:50:28] [Applause]
[1:50:30] there's a there's a girl with
[1:50:32] 15 different colored hair and a big ring
[1:50:35] through her nose
[1:50:38] Tony looked at my wife like she was
[1:50:40] crazy
[1:50:46] I was in Atlanta airport the other day
[1:50:48] and a guy came through the airport with
[1:50:50] a black cape from the top of his ears to
[1:50:52] his feet he was walking like Dracula
[1:50:55] and people was looking at him he's
[1:50:57] getting upset I thought what do you
[1:50:58] think
[1:51:01] I mean I'm eating Chick-fil-A and you
[1:51:03] just go
[1:51:08] I seen a guy have his entire head
[1:51:12] tattooed even the whites of his eyes
[1:51:18] and they think we're weird
[1:51:26] when he died
[1:51:27] so that we
[1:51:29] could be free
[1:51:33] you see he loved life
[1:51:37] the prophet said he loves sunsets
[1:51:40] he loved to sit around the campfire
[1:51:43] but he come to that realization the only
[1:51:46] way
[1:51:47] I could ever have this Fellowship again
[1:51:51] is I have to die
[1:51:54] you see Jesus
[1:51:56] I'm closer
[1:51:58] he never had but once to close
[1:52:01] but he never asked the father for a new
[1:52:03] suit
[1:52:05] oh my God
[1:52:07] how many do I have in my closet yeah
[1:52:11] he walked everywhere he went
[1:52:13] but brother Chris he never asked the
[1:52:15] father
[1:52:16] for a chariot
[1:52:18] one time you say Lord could you just
[1:52:21] give me a charity I could just make it
[1:52:23] down there this summer
[1:52:25] he never asked the father for a new suit
[1:52:28] he never asked the father for a chariot
[1:52:31] the Bible said he had no place to lay
[1:52:33] his head you know we did
[1:52:36] he never asked the father
[1:52:40] or a house
[1:52:43] but the only thing
[1:52:46] that he ever asked the father for the
[1:52:48] only thing that could satisfy that
[1:52:50] thirst
[1:52:53] was your fellowship
[1:52:58] he wanted to be one
[1:53:01] with you
[1:53:06] and for the joy
[1:53:08] have it our fellowship restored
[1:53:11] he endured the cross
[1:53:14] and said
[1:53:19] I was in Chi back Alaska I think I've
[1:53:21] told this before but it just comes on my
[1:53:22] mind it's one of those things you just
[1:53:24] never forget brother Wendell I know
[1:53:25] you've your brothers have experiences
[1:53:28] as a young girl came up in chivac Alaska

[1:53:39] drinking
[1:53:40] and I cannot stop drinking
[1:53:44] she said I've been through the non-step
[1:53:46] program three different times and I stay
[1:53:49] sober for a while and then I find myself
[1:53:52] drunk again
[1:53:54] she's like a little boy

[1:54:05] everything to quit drinking I cannot
[1:54:09] stop

[1:57:56] thank you Lord for bearing my shame
[1:58:00] thank you for bearing my sins Lord and
[1:58:04] remove them as far as the East is from
[1:58:06] the West that I could stand here this
[1:58:08] morning Lord and say I've never done it
[1:58:10] in the first place it's dropped beneath
[1:58:13] the bleach of your blood never to be
[1:58:14] remembered against us anymore
[1:58:16] and father I pray Lord
[1:58:19] if there'd be one here
[1:58:22] maybe they've drifted God oh God maybe
[1:58:25] they've let the things of the world and
[1:58:26] their problems get bigger than their God
[1:58:29] they've lost that feeling Lord
[1:58:32] they've lost that feeling towards you
[1:58:34] they just kind of go through the motions
[1:58:36] just wondering how much longer is it
[1:58:37] going to be for we can get out
[1:58:40] but Lord if Calvary spoke to him this
[1:58:43] morning I wonder if they'd be willing to
[1:58:45] lay that aside
[1:58:47] I'd be willing if they would be willing
[1:58:48] to do what you did that day of the
[1:58:50] garden when you prayed not my will
[1:58:53] but let thy will be done
[1:58:55] Lord let there be one here this morning
[1:58:58] who say father I want your will for my
[1:59:00] life Lord I've got these Ambitions to be
[1:59:03] this to be there to be something else
[1:59:05] but father today lord it's not what I
[1:59:07] want
[1:59:08] it's not what I
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:11] can do for me
[1:59:14] but it's what you've done for me Lord
[1:59:18] and if you're here this morning
[1:59:20] baby you've never accepted Christ as
[1:59:22] your savior maybe you've never heard it
[1:59:24] preached like this I I don't know I I
[1:59:26] ain't no kind of a Preacher friends
[1:59:29] but if somehow I convey to you how much
[1:59:31] he loves you and you can see that if he
[1:59:34] was the only person that was ever lost
[1:59:36] in Hardy Arkansas ever lost in the
[1:59:39] history of humanity
[1:59:41] he would have died for you
[1:59:43] but can you receive that kind of Love
[1:59:45] sometimes it's the hardest thing for
[1:59:47] people to do is to receive love but can
[1:59:50] you accept that someone loved you that
[1:59:52] much
[1:59:55] and I wonder if you would just raise
[1:59:57] your hand up to him and say father
[2:00:00] [Music]
[2:00:01] Lord I received that this morning
[2:00:05] God bless that hand all over the
[2:00:07] building if you're here and you've got
[2:00:09] code on the Lord
[2:00:11] why don't you just renew that Fellowship
[2:00:13] this morning
[2:00:14] do you see the joy you see the joy as
[2:00:18] you raise your hand to him as the tears
[2:00:21] run down your eyes
[2:00:23] I wonder if you don't look over at the
[2:00:24] angels and say it was worth it it was
[2:00:27] worth it to see them look at them look
[2:00:29] at them raising their heads look at them
[2:00:31] crying this morning look at them singing
[2:00:33] songs of praise
[2:00:35] for the joy
[2:00:38] he said because I live
[2:00:40] you shall live also
[2:00:43] Hallelujah
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:48] amen
[2:00:50] if you're here this morning
[2:00:54] how many has a need in their body
[2:01:01] either he stripes on his back for your
[2:01:04] healing
[2:01:06] I wonder this morning if you could just
[2:01:08] lay that problem down
[2:01:11] and take his healing just thank him for
[2:01:14] it
[2:01:16] you see here not long ago I was in a
[2:01:18] restaurant
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:20] and I asked the waitress for the bill
[2:01:21] and she said if there's nothing else the
[2:01:24] Bill's been paid for
[2:01:26] said someone saw you in here and they
[2:01:28] paid for your meal
[2:01:31] and I looked around I didn't see anyone
[2:01:34] now I could do one or two things I could
[2:01:36] have argued with her
[2:01:38] and I could have told her ma'am I don't
[2:01:40] see nobody in this restaurant that I
[2:01:41] know you must have the wrong table you
[2:01:43] must be talking about somebody else they
[2:01:45] ain't nobody paid my bill for me
[2:01:49] I could have sat there and argued tried
[2:01:51] to do it myself trying to pay it myself
[2:01:53] or
[2:01:54] I could accept the fact that someone
[2:01:56] bumped that steak for me
[2:02:00] and you know what I did I accepted that
[2:02:02] and I walked out with a belly full of
[2:02:05] steak and it's the same principle this
[2:02:07] morning
[2:02:08] the price has already been paid
[2:02:11] it's already been paid you can argue you
[2:02:14] can debate well I don't know if it's for
[2:02:15] me or not oh it's for you
[2:02:18] you can argue about it you can say oh oh
[2:02:20] it's just it's just or or you can accept
[2:02:22] what he did for you this morning and
[2:02:25] walk out that door free
[2:02:27] so here's what I want us to do this
[2:02:29] morning
[2:02:31] just lay hands on one another
[2:02:33] the Bible said these signs shall follow
[2:02:36] them that believe
[2:02:39] now listen to me

[2:02:45] you to pray for that person you got your
[2:02:46] hand on
[2:02:48] I want you to pray from the depths of
[2:02:50] your heart
[2:02:51] that they can receive that dead Calvary
[2:02:54] maybe it's your daughter your husband
[2:02:56] your wife your your brother your sister
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:03:01] in your prayer I'm not stand between
[2:03:03] them in an accident
