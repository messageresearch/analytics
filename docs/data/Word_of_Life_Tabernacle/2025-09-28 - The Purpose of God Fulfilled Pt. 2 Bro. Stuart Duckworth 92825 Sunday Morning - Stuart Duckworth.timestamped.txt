[56:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy those specials this
[56:09] morning? Let's give them another hand
[56:10] clap.
[56:12] Amen.
[56:14] And let's sing this song as we invite
[56:16] our uh pastor to come. I stand in awe of
[56:18] you. Amen.
[56:23] Keith and let's go ahead and stand
[56:25] together.
[56:27] Oh, I stand
[56:31] I stand
[56:33] in awe of you.
[56:36] I stand
[56:39] I stand in all of you.
[56:44] Holy God
[56:46] to whom
[56:48] all praise is due.
[56:52] I stand
[56:54] in awe
[56:56] of you once again. Oh, I stand
[57:02] I stand in all of you.
[57:08] I stand
[57:10] I stand in all of you.
[57:15] Holy God
[57:18] to whom
[57:20] all praise is due.
[57:23] I stand
[57:26] in awe. Can we lift our hands and
[57:28] worship him as we sing it again? Oh, I
[57:32] stand
[57:33] I stand
[57:35] in love you.
[57:39] I stand
[57:41] I stand
[57:43] in love you.
[57:46] Holy God to whom
[57:50] all praise is due. Oh I stand in awe of
[57:58] you. That sounds good. Can we sing it
[58:00] one more time? Oh, I stand.
[58:03] I stand. Oh, we're in awe of your
[58:06] presence today, Lord. Oh, I stand.
[58:11] I stand
[58:13] in awe of you.
[58:16] Holy God,
[58:19] to whom
[58:20] all praise is too.
[58:24] I stand in awe
[58:28] of you.
[58:31] Oh my, are you in awe of his presence
[58:33] today? So thankful for all the things
[58:36] that he's done in our lives. Amen. Just
[58:38] for a moment, I I'd like to u say thank
[58:42] you for bearing with me on not preaching
[58:44] much lately. I've uh had that dental
[58:47] surgery and then we've been gone and out
[58:49] of meetings. This month is really busy.
[58:51] I was in the meeting last night at
[58:52] Galina. I want to say that um they had a
[58:55] prayer line there last night and we were
[58:57] part of that and and uh I don't think
[58:59] they'd probably had one in 15 or 20
[59:01] years there at the church and it was
[59:02] such a blessing to see those people and
[59:05] they become a sister church to us and
[59:07] I'm very proud of brother Ben and the
[59:09] church there and and we're thankful for
[59:11] that and able to do that. And I wanted
[59:13] to come back this morning to do these
[59:15] baptisms. We've got a couple of uh of uh
[59:19] kids that want to be baptized this
[59:20] morning, young people, and they've given
[59:22] their heart to the Lord. And so, we're
[59:24] looking forward to that. It's an
[59:25] important step. The Bible says, "Repent
[59:28] and be baptized, every one of you, in
[59:29] the name of Jesus Christ, and you shall
[59:32] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." So,
[59:34] that's a promise to us. And so, we're
[59:37] going to do that right after the service
[59:38] this morning. And it's good to have each
[59:40] and every one of you with us. I think
[59:42] Andrew played every instrument up here
[59:44] this morning. So good to have you,
[59:46] buddy. I I know when you're at your home
[59:49] church, you work all the time. So, we
[59:50] hate to make you work here, but we sure
[59:52] do appreciate it. Something special
[59:54] about Brother Andrew on the organ. We
[59:56] love Brother Joe, but when Brother Joe's
[59:58] on call and things and Andrew's here,
[1:00:00] we're sure glad that he can play. And uh
[1:00:04] we've got uh Brandon and Charity Wood
[1:00:06] with us this morning. God bless you. We
[1:00:08] met last night actually
[1:00:11] briefly, but they were at the meetings
[1:00:14] last night. That's was a powerful
[1:00:16] service. We really enjoyed being part of
[1:00:18] that. And their little daughter, is it
[1:00:20] Graceland? Your daughter's name is
[1:00:21] Graceland. It's good to have you today.
[1:00:23] And they uh from West Plains and just
[1:00:25] recently uh found out about the message
[1:00:28] and things and been uh had come once
[1:00:31] before. And again, I apologize every
[1:00:33] time I come. Every time y'all come, I
[1:00:35] don't preach. But brother Stewart is a
[1:00:37] wonderful preacher and we just believe
[1:00:39] the Lord's going to use him this morning
[1:00:40] to speak to each and every heart. How
[1:00:43] many come expecting something from God
[1:00:45] today? Amen. So, we're glad to have you
[1:00:48] this morning and each one of you, if I
[1:00:50] have any other visitors here that I've
[1:00:51] missed, God bless you. We've got three
[1:00:53] or four families gone. Some of them are
[1:00:55] at the meetings, so let's be praying for
[1:00:57] them. But the Joel's up there and I'm
[1:00:59] actually going to be headed back this
[1:01:01] evening for some fellowship. And so
[1:01:03] we'll just pray for those on the roads.
[1:01:05] I wanted also, not to keep you standing,
[1:01:08] but we've been uh kind of quiet on the
[1:01:11] missions front lately. Uh we've got some
[1:01:15] work that we've been doing behind the
[1:01:17] scenes in Nepal and helping a church
[1:01:19] over there. It was my intention to go in
[1:01:22] November. If you've watched the news
[1:01:23] lately, Nepal's recently had a change in
[1:01:26] government and they've got a lot of
[1:01:27] stuff going on. on. So, would you pray
[1:01:29] with me that the will of the Lord would
[1:01:31] be done there if I'm able to go? I don't
[1:01:33] want to go in the middle of a situation.
[1:01:35] So, you be praying with me on that. And
[1:01:38] then, uh, in the spring, we're going to
[1:01:40] be going to Romania, the Lord willing. I
[1:01:42] don't know if you remember brother
[1:01:43] Cosman Stefen from Dallas. He was from
[1:01:46] Dallas, Texas, and he he's a Romanian uh
[1:01:49] by birth, and he came and spoke for us a
[1:01:52] couple of years ago. The Cosman has
[1:01:54] since moved to Romania and he called me
[1:01:56] the other day, wants us to come and hold
[1:01:58] a meeting for him there in Romania. So,
[1:02:00] we'll be looking forward to that. God's
[1:02:02] doing things and just want to let you
[1:02:04] know that because that's your uh
[1:02:06] finances and things that enable us to go
[1:02:08] and we're still doing all we can to see
[1:02:10] the message spread to every corner of
[1:02:12] the earth. And we believe when the last
[1:02:14] one comes in, we get to go home. I'm
[1:02:17] looking forward to going home. This
[1:02:19] world's getting worse and worse, but I'm
[1:02:21] looking forward to going home. Thank you
[1:02:23] for your patience with me this morning.
[1:02:24] As brother Stewart comes, I just want to
[1:02:26] worship the Lord for a moment. Let's
[1:02:27] sing that gratitude if you would.
[1:02:31] Amen. Are you grateful this morning?
[1:02:34] Let's just worship him a moment as
[1:02:35] brother Stewart would come.
[1:02:38] All my words fall short.
[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:02:44] I got nothing new.
[1:02:49] Singing now. How could I express?
[1:02:55] Oh my gratitude.
[1:02:59] Oh my. I could sing these songs
[1:03:07] as I often do.
[1:03:12] But every song must end. But you never
[1:03:17] do.
[1:03:18] And you never do.
[1:03:21] Hallelujah.
[1:03:23] Oh, so I'll throw up my hands and praise
[1:03:28] you again and again.
[1:03:33] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.

[1:07:07] Amen. Let's just bow our hearts before
[1:07:10] him.
[1:07:11] Oh precious Lord, we just thank you,
[1:07:14] Lord, for your your mighty presence.
[1:07:18] Lord, we believe this morning that
[1:07:19] you're the same yesterday, today, and
[1:07:21] forever. We we believe that you're a
[1:07:24] present help, Lord, in a time of need.
[1:07:26] And Lord, we've just come to this
[1:07:28] service now, Lord, to give our all, to
[1:07:30] give our all for Jesus this morning,
[1:07:33] Lord, to enter into your presence, Lord,
[1:07:35] to be able to draw, Lord, that which we
[1:07:37] would have need of, Lord. But not just
[1:07:39] that, Lord, but to worship you, Lord, to
[1:07:41] give you praise, to give you what's your
[1:07:43] due, Lord. And Lord, your prophet said
[1:07:45] if you'll worship him just a little bit,
[1:07:47] just see what he'll do. See how he'll
[1:07:50] come by. And so we we believe we've done
[1:07:53] that this morning, Lord. And may we just
[1:07:55] continue, Lord, to just to draw benefit
[1:07:58] from this service, Lord. We pray that
[1:08:00] you bless your people, Lord. You see
[1:08:02] every heart, every life. Lord, won't you
[1:08:04] come and minister, Lord? May the angels
[1:08:06] of God just come and minister to every
[1:08:08] heart, every life uh today, Lord. And
[1:08:11] just come and make me a a minister uh
[1:08:14] set my heart a flame this morning, Lord,
[1:08:17] with the power of God, with the spirit
[1:08:19] of God, Lord. Set your people a flame,
[1:08:21] Lord, with the word of the hour, Lord.
[1:08:23] And may it just burn in their hearts,
[1:08:25] Lord. Lord, we just love you today.
[1:08:27] We've come to this service, Lord. Have
[1:08:29] your way. Have your way in your word and
[1:08:31] in your people now. Have the
[1:08:32] preeminence. We give you this service in
[1:08:35] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:08:38] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[1:08:41] Amen. If we could, we'll just turn the
[1:08:43] scriptures to Matthew 3 and 1.
[1:08:52] Matthew 3:1. Just kind of the thought
[1:08:54] that we had the last time that we
[1:08:56] ministered, the fulfilled purpose of
[1:08:57] God. Just want to kind of pick that back
[1:09:00] up. and
[1:09:02] by God's grace this morning. Amen. Just
[1:09:04] good to see everyone and and just happy
[1:09:07] to be in the house of God. Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 3:1.
[1:09:13] In those days came John the Baptist
[1:09:16] preaching in the wilderness of Judea and
[1:09:19] saying, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of
[1:09:22] heaven is at hand. For this is he that
[1:09:26] was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah,
[1:09:29] saying, "The voice of one crying in the
[1:09:32] wilderness, prepare ye the way of the
[1:09:35] Lord, and make his paths straight."
[1:09:38] Amen. You can be seated this morning.
[1:09:45] Amen. Praise the Lord. We just
[1:09:47] appreciate his presence here today.
[1:09:49] Amen. And I'm sorry that you got to hear
[1:09:52] me this morning. And I just certainly
[1:09:55] wish brother Ben would have stepped in,
[1:09:56] but here we are. Amen. And
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and uh it's our turn. And so don't you
[1:10:04] appreciate our brother Ben and all he
[1:10:05] does. And I give him a hand clap,
[1:10:10] man. Preaches a lot. And if we can give
[1:10:12] him any kind of relief, then that's
[1:10:14] that's why we're here. Amen. Amen. We
[1:10:17] just want to look this morning at at the
[1:10:19] fulfilled purpose of God. Just as we
[1:10:21] said, a a thought that we' ministered on
[1:10:23] before. And and we look here at John the
[1:10:27] Baptist. We look at John's purpose and
[1:10:29] and his ministry. Such an interesting
[1:10:32] character in the Bible. Jesus said that
[1:10:36] there was no one greater, no prophet
[1:10:38] greater. John was the greatest. And
[1:10:41] John's, you know, purpose wasn't just to
[1:10:43] to prophesy of of of a coming Messiah,
[1:10:47] but he was to introduce the Messiah.
[1:10:50] Everything that the prophets had had had
[1:10:53] prophesied and and talked about here.
[1:10:55] Here here John was going to introduce
[1:10:58] that one that they had preached about,
[1:11:00] the one they had talked about.
[1:11:02] But here, just we want to just kind of
[1:11:04] talk about John just for a little bit.
[1:11:06] Amen. We can just relax this morning.
[1:11:08] I'm going to take my time and and just
[1:11:10] try to try to get our thought out here.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says in Luke 1:15 about
[1:11:16] John that he would be great in the sight
[1:11:18] of the Lord and that neither uh drink or
[1:11:23] wine or strong drink. He would he would
[1:11:25] drink neither wine nor strong drink, but
[1:11:27] that from his mother's womb he would be
[1:11:30] full of the Holy Ghost. Amen. There,
[1:11:34] brother Random talks about there as a
[1:11:36] baby dead in the womb of his mother
[1:11:38] heard the name of Jesus and he came to
[1:11:42] life there and the Bible says they're
[1:11:44] leaping for joy in his mother's womb.
[1:11:46] And I want to say this morning, amen,
[1:11:49] that there was power in that name then
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; and there's power in that name today.
[1:11:54] There's still power in that name here
[1:11:56] this morning. If it can cause a dead
[1:11:58] baby there lifeless in in a mother's
[1:12:01] womb, then just to hear the name of
[1:12:03] Jesus, what can it do this morning?
[1:12:05] Amen. Under under the understanding and
[1:12:07] the revelation that we have and the
[1:12:09] power of that name and what we've seen
[1:12:11] it done through the years and and the
[1:12:13] effects that it's had upon the people's
[1:12:15] lives and the and the enemy that it's
[1:12:17] drove back and the devils that it's
[1:12:19] defeated. Amen. I I still believe this
[1:12:21] morning that there's power in that name.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. If there ever was power in that
[1:12:26] name, there's power in that name this
[1:12:28] morning.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Power to raise the dead.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Power to heal the sick.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Power to change lives. And that that's
[1:12:37] really what we want this morning. That's
[1:12:39] what we want. That's what we want to
[1:12:40] preach about. That's what we want to
[1:12:42] talk about. That's what we want to
[1:12:44] project. And that's what we want to
[1:12:46] believe. Something that will come,
[1:12:48] something that can be preached,
[1:12:50] something that can be expressed to the
[1:12:51] people that can change their lives.
[1:12:53] Amen. Amen. A dead letter never did
[1:12:55] anybody no good. Amen. Just a just a
[1:12:58] little sermon at here and there never
[1:13:00] did nobody no good. But we want the
[1:13:02] anointed word, amen, that God has given
[1:13:04] in the in this hour to proceed forth.
[1:13:06] Amen. From the sacred desk, amen. That
[1:13:09] it can touch the hearts of the people.
[1:13:11] Amen. Amen. It's more than simply
[1:13:13] speaking the name of Jesus. Amen. But
[1:13:15] it's the word of God. Amen. That he
[1:13:17] himself has sent in this hour. Amen. By
[1:13:20] his voice. Amen. Not the voice of just a
[1:13:22] man. Amen. but his voice.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he said, "My sheep hear my
[1:13:27] voice, they know my voice, and a
[1:13:29] stranger they will not follow." Jesus
[1:13:31] said, "In my words," Amen. "And it's
[1:13:33] life." Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; So, that's what we want to project.
[1:13:39] Something that will change, something
[1:13:41] that will bring life. Amen. Amen. Is
[1:13:44] that not what we've received in this
[1:13:46] hour? Amen. We who were dead in sinned
[1:13:48] and trespasses. Amen. We were quickened,
[1:13:50] Amen. by the word of God. Amen. It
[1:13:53] wasn't just a It wasn't just man's idea.
[1:13:55] And we'll get into this a little bit
[1:13:56] later. It wasn't just a man's idea, but
[1:13:59] it was an anointed word for this day
[1:14:01] that God sent that would have would have
[1:14:03] a specific effect on a specific people.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; And that was John's purpose. That was he
[1:14:10] he was sent with a message from the
[1:14:12] scriptures to have a specific effect
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; upon the people of that day.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of the hour
[1:14:19] has done for you and I. It's not for
[1:14:21] everybody. It's not It's not for
[1:14:24] everybody, but it's sent to a a specific
[1:14:26] people.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[1:14:31] I've drank about four or five bottles of
[1:14:33] water. You think I wouldn't be thirsty?
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord this morning.
[1:14:43] We need something that's got power in
[1:14:45] it.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. And from the scripture, from
[1:14:48] the anointed word lays that power this
[1:14:51] morning.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not just in my thoughts or my
[1:14:54] ideas, but it's from the anointed word.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; We'll go on and talk about John.
[1:15:01] Bible says that he would be responsible
[1:15:04] for turning many of the children of
[1:15:06] Israel to the Lord their God. That was
[1:15:09] his ministry to turn their hearts. Amen.
[1:15:13] And and he would Amen. He would before
[1:15:15] him would he would go in the power and
[1:15:18] the spirit of Elijah. Does the Bible say
[1:15:20] that he would go in the power and the
[1:15:23] spirit of Elijah? Amen. God uses that
[1:15:26] spirit. We know five times in the Bible.
[1:15:29] Amen. There in Elijah and then and then
[1:15:31] that spirit came back upon Elisha. And
[1:15:35] then several hundred years later there
[1:15:36] there hadn't been a prophet in in
[1:15:38] several hundred years. But here God had
[1:15:41] a specific Amen. portion of his word
[1:15:44] that he was going to fulfill. And he
[1:15:46] would use the spirit of Elijah. He would
[1:15:49] use the spirit of Elijah on a man named
[1:15:51] John. Amen. Amen. The very spirit of
[1:15:54] Christ for a for a purpose, for a
[1:15:57] specific purpose. And he would send
[1:15:58] forth this spirit. Amen. To turn the
[1:16:01] hearts of the people. Amen. It would go
[1:16:04] in power and demonstration. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:06] It would be something, Amen. that would
[1:16:08] had life in it. It would be something
[1:16:10] that wouldn't just tickle the ears, but
[1:16:12] it would be something that would grab
[1:16:13] the attention of the believer of that
[1:16:16] day.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we needed. We needed
[1:16:19] something to grab our attention. Amen.
[1:16:22] Amen. Pentecost wouldn't work no more.
[1:16:25] The Baptist ideology wouldn't work no
[1:16:27] more. God had to give us something,
[1:16:29] amen, to to catch our attentions,
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; to change us.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And that's the purpose of the word.
[1:16:37] That's the purpose of the of the
[1:16:39] preaching of the gospel to change uh men
[1:16:42] and women. Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; To change our lives.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And then he would he would use that
[1:16:50] spirit upon Malachi 4. A prophet would
[1:16:54] come in this day, amen, to turn the
[1:16:56] hearts of the people. And then he'll use
[1:16:59] that spirit again. Amen. In an Elijah
[1:17:02] ministry to turn the hearts of Israel
[1:17:05] back to the Holy Ghost faith.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; So God uses that that that spirit.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; He He It comes in a time and a season.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And when it comes, it does what it's
[1:17:17] intended to do.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; It does not fail.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; But it it catches the attention of the
[1:17:23] people. God presents it in such a way to
[1:17:26] catch our attention. Amen. That's good.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, there he would go on that power in
[1:17:33] the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts
[1:17:36] of the fathers to the children. The
[1:17:39] disobedient, the Bible says, unto
[1:17:41] wisdom.
[1:17:43] And his ministry wasn't to to bring
[1:17:46] people to follow him, but to point them
[1:17:49] to one who was coming.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about John. It wasn't about
[1:17:55] what he could do. Come on.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; But his ministry was to point to to
[1:17:59] someone that was coming
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; on
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; that could help the people.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Someone that was coming that could have
[1:18:04] a greater effect even than his ministry.
[1:18:07] Even a greater effect than the spirit of
[1:18:08] Elijah. Oh, what a revelation we could
[1:18:11] draw from that this morning. What faith
[1:18:13] we could draw from that this morning.
[1:18:15] Amen. Let it go beyond the ministry of a
[1:18:17] prophet. Let it go beyond the ministry
[1:18:19] of Elijah to the one he pointed to.
[1:18:22] Amen.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I try not to get ahead of myself
[1:18:25] this morning.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. He came, Amen. to bring the
[1:18:31] disobedient unto wisdom. To not to not
[1:18:35] follow him, but to point them to one who
[1:18:37] was coming. To make ready, the Bible
[1:18:39] says to make the people ready.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And prepared not for himself, but for
[1:18:46] the Lord.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; That was his ministry to prepare the
[1:18:49] hearts of the people. for the Lord
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; to make them ready for the great one.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know I'm not much of a preacher,
[1:18:58] but I'm just I'll try my best today.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; John 1 and six. Look at this.
[1:19:09] And there was a man sent from God whose
[1:19:10] name was John. And the same came for a
[1:19:13] witness to bear witness of the light
[1:19:16] that all men through him might believe.
[1:19:20] Lord, thank you.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; It goes on and says, "He was not that
[1:19:23] light,
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; but he was sent to bear witness of that
[1:19:27] light." Oh, what a great responsibility
[1:19:30] to bear witness of the light. To be a
[1:19:33] man that's sent from God to Amen. to go
[1:19:36] to to what? To a place. Amen. There to
[1:19:39] be sent to go to a place appointed.
[1:19:41] Amen. So, he was appointed for a certain
[1:19:43] purpose. Amen. To be a messenger.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; To be an angel. To be a messenger. To be
[1:19:48] a witness. And you know, God, you know,
[1:19:50] God can speak to us through the
[1:19:52] supernatural. Hey, God, I believe God
[1:19:55] could come down and and speak through
[1:19:56] angels. He could he could he could speak
[1:19:58] from heaven, but you know, God has
[1:20:01] earthly angels. God has earthly
[1:20:03] messengers. You know, I I could hear
[1:20:05] something, you know, something random
[1:20:06] and and you may not think much about it,
[1:20:08] but if God anoints a man, there's just
[1:20:11] something about it. that God brings
[1:20:12] somebody, amen, and anoints them and
[1:20:14] they have a ministry from the scripture.
[1:20:16] Amen. It has a greater effect than maybe
[1:20:18] maybe just a voice, a random voice from
[1:20:20] somewhere. Amen. Somebody, amen, that
[1:20:22] you can touch, somebody that you can
[1:20:24] see. Amen. Sometime somebody that you
[1:20:26] can interact with on a day-to-day basis.
[1:20:28] Amen. And that's what John was there
[1:20:30] for. Amen. Amen. He came out of the
[1:20:32] wilderness. Amen. Amen. He was he was
[1:20:35] back there. Amen. He wasn't filled with
[1:20:36] man's ideas. He wasn't filled with
[1:20:38] theology. Amen. But he had been back
[1:20:40] there. Amen. Amen. Under the anointing,
[1:20:42] amen, of the spirit
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; to come out of the wilderness and have
[1:20:47] an effect upon the people.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And that's what we as Christians, that's
[1:20:53] what we as Christians, we've got to have
[1:20:55] an effect upon those around us rather
[1:20:58] than they have a greater effect upon us.
[1:21:00] Amen. Amen. We've got to stay shut in
[1:21:02] with God. You don't have to be a hermit
[1:21:04] and live on a mountain somewhere. Amen.
[1:21:06] But but live a life that's shut in with
[1:21:08] God. Amen. that you can go out and have
[1:21:11] an effect. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll be the only Bible that many
[1:21:16] people ever read.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; So, he was sent to be a messenger.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; A true witness,
[1:21:29] a witness to bear witness of the light.
[1:21:31] He was not that light, but was sent to
[1:21:34] bear witness of that life.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe John held true to
[1:21:39] that witness?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; You believe John held through true to
[1:21:43] that witness? I I believe that. I
[1:21:45] believe he was a true witness that that
[1:21:47] didn't point the people to himself, but
[1:21:48] he pointed them to the coming light,
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; to the coming one,
[1:21:56] but think of that that through him all
[1:22:01] men would believe. John's ministry has
[1:22:04] an effect upon you and I
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; even even as as as believers now. Amen.
[1:22:11] He was the one that would identify the
[1:22:13] lamb of God.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; He was the one that would identify that.
[1:22:17] So John had his part to play. Amen. And
[1:22:19] and through him all men would believe.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; What a ministry that was. What a great
[1:22:26] ministry that was that through him all
[1:22:29] men would believe.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He was born He was born for a purpose.
[1:22:35] He was born to identify the Messiah, to
[1:22:38] be a witness of the light.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was born to identify the lamb
[1:22:43] of God that would take away the sin of
[1:22:46] the world. That's a pretty important
[1:22:47] job, isn't it?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty important job. And I I
[1:22:50] think that, you know, if you got a
[1:22:52] pretty important job like that, I I
[1:22:54] believe in if if if God called you to be
[1:22:56] that, you're you're a man sent from God.
[1:22:59] I believe that God will will help you
[1:23:01] fulfill what your purpose is. Whatever
[1:23:04] your job is, I believe he'll help you
[1:23:06] fulfill that. And I believe with all my
[1:23:08] heart that John fulfilled his ministry,
[1:23:10] don't you? I believe that he done his
[1:23:12] part to to point to people, amen, to to
[1:23:15] the lamb of God. And we could say the
[1:23:17] thing, same thing about the Elijah
[1:23:19] prophet that came in this day. Amen. I
[1:23:21] believe with all my heart that he
[1:23:22] fulfilled his ministry, that he done his
[1:23:25] part. Amen. That there's nothing left
[1:23:27] undone. Do you believe that?
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't leave something
[1:23:31] halfway undone, but when God does
[1:23:34] something, he does it. Amen. And I
[1:23:36] believe in in this hour, we've got what
[1:23:38] we need. Amen. We've got to we've got
[1:23:40] what we need. We We've been We've been
[1:23:42] exposed, Amen. We've been exposed to a
[1:23:45] man sent from God. We've been exposed,
[1:23:48] Amen, to the light. One that bore
[1:23:50] witness of the light. And I believe the
[1:23:52] prophet in this hour, Amen, had a true
[1:23:54] representation,
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; of that light.
[1:23:58] And I believe he done everything
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; that he was called to do.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all my heart.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; What an important job that he had. What
[1:24:17] an important job that you have this
[1:24:18] morning.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be bearers of the light. To be
[1:24:23] witnesses of the light.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He is the light.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; He is the light.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; And don't let your don't let your light
[1:24:33] that he's given you be hid. Don't hide
[1:24:36] it under a bushel.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; But let it shine. Let it shine. Amen.
[1:24:40] For the glory of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:24:43] That's the purpose. That's your purpose
[1:24:44] in this hour of every Holy Ghost filled
[1:24:47] Christian is to be a light that someone
[1:24:50] might believe. Thank you.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I've got a friend that talked through to
[1:24:54] through the years and he's going to be
[1:24:56] baptized this morning. He's always just,
[1:24:59] you know, I you don't feel like much,
[1:25:01] but he's always regarded me as a man of
[1:25:03] God. I I'm nothing. But he tells me that
[1:25:07] and I tell him I appreciate that, but
[1:25:09] he's going to be baptized this morning
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; at a Baptist church.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; And I've been talking to him about
[1:25:15] baptism and the correct way. I said,
[1:25:17] "How are they going to baptize you?" and
[1:25:19] you know how they do.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; And we begin to talk and when I begin to
[1:25:23] show him scriptures and show him things
[1:25:25] in the Bible said, "Oh yeah, I see that.
[1:25:27] Acts 2:38." He said, "It's right there."
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; And and and I said, "Don't let him." He
[1:25:34] said, "I I believe that. I believe that
[1:25:36] that's the way you should be baptized."
[1:25:38] I explained to him, "What is the name of
[1:25:41] the Father and the Son and the Holy
[1:25:43] Ghost? What is that name?" Amen. What
[1:25:46] did Jesus tell? He didn't tell us to
[1:25:47] baptize in titles, but he said, "What is
[1:25:49] the baptize in the name?" And I asked
[1:25:51] him, "What is the name?" He, you know,
[1:25:53] and I said, "The Lord Jesus Christ."
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's salvation alone. Amen. Is
[1:25:59] that name? Amen. There's not another
[1:26:02] name given under heaven whereby men must
[1:26:04] be saved. And he said, "That's how I'm
[1:26:06] going to tell them that I want to be
[1:26:07] baptized. And if they won't do it, then
[1:26:09] then I won't be baptized." And so, he
[1:26:11] told me this morning, that's how they're
[1:26:13] going to baptize him. And I've seen
[1:26:15] video after video of them baptizing in
[1:26:17] the father, son, and holy ghost. But
[1:26:19] Amen. Amen. The little understanding
[1:26:21] that you feel like you have about the
[1:26:23] word, the word, Amen. can have such a
[1:26:26] positive effect. And that's why we're
[1:26:28] here is to have a positive effect. Will
[1:26:30] he ever come to believe the message? I
[1:26:32] don't know that. I I have I have no
[1:26:34] control over that. All you have control
[1:26:36] over is the influence that you have and
[1:26:38] the positivity. Amen. and the the light
[1:26:41] that we shed forth. Amen. The
[1:26:42] understanding that we have that that
[1:26:44] many people would would give their
[1:26:46] lives. They would give all their
[1:26:47] fortune. They would get everything they
[1:26:49] had to know what you know and to
[1:26:51] understand what you understand. Amen.
[1:26:54] But God sent you the light.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; God sent you the light. Amen. Be a be a
[1:26:58] witness of that light.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Shed forth a light. Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; If it's just talking about something
[1:27:05] simple as being baptized,
[1:27:08] many people don't understand. They don't
[1:27:09] know. They only know what people talk
[1:27:11] them in into.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram talks about John here. I
[1:27:24] love this.
[1:27:26] He said, "Brother, he didn't have on the
[1:27:28] tuxedo clothes.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't have his collar turned around,
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; but he had an old sheep skin draped
[1:27:35] around him. But he preached repentance.
[1:27:38] He preached Christ.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And though his simplicity had
[1:27:42] stirred all the regions around about, he
[1:27:44] said, "What we Baptist churches and all
[1:27:46] the rest of you need today is another
[1:27:48] John the Baptist."
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; He preached repentance. He preached
[1:27:52] Jesus Christ.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; He preached Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he preached Amen. And he said,
[1:27:58] "Though in its simplicity had draws
[1:28:02] in." And he goes on, he says, "The power
[1:28:04] of God has been the greatest drawing
[1:28:06] card the world has ever had." He said,
[1:28:08] "There he come preaching how marvelous
[1:28:09] and how wonderful, what a real man of
[1:28:12] man of God and a manifestation he was."
[1:28:14] And he preached and then Christ came on
[1:28:16] the scene.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when John preached, he didn't
[1:28:20] preach himself.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't preach about himself. Amen.
[1:28:23] When John preached, he preached the
[1:28:25] kingdom of God of heaven is at hand. The
[1:28:27] the kingdom of God is at hand. He
[1:28:29] preached that something is coming. Amen.
[1:28:31] He preached that someone is coming.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Someone is coming that will change
[1:28:35] the world forever. Someone is coming.
[1:28:38] Amen. Greater than me. I can baptize
[1:28:41] you. I I can talk to you about it. But
[1:28:43] there's somebody coming.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't preach himself. He
[1:28:47] preached get ready. He preached confess
[1:28:49] your sins. He preached someone is
[1:28:51] coming. Amen. He preached Jesus Christ.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

[1:29:33] religion like that. Amen. Amen. Not a
[1:29:35] dead religion, but something that's got

[1:29:59] you to be.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; What God ordained you to be,

[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; come on, preach. what this religion
[1:30:16] says, but what God in his mind ordained
[1:30:21] you to be.

[1:30:27] turn over a new leaf.

[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; We We even ourselves, we can try
[1:30:30] ourselves.

[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; But you'll fail and you'll fail and
[1:30:34] you'll fail until you come in contact
[1:30:37] just like Moses did. Moses was the
[1:30:39] biggest failure. Moses was the biggest
[1:30:42] failure. had all the learning, had all
[1:30:43] the education to know how to go and
[1:30:45] defeat armies, defeat nations and to
[1:30:48] bring back the spoils, but he couldn't
[1:30:51] deliver his own people. He couldn't do
[1:30:53] what God actually God called him to do.
[1:30:56] But when he come in contact, when he
[1:30:58] come in contact with that light, when he
[1:31:01] come in contact with the pillar of fire,
[1:31:04] Amen, he could never be the same. He

[1:31:13] something that would help him carry out
[1:31:15] the task

[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] Come in contact
[1:31:28] five minutes
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; in that presence
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; will give you the courage
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; to overcome every devil
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; that is attacking you. That's right.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Just a moment even
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; in that presence can change you from
[1:31:44] what you were
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; to what God has called you to be.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Just a moment.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Just a moment
[1:31:53] in that holy presence. Amen. Can give
[1:31:56] you the faith, give you the courage.
[1:31:58] There Moses
[1:32:02] stick
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; stick in his hand. Where you going,
[1:32:05] Moses? I'm going to take over.

[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Of God.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you,
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a power the gospel has.
[1:32:26] What a power to change somebody's life.
[1:32:30] Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The problem the world has isn't a
[1:32:34] political problem.
[1:32:36] It isn't educational.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; It isn't whether you're black or white.
[1:32:41] It isn't race or ethnicity.
[1:32:44] The world has a sin problem.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; You and I had a sin problem.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; The world has a heart problem.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And until the heart is changed, men are
[1:32:55] capable of the worst things that you can
[1:32:58] imagine. They're capable of anything, of
[1:33:01] any horrible act. And we and when you
[1:33:04] take God out of the home,
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; when you take God out of the school,
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; when you take God's word and you put it
[1:33:11] on the shelf, when when you when the
[1:33:13] blood isn't applied, what happened in
[1:33:16] Israel or in Goan rather, the children
[1:33:18] of Israel, when the blood was applied,
[1:33:20] the death angel passed. When you take
[1:33:23] away a blood gospel, it invites the
[1:33:26] death angel. It invites the death of
[1:33:28] Leodysia. It invites complacency. It
[1:33:31] invites lukewarmness. Watch and destroy
[1:33:34] your life. Amen. Amen. But we've got to
[1:33:36] discern and withstand that antichrist
[1:33:39] spirit brother talked about. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:41] And the only thing Amen. The only thing
[1:33:43] that's going to drive away the enemy is
[1:33:45] a blood religion. Is a blood faith.
[1:33:48] Amen. Amen. Something that's got life in
[1:33:50] him. I believe that with all my heart
[1:33:52] this morning that it's a Holy Ghost
[1:33:54] bloodfilled gospel. Amen. That will
[1:33:56] change our young people. That will
[1:33:58] change, Amen, the world. Amen. That's
[1:34:00] the only thing that will change a
[1:34:02] corrupted heart. You can't educate
[1:34:04] nobody into it. Amen. But it's a blood
[1:34:06] gospel. Amen. That's got to be preached.
[1:34:08] It's got to be heard. It's got to be
[1:34:10] accepted. What the problem of it is,
[1:34:13] Amen. It's too oldfashioned anymore.
[1:34:15] Amen. John the Baptist preaching is just
[1:34:18] too old-fashioned anymore. Nobody wants
[1:34:20] to hear it. Nobody wants to come under
[1:34:22] it. Amen. But that's what'll change you.
[1:34:24] Amen. That's what that it'll burn that
[1:34:26] out of you.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:34:29] Yes, sir.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; It'll change your heart.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. That ministry was to turn the
[1:34:34] hearts of the people
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; back to God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; They come under no doubt. John wasn't
[1:34:42] going around talking in a in a low
[1:34:45] voice.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; I can imagine he's yelling louder and
[1:34:49] screaming louder than I am. He had been
[1:34:53] on the earth for 30 or so years. 30
[1:34:56] years, but he only had 6 months to work.
[1:34:59] You think he's going to go around
[1:35:01] haphazard?
[1:35:03] He went with a purpose. He preached with
[1:35:05] a purpose. Amen. Let Let us live with a
[1:35:07] purpose. We've we've we've not gotten
[1:35:09] much longer down here. Let's live with a
[1:35:11] purpose. Amen. Amen. Let's Let's shine
[1:35:13] forth the light of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:35:15] While we're here, let's work. Amen.
[1:35:17] While it's day, for the night is coming.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:21] Thank you, Lord.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; The world's got a heart problem.
[1:35:27] The Leodysian age, this Leoian age shuts
[1:35:31] him out completely to where he's on the
[1:35:34] outside of the door knocking trying to
[1:35:36] get back in. Amen. He's shut out, but he
[1:35:40] still knocks at the door.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; You imagine kicking somebody out of your
[1:35:44] house.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody that could help you,
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; somebody that could change your life.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; They could give you whatever you needed.
[1:35:54] Not wanted. They could give you whatever
[1:35:56] you needed. And you shut that person
[1:35:58] out. You kick them out. But yet that
[1:36:01] person is still on the door knocking,
[1:36:04] trying to get back in. That's our Lord
[1:36:06] Jesus in this age. That's the
[1:36:08] description of this age. Though they
[1:36:10] shut him out, he's still on the door
[1:36:12] knocking, trying to get back in, asking,
[1:36:15] Amen, to come in and make them what they
[1:36:17] were ordained to be as men and as women.
[1:36:20] Amen. To to to raise them up, to redeem
[1:36:22] them up, amen, from what Satan has has
[1:36:24] has brought them down to to redeem them,
[1:36:27] to bring them back, Amen. Amen. to their
[1:36:29] original estate. Amen. He's able to do
[1:36:31] that this morning. Do you believe that?
[1:36:34] He's able to take us from the filth.
[1:36:36] He's able to take us from the low of the
[1:36:38] low. Amen. You thought you couldn't get
[1:36:40] any lower. You thought you couldn't be
[1:36:41] any worse of a human being. But even in
[1:36:44] that condition, Amen. There's a
[1:36:45] redeeming power. There's a redeeming
[1:36:47] love. Amen. Amen. And it was brought to
[1:36:50] you by the blood, the Holy Ghost gospel,
[1:36:52] the Holy Ghost blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:36:55] Amen. That power, Amen. was brought to
[1:36:57] you and I
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; to redeem us up, to bring us up.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning?
[1:37:04] I'm just preaching.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:37:14] He still knocks at the
[1:37:18] at the heart this morning to take the
[1:37:21] callous the callous over heart
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; of stone and make it soft and open to
[1:37:28] the effects of the gospel. Do you
[1:37:30] believe that this morning?
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; John John preached repent.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; He did. He preached the kingdom of
[1:37:38] heaven is at hand. He preached prepare
[1:37:41] yourselves and there you know there he
[1:37:43] come clothed and camel's hair.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Had a leather belt.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; It was It wasn't no fake leather. A
[1:37:55] genuine He had genuine leather. It was
[1:37:58] genuine leather.
[1:38:00] out in the wilderness
[1:38:02] there come draped in this this camel
[1:38:06] hair with a leather belt with a leather
[1:38:08] girdle holding holding everything on
[1:38:10] there wasn't much to look at.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; He said brother Brandham says here he
[1:38:15] said oh what we need is a good
[1:38:17] oldfashioned Holy Ghost stirring among
[1:38:20] the people to get men and women back to
[1:38:22] living to the living God again. He said
[1:38:24] what's the matter? The world's dead.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "I can see this man
[1:38:29] John was born when he come out of the
[1:38:31] wilderness Judea. Didn't have a tuxedo
[1:38:33] on his collar turned around in the back
[1:38:35] eating fried chicken and ice cream three
[1:38:37] times a day, but he come he had locust
[1:38:40] and wild honey. And he had a big old
[1:38:42] piece of sheepkin draped around him with
[1:38:44] a camel skin belt lapped on him. Oh my."
[1:38:47] John obviously didn't care for the finer
[1:38:50] things in life.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; He imagined eating eating locust and and
[1:38:55] wild honey. Uh-huh.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Let me go kill a deer. Let me go kill
[1:39:01] something.
[1:39:03] God, I'm a prophet. Provi provide me
[1:39:06] something better than this.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; But John didn't care about that.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; John had a purpose.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; John had a reason.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Covered in goat hair. Le le leather
[1:39:20] leather belt genuine leather belt
[1:39:23] eating locust at least cover them in
[1:39:26] chocolate or do something. Lord bless
[1:39:30] these locust.
[1:39:33] Change it into something. You know God
[1:39:34] can change anybody. Change this locust.
[1:39:38] I guess that that's what the honey was
[1:39:40] for to make it a little sweet.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Nothing artificial about that. God God
[1:39:45] did provide him the honey, didn't he?
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Think about that. God will give
[1:39:51] you what you have need of you. He He'll
[1:39:52] take the bitter things and make it
[1:39:54] sweet. Amen. He He just God will see you
[1:39:57] through this morning. He'll see you
[1:39:59] through in this hour. If you've got a
[1:40:01] purpose, amen. Amen. Nothing can destroy
[1:40:03] that purpose. God will give you
[1:40:05] something to eat. God will provide for
[1:40:07] you. He's still Jehovah Gyra. After
[1:40:09] several hundred years, Amen. There
[1:40:11] hadn't been a prophet on the scene. But
[1:40:13] Jehovah Gyra, God provided a prophet
[1:40:16] from the scripture. Amen. Come out.
[1:40:18] Amen. He wasn't much to look at. Maybe
[1:40:20] he didn't enjoy the finer things of
[1:40:22] life. Maybe it didn't didn't mean that
[1:40:24] much to him.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; But what he had to say was true. What he
[1:40:28] had to say was anointed. Amen. Amen. And
[1:40:31] while he had breath in his lungs, Amen.
[1:40:33] He He did it. He He did what God called
[1:40:35] him to do. While he had while he had
[1:40:37] breath in his lungs, he expressed that.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this morning, we know
[1:40:41] that John the Baptist had his head cut
[1:40:43] off. We understand what happened to him.
[1:40:45] But I want to tell you this that that
[1:40:48] Satan can't do nothing to you until God
[1:40:50] allows it. Amen. Until your purpose is
[1:40:52] fulfilled. Amen. Amen. You will walk
[1:40:54] this earth with the breath in in your
[1:40:56] lungs that God provided. And he will
[1:40:58] provide for you meat. And he will
[1:41:00] provide for you clothing. He will
[1:41:02] provide for you housing. He will give
[1:41:04] you what you have need of.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Thank you, Lord. All right.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:13] Come on.

[1:41:21] preach Christ.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; Stay true to the word and God will see
[1:41:29] you through this morning. Amen.
[1:41:32] Telling the people to get right for the
[1:41:35] kingdom of heaven is at hand.

[1:44:28] we can leave here better Christians than
[1:44:31] what we were when we came. That ought to
[1:44:33] be the desire of every person in this
[1:44:35] place.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; I want to leave better
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; than what I came.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Try to quit screaming at you here.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Come on.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love the Lord
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; there. John, a preacher,
[1:44:58] brother Bam said his hair all bulged out
[1:45:00] around his face.
[1:45:02] Brother, he didn't know any theology.
[1:45:05] He didn't know any of these these
[1:45:06] seminary experiences. He stayed in the
[1:45:08] wilderness under the power of God until
[1:45:10] God sent him out. He said, "God, give us
[1:45:13] some more God- sent men like that." When
[1:45:16] he walked out there, brother, he wasn't
[1:45:17] so eloquent to look at. His speech
[1:45:19] wasn't so eloquent. But I'll tell you
[1:45:21] what he did. He preached sermons that
[1:45:23] stirred all the regions. He preached
[1:45:25] sermons that stirred all the regions
[1:45:26] around in Judea and Jerusalem and
[1:45:28] everything came out to hear him.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He didn't care for the finer
[1:45:34] things in life. And it's all right if
[1:45:37] you do. I like to have nice things. I
[1:45:41] like to eat fried chicken and ice cream.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with fried chicken
[1:45:45] or ice cream.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; but let it let us not be so comfortable
[1:45:49] that we lose the sight of the purpose of
[1:45:52] God. Let us not be so so comfortable
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; in these old bodies.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:02] He said why? He preached not theology
[1:46:04] but Christ.
[1:46:06] What's the matter with the world today?
[1:46:08] We've substituted our creeds and things
[1:46:10] to take the place of the Holy Ghost.
[1:46:12] Creeds will never shove the church on.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Creeds will never shove the church on.
[1:46:19] your own ideas about the message and
[1:46:21] your twist upon the message will never
[1:46:24] rapture the church. It will never shove
[1:46:26] the church on. It takes the Holy Ghost
[1:46:29] to lead the church and the Holy Ghost
[1:46:31] stays with the word.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; You believe that the Holy Ghost will
[1:46:35] stay right there with the word for the
[1:46:38] Holy Ghost wrote the word.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; So if we're off the word, then the Holy
[1:46:43] Ghost isn't leading that. We're leading
[1:46:45] ourselves and you're going
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; off the path. But to get back on the
[1:46:49] path, you've got to come under the word
[1:46:51] because that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:46:53] pulling. It's pulling the anointed word
[1:46:55] for this hour to the rapture. It's
[1:46:58] bringing the church through. Amen. Our
[1:47:00] ideas will do nothing.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; It will do nothing.
[1:47:07] Brother Ram says that old sassifrass
[1:47:08] gospel, oldfashioned gospel, he said,
[1:47:11] but it saved me and it'll do the same
[1:47:14] thing for you. It's truth. It's hard.
[1:47:17] John's preaching was hard. I can't
[1:47:19] imagine it would be easy preaching.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; I can't imagine it would be easy to sit
[1:47:23] under. And that's what the truth is.
[1:47:25] It's hard. He said, "I know it's hard,
[1:47:27] but brother, sometimes you have to get
[1:47:29] broke up before you can get made up
[1:47:31] again." He said, "It's the truth." Amen.
[1:47:34] I'll say it again. Preaching our ideas
[1:47:36] will never help anyone. Preaching our
[1:47:39] special doctrine or our special
[1:47:41] revelation will never help anyone.
[1:47:43] Especially if that doctrine and you
[1:47:45] could have a a special revelation,
[1:47:47] special doctrine. No, nothing against
[1:47:49] that. But especially it won't help
[1:47:51] anybody if it's off the word. It will
[1:47:53] not help anybody. Those things are dead.
[1:47:56] They are lifeless. Amen. But I say let
[1:47:58] our doctrine, let our teaching, let let
[1:48:00] what we project be from cover to cover
[1:48:03] in the Bible. Let it be found
[1:48:04] consistently. Amen. Not something
[1:48:06] isolated, not something that you
[1:48:08] formulated, but let it be found
[1:48:10] consistently with the teachings of the
[1:48:12] prophet of God for this day and the
[1:48:14] message of this hour. Amen. Preaching
[1:48:16] our our ideas will only drive the Holy
[1:48:18] Ghost. It will only drive the the the
[1:48:21] Holy Ghost out presence
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; from our midst.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Come on, sir.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And if there's no Holy Ghost, there's
[1:48:29] nothing to hold.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Hold anybody. Uh-huh.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost,
[1:48:36] it will not hold anybody.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; But with the Holy Ghost, there's a
[1:48:41] holding power. There's a staying power.
[1:48:44] There's an effect
[1:48:46] until the predestinated moment, the
[1:48:48] predestinated time of your purpose is
[1:48:52] manifested.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And the Holy Ghost present will
[1:48:56] illuminate that in a person's life.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; You may go years hearing the word. You
[1:49:02] may go years. Amen. No doubt hearing the
[1:49:05] voice and the tug of the Holy Ghost. But
[1:49:07] at a predestinated moment, amen. When
[1:49:09] your purpose of why you are here, when
[1:49:11] it when it comes time and there's a time
[1:49:14] and a season, Amen. If the presence is
[1:49:16] here, if you can get in that presence,
[1:49:18] it will illuminate your life and set you
[1:49:20] forth
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; and pull your life by the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:24] Pull your life and bring you to where
[1:49:26] you need to be.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:49:34] Thank you.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; God will not honor the confusion of man
[1:49:41] to interpret the Bible or what a prophet
[1:49:43] spoke in this day.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; God will not honor that.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He won't honor if it comes from my lips
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; or anybody else's lips. God will not
[1:49:52] honor that. But he will honor his true,
[1:49:55] pure, unadulterated word. Brother said,
[1:49:58] "We have we have with divine
[1:50:01] divindication the perfect interpretation
[1:50:04] of the word." Why would I want to change
[1:50:05] anything of that
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; with my own special idea?
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Never helped anybody.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; But the true word will that's been
[1:50:14] revealed.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; Don't don't substitute anything for the
[1:50:23] real. Brother Brown said, "We don't need
[1:50:26] nothing fake. The skies are full of the
[1:50:29] real blessing." Amen. God God wants us
[1:50:32] to have the real thing this morning. He
[1:50:34] He don't want He don't want to give us a
[1:50:36] substitute. He don't want to give you
[1:50:38] something and take it back either. Amen.
[1:50:40] But God wants you to have the real thing
[1:50:42] this morning. Amen. If you need more
[1:50:44] faith this morning, there's more faith
[1:50:45] to be had. Amen. There's real genuine
[1:50:48] revelation this morning. Amen. From the
[1:50:50] spirit of God. Amen. Amen. from the from
[1:50:52] the ministering spirits. Amen. From the
[1:50:55] Holy Ghost from heaven this morning.
[1:50:57] There's revelation of the word. Amen.
[1:50:59] That will give you victory in your life.
[1:51:01] Amen.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; How many times have I said amen,
[1:51:04] sisters?
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Hopefully, nobody's keeping count.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Don't substitute anything for the real.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; There's a real lifechanging gospel.
[1:51:17] Amen. And there's a voice even this
[1:51:19] morning that goes beyond the sound of
[1:51:21] the voice of a man. Amen. But Jesus
[1:51:24] said, "My sheep know my voice and a
[1:51:26] stranger they will not follow." Amen.
[1:51:28] There's a tug and there's a pull of the
[1:51:31] Holy Ghost. Amen. Even even beyond
[1:51:33] John's own voice. Amen. There was a
[1:51:35] voice speaking through John. Amen. He
[1:51:38] could preach as loud as he wanted. Amen.
[1:51:40] But if there wasn't something back in
[1:51:41] him, Amen. If there wasn't a a spirit of
[1:51:44] God in there ministering, Amen. It would
[1:51:46] have never draw the hearts. Amen. But
[1:51:48] God was in it. Amen. And amen. And if if
[1:51:50] there's a tug this morning, if there's a
[1:51:52] little bit of tug of the Holy Ghost,
[1:51:54] Amen. Amen. Respond to that voice. Amen.
[1:51:56] Amen. Amen. Listen to that voice. Amen.
[1:51:59] If there's a deep calling to the deep,
[1:52:01] help me preach this morning. If there's
[1:52:03] a deep calling to the deep, then there's
[1:52:05] got to be a deep to respond. Amen. If
[1:52:07] there's a longing for the God of
[1:52:08] history, for the God of the Bible, Amen.
[1:52:11] Amen. There's got to be a God of
[1:52:12] history, amen, to come on the scene,
[1:52:14] there's got to be a God of the Bible.
[1:52:16] come on the scene. If there's a longing,
[1:52:18] if there's a little bit of longing to
[1:52:20] say, "Oh Jehovah God, manifest yourself
[1:52:22] to me." Amen. Like you did, Amen. of the
[1:52:25] children of Israel, of the prophets of
[1:52:27] old. Amen. Like you did to Paul and
[1:52:29] Silas. Amen. When they were in the
[1:52:30] prison, Amen. Manifest yourself to me
[1:52:33] like you did to the prophet. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:36] There when Had said, "That's nothing but
[1:52:38] the truth." Amen. If you'll do your
[1:52:40] part, God will do his this morning.
[1:52:42] Amen. There's a real Amen. There's a
[1:52:43] blessing for the people of God. Thank
[1:52:45] you, Lord.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; There's a longing in your heart for
[1:52:55] reality. Amen. He's here this morning.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Matthew 3 and5. Try to hurry here.
[1:53:08] then went out to him Jerusalem and all
[1:53:12] Judea and all the region round about
[1:53:14] Jordan and were baptized of him in
[1:53:18] Jordan confessing their sins.
[1:53:20] And when they saw when he saw many of
[1:53:23] the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his
[1:53:25] baptism, he said unto them, "Oh
[1:53:27] generation of vipers,
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; who hath warned you to flee from the
[1:53:31] wrath to come?"
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring forth therefore fruits
[1:53:34] meat for repentance. And think not to
[1:53:37] say within yourselves, we have Abraham
[1:53:39] to our father. For I say unto you that
[1:53:41] God is able these stones to raise up
[1:53:44] children unto Abraham.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; You believe he can still raise up stones
[1:53:50] this morning?
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Here he's dealing with the religious
[1:53:53] ones of that day, the Sadducees, the
[1:53:55] Pharisees, the ones that were supposed
[1:53:57] to know the word. Hear the ministry, the
[1:54:00] voice of God speaking to them. And they
[1:54:01] were supposed to know, but yet they were
[1:54:04] there to criticize.
[1:54:06] There he's speaking to the ones that
[1:54:07] knew what Moses said. They knew what the
[1:54:10] prophet said. They could tell you
[1:54:11] everything.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; Every line, every phrase, they could
[1:54:16] repeat it.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; They under they they had somewhat of an
[1:54:20] understanding, but it wasn't the
[1:54:22] understanding for that day.
[1:54:25] They they knew what was said. And there
[1:54:27] he's he's he's talking to them and they
[1:54:29] knew all the quotes. Amen. And they were
[1:54:32] supposed to be the ones that had it all
[1:54:33] figured out. But John calls them a
[1:54:36] generation of vipers. I don't think
[1:54:39] there's much thing something worse that
[1:54:41] you call somebody than a snake. I think
[1:54:43] that's about as bad as it gets. If
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; you've ever called somebody a snake,
[1:54:47] then they they done you wrong. They done
[1:54:50] something to you for you to call them a
[1:54:52] snake. Nobody likes a snake,
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; He That's right. Nobody likes a snake.
[1:55:01] And there he's calling them vipers.
[1:55:04] They're calling them snakes. Bring forth
[1:55:07] fruits, meat for repentance. Humble
[1:55:09] yourselves. Throw away your ideas.
[1:55:12] There's someone coming.
[1:55:14] He could be here right now. Throw away
[1:55:17] your ideas.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. The
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; scriptures being fulfilled. The words
[1:55:22] being fulfilled. Amen. It's coming.
[1:55:24] Amen. Into plain view.
[1:55:26] Throw away your ideas. Make repent. make
[1:55:29] ready. Humble yourselves. Throw away
[1:55:32] your preconceived ideas of what God is
[1:55:34] supposed to be. Repent. Make ready. But
[1:55:37] it wasn't in them to have their hearts
[1:55:39] changed.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; The preaching was just too hard. They
[1:55:44] couldn't bear it.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; What God was doing at that present time
[1:55:49] didn't fit their idea. And that that's
[1:55:52] what the message is in this hour. It
[1:55:54] doesn't fit the idea
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; though. is scripturally sound.
[1:56:00] They look past it
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't fit their idea. And I
[1:56:04] heard brother Donnie Reagan preaching,
[1:56:07] heard a little clip when he first come
[1:56:09] in contact with the message. He he went
[1:56:12] to Jeffersonville and got all the tapes.
[1:56:14] Maybe somebody heard this. Went and got
[1:56:16] all the tapes and had his own little
[1:56:18] church there and he did. He'd come back
[1:56:21] and he just shut himself in and listen
[1:56:24] and listen to the message and listen and
[1:56:26] listen to the message. He said he didn't
[1:56:28] go out and preach. He didn't go here and
[1:56:29] there. He had his own little church, but
[1:56:31] he said he didn't want to carry over his
[1:56:33] own ideas, his own Pentecostal ideas in
[1:56:37] to the message. Amen. An anointed man
[1:56:40] anointed to preach, but he said he
[1:56:42] needed a birth of the word.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; I thought that was so powerful
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; there. not to mix his own ideas, but to
[1:56:50] preach the pure word. And I I I thank
[1:56:52] God for men like that. I think about
[1:56:54] different ministers I I've heard preach
[1:56:56] and brother Ben and and different ones.
[1:56:59] And you know, when you hear them preach,
[1:57:00] it's the same as the the sound that I
[1:57:02] hear coming off the message when I
[1:57:05] listen to it. I always thought that
[1:57:06] about Brother Tim, not to put nobody up,
[1:57:08] but I just always I always it was always
[1:57:11] the same thing that I heard.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate men of God like that
[1:57:15] will that will try to stay true to the
[1:57:16] word. Yeah. We'll we'll get off. We'll
[1:57:18] have little differences of opinion of
[1:57:20] this and that. Amen. But let us stay
[1:57:22] true to the word. Let us not mix our own
[1:57:24] ideas. Amen. But let's come under the
[1:57:26] pure word. Amen. We're not in a
[1:57:28] Pentecostal age. Amen. We're in a
[1:57:30] different time now. Amen. John, Amen,
[1:57:32] when he was preaching, he was in a
[1:57:34] certain dispensation. But later on in
[1:57:36] the book of Acts, amen, there was those
[1:57:38] that was baptized unto repentance. Amen.
[1:57:40] It did come into a different
[1:57:42] dispensation. Amen. And they said, "Have
[1:57:44] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:57:45] believed?" And they said, "We don't know
[1:57:47] anything about the Holy Ghost." They
[1:57:49] were baptized under John. He said, "Oh
[1:57:51] no, something's different now. See,
[1:57:53] something had changed. It was a
[1:57:54] different time. In just a few years, it
[1:57:58] changed."
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; So, the word is progressive.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; God doesn't change his mind, but the
[1:58:05] word unfolds itself.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; And that's what the message of the hour
[1:58:10] is. We we can we can
[1:58:13] come to a certain spot, but it's a
[1:58:16] progression. It's a continual
[1:58:18] progression. Even brother Brandham
[1:58:20] himself had a progressive revelation of
[1:58:23] things. Was brother Brandham wrong when
[1:58:25] he preached certain things? He preached
[1:58:26] it in the light that he understood it in
[1:58:29] that he had. But when a greater light
[1:58:31] came, he walked in that progression. And
[1:58:34] that's the sign of a of a minister, of a
[1:58:36] true believer. When I'm wrong, when I
[1:58:38] say something wrong, uh, and something
[1:58:40] else is revealed to me, let me walk in
[1:58:42] that.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to stay where you're at
[1:58:48] this morning. Amen.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be changed. We don't have
[1:58:52] to be stubborn old mules, stubborn old
[1:58:55] whatever. We can We can be changed. We
[1:58:59] We can be different, right?
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; As long as it's progressing with the
[1:59:03] word.
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; I'll try to hurry here.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; John being anointed with the the spirit
[1:59:17] of Elijah as was promised
[1:59:21] was to turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:59:23] back to the children.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; His ministry was to turn the fathers
[1:59:28] back to the children. Elijah this day
[1:59:29] was to turn the children back to the
[1:59:31] faith of the Pentecostal father. Here
[1:59:34] John's turning these old Orthodox,
[1:59:35] brother said those old Orthodox Jew with
[1:59:37] callous hearts, stony hearts, and raise
[1:59:40] up children to Abraham.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's not get stuck on the vipers
[1:59:45] now. Let's not get stuck on the snakes.
[1:59:47] What' he say? God is able, if you won't
[1:59:50] do it, God is able to raise these
[1:59:52] stones. Amen. Children unto Abraham. And
[1:59:55] that's what God wants in this hour.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; And that's what God wants to have.
[1:59:59] Children with the faith of Abraham.
[2:00:02] Someone who will believe his word.
[2:00:04] Someone who will take the promised word
[2:00:06] of the day. No matter how impossible it
[2:00:08] seems. I I was going to say strange or
[2:00:10] crazy. What we believe isn't strange or
[2:00:12] crazy. It's just impossible to some.
[2:00:15] Amen. But but God wants children of
[2:00:17] Abraham that will take that which is
[2:00:19] impossible. Amen. That nobody could.
[2:00:21] Amen. We you can't do that. But God is
[2:00:24] able. Amen. To do what we aren't able to
[2:00:26] do. And God will reveal his word to his
[2:00:28] people in progression. Amen. Amen. for
[2:00:31] the age that they live in. Amen. And we
[2:00:33] will walk in that. The children of
[2:00:34] Abraham will walk in that.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; Through the difficulties, through the
[2:00:41] trials.
[2:00:43] And he told Abraham, Amen. After that
[2:00:46] trial, he said, "Thy seed shall possess
[2:00:48] the gate of its enemy." Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; That's the children of Abraham in this
[2:00:52] hour. That's the stones that he's raised
[2:00:54] up. That's the hearts and lives that
[2:00:56] he's changed. Amen. People, Amen. Amen.
[2:00:59] a people that he will see through every
[2:01:00] difficulty. He will see through every
[2:01:02] trial. Amen. And at the end of that,
[2:01:04] amen, they will overcome death, hell,
[2:01:07] and the grave. Amen. And they will take
[2:01:08] a rapture in this age and in this hour.
[2:01:11] They will overcome the gates of hell.
[2:01:13] They will overcome every enemy.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Stones.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; God is able to raise up stones.
[2:01:24] Bring the callous hearts.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. even even with her own
[2:01:28] ideas and shake them loose from those
[2:01:31] ideas and to bring them into lively
[2:01:34] stones. Children of Abraham to believe
[2:01:37] the word
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; to believe the word.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; Power and transformation. He says the
[2:01:45] same thing it is about having a church
[2:01:48] here in the last days. He is going to
[2:01:49] have a bride. He is able these stones to
[2:01:51] raise children. Abraham, if we don't
[2:01:53] follow him, he'll get somebody else that
[2:01:56] will follow him.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; So, if we don't want to do it, God will
[2:02:00] raise up somebody.
[2:02:01] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to do it this morning,
[2:02:03] God will raise up somebody to worship
[2:02:06] him, to have faith in his word. God will
[2:02:09] raise somebody up. He will have a bride
[2:02:11] in this day. It looks impossible. Looks
[2:02:14] impossible,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; but God will have a bride in this day.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[2:02:21] He will get somebody else. He'll bring
[2:02:24] in some drug addict. Somebody that'll
[2:02:27] serve God.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Why do they worship? Why do you worship?
[2:02:31] Because of what God delivered me from.
[2:02:32] Why do you Why do you love him so much?
[2:02:34] Cuz he done so much for me.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; You think about John. He neither drunk
[2:02:39] wine or strong drink. But there's many
[2:02:42] of us that have parttook in in things
[2:02:44] that are wrong. But God raised up
[2:02:45] stones. Amen. He raised up stones as
[2:02:48] children unto Abraham. He raised up from
[2:02:51] our lives. Amen. From what we were, from
[2:02:53] our callous condition. Amen. Amen. We
[2:02:56] were we were going to hell as quick as
[2:02:58] we could go. But God raised us up to
[2:03:00] believe his word in this hour.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; In an age of callous hearts and full of
[2:03:08] religion and hate for the word, Amen.
[2:03:12] There's stones that can be changed.
[2:03:14] Amen. There's a people that can hear the
[2:03:15] voice of the Lord their God calling to
[2:03:18] them. Amen. That will open up every door
[2:03:21] of their heart. Amen. That God could
[2:03:22] come and fill every every fiber of their
[2:03:25] being. Amen. I I love that quote and we
[2:03:27] we read it last time and I'll just kind
[2:03:29] of go over here and said, God, you know,
[2:03:31] you got to get yourself killed out.
[2:03:33] Brother said, I'm persuaded that that
[2:03:35] we've done just enough. We got just
[2:03:37] enough Holy Ghost and been received just
[2:03:39] enough Holy Ghost to where we don't want
[2:03:40] to lie or cheat or steal. But God wants
[2:03:43] to fill every fiber of the church. Amen.
[2:03:45] He wants to take every callous corner of
[2:03:47] your heart and fill every fiber of your
[2:03:50] life. Amen. And surround you with the
[2:03:52] love of the Holy Ghost, the love for the
[2:03:54] word and fill every every fiber. Amen.
[2:03:56] And make you just completely totally
[2:03:58] dead to yourself and to your thinking.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; Just surrendered in God
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; till his word is living right through
[2:04:05] you.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; I'll try to hurry here. Matthew 3 and
[2:04:11] 11.
[2:04:13] John said, "I indeed baptize you with
[2:04:15] water and to repentance, but he that
[2:04:16] cometh after me is mightier than I."
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Whose shoes I'm not worthy to bear. He
[2:04:22] shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:24] and with fire.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Whose fan is in his hand, he will
[2:04:27] thoroughly purge his floor and gather
[2:04:29] his wheat into the garner, but he will
[2:04:31] burn up the chaff with unquenchable
[2:04:33] fire.

[2:04:49] near. He was so positive that what he
[2:04:52] was preaching about, who he was
[2:04:53] preaching about was in the midst. That
[2:04:56] he was so close to where he could
[2:04:57] identify and fulfill what he was called
[2:05:00] to do. That he could identify that this
[2:05:02] is the Messiah. John was so positive of
[2:05:06] where he was standing. He was so
[2:05:07] positive of the things that he said. He
[2:05:10] was so positive of the things that he
[2:05:12] believed. He was so positive of what God
[2:05:14] told him. And I want to say this

[2:06:02] morning?

[2:07:10] friends and from your associates, amen,
[2:07:12] it will cause a separation from the
[2:07:15] world.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Separate you so he remember John wants
[2:07:20] to prepare them not for himself but for
[2:07:23] the Lord.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:28] come. There's a purging power. There's a
[2:07:30] cleansing power coming. It's right here.
[2:07:33] And when that comes, he will take you up
[2:07:35] into his garner and the chaff will be
[2:07:38] burnt.

[2:08:05] power. He was so positive there was

[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. To where there's nothing left but
[2:08:15] the seed. Amen. Are you positive this
[2:08:18] morning?
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Many believed. Many believed
[2:08:23] because of John. Many believed. And I
[2:08:25] say, "Why do you believe this morning?"
[2:08:28] Why do you believe this morning? Amen.
[2:08:31] Jesus said, "Believe on him whom God has
[2:08:34] sent." And God sent a man in this hour.
[2:08:37] Amen. Amen. A man sent from God. A man
[2:08:40] anointed with the spirit of Elijah, a
[2:08:43] man called for a purpose. John had a
[2:08:45] strange birth. No doubt. He was dead in
[2:08:47] his his mother's womb. And there the
[2:08:49] name of Jesus was spoken. Life came. But
[2:08:52] here come a man sent from God that had a
[2:08:54] peculiar birth himself. There born in
[2:08:56] the cabin in a cabin in the mountains of
[2:08:58] Kentucky where a light appeared at the
[2:09:01] window of his birth. And that light came
[2:09:03] in as a testimony is. And that light
[2:09:06] came in and whirled around. Brother just
[2:09:08] they described it. They said it was
[2:09:09] about the size of a pillow and it
[2:09:11] settled over where he was.
[2:09:15] And he says here at 7 years old when I
[2:09:17] was packing little molasses bucket there
[2:09:20] was a voice that spoke out of a bush in
[2:09:22] a whirlwind told me to never drink or
[2:09:25] smoke or defile my body in any way that
[2:09:27] there be a work for me to do when I get
[2:09:30] older.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; God's keeping power for his profit.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:09:37] Brother Brand would go on until later on
[2:09:40] got older and it's crazy. He's carrying
[2:09:44] water to a steel and his father is
[2:09:47] running the steel and here this voice
[2:09:49] tells him don't ever smoke, don't ever
[2:09:51] drink or defile your body. And here he's
[2:09:54] in this situation. He's carrying water
[2:09:56] to a steel. And there they begin to make
[2:09:59] fun of him that why he wouldn't drink or
[2:10:02] wouldn't take a sip. A brown that never
[2:10:05] drank. I'm not I'm not trying to make
[2:10:08] this about brother Brandham. We'll try
[2:10:10] to finish up here.
[2:10:12] But there's a keeping power that God
[2:10:14] has.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; If you got a purpose in this hour. Amen.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; There he tried to take a drink. Tried
[2:10:25] and some wouldn't let him.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Voice spoke again. Don't never drink.
[2:10:30] And he threw it down. They made fun of
[2:10:32] him. years later
[2:10:36] they were smoking.
[2:10:38] They were making fun of him because he
[2:10:39] wasn't smoking. He tried so hard to
[2:10:41] smoke that.
[2:10:43] He tried so hard.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Give me that."
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; But it blew out. The voice spoke again.
[2:10:51] Amen. God had a purpose for this
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; this man. Amen. He would cause many to
[2:10:57] believe.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every one of you. But I'm here
[2:11:01] because a prophet came in this hour.
[2:11:04] Because God sent a prophet. Amen. And
[2:11:07] that that ministry has had an influence
[2:11:09] on all of us. Because God had an
[2:11:12] influence on his life and kept him for a
[2:11:15] purpose. And that's why we're here. Not
[2:11:17] just because of brother Brown, because
[2:11:18] of that God sent ministry to turn our
[2:11:21] hearts back to the faith of the Bible.
[2:11:23] Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; Are you positive this morning?
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. Later in life, he would be
[2:11:28] baptizing in the Ohio River after
[2:11:31] revival, baptizing about 500. And there
[2:11:34] as the 17th person, how would you like
[2:11:37] to be standing there?
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; While the while he was baptizing the
[2:11:40] 17th person, a light came down and a
[2:11:43] voice was heard saying, "As John the
[2:11:45] Baptist was sent to forrun the first
[2:11:47] coming of Christ, so will your message
[2:11:50] forun the second coming." See, God had a
[2:11:53] purpose. Amen. He was born to be a
[2:11:55] witness of the light to point people
[2:11:57] back to the word. Amen. That all men
[2:12:00] might believe. That we might believe.
[2:12:01] Amen. That was the purpose of that
[2:12:03] ministry. Amen. Not to point him us to
[2:12:06] himself.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; But to point us to Christ.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; We believe what we believe this morning
[2:12:14] because our hearts have been turned.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; by that.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; And I'll read just a few quotes here and
[2:12:21] we'll finish up.
[2:12:24] He says in anointed ones at the end
[2:12:26] time, he says, "I wasn't the one that
[2:12:27] appeared down on the river."
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; I was only standing there when he
[2:12:31] appeared.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not the one that performs these
[2:12:35] things and foretells these things that
[2:12:36] happens as perfect as they are. I'm only
[2:12:39] one I'm only one that's near when he
[2:12:41] does it.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I was only a voice that he used to say
[2:12:44] it. I wasn't It wasn't what I knew.
[2:12:47] Forgive my my speech. It wasn't what I
[2:12:50] knew. It it's it's what I just
[2:12:52] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[2:12:54] through. It isn't me. It wasn't the
[2:12:56] seventh angel. No, it's the
[2:12:57] manifestation of the son of man. It
[2:13:00] wasn't the angel his message. It was the
[2:13:02] mystery that God unfolded.
[2:13:05] &gt;&gt; It's not a man. It's God. It's the an
[2:13:08] angel was not the son of man. He was the
[2:13:10] messenger from the son of man. The son
[2:13:12] of man is Christ. And he is the one
[2:13:14] you're feeding on. You're not feeding on
[2:13:16] a man and his word. His words will fail,
[2:13:18] but you're feeding on the unfailing body
[2:13:21] word of the son of man.
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown never put it on himself.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; He was just standing there
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; when God came.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. He pointed the people to Christ.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "I was just standing there." He
[2:13:36] said, "It wasn't my voice. It was the
[2:13:37] manifestation."
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Not that I'm the son of man. It was the
[2:13:42] manifestation of the son of man.
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:13:47] Amen.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; I wish I I got a little bit more to go
[2:13:53] here.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Matthew 3 again 13. Then Jesus cometh,
[2:14:01] I'll finish up on this, from Galilee to
[2:14:03] Jordan unto John to be baptized of him.
[2:14:07] But John forbad him, saying, I have need
[2:14:09] to be baptized of thee, and comest thou
[2:14:11] to me? And Jesus answering said unto
[2:14:14] him, "Suffer it to be so now, for thus
[2:14:16] it becometh to us to fulfill all
[2:14:19] righteousness." Then he suffered him.
[2:14:22] Have you ever, and brother Brandham goes
[2:14:24] over this, and I've thought this myself,
[2:14:25] have you ever ever wondered why Jesus
[2:14:27] had to be baptized? So when we we we
[2:14:30] become when we come baptized, we repent
[2:14:32] of our sins, but he didn't have any sins
[2:14:35] to repent of. Why? Why did he have to be
[2:14:38] baptized? The brother said, "Why would
[2:14:40] this person be baptized in as an act of
[2:14:42] repentance and confession when he was
[2:14:44] holy, spotless, unadulterated son of the
[2:14:47] living God? Why would this person have
[2:14:49] to be baptized like a man coming?" He
[2:14:52] said he had no confession to make
[2:14:53] because he was God. Why would he have to
[2:14:56] be baptized under repentance? Amen. If
[2:14:58] he was the infallible God, he said he
[2:15:00] was in the world and the world was made
[2:15:02] by him and the world knew him not. Why
[2:15:04] would he have to be baptized? But Jesus
[2:15:07] said, "Suffer to be so."
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Suffer it to be so, for it is
[2:15:12] becoming to us to fulfill all
[2:15:15] righteousness." And Jesus was a type of
[2:15:17] the high priest. Amen. And the priest
[2:15:19] would be anointed.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and before he could be
[2:15:22] anointed, he had to be washed. And
[2:15:25] brother Rams and he says in in Exodus
[2:15:27] there, he says, "And Aaron and his son
[2:15:29] shall bring unto the door the tabernacle
[2:15:31] of the congregation and shall wash them
[2:15:34] with water."
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he goes on there and he said,
[2:15:37] "And thou shalt take the anointing oil
[2:15:39] and pour it upon the head and anoint
[2:15:42] him." He says, "See, the high priest,
[2:15:43] before he could ever be anointed, he had
[2:15:45] to be washed with water." And therefore,
[2:15:47] when Jesus, before he could be anointed,
[2:15:49] here's the truth of it. Before he could
[2:15:51] be anointed, before the dove, the Holy
[2:15:53] Ghost could descend upon him, our high
[2:15:56] priest, he had to be washed with water.
[2:15:59] Oh my. He had to fulfill, Amen. what the
[2:16:02] scripture said of him. Oh my. And there,
[2:16:05] amen, the word came to the word in the
[2:16:07] water. And John said, "I have need to be
[2:16:10] baptized of thee." And Jesus said, "Suff
[2:16:12] it to be so." Amen. The word's got to be
[2:16:14] fulfilled. Amen. What a testament that
[2:16:16] is this this morning. Amen. Every word
[2:16:19] of God has got to be fulfilled.
[2:16:21] Everything's got to come to pass. Amen.
[2:16:23] We We've all got our part to play
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; in the fulfilling
[2:16:28] of righteousness.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:33] Meet the prophet in the water
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; and be washed. Amen.
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; Humble yourselves to a prophet's
[2:16:40] message.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[2:16:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; That he he told us didn't come from him.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Wasn't the seventh angel was the
[2:16:48] manifestation of the son of man. You're
[2:16:49] not feeding on the words of a man, but
[2:16:51] it's the unfailing body word of the son
[2:16:54] of man. Is that what you're feeding
[2:16:55] upon?
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; S. Are you positive of that?
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Hey, man. is stand this morning.
[2:17:05] [Music]
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; If Jesus had to be washed, if the lamb
[2:17:10] of God had to be washed, he subjected
[2:17:12] himself to John the messenger anointed
[2:17:16] with the spirit of Elijah so that the
[2:17:18] word could be fulfilled. What about you
[2:17:20] and I?
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; It's not just with water.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. But with the blood, the bleeding
[2:17:27] word to be washed. Amen.
[2:17:30] We've got some that's going to meet him
[2:17:31] in the water this morning.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're not we're not pointing to
[2:17:36] something that's going to come.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're telling them that something
[2:17:40] is here.
[2:17:40] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; There's a Holy Ghost here that can fill
[2:17:43] every fiber of their hearts, of their
[2:17:46] lives. You say, "They're too young. John
[2:17:49] the Baptist was a baby."
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Nobody's too young.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; That's just an idea that we have. Well,
[2:17:57] they've got to wait till a certain age.
[2:17:58] That's just an idea that we have.
[2:18:02] Amen. I believe he can do it this
[2:18:03] morning. The promise is unto you and to
[2:18:05] your children. Amen. The promise of the
[2:18:08] Holy Ghost. Amen. I believe he's present
[2:18:11] to fulfill his promise. He's present to
[2:18:13] fulfill his word this morning. Amen. If
[2:18:15] we'll do our part,
[2:18:17] &gt;&gt; if we'll come to the water and be
[2:18:19] washed, if we'll come to every church
[2:18:21] service and come with a heart open to
[2:18:23] the word of God, God will come and do
[2:18:25] his part. You believe that? Amen.

[2:18:43] Calvary.

[2:18:54] of that. find yourselves at the feet of
