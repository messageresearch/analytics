[35:06] like I needed to do that I'm going to do
[35:08] that at while you're having church here
[35:09] at 3:00 I'll be over there my kids uh my
[35:13] older two Peter and Esther they decided
[35:15] to stay here I don't know how to feel
[35:16] about
[35:18] that they'd rather stay here at church
[35:21] with y'all than go with their dads so I
[35:23] guess they're getting to that age but
[35:24] tonight's going to be our youth focused
[35:26] night and and so where you always come
[35:28] and support the youth and we're so glad
[35:30] of that it's good to see the pry back
[35:32] with us this morning God bless you guys
[35:34] they've been gallivanting around the
[35:36] country and and it's good to have them
[35:38] back and and I seen Brother Bruce back
[35:40] there God bless you Brother Bruce good
[35:41] to have you back in the house of the
[35:42] Lord and and each one that's here this
[35:44] morning Hebrews chapter 3 verse one
[35:47] wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the
[35:50] Heavenly calling consider the Apostle
[35:53] and high priest of our profession
[35:57] Christ
[35:58] Jesus Hebrews
[36:01] 4:14 seeing
[36:04] then that we have a great high priest
[36:08] that has passed into the heavens Jesus
[36:10] the son of God let us hold
[36:14] fast our
[36:16] profession again Hebrews
[36:20] 10:23 if just a moment to turn
[36:23] there while I put this jacket on in the
[36:25] first place
[36:27] let us hold
[36:29] fast the profession of our faith without
[36:34] wavering how many want to do that this
[36:36] morning for he is faithful that promised
[36:40] pray the Lord would add his Blessing to
[36:42] the word you may be seated this
[36:47] morning the best definition I have of
[36:51] positive is the best definition that I
[36:54] found is the definite existence of a
[36:58] thing rather than its absence which is
[37:01] negative so if something is positive it
[37:04] means it exists if something is negative
[37:07] it means it doesn't exist the word
[37:10] positive comes from a Latin word which
[37:12] means a question of law settled by
[37:14] agreement so it's a settled question a
[37:17] positive answer something that you know
[37:20] and something that you possess and
[37:24] profession in the King James version in
[37:25] the Bible is the same as our word
[37:28] confession something you say it's a
[37:30] statement belief about something so I I
[37:34] want to speak this morning on unleashing
[37:36] the power of a positive confession
[37:40] unleashing the power of a positive
[37:43] confession now a confession again is a
[37:46] statement of belief about something and
[37:49] if I would say this morning uh if I
[37:52] would say I'm going home after the
[37:54] service or I would say I'm going to
[37:57] Gibson and after the service that's a
[37:59] positive statement I'm I'm saying I'm
[38:01] going to do something and and I believe
[38:04] that right I I really believe that I'm
[38:06] going to go now many things could happen
[38:09] that could keep me from going many
[38:10] things could happen uh but you know when
[38:13] you tell somebody you're going to do
[38:14] something you don't sit there and say
[38:15] well you know uh if my car runs if it uh
[38:18] you know why why do you not do that
[38:21] because you have a a confidence a level
[38:23] of confidence in the vehicle that you're
[38:25] driving that you just expected to work
[38:27] when you go home and you you expect just
[38:30] to be able to go and and maybe some of
[38:32] yall don't I haven't always uh had
[38:34] Vehicles like that there's been times I
[38:36] I felt like that maybe I wouldn't make
[38:38] it home and and and maybe more often
[38:40] than not they were broke down but the
[38:42] vehicles I have now I I have for a
[38:44] reason and the reason I have these
[38:46] vehicles because I believe they'll get
[38:47] me from where I am to where I'm going
[38:50] and and so I can make a positive
[38:52] statement about them now the reason I
[38:54] can make that positive statement is also
[38:57] because I have the key to the vehicle
[39:00] right already in my possession and so I
[39:04] couldn't make a positive statement well
[39:05] I'm going to go home in brother David's
[39:07] vehicle today I I'm going to go home in
[39:09] brother Jared's vehicle today I can't
[39:10] make a positive statement about that
[39:13] because I don't possess the key to your
[39:16] possession right but I do possess the
[39:18] key to my possession and that key is it
[39:21] makes me positive that I can make it on
[39:23] well don't you realize when you have
[39:25] faith today you already have possession
[39:28] faith is what we possess that allows us
[39:31] to to recognize and to know I'm going
[39:34] home one of these days I'm not going to
[39:36] be in this body forever I'm going home
[39:39] I'm going to make it in a Rapture my
[39:41] body is going to be healed I'm going to
[39:43] be Chang in a moment in the twinkling of
[39:45] an eye what are we saying brother Joe I
[39:47] I'm positive I'm going to make it
[39:49] because I already have the key in my
[39:52] possession faith is my
[39:55] possession though I don't possess my
[39:57] body yet I don't possess maybe you
[39:59] you've been praying for healing and you
[40:01] don't possess your healing yet but you
[40:03] know it's coming right you know it's
[40:05] coming you're positive it's coming why
[40:07] can you be sure it's coming because you
[40:10] have
[40:12] faith right that's what you possess
[40:14] brother brandom said it was like having
[40:16] 25 cents now that won't buy you a loaf
[40:18] of bread today but back then it would he
[40:21] said if you gave me 25 cents if I was
[40:23] hungry and I needed a loaf of bread and
[40:25] I knew where there was a store that had
[40:26] bread for 25 cents and you gave me a
[40:29] quarter he said I could be just as happy
[40:31] with the quarter as I could with the
[40:32] loaf of bread because it's the purchase
[40:35] price of the bread and faith is the
[40:38] purchase price of every Redemptive
[40:41] blessing of God everything he died for
[40:43] under the atonement is bought by faith
[40:46] right and it's accessed by a positive
[40:51] confession towards the word yeah and of
[40:55] the word now we can only positively
[40:59] confess what we have right right we we
[41:03] can't confess what we don't have and
[41:05] what do we have again we don't have you
[41:08] know if I could tell you this morning
[41:10] prove to me that you're saved give me
[41:13] something to prove to me that you're
[41:15] saved none of us could have
[41:18] anything that would prove
[41:20] that you could say look at my life well
[41:24] I could show you a life of someone who
[41:26] who
[41:27] uh did everything
[41:29] right yeah and maybe went died and went
[41:31] to
[41:32] hell right because you're not saved you
[41:35] don't make it on good behavior right
[41:37] right so we can't physically prove that
[41:40] we're saved well I'm saved because I
[41:42] believe the message well there it be
[41:44] those who say they believe they don't
[41:45] don't make it right I'm I'm saved
[41:48] because what you can't prove that what
[41:51] proves it to you your faith right right
[41:55] faith is what you possess
[41:58] oh church that tells you now you might
[42:01] have you might have been saved off a bar
[42:03] stool you might say well I can see what
[42:05] I was I can see what I am now but what
[42:08] actually tells you that you're saved is
[42:10] the faith that you have in the promise
[42:12] of God that if you would come to him in
[42:14] a certain way if you would repent if
[42:16] you'd be baptized in the name of the
[42:18] Lord Jesus you would receive the baptism
[42:20] of the Holy Ghost and you say that
[42:21] wasn't just a feeling it wasn't just an
[42:23] emotion it wasn't just any experience
[42:26] that was God moving in my life and it
[42:28] becomes faith in your life are you with
[42:31] me so far what we possess is Faith right
[42:36] it it's all that we have it's the
[42:38] purchase price it's all that we have
[42:40] it's all that we need it's the purchase
[42:42] price of everything contained in the
[42:45] atonement the Bible tells us that faith
[42:47] is the substance of things hoped for the
[42:51] evidence of Things Not Seen it's the
[42:53] substance or the support or the reality
[42:56] or the actual uality of things hoped for
[42:59] and it's the evidence or the proof of
[43:01] Things Not Seen brother B said now
[43:04] here's where many people fail to receive
[43:06] their healing or what they're asking for
[43:08] because they take Faith to be something
[43:10] that is not they don't believe it see
[43:12] it's not he said it's not imagination
[43:15] it's actual
[43:16] substance he said now listen closely
[43:19] it's not what you imagine it's just as
[43:21] real to you as any sense of your body
[43:25] would declare anything else he said it's
[43:27] just as real as my eyes says this is a
[43:29] piece of paper it's just as real as to
[43:31] say that's a light it's just as real as
[43:33] to say I feel my coat yeah right what
[43:36] what is that what makes me what makes me
[43:38] say that I can make a positive statement
[43:40] I feel my coat what is that it's a sense
[43:43] of touch right right I know I feel
[43:45] something yeah and and faith is just
[43:48] like that I know it yeah right I know it
[43:51] I know it's s he said it's just as real
[43:53] as I hear that baby talking or making
[43:54] its noise just as real as music playing
[43:57] just as real as I taste anything in my
[43:59] mouth it's that real listen only you
[44:02] can't show it to somebody else
[44:06] yes right that's why we got to have an
[44:09] individual uh experience with God every
[44:11] one of us do our children do we do every
[44:14] one of you kids you got to have an
[44:15] individual experience with God you need
[44:17] to know for yourself where no one can
[44:19] shake you away from
[44:21] that you need to have something that you
[44:24] possess that nobody can come and take it
[44:26] away because people can people will say
[44:29] all kinds of things about you but you
[44:31] got to be willing and you got to be able
[44:33] to say within yourself I know what I
[44:35] possess I know in whom I believe in like
[44:38] Paul said and I'm persuaded he's able to
[44:40] keep that what I've committed unto him
[44:42] against that day so faith is a reality
[44:45] it's a substance he said you have it
[44:47] alone it's yours faith is a substance
[44:50] not just a myth it's something you
[44:52] possess not imagination he said if you
[44:54] really have it it's just as real to you
[44:56] as any other thing could be just as real
[44:59] as you know that you're riding in your
[45:01] automobile you see I have confidence
[45:04] again in my car that it's going to take
[45:06] me where I want to go I don't even think
[45:07] about it maybe I should think more about
[45:10] it because it's a
[45:12] Ford both of my cards are Ford so maybe
[45:15] I should have more thoughts about that
[45:20] but and but at least it's not a Chevy
[45:23] right so but it's it's it's something I
[45:26] have a confidence right I believe it
[45:29] works and I got enough confidence in it
[45:32] even though it's a for I got enough
[45:33] confidence in it that it'll make it to
[45:35] its destination oh church and you just
[45:37] realize that's the kind of confidence
[45:38] you got to have between you and God
[45:40] there's got to be that confidence that
[45:42] says I know I'm going to make it I know
[45:44] that no matter what anybody says no
[45:45] matter what the devil says no matter
[45:47] what my kids say no matter what my
[45:48] parents say no matter what anybody else
[45:50] says I'm going to make
[45:52] it why because faith is the substance I
[45:55] believe it that's
[45:57] and I'll tell you this my car failed me
[46:00] there had been times I went out there
[46:01] and I turned the key and it didn't work
[46:03] because it needed a battery or or it
[46:04] needed the motor rebuilt or needed
[46:06] something else but this word of God
[46:08] always works it's never failed if you
[46:11] put the key of faith in it it will work
[46:14] 100 times out of a
[46:15] hundred it never fails that's
[46:20] good do you realize young people what
[46:22] that means realize what that means
[46:24] sister Jasper when you put the key of
[46:26] faith in the word word of God you turn
[46:27] it it it'll work when you begin to pray
[46:30] and ask God for what you have need of he
[46:31] said what I'm going through struggles in
[46:33] my life but just ask God for what you
[46:34] have need of and when you do you believe
[46:36] that in faith it will work a hundred
[46:39] times out of a hundred you said well I
[46:41] didn't have an immediate response I
[46:43] didn't immediately feel better no but
[46:45] but listen it's not what happens to you
[46:47] immediately but you know it's going to
[46:50] happen it works 100% all right of the
[46:55] time now watch it's substance not an
[46:58] imagination not an emotion but something
[47:02] that you have and it comes to you by
[47:05] hearing the word of God and that only oh
[47:10] I think no matter what else we make time
[47:11] for in our lives we need to make time
[47:13] for hearing the word of God whether we
[47:15] hear it here in the church or hear it at
[47:17] home or hear it wherever it is we need
[47:19] to hear the word of God we need to be
[47:21] listening to the word we need to be
[47:23] listening to the voice of the spirit in
[47:24] our lives which will always speak the
[47:26] word am it comes to you by hearing the
[47:28] word of God and that only Faith cometh
[47:31] by hearing and hearing the word of God
[47:33] he said that puts it back to where your
[47:34] faith in it's not in some individual
[47:37] it's not in a man it's not in an
[47:39] organization it's not in a group of
[47:41] people it's in God because God is the
[47:43] word your faith is in
[47:47] God now the Bible tells us that through
[47:50] faith we understand that the worlds were
[47:53] framed by the word of God yeah or by the
[47:57] confession of God yeah right what God
[48:01] spoke I want you I want you to see the
[48:03] power of faith God believed his own word
[48:08] and he didn't say well there may be
[48:10] light he didn't say well I hope there's
[48:13] light he said let there be
[48:16] light right having faith in his own word
[48:19] and it came to pass he said the worlds
[48:22] were framed by the word of God so that
[48:23] things which are seen were not made of
[48:26] things things which do appear so in
[48:29] other words things that we think of as
[48:31] reality if you think about the eclipse
[48:33] that passed the other day and we think
[48:35] about how that how that everything was
[48:37] set in order and and they knew about
[48:39] that eclipse for years before it
[48:41] happened and they they told us about it
[48:43] when the last eclipse come through they
[48:45] told us about this one what was that
[48:47] they've known about it for years people
[48:50] have actually been predicting eclipses
[48:51] for for thousands of years for at least
[48:54] 2600 years people have been predicting
[48:56] when the sun and the moon will cross one
[48:58] another why can they do that because God
[49:01] when God puts something in order it
[49:03] always works come it doesn't work just
[49:05] part of the time it always works it
[49:08] always happens just exactly when he's
[49:10] when it's supposed to happen listen if
[49:12] he can do that with the sun and the moon
[49:14] how much more can he order the events of
[49:16] Our Lives to come together at the right
[49:19] time in the right
[49:22] place you say I know people we don't our
[49:25] young people here aren't really old
[49:26] enough most of you but I know you get
[49:28] worried as you get older and brother
[49:30] Isaac I know you get you know as you
[49:33] begin to get in your 20s you know what
[49:34] that's like in your 20s you begin to
[49:35] worry well I'm ever going to find a wife
[49:38] but planets had to
[49:40] cross right and God knew when that would
[49:44] happen but we didn't know there was
[49:47] somebody for Isaac there was somebody
[49:48] for Catherine we didn't even know
[49:50] Catherine but there was somebody for
[49:51] Catherine and somebody for Isaac what
[49:53] was it the plan is crossed at the right
[49:56] time at the time God knew they would
[49:58] cross yet all the worry and the struggle
[50:01] and the heartache that we look at that
[50:02] and we think man how how would it ever
[50:04] happen I'm not good enough I'm not I'm
[50:06] not handsome enough no brother brother
[50:08] Isaac never thought that but but some of
[50:10] us thought well I I'm not handsome
[50:11] enough I'm not you know I wouldn't be
[50:13] able but God caused us to come together
[50:16] at the right to oh don't you believe if
[50:18] he brought you to your husband or he
[50:19] brought you to your wife don't you
[50:21] believe he'll bring you to the right job
[50:22] he'll bring you to the right Church
[50:23] he'll he'll bring you to the right place
[50:25] at the right time we just got to have
[50:27] confidence in him believe his
[50:30] word that's good
[50:33] amen
[50:34] amen now so how does a sinner or a sick
[50:37] person Unleash the Power of a positive
[50:40] confession by possessing faith and
[50:44] confessing what you
[50:46] possess now medicine doesn't heal
[50:49] brother BR said you take the life out of
[50:51] there there's no healing he said life is
[50:54] the
[50:55] Healer life is the Healer and life is
[50:59] God Jesus came that you might have
[51:01] abundance of
[51:02] life he said more life than what your
[51:05] normal life is to believe on him to be
[51:09] healed by faith he said the right mental
[51:12] attitude towards any promise of God will
[51:14] bring it to pass there it is he said now
[51:19] and brother BR says that over and over
[51:20] again in the message but then he says
[51:22] say what are you talking about gifts for
[51:24] and he was telling them teaching them
[51:26] about gifts particularly uh the gift
[51:29] that God had put in his life and he said
[51:31] what are you talking about gifts for he
[51:32] said gifts are to edify they additions
[51:36] he said here is the first and only
[51:39] foundation for Divine Healing or
[51:42] anything from God is the Bible he said
[51:46] if you get off of that you're out of
[51:48] God's
[51:50] will can we say Amen to
[51:53] that you can't have a positive
[51:55] confession with the justing about
[51:57] something that's not in the word if it's
[52:00] not in the word you can't say this is
[52:02] what I'm going to do this is what I
[52:03] believe this is you might you might say
[52:05] it but it won't come to pass right
[52:08] because it's not in the word right he
[52:11] said if you get off of that you're out
[52:12] of God's Will and Divine Healing isn't a
[52:15] Hocus Pocus Affair it isn't saying a few
[52:18] mystery words over somebody and
[52:21] hypnotizing come on church it's the
[52:23] truth sir I love the way brother Bram
[52:25] defines Divine Healing it's the truth
[52:27] revealed through Jesus Christ is Divine
[52:31] Healing the truth revealed through Jesus
[52:33] Christ brother re said Faith again I'm
[52:35] reading a lot this morning but I just
[52:37] want you to really want I want to teach
[52:39] us teach this to us in a way that we can
[52:42] understand it way that I can understand
[52:44] it and you can understand it notice he
[52:46] said Faith you must believe he said it
[52:49] upon believing the only way that faith
[52:50] can be based sanely and sensibly for
[52:53] Divine Healing is upon the written word
[52:55] of God
[52:57] this is the
[52:59] foundation the foundation of faith is
[53:01] God's word that is the absolute of Faith
[53:05] yeah is whatever God says right right so
[53:08] then we got to believe if we're going to
[53:10] have faith we got to believe this is the
[53:11] infallible word of
[53:13] God right if you got to have faith in it
[53:16] you say well what about the message well
[53:17] I believe the message is the word of God
[53:20] I got to believe that to have faith in
[53:21] it I don't mean that everything a
[53:23] prophet said was thus sayith the Lord
[53:25] but what it does mean is that what a
[53:26] prophet phet said
[53:29] matters that's right what a prophet said
[53:32] matters he was a prophet when he said it
[53:35] right and so we we got to have faith in
[53:36] or confidence in won't do us any good
[53:38] right and not everything Moses said was
[53:41] thus sayith the Lord CU he said at one
[53:43] point you know he didn't circumcise his
[53:46] own Sons not everything he said or did
[53:47] was thus sayith the Lord but he was
[53:49] still God's man right right and God
[53:51] backed him up and so we believe we had a
[53:53] messenger like Moses in this day and
[53:55] hour in fact there were only uh three
[53:57] Messengers like that it was Moses in the
[53:59] in the Old Testament it was Paul in the
[54:01] New Testament and it was William brandom
[54:03] at the end time that actually had the
[54:05] the pillar of fire with them right
[54:08] during their Ministry and so we know
[54:09] they were Vindicated Prophet it wasn't
[54:11] just like any other Prophet that's got a
[54:13] vision or a dream or or a sensation or a
[54:16] feeling it wasn't like that at all it
[54:17] wasn't like these prophets today that
[54:19] come out and say well I'm a prophet and
[54:21] and then someone has a back ache
[54:22] somebody has a a neck that that's aching
[54:25] well it's aching cuz you they've been
[54:26] looking at you uh jumping around and so
[54:29] uh but that's not what kind of a prophet
[54:30] it is it's a prophet that could stand
[54:32] there and reveal the secrets of the
[54:33] heart and fulfilled the word of
[54:37] God right so so it's our faith has got
[54:41] to be upon the word that there is a
[54:43] scripture brother BR didn't come to
[54:44] replace the scripture what did he come
[54:46] to do to fulfill the
[54:48] scripture brother B didn't come to write
[54:50] another Bible what did he do he come to
[54:52] he come to live it out right and to
[54:55] speak it it become the message for our
[54:57] day the light for our day is the message
[55:01] of the hour right and we got to walk in
[55:03] that light or no light right right if we
[55:05] don't walk in the light of the message
[55:07] hour we walk in
[55:09] darkness that's how important the
[55:10] message is but now watch Faith got to be
[55:14] upon the written word of God this is the
[55:16] foundation everything in the message
[55:18] comes from the scriptures yes he's a
[55:21] word Prophet right and then everything
[55:23] in the message in whatever a prophet
[55:24] taught we can believe yeah
[55:26] right again that doesn't mean he
[55:28] couldn't stumble over his words and be
[55:29] human that's that he was human but we
[55:31] believe God hid
[55:34] himself right behind human flesh if I
[55:37] didn't believe that how could I not how
[55:39] could I believe in God hiding himself
[55:40] behind my flesh how could you believe in
[55:42] God hiding yourself behind your flesh he
[55:45] does he hides himself behind flesh even
[55:48] today but he hid himself there for the
[55:51] purpose of vindicating a Vindicated
[55:53] Prophet for the purpose of shining the
[55:55] light on the word for our day how many
[55:57] believe
[55:58] that so the foundation of faith is word
[56:01] of God you got to believe the message
[56:03] right right and we're a message
[56:07] church right if you don't believe the
[56:08] message you're not going to have faith
[56:09] in what I'm saying to you because what
[56:12] I'm saying to you comes from the
[56:14] message you might say well I you know
[56:17] brother bram's okay but I just you know
[56:19] he was he was good Divine healer but I
[56:20] just stay with the Bible Well if you
[56:22] don't believe what God said about the
[56:25] Bible in our day
[56:27] right how can you how can you how can
[56:29] you have any faith so it's got to come
[56:32] back to Lord I believe everything you
[56:34] say whatever you have to say is right I
[56:38] may not always be able to do it like I'd
[56:40] like to but I believe what you say is
[56:42] the truth how many can say that this
[56:44] morning I believe what you say Lord is
[56:47] the absolute truth that's what I
[56:49] believe so then I can make a positive
[56:52] confession about the word because a
[56:55] positive postive confession is a
[56:57] scriptural confession whatever the word
[56:59] says is true about me faith comes by
[57:03] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[57:06] oh yeah so now I possess faith that the
[57:10] word of God will materialize in my life
[57:13] now what did he do at the beginning he
[57:15] spoke said let there be light and there
[57:18] was light so now when God says something
[57:21] his word becomes material in his
[57:24] creation right his word with you you
[57:27] can't see what's in his mind you can't
[57:29] see his word you can't see Faith but you
[57:32] see the results of faith and what you
[57:34] see in your life is actually the results
[57:37] of Faith your healing your your we thank
[57:40] God for the wonderful testimonies of
[57:41] healing that we've seen and we we thank
[57:43] God for wonderful testimonies of
[57:45] Salvation and and your testimony this
[57:47] morning what God can do and so what's
[57:49] God doing God is saying something about
[57:53] his word and then it becomes material in
[57:55] your life that's when you say it now
[57:58] when God says something it's already
[58:00] accomplished he's Eternal but now we're
[58:02] creatures of time right right we're
[58:05] creatures of time and the way I one way
[58:08] I know that is because if I go over a
[58:09] certain amount of time on Sunday morning
[58:11] we're all going to be in
[58:14] trouble right because I got to leave
[58:16] here and be two hours away by
[58:19] 3:00 so if I preach to 1:30 this
[58:23] morning which I've never done
[58:28] breathe a little bit this morning you
[58:29] all right I've never preached to 1:30
[58:33] but I
[58:34] could right and we could preach all day
[58:36] if we just let ourselves go you
[58:38] know but but but we could you know the
[58:41] spirit of the Lord might move but then
[58:42] I'd have a problem with time right
[58:44] because I promis to be somewhere else so
[58:46] I believe I have the ability to stop the
[58:49] service and to close the service at a
[58:51] certain time and I can keep worshiping
[58:53] if you want to but then I'll go on to
[58:55] another place
[58:57] right why because I'm a creature of time
[58:59] but God don't work like that right God's
[59:02] not subject to time right right whatever
[59:05] he already whatever he said has already
[59:08] happened whatever is in the future with
[59:11] God has already happened because he's
[59:12] Eternal right does that make sense yeah
[59:15] he's not worried about you right because
[59:19] you're already in his you are oh my
[59:22] you're already saved you have already
[59:24] made it you're his child he's not
[59:26] concerned about you not making it that's
[59:29] because he does not exist in time and
[59:31] I've always taken this you can take it
[59:32] for what it's worth but I've always
[59:33] taken this as a type you know uh we uh
[59:37] we actually sinned in time we sinned in
[59:41] time but God is eternal right and so we
[59:45] can be forgiven or redeemed because we
[59:47] sinned in time but God is eternal but
[59:51] the Satan sinned before there was time
[59:53] you understand he was created and he was
[59:55] in in heaven where it's Eternal and he
[59:58] sinned Before Time and he could never
[1:00:01] repent right you realize even if he
[1:00:04] wanted to he couldn't repent because
[1:00:06] time is what gives us a space all right
[1:00:09] to repent oh I thank God for that today
[1:00:12] time gives us a space so that we can
[1:00:14] repent I said we ought to use our time
[1:00:17] we ought to use our time to repent and
[1:00:19] come back to God and give him all of all
[1:00:21] of our life every bit of our time that's
[1:00:24] good now Peter tells us in the Bible
[1:00:27] that scoffers would rise saying that his
[1:00:30] word isn't true because time has passed
[1:00:32] and it hasn't happened yet he said
[1:00:33] knowing this first those are come in the
[1:00:35] last day scoffers walking after their
[1:00:37] own lust or their own desire and saying
[1:00:39] where is the promise of his coming for
[1:00:41] since the fathers fell asleep all things
[1:00:44] continue as they were from the beginning
[1:00:46] of the creation for this they willingly
[1:00:49] are ignorant of that by the word of God
[1:00:51] the heavens were of old now watch what
[1:00:53] he's saying the Earth standing out of
[1:00:55] the water and in the water he said by
[1:00:57] the
[1:00:58] word that's why the planets are there
[1:01:01] that's why the eclipse happened the way
[1:01:03] that it did that's why things happen the
[1:01:05] way that they do and that's by the word
[1:01:09] that's why the heavens are in order
[1:01:10] that's why the Earth was separated from
[1:01:12] the water that's by the word that's why
[1:01:15] the sun and the moon were separated and
[1:01:17] put in their spots by the
[1:01:19] word amen I got to thinking about that
[1:01:21] Brother David while we watching that
[1:01:22] Eclipse I told somebody I think I said
[1:01:24] if that son was just a little bit
[1:01:26] further away we would all freeze to
[1:01:29] death if it was just a little bit closer
[1:01:31] we would all we would all burn up but it
[1:01:34] just happens to be where it is and if
[1:01:37] you look at all the other planets none
[1:01:39] of them they you would have to
[1:01:41] artificially support life on Mars you
[1:01:43] would have to artificially support life
[1:01:46] on any of the other planets you'd have
[1:01:47] to artificially you couldn't support
[1:01:49] life on the sun it's too hot but this
[1:01:52] planet supports life why does it because
[1:01:54] God said for this planet to be the one
[1:01:56] that had life in the beginning he made
[1:01:59] the heavens and the
[1:02:00] Earth right and the Earth was the one he
[1:02:03] singled out of all the planets don't you
[1:02:05] realize everybody else in the world may
[1:02:06] not have life we're living in a time of
[1:02:08] Darkness but you are the planet that he
[1:02:11] separated out from the before the
[1:02:13] foundation of the world you're in the
[1:02:15] habitable zone the part where there's
[1:02:18] life where the where the sun won't burn
[1:02:20] you up that's good but it produces just
[1:02:23] enough
[1:02:24] life amen so you can make it now watch 2
[1:02:28] Peter
[1:02:29] 3:6 whereby the world that then was
[1:02:31] being overflowed with water perish but
[1:02:34] the heavens and the Earth which are now
[1:02:36] now the heavens and the Earth which are
[1:02:38] now by the same word are kept in
[1:02:42] store kept in store in other words why
[1:02:46] did they hang there because God said
[1:02:51] so reserved unto fire against the day of
[1:02:54] judgment and predition
[1:02:56] of ungodly Men by the same word verse 8
[1:03:00] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:03:03] thing one day is with the Lord as a
[1:03:06] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:03:10] one
[1:03:11] day he says in verse n the Lord is not
[1:03:14] slack concerning his promise as some men
[1:03:17] count slackness so if you're believing
[1:03:19] for your healing today if you're
[1:03:20] believing for the Salvation of your
[1:03:22] children if you're believing for
[1:03:23] whatever it is that you have need of I
[1:03:25] don't want to limit just to those things
[1:03:27] whatever you have need of today if
[1:03:29] you're believing for it the Lord is not
[1:03:31] slack concerning his promise but is
[1:03:34] longsuffering aren't you glad he's
[1:03:36] longsuffering aren't you glad he puts up
[1:03:38] with us that's what time is it's the
[1:03:40] longsuffering of God not willing that
[1:03:43] any should perish he puts up with stuff
[1:03:45] out of us that that that he probably
[1:03:47] shouldn't put up with by our own
[1:03:49] standards we'd say we we should just do
[1:03:51] away with it we you should just do away
[1:03:53] with them brother said if I was God if
[1:03:55] they wouldn't take my word for it I just
[1:03:56] let him go but he said no he sent
[1:03:58] prophets he sent pastors he sent
[1:04:00] teachers he sent people to the Earth
[1:04:01] he's through all time why because he
[1:04:04] loves
[1:04:05] you he's longsuffering to us
[1:04:09] word I'm so glad he is not willing that
[1:04:12] any should perish but that all should
[1:04:15] come to
[1:04:17] repentance people say why don't you deal
[1:04:19] with this deal with that because we're
[1:04:21] we we hope we have the attribute of God
[1:04:23] we believe we have the attribute of God
[1:04:25] that belongs
[1:04:26] suffering there will come a time to deal
[1:04:28] with it but in our own lives we're
[1:04:31] longsuffering because we want to make
[1:04:32] sure we want to make sure that the
[1:04:34] person is in a place where they can
[1:04:36] respond to
[1:04:37] that right you you can do that with your
[1:04:39] own children they got to be in a place
[1:04:41] best thing you do for your children get
[1:04:42] them in the house of God put them in an
[1:04:44] atmosphere where they can respond to the
[1:04:46] word they won't always hear it you know
[1:04:48] there's things you can say to your wife
[1:04:50] that the timing's just
[1:04:54] wrong sometimes you need to wait on
[1:04:55] different timing to speak that word over
[1:04:59] her right brother BR talk about going
[1:05:01] casting a devil man trying to cast The
[1:05:03] Devil out of his wife he said he he said
[1:05:05] that's not the way to do it he said go
[1:05:06] love her the timing's not right the the
[1:05:10] timing matters because we're creatures
[1:05:12] of time we don't we don't just grow we
[1:05:15] don't just get saved all of a sudden
[1:05:16] we're perfect we don't even get the Holy
[1:05:19] Ghost all of a sudden we're perfect
[1:05:20] brother BR said you become a target of
[1:05:21] the devil then come on now amen but you
[1:05:24] got to reach a place where you got to
[1:05:26] reach a place where he wants you to be
[1:05:28] and how you're going to reach that place
[1:05:29] is by his longsuffering towards
[1:05:32] you yes so time doesn't matter to Faith
[1:05:36] it it matters to us as human beings but
[1:05:39] it doesn't matter to Faith because faith
[1:05:42] is part of who he is Faith is not a
[1:05:46] human attribute faith is a Divine
[1:05:49] attribute that's what Peter tells us
[1:05:51] it's the very first of the Divine
[1:05:53] attributes that Peter lists that come
[1:05:55] from the divine nature the foundation of
[1:05:57] all other Divine attributes is Faith so
[1:06:01] time doesn't matter to Faith because
[1:06:04] faith is a part of who he is it's an
[1:06:06] attribute of the Eternal God so we we
[1:06:10] find then that to Faith our Salvation is
[1:06:13] already paid for our healing was already
[1:06:16] bought and paid for even before the lamb
[1:06:20] came here on the earth physically Christ
[1:06:22] came we know that we were he was
[1:06:24] crucified he was he was slain before the
[1:06:27] foundation of the world so even before
[1:06:30] we ever sin before we before Moses ever
[1:06:33] sin before David ever sinned before any
[1:06:36] of the others ever did anything wrong he
[1:06:38] was already slain in the mind of God in
[1:06:41] the Eternal in The Eternity so they
[1:06:43] could believe and have faith looking
[1:06:45] forward to what would happen and we have
[1:06:47] faith and believe Looking Back Time
[1:06:49] doesn't matter right to Faith yeah good
[1:06:54] very see the Bible tells us that Heaven
[1:06:55] and Earth shall pass away sir amen but
[1:06:59] my words shall not pass
[1:07:03] away Jesus said he that heareth my word
[1:07:05] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:07:07] eternal life someone say has that's past
[1:07:11] tense brother random always points that
[1:07:12] out has eternal life and shall never
[1:07:15] come into the Judgment but has passed
[1:07:17] from death into life he said on that
[1:07:19] rock I stand tonight no matter how I
[1:07:22] feel or what the devil
[1:07:24] says am and we get all caught up in what
[1:07:28] the devil says that people come brother
[1:07:30] Ben the devil's just been beating up on
[1:07:33] me this week and I feel for you he'd
[1:07:35] been beating up on me too but that's his
[1:07:38] job right you realize he'd be out of
[1:07:41] work if he didn't have Christians to
[1:07:43] beat up
[1:07:44] on right and some you know he's going to
[1:07:46] be unemployed for a thousand
[1:07:49] years you might as well let him you
[1:07:52] might as well you know he he's going to
[1:07:54] he got to that's his job but you don't
[1:07:57] have to let him do it to you right he's
[1:08:00] got plenty of people to work on let him
[1:08:01] go work on somebody else but to you you
[1:08:04] believe the word yeah he said well well
[1:08:07] the devil makes me feel bad that again
[1:08:08] that's his job but it's the word that
[1:08:10] makes you feel better again it's your
[1:08:13] faith in the word of God that no matter
[1:08:15] how you feel yeah you still believe
[1:08:18] right he said no matter what the devil
[1:08:19] says God's word Heaven and Earth will
[1:08:21] pass away but that word will never pass
[1:08:24] away he said I trust his word nothing
[1:08:27] else I know but his word that's what I
[1:08:29] believe in yeah oh Hallelujah do you
[1:08:32] believe it this morning I don't know how
[1:08:35] I feel he said the devil would make me
[1:08:37] feel sometimes I wasn't
[1:08:39] saved and the devil makes me feel I
[1:08:41] wasn't healed I don't care what he says
[1:08:45] I can beat him on that word every
[1:08:48] time
[1:08:50] right so it's just like you
[1:08:54] know I I talked to you about playing
[1:08:56] chess before I like to play chess and
[1:08:58] it's always funny to me when you get
[1:09:00] somebody trash talking you before they
[1:09:02] play chess I'm sorry some of y'all play
[1:09:04] Real Sports I play
[1:09:07] chess you get somebody trash talking
[1:09:10] before you get to play in chess like
[1:09:12] some of y'all do with volleyball or
[1:09:13] something and it'd be the equivalent
[1:09:16] excuse me of me trash talking somebody
[1:09:18] on volleyball right or basketball y'all
[1:09:21] know I can't
[1:09:22] play you can look at me and see I can't
[1:09:25] play right and in chess they have
[1:09:27] ratings right so I I this guy you he's
[1:09:29] trash talking me and I'm sitting there
[1:09:31] thinking you know I'm I know that my
[1:09:34] rating is 100 points higher than
[1:09:36] yours you are not going to beat me if
[1:09:40] you do it's because I got
[1:09:42] distracted right or somebody called or
[1:09:44] somebody you're not going to beat me
[1:09:46] just just on your merits
[1:09:48] alone right if you beat me it's going to
[1:09:51] be my fault because your Score says what
[1:09:55] you are oh God and listen to me when it
[1:09:58] comes to the word of God when it comes
[1:10:00] to the devil when he tries to tempt you
[1:10:01] and he tries come what did Jesus do
[1:10:03] Jesus didn't have to do a miracle he
[1:10:05] didn't have to stand there and say well
[1:10:07] I'm I'm going to pray for a while have
[1:10:08] an all night pray no what did he do when
[1:10:10] the devil come to tempt him what did he
[1:10:11] say he said he said but it it's also
[1:10:14] written he brought the word of God to
[1:10:17] the fight why because he knew that the
[1:10:20] word of God Amen was was always defeat
[1:10:23] the devil on every place every time
[1:10:25] under every
[1:10:27] condition right so are you with your
[1:10:29] little 200
[1:10:31] rating right you're going to come trash
[1:10:33] talk me and say well I'm going to beat
[1:10:35] you well no you're not and I'm not going
[1:10:37] to beat the guys that have a 1500 rating
[1:10:40] I'm not going to do it it would be a it
[1:10:42] would be an accident if I did and the
[1:10:45] only way the devil can beat you is
[1:10:47] because of what we let him
[1:10:50] do oh my you you you have a word that's
[1:10:55] Ed so much higher than what his word is
[1:10:58] what he says so Jesus proved that in the
[1:11:01] wilderness now brother B said I say it's
[1:11:03] thus sayith the Lord look at that boy
[1:11:05] yes sir you can't move that so you can
[1:11:09] come to the devil and say devil look at
[1:11:11] that you can't move that you might be
[1:11:14] able to make me feel bad but you can't
[1:11:17] move that you might be able to make me
[1:11:19] feel down about everything going on but
[1:11:22] you can't move I wish somebody would
[1:11:24] preach with me this morning you can't
[1:11:26] move
[1:11:30] that we got to come to that
[1:11:34] place he said take him at his word
[1:11:36] believe it confess it no matter how you
[1:11:38] feel believe it anyhow he said so
[1:11:42] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[1:11:44] to him for righteousness the baby never
[1:11:46] come till 25 years later but he still
[1:11:48] give God praise for it before it came he
[1:11:51] was strong in faith giving praise to God
[1:11:52] he said that's it but you look at your
[1:11:54] symptoms said just a minute you look at
[1:11:56] your symptom you say well look here I
[1:11:58] was prayed for for a crippled hand my
[1:11:59] hand is no better that's no sign you're
[1:12:01] not
[1:12:02] healed God said so that's
[1:12:05] it no matter what that hand takes place
[1:12:08] it's what God Said It Ain't from my hand
[1:12:10] it's what God Said I accepted it I'll
[1:12:13] stay with it that's all so now he could
[1:12:15] open it up for today tomorrow might be
[1:12:18] 25 years but you let your testimony be
[1:12:23] positive all right
[1:12:25] every time you get sick you were prayed
[1:12:28] for you go out and get a little sick you
[1:12:30] say well I guess I lost my healing then
[1:12:32] your testimony becomes negative listen
[1:12:35] to this church and Jesus can't say no
[1:12:38] more for
[1:12:40] you now what does the scripture say he's
[1:12:43] the high priest of our
[1:12:46] confession so he can only intercede for
[1:12:49] us when we confess what we possess
[1:12:53] that's right which is faith which is
[1:12:55] based on the word so he can only
[1:12:58] intercede when we make a positive
[1:13:01] confession on the
[1:13:04] word amen and and you say well I don't
[1:13:07] know why he hasn't healed me well I
[1:13:09] wonder if you've allowed him the
[1:13:11] opportunity to intercede for you or if
[1:13:15] it's just constant
[1:13:17] negativity I'm preaching to myself too I
[1:13:19] I've told you before my nickname growing
[1:13:21] up was
[1:13:23] eore and not because I look like a
[1:13:25] donkey but because because of how sad I
[1:13:28] was all the
[1:13:29] time and and it that was my nickname and
[1:13:32] so I I I realize what a difficult thing
[1:13:35] it can be to look at the positive and to
[1:13:38] believe the the right thing but he's
[1:13:40] still the high priest of My Confession
[1:13:43] and I F found out brother JT when I
[1:13:45] begin to confess the word of God when I
[1:13:48] begin to not look at the symptoms listen
[1:13:50] if if I look just at the people in the
[1:13:52] church I might get discouraged yeah
[1:13:54] right just being honest with you if you
[1:13:56] just look at your pastor you might get
[1:13:58] discouraged right but if you look at the
[1:14:01] word the word is Right 100 times out of
[1:14:04] a 100 come on 100 times out of a 100 not
[1:14:08] 99 out of 100 100 times out of 100 look
[1:14:11] at the word the pastor might be wrong he
[1:14:14] might say something wrong the church
[1:14:15] might be wrong they might say or do
[1:14:17] something wrong but the word is always
[1:14:21] right and so we speak in a way so that
[1:14:25] he can intercede for us right right
[1:14:28] right when you say well I'm not I'm not
[1:14:31] worthy he can't intercede on
[1:14:35] that I'm I I I'm I've been too I've done
[1:14:38] too many bad things I can't be saved he
[1:14:40] can't intercede on that what does he
[1:14:42] intercede on our faith our confession
[1:14:45] are you still with me this morning I got
[1:14:47] a few more
[1:14:50] minutes he's the high priest of our
[1:14:52] confession sitting there making in
[1:14:55] intercession on your confession what you
[1:14:58] believe brother brandom said all of you
[1:15:01] in here that's saved tonight you just
[1:15:02] get in your head you're not saved and go
[1:15:05] around saying no I'm not saved no more
[1:15:08] he said then you're not
[1:15:10] saved come
[1:15:12] on he said that's a big word for a
[1:15:14] Baptist isn't it but that's true your
[1:15:15] backslid whenever you do that right
[1:15:18] that's right he said I believe you can
[1:15:19] backslide see but you've got to have
[1:15:21] your testimony your confession positive
[1:15:24] not according to my feelings but
[1:15:27] according to what he
[1:15:32] said good look
[1:15:35] planets
[1:15:37] materialized based on what he said now
[1:15:39] we either believe that or we don't right
[1:15:42] everything we saw the other day happened
[1:15:44] because God
[1:15:46] said let there be
[1:15:49] light and there
[1:15:51] was right now if planets
[1:15:55] respond to a positive confession of the
[1:15:59] word what will our body do which is made
[1:16:04] from the dust of the earth when we have
[1:16:07] a a positive uh confession of the word
[1:16:10] now brother now it's a strange thing
[1:16:12] that this is so much the thought of
[1:16:13] people they say well I'm weak my faith
[1:16:15] is not very much I'm not a very good
[1:16:17] Christian that's just what the devil
[1:16:19] wants you to say you're just talking his
[1:16:22] language right then you mustn't never
[1:16:24] say that I believe we got to be positive
[1:16:26] not just about ourselves but about our
[1:16:27] church body let's be positive about one
[1:16:30] another don't let your testimony be
[1:16:33] negative let it be positive all the time
[1:16:36] someone say all the time I am saved I
[1:16:39] have God in my heart I believe him with
[1:16:41] all my heart you believe in Divine
[1:16:43] Healing with all of my heart you said my
[1:16:45] brother Ben I struggle with depression
[1:16:46] so did brother
[1:16:48] brandom he called it the blues every
[1:16:50] seven years he'd struggle with that but
[1:16:52] he said I'm saved anyway I'm Healed
[1:16:54] anyway I believe anyway I'm going to
[1:16:56] keep preaching anyway I'm going to do
[1:16:58] what's right
[1:17:00] anyway God didn't cast him away from
[1:17:02] being a prophet because he got down
[1:17:05] sometimes we all get down sometimes but
[1:17:08] it's what we believe it's what we
[1:17:10] confess sir he said let your testimony
[1:17:12] always your thoughts everything never
[1:17:14] permit a negative thought to come in
[1:17:15] your mind if you can help it sir he said
[1:17:18] when it starts that don't entertain
[1:17:21] it so in other words set up boundaries
[1:17:24] where for to come in if you can help in
[1:17:26] other words don't listen to bad stuff on
[1:17:28] purpose right worst thing you can do
[1:17:31] sometimes when you got something wrong
[1:17:32] with you is go on the
[1:17:33] internet and research
[1:17:37] it that cold can turn into cancer real
[1:17:43] quick
[1:17:45] right and you can really there could be
[1:17:47] a real problem for you he said don't ENT
[1:17:50] don't don't don't let it come in now but
[1:17:51] if you if it comes in because we all
[1:17:54] know the devil has access to our minds
[1:17:56] it's a Battleground he says if it comes
[1:18:00] in don't entertain
[1:18:01] it right and I preached about that many
[1:18:04] times but you get that thought flies
[1:18:05] over and you set up a nest for
[1:18:09] it got a little
[1:18:11] birdhouse for negative
[1:18:14] thoughts
[1:18:16] right we had a squirrel problem here a
[1:18:18] while ago at our house squirrel problem
[1:18:21] you know why we had a squirrel problem
[1:18:22] we had a squirrel feeder
[1:18:29] that's why we had a squirrel problem and
[1:18:31] so the squirrels were messing up
[1:18:32] everything brother Danny and I finally
[1:18:34] said why are we putting corn in the
[1:18:36] squirrel
[1:18:38] feeder they got they got stuff all over
[1:18:40] the porch they it just made a mess of
[1:18:42] everything made the dogs bark all the
[1:18:44] time and all we had to do brother Caleb
[1:18:47] is quit putting corn in the squirrel
[1:18:49] feeder and the bird or the squirrels
[1:18:50] didn't come back no more quit making a
[1:18:53] bird house for that negative thought to
[1:18:55] fly in and come take
[1:18:58] possession
[1:18:59] right don't entertain it pass it on amen
[1:19:03] he said you can't help you can't help
[1:19:05] thoughts when they come he said well you
[1:19:06] say I can't help the thoughts from
[1:19:07] coming said be like the farmer said he
[1:19:08] couldn't stop the birds from flying over
[1:19:10] his place but it could sure stop them
[1:19:11] from roosting you can't help the
[1:19:13] thoughts when they come but don't
[1:19:14] entertain them just pass it on no sir
[1:19:16] Jesus Christ is my savior All Things Are
[1:19:19] Mine by God I'm going to keep them I'm
[1:19:21] going to testify of them and God can
[1:19:24] only bless you as you confessed it he
[1:19:26] has done it for you see he's the high
[1:19:28] priest of our confession is that right
[1:19:30] he said he's the high priest of our
[1:19:31] confession he can only do for us as we
[1:19:34] accept it and believe it and confess it
[1:19:37] amen hallelujah he say Well when Jesus
[1:19:40] was here people didn't have to have
[1:19:42] faith well that's not
[1:19:44] true what would he tell them he said
[1:19:47] according to your
[1:19:48] faith right they were only healed
[1:19:51] according to their faith in the word he
[1:19:52] was the word
[1:19:54] now watch when Jesus departed then in
[1:19:57] Matthew 9:27 two blind men fought him
[1:19:59] crying saying thou son of David have
[1:20:00] mercy on us and when he was coming to
[1:20:03] the house the Blind Men came to him and
[1:20:04] Jesus said unto them believe you that
[1:20:06] I'm able to do this they said to him yay
[1:20:07] Lord then touch ye their eyes saying
[1:20:09] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:20:13] according to your faith be it unto you
[1:20:16] and you might say this this morning you
[1:20:18] might say well if Faith was enough why
[1:20:19] why did he touch them now hang with me
[1:20:22] for just a minute have you got a few
[1:20:23] more minutes I've got a a few more
[1:20:25] minutes
[1:20:28] so why did he touch them why do the
[1:20:30] woman have to touch the himem of His
[1:20:32] Garment now we know she touched you by
[1:20:34] faith why do we have prayer claws why do
[1:20:37] we have prayer lines Why why do we do
[1:20:39] that we just take it all by faith now we
[1:20:43] know in the beginning before the spoken
[1:20:45] word could take effect there was
[1:20:47] something else happening how how many
[1:20:49] know Genesis
[1:20:51] 1:1 right in the beginning God created
[1:20:53] the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth
[1:20:54] was without form and void and darkness
[1:20:57] was upon the face of the deep and the
[1:20:59] spirit of God Amen moved moved upon the
[1:21:04] face of the waters that word moved and I
[1:21:07] preached it many times but that word is
[1:21:09] the same word you find in Deuteronomy
[1:21:11] where it says as the eagle stirreth its
[1:21:13] nest yeah flut over her young fluth is
[1:21:17] moved Broods Broods over amen the eagle
[1:21:22] Broods over young the spirit of God
[1:21:24] rooted over the Earth and God said let
[1:21:28] there be light and there was light now
[1:21:32] brother brandom says your bodies was
[1:21:33] laying here when the Holy Ghost began to
[1:21:35] brood in the first place if it didn't
[1:21:37] where did it come from your your all
[1:21:38] these materials he said Patrol life here
[1:21:40] on the earth God has put you together no
[1:21:42] one else could do it you can't get potes
[1:21:44] and calcium and pull it together and
[1:21:45] make a man it takes the spirit of the
[1:21:47] life of God to come into the man to make
[1:21:48] him what he is he said my friends don't
[1:21:51] you be deceived God doesn't run his
[1:21:52] church upon intellectuals it's the
[1:21:54] brooding of the Holy Ghost so it's not
[1:21:57] you just saying well I I have faith I
[1:21:58] have faith I have faith no God Broods by
[1:22:01] the Holy Spirit In Our Lives what is he
[1:22:03] doing he's creating an atmosphere of
[1:22:07] Faith right now watch it's the brooding
[1:22:11] of the Holy Ghost trying to say Do You
[1:22:12] Love Me Do You Believe
[1:22:15] Me Hallelujah and he said if he brought
[1:22:19] me what I am without me having any
[1:22:21] choice how much more will he give me
[1:22:23] back my life with eternal life with it
[1:22:26] if I brood back to him and say Yes Holy
[1:22:29] Spirit I don't care what the world says
[1:22:30] I love you I love you I love you oh if
[1:22:32] we can only do that this morning Lord I
[1:22:34] love you I'm brooding back to you if
[1:22:36] there's a response if he could bring me
[1:22:38] here naturally without a response how
[1:22:40] much more could he bring me spiritually
[1:22:43] with a response when I respond to the
[1:22:45] word of God I say yes Lord do you
[1:22:47] realize how much better Services you
[1:22:49] could have if you just respond with a
[1:22:51] positive confession to the word and say
[1:22:53] I believe what the prophet said I
[1:22:55] believe what my pastor's preaching I
[1:22:57] believe what the word says I believe
[1:22:59] it's the truth if you have a positive
[1:23:01] confession say Amen once in a while I
[1:23:04] know in the back I can't hear their
[1:23:05] amens so they've made amen signs back
[1:23:08] there there it
[1:23:10] is what is that it's a positive
[1:23:14] confession and Y all sitting out here
[1:23:16] you don't have to have a sign but you
[1:23:17] can you can sit here and say Amen what
[1:23:20] am I saying I'm broing back to him I'm
[1:23:22] not saying that for the preacher I'm
[1:23:23] saying that for the to the word
[1:23:25] word Jesus I love you Holy Spirit I
[1:23:28] don't care what the world says I love
[1:23:29] you I love you I love you how much more
[1:23:32] will he watch the calcium and poish in
[1:23:34] that great day he will speak and that
[1:23:36] body flash back again every hair on the
[1:23:39] head every bit of the oh I love that let
[1:23:42] me just stop there a
[1:23:44] while I don't mean as much to some of
[1:23:46] y'all as it does to
[1:23:49] me oh but every hair on my head if
[1:23:52] listen if he's brooding over the if he
[1:23:53] brooded over the the Earth without my
[1:23:55] choice without me having a choice to
[1:23:58] respond he broed over the Earth and
[1:23:59] brought me out of the Earth how much
[1:24:01] more can he brw over my body and bring
[1:24:03] my hair back like it
[1:24:05] was Hallelujah did you believe he can do
[1:24:09] that absolutely he
[1:24:11] can I've seen him do it I've seen him do
[1:24:14] it naturally and I believe one day he'll
[1:24:16] do it by the by a new
[1:24:18] body he'll do it that way every hair on
[1:24:22] my head every bit of the strength that
[1:24:25] was in my body when The Immortal Life
[1:24:27] will come forth again he said yes
[1:24:30] brother God gave the Holy Ghost a job of
[1:24:31] taking care of the
[1:24:33] church right we can only speak Faith as
[1:24:37] his spirit moves us right does that make
[1:24:41] sense we our positive confession is not
[1:24:43] just a dry-eyed confession it's not just
[1:24:45] saying well it's not a it's not an
[1:24:47] intellectual confession but it's a
[1:24:48] confession being moved being
[1:24:50] inspired by the brooding of the Holy
[1:24:53] Ghost
[1:24:56] and we know when the evil spirit goes
[1:24:57] out of a man he walks in dry
[1:24:59] places and brother Bram talks about that
[1:25:02] he said the reason you have your ups and
[1:25:03] downs is when the unclean Spirit goes
[1:25:05] out that's just as far as you go you get
[1:25:08] a new heart or something other words you
[1:25:10] clean things up you got a face to show
[1:25:13] you got something you put on a little
[1:25:14] something outside and when he comes back
[1:25:17] he finds you still living in an old Tin
[1:25:19] Can Alley with all your temper all your
[1:25:22] indifference yes and
[1:25:26] everything now I'm just going to
[1:25:28] illustrate this we had a a man when I
[1:25:31] was growing up named Bob
[1:25:33] ma bob ma may have been the the smartest
[1:25:36] man and the wealthiest man in Vernon
[1:25:40] County he was he was quite a man and he
[1:25:44] he was a if you talk to him he was a
[1:25:46] very intellectual man he was a college
[1:25:49] graduate and he he was a a nice man had
[1:25:52] a good character about him but I watched
[1:25:55] Bob maber over the years growing up yeah
[1:25:58] and he inherited a house from his
[1:25:59] parents yeah and Bob ma had a problem
[1:26:03] and thus said he couldn't quit picking
[1:26:05] up other people's
[1:26:08] trash so what he would do is he would go
[1:26:11] and he would go down the street and he
[1:26:13] had an old station wagon that he drove
[1:26:16] uh and and had a bike rack on top of it
[1:26:18] I believe if I'm remembering correctly
[1:26:20] an old car and he would drive down the
[1:26:22] road whenever he'd see trash he felt
[1:26:24] compelled to pick it up so he picked up
[1:26:27] 10 cans and he picked up he picked up
[1:26:30] garbage and he picked up newspapers
[1:26:33] hundreds and hundreds of newspapers and
[1:26:36] he picked up he picked up soda cans and
[1:26:39] he was always by the side of the road
[1:26:41] and it obsessed him so much he never got
[1:26:43] married he never his house literally
[1:26:47] fell down around him as the as the piles
[1:26:51] of trash got bigger his house got
[1:26:54] smaller or at least it appeared that
[1:26:57] way and his roof fell in he put a tarp
[1:27:00] over it and kept picking up trash that's
[1:27:03] right his his electricity got turned off
[1:27:06] he he he just lit a candle and kept
[1:27:09] picking up trash his car quit working he
[1:27:12] rode a
[1:27:13] bike and kept picking up
[1:27:16] trash and he lived to be I think 80
[1:27:18] something years old and he finally
[1:27:20] died by getting hit by a car ironically
[1:27:24] on the side of the road picking up
[1:27:26] trash not his own trash other people's
[1:27:32] trash
[1:27:34] now I'm going somewhere with
[1:27:38] this see the devil finds us living in
[1:27:41] tenan alley and the reason we can't keep
[1:27:44] the victory is because we go around
[1:27:47] picking up everybody else is
[1:27:52] trash woo I had some
[1:27:56] amens what is that negative thoughts
[1:27:59] negative
[1:28:01] testimonies they don't they don't love
[1:28:02] me they don't care about me yeah the
[1:28:05] preach that old preacher he don't he
[1:28:06] probably don't live it anyway that old
[1:28:08] that old song leader they don't like me
[1:28:10] they don't ever call on me that that old

[1:32:16] you how to unleash your positive
[1:32:17] confession let's look at this and I'll
[1:32:19] skip through this brother Robert I'm
[1:32:22] sorry but I got to save time the brand
[1:32:26] talked to him he said how many of you
[1:32:27] Believers is Believers raise your hand
[1:32:28] now this morning how many of you are
[1:32:29] believers I didn't ask if you were
[1:32:31] perfect but are you Believers God bless
[1:32:34] you for saying that he said then he he
[1:32:37] talked about how he said raise your hand
[1:32:40] and he talked he told them to put their
[1:32:41] hands on one another and and he's going
[1:32:42] to have them do as they told as he told
[1:32:44] them now he told them to be real quiet
[1:32:47] my brother BR says quiet in the message
[1:32:49] he said be be still be quiet a lot of
[1:32:51] times what he's talking about is he
[1:32:52] didn't want people moving around
[1:32:55] because the Holy Ghost was about to do
[1:32:56] something and I'll say this to in a
[1:32:59] service I know a lot of people don't
[1:33:01] want to interrupt the word so they wait
[1:33:02] till the till the altar call and then go
[1:33:05] out to the bathroom and I understand
[1:33:06] sometimes you have to do that but if you
[1:33:08] can it'd be better to go earlier
[1:33:10] interrupt me and interrupt the altar
[1:33:12] call if there is one because it's the
[1:33:14] spirit of God is moving at that time we
[1:33:16] need to be we need to recognize that try
[1:33:18] not to move around and that to you kids
[1:33:20] I I know sometimes we we we want to make
[1:33:23] sure that we don't interrupt the word
[1:33:25] and or but especially when the Holy
[1:33:27] Spirit is moving you watch that God
[1:33:29] might do something Supernatural
[1:33:31] someone's being prayed for close your
[1:33:33] close your eyes bow your head that's
[1:33:35] pray with them God might be doing
[1:33:37] something
[1:33:38] Supernatural I believe he does
[1:33:39] Supernatural
[1:33:41] things so he said brother Brown talked
[1:33:44] about how he's going to say the prayer
[1:33:45] he going to have them repeat it and he
[1:33:47] had them repeat this Lord God creator of
[1:33:49] heavens and earth author of everlasting
[1:33:51] life Giver of every good gift forgive my
[1:33:53] sins of unbelief give to me of thy mercy

[1:33:58] savior my only salvation I need your
[1:34:00] strength for my health I can't go
[1:34:02] forward without you I now accept you as
[1:34:04] my healer he said I renounce the devil
[1:34:06] in all of his works from this time hence
[1:34:09] forth I will think positive I will
[1:34:12] believe every promise the scripture that
[1:34:15] says by his stripes I was healed I now
[1:34:18] accept it I believe it it's
[1:34:20] mine said I thank you Lord I will
[1:34:23] continue to testifying of my healing
[1:34:25] until I'm perfectly
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:29] well now but he told him now they were
[1:34:32] testifying and they were saying it they
[1:34:33] repeated it but he said there was still
[1:34:36] something they needed to do he said now
[1:34:38] hold still keep your hands on one
[1:34:39] another you pray he said now shut
[1:34:40] yourself in with God you're going to see
[1:34:42] something happen he said all right
[1:34:44] brotherr ministers everybody are you
[1:34:45] ready if God will hear my prayer here he
[1:34:47] hears it anywhere he said now you prayed
[1:34:49] you made your confession just like you
[1:34:51] would coming as a Christian watch He's
[1:34:53] teaching healing the same way you
[1:34:54] believe as a Christian he said if if
[1:34:57] you're ready now he said if you was a
[1:34:59] sinner you're ready for baptism now
[1:35:01] being that you're a Christian you've
[1:35:02] made your confession right and now
[1:35:04] you're ready for healing so what what is
[1:35:06] it a confession you repent then you're
[1:35:08] baptized and then you receive the
[1:35:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost you confess
[1:35:12] your healing it's already been paid for
[1:35:14] and then you receive your healing right
[1:35:17] now he said what does it take now God is
[1:35:19] ready to give it to you there's just one
[1:35:21] thing above you that's a little thin
[1:35:24] Shadow of Doubt yeah now if we can break
[1:35:27] through that now he talked about how
[1:35:28] planes had to break through the jet Jets
[1:35:30] had to break through the sound barrier
[1:35:33] he said if they could ever get through
[1:35:34] he said they might wiggle and wobble but
[1:35:36] when they get through the sound barrier
[1:35:37] they fly smooth he said now if you can
[1:35:40] just rise yourself above that little
[1:35:42] doubt barrier there oh church that's
[1:35:44] what we that's what we need to do in our
[1:35:45] church services that's what we need to
[1:35:46] do in our homes rise up above that
[1:35:49] little doubt barrier oh brother what
[1:35:51] will take place you will run free you
[1:35:53] will be be healed he said I want you to
[1:35:55] be real reverent hold your hands to one
[1:35:56] another keep shut in with Christ like
[1:35:58] nobody is around you but him and just
[1:36:00] imagine your heart now you see him come
[1:36:02] walking right down to you standing right
[1:36:05] in front of you now open your heart and
[1:36:07] let him in he said well I pray and Cast
[1:36:10] Away this little Shadow Of Darkness over
[1:36:11] you when it breaks you out of the sound
[1:36:13] barrier then just rise and give him
[1:36:15] praise every time he said you when you
[1:36:16] feel your soul pass through that
[1:36:18] unbelief then you're free in Christ and
[1:36:21] he said heavenly father thank you for
[1:36:22] all that you've done for the many he and
[1:36:24] the fellowship and All Above All Things
[1:36:25] The Fellowship of the Holy Ghost he said

[1:36:29] told us the truth every time confirms
[1:36:31] your word with signs and wonders
