brother Timothy that was wonderful and also sister Allison what a what a reminder what a reminder Genesis chapter 17 verse one good to have you all with us today and uh it's always good to see smiling faces on Sunday morning isn't it I know it's a hassle sometimes to get to church and and it's a hassle to uh uh you know to just get yourself prepared for the service but once we get in here and see one another and and look at how wonderful God has been to us I think it's just a blessing it's just a blessing to us Genesis 17:1 and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect I love that brother brand said he just telling him Abram you're a baby in my sight draw string from me and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee pray Lord would that his Blessing to the word you may be seated we want to continue to talk about Abraham our father of Faith speak to you this morning on the placing of a son one of the most difficult things that brother brandham had to make the Pentecostal Church understand is that there was more to God than what they had and the reason it was difficult because what they had was so great it was not because what they had was something that was false initially although there was much false followed it but it was actually a real move of God that they had on isusa street and in Pentecost and they they had something real and it was something that uh that really uh uh God moved through and because they felt it they knew it they lived it it would be very hard to tell them well there's more than that because it experienced the blessings of God they'd experienc the the power of God they'd seen him open blind eyes they they'd seen him heal the sick they'd seen him make the crippled walk they'd seen Revival and and because of that they they they it was hard for them to understand because leoda was deceptive not because there was so much error in it but because there was so much truth in it and and because there was so much wealth in it because there was so much prosperity in it and And So It produced a satis isfaction as as you would if you went into the wheat field and you would walk into the wheat field and you'd see that there were uh almost mature wheat plants or even to the eye completely mature wheat you would see it out there and think oh my don't we have a wonderful crop there would be a satisfaction in that but yet that wouldn't be the fullness of it because it was yet another season to come there was the season of the growth of the word there was the season we call the bride a at the end time that that that seed would have to come to its maturity and so we don't want to be satisfied with yesterday we don't want to be satisfied with some other uh some other uh uh age or or the attributes of another age we don't want to look back and say well the message even used to be wonderful maybe we found out God sent a prophet but there's more to it than that maybe we found out God blessed this age with a with a prophetic Ministry but there's more to it than that God wants us as individuals to grow into the the powerhouses of his word he wants us to become the word of God to be to be living examples of his word to manifest his word and so in order to do that we've got to have a an understanding that there was more than just Pentecost there was more there was more and then when Abraham goes through his life he realized there's more than what I had I've got a calling I've been elected by God I've been justified by faith my life's cleaned up I'm I'm in a good place but there there's more than that and I'll say to you today if you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and and you believed on the word of God yet there's more than that today for you you say well brother Ben when is there not more well when we leave here there won't be anymore but that's why Ephesians 4 tells us that the ministry is called the the five-fold ministry as we call it is called until it says until we all come in the unity of the faith when will that be well it'll be when we go home God's going to make that statement when we go home yeah it's when the bride is fully mature until that time we are still waiting on the fullness of our Redemption now and yet what we have we can be satisfied with right yet we don't put a period on what we believe right how many times have we heard brother brandom say that we don't put a period on what we believe we want to learn we want to grow every one of us can learn something every one of us can grow up and become a little bit more mature and handle things a little bit better and and deal with people a little bit better he wants us to reach that place so it produces uh this age even can produce a satisfaction but yet we need to cry out to God and say Lord I want more we just come through wonderful meetings but Lord I want more of your presence I want more of you in my life I want more of your reality living in my everyday life I want more peace I want more joy that's good as the man said that was eating watermelon he said that was good but there's more of it right as long as there's more watermelon to eat let's eat the watermelon right sir so now the Pentecostal age and I don't want to minimize what it was because it was a great age God was displaying his attributes in a great way they had something real but it wasn't all there was so they produced the word or the seed the fruit of their age but they weren't the last age John 15 and five says I'm the vine you're the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing the Pentecostal age had fruit they fulfilled the word of God for their day but yet they didn't fulfill all the word of God because there was another age yet to come so there was something for us to fulfill now brother Brandon puts it this way he said the world is wanting to see Christ yeah the world is wanting to see Christ Jesus said I'm the vine ye are the branches and the branch Bears record of the vine because it draws its energy and life from the vine he said well the first Vine first branch that come from this Vine he said they wrote a book of Acts behind that Branch we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in that first church that church of Pentecost that original Pentecostal and he said then when we believe that if this original vine ever puts forth another Branch so he's talking about what happened on the day of Pentecost he said if that original vine ever puts forth another Branch they'll write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life that's in the vine right if the first Branch put forth a bunch of grapes right right so whatever we have now is going to look like what they had then right right that's why we don't just accept forms of worship that people impose on us right because whatever we have now has got to mimic what they had then just mimic it but reproduce it in our lives so he said if I'm getting just a little bit of feedback brother Gabe and he said if the first Branch put forth a bunch of grapes we find a bunch out here that's got watermelons growing on it or pumpkins or cucumbers we know that it isn't the life that's in the vine yes right so if you've got grapes over here you should have grapes over here if you've got grapes on the day of Pentecost you should have grapes in the bright age right right so if you got grapes over here and over here we got watermelons something happened he said we know that it isn't the life that's in the vine therefore I think he said even where we would call ourselves Pentecostals he said has failed to represent the real thing that Christ set us forth forth for us to represent the Holy Spirit and and the life of the spirit he said see we represent sometimes Sensations and we represent joy and that's good now watch it's going to it was close it was deceptive because it was close so our services will be Pentecostal Services if they're right right we know a dead Church isn't right it doesn't look like acts right right a dead Church doesn't look like acts a Pentecostal Church look like a if there's a deception in that that we've got to stay true to the word when the Pentecostal Church didn't so he said he said that that's good but there's more to it than that there's a fruit that goes with it that the hungry man oh my how many are hungry this morning that the hungry man is looking for a fruit of the spirit and this is the quality that was in Jesus oh that's a quality that I want this morning it's the quality that was in Jesus so we we found out that Abraham's Royal seed goes through the same stages that Abraham did brother brandom says we passed the first Junction justification sanctification he said now remember that was things that God promised and did to Abraham but here he said I am the breasted God right we talked about that Wednesday night Eli excuse me now you're old Abraham you're a hundred years old but to me you're no more than a baby so I give you a promise I am the breasted God I am the strong one lean upon my bosom now and nurse for me my strength into your weak body getting him ready for the miracle you might say brother Ben I don't know how I can come from this place where I am to a place of rapturing faith I don't know how I can come from this place of doubt and to Healing how can I come from this place of of being a sinner to being a Christian lean on him nurse from him amen draw from him draw strength from him and you can become what God called you to be yes Abraham you want to have your Miracle are we looking for miracle in this day we what are we looking for a change of the body we want to have a miracle what are we going to do draw from him and you realize every service that we have where we feel the presence of God it's just a down payment on one to come every time we get together and see a Unity among the Brethren it's a down payment on a time to come every time we feel the presence of God Among Us every time we hear the word preach it's just a little bitty Shadow brother B it's a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of something to come but we're feeling effects of another land I say there's more for us today there's more for us don't be satisfied with yesterday's gospel there's more we can't let anything stop us yeah there's more let's be big picture Christians right let's look at the big picture yeah I could stop here and fight with this one or stop here and fuss with this one but there's more for me I I could I could raise a a fuss about this or I could go around here and I can pick at this or criticize this but there's more for me oh how many believe it this morning there's more for me I'm I'm weak now but I know there's strength I I may be sick now but I know that there's healing I may be in an old body now but I know that there's a new body coming amen hallelujah nurse from me my strength into your weak body getting him ready for the miracle he said that's what he done to the Pentecostals after Wesley age he let the Pentecostals nurse his own strength his own Holy Spirit as a baptism back into their weak bodies to give them faith for the Rapture to give them faith for miracles I'm El Shai oh my so we still need that now remember there are people in all these stages in the church body so you you can't it's like well we only need the word because well some of us still need Pentecost I dare say we all do but we need the word too right without the word we can't mature but some of us still need Pentecost we still need gifts we still need men we still need people who pray we still need a prayer life yeah right we still need a home life we still the word has not replaced those things right right but it draws us to those things and calls us to those things so there are but we have people in all those stages our young people need a their own Revival every generation has to have their their own Revival we don't need to get in the way of them having their Revival right our our elders sometime we need a we need a rebaptism of the Holy Ghost we need that all right we need to draw strength from Eli but yet we know there's more there's coming a placing of a church are you with me now we're being placed in this age in the land that God give us now now he said he gave the church he said like the like the I don't know where I'm at now he said now in the 17th chapter he gave the Holy Spirit he said notice I am El should I remember he's going to receive something into him now from God strength like the Baby draws the mother's own strength from the body of the mother through nursing the church was given the holy ghost drawing the strength of the spirit into them nursing it back right so if you're trying to do away with the baptism of the Holy Ghost say well that was Pentecostal we need that anymore you're not getting any strength all right that's why the church is weak that's why the young people are leaving that's why there's no power in the house of God anymore is because you're not drawing from El Shi come on yes you with me now he gave the church the Holy Ghost to do that with the strength Giver his own strength God giving an outlet to his weak child that's confessed his faith to give him strength for something he's ready to do something for him now see you've got to draw strength before you can receive Revelation before you can be placed where God wants you to be you got to be strong enough to take it you got to be strong enough to fight the fight that's coming yeah how do you do that El Shai oh draw from him this morning draw from don't let anything stop you say Lord today I need strength let me draw from you let anything keep you from drawing from the body of God yeah the power and strength that you need we know we know that's a person Bram gets into that it's a person the Holy Ghost is a person we draw from him yeah the strength that we need so brother brandham taught us that justification was Genesis 12 sanctification Genesis 15 the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Genesis 17 but there were different things that happened in Genesis 17 to Abraham NOW Watch God's Own Strength brother R said nurse through a promise give it to the Pentecostals the holy ghost drawing God's own life right out into them he said as he did it natural there he does the spiritual here see to Abraham and his seed after him he said you get what I mean now and I remember the church is still advancing still advancing now each one of those organ those ages organized and died we don't want to organize and die right we're we're in we're in something that's moving we've got to be he said now I want you to look he said you who's putting down the scripture the fourth and fifth verse he said after he had called him by justification Sanctified him through the blood of the Covenant give him his own life in the 17th chapter of the baptism of the Holy Ghost what comes next in Israel some of you Bible scholars he said the placing of a son so brother brandom identifies what we call adoption in Abraham's journey and adoption it's a word that when we think adoption we think bringing someone into the family making them a son or a daughter that's not what adoption is scripturally right that's what it is now today in our modern vernacular but adoption in the scriptures is not making someone a son but it's setting someone into sunship or or into headship position to where that person can begin to do the work of the family sir begin to do everything that the father could do right all the responsibilities that the father had he wants to pass on to his son when the baby when when the boy's a baby he doesn't give that responsibility to him he w Waits until the appointed time and at the appointed time he's deemed ready by tutors and governors right by the BR taught us that was the Holy Spirit until the appointed time that he's ready to receive the adoption so he identifies adoption now in the Old Testament brother BR said when a son was born in the family he was a son but he was not air yet he said see the father didn't know what the boy would be so he had a tutor I'm about a natural father he had a tutor over him to raise him to a certain age he said then the placing of a son let's look at it in the scripture Galatians chapter 4 and verse one this was something that I was going through Abraham anyway and the brothers dealt with adoption this last weekend if you were listening you know that they dealt with that extensively and so I was very pleased with that I believe it was the Lord because we were just coming into this teaching so Galatians 4 And1 it says now I say that the heir as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant and brother Shawn especially mentioned this on Saturday morning The Heir though he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all so he has the right to all of it but he's not yet given the inheritance because he is not ready for it yet right and so he differs nothing from a servant he's provided for but he doesn't have authority right yeah so verse two but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father yeah if you write in your underline that until the time appointed of the father yeah and I want to give you a sneak preview right here right so we don't get too far thinking well maybe that time will come we're in that time right as an age we're in that time individuals God deals with every individual differently but when it comes to the age we're in that time not just the age of being a son but the age of adoption all right it's just the time we live in so even so he said when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come so in other words there was a prophecy that was made there were all kinds of types all kinds of Shadows all kinds of things that were done are you with me this morning all kinds of uh form and ceremony that they went through but they were all speaking of something coming so Paul looks back at the law and he says that was the time of tutors and governors he said but when the fullness of the time was come and when the word become flesh are you with me now in a man called Jesus Christ when the word become flesh in God's son what was it that was the fullness of the time God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so brother Ron teaches that God did the same thing in Matthew the 17th chapter yeah he took Peter James and John went up on a high mountain upon a mountain was transfigured before them what was he doing he was showing the placing of a son brother bam deals with that in a message called to hear ye him in the message you can go listen to it yes but I'll read verse four Matthew 17:4 then answered Peter remember they all went up on the mountain and and here's Moses and Elijah Peter's just having a grand old time time to build a church you know in fact time to build three churches right let's build three Tabernacles and Peter said I'll build one here for Moses and one here for for Elijah and one here for Jesus I just I just make three persons in the godhead right Why Oh my he hadn't come he hadn't come to the full revelation of God yet right there's a there church there's a powerful teaching in here look he hadn't come to the full revelation of who God was and so he looked said well let let's just make three Tabernacles and while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them Behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son yes in whom I am well pleased hear ye him so it was God adopting his son not making him part of the family he was already part of the family he was already God in flesh but acknowledging that he had the same Authority as his father yeah so again there's a example in Jacob and Esau the Bible teaches that Jacob had the blessing and the birthright but he still needed to wrestle with the angel yes right and this is where when I say there's something more and I'm just comfortable to this morning preaching to you but there's there's something more for us we we don't want to stop because we have the blessing all right we don't want to stop when we just know that we're elected right right we don't want to just stop even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost we want that but we want more yeah we want more and so there's got to be something in your life that that that keeps crying out for God God I want more I want to I want to be more dedicated I want to be more sincere what did the angel tell brother brandom he said if you want to see these things you got to be more more sincere if you want to see healing you got to be more sincere you want to see Deliverance you got to be more sincere so we're we're firm in our election we know where we come from Abraham knew he was called by God he didn't doubt God he didn't stagger at the promise and yet he said I know that there's more for me and I would say to every one of us this morning that's still the case with us there's more for us so here comes we don't want to stop short of that here comes Jesus uh into the same place and brother random tied that to Abraham received his new name becoming Abraham when he had been when he had been Abram now pom talks about Jacob and Esau and Jacob and the birthright and how he needed to wrestle with the angel listen what he said he said Pentecost there is where you failed you thought because you were born of the spirit born of the spirit of God the birth right that settled it but only starts it yeah sir see and brother M goes on to say that the child would not become an air it's a fascinating statement he said unless he was interested in his father's work come on Church we're not it's not just we we're teaching Grace but we're teaching Grace that comes with responsibility and Grace that comes with with dedication and Grace that comes by because of his grace not because we could work our way into it but because of his grace there's a reality of of what we must do and who we are so it brings a it brings a you know there are religions that are easy and there's those that are hard you know I've always looked at the cath Catholicism is a hard religion but for someone who's a legalist it becomes easy because what happens is they feel they can never compensate so if I do these things I'll be okay right if I go say my novenas if I do say my certain prayers and the church is going to tell me what to say what to pray and when to have church and I knew Catholics that went every day I knew a man he was a good he's passed away now in our hometown uh he went every every day he went to church Mr Peterman he went to church every single day Smoked Cigarettes he uh he was a uh he would talk about getting drunk at the Nights of Columbus rallies and laugh about it but he he was otherwise a moral man but he had these things in his life but he went every day because he thought well if I do those things but there's no maturity in that right there there's no responsibility in that right it's like you telling your kid every little thing to do but you don't want to do that when they're 40 come on some of y'all know cuz say Amen to that you don't want to have to do that when they're 40 right you want them to have lived you don't teach them how to ride a bik no more not teach them how to walk every little step but no more you want them to take that step on their own oh I hope you're hearing me now and God will still help us when we're weak and when we're needy and but he wants us to start taking those steps right he wants us to become an heir that's until we know that we can speak and things will happen amen yes he said now he said so when the Holy Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people and they begin to restore back the gifts and things within the church they thought because they were born of the spirit that settled it but you see there is a placing of a son right and after this son proved to be a real son and he was taken in a public place and then was set up and changed robes and set up there and then there was a placing of the Sun he had heir of everything someone say everything the father had and he said God did the same thing by his son on Mount Transfiguration so he's doing that for Abraham in chapter 17 now he said how many understands that when he was El Shai that he gave his own strengthened Abraham he never done nothing but made him promises promises but here he's emptying himself out into Abraham literally he said well that was the Holy Ghost justification is what you believe sanctification is what the blood did for you you're sanctified by believing but when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's the person of the Holy Ghost himself oh the person not imagination not some kind of psychology but the person of the Holy Ghost yes so he said he nursed not from the Articles and from the promises but he had now the literal life of God flowing into him right it's more than just knowing the message and some of you could testify of this some of you are like encyclopedias you know the message but you can so know the message in such a way way the devil can use that against you right sir I'm saying you should know it but he can also use that against you if you're strong in that way he'll take that very strength and he'll use the word against you because he's a master of it he knows it better than any of us right right he'll use it against your mind you use it against your it'll make you feel like that the message is something other than what it is right and so You' got to have the life of the Holy Ghost Inside of You the literal Life of Christ to make it live not just the articles and the promises but now the literal life of God flowing into him that's what the Pentecostal age done he said now what did he become then a son yes what did he do again he said he placed the law his own law of adoption upon his son I know I'm reading a lot but I got to get through this because we're going to get to something wonderful after a while if I have time he said there there's Moses I talked to Moses there's the law there's the prophets but this is my son the law of adoption he said well that's exactly what God did to Abraham his son before that after Abraham had been ified by faith he said the next thing was then what did he do next thing was sanctification by the blood the sanctification by the blood to the seed next thing was nursing God's Own Strength In him taking God's Own Strength into his church what he did to Abraham he did to his seed after him he said what a word of encouragement to an old man 100 years old tell him he was El Shi now I give you the strength I'm going to place you with me now I'm the father of all creation my name is Elohim this is important my name is Elohim anyone knows that the word Elohim means the alls sufficient one the great self-existing one Elohim my name is Elohim and your name is Abram and you'll not no longer be called Abram but you shall be called Abraham Abraham watch from Elohim to Abraham he give him part of his own name sir oh Hallelujah when he placed it he said notice Abraham in his seat he said now when God get got the Pentecostal Church raised he began to place them giving them gifts and so forth placing them into the kingdom but everybody wanted to have the same gift he said oh my there we went all right right yes he says so that don't stop God's seed Hallelujah that don't stop Abraham seed it goes on just the same he said notice Elohim Abra give him part of his own name because why I made you the father of Nations a father I've made you a father of many nations and I'll put part of my name with your name Oh my he said oh how I could squeeze something right here now he said give him part of that name Abraham changed Sarah's name because she was a part of Abraham oh my it wasn't just Abraham got his name changed it was Sarah also but watch what he did with Abraham Abraham was the messenger of that time brother brandham in fact if you don't really understand this if you if you just look at it casually you might wonder why does brother Brown make such a big deal about the messenger and how many letters were in his name now if you've heard the message you know that brother Braham dwells on that right he said we've had a Graham Billy Graham a messenger to the church g r a h a m six letters right but he said Abraham amen once he had a part of God's name wasn't six letters but it was seven letters right a b r a h a m brother bandam dwells on that he tells it over and over again well I mean you just look at brother brandom's name right b r a n h a m now God was showing us something he's showing us something brother B taught that all through especially towards the end of of the message he says this he said it's exactly with Luther Wesley on down to here just exactly how he's dealt with the churches like he did with Abraham how he appeared how that there when he confirmed the Covenant to him under the shed blood he said it was the Philadelphian age remember that was back in chapter 15 he said but then watch the Pentecostal age after he come to there he made the promise of elai nurse for me but now oh Church see if the Pentecostal age had nursed they would be us yeah right if they had kept oh god brother Bram says that he he talked about how the wans had kept on the way they were going if they kept right and not denominated they would have become the Pentecostals and the ones that did move on did right if the Pentecostals oh my had just continued to nurse from elai the thing is they would have become the bride yes but they didn't do it right Oh my he said the question is can you nurse that's still the question this morning right oh church can you draw strength from the Holy Ghost for the hour that you're living in not yesterday's promises but today's promises not somebody else's word but the word of God for you can you draw strength and become a mature son or daughter of God hallelujah he said can you draw strength can you nurse oh my oh my that's still the question can you nurse yes he said but they didn't do it they grabbed them a breast from the denomination where they come out of but then the seed real seed come on to nurse that breast oh that's that's us church he said Abraham you're a son but I'm going to give you part of my name I'm going to place you in my family amen oh my it's one who has Authority yeah oh my brother brandom says after the appearing in this name of almighty God we talked about that Wednesday night what was the name brother Brandon said El Shai he appeared to Abraham as El should I what he appear to us as Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ that's the name he said do all in that name he appeared to Abraham in the name of el Shai or the almighty God also it's translated Elohim right the god the almighty God the breasted God the the breasted Elohim the almighty Elohim oh my come on now watch he said he was it was revealed to him he was the all sufficient one sir he had no helpers yeah God didn't he didn't need any right any secretaries he was alone he was God alone and he appeared to Abraham in this name and while he appeared to him in this name and Abraham recognized who he was all right oh I love this he changed Abraham's name he said now he's come to the fullness of believing now yes what's so important Abraham coming to the fullness of believing that's where you and I have to come to brother Caleb is the fullness of believing right what do we lack faith we lack the the believing part because we can't do it on our own we need to do it so we got to believe him and Abraham believed God it was imputed for righteousness because Abraham believed God he did the works of God now watch Abraham recognized who he was he changed Abraham's name now he's come to the fullness of believing now see where the church has come he said I hope you can read between the lines come up to the place where he's revealed to him who he was and then he changed Abraham's name so that the promise could be fulfilled right notice he changed his name here now for from Abram to Abraham which means father of Nations added the h m Abraham so he did this so that the oh church he did this so that the complete promise could be fulfilled and the sun now that had been promised so long could be seen or otherwise be revealed when he changed his name and after he recognized who he was now we know that adoption is it all right if we just lay something in here for a minute and then we'll move on we know adoption is not a fourth work of Grace right it's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in This age but the message we've received is an adoption message so if you're born again in this word age right those who were born again in Luther's day believe Luther's message those who are born again in Wesley's they believe Wesley's message if you're born again in the word in this age yes that's the age you live in then this is the age of adoption so now you've received an adoption in this age so this age calls us to a a higher calling than any other age a higher state of maturity than any other age and that's why it gets narrower towards the top because many can't take it right the regular the world can't take it but we're the Bri we're called to something better called something more and I realize we struggle with what everybody else struggles with I realize we're human beings I realize we we're just like everybody else when it comes to what we struggle with but God's not looking at your struggles he's looking at the seed right and we are not called to stop short of the promises of God we are not an age that lays back and rests on our Laurels we're not looking back at what yesterday was and saying we're only going to make it in by the skin of our teeth but we're pressing forward into something what are we reaching for maturity adoption full adop full Redemption Hallelujah brother Sean put it so well Saturday morning what is that the change of the body the Rapture all right amen hallelujah message we've received is an adoption message if you're born again now and you see the person of the Christ Living in you you've been adopted in the family your name is good on the checkbook I think it's about time when we started acting like it don't you this is manifesting time this is again not every everybody's in the same place but but we ought to be reaching a place of of of of where and I'll say it this way we ought to be reaching a place where we're not being bossed around by our circumstances but we're the boss of our circumstances we're not being bossed around by by by everything that's happening to us but we become the Bo he said how can I do that I can't help what's happening to me but you also you have a conduit a channel you got Authority from the father I may I may feel depression but I won't let depression get me down I may feel sick but I won't let sickness get me down I may oh church I may feel confusion but I won't let confusion stop me come on are you with me now I feel anxiety it's for real I feel it but I won't let it stop me why I've coming to an age of maturity yes sir yes yes Hallelujah that's what Pentecost missed because they had gifts they had anointing and they had power but they didn't know what to do with it and it didn't just didn't manifest in their lives but it's time brother Brandon said God's only provided planned for his age Hallelujah his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark lit off of something to make it alive and seated now in Heavenly places in present tense already alive already alive subject to every promise someone say every promise that's the age you live in sir right the promises lay in the land we preached on many times we are in the land our adoption we can say it this way is an open book yes right the Bible was closed the opening of the seals opened mysteries in the Bible and what does that make it makes an open book so now you know the difference in a closed book test and open book test right right you have the answers all right that's a big deal when you're taking a test that's hard and every one of us are being tested right when you're taking it it's a big deal to have the answers and the answers are not in a person the answers are not in a church the answers are not in a minister come on Church the answer is Christ the word it's the message of the hour that's our answer oh Church we're not talking we're talking about the message we're not talking about some form or some well I listen to some tapes or I heard I heard brother brandom I met brother Brandon one time or something like that that's wonderful but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the word that he brought that's the maturity that we've come to where it's an open book to us he said brother brand talk speaking of the token we're going to get into the token maybe a little bit later if the Lord allows us to he said now we have a token in this day we've been given a token which is an antitype of that type that natural token that's back there in Egypt he said we've been given the supernatural Supreme token he said all that that foreshadowed is been given to this generation glory to God has been given this the token amen hallelujah the brother brandom taught us the token couldn't come in existence until the evening time because it's the age of the fullness of the word yeah he said now we have the Holy Ghost is our token it's our identification we've accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus just a human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in flesh it brought back upon us the adoption of sons and now we are Sons and Daughters of God that is the token glory to God it's our identification of the Passover it's our identification we have believed God and God has accepted so it's not a fourth work of Grace but in this hour are you with me now when you receive the the the true baptism of the Holy Ghost God's moving you up higher you're not just remaining in a Pentecostal age now watch back there they didn't have the gospel as we have it today was taught in forms it went through rituals because the Holy Spirit wasn't given but today we have the substance right we don't just have the form or just the chemicals you could not take the blood of Jesus Christ and apply it to every heart but God sent back the holy ghost that the token was upon the human in the human's heart and that is your identification you've accepted God's plan met Jehovah's requirements he met them for you at Calvary and you have met them on your knees and God has given you the token sign the return of the spirit was upon Christ is in you and a guarantee identification of his life D death burial and resurrection and a life more now in the believing church are you with me so far so the token could not come into existence till the evening time the B said it's been the lamb all the way through was the lamb in Luther's time was the lamb in Wesley's time now it's token time each house must be covered by the token so Abraham was given the revelation of God's name before his placing as a son he was shown God's name and then God put his name in Abraham's name now I want to dwell on something for a moment B that we know we realize that in this he was called Elohim Elohim the word in the translation means Elohim just looked up Elohim he's talking about El Shai the almighty God Elohim he said Elohim is the all sufficient one he is El Shai Elohim the breasted God all sufficient one he needs nothing from nobody else he is your all sufficiency sir now if we back up to adoption before you can be placed in in uh as a son or a daughter of God you got to go through trials tests that's that's what we go through that's life and in this age maybe you could say it like this well there's more pressure than any other age because this is the age of full maturity so it's like a son you know he comes to a certain age when you're he's a baby you expect him to be a baby but Paul says when I become a man I put away childish things right that's what he's trying to tell the Corinthian Church so this is an age of adoption it's an age of rapture right so we've been required to go through many trials yes I believe this is an age where he won't rest until we come to where we ought to be right and that's why sometimes it seems like he deals so severely with us but it's not that he's dealing severely with us but he's getting us ready the harder the trial gets the closer you're getting to the finish right right you don't give a mini trial to a to a an adult you give a mini trial to the baby right but you give a full-blown trial to the adult the ones that that's about to be adopted in the family hallelujah look how you say brother Ben I don't how much training will there be enough right and and I can't say how much that is in anyone's life how much will there be in enough right whatever it takes to get you where God wants you to be he does not waste a trial he does not waste listen he does not waste a bad decision you make God don't waste it all they made a bad decision what am I going to do now he knew you'd make it but what did he do he corrects you right he come make brings you out stronger than you were before because he don't have the luxury as we preach long AG go of letting you fail you're more than just a servant you're a son you're a daughter Hallelujah so he lets you go through the trial and when you get to the end you come out smelling like a rose and you say how what happened to me but you say well where is the end well when it's over but during the test oh Church you just realized this today during the test what's he telling Abraham Elohim is sufficient he is oh church he is sufficient during the trial until we come to the fullness of our Redemption he is sufficient during l a to see you Hallelujah Paul's telling the Hebrews in Hebrews 12 run the race with patience and all those things he tells them this he said you've forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth I think we passed by that scripture too quickly let's let's stop right here for a minute let's pull over and look at this word scourges for a minute it's the same Greek word they use when pilate took Jesus we passed by scourgeth too quickly he scourged him that's the next scripture there in John chapter 19 and verse one pilate took him and scourged him what did he do to him he took a cat of Ninetails right right that had glass and and metal and wood tied bone tied into it and and they beat him with it till he was within an inch of his life until you could they they Stripped Away the the the flesh until you could see the internal organs beat him until it wasn't legal to beat him no more and then Paul takes that word and uses it he said when a when you're a son God pushes you to the Limit but not past it right on he takes you all the way until you think you can't take it no more I know some of you get tested in your offices you get tested as a deacon you get tested as a trustee you get tested in The Sound Room you get tested just in life right we put you through test and say well why why why is this pressure on me Well's because you're doing something for God but if he wants you to do it he will not push you past what you're able right right are you with me now you get tested as a preacher but he won't he won't test you you may think you're not able but there's still an ability there or you still wouldn't be letting the pressure come on the same thing in sickness in our bodies we get sick and we think oh I just can't take it I can't take it but he knew you could take it or he wouldn't have allowed you to have it because your healing is already paid for but every son who he loves he chasen and he scourgeth the the the limit that a human body can take sometimes put you through that the limit that a human mind can take sometimes and put you through that right to the Limit you say if he loved me he wouldn't do that no he does it because he loves you and it won't be easy but you'll make it right yes you say how can you say that the same way brother Brandon when they pass through the line remember what he would say you're healed if you can believe it and they come back and say brother Brown there was something that wasn't healed did you did you lie about that he said no I'm just telling him what the promis to say yeah he said I can't heal nobody you're already healed on Calvary but if you can believe it you're healed Hallelujah if you oh church if you can believe it you already made it if you can believe it the trial's already over if you can believe it youve already made it through all right it won't be easy but you'll make it see verse S says if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not words if you're not chastened if you don't endure that you're not even a son right but God knows what you can take now who is Elohim let's get into this for just a minute and then we'll we won't hold you all day Elohim is the self-existing one he's the one in Genesis 1 in the beginning God that's Elohim right that's brother brandom said before God was God he was Elohim self-sufficient right he created out of nothing yes he is church so before there was matter this is before now we know the Earth was without void and all that in verse two this before that right before whatever state the world was in before hope I'm not boring you today but the world was in a in a condition the world was in in a condition in Genesis 2 when there was no condition right right this God the concept of Elohim in Jewish thought is that not that Elohim because the Greeks believed that there was always matter and the gods arranged the matter but that's not what that's not what God did right that's not what Elohim did there was nothing but Elohim yeah right oh church and he created everything you realize every ingredient of your trial was created by Elohim every ingredient of your test everything that's went into your life was created by Elohim now he didn't he didn't make our decisions for us we did that the devil got into a lot of things right but ultimately it was created by Him the devil can only work with what God created Lucifer was a great Angel but he oh chch he could not create why because that was reserved for Elohim Hallelujah he existed before matter he existed before time he existed before your trial he existed before every cell of your body yeah even before it was in the dust of the earth yes he existed right and he created before there was ever a sail but the D to backside and caused cancer Elohim was there church oh my brother use the illustration of the mechanic he said that the little mechanic was trying to fix a problem he just couldn't get it fixed he said the car was a Chevy that's probably the the problem right there he said the car he never said that about Ford he trying to lighten you up the car was a Chevy and he said the the man the little mechanic just running around trying to fix it that's the way we do isn't it trying to fix it he's doing this here and did a little bit here and a little bit there and just never could get it done he said but here could come a man dressed in a nice suit and he said he walked down there looked at that mechanic for a while and he said can I help you he said yeah he said I can fix that for you how how can you fix it he said well he said just let me try he walked over there and He adjusted a couple of things here and He adjusted a couple of things there and it run beautifully he said well well how did you do that he said I designed it oh if your car is not running right today if if your life isn't running the way you want it to remember the design is here he's here that's what he was showing to Abraham he said I designed your trouble I designed the tri before there was ever any trouble before there was ever any trial I was there I am the almighty God I am Elohim and nothing is before me nurse from me Abraham if you need strength get it from me good brother brandom Ties That to job yes Job chapter 1 and vers verse one you'll find this uh in a sermon titled Jehovah Gyra number one in 1964 I believe is where he he ties This Together Job chapter 1 verse one there was a man in the land of us whose name was job there's job's name that man was perfect and upright and one that feared Elohim Elohim brother randam ties that together he said it's the same word what he told Abraham job made it through the test because he trusted Elohim and brother Bram gets into that it's actually Jehovah Gyra number two in 1964 he gets into that he said notice the same is testified here he said I was noticed this afternoon while I was studying in job job he in job he's called Elohim and job was ridiculed made fun of how what a picture today but job was resting in elohim's promise though after the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I shall I see God whom I shall see for myself resting in Elohim no matter what comes right sir now listen you said well I must be something wrong with me I'm being tested like I am that's not what he said he said job was the best man of his day he was the best man I believe you're the best people of the day job was the best man of his day the best man God had on Earth was job he told Satan there's none like him have you considered him Satan said yes everything comes easy for him break that hedge and let me have him I'll make him curse you to your face he done everything he could but he couldn't to God right oh when I read that I run around the room he done everything that he could but he couldn't I think some of us could testify to that today he done everything for the bill that he could but he couldn't he tried everything that he had in his swag of Tricks but he couldn't take out the promise out of my heart he done everything that he could but he couldn't he couldn't make J Curse God he made him question he made him say some things he shouldn't have said but he never made him curse God GL to God hallelujah sir Hallelujah job rested in that promise the guys come by and said now now where where is all that God you was talking about uhhuh he said look what you believe him to be this look what's going on now but he still rested and El Shi even no matter if his boils was breaking him out and his life was as good as gone he was sitting on an as sheep scraping his boils his wife said why don't you curse God and die he said thou speakest like a foolish woman he said oh my the lord gave and the Lord taken away blessed be the name of the Lord I trust in ello him though he destroys this body the skin worms eat it up yet in my flesh shall I see God sir I shall see for myself my eyes Shall Behold not another now listen job's received his promise he said I know my redeemer lives when Jesus died on the cross right brother BR said job come forth in Matthew 27 yeah Hallelujah when the saints Rose Hallelujah entered into the city you remember what happened Jesus Oh My we died there on the cross he went down into the regions of the lost and down into hell and he goes down the depths of hell he takes the keys away from Satan kicks him back down into hell a toothless keyless devil doesn't even have the keys to his own house and he comes back up Hallelujah as he's coming back up he goes to par Parise you remember the story he goes to paradise and he goes and knocks on the door and someone opens the door and he said who is it he said Ezekiel said there's the wheel in the middle of the wheel and Abraham said there's the one who was on the plane of mamry and here come job and job said this is my redeemer hallelujah what was it he was trusting waiting in that promise come on this is my redeemer this is the my and and job received his promise yes sir oh I believe there promise for us in this day we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a tweaking of an eye oh church this is the hour of manifested sons yeah 1 Peter 5:10 he said but the God of all Grace who has called you he's called us hasn't he he's called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after you suffered a while make you perfect that's mature establish strength and settle you yes this is the age of strength by the word Romans 8:15 I'm just going to read this and we'll close Romans 8:15 for you have not received the spirit of bondage begin to fear that you've received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beare witness with our spirit we are the children of God and if children and heirs HS of God join HS with Christ so be that we suffer with him watch the the Airship is dependent on the suffering oh Church God's doing something in your life that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God oh church this is just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow the Liberty that we have here the joy that we have here the power The Authority that God gives us is only a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of one to come we're going to be delivered Hallelujah Hallelujah from this old pest house this old body where where we would try to do good and evil is present from this body that makes so many mistakes we're going to be delivered one of these days oh that ought to make everybody run the AIS amen listen church we are not just a loud Baptist Church or a loud Pentecostal church or a quiet Pentecostal Church what are we we belong to God we're the children of God he's put his name in us he's put his strength in us hallelujah hallelujah we know the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption with the Redemption of our body listen the groaning of the soul is over but the groaning of the body and the spirit continues waiting for the adoption Hallelujah as long as we're in this body we'll Gran I find myself groaning more as I get older just making noises you know when you try to get up CU J She haven't experienced that yet but go oh my wife will say what is wrong with you years ago I got done preaching one time and I went to Josh swim' house after church and his uh grandmother-in-law I think was there and and I walked into the house and she's about 90 years old at the time and I walked in there and I kind of groaned you know because I'd been preaching and she said what's the matter with you you act like an old man we gran you know what the word groan means means to complain audibly I don't want to complain too much but sometimes we complain sure we do we want people to know what we're going through so we Gran it's okay it's part of our condition in this life it's to sigh under a heavy load you know what it also means to Grudge to Grudge and watch what James says in James 59 it's the same word go look it up same Greek word for Grudge is the same Greek word for groan and James says Grudge not one against another you're going to groan don't groan against each other you're going to complain sometimes don't complain against each other we're closing just is't that wonderful he said' it's okay you're going to complain sometimes let your complaint be made to God I believe the more mature we come the less we become the more our complaints change into promises just repeating the promises but we'd have complaints we're going to have complaints till we leave here he complained job complained he groaned in fact he uses that word in the scripture he groan he wanted answers but he knew no man could provide them only God and God never gave him a a direct answer but he just showed him that vision of a redeemer job stood there and said I know that my redeemer liveth and he that shall stand at the latter day that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth amen and though after my skin worms D look at that Faith you realize when he said this he was still covered in boils when he said this he was still sitting on the ash sheep when he said this he was right in the middle of his test this isn't at the end of The Book of Job it's in the middle it's right in the middle of the trial come on now all right oh but God reveals something to him whom I yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes shall be hold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me though the very DNA that I'm made of be consumed yet I know I'll see God they can drop me in the in the ocean they can burn my body till where there's nothing left over there can do whatever they want to but I know in whom I have believe in Hallelujah my eyes should be hold not another his Hope was in the resurrection and he saw him he said I am the resurrection and the life can you imagine what he felt like when he met him at the door of paradise yes brother Brandon tells us give us a little insight into musicians go ahead and come he said I see job raised up said that's my redeemer that I said I knew that lived and someday he would stand upon the Earth

persecution in this country before the Rapture but we might they do in other countries but if they burn this body in 15 minutes he Hallelujah cuz we go down with a revelation Hallelujah when we get a
