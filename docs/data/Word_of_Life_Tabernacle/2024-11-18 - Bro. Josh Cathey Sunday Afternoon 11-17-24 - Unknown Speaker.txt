made Victorious through the blood of Jesus Christ am God bless you all it's good to be here again good to see everybody it always feels good to come back one of my favorite churches to come to one of my favorite churches to fellowship with worship with and I just like to say how about that message this morning how was that that was that was wonderful and I'm not a I'm not quite a preacher like that not quite a brother Joel but hopefully we can put some quotes together some scripture together and it can be a an encouragement to somebody a blessing to somebody and Joel he only gave me about 15 minutes up here this evening so I'm going to try and get right in the scripture he he said about 10 15 minutes don't go over so I'm going to try and I'm going to try and abide by that but if we could let's just turn to Psalm 103 I think we'll read down to verse 5 Psalm 103 let's go to verse five reads bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseas dises who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles and let's turn to one more scripture here first Corinthians the 2 chapter verse 12 1 Corinthians 2 verse2 it says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God Amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for another opportunity Lord we just ask that you would bless this service Lord that your spirit would that you would move amongst us Lord that you would Lord before I would say anything unpleasing you that you would stop me father and Lord we just thank you for the service this morning the anointing that came down lord how your spirit was in this place and father we just ask that you do the same here tonight Lord there's quite a few more than two or three gathered in your name here and father we trust that you'll be in the midst in Jesus Christ's holy name amen amen you may be seated so looking at these scriptures they it was speaking of you know forget not all your benefits as a Believer don't forget about them don't don't ever let them be cast out of your mind hinge on those think about those things consider them in your mind and and then it brought to my mind how the enemy he spends so much time telling us what we can't have he spends so much time telling us what we can't do what you're not capable of he spends so much time doing these things and it reminded me of pharaoh talking to Moses you know he wanted to Pharaoh after a few plagues he wanted to start bargaining with Moses a little bit he want to say well you can have this all right you can have this over here but I'm going to keep this and that's the way the enemy will do in our lives he'll say well you can have this healing over here you can have this thing you prayed for like he has any any deciding factor in that he doesn't but he says you can have this over here but I'm going to keep a hold of this and he tries to bargain with the believer and he tries to say well it's a it's not a give and take it's a it's we have benefits in this day it's in the word we don't have to bargain With the Enemy today we don't have to go back and forth with them we don't we don't have to accept some halfway Deliverance in this hour that's something that we do not have to accept and and I think Pharaoh he didn't quite realize that he didn't have any any legal rights left I don't think the thought had crossed his mind that it wasn't his to give back it wasn't his to give away they didn't need his permission anymore because God had spoken God had laid it down the prophet says in a quote here in the Oneness of unity he says I now challenge the devil to a debate come on now he said Satan you are aware that you are whipped he said you have no legal rights yes sir said Jesus Christ my Lord stripped you of every Authority you had when he died at Calvary to take away sin and sickness he said and you're nothing but a bluff and we're calling your bluff Moses called his bluff Moses said it is all ours he said I'm not leaving one hoof behind I'm taking it all with me Moses called him on that bluff and that's what we have to do now that was the benefits of being a believer in that hour and we say but what's the benefits of being a believer in this hour and there's a few scriptures I'd like to point to there's one we don't have to turn to them but just go through them quickly here Luke 10: 19 it's when the when those 70 are returning to him and he looks at him and he says behold I give un you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you we go to to another one Isaiah 53: 4 and 5 he says surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows those are benefits of being a Believer he says yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed these are benefits of the believer we go to another one Ephesians 6 chap or yeah Ephesians 6: 10 and 11 it's talking about the arm of God it says finally my brethren sir be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and that that didn't say be strong in the power of your own might but it said be strong in the power of His might those benefits they're not going to operate correctly if we try and be strong in the power of our own might now we can we can push and pull and we can try really hard but we have to as brother Joel he wonderful message this morning we have to let the spirit of God work through us it's not a it's not a fleshly matter we can't just come at it with our flesh and our own strength cu the devil will beat you 10 times out of 10 he has you conquered in that way but through the spirit of God he does not have you conquered and he never will right and there's a prayer that brother Brenham prayed it's it's kind of my inspiration for this message he says and we come to accept this morning what you have provided for us in your vicarious suffering and the atonement at your Deb that you have made for us he says and we freely Lord Jesus receive it we believe the word of God we believe that you promised he that will come to me I will in no wise cast out oh God what a promise no matter what it's for thou H has said when you pray believe that you receive what you ask for you shall receive it he goes on he says now father if we truly believe it and it's settled we believe it it is done then we act upon our confession that you have did it for us not that we are worthy we are unworthy but through your unmar grace that we have through thee we believe that the work is finished and as these penitent ones and the ones who are coming this morning consecrated themselves and to those who are coming for the benefits of the suffering for the benefits of the suffering as David said bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all of my iniquity my backsliding and who Health all of our diseases that's the benefits of the believer and if I were to title this this morning it would be the benefits of the believer's policy the benefits of the believer's policy and it goes on it says and we receive it through Faith this morning by coming upon the word of God yes which was spoken before the foundation of the world now these these benefits and maybe what First Corinthians was talking there these are the best kind of benefits they're the freely given ones everybody loves some free benefits I've heard brother George say before you know a cheeseburger is nice but a free cheeseburger tastes even better free things are really nice we like to receive these things you know if I'm a if brother Joel a company and if I'm a a worker for that company one of the first few questions I'm going to ask him is what are my free benefits you know we're going to talk about the pay we're going to talk about other things then I'm going to say well what benefits come freely to me what do I receive from you and he might tell me about a a retirement plan he has he might tell me about the different insurances he has he might tell me about these things that that his company offers me being a worker for them but if I don't take the next step and enroll myself in it and claim these benefits that are being freely given to me they're not going to do me any good right they may be offered they may be there for the taking they may be free but if I don't enroll in these and claim them for myself and make them personal to me what good are they going to do me but if I come to a realization if I that's a big part of it if I realize I'm a worker for that company I realize he's my boss and I realize all these things I need to learn to to accept these things just how we need to learn to accept the blood of Christ in our life These benefits into our life sometimes there's there's such our our minds can get so clouded some sometimes we have so many different things to look at in this day and we can look here and look here and look here and we're not recognizing the benefits of a believer in this day there's so many distractions and this is one of my favorite quotes i' I'd like to put it in every sermon I preach because I think the believer needs to believe this right here he says if you realize now that's a big part we must come to that realization if you realize that you're a son and daughter of God and the deposits made in Calvary now there's not any LIE there's not anything the devil can tell you about yourself that will take that deposit out of Calvary that deposits been put there and he can't move that deposit he can't touch that money he can't touch those benefits that are given to us they're there and they're there to stay it goes on it says and you've got a check book in your hand write anything you want to on there God's promised to take care of it that's a check Saints it's not going to bounce that's a check when you write your name on it it's good sir it's good every time there's funds in that account there's blessings in that account there's Redemptive blessings in that account for us to have in this day but we got to realize that he goes on he says it's in the bank it was deposited at Calvary your salvation the baptism of the Holy Spirit your worries and things gone says they're there he says and every one of you can be perfectly made well CU your Redemption is already redeemed before God and he's sitting at the right hand of God to make intercessions upon your confession in another place he says if I fell air to a house I sure wouldn't want to move into it till I got and looked everything over he said I want to see what's mine sir I want to see what I own and when I fell heir to the kingdom of God to the righteousness of Jesus Christ baptized into this great arcade of God's Eternal blessings I like to walk around and see what's mine yes sir he says look on the shelves and see what this is and he says here it is every promise in the book belongs to every believer every promise in this book belongs to every believer he said don't you stand still for somebody to push you off in a corner I love this don't you stand still for somebody to push you off in a corner and give you a little old cold Tater and tell you to wait he said don't you listen to that stuff that that'd be like in between Services over here if you walk in that door and somebody meets you at the door with just a little cold Tater and they push it on you and they say now go wait in that corner you watch everybody else go through this line and get this nice delicious warm food but you go in the corner with that cold Tater now Believers in this day now that'd be the devil standing at the door we don't have to take that cold Tater we can pass right by that cold Tater and we can go get some good food we can go get some some life preserving some eternal life food in this day some Mana that still got some life in it we can go through that line and get what the believer has comeing to him but if you stop for one second and get that little cold Tater then you're left with the cold Tater he's going to push you off in the corner and you're going to watch everybody else receive Their Blessings you're going to watch everybody else get full yeah right just passing by when he offers that cold Tater nobody wants cold Tater he says God's promis is right now he says push you off in a millennium somewhere the Bible said now we are the sons of God what we will be we are now present tense he said if anything that looks a little high and the blessing that looks like it why I'll get me a step ladder and move up doesn't God raise a standard sometimes or actually all the time when the enemy comes in like a flood he's going to ra up a standard says I like to look around it's all yours and every promise in the Bible is yours when a Christian gets saved God gives him a checkbook with the bottom of it with Jesus name signed in blood every Redemptive blessing belongs to the believer fill it out and send it in the headquarters Watch What Happens he says he's obligated to take care of his word if it's something in this word he's obligated to take care of it now we don't want to get in a hurry God is Sovereign in his timing so let's not put a timetable on God about these things there's benefits but then sometimes even working for an employer there's a waiting period you don't always get them benefits first day you may sign up for him the first day you may you may pray about something you need in your life but then sometimes it's 60 days sometimes it's 90 days and then you get them and that's how it works with God sometime sometimes it is the first day but we just don't want to put a timetable on God and say well Lord if if you don't give me this today this thing I've been praying for if I don't get it right now I I I'm just not going to ask anymore I'm just not too more I'm not interested in it anymore let's not give him a timetable he said I challenge any sick person or sinner tonight to sign your name or your wants above a check in Jesus name and send it into heaven once he said don't doubt he said the cashier is right there because the deposit was put there at Calvary through the blood of the Lord Jesus you know there's a when you think of a death inheritance when when there's a passing in the family and you're to you're to receive something that's going to be passed down to you that's a very sobering yet beautiful thing because there there it's something that's being passed down that's very important it may be a family heirloom it may be something very special but there had to be a death come in its place that death had to happen for it to be passed down to you like it was it's a very sacred thing you know when Christ bled and died for us at Calvary he didn't just pay for half an inheritance but he paid for the whole thing you know when the message of the hour came it wasn't just it wasn't just half a fullness of the word but it was all the fullness of the word it was a completion it was everything it wasn't just telling us half and then there's there's another half later to come come on but it's all it's everything it's all the Mysteries it's all the things that were scrupled up it's not just a little bit here and there I don't believe that's how God works so the prophet tells us the story of shamgar and his pressures in his life yeah he goes on here he says little shamgar had perhaps raised a good crop that year and the year before the Philistines come right in and get it so the year before the Philistines had came in he said and took his crop from him he says I can imagine seeing now with all of his Harvest over and he's got it all fixed in his barn and he's standing out in the barn one day looking around he says well I suppose maybe now we've got our crop in we've worked hard all summer and his wife and his kidy standing around he said well maybe we can eat this winter now now everything that they're sitting there looking at these are blessings from God these are things that God had he's given them and these are all things that are rightfully theirs at this moment he says what's that coming he says listens coming up the road what is it Trump chomp chomp tromp at 600 Philistines armed men coming he says my my here it is again only thing we can do is sit back and let them take it again the prophet goes on he says that's the way the devil will do he lets you build up a little bit of something then come in and knock the props out from under you says the reason you let him do it he said the reason is you let him do it he said that's all he's just a bluff he has no legal right that's it the prophet goes on and say if you've got an experience of God yeah of the Resurrection Jesus Christ he stripped Satan of every privilege that he had and robbed him of everything he had he took it away from him yes sir he robbed him and stripped him and give the power to the church and today every believer has that same power in their life if they'll just recognize who they are if they'll recognize the position that they're standing in in this day yes sir so the this was my sermon I thought I was going to preach it today and then brother Joel gets up and he he preaches on the Awakening of the bride and says a lot recognize who you are in these different things and I was like what's the odds of that there's so many different things we could both have preached on but I don't know he said now go do the same things that I did that's right he took the sword out of Satan's hand and put it in your hand amen right few paragraphs down I love this right here he said little shamard are looked and you know what I say this to you Holiness people his righteous indignation got up and if you look up righteous indignation that's a righteous anger yeah you know that's a that's an anger that shamgar that that formed in him he was sick and tired of the enemy trying to steal things that were rightfully his he was sick and tired of those Philistines coming and taking things that God had blessed him with and that's how we got to get today come on we got to get bold with the word of God today we got to be able to stand firm sir he's going to come and he's going to try and take and take and take and that's all he wants to do but we have to be like little shamgar here and stand our ground and we'll see what shamgar did you know the shamgar was not a settler he didn't he wasn't his days of settling for this were over and the Bible it didn't say that we are settlers but as a song said it said we are conquerors we're not just here to settle down and just just take any weaping the devil wants to give us but we are here to conquer in Jesus Christ not in oursel but in Christ sir he goes on he says you know what I mean yes he said you know I seen a little sign one time I was walking into a football stadium to have a meeting he said there's a little sign up over the door said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog he said that's right brother if you let the devil run over you he will just show you what size he is but you get a little grit yourself yes amen yeah can we get a little grit in the name of Jesus Christ can we get a little bit of that about oursel let him quit running us over day after day he said but you get a little grit yourself claim your god-given privileges in Jesus Christ and you'll Rejoice right he said that's right yes sir said old shamgar stood there and his righteous indignation got up and here they was Trump trump big heavy armor what did he do he said I am an Israelite I've been circumcised in other words receed the Holy Ghost he said I'm not a warrior I'm not a fighter and there's nothing I can do only I know one thing that's God that God's with me that's all I know and he reached up on the mantle and got an old Ox gold and a little old stick with a piece of brass on the end of it yeah he said you punch the dirt off the plow or beat the ox to the gate with it he jumped out there under the power of the Holy Ghost knowing that he knowed he had the right and and he slew 600 Philistines Hallelujah he slew 600 Philistines and sometimes there's just one one Spirit tormenting us and we can't get enough grit about oursel just to slay that one Spirit just to get it out of our face and shamgar he slew 600 of them shamgar knew who he was whether he was mighty or not whether he was a warrior or not he knew that God was with him yes he knew he had some benefits of the believer in his day he had something backing him up in this day and that's the same God today that's the same unchanging God today if God did that back then he still got to do that now brother Joel hit that this morning it's the same unchanging God right amen now shamgar he could have just looked down and he could have he could have took the whiping just like he did last year he could have hung his head yes and you know that's sometime it it's a hard life as a Believer sometimes and some days it's easy to to look at the world maybe even for young people this might hit more with the young crowd it it's easy to look at at the young people in the world and say they look like they're having so much fun they don't have to dress any certain way they don't have to look any certain way they don't have this this message we call it to abide by yeah they they look like they're just full of joy and and just having so much fun but what the enemy will do sometimes is if he sees that he's got you on the road that he wants you on he might keep you comfortable for a season if he sees that he's got you going the direction that he wants you to go not not the straight and narrow not God's not God's road but his Road he'll keep people not just young people but old people he he'll keep them comfortable in their ways he's never going to kick up a fuss with him because he don't want them to try and do anything different he wants them to stay on that same road doing the same things and some that's why their lives look easy sometimes people that are living worldly that are abiding by the world's rules that's why it looks simple but we ought to be the happiest people in the world today with this word that we have with the Lord with the realization of who we are yes of the blood of Jesus Christ we ought to be happy put a smile on our face not a frown not hanging our head not acting like a whipped dog but I can I want to cross that Finish Line running I don't want to come crawling up to it I want to cross that thing sprinting I I don't want to be just on my last leg hopping across but in the name of Jesus Christ I want to run across listen how the prophet speaks about the believer here he says our spirit is clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious but nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it savors and delights in its Pleasures we ought to be just as happy you see them happy out doing what they're doing we ought to be even happier than that and here doing what we're doing living the life that we're living living the life for Jesus Christ in this day he says both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christians hearts and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh right you know going forward speaking on these benefits of the believer just a little bit more what about the benefits that the the prophet had in his ministry what about those benefits all that healing and deliverance that we hear on tape those prayer lines that the signs and wonders the Miracles coming forth these things happening you know I've caught myself before saying man I wish I could have been there I wish I could have been a part of that now I would have liked to have seen it yeah but when I take that attitude man I wish I could have been there because that stuff was happening there well do I think that it can't happen here too do I think that it can't happen right now too because I saw where those things were put into the Bible but I never saw where they were taken out of the Bible those things are to the believer until the end they can still happen here today we don't need to put it off some other time but it can happen right here right now it can happen any day that we need it amen he goes on this is in the church age book he said and this Comfort is not he was talking about the the Seven Stars in his hand and he says and this Comfort is not for the seven Church age Messengers only every True Believer is in the hand of God and can draw from his love and power yeah and receive the full benefit of all that God is to the believer the full benefit not half a benefit not just a little bit of it but the full benefit he says what God gives the messenger and How He blesses and uses the messenger is an example to all believers of his goodness and care to all members of his body yes not just to the prophet not just to the preachers the teachers the evangelists the apostles not just to the song leader but to all members of his body right these benefits are available right in another message he said in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of the leoan age its Messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the beneficient effect of that prophet's Ministry that's right yes and they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that Bride of the last day yes that's right goes on in another place now the first human beings disfellowship themselves from believing God by disbelieving his word and listening to a lie of the devil now that's the first thing that dis Fellowship this wonderful union now look Adam and Eve in a position to never die in a position to never be old to never be sick to never have a worry you say I sure wish I could be like that he said I got news for you you are in the same position right when is that going to become real to each and every one of us you are in the same position right the very same as they were he said God places that to every creature on the earth in the same position he says what was the agreement if you'll keep my words if my word if you keep it believe it and if you act upon it today we have so many different different coverages and policies in our life so many different you know programs or maybe memberships that we're part of and when we're a part of something like that what we like to do is we get down and we'll read the fine print of that contract we we'll just we'll read every line of it we won't we won't let any benefit get past us yeah and that's in the physical we won't let one benefit slip away from us if we got a gym membership we're going to know we're going to know everything we got to know about that membership we're going to know everything if we got one free hour of yoga we're going to make sure we get that one free hour yoga in we're not going to let that pass Us by but then speaking on the spiritual why can't we look into this book and look into this message and read the fine print there and not let one thing slip Us by no matter you before you go to the gym you might have had a really bad day but you don't let the benefits there slip away so even even if you had a bad day before you walk through those doors back there we still can't let a benefit slip past us we got to grab a hold of each and every one of them it's our god-given right in this day and if you don't grab a hold of them the enemy will sit there and watch you and he'll know if you did or not and if you don't he's going to keep on tormenting he's going to keep on oppressing you'll stay in bondage then after we read it we have to make a claim on the word there's an old saying staken a claim and that was the California Gold Rush day there was time that the land was worth so much that people were just scrambling they would be out there and they would literally be putting Stakes down in the ground they' be staking out what property that they wanted and so the idea was I I want this property it's going to benefit me a lot it's going to make me a lot of money it's going to make me a rich man it's going to make my life easier it's going to do these things for me that was the idea of it and if there's any piece of ground in the believer's life if there's any piece of ground that the enemy is occupying in your life go put a stake down on it that can be your ground go put some Stakes down and once drive them deep in there and once those Stakes get down that's yours claim that benefit yes he goes on in another place he says now keep those things in mind The Church Must Believe every word every promise every Iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it he says if I was engag to a girl and I was a single man I'd send her something an engagement ring and if she wouldn't wear it then that shows that she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride right come on what are we showing God when we won't claim these benefits what do we saying to him yes he goes on he says she doesn't want to be my bride and if Christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refused them and say they're not so yeah they don't want to be the bride of Christ right that's a strong statement they don't want to be the bride of Christ he didn't put any he didn't put any certain criteria on that and he said well if their days is really bad then we can maybe they do want to be part of the bride of Christ but no he said if I send them and they say they're not so and they refuse them they don't want to be a part of the bride of Christ says they are a espouse to some other lover and not to Christ the bridegroom so the real Church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that God sends them all right now this in the deity of Jesus Christ this is probably one of the most powerful quotes I've ever read he said in that same power that same Christ Hallelujah let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of God and say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost the same power that spoke the world into existence it's in the people that's got the Holy Ghost he said that's right men and women it's time that we found out who we are he said the devil is trying to hide you back tell you that you're some little cow down something you're not you are Sons and Daughters of God right he says the deity is not in heaven he said it's in you right the deity is not some Far Away thing it is living in you Hallelujah he says I I know you think I'm crazy but let me tell you something brother when you realize there it is again that same statement when you realize if you realize if you can see that almighty God lives in you immortal life my life I give Zoey the life of God is in the human being with statements like that from a Vindicated Prophet why can we not recognize these things and you know sometimes we can we do recognize these things but but what's worse than not recognizing is recognizing and still not claiming these things maybe you do recognize your position but then you got to claim something come on now you may recognize who you are yeah but you got to claim it right we said you got to enroll in those benefits amen now the technical word of that if we're talking about a situation in the law it would be disclaiming oh it's the refusal of an inheritance yes it's not being interested in it yes and now most of the time in those cases says when there's a refusal of inheritance it's because there's not a good relationship between the two yeah the one that's trying to pass it down it's because you two are not you're not speaking you're not in good relations right you're not talking as much as you should they've left you out you've left them out and that's how it gets with God sometimes right we start refusing that inheritance well it's probably because there's not enough communication going on it's probably because you don't feel comfortable accepting that inheritance right now and maybe when you don't feel comfortable when the when the devil sees you hang your head about something he's going to attack that he's watching each and every single one of us he's watching our reaction he's watching what we do with certain people and he uses those things and he'll use those things to try and get us to refuse any benefit that God has for us if he can't keep you from becoming a son or daughter of God he's definitely going to try and Rob you of the benefits of it if he can't stop you from that from being baptized into the into the Holy Ghost and it coming inside of you and God living inside of you he's going to try and then rob you of every benefit he's going to try and keep anything God has for you out of your reach he's going to try and keep you too far back too away from it and that's just the way he works and he's worked that same way throughout history you can read the scripture and you can see a pattern of how he works you know Jehovah Jehovah of the old is Jesus of the new well Satan of the old is Satan of the new he works the same way too just as God has a provided way Satan has his own provided way as well and he's going to try and get you on that provided way yes yes and sometimes because of our past or something the the enemy he likes to hold things above your head he likes to hold things over your head you've done things that maybe only you and him know that you've done that's a deep thing he likes to hold stuff like that over the believer's head he likes to sit there and dangling and say well do you really deserve what God has for you should you even be asking this are you worthy to be asking this he knows he's seen what you've done he's seen you every day of your life so he knows these things and he can shame us sometimes so much and when he gets on when he gets on you and he's shaming you over and over again it'll just keep you paralyzed as a Believer he'll he'll keep you thinking you're not good enough he'll keep you thinking that you don't deserve those benefits and if he can get you thinking you don't deserve those benefits you'll never try and try and enroll in that program you'll never go after those benefits he'll keep you at a stalemate that's what he wants to do keep you well the prophet told us if you ain't moving forward you ain't moving backwards you're you're you're not just going to stay still so more than likely you're going to scoot on backwards a little bit you're going to fall backwards right a prophet says in another place I love this right here he says every Angel Archangel every principality and power he tore down and spoiled at his crucifixion and Resurrection everything Satan had he broke through the veil of sin he tore it apart with the high priest's blood of his own body excuse me he come to the next what was it it was a veil of sickness that held over the people he tore it apart for he was wounded for our transgression with his stripes we were healed he went through the great Veil Yonder of sickness the great veil of sin he went through the Great great veil of worry yes how many people is that Veil covered over here tonight the great veil of worry now you can be you can be have a a Christian concern about something you can be concerned but don't let it eat at you so much that it turns into a worry it's it's not against the scripture to be concerned about a situation or a person or something but don't let it Fester don't let it turn into it commit it to the Lord and move on he goes on and he says he went through the great veil of fear he tore every one of them down and he ascended so high and received the name above every name that's named in the heavens above or in Earth Below or in the world to come God taken that lovely one who stooped down so low that even he didn't have a place to be born or a place to die God exalted him on high and give him a Crown of Glory under a name above every name he says there he sits today the mighty conqueror since he rent every veil in two the veil of sin was rent two the veil of sickness was rent two and every Veil that kept man away from God yes he said was written too I am the way the truth and the life he broke every Power he scattered every devil he made a search light from Glory that day he goes on he says there he sits the mighty conqueror he rent every Veil into he rent The Veil that you could be sa saved he rent The Veil that if you've committed adultery if you have cursed if you've done anything wrong he rent that Veil for you so that's those sticks as it mentioned that that the enemy that he wants to hold above your head these things that he wants to hold and and he wants to wave it above your head and and tell you're not good enough he rent those things in two whatever it may be at Calvary at his crucifixion at his resurrection he rent those things into and so feel free that's the word feel free to tell the enemy that when he's coming at you with those things speak the word to him don't just don't just keep it in your mind speak it out loud to him say it out loud to the devil you'd be in the middle of Walmart and act like a crazy person if he's tormenting you walking through there tell him no tell him what the word says who cares what we look like it's too late hour to care what we look like to everybody else right now but we need to turn into conquerors we don't need to just just walk walk on this Earth and just settle for this and settle for that but we need to turn into conquerors at some point this word has blessed us too much it's given us too much for us to sit still and take that cold Tater I keep coming back to that cold Tater he goes on he says that stick that Satan holds over you he rent it if you'll only receive him he said if you're sick today and the doctor says you can't get well he rent that that Veil un too and everything is broken before God he rent every Veil he tears down every domain and he sits there today the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil into as brother Joel said this morning it's very possible for us we can go a long time before recognizing who we are and he talked about the baby eagle and brother Brandon makes a statement here a Son of God can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son a son or a daughter of God you can go a long time before before you recognize that before you move upon anything yes now the enemy wants the believer to stay as far away from that Revelation is possible that's one Revelation he does not want you to get that's one he's going to push you away from yes there's a I think he he mentioned brother Joel mentioned invisible Army this morning the quote here it says he knows and now this is speaking of the devil he knows that if the that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army right she will be an invincible Army now that's going to take some Faith now it's not some far off mystical Faith like sometimes we make it when we come to get prayed for or if we're praying for somebody else and we're we're we're thinking about do I have enough faith for this it's not some far off mystical complicated Faith but just as like the night of the Passover that hsip what did they apply what they apply that blood with they applied it with the hsip yeah and brother brandham said that hsip represented faith that word it means your faith and now he also said about that hsip that little common weed he said it could be found anywhere you could find you could find that hiss up anywhere you look around you just pull it up yeah and now we make Faith so complicated sometimes but it's like that hsip it's such a simple thing but we like to twist it and and make it into something that's not it's a very simple thing a prophet said faith is a revelation yes he told us that Faith was a revelation something that's revealed to you that you have it's a substance something like gas in the tank that's what I look at Faith as it's it's gas in the believer's tank it's what can keep the believer pushing forward in this hour right but a lot of us stay tied because we make it too complicated we make it into something that's unachievable we look at it like we're not able to obtain that it reminds me of the Crow story how that Crow's sitting there and he's tied on his ankle and he's hopping around he's hopping around he's calling and what he was probably saying when he was calling he was probably crying out for help he's probably saying come untie me somebody come help me then the man came and he untied him and then after even after he was untied he had got so conditioned he had been so and just like us we get so conditioned by the enemy sometimes that crowed became untied and he just sat there and kept hopping in the same Circle that he had always been in he had no Revelation in his life that he had been untied he didn't recognize now that he could fly off he didn't recognize what he could do and so he sit there and he stayed in the same rut that he had been in he kept just hopping around calling for help in the same rut little did he know he had been untied he had the opportunity to leave the prophet says in a message he says you may think you are tied too brother sister that wrote this question you may think the devil has got you tied down there but he's lying there was one time a man come to Earth Jesus Christ the son of God he untied you don't you believe it you don't have to stay down there no sir you're free that's right he died in your place to take away your sins you just believe on him flop your wings and fly away with the rest of them don't stay in that pit of the devil no sir and the person that it's a this is a questions and answers he says now will you lay your hands upon me and free me from that they asked brother Brandon this he said sister dear or brother dear sure I'd lay hands on you but that wouldn't free you all right yeah he said what would free you is to understand that you're already free all right yeah he said you're already untied you don't have to worry about being free you're already free Jesus made you free be not again entangled in the Yoke of bondage it says you're free as you can be you don't have to be tangled up any longer and that's to us sitting here tonight we don't have to be this is a simple message this is maybe just a little encouragement these quotes and these the these scriptures just a little bit of encouragement you don't have to be tied any longer you don't have to settle in this day all right you have to settle for what Satan has for you right but you take what God has for you and become a conqueror in this hour accept the benefits of the believer yes as a musicians come I went just a little bit over 15 minutes I didn't as musicians can they can come up we have to recognize the freedom that Christ paid for we have to stake our claim in that freedom yes we have to drive that stake down deep if I could just read Maybe one or two more quotes here in the message of token he says and everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours it's your property because it's paid for amen he said life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for let's actually everybody say life is mine say healing is mine Freedom Is Mine Heaven is mine he paid the price he paid the price for those things they're mine they're yours just one more quote here if you knowed positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes he said that's right the thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen you know we can't be waiting on something in the future to take God at his word the benefits are now we don't have to wait for another event we don't have to wait for anything like that but we can take God now at his word right now right this second any time any place we can take him at his word he said looking off into a millennium for something to happen when it's already here he said now we are the sons of God not we will be we are right now he said when this night he said right now this minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now said oh if you'd only recognize that and the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer anything you have desire of anything you have need of only thing you have to do is ask and receive it good he said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it it'll be given unto you he said St Mark 11:24 and that's true whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it you know today I hope that there was listen to the message this morning and coming into tonight I hope there was some but God moments he read that scripture at the end some but God moment you know I came in here seeking healing I came in here seeking a deeper Revelation I came in here seeking to be closer with the Lord and then the enemy attacks you on those things he knows that's what you want and he attacks you on those things but but then you look at him and you say but God who is rich in Mercy let's have some but God moments but God who is rich in Mercy but God who is rich in healing of my body but God who is abundant in Revelation but God who's the love Giver who's the faith Giver yes let's have some but God moments reach out and grab a hold of those benefits good don't just let them sit there enroll yourself in that plan read that policy day after day and believe it take your faith that God gives you and believe it let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just thank you for the services today Lord we thank you for your presence today Father we just ask that you would go with each one that they safely return home and Lord if there's any here with a need in their heart a need in their lives something an answer they've been looking for Lord Jesus that's their benefit to reach up

strengthen us Lord in such a late hour Lord that you would that you would give us more faith as we go forward that everywhere that The Souls of our feet should tread Lord that you would give it to us Lord the enemy battles us day after day and father sometimes it gets tiring but Lord we know that that we know the strength Giver we know you well we we don't just know facts about Jesus in the Bible
