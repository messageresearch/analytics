[47:29] Lord. Amen. Numbers chapter 21 and verse
[47:33] 5. Numbers 21 and5. It's uh good to be
[47:37] back with you this afternoon. Thank you
[47:39] all. All those who got to stay and those
[47:42] that are watching this afternoon. I know
[47:43] some are traveling. So, we're praying
[47:45] for them. Uh this week, of course, we'll
[47:48] be traveling with the young people. So,
[47:49] we coveret your prayers for that. Uh
[47:52] starting we'll be here on Wednesday, but
[47:54] then on Thursday morning early, we'll be
[47:56] leaving and uh brother Joel and and
[47:59] Sister Virginia and myself, my wife will
[48:01] be traveling. So, next week, Sunday
[48:04] morning, we'll just have one service
[48:06] next Sunday. One service. And uh uh so
[48:10] we won't have a second service. And I
[48:12] know some of them are going to take an
[48:13] opportunity to go out and eat. Now, if
[48:14] you need to bring your food and still
[48:16] eat here, that's fine. But I know some
[48:18] of them are going to take that
[48:19] opportunity to go out and eat, but u
[48:21] we'll uh we'll be with the young people.
[48:23] And let's just pray the Lord will just
[48:24] bless them in a mighty way there at the
[48:27] camp. And then um uh so we've got that
[48:30] and then the next weekend after that,
[48:33] Brother Ben Beard will be here preaching
[48:35] for us. Last time he came, it wasn't
[48:37] really fair to him because we uh uh it
[48:41] was a snowstorm come in and and uh I
[48:43] remember he preached and everybody's
[48:44] watching the weather, you know, and he
[48:46] did a good job, but but uh he is coming
[48:49] back and he'll be here that Sunday
[48:50] morning and Sunday afternoon on the 6th.
[48:53] The Lord willing, I'll be here, but
[48:55] he'll be preaching for us. Do you love
[48:57] the word this afternoon? Amen. That's
[48:59] what we come together to hear. But Joel
[49:01] will be traveling back from Arizona. Uh
[49:03] I think in the mornings we'll be praying
[49:05] for them and and uh each one that's
[49:08] traveling. Numbers 21:5. The people
[49:10] spake against God and against Moses.
[49:14] Wherefore have you brought us up out of
[49:16] Egypt to die in the wilderness? For
[49:19] there is no bread, neither is there any
[49:24] water. Now, that was actually a lie.
[49:26] Yeah. Because they had the water out of
[49:29] the rock,
[49:31] but they said there's no bread, no
[49:33] water, and our soul loathth this light
[49:39] bread. Angels food. But they said we
[49:43] hate it. We absolutely can't stand it. I
[49:47] want to preach to you on when the church
[49:49] gets sick of mana. Pray the Lord add his
[49:52] blessing to the word. You may be
[49:54] seated. Israel had many advantages in
[49:57] their wilderness journey. They were
[50:00] promised a land flowing with milk and
[50:04] honey. They uh they they had that
[50:06] promise to look forward to. But not only
[50:08] that, they had a vindicated prophet as
[50:12] their leader, as the one who would lead
[50:15] that age. And and uh they had been
[50:17] delivered from the bondage of Egypt.
[50:21] They they shouted on the banks of the
[50:23] Red Sea as they watched their
[50:25] persecutors drown, never to be seen
[50:28] again. Some of us could identify with
[50:31] that. We remember what it was like when
[50:34] when the devils that had tormented us
[50:36] were done away with were taken out of
[50:38] our life and never to be seen. And we
[50:40] saw a a final complete victory over the
[50:43] enemy in our lives. We we remember what
[50:46] that was like. We we danced on the
[50:48] shores of the Red Sea and they had they
[50:50] had experienced the the the pillar of
[50:53] fire, the power of God, the the
[50:55] deliverance of God. The their bitter
[50:58] water was made
[51:00] sweet. Oh my. The smitten rock followed
[51:03] them providing water wherever they went.
[51:06] And they literally had angels food to
[51:10] eat.
[51:11] Mana. Mana is the food that God gave
[51:15] them from heaven. And we don't really
[51:16] know for sure what it was, but in Exodus
[51:20] 16:14, it says, "When the dew that lay
[51:22] was gone up, behold, upon the face of
[51:24] the wilderness, there lay a small round
[51:26] thing as small as the horrost on the
[51:29] ground. And when the children of Israel
[51:31] saw it, they said one to another, it is
[51:33] mana, for they wish not what it was."
[51:36] And Moses said unto them, "This is the
[51:38] bread which the Lord hath given you to
[51:41] eat. This is the thing which the Lord
[51:43] hath commanded. gather of it every man
[51:46] according to his eating and for every
[51:48] man according to the number of your
[51:50] persons. Take ye every man for them
[51:53] which are in his tent. So we know that
[51:55] this mana was just a type of Christ. If
[51:58] you'll preach with me, we'll get through
[52:00] fast tonight. But he it's a type of
[52:03] Christ. In John 6:48, Jesus tells the
[52:06] the uh Israelites, he said, "I am that
[52:08] bread of life." Yeah. He said, "Your
[52:11] fathers did eat mana in the wilderness
[52:13] and are dead and that's eternal,
[52:15] eternally separated from God." He said,
[52:17] "But this is the bread which cometh down
[52:19] from heaven that a man may eat thereof
[52:22] and not die." So this is even better
[52:25] than what they had. He said, "This is
[52:27] this is bread that once you eat of it,
[52:29] you don't ever hunger or thirst again."
[52:31] Oh my. He said, "I'm the living bread
[52:34] which came down from heaven. If any man
[52:36] eat of this bread, he shall live
[52:38] forever. The bread that I will give is
[52:40] my flesh which I will give for the life
[52:43] of the world. I want to ask you to this
[52:45] afternoon a simple question. How do you
[52:47] get tired of heavenly bread? Yeah. Come
[52:52] on. How is it that we can get bored?
[52:55] Come on now. By heavenly bread. Yeah.
[52:58] I'm just preaching to you today. Y'all
[52:59] forgive me. But but how do we get fed up
[53:03] and and unwilling to and undesirous of
[53:07] the bread of God? That's right. How
[53:09] could we ever get enough of him? How
[53:12] could we feed too much on the body word
[53:14] of the son of man that we would say, "I
[53:16] don't want it no more. I I'll just let
[53:18] it go. I'll go when it's convenient for
[53:20] me. I'll listen when it's convenient for
[53:22] me. I'll read when it's convenient for
[53:24] me." When do we When did we get fed up?
[53:30] Come on, church. I'm I'm just preaching.
[53:32] I You know me. You know I love you.
[53:35] Okay.
[53:37] How do you get tired of mana? Yeah. It's
[53:40] a good question, isn't it? We look back
[53:42] at the Israelites say, "You guys are
[53:43] crazy. You didn't have to work for it.
[53:47] You You didn't have to till it. You
[53:48] didn't have to You didn't have to
[53:50] harvest it. All you had to do was go
[53:52] pick it up and eat it. And it was it
[53:56] tasted like honey.
[54:01] Oh my. It's free. It comes from heaven.
[54:04] You don't have to buy it. All you got to
[54:07] do is go pick it up. And you know, every
[54:10] day there's going to be a new supply of
[54:13] mana from heaven. How do you ever get
[54:15] tired? Come on now. of mana.
[54:18] Israel was a type of the church. We know
[54:21] that. The called out. And in the church
[54:23] is a mixed multitude. And you remember
[54:25] the Bible says the mixed multitude got
[54:27] to grumbling and the mixed multitude is
[54:29] always with the church but it it affects
[54:32] the believer because when the mixed
[54:34] multitude gets to grumbling and
[54:35] complaining then the believers many
[54:37] times do the same thing and and yet they
[54:40] had angels food to eat and all of these
[54:42] advantages. But I believe we have all of
[54:44] these advantages today. We do have a
[54:46] vindicated prophet. We do have a perfect
[54:48] word. We do have the power of the Holy
[54:50] Ghost. We have all of these things. But
[54:52] why would people get tired of mana?
[54:57] Now
[54:58] look, it it was a type of the church and
[55:02] God had called them out of Egypt and
[55:04] they'd experienced great victory.
[55:07] But then he immediately allowed them to
[55:09] go into a test. And God will do the same
[55:12] thing in every one of our lives. He'll
[55:14] call you out. He'll call you the message
[55:16] of the hour. And then you'll sit there
[55:17] and think, why after he called me out
[55:19] would he let me go through this? Because
[55:20] he loves you.
[55:22] because he deals with you as sons and
[55:24] daughters of God. He deals with you as
[55:27] someone who can take it. Amen.
[55:30] So what is he doing? He's putting you to
[55:32] a test. Brother Brandham said when a
[55:33] fellow receives Christ as his savior,
[55:36] everything is on the housetop. But
[55:38] before this man can come into the
[55:39] baptism of the Holy Spirit, this person,
[55:41] he must first have a sanctifying
[55:44] process. He must have a testing time in
[55:47] his life. Every son that cometh to God
[55:50] is first scourged, chasened, chastised.
[55:53] And if we cannot stand chastisement, it
[55:56] shows we're not children of God. We're
[55:58] bastards, not children of God, the Bible
[56:00] said. But if we can stand the
[56:02] chastisement knowing, Amen. that all
[56:04] things, someone say, "All things work
[56:07] together for good to them that love
[56:09] God." Am I the only one here this
[56:10] afternoon? Are are we all here and ready
[56:12] to hear the word of the Lord? Listen.
[56:14] All things. Someone say it with me. All
[56:16] things work together for good, for my
[56:19] good, for your good, for the good of
[56:21] them that love God. He says, "So we
[56:24] know, we go through the hard times
[56:26] knowing sir that it works together for
[56:28] our good." You say, "Explain my
[56:29] situation." I can't, but I do know it's
[56:32] part of all things.
[56:35] I I don't understand why some people
[56:37] seem like are plagued with this or that
[56:39] or the other. Some families deal with
[56:41] sickness. Some deal with financial
[56:43] trouble. Some deal with trouble with
[56:44] their children. Some deal with something
[56:46] else. And some seems like deal with
[56:47] everything. And you think, why is it
[56:49] that you go through it? But God must
[56:51] trust you or he wouldn't put you through
[56:52] it. He put his children to the test. He
[56:55] always does. He deals with us as sons.
[57:00] He said, "But if we can stand the
[57:02] chastisement, knowing that all things
[57:04] work together for good to them that love
[57:05] God, then we are sons and daughters of
[57:07] God. Then he seals us with the Holy
[57:09] Spirit till the day of our redemption.
[57:11] See, that's the chastisement, the
[57:13] strain, the thing we go through. And
[57:16] Israel as a historical type had to take
[57:20] this chastisement. Hebrews 12:6 tells
[57:22] us, "For whom the Lord loveth,
[57:25] whom he loveth,
[57:29] he let you go through that because he
[57:31] loves you." That's right. He made it
[57:33] difficult many times. Many times he
[57:35] allows it to be difficult for us to to
[57:38] make it difficult for us to even go to
[57:39] church because he loves us. Because he
[57:43] knows it's for our good to persevere
[57:45] through the pain and persevere through
[57:47] the struggle and persevere through the
[57:48] anxiety. He knows it's for our good to
[57:51] learn how to lean on him in the moments
[57:53] when we don't feel like it and we serve
[57:55] him anyway.
[57:56] Great.
[58:02] And brother Ram says, "So then that
[58:04] process of time, there's where the great
[58:06] falling away come in Israel. When this
[58:09] great crowding in time, crowding in
[58:12] time, then the people begin to fall away
[58:14] from one side to the other. Then I like
[58:17] the way he put us in there chatting.
[58:20] I'm just imagining. Do you guys remember
[58:22] instant messages?
[58:25] Some of y'all do. You're smiling. You
[58:27] remember AOL? Some of y'all don't know
[58:29] what I'm talking about. You sit there
[58:30] and wait, you know, sit there and wait
[58:33] on it to come up and then you sit there
[58:35] and you type out a little message. It
[58:38] takes about 10 minutes, you know,
[58:40] sending a little wheel spinning and then
[58:42] it goes. I'm just imagining the
[58:45] Israelites out there with instant IM.
[58:47] You
[58:48] know what are they? They're chatting.
[58:52] It sounded like this. Well, we wish we
[58:54] were back down in Egypt.
[58:58] They were slaves.
[59:03] But you realize how quickly your mind
[59:05] can turn and the devil can get you
[59:07] convinced you're worse off than you was.
[59:12] And then there I am. You know, we wish
[59:15] we were back down in Egypt.
[59:19] We can't stand this light
[59:22] bread. We are sick of hearing the same
[59:26] message over and over again.
[59:31] We're tired of coming to church and it
[59:34] just gets boring to us. Yeah. It be we
[59:37] become sick of it.
[59:39] Oh my. Come on. Oh, I hope we're not in
[59:42] that condition today. I don't believe
[59:44] you are on a Sunday night or you
[59:45] wouldn't be here. Yeah. But we need to
[59:48] we need to watch this.
[59:50] He says, in other words, if I would take
[59:52] it historically now, he said that's what
[59:54] they said. Now in the modern
[59:56] day, like like now we
[1:00:00] text, we chat on
[1:00:02] Facebook, WhatsApp.
[1:00:05] Yeah.
[1:00:07] Signal, all of those things in their
[1:00:10] chatting. Yeah. This is what they would
[1:00:12] do in the modern days. He said, he said
[1:00:15] in the modern day it would be oh every
[1:00:17] Wednesday night prayer meeting. Yeah.
[1:00:20] Every Sunday morning back to the church.
[1:00:24] Why do we hear the same thing? The
[1:00:26] preacher stand up and preach songs. Go
[1:00:29] on
[1:00:33] back. He said, "See then you're just
[1:00:35] going as a line of duty."
[1:00:40] He said, "You're not a worshipper."
[1:00:41] There you go. A worshipper goes there to
[1:00:43] worship.
[1:00:45] Come on.
[1:00:47] I told somebody, they said, "Well, so
[1:00:48] and so don't like my singing." I said,
[1:00:50] "I didn't realize we were worshiping so
[1:00:51] and so."
[1:00:55] Come on, church. I didn't come to
[1:00:57] worship you or you didn't come to
[1:01:00] worship me. We come to worship God.
[1:01:03] He said, "A worshipper goes there to
[1:01:05] worship, to express himself before his
[1:01:06] God, to praise God for his goodness."
[1:01:09] every word he hangs on to it.
[1:01:14] That's a worshipper.
[1:01:16] Brother Brown types this to a boyfriend
[1:01:19] girlfriend
[1:01:21] relationship. He said, "If you was going
[1:01:23] with a girl because you knew it was a
[1:01:25] duty or you going with a boy when you
[1:01:28] were young." He said, "Mama wants me to
[1:01:31] go with this guy, but I just can't stand
[1:01:33] him." Now, surely none of us ever did
[1:01:36] that, but
[1:01:38] you don't get nothing of him coming to
[1:01:40] see you.
[1:01:42] Just don't mean anything. It's just a
[1:01:45] duty. Or if it's the same way about the
[1:01:47] girl to the boy or boy to the girl, he
[1:01:50] said, "You go with her. She bores
[1:01:53] you. If she bores you now, wait till you
[1:01:56] get
[1:02:01] married." Right? Y'all sitting together,
[1:02:04] we're so
[1:02:07] bored. I probably shouldn't get married
[1:02:09] then.
[1:02:11] It's a whole lot more boring afterwards.
[1:02:17] But you got to want to be together,
[1:02:19] right? My wife was trying to get out of
[1:02:22] going to youth camp, you know, and uh I
[1:02:25] said, "Man, I started counting days.
[1:02:26] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I
[1:02:28] don't want to be away from my wife that
[1:02:30] long. Is that okay? I I just don't want
[1:02:33] to be. I don't have a desire to be.
[1:02:35] That's right. Huh? I want to have my
[1:02:36] wife there. It don't matter just just if
[1:02:38] she's there. You know, we don't have to
[1:02:40] ride in the same vehicle or anything,
[1:02:42] but we just just she just be there,
[1:02:45] right? I just want her to be there and
[1:02:47] nobody else listens to me complain like
[1:02:49] she
[1:02:51] does. Nobody else can can can I can be
[1:02:55] as comfortable with or as open with. Do
[1:02:57] you see what the type is, church? We got
[1:03:00] to love to be around him. We got to love
[1:03:02] when we when we talk to him. We got to
[1:03:04] love to come to the house of God and
[1:03:06] say, "Lord, I'm comfortable with you."
[1:03:08] I'm not here just cuz mama wants me to
[1:03:10] be here. I'm not here just cuz daddy
[1:03:12] wants me to be here. I'm here for you,
[1:03:14] Lord.
[1:03:17] See, he said, "If if you just go cuz
[1:03:19] mama wants you to go, mama wants you to
[1:03:22] be with this person. If it bores you, no
[1:03:24] love
[1:03:25] affair, you don't care." He said, "You
[1:03:29] don't want to clean up. You don't even
[1:03:31] want to go see her.
[1:03:35] Huh? If your marriage gets to that
[1:03:37] place, now's the time to check up.
[1:03:42] For when our marriage relationships get
[1:03:43] to the place where we don't care if we
[1:03:45] clean up no more. We don't care if if
[1:03:48] they if we're around them or not, that's
[1:03:50] a problem.
[1:03:52] We need to deal with it right there. Do
[1:03:53] you realize that they they found out
[1:03:55] that there's a mathematical equation to
[1:03:57] marriage? And it goes like this that
[1:04:00] that it's it's a they can predict when a
[1:04:03] marriage is going to end based on how
[1:04:06] bored the couple is in each other's
[1:04:09] company.
[1:04:12] Just based on how bored Oh, church. You
[1:04:16] realize that we as preachers, as
[1:04:18] ministers, we can do the same thing with
[1:04:21] the gospel. And how many times have I've
[1:04:23] seen people when they get bored with the
[1:04:25] house of God when they get bored with
[1:04:26] the word and they don't it just don't
[1:04:28] mean nothing no more. I know we got
[1:04:30] things come up and and things keep us
[1:04:31] from the house of God. I realize many
[1:04:33] people that want to be here can't be
[1:04:35] here. But when we are here, if we're
[1:04:37] just bored to death, you realize it's a
[1:04:39] great indicator that a person's on their
[1:04:41] way out.
[1:04:44] Boredom is a is a is a is a great
[1:04:46] indicator that you're not going to be
[1:04:48] there for very long. Listen, we should
[1:04:50] not be bored with the presence of Jesus
[1:04:52] Christ. We should not be bored sitting
[1:04:55] in heavenly places in Christ. We should
[1:04:57] not be bored hearing about our new home.
[1:04:59] We should not be bored hearing about the
[1:05:01] great things of God, about the promises
[1:05:03] of God. And when we preach the promises,
[1:05:05] there ought to be something on the
[1:05:06] inside and say, "Yes, Lord, that's mine.
[1:05:09] I'm going to that land filled with milk
[1:05:11] and honey. I'm going to be a part of
[1:05:12] that group. I'm going to be there." It
[1:05:16] shouldn't bore us to hear a prophet tell
[1:05:17] us about going beyond the curtain of
[1:05:19] time and the millions that cried out.
[1:05:21] And I identify with that group that says
[1:05:24] you he preached just what Paul preached
[1:05:25] and we said we're resting on that. I
[1:05:28] identify with that group. It doesn't
[1:05:29] bore me. Yeah. This message don't bore
[1:05:32] me. Yeah.
[1:05:35] And if you get bored by the gospel, you
[1:05:38] better be careful. That's good.
[1:05:43] It's a lack of a love affair. He
[1:05:45] said, he said, "When he's coming to see
[1:05:49] you, might you wish he would hurry on
[1:05:50] and go
[1:05:54] home, you should you should see how hard
[1:05:57] it is to keep some of these kids
[1:06:00] apart." I got teenagers. Y'all got
[1:06:03] teenagers, man. They just want to talk
[1:06:04] all the time, be around each other all
[1:06:06] the time.
[1:06:08] I mean, and then you you got to set
[1:06:10] boundaries and things and appropriate
[1:06:12] make keep it appropriate, but they're
[1:06:13] going to push the limits. They're
[1:06:14] teenagers. That's what they do.
[1:06:17] Why? Because there's an attraction,
[1:06:20] right? For the right or wrong reasons,
[1:06:21] there's an attraction.
[1:06:25] But what if there's no attraction no
[1:06:26] more? What if there's just boredom?
[1:06:28] Well, it's a bad place to be, church. We
[1:06:31] don't want to ever get that way. Let's
[1:06:32] get back to the water. Get back to the
[1:06:35] well. There's a well for us. That's the
[1:06:36] hope in it. There's water for us.
[1:06:41] There's man it to
[1:06:43] eat. He said, "Then the same way it is
[1:06:45] when you" He said, he said, "Why does he
[1:06:46] preach so long?"
[1:06:49] What about all this stuff and
[1:06:50] everything? See, you're not in love.
[1:06:51] Yeah. He said, "But when you really hang
[1:06:53] on to every word," as the spirit gave
[1:06:56] warning, he said, "Hanging on to every
[1:06:57] word." That might be what he's been
[1:06:58] talking to you about. Holding on is
[1:07:00] eternal life. Every word of God. It's a
[1:07:02] joy to go to church under any
[1:07:04] circumstance. Whether it's hot, cold,
[1:07:07] indifferent, whether the people are
[1:07:09] fussing, growling.
[1:07:11] You ever heard a congregation growling?
[1:07:13] Absolutely. But whether the people are
[1:07:15] growling and fussing, whatever it is, I
[1:07:16] don't believe that's you, church. You're
[1:07:18] a wonderful church. But look, my it's
[1:07:19] boresome. He he said he said, "It's
[1:07:22] still a joy to hear the word of the
[1:07:23] Lord, no matter what the people say." He
[1:07:25] said, "Then you're in love with Christ.
[1:07:26] See, you love to go to church." He said,
[1:07:29] "Well, honey, here it's Sunday morning
[1:07:30] again. I guess we have to wash up the
[1:07:32] youngans and get down there."
[1:07:34] Oh, some of y'all are so convicted right
[1:07:39] now. Kids, go take your baths. We have
[1:07:42] to go to church
[1:07:43] tomorrow. And if we're not there on
[1:07:45] time, everybody's going to look at
[1:07:51] us. Do we lose what it's for? The reason
[1:07:55] why we're going,
[1:07:59] he said, "It's still a joy to hear the
[1:08:01] word of the Lord, then you're in love
[1:08:02] with Christ. See, you love to go to
[1:08:03] church. Yeah, honey. It's Sunday morning
[1:08:06] again. I guess we have to wash up the
[1:08:07] young ones. Get down there. My, it's
[1:08:08] boresome. See, you're not in love. But
[1:08:11] if you're really in love, you just can't
[1:08:12] wait till Sunday morning comes. You just
[1:08:15] got to get down there with them. And we
[1:08:16] get, he said, to leave the people of
[1:08:18] God, they don't bore you. Yeah. Come on,
[1:08:21] church. They don't bore you. A person
[1:08:23] who's in love with God can't help but
[1:08:25] being in love with God's people. Amen.
[1:08:27] They don't bore you. Amen. Why? They're
[1:08:30] brothers and sisters. Brother Brandon
[1:08:32] said this. He said, "There you get to
[1:08:33] where you're as thick as sorghum
[1:08:34] molasses on a cold morning." Now, some
[1:08:37] of y'all don't know how thick that is,
[1:08:38] but that's almost like concrete.
[1:08:42] He said, "What we love each other is not
[1:08:44] because that we're somebody." He said,
[1:08:46] "We don't love each other because we're
[1:08:47] somebody, but it's the Christ in one
[1:08:49] another that we love. It's the God
[1:08:51] that's in our beings that we love." He
[1:08:53] said, "Now, we love to come together.
[1:08:56] When one has a has a blessing, we're all
[1:08:58] happy about it. When one is sad, we're
[1:09:00] sad with him. We want to all be
[1:09:02] together. That's the way we're supposed
[1:09:04] to be. That's what the Bible tells us.
[1:09:05] What? Listen, church, it ought to thrill
[1:09:07] our hearts. When we see somebody come
[1:09:09] back to the house of the Lord that's
[1:09:11] been away for a while, it ought to be
[1:09:12] something in our heart. Say, Lord, I'm
[1:09:14] glad that they made it back to the house
[1:09:15] of God. I'm glad that you saved them.
[1:09:18] I'm glad you brought them. It don't have
[1:09:19] to be my family to bless my heart. Yeah.
[1:09:22] Oh, Brother Joe, when you sitting there
[1:09:24] singing with your daughter and your
[1:09:25] granddaughter, that just blessed me
[1:09:26] tonight because I know I I know it
[1:09:28] wasn't possible a few years ago. But
[1:09:30] God, rich in mercy. God knows what he's
[1:09:33] doing. And it thrills my heart when I
[1:09:35] see a family joyful. I that thrills my
[1:09:38] heart. It ought to thrill every one of
[1:09:40] us when we see people get blessed. Maybe
[1:09:43] you say, "Well, I haven't been blessed
[1:09:45] in a while." If you'd start being happy
[1:09:46] about other people being blessed, maybe
[1:09:48] you'd be blessed.
[1:09:52] Right. He said, he said, "When one has a
[1:09:54] blessing, we're all happy. When one's
[1:09:55] sad, we're sad." That's good. We
[1:09:58] experience that, too, don't we? Yeah. We
[1:10:00] know what that's like when somebody gets
[1:10:01] hurt. Yeah. When the church loses that
[1:10:05] feeling, it's a danger zone.
[1:10:09] It's a red flag. Yeah.
[1:10:12] When someone
[1:10:13] hurts.
[1:10:15] I watch some of these elders come in
[1:10:17] struggle to get into the house of God
[1:10:18] and I hurt.
[1:10:22] I'm not just saying that, church. I do.
[1:10:24] It hurts. Yeah. Every one of us are
[1:10:27] going down there one day. The Lord
[1:10:29] carries. We're all going to get older.
[1:10:32] I see you struggle to make your place in
[1:10:34] the house of God, but you come anyway. I
[1:10:36] hurt for you, but I'm happy for you that
[1:10:39] there's so much God in your heart. You
[1:10:41] don't want to stay away from the house
[1:10:42] of God. Amen. When our families are
[1:10:44] hurting, when their children get sick, I
[1:10:46] hurt for them.
[1:10:48] I hurt for them. I think we all ought to
[1:10:50] hurt for one another. When one's sad,
[1:10:52] we're sad with him. We want to all be
[1:10:54] together.
[1:10:56] Brother Brandham talked about how a
[1:10:58] mother wants all of her children to be
[1:11:00] there. That's the best gift you could
[1:11:02] give to your mother is everybody be
[1:11:03] around the table. Just be there. Yeah,
[1:11:06] that's what that's the way a mother
[1:11:07] something in a mother's heart. Doesn't
[1:11:08] matter that weward child, no matter how
[1:11:10] weward they are and how far off maybe
[1:11:12] they've gone, how many years it's been
[1:11:13] maybe since she's seen them, but she
[1:11:15] wants all of her children to be around
[1:11:16] the table again. And that's her greatest
[1:11:19] desire. I wonder if the Lord's like that
[1:11:21] sometimes. And maybe his greatest desire
[1:11:23] is just to have all of his children
[1:11:25] around the table feeding. I know for me
[1:11:28] as a pastor, there's nothing better than
[1:11:30] getting to church and realizing maybe
[1:11:32] some of you didn't expect to be there,
[1:11:34] but they're there and they persevered to
[1:11:36] be in the house of God. There's
[1:11:37] something about that that means the
[1:11:39] world to us. Why we want to all be
[1:11:41] together? He said, "That's the way we're
[1:11:43] supposed to be." And life hinders us
[1:11:45] many times, but we should take every
[1:11:47] opportunity that we can.
[1:11:51] He said, "That's the way Israel was
[1:11:52] supposed to be." He said, "But it become
[1:11:55] burdensome. Oh, this old light bread.
[1:11:58] Angels bread. What do we care about this
[1:12:00] old light
[1:12:03] bread? Our souls loafth this stuff.
[1:12:09] When I was in Egypt, they had the best
[1:12:12] bread. It was baked right out in the,
[1:12:13] you know, they b they had bakeries, open
[1:12:15] air bakeries, and they laid the bread
[1:12:17] out to rise just right out in the uh it
[1:12:20] was round like this. And it was thick.
[1:12:23] It wasn't flat. It was it was thicker,
[1:12:25] but it was round. And they lay it right
[1:12:28] out there in all the dirt and the mules
[1:12:30] walking by.
[1:12:32] And but I loved it. And I I I gained
[1:12:35] weight in Egypt
[1:12:36] actually cuz I ate so much of that
[1:12:40] bread. But ever since by the time we got
[1:12:43] close to the end of that trip after two
[1:12:44] weeks of that, I was done
[1:12:47] because I could care less whether I ever
[1:12:49] saw it again. And right now, if you gave
[1:12:52] me some of that bread, I didn't eat
[1:12:53] lunch. And right now, I wouldn't
[1:12:54] probably eat a piece of that bread
[1:12:56] because I just had so much of it.
[1:12:59] Is that the way the gospel becomes to us
[1:13:01] sometimes? We've heard it over and over
[1:13:04] and over again. That's the way it was to
[1:13:06] them. It was just all over the place. It
[1:13:09] was so available, huh? They could pick
[1:13:11] it up wherever they were at. They could
[1:13:13] just walk out in the morning and pick it
[1:13:15] up. And because there was no effort on
[1:13:17] their part,
[1:13:19] come on, church. You remember when it
[1:13:21] was an effort to hear the message? Some
[1:13:22] of you remember when it took effort to
[1:13:24] listen to a tape. You remember I
[1:13:27] remember as a young person getting that
[1:13:29] box of tapes in the mail and that's what
[1:13:32] you listen to for the next two or three
[1:13:33] months and you paid for it,
[1:13:37] right? You paid $4 a tape or what? $6 a
[1:13:40] tape or whatever it was, which is a lot
[1:13:42] of money back then. So you paid for it
[1:13:44] and you sit there and listen to it or
[1:13:46] listen to it in your car. You remember
[1:13:48] what that's like. But today it's
[1:13:49] everywhere, right? You can listen on
[1:13:51] YouTube. You can go on the internet. You
[1:13:53] can go on any website. Go on our
[1:13:54] website. Go on Voice of God. Go on uh
[1:13:56] the message hub. You can go anywhere and
[1:13:58] listen to it. But do we pick it up?
[1:14:02] Come on, church. I'm not rebuking you. I
[1:14:04] just want us to think about it. Are we
[1:14:06] picking it up? Is it still life to us?
[1:14:08] Is it still something we want to hear?
[1:14:10] Is it still something or just is it just
[1:14:12] become common to us like the little boy?
[1:14:14] Brother Brandon said that Pentecostalist
[1:14:16] said become like the little boy. He said
[1:14:18] they shake little things at it and
[1:14:19] everything else. It wouldn't even move.
[1:14:21] It wouldn't even make a They didn't even
[1:14:23] notice it. He said it just the gifts
[1:14:25] have been shook before it. He said until
[1:14:26] they don't even notice it anymore. They
[1:14:29] don't even recognize when God is there.
[1:14:31] I wonder when we come to church if we
[1:14:32] just take for granted the presence of
[1:14:34] God. If we just sit there and think,
[1:14:35] "Well, it'll always be there. It may not
[1:14:37] always be there." We should take every
[1:14:39] opportunity to walk in, step in,
[1:14:43] feed on the things of God. Yeah.
[1:14:47] Why do we care about this old light
[1:14:49] bread?
[1:14:51] Our souls are sick.
[1:14:54] That's what that word loath means.
[1:14:56] They're sick of this stuff. Come on. And
[1:15:00] everything is wrong.
[1:15:02] And this old mama that falls out or this
[1:15:05] old man rather be different to old mama
[1:15:07] fell out every out of
[1:15:13] heaven. Well, I'm human, brothers and
[1:15:15] sisters.
[1:15:20] This old man, that's why I need
[1:15:23] glasses. This old mana that falls out
[1:15:25] every night. Why we would rather have
[1:15:26] some garlic and leak out of Egypt. You
[1:15:29] see, their hearts wasn't ready for the
[1:15:32] journey.
[1:15:34] Oh my. He said, "When a man or woman
[1:15:37] begins to complain about going to
[1:15:39] church, they get so tired of going to
[1:15:43] church, they're not ready for the
[1:15:46] journey. There's something wrong
[1:15:48] somewhere." See, we got to be ready for
[1:15:50] the journey. Yeah. That's what he's
[1:15:52] doing. That's why we're going through
[1:15:53] the testing time, to be ready for the
[1:15:55] journey. I heard brother McGary say
[1:15:58] this. I think I've heard him say it
[1:15:59] before, but I heard him say it recently.
[1:16:01] He said he got up and told his church
[1:16:03] because he has a they have a big crowd
[1:16:05] on Sunday mornings and less on Sunday
[1:16:06] nights. He said tonight the secret of
[1:16:08] the
[1:16:09] rapture is going to be unveiled for all
[1:16:13] of those of you that come. He said he
[1:16:15] said if you don't come, if you got
[1:16:16] better things to do than to get a body
[1:16:18] change, he said, "You all go on.
[1:16:24] What would we do if we really believe
[1:16:25] that?" That's right. What are we doing?
[1:16:27] We're getting ready for the journey.
[1:16:30] Yeah.
[1:16:32] He said, "Oh, when you love God and
[1:16:34] thinking you're going to heaven and all
[1:16:36] of you are going together, it means
[1:16:37] something to us to be together. I
[1:16:39] appreciate I I I don't call people out
[1:16:41] very often, but I I seen Logan and
[1:16:43] Jessica trade places today. I appreciate
[1:16:45] that. I know they've got a sick boy at
[1:16:47] home and they they've kind of traded out
[1:16:48] and one come one service, one come
[1:16:50] another." God will honor that effort.
[1:16:53] He'll honor that effort. You say, "Well,
[1:16:55] it doesn't matter." It does matter. He's
[1:16:56] getting us ready for a journey. He's
[1:16:59] putting us in a place where we'll do
[1:17:00] what what God wants us to do, even if
[1:17:02] the times are difficult. Oh my. He said,
[1:17:05] "When you're thinking of going to
[1:17:06] heaven, all you're going together, and
[1:17:08] he seems, what a fellowship. What a joy.
[1:17:10] Divine leaning on the everlasting arms."
[1:17:12] He said, "Now you're getting ready for
[1:17:13] the journey." See, you're ready to go
[1:17:14] into the promised land, the testing
[1:17:16] times. There's the danger ground, the
[1:17:18] wilderness, the testing times. Israel in
[1:17:20] her testing time. She got to quarreling
[1:17:22] and fussing with one another and
[1:17:24] loathing over the bread. And they wanted
[1:17:27] to go back to Egypt.
[1:17:30] See, and and now brother Brandon taught
[1:17:33] us that they began they started with
[1:17:35] complaining about the bread and the
[1:17:36] water and then they turned their
[1:17:38] complaint toward their leader. I'm not
[1:17:40] talking about
[1:17:42] me, but their leader was the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:46] Right? They begin to complain about
[1:17:47] their leader. He said, "Oh, they was
[1:17:50] afraid that he was leading them astray
[1:17:54] after he had showed himself to be a
[1:17:56] leader and God had proved that he was
[1:17:57] the leader." What do they have? A
[1:17:59] vindicated prophet. What do we have? A
[1:18:01] vindicated prophet led by the Holy Ghost
[1:18:04] in the hour that we live in. And yet
[1:18:06] people when they begin to get away, when
[1:18:08] their soul gets sick of mana, when the
[1:18:10] church gets sick of mana, it begins to
[1:18:13] complain about a prophet.
[1:18:16] They begin to look for all the errors
[1:18:18] and all the little inconsistencies and
[1:18:20] begin to point out all the things.
[1:18:21] Brother Brandham did this and did this
[1:18:23] wrong. He did that wrong and that wrong.
[1:18:24] Listen, I don't want to point out his
[1:18:26] errors. I realize he was a man. He was
[1:18:28] not God. We don't worship William
[1:18:29] Brandom, but we do know that God used
[1:18:32] that man in our day to be a prophet.
[1:18:35] Not just to be a prophet, to be be the
[1:18:37] seventh angel messenger to reveal Christ
[1:18:40] to us. He used him to do that. We should
[1:18:43] not complain about it. Amen. Come on,
[1:18:46] church. We didn't get to choose the
[1:18:47] seventh angel messenger. He wasn't in
[1:18:49] the hand of Benuit. And Ben Puit wasn't
[1:18:51] one of the ones in his hand, but the
[1:18:53] seven messengers were in his hand. Amen.
[1:18:56] Right there in Revelation. They were in
[1:18:58] his hand, in his right
[1:19:02] hand. They began to complain about their
[1:19:04] leader. Oh, they was afraid he was
[1:19:05] leading them astray after he had showed
[1:19:06] himself to be a leader. God had proved
[1:19:08] he was a leader. Well, maybe we've acted
[1:19:09] a little bit fanatically. Maybe we've
[1:19:11] got off on the wrong foot. They was
[1:19:14] chatting. Here they go again on the
[1:19:16] instant
[1:19:19] messages. Little I can't make that
[1:19:23] sound. There's that little sound. You
[1:19:25] know when it go off? Well, he said maybe
[1:19:29] we've acted a little bit
[1:19:33] fanatically. Maybe we got off on the
[1:19:35] wrong foot.
[1:19:36] Something like that. He said they was
[1:19:38] chatting against God and against Moses.
[1:19:41] God and his leader. And when we get to a
[1:19:44] place saying, "I don't know whether the
[1:19:46] word means this or not." So, we're not
[1:19:50] in love with it anymore. Yeah. So, we
[1:19:53] begin to question it. That's good. And
[1:19:56] and I don't know about the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:57] I'm a little bit skeptic of that. I know
[1:20:00] others that don't will go on to Egypt.
[1:20:03] But if you are really determined to stay
[1:20:04] on the road, are we determined this
[1:20:07] afternoon? I believe you are, or you
[1:20:09] wouldn't be here this afternoon. But if
[1:20:10] you're really determined to stay on the
[1:20:12] road, stay right with this leader, the
[1:20:13] Holy Spirit. Stay right with the word.
[1:20:16] And if you stay with the spirit, it'll
[1:20:17] keep you in the word. That's right.
[1:20:19] It'll take you right down along the path
[1:20:20] of the word. He said, "Don't be afraid
[1:20:22] of it. It won't hurt nothing. It'll just
[1:20:24] help you if you're hurt. Don't be afraid
[1:20:26] of the Holy Ghost. It'll heal all the
[1:20:27] hurts the Holy Spirit will." Oh my. You
[1:20:31] said, "Well, a little complaining never
[1:20:33] hurt nobody." Well, it sure hurt them.
[1:20:35] In
[1:20:38] fact, they got bit by snakes.
[1:20:43] Numbers 21. For they journeyed from
[1:20:45] Mount Hore by the way of the Red Sea to
[1:20:46] compass the land of Edom. And the soul
[1:20:49] of the people was much discouraged
[1:20:52] because of the way. And the people spake
[1:20:54] against God and against Moses. Wherefore
[1:20:57] have you brought us up out of Egypt to
[1:20:58] die in the wilderness? For there is no
[1:21:00] bread, neither is there any water. Our
[1:21:03] soul loathth this light bread. We are
[1:21:05] sick of it. And the Lord sent fiery
[1:21:08] serpents among the people. And they bit
[1:21:11] the people and much people of Israel
[1:21:15] died. Oh my. Now God doesn't want us to
[1:21:19] murmur among ourselves but to take our
[1:21:21] complaints to him. I've read this to you
[1:21:23] before, but James chapter 5 and verse 9
[1:21:25] says, "Grudge not one against another,
[1:21:29] brethren. Grudge not." That word grudge
[1:21:31] means complain not lest you be
[1:21:34] condemned. Behold the judge standeth
[1:21:37] before the door.
[1:21:40] And numbers 11:4 it says the mixed
[1:21:42] multitude that was among them fell
[1:21:44] lusting. The children of Israel wept
[1:21:45] again and said who will give us flesh to
[1:21:46] eat? What' they do? Over and over they
[1:21:48] complained. They complained about God's
[1:21:50] provision. They complained about God's
[1:21:52] profit. They complained about
[1:21:53] everything. And that was an example for
[1:21:55] us not to complain.
[1:21:58] God help me today. I know preachers
[1:22:00] sometimes complain more than anybody.
[1:22:01] God help me not to be a complainer, but
[1:22:03] a preacher of divine promises.
[1:22:10] The preachers got up. Remember when they
[1:22:12] come to Kades Barnea, the preachers got
[1:22:14] up and complained about the land. And
[1:22:16] the people's souls begin to get weak and
[1:22:18] weary. And the people pretty soon
[1:22:20] everybody was complaining because the
[1:22:21] preacher started it.
[1:22:25] Come on, church. We don't need to
[1:22:26] complain. We we need to go make our
[1:22:28] complaints to God,
[1:22:30] not to the people. Oh, help me Lord. He
[1:22:34] said we they look what they said. We
[1:22:38] remember whenever a church gets in we
[1:22:40] remember stage. They need a revival.
[1:22:46] Let me pour some water on that. Yeah.
[1:22:49] Come on. You You ever walk by a plant
[1:22:52] and we got some plants at home that we
[1:22:55] didn't know when we put them in there.
[1:22:56] They got to be watered every day.
[1:22:59] And they're beautiful, big, beautiful
[1:23:01] flowers. I forget what they're called,
[1:23:02] but every day they have to have water.
[1:23:04] And if you don't give them water one
[1:23:06] day, that thing will wilt and look
[1:23:08] terrible. And as soon as you pour water
[1:23:10] on it, here it comes.
[1:23:14] And and we didn't realize that's a lot
[1:23:15] of work to water. You ever walk by
[1:23:17] somebody and say, "Well, they just need
[1:23:19] some
[1:23:20] water. I just wish I had the Holy Ghost
[1:23:22] in a cup. I just come pour it out."
[1:23:26] But he's here. You don't have to stay in
[1:23:29] a wilted condition. I don't have to stay
[1:23:31] in a wilted condition. He's here to help
[1:23:33] us.
[1:23:35] Is that what we're hearing today,
[1:23:36] church? I don't want to preach doom and
[1:23:37] gloom. I don't want to preach, well, the
[1:23:39] church is this, that, or the other. I
[1:23:40] want to say he's here to help us. He's a
[1:23:42] very present help in time of trouble.
[1:23:44] He's a rock in a weary land. Even when
[1:23:46] they complained, that rock still
[1:23:47] followed them. Did you know that the
[1:23:49] rock followed them? Everywhere they
[1:23:51] went, the rock followed them. When they
[1:23:52] were saying there was no water, the rock
[1:23:54] was still there.
[1:23:56] Hallelujah. Still gushing out water if
[1:23:59] they'd just drink from it.
[1:24:01] Amen. The rock followed them all
[1:24:04] through. And Christ is here with us. He
[1:24:06] said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never
[1:24:07] forsake you." Said he was the same
[1:24:09] yesterday, then forever. He's here.
[1:24:11] Let's just take advantage of his
[1:24:12] presence.
[1:24:16] Amen. He said, "We
[1:24:19] remember I do not believe a church
[1:24:21] should be built on history.
[1:24:25] Church should be built on the living God
[1:24:28] and the living word,
[1:24:31] not on what used to be, right?" And a
[1:24:34] church is entering a dangerous time, no
[1:24:35] matter how big it is or how small it is,
[1:24:37] when they begin to just everything's in
[1:24:39] the past. We remember
[1:24:41] Yes, sir. We remember what it used to be
[1:24:44] like. We remember the
[1:24:46] fish.
[1:24:48] Now, now if you eat this diet, you're
[1:24:52] going to have some bad breath. Listen to
[1:24:54] this. Fish,
[1:24:57] cucumbers, melons, leaks, onions. They
[1:25:01] must have really liked
[1:25:03] onions. And the
[1:25:07] garlic you talk about.
[1:25:11] But it was because it was in their
[1:25:12] memory. They didn't remember the
[1:25:15] slavery.
[1:25:17] They just remembered being happy.
[1:25:20] But it was momentary, right? It was just
[1:25:24] fleeting. It was just for a moment. And
[1:25:26] they were slaves again. Yeah. They'd
[1:25:28] give them some garlic and send them
[1:25:30] right back out in the mud pits.
[1:25:33] Give them some garlic and then beat
[1:25:34] them. Beat their children. Kill their
[1:25:37] children. Oh my. you realize what they
[1:25:40] were doing. But Satan had so the the
[1:25:43] spirit of complaint had so come among
[1:25:45] them that they began to think, "Well,
[1:25:46] we'd have been better off eating
[1:25:50] garlic, eating garlic." But now our soul
[1:25:54] is dried away. There is nothing at
[1:25:58] all beside this
[1:26:00] man before our
[1:26:02] eyes. Quotes, quotes, quotes. Is that
[1:26:06] all you have, preacher, is quotes?
[1:26:10] mana.
[1:26:13] Do we get tired? Yeah.
[1:26:17] Do we love the word for the sake of the
[1:26:18] word? Or do we love the word because the
[1:26:21] preacher is emotional?
[1:26:23] Come on. And I'm all for emotional
[1:26:25] preaching, but that's not what make
[1:26:26] ought to make us love the word. We
[1:26:28] should not just love the word because
[1:26:30] the preacher's moving around. We should
[1:26:32] not just love the word because we're in
[1:26:34] a big meeting and there's lots of
[1:26:35] people. The love for the word ought to
[1:26:37] be in our hearts. Lord, I want the word.
[1:26:39] I want to hear your word. Amen. They
[1:26:42] said, "We don't have nothing but quotes.
[1:26:47] Nothing but mana."
[1:26:51] Therefore, the people came to
[1:26:53] Moses's. Look what they did. Numbers
[1:26:56] 21:7. I'm jumping around, but I just
[1:26:57] want to get through this this afternoon,
[1:26:59] not take all day. But they said that and
[1:27:02] then they went through their troubles
[1:27:03] and
[1:27:04] finally the they got bit by
[1:27:07] serpents and the people came to Moses
[1:27:10] and said we have sinned. Brother said
[1:27:12] that's the first step on your road back
[1:27:14] for we have spoken against the Lord and
[1:27:16] again he prayed to the Lord that he take
[1:27:18] away the serpents from us and Moses
[1:27:20] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[1:27:22] to Moses make thee a fiery serpent and
[1:27:24] set it upon a pole. I'm sure there was
[1:27:27] some of them like we don't need no more
[1:27:28] serpents.
[1:27:31] Last last time Moses dealt with a
[1:27:34] serpent. He actually it actually a rod
[1:27:36] became a serpent.
[1:27:38] But now he's going to take a serpent of
[1:27:40] brass and put it on a pole. Says, "And
[1:27:44] it shall come to pass that everyone that
[1:27:46] is bitten when he lookth upon it shall
[1:27:49] live." Aren't you glad God always makes
[1:27:51] a way of escape?
[1:27:53] He always, though we complain, though we
[1:27:56] murmur, though we grudge against one
[1:27:57] another, yet he always has a way of
[1:28:00] escape, there's always an avenue of
[1:28:02] mercy.
[1:28:05] And Moses made a serpent of brass, put
[1:28:07] it on a pole, and it come to pass if a
[1:28:08] serpent had bitten any man. When he
[1:28:10] beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
[1:28:12] The brass serpent, we know, was sin,
[1:28:14] judged. Jesus said in John 3:14, "As
[1:28:16] Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:28:18] wilderness, even so must the Son of Man
[1:28:20] be lifted up, that whosoever believeth
[1:28:22] in him should not perish, but have
[1:28:23] everlasting life." Oh my. For God so
[1:28:27] loved the world that he gave his only
[1:28:30] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[1:28:32] him should not perish, but have
[1:28:33] everlasting life. For God sent not his
[1:28:36] son into the world to condemn the world,
[1:28:38] but that the world through him might be
[1:28:40] saved. He was the fulfillment of
[1:28:42] Isaiah's prophecy. When Isaiah said,
[1:28:44] "Look unto me all and beastly saved all
[1:28:47] the ends of the earth, for I am God and
[1:28:50] there is none else."
[1:28:56] Look and live. He was the bread of life.
[1:28:59] You remember, Brother Brandon, when he
[1:29:00] preaches a sermon, look, he uses the
[1:29:03] pool of
[1:29:04] Bethesda. And you remember in the pool
[1:29:06] of Bethesda, it was made up of five
[1:29:09] porches and then the pool and and there
[1:29:12] was a man waiting there. remember he'd
[1:29:13] been waiting there for years waiting to
[1:29:16] get to move into the water because every
[1:29:18] once in a while at a certain season
[1:29:20] they'd have a
[1:29:21] revival and and the angel would the
[1:29:24] angel would come and trouble the waters
[1:29:27] and the first one to get in got
[1:29:30] healed but you had to react quickly
[1:29:34] right to get down. I'm sure over the
[1:29:37] years they moved closer and closer
[1:29:38] trying to get a good spot, right? But
[1:29:41] for whatever reason he could never get
[1:29:43] in, but the B said he wasn't terminally
[1:29:45] ill. He maybe had a prostate condition
[1:29:47] or something like that, but he waited
[1:29:49] and he waited and he waited. He never
[1:29:50] could get healed. But one
[1:29:53] day he where that had been an avenue
[1:29:56] that God had used for healing, but one
[1:29:58] day the healer himself, right, came down
[1:30:01] right among them and walked through all
[1:30:04] those people. maybe 5 10,000 people
[1:30:07] laying around that pool waiting for the
[1:30:09] waters to be troubled. And here comes
[1:30:11] Jesus walking among them and he walks
[1:30:13] right by them. They don't even recognize
[1:30:15] him. They're waiting, watching for the
[1:30:17] water to move, not recognizing, right?
[1:30:18] Oh, it's a great type of this age. You
[1:30:20] realize he's here. But the brand said,
[1:30:22] "My message is to declare that he's
[1:30:24] here. You may not feel him, but he's
[1:30:25] here. You may not understand him, but
[1:30:28] he's here. How is he here in the person
[1:30:30] of the word? Here come the word." And
[1:30:31] walked right among them. And he come to
[1:30:34] that predestinate, that elected seed.
[1:30:37] Oh, I'm so glad he came to me. He come
[1:30:39] to that elected seed and he be to talk
[1:30:42] to him. Come on, man. And he said, "Do
[1:30:44] you want to be well?"
[1:30:47] "Look unto me, all ye ends of the
[1:30:49] earth." He said, "Do you want to be
[1:30:51] well?" That's what he
[1:30:52] said. "Do you want to be made whole?"
[1:30:57] And the man had to turn, look away from
[1:31:00] the pool, and look at the one who was
[1:31:03] the healer.
[1:31:06] Hallelujah. And when he looked at the
[1:31:08] healer, he said, "I want to be well, but
[1:31:10] I can't get into the pool." And Jesus
[1:31:12] said, he said, "If you believe, take up
[1:31:15] your bed and walk." Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:31:18] And he got up and walked away from that
[1:31:20] disappointing pool, never to be
[1:31:22] disappointed again. Why? The healer had
[1:31:24] come around. All right. Look at him.
[1:31:28] Oh, we look at we want to look at the
[1:31:29] church. We want to look at something
[1:31:30] else. We want to look at denominations
[1:31:32] or how big the church is or how small it
[1:31:33] is or what service it is. Don't look at
[1:31:35] that. Look at him. Yeah.
[1:31:41] And
[1:31:42] Jesus walked around that pool and he he
[1:31:46] talked to that man. That man had to
[1:31:47] change what he was looking at. But the
[1:31:48] brand said, "What are you looking at?
[1:31:50] What are you waiting for?" That's good.
[1:31:53] It's time. The waters are being
[1:31:56] troubled. He's here, right? It's time.
[1:31:59] The waters are being troubled. Move in
[1:32:01] now. The signs of the last time. It
[1:32:03] shall be light in the evening time. He
[1:32:05] said, you know, yes, it shall be. That's
[1:32:07] right. The path of glory you'll surely
[1:32:08] find. He said, what are you looking to
[1:32:10] church? All these last days. Oh, he's
[1:32:13] been right among us, people, and we
[1:32:15] forgot it. He sent right among us, and
[1:32:17] we didn't know it. He said, the Holy
[1:32:19] Spirit is here this morning, and maybe
[1:32:21] many will go away sick and forget it.
[1:32:24] Maybe many of the sick will forget to
[1:32:25] believe. Oh, don't forget to believe,
[1:32:27] church. You remembered to come to
[1:32:29] church. You remembered to sit in your
[1:32:30] favorite spot. You remembered to sing
[1:32:32] the songs, but don't forget to believe.
[1:32:35] So many forget to believe and anchor
[1:32:36] their faith right where it should be.
[1:32:38] Now, he said, "Truly, the pool is
[1:32:40] troubled. The waters are whirling
[1:32:42] backwards from the natural, showing the
[1:32:44] supernatural. The Holy Spirit is here
[1:32:46] taking a normal bunch of people,
[1:32:47] intelligent, sitting here, well-dressed,
[1:32:49] well educated. Oh, that's
[1:32:52] us
[1:32:53] looking. He said, "The Holy Spirit fall
[1:32:56] upon them." Something whirls them
[1:32:58] around. They holler, "Glory to God." Oh,
[1:33:01] I thought he was talking about us there
[1:33:02] for a minute.
[1:33:07] This well-dressed, well educated people,
[1:33:08] he said, "But they it turns them around,
[1:33:10] makes them holler, glory to God.
[1:33:12] Hallelujah. What's the matter?" The
[1:33:13] troubling of the water.
[1:33:15] Oh, the waters are being troubled.
[1:33:18] That's why we saw Sister Fritz here in
[1:33:20] the in the altar this morning. She may
[1:33:21] be 91 years old, but she can still feel
[1:33:24] the moving of the water.
[1:33:26] Oh, church. Oh, can you still recognize
[1:33:30] that he's here? Can you know that he's
[1:33:32] among you? Maybe he's not moving like he
[1:33:35] used to in the old denominational days
[1:33:36] in the great worldwide revivals, but
[1:33:39] he's right here among us.
[1:33:46] Brother Brenson said, "Sinners sitting
[1:33:48] there,
[1:33:49] backsliders, such were some of us,
[1:33:53] prostitutes, drunkards, and everything
[1:33:54] else are saintly and godly. You can't
[1:33:57] put a finger on their lives anywhere
[1:33:58] since they received it." What is it? The
[1:34:01] troubling of the waters.
[1:34:03] I want to challenge us today. Have we
[1:34:05] gotten sick of the mana?
[1:34:07] Huh? Maybe we complained, got bit. Look
[1:34:10] at the word.
[1:34:12] Look at the serpent, the sin, judge.
[1:34:15] Look at the word and live. Don't look at
[1:34:17] your trouble. Don't look at the
[1:34:18] complaint. Look at the word. Amen.
[1:34:21] Hallelujah. Elijah looked he looked for
[1:34:25] rain.
[1:34:26] Right in in a desert land. He was
[1:34:30] looking for rain. We got to be looking
[1:34:31] for it. Right? And the Bible says he saw
[1:34:35] a cloud the size of a man's hand.
[1:34:40] Right? Now, if you were out here in the
[1:34:42] desert, number one, it's hard to see a
[1:34:46] cloud the size of a man's hand. Number
[1:34:48] two, you would immediately discount it
[1:34:50] because you think, how much water could
[1:34:52] possibly
[1:34:53] come from a cloud the size of a man's
[1:34:57] hand?
[1:34:59] And the people look at it and says, you
[1:35:01] know, he could have looked at and said,
[1:35:01] "Well, that was a rocket that did that."
[1:35:03] You know,
[1:35:06] that was some kind of trick just of the
[1:35:09] imagination.
[1:35:11] He could have looked at and not believed
[1:35:12] what he saw. Yeah. But there's something
[1:35:15] about the prophet that he saw when he
[1:35:17] saw that cloud, he said, "That's rain."
[1:35:20] Yeah. Said, "There's rain coming."
[1:35:23] Hallelujah.
[1:35:24] He said, "I Hallelujah. I hear the sound
[1:35:28] of an abundance of rain.
[1:35:31] Glory to God. He saw a cloud the size of
[1:35:33] a man's head and said, "I see an
[1:35:35] abundance of rain."
[1:35:37] Oh, church, let it soak you today. A
[1:35:40] cloud. We seen a cloud. There's an
[1:35:42] abundance of rain. Just depends what
[1:35:45] you're looking at. He said, "The sound
[1:35:47] of the hand in the sky." He said, "The
[1:35:48] trouble of the water, the first little
[1:35:49] move, people jumped in." The sign of the
[1:35:51] hand of the sky. Elijah said, "That
[1:35:52] cloud the size of a man's hand like a
[1:35:54] vapor." What was it? He kept believing.
[1:35:56] I hear the sound of abundance of rain.
[1:35:58] That cloud become two clouds. Two clouds
[1:36:00] become a hill. A hill become a mountain.
[1:36:02] The mountain become another mountain.
[1:36:04] The first thing you know the whole skies
[1:36:05] were thundering. Rain was Paul. And what
[1:36:07] was it? He accepted what God sent. He
[1:36:09] said, "I see the serpent on a pole. I
[1:36:11] see God's provision. I see God's mercy.
[1:36:14] And I believe it's God's mercy for me
[1:36:16] today." When he did, it began to
[1:36:18] multiply.
[1:36:19] Oh, church. That's what we need. And so
[1:36:21] what we need by the herald is to
[1:36:22] recognize him in the simple form that he
[1:36:24] is in the word and say I believe he's
[1:36:27] he's a vindicated prophet. I believe
[1:36:29] he's the same yesterday, today and
[1:36:31] forever. I believe he came in our day in
[1:36:34] the form of the word and I'm believe
[1:36:35] because I believe that when I believe it
[1:36:37] my faith begins to
[1:36:39] multiply pretty soon there's an
[1:36:41] abundance of
[1:36:42] rain. Hallelujah.
[1:36:45] Brother Brandon said what was he
[1:36:46] accepted what God sent and this morning
[1:36:47] if this afternoon if that little thing
[1:36:50] has touched your
[1:36:51] heart just
[1:36:53] something says I need
[1:36:56] that he said that's a little sign
[1:36:59] the size of a hand of a man
[1:37:04] what do you do believe it
[1:37:06] I hear the sound of an abundance
[1:37:10] of rain
[1:37:12] I'm out of time I don't have time to get
[1:37:14] into into the next part of this, but
[1:37:17] where where's our love for the word?
[1:37:19] Come on. I know you still love the word,
[1:37:21] but I I just want to stir up that
[1:37:24] passion today. Yeah. Do we still love to
[1:37:27] hear it? Do we love to sit together in
[1:37:29] heavenly places? I don't want to ever
[1:37:30] get sick of it. He told the Pergam in
[1:37:33] church age, I believe it was. He said,
[1:37:34] he said, I to him that overcomemeth, I
[1:37:36] give to eat of the hidden mana. Yeah.
[1:37:39] The hidden mana. Like Jesus given a
[1:37:41] portion to the disciples to distribute
[1:37:43] to the crowd. Each messenger was given a
[1:37:45] portion. Yeah. But we were given the
[1:37:48] full portion. That's good. All the
[1:37:51] hidden mana. Yeah. Hallelujah.
[1:37:54] And I think the problem is I'm just
[1:37:56] going to let you off the hook here for a
[1:37:58] minute. Because I think the problem is
[1:38:00] the reason why we really don't
[1:38:01] appreciate the word the way we should is
[1:38:03] because of these bodies. Yeah.
[1:38:07] Because of this flesh. Yeah. That's
[1:38:10] great. It's just impossible for us to
[1:38:13] fully comprehend
[1:38:15] what's been revealed to us. That's good.
[1:38:18] We see him. We see parts of him.
[1:38:20] Remember when he told Moses, he said,
[1:38:22] "You can only see the hindered parts of
[1:38:23] God. We've seen him in his word." That's
[1:38:26] right. Come on. But remember what
[1:38:28] happened when he spoke directly to
[1:38:29] Israel? They said, "Oh, don't let God
[1:38:31] speak." But the Bible said, "That's why
[1:38:32] we don't see the pillar of fire very
[1:38:34] often because the people said, "Don't
[1:38:36] let God speak. Let Moses speak." and we
[1:38:38] we couldn't comprehend the direct voice
[1:38:40] of God. So God uses men. God used a
[1:38:44] prophet in our day and we just couldn't
[1:38:47] wrap our minds around it. We can't even
[1:38:49] fully appreciate in these bodies. But
[1:38:52] one day,
[1:38:55] glory to God. Brother Brandon said in
[1:38:57] every age, the messenger of the Lord to
[1:38:59] that age was given the revelation of God
[1:39:01] for that specific period. Once the
[1:39:03] message messenger was enlightened by
[1:39:05] truth, he'd bring that truth to the
[1:39:06] people. And they whose ears, how many
[1:39:08] ears have been opened today, he that has
[1:39:11] an ear, he said, they whose ears have
[1:39:13] been opened by the spirit would hear
[1:39:15] that truth, believe it and live it. Now
[1:39:17] then, he said, there's also the thought
[1:39:18] of the future partaking of the hidden
[1:39:20] man. He said, I think it will be the
[1:39:22] eternal partaking of the revelation of
[1:39:24] Jesus Christ in the eternal ages to
[1:39:26] come. How else could we begin to know
[1:39:29] the uncarchable riches of his own being?
[1:39:35] Oh
[1:39:37] my. See, if you don't love the word, how
[1:39:39] could you love heaven?
[1:39:42] Are you with me now? There's got to be
[1:39:44] something in there that loves the word.
[1:39:46] But what makes us grow weary, sick of
[1:39:49] the mana is his flesh.
[1:39:53] But one day we shall not all sleep, but
[1:39:57] we shall all be changed.
[1:40:00] We'll never fall asleep hearing it
[1:40:02] again. We'll never have trouble keeping
[1:40:05] keeping our our minds on the right
[1:40:07] thing. The tempter will be gone. The
[1:40:09] accuser of the brethren be cast down.
[1:40:11] Oh, I'm looking forward to that day.
[1:40:13] Amen.
[1:40:15] Sometimes you sit and listen to the word
[1:40:17] and your body hurts, your mind hurts,
[1:40:19] you're worried about this, that or the
[1:40:21] other and you're sitting trying to
[1:40:22] listen to the word and let the devil
[1:40:24] brings everything he can. But if you'll
[1:40:26] persevere, if you'll keep doing what
[1:40:28] you're doing, remember there's coming a
[1:40:29] day when you can fully partake of the
[1:40:31] word. He said, "Well, I don't understand
[1:40:33] it like I should." There's coming a day
[1:40:35] when we'll know as we are known.
[1:40:38] Hallelujah. He said, "All that we have
[1:40:41] longed to
[1:40:43] know." I know there's questions that I
[1:40:46] have, I'd like to know, but I believe
[1:40:49] what's been revealed.
[1:40:51] But he said, "All that we have longed to
[1:40:53] know, all our unanswered questions, all
[1:40:56] that will be revealed." That's good. It
[1:40:58] will
[1:40:59] Hallelujah. It will be from
[1:41:02] Christ who is our life that we receive
[1:41:06] it. That's good. Praise the Lord. Oh my.
[1:41:09] He said, "Oh, sometimes we think we get
[1:41:11] to know a little of him and his word
[1:41:14] down here. It's like going and picking
[1:41:15] up the mana. We get just a portion and
[1:41:19] it's so good. It makes us rejoice."
[1:41:24] Oh, it ought to church. But one day,
[1:41:28] oh, I'm looking forward to that day,
[1:41:30] church. I want to end this day on an
[1:41:32] encouraging note because I know we're
[1:41:34] human beings. I know sometimes we
[1:41:36] grumble and sometimes we complain.
[1:41:37] Sometimes we find ourselves in a desert
[1:41:39] condition. But there's always mercy.
[1:41:41] There's always a brass serpent. There's
[1:41:43] always a way out. There's always a place
[1:41:45] provided for healing. There's always a
[1:41:47] place. Why? God knew that we were human.
[1:41:49] He knew we needed a savior. He knew we
[1:41:51] needed a redeemer. But he didn't just
[1:41:53] come to save our soul. One day he's
[1:41:54] going to change our bodies. And we'll
[1:41:56] know as we are known.
[1:42:00] Makes us rejoice one day when our flesh
[1:42:02] changes.
[1:42:04] that word and he will become what we
[1:42:07] have never
[1:42:08] dreamed possible.
[1:42:11] That's good.
[1:42:12] Hallelujah.
[1:42:16] Hallelujah. That little thirst that you
[1:42:18] have, that little part of you as a
[1:42:19] musicians come, that little part of you
[1:42:22] that just loves
[1:42:24] him, loves his name, loves his
[1:42:27] word. Can we sing that? What a beautiful
[1:42:30] name it is. What a beautiful name it is.
[1:42:34] that part of of you that just loves
[1:42:37] him of everything that you've
[1:42:40] got, that'll be all of you.
[1:42:44] That'll be it'll be you in your right
[1:42:46] body, you in your right mind, you with
[1:42:50] no pain. Yeah.
[1:42:53] You said, "Now I want to
[1:42:55] feed. I want to feed." But he loves us
[1:42:59] so much that he gives us handfuls on
[1:43:02] purpose portions of the fullness of the
[1:43:05] word that's been revealed in our age to
[1:43:07] each of us. He just gives us a little
[1:43:09] bit on Sunday morning, a little bit on
[1:43:11] Sunday night, a little bit on Wednesday,
[1:43:13] little bit when we listen to a tape, a
[1:43:15] little bit when we listen to a sermon, a
[1:43:16] little bit when we read a book or read
[1:43:19] our
[1:43:21] Bibles. It makes me hungry for more. I
[1:43:24] want more.
[1:43:27] I don't want less of it. I don't want it
[1:43:28] to become common to me when it's laying
[1:43:30] all over the
[1:43:32] ground. Lord, help me to never get sick
[1:43:35] of it. See, if you truly love what
[1:43:38] you're eating, you'll never get sick of
[1:43:42] it. While you're in love with
[1:43:46] it, if you truly love your spouse, you
[1:43:49] don't ever get sick of them.
[1:43:52] They could be old and you're old and you
[1:43:54] could both be in the in the end of your
[1:43:56] life. Maybe married 60, 70 years, but
[1:43:58] there's something about you still want
[1:43:59] to spend time together. Why you don't
[1:44:01] get sick of them? Why? There's love
[1:44:04] there. There's love there. Oh, church,
[1:44:07] let that be us in the house of God.
[1:44:09] There would be love in the house of God.
[1:44:11] Peace,
[1:44:12] joy,
[1:44:14] strength. We wouldn't just come for what
[1:44:16] we want, but Lord, feed me your
[1:44:18] word. Feed me your word. Lord, I want to
[1:44:21] hear it. I want to partake of it. I'll
[1:44:24] get up if I need to. I I'll arrange my
[1:44:26] schedule to make sure that I'm ready to
[1:44:28] hear the word. I'll do whatever it takes
[1:44:31] to be diligent to the house of God. I
[1:44:35] want the hidden mana of
[1:44:37] God. Lord, help me to appreciate
[1:44:40] it. Hallelujah.
[1:44:43] When we went to
[1:44:45] Egypt, those Pentecostal churches had
[1:44:48] never heard about a
[1:44:51] message and was so thrilled to see them
[1:44:53] passing out the revelation of Jesus
[1:44:56] Christ. I wonder how of Jesus Christ. I
[1:44:58] wonder how long it's been since you've
[1:44:59] read that. The revelation of Jesus
[1:45:02] Christ is a part of the church age book,
[1:45:04] but it was printed as a separate
[1:45:05] booklet. You remember back in the day we
[1:45:07] read it? Wonder how long it's been since
[1:45:10] we read our church age
[1:45:11] book. We spent thousands of
[1:45:15] dollars, printing
[1:45:18] books. This church did
[1:45:20] that. We did that in Egypt and into
[1:45:23] their language, translating
[1:45:24] painstakingly doing the best we could
[1:45:27] with the resources we had to translate
[1:45:29] that into
[1:45:30] Arabic. And then we're in Pentecostal
[1:45:32] churches. One of them was a church we
[1:45:33] had to go on by ferry to get there.
[1:45:35] There's no roads there. We're at a
[1:45:37] church in the middle of the Nile River
[1:45:38] in
[1:45:39] Egypt. Maybe Moses floated by, you
[1:45:42] know, a church right there in the middle
[1:45:44] of the Nile River and and and the people
[1:45:47] were so
[1:45:51] hungry getting their first copy of a
[1:45:54] book. And it occurred to me, Brother
[1:45:56] David, that some of us haven't
[1:46:00] read, maybe never presented to our
[1:46:04] children, the same book that we spent
[1:46:06] thousands of
[1:46:07] dollars to send overseas. I say,
[1:46:10] "Church, let's get hungry for
[1:46:12] [Music]
[1:46:14] it. Let's call out for it. Let's I know
[1:46:17] the world gets in the way and we got
[1:46:19] time and to do everything else, but we
[1:46:21] just never have time."
[1:46:23] I say, "God, help me to be
[1:46:25] hungry. I want to see it. I want to hear
[1:46:28] it. I want to be a part of
[1:46:30] it. I want to feed on the
[1:46:33] mana." Would you bow your heads with
[1:46:38] me? Maybe we preach today about the the
[1:46:42] spirit and how we need
[1:46:44] it, about the word and how we need it.
[1:46:49] Maybe there's somebody just that hunger
[1:46:50] is not there like it used to be. I say
[1:46:54] God my heart's with them right now. We
[1:46:56] got brothers and sisters in Nepal, a
[1:46:58] brand new country to this message just a
[1:47:00] few years a brother in New Zealand's
[1:47:01] been working with them just a few people
[1:47:03] in the world and somehow my that guy got
[1:47:06] my email and he began to email me and I
[1:47:07] began to email him back and there's four
[1:47:09] churches there in Nepal at the foot of
[1:47:11] Mount Everest and they're so hungry to
[1:47:13] get the word in their
[1:47:15] language. Oh God, help us. We got all of
[1:47:18] it. We got all of it. What are we doing
[1:47:21] with it,
[1:47:23] church? I believe we ought to do our
[1:47:25] part to help overseas. But I want my
[1:47:27] children to know the benefits of feeding
[1:47:29] on the mana. I want them to know. I
[1:47:31] don't want them ever get sick of it.
[1:47:33] We've been given hidden mana in our age.
[1:47:35] Let's appreciate it. And if you've not,
[1:47:38] there's mercy. There's grace. There
[1:47:40] there's a brass serpent. Sin was judged
[1:47:42] for you so you could come back into
[1:47:45] fellowship again. And the welcome mat's
[1:47:47] been rolled out so you can walk through
[1:47:49] the door. Come back into fellowship
[1:47:51] again. Oh, I want the hidden mana of
[1:47:54] God. Oh God, I want your name. I want
[1:47:58] your your voice. I want your spirit. I
[1:48:01] want you. I want your word. I pray God
[1:48:04] that you would help me. Lord, help me
[1:48:06] not to get accustomed to it where it
[1:48:10] just becomes another voice in a in a
[1:48:13] whole bunch of different voices. Open
[1:48:14] the heart. Let me hear the voice of the
[1:48:16] shepherd. Not the voice of a man, but
[1:48:19] God speaking through men. And God
[1:48:22] speaking through a messenger at our
[1:48:23] hour. God speaking through the prophets
[1:48:26] in the Bible. Oh, let me hear it, Lord.
[1:48:29] Let me read your word. Let me be a part
[1:48:31] of your word. Let me feed on the hidden
[1:48:34] mana. It's been revealed in our
[1:48:36] generation. Help me, Lord. Stir me up,
[1:48:40] God. Help me. Let's see a lack in the
[1:48:42] message as we focus inward and we begin
[1:48:44] to look at our own things and care for
[1:48:46] our own things. But what about those
[1:48:47] who've never heard? I pray God you'd
[1:48:49] help us. Forgive us, Lord. Help me,
[1:48:53] Lord, as a pastor. I want to present
[1:48:55] such a beautiful picture of this
[1:48:57] message, what it can do for a life that
[1:49:00] people would be drawn to it and want to
[1:49:04] come. Grant it
[1:49:06] Lord. Grant it Lord.
[1:49:09] realizing that every action we take,
[1:49:11] God, when we get sticky and thorny, we
[1:49:15] our nature gets prickly. It keeps people
[1:49:18] away. Oh, I don't want to be like that,
[1:49:21] Lord. Let the rain
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:24] come. Let your name be
[1:49:26] glorified. Let there be worship in this
[1:49:29] place. May we appreciate the mana that
[1:49:31] we've been given. We pray and we ask it
[1:49:34] in Jesus
[1:49:35] name. Hallelujah.
[1:49:38] name it is the name of
[1:49:43] Jesus. What a beautiful name it
[1:49:47] is. Oh, nothing compares to
[1:49:51] this. What a beautiful name it is. The
[1:49:56] name of
[1:49:59] Jesus. Oh yes you were the word in the
[1:50:05] beginning.
[1:50:08] Oh, one with God the Lord most high. Oh,
[1:50:14] can you just close your eyes and raise
[1:50:15] your hands to him now? Your hidden
[1:50:19] glory
[1:50:21] creation. Oh, now reveal him. You are
[1:50:28] Christ. What a beautiful name it is. Oh
[1:50:32] yeah. What a beautiful name it is. The
[1:50:35] altar's open if you need to pray
[1:50:37] tonight. Oh, you believe his name is
[1:50:39] beautiful. Do you love him? Christ my
[1:50:42] king.
[1:50:44] Oh, what a beautiful name it is.
[1:50:48] Nothing compares to
[1:50:50] this. What a beautiful name it is. The
[1:50:55] name of Jesus.
[1:51:01] Oh, you didn't want
[1:51:04] heaven without us.
[1:51:07] So Jesus, you brought heaven down. Oh,
[1:51:13] I'm so glad you did, Lord.
[1:51:16] Oh, my sin was great. Your love was
[1:51:20] greater. Oh,
[1:51:25] whatever us.
[1:51:28] Oh, what a powerful name it is. What a
[1:51:32] wonderful name it is. Hallelujah. The
[1:51:36] name of
[1:51:38] Jesus Christ, my worshiping church. What
[1:51:43] a wonderful name it is. Oh, nothing
[1:51:48] compares to
[1:51:49] this. What a wonderful name it is. the
[1:51:54] name of Jesus.
[1:51:59] Oh
[1:52:00] hallelujah. Oh, you wouldn't want heaven
[1:52:04] without us.
[1:52:06] Oh, so Jesus, you brought heaven.
[1:52:12] Oh, I'm so glad you did,
[1:52:14] Lord. Oh, my sin was greater. Your love
[1:52:18] was gater.
[1:52:20] Oh, what
[1:52:24] could a sound? Oh, what a wonderful name
[1:52:30] it
[1:52:30] is. What a wonderful name it is. Can we
[1:52:34] stand together? The name of
[1:52:38] Jesus Christ my king. Oh yes. Oh what a
[1:52:43] wonderful name it is. Oh nothing
[1:52:47] compares to this. If you just want to
[1:52:49] come pray. Hey, come on church. We might
[1:52:51] as well. We might as well have the rain.
[1:52:53] We might as well love the word.
[1:52:56] Oh church. Oh he there. He has no
[1:53:01] equal. He has no
[1:53:04] right. Oh now and
[1:53:08] forever our God
[1:53:11] reigns. Oh yours is the
[1:53:15] kingom. Oh yours is the glory.
[1:53:19] Oh, yours is the name
[1:53:23] above all
[1:53:25] name. Oh, what a wonderful
[1:53:28] name. Oh, sing it to me. What a
[1:53:31] wonderful name. Oh, he is the name of
[1:53:37] Jesus Christ my
[1:53:40] king. What a wonderful
[1:53:44] name. Nothing compares to this.
[1:53:49] What a wonderful name it is. It's the
[1:53:53] name of
[1:53:55] Jesus. Let's just let's just have a time
[1:53:57] of prayer as they continue to play.
[1:53:59] Let's just let's just talk to him. If
[1:54:01] you want to come and pray here, I'm
[1:54:03] going to pray here with these. If you
[1:54:05] want to pray where you're at, but you
[1:54:06] just call out to him. Lord, I need the
[1:54:09] rain. When I'm in a desert, I need the
[1:54:13] rain. I I want to appreciate your word,
[1:54:16] Lord. This desert has gotten really dry.
[1:54:19] I need you, Lord. I want you to

[1:57:09] hearts, Lord, to come to the house of
[1:57:12] God with
[1:57:13] expectations, ready Lord God. Lord, I
[1:57:16] pray you bless these mothers, Lord, or
[1:57:19] to wrestle with their children, Lord, to
[1:57:21] see sometimes it's fruitless, but Lord,
[1:57:23] we know that you got it under your
[1:57:25] control. You gave them that test and
[1:57:28] that trial for a reason, Lord. Help them
[1:57:31] to persevere, to overcome. Oh God. Lord,
[1:57:34] I pray you'd heal their bodies. Pray
[1:57:36] you'd strengthen their minds, Lord, to
[1:57:38] raising the next generation with the
[1:57:39] most important job in the world. I pray
[1:57:42] you'd grant it, Lord. Oh, Jesus. I pray
[1:57:45] for our elders today. I pray you'd
[1:57:47] strengthen them, Lord. I pray you'd heal
[1:57:49] their

[1:57:55] our older folks, Lord. And they need
[1:57:57] you. So we ask you to come today. Heal
[1:58:01] them, Lord.
[1:58:04] Oh Jesus. I know some of them it's hard
[1:58:05] even to sit in the service. I pray you'd
[1:58:08] heal. Oh
[1:58:09] Lord, bring strength to their bodies. We
[1:58:13] pray.
[1:58:15] Hallelujah. Oh Jesus, we love
[1:58:18] you. Hallelujah. Bless our young people,
[1:58:21] Lord Jesus.
[1:58:23] Oh, as they go to camp,
[1:58:25] Lord, Lord, I pray the spirit of God
[1:58:28] would meet him there. As these devils of
[1:58:31] sickness are trying to keep them from
[1:58:32] it, keep them out of the house. And God,
[1:58:34] I pray you'd defeat every enemy. Lord,
[1:58:36] we know he's already been defeated. But
[1:58:38] Lord, may the symptoms go away and they
[1:58:40] be able to go. I pray you'd help them,
[1:58:43] Lord. May Satan lose his grip. May they
[1:58:46] may they receive you, Lord. May they
[1:58:48] worship you with all of their heart.
[1:58:49] Granted, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:52] Oh, we love you
[1:58:53] today.
[1:58:54] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[1:58:58] you, Lord
[1:58:59] Jesus. Oh, Jesus. I believe he's here
[1:59:03] today. You just worship and tell him, "I
[1:59:06] love you, Lord. I love you with all my
[1:59:09] heart, all my soul, with all my mind,
[1:59:12] with all my all my strength. Your name
[1:59:15] is beautiful,
[1:59:17] Lord.
[1:59:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:59:23] Hallelujah.
[1:59:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. I love
[1:59:30] you. Oh,
[1:59:33] because Sing it to him
[1:59:36] now. Love
[1:59:39] me. Oh,
[1:59:41] yes. Oh, and can we just raise our hands
[1:59:46] to all the sanctuary? Oh, I love you,
[1:59:49] Lord.
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:54] All
[1:59:57] [Music]
[2:00:00] together. Oh, that sounds so
[2:00:03] good. Hallelujah. Oh, yes.
[2:00:08] I love
[2:00:12] him. Oh,
[2:00:14] I love him.
[2:00:18] Oh,
[2:00:20] because he first
[2:00:23] hallelujah loved me. Oh, he's so rich
[2:00:27] today. Oh,
[2:00:31] and Jesus
[2:00:33] my
[2:00:38] salvation. Oh, thank you once.
[2:00:42] [Music]
[2:00:47] I was listening to a tape yesterday and
[2:00:49] I heard brother Brandham talk to a young
[2:00:51] man or young woman that had just come
[2:00:52] out a child and come to the altar. He
[2:00:55] said before they even he said the Lord
[2:00:58] did it for you. He said you were saved
[2:01:00] when you started. So when you when you
[2:01:03] left your seat you got
[2:01:05] saved. I believe today you got what you
[2:01:07] needed when you left your seat. What is
[2:01:08] it? A surrender.
[2:01:11] Some of you when you lifted your hands
[2:01:13] that was enough. God said
[2:01:15] okay. He loves you, church. You said,
[2:01:18] "Look, look and
[2:01:22] live." Oh, let's take it seriously,
[2:01:24] church. Let's love him with all of our
[2:01:27] hearts. Hallelujah. I I could just do
[2:01:30] this all day, but we won't do that to
[2:01:31] you. But we love you with all of our
[2:01:33] hearts. Sing it again. Oh,
[2:01:37] sing. I love him.
[2:01:40] [Music]
[2:01:42] Oh,
[2:01:43] why I love
[2:01:45] you. Oh,
[2:01:49] because he
[2:01:52] first love
[2:01:54] me.
[2:01:56] Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:02:00] and just
[2:02:03] my salvation.
[2:02:05] [Applause]
[2:02:08] [Music]
[2:02:16] Oh, remember this in your hearts. One
[2:02:19] day when our flesh
[2:02:23] changes, that word and he will become
[2:02:26] more than we had what we had ever
[2:02:29] dreamed
[2:02:32] possible. Oh, just let me push through
[2:02:34] the veil a little bit on this side to
[2:02:36] just catch a glimpse of
[2:02:38] it. Brother said, "If you can see past
[2:02:40] the veil of your flesh, you'd see angels
[2:02:43] at their position at every pew." Let's
[2:02:46] become conscious of it,
[2:02:48] church, conscious of his presence.
[2:02:51] Worship him like that. Come with
[2:02:52] expectation, believing God is going to
[2:02:55] take care of us. I don't want to dismiss
[2:02:57] him with his beautiful spirit, but we'll
[2:02:59] let you go. If you need to go, if you
[2:03:00] want to stay in worship, that's fine.
[2:03:02] God bless you. We love you. Oh, singing.
[2:03:07] I love you. I'll sing it out with all of
[2:03:11] your heart as you go. I I love him. All
[2:03:17] because Thank you, Lord. He
[2:03:21] first love me. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh,
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:29] and just
[2:03:32] my
[2:03:34] [Applause]
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:37] salvation
[2:03:40] [Music]
[2:03:44] for me. How great is our
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:50] God? How great is life?
[2:03:55] And how great
