Heavenly Father, we're so grateful for your love and your goodness to us, Lord, for your longsuffering. We thank you for your kindness, Lord. We thank you for that promise of going home. As I can think, Lord, many times when traveling, Lord, and we get far away from home, how our hearts long for home, Lord, as pilgrims and strangers here in this earth, we're we're we're we're longing for home. We want to see you, Lord. We we want to experience that place, oh God, where all things are perfect, Lord, and there's no pain, there's no worry, there's no sickness, Lord. I believe that right now is a preparation for that time. Pray that you'd help us, Lord, mold in us that character that would be ready to go to that place. I pray. Pray that you'd move in this congregation. Bless us tonight. May we have your word revealed to us not by a man, Lord, by your spirit. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord. Amen. Ephesians chapter 1 verses 5 and six. Ephesians chapter 1:es 5 and 6. That's my fault. Peter, Ephesians 5 and six. If you'll turn down what I turned up earlier, you can fix that. Having predestinated us. How many are glad for predestination tonight? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "I'd be a discouraged man if it wasn't for predestination." I'm so glad that we know that we've been chosen by God and predestined to go to a place. He said, "Unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved." I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the reading of the word. You may be seated as we're continuing in our study of Ephesians, but I've kind of stopped here for a little while on the subject of adoption. And I think it's very important, but I want us to remember the the backdrop of this teaching. If you go listen to the adoption series, brother Brandham has just went had the experience of going beyond the curtain of time and he's just stepped into another dimension and he's able to see uh the people that are there. I believe that he saw us there and and and he saw the people that were in new bodies and he he said, "I've taught what Paul taught and and baptized in the name of Jesus and all of those things." And they said, "We're resting on that." and and he comes out of that experience and just a little while later preaches this adoption series. And so what brother Brandham is doing is he begins to lay the groundwork. Uh and and towards the end of his life, he preaches a message called the rapture. And I don't believe that was an accident that he did it the way that he did it because everything leading up to that was actually preparation for that. In fact, Brandon makes this statement that this adoption teaching, the teaching about election, about predestination, all of these things was actually preparation for the opening of the seals. That if you didn't understand, if you didn't know who you were, then you wouldn't know about the seals and about those things that were being opened. So, it's very, very important to us because of the time that we live in. And so, that's why I'll say things like we live in the age of adoption. We live in the hour of adoption or the age of the opening of the word, the age of the open book. And we live in the time of what is that? The time of preparation. The time I'm not telling you that we already have it. I'm telling you that we're on our way. And we're farther along than we were yesterday. How many are glad to be farther along than you were yesterday? And we still struggle. We'll get into that later. We still have problems, but yet we're farther along than where we were before. So this is where we need to be. This is where our placing is. This is where our our life needs to be so we can go over there. And so we want to look at Romans chapter 8 tonight. Romans chapter 8 and verse 15. My wife's not here tonight. She uh sick at home and and uh so you'd be praying for her and each one that's not feeling well. We had a rough couple of days, but I appreciate all of you showing up tonight. I thought it might look like one of those COVID nights, but I appreciate you being here tonight. Romans 8:15 says, "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father." So the spirit of adoption, once we have received that, it takes away fear and causes us to worship. 16, the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. &gt;&gt; So adoption, I want you to notice, and we'll get into more of this at a later date, but adoption ties to the token. Adoption ties to the token being on display in our lives. And that's the fullness of our adoption is to have the token on display in our lives. We we'll talk about that maybe in another sermon. But he said, "The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit. We are the children of God. and of children than hes of God joint hes with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together. He said for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature or the creation waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God. That word manifestation is the same word as revelation. It's apocalypsis. It's revelation. Something that's made fully known. Full disclosure. So it's the full disclosure of something formally unknown. Look at the Amplified Bible how it puts it. It says, "For even the whole creation, all nature waits expectantly and longs earnestly for God's sons to be made known. waits for the revealing, the disclosing of their sunship. So, it's not making them sons. As we said, it's not adoption that you're being brought from one family to another, but it's the disclosing of sons, the revelation of sons, the manifesting of sons. It's recognizing who you are and re and and and displaying who you are, manifesting who you are. He said, "For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God." So Paul's telling them, it's not just what we have. The spirit, that's not all we're going to have. There's going to be a reality to it that is going to change even these bodies. See, even the earth that we live on, it's also considered in redemption. and it's going to be remade. It's not always going to be this way, church. And listen, no matter how hard your life gets, no matter what situations you might go through, and there's people all over the earth tonight dealing with war and struggle and natural disasters and sickness and all kinds of different things. But you got to remember this is not going to always be this way. There's coming a new country, a new city. He said, "Behold, I make all things new." How many are looking forward to that time? So we know this is not the end but this is the preparation for that. So he said not only they we know the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now. Verse 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body. So he's saying all nature groans and we groan waiting for what? The adoption, the redemption of our body. So what we're considering here is more than just another teaching or a better way of living, but we're considering actually a a a change of our bodies. So we find that we are God's children. We're in his thoughts. We bypassed our word body, our our theophony, and came to the earth to be tested. We're made subject to fall. but redeemable. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that today. If you are redeemed, it's because you were God's to begin with &gt;&gt; because that's what redemption means. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We were born in sin, came into the world speaking lies, and we needed a savior. &gt;&gt; He is that savior. &gt;&gt; If you need a savior tonight, he is that savior. How are we saved? We're saved by the by the blood of Jesus Christ. We're saved by faith in that blood. were saved by that seed gene coming to life. You could put it many different ways. Brother talked about he how he remembered sitting out by the tree waiting on parties to end at his home. And he talked about how that he always knew there was something different. He had two natures, but he said he only catered to one nature, but he had two. And and he remembered having a a consciousness that something was wrong, but he didn't know what it was. But because he it had never been he'd never been enlightened. He didn't know anything about it. He said he'd even uh he he'd camp out by the river and he said there'd be a a place where all winter long the cold and the snow would come over the bank. And he said and then there would be ice over it. And he said and then he built a fire over it. And so it had been burnt. It it had had heat and it it had cold. He said but in the spring a flower would come up. He'd look at it and said, "Little flower, where'd you come from?" Yeah, &gt;&gt; that seems pretty basic, doesn't it? But there was something in him that made him realize that there was life beyond this life somewhere. And and so he only catered to one nature, but but but the other one was there. And you always were a son or daughter of God. You may not have known it, but you always were. And brother Brandon said, "There was a time," he said, "Yet all at once, I looked up and I said, "I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Brandom." There's something calling. How many of you, Brother Brandham talked about it like this? He said, he said, "Can you fellowship with me on this thought?" He said, "That you've there's always been something calling." I think many of us could say amen to that today. We didn't know what it was. We couldn't understand it. We couldn't even comprehend it. But there's something calling. He said, "Like the little eagle, brother Brandon told the story about the eagle that was down in a chicken pin and it had been raised as a chicken. It identified as a chicken. It thought it was a chicken, but one day it recognized I I didn't I there's something different about me. I'm not satisfied with the chicken pin. And when it heard a scream of its mother, it began to change its thinking and begin to realize what it could do. It already had the potentials of an eagle. It already was an eagle. It just needed to hear the scream of an eagle. Listen, you and I already were children of God. We just needed to hear the message of the hour. It needed to strike our souls. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he said, "I'm not the son of Charles. There's something different, something calling. I'm not a chicken. There's something up yonder somewhere." Oh, great Jehovah, whoever you are, open up. I want to come home. There's something in me calling. See, you can't put that in somebody. That's got to be there. And if it is there, we ought to thank God every day that there's something in our hearts, no matter what what amount of darkness might be surrounding that seed, but there's still a seed there for the wall. And it will come up if there's a seed there at all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's got to come up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I was born again. That little life was laying there. He said the life of water was poured upon it and then it began to grow. And now that old life was forgiven, put in the sea of God's forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To never be remembered against me no more. He said, "See, now we stand justified as though we'd never sinned." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But the Brandham illustrated that by the eagle story and also by his duck story. I've told it to you before, but the duck got put in the chicken pin as well. And and he just around the farm and and and he's just uh he's just acting like it all the other birds acted around the farm. He'd never swam any in his life. He'd never seen water, only the drinking water, maybe muddy water that they put out. But the man said one day he got far enough behind the barn that he caught a scent of the pond. And when he caught a scent of water, he could smell the water. There was something in him, a deep calling to the deep that responded to that water. That's what we're looking for, church. We're not looking for an emotion or a sensation. We're looking for something in the life of a person that can respond to the word of God. That's my home. That's where I was born. That's what I'm coming from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then there'll be emotion. There'll be sensation. There'll be a new birth. There's got to be a new birth. But it's got to begin with just a with just a desire in your heart. Lord, I I believe there's something more than what I am today. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. The B said the new birth is Christ is a revelation. God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth. Now, what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together? Now, he says, "So, the new birth is a revelation. So you being manifested, you can say it like this, the manifestation of the son of God that you are, the daughter of God that you are, begins with the new birth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. That's when it begins to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And once it's started, it can't stop. Somebody's ought ought to say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Once it started, it can't stop. So once if you ever were a son, you always were a son. &gt;&gt; And so once you get started, once you may you may have temporary backsidings and misunderstandings and trouble because you live in a body of flesh, but once you're started, you can't stop because what's happened is you're beginning to be manifested. You're a seed gene of God that's beginning to manifest from the inside out. Brandon said it's like a spot of light. He said like a button. And he said that gets in your heart and it begins to grow and it begins to push out all the darkness that's in your life. He said that's when you start having trouble is when it starts pushing out that darkness. The darkness don't like it. And so you start having trouble that you the sanctification's got to happen. There's a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's got to take place. What is it is pushing that darkness out. Yes, you'll have trouble, but you got to greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. I'm glad for him tonight. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Bram says, "Then when the where the revelation is perfectly in harmony, what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together? Where the revelation is perfectly in harmony &gt;&gt; and God expressing it through his word by the same actions, the same things that he did, making the word manifest." And brother Brandon, you can hear the cry of a prophet here. Oh, if the church only knew its position. Hallelujah. I love this. It will one day. &gt;&gt; It will one day. How you going to know your position? By the message of the hour. That's how we're going to know our position. Somebody's got to preach it. Somebody's got to live it. We got to keep the church doors open. Let's keep the church doors open. Keep preaching the message. Let's keep our Let's Let's keep listening to the prophet of the age. Can we do that? Let's keep reading our Bibles. Let's keep praying because we know there's going to come a time when the bride knows who she is. It will one day. Then the rapture will go when it knows what it is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation of who you are as sons and daughters begins with the new birth and ends with the body change. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The Bible says we're changed into that same image from glory to glory. I'm not going to hold you long tonight. So just stay with me as we go through this. Maybe the most important thing that I'll say as far as this adoption series is concerned is tonight because it's something that's very important to us. We want to be a manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. We want to become what the gene seed is on the inside that we need to become that. And that's what we're preaching about tonight. Genesis 1:26, God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness. Let them have dominion." And so you might say, "Well, brother Ben, what are we supposed to become?" Well, this is what we're becoming because we know when Adam come to the earth, he was God's seed gene word uh expressed on the earth. This is what a man was supposed to look like on the earth. Right? And when he separated Eve from his side, this is what a man and a woman was supposed to look like. &gt;&gt; This is what they were supposed to look like. This is what they were supposed to do &gt;&gt; and to be. They were to have dominion. Dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, over the cattle, over all the earth, over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. That word dominion is to exercise authority over you as nations or other entities, even natural ones like animals. So, that word is it's to tread on. It's to rule. So, we were to have dominion over the earth. And how are we to do that? Brother Brandham uh kind of gives us an insight into that. It wasn't that we were to do that by natural ability. He said right now you take an axe and chop a tree down. It's a form of dominion, but it's not the kind of dominion that Adam had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz the axe had never been invented, but he had full dominion. What was it? He could speak and something would happen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You say, "How do we know that, Brother Ben?" Because that's what Jesus did when he was here. &gt;&gt; The second Adam came and when he came, what did he do? He He spoke and things happened. He spoke and the storm stealed. He spoke and the tree came back to or or died rather. He spoke and things happened. He and he told us if you speak to this mountain, if you said this mountain be removed, it cast into the sea, it'll be done even as you said. So that's the kind of dominion that we're talking about. &gt;&gt; So the Pharisees when Jesus come that second Adam, they called him a blasphemer. Why? Because he said he was the son of God. And what was he saying when he said he was the son of God? So I'm kind of hurrying through this, but I think you'll get my thought and what I'm trying to say to you. But the Pharisees called him a blasphemer and said, "You can't say that." And Jesus answered them in John 10:34 and said, "Is it not written in your law?" I said, "You're gods. if he called them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken. Say ye of him whom the father has sanctified and sent into the world that blasphe because I said I'm the son of God. So he's saying you you called the prophets gods. Then wouldn't I be would how can I be a blasphemer saying I'm the son of God? Now why were they called that? Because God backed up their word, right? What they said come to pass. Oh church, look listen. We're not talking about brother Brandham being a son of God tonight. Brother Brandham being manifested as a son of God. Jesus being manifested as a son of God. We're talking about you being manifested, me being manifested as a son of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, brother Bren said, "Now, this may just choke you to death, but did you might need that that Heimlick maneuver tonight. This may just choke you to death, but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many ever know that? He said, "How many knows that Jesus said so?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He was referencing that scripture we just read. He said he gave him dominion over all things. He lost his godship, lost his sunship, lost his domain, and Satan took it over. But brother, we're waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again. He said, "Waiting for the fullness of time. When the pyramid gets up to the top, when the full sons of God will be manifested, when the power of God will walk out and will take every power that Satan's got away from him. Yes, sir. He said it belongs to him. Who does it belong to? Belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Satan's a squatter. It belongs to you. He said he made man a god. A god in his domain. His domain goes from sea to sea, from shore to shore. He has the control of it. And when Jesus came being the one God without sin, he proved it. When the winds blow, he said, "Peace be still." When the tree, he said, "No man eat from thee. Verily I say to you, this little gods, if you'll say to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt in your heart, but believe that what you said will come to pass." You can have what you said. He said, "Now the world and nature is groaning, crying, everything's moving." &gt;&gt; What? for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; When true sons, born sons, filled sons, he's talking about me right here. &gt;&gt; I hope he's talking about you tonight. True sons, born sons, filled sons, speak and their word is back. &gt;&gt; He said, I believe we're on the border of it right now. Yes, sir. Say to this mountain, let it be so. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; True sons, filled sons, born sons. Oh my. I I tell you what, church, we're we're we're we're on the on the cusp of something. &gt;&gt; And and and I believe we're we've experienced something and we've got something maybe we don't even realize. Brother Brandham gives some examples of that. And one of the examples he gives is that someone would say uh he said a Christian, a believer would come and say, "I don't uh my crops are burning. I need rain." And I I've always wondered, "Well, why wouldn't the believer just speak it for his own?" But maybe that would be because there'd be different levels of people of believers who've come to different stages of maturity. But he said he they would come and say, "My crops are burning. I need rain." He said, "And this manifested son of God would stand there and say, uh, I call for rain." Have you heard brother Random say that? &gt;&gt; I call for rain. And the rain would come. &gt;&gt; Right? I know we're sitting there thinking, "Well, I'm a long ways off of that." How many times have you sat there and looked at a storm coming at your picnic and thought, "I'm just going to speak that out of existence and it didn't happen." Now, be honest with me. That didn't ever cross your mind when you were about to face an inconvenience of some kind and you sit there, well, brother Brandham spoke a storm. Jesus spoke a storm, right? But brother Brandham taught us that was by inspiration. &gt;&gt; Right? It had to come by inspiration. I I I want to show you something here because that potential is in us now. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; See, when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, all the power that ever was in the universe &gt;&gt; is in you. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, you take a spoonful of water out of the ocean. All the p all the same chemicals that are in the ocean are in that spoonful. &gt;&gt; It's the same, but it's a portion of God. So, that's already in you, Brother Joe. It's already in us to be that. You say, "Well, why do I have to deal with the things I deal with now?" Well, let's see. Let's look at it for just a moment. It's it's important, I think, because you know, we realize that the fullness of manifesting of sons is the millennium. Now, I don't want to put off something to the mill all things to the millennium because we need to be careful about this because some people put healing off to the millennium and &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and brother Brandon said, "Why would we need healing in the millennium?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. I believe that we can speak the word right now and things can happen, right? &gt;&gt; But there's going to come a perfection of it, a fullness of it, and the reason will be because we'll be in new bodies. But did you ever wonder why is there a millennium? I've wondered that. I'll be honest with you. I thought, Lord, why have a thousand-y year reign? Why not just fast forward? Because I'm a cleancut kind of guy, you I'd rather just get it over with. And when Jesus comes back to the earth, why reign for a thousand years and let the sa let Satan come back, right? Because he's already a healer, a redeemer. The church mystery of the church has already been. But there's got to be a time. The Brandom taught us that that that the thousand-year reign that that was had to be that day had to be fulfilled. So there had to be a there had to be a finishing up. There had to be the sons of God had to come. But the B said they would have come by the spoken word in Eden, but they didn't come that way because Adam fell, &gt;&gt; right? And so now these redeemed sons, you and I, are going to be in the millennium. Well, what happens during the millennium? During the millennium, we rule and reign with Christ. So, it's the manifestation of sons and it's the entire purpose of the thousand-year reign is that we would be the manifested sons of God. &gt;&gt; Let me show it to you. Brother said, "See, they're gods, fallen gods. They get a domain. The world, they're supposed to take care of it. The trees and animal life, everything is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God when they'll be manifested on the earth. Everything's waiting. Every earthquake is because the earth is waiting on us. right to put it back in order again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The the world is groaning. Every every tsunami, every hurricane is waiting on the sons of God to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And and so he said they're supposed to take care of it. He said, "Oh, come Lord Jesus is my prayer." He said, "Oh, that great millennium when they'll be manifested." He said, "We're getting ready now for this time to come. The church has got to get ready." Why is brother Brandham telling us these things? Why did we have to see the manifestation of the third pole and the spoken word? Why do we see a greater move of the Holy Spirit during the time of brother Brandham? And even today, we see a supernatural working of God. We see the vindicated message of the hour. Why did he have to do it the way that he did it? Because it's time for the manifestation of the sons of God. But the fullness of that is a millennial reign. What does that tell us? We're right there at the door. We've got to be &gt;&gt; because he would not have sent this at this time unless it was almost time for the sons to be fully manifested. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And right now that manifestation is taking place in our souls and even in our bodies when it comes to the Holy Ghost having control. But there will come a day when it'll take place in its fullness. You understand? You say, "Well, I I'm a I'm a full I I have the fullness of adoption." Then why do you get sick? Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. Why Why do you get old? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That's not the kind the fullness that I want. I want a fullness that actually puts me in a new body. &gt;&gt; But we have the word that's taking us to that. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; We're We've already been, as I've said before, we've been placed in the roller coaster. &gt;&gt; You know, there comes a point of no return &gt;&gt; when you're not in control anymore. &gt;&gt; Right. There's a time when you could get off if you wanted to, but there comes a point of no return. There's a roller coaster in Branson that takes off at a very fast speed. Some of y'all know what I'm talking about. It takes off very quick and and when it does, it kind of you kind of catch your breath. You know, up until that moment, you could say, "Hey, wait a minute. Let me off." And I've seen people do it, but once it takes off, it's gone. And there ain't no getting off until it reaches its destination. We're already on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Listen. Don't let Don't let you We stress so much about what other people are doing. We stress so much about what other churches are doing, other preachers are doing. I do it, too. We stress so much about what our own church is doing. We stress even about ourselves, about our families, and we think, "Oh, you know, this one's wrong and this one's wrong and that one's wrong." If we could ever just get to the fact and realize we've already been stepped in. We got a word that's taken us home. God's big enough to get us bride. Let's just believe him. Let's just accept him. Let's just manifest him in our own lives. &gt;&gt; Instead of worrying about what everybody else is doing &gt;&gt; the word has already been spoken. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to see the manifestation of the son of man again. It's already been shown. He had to speak. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. We've been taken to a mountain and he spoke in this age. Hallelujah. God's proven that a a son could speak things into existence that weren't even there. I believe that ought to give us faith for a rapture to speak a body into existence one of these days. &gt;&gt; If we really believed it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Again, brother said, "All the world is groaning, waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God, waiting for the church to get back in its place again, sons of God to be made manifest. waiting for that hour. The church is so far away from its place. It needs to be back to be sons of God again, rulers, governors of the earth under the spiritual reign. It will be someday when the chief one comes. Jesus Christ, the great millennium. Nature is groaning for that day. It's groaning for that day. Oh, church, I'm ready for that day. We are redeemed back to reign over the earth. We're we're going through what we're going through now for a reason because we're redeemed back to reign over the earth. Revelation 5:9. We just read it, I believe, Sunday. But it says they sung a new song saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals. For thouast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and hast made us to our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth. What caused him to know that? It was the opening of the seals &gt;&gt; that caused them to worship under their adoption under their under the oh God under the reality of of the fullness of the word for their day. So, Brother Brandham tells us anything that's redeemed is something that's been lost. &gt;&gt; It's something that's been lost and then it's been brought back again. What does he bring back to us? This lamb. Everything we had at the beginning. &gt;&gt; What did we have at the beginning? Eternal life. We was heirs of the world. We had life. We never had to die. We never had to be sick. &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. &gt;&gt; We never had to be sick. Aren't you glad there's something more &gt;&gt; than what we have now? Listen, Paul said, "If in this life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable." &gt;&gt; Right? We're not looking to this world. Oh, I hope we start looking away again. I I remember, you know, I I I feel like an old man saying this, but I remember back in the day it seemed like there's a lot of songs about heaven and now there's a lot of songs about earth. And I I like those songs, too. But I think maybe we need to sing about heaven again and begin to look forward to some things. And the reason people sung, especially in the depression era in this country and and when times were hard during the civil war, they sang a lot of songs about heaven because the earth was so horrible. It was such a terrible experience here on the earth. We've gotten used to things and it got a little bit easier, but it's still hard sometimes, isn't it? We still get sick. We still get worried sometimes. We our minds play tricks on us. We You still get old and you can't you you can't stop getting older. &gt;&gt; Everything you try to do, you just can't beat that. You can do plastic surgery and everything else. You'd never be able to be You can't keep yourself from getting older. But we've got there is a place where people don't get older. There is a place where we never had to die. We never had to be sick. We never had to get old. I pray that we'd sing about that place. We'd we'd pray. We'd ask God, "Lord, come quickly. Come quickly. We're we're we're going through some things. Come quickly. Come Jesus. Come as the songs come." We We've been waiting so long. Amen. It's time to go home. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I believe it's coming church. And the story doesn't get old to me. I don't care how many years we're here. We need to preach it just like that. Tomorrow we might step into another dimension. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We never had to be sick. We never had to get old. We never had any worries. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; No funerals, no graves, no evil. I think the absence of sin is an underrated part of heaven. &gt;&gt; Could we say it that way? I don't think we realize how much sin bothers us. &gt;&gt; And I mean not just us, but the world that we live in. &gt;&gt; It vexes even Lord. It vexed his righteous soul. Sin vexes us. Not just the world's sin, but our own. Many times our own disobedience. But there's a world where there's no sin. No evil, no death, no gray hairs, no stoop shoulders, no mourning, no crying. We had life eternal. We had the jurisdiction over all the earth. We were just a god. That's all on the earth. Walk about. And if this tree didn't look right standing here, we'd say, "Be thou plucked up and set over here." And it would do it. &gt;&gt; Listen, I couldn't even move people in the sanctuary if I wanted to. I don't want to move anybody. Don't get scared. But if I want you to sit in a different place, you know that that necessarily wouldn't necessarily happen. Some of our brothers who've had to seat people in meetings know that's the truth. We can't always put people where we want them, much less trees, right? You just can't do that. I got some trees I've been talking about removing from my yard for years now. One of these days I'm going to get around to it. Why? Because you just can't do that here. You can't do that. But we're going to a place because that's where we came from, right? He said if the winds was blowing, we didn't want the winds to blow. Say, "Peace, be still." &gt;&gt; And he do it. And what did he come to do? Now look, to redeem all that back to us again. Get all that back again. &gt;&gt; And now nature in itself is groaning, waiting for what? the manifestations of the sons of God for the sons of God to be manifested. Now listen here here's here's what's important and we have the earnest of our salvation. Now I love this can take our brother that's dying with cancer stand with that little breath of redemption. Pray the prayer of faith over him that will turn a shadow of a man back to a healthy man again. What will we do when our full possession comes? But we've seen what God could do in a prayer line. How many have seen what God can do in a prayer line? We've seen what God could do by laying on of hands. We've seen what God could do in a meeting. We've seen what God could do in a church service. We've seen what God could do with this little breath of God just by the preaching of the word. He said, "Could take our brother with cancer and and and pray the prayer of faith over him and the cancer would leave." He said, "What will we do when our full possession comes if we've seen what he could do under the earnest? What could he do under the fullness of it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've seen what he did in our bodies. We've seen what he did in our souls. How he changed us, made us new. What will we do when our full possession &gt;&gt; comes? Nature knows that. Nature's groaning and we're groaning with it. Nature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God because nature was cursed with its master. when his master was cursed the highest and nature fell with the master. But when this kinsman redeemer come, hallelujah, redeem back the man. That's the master over nature. And all nature is waiting for the man. Master and the master is the sons of God that was given this earth. And now God will have his heavens of course. But this was given to man. And the kinsman and redeemer come to redeem us back to that we lost. When the work is finished, we have all things again. What kind of all things? We have all power. We have eternal life. We have eternal health. We have eternal youth. We have eternal power. Oh, we're just eternal with the eternal. And then we're all waiting for that time to come. Waiting and groaning and waiting. Look at 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and 16. If you have your Bible, turn there with me before we close. 2 Corinthians 4:16. for which cause we faint not. But though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day, there's the son of God, right? And we get looking at the outward man and say, "Well, that's not a manifestation of the son of God." No, the manifestations on the inward man. &gt;&gt; See that the outward man perishes? It's got to go to the dust, right? This mortality must put on immortality. Yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. So he said, there's a purpose in our affliction. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. Second Corinthians 5:1. You realize the chapters are man-made. Right? So the chapters in the Bible aren't necessarily inspired, but this is a continuation of Paul's letter. Look at it. Verse verse one. For we know, so he says four, he's continuing his thought. For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God and a house not made with heaven with hands eternal in the heavens. How many believe it today? We already have a building of God. So there's a body waiting for us. For in this we grown earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven. If so be that being clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do grown, being burdened, not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life. We don't want death. We want life. That's what he's saying. We're not groaning for death, brother JT. We're groaning for life. Death's going to come if we live long enough, &gt;&gt; right? But but Oh, God. But we're groaning not for death, but for life, for a new body. Oh, that we would be clothed upon immortality might be swallowed up of life. Now, he that hath brought us for the self-same thing is God with who also hath given us the earnest of the spirit. So, do you realize what this the spirit is? The spirit is the down payment on a new body. &gt;&gt; That's what Paul's saying. The spirit is the down payment. It's the same thing brother Brandon was saying. The spirit is the down payment. So the oh the the the the new birth is the beginning. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the fullness of our adoption, the new body is the ending. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So you've already began changing into what you will be. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So he said, "All creation is groaning," said Paul. "Everything is groaning. Look at the trees how they struggle. Look at the flowers how they struggle for life. Look just for the frost to tear them down. Look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches out to sing glories unto God. Everything, all nature, all animals, all birds, how he flies from the enemy quickly. So, Brother Brandham identifies the fact that the Ryan that a bird tries to get away. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. If you go up to a bird and and you scare it, it flies away. It won't do that over there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But over here, it's cuz nature is groaning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said he flies away from his enemy quickly. Everything groaning. And we ourselves said, Paul, we grown with them for we are waiting for the redemption of our body. But now, now they did all those years until now. &gt;&gt; Now we have the earnest of our inheritance. Oh my. What do we have? What do we have tonight, church? I know it's Wednesday night, &gt;&gt; but what do we have? We have the evidence that God lives. &gt;&gt; We have the evidence that God is with us. Hallelujah. We have the evidence that God has not forsaken us. That we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that cries out. What is that? The spirit of adoption that cries out abba father. And there's nothing can ever take that away. We are anchored in Christ. &gt;&gt; Now the trees does not have it. Nature does not have it. But yet we are still groaning with them. Look the tree don't have the earnest. The nature don't have the earnest. We have the earnest. &gt;&gt; But yet we are still groaning. What's groaning? Our our bodies. &gt;&gt; Oh God. He said we are still groaning with them. Because as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption, &gt;&gt; but we have the earnest of it that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of God. What kind of people should we be? Oh my. When we think of that and then in other ages they didn't understand that they thought they could be saved and then they could be lost. But brother Brandon brings in election and teaches us election and predestination because he said you got to know that as a preparation for the seals &gt;&gt; why oh church cuz the seal was going to tell you who you are &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; was going to reveal who you are and we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it as we receive the Holy Spirit. It is the earnest of our complete adoption or complete salvation. So don't get discouraged where you're at. Don't get discouraged. You say, "Well, I haven't come very far." But if he's given you his spirit, what was that spirit, brother Ryan, that he gave you? It was a down payment. He made a down payment, an investment in your life that said you're going to body's going to be changed one day. You're going to come to a new body. This world is not your home, but you're going to a better place. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. waiting for the fullness of adoption. He said this will take place when at the first resurrection. It's &gt;&gt; when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body. &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is and we will be like him. Brother Brandon said it's just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of what will be. &gt;&gt; Right? So what we saw with the prophet when he spoke squirrels into existence, what you've seen in a minor form in your own life as you begin to walk with the Lord, what you see now is only a minor to what will be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he appears, we appear in his likeness. He said we will have a body like his. A glorious, glorified body. &gt;&gt; I love this. And all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little mist &gt;&gt; and blow away to never be no more. Just you wish you could you could just get your troubles gone like that. Just just a mist. The high blood pressure, the struggles with your weight. Some of us struggle with our weight. We struggle with our kids. Not me. Me, I got perfect kids. But everybody else, we struggle with our with our health. Struggle with allergies. And I live in probably the allergy hot spot of the world. It seems like we do in Arkansas. We struggle. But that don't mean that don't mean we should just make life easier on oursel. But what is the struggle? The struggle's for a reason. It's for a reason. Don't you wish you could just blow it away? Well, one day it will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll fade off in a little mist and blow away to never be no more." He said, "But brother Ben, why do I struggle now? Why? Why do I struggle? Why do I have to struggle? What's the point of it all? Why? Why? If I'm predestined, if I'm elected, why do I struggle? Musicians, go ahead and come. I'm I'm done tonight." Why do we struggle? Why do we not have the fullness? Now in Romans 8:16, we we may have missed this part as we read through that chapter, but I want to bear down on these two verses 16 and 17. The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then heirs, heirs of God, joint hes with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. See, you can't be an overcomer unless there's something to overcome. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him." Angels will not reign in the millennium. Who's going to reign over the earth? Sons and daughters of God, &gt;&gt; right? Angels will not reign over there. They will not judge the nations. We will judge angels. Why? Oh. Oh, church. We just realized tonight you have to suffer to reign. The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a victory, not a gift. [Music] See, because God could not give you. Think about this. Your trials give you something that God himself could not give you. And that's the character to rule. So, he gives you trials. [Music] He allows trials to come your way. No wonder. No wonder Peter said, "Count it all joy." No wonder Paul said, "Praise him always, all the time, and all things praise him." Why? Because when you this this little trial that you're going through, the struggle that you're having right now is a gift from God. He couldn't gift you character. Character is not a gift. What do you have to do? We had to put you on a free moral agency. Put you down here on the earth. Let you make decisions. Let you make sometimes wrong decisions. Let you go through struggle and trial and maybe get born a certain way with a certain handicap and a certain struggle and all your life you struggle with that. You say, "Lord, why did I have to struggle all of my life with depression? Why did I have to struggle with with this uh with this kind of outlook on life? Why did I have to struggle with this this disease or this trouble or or my family or something that that that is endemic to my my area or something like that? Maybe you struggle for work and you struggle for those things and really what it is is a gift. It's a gift cuz he could not give you character. So he gave you trials. He allowed you to have trials. Character is a victory, not a gift. A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic. Oh church, but power with character is fit to rule. You see why we had to go through the time that we've gone through? Why we're here when we think we should have went home years ago? He's building a character in you and building a character in me to take us to a better place. Place where all of our trials will just blow away. Be gone like a mist. I'm looking forward to that. Aren't you? Bow your heads with me for just a moment. [Music] or Jesus. Even tonight, I've struggled and to preach and I think, Lord, that that maybe illustrates better than anything, Lord, as we struggle in these bodies. But God, we know that there's a purpose in that struggling. That in our struggling is overcoming, Lord. And I see maybe people that come to the church tonight and didn't feel like it. And maybe some that worked all day and had a hard time getting you here, Lord. But there's a character in that, in that struggle, in that trial, in that overcoming. There's a character in that. And I I pray you'd help us, Lord, to understand that, Lord, not to be weary and welloing, but to recognize there's a reward for everything that we've gone through. I pray you'd grant it, Lord. I pray Lord that you'd help us to understand there's a better place a fullness of our adoption that we're going to we would not be so satisfied with this world Lord not a health wealth and prosperity gospels we see taking over so many places and so many pulpits but Lord it's a it's a gospel of suffering but a gospel of overcoming we thank you for that Lord we thank you for all that you do for us you bless these people now ines Jesus name. Amen. Thank you Lord. Let's just worship him a moment. He was there all all the time. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he was there? Even in the struggle waiting faith lead in life. [Music] Oh, he was there all the time. I'm so glad he was there. He was there. He was there all all the time. Let's stand together and sing it. You need prayer. Be glad to pray with you tonight. &gt;&gt; He was there. &gt;&gt; He was there all the time. Oh, waiting patient in life. He was there all the time. Do we know the verses to that? Time after time. Oh, time after time I I went searching for peace in some for I was trying to blame all my ills. I was trying to blame all my ills on this world. I was in surface relationships. Oh, surface relationships [Music] used methods used me till I was done. All the while someone was begging. Hallelujah. And all the while was begging &gt;&gt; to save me from sin. Sing that chorus now. He was all the time. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Oh, he was there. &gt;&gt; Brother Joe, God bless you tonight until the time waiting patiently [Music] in life. He was there all the time. And after all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain top so tall. We're looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I'm going to make it after all. With all your hearts now. Oh, after all this life is over and our burdens have been lifted and we stand upon the mountain top so tall. All looking over in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I'm going to make it after. Oh, sing it one more time with all your hearts. You believe it tonight. Oh, after all, this life is over and our burdens have been lifted. And we stand upon that mountain top so tall. Hear the king Lord in that city that the Savior is preparing. It gives me faith that I can make it after all. Give the Lord a big hand clap of praise. Amen. Amen. You appreciate the word of the Lord tonight. Amen. We're going to sing God is good all the time as you go now. God bless you. We'll see you Sunday morning at 10:30. Go on the fear of the Lord. Well, God is good all the time. He puts a song of praise in this heart of mine. God is good all the time. In the darkest night, his light will shine. God is good. He's so good all the time. [Music]
