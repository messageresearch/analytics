that and U certainly love the Lord tonight amen amen we'll just kind of Minister on filtered and and the right attitude the right desire and the right kind of Faith Titus 2:11 for the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lust we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world can you say Amen looking for the Blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of Good Works amen you could be seated may God just bless his word are you happy to be here tonight amen amen we look there a me he gave himself for us that he might redeem us and that word redeem there is and we've preached on Redemption quite a bit but that that word redeem is to re to release on the receipt of a ransom to redeem to liberate by payment of Ransom to cause to be release to oneself by payment of Ransom to redeem to deliver from evils of every every kind internal and external that word purify there is to make clean to purge to make pure amen uh to redeem my wife told me not to say man every every other word so I try not to do that but um but he he he's Our Redeemer Amen to redeem us to purify us unto himself a peculiar people A peculiar people a people selected by God as his own possession Amen to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world I Believe by God's help we can do that I believe he has a people amen that amen as the word says a church without spot or wrinkle or with any such blemish that is Washed by the Water of the word A peculiar people zealous under good works Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said Christ has risen and has paid the price for our Redemption you believe that tonight that he's risen amen he's alive what God in Christ manifested he gave that flesh and that blood that in the blood might come the life and the flesh might be redeemed that God in this redeemed flesh your redeemed flesh could manifest his word for this day as he did in that day he said Woo glory amen by God's Redemption amen we become his body we become his subjects amen he paid the price for you and I amen he paid the price Amen to to live through us to manifest himself through us so we become subject we become subjects of Christ yes just as as the the wife is subject to the husband we ministered upon that uh the last time the wife is is subject to the husband and so is the church subject to the headship of Christ the word Amen to bring us to a place Amen to present himself a church without spot without wrinkle or any such blemish there's nothing found in her no blemish amen her attitude is pure her desire is pure anden she has a perfect faith and a perfect God and in a perfect word yes sir good all that them snowball fights has got y'all wore out like up now there will be a little bit of snow left after after today not if brother Harvey has anything to do with it though he's the snowman he's going to get it out of the way we appreciate him overseeing that and hey we're having church amen so we're his redeemed subjects we become subject to his leading subject to his power subject to the correction of the word nobody likes to hear that but under headship come on now under the headship of the word the body must move as the head says move the intelligence comes from the body and the body is subject to correction if if God doesn't want the body to go here if Christ the word doesn't want the body to go here you and I amen we correct that and we go where the leading of the spirit would take us we become subject Amen to him amen subject to be put through the filter of the word amen we want to be Christians filtered Christians not dirty not as the world not caught up in the things of the world and the things of this life but we want to be filtered by the spirit of God Amen our attitude amen filtered by the spirit through the word of God filtered our desires everything filtered through the word that word filtered is to remove unwanted elements to be filtered is to be subjected to that process right to be made clean we must be subjected to that process and as we said before that process produces something or someone that can be desired for use God has has a use for you and I and and that is to be the pure word bride in this hour to be Sons and Daughters of the word amen filtered product amen that God desires by the infallible by the absolute that we have received the infallible word amen that we have received in this hour the infallible inspired word has come amen and purified a virtuous people zealous unto good works amen true sir amen amen amen amen I can say it how many times I want amen yes sir in the thinking man's filter this is kind of where I got the the idea or the thought from this sermon he says here when you come into this world you were born in sin you didn't even come with a Fighting Chance you love sin your your desire was to sin but he said but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that begin to draw come on yes sir so amen there was something in you to draw amen amen through that word that you heard there was something that could respond to that amen no no matter how bad you were no matter the condition that you were you and I no matter no matter what we were caught up in no matter how bad we got there was something that be to draw in US amen there was something when you even when you were doing wrong amen you knew you knew you were different you knew you weren't supposed to be doing that there was something drawing in you it was that Jing seed of life that was wanting to to come out and to be manifested and when you heard the word amen something drew you right something begin to draw out right amen something begin to draw out and and you could begin to draw amen from from what you heard good yes he said you didn't have a fighting chance but down inside you there was something something he said something told you there was a god somewhere and he said there was there's different filters there was there was a church filter when you tried to come to come to God there was this idea and this type of filter there was he said there was denominational filters and filters of men's ideas he said here but when you use God's filter which is a thinking man's filter and you should go and listen to that sermon there's so much in that he said because all the other filters will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter a thinking man's filter he said there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and that's what we're trying to do here tonight we're trying to draw from the word of God Amen to be everything that God has called us to be and if you'll draw if you'll if you'll draw if you'll hunger and seek after righteousness amen it'll produce the Holy Ghost in you nothing but the Holy Ghost yes if we spend our time feeding on other things that's what we manifest but the Holy Ghost feeds upon the word that's what gives you strength that's what gives you and I the strength in this hour when we can feed upon the word word and the spirit of God in you that's what it needs is to feed upon that so you to draw your desires he said there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost he said now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is that your soul that soul of yours will line with the word of God in every respect it shows you've drawed your life through the thinking man's filter God's filter he said Washed by the Water of the word there was something about the word in this hour when you and I heard it it Dro us yeah you say well I was born around the message I I was just going to hear it and there's been many that's been born around the message that's heard it but they're gone they've left they've turned back but you're still here there's something in this hour that has draw you young people there's something in this hour amen if you'll if you'll open your ears if you'll draw from that it'll give you overcoming power it'll give you overcoming victory in this hour amen you don't have to be defeated but you can have victory over every enemy over every adversary over every trick of the devil God has given us Grace in this hour to overcome Amen to have a church amen in this present World in this present Le toan age a church that draws from the word a church that amen embodies the Redemption amen that he brought amen he said when you heard the word you knew where you came from all right he said you know that was the truth you were always the seed was in you always the word he said the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world and the word and you come to it when you heard it you come to it because you and the word amen the word that you heard predestinated it was predestinated for this age and you were predestinated for this age and God placed that seed within you he placed that word deposit upon you and when you heard the predestinated word the word that was allotted for this age amen it struck something in you amen you could hear all kinds of things but when that word came when that word came there was something different about it there was a voice that cried out saying my child come up out come up out of this world come up out of these men's ideas and these filters amen that of men's ideas and come up to the filter the thinking man's filter yeah amen and from that filter you can draw this this evening you can draw from that filter whatever you have need of we don't have to go out looking for for anything else we've received the thinking man's filter in this hour I know it's simple tonight who is this mesic he said and when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that Spirit and the spirit spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest quicked Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible says don't do this the body quickly turns to it there's no question 1 Corinthians 6 you love the Lord tonight am we'll try to get you out of here soon as we can 1 Corinthians 6 I don't have the verse there I'm sorry it says here know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor adulterers nor adulterers nor feminine nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revelers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and Paul said here and such were some of you but she are washed but she are Sanctified but she are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God yes amen God called you and washed you and redeemed you for a purpose and to be Sanctified is to be cleaned up and set aside for service and so God when he does that he doesn't just clean you up and set you up on a on a shelf but he did it that he might fill you with his spirit that you might be subject to his Spirit subject to his word amen God has a purpose and why he called you and why he done what he done in your life amen he has called you to do something amen I say tonight let us be Servants of God Amen Let Us amen if we've got to be the one that sweeps the the floor let us be the Servants of God if we got to be the one that that that sweeps the snow off the parking lot so we can have church let's be the Servants of God come on now somebody amen let's do something for Jesus amen if God done something for you amen and you don't quite know what to do brother Brandon put it like this if you go to work for a man and you don't really know what to do go ask that man what he wants you to do anden you're on that man's payroll if you're just standing around amen I don't like nobody just standing around with their hands in their pockets amen amen come ask me I'll find you something to do amen and God's got something for us to do be a servant be a real servant of Jesus Christ in this hour go ask him what he what he wants you to do yes he's called us to be servants he's called you to be a son or a daughter of the kingdom and we're not of this world Sons and Daughters of the higher Kingdom we don't act like the children of this Kingdom right we've we've been called to come a power to show forth his praise to show forth amen the godliness amen and then this wicked L to see in the darkness amen God has called a people to shine forth a light to shine forth in the Goden of Jesus Christ yes sir I want to say this evening he didn't save you to lose you either he's got a purpose for you amen if God's done something for you stick with it stay with it the devil will try to take you out of the economy of God the try the devil will try to amen get you get you to ride the highs and the lows amen but a Son of God a seed of God Amen brother the Bible says a seed of God remaineth in him he you can no more sin you can no more fall away yeah we'll make mistakes we'll do things wrong amen but a true Son of God a true seed of God though we get knocked down we'll get back up again amen sin shall not overtake you the unbelief of lead deia shall not overtake you why because the seed of God remains in you the word and you heard the word amen you've been predestinated you've been called just as the message just as predestinated it as it was to come you're just as predestinated to stand in this hour for that truth yes sir right that's true brother brand put it like this he said a Son of God he said you you can no more die than God can die right and God can't lose you if he lost you he would lose himself yes sir amen when you can get the Revelation that I'm no longer the son of or daughter of who my parents are but that I'm a son and a daughter of God the devil quit kicking you around when you can come to that Revelation amen that I'm a predestinated son or daughter of God in this hour the Devil he's got to quit kicking you around you you're identified you know who you are yes sir yes good we're part of God and so when we come through that filter when our when our attitude and our our desires are changed and we come through that filter amen God doesn't just take you out of the world and and and let the world stay in you but he's called us to be different he's called us out of this lay this see age and this condition to be different to have a different idea a different attitudes towards the word and man he's called you in this hour to inherit the kingdom yes and God like I said God he he didn't just take us out of the world but he takes the world out of you right we don't have to just be called out and and and wander about and just carrying the same old thing but that same God that calls you by his word cleans you up sanctifies you by his Spirit brother the ROM says here he says what kind of people would it be this morning if this Bram T Tabernacle this morning was so filled with the presence of God why when did you ever use your own mind and and ever use your own thoughts didn't have no uh ultimate ultimately of your own just to be led by the spirit is that what you want in this hour just to be led by the spirit amen amen to be led by the spirit of God yes sir myad just y'all know how these things go but brother BR said what the brandom Tabernacle does not take your own thoughts not take your own thoughts but to be so wrapped up in the mind of God to be so wrapped up amen that's what we want to be here tonight amen to be so wrapped up in him yes thank you brother Joel yes amen he says here when that human element goes out and the spirit of God fills that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then when the church amen when in the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving that's where he's trying to bring the church in this hour that's where he wants to bring you and I where our motives where our objectives is just to do the will of God where we can draw from the supernatural Amen to where we can be so cut off from this Earthbound from this Le Dean mentality and the of the material and the material things of this world Amen where our words aren't just for nonsense and for Fric amen but our thoughts can be his thoughts our words can be his words amen where you can as the scripture says when you can say to this mountain be thou removed yes amen he says here when then your thoughts will become his word words and words will become material and then that's when the church is in its power yes is that where you want to be tonight to draw amen so draw from the mind of God so draw from the word of God where is deity speaking through you yes and S we would see Jesus he says now we get ourselves worked in with a human element of time and the only thing we know is inches feet yards miles measurements hours months and years but God is eternal we have the limited powers and limited elligence but God is infinite in all things he knows all things he knew all things before the world began he knew this meeting would be here tonight he know all things was there because he could tell the end from the beginning that makes him God nothing else no one else no other being no other person could ever do that but God now we sometimes wonder why he's so great and yet we don't seem no more than we do oh if we could just draw amen from that tonight if we could draw from the Eternal if we can see him amen as he is as God and draw from his omnipotence draw from his power amen amen that our attitudes could be changed amen draw from a God that knows all things amen draw from a God that knows your situation that's already working everything for your good amen he's working everything he's got everything in control yes true we've got to correct our thinking yeah we got got to be willing to be subject to the filter yes amen we got to be willing to come and and and say I've been thinking about this wrong or I've been seeing this wrong right 2 Timothy 3 and16 all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thorough furnished unto all good works so it's the it's the inspired word amen the scripture amen was given by inspiration it is to us the inspired word and brother R says salvation is not based upon what someone else thinks it's what it's what you think of him Divine Healing isn't based on what the critics say or what the church says it's based on your perfect faith in the inspired word of God and how your inspired to believe that's what brings the results is your inspiration by the word what does it do for you what does it do for you that that's the question that he ask what does it do for you and I amen is it where we draw our inspiration from is it is it where we draw our life and our breath from is it more is it more than life to you that's what it's got to become amen it's got to be more than food it's got to be more than drink it's got to be more than a good time amen but it's got to be something that that you need to sustain you something that's lifegiving Amen in this hour that's what we've got to have something that inspires us something that we can feed upon something that will lift us up out of our condition amen something that'll that'll make us say man a th 50 times whatever it takes amen amen amen something that we can enter into something that that rings a bell something that strikes inside of you it says amen that's for me amen that that's who I can be the the word the word has it amen and I can have it yes yes sir I'm just preaching tonight you love the Lord so we draw we draw from the inspired word yes and every bit of it's inspired you believe that yes every bit of it's inspired not all my words are inspired but you can bet every bit of that is inspired that is God and letter form and you can draw from that Jesus said my words are spirit and they are life and there's virtue that we can draw from those things amen we can receive from God's inspired word and that's what changes amen when when inspiration strikes the believer amen and taking God at his word amen it changes your attitude it changes your situation it changes your outcome do you believe that in his word he says if if by my stri you're healed I can be inspired by that amen that inspires me because I believe that's true I believe that's for me if he said I can be saved by his grace and then I can be saved you can be saved if he said he's the same yesterday today and forever amen that he's not the I am or the I was but he's the I am I can draw inspiration amen that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I can look for that in my situations I can look for that in my circumstances I can look for that in this service here amen and know that there's needs among us know that there's people that need God and know that he's the same if he ever healed if he ever saved amen he's still in the healing and saving business yes sir amen we're drawing inspiration from the inspired word it's life sustaining strength do you believe that amen he says here he says here that it's Prof profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction amen we need all those things don't we we need to hear those things we need to hear Doctrine because we want to know what what the right kind of Doctrine is and Doctrine will give you instruction it'll give you direction that you know how to operate that you know what's right that you know how to believe that you know how to stand right yes amen we've got to be able to to follow instructions and and my son he likes to build Legos and if you're going to build those things you got to follow the instructions you can't just rip all the bags open maybe maybe some of y'all can but I can't you take one bag at a time one two three my son he likes to rip all of them open and and throw them together and you got a mess but you've got to follow the instructions and if we don't follow the instruction in of the word if we don't follow the instructions of what a messenger taught we're going to have a mess you're going to you're going to build you're going to build something and you're going to get so far up and you're going to realize that something's just a little bit off and if you would have taken your time and and followed the instructions you could have built the thing up as you went but what what we've got to do if we built something wrong we got to tear that thing down we've got to tear down we've got to come back to the right Doctrine we've got to come back in under correction of the word and build that hang up properly it can be done it can be done but you got to be willing we've got to be willing to break ourselves down amen when when we come confronted with something where we're wrong we got to be willing to be humble we've got to be willing to to tear ourselves apart to be built back up right right so we need these things we need we need the correction and the true teaching of the word and so he he said it's it's profitable for reprove something that would bring conviction correction that word correction restoration to an upright State a correction an improvement of life or character amen we need to be constantly reminded constantly reminded of these things you say I've heard these things over and over over and over well maybe the person next to you hasn't heard it maybe these young people haven't heard the things that we've heard through the years and so you think why is the preacher preaching about that why is he that's so Elementary well there's a lot of young people here right they've got to hear the things that we heard they've got to they've got to come and on the right foundation and I pray that we can give them the right kind of foundation the foundation that was laid by The Prophet by the apostles and our lord Jesus to be built up Amen to be the Oracles of God to be the household of God Amen where the Holy Ghost can come down and where the Holy Ghost can come down and indwell in that house that's the TR the kind of house we're trying to build I'm just preaching tonight Lord help me instruction and righteousness amen the state of him who is as he ought to be to be right with God that's what his righteousness is to make us right with God who wants to be right with God I don't want to be on the wrong side I want to be right so we've got to come under the correction of the word we've got to come under the teaching of the word yes to to bring us to a state approved of God to bring us a place of integrity and virtue a purity of Life a rightness and correctness of thinking brother R had a slogan he said think right that's your duty to yourself do right that's your duties to God so think his thoughts Bible says if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things Amen Let the Holy Spirit take the word and correct our human flaws the Bible says whatsoever you do in word or indeed do it in the name of Jesus Christ amen if you can't do it in his name then don't do it at all if there's a question where something's right or wrong then don't do it right Ain that what brother R Todd or we just say wwjd what would Jesus do right as simple as it is and what what would he do Lord help me to do that yeah Proverbs 3:11 my son despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he corrected corrected even as a father the son in whom he delighted so love love is corrective right and we correct our children not because we hate them or because we want to be mean to them but because we love them if they're out playing in the street and where they ought not be we're not going to go out there and say well you can you can play out here if you want no we're going to be Stern we're going to say don't play in the street because we're trying to protect you so love is corrective am man if our children are harm In Harm's Way it constrains us to correct them we don't want to do it but but we must do it if they're doing something if they're doing something wrong you've got to show them where they're doing wrong by love and many times when when we as Sons and Daughters of God when we do wrong or sin it's because of a wrong attitude right it's because of a wrong attitude amen how many of us have ever found ourselves with just a such a Negative atmosphere and a bad attitude and that will drive the very spirit of God from your life a bad attitude of of of what somebody done done against you or just the way things are going or or you didn't like that this was said or whatever and a lot of times when something's done that person didn't mean to do it they didn't really know what they were saying but we took it just a little too far and we become in a bad attitude and we said things and we done things that we Lord help us Lord help us tonight but that will drive the very Holy Spirit from your life the holy spirit is gentle like a dove and it takes brother R said it takes acting like a lamb again for that Holy Spirit to come back Paul told the Ephesian Church grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you're sealed to the day of your Redemption so you can grieve that away the dove will take its flight right yes Ephesians 4:31 he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away you from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another verse 32 tenderhearted forgiving one another even as Christ's sake ha forgiven you so let all bitterness leave and that bitter bitterness is like a like a bitter fruit any of you ever took a a Pon they looked real orange they look good they look mushy even but you bite down and it's still bitter it wasn't R yet it was bitter but the the bitterness and the sweetness has left him he said remove all malice and and that word malice is to do to have ill will to desire to injure amen that that uh he said it's wickedness that is not ashamed to break the law now Jesus wouldn't do that would he you can't do wwjd there Jesus is not going to do that he's not going to have ill will and if if you've got ill will towards somebody where you know I wish I could get by with this if I could just you got that ill will if I could just take them and you know that's not the spirit of Christ is it it's not boys beating up on each other like that come on now boys will be boys m fight all the time but that's a fallen nature and when they get that that nature it'll take that fight out of them amen it'll take that malish out of you we like to play around there's nothing wrong with playing around but I W take it too far now right a filter somebody says some to you somebody does some to you filter that thing out let it go let it go it is those things aren't Worth to and over it's not worth your time it's not worth the spirit of God being grieved from you right and Jesus said forgive amen and you can be forgiven and Peter asked one time he said how many how many times should I uh forgive my brother that that's offended me that's done wrong he said seven times and Jesus sitting there thinking his head I know what Peter's going to do seven times and he's done he's going to smack somebody that's what Peter's thinking and Jesus knew this he said no Peter 70 * 7 you must forgive yes sir can you say Amen tonight amen we may not be able to forget but we can forgive we may not be able to forget but we can forgive we can move on we can let things go right I don't know why I'm preaching this amen we you know we we can't we can't re uh forget but I'm so thankful tonight that there's one they can't remember when I do wrong amen and when we can confess when we can confess our wrongs and put away in the blood amen and it goes back upon the Devil there's one that that's that's I'm justified in his side amen as though I never done it in the first place amen we serve a God that can forgive and forget you don't have to carry that thing amen God's not sitting up there stewing over what you done yesterday over what you done last year but my God wants you to walk with him he wants you to serve him as sons and daughters in this age amen amen don't live in the past amen God has provided a blood for you and I amen amen when we're Washed by the Water of the word brother R said it's a bleeding word amen it's a blood amen amen the word bled for you and I amen and when you receive this word amen you come to such a place to such an identification amen where you're justified in the sight of God as though you never done it in the first place never before I don't mean to spit on you boys Lord forgive me never before has there been an understanding amen amen where there's a people that's walked the face of this this Earth with the understanding of you and I amen that we were Justified as though we never done it in the first place don't beat yourself up over what you did last year amen move forward as brother Ben he's been preaching amen press forward Press On In The Name of Jesus Christ amen Be The Light press through the darkness amen the darkness will try to overshadow you the darkness will try to come around you amen but be ye the light of the world Amen oh Lord oh Lord Lord yeah don't let sin and indifference keep you from the presence of the Lord yes amen don't let it Rob you in the joy of your Salvation let's let's stand let's be corrected by the word and let's move forward amen let's come back to the blessing blessings of God and the joy of the Lord God is looking for those that'll surrender to the filter of his word amen those who will surrender themselves to his cleansing power do you believe that Amen to make you pure to make you holy to make you that unadulterated bride of Jesus Christ to stabilize you in this hour that we can be dedicated to him sometimes that to get to that place it takes correction amen I need it you need it we need those things to remove those things out of our lives that don't need to be there amen 1 Peter 5 I'll try to hurry here 1 Peter 5 and 5 likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder and all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble I love that I've always loved that word humility there is humbleness of Mind loneliness of mind to have a humble opinion of oneself a deep sense of moral littleness modesty a loneliness of mind but God resists the proud and that word resist there is to ra to to range and and battle against to oppose oneself against so God is in battle against the proud and that word there showing on above others overtopping conspicuous above others preeminent so you're you're up here you're up you're even up here above God you're up here above the word you're up here above correction you're up here above anything right maybe you feel like you've arrived maybe you feel like you don't need nothing else you don't need nobody to tell you nothing else but none of us are in that place none of us from the greatest to the least none of us are in that place he says humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he May exalt you you don't exalt yourself but God exalts you in due time casting all your cares upon Him for he carth for you you believe that he says and humble thyself you know people want power and really they don't know what power is they don't know really what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble you can get see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself and then you've got more power than the man that runs over the building and makes a lot of noise see because you've been able to conquer yourself commit yourself to Christ you see to to humble yourself before him that's really power amen we want to have the right attitude we want to have the right attitude we we don't want to think of ourselves up here you don't want to you know you don't want to be way down here but as Sons and Daughters of God we want to come to our position right don't think of yourself to is absolutely nothing come on but you're we're we're not above each other amen we must walk with the word we must walk in humility with the word if we're to ever receive amen our lord Jesus he says here in expectation we always get what we expect when people expect anything well they usually get you usually get what you look for it's the mental attitude that you have remember this and never forget the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude he says it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal the sick people he says any person in here has a right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and to feed him on the grounds that he could stand on you believe that tonight he said if you can look right at it and believe it the way it's written and say God it's your word and take the right mental attitude that Divine promise it'll bring it to pass he said because there's no defeat he said Faith can't be defeated and and there's no defeat to Faith amen amen it's your promise you've taken the right mental attitude amen you've taken that word as it's yours you put your name in there you've wrote amen your name on that check you filled it out amen you believed it you've received it amen it's Anchored In Your Heart it's yours amen there's no devil that can move you off of that all right he said when the true spirit of God can come in on the word is being preached Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of of God and the true spirit of God gets a hold of that word it'll manifest every promise that God has made it'll bring it to pass amen with the right mental attitude if you can get the spirit on that word I say tonight let us surrender to him let us surrender to him and let him come amen amen amen the same as you were amen the word but you need the spirit amen to come we need him to come in this hour we need to be able to draw amen from the promise of God Amen to be different you believe that tonight Matthew 15:21 we'll just finish up here okay you go play in the snow whatever's left of it Matthew 15:21 and Jesus went then and departed in the coast of tiar and sidon Behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is vexed grievously with the devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came beside him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the House of Israel notice this then she came and worshiped him saying Lord help me the right attitude right approach but he answered and said is it not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said to her woman great is thy faith be it unto the even as thou Wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour this woman had a serious need but she had to approach him correctly she had to to be able to say the right thing yes and he says here in perseverance now this woman sarap phenician he said first she said thou son of David and a gentile has no hold on Christ by the son of David that was through King David the race of the Jews he never paid any attention to her cuz she hadn't have no claim on him there but when she said when she turned and said Lord help me he said that got him brother brother said that caught the attention of the Holy Spirit and when you can say the right thing maybe maybe our our maybe her approach was wasn't exactly the way it should be but the word corrected her the word corrected her said I'm not sent to you and she said yes that's truth Lord that's truth Lord but I need your help yes so she was willing to be humiliated she was willing to take this correction because she knew from him she could draw what she needed she knew from from him she could draw the health for her daughter the healing that she needed brother R says here I was finished with this he said that little woman was really persistent she held right on just spare me I'll do anything that you want me to do oh there you are that's it this little woman no matter what the difficult was she was persistent she had the right approach to the gift of God she had the right approach humility she fell down in his feet amen we got to come the right way if we can come the right way we can draw from him what we have need of Our Lives can be filtered we can be made clean we can be made whole if we have a need for a loved one we can come and draw that for them if we approach him the right way amen there there's been a word sent in this hour brother Joel preached this morning about an absolute there's been such a a perfect word sent in this hour for a perfect people amen and through that if we can draw that we will become that church without spot or without wrinkle or any such blemish that that Jesus wants to present to himself that's what we've received in this hour and that's what we can draw from to make us what we should be she came in worship Lord help me simple she didn't have to jump up and down she you know when we didn't answer the first time she didn't turn back but she stayed with it she stayed persistent and that's what God is wanting from you and I amen let's just stand this evening let's just worship him tonight let's catch the attention of the Holy Spirit throughout your week say things do things that'll catch the attention of the holy spirit amen that his power can fall Upon Our Lives amen what's that song uh draw me
