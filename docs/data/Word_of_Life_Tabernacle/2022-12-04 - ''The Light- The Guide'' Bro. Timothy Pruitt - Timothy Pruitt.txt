glad to have him and uh each one of you and to have brother Timothy with us brother Timothy has been a friend for a number of years and uh I've probably 20 years or or something like that ago that we

on the table Lord if there's something for me maybe your healing could come this morning those of you that are home sick and watching this morning you say my healing I need my healing and my body maybe my healing could come today maybe my the salvation of my children my children could come if you're a sinner today you could come down to the Altar and and give your heart to the Lord or where

know that you're more than enough for any situation any problem any struggle any heartache God you are more than enough we ask the Lord did you just help us this morning Father to step out of the way and let you speak to your people Lord we as Lord you minister to hearts and touch lives and strengthen your children Lord we're in a dark time and but Lord we're thankful Lord we're not that we're not without light but light is shining Among Us and it's a Marvelous Light that'll drive back any Darkness any anything that's that's moving and touching your children the darkness of this world there's a light that can push it back we ask that that light will shine this morning light of God would just shine in our hearts Lord to know that you are alive and you're a well and you're living among us fathers we love you now and appreciate you and you [Music] and Jesus amen let's turn the Bibles to Exodus 23 if you would I just like to say it's quite an honor to be here with you this morning and and uh we appreciate all the prayers that you have prayed for us through the loss of my mom in situations that we've been through been a difficult time but the Lord's been good to us and we're thankful for that and he's been there for us and you know and we're also going through a lot of other changes in life um yeah we're getting a lot older and that's not fun because you get older you're not only are you getting older your kids are getting older and so now I'm in just a little over a year my third and one is getting married and it's next weekend and a lot of changes happening so I'm getting ready to be a grandpa that's what I'm that's what I'm I heard that's a pretty good deal and so that's what I'm looking for the next steps and so I told him that's the only reason why I was letting them get married so I can have grandchildren so amen but uh you know it's real real privilege to be here it's a special place to me here at this uh church because it's back years ago when I first started ministering the Brother John lafonte and brother Mike also would let me come up here and Minister as a young man and Minister and uh always a real good atmosphere and easy place to preach and I'm looking forward to that again this morning amen so uh amen God bless you today bring you greetings from our church and my my pastor and father brother Tim said to be sure and tell everyone hello for him and it's in his greetings and it's just good to be in the house of the Lord amen it's always good I was glad when they said unto me do you have that gladness in your heart today to be in his presence Exodus chapter 23 and verse 20 also John 16 and verse 7. could turn there but this scripture is hard to read without just becoming emotional about it because this is to know where we're at and what time we're in and to know that there's a first Exodus the second Exodus and now we're in the Third Exodus and and just know these words also pertain to us and he says here in verse 20 he said behold I sent an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee and to the place which I have prepared Amen to keep thee to bring thee to a place that I have prepared John chapter 16 and verse 7 says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that he shall speak and he will show you things to come and he shall glorify me for he shall receive a mind and shall show it unto you amen God bless you can be seated I like to I've been on this thought for some time at home on the light uh because I look at the darkness that we're in and we're in a great time of Darkness but we're also in a great time of light and a lot of times it's a lot easier to see the darkness that's around you and the things that's going on around you in the situations and sometimes it begins to begin to look hopeless and and you look helpless but they may have to remember we're not alone That We're Not Alone by ourselves but there is someone that is with us and this morning I'd like to speak to you about that someone on the light the guide because I believe he is a God and he promised that he would never leave us or he would never forsake us but he would be with us even in us until the end of the world and that's a promise that I can depend on and you can depend on and it's a wonderful thing to realize amen that no matter what you're going through the situations in your life you're not alone amen it's one thing to have a father it's one thing to have a mother but this was not your father telling you this it was not your mother telling you this was this was not some great friend of their of yours telling you this this was Jesus Christ himself saying I will never leave you alone but I'll be with you even in you and and you know he's there not to just be us bystander or or just a spectator but he is there walking among the candlesticks he is involved he is he is moving he is touching he's orchestrating you know many times we think that that it's all out of catering it's all out of control but there's nothing in this world that's out of his control it doesn't matter who's in power whether to be Democrat Republican or this that and the other dictators it doesn't matter they're all under the control amen the ultimate control of him is because he's working everything according to his plan so therefore we cannot get so skewed in our thinking that the devil's got this and he's doing this and we give him so much credit but God is moving and he's touching and he's changing and he's moving he'll raise up kingdoms for a while and tear him down and he'll raise up another and put him in down because he's moving according to his word and he's a God he said you know a guide is someone to show you around you have to have a god when you don't know where you're going and a God is someone who's been there before they they have went through that before they have dealt with that before they have made choices there in that moment before and they know exactly where to move or how to do and that's why they're called to God you know one time I was in Paris and I went there with my wife and brother Danny Steam and sister Michelle and you know we we you get there and it's a total different language it's a total different culture it's a big huge City a bunch of bunch of conquer I call it a concrete jungle but it's a beautiful place in a lot of ways and a lot of architect but I didn't want to go there by myself I I ain't that kind of guy that wants to just drop in a city and learn all about it myself I wanted somebody who had been there before I wanted somebody who knew the language who knew the routes who knew where we needed to be and what time we needed to be there and how we needed to get there and so I I got a guide and there was a sister that went to a church and that was able to come over and be there with us and she knew the language she'd been there many times amen it made things a lot more enjoyable and a lot more easily because there was somebody who had been there before there was somebody could say no we don't want to go that way no this is shut down today we can't go there they knew all the languages they could speak to the taxi drivers they could tell us if it was a good she could say no this is not a good path or no that's a dangerous place you don't want to go she had been there before and this is God you know he's he's been here before he was here before you ever got here he knows exactly the climate you're in he knows exactly the situation you're in amen whatever situation you're in this morning he's already got somebody else out of that situation he's already dealt with things in life and situations that you think sometimes are so hard and so impossible but God has already been there he's already directed lives down that path you're not the first one to go through what you're going through you're not the first one to face difficulties you're not the first one to go through trials there's many that he has led through these past before and he has not lost one of them amen amen what a God I mean there might be gods that lost Hunters they might have lost passengers they might have lost this or that but this God has never lost to one but he has brought every one of them safely to their destination and this is the god that was speaking he said I'm bringing I'm sending my angel before you and he's going to lead you and guide you you're going he's going to go through great he didn't tell him about the Red Sea he didn't tell them about all the situations they was going to face he said but I'm going to be with you and not only am I going to lead you and guide you but I'm going to bring you to a prepared Place amen I'm so thankful for that that we have come in this time in this great time of darkness and darkness all around us and situations of every kind and it seems impossible that somehow we're going to get out of here but God said we're going to get out of here God said there's going to be a Rapture God said he's going to have a people for a Rapture and so he's going to guide he's going to direct he's going to move he's going to move obstacles he's going to move you around obstacles he's going if he can't take you round it above it or right he'll take you through it whatever he's got to do God's gonna get you to the destination to the place that he has prepared for you amen a God must know the way he must know exactly where the dangers are he must know exactly where the pitfalls are he must know exactly what trails you need to build on what trails you don't need to be on he has to be studied he has to listen to God when he got them out of the he got the children of Israel out of Egypt you know it looked like maybe he didn't know what he was doing it looked like he had got him lost it looked like they were entangled in the wilderness but God knew exactly what he was doing he was taking them down a certain paths and and so that I so the thought or the their path would get back to pharaoh and Pharaoh was like man they're lost they had look they supposed to be going this way they're going that way didn't Moses learn anything while he was in Egypt didn't he learned how to guide by the Stars didn't he learn but it wasn't Moses it was God now it was the pillar of fire that was God lived it was a pillar of fire who had already been there before he had made the mountains he had put the Red Sea where it was and he had placed it there amen not for their destruction but for Egypt's destruction and he had brought them to that place not for their destruction but for Egypt's destruction Hallelujah when you begin to realize God has brought you to a place not for your downfall not for your destruction not for your amen for you to go down but for you're the devil that is tormenting you for his destruction he's allowed this age to become what it is and he's opened the river's Euphrates and he's allowed every devil to infiltrate this place and to bring them into this place that we're in why not for your Destruction for his destruction not for your demise for his demise to bring you to a prepared Place amen a God is a select man if anything happens to you it's his responsibility Hallelujah he's got to take care of you he's got to see that you don't get lost it is his responsibility come on preach God has signed himself up to you he is concerned about the path that you're on he's watching over you he's leading you he's guiding you amen the Church of the Living God is not being led by the mental the mental ability of a man this church is not being led by a man this church is to be led by the pillar of Fire and it's what is leading the Church of the Living God it ain't a man it ain't my seventh grade Kentuckian preacher that's leading this church it is the pillar of fire this lit it wasn't Moses that was leading the children of Israel it was the pillar of fire that was leading he was the god and he's still the God today and therefore it is his responsibility it's not my responsibility amen so much to get a people amen for to make a people he came and to get people ready for a rapture amen amen is him that it's going to take care of you he's going to make sure you don't get lost he's going to make sure that he can come and move in the right moments he knows exactly where he's at regardless of the weather I don't know regardless of the storms that are around you he knows exactly where he's at regardless of the situation you're in he knows exactly where you're at Hallelujah aren't you glad you got a god like that that he don't ever get lost there might be Gods out there that get lost but this guy has never been lost this God knows exactly no matter how dark it gets how stormy it gets amen that he was out there on the Sea of Galilee and it got all stormy but he knew exactly where he was at come on somebody you might your boat this morning might be rocking and rolling and waves crashing all over you but the God knows exactly where you're at and he knows exactly how to get you out of where you're at he's a wonderful God you know what brother I don't talk about that in the God he said you know he said that we the guides they look at the stars they they they look at the North Star they pull that out and of course you know the North Star represents Christ the same yesterday today and forever others might wonder away but he Remains the Same and he said so they watched that but he said just in case there's clouds over that there's other ways that God can look he can look at a tree and he can see the bark and he can see which side it's on he can look at the Moss he can try and if he said if he can't even see it he can reach over there and he can feel it amen he puts his fingers upon it amen aren't you glad this God can put his finger on your life amen he knows exactly where things are going and which way they're heading amen he said you see on this an ordinary man can go up there and fill that tree and don't feel no difference in it he said but the God has been trained for he said he ever he said you ever see a man that was lost that every Everybody ever experience of being lost if have you ever been lost out in the woods it ain't a fun experience I remember as a little boy me and my dad went squirrel hunting one time and and we got turned around and we kept coming out and we thought for sure the truck is this way and and we'd come out on another Highway way way and like man how do we do that go back in the woods and come back out in the same place it's crazy you get on this walk and you keep going around brother Brandon talked about it on Superstition Mountain and all and then you get get it what's called an Indian death walk and that's what the world we see the world or you know they're walking around in a circle they're walking in a death march why because of Darkness they're lost you wonder why the world is going insane he goes in there and he talks about a man that went out in the wilderness and became so lost and lost his way and he said he actually went completely insane to where he didn't even know who he was he didn't even he thought he was an animal he thought it's all kinds of things he lost his ability to even think properly and this is exactly where we see the world why are we seeing the world in the condition that they're in it's because they've been in dark is too long they've been walking in darkness and the longer you're in darkness the more you lose your mind the longer in darkness and the longer you're lost the worse it gets and they've lost their mind to where they don't know if a man's a man or a woman's a woman they don't know they can identify as a cat and put a litter box listen this is the world that we're living in why are they in the condition because they went off without the guide and they have lost their mind and they've lost their ability to even think as a normal human being can think they can't even think they've lost their Compass to where they don't even know moralities no more to the point they've lost themselves and they can't even tell if they're a man or a woman or a dog or a cat I mean it's crazy oh we got people in rural Louisiana and Rural schools that you thought they wouldn't even be possible identifying as cats and dogs and doing I mean why because they've been in darkness too long they're going to preach and they've lost their minds to where they can't even reasonably figure things out as a human being it ought to be reasonable enough as a human being to know if a man's a man or a woman's a woman that ought not be too hard but they've lost their abilities because they've been in darkness because they have wandered away from the light and they've left it a long time ago but God has sent a God in this generation amen is not a man it's himself he has come down in our generation he has come down not to just be a bystander not to just be watching over and just look at this one over here falling looking no he has come to put himself in the journey he is leading he is God and he is moving he is she moving you from Glory unto Glory he died he he comforted her during the times he said I will not leave you but I will send a comforter amen and he will come he'll guide you in all truth I am the way the truth and the life I am the word in the beginning was the word the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it said if we follow the real true God the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit he was to tell us what he had seen what he's heard and he'll show us things that are to come man what a God ain't it awesome to have a guide who can show you where you're at where you've been but also where you're going yes you're talking about a GPS system amen you don't have to worry about him get having to say reroute recalculating I didn't know that that was down there you ever been on a GPS system and you get down they didn't they didn't tell you the bridge was out next thing you know you're down a dirt road and you're all lost and the GPS don't even I remember a brother that was coming to our family Camp years ago Amen brother Milko and his flew he flew in from Canada up there by the biscals church and he flew into Shreveport now a Family Camp was just 20 miles to the west of Shreveport or so 20 30 minutes and he didn't know that he thought it was at our church so he put our church address which was way at that moment it was that old church it was out in the Boondocks the GPS couldn't even get you there and he puts our address in there and he takes off down to Homer Louisiana and he goes down these little pig trails and they he gets down there and all of a sudden the GPS says you have arrived he looked around there wasn't nothing but pine trees and a little old trail and he said look he said I looked at that dear sister on that GPS how he said he said I looked at this I said dear sister you might be where you think you are but I ain't where I need to be he said because this is not where I'm supposed to be there ain't no church here amen GPS can leave you out somewhere and not tell you but this God knows where it bridge is out this guy already knows where difficulties are and situations are and he is here to lead you and guide you and he is so determined that I'm going to bring a bride to a prepared place I don't know he's not gonna leave you out in the wilderness somewhere he's not going to leave you lost somewhere but if you're a child of God God's going to bring you all the way and there ain't enough devils in hell that can pull you away from this guy but there's got to watch over you this guy will lead you it's got to bring you he'll hold you he'll do whatever it takes I got a bride that's got to be in a prepared place at a prepared moment and they will be there listen he's not gonna this God is not gonna have one set at a table not filled it ain't gonna be a table it's a thousand miles long or whatever it is however it's been you know to try to be described we don't even really understand I know how it's going to be really be like but I can tell you one thing there ain't gonna be a tables Place set and not a person sitting there somebody every place that has been determined it shall be set that has been predestinated as a place there and there's going to be a body sitting there there's going to be a person sitting there and neither is there going to be a person show up that didn't know they was coming that he didn't know they was coming he knows everyone he has placed them there he put them there before the foundation of the world and the devil has tried to stop you the devil's trying to hinder you the devil said you're not going to make it but God said I got a place prepared for you and there ain't no devil in hell it's going to keep you from it I don't know about you but that gets me worked up that's me stimulated to realize I got a place and my name has been put there and the devil can try to rub it off and he can try to say it ain't so but God wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life and there ain't nothing the devil can do about it and the God is going to get me all the way [Music] Hallelujah we have a god it's God's provided God Amen man has tried to God and they left a bunch of wrecks and they left a lot of trains off the tracks by a man trying to get it in God well I've been sent to do this and they try to put their way in but you can't substitute anything for this guy if you do it'll take you off the line the God knows the way he knows every inch of the way I love that so whatever inch you're on the God knows about it he knows every inch of the way he knows every thought he knows everybody that's here he knows who you are what you've done and all about you you may have hit it from your mom and your dad or your pastor this that and the other but you ain't hit it from the god the God knows he's God's guide the Holy Spirit amen he'll revealed things to you tell you what he's heard he can repeat your words right back to what you said what you said yesterday that God knows amen I know he knows I you know what I tell you what that only happened to brother Brandon's day the guy is still here brother Branham was not the god he got the guide used brother Brandon but brother Branham was not the guide he was a star yeah I'll get to that in a minute but he was not the guide amen but the God was is there leading the church all the way he still repeats conversation he's still to the discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart you know we we it's just too good to leave out we had a sister one time that had been a beautician you know and she had it in mind that she needed you know cut her hair and things and so she she comes gave her heart to the Lord and and baptized in things a few few years or so down the road she got up one Sunday morning and she said you know to her husband she said I don't think God really cares said I got these dead ends here on my hair I need to clip them off so my hair grow right you know and things and so her husband was like ah you know what the word says about that and trying to talk to her and he's got to go to work and and he's he's like uh you know I I you don't need to do that please don't do that and she said well I just don't think God cares I'll tell you what he said I'm gonna go to church this morning and if God cares about it brother Tim will say something about cutting hair and if God don't care he won't say anything at all now it ain't like we get up every surface and preach about cutting hair you know I don't and so but that service by the town's preaching on he ain't preaching on hair and he's going down the road and all of a sudden he stops he says Sister Mary he said just like I told you when you gave your heart to God no more snippy snip sniff that still goes today wow tears just flooded out of her heart she knew God cared about that amen and God does still care about his word amen he's going to make sure that it's fulfilled he's going to make sure he's got somebody there that he can fulfill it through amen when Israel left Egypt to go to the promised land god knew they had never traveled that way before amen but they needed something to go with them or they'd lose their way so he sent them a God he said I'll send my angel the pillar of fire to keep you in the way to guide you to the promised land and the children of Israel followed to God the pillar of fire Cloud by day about pillar Fire by Night Cloud by day amen when it stopped they stopped when it Journey they journeyed Moses couldn't do this with all his learning he tried and all he did was produce one dead Egyptian he couldn't he couldn't deliver them with all of his learning he couldn't deliver them with his intellectual abilities and neither will any man deliver a child of God by intellectual abilities it won't happen the only way there's true freedom in the house of God is when the god comes the holy spirit is let loose to be going to move and to touch and to change hearts and this God was not was to come to provide all that he knew what was already needed yes sir listen to this I this is quite amazing excuse me I've been having little issues with my voice but we're going to go on through it says Moses and the people this was sent to me by Brother Andrew Spencer and it's quite quite amazing most of the people are in the desert and what was he going to do with all these people that had to be fed and feeding two and two or three million people requires a lot of food it requires a lot of food for just what we got in here it's just what it is it takes a lot of a lot of efforts and it's not just you know just something really but can you imagine two or three million people according to the quartermaster General in the Army it is reported that Moses would have had 15 had to have 1500 tons of food each day to feed this many people do you know that to bring that much food each day requires two freight trains at least a mile long each remember you they were in a desert so they'd have to have firewood to use to cook the food this is going to take 4 000 tons of wood and a few more freight trains each a mile long just for one day and to think they were 40 years in transit oh yeah they was going to have to have water so to have enough water to drink and to wash the dishes that they had it was going to take 11 million gallons each day and a freight train with tank cars 18 1800 miles long just to bring enough water for one day they had to get across the Red Sea at night if it was a narrow path double file this line would be 800 miles long and will require 35 days and nights to get through it so there had to be space in the Red Sea three miles wide so that they could walk five thousand the breasts to get over in one night but then there's another problem each time they camped at the end of the day the campground was two-thirds the size of State of Rhode Island was required a total of 750 square miles think of it this much space just for camping do you think Moses had all this figured out before he left Egypt you think you think he thought well I I okay I got this plan over here we're gonna make this you know when you go on a trip many times you got a lot of things planned well I'm gonna stay here this night or I'm gonna stop here I'm gonna do Moses didn't have all that figured out matter of fact when they left Egypt they apparently went the wrong direction he you know anyway it wasn't because Moses chose to go this way it's because the pillar of fire went that way amen so do you think God has any so with all of this if you think of all this you think God has any problem taking care of your need come on yeah and we can supply all of that and he supplied water out of a rock the most impossible place to get water and he brings that then people think well you know brother I'm talking about he said people get a mental thought of a rock having a little trickle he said this wasn't no little trickle this was a gusher it had to be to feel fulfill the desires of almost two whatever million people and then they're livestock and then all the things had to do with it do you think God could could take care of that that he can't take care of you oh yeah amen he can take care of all your needs or if they're physical Financial spiritual God is more than enough he's got it already figured out he's already done this before it's quite amazing when you think about it the parallels between the three Exodus you see where we're at the first second Exodus we'll read about it a little bit later too it was the killing of the uh was the killing of the of the newborns killing of children what have we got in this day people don't care if you kill an unborn child they're right in the streets for their rights to kill babies how dark are we when a person would get out and ride in a street to kill a baby and not only they wanting that they're wanting the ability to choose to either kill them or whatever amen even after birth and we got message people that's kind of went along with this idea of a woman's rights of choice come on people hurry come on how dark are we down people have become so affected by the darkness that their thoughts even go that way right and we see it right on the first second and third Exodus the killing of The Unborn or the new other babies and then we see then we see also in the first second third Exodus was also amen great Darkness it was darkness in Egypt it was Darkness there amen at the death of the Cross and it's also Darkness now but also I want you to understand that every Exodus there was the pillar of fire there was the angel of God to come and Lead his children and he's not going to give up now you know nature needs a guide people with science calls it instincts but is actually the guide they call it you know you know somehow it's pretty amazing that people can become so educated to become so stupid is I mean that they think that that that these animals do what they do because they somehow evolved from a little blob and they got the abilities to do what they do because of evolution that's pretty amazing it takes a lot of faith to believe that it takes a lot of faith to believe that what we're living in right now started with a that takes a lot of faith it takes more faith actually I think or to believe than a creator but they think that it could be just a just a bit just somehow in this vast Mast of nothingness Unlimited vast of nothingness these two little pieces of something come together and somehow they somehow they got together somehow in this vast mass of nothingness and they there wasn't a big bang all right did you know that there was a big bang but it was the voice of God that said let there be yes sir amen and he said let there be light and it was and so and God created he created male and female he created all the things that are upon the he created these things it was out of something more than our little p brains it was a vast mind of almighty God that he can make things so seems like that they're still yet today discovering man is so smart that they're still today discovering things that have been here for years and thousands whatever our many kind of years yeah they're still discovering them yeah and they think they got this all figured out come on now and they think that you know well this one does this because it evolved that way no it does that because God put it in there yeah brother Brian talked about the geese he said they ain't never been to the South the Ducks they ain't never been to this all they they were born in the Frozen North yeah and up in the 90s it wasn't Frozen when they was born but they was born up in that area amen that you'd think that wasn't possible in here they're born up in here but all of a sudden he said he said all of a sudden something will begin to change in the atmosphere and he said that little coldness will come down and start freezing the pond edges a little bit he said the next thing you know he said there's a little duck he said that God had put something in him to be a leader and he goes out in the middle of that pond he begins to make a racket a noise he starts splashing them wing and he starts making his quacks or his honks and he starts Gathering other ducks start gathering around him he said what's causing that he says something on the inside of him says it's about to get bad up here we need to go somewhere else and he said he gets and he starts flapping him wings and he starts seeing amen this Frozen atmosphere coming around him he's like I don't want no part of this I don't want nothing to do with this Frozen atmosphere and the pond Edge is freezing up he said I don't want it to get no worse than what it is now I'm getting out of here oh come on now are there any ducks in the building tonight that's I don't want nothing to do with some frozen atmosphere I want to get out in the Middle where God can move and God can touch and God can anoint me to rise up come on amen God has a people that's not going to be anointed by some frozen atmosphere but they're going to be anointed by something on the inside I got to have something real all right he never even felt cold weather before but he knew he didn't want nothing to do with it I've seen Ducks they'll hear a false doctor ain't never heard it before they don't want nothing to do with it come on [Music] that coldness of that old false doctor starts coming in and starts freezing up the joints and they can't clap and they can't raise their hands no more they can't say Amen no more what is it it's a frozen atmosphere well a real duck don't want nothing to do with that no no he'll start honking he'll start making some rackets hey man he'll start throwing a little fit up in his mouth Little Bill started honk honk honk honk he says such a jubilee starts happening right out in the middle of that pond and all of a sudden he'll set them Wings down and he'll fly off that pond and get up in the air and turn four or five times and go straight to Louisiana I'm sorry he didn't say Arkansas Louisiana just as straight and hard as he can go why he's a god come on the Ducks know their God he said but the church does it they'll lie he said they'll allow Frozen atmospheres to come in and they'll sit right there until they freeze slap to death he said our Sonos he said some old geese he said he said there was no Gander one time thought he knew where he was going he said he'd LED them all the way over to England somewhere yeah yeah and he said he said they got over to England he said they'll get up and they'll fly around a little bit and they'll fall back down again he said they don't know how to get back to where they really belong he said because they didn't listen to the right guy he said there was another old Gander that flew him right into a Mountainside one time because he didn't know where he was going and he wasn't listening to the guy he said that's a way of some geese he said he'll swarm they'll have big protractive meetings have some revivalists come along preach a while don't know where you're going swarming around I know people want to use that amen but he said because some Gander leads you off on a denominational spree come on now we're not going off on some denominational spree amen you know people want to say well you know a bunch of brother man priests against emotion he preached against and he you know he's caught him because they they reject they would take the emotion but they rejected the word well the difference here is I get emotional because of the word oh yeah I'm not a rejecter of the word they may have been a rejector of the word but I'm not amen and I want to tell you something there's something about this word that stirs my heart when I see I don't have to stay where I'm at I don't have to stay bound I don't staff have to stay discouraged I don't have to stay depressed you know brother Timothy you really have to pray yeah I have faced depression I have had issues in my life I have went through hard times in my life I went through darkness in my life I went through some hard trails in my life but the God never left me and when I see his word being revealed to me how dare you think that I ain't gonna get out in the middle of that and help myself a little Revival and head straight down to where the warmth and of the word can be preached where it warms my heart amen amen touches my life he said I've been preaching the gospel for 33 and a half years he says I've never seen this God fail and I have to testify of that as well how many can testify come on now let's testify of this God I've seen it tested seven times around the world all kind of religions and many as half a million at one time standing there never has it failed I don't speak from some book I speak from a personal experience I know that God stands behind his word and honor if you have some kind of creed you better watch out he said but the holy spirit will back up the word of God he is the word he is the guy in the beginning what's the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us oh my he said Peter was led by the god to say in Acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin then the God will take you from there that's the thing to do first repent of your sins oh yeah unbelief you disbelieve things repent be baptized in the God will take you from there amen is your duty to repent it's your duty to be baptized but it's a God's duty to take you from there oh yeah Hallelujah and lead you on Mark was led by the Holy Ghost the god this is this is a quote to write mark 16. and I know there's many in the messages want to take that out somehow we get away from laying hands on the sick and we get away from prayer lines we get away from altar calls we get away from that kind of stuff because we got more now we got the word well the word needs to be demonstrated the word is not just a word and not word only it comes in spirit and Truth right it has to be demonstrations and power and God moving and orchestrating it ain't just a bunch of dead letter amen but the God put it there and if the God put it there why are we or any other man trying to take it out you're going to lead people to destruction you're going to leave people down in the wrong path you're going to lead them into the side of a mountain to their death amen but God has put it there he said he's been my God through life he guided me unto life he brought me into life he was the one that led me to life he is my life without him I have no life yeah come on without him I want nothing else he is My All In All and the hours of my trouble he stands by me yesterday he blessed me today he's going to bless me again tomorrow he's going to do the same forever praise His holy name he promised it he'd do it he is my life he is my God he is My All In All I've trusted him I've had some hard trials I trust him wherever I go I want you to do it if you go to Washington you women trust him if you go downtown trust him no matter where you're at trust him he's trustworthy amen man may have failed you but this God never will Nehemiah 9 and verse 12. shows us something about this guide this guide when he signs up he don't quit he won't ever give up on you oh my God Amen does that that do something to you when you know that God won't ever give up you might be lagging behind and you might be just kind of good but he ain't going to give up he's going to say come on come on there's another Hill to climb all right come on we're almost to where we're supposed to be come on let's go you know I I was one time riding the bicycle I had this stupid idea of riding bicycles [Music] amen well anyway brother Tim Winters we're gonna ride with him and my dad was making this lupus about a five mile Loop and it was no easy Loop you know we ain't got no mountains we've got some pretty good Hills ourselves down there where we live and it don't take much of a hill to make it a bad Hill on a bicycle I've been up that hill all my life in the car and it wasn't never a big deal but on a bicycle that's a different story and we'd make him several I mean months we was riding this thing you know and we remember the Tim one day was hoofing up this one this last Hill that turned into my drive or our road pretty big old Hill and it seemed like it lasts forever and you're you're puffing and you're puffing and you're determined I'm not getting off my bike and pushing I'm gonna make it all the way up this hill and you're pushing I looked over brother Tim I said you know brother Tim this is the last Hill home this is the last one we've been around a lot of Curves and hills and things I said but this is the last deal I know I've been this way before this is the last Hill and I said if we can just make it to this last Hill we'd make that last turn down there there's a house down there we can go sit on the couch and we can cool off and have a glass of ice too this is the last Hill and I said wouldn't it be something if we realized today is the last day how hard would we push how hard will we press when we thought man this is the last trial this is the last Mountain this is the last moment this is the last day there is going to be a last day we're coming to it very quick listen it's going to be a last year there's going to be a last month there's going to be a last week there's going to be a last day there's gonna be the last hour that's going to be a last minute there's going to be a last second and all of a sudden something will change and the dead in Christ arise and you'll look over there and you'll say well man that's what looks like that looks Mighty familiar yeah yeah ammo you may not recognize them right off you may not have seen your grandpa when he was a young man and all of a sudden you see this young man standing in your in your kitchen and you've been slaving you've been doing this and you woke up that morning and it didn't seem like it was the kind of morning for Rapture but it was the morning of the rapture and you woke up that morning but something was moving something was changing you knew something was up and just the baby started singing a song and all of a sudden you turned and this young man standing right there and he says brother Derek when I was on Earth I was your grandpa or I was this things are going to change very rapidly [Music] amen people say why what about faithful the Rapture let me tell you something when you see the dead in Christ standing yeah yeah it's going to be an explosion of Faith take place this is the moment listen when I see my mom walk through it's the moment this is the time I have went through my right last try I went through my last sickness I went through my last struggle I went through my last sickness I went through the last of Satan could ever do to me it's over with [Music] hallelujah hallelujah we are coming to the last Hill and the God knows exactly where home is he knows exactly where we're going he knows exactly how to get you there and he's not going to leave you behind or let you get lost but he's going to bring you all the way Jeep thank you Lord and He won't give up you said well I've done a lot of mistakes well let's hear about Nehemiah 9 and verse 12 moreover thou led us them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the Night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go how came us down upon the Mount Sinai and spake from Heaven gave us some right judgments and true laws and good statues and Commandments and made us known unto them thy holy Sabbath and commanders them precepts and statues of Law and gave them bread and brought forth water and promised that they'll go into the possessed the land which was swore unto them but they and their fathers dealt proudly and they hardened their necks and they hearken not to thy Commandments and they refuse to obey neither were mindful of thy Wonders that thou did US among them but Harden their necks and their Rebellion appointed a captain to return to bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon it was here about the nature of our God Thou Art God ready to Pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger of great kindness and thou forsook them not yea that made them they made themselves a molten character and said this is that God that brought thee out of Egypt yet in thou in thy manifold Mercy forsook them not in the wilderness and the pillar of cloud departed not from them by day and it led them in the way neither the pillar of Fire by night to show them the light in the way that they should go but thou led us them oh Hallelujah even in their faults you were with them even in their mistakes you didn't leave them even because why they were your children God don't give up I might give up on a lot of people in an elf my dad was said he said my my years of ministry I've given up on a lot of people he said but God didn't happen oh thank you Lord oh Hallelujah God didn't give up he kept moving he kept my touching he kept changing he kept moving this getting this person to this right place he's a god Psalms 119 05 says Thy word is a lamp into my feet and a light into my path proverbs 4 18 says the path of the justice as The Shining Light that shineth more and more unto perfect day so the God is not going to run out of light that's right oh thank you Lord you might get you a guide to take you hunting you get out somewhere lost and his batteries in his flashlight might run out but this light ain't gonna go out this light is going to shine to the last one gets home amen it doesn't matter how cold the darkness and how bad the darkness get how stormy it gets amen tries to bash and put out the light this light will shine until the last one gets home this light will shine Until the Last Ship is sailed and safely into the harbor this light will not be put out oh thank you Lord yeah The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness and they know not at what they stumble changing a little bit bringing it on down in the in Matthew Chapter 2 and verse 1 we're in the season of this he said now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the so there was a light so there was a light and Moses day seen a pillar of fire a bush that was on fire but did not burn here's another light it's not it's just one of the symbolisms of what was taking place because there was a light that stood there and spoke that come and out of that light step to man no doubt about six foot tall and Olive complexion spoke to Mary there was a light that's shown on the hill to Shepherds amen it was lights that were shining and you know brother talks about this and it's a wonderful sermon and especially to listen to in this time that we're in it's a great Shining Light he said as we this time of season as we focus our thinking towards Christmas he said it's too bad a lot of the myths that we've allowed in called Santa Claus instead of the real Christmas of what it's supposed to be he said many little children in the land today know nothing more about Christmas the slave full of toys and some Mystic reindeers pouncing on the house to only learn later of that it was nothing but a myth that will eventually hurt their faith he said but when it comes to know the true Christmas that had nothing to do with reindeers or a man smoking a pipe or a fur coat he said it was the birth of our Lord's blessed Lord Jesus and the most usual to see how God worked in this manner because no other time would have ever worked in all the history of the world but this time notice another thing that parallels in this time is taxation money becomes worthless in the first accident was you build bricks without straw made it harder on their labors and things amen the second it was taxation and it seemed like this is ridiculous that we have to go and we got to move from this area over to here in my wife's pregnant and she's heavy with child and I got a loader on a donkey and go through the Wilderness and and you know it could have had a lot of gripes what's God allowing this [Music] why is God allowing for certain people to be in power that we're living through his word listen another another thing that was that's a parallel is there was a pharaoh there was a king and now we got it again of people in power that don't know God right Pharaoh didn't know Moses amen Herod apparently didn't didn't believe in the in the king I mean he wanted to act like it but just enough to get close enough to kill him amen this is where we're at we're we're exactly parallel along the same lines it's coming and there's no other time in history would it work for a Rapture to take place in the time that we're living in great Darkness it'll be a lot of confusion people are caught up and you know things are taking place it's a time when Herod a murderer was a king it had to be this heartless man had to be king at that time there's brother Brown we're acquainted with the scriptures that said he slew all the children from two-year-old down trying to kill the Christ it had to be just at their time there had to be at that time a raise of Taxation that would cause Mary and Joseph to go back to their hometown of Bethlehem where they were registered and their birth was on record of the courts in the temple to be taxed that Christ had to be born in Bethlehem so it had to be now man thought Pharaoh thought I'm doing this Harry thought I'm doing this but God was doing this Biden I don't know what he thinks but he thinks maybe he's doing this or whoever behind him thinks they're doing is no God is doing this God is Raising Powers up God has allowed Russia to be what it is never before in history have man had the ability to burn the whole world come on maybe I guess maybe a Noah's day they might have had that kind of power but God didn't it wasn't time for that but here we are again and why because there's scriptures that says the Earth's going to burn with fire of course he's going to burn it with his fire too but it's going to be a fire of nuclear explosion this world is going to burn by the time of that I got this house and I it's all going to burn and we get so concerned about something that's gonna burn get so caught up in in building this and doing this and doing that I'm guilty of it we'll get so caught up in everyday life all of a sudden the news breaks and says this and we think why is it going to be going to be so stupid why why couldn't I couldn't steal him Trump but he should have got internet because God allowed it God allowed it to be so as American yeah it makes me angry to see what America's become but I know as a Christian and the message that we receive it has to be thus God has allowed it to be thus God had to bring her from a lamb to a dragon yeah it's in his word amen it started out as freedom of religion and his spoke as a lamb but it's going to speak as a dragon and you'll think man why are we going through what we're going God's allowed it yeah why am I going God's allowed it yeah it ain't easy to take may it probably wasn't easy for Joseph to load his nine months just about to pop pregnant woman on a donkey that's not a good idea it's barely a good idea to put her in a in a car during that time and get her down a bumpy road especially in Louisiana she'd love to have the baby on the way because of our our road system is terrible could you imagine as a husband in here saying we got to go to Bethlehem stupid Herod what a how is he I stupid Biden I can't believe Kamala God allowed it come on and we get so tore up about what God allowed come on and God's bringing it down to a certain place that a Rapture can take place that a birth can take place that a son can be welcomed and it seems so hard and it's a that's to tell you what this inflation if we'd had Trump we wouldn't be there and God allowed it and God brought it to this place I tell you what these gas prices wouldn't be this way maybe not but God allowed it [Music] so that his word could be fulfilled listen God is more concerned about his word being fulfilled than your pocketbook because he's already provided food and water before and if you need it again he'll provide it again he's the god thank you Lord and he puts him on a donkey it was a rough ride it wasn't in no Cadillac I don't know if anybody I I ain't never rode a donkey but horse is bad enough I couldn't imagine riding a donkey dumb stupid animal why am I on this donkey going down to Bethlehem this is so stupid I know I'm probably repeating a lot of conversations maybe a little different way why am I going through this so stupid God allowed it that his word can be fulfilled so he can bring his attributes to pass amen you're not in control God's in control it was a rough rugged Road the donkey would act up I can just imagine a sweat was pouring off of him and he's dragging his donkey I mean listen to donkey usually ain't real willing and and they you know dragging along and she's trying to keep her balance and holding her stomach like what in the world why am I he said but you know they got just on the outskirts just where they could kind of run around painting a picture he said they just got on the outskirts and they're looking over and they could see little lights of Bethlehem yeah yeah couldn't quite make it there that night he said because it wasn't good to travel at night because of robbers people that could murder them and kill them and take from them wouldn't he said there wasn't a whole lot of man could do just him and his wife and a donkey to keep the Predators and the robbers away from me it wasn't it didn't look like this made sense but there was a prophet that has spoke and said out of Bethlehem maybe oh yes so Herod said you know what he woke up one morning said I got a good idea I need some more money let's tax something you know what we're going to do we're going to get a census and we're going to make them go back to where they was born I have come up with a good idea greetings today Americans I have come up with something and this nonsense flows out of his mouth and you're looking like what I'll give you the money I just don't want to go to Bethlehem yeah but God said so I'm laboring this for a reason because we get so caught up in things that are going around us and God has allowed it God puts people in power he allows it to be that way because he's bringing it according to his word he said what if a wild beast would have took after that little party all Joseph had was a little stick in his hand and his wife could hardly move he said they had a lot to face he said but you know what that gives us a lot of consolation to know that we do not hold our destiny god holds our destiny he has ordained it to be so and there's nothing that'll ever interrupt the program of God we are bound to arrive Hallelujah it doesn't matter if inflation goes out the roof and you can't afford a hamburger we're bound to arise God's more interested in a Rapture than he is your daily bread and the things that you go through that are so concerning to us God is trying to get a people ready for a body change that's true yes so the world's an atmosphere because of Destruction and they're in the atmosphere for Destruction [Music] they had they it has to be because amen he said if God doesn't judge this generation he'll have to raise up Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize it's going to be judged he said looking at all these things he said to see this dark enveloping of time but God's hand is steadily moving on and nothing shall stop it he said I see today this little donkey two Travelers finally arrived and they come by night over the deserts they're setting just on a little mountain to the east of Bethlehem bethlehem's in a valley and there's a little mountain the road that comes in the Bethlehem curves east of Bethlehem goes down to the city near the corner I don't know if he actually ever been there but he knows what he's talking about Brother Brad has ever really showed I know when we was in Israel the guide there the brother that had been there Israel many times he said he never actually has found where brother Brown said yes I've been there I've looked forward too and I hadn't really found it yet either maybe you said it maybe he didn't but he sure described a lot of things about it you know brother brother Tim was talking about this he said one time he was listening to brother Branham in chronological order in the message and he said brother Brandon would have a discussion with his uh with his uh what's that what's the doctor there they've come up under I can't think of his name Dr Davis is that it anyway he's talking to him about and Dr Davis was adamant that John the Baptist baptized Jesus and Jesus baptized John the Baptist and he said brother man said no it didn't happen that way and Dad's like well how does he know it didn't happen that way and he goes next tape and he'd bring it up again and he said but it didn't happen that way he's ahead of me it didn't happen that way and he said well how does he know how does he know that it didn't happen what happened how does he know and when the next couple tapes down and he said it didn't happen that way he said the reason I know is because one day God set me there and I saw the whole thing it's kind of hard to argue with somebody who saw it amen so I don't know if he's actually there or just saw it but he describes it pretty good because I've been there and I went into Bethlehem Jagged rocks and things laying all around amen and so here they are he said I can see Joseph handling his wife real tender getting her off the donkey helps her to the ground deer with his little city we're just about there he said but I can see he said at that moment I see some stars that begin to twinkle a little brighter and he said looking up over Bethlehem to the east as they were there wondering as they gazed at the stars he said I can see him as they begin to line up and they begin to shine brighter and brighter and brighter and another place he said I see Joseph look at it and smiled a little bit oh yes he said but why was that light there he said because of thousands of miles over there was these Magis and brother let's go listen to this tape it's quite amazing he talks about he said there was some major eyes that were looking for that star he said why were they even looking how'd they even know to look he said because years before that the children of Israel were taken down there and he said Daniel begin to tell them and to reveal things to them and he said the very reason they were ready for the star was because a prophet was sent down to them and to think about that here they're thinking they're taking being taken down the bondage but why because God is there to fulfill his work he had to have some Magis down there ready to receive the word so when they saw the star they wouldn't just say well what is that and go about their business but they'll say there it is that's what we've been looking for yeah and they would load their camels and they would make a journey to go worship the king of kings because there had to be scriptures fulfilled so God's moving and doing it and it looks like all things are out of control look at what Israel done they're taking down the bondage but God's got a reason for it right so amazing when you see the what the the work of God and how he does things he said they watched diligently for it and he said if Christians would do the same thing not watch the stars but Watch God's word unfold him he said if we'd only notice it today and see how God is Promised in this day things we so gallantly stand for and God has promised to do him such as Healing The Sick and doing miracles he said if you notice God only reveals to those himself to those who search and long to see him draw an eye to me and I'll draw an eye to you saith the Lord sometimes sometimes God will let things happen so you will draw nigh to him oh yes he will he will yeah and them things ain't always easy amen they're hard yeah yeah one of the hardest trials I just had was with my mom passing away it wasn't easy very close to my mom I was her favorite preacher I'm proud of that my mom she supported me uh I went actually right after her passing and her funeral I was already scheduled to be up in Ohio at a youth meeting and I go out for my first service brother leaned over and said You Preach how your mama would want you to preach I said buddy that's dangerous because she she loved it she loved the word of God but God is guided he's used it yeah he's moved yes he never leaves you alone thank you Lord he never leaves you by yourself I don't care where you're at how dark it may seem how impossible it may be God is always there for you I'll just tell you the personal testimony of that as we bring this down I don't even know what my goodness I was at brother Ron Spencer's my mom was had been in and out of the hospital May a year ago was declining Decline and Decline and we we thought maybe our medicine got mixed up we didn't know what was happening but we didn't realize it was her on coming moments of passing and so she had been in the hospital didn't know what day it was didn't know where she was at thought she was at home and you said I went to see her one day and I'm supposed to be leaving in a few days to go brother Ron Spencer's for a meeting and then me and my wife was our 25th anniversary and was going to do a little bit and then go to brother Josh Bennett's for another meeting then come back home and I was talking with Dad about it what I do mom's in this situation he said Timothy we're at a Red Sea moment we're either back up or we speak and go forward he said I feel like you need to go I said well okay I'll go and so I come to see her in the hospital and she was not not herself she did she knew me she knew Dad she knew her birthday but she didn't know where she was at and I was just talking to her and she'd get all worked up and worried and I said just you know I'll start singing to her and as I start singing she just calmed down close your eyes raise her hands and it was Tuesday and I was leaving Thursday and they were wanting to do some kind of heart surgery or go in and explore something they thought those blood clots were coming from her heart and they they wanted to do something and I'm facing that and like man how am I going to leave and worried and you know I'm singing a song I think it was only believe just singing real softly and she looked at me and she said she didn't she didn't know what day it was she didn't know where she was at she said it's Tuesday she said hey are you preaching tomorrow I said yeah I am she said I'm coming to hear you four o'clock the next morning she got up and she was getting dressed dad's like what are you doing she ain't even dismissed from the hospital she said I'm going to go here Timothy preach he's preaching today he's like honey it's four o'clock in the morning go back to bed you ain't even been dismissed from the hospital you know I'm trying to reason with her finally gets her back in bed and by that afternoon she's dismissed they come straight to church and she comes to church next morning I get our that night I preached the next morning I'd get up me and sister Ruth to fly out the doctor called that that evening and said look we need her back at the hospital we actually found something that we need to do in her heart to check things out so I'm flying out she's going back to the hospital and I'm worried and tore up about it and I fly up to brother Ron's and go go up there and we spend a few days with him and Saturday night service Sunday morning service I'm preaching on a God who answers and I was speaking about the children of Israel and brother Brown talks about he said God always answers he said many times it's in an unexpected Place unexpected time an unexpected way he said but he always answers you just got to recognize this God and so I'm going along that way along that lines and I come down to the children of the three Hebrew children in the fire and I walk away and the brother Ron's got a little round spot of his platform that goes out and I walk out there and and I'm standing there talking for a while and preaching on the three Hebrew children in the fire and and my iPad had actually shut off and and it's black and and I I ain't paying no attention to it no more and I'm telling about that and I I said You know here they are there in this situation and they're they're down and down about to go in this fire I said but God never left them God was watching over them he was he was actually guiding Amen in that moment and that time it seemed like chaos was about to take place but God was watching brother Brown talks about this angel came and that angel came and he said but God said no he'd been good angels He said but this is a job for me and he said he grabbed the East Wind Called for the East Wind the West Wind and grabbed a zigzag of lighting and down in that fire he went and just as that they stepped in there there was the Fourth Man do you know you got to go through a fire to produce the fourth man yes you go through some hard trials it's only to bring God to you [Music] and here they are and I said you know and that King he stopped and he's like well didn't I put three and now there's four and just as I said that I Heard a Voice begin to speak uh what in the world and I'm looking around trying to figure out where it come from and brother Ron sitting behind over there and another brother that plays the bass they had seen my iPad flash open they've seen it turn off my notes move over to the table or the uh or the tapes are and it's seen his flash through the tapes push the tape and push a spot to play and my iPad began to play and brother branham's voice begins to speak and he said I always loved that song he spent it especially in the time and day that we're living in he said they were he said he talks about Cleburne and they're the one that wrote it and I didn't catch it at the moment I didn't realize what song it was but but he said but he said that song speaks to me he said because it expresses the extreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ especially in the day that we're living in he said they want to just make him a man but he was more than a man he was God and that voice spoke and uh and then God answered now I went back and I realized he was speaking about down from his glory here I'm speaking about he came down into the fire and the voice begins to speak about a song down from his glory I thought my mama was healed I thought it was over with God had spoke God had answered he's in the fire he's walking with me and just a few weeks later she would go down and she would continue down that spiral until we put her in a cold dark grave but God spoke to me right after that and he said you know what I didn't send that for you Mama I sent that for you I wanted you to know you was about to go through a fire but I wasn't Gonna Leave You but I was going to be with you and I was going to guide you and I was going to be with you every step of the way and I'm here to testify this God has not left me I may have been through a fire I may have been through a trial but he's walked with me every step of the way and I want you to know he's still a God for you he'll guide you through a fire he'll guide you through a storm he'll guide you he knows exactly he's such a God he knows where your children are at on he knows how to bring him back he knows exactly how to touch him how to touch their hearts and amend them in such a way that he'll rewrite all wrongs and change your heart and bring him back to the house of God I've seen him do it before and he's done It Before He'll Do It Again he knows exactly how to move he knows exactly how to orchestrate he knows exactly what he's doing you probably heard it but it's good to tell it again our bass player brother Justin Ware was a young man who's raised in the church went out and got into college scene and the drugs and things and rock bands and this that and the other got away from God that Wednesday my dad that he actually was actually the first it was actually the time of my mom's first blame brain bleed and he and he said he said this week

with them Upon A promise I would hold on to it I don't care how dark it gets thank you Jesus thank you Lord he's a god he'll lead he's the Eternal Light he knows exactly the path amen I'm going to read a couple last things and we're going to bring it right on down right here this I got to bring this last part of you you ought to go listen to this tape it's incredible he said what are we today we are stars yeah he said every born-again Christian is a testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ a star to reflect the power and Holiness of the Lord Jesus to reflect him in his life to perfect to perfect him in his speech to perfect him and he in his healing power to perfect him in his resurrection Amen to reflect him in every way that he was reflected To Us by God the Father We Are Stars what kind of star should you be this star was not Guided by its own power it was Guided by the celestial powers of almighty God and if we're ever going to reflect Sinners to Christ we've got to be guided by the holy spirit amen we cannot be an ordinary people we have to be an unusual people we cannot be usual because God's people are peculiar people they've been down through all the ages although peculiar yet the star was brilliant not brilliant in the world's education not brilliant in the world's Affair but brilliant as sacrifice is before the Lord we prostate ourselves as the magias did in the presence of the king of kings to reflect his life yes sir you are a star every Christian is a star to guide the laws to guide the weary the foot of the traveler to those who are seeking then the star cannot be guided by itself it must be led by the spirit it must reflect the bridency of God in his life to abstain from the things of the world to live Godly and soberly it must reflect the light of a great one who shine what are we to do then to Rise and Shine the Light Of God to the Dying World in depths of Darkness of this world we were to reflect and Shine the presence of the Lord Jesus in his resurrecting power he is just as he was yesterday so he is today and we are to reflect him but remember when the start then the star again when it finished its course it takes no honor the star just brought men to their destination and to show them that perfect life and we as members of the body of Christ this morning we are God's lights and we but we take no honor to ourselves all honor belongs to him [Music] he says as they were reading talking about the wise men and the sacred fire was burning they were worshiping the one true God by sacred fire they watched the licking of the blazes for they knew that the one true God dwelt in light Hallelujah yes that's true God dwells in life when he was on Earth He manifested In the Flesh he said I am the light of the world because God was manifested through him and he was the light the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel he was the light that struck Paul down on the road to Damascus he was the light that came to pray to the prison and Peter to Peter he was the light that's been in our that picture that hangs under he's the light that's in my heart he's the light that's in their Church he's the Everlasting in life and in
