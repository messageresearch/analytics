[9:14] Once Upon a Mountaintop near Jerusalem
[9:17] three little trees stood and dreamed of
[9:19] what they wanted to become when they
[9:21] grew up I went to hold treasure I want
[9:24] to be covered with gold and filled with
[9:26] precious stones I've always dreamed
[9:29] about that that I'll be the most
[9:30] beautiful treasure chest in the whole
[9:32] world the second little tree looked out
[9:34] at a small stream trickling by on its
[9:37] way to the
[9:38] sea I love the water when I grow up I
[9:41] want to be a huge ship traveling Mighty
[9:44] oceans and carrying powerful Kings I'll
[9:46] be the biggest and strongest ship in the
[9:48] world the third little tree looked down
[9:50] into the valley below where busy men and
[9:53] women worked when I grow up I want to
[9:56] grow so tall that when people stop to
[9:58] look at me rise their eyes to heaven and
[10:00] think of God I will be the tallest tree
[10:03] in the world years passed the rain came
[10:06] the sun Shone and the little trees grew
[10:08] tall one day three wood cutters climbed
[10:12] the
[10:16] [Music]
[10:19] mountain come on guys let's cut some
[10:21] wood hey h time frame dude those AR
[10:25] invented yet
[10:27] [Music]
[10:30] this tree is this tree is beautiful it
[10:31] is perfect for what I'm going to do with
[10:34] it with a swoop of his axe the first
[10:38] tree falls this is wonderful now I shall
[10:41] be made into a beautiful glittering box
[10:44] I will hold wonderful treasure the
[10:46] second wood cutter looked at the second
[10:48] tree and
[10:52] said wow this tree is perfect it's
[10:57] perfect for my building project
[10:59] just the kind of wood I need with a
[11:02] swoop of his
[11:04] axe the second tree
[11:08] falls the third tree felt her heart sink
[11:11] when the last wood cutter looked her way
[11:14] she stood straight and tall and pointed
[11:16] bravely to heaven and your tree would do
[11:19] for me with a swoop of his
[11:23] axe the third tree falls
[11:30] the first tree rejoiced when the wood
[11:32] cutter brought her to a carpenter shop
[11:35] but things did not happen how she had
[11:36] hoped the busy Carpenter was not
[11:39] thinking about treasure
[11:49] chests Shalom I'm in need of a carpenter

[11:56] plans for this wood I wasn't expecting

[13:34] [Music]
[13:35] going the once beautiful tree was not
[13:38] covered with glittering gold nor was she
[13:40] filled with riches diamonds and rubies
[13:43] she was just coated with saw dust and
[13:45] filled with hay for Hungry animals
[13:54] [Music]
[14:06] [Music]
[14:28] his name is Jesus it means savior he
[14:31] will be the Lord of our Salvation I will
[14:33] never forget when the angel revealed
[14:35] this to me on that night golden
[14:37] Starlight poured over the first tree as
[14:39] Mary placed her newborn baby in the
[14:41] manger and suddenly the first tree knew
[14:44] she was holding the greatest treasure in
[14:46] the world
[14:54] [Music]
[15:01] if I were
[15:04] there on that Silent
[15:07] Night would I hear Angels Sing Praises
[15:13] in the
[15:15] sky if I were
[15:18] there would I go with
[15:22] haste with humble Shepherds to seek his
[15:27] holy place
[15:30] if I were
[15:33] there i' find the
[15:37] manger and bow
[15:40] before the tiny
[15:44] savior I sense the
[15:47] peace that filled the
[15:51] air if I were
[15:55] there if I were there
[16:03] if I were
[16:05] there on the silent
[16:08] [Music]

[16:31] king if I were
[16:34] there I find a
[16:38] manger and bow
[16:41] before the tiny
[16:45] savior I sense the
[16:48] peace that filled the
[16:52] air if I were
[16:56] there if I were there

[17:06] know that precious baby who came so long
[17:14] ago was Jesus

[17:21] Earth I sing his Praises as I Cate his
[17:27] birth

[17:46] peace that fill the
[17:49] air if I were
[17:53] there if I were there
[17:59] [Music]
[18:09] the second tree smiled when the wood
[18:10] cutter took her to a shipyard but no
[18:13] Mighty sailing ship was made that day
[18:15] instead the one strong tree was hammered
[18:17] and sawed into a simple fishing boat she
[18:20] was too small and too weak to sail on an
[18:23] ocean or even a river instead she was
[18:26] taken to a small Sea called Galilee
[18:39] [Music]
[18:48] e what we
[18:52] need we need

[20:08] to be sick the waves are getting
[20:12] higher you'll be fine keep
[20:15] rowing the thundering and thrashing
[20:18] storm got worse the little tree
[20:20] shuddered she knew she did not have the
[20:22] strength to carry so many passengers
[20:24] safely through the wind and the waves
[20:27] and the rain
[20:30] this is getting
[20:34] serious shall I wait
[20:38] Jesus shall I wait
[20:44] Jesus Jesus will help us then Jesus
[20:48] awakened he stood up stretched out his
[20:51] hand and said peace be
[20:53] still the storm stopped as quickly as it
[20:56] had begun and suddenly the second tree
[20:59] knew she was carrying the king of heaven
[21:02] and of

[23:24] Peace the third tree was confused when
[23:26] the wood cutter cut her strong beams and
[23:29] left her in a
[23:41] Heap what happened all I ever wanted was
[23:44] to St stay on mountain top and point to
[23:46] God
[23:57] [Music]
[24:09] I have orders to you from
[24:11] Rome but now I have my un Rock to do

[24:39] one Friday morning the third tree was
[24:42] startled when her beams were yanked from
[24:44] the Forgotten wood pile she flinched as
[24:46] she was carried through an Angry jeering
[24:49] Crowd she shuddered when soldiers nailed
[24:52] a man's hands to her she felt ugly and
[24:56] harsh and cruel but on Sunday morning
[24:59] when the sun rose and the Earth trembled
[25:01] with joy beneath her the third tree knew
[25:04] that God's love had changed
[25:15] everything and every time people thought
[25:18] of the third tree they would think of
[25:20] God and his perfect love gift to mankind
[25:23] that was better than being the tallest
[25:25] tree in the world
