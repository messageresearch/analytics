[31:29] [music] And know
[31:33] the joy of knowing [singing and music]
[31:37] with heart
[31:39] knowing
[31:41] someday [singing]
[31:42] I'm going
[31:45] to [music] my home. [singing]
[31:49] My home in glory.
[31:53] I'm going to walk on streets paid
[31:58] with [singing] gold. [music]
[32:02] Well, I [music] was on the mountain. I
[32:06] was wandering [singing] from the
[32:09] fountain [music]
[32:11] when I heard my Savior speak to me.
[32:15] [music and singing]
[32:17] Well, he said, "Come to me, riding
[32:23] of your [music and singing] sins,
[32:25] repenting,
[32:27] and I will lead you out where you
[32:30] [music and singing]
[32:31] can see,
[32:34] singing, I'm
[32:37] so glad,
[32:39] [music] so glad he [singing] found me.
[32:42] Love he found me.
[32:45] He put his arms all around
[32:47] [singing and music]
[32:48] me.
[32:50] Oh, then he led me. Yes, he
[32:52] [music and singing] did. To the shelter.
[32:58] And now [music and singing] I'm one.
[33:01] Oh, his own.
[33:07] And know
[33:09] [singing] the [music] joy,
[33:12] the joy of knowing with the hearts of
[33:15] glowing. [music]
[33:18] Someday I'm [singing] going
[33:22] to [music] my home,
[33:26] my home in glory. [music]
[33:30] I'm going to walk on streets paid
[33:34] with gold.
[33:37] I [music] like this one. Well, I will
[33:40] love him ever. I will stray
[33:43] [music and singing] from him. No, never.
[33:47] For he's the dearest friend I ever knew.
[33:51] [singing]
[33:54] Oh, and when I [music] see him launder,
[33:59] my love will still [music] grow
[34:01] [singing] fonder
[34:03] in that happy land beyond [singing]
[34:07] the blue. Let me hear you sing it now.
[34:11] Well, I'm
[34:14] so glad,
[34:16] so glad [music]
[34:18] you
[34:19] found me.
[34:22] He put his arms all around
[34:23] [music and singing] me
[34:27] and he led me [music]
[34:30] to [singing] the shelter.
[34:34] And now I
[34:37] one [music] of his own
[34:42] will
[34:44] [singing]
[34:46] the joy of knowing
[34:50] with hearts [music] are glowing.
[34:54] Someday I'm going
[34:58] to my home. [music]
[35:02] My home in glory.
[35:05] We're going to walk on
[35:07] [music and singing] streets paid.
[35:10] We go.
[35:13] [music and singing] Somebody give the
[35:14] Lord a hand clap of praise tonight.
[35:16] [applause] Amen. It won't be long.
[35:21] This song has more than one meeting. It
[35:22] doesn't mean we're going to be out of
[35:23] here quick
[35:25] necessarily, although we need to be not.
[35:28] Amen. But we're looking forward to what
[35:29] the Lord has for [music] us tonight.
[35:31] Amen. Brother Josh Kathy, they're from
[35:33] Arizona. He's got family here, his mom,
[35:35] his dad. Good to have you all with us
[35:36] tonight. Amen. We [music] sure love
[35:38] Brother Josh. He's a he's a good friend.
[35:40] And of course, you know, we got a lot to
[35:42] follow up after preaching behind Brother
[35:44] [music] Josh Martin this morning. But uh
[35:46] but but I I know that the Lord will use
[35:48] him. He's he's just a young minister.
[35:50] Hadn't been preaching that long, but he
[35:52] every time we've had him, we've enjoyed
[35:53] him, and he's always [music] said
[35:55] something that would help the church.
[35:56] So, uh we're we're glad to have him
[35:58] back. and uh just pull on the gift of
[36:01] God. Like I told you this morning, it
[36:02] ain't going to hurt nobody to say amen.
[36:05] Nobody at all. You know, we [music] we
[36:06] we put a lot on the preacher. Amen. But
[36:09] let's just open our hearts and receive.
[36:11] You know, we can we can uh we can we can
[36:14] come to criticize or we can come to pull
[36:15] on the gift of God. And I say it's a lot
[36:17] easier, you know, when you're having fun
[36:19] in church. And there's no reason not to.
[36:22] So, as brother Josh comes, it [music]
[36:23] won't be long then we'll be leaving
[36:25] here. Amen. I believe that we're getting
[36:27] to the time where we can sing this song
[36:29] and know what we're talking about. You
[36:31] can see all around us things are
[36:33] happening and uh you know, you can look
[36:35] at the signs of the time and and [music]
[36:37] the world is is going insane. And I'll
[36:39] say this, it's a fearful time for the
[36:41] world. But this is a good time for the
[36:42] bride because when you see promises
[36:44] being fulfilled, lift up your lift up
[36:46] your heads because redemption drawth
[36:48] nigh. Amen. If you're ready to go, I
[36:50] think it's a it's a time that ought to
[36:52] be exciting for us. Amen. to know that
[36:53] what we know we have the greatest
[36:55] [music] message that ever hit the face
[36:56] of the earth and it's getting us ready
[36:58] for a rapture. Amen. By whatever methods
[37:01] you know God could God used God used a
[37:02] donkey one time and he uses men and he
[37:06] uses every every kind of you know
[37:07] there's there's there's fast preachers,
[37:09] slow [music] preachers, teachers, all
[37:11] kinds. But you know God wanted all of
[37:13] them. He said all of them in the church.
[37:14] And so you know we can sit here and say
[37:16] this one preaches better and this one
[37:17] preaches less. [music]
[37:18] You know, we can we can sit here and do
[37:20] all that human thinking all we want to,
[37:22] but I'm telling you here tonight, God
[37:24] can use anybody. And I believe he's
[37:27] going to use our brother here tonight.
[37:29] Amen. Do you believe it? Are you going
[37:30] to pull on the gift of God? Amen. As he
[37:32] comes, let's sing this with all of our
[37:34] hearts. Oh, it won't be.
[37:38] No, it won't [singing]
[37:40] be long.
[37:42] Then we'll be leaving.
[37:46] Oh, yes, we will.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing]
[37:49] it won't
[37:51] it won't be long.
[37:55] Oh, [singing] we'll be going. Sing. It
[37:59] won't be long again.
[38:02] Oh, [singing]
[38:03] it won't.
[38:06] No, it won't [singing]
[38:08] be long.
[38:10] Then we'll be leaving. [music]
[38:14] Leaving here.
[38:17] Oh, it won't [music] be long.
[38:22] We'll be going home. Aren't you looking
[38:23] forward to it? We'll be going.
[38:25] [music and singing]
[38:27] Yes, we will. With all your hearts now.
[38:30] Oh, [singing] so count the years [music]
[38:33] as much.
[38:37] Oh, [music and singing] and count the
[38:39] months as weeks
[38:43] [music]
[38:45] and count the weeks [singing]
[38:47] as days any [music] day now.
[38:51] Oh, [singing]
[38:52] we'll be going. Count the years again
[38:56] with all your hearts. Oh, so [music]
[38:59] count the years as much.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; [music]

[39:12] [music]
[39:12] Oh, and [singing] count the weeks as
[39:15] days. Any day now.
[39:19] Oh, [singing]
[39:20] we'll [music] be going one more time. It
[39:23] won't be long.
[39:26] Oh, it won't [music and singing]
[39:29] be long.
[39:32] Heat.
[39:42] Heat.
[39:51] [music]
[40:08] Oh, and count the winds and stay. Any
[40:13] day [music] now,
[40:17] we'll be [singing] going.
[40:24] God bless you this evening.
[40:31] Amen. God bless you this evening. It's
[40:33] good to be here with you.
[40:35] And the only thing I could uh catch from
[40:37] what brother Joel was saying when I was
[40:40] in the back was that he compared me to a
[40:42] donkey. So [laughter]
[40:44] So good. Good. Perfect. That's just what
[40:47] a preacher wants to hear when he's about
[40:49] to come to the come to the pull pit.
[40:52] Amen. Well, we're happy to be here. It's
[40:54] always always has a very home feel to
[40:56] it. Um you you guys receive me and my
[41:00] family when we come every time and I
[41:01] just really appreciate it and it it
[41:03] means a lot and I just thank you for it.
[41:05] And I'm this evening I just have a short
[41:08] simple thought on my heart. I'm I'm not
[41:10] near the preacher that that Josh M is,
[41:12] but we'll see what the Lord will do. see
[41:14] if he can
[41:16] work through a different vessel as well.
[41:18] And if we could, while we're standing,
[41:20] turn over to Matthew 27:24,
[41:32] Matthew 27:24. And as brother Josh, he
[41:36] was he was speaking this morning, he was
[41:38] speaking about a quote where brother
[41:39] Brandham says, very familiar quote. He
[41:41] says, "God doesn't send judgment without
[41:43] warning.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; God will not send judgment upon the
[41:47] people without warning." And I'm so
[41:49] thankful for that that we serve a a fair
[41:52] God, a God that'll ju just imagine
[41:54] starting at a job, starting a new job
[41:57] somewhere, working something different.
[41:58] And you have a boss and he just says,
[42:00] "Well, just just start going to work.
[42:01] Start going to work." Then you start
[42:03] working and you don't exactly know what
[42:05] you're supposed to be doing. You don't
[42:06] know how to do it. You don't know in
[42:08] what fashion to do it. And that wouldn't
[42:10] be very fair of that boss. But I'm so
[42:12] thankful that we have one that's given
[42:14] us a code of conduct. He's given us
[42:16] instruction. He's he's he's told us what
[42:19] our benefits package is.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; He's told us what we have access to as
[42:24] workers for the gospel.
[42:27] In Matthew 27:24,
[42:30] if we could just bow our heads before we
[42:32] read it. Heavenly Father,
[42:34] Lord, we count this a privilege. And
[42:36] Father, we thank you for this this
[42:38] opportunity to come before you and
[42:40] worship your name and speak on your
[42:43] word, Lord. If we just if we read a
[42:44] verse and we closed it, Lord, that would
[42:46] be enough reading your your everlasting
[42:49] word, Father. And we just ask that you
[42:50] would continue with us. And Lord, that
[42:53] you would get me out of the way, Father.
[42:54] That you would speak through this
[42:56] vessel, Lord. that if I were to say
[42:58] anything that you wouldn't have me to
[43:00] say, Father, that you would stop me. And
[43:02] Lord, just anoint each one. Anoint ears
[43:05] to hear, eyes to see. And Father, we
[43:07] just ask that you would continue with us
[43:08] this evening in Jesus Christ's name.
[43:11] Amen. Amen. In Matthew 27:24,
[43:15] it says, "When Pilate saw that he could
[43:17] prevail nothing, but rather atonement
[43:20] was made, he took water and washed his
[43:23] hands before the multitude, saying, I am
[43:26] innocent of the blood of this just
[43:28] person." He said, "See ye to it." Amen.
[43:32] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[43:33] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[43:37] And so Pilate here, Pilate, he he the
[43:40] the message of Pilate's hour had just
[43:43] presented itself to him. It was standing
[43:45] right in front of him. Christ in every
[43:47] age, when when you break it down, when
[43:50] when you take out all the extra stuff
[43:51] that people want to put onto the
[43:53] message, Christ and the revelation of
[43:55] Jesus Christ, that is the message of
[43:58] every hour there's ever been, of any age
[44:00] there's ever been. When you go Old
[44:02] Testament, when you take it back there,
[44:04] angel of the covenant, and there was a
[44:06] messenger of the covenant in Moses, you
[44:09] bring it to the new, you have John, a
[44:11] messenger of the covenant. And I believe
[44:13] that we've received another messenger of
[44:15] the covenant in this day as John
[44:17] introduced Christ the first time.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; The church now, the the bride of Jesus
[44:22] Christ needed a reintroduction to Jesus
[44:25] Christ. It needed all the loose ends.
[44:28] Everything that had been scrupled up,
[44:29] tied back up and reintroduced to the
[44:32] bride of Jesus Christ. And I believe
[44:34] that's came in this hour today.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; I believe that's what we have.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; And so Pilate here, he he's faced with
[44:41] the message of his hour. And the truth
[44:44] is right in front of him. And Pilate is
[44:46] responsible.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; He has a responsibility. And that's the
[44:49] title of the message tonight. The
[44:51] responsibility of the message. what what
[44:54] you're holding in your hand. We are
[44:57] responsible for so much because so much
[45:00] has been revealed. Where there's
[45:01] revelation, there's responsibility.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; When when the Lord shows somebody
[45:06] something, shows a people something and
[45:08] reveals a message. When Christ is he,
[45:11] brother Brandham talks about Pilate
[45:14] could not wash it off his hands. He he
[45:16] could have washed and washed and washed
[45:17] and he could not wash Jesus off his
[45:19] hands. And we are in that same place.
[45:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ. We've
[45:25] had it. We've had the fullness, the full
[45:28] revelation
[45:29] &gt;&gt; today.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; And we cannot wash it off.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; We cannot get it off of our hands. He is
[45:35] on our hands. And what will we do with
[45:37] him?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; When you think about it, you know, many
[45:39] times we say the Jews, they crucified
[45:41] and the the Roman government, they did
[45:43] it.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham tells us it was us
[45:46] that pierced him.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; It was our sins that pierced him. It was
[45:50] nobody but our sins. That's what he died
[45:53] for on that cross. And we cannot forget
[45:55] that.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; If we could turn over to Joshua 8:es 33
[46:01] and 35.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; And the question this evening is, what
[46:07] are we going to do with him?
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Are we going to leave him hanging on
[46:10] that cross?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Are we going to leave him right there?
[46:13] Leave him a god of history. Leave him a
[46:15] god of the past. Or are we going to
[46:17] bring him here? Are we going to bring
[46:19] him on a scene with our worship, with
[46:20] our praise, with an offering to him?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; We're responsible of these things.
[46:28] Joshua 8:es 33 and 35.
[46:35] I didn't start my timer up here. Joel's
[46:37] going to be mad at me. He gave me about
[46:39] 20 27 and a half minutes. So, we'll see
[46:43] if we can finish in that time.
[46:46] It says, ' And all Israel and their
[46:48] elders and the officers, and this is
[46:49] Israel, they are in the promised land
[46:51] here. And all Israel and their elders
[46:53] and the officers and their judges stood
[46:55] on this side the ark and on that side
[46:57] before the priests, the Levites, which
[46:59] bear the ark of the covenant of the
[47:01] Lord, as well the stranger, and he that
[47:03] was born among them. Half of them over
[47:05] against Mount Gerism, and half of them
[47:07] over against Mount Ebal, as Moses, a
[47:11] servant of the Lord, had commanded
[47:12] before, that they should bless the
[47:14] people of Israel. And afterward, he read
[47:17] all the words of the law, the blessings
[47:20] and the cursings. He didn't leave
[47:22] nothing out.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't pick and choose what he wanted
[47:25] to read. He he didn't sift through it
[47:27] and only read what he understood and
[47:29] what he didn't understand. But he read
[47:32] all the blessings, all the cursings. He
[47:34] you could say he took the fullness of
[47:36] the word that he had right then and he
[47:38] lived by it. He read that word.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Says according to all that is written in
[47:43] the book of the law. He said, "There was
[47:45] not there was not a word of all that
[47:47] Moses commanded, which Joshua read not
[47:50] before all the congregation of Israel,
[47:52] with the women and the little ones and
[47:55] the strangers that were conversant among
[47:57] them." What was it? What was Joshua
[47:59] doing here? He had a responsibility
[48:01] because of the message that he had
[48:03] heard. He knew that it was his
[48:05] responsibility to get that message out.
[48:08] It's our responsibility today to get
[48:11] that message out. And I I I recently I
[48:14] was at a at a ministers meeting and one
[48:16] of the topics was as a young preacher,
[48:18] how do you know if you're called to
[48:20] preach? And and the brother got up and
[48:22] he was speaking on it and he was uh he
[48:24] was talking about the question and he
[48:26] got into, you know, we should be backing
[48:28] young preachers. And I guess that's good
[48:29] for me to say standing up here, but but
[48:32] he got on that topic and that we should
[48:34] be pushing them and because brother
[48:35] Brandham said, if you have a call in
[48:37] your life to preach, then preach. Get in
[48:39] a pullpit somewhere and start preaching
[48:41] the word. He said, "We need good
[48:43] preachers."
[48:44] &gt;&gt; It's what the prophet told us. And so,
[48:46] as the brother was going on and saying,
[48:48] "We we need to back preachers. We need
[48:50] to we need to help them out as much as
[48:52] we can. Not be so critical, not sit sit
[48:54] in a seat of the scornful, get give him
[48:57] an opportunity, give him a chance." And
[48:59] another brother got up with a different
[49:01] mindset. He said, "I believe that all
[49:03] that is predestinated." He said, "I
[49:05] believe that the Lord will take care of
[49:07] it. It's predestinated. It it's it it's
[49:09] all fine. But we are his hands and his
[49:12] feet. That's such a lazy way of thinking
[49:14] about things. We can't just point back
[49:17] to it's it's predestinated. But God
[49:19] needs some boots on the ground. He needs
[49:21] people that will go spread his word. He
[49:24] needs people that'll take it no matter
[49:25] if if you're scared to. I guarantee you
[49:28] that Joshua and Caleb were not ashamed
[49:30] to say that they believe the message of
[49:32] the hour.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; I guarantee you when somebody said,
[49:35] "Where do you go to church? What do you
[49:37] believe?" They didn't say, "Oh, some
[49:39] kind of knockoff Pentecostal church,
[49:41] something like that." No, they said, "I
[49:43] believe Moses's message. I believe a
[49:46] message has came to free us out of
[49:48] bondage.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; He needs boots on the ground." He needs
[49:53] people that are willing to go and tell.
[49:56] That's a commission. Go ye and tell.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Tell somebody about it.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; We can't be ashamed of it. It's our
[50:02] life. It's our absolute. It's everything
[50:04] to us.
[50:06] We wouldn't know how to do anything
[50:07] without it. We wouldn't know the the
[50:10] right Jesus without it.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Many churches out there, they don't even
[50:14] know the Jesus that they're talking
[50:16] about. They don't know how to baptize.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; They don't know anything about the
[50:19] serpent seed. They don't know the true
[50:21] message of grace.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; They don't have this know there where
[50:25] where that knowledge is, there's
[50:26] responsibility that comes with it. We're
[50:29] we're we were not we were not put here
[50:32] to sit in a tall tower and look out at
[50:34] everybody else that's lower than us
[50:37] &gt;&gt; and point and say what they're doing
[50:39] wrong
[50:41] &gt;&gt; and what they don't know.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; But we were called to go out and bring
[50:45] them into that very same tower.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Go out and tell them about what we know.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Tell them the good news. That's what the
[50:52] gospel means. The gospel is the good
[50:55] news.
[50:59] and we have a responsibility to one
[51:01] another as well.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; You know, many times when things come up
[51:04] in life, I've noticed this about myself
[51:06] in the past. I'll tell on myself when
[51:08] when life gets hard, when things come up
[51:10] in my life, what some of the first
[51:13] responsibilities that I sherk away from
[51:15] are my church responsibilities.
[51:17] Attendance drops. I think, well, I'm
[51:20] tired today. It'll be easier to stay at
[51:21] home. What's one service? What's it
[51:24] matter if I miss one service?
[51:26] But that one service turn turns into two
[51:28] services. When you set that standard
[51:30] with yourself,
[51:31] &gt;&gt; when that becomes your your precedent
[51:33] right there, one service turns into two
[51:35] and then you miss three or four that
[51:37] month and then and then pretty soon
[51:39] you're out of church. We've seen it.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; We've seen it happen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; But I just pray don't let me be a heady
[51:46] high-minded believer.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Don't don't let me be a believer that's
[51:50] that's so far above everybody that I
[51:52] think that nobody can tell me anything.
[51:54] I can't take any correction, you know.
[51:56] Let's turn over to Psalm 23 real quick.
[51:59] Just came to my mind.
[52:07] You know, there's actually by by the
[52:08] Bible standard, there's comfort in
[52:10] correction.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; And Psalm 23, when you read it, it's the
[52:16] it's the relationship between the the
[52:18] shepherd and the sheep. That's what it's
[52:20] telling you about. That's what it's
[52:22] describing here. It says, "The Lord is
[52:23] my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh
[52:25] me to lie down in green pastures. He
[52:27] leadth me beside the still waters. He
[52:29] restoreth my soul. He leadth me in the
[52:31] paths of righteousness for his name's
[52:34] sake. Yay, though I walk through the
[52:36] valley of the shadow of death, I will
[52:38] fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy
[52:41] rod and thy staff, they comfort me."
[52:44] Now, if you if if you know anything
[52:46] about her sheep, that rod and that
[52:48] staff, that rod can be used to fend off
[52:52] any predators that are after the sheep.
[52:54] But that same rod that will fend off a
[52:56] predator is the same rod that'll hit
[52:58] that sheep over the head when it starts
[53:00] getting out of line.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; It's the very same rod and that same
[53:03] staff that can be used to poke things
[53:06] away from the sheep, that can shield it,
[53:08] that can guide it. It's the same staff
[53:10] that'll jerk that sheep back if it gets
[53:12] out of line.
[53:13] We have to be comfortable in correction.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; We have to be comfortable with the word
[53:18] correcting things in our life. If we if
[53:20] if we get to a point where we're
[53:22] uncomfortable with that, we how can we
[53:24] take headship?
[53:26] &gt;&gt; If we want to talk about a I'm not big
[53:27] on talking about problems in the message
[53:30] or problems in churches or anything like
[53:32] that, but if there is a spirit out in
[53:35] the land today, it's a spirit against
[53:37] headship.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; People don't want headship.
[53:41] PE people don't they they don't want it
[53:43] from the prophet.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; They don't and if if you don't take it
[53:47] from the Lord and it passes down through
[53:49] your home and the man of the house if
[53:51] Jesus Christ is not his head then what
[53:54] kind of head is he going to be in the
[53:55] home?
[53:56] &gt;&gt; What kind of house home life are we
[53:58] talking about there?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; It's dangerous stuff.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; But here in this scripture Joshua
[54:08] he had some leadership responsibilities.
[54:10] You see in the scripture who it was
[54:12] talking about that was all around him.
[54:14] It says with the women and the little
[54:16] ones and the strangers that were
[54:18] conversant among them. Now this just
[54:20] wasn't a bunch of born again believers.
[54:22] It wasn't a bunch of just just clean
[54:24] people that were among them. It says
[54:26] twice there that the stranger was among
[54:28] them.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; P people that probably didn't look that
[54:31] great. People that probably didn't have
[54:33] a buttonup on.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; People that wasn't wearing a tie that
[54:36] day.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Maybe they were a little bit dirty.
[54:39] Those people were among him, too. And he
[54:42] still preached the message to them.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; He still pushed the message to them. He
[54:47] didn't hold back. He didn't say, "Well,
[54:48] I'm going to try and pick and choose and
[54:50] see what they can understand and what
[54:52] they can't." People have heard the tape
[54:54] marriage and divorce and came in and
[54:56] people have heard a simple tape like
[54:58] expectations and they've came in. It is
[55:01] not our place to pick and that's God's
[55:03] job to pick and choose how he brings his
[55:05] sheep into the fold. It is not our job
[55:08] to pick and choose what they can handle
[55:09] and what they cannot handle.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; But Joshua is talking to to many
[55:15] different classes of people here.
[55:17] Sometimes I think we want them to walk
[55:19] in fully trained.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Because a ra a birth we know is a mess.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; And if they're not trained, it's going
[55:27] to be a mess.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; It's going to be you're going to have
[55:31] somebody sitting there. They might stink
[55:32] a little bit. Their clothes might be
[55:34] dirty a little bit. They might not have
[55:36] the fanciest shoes on. They might be a
[55:39] mess. But were we not a mess
[55:42] &gt;&gt; when he reached down his hand for us?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Where were you at when he reached down
[55:46] for you?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; What were you into when he when his
[55:50] grace shone in your life?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; What were you doing?
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Would you have reached out to you? If
[55:57] you passed you on the street before
[55:58] before the Lord grabbed a hold of you,
[56:00] would you have talked to you?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Would you have invited you to church?
[56:05] What would you have done? Or would you
[56:06] would you have kept walking past you?
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Because you think about whoever many of
[56:10] us have people that have been mentors in
[56:12] our life, the the person that introduced
[56:14] the message to us, whatever it may be
[56:16] that that led us to Christ and you think
[56:19] about what they meant.
[56:21] I don't want to sherk away from that
[56:23] responsibility.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; If it's my responsibility to pass
[56:28] somebody on the street and say, "Would
[56:29] you like to come to church on Sunday?"
[56:31] If the Lord put that in my heart, my
[56:33] only prayer is that I'm obedient enough
[56:35] to to to adhere to it. That's my prayer.
[56:39] Lord, let me be willing. Let me have an
[56:41] obedient heart so when that time does
[56:43] come,
[56:45] &gt;&gt; I can hear you talking to me and I can
[56:47] stop and speak to somebody.
[56:50] Church, it's our responsibility to do
[56:52] that.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Who else is going to do it?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Who else has the truth?
[57:00] Yeah,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; me and brother George were talking
[57:01] recently and he I don't know if brother
[57:03] Billy Paul told him this or told
[57:05] somebody else and he had heard it, but
[57:06] brother Billy Paul, he he said he never
[57:09] caught a cleaned fish.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; He said when he went fishing that he had
[57:13] never caught a fish that was already
[57:15] cleaned.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You had to catch it. You had to get it,
[57:19] maybe put it in the net, take it off the
[57:21] off the hook, and you had to clean that
[57:23] thing thoroughly.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; And it'd be flopping around. It'd be you
[57:27] you might you might run a we used to my
[57:29] grandparents have a a pond on their land
[57:32] and me and my grandpa we'd go down there
[57:33] and fish and we'd bring the fish back
[57:35] and he we'd always take spoons and
[57:37] descale them that way get the scales off
[57:38] of them and when you're doing that it
[57:40] can be pretty uncomfortable and so that
[57:42] fish is probably going to react in a
[57:44] certain way. It's probably going to kick
[57:45] around. It's going to try and flop away
[57:47] from you. It's going to try and get away
[57:49] in whatever way it can because it's
[57:52] uncomfortable for it.
[57:54] The prophet said, he said, "How do you
[57:56] know that old bootleggger down here is
[57:58] not predestinated to life? How do you
[58:01] know that old street walker that you
[58:03] won't even speak to? How do you know
[58:05] that a little handshake and invite her
[58:07] to church wouldn't make a saint of God
[58:09] out of her yonder in the glory?" He
[58:11] said, "How do you know she's not?" He
[58:13] said, "That's what we don't know, but
[58:15] that's our duty."
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Another word for duty, you know what it
[58:19] could be? Is responsibility.
[58:22] It is our duty to do these things. He
[58:24] said like a fisherman throwed a net into
[58:25] the sea and pulled out. He brought
[58:27] frogs, fish, lizards, water spiders, and
[58:30] everything else, but some of them was
[58:32] fish.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He said he didn't know he was he he just
[58:37] c cast a net. That's what we do.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; He said, "Watch Paul." And but this is
[58:43] it's such a day and time where people
[58:45] avoid responsibility in general. I'm not
[58:48] I'm not even talking in the Christian
[58:50] ranks. I'm talking about responsibility
[58:52] in general. If you look at statistics,
[58:54] how many homes are without a father
[58:56] because he doesn't want to have the
[58:58] responsibility of raising the children,
[59:02] &gt;&gt; don't want to do anything. We on the
[59:05] job, nobody pretty much my generation
[59:08] and younger and a little bit older than
[59:10] me, they don't they don't want
[59:11] responsibility.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; They don't want anything like that. They
[59:14] want a carefree entitled life
[59:17] &gt;&gt; is what they want. Yeah.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; And that's just not you're not you're
[59:21] not going to get anywhere in the world
[59:23] that way. And in church, you're not
[59:25] going to get anywhere that way either.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Being entitled, not not adhering to
[59:29] God's responsibility in our lives.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; The definition of responsible is liable
[59:35] to be called on to answer. And so, I
[59:38] studied the psychology a little bit. I'm
[59:40] not a I'm not a psychology preacher or
[59:41] anything, but I studied the psychology
[59:44] of what it is, why people are so
[59:47] irresponsible nowadays, why people have
[59:49] such a problem with taking
[59:51] responsibility in any form or any
[59:53] fashion. And the number one thing was a
[59:55] fear of failure. It it was a fear of
[59:59] failing in some way or another. They
[1:00:01] don't want to put their self out there
[1:00:03] to take any responsibility for anything
[1:00:05] because they're scared that it won't
[1:00:07] work out. Sometimes we don't want to we
[1:00:10] don't want to reach out to somebody. We
[1:00:11] don't want to say a kind word of
[1:00:12] encouragement because we're scared it
[1:00:15] won't work out.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; The prophet said people are afraid to
[1:00:18] face up to the responsibility of coping
[1:00:21] with the message of the hour.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; They're afraid.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; He said we find that everywhere. And I
[1:00:28] think it's because we get it backwards
[1:00:29] sometimes. You know, we don't we don't
[1:00:31] have to answer for the message of the
[1:00:33] hour. It answers for us. We don't have
[1:00:36] to shield back the message of the hour
[1:00:38] and protect it, but it protects us.
[1:00:41] Christ protects us. He doesn't need our
[1:00:43] protection. Now, I'm all for standing on
[1:00:45] the ground, standing for what I believe,
[1:00:48] but he doesn't need me to protect him.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I don't have to protect him.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; I don't have to fuss and quarrel and and
[1:00:56] do all these things. He will stand on
[1:00:58] his own.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; I just want to be standing with him. He
[1:01:02] said, "It's our duty to stand. It's
[1:01:04] God's duty to back us up. He said, "You
[1:01:07] do your part and find out if God will
[1:01:09] not do his." But sometimes we can find
[1:01:12] ourselves running from responsibility.
[1:01:14] That's exactly what Jonah did. Jonah had
[1:01:16] a message to preach. God, he was sin of
[1:01:19] God to do something. He had a purpose in
[1:01:21] his life to go, but he sherked from that
[1:01:25] responsibility to do so. And you might
[1:01:27] say, "Well, brother Josh, that was a
[1:01:28] prophet. That was a man of the
[1:01:29] scripture. That was a man in the Bible.
[1:01:31] I'm not Jonah. I don't have that
[1:01:33] responsibility. Since when? Since when
[1:01:35] do we not? You know what brother
[1:01:37] Brandham said? Let me get down to a
[1:01:38] quote. That's a that's a I'm not a Jonah
[1:01:41] type attitude or I'm not brother
[1:01:43] Brandham attitude. I I don't have to do
[1:01:45] the same things he did. I don't have to
[1:01:47] preach the same message he preached.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; But look at what he said right here.
[1:01:53] If I can find it. He said, "See, it'll
[1:01:56] be." He said, "But this message that I'm
[1:01:57] preaching is the true message of this
[1:02:00] day, and it's the last message." He
[1:02:03] said, "You see what I'm doing, brethren.
[1:02:04] I'm putting you all the same place that
[1:02:07] I am." Now, what does that mean? I'm
[1:02:10] putting you all the same place that I
[1:02:12] am. Now, I'm not preaching that I'm a
[1:02:14] prophet. I'm not preaching that you're a
[1:02:15] prophet. But he's putting us in the same
[1:02:17] place with the same responsibility to
[1:02:20] get this message to the people
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; to tell to go and tell to get this
[1:02:25] message to somebody.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; He said because you're just as much into
[1:02:30] it as I am.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He said you are messengers of this same
[1:02:35] message.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; We have to take possession of a
[1:02:38] statement like that.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. You think about Joshua in chapter
[1:02:42] 18 of Joshua and he's standing there and
[1:02:45] I I believe there's seven tribes that
[1:02:47] have not yet taken possession of the
[1:02:49] promised land. And you know what Joshua
[1:02:51] does? He rebukes them directly.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Why why are you slack to go
[1:02:55] over here? This is you. It's freely
[1:02:57] given to you. This is yours. You can
[1:02:59] have it."
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; But they won't take it. They won't go
[1:03:05] across.
[1:03:06] You know, we have we have to become one
[1:03:08] with the word. We have to unite with the
[1:03:11] word. How are we ever going to unite
[1:03:13] with other brothers and sisters if we
[1:03:15] haven't even united ourselves with the
[1:03:17] word of God?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; How are we going to get to that point?
[1:03:21] He says, 'Now, when we find these things
[1:03:23] though, when we're confronted and come
[1:03:24] into a meeting and see the power of God
[1:03:27] moving and doing things and doing
[1:03:28] supernatural works and see it performed
[1:03:30] and look in the Bible and see that it's
[1:03:32] promised for this hour, then when we see
[1:03:34] those things and we are confronted with
[1:03:36] the responsibility to either accept it,
[1:03:40] I mean as for ourselves,
[1:03:42] he says now many people sympathize, he
[1:03:45] said many people say it's right,
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; excuse me, but that don't make it what
[1:03:50] he said that ain't the thing you're
[1:03:52] responsible for. He said, "If I was a
[1:03:54] young man and looking for a wife to be
[1:03:56] married and there stood a girl that met
[1:03:57] every qualification that I thought it
[1:03:59] took to make a woman," he said, "why,
[1:04:01] morally, she was a queen and lovely and
[1:04:03] a fine personality, a real Christian.
[1:04:06] Everything that I could think of to make
[1:04:07] me a good wife, no matter how much I say
[1:04:10] she's perfect, she's exactly right. She
[1:04:12] isn't mine till I accept her and the
[1:04:16] responsibility of her being my wife."
[1:04:18] This message is not yours until you
[1:04:21] accept the responsibility of this
[1:04:23] message. Until you accept this message
[1:04:25] into your heart and you are willing to
[1:04:27] do what the message says. The scripture
[1:04:30] calls us not to be just hearers of the
[1:04:32] word but doers of the word to go out and
[1:04:35] do what these men of God have done in
[1:04:38] the scripture, these women of God, what
[1:04:39] they've done to take a stand how they've
[1:04:42] stood.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's the call today.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; That's what the message is today.
[1:04:49] He said that's the same thing the
[1:04:50] message is. You might say it's all right
[1:04:52] or this that or the other and say I
[1:04:54] sympathize with it. I believe it's the
[1:04:57] truth but you've got to accept it.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And it's got to become a part of you and
[1:05:03] you a part of it. Said then it's yours.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; We've got to be more than just
[1:05:09] sympathizers with the word. a
[1:05:12] sympathizer when when there's a
[1:05:13] movement, when there's a political
[1:05:14] movement or whatever it may be,
[1:05:16] sympathizers, they're not one with that
[1:05:18] movement. They're not they're not really
[1:05:20] in the trenches with people that are
[1:05:21] that are in that movement, but they're
[1:05:23] kind of on the outside.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And then if some if something happens or
[1:05:27] or it goes away, they're fine with
[1:05:29] leaving it.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; We've got to be more than just a
[1:05:32] sympathizer with this message.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; More than just saying, "Oh, I believe
[1:05:36] it. Oh, it's right. Oh, it sounds good."
[1:05:37] More than just sitting on a pew,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; but it's living a life. It's walking out
[1:05:41] there amongst everybody and letting a
[1:05:43] light shine to the world. It's being
[1:05:46] selfless. It's living for one another.
[1:05:48] He said that's what Christianity is.
[1:05:50] It's living for one another. It's not
[1:05:53] living for yourself. It's not living for
[1:05:55] selfish motive. It's not living to get
[1:05:57] rich. It's not living to have a big
[1:06:00] mansion here. We have a mansion over
[1:06:01] there.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; I don't need a mansion here.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; I'll live in it there. But while we're
[1:06:07] here, we're to sojourn. We're to pull in
[1:06:09] souls.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; We're to work for the Lord.
[1:06:14] And we have a responsibility as well to
[1:06:17] be sons and daughters of God.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; That's a responsibility. A lot of the
[1:06:22] times we don't think of it that way. But
[1:06:25] it's a responsibility. If you've
[1:06:27] accepted this word, if you've accepted
[1:06:29] this message, that comes handinhand with
[1:06:31] it just as much as anything else does.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. is a responsibility to be a
[1:06:36] manifested son or daughter of God. The
[1:06:38] prophet tells us that's he he says
[1:06:41] what's everything waiting on. What's the
[1:06:42] whole creation waiting for? The
[1:06:44] manifestations of the sons of God.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; It's waiting for the church to become in
[1:06:49] its position.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; And now living with those the the
[1:06:53] attitudes of of that was for a past day.
[1:06:55] That was for brother Brandham's
[1:06:56] meetings.
[1:06:58] Jonah had that to do. That was for
[1:07:00] Jonah. That wasn't for me. Living with
[1:07:02] that attitude will never will never
[1:07:05] result in a manifested son or daughter
[1:07:07] of God.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; You're you're you're short changing
[1:07:10] yourself
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; is what you're doing
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; because we don't have to that you know
[1:07:15] that days of miracles is past spirit.
[1:07:17] It's still very alive.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; It hasn't left. And I'm not just talking
[1:07:22] about the signs and the wonders and the
[1:07:24] miracles.
[1:07:25] But what that spirit did is it it said
[1:07:28] either you had to either you were past
[1:07:30] something. It said that all that was
[1:07:32] just for the apostles that were just for
[1:07:34] the ones that Jesus was talking to or it
[1:07:36] puts something off way in the future.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; That's what that spirit does. What that
[1:07:41] spirit does that that's an antichrist
[1:07:43] spirit meant to hold the people down so
[1:07:45] they don't come to the full revelation
[1:07:48] of who they are
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; of who they are in this hour. Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of time I' I've had
[1:07:56] people tell me that they wish they could
[1:07:58] have been in brother Brandham's
[1:07:59] meetings, and I I wish the same thing. I
[1:08:01] I'm not going to sit here and pretend
[1:08:03] like if if there was a time machine here
[1:08:04] and I could travel back and sit in a few
[1:08:07] that I wouldn't do that.
[1:08:10] But it it doesn't take that for you to
[1:08:13] be a beneficiary of God's power.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; You don't have to travel back to a
[1:08:17] specific spot in time. But Hebrews 13:8
[1:08:20] tells us
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; that he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:08:24] forever. That that power is just as much
[1:08:26] alive today as it was in those meetings.
[1:08:29] I'm not saying we're we're brother
[1:08:30] Brandham. I'm not saying we we can do
[1:08:33] exactly what he did. I'm not saying
[1:08:34] we're going to see visions. You may,
[1:08:38] but what I'm saying is that same power
[1:08:40] that was in those meetings can be the
[1:08:42] same power today.
[1:08:44] The prophet said, "This comfort is not
[1:08:46] for the seven church age messengers
[1:08:48] only." He said, "Every true believer is
[1:08:51] in the hand of God and can draw from his
[1:08:54] love and from his power and receive the
[1:08:57] full benefit of all that God is to the
[1:09:00] believer." He said, "What God gives the
[1:09:03] messenger and how he blesses and uses
[1:09:05] the messenger is an example to all
[1:09:07] believers of his goodness and care to
[1:09:10] all members of the body.
[1:09:13] 1 John 3 says, "Behold what manner of
[1:09:16] love the Father hath bestowed upon us
[1:09:18] that we should be called the sons of
[1:09:20] God.
[1:09:22] Therefore, the world knoweth us not
[1:09:24] because it knew him not." Beloved, now
[1:09:26] we are the sons of God.
[1:09:30] Now we are the sons of God, and it doth
[1:09:32] not yet appear what we shall be, but we
[1:09:34] know that when he shall appear, we shall
[1:09:37] be like him, for we shall see him as he
[1:09:39] is. Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; He says in doors end doors have a
[1:09:43] purpose in life.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; He said something you're going to do.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; He said God placed you here. Do
[1:09:50] something about it. Every member of
[1:09:53] every church.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Every single one of us has we have a
[1:09:56] message that'll reach somebody. The same
[1:09:59] person that would hear me out there
[1:10:01] might not be the same person that would
[1:10:02] hear you.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; And you might be able to reach somebody
[1:10:05] that I could never speak to my whole
[1:10:08] life. They would never hear me out. We
[1:10:10] each have a message from the preacher to
[1:10:12] the janitor to the deacon to everybody
[1:10:14] in the church. We have a message. We
[1:10:17] have a responsibility to that message.
[1:10:20] He said each one has something to say.
[1:10:23] Each one has a work. Each has a
[1:10:26] ministry.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; What about that? Every person sitting in
[1:10:30] this church here this evening has a
[1:10:33] ministry of their own.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; They have something to do of their own.
[1:10:38] It's not just up to me to stand up here.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; It's not just up to Brother Joel,
[1:10:43] Brother Ben. It's not just up to
[1:10:45] preachers. It's not just up to deacons.
[1:10:47] You don't have to have a title to have a
[1:10:49] ministry.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; You can have a ministry at your job.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You can have a ministry, young people,
[1:10:56] at your school.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; What a testimony that would be
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; that you have a ministry out there and
[1:11:03] you pull people into here.
[1:11:06] Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we those are very
[1:11:09] simple things to think about,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; but I think sometimes we don't grab a
[1:11:13] hold of it as much as we should.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; We there God puts opportunities in our
[1:11:17] life to speak to people and we pass them
[1:11:19] by.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; We pass a soul by something worth 10,000
[1:11:23] worlds. We pass by.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; He says God was revealed in Christ.
[1:11:33] Jehovah revealed in Christ. He said,
[1:11:36] "Now, where's God to be revealed? In his
[1:11:38] church, with his people, in us." He
[1:11:42] said, "The same spirit, the same works,
[1:11:45] the same manifestation, the same love,
[1:11:47] the same forgiveness, the same
[1:11:49] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[1:11:51] peace, mercy, all that was in Christ is
[1:11:54] in the church." He said, "Remember, keep
[1:11:57] this in mind. All that God was, he
[1:11:59] poured into Christ. He was the fullness
[1:12:02] of the godhead bodily and all that
[1:12:04] Christ was he poured into the church.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; God above us, God with us, God in us.
[1:12:10] The triunity of God, God manifested in
[1:12:13] three different manners. Father, Son,
[1:12:15] and Holy Spirit,
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; but I don't want to I don't want to be
[1:12:20] one shortch changing God in my own life.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; If I'm to be a manifested son or
[1:12:25] daughter of God, I don't I don't want to
[1:12:27] to stop myself. I don't want to let the
[1:12:30] devil stop me.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Joshua when he was standing there and
[1:12:33] the Gibeonites needed his help and he
[1:12:35] was standing in Gibian and he said he he
[1:12:38] was what went I couldn't imagine this
[1:12:40] going through my my mind to tell the son
[1:12:42] to stand still
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; to think that I could do something like
[1:12:46] that. But what if Joshua's attitude and
[1:12:48] his mindset would have been been more
[1:12:50] along the lines of that was something
[1:12:52] for Moses actually. That was I don't
[1:12:54] know if I had the abil not not ability
[1:12:57] but I don't know if I had the uh the
[1:12:59] backing of the Lord to do that.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; If Moses was here, he would do it.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; He could do it. The Lord would hear his
[1:13:06] voice.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; But I'm not sure if the Lord will hear
[1:13:09] my cry.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; What if that was Joshua's mindset?
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't. and he stood there and he
[1:13:14] said, "Son, stand still." And now he
[1:13:17] didn't say that. Uh sometimes the the
[1:13:19] preaching nowadays it sounds like we're
[1:13:21] talking about a superpower that we have
[1:13:23] that we have a that we have to use. But
[1:13:26] if you notice anytime the prophet when
[1:13:28] he spoke squirrels into existence when
[1:13:30] he did was sister Hadty, right? These
[1:13:32] things were sovereignly given.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; It was not a superpower. It was not
[1:13:36] something to be flashy.
[1:13:39] But he wants our character to get to a
[1:13:41] place to where he can use us in a
[1:13:43] fashion like that where he can do
[1:13:45] something. Do you think if if the Lord
[1:13:47] knew that Sister Haddie would have asked
[1:13:49] for anything else but what she did,
[1:13:51] would she have been given that
[1:13:52] opportunity or was her character in a in
[1:13:55] in such a place that he could use her in
[1:13:58] that fashion
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; that she could be given that sovereignly
[1:14:02] in that moment? Amen.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; And that's where we should be getting to
[1:14:06] as manifested sons and daughters of God.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; If we want to have power in the church,
[1:14:11] we have to get the character in the
[1:14:13] church right first.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Because if he can't trust you with his
[1:14:17] power, he won't give it to you.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; And that's just the truth of it.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Let me get on down here.
[1:14:31] But we have to have the revelation
[1:14:33] that we are messengers of the very same
[1:14:36] message. Not that we're not that we're a
[1:14:39] knockoff of that message. Not that we
[1:14:41] have less power than when it was
[1:14:43] initially preached.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; But that we are messengers of that same
[1:14:47] message. That we've been put in the
[1:14:49] exact same place. He said it. I didn't
[1:14:51] say that. But he said, "I'm putting you
[1:14:53] in the same place that I am to be a
[1:14:57] manifested son or daughter of God to
[1:15:00] reveal this thing to bring the fullness
[1:15:01] of the word to the people so that they
[1:15:04] may live how they're supposed to live.
[1:15:07] So that they don't live below their
[1:15:09] means.
[1:15:10] So that we don't we don't have to accept
[1:15:12] these things that the enemy puts in our
[1:15:14] lives."
[1:15:19] But this revelation, it brings us to a
[1:15:21] certain responsibility in the word. The
[1:15:23] prophet said, and as I'm closing here,
[1:15:26] it was short, but I'm Joel's got to
[1:15:28] preach and we got to get them somewhere.
[1:15:31] But I'll just read a few more quotes.
[1:15:33] Musicians can go ahead and come.
[1:15:36] But in a man running from the presence
[1:15:38] of the Lord,
[1:15:41] the prophet says, "And the
[1:15:42] responsibility that God has given us in
[1:15:46] this day to bring this message." Now, he
[1:15:49] didn't just say me. He didn't say it was
[1:15:52] up to me alone, but he said the
[1:15:54] responsibility that he's given us in
[1:15:56] this day to bring this message. He said,
[1:15:58] "And as I get older and I know my days
[1:16:00] are shortening up, this should be each
[1:16:03] one of us. I feel the responsibility
[1:16:05] greater than I ever felt.
[1:16:09] He said, "Pressing on, we must do it. We
[1:16:12] must get down to it. And everywhere we
[1:16:15] go and tell the message." He said,
[1:16:17] "Everywhere we go, tell the message."
[1:16:20] And you say, "Isn't that a Isn't that a
[1:16:21] little bit too far, Brother Josh? Isn't
[1:16:24] that when I'm at when I'm at Walmart,
[1:16:25] when I'm at the gas station, you want me
[1:16:27] to be telling the message to somebody?
[1:16:29] Is any place the wrong place? Do we just
[1:16:32] got to talk about it when we're in
[1:16:34] between these four walls?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Do we just feel bold with the message
[1:16:39] when we're talking to somebody else that
[1:16:41] believes it like we do or has already
[1:16:44] seen it?
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Or our hearts open and willing to do
[1:16:48] work for the Lord
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; to do what he needs us to do to go and
[1:16:53] speak to who he needs us to speak to.
[1:16:56] We are his hands and his feet.
[1:17:00] If he doesn't have us, who does he have?
[1:17:03] How are [music] how are souls going to
[1:17:04] be saved?
[1:17:06] Who's going to preach this message?
[1:17:09] Who's going to tell the good news? He
[1:17:10] said, "And tell the people that Jesus
[1:17:13] Christ is coming, that he's God and he's
[1:17:15] coming soon."
[1:17:18] He said, "There's not a hope left in the
[1:17:20] world, but the coming of the Lord."
[1:17:23] He says here, "Now God kept raising up
[1:17:27] not only the messengers to each age, but
[1:17:30] he raised up some wonderful helpers for
[1:17:33] those messengers." And that's my prayer
[1:17:35] this evening. I want to be one of those
[1:17:37] wonderful helpers.
[1:17:39] Just because the prophet's off the
[1:17:41] scene,
[1:17:44] that doesn't mean that we don't have
[1:17:45] power, that we don't that we don't have
[1:17:47] responsibility in the word.
[1:17:51] And I just pray that he would make me a
[1:17:52] better helper. That he would open my
[1:17:54] heart up. That he would make me willing
[1:17:56] to speak to whoever he would have me to
[1:17:58] speak to. Whatever he would have me to
[1:18:00] do. I don't want to be reserved. I don't
[1:18:03] I don't want to hold back because we
[1:18:05] don't know if somebody would understand
[1:18:07] what we're saying. That's not our place
[1:18:09] to call. That's not our call to make.
[1:18:12] But our call is to go and tell.
[1:18:16] Our call is to pull in.
[1:18:19] It's not all about the deep things and
[1:18:21] the and the [music] mysteries and and
[1:18:23] all this and that. Those things are
[1:18:24] wonderful. Those things have a purpose,
[1:18:27] but it's about saving souls.
[1:18:31] And that may be oldfashioned. That may
[1:18:32] be back to the basics.
[1:18:36] But that's what we're supposed to go
[1:18:37] back to anyways is that blueprint that
[1:18:39] day of Pentecost experience. [music]
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Go back to the pattern that was
[1:18:43] originally set. And when they went out
[1:18:46] in the book of Acts, we're supposed to
[1:18:47] be a continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:18:50] And when they went out, they do you
[1:18:52] think they were scared to declare the
[1:18:54] message that they had heard? You think
[1:18:56] they were scared to talk to anybody?
[1:19:00] Because it was a lot harder then than it
[1:19:02] is now. [music] They were out for their
[1:19:04] life then.
[1:19:06] They wanted to take them off the scene
[1:19:08] then.
[1:19:11] But while while it's easy to spread the
[1:19:14] message, let's spread it. Let's talk to
[1:19:17] somebody about it.
[1:19:19] Purpose in oursel to tell somebody about
[1:19:22] the good news. Tell somebody about what
[1:19:25] pulled you up out of that myy clay.
[1:19:29] I just ask that the Lord would help me
[1:19:32] to be more selfless,
[1:19:35] to not be so worried about what people
[1:19:36] would would think or what they would
[1:19:38] say.
[1:19:40] If I had the uncction to stop and tell
[1:19:42] somebody about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:19:48] God bless you.
[1:19:53] Word
[1:19:54] that was spoken [singing]
[1:20:00] by the prophet [singing]
[1:20:03] of Malachi
[1:20:06] 4.
[1:20:09] Oh,
[1:20:11] can't you [music] see
[1:20:14] why
[1:20:16] I
[1:20:20] [music]
[1:20:28] Lord,
[1:20:31] all the revealed
[1:20:34] [singing]
[1:20:35] word
[1:20:37] that was spoken [singing]
[1:20:42] by the prophet
[1:20:46] of Malachi.
[1:20:49] Amen. Does the word make you [music]
[1:20:50] happy tonight? Let me hear you sing it.
[1:20:52] Oh, can't you sing?
[1:20:56] [music]
[1:20:56] Why
[1:20:58] I'm so happy? [singing]
[1:21:01] Have you accepted it? Well, I've
[1:21:04] accepted [music]
[1:21:06] the word [singing] of the Lord.
[1:21:13] All the revealed
[1:21:16] [music]
[1:21:17] word that was spoken [singing]
[1:21:24] by the prophet
[1:21:27] of Malachi
[1:21:30] 4.
[1:21:32] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:21:34] praise tonight.
[1:21:36] Amen. That ought to make us happy.
[1:21:38] [applause]
[1:21:38] Amen. And with the message came with the
[1:21:41] message came a lot of responsibility.
[1:21:42] But aren't you glad that he had a people
[1:21:44] prepared to take on [music] that
[1:21:46] responsibility. Amen. He didn't leave
[1:21:48] his he didn't leave his church uh
[1:21:50] without a people. He never he doesn't
[1:21:52] leave his uh he doesn't leave he doesn't
[1:21:53] leave the world without a witness. And
[1:21:55] he doesn't leave a mean the [music]
[1:21:56] church without a body. Amen. Because in
[1:21:59] his absence we have a body and we have a
[1:22:01] voice. [music] And we're thankful that
[1:22:03] we don't preach our own thoughts. We
[1:22:05] don't preach our own message, [music]
[1:22:07] but we preach just what a prophet said.
[1:22:09] We believe everything he said. How about
[1:22:11] you? Aren't you thankful for it? That's
[1:22:13] why we have a responsibility to say only
[1:22:15] what he said. We don't come up with new
[1:22:18] doctrines and ideas. Many men have tried
[1:22:19] it. Amen. But aren't you glad that we
[1:22:21] have a vindicated prophet. So thoroughly
[1:22:23] vindicated, we don't have to wonder, was
[1:22:25] he a prophet? Was he not a prophet? Was
[1:22:27] he right? No, we just believe what he
[1:22:29] said. Not because of who he was or the
[1:22:31] miracles he did, but he's a word
[1:22:33] prophet. [music]
[1:22:33] We can find him in the scriptures. And
[1:22:35] then after you find him in the
[1:22:37] scriptures, his word will place you
[1:22:38] [music] in the scriptures. And then when
[1:22:40] you can see yourself, you can see the
[1:22:42] same power. I wish somebody I tell you
[1:22:44] what, I wish I could preach now. Amen. I
[1:22:46] That was good. I enjoyed that. I enjoyed
[1:22:48] that. Amen. We have a responsibility to
[1:22:50] carry this message. But we're not going
[1:22:52] to let nobody take it from us or try to
[1:22:54] come in and and interpret in a different
[1:22:56] ways. No, it's already been interpreted.
[1:22:58] It's already been thoroughly vindicated.
[1:22:59] All we got to do is believe it and then
[1:23:02] act on it. Amen. It's more that like the
[1:23:04] preacher said tonight and we don't just
[1:23:06] hear it. Although we do have to be
[1:23:07] hearing it.
[1:23:09] [music] Somebody ought to say amen on
[1:23:11] that. I mean, it ain't good enough to
[1:23:12] just say, "Well, I'll let the preacher
[1:23:14] break it down." No, you need to be
[1:23:15] hearing this. And your brother said,
[1:23:16] "I'm storing up food so that you'll have
[1:23:17] something to eat." And he also [music]
[1:23:19] told us, he said, "You can sit in the
[1:23:21] cool of your home and hear these tapes."
[1:23:23] He had a reason for it. It was long
[1:23:25] sometimes, but you can sit there with
[1:23:26] your Bible and in your study and get
[1:23:28] along with God. Amen. He can reveal
[1:23:30] things to you. And then when you got a
[1:23:32] man in the pulpit saying the same
[1:23:34] things, you'll go hear it the same thing
[1:23:35] in church. And you know, that's when you
[1:23:37] know, hey, I'm not just following
[1:23:38] another preacher, but we're hearing the
[1:23:41] word in our home. And I tell you what, I
[1:23:43] think it's important to be hearing the
[1:23:44] tapes. It's [music] important to be
[1:23:46] reading your Bibles and praying every
[1:23:48] day. I believe all these things are so
[1:23:49] important to us. Amen. We have a
[1:23:51] responsibility. Amen. I I say let's just
[1:23:53] take a hold of the responsibility as men
[1:23:55] and women. Don't sherk our
[1:23:56] responsibilities, but let's just hold on
[1:23:58] to [music] this message. Amen. With
[1:23:59] everything that's in us and and I'll
[1:24:01] tell you what, uh if you heard what he
[1:24:03] said tonight, Amen. Don't just go out of
[1:24:05] here and say, "Well, it was just another
[1:24:06] good sermon." No, let's do better. Let's
[1:24:08] do better on Monday morning. If you
[1:24:10] hadn't read your Bible in a while, get
[1:24:11] up on Monday morning and make it a
[1:24:12] start. If you haven't if you haven't
[1:24:14] [music] listened to a tape in your home
[1:24:15] in a while, I say it's a good day to do
[1:24:16] it. Amen. It won't hurt nobody to hear
[1:24:18] some more tapes. [music] Amen. We sure
[1:24:20] love Amen. If you love the message of
[1:24:22] the hour, I mean, it'll do something for
[1:24:24] you. When you [music] hear this message,
[1:24:26] it'll just do something for you. You
[1:24:27] don't fall in love with the messenger.
[1:24:29] Although we love the messenger, but when
[1:24:31] you hear that message, you start seeing
[1:24:33] yourself. Remember, Eleazar was to just
[1:24:35] [music] present a bride to Isaac. You
[1:24:38] didn't Rebecca didn't fall in love with
[1:24:40] Eleaser. She fell in love with Isaac.
[1:24:42] Brother Brandon was to present you to
[1:24:44] Christ and he was to present. Amen. He
[1:24:46] wanted you to fall in love with him. And
[1:24:49] I tell you what, I think we can do that
[1:24:50] tonight with what you heard. Amen. It
[1:24:52] was simple. It was short. And I tell you
[1:24:55] what, a donkey couldn't have done no
[1:24:57] better. Amen. You did a good job, buddy.
[1:24:59] Amen. Did you enjoy the word of the Lord
[1:25:01] tonight? Go ahead and give the Lord
[1:25:02] praise. [applause]
[1:25:05] The word of [singing] the Lord.
[1:25:10] Oh, the revealed
[1:25:15] word
[1:25:16] that was spoken [singing]
[1:25:20] [music]
[1:25:22] by the prophet
[1:25:25] of Malachi.
[1:25:28] One more time with all your hearts
[1:25:29] [music] now. Oh, sing it out. Can't
[1:25:32] [singing]
[1:25:33] you see?
[1:25:35] Oh, why we are so happy.
[1:25:39] [singing and music]
[1:25:41] Oh, cuz we've accepted
[1:25:45] [music] the word
[1:25:48] of the Lord. [singing]
[1:25:52] Oh, the reveal [music]
[1:25:56] [singing] word
[1:25:58] that was spoke
[1:26:01] spoken
[1:26:03] by the prophet
[1:26:07] of Malachi.
[1:26:10] Oh,
[1:26:12] just before we go now, I would not be
[1:26:14] denied. Well, I would not be [singing]
[1:26:19] denied.
[1:26:20] Oh no, I would not [music] be [singing]
[1:26:24] denied
[1:26:26] till my Jesus came [music] and he made
[1:26:30] me whole. I would not [singing] be
[1:26:35] denied.
[1:26:37] Oh, [music] with pains of death she's
[1:26:40] on.
[1:26:43] Unto [music]
[1:26:44] the Lord [singing] I cry.
[1:26:48] Till Jesus came and he made
[1:26:51] [music and singing] me whole. I would
[1:26:54] not be.
[1:26:57] Sing [music] it out now.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; till my Jesus [music and singing] came
[1:27:12] and he made me
[1:27:14] I would not [music and singing] be
[1:27:19] well as Jacob is
[1:27:23] the Lord [music]
[1:27:25] I wrestle with alone.
[1:27:30] Oh, and
[1:27:32] with a courageful [singing]
[1:27:36] master [music]
[1:27:42] [singing]
[1:27:45] [music]
[1:27:52] [music] Jesus came and made me whole. I
[1:27:57] would not be denied. [singing]
[1:28:01] Well, [music] Satan said my Lord was
[1:28:06] gone and [singing] would not hear. And
[1:28:10] we don't believe that, do we? Oh,
[1:28:12] [music] but praise the Lord, the work is
[1:28:17] done in Christ. Oh, you believe he's
[1:28:20] here tonight. Sing it out now. Oh,
[1:28:28] [music] I would not be
[1:28:33] [music] till Jesus came and he made me
[1:28:38] whole. I would [singing] not be denied.
[1:28:42] And old Satan [music] said, "Oh, Satan
[1:28:45] said, my [singing] Lord was gone [music]
[1:28:49] and would not hear my prayer."
[1:28:54] Oh, but praise [singing] the Lord.
[1:28:57] [music] The work is done in Christ
[1:29:02] is here [singing]
[1:29:06] not
[1:29:08] [singing]
[1:29:14] [music] until my [singing] Jesus came
[1:29:18] and made me whole. I [music and singing]
[1:29:21] would not be denied.
[1:29:25] Ohana.
[1:29:28] Oh, [music and singing] blessed be the
[1:29:30] rock. Blessed be the rock of my
[1:29:34] salvation. [singing]
