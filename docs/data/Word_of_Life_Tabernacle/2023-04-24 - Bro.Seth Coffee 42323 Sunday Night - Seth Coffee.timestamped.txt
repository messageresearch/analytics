[15:51] if you want

[16:01] Solomon come and greet you all this
[16:02] evening and if he takes enough time
[16:04] brother Seth won't get to preach
[16:06] but but if it doesn't take too much time
[16:08] the brother Seth will still be preaching
[16:10] afterwards but I'd like you to welcome
[16:11] brother Solomon Huffman with us this
[16:13] evening as he comes and greets the
[16:15] people
[16:16] if you're happy to have him here
[16:20] and they just take your time buddy
[16:23] you need you need one
[16:26] hahaha
[16:29] amen you love the Lord tonight
[16:31] amen can you agree with that song and
[16:33] say truly all the time God's been
[16:35] faithful
[16:36] amen we're sure happy to be here and I
[16:39] thoroughly enjoyed the word this morning
[16:40] and uh just have such a welcoming Spirit
[16:43] here and just feel right at home and
[16:45] feel like the family and so I tell you
[16:48] you learn to really appreciate that
[16:49] there's some places you go you don't
[16:51] feel that welcome but uh just our whole
[16:53] trip here we've definitely felt very
[16:55] welcome and we appreciate that and you
[16:58] know I believe that that's the spirit of
[16:59] this message
[17:01] I believe it causes a unity and the
[17:03] bride and it just causes us all to feel
[17:06] like family and so we just greet you
[17:08] tonight in the name of the Lord and some
[17:11] of you that do know me and brother
[17:12] Solomon Huffman and fellowship over by
[17:15] the Josh Bennett's assembly in North
[17:17] Carolina and he would sure want to send
[17:19] his greetings to the church here and I
[17:22] guess in Ministry you know a word gets
[17:24] out quite a good bit of different
[17:25] churches and works to get started and
[17:28] we've always heard such a positive
[17:29] report of other men and we certainly
[17:32] appreciate that
[17:33] and I appreciate his stand on the word
[17:35] of God and I was just thinking you know
[17:37] if there was anything that I could
[17:39] admonish a church would be to stay with
[17:40] the word amen stay with the message of
[17:43] the hour I I believe it's God God's
[17:46] ordained Ark to bring us to the Rapture
[17:48] and tell you if you ever get a true
[17:51] revelation of what this message is is
[17:53] Jesus Christ all the way through and we
[17:57] thank the Lord that we have the
[17:58] revelation of this message and so we
[18:01] certainly appreciate the Believers here
[18:03] and we just certainly enjoyed being here
[18:05] with you and I just wanted to share
[18:06] something small before but the Seth came
[18:09] out and I I don't plan to be one of
[18:11] those brothers that would take an hour
[18:13] or two to do that but I did I did just
[18:17] want to speak something small to you in
[18:18] Hebrews the second chapter there's a
[18:20] verse of scripture here
[18:22] and uh just some things that I've been
[18:24] studying on for quite some time and
[18:26] preaching around and I think this
[18:28] scripture is a beautiful scripture in
[18:30] Hebrews the second chapter in the first
[18:32] verse the Bible tells us here therefore
[18:34] we ought to give the more Earnest heed
[18:36] to the things which we have heard
[18:39] now we can all agree we've heard a lot
[18:41] of sermons and a lot of preaching but
[18:43] the Bible says to give an Earnest heed
[18:45] so so put in action the things that
[18:48] we've heard amen give them more Ernest
[18:50] heed and I I think that scripture is
[18:52] telling us we ought to take this word
[18:54] serious amen we should take our
[18:56] opportunity that God gives us as a
[18:59] serious opportunity lest at any time we
[19:01] should let them slip and uh just on on
[19:04] that little scripture there there's a
[19:06] story that brother Wayne tells him the
[19:08] message and I'm sure many of you
[19:09] familiar with it but he talks about this
[19:12] man
[19:13] that had a death sentence and this man
[19:15] went to to appeal his trial that was
[19:18] going to take place and the brother
[19:20] Wayne mentions in several places but God
[19:22] projected in his love he talks about
[19:24] this man that receives a part and I
[19:27] think it's such a a beautiful story
[19:29] brother when him tells us and this man
[19:32] was here with a death sentence and all
[19:34] of us was born with that same sentence
[19:35] of death is that right and uh they came
[19:38] to the president brother William says
[19:40] here was Abraham Lincoln and tell him
[19:42] the story and he said and the president
[19:43] being in a hurry picked up a small piece
[19:45] of paper and wrote on it I pardoned this
[19:48] man and then signed his name Abraham
[19:50] Lincoln
[19:51] and the carrier brought the piece of
[19:53] paper to the sale and said to the man
[19:55] you are free I want you to notice this
[19:58] and as the man looked at it he said well
[20:00] it doesn't seem official to me in other
[20:03] words he couldn't believe that something
[20:05] so simple would be his opportunity for
[20:07] freedom and it would be his opportunity
[20:10] to to not have a death sentence on him
[20:12] he said it doesn't seem official to me I
[20:15] just don't believe it and I'll not leave
[20:17] here and he rejected it because it was
[20:20] on a small piece of paper and not a
[20:22] great later not a great letterhead and
[20:25] that man later on would actually be
[20:27] killed with his death sentence and you
[20:30] know I thought that was such a powerful
[20:31] story because this man had a free pardon
[20:34] from the president and signed it himself
[20:36] and it was an opportunity to go
[20:39] completely free and to have a complete
[20:42] freedom and I thought you know that just
[20:44] ties to that scripture he didn't give a
[20:46] heed to his opportunity amen God gave
[20:49] that man a day of Grace and he rejected
[20:51] it that day of Grace and turn down his
[20:54] freedom and you know I believe as man
[20:57] that God has allowed us to have a time
[21:00] allotted on Earth and God has all given
[21:03] us an opportunity is that right we all
[21:05] have an opportunity that God has given
[21:07] us and that man refused the opportunity
[21:10] that he had and you know just thinking
[21:12] on that you think of every Church age
[21:14] and every dispensation of Praise all all
[21:17] the there's been many message believeth
[21:19] for you and I and they all have their
[21:21] opportunity with the word
[21:23] they all had their opportunity on what
[21:25] they're going to do with the word and
[21:27] you know we can look back at ones that
[21:29] have failed and that have went away from
[21:30] the word but I believe we've got to keep
[21:33] our eyes on the word and we got to take
[21:35] our opportunity you know we can't help
[21:37] what people before us have done and as
[21:39] young people here you can't help what
[21:41] other young people do we can all help
[21:43] what we do with our opportunity I don't
[21:45] know about you as for me I want to take
[21:47] my opportunity amen the Bible tells us
[21:50] in the Book of James life is just but a
[21:52] vapor and this small period of time we
[21:54] have to live on the face of the earth I
[21:56] want to take advantage of every
[21:58] opportunity every time I can receive
[22:01] something from God I want to seize that
[22:03] opportunity and seize that moment and
[22:05] take advantage of it and you know Luther
[22:08] of course they had their opportunity
[22:10] with the word and Wesley and Pentecost
[22:13] at Azusa Street all of them had their
[22:15] opportunity but they're not here no more
[22:17] amen this is our opportunity this is our
[22:20] time you can't look on on the day gone
[22:23] by this is our hour this is our season
[22:25] of opportunity and I believe that
[22:27] there's been a pardon I'll be I believe
[22:29] there's been a Grace to spend allotted
[22:31] to this generation I I believe that a
[22:34] prophet preached to us that this is the
[22:35] time of Jubilee this is the opportunity
[22:38] of Jubilee this is the opportunity we
[22:40] don't have to be a slave to sin I think
[22:42] there's such a powerful quote whether
[22:44] I'm said to to you that's on tape until
[22:46] it is and to the visible audience he
[22:50] said that the day of sin is over we
[22:53] don't have to be a slave to any spirit
[22:56] we don't have to be a slave to the devil
[22:58] and I just want to admonish you in this
[23:00] this is the opportunity to get anything
[23:02] you need from God and I just pray that
[23:05] that God will always help us to to seize
[23:08] our opportunity and don't don't Harden
[23:11] your hearts but don't refuse him that
[23:13] speaketh but but take every opportunity
[23:15] and I I tell you I think it's such a
[23:17] shame that man that brother Branham
[23:19] tells he he was so close to his freedom
[23:21] but yet amen he denied it
[23:24] he was so close to to not have the death
[23:27] sentence but he denied his opportunity I
[23:29] say God help us help us to take the
[23:31] opportunity and to realize this moment
[23:34] in time amen that we're not promised
[23:36] tomorrow we're not promised another week
[23:38] but I think tonight God has given us an
[23:40] opportunity in this service and his
[23:43] brother Seth will get ready to come I I
[23:45] believe that God has laid something on
[23:47] his heart for us and I believe that if
[23:50] you'll pull that God can minister to
[23:52] every need and I tell you we should
[23:54] cherish every opportunity God gives us
[23:57] and we just say God bless you and I I
[24:00] just hope that that would maybe maybe
[24:01] break somebody's heart that the day of
[24:04] sin is over and this is your opportunity
[24:06] to live a free life and I just say God
[24:09] bless you and we sure appreciate you
[24:11] here and
[24:12] that'll be all I've got to say
[24:15] [Applause]
[24:23] thank you
[24:25] [Music]
[24:28] as brother Seth comes you ready for the
[24:31] word of the Lord tonight
[24:33] I appreciate that brother Solomon amen
[24:36] just want to dig into the word of the
[24:38] Lord and take full advantage of every
[24:40] opportunity we have here tonight so his
[24:41] brother Seth comes oh I worship you God
[24:48] [Music]
[25:09] that is
[25:11] [Music]
[25:51] foreign
[25:54] [Music]
[26:22] or there is none like you almighty God
[26:28] it's not like you father that Lord I
[26:32] know many of our testimonies father Lord

[26:35] we looked out at the world father we
[26:38] tried to find peace in the world and we
[26:40] couldn't find it Lord we tried to find
[26:43] joy out there God lord even within our
[26:46] own families Lord we tried to find stuff
[26:49] Lord that that would fill us Lord God
[26:52] but when we got the end of the road Lord
[26:54] we found one almighty God and Lord that
[26:57] met each and every one of our hearts
[26:59] desires Lord father how we're here to

[27:04] there is none like you Lord where else
[27:06] would we turn to tonight father but we
[27:09] know tonight almighty God lord as I
[27:11] think of that scripture Lord no matter

[27:15] feeling this evening when we have a high
[27:17] priest or that can be touched by the
[27:20] feeling of our infirmities almighty God
[27:22] lord lord your Prophet would say would
[27:25] always amaze me about God was how this
[27:28] God that created all the heavens and the
[27:30] Earth could become so simple Lord that
[27:33] you would come Lord and be born father
[27:35] in a Manger Lord God just to understand
[27:38] how we feel and what we're going through
[27:40] Lord Lord we can look at our neighbor
[27:42] father and they might not know what
[27:44] we're going through but Lord You're the
[27:46] high priest that can be touched tonight
[27:48] father Lord because you know what it's
[27:50] like to be a man father you know what
[27:51] it's like to be a human being Lord and
[27:54] Lord you know everything about us Lord

[28:04] we're just pray and Lord God over this
[28:06] service Lord because father I don't know

[29:08] would want to say tonight father Lord I
[29:10] pray that you would bless this little
[29:11] congregation father forgive us of every
[29:13] shortcoming ever sin and every iniquity
[29:16] Lord father bless your children tonight
[29:18] we love you we praise you in Jesus name
[29:21] amen amen that'll be all for the music
[29:24] it's so good to see you again
[29:26] it's been a few months since we've been
[29:27] here we always appreciate the
[29:29] opportunity to come and speak to you I
[29:31] love to speak to the people that love
[29:33] the Lord Jesus Christ you know it's a
[29:36] it's a humbling experience to be here
[29:38] because you know you realize we can look
[29:40] at Jesus sometimes we look at ourselves
[29:42] and we don't value ourselves that much
[29:44] you know we see all our mistakes we see
[29:46] all our shortcomings we see all our
[29:48] failures but do you realize within
[29:50] yourself and who you are you are the
[29:53] purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[29:55] Christ so when Jesus would take an
[29:57] evaluation on his life and his own blood
[30:00] he said that we were worth it so how how
[30:03] humble it makes me to stand before the
[30:05] purchase of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[30:07] Christ that's how much he thinks about
[30:09] you you know what makes me want to be
[30:11] more sincere and and you know I was just
[30:13] driving down the road and then and I was
[30:15] uh I had I thought I knew what I was
[30:17] going to preach and when me and brother
[30:18] Solomon were pulling in the Lord just
[30:20] kind of changed directions on me so uh
[30:23] yeah I kind of feel like you you
[30:24] probably know as much as I know what's
[30:26] going to get preached tonight but but
[30:28] we're just going to trust in the Lord
[30:29] you know I've learned one thing if you
[30:31] can just get out of the way and let the
[30:33] Lord speak there's something for the
[30:35] people to hear is that right if you have
[30:37] your Bibles tonight uh we're gonna if
[30:39] you can turn to Romans 8 28 a very uh
[30:42] familiar scripture and
[30:44] and um
[30:46] I think I want to uh title this
[30:48] unseparable love and we'll read that as
[30:51] well but and I have another title for it
[30:53] too is God will get to you and uh but
[30:57] let's uh let's look at this here in
[30:58] Romans 8 28 and we're just trusting the
[31:01] Lord you know me and brother Solomon
[31:02] we're uh we're real good buddies we're
[31:04] always picking on each other going back
[31:06] and forth and and everything and you
[31:08] know we we talk about you know the the
[31:11] it's great when you find the Lord
[31:13] Brother Ben but when you miss the Lord
[31:14] it really hurts I'm sure over yeah I
[31:17] think he's been preaching since he was
[31:18] 12 years old so he knows what I'm
[31:19] talking about when you when you think
[31:21] you just want to preach what you want to
[31:23] preach and and what you think would go
[31:24] well but the Lord ain't in it you want
[31:26] to find the biggest rock that you can
[31:27] crawl up under and and never come back
[31:29] out of and you know but but we know if
[31:31] we trust the Lord then he can speak to
[31:33] our hearts and and that's what we want
[31:35] because you didn't you didn't want Seth
[31:37] coffee to come speak to you tonight and
[31:39] I didn't either but we want the Lord
[31:40] Jesus to speak tonight so Romans 8 28
[31:42] and it says we know that all things
[31:44] somebody say all things
[31:46] work together for good to them that love
[31:49] God do you love God tonight I believe
[31:51] you do because you're here to them who
[31:53] are called according to his purpose amen
[31:57] so let's drop down to 35 there and it
[31:59] said who shall separate us from the love
[32:02] of God shall tribulation or distress or
[32:05] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[32:07] Peril or sword as it is written for thy
[32:09] sake we are killed all the day long we
[32:12] are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[32:13] nay and all these things we are more
[32:17] than conquerors through him that loved
[32:20] us okay so it's about his love towards
[32:23] us tonight it says Ryan persuade that
[32:25] neither death
[32:26] nor life nor angels nor principalities
[32:31] nor powers nor things present nor things
[32:34] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[32:38] other creature shall be able doesn't say
[32:41] that it won't try church but it says
[32:43] it's other creatures shall be able to
[32:47] separate us from the love of God which
[32:50] is in Christ Jesus our lord and then you
[32:53] know this you don't have to turn here
[32:55] but in John 6 it says all that the
[32:57] father hath given me shall come to me
[32:59] see church this ain't a maybe this ain't
[33:02] it might be but he says all that the
[33:04] father giveth me shall come to me and
[33:08] him that cometh me I will in otherwise
[33:10] cast out how many is thankful to know
[33:12] tonight there's a lot of people that you
[33:14] might turn to and they might not want
[33:16] you but Jesus said I'm not going to cast
[33:18] you out I'm not going to turn you down
[33:20] but he said before I came from Heaven
[33:21] not to do my own will but to do the will
[33:23] of him that sent me and this is my
[33:26] father's will when just sent me that all
[33:28] which he has given me I should lose
[33:30] nothing he won't lose a one it's an
[33:33] unseparable love he he can't do without
[33:36] you yeah glory amen
[33:38] amen but should raise it up again in the
[33:40] last days amen you may be seated if we
[33:43] could pray one more time Heavenly Father
[33:44] Lord we just want to say thank you Lord
[33:46] for this word Lord that we've read Lord
[33:48] surely Lord we could close just now Lord
[33:51] saying father knowing that the love of
[33:53] God and how it's unseparable Lord and
[33:55] how you care for us Lord God and no
[33:58] matter what we're going through Lord
[33:59] distress Peril whatever it might be Lord
[34:01] there's nothing in life there's nothing
[34:03] in death that could separate us from
[34:05] your love Lord and we thank you for that
[34:07] father we just pray that you would bless
[34:08] the service Lord get each and every one
[34:10] out of the way now father in Jesus name
[34:12] amen well I just want to say thank you
[34:15] uh uh to brother Alan and brother
[34:17] Stewart for uh taking me uh taking me
[34:20] and brother Solomon out hunting and you
[34:21] know we there was just something special
[34:24] about being out there in in the woods I
[34:26] tell you you when you get up there in
[34:28] the woods and you get away from the
[34:30] world I believe you get closer to God I
[34:31] believe that's why the the prophet
[34:33] always took time to go out there and do
[34:35] those things but you know one thing that
[34:37] just struck my heart there was a couple
[34:38] little things that happen out there that
[34:40] that really meant a lot to me and you
[34:42] know God cares about the little things
[34:44] God cares about the things that we're
[34:45] going through and and you know we we
[34:47] went out here and and I felt a pull in
[34:50] my heart to come out this way and
[34:52] anytime I feel a pull in my heart to
[34:53] come out this way I try to spend some
[34:55] time with family while I'm out here and
[34:57] we went out there and went uh went a
[34:59] turkey hunting and and you know there
[35:01] was just something that struck my heart
[35:02] when we were we woke up the second
[35:04] morning to to go out and hunt and I was
[35:06] sitting there thinking you know Lord
[35:08] just pressed on my heart and before we
[35:10] ever left the camp he said why don't you
[35:12] pray why don't you talk to me before
[35:13] before y'all ever just start your day
[35:15] out why don't you just pray a little bit
[35:16] and you know I said Brothers do you mind
[35:19] if we pray and you know absolutely so we
[35:21] get together and we begin to pray and
[35:23] you know as I'm praying you know the
[35:25] Lord presses something on my heart he
[35:27] said well why don't you just ask me for
[35:28] what you want ask me for what you and I
[35:31] said well Lord we would you know we
[35:32] would love to get a couple turkeys and
[35:34] then you know from what I understand
[35:35] getting a a public land anything is a
[35:38] very very challenging task because
[35:39] anybody can go do it you don't have your
[35:41] own private land or anything like that
[35:44] so anybody can come and do it and I said
[35:45] Lord would you just bless us Lord let us
[35:48] be successful in our hunt this morning
[35:49] Lord and give us some turkeys and you
[35:51] know we woke up that morning and Alan
[35:53] and and Solomon go walk in one way and
[35:56] me and Stuart go walking another way and
[35:58] and and we're we're all uh he's going to
[36:00] make fun of me because he's going to say
[36:02] he did the walk and me and Stuart just
[36:03] drove somewhere but but we me and Stuart
[36:06] we went and we drove to a place and got
[36:07] out and started to walk and Solomon and
[36:09] Alan walked six miles down into a hill
[36:11] somewhere I don't know where they end up
[36:12] going but you know we said that prayer
[36:14] before we departed and and you know I'm
[36:16] sitting there me and Stuart walking
[36:18] through the woods and I hear this turkey
[36:19] gobble off way off in the distance and
[36:21] then I hear this turkey gobble right in
[36:23] front of me I'm going oh my you know
[36:25] this is getting excited and we go out
[36:27] there and we're sitting there and and
[36:29] and you know as I'm sitting there I'm
[36:31] thinking man one of us might actually
[36:33] get a turkey today that's awesome and
[36:34] I'm sitting there and this turkey's
[36:37] coming in and and uh he's coming in to
[36:39] us and you know he gets on some other
[36:41] side of logs and he stands 25 yards from
[36:43] us on the other side of some logs and I
[36:44] can't see him for nothing and I'm
[36:46] sitting here going man I'd really like
[36:47] to get this turkey and about that time I
[36:49] hear a fake gunshot shot off in the
[36:51] distance and and I'm sitting there going
[36:52] man I wonder if that's Allen in them I
[36:54] you know just you just don't expect it
[36:56] because you're on public land and we end
[36:58] up shooting that bird and I'm sitting
[37:00] there and I'm giving thanks to God going
[37:01] God you didn't have to do that you you
[37:04] really answered our prayer there just by
[37:05] even giving us game out here you didn't
[37:07] have to do that and then as I'm as I say
[37:09] I say Lord you know bless Alan and
[37:12] Solomon let them get a bird too then I
[37:13] get a text on my phone and within 20
[37:16] minutes within 30 min probably 35
[37:18] minutes of that prayer maybe 45 minutes
[37:20] of that prayer of us walking out of
[37:22] there we both had her two turkeys on the
[37:24] ground and I was sitting there thinking
[37:26] God you're so mindful of our needs and
[37:29] just you know I think so many times God
[37:31] is just saying just ask me whatever you
[37:34] have need of just to ask me and I'm
[37:36] there for you know another thing that
[37:37] happened was I was going to study for
[37:39] this out there and and I was these guys
[37:41] went off to just go doing a little bit
[37:43] more walking and and uh and I stayed
[37:46] back at camp and I was going to study a
[37:47] little bit while I was there and and
[37:49] something said go pray up on that hill
[37:51] and I was like well all right you know
[37:53] and as I'm beginning you know I'm just
[37:55] feeling so pressed to go and begin to
[37:57] pray over a need and I don't even know
[37:59] what the need is and I began to walk
[38:02] towards that mountain and a brother that
[38:04] I don't know how he got my phone number
[38:06] I I I've never had him in my phone he
[38:09] calls me and he says Hey I just want you
[38:11] to know go pray for so and so
[38:13] and I'm sitting there thinking how
[38:15] marvelous is God that that you know it's
[38:18] the things that God is always in control
[38:21] that that here's a man in the middle of
[38:23] Arkansas in the middle of a national
[38:25] forest from what I understand as a
[38:26] hundred thousand acres and the God says
[38:28] go pray on that hill and I'm sitting
[38:30] there going I don't know what I'm going
[38:31] to pray about but I'll pray so God gives
[38:34] a prayer request he's working on one end
[38:36] to another and God sends a prayer
[38:38] request for a brother that's going on a
[38:40] hill to pray and I think it's a
[38:42] marvelous how mindful that God is and
[38:44] I've thoroughly enjoyed myself but you
[38:46] know when I when I begin to think of
[38:47] that unseparable love of God and and I
[38:50] was telling brother Solomon as we
[38:51] climbed up on the top of this mountain
[38:53] and and you know we were up there on the
[38:55] the first day and and we were we climb
[38:58] up on this mountain I believe it's the
[38:59] the big big river of Buffalo or whatever
[39:02] it is and it was going through there and
[39:04] I'm sitting there going Ma this is one
[39:05] of the most beautiful views that I've
[39:07] ever seen and I began to sit there and
[39:09] I'm looking at a cross and I go God I
[39:12] don't know how this could get any more
[39:13] beautiful and I'm sitting there thinking
[39:15] how marvelous her God is and how
[39:17] wonderful he is and then and then as I'm
[39:20] looking at I'm going God how can this
[39:21] get any more beautiful about that time
[39:23] an eagle begins to fly up the creek all
[39:25] coming up to me and I'm sitting there
[39:27] going I said to Alan y'all got Eagles
[39:28] out here y'all have Eagles out here he
[39:31] said yeah we got Eagles wow sick as I'm
[39:32] looking right at one man we don't have
[39:35] those back home like y'all got them here
[39:36] and and it's flying up to me and I'm
[39:38] sitting there thinking like I'm just I
[39:40] got there at this point at this time and
[39:42] God's just wanting to say I love your
[39:43] son and I see that eagle come up in
[39:46] perch right there and these guys don't
[39:47] understand it but I've been you know
[39:49] talking to God communion back and forth
[39:50] I told him I said I'm about to cry right
[39:51] here boys and they said I mean you
[39:53] probably look at me a big or
[39:55] whatever but but I began to think of
[39:56] that and begin to look at at all that
[39:59] God had created you know I was looking
[40:01] at all that and we were having fun
[40:03] hunting but when I got away to myself
[40:04] and and I began to look around at
[40:07] everything and I begin to think oh God
[40:09] how how marvelous you are and how
[40:12] wonderful you are and how great you are
[40:15] God that you created all this but then
[40:18] something spoke to my heart he said but
[40:19] I didn't want it without you you realize
[40:22] God could have it all but he didn't want
[40:24] to have it unless he had us with it I'm
[40:27] beginning to think glory to God how how
[40:29] can I look at this wonderful mountain
[40:31] and I can look at this this beautiful
[40:33] view in this eagle flying but we look at
[40:36] that and we begin to think how wonderful
[40:39] how beautiful how marvelous but you see
[40:41] God's not even looking at that and
[40:44] thinking those things but he's looking
[40:46] at us
[40:48] and he's going how beautiful how
[40:51] marvelous how wonderful is my bride
[40:54] and it seems we take it for granted so
[40:56] much but but I want to say this there's
[41:00] not a place you can be that the love of
[41:03] God will not be able to reach you that's
[41:05] right
[41:06] you know I begin to think about that out
[41:08] of the love of God you know when you're
[41:10] really in love with somebody and I have
[41:12] a wife and two beautiful children and
[41:14] you know as much as I love to be here
[41:17] with you there's something that's been
[41:18] on my mind the whole time
[41:20] there's something that's been on my mind
[41:22] in my heart the whole time I want to get
[41:24] back to my loving wife I want to get
[41:27] back to my beautiful children I can't
[41:29] help it why because they're a part of me
[41:31] there's something there that that I have
[41:34] to get back to them and you know even
[41:36] though we're miles apart today there's
[41:38] an unseverable love on the inside of me
[41:41] that no matter what the distance no
[41:44] matter where I am or where they are or
[41:46] where they might be right now or what
[41:49] they're even doing right now there is a
[41:51] love in my heart that still beats for
[41:53] them
[41:54] and you know I began to think of that
[41:56] you know I I remember when my daughter
[41:58] was born and and I held her in my arms
[42:01] for the first time and and even though
[42:03] there was a love that came over me that
[42:04] I could not explain
[42:06] there was something that came over me
[42:08] that that there was such a love that
[42:10] developed inside of my heart as soon as
[42:12] my daughter was born it was so
[42:14] instinctive that I never really I never
[42:17] you know she never did anything for me
[42:19] she never she never she never had to do
[42:22] anything for me she was a part of me and
[42:25] I remember the first time I held her in
[42:27] my arms I looked at her and I said Jolie
[42:30] no matter what you ever do I will always
[42:34] love you I could not help but love her
[42:37] and you know I pray to God that that God
[42:39] will keep her and and she'll live the
[42:42] most holy Christian Life that there ever
[42:44] will be on the face of this Earth
[42:46] that'll put my life to shame and
[42:48] everybody else's life to shame but I'll
[42:51] tell you this and God forbid that it
[42:53] ever happened just laying something out
[42:56] there but if she ever did go into
[42:58] something if she ever ran off into
[43:00] something and did something that she
[43:02] wasn't supposed to do let me tell you
[43:04] wherever she is and wherever ever she
[43:07] does I will always still love that
[43:10] little girl you know why because she's
[43:12] my daughter and tonight you need to know
[43:15] that you're the Sons and Daughters of
[43:17] the most high God and wherever you are
[43:20] let me tell you something I don't know
[43:21] how my daughter's feeling right now she
[43:24] might not be feeling the best she might
[43:25] be sad but guess what that doesn't
[43:27] change the fact that right here in
[43:30] Arkansas there is a man there is a
[43:33] father that loves her right now and
[43:36] wherever you are right now whatever
[43:39] you're going through no matter how
[43:41] you're feeling no matter how situations
[43:44] have played out there's a man right now
[43:48] right here that cares for you
[43:52] and his name is Jesus Christ you say
[43:55] well I've done a lot of things wrong and
[43:57] I've done a lot of things that I
[43:58] shouldn't have done what shall be able
[44:01] to separate you from the love of God I'm
[44:04] going through a lot right now I've got a
[44:06] lot of problems but you see it's still
[44:08] not able
[44:11] you realize what Satan is always trying
[44:13] to do to you is to get you to doubt
[44:16] yourself to degrade your value to make
[44:19] you think you're not good enough but as
[44:21] I told you you're not just anybody but
[44:24] you are the purchase of the blood of the
[44:27] Lord Jesus Christ God cared more about
[44:30] you
[44:33] he cared more about you than every strap
[44:36] on his back
[44:37] he cared about you more than anything a
[44:41] Roman soldier could say about him
[44:46] he cared about you more than carrying
[44:48] that cross he cared more about you than
[44:51] being nailed to that cross
[44:54] but you see Satan would like to tell you
[44:55] you're nothing God doesn't care about
[44:58] you he's not concerned with the things
[45:00] that you're going through listen church
[45:02] God is always concerned
[45:04] do you realize that one time that you
[45:07] say well I'm not sure if he's just
[45:08] concerned about my situation let me tell
[45:10] you because you go I'm one person
[45:13] do you realize what God will do for one
[45:15] person do you realize one time he was
[45:17] having a meeting with five thousand men
[45:21] not counting the children was having the
[45:23] greatest Revival service this world has
[45:25] ever seen some little boy brought him
[45:28] some Loaves and fish and next thing you
[45:29] know he's feeding 5 000 men
[45:33] not counting the families not counting
[45:35] the children he's sitting there feeding
[45:37] everybody but you know what the whole
[45:39] time this is going on in the back part
[45:42] of his mind he can I gotta let this go
[45:45] this preacher restrictor here but but do
[45:47] the whole time that he's there there's
[45:50] one on his mind yes sir somebody's
[45:54] coming up and saying brother Jesus
[45:57] that is the most fabulous service I have
[46:00] ever heard
[46:02] now I don't think I'm taking away deity
[46:03] out of Jesus Christ I'm just saying
[46:05] somebody might not known who he was yet
[46:08] but they're sitting there saying Master
[46:10] what a wonderful service yeah you've
[46:12] done this and that and he wasn't going
[46:14] man that was a pretty good service but
[46:15] the whole time he's got one in his mind
[46:19] even though this person just seen a
[46:21] miracle and this person just seen this
[46:22] we don't know what happened there that
[46:24] day all we know is that he he he turned
[46:28] some some fish and and some loaves into
[46:30] a into an all-night you could eat it all
[46:33] you want by favor that's all we know but
[46:36] we don't know how many people got healed
[46:37] there
[46:38] just because it wasn't wrote down don't
[46:39] mean it didn't happen and I'm not saying
[46:41] it did or it didn't but you got to think
[46:43] about this and they weren't going he
[46:45] well you know somebody might have walked
[46:46] by and said man my leg was just healed I
[46:48] have had a a a weird walk my whole life
[46:51] but God that that I'm the master just
[46:53] healed me right there but the whole time
[46:56] in the back side of his mind he goes
[46:59] there's one that I need to get to
[47:02] right go ahead
[47:05] he crossed the sea and the disciples
[47:08] have been very weary
[47:11] he had stilled the sea for them crossed
[47:14] all the way over where there was a
[47:17] maniac
[47:19] whether it was a maniac
[47:22] God's leaving a Revival to get to
[47:24] somebody that we wouldn't hardly even
[47:25] let in the church
[47:28] God's leaving a Revival to get to
[47:31] somebody that's messed our life up
[47:32] Beyond repair
[47:37] well there was a maniac taking a chance
[47:39] of crossing the stormy sea when the
[47:42] Devils of the sea swore they would drown
[47:44] him that night but he went over there at
[47:47] the Cry of one person and if I could add
[47:51] another title tonight one person is
[47:53] valuable
[47:54] one person is valuable you see what God
[47:57] is doing in the churches you see what
[47:59] God is doing for this one and what that
[48:01] one and sometimes we begin to get this
[48:02] thought God have you forgot about me no
[48:04] God has not forgot about you God's
[48:07] thinking about you during the Revival
[48:08] meeting God's thinking about what you're
[48:10] going through
[48:12] but he wanted to cry for one person War
[48:15] One poor Maniac lost his mind perhaps a
[48:18] good man one time walked up right before
[48:21] God but probably got in the wrong crowd
[48:23] maybe maybe he started drinking or
[48:25] something lost his mind he lived out in
[48:27] the tombs where the demons lived put him
[48:29] in Chains and he had Supernatural Powers
[48:31] he would break those chains jump on men
[48:34] and beat them up and kill them if he
[48:36] could when they come by and the poor
[48:38] fellow maybe he had an old gray-headed
[48:40] mother somewhere praying for him Jesus
[48:43] crossed the sea all the way over to give
[48:47] Mercy to one man I want to say this
[48:51] tonight it doesn't matter where you are
[48:54] Jesus will get to you it doesn't matter
[48:57] what you're going through Jesus will get
[49:00] to you
[49:02] when I was coming down the road right
[49:04] here and had to make the final left turn
[49:05] he said to me say it God will get to you
[49:09] and I don't know who it's for tonight
[49:11] but God will get to you
[49:14] wherever you are whatever you're going
[49:17] through you might feel like that Maniac
[49:19] you might have picked up a lot of things
[49:20] you shouldn't have picked up
[49:23] right
[49:24] you might have a lot of chains that have
[49:26] you bound yeah you might have picked up
[49:28] that Spirit of cutting yourself you
[49:31] might have done a lot of things that you
[49:33] thought in your life you would never do
[49:35] you looked around as a young Christian
[49:37] and you said I'll never get to that
[49:39] point I'll never do those things
[49:42] you fall into something and
[49:45] it keeps worn on your mind you did that
[49:48] now you can never be saved
[49:50] you did that you've made too many
[49:52] mistakes young people you failed too
[49:54] many times and God will never love you
[49:57] again but I'm here to tell you what can
[49:59] separate you from the love of God what
[50:04] can separate you
[50:05] can the problems at work no sir can the
[50:09] family problems no sir
[50:12] you said but I've made so many mistakes
[50:14] let me tell you something
[50:17] as long as in your God didn't love you
[50:20] because you were perfect
[50:22] God loved you because he's making you
[50:24] perfect
[50:25] he's all listen
[50:28] if God
[50:30] I'm just going to say it as plain as I
[50:31] can brother if if it will why was there
[50:34] a Calvary
[50:37] because God already knew you wouldn't be
[50:40] good enough
[50:43] God already knew you were going to make
[50:45] mistakes
[50:46] that's why he came in Perfection and
[50:50] died in the place for you
[50:52] so that you don't look at yourself no
[50:55] more
[50:55] I'm not resting in me I'm resting in him
[51:00] I know this is going to be broke up but
[51:02] you I'm just going to obey the will of
[51:04] the Lord
[51:07] he do he said I'm going to read that
[51:09] again but the cry but he went over there
[51:11] at the Cry of one person one poor Maniac
[51:15] lost his mind perhaps a good man one
[51:18] time walked up right before God but
[51:20] probably gotten the wrong crowd might be
[51:22] started drinking or something lost his
[51:24] mind and he lived out in the tombs where
[51:26] the demons lived put in Chains and he
[51:29] had Supernatural Powers he would break
[51:31] those chains and jump on men and beat
[51:33] them and kill them if he could when they
[51:35] come by this ain't the kind of person
[51:36] I'm gonna have on my heart and have on
[51:38] my mind
[51:40] but that's the kind of Jesus we serve
[51:43] that's the kind of God we serve see God
[51:45] wasn't looking at the problem God was
[51:46] looking at the man God wasn't looking at
[51:49] his mistakes God was looking at his
[51:50] heart God was looking
[51:53] you know what's a shame that in this
[51:55] Bible I don't want to say it that way
[51:57] because uh you understand what I'm
[51:59] saying when I say this I say it's a
[52:01] shame that that when the disciples would
[52:04] write they would call them Legion
[52:07] they would call them a maniac
[52:09] he wasn't a legion of devils he wasn't a
[52:12] maniac he was a son of God
[52:16] you see that even in the the oh even
[52:19] when when they would begin to write in
[52:21] the scriptures they couldn't even see
[52:23] that that was a Son of God but Jesus did
[52:25] and many times we look at people and we
[52:28] see mistakes in their lives and
[52:30] different things and we don't understand
[52:32] and we'll write them as just some thief
[52:36] or a murderer or or all these different
[52:39] things but God says that's a son that's
[52:42] a daughter
[52:46] and that poor fellow maybe had an old
[52:48] gray-headed mother somewhere praying for
[52:49] him Jesus crossed the sea all the way to
[52:52] give Mercy to one man but listen church
[52:54] this is what should excite you he said
[52:57] he do the same tonight yes where one
[53:00] humble soul is calling to him he crossed
[53:03] Seas or leave the Heavens to answer that
[53:06] prayer it's the same Jesus yesterday
[53:09] today and forever
[53:12] right do you realize we have a Bible
[53:14] today because people were in situations
[53:16] that looked hopeless
[53:18] do you realize in almost every single
[53:21] text that we draw out of the Bible is
[53:23] somebody that's in trouble that God
[53:25] brings them out of that trouble do you
[53:27] realize that today every single sermon
[53:31] that we preach
[53:36] is because somebody needed help
[53:39] so why do you think God couldn't help
[53:41] you
[53:44] why do you think you're beyond
[53:46] Redemption
[53:48] why do you think God can't help you you
[53:50] ain't got no problem saying God can help
[53:52] Seth's need
[53:54] we ain't got no problem saying God can
[53:56] help brother Ben's need
[53:58] we ain't got no problem saying God can
[54:00] can get to brother Solomon but what
[54:03] about you
[54:05] why is it so hard
[54:07] to understand that the one that created
[54:10] the heavens and the Earth his hand Ain't
[54:11] Too Short
[54:12] why is it so hard to understand that no
[54:15] matter where you are God can get to you
[54:18] right
[54:20] you say well I feel worthless you know I
[54:22] bet Rahab felt worthless one time
[54:24] more she did
[54:26] why would anybody want me
[54:30] why would anybody care for me Rahab the
[54:33] prostitute
[54:35] Rahab the prostitute
[54:38] not only that is she a prostitute but
[54:40] she's walled in by all of her problems
[54:43] in a city called Jericho
[54:46] and everywhere she walks in the street
[54:48] people are belittling her making fun of
[54:50] her put her down call her names do this
[54:53] to her do that to her
[54:55] yes sir that's right she's even given
[54:58] herself away throwing herself away
[55:01] but in her heart there's a desire I
[55:03] never wanted to be this way
[55:05] don't you ever judge someone's situation
[55:07] until you know what they've been through
[55:11] the Branham goes in and says you know
[55:13] that little girl
[55:15] maybe she had some parents
[55:17] that cast her out
[55:19] on the street at a young age she got
[55:22] into some stuff that she wasn't supposed
[55:23] to and it was the only way that she knew
[55:25] how to live
[55:27] she thought this is who I am because
[55:28] somebody told her that's who she was
[55:31] she began to listen All the Other Voices
[55:33] that said you're no good
[55:35] you'll never be you will never get out
[55:37] of this Jericho
[55:39] you will never get out of this no one
[55:42] can get to you here
[55:44] no one can help you here
[55:48] imagine her own little mind she goes why
[55:50] would anybody want me
[55:52] why would anyone even care for me
[55:55] then here comes some spies in there
[55:59] and she begins to see in her heart hey
[56:01] I'm nobody
[56:03] but if I could just help them out
[56:08] she begins to try to do the right thing
[56:09] for them
[56:10] and you know the story about how
[56:14] and you know it doesn't even make sense
[56:16] can you imagine her at that time they
[56:18] say just take a Scarlet rope
[56:22] tied together
[56:25] yeah throw it out the window
[56:27] and many times we think
[56:29] we need the greatest evangelist
[56:33] we need the greatest preacher we need to
[56:35] pray all night long
[56:38] we need something Supernatural to come
[56:42] and a man in the way of a vision or a
[56:45] prophecy or
[56:46] something else in God's hand just cast
[56:48] all your cares
[56:50] on me
[56:53] she
[56:54] I can imagine she's sitting there and
[56:56] everybody's going why are you tying all
[56:58] that together
[56:59] why are you doing all that why
[57:02] because I'm you know sometimes in this
[57:04] carnal mind the word don't make sense in
[57:05] the carnal mind
[57:07] I don't understand how I come let's just
[57:09] be honest I don't care I don't
[57:11] understand how I come to this building
[57:13] and I began to sing some songs and I and
[57:16] in my flesh I hear somebody preach this
[57:18] gospel
[57:19] and even though I felt like a loser
[57:21] maybe when I came in when I walk out I
[57:23] feel charged
[57:25] I don't understand how that happens up
[57:28] here but down here something's going on
[57:29] yeah
[57:30] and she began there's something going on
[57:32] down here in rahab's heart
[57:34] and she and the devil's saying you're
[57:36] worthless you're you're no good look at
[57:38] the mistakes you've made look at the
[57:40] things you've done look how far you've
[57:42] got from God but she's still just
[57:46] lying ready to throw out that window
[57:50] and when she does that
[57:52] even though the Judgment strikes around
[57:54] you know what she she she's realizing
[57:56] her a moment that she's in this place
[57:59] and she's thinking nobody cares about me
[58:02] nobody loves me I'm
[58:15] worthless I'm good for nothing why would
[58:17] anybody even want me yeah
[58:20] yeah there's a
[58:24] God you realize there was a captain that
[58:28] met Joshua out there and he was eyeing
[58:30] that one building where Rahab was in
[58:32] that house right there and he was
[58:34] thinking that's rahab's house
[58:36] that's a daughter of God in there
[58:39] there's a dollar in there and you know
[58:41] even though nobody else could get to her
[58:44] even though everybody else was blocked
[58:47] on the outside God would send somebody
[58:50] in there just to get her
[58:53] just as Savior see the world didn't care
[58:56] about her right the people of Jericho
[58:58] didn't care about her but there was a
[59:00] god of Israel
[59:04] there was a God that before the
[59:06] foundation of the world he was thinking
[59:09] about Rahab
[59:12] all glory well no one else would give
[59:15] her the time of day
[59:17] sitting there why what could separate me
[59:20] from the love that I have for Rahab
[59:23] could Jericho
[59:25] could the men of the city
[59:28] could the soldiers could the Chariots
[59:30] that run around the walls could all the
[59:33] false idols
[59:34] separate Rahab from my love
[59:37] he's going no
[59:40] as I told you
[59:42] there's a little family back home I'm
[59:44] thinking about
[59:45] and God's going there's a little woman
[59:47] in there that I'm thinking about
[59:49] and he sends the invitation right to our
[59:51] house and she throws down that skull oh
[59:55] Hallelujah
[59:57] you gotta realize you might not
[59:58] understand how God's gonna do it come on
[1:00:01] you gotta realize you don't have to
[1:00:03] understand how God's math adds up but
[1:00:06] when he tells you believe just believe
[1:00:09] only believe all things are possible
[1:00:13] they say why are you throwing that out
[1:00:14] the window I don't really know he just
[1:00:17] told me to
[1:00:19] [Music]
[1:00:22] I don't really know
[1:00:25] they told me to
[1:00:27] throw it out the window
[1:00:30] sitting there she's looking at all of
[1:00:32] Jericho everything that hates her
[1:00:35] everything that's bound of how she would
[1:00:37] love to break out of those things how
[1:00:39] there's people can I say this today
[1:00:41] there's people trapped in their own
[1:00:43] jerichos inside of their minds
[1:00:47] Satan sit there inside of your head
[1:00:49] saying you're not good enough you'll
[1:00:50] never be good enough God doesn't love
[1:00:52] you God doesn't want you the spirit of
[1:00:54] God has left you God don't care about
[1:00:55] you God won't fellowship with you the
[1:00:57] way he used to you can never have that
[1:01:00] back
[1:01:01] but God's going what can separate you
[1:01:04] from my love what can separate you from
[1:01:07] my love what can nothing can separate
[1:01:10] you from this love
[1:01:12] and everything she even gets to look
[1:01:14] around and looking around at everything
[1:01:17] and though she feels trapped inside of
[1:01:21] that place inside of that Jericho she
[1:01:25] followed the word of the Lord and listen
[1:01:28] you might be in a Jericho but God will
[1:01:31] get to you
[1:01:36] one day listen you say I didn't get my
[1:01:39] Deliverance on the first day when they
[1:01:42] started walking around that Jericho
[1:01:43] don't you worry about it yeah
[1:01:46] God makes all things beautiful in his
[1:01:50] time
[1:01:54] it looked like a Harley what was a
[1:01:56] harlot but not in the eyes of God
[1:01:58] they begin to walk around on the first
[1:02:00] day nothing happened second day nothing
[1:02:02] happened and she's sitting there going
[1:02:03] and her mind she's having mind battles
[1:02:05] that I make a mistake should I really
[1:02:08] have followed the message it seems like
[1:02:10] it just keeps going on and on day after
[1:02:12] day and they keep going around that
[1:02:15] Jericho day after day but on the seventh
[1:02:17] day she is a trumpet
[1:02:21] she hears a message come through Rahab
[1:02:24] she hears something come through I said
[1:02:27] you were never a daughter of Jericho in
[1:02:30] the first place
[1:02:32] that's not who you are Ahab
[1:02:36] you're not who they told you you were
[1:02:40] see here's a trumpet she sees the far
[1:02:43] Corner go down she sees another house go
[1:02:46] down she sees another house go down she
[1:02:50] sees a wall ball she sees problems over
[1:02:52] your fall she sees the things that are
[1:02:55] bound behind her Begin to Fall yeah
[1:02:58] everything's fallen and Satan says
[1:03:01] you're next
[1:03:03] you're next I told you if you gave your
[1:03:06] heart to the Lord you were just going to
[1:03:08] follow your face and not be anything
[1:03:12] and everything around her is falling
[1:03:14] down can you imagine
[1:03:17] you imagine the people on the outside of
[1:03:19] Jericho that day they looked and they
[1:03:21] said why is that one outstanding
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:27] because let me tell you Jericho couldn't
[1:03:30] separate
[1:03:32] the love that God had for Rahab
[1:03:36] and no matter what you're going through
[1:03:40] Jericho didn't change
[1:03:43] I don't know why I can't get off Rahab
[1:03:46] I don't know why I can't get off this
[1:03:47] story
[1:03:50] maybe we need some jerichos to come down
[1:03:52] tonight
[1:03:55] I've got plenty of other stuff to listen
[1:03:59] you feel trapped in that mine
[1:04:01] sit there and Satan's constantly
[1:04:03] battling you
[1:04:05] past mistakes
[1:04:08] different things you've done wrong in
[1:04:10] your life
[1:04:11] now if you could just go back as in and
[1:04:14] fix it like it never happened in the
[1:04:16] first place
[1:04:18] but let me tell you what
[1:04:20] can I invite you to do it
[1:04:22] you say what do you mean because let me
[1:04:23] tell you something
[1:04:25] when you take that
[1:04:27] and you put that under that blood of the
[1:04:29] Lord Jesus Christ it don't just cover it
[1:04:32] up for a season it don't just hide it
[1:04:36] brother Branham said it's like that
[1:04:38] bleach
[1:04:39] you can come before the father you can
[1:04:42] give them for him and say father I've
[1:04:44] made mistakes
[1:04:46] I've let Jericho's build up in my life
[1:04:50] I've done things I never should have
[1:04:52] done God
[1:04:55] you can come to it
[1:04:58] and he'll take that pen from his side
[1:05:01] it was Solomon said and he'll write on
[1:05:03] their pardon
[1:05:05] yeah
[1:05:07] he can take every single one of those
[1:05:09] problems every single one of those
[1:05:10] mistakes every single one of those
[1:05:12] Chance cast in The Sea of God's Great
[1:05:14] forgiveness as far as the East is from
[1:05:17] the West never to be found anymore
[1:05:19] Hallelujah people can say I don't doubt
[1:05:22] people kept talking about Rahab but you
[1:05:25] know the beautiful thing about Rahab
[1:05:26] Rahab thought she was worthless rayab
[1:05:28] thought she was no good but God used the
[1:05:31] very vessel of Rahab to be the lineage
[1:05:35] of Jesus Christ
[1:05:39] the very lineage of Jesus Christ came
[1:05:43] through somebody that thought they were
[1:05:45] no good that they were an outcast
[1:05:47] because it couldn't separate the love of
[1:05:49] God
[1:05:53] will get to you wherever you are
[1:05:56] Brandon tells a story of blind
[1:05:57] Bartimaeus
[1:05:59] old church
[1:06:01] I began to think of blind Bartimaeus
[1:06:03] because I feel like we've all felt like
[1:06:04] blind Bartimaeus before
[1:06:07] get to a point
[1:06:09] you know what I realized about blind bar
[1:06:11] to Vegas blind Bartimaeus couldn't get
[1:06:12] to Jesus
[1:06:17] find barimaeus couldn't go by Samaria
[1:06:19] when he was visiting the well
[1:06:22] fine Bartimaeus couldn't go to the pool
[1:06:24] of Bethesda that day yeah
[1:06:27] yeah fine Baltimore's can't do anything
[1:06:31] flying Bartimaeus needs someone to come
[1:06:33] to him
[1:06:35] that's right right that's true he can't
[1:06:37] just act like us and get in our car and
[1:06:40] drive to the nearest Revival to try to
[1:06:41] get the fill up
[1:06:43] he can't do like us and and go to the
[1:06:46] church somewhere and pray he is and gets
[1:06:49] listen he's a blind beggar nobody cares
[1:06:51] for him
[1:06:54] but it can't separate that love
[1:07:03] now Jesus was on his road to Calvary
[1:07:06] every Bible believer knows that
[1:07:09] and Jesus was God in flesh king of all
[1:07:12] Prophets
[1:07:13] and being with the spirit he knew that
[1:07:15] he was facing what he was facing that he
[1:07:18] must go to Jerusalem
[1:07:20] and suffer under the hands of wicked
[1:07:22] people
[1:07:23] and his own children crucify him
[1:07:26] and he must die at Gethsemane Gethsemane
[1:07:29] was facing him I can imagine him seeing
[1:07:32] his cool Stern face setting as a breeze
[1:07:35] come down walking ahead of the crowd
[1:07:37] like that going towards Calvary the way
[1:07:39] of the Redemption of the world

[1:07:59] rested on his shoulders and the sins of
[1:08:02] every Mortal die on the face of the
[1:08:05] Earth rested on his shoulders How
[1:08:09] concerned he walked he didn't hear the
[1:08:11] howling mob
[1:08:14] you realize he's on his way to die for
[1:08:17] the sins of the world
[1:08:20] he's got the most important mission that
[1:08:22] mankind has ever seen
[1:08:26] what a man needs somebody to get to
[1:08:33] him
[1:08:34] blind water Mayas need somebody to get
[1:08:36] to him because he can't get to God
[1:08:47] yeah it's good
[1:08:48] and the creator of the world is coming
[1:08:50] to save his people because of Seth
[1:08:52] coffee sins
[1:08:55] because of all our mistakes and all the
[1:08:57] things that we've done wrong
[1:09:00] But Blind barter mess has nobody to get
[1:09:02] to him
[1:09:06] well I thought Emmaus can't save himself
[1:09:11] God Bartimaeus doesn't even know hardly
[1:09:13] where he's at
[1:09:16] everybody looks at bloodborne Emmaus and
[1:09:19] he looks worthless to the world
[1:09:28] but it couldn't separate part of mans
[1:09:31] from love yes
[1:09:35] oh God
[1:09:36] what kind of Savior do we serve tonight
[1:09:38] yes
[1:09:41] How concerned he walked
[1:09:44] he didn't hear the howling mob some of
[1:09:45] them laughing making fun of him probably
[1:09:47] throwing rotten apples at him or
[1:09:49] something as he went along the others
[1:09:50] hollering Hosanna Hosanna what a mixed
[1:09:52] screaming multitude carrying how could
[1:09:55] he hear the poor beggar
[1:09:56] way out against the wall but he had
[1:09:59] Faith as he walked along he cried out
[1:10:01] thou son of David have mercy
[1:10:04] probably a hundred or more crying the
[1:10:06] same at the same time different things
[1:10:09] it wasn't I doubt Jesus even heard his
[1:10:13] voice
[1:10:13] oh Church you know we go back to that
[1:10:16] maniac
[1:10:17] sitting there crying in the Tomb he
[1:10:20] didn't hear it with the physical ear but
[1:10:22] there was a love on the inside of Jesus
[1:10:26] that could not be separated
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:31] the faith of that one man him in that
[1:10:33] condition he was poor Outcast blind a
[1:10:36] beggar stopped him in the middle of his
[1:10:38] robe the faith of one beggar stopped him
[1:10:43] all that facing him stopped
[1:10:48] he's got Gethsemane that he's walking in
[1:10:50] listen he's the lamb slain before the
[1:10:52] foundation of the world he already knows
[1:10:55] everything he's walking into
[1:10:58] but there's Bartimaeus
[1:11:00] he's got the weight of the world in his
[1:11:02] shoulders he's got to think about every
[1:11:04] beating he's going to get every time
[1:11:05] he's going to get spit in his faith he's
[1:11:07] got to think about how he he can't get
[1:11:09] off that cross he has to lay his life
[1:11:10] down as the lamb he has to be the
[1:11:12] perfect sacrifice but then something's
[1:11:14] pulling him
[1:11:16] it's a love
[1:11:18] God's got to get to him it's an
[1:11:20] unseparable love even though he's got
[1:11:22] something that's important he can't be
[1:11:25] separated
[1:11:30] he was poor Out cast blind Beggars top
[1:11:32] in the middle of the road faith of one
[1:11:34] beggar stopped him all that facing him
[1:11:35] stopped he looked around to see who it
[1:11:37] was he felt that tug of Faith pull him
[1:11:40] Hallelujah and he said he's the same
[1:11:42] tonight one person's faith in the
[1:11:45] building can turn him and stop the
[1:11:48] heavens
[1:11:51] see Satan is always trying to tell you
[1:11:54] that God doesn't care about you anymore
[1:11:58] when you have a need the love of God Is
[1:12:02] So constrained
[1:12:04] do you realize no one cared about
[1:12:07] Bartimaeus Allen nobody cared what he
[1:12:10] was going through nobody cared how he
[1:12:12] failed nobody cared
[1:12:16] he's blind and he's crawling through the
[1:12:18] street
[1:12:19] maybe the kids coming by making fun of
[1:12:21] him gig no one cared yeah
[1:12:27] but Jesus
[1:12:31] and this wasn't a leisurely day when
[1:12:33] Jesus didn't have nothing to do
[1:12:38] you sit there and you go I think God's
[1:12:39] just too busy for me
[1:12:41] I think God's got too much going on for
[1:12:44] my need brother Ben
[1:12:45] I think God has forgotten about what I'm
[1:12:48] going through I thank God just doesn't
[1:12:49] care God has not forgot about you
[1:12:53] whether you're back in a cave somewhere
[1:12:56] yeah
[1:12:57] whether you're in Jericho
[1:13:01] the love of God is still beating in his
[1:13:05] heartbeat
[1:13:06] is so strong that it can break down
[1:13:10] every wall and every barrier because
[1:13:13] he's already saying you're going I'm
[1:13:15] past Redemption I can't be saved I've
[1:13:17] done too much wrong but he's already
[1:13:19] saying I won't lose a one
[1:13:23] yes sir I can't lose you I won't lose
[1:13:27] you
[1:13:34] nobody cared about Bartimaeus
[1:13:38] Jesus did
[1:13:39] you say this is simple
[1:13:42] listen you say this is simple it's the
[1:13:44] most profound thing you ever heard you
[1:13:46] say how is that because you go through
[1:13:48] the same trials yeah
[1:13:49] you go through the same battle you say
[1:13:51] that's simple I always say if it's so
[1:13:52] simple simply accept it simply accept
[1:13:54] that you're a son and daughter of the
[1:13:56] most high God
[1:13:57] would you like to why don't you just
[1:13:59] accept it tonight stop you know what why
[1:14:01] is it so easy to accept everything that
[1:14:03] Satan says yeah
[1:14:06] why is it so easy to accept it when he
[1:14:09] says you're no good right why is it so
[1:14:11] easy to accept it when he says you'll
[1:14:13] never make it why is it so easy to
[1:14:15] accept it when he says you'll always be
[1:14:17] this way when he ain't never done
[1:14:19] nothing but lie kill steal destroy
[1:14:25] but God says I'm the resurrection I'm
[1:14:28] the truth
[1:14:29] I'm the life
[1:14:31] and he says you're a son he says you're
[1:14:33] the perfect sinless spotless bride but
[1:14:37] we don't want to accept it
[1:14:39] listen we can't look past ourselves and
[1:14:41] see the love
[1:14:44] we got to look past ourselves
[1:14:46] and see
[1:14:48] I'll read this and I come to a close as
[1:14:50] the musicians come back
[1:14:53] he makes it all beautiful in his time
[1:14:59] to everything there is a season
[1:15:01] and a time to every purpose so remember
[1:15:04] whatever you're going through there's a
[1:15:05] purpose
[1:15:06] to every purpose under the heaven a time
[1:15:09] to be born a time to die time to plant a
[1:15:11] time to pluck up
[1:15:14] which is plenty of time to kill a time
[1:15:16] to heal
[1:15:17] time to break down a time to build up a
[1:15:21] time to weep and a time to laugh a time
[1:15:24] to mourn a time to dance
[1:15:26] you see church but all this has a
[1:15:28] purpose
[1:15:30] a time to Cast Away stones and a time to
[1:15:32] gather Stones together a time to embrace
[1:15:34] a time to refrain from embracing
[1:15:37] a time to get and a time to lose a time
[1:15:39] to keep a time to Cast Away a time to
[1:15:43] run a time to sow
[1:15:45] a time to keep silence and a time to
[1:15:47] speak a time to love and a time to hate
[1:15:50] a time of war and a time of peace
[1:15:52] what prophets hath he that worketh and
[1:15:56] wherein he labereth I have seen the
[1:15:58] travail which God given to the sons of
[1:16:00] men to be exercised in it
[1:16:02] but he says he hath made everything
[1:16:05] beautiful
[1:16:08] in his time
[1:16:10] you see what that's saying wherever you
[1:16:12] identify in this season whatever season
[1:16:14] that you're in
[1:16:16] whatever season that you're going
[1:16:18] through
[1:16:19] you can sit there and say well I feel
[1:16:20] like God's A Million Miles Away
[1:16:23] but there's a purpose for it
[1:16:25] you say well I my family's out in the
[1:16:28] world and they're running around and
[1:16:30] they're doing stuff they ought not to be
[1:16:32] doing but don't worry use that see
[1:16:34] that's not the end
[1:16:39] going through a hardest time because I
[1:16:42] just lost a family member I don't
[1:16:44] understand this it was a time to die
[1:16:47] and it hurt
[1:16:51] you see all these seasons in our lives
[1:16:53] and the things that we're going through
[1:16:55] when the presence of God feels so far
[1:16:58] away don't worry
[1:17:01] God is the greatest Sculptor
[1:17:03] this world has ever seen
[1:17:06] you see when I when an artist begins to
[1:17:08] work on something
[1:17:11] and he has this giant piece of marble
[1:17:13] Granite whatever it is
[1:17:16] and he begins to chip away at it and
[1:17:18] maybe you walk by and you see that
[1:17:20] artist and he's chipping something and
[1:17:22] chipping something away and
[1:17:24] the next day you walk back by and
[1:17:25] there's just a big chunk out of the left
[1:17:27] side of it
[1:17:28] you're going my what an ugly sculpture
[1:17:32] and you come back the next day and
[1:17:33] there's a chunk out of the right side of
[1:17:34] it and you go this guy just don't know
[1:17:36] what he's doing
[1:17:37] and you come back the next day and
[1:17:39] there's just cuts and slashes and
[1:17:41] everything in it but then you go on a
[1:17:43] little vacation
[1:17:45] you go somewhere and
[1:17:47] you come back a week later and you go ma
[1:17:50] who made this

[1:18:02] when there's something that needs to
[1:18:03] come off of you
[1:18:04] but it takes some time
[1:18:07] the sculpture begins to knock that
[1:18:09] off of you
[1:18:11] but don't worry he's not done with the
[1:18:13] sculpture
[1:18:15] he's making something beautiful in his
[1:18:17] time
[1:18:19] say I feel worthless let him finish the
[1:18:22] sculpture

[1:28:15] his time
[1:28:17] cause you know the story
[1:28:22] I said I know it's funny how Martha
[1:28:25] would say I know that one day he'll rise
[1:28:28] again see we're always putting it off to
[1:28:31] something else or another day or an
[1:28:33] extra Revival or the next church service
[1:28:34] the next time I feel the presence of God
[1:28:36] but Jesus is sitting there telling her I
[1:28:39] am
[1:28:41] I am that Resurrection I am the one that
[1:28:45] can fix your pride I am the one that can
[1:28:47] change it
[1:28:49] you know the story
[1:28:51] the man that was dead
[1:28:53] corruption had already set in and
[1:28:55] everybody already wrote it off as an
[1:28:57] ugly story
[1:28:59] everybody had already wrote it off as
[1:29:01] not the truth
[1:29:03] everybody wrote it off as there's no way
[1:29:06] that this could ever turn into something
[1:29:08] beautiful
[1:29:10] it's past Redemption
[1:29:12] it can't be made right
[1:29:14] when Jesus walks in
[1:29:17] whether it's a mountain whether it's a
[1:29:19] troubled sea
[1:29:22] church I want to say this if it wasn't
[1:29:24] for the bad things if it wasn't for The
[1:29:26] Story of Lazarus if Lazarus would have
[1:29:29] never died today we would never have we
[1:29:32] would never be preaching on The Story of
[1:29:33] Lazarus but see what they were in in the
[1:29:35] moment looked horrible it looked gross
[1:29:37] and look it looked like something that
[1:29:39] they would never recover from
[1:29:41] but God was making a beautiful sculpture
[1:29:45] and on that day when it looked
[1:29:47] hopelessly you might feel so hopeless
[1:29:48] like you could never get out but all it
[1:29:50] takes is the voice of Resurrection
[1:29:53] to come in and say brother sister come
[1:29:56] forth Lazarus come forth and even though
[1:29:59] you felt dead in your sin even though
[1:30:01] you felt like you were the biggest
[1:30:02] mistake
[1:30:04] Lucy
[1:30:06] and let him go
[1:30:07] that's the kind of God we serve
[1:30:10] and he loves us and he cares for us God
[1:30:12] bless you in Jesus
