[28:53] thank you for doing that giving your
[28:54] Saturday to that purpose uh John chapter
[28:58] 3 and verse 1
[29:01] it says there was a man of the Pharisees
[29:03] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews
[29:06] the same came to Jesus by night and said
[29:09] unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a
[29:12] teacher come from God for no man can do
[29:15] these Miracles that thou doest except
[29:17] God be with him
[29:19] Jesus answered and said unto him verily
[29:21] verily I say unto you
[29:25] and that word there verily it's an
[29:28] exclamation he's saying absolutely
[29:32] I say unto you except a man be born
[29:35] again he cannot see the kingdom
[29:38] of God
[29:39] and Nicodemus saith in him how can a man
[29:42] be born when he is old
[29:44] and he entered the second time into his
[29:46] mother's womb and and be born Jesus
[29:50] answered verily verily I say unto thee
[29:52] except a man be born of water and of the
[29:55] spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom
[29:57] of God
[29:58] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[30:01] and that which is born of the spirit is
[30:03] Spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee
[30:05] you must be born again the wind bloweth
[30:08] where it listeth and thou Hearst the
[30:10] sound thereof but canst not tell whence
[30:13] it cometh and whether it goeth so is
[30:15] everyone that is born of the spirit I
[30:19] pray the Lord without his Blessing to
[30:21] the word you may be seated
[30:22] this morning
[30:26] we believe in miracles
[30:29] we believe that we serve a
[30:32] miracle-working god
[30:34] and we live in an age of Miracles not
[30:36] only Supernatural miracles from God but
[30:40] we live in an age of of an economic
[30:42] miracle that we have the things that we
[30:45] have it's an age of of a miracle of
[30:48] medicine that we have many of the
[30:51] medicines and things that we do some of
[30:53] us it seems like the doctors Keep Us
[30:55] Alive sometimes and and so it's a it's
[30:58] an age of medical Miracles it's an age
[31:01] of scientific Miracles when if you took
[31:04] somebody from a hundred years ago they
[31:07] would not understand what's going on
[31:09] today at all they they just wouldn't be
[31:12] able to comprehend what was happening in
[31:15] the world today there's Rockets flying
[31:17] up in the air and and satellites out
[31:20] there and we're able all the information
[31:21] in the world right or wrong is right on
[31:24] our fingertips and we're able to Google
[31:27] and and and whatever that you use to get
[31:30] that information and that's a miracle a
[31:33] scientific miracle in the day that we
[31:36] live in and yet during that same time
[31:39] Satan is actually deceiving the People
[31:43] by these scientific Miracles and these
[31:46] uh these miracles of of Commerce and
[31:50] miracles of uh of a culture that we live
[31:54] in today Satan is using that to deceive
[31:56] the people to set himself up as a God
[31:59] over the people to be the God of this
[32:01] evil age and yet during this same time
[32:04] we are actually seeing a miracle of God
[32:08] Among the bride that that there's a
[32:10] miracle that's being done that God is
[32:13] bringing a people out of laodicea how
[32:15] many believe that today God will have a
[32:18] people he will have a bride that will be
[32:21] a character like he wants a bride to be
[32:23] that will that will not fall in this age
[32:26] The Pride that will be what he wants her
[32:28] to be in I'm so grateful to be part of
[32:30] that Pride today
[32:33] so we can say that the greatest Miracle
[32:36] of this day or any day is the new birth
[32:40] it's when God takes a unconverted person
[32:44] and converts them and and makes them new
[32:48] a new creation
[32:50] and and we say that because of we know
[32:53] the condition of the unconverted and I
[32:56] want us to to look at that for just a
[32:58] moment because we need to recognize
[33:00] what's been done in our life you know if
[33:03] anybody ought to believe in miracles it
[33:05] should be us
[33:07] if there's anybody that ought to know
[33:09] that God is real it ought to be us
[33:12] because every one of you that are born
[33:14] again today every single one of you that
[33:16] have had a changed life whether you grew
[33:18] up in church or or your family was out
[33:21] of church on drugs alcohol whatever it
[33:23] is but your life has been changed and
[33:25] there was a miracle done in your life
[33:27] every one of you have had a supernatural
[33:29] event in your life and you know you what
[33:32] you came from you're not what you were
[33:33] you may not be what you want to be but
[33:36] you're not what you were and so it's
[33:38] supernatural event that's taken place
[33:40] and you can stand here and say I'm a I'm
[33:43] a product of a miracle and so I believe
[33:46] in Supernatural I've seen God working so
[33:49] I believe that God works I believe he's
[33:52] the same yesterday today and forever I
[33:54] believe that all things are possible if
[33:56] anybody ought to believe in miracles it
[33:58] ought to be us today
[34:00] right and and we see the condition of
[34:03] the unconverted our condition
[34:05] in the flesh
[34:07] without God
[34:09] our condition without God is to be a
[34:12] sinner
[34:13] brother Branham tells us he said first
[34:15] we reckon ourselves Sinners and worthy
[34:18] of condemnation and we are all born in
[34:21] sin and shaped in iniquity there's not a
[34:24] sound parcel of us
[34:27] you might as well just admit it this
[34:29] morning I'm the same well there's not a
[34:32] sound parcel you like to be able to say
[34:34] well you know this part of me was bad
[34:36] but that part of me was good now he said
[34:38] there's no part of you that's good
[34:41] not a sound parcel of us our minds are
[34:45] bad
[34:47] we ought to know that in this day and
[34:49] age
[34:50] our minds are bad our soul is
[34:53] corruptable our constant thinking is
[34:56] evil and he's talking about the
[34:57] unconverted he said every imaginary
[35:00] thought of a man's mind is evil a sinner
[35:03] he said and also our body is weak our
[35:08] spirit is no good and we're just full of
[35:11] corruption
[35:13] that's the state of the unconverted but
[35:17] I'm so glad he did a miracle in my life
[35:19] I'm so glad he changed me I'm so glad he
[35:22] reached down his hand for me and pulled
[35:24] me up out of the things of the world and
[35:26] he changed my mind he changed my
[35:28] thoughts he changed everything about me
[35:31] yeah that's good
[35:33] and so the Bible tells us that God saw
[35:36] that the wickedness of Man was created
[35:39] the Earth
[35:40] and this is before salvation
[35:42] notice that the whole world had gotten
[35:45] so bad that every imagination of the
[35:48] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[35:50] continually this is the state of the
[35:54] Sinner and I want to tell you this
[35:55] morning if you're not converted if
[35:57] you've not given your life to Christ if
[35:59] you've not been sealed by the Holy Ghost
[36:01] this is the state that you're living in
[36:03] that the thoughts of your heart are only
[36:06] evil continually
[36:09] exclusively
[36:10] Bad Evil continually
[36:16] he said I just can't believe that
[36:17] brother Ben you have to recognize that
[36:19] in order to be saved
[36:22] you have to yeah
[36:25] Job 14 and 1 says the man is born that
[36:28] is born of a woman is a few days and
[36:30] full of trouble
[36:32] you cometh forth like a flower and is
[36:34] cut down
[36:35] he fleth also as a shadow and continuous
[36:38] not
[36:40] and just now open Thine Eyes Upon such a
[36:42] one and bring us me into judgment with
[36:44] thee
[36:45] and look what he says he said who can
[36:47] bring a clean thing out of an unclean
[36:52] right and we are in our unconverted
[36:55] state unclean
[36:57] he said who can bring a clean thing out
[36:59] of an unclean who by doing 12 steps by
[37:02] reforming and those things are good and
[37:04] and they have their place but you can't
[37:06] bring a clean thing out of an unclean
[37:08] you can't by the process of your mind
[37:11] make yourself live and do and follow the
[37:14] words of Christ you can't just make
[37:16] yourself do that there's got to be a
[37:18] supernatural element to it there's got
[37:21] to be a part of you there's got to be
[37:23] something on the inside that Wheels you
[37:25] to that
[37:27] because you'll find that there will be a
[37:29] point in your life when you can't even
[37:30] come to church anymore they'll be a
[37:32] point in your life you don't feel like
[37:33] being a Christian you don't feel like
[37:35] going after God you'll be disappointed
[37:37] by people you'll be disappointed by
[37:39] preachers you'll be disappointed by
[37:41] Churches there'll be a time in your life
[37:43] when you'll be so disappointed by family
[37:45] and everybody else that you'll just be
[37:47] about ready to give up and it'll be at
[37:49] that moment when that Miracle begins to
[37:51] take place in your life begins to take
[37:53] precedence he said I didn't save you to
[37:55] lose you it takes a miracle to hold you
[37:58] it takes something Supernatural to keep
[38:01] you in the house of God it something
[38:04] Supernatural it takes something that
[38:06] changes your desires until you want to
[38:08] be in church more than you want to be at
[38:10] the pool hall you want to be in the
[38:11] house of God more than you want to be in
[38:13] the woods or somewhere else you want to
[38:15] be in the house of God listening to the
[38:17] word of God more than you want other
[38:18] things
[38:21] miracle in your life and I don't care
[38:22] how religious it you are I don't care
[38:24] how many times you go to church or even
[38:27] how many times you preach how many times
[38:28] you've come to an altar until that
[38:31] Miracle takes place in your life that
[38:33] changes your desire you still need God
[38:35] you're still in that same condition
[38:39] right sir yes sir
[38:42] who can bring a clean thing out of an
[38:44] unclean well I'll reform
[38:47] I'll be better
[38:49] you can't do it
[38:51] yeah it takes God
[38:54] you believe that today
[38:59] brother Brown said you stick your bucket
[39:01] down into the well and pull out a bucket
[39:02] of water and it's stagnant
[39:05] it stinks
[39:07] you're looking and it's muddy and little
[39:08] worms is in the water and there's no way
[39:10] at all to put your bucket back and get a
[39:12] clean bucket
[39:14] the whole well is contaminated
[39:17] the whole soul mind and body of man is
[39:20] contaminated with sin
[39:22] born in sin physically
[39:24] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[39:26] speaking lies
[39:28] so that his own soul is contaminated
[39:31] nothing good
[39:33] one cannot redeem the other because it's
[39:37] all wrong
[39:39] then you can't take a bucket full of
[39:41] water here
[39:43] that's contaminated and another bucket
[39:46] full that's contaminated and mix them
[39:49] together you've got more contamination
[39:52] that's why you can't say well I'll
[39:53] follow a prophet and then I'll be all
[39:56] right can't take a contaminated bucket a
[39:58] human being
[40:00] and by following another human being
[40:02] make yourself right
[40:03] there was only one uncontaminated bucket
[40:06] and that was Jesus Christ
[40:08] [Applause]
[40:10] you can't pick a bucket full of water
[40:12] this containment and say well I'll be
[40:14] more like Kim I'll be like the pastor
[40:16] I'll I'll follow the path I'll do what
[40:18] the pastor says that's not going to make
[40:20] you uncontaminated I'll listen to a
[40:23] prophet that's good we should I'll do it
[40:25] that's good we should do it a prophet
[40:26] says we should do what the Bible says
[40:28] but that will uncontaminate you you need
[40:31] a miracle in your life
[40:35] yes
[40:37] no preacher can redeem you
[40:40] yeah no Pope can redeem you going to
[40:43] church by itself won't redeem you
[40:46] going to church won't make you want to
[40:48] go to church
[40:51] right
[40:52] God acting like a Christian won't make
[40:55] you want won't change your desires
[40:57] really be a Christian but if you ever
[40:59] get converted on the inside if you ever
[41:02] if that if that Holy Ghost can fire ever
[41:04] takes a hole on the inside and burns up
[41:07] all the atmospheres and fits it'll
[41:09] change you it'll make you want to be in
[41:11] the house of God
[41:15] I am
[41:17] I think of David
[41:19] in Psalm 51 5 he said behold I was
[41:22] shaping in iniquity
[41:24] he was desperate
[41:27] he was desperate because he'd messed up
[41:31] we recognized he said I need help
[41:34] I need Supernatural help
[41:36] he said I need forgiveness I was shaping
[41:39] an iniquity and sin did my mother
[41:41] conceive me
[41:43] I know some people say well you know he
[41:44] does bad things but he has a good heart
[41:48] let me tell you what the Bible says
[41:51] the Bible says the heart is deceitful
[41:54] Above All Things
[41:56] and desperately wicked
[42:01] well I know this is this is a little bit
[42:03] a little bit hard but it's the truth
[42:05] what the Bible says
[42:06] the heart is desperately wicked the
[42:09] unconverted heart is desperately wicked
[42:12] who can know it it goes on to say I the
[42:15] Lord try the hearts
[42:17] Lord aren't you glad that he does aren't
[42:19] you glad he can see the heart
[42:21] but the heart itself is deceitful people
[42:23] today we'll tell you follow your heart
[42:24] do what your heart tells you to do you
[42:26] need to listen to your heart and the
[42:28] truth is that's the worst thing you
[42:30] could follow because your heart will
[42:32] lead you away
[42:33] your heart will make you think you let
[42:35] you love someone other than your spouse
[42:36] your heart will make you think that that
[42:39] you that you've been wounded too many
[42:40] times to come to the house of God your
[42:42] heart will make you think that that you
[42:44] can't serve God no more that it would be
[42:46] easier to go a different way but if you
[42:48] ever get a converted Soul it'll take
[42:50] precedence over that and it'll begin to
[42:52] dominate that that heart that seed of
[42:55] your emotions
[42:57] hey man
[42:59] and so you know when we talk about the
[43:02] miracle of conversion the miracle is not
[43:05] that we chose to be saved
[43:08] and we're saved
[43:09] but that we were saved in spite of our
[43:12] free will
[43:15] yes
[43:16] amen
[43:18] I'm so glad I got a God I serve a God
[43:21] that's bigger than my free will
[43:23] bigger than what I wanted bigger than
[43:25] what aren't you glad that that gives you
[43:27] hope for your children doesn't it that
[43:29] gives you hope for your family because
[43:30] he's bigger than their desires he's
[43:32] bigger than their Free Will he's bigger
[43:34] than all of that he's able to change
[43:36] them to change their desires to change
[43:41] what they wanted oh my they made this
[43:43] they may be headed straight for hell
[43:45] with all that they can do they can run
[43:47] straight for it but God reached down his
[43:49] hand and supernaturally changes their
[43:52] mind
[43:53] and then they come to God by free will
[43:55] but they never would have unless he'd
[43:57] have done something in their life
[43:59] supernaturally changed them
[44:05] the Bible says all we like sheep
[44:09] have gone astray
[44:12] all we like sheep but the Caleb bets
[44:15] I like those goats that your wife said
[44:17] was coming down your lane that's what
[44:20] goats do that's what sheep do if you let
[44:22] them out of the pen they wander off
[44:25] and they wandered together
[44:27] in herds usually but they wander off
[44:32] and one follows the other and they don't
[44:34] even know why if you ask that last goat
[44:35] why he left
[44:37] the other ones did it
[44:40] everybody else did it so I did it too
[44:43] everybody else was drinking so I drank
[44:45] too everybody else smoked I smoked too
[44:47] everybody else was carrying on with
[44:49] women so I did it too everybody else was
[44:51] living that kind of life I did it too
[44:54] oh we like sheep have gone astray
[44:57] we have turned everyone to his own
[45:01] way
[45:03] his own way that original word is Derek
[45:07] it is the word that's used in train up a
[45:10] child in the way he should go I preached
[45:12] that to you before it's taken from a
[45:14] root word which means a bow the the wood
[45:17] that they would pick for a bow it's bent
[45:19] a certain direction
[45:21] and so he says we have turned everyone
[45:23] to his own Derek it's to his own way to
[45:27] his own bent
[45:28] whatever we wanted to be whatever our
[45:31] whatever our DNA made us whatever our
[45:33] families were whatever whatever events
[45:36] shaped Us in life we just continued that
[45:39] way as the tree falls so it leans we we
[45:41] or as it leans so it falls we just kept
[45:44] going we just kept leaning we just kept
[45:46] moving that direction and what we would
[45:49] be today is just that without the Holy
[45:51] Ghost without the miracle of God in our
[45:53] life we have gone astray and we have
[45:56] gone our own way
[45:58] we have leaned and we have fallen in our
[46:01] own our own particular
[46:03] sin
[46:05] whether it's self-righteousness
[46:08] ungodliness
[46:10] it's all sin
[46:12] aren't you glad for a savior today
[46:15] whether you were raised in church
[46:17] and you you thought well I I go to
[46:20] church I pay my tithes I'm a good person
[46:21] but if you've been born again
[46:24] because you've lean your own way you go
[46:26] your own way until the shepherd comes
[46:29] the Bible says for you where is sheep
[46:31] going astray but are now returned aren't
[46:34] you glad to have returned today you have
[46:37] now returned unto the shepherd you were
[46:39] always a Sheep amen you were a stray you
[46:42] went astray but the shepherd went and
[46:44] found you and now you have returned to
[46:46] the shepherd you've returned to the
[46:48] shepherd and Bishop of your souls
[46:51] Hallelujah in Luke 15 1 he tells us how
[46:55] we return to the shepherd because many
[46:57] times we think well let's buy our own
[46:58] efforts we we strove and we fought and
[47:01] we we tried and eventually we got back
[47:03] but look what the shepherd does in Luke
[47:06] 15 1 it says all the publicans and
[47:09] sinners Drew near to hear him and the
[47:11] Pharisees and the scribes murmured
[47:13] saying this man receive his Sinners and
[47:15] eateth with them
[47:17] and he's faked this Parable unto them
[47:19] saying what man of you having a hundred
[47:21] sheep if he lose one of them so and
[47:25] watch the Sheep were his
[47:27] the Sheep belonged to the bishop
[47:31] the shepherd the bishop is the great
[47:33] Shepherd
[47:34] it belonged to the shepherd
[47:36] and so the shepherd had sheep and now
[47:40] he's going to go after the Sheep
[47:42] his sheep
[47:44] he's not going after anybody else's but
[47:46] he says my sheep know my voice
[47:49] so if he found you you were one of his
[47:53] aren't you glad for that today all out
[47:55] of that ought to make his child that
[47:57] ought to make us excited because if he
[47:59] found you you were already one of his
[48:00] you were in his mind before the
[48:02] foundation of the earth if he found you
[48:04] you belong to him
[48:06] he does not find those who do not belong
[48:09] to him
[48:10] if he found you he found you for a
[48:13] reason
[48:14] and he says he goes off in the
[48:17] wilderness
[48:17] until he find it
[48:19] and when he has found it when he hath
[48:23] found it the Sheep is wandering around
[48:26] in the wilderness bleeding and crying
[48:28] it's been wounded or whatever that's
[48:30] happened to the Sheep while it's out
[48:32] there it's gone its own way and here
[48:34] comes the shepherd and he goes and he
[48:37] finds it it does not come to him it's
[48:39] gone so far it can't hear his voice it
[48:41] doesn't recognize who he is but he comes
[48:44] down to where the Sheep is he may have
[48:46] to climb a mountain he may have to go in
[48:48] the desert he may have to get up on a
[48:50] rock he may have to go through gravy
[48:51] leaks to get to you but he's going where
[48:54] you are
[48:56] and then people today say well come as
[48:59] you are and there's some truth to that
[49:00] but we don't want you to stay as you are
[49:02] but I tell you what it's you it's not
[49:04] you coming as you are but it's him
[49:06] coming to you and he'll find you no
[49:08] matter if you're sitting on a bar stool
[49:10] no matter if you're sitting in a church
[49:11] pew wherever you are he'll find you and
[49:14] when he finds you you're his he gonna
[49:16] put you on his shoulders
[49:19] Hallelujah
[49:21] Hallelujah aren't you glad to be a sheep
[49:23] this morning it's a miracle that he
[49:25] found me it's a miracle that he put me
[49:27] on his shoulders and when he put me on
[49:29] his shoulders what happened I was on the
[49:32] strongest part of him
[49:35] yeah
[49:35] yeah
[49:36] oh that makes me the strength of a man
[49:38] who's in his shoulders
[49:40] the Bible says the government is upon
[49:42] his shoulders when he found me he put me
[49:44] on the strongest part of him there's no
[49:46] danger of me going out again there's no
[49:49] danger of me being lost again there's no
[49:51] danger
[49:53] of me being overtaken by somebody else
[49:55] by some wolf and taking off in the
[49:57] wilderness
[49:59] shoulders
[50:02] for me to die he'd have to die
[50:07] Hallelujah that's why you can't even
[50:10] believe this Earth till he's done with
[50:11] you
[50:13] when he found me
[50:15] put me on his shoulders
[50:17] isn't that a great thought so I know
[50:19] it's simple but he found me put me on
[50:21] his shoulders
[50:22] he carries me on his shoulders rejoicing
[50:28] Hallelujah
[50:29] he doesn't just well I found another
[50:31] sheep
[50:33] stupid sheep
[50:35] got lost again had to go find it
[50:39] you know
[50:41] grumbling oh that's not what he does
[50:43] but when he finds it yeah
[50:46] come on he rejoices
[50:49] and when you see a sinner rejoicing
[50:51] that's been saved when you see when you
[50:53] see a church rejoicing because people
[50:55] got saved they're they're only rejoicing
[50:57] because he is rejoicing
[51:00] and when a sinner saved the Angels
[51:01] Rejoice why do the Angels Rejoice he
[51:04] rejoice
[51:06] glory to God it's not us rejoicing it's
[51:09] him rejoicing through us
[51:11] I found my Sheep amen
[51:14] Hallelujah
[51:16] when he cometh home
[51:18] call it together as friends and
[51:20] neighbors and says let's have a good old
[51:23] Pentecostal meeting
[51:24] Rejoice with me for I have found my
[51:28] sheep
[51:29] which was lost
[51:31] Hallelujah
[51:33] see you always were his sheep
[51:36] brother Branham taught us he said we did
[51:37] not become seed by the rebirth we were
[51:40] feed and therefore were reborn for only
[51:43] the elect can be reborn
[51:45] because of Hallelujah because we were
[51:48] seen it's the reason we could be
[51:50] quickened in non-seed there is nothing
[51:52] to Quicken quit letting the devil beat
[51:55] you up about well you're not a Christian
[51:57] you're not a child of God you can't be
[51:59] saved you're you're not really at the
[52:01] elect of God did he find you
[52:04] come on Church did he find you if he
[52:07] found you
[52:09] found you then you're one of his
[52:12] [Music]
[52:13] Hallelujah if he found you you're a
[52:16] child of the king you're one of his
[52:18] sheep so he found you
[52:21] only the elect can be reborn
[52:24] Hallelujah because we were seed is the
[52:27] reason we could be quick and oh non-seed
[52:29] can feel good they can have they can
[52:31] participate in a Revival they can even
[52:33] go to church but there's something
[52:34] holding you what is it you're on his
[52:36] shoulders you're his sheep you belong to
[52:38] him
[52:40] only elect can be reborn
[52:43] because we were seeing there's a reason
[52:45] we could be quickened and non-seed
[52:47] there's nothing to Quicken he said hold
[52:49] this carefully in mind he said now take
[52:51] the next step
[52:52] redeem means to buy back it restores to
[52:56] the original owner God by his death the
[52:59] shed blood brought back his own
[53:02] he bought back the spoken word seed
[53:04] bride my sheep hear my voice the word
[53:07] and they follow me
[53:09] you always were a sheep
[53:12] you never were a pig or a dog turned
[53:14] into a sheep you said but you don't know
[53:17] the kind of Life I Lived that was just
[53:19] the sticky nature on the outside but
[53:21] somewhere in there was a seed that just
[53:23] hadn't been awakened yet it hadn't been
[53:25] quickened yet but it was there
[53:27] and so it had to be there he couldn't
[53:29] find you but when he found you you were
[53:32] Reborn
[53:33] Hallelujah you never were a pig you
[53:36] never were a dog turned into a sheep
[53:38] that is impossible for every kind of
[53:40] Life produces the same kind there is no
[53:42] change in species as we were in the
[53:45] thoughts of God and then expressed in
[53:46] flesh there had to come a day when he
[53:49] would hear his voice the word and
[53:51] hearing that voice become aware of our
[53:53] father calling us and recognize that we
[53:56] are the sons of God
[53:59] oh hear his voice today if you've never
[54:02] been converted you've never been found
[54:04] hear his voice today he's calling to you
[54:07] it's calling to you young people you
[54:10] children yes hear his voice
[54:12] you're one of his
[54:14] he wants to put you on his shoulders he
[54:17] wants to take away all the doubt and the
[54:19] frustration of fear and the worry he
[54:21] wants you to trust him
[54:23] amen
[54:27] he said
[54:28] if we were in the thoughts of God
[54:31] we read that he said we heard his voice
[54:33] and we cried out as did The Prodigal Son
[54:37] Save Me O my father
[54:39] I am returning
[54:41] to thee the prodigal son was in a big
[54:43] pen but he was not a pig
[54:47] he was eating pig food
[54:50] but he was not a pig
[54:53] I was in a pig pen one day I was eating
[54:56] pig food but I was not a pig
[55:02] amen
[55:04] Hallelujah
[55:06] I just feel the presence of the Lord
[55:08] this morning
[55:09] don't you believe anything is possible
[55:11] in the presence of the Lord
[55:15] Hallelujah brother Brandon tells his
[55:17] Eagle story you all know him the little
[55:19] story of the egg was left maybe some of
[55:22] the children haven't heard it the egg
[55:24] that was left there in the farmers in
[55:27] the farmers the farmer pounded and he
[55:30] brought it there to his chicken coop he
[55:32] puts it among the other eggs and it
[55:34] hatches because all it takes for an egg
[55:36] to hatch his atmosphere
[55:38] so it hatches they're in a chicken coop
[55:40] but it's different yeah there's
[55:42] something about it that's different yes
[55:45] it eats chicken food but it doesn't like
[55:47] it
[55:48] it's taught to cluck and to stay on the
[55:52] ground and to move around scratching in
[55:55] the dirt
[55:56] we were talking last night about how
[55:58] stupid chickens are
[56:01] because they just they just they just
[56:03] walk around and and and you know you you
[56:05] can cut their head off it don't make
[56:07] much difference in their life you know
[56:08] they just kind of
[56:11] keep acting like they always do I don't
[56:14] know if you've ever seen that but I have
[56:15] we used to cook them we used to catch
[56:17] them anyway
[56:21] the skill involved in that by the way
[56:25] but the chickens are pretty dumb you
[56:27] know they just say they're just pretty
[56:28] close to the ground they can't fly very
[56:30] far they can fly but they don't like to
[56:33] but they're going to get a little ways
[56:35] above the ground you know and they want
[56:37] to get back on the ground pretty quick
[56:39] but the Eagles a different sort of bird
[56:43] ain't looked different he talked
[56:46] different but he didn't know really how
[56:47] to talk because he'd never heard an
[56:48] eagle
[56:48] tall so he tried to cluck like the
[56:51] chickens yeah he tried to scratch like
[56:53] the chickens and he's getting busy down
[56:56] there doing that and he's getting he's
[56:57] starting to grow and as he grows he
[56:59] becomes more and more unlike them yeah
[57:01] he's out of place and so he's sitting
[57:04] down there in a chicken pen and and the
[57:06] and the old hens around him saying
[57:07] clucking brother said saying days of
[57:09] Miracles has passed
[57:11] right God don't do that no more that's
[57:14] the hen clucky
[57:16] God don't have preachers no more God
[57:18] don't have church no more God don't you
[57:20] don't have to you know we just we moved
[57:21] past that that's the hen clucking I
[57:24] don't do Miracles no more so it's just a
[57:26] cluck in denominational uh clucking just
[57:28] down there cratching in the dirt and
[57:30] trying to get the grubs and the worms
[57:33] but one day
[57:35] Mama Eagle knew
[57:37] she had another egg
[57:39] she had another baby that was there
[57:42] somewhere and so she went looking for it
[57:44] and she's flying over the Barnyard and
[57:46] she begins to scream as only an eagle
[57:48] can and when she screams illegal
[57:52] oh my
[57:54] God I've heard that yeah
[57:57] yeah
[57:58] when I heard this message from myself
[58:01] I'd heard it growing up but when I heard
[58:03] it from myself one day
[58:05] I heard it all of a sudden I heard
[58:06] something wow there's something about
[58:08] that that's eternal
[58:10] there's something about that that's real
[58:12] and I heard it when I heard it it's
[58:15] something about that said that's
[58:16] Supernatural there's something more than
[58:19] just a man there's got to be something
[58:21] to it something real and so I I you
[58:23] begin to look up and you begin to say
[58:25] Lord where are you
[58:27] and she screamed again here I am
[58:31] en he couldn't go out of the Barnyard he
[58:34] couldn't rescue himself he couldn't make
[58:36] himself a I couldn't make himself fly in
[58:38] the heavenlies but she had to teach him
[58:41] little little Eagle screamed back and
[58:44] said Mama
[58:45] she said fly in the heavenlies he said I
[58:49] can't she said well just jump up on that
[58:51] post
[58:52] amen jump up as far as you can jump and
[58:55] then just trust the wind because once
[58:57] you get up here the Holy Ghost is going
[58:59] to lift you once you jump in Release
[59:02] Yourself to the wind the whole don't be
[59:04] scared of coming to the Holy Spirit
[59:06] don't be scared of giving your life to
[59:08] Christ because if you're an eagle once
[59:10] you get in that wind you get in those
[59:12] days it begins to pull you they don't
[59:14] have to Flap like a chicken but they
[59:16] just set their wings
[59:18] Hallelujah
[59:20] oh that's what we were
[59:22] yeah brother I'm just going to keep
[59:24] telling stories I guess brother Brown
[59:26] tells the story about the duck you've
[59:27] all heard it the duck
[59:30] and the duck is different he's at the
[59:32] chicken bin
[59:33] and the little duck he just he'd never
[59:35] been around water but he's built for
[59:37] water
[59:39] yeah and one day the old chicken the old
[59:41] hen let him out a little bit too far out
[59:42] of the Barnyard and he gets close enough
[59:45] to the pond he can smell the water and
[59:48] when he smells the water he goes
[59:50] straight for the bar for the pond
[59:52] quacking as hard as he can it didn't
[59:54] have that effect on any of the rest of
[59:56] them but it had that effect on him why
[59:58] he was a duck to begin with
[1:00:04] Hallelujah
[1:00:06] now we know
[1:00:08] how do you love him this morning
[1:00:10] [Music]
[1:00:11] there can be no Miracle of the new birth
[1:00:13] without death that's right
[1:00:16] Genesis 2 17 the Bible says of the trend
[1:00:19] of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt
[1:00:21] not eat of it and they thou he deserve
[1:00:23] thou shall surely die we know they ate
[1:00:24] from it and their sin that they did
[1:00:28] and God required death
[1:00:30] Nicodemus in John 3 and 9 he picks up
[1:00:33] the story
[1:00:34] as we pick up from where our texts were
[1:00:36] that we read
[1:00:38] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how
[1:00:40] can these things be
[1:00:42] he said I don't understand it
[1:00:44] I have a hard time grasping a new birth
[1:00:47] what does that even mean
[1:00:49] he said you must be born again
[1:00:52] and he thought he was going to tell him
[1:00:53] oh here's how you get closer to God keep
[1:00:56] these Commandments and walk so far every
[1:00:58] day and and cleanse yourself in a
[1:01:00] certain pool
[1:01:02] he didn't tell him that
[1:01:05] he didn't tell him go go listen to tapes
[1:01:08] at a certain times
[1:01:11] that's legalism
[1:01:13] he didn't tell him go go and wash
[1:01:15] yourself up make yourself quit quit
[1:01:17] smoking quit drinking quit doing all
[1:01:18] that that's all he told him he said you
[1:01:20] must be born again
[1:01:24] yeah are you with me now
[1:01:26] you must be born again
[1:01:28] demon said I don't understand it I was
[1:01:30] waiting for a set of instructions yeah
[1:01:34] but being born against a supernatural
[1:01:36] thing it doesn't come with a set of
[1:01:38] instructions
[1:01:40] home yes sir but it comes with the
[1:01:42] wisdom of the Holy Ghost the teacher
[1:01:46] brother Branham that says In this
[1:01:48] passage he said Nicodemus said you're we
[1:01:49] know you're a great teacher that comes
[1:01:51] from God he said Jesus corrected him he
[1:01:53] said the teacher is coming the Holy
[1:01:56] Ghost
[1:01:57] hey man I can't teach you nothing
[1:01:59] because you're not born again yeah
[1:02:01] right and so and so now he's looking for
[1:02:05] a teacher he's looking for a 12-step
[1:02:06] program something to to step him through
[1:02:09] but that's not what God brought now
[1:02:11] Jesus answered and said to him art thou
[1:02:14] a master of Israel and no it's not these
[1:02:16] things
[1:02:17] verily verily I say to you absolutely I
[1:02:20] say unto you we speak that we do know
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] and testify what we've seen
[1:02:29] Glory you receive not our Witness
[1:02:31] he said if I told you Earthly things and
[1:02:33] you believe not now you know he's seeing
[1:02:35] miracles happen
[1:02:37] right things that he could he knew the
[1:02:39] lame walk the dead were raised
[1:02:42] he said if you don't believe that that's
[1:02:44] Earthly things how are you believe if I
[1:02:47] tell you Heavenly things
[1:02:49] he said no man has to send it up to
[1:02:51] heaven but he that come down from heaven
[1:02:53] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:02:55] boy now he just opens up the word so if
[1:02:58] you can take it
[1:03:00] Nicodemus is scratch and said what is he
[1:03:02] talking about
[1:03:04] and as Moses lifted up to
[1:03:06] up this wilderness
[1:03:08] now watch where he goes now with the new
[1:03:10] birth
[1:03:11] even so must the son of man be lifted up
[1:03:14] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:03:16] not perish but have everlasting life so
[1:03:18] he had to die on the cross aren't you
[1:03:20] glad that he did
[1:03:21] verse 16 for God so loved the world
[1:03:24] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:03:27] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:03:29] perish but have everlasting life
[1:03:32] for God sent not his son into the world
[1:03:34] to condemn the world but that the world
[1:03:36] through him might be saved he that
[1:03:38] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[1:03:40] that believeth not is condemned already
[1:03:42] because he has not believed in the name
[1:03:44] of the only begotten son of God
[1:03:46] and this is the condemnation that light
[1:03:49] is coming to the world and Men love
[1:03:50] Darkness rather than light because their
[1:03:52] deeds were evil
[1:03:54] so he said for everyone that doeth evil
[1:03:56] hateth the light neither cometh to the
[1:03:57] light lest his deeds should be reproved
[1:03:59] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:04:01] light that his deeds may be made
[1:04:02] manifest Terror in God so he's saying
[1:04:05] there has to be a death that takes place
[1:04:07] not only the death of the Redeemer but
[1:04:09] there has to be a death take place in
[1:04:11] the subject of the Oneness to be born
[1:04:13] again because in order to be a new
[1:04:15] creature he's got to die to the old
[1:04:17] creature in order to come into a
[1:04:19] supernatural birth he's got to die to
[1:04:21] what's already living and already
[1:04:23] reigning in his soul in order to be
[1:04:25] married to Christ the old man has to die
[1:04:29] all right so now it's he said he the
[1:04:32] truth comes to the light so he said and
[1:04:34] that should tell us what the evidence of
[1:04:36] the Holy Ghost is by the way the
[1:04:38] evidence of the new birth is not
[1:04:39] shouting it's not speaking in tongues
[1:04:40] it's not feeling good but the evidence
[1:04:42] of the Holy Ghost is the life that
[1:04:45] follows it's Living the Life of Christ
[1:04:46] it's manifesting the life right
[1:04:50] right his deeds will be made manifest
[1:04:52] yes
[1:04:53] now brother Adam said there's an
[1:04:55] approach to this birth are you still
[1:04:56] okay this morning I hope we're okay
[1:05:00] he said there is approach to it and to
[1:05:02] be to approach this birth you have to go
[1:05:04] through a process just like anything
[1:05:06] that lives anything that lives has got
[1:05:08] to die first and you cannot keep your
[1:05:10] Same Spirit you cannot keep your same
[1:05:12] habits you cannot keep your same
[1:05:14] thoughts you've got to die
[1:05:16] you've got to die like he died you've
[1:05:19] got to die on this altar like Abel did
[1:05:21] with Islam he said what part of me has
[1:05:23] to die see this in order for the seed to
[1:05:25] come to life the shell that surrounds it
[1:05:27] has got to die it's the same way if you
[1:05:28] plant a seed out here in the ground that
[1:05:30] seed you know what happens first it dies
[1:05:33] and then it rots
[1:05:35] and when it's so dead that you think it
[1:05:37] could never come back
[1:05:39] in the spring it comes back again why
[1:05:42] because there's a germ of life you can't
[1:05:44] even see it with your eye you can only
[1:05:46] see it with a microscope but there's a
[1:05:48] germ of life down the inside of that
[1:05:49] seed that seems like it's dead and
[1:05:51] rotten but when it did when it's dead
[1:05:53] and it rots see while it's whole
[1:05:57] the nutrients from the soil and the
[1:05:59] atmosphere can't get to it
[1:06:02] that's why so many people never get
[1:06:03] truly born again because they're in the
[1:06:06] atmosphere but they've never died
[1:06:09] and because they've never died to
[1:06:11] themselves and their own ideas and their
[1:06:13] own habits and their own ways and
[1:06:16] they're still trying to well I'm going
[1:06:17] to be me I'm going to live like me I'm
[1:06:19] going to have my ideas and my thing you
[1:06:21] can't come to God like that
[1:06:23] you can't come come you've got to be
[1:06:25] like the eagle say teach me how to fly
[1:06:28] come on let me die to my own thoughts
[1:06:30] yeah and so you've got to die or you
[1:06:33] can't feel the influence of the
[1:06:34] atmosphere that you're in yeah
[1:06:37] oh my
[1:06:38] brother random says this he said you've
[1:06:41] got to die like he died you've got to
[1:06:42] die on his altar like Abel did with his
[1:06:45] lamb you got to die with your lamb
[1:06:46] you've got to die die your own thinking
[1:06:48] to be born in his thinking let the mind
[1:06:51] that was in Christ be in you
[1:06:53] you've got to feel so guilty when you
[1:06:56] stand in his presence
[1:06:58] whether you go the method of sway or the
[1:07:00] Baptist way or whatever way you go
[1:07:02] you've got to be so guilty and feel so
[1:07:05] guilty till it'll kill you
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:09] your worldly life will die right there
[1:07:12] you've got to reckon yourself so guilty
[1:07:14] in the presence of God until your
[1:07:16] worldly life dies right there the sin
[1:07:19] questions over for you
[1:07:21] when you're standing in his presence
[1:07:24] oh that's the way it was for me how
[1:07:26] about you the sin question's over I'm
[1:07:29] not gonna be ruled by us anymore yes I
[1:07:31] make mistakes because the outside is
[1:07:32] still a sticky nature you make mistakes
[1:07:35] because the outside is still a sticky
[1:07:36] nature but there's something inside of
[1:07:38] you that will not let go
[1:07:40] will not let go why because there's
[1:07:43] something that sand us stood in his
[1:07:45] presence and no man can ever be in his
[1:07:47] presence and ever be the same
[1:07:49] right right
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:55] Paul picks it up in Romans 6 he said
[1:07:57] what should we say then shall we
[1:07:58] continue in sin that Grace May abound
[1:08:00] because he said we're sin abounded Grace
[1:08:01] Super abounded
[1:08:03] Grace did much more abound
[1:08:05] he said God forbid how shall we that are
[1:08:07] dead to sin live any longer yeah yeah
[1:08:09] they're in
[1:08:11] know you not that so many of us as we're
[1:08:13] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:08:16] into his death
[1:08:18] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:08:20] baptism and to death and I've explained
[1:08:22] that to you before on baptism but when
[1:08:25] we're baptized there's a reason why we
[1:08:26] lay down in the water
[1:08:28] let the water cover us its burial
[1:08:32] right death burial and Resurrection
[1:08:35] right but if you don't die to your own
[1:08:37] self before you go down you'll go down a
[1:08:39] wet Center come up a dry one go down to
[1:08:42] dry Center come up a wetland that's how
[1:08:44] that works
[1:08:47] right because you you have to die
[1:08:50] oh my you've got to die he said if we've
[1:08:54] been planted together in the likeness of
[1:08:56] his death we shall be also in the
[1:08:57] likeness of his resurrection
[1:08:59] knowing this that our old man is
[1:09:01] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:09:04] might be watched destroyed
[1:09:08] not coddled
[1:09:10] not not not pampered
[1:09:15] God help us today yeah
[1:09:16] I I don't want to be hard but we can't
[1:09:20] pan for sin we can't coddle sin it's got
[1:09:23] to be dealt with
[1:09:25] and I'll say this if I preach against
[1:09:27] sin without tears in my eyes there's
[1:09:29] something wrong with me
[1:09:30] it shouldn't be something you love to do
[1:09:32] but it's got to be dealt with
[1:09:35] because so many today have been baptized
[1:09:38] you see it in nominal churches all over
[1:09:39] the place people are being baptized oh
[1:09:41] we baptized 50 today and they go right
[1:09:43] back into their own thing I saw a video
[1:09:45] of a woman that had been baptized and
[1:09:47] she'd come up they said why are you
[1:09:48] being baptized she said well I want to
[1:09:50] be a warrior for God's Animal Kingdom
[1:09:56] I mean that's good I guess
[1:10:00] that's that's not why you get baptized
[1:10:03] you want to be you want to be a son or
[1:10:06] daughter of God
[1:10:07] you want to live with him
[1:10:09] are you with me now people get baptized
[1:10:12] they don't know why that's why everybody
[1:10:13] else is we'll just get baptized you know
[1:10:15] you need to die to yourself
[1:10:18] I'll say this if our children have a
[1:10:19] desire to be baptized we need to let
[1:10:21] them be baptized as soon as they're old
[1:10:23] enough to understand don't know hold
[1:10:24] them back because if you hold them back
[1:10:26] I've seen many times I think of a story
[1:10:28] right now of a young of a young person
[1:10:30] that was told that they by their parents
[1:10:33] said you're not ready your life's not
[1:10:34] right you shouldn't be baptized and I'm
[1:10:36] not trying to override parents here but
[1:10:38] a young man wanted to and today he
[1:10:40] doesn't
[1:10:41] today's a teenager has no interest in
[1:10:43] being baptized
[1:10:44] I say do it while while they want to
[1:10:48] do it while they want you say well I'm
[1:10:49] not going to push my child I I told my
[1:10:51] children they needed to be baptized
[1:10:54] they needed to repent first
[1:10:57] then they needed to be baptized
[1:10:59] well I'm not going to push them I'm not
[1:11:01] going to drag my kids to church
[1:11:03] are you not going to go they decide to
[1:11:06] stay home we can do leave them at home
[1:11:07] alone of course you're going to drag
[1:11:09] your children to church
[1:11:11] I was drunk to church
[1:11:13] brother Harvey was drugged to church
[1:11:16] we didn't want to go
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:20] kind of getting into the night sermon a
[1:11:21] little bit but but we you know
[1:11:24] little unconverted people they church is
[1:11:26] hard man
[1:11:28] you're sitting in church and we try to
[1:11:30] make it as easy for them as we can but
[1:11:31] you know it's just a guy talking for a
[1:11:33] couple hours it's hard you know they
[1:11:35] like spend time with their friends but
[1:11:37] they're thinking about something else
[1:11:38] you can't blame them for that
[1:11:40] say well they always act up when they're
[1:11:42] in church they will
[1:11:44] they'll do that but bring them to church
[1:11:47] bring them to the house of God set a
[1:11:50] standard in an example this is what we
[1:11:52] do on Sunday morning we go to the house
[1:11:54] of God it might be hard but this is what
[1:11:56] we do
[1:11:58] because here they have there's an
[1:12:00] atmosphere that if they ever repent if
[1:12:02] they ever begin to die to themselves
[1:12:03] that atmosphere will begin to get a hold
[1:12:05] and as soon as the light strikes the sea
[1:12:08] as soon as the atmosphere can get to the
[1:12:09] Sea and the death has taken place
[1:12:11] they'll be born again
[1:12:15] because they want to be baptized let
[1:12:16] them be baptized teach them right let
[1:12:19] them be baptized because they
[1:12:21] you don't know what God might do
[1:12:26] look we know that our old man is
[1:12:28] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:12:31] might be destroyed not not coddled
[1:12:32] destroyed and henceforth we should not
[1:12:35] serve sin for he that is dead is freed
[1:12:39] from sin
[1:12:41] but the brown said if you're born of God
[1:12:42] you're washed in the waters of the word
[1:12:44] separated from the things of the world
[1:12:46] and believe God you're dead you're dead
[1:12:49] to your own thinking did your own ideas
[1:12:50] dead to everything else but God's word
[1:12:52] and it lives in you working back through
[1:12:55] you proving that it is God's word you
[1:12:58] say I'm dead to the world brother
[1:12:59] Branham and deny God's word Jesus said
[1:13:01] these signs shall follow them that
[1:13:03] believe he said now we're getting down
[1:13:04] to what Born Again means
[1:13:06] he said still with tempered still mean
[1:13:08] arrogant
[1:13:10] well that got real real fast didn't it
[1:13:14] God help us today
[1:13:17] somebody say something about you you're
[1:13:18] right up ready to fight
[1:13:20] and then born of the spirit of God
[1:13:22] 's Spirit don't do like that
[1:13:25] God's spirit is humble Meek sweet
[1:13:26] long-suffering God help us today that's
[1:13:29] God loving kind forgiving that's God's
[1:13:32] spirit
[1:13:33] but they'll hold to that denomination he
[1:13:35] said speak in tongues prophesy do all
[1:13:37] kinds of works
[1:13:38] Jesus said they do it having a form of
[1:13:40] godliness hold to the denomination
[1:13:43] because that's their father
[1:13:44] right that's their origin
[1:13:47] they was born in that denominational
[1:13:49] father but if you're born of God
[1:13:52] this is your father
[1:13:55] he is the word hallelujah the word no
[1:13:58] matter how many Sensations you have
[1:14:00] still a child of Satan until you become
[1:14:02] dead to the world and alive in Christ
[1:14:04] are you with me now
[1:14:06] oh remember he's talking about that
[1:14:08] outer man the outer man is a slave to
[1:14:10] sin until you're born again
[1:14:12] it's in bondage to sin until you're born
[1:14:14] again don't knock the sinner because he
[1:14:16] sins that's what Sinners do
[1:14:18] that's just what they do I don't I don't
[1:14:20] look bad in a sinner because they sin
[1:14:22] that's Sinners we're going to do that
[1:14:23] they're going to get worse and worse and
[1:14:24] worse as time goes on but the Christian
[1:14:26] gets better and better and better
[1:14:28] what the sinner needs is to be born
[1:14:30] again
[1:14:33] they can't do that without the Life of
[1:14:34] Christ there have to be something there
[1:14:36] for them to do that and so we scattered
[1:14:39] the light knowing that there's some seed
[1:14:41] of God out there somewhere we wouldn't
[1:14:42] still be here
[1:14:45] Romans 6 8 now if we be dead with Christ
[1:14:47] we believe that we shall also live with
[1:14:48] him
[1:14:49] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:14:52] the dead dieth no more so death is not
[1:14:54] the end
[1:14:55] death hath no more dominion over him
[1:14:58] in that he died he died unto sin once
[1:15:00] but in that he liveth he liveth unto God
[1:15:03] likewise reckon you also yourselves to
[1:15:05] be dead indeed unto sin but not you're
[1:15:08] not just dead but you're alive unto God
[1:15:11] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:15:13] said before birth can come we realize
[1:15:15] there has to be death before birth and a
[1:15:16] birth is a mess he said I don't care
[1:15:18] what kind of a birth it is if it's in a
[1:15:19] pig pen whatever it is it's a mess and
[1:15:21] so it's the new birth it makes you do
[1:15:23] things that ordinarily you wouldn't
[1:15:25] think you would do
[1:15:27] but when you're ready to die to yourself
[1:15:29] then you're born again a new creature in
[1:15:31] Christ Jesus then things open up and
[1:15:33] life becomes a new sight to you because
[1:15:35] you've accepted the person not the
[1:15:38] person of William Branham not the person
[1:15:40] of Ben Pruitt but the person of Jesus
[1:15:42] Christ
[1:15:45] right I hope I can lead you and not lead
[1:15:47] you astray I hope that you'll follow me
[1:15:49] as I follow Christ I hope that you'll do
[1:15:51] that but you cannot you cannot become my
[1:15:54] disciple you cannot become a new
[1:15:56] creature and been through it you cannot
[1:15:58] be born again and accept the person of
[1:16:01] being Pruitt you've got to accept the
[1:16:02] person of Jesus Christ
[1:16:07] not some Theory or some Creed
[1:16:10] or even to the written word it's got to
[1:16:12] be quickened by the Holy Spirit
[1:16:14] he said no matter how much theology
[1:16:15] you've got it's laying there dead I
[1:16:18] could have a handful of weed until it
[1:16:19] gets into the process to where it can be
[1:16:21] quick and we will never live you can
[1:16:24] have a doctorate's degree a phll
[1:16:25] whatever you wish to but until the Holy
[1:16:27] Spirit comes upon that and quickens it
[1:16:30] to you as a personal experience with God
[1:16:32] then the wheat does no good your
[1:16:34] learning is in vain
[1:16:36] he said this Englishman the other night
[1:16:37] he said I was so astonished at that all
[1:16:39] the learning he had his father he had to
[1:16:41] forget all he knew in order to find
[1:16:42] Christ do things that he thought he
[1:16:44] wouldn't do but that's the way God does
[1:16:46] he humiliates us in our educational
[1:16:49] system
[1:16:50] he said not as I'm trying to support
[1:16:52] ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the
[1:16:53] difference
[1:16:54] education can never bring life it takes
[1:16:57] the spirit of God to bring life and that
[1:17:00] life must not come out of just the
[1:17:01] intellectual Revival
[1:17:03] it's got to come out of the Bible word
[1:17:06] Revival notice how he separates the
[1:17:08] intellectual Revival from the word
[1:17:09] Revival and that word is the same
[1:17:12] yesterday today and forever when it
[1:17:13] falls today and quickens you get the
[1:17:15] same results you did in Acts 2. exactly
[1:17:18] it always has and always will be because
[1:17:20] it's the spirit of God that conditions
[1:17:22] that atmosphere
[1:17:24] the same results
[1:17:26] amen
[1:17:30] again
[1:17:31] you look at our children and say well
[1:17:34] they don't want to be in church of
[1:17:35] course not
[1:17:36] when they're little bitty they want to
[1:17:38] play they want to let them ever get born
[1:17:41] again of the spirit of God
[1:17:43] they'll drag you to church
[1:17:48] I just want them to be in that
[1:17:49] atmosphere
[1:17:51] the random said it takes atmosphere to
[1:17:53] do things he's continuing the same quote
[1:17:55] he said that's the reason you men are
[1:17:56] always taught bring your children here
[1:17:59] you men are always taught be a man
[1:18:03] bring your children to church
[1:18:06] don't send them bring them
[1:18:08] well certainly that's right he said I
[1:18:10] was glad to see my daughter Rebecca come
[1:18:11] in and sit down just a few minutes ago
[1:18:13] he said some of you see me wink at a
[1:18:15] woman it was my daughter so she came in
[1:18:16] and sat down now you remember because
[1:18:18] they'll reach an age you can't drag them
[1:18:19] no more
[1:18:21] right Rebecca had reached that age where
[1:18:23] you can't physically drag kids of a
[1:18:25] certain age Church
[1:18:27] it would be abuse
[1:18:32] I'll say this
[1:18:33] so you teach them right
[1:18:35] train them right when they're little
[1:18:37] they'll even come in when they're older
[1:18:39] and maybe they don't even know why
[1:18:40] they're there
[1:18:41] I don't know why I'm at church I've
[1:18:43] experienced that but my parents took me
[1:18:45] to church
[1:18:47] it was now his good church but it was
[1:18:48] church
[1:18:51] we went to baptist churches Methodist
[1:18:53] churches Pentecostal churches everything
[1:18:55] but Catholic churches
[1:18:57] we were in all kinds of trouble we were
[1:18:59] in church not three times a week four
[1:19:01] times a week five times a week camp
[1:19:02] meetings sometimes with Services three
[1:19:04] times a day we went to church so it's
[1:19:06] not difficult for me to go to church now
[1:19:08] yeah
[1:19:10] yeah right
[1:19:11] you train them and maybe someday
[1:19:13] they'll be sitting there almost an adult
[1:19:16] they're sitting there thinking what am I
[1:19:18] going to do with my life
[1:19:20] and all at once they they realize
[1:19:23] I I don't want to be a sinner
[1:19:25] seen what Uncle so and so did and and so
[1:19:28] and so on
[1:19:29] seeing what they did but I look at my
[1:19:31] mom and dad they're in church
[1:19:33] they're serving the lord I've seen how
[1:19:35] it changed their life I want that
[1:19:37] I see the example set in my home I see
[1:19:39] the example set at the church I want
[1:19:41] that
[1:19:42] I want to be a part of that
[1:19:45] and they'll at once they begin to get
[1:19:47] conviction in their heart and you see
[1:19:48] them start coming to an altar begin to
[1:19:49] pray what happens that that seed is
[1:19:51] dying that the outside the shell is
[1:19:53] dying
[1:19:54] because there's going to be new birth
[1:19:57] now you can't judge them because it's
[1:19:58] not they're not mature yet
[1:20:00] but still make mistakes be a lot of
[1:20:02] things happen between now and and that
[1:20:04] mature plant but you nurture that I want
[1:20:06] them to be in that atmosphere because if
[1:20:08] that seed ever rots to the outside and
[1:20:10] it gets even one little glimpse of the
[1:20:13] atmosphere it'll strike
[1:20:16] so we take them to meetings we take them
[1:20:17] to camps we we here in church we try to
[1:20:20] set the right kind of atmosphere because
[1:20:21] we want them we want them to be in that
[1:20:23] we we don't want to stay out of the
[1:20:25] house of God
[1:20:26] we want them here in the house of God
[1:20:28] and so brother Brown says some of he
[1:20:32] said you see me do that I wanted to
[1:20:33] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:35] he said that's why she is here in the
[1:20:37] meeting
[1:20:38] he said that's the purpose of it it
[1:20:40] takes atmosphere yes
[1:20:42] the Bible tells us that the carnal mind
[1:20:44] is enmity against God take something to
[1:20:46] change that
[1:20:48] is not subject to the law of God neither
[1:20:49] indeed can be and then and even in the
[1:20:51] Old Testament he said I want to give you
[1:20:53] a new heart and a new spirit but that's
[1:20:55] not the new birth he said then I'll put
[1:20:57] my spirit in you
[1:20:59] there's the new birth but the new heart
[1:21:01] and the new spirit is part of the
[1:21:02] process you've got to go through that
[1:21:04] you need to be in that atmosphere to go
[1:21:06] through that
[1:21:08] listen you have a new nature now you're
[1:21:10] not perfect but your desires have
[1:21:12] changed
[1:21:13] now
[1:21:14] you asked he said brother Brandon what
[1:21:15] kind of nature have you got then his
[1:21:17] nature
[1:21:18] if I had my father's nature I do the
[1:21:21] things my father did
[1:21:24] you ever think you ever been sad that
[1:21:27] your kids had your nature
[1:21:30] my mother said amen I don't know what to
[1:21:32] do about that
[1:21:35] it's the second time of the week I've
[1:21:37] got on to her for saying amen I got to
[1:21:38] quit that
[1:21:43] but
[1:21:48] oh no
[1:21:50] but my heavenly father has a nature
[1:21:53] and now and now they're born again he
[1:21:55] said it depends on who my father was
[1:21:58] the church you got
[1:22:01] to want to you call him anything you
[1:22:02] want to because he's your father but if
[1:22:04] your father is God and you're born in
[1:22:06] the family of God you seek those things
[1:22:07] and pertain to God then you are God's
[1:22:10] child your nature is God's nature
[1:22:12] then when somebody said oh you hear them
[1:22:14] some say oh our church believes that the
[1:22:16] days of Miracles has passed how could
[1:22:17] you believe the days of Miracles has
[1:22:19] passed when the very nature of God is in
[1:22:21] you when he is all together miracle
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] what is a miracle how do we explain it
[1:22:28] Wednesday night a miracle is something
[1:22:30] you can't explain something that has no
[1:22:32] answer to it something that no one can
[1:22:34] quantify It's Supernatural yet it's real
[1:22:38] and God you can't explain him it's he's
[1:22:40] in my thoughts are not your thoughts my
[1:22:42] ways are not your ways you can't explain
[1:22:44] him you can't quantify him but he's real
[1:22:47] Hallelujah he is all together miracle
[1:22:52] his Nature's Miracle is habits Miracle

[1:23:07] nature is a miracle how you can look
[1:23:10] back and say them things are dead this
[1:23:13] is right you're a new creature
[1:23:16] a new creation
[1:23:18] oh my Paul says therefore If any man be
[1:23:21] in Christ he is a new creature old
[1:23:24] things are passed away behold someone
[1:23:26] say all things
[1:23:28] Harvey come now
[1:23:30] you're a Believer the god of Miracles is
[1:23:34] your father
[1:23:36] oh my oh this ought to make us believe
[1:23:38] this I know it's been a little heavy but
[1:23:40] this ought to make us worship it ought
[1:23:41] to make us believe the god of Miracles
[1:23:44] is your father
[1:23:46] what does that mean to you you're a
[1:23:49] Believer the Bible says in Mark 16 these
[1:23:51] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:23:54] them that the god of Miracles is their
[1:23:56] father in my name shall they cast out
[1:23:59] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[1:24:01] they shall take up serpents if they
[1:24:02] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:24:04] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:24:05] and they shall recover
[1:24:08] Hallelujah you begin to believe God for
[1:24:11] Supernatural things because you're a
[1:24:13] supernatural being with a supernatural
[1:24:16] birth and now you sit in the house of
[1:24:19] God and you're not bored no more you're
[1:24:21] not you're not sitting there thinking
[1:24:22] about something else but you're that
[1:24:24] you're tuned into the word of God why
[1:24:26] because there's something about you
[1:24:27] that's changed and you realize I'm a
[1:24:29] child of a supernatural Anything could
[1:24:32] happen today have you ever walked into
[1:24:34] the house of God and said today all
[1:24:36] things are possible today anything is
[1:24:39] possible today I can receive my healing
[1:24:41] today my loved ones could come in today
[1:24:43] could be the day when my body will
