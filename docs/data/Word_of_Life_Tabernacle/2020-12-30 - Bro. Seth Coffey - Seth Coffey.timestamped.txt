[36:07] un to you Lord God because you are the
[36:09] only one God that is worthy to be
[36:11] praised Lord God lord we just ask that
[36:13] you would have your will in this service
[36:15] in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen
[36:19] I would like to take a title tonight the
[36:22] author and finisher of our faith Amen in
[36:27] Hebrews 12 1-2 it says wherefore sing We
[36:30] also are compassed about with so great a
[36:33] cloud of witnesses it says let us a lay
[36:35] aside every
[36:37] weight and the sin which doeth so easily
[36:40] beset us and let us run with patience
[36:43] the race that is set before us and here
[36:45] it is looking unto Jesus many people
[36:48] look under so many different things
[36:51] whether it be for Faith whether it be
[36:53] for wealth whether it be for so many
[36:54] things but you know that all those
[36:56] things just fade away it says heavens
[36:58] and earth will pass away but my word
[37:00] shall stay the same and the end of the
[37:02] beginning was the word and the Word was
[37:04] made flesh so we can look unto
[37:07] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[37:10] faith amen that's a sure steadfast thing
[37:13] who for the joy that was set before him
[37:16] endured the cross despising the shame
[37:18] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[37:21] Throne of God Amen you may be
[37:24] seated I um I was trying to figure out
[37:28] kind of what what to speak on and didn't
[37:32] thought I had something that I was going
[37:33] to speak on and it just seemed like the
[37:35] Lord really wasn't in it you know you're
[37:38] sitting there and just kind of thinking
[37:40] throughout the week and yesterday me and
[37:42] brother Ben met for lunch and and and
[37:45] you know it's just funny how the Lord
[37:46] Works things out because all the places
[37:49] that brother Ben asked me to go he asked
[37:51] me to meet me at this one place and it
[37:53] was some place on the lake and or some
[37:56] place called that on the lake I can't
[37:57] remember what it was but but when it did
[37:59] the Carol was on like I believe it was
[38:00] but it took me through this place and I
[38:02] looked up on this on this hill and I
[38:04] remembered about nine or 10 years ago I
[38:07] was 15 years old and 25 now so I guess
[38:09] that'd be 10 years I I came by this way
[38:12] I just had gave my heart to the Lord not
[38:15] long before that back home in North
[38:17] Carolina and and I seen that waterfall
[38:19] and when we was in my mind and when we
[38:21] got done eating I went back to that
[38:24] waterfall and I began to climb that
[38:26] waterfall and and just like I remembered
[38:28] it was you know all those years ago and
[38:31] and got up to the top and look around
[38:33] and and I began to turn around and and
[38:36] look back Across The View and it just
[38:38] something hit me and and you begin to
[38:40] think oh God I'm a young Christian I
[38:43] understand that but I've been serving
[38:44] the lord for 10 years now and and I look
[38:47] back at that and I said oh God all all
[38:50] the things Lord that that I've been
[38:52] through not not that I've been through a
[38:53] lot of hurt or a ton of those things but
[38:55] we can all say we've been through trials
[38:57] right and I I begin to look back and I
[38:59] said God everything that I ever went
[39:01] through but Lord you kept
[39:04] me I begin to look back at everything
[39:07] and you know I begin to think you know
[39:08] Lord if you would have shown me in this
[39:10] spot everything that I would have had to
[39:13] go through at that time to get where I
[39:15] am today brother Ben I don't know if I
[39:16] could have took it actually I know I
[39:18] couldn't have took it in that moment
[39:20] true but God who was rich in Mercy thank
[39:22] you Lord we begin to look at that I
[39:24] begin to look at that place and
[39:27] something came over me and I said oh God
[39:29] thank you so much Lord God and something
[39:31] came over me he is the author and the
[39:33] finisher of your faith see God doesn't
[39:36] start a work in somebody not to finish
[39:38] it amen and you understand the thing
[39:40] about an author is nobody else can say
[39:42] they wrote this book but the
[39:44] author so it doesn't really matter what
[39:46] anybody says about your life it doesn't
[39:49] really matter what anybody tries to talk
[39:51] about your life the author and the
[39:53] finisher of your life has the final say
[39:55] of what goes on in your life amen so I
[39:58] began to look at that and and as our
[40:00] brother was singing I remember when I uh
[40:02] I first gave my heart to the Lord and I
[40:03] think it was like the next day or so I
[40:05] was sitting in the church I had a
[40:06] wedding to go to and I remember the
[40:08] first scripture I ever read out of my
[40:09] Bible and it said he said unto me my
[40:11] grace is sufficient for thee for my
[40:14] strength is made perfect in weakness
[40:16] most gladly therefore I will rather
[40:17] glory in my infirmities that the power
[40:19] of Christ May rest upon me I am so glad
[40:22] Saints of living God that his power his
[40:25] strength was made perfect in my weakness
[40:27] cuz I can tell you 10 years of that I
[40:29] never had my own strength I never could
[40:31] do it on my own as a person as a man I
[40:34] fail from day to day but there is an
[40:35] anchor inside of the soul that the
[40:37] author has put in there that each and
[40:39] every day we can go through this life
[40:41] with Victory because it's not our
[40:42] strength but he is our
[40:45] strength glory to the Living God it says
[40:48] ye are of God little children and have
[40:51] overcome them because greater is he that
[40:53] is in you on than he that is in the
[40:56] world I I think too many times the
[40:58] reason that we mess up brother Ben is we
[40:59] put too much pressure on oursel to get
[41:01] it done we get too much we put too much
[41:03] pressure on oursel to accomplish the
[41:05] things of God but I believe if we could
[41:07] just let go and let the strength of God
[41:10] take over our lives we could accomplish
[41:12] more in a few seconds in the presence of
[41:14] God than we could do in a
[41:16] lifetime Lord glory to the Living God he
[41:19] said for he said I will never leave thee
[41:22] nor forsake thee hallelujah praise God
[41:26] church thank the Lord sitting there in
[41:28] that moment there was many
[41:29] times that maybe I felt
[41:32] forsaken amen can we say that there's
[41:35] many times and we felt
[41:37] alone but in that moment when you get to
[41:39] your weakest point on and you feel like
[41:42] you can't go any further sweet presence
[41:45] of the Lord just sweeps in says I will
[41:48] never leave you nor forsake
[41:51] you and many people you know this is
[41:54] this is this is a year and we heard our
[41:57] brother preach on the worst year of our
[42:00] lives and it's it it's it's something
[42:03] that we've never seen it before I guess
[42:06] maybe since the world wars back in the
[42:08] day that something can be gripped
[42:11] worldwide you were you were not exempt
[42:13] from this everyone was in
[42:16] this and and I sat there and I began to
[42:18] say how did we how did we stand through
[42:20] 2020 you know there was many people that
[42:23] that walked away from the message there
[42:25] was many people that gave up come on but
[42:28] how did you stand through 2020 and then
[42:31] it began to hit me because 2020 wasn't
[42:33] your author come
[42:35] on it wasn't your author everything that
[42:39] Satan could throw at you wasn't your
[42:41] author it says for he sayith to Moses I
[42:43] will have mercy on whom I will have
[42:46] mercy and I will have compassion on whom
[42:48] I will have compassion so then it is not
[42:50] him that willth nor of him that runneth
[42:53] but of God that showeth Mercy you never
[42:57] held yourself I never held myself but
[42:59] there was a God that showeth Mercy do
[43:01] you know how grateful you should be in
[43:02] this age of 2020 when everybody has
[43:05] turned down God and everyone has just
[43:06] let things go and everybody has walked
[43:08] over this message but you have found
[43:11] Mercy in the eyes of God that you can
[43:13] serve God that you can believe this
[43:15] message in the last days when people
[43:16] call it garbage and when people turn it
[43:18] around but to you it's the Rapture and
[43:20] grace of God and it's bringing you
[43:21] closer and closer to God each and every
[43:23] day of your life because you have found
[43:25] Mercy in the eyes of God Oh Glory to God
[43:28] I'm going to go ahead and say it because
[43:29] before the found the lamb wasn't slain
[43:31] for you yesterday right on before the
[43:34] very foundation of the world we see that
[43:36] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[43:38] of the world and you were there with him
[43:39] what did it say in job where were you
[43:41] job when the sons of God shouted for Joy
[43:43] before the foundation of the world you
[43:45] had representation by predestination
[43:47] glory to God you had found Mercy with
[43:49] God not on any particular day but before
[43:51] the foundation of the world God said
[43:53] they are an overcomer he was the author
[43:55] of your faith and he will also be the
[43:56] Finish of your faith glory to God thank
[43:59] you Lord in the highest amen thank you
[44:02] Lord because the author the author held
[44:05] us the author was writing your story you
[44:08] know one thing I thought about it
[44:10] brother what you were preaching on and
[44:12] it goes right along with what he was
[44:14] saying but job never knew what was going
[44:18] on in heaven yeah but the author the
[44:20] whole time was just writing writing down
[44:24] job's life writing down what job was
[44:26] going to do job couldn't see what was
[44:27] going on we don't know what's going to
[44:30] happen tomorrow but we know who holds
[44:32] tomorrow thank you Lord there is already
[44:36] if I could put it this way there is
[44:37] already a written letter of your life
[44:39] written and read of the blood of the
[44:41] Lord Jesus Christ and as much as Satan
[44:44] wants to he can't change that
[44:46] writing he takes his he takes as an
[44:48] eraser but I don't know if you ever
[44:49] tried to take an eraser to a
[44:51] Sharpie it just don't
[44:53] work God Sharpie began to write down
[44:56] just
[44:58] Justified
[44:59] glorified they never done it in the
[45:01] first
[45:02] place and that's your story that the
[45:06] author has
[45:07] wrote thank you Lord it says here Jesus
[45:11] says all that the father giveth me shall
[45:15] come to me and him that cometh to me I
[45:17] will in no wise cast out for I am for I
[45:20] came down from heaven not to do my own
[45:22] will but the will of him that sent me
[45:25] and this is the father will which he has
[45:27] sent me that of all which he hath given
[45:30] me I should lose nothing come on but
[45:34] should raise it up again at the last day
[45:37] and this is the will this isn't our will
[45:39] now
[45:40] church this is the will of him that sent
[45:42] me that
[45:43] everyone which seeth the son and
[45:46] believeth on him may have everlasting
[45:48] life and I will raise him up at the last
[45:50] day Lord we have to come to a
[45:52] realization you know even though I know
[45:54] my personal testimony when I gave my
[45:56] heart to the Lord all all 10 years ago
[45:58] or however long I remember I was sitting
[45:59] there and it was brother Joel forny I'm
[46:01] sure most of y'all know him but he came
[46:03] by the church and he was preaching and I
[46:05] was on my way to church that evening and
[46:06] I was smoking on the way to church and
[46:08] and I was sitting there going you know I
[46:09] don't really know why I'm going to this
[46:10] I'm just going because my mom wanted me
[46:12] to so me and my sister went and and I
[46:15] began to sit there and I knew I was
[46:17] wrong when that brother started
[46:18] preaching but I wasn't I wasn't going to
[46:20] to give into that I was sitting there
[46:22] going no I'm not going up there and he
[46:24] started talking about the Holy Ghost and
[46:26] I said man I need that Holy Ghost but
[46:27] still I'm that's I'm not I'm not ready
[46:29] yet I'm too young I got to live my life
[46:31] a little bit before I get to that point
[46:33] and I remember sitting there and that in
[46:35] in about I don't know six or seventh Pew
[46:37] back and I was sitting there going I'm
[46:38] not going I'm not going next thing I
[46:40] know I see my body begin to stand up and
[46:42] my body began to walk out and even when
[46:44] I'm walking down to the front I said I'm
[46:46] not going I'm not going but by the time
[46:48] I got there he said what are you here
[46:49] for I said I've received the Holy Ghost
[46:52] words began to come out of my mouth that
[46:53] I didn't understand because it wasn't my
[46:55] will but it was God's Will and he begin
[46:59] to bring me in he begin to keep me
[47:00] because so many times we begin to try to
[47:03] keep
[47:04] ourselves but you were never the one
[47:06] that saved
[47:07] yourself it was Jesus Christ that saved
[47:10] you before the foundation of the world
[47:11] what did the prophet say he said you
[47:13] were never saved on any particular day
[47:15] he said you just realized you were saved
[47:18] glory to
[47:20] God Satan is not the author of your
[47:24] faith come on since he's not not the
[47:27] author you don't have to listen to
[47:29] him Satan didn't write this book he
[47:32] can't tell you what it
[47:34] means he can't tell you that Isaiah 54
[47:37] is not for you CU he didn't write the
[47:39] book he don't know what's behind the
[47:42] book
[47:43] right he says Satan says you'll never
[47:46] make it you know I think it's funny
[47:48] Satan is always against us but for some
[47:51] reason we always lend an ear to him yeah
[47:55] that's how miserable of a human ity is
[47:58] we know someone is completely against us
[48:00] but yet we listen to him over and over
[48:04] again he tells you you're not good
[48:05] enough over and over again he tells you
[48:08] you'll never make it and for whatever
[48:10] reason we have decided hey let's not
[48:13] listen to the one that died for us let's
[48:16] listen to the one that's lying to us
[48:18] ever since the
[48:20] beginning it's a sad thing but I know
[48:23] we're all guilty of
[48:25] it but I say it's time to stop listening
[48:27] to him come on it's time to stop
[48:30] listening to his lies because he is not
[48:31] the author of your
[48:35] faith it says this is what God says
[48:38] about you he says talk about a
[48:41] Thanksgiving he said I feel real good
[48:44] I'm more thankful for that than anything
[48:46] I know of you are the pure you virtuous
[48:49] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[48:51] God every man and woman that's born of
[48:54] the spirit of God and washing the blood
[48:55] of Jesus Christ and believes every word
[48:58] of God stands as though he never sinned
[49:00] at the first place you are the
[49:02] perfect you are perfect the blood of
[49:05] Jesus Christ he said how can I if I was
[49:08] supposed to die in the morning and a man
[49:10] took my place I cannot die for that sin
[49:14] somebody took my place glory to God
[49:16] church do you not realize that day after
[49:18] day after day Satan is constantly going
[49:21] to God and accusing you of things that
[49:22] you've done and accusing you of what you
[49:24] did this morning and accusing you of
[49:26] what you did yesterday and God begins to
[49:28] look through that blood Veil and he
[49:29] begins to see all he can see is his son
[49:32] he doesn't see your sins he doesn't see
[49:34] what you've done now I'm not legalizing
[49:36] sin don't go around doing things you
[49:37] ain't supposed to if you're
[49:38] predestinated you won't be doing those
[49:40] things but he begins to look he begins
[49:43] to I love that he begins to try to
[49:45] accuse you over and over and over and
[49:47] guess what he gets added to him another
[49:48] thing of false accusation of the brother
[49:51] glory to God each day he's getting
[49:52] longer and longer in the pits of Hell
[49:55] come on he's adding to his sentence
[49:57] every day more and more and more by
[49:58] falsely accusing you glory to
[50:02] God I begin to think of that when I
[50:05] begin to think of who we listen to and
[50:07] why we listen to you look at shamgar in
[50:08] the Bible and year after year after year
[50:11] he would see the Philistines coming and
[50:13] he knew every time they were coming they
[50:15] were coming to take his god-given
[50:17] rights they were coming to take his land
[50:21] coming to take his crops each and every
[50:23] year and surely each and every time he
[50:25] came up the Philistines be to come they
[50:27] say you know Shemar you're not strong
[50:28] enough for this just get out of the way
[50:29] and take let me let me take your crop
[50:32] and year after a year they kept coming
[50:35] and kept taking his crop over and over
[50:37] and over and over and over
[50:40] again many times we're like shamgar and
[50:42] we get caught up in
[50:44] Cycles over and over and over again but
[50:48] I want to tell you something there has
[50:49] to be a time when you break that
[50:51] cycle there has to be a time where you
[50:53] say enough is
[50:55] enough and shamgar begin to realize he
[50:58] said I'm I'm a circumcised Seed of
[51:00] Abraham which means in our day full of
[51:02] the Holy Ghost Lord shamgar was full of
[51:04] the Holy Ghost and he began to realize
[51:07] this is my land that's my family I this
[51:09] is my promise samgar wasn't going to
[51:11] take it anymore listen Church you don't
[51:13] have to live with what Satan's lying
[51:15] about you CU let me tell you something
[51:16] he's not the author nor the finisher of
[51:18] your faith God is the finisher of your
[51:20] faith so shamgar shamgar just begin to
[51:22] take what he had take you a little
[51:24] scripture one time when you're sick get
[51:25] you Isaiah 5 four go ahead and take it
[51:28] and say the Lord God is my healer by his
[51:30] stripes I am healed the Lord heals all
[51:32] my diseases you can begin to take that
[51:34] and you can begin to take your Ox goat
[51:35] and say Satan enough is enough because
[51:39] you are not the author of my faith you
[51:41] are not the finisher of my faith but
[51:42] Jesus Christ is the author of my face
[51:44] and Jesus Christ is the author of my
[51:47] glory he's the finisher of my faith
[51:49] glory in the most
[51:51] high you look at job and everything that
[51:53] he went
[51:54] through everything that he went through
[51:57] it was a lot worse than what we go
[51:59] through from day to
[52:00] day it was the worst the worst scene
[52:03] we've ever seen outside of
[52:05] Christ all the things that he went
[52:07] through and how did he not give up or
[52:09] how did he why didn't he just give
[52:12] up right because look at the author come
[52:15] on he won't curse me to my face he Satan
[52:19] says oh he'll curse you to your face
[52:20] he's a perfect
[52:22] man thank you Lord many times we're
[52:25] going through the trial but God has has
[52:26] already made preparation for the trial
[52:29] we don't see what's going on in the
[52:30] moment but before the trial ever
[52:32] happened God has already made
[52:34] preparation you say when last week no
[52:38] before the foundation of the
[52:40] world glory to
[52:43] God and I want you to notice this is
[52:46] this is really the text that I wanted to
[52:47] get
[52:49] to I want you to notice that what
[52:53] caused the Revelation to come out of job
[52:57] was the
[52:59] trial that's
[53:02] true we go through this life and and it
[53:04] it's sad to say but you don't we don't
[53:08] call out to God on our good days like we
[53:10] call out to God on our bad
[53:12] days when everything's going great we
[53:14] might say a two-minute prayer I thank
[53:16] you Lord for for the blessings on
[53:18] me and we take off but when you really
[53:22] hit a trial and your world's falling
[53:25] apart that's deeper than
[53:27] yourself that goes beyond what you can
[53:29] do and what you can
[53:31] accomplish it comes to a point where it
[53:34] brings something out of you something
[53:37] along the lines of for I know my
[53:40] redeemer
[53:42] liveth he had these questions I want you
[53:45] to realize job had these questions
[53:47] before the trial ever
[53:49] started but he got his
[53:52] answer at the worst time at the worst
[53:55] time is God begin to come in that's when
[53:59] you get desperate with God in
[54:01] desperations brother Brenham says it's
[54:04] sad that it takes an emergency for us to
[54:07] get
[54:08] desperate and I've said this to brother
[54:10] Ben I said you know sometimes God will
[54:12] let Co come if you're not going to get
[54:14] desperate in your own little world he'll
[54:16] shake the whole world and he'll make you
[54:20] desperate he said for I know my redeemer
[54:22] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[54:25] latter day upon the Earth and though
[54:27] after my skin worms destroy this body
[54:29] yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I
[54:31] shall see for myself and my eyes Shall
[54:34] Behold and not another though my Reigns
[54:37] be consumed within me I like what
[54:41] brother Ben said that didn't stop his
[54:43] trial but it gave him a revelation to
[54:46] get through the trial Lord God will give
[54:49] you what you need to get
[54:51] through Lord I'd like to read this very
[54:55] familiar scripture and I TI all things
[54:57] work for the bride's good and we know
[55:00] that all things somebody say all things
[55:02] all work together for good to them that
[55:06] love God and to them who are called
[55:08] according to his purpose for whom he did
[55:11] Forno he also did predestinate to be
[55:14] conformed to the image of his son that
[55:16] he might be the firstborn among many
[55:17] Brethren moreover whom he did
[55:19] predestinate them he also called and
[55:21] them whom he called them he also
[55:23] Justified and whom he justified them he
[55:25] also glorified what shall we say then to
[55:28] these things if God be for us who can be
[55:30] against us who shall separate us from
[55:33] the love of Christ shall tribulation or
[55:36] distress or persecution or famine or
[55:40] nakedness or Peril or sword as it is
[55:43] written for thy sake we are killed all
[55:46] the day long we are accounted as sheep
[55:48] for the slaughter nay in all things we
[55:51] are more than conquerors through him
[55:54] that loved us for I am persuaded that
[55:56] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[55:58] principalities nor powers nor things
[56:00] present nor things to come nor height
[56:04] nor dep nor any other creature shall be
[56:06] able to separate us from the love of God
[56:10] which is in Christ Jesus our lord thank
[56:12] you Lord I want you to notice it shall
[56:14] not be able to separate us but that
[56:16] don't mean it ain't going to be
[56:18] there many times we look at a prosperous
[56:21] life but that's not what the Christian
[56:23] walk is look at Paul look at Peter look
[56:25] at all these men beaten thrown in prison
[56:28] come on but that wasn't what it was
[56:31] about what was it about was when you
[56:33] could read those stories and you could
[56:35] look back at the Bible and you could
[56:36] look at those things and you say those
[56:39] men really believe what they said they
[56:41] believed and then you begin to catch the
[56:43] Revelation I have the same Holy Ghost
[56:46] they have brother Ben and if they can
[56:47] grow go through that there is nothing
[56:49] that can separate me from the love of
[56:52] Christ thank you Lord because I want you
[56:55] to realize
[56:57] the trial is what brings out the best in
[57:02] you brother bam says this about Fanny
[57:05] Crosby he said blind Fanny Crosby who
[57:09] was tortured through her life by
[57:11] scornful hands and making fun of her
[57:14] because she wouldn't write worldly songs
[57:17] what thank you f Fanny Crosby let's call
[57:19] you here and what do you think of him
[57:23] whose son is he what does he mean to you
[57:25] Fanny cros
[57:27] yeah and when she picked up of the pen
[57:29] she
[57:29] wrote pass me not
[57:34] oh savior it says hear my humble cry
[57:38] while on others thou are calling do not
[57:40] pass me by thou the stream of all my
[57:42] comfort more than life to me whom have I
[57:45] on Earth beside thee or whom in heaven
[57:49] but thee you Lord why did Fanny Crosby
[57:52] write all those songs why did she do
[57:55] what she did because in her
[57:59] blindness she realized the
[58:01] need for our savior thank you Lord many
[58:05] people say that's not fair look at the
[58:07] songs that we have look at how many
[58:09] altar calls there's been by oh pass me
[58:11] not oh gentle savior look at all the
[58:13] people that were saved because of the
[58:15] Affliction of that
[58:16] person we look at so many things and we
[58:19] begin to wonder why this why me why did
[58:22] this happen but behind the veil come on
[58:26] look at her condition scorn you think
[58:29] being blind would be bad enough but then
[58:30] they made fun of her they scorned her
[58:33] but what did it do it only brought out
[58:34] the music Hallelujah it only brings out
[58:37] the music in your life when people begin
[58:40] begin to criticize you and make fun of
[58:42] you for what you believe or what you're
[58:44] doing there's something deeper on the
[58:45] inside of you that goes past yourself
[58:48] and it begins to bring out the music it
[58:50] begins to bring out the life of Jesus
[58:51] Christ on display thank you
[58:54] Lord but we would have never known it
[58:57] had it not been for the trial that we
[58:58] were going through if everything would
[59:00] be perfect in our life you just go about
[59:03] through life you don't give God the time
[59:05] that he needs he
[59:06] deserves amen when things are going
[59:10] great you don't give him what he
[59:13] deserves but he begins to come in and he
[59:16] permits Satan as he did job he permit
[59:20] Satan to come in your life and start
[59:22] flipping things around to where you find
[59:24] your place
[59:27] to where you're on your knees going God
[59:29] I need you again many times we look at
[59:32] the flesh as a bad
[59:33] thing but really if we never had this
[59:36] flesh we wouldn't know the need that we
[59:37] had for God true I heard my pastor
[59:40] preaching one time and he started
[59:41] talking about you know you look at these
[59:43] athletes that only have one Limb and you
[59:45] know have to have a a bionic leg or
[59:47] something like that or a midle leg and
[59:49] and they have these things and and you
[59:51] know there's those that feel sorry for
[59:54] themselves they feel feel sorry for
[59:56] themselves and they begin to waste their
[59:57] themselves away they begin to say
[59:59] there's no hope for me but other ones
[1:00:01] will begin to use that as inspiration
[1:00:03] and other ones will begin that to use
[1:00:05] that they don't use it as a crutch but
[1:00:06] they use it as something to say
[1:00:08] inspiration to work harder and try
[1:00:11] harder and strive harder for the
[1:00:14] goal
[1:00:17] amen I thought of this today when I was
[1:00:19] up there studying and and you know on
[1:00:21] the way up you always going into
[1:00:23] Arkansas you got to think about the
[1:00:24] blind girl and Jonesboro that
[1:00:26] that the Lord restored her sight and I
[1:00:27] was looking for something completely
[1:00:29] else different and the Lord let me let
[1:00:31] me use it so I'm so thankful for that
[1:00:32] but I begin to think
[1:00:36] of the blind girl in Jonesboro and we
[1:00:39] look at that and we begin to say that's
[1:00:41] such a sad thing that she was
[1:00:44] blind but we realize that when we look
[1:00:47] at we look at her and we look at her
[1:00:49] situation and here's a blind girl that
[1:00:51] had I mean I have a daughter and unless
[1:00:55] she runs off somewhere I ain't going to
[1:00:56] lose her you know when I'm in a storage
[1:00:58] you stay right here but her own father
[1:01:01] had lost her could you imagine not being
[1:01:03] able to see anything and your own father
[1:01:06] has lost you knowing and my daughter
[1:01:09] ain't blind but he knew the condition of
[1:01:10] his
[1:01:11] daughter and he lost
[1:01:14] her so talk about feeling all alone
[1:01:16] literally can't see and then she begins
[1:01:19] to lose the faith in humanity because
[1:01:21] she's bumping into everybody trying to
[1:01:23] find her father no it seems
[1:01:28] pitiful and she's beginning to to try to
[1:01:32] find and people are bumping into and
[1:01:33] maybe she gets knocked down a couple
[1:01:35] times and and she keeps on going because
[1:01:37] she's trying to find her
[1:01:40] daddy how
[1:01:42] pitiful and then here's brother brandom
[1:01:44] over here walking trying to get in and
[1:01:46] some guy being rude so to speak says hey
[1:01:50] quit
[1:01:51] pushing so here's a man that could have
[1:01:53] lost his temper at this man right and
[1:01:55] here here's a trial he's facing and even
[1:01:58] that that that blind girl maybe should
[1:01:59] have been staying back here with her
[1:02:01] father but instead she begins to venture
[1:02:03] over
[1:02:04] here and begins to attract the attention
[1:02:07] of a Prophet come on because of her
[1:02:10] trial yeah because of her trial brother
[1:02:14] Brandon begins to notice she's she's
[1:02:15] looking around old daddy old daddy she's
[1:02:18] beginning to cry in
[1:02:20] desperation but if it wasn't for her
[1:02:24] trial come on she would have never ended
[1:02:28] up at the
[1:02:30] prophet and she begins to come to the
[1:02:34] prophet and I love the faith that is
[1:02:37] found
[1:02:39] there we know the whole story but she
[1:02:43] says you get me to the Healer yeah I'll
[1:02:46] go find my daddy
[1:02:49] lord it's in a time of desperation
[1:02:52] Church
[1:02:54] on that are trial letter straight to the
[1:02:58] prophet Hallelujah and brother Brandon
[1:03:00] began to pray for you know using his
[1:03:04] hand back then and he felt the sensation
[1:03:06] in her hand of that cataracts in there
[1:03:08] and when it left he said look up at me
[1:03:11] and open your eyes and she did and she
[1:03:12] was
[1:03:13] restored and I begin to look at that
[1:03:15] brother stort and I begin to think you
[1:03:17] know that was great for that girl but
[1:03:20] you know what it did for me brother Ben
[1:03:21] through her trial there could be a blind
[1:03:23] girl walk through that building come on
[1:03:26] and I could look at her and say Jesus
[1:03:27] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:03:30] forever and if that girl's eyesight
[1:03:33] could be restored then this girl's
[1:03:34] eyesight could be
[1:03:36] restored we look at our trials and we
[1:03:38] look at everything that we go through
[1:03:40] and we don't understand that why we're
[1:03:41] going through it when we're going
[1:03:42] through it but people can look at us and
[1:03:46] go they've got something real how is it
[1:03:49] that they can go through thing after
[1:03:50] thing after thing and they're still
[1:03:52] standing
[1:03:57] and yet it seems so unfair but the
[1:03:59] author has wrote it out the whole time
[1:04:03] we don't understand
[1:04:05] it brother brandham says it was Moses
[1:04:08] after being also in the line of his
[1:04:09] Royal seed the Seed of Abraham that when
[1:04:12] he was sent down into Egypt to deliver
[1:04:15] the children of Israel and God had give
[1:04:17] him signs and wonders to perform and to
[1:04:19] Smite the Earth and to bring forth frogs
[1:04:21] and fleas and darkness and hell and rain
[1:04:24] and fire and and all these Miracles yet
[1:04:26] when he led them out by the hand of
[1:04:28] Jehovah there come a time when come a
[1:04:33] time pardon me when he met the gate
[1:04:36] between him and the promised land there
[1:04:38] was the Red Sea a bar across the way
[1:04:43] they were hemmed in by Pharaoh's Army
[1:04:45] mountains and deserts and red sea but
[1:04:47] Moses stepped forward and possessed the
[1:04:49] Gate of his enemy and cross the Red Sea
[1:04:52] dry shot and he was walking on Dusty
[1:04:55] Road
[1:04:56] he shall possess the Gate of the enemy
[1:04:58] God said so and it settled it was only a
[1:05:01] few years later now when the Trials come
[1:05:05] and the church God All Shook Up as is so
[1:05:08] easy for a Congregation of people to do
[1:05:10] when something just doesn't seem to
[1:05:11] happen the way it's supposed to be God
[1:05:13] makes it that way many people don't like
[1:05:16] this but God brings tension into the
[1:05:19] church every son that cometh to God must
[1:05:22] be tried and proven and tested he let
[1:05:24] sickness strike you he lets diseases
[1:05:28] come on you to test you and to prove you
[1:05:31] to show the world that you are truly the
[1:05:34] Seed of Abraham come on church it's not
[1:05:38] so much proven to you who you are
[1:05:40] sometimes it's proven to the world that
[1:05:43] you are the Seed of Abraham
[1:05:46] Hallelujah he permits it by his own will
[1:05:49] he permits
[1:05:50] disasters he permits the friends to turn
[1:05:53] against you he permits all these things
[1:05:57] and turns the devil loose to tempt you
[1:06:01] and he'll do it all but take your life
[1:06:04] he could throw you on a bed of
[1:06:05] Affliction he can turn your neighbors
[1:06:07] against you he could turn the church
[1:06:09] against you he can do most anything and
[1:06:12] it's God's will for him to do it we are
[1:06:15] taught that it is more precious than
[1:06:18] gold to
[1:06:21] US these things are what identify us as
[1:06:24] the sons and Daughters of God anybody
[1:06:27] can live a happy life with no trials on
[1:06:30] you know I remember one time I was up in
[1:06:32] Virginia and and there was a there was a
[1:06:35] fruit it was a pair we took some peirs
[1:06:37] up there for the deer and and I seen
[1:06:39] this this beautiful pair and it had no
[1:06:41] no it had nothing wrong with it it just
[1:06:43] looked perfect and I picked it up and I
[1:06:45] bit into it but it was bitter as could
[1:06:48] be because it was immature it never been
[1:06:52] through anything it never been through
[1:06:53] any trials but then I said this old
[1:06:57] pair and it was had little bruises and
[1:07:00] everything else over it and I grabbed it
[1:07:03] and bit into it and it was just as sweet
[1:07:04] as could
[1:07:05] be and it reminded me of our savior he
[1:07:09] was beat all to
[1:07:12] pieces but yet he went ahead with it
[1:07:14] because it was the will of the father we
[1:07:16] look at that trial could you imagine
[1:07:18] could you imagine the apostles looking
[1:07:21] at that going why does my savior have to
[1:07:23] go through this
[1:07:25] could you imagine them sitting there
[1:07:27] they didn't really understand what was
[1:07:28] going on they're going why does he have
[1:07:30] to do why are they treating him like
[1:07:32] this why if surely if they could they
[1:07:34] would run in there and they would stop
[1:07:35] the trial they would stop everything
[1:07:37] that he was going through they would go
[1:07:38] in there and they would rip him off the
[1:07:41] cross but what if they would
[1:07:46] have come on that was the worst trial
[1:07:49] there ever was in The Garden of
[1:07:51] Gethsemane bleeding blood from his
[1:07:53] forehead
[1:07:55] the worst trial there ever was the
[1:07:57] Temptation that he was under In The
[1:07:58] Garden of Gethsemane where blood
[1:07:59] literally started to drop from his
[1:08:03] forehead how could that be the will of
[1:08:05] God they're wondering we can look back
[1:08:07] at the story now and see how it was the
[1:08:09] will of God but put yourself in the
[1:08:11] moment how could that be the will of God
[1:08:15] that this man that has done absolutely
[1:08:17] nothing
[1:08:19] wrong he doesn't deserve what he's going
[1:08:22] through the trial that's set before him
[1:08:25] and they're sitting there in the garden
[1:08:26] with him going why is he just call why
[1:08:28] is he praying so hard why is he going
[1:08:30] what he's going through he's the son of
[1:08:31] God why he just why don't he just take
[1:08:33] this trial away from him why doesn't he
[1:08:36] just speak this trial away from himself
[1:08:37] come on
[1:08:39] Church they don't understand what's
[1:08:42] going on through the trial but beyond
[1:08:44] that he's
[1:08:46] looking and he says because of the joy
[1:08:48] that sit before
[1:08:50] me he endured the cross Lord he began to
[1:08:54] see his trial and begin to embrace his
[1:08:56] trial come on because it wasn't his will
[1:08:59] but it was the will of the father but
[1:09:02] through that trial we found salvation in
[1:09:04] the moment in the midst of that trial we
[1:09:06] would begin to say no take him down
[1:09:08] don't beat my Lord don't do these things
[1:09:10] he shouldn't go through that but through
[1:09:12] it all we found our very salvation
[1:09:14] through his trial
[1:09:16] hallelujah thank you Lord and it's our
[1:09:19] trials we don't understand the sickness
[1:09:22] we don't understand the hurt on I
[1:09:25] guarantee you one thing Brother David
[1:09:27] understands healing better now than he
[1:09:29] did before the trial come on he could
[1:09:32] say I love Brother David I met him years
[1:09:34] ago but he could say before the trial I
[1:09:36] believe God's A Healer brother Ben he
[1:09:38] could say I believe God's A Healer but
[1:09:39] until he was in that spot to where he
[1:09:42] realized his life was on the line on to
[1:09:45] he realized I need God cuz I can't do
[1:09:47] this myself he got to that point and
[1:09:51] Jehovah come on oh my Jesus Christ came
[1:09:55] in the room and they said you're not
[1:09:56] going home for a week but he's going
[1:09:58] home he's home today thank the Lord now
[1:10:01] he can sit there through his trial and
[1:10:03] say hey if you got Co I know a Healer
[1:10:06] Hallelujah because through his trial he
[1:10:08] gained the victory thank the
[1:10:12] Lord hallelujah your trials are what
[1:10:15] identifies you thank the Lord do you
[1:10:17] realize that we would not have we
[1:10:19] wouldn't we wouldn't care about the
[1:10:20] story of David if there was not a
[1:10:22] Goliath right that's true big deal God
[1:10:25] becomes king no
[1:10:28] problems he's the king of all Israel but
[1:10:31] what we like about David is we say this
[1:10:33] man defied the the odds through his
[1:10:36] trials he began there begin to be a line
[1:10:40] that rose up against him and you know
[1:10:42] like I said in the church why don't you
[1:10:44] just try to picture me wrestling a line
[1:10:46] but picture me a foot
[1:10:48] shorter and I'm going to go fight a
[1:10:51] line and what seemed impossible it was a
[1:10:54] trial of Faith but David already had a
[1:10:58] revelation David had already been
[1:11:00] anointed to go to the throne so he said
[1:11:03] you know what Satan it doesn't matter
[1:11:05] what you do with this line I have to get
[1:11:07] to the throne and this line is between
[1:11:08] my th me and royalty and I want you to
[1:11:11] realize tonight Church you are
[1:11:13] predestinated and anointed by the
[1:11:14] message of the hour to go to royalty so
[1:11:17] I want you to know it doesn't matter
[1:11:19] what stands in your way between now and
[1:11:20] royalty you just take your knife out and
[1:11:23] you slay it just as David did if there's
[1:11:25] a bear in your way knock it down if
[1:11:27] there's a line in your way knock it down
[1:11:28] if it's the biggest trial of your life
[1:11:30] and it's Goliath all you need is a
[1:11:31] simple stone get you faith in Jesus and
[1:11:34] begin to swing that thing and when the
[1:11:36] devil gets closer just knock him down
[1:11:38] come on but we wouldn't care about David
[1:11:41] if it wasn't for his trials we wouldn't
[1:11:43] know what victory was if it wasn't for
[1:11:45] defeat
[1:11:47] on what was brother Ben saying he said
[1:11:50] the suffering of this life when he was
[1:11:52] talking about his father makes me know
[1:11:53] that there's something over there with
[1:11:54] no
[1:12:01] suffering thank
[1:12:04] Lord praise the Lord
[1:12:08] Church being confident this very thing
[1:12:10] that he which hath begun a good work in
[1:12:12] you will perform it to the day of Jesus
[1:12:15] Christ Church we go through many things
[1:12:17] in this life there's many things we
[1:12:20] don't understand why we go through them
[1:12:22] I've been there I give my heart to the
[1:12:24] Lord next thing I know I'm caught up in
[1:12:25] false
[1:12:27] Doctrine but the trial that I went
[1:12:30] through there I put my faith in in in a
[1:12:34] in a man instead of the faith in the
[1:12:37] word and now I could look back at that
[1:12:40] trial now and I go God because in the
[1:12:42] moment I'm going God why do I have to go
[1:12:44] through this why is there so much hurt I
[1:12:46] haven't done anything to anybody and
[1:12:48] people hate
[1:12:49] me because I felt in my heart to
[1:12:52] leave people hate me people people
[1:12:55] calling me Serpent seed all these
[1:12:58] different things God why did I have to
[1:13:00] go through that but now I know God
[1:13:04] showed me I don't have faith in a man
[1:13:06] anymore I have faith in the word of God
[1:13:09] I have faith in the message of the hour
[1:13:11] because if I walk away for being that
[1:13:14] don't affect you when you have faith in
[1:13:16] the word if you walk away come on that
[1:13:19] don't affect me that's right CU see
[1:13:22] brother Ben wasn't my absolute nor am I
[1:13:24] his absolute abolute come on but the
[1:13:26] word of God is our absolute Hallelujah
[1:13:29] and God is the author and the finisher
[1:13:31] of our faith thank you Lord so each
[1:13:34] trial that we go through tomorrow when
[1:13:36] you wake up you know what let me tell
[1:13:37] you something you might have a problem
[1:13:39] with temper and you say Lord deliver me
[1:13:42] of this temper your boss man's going to
[1:13:44] get on you tomorrow yeah come on boss
[1:13:48] man's going to give you the worst time
[1:13:49] that you ever had and and you sit there
[1:13:51] and you're trying to rise up and God
[1:13:53] said but I thought you want to delivered
[1:13:54] of that thing yeah
[1:13:56] and again and again and again and then
[1:13:57] you maybe you'll blow up and you say God
[1:14:00] I realized I can't do it and I'm trying
[1:14:01] to do it on my own and just like that
[1:14:05] they'll deliver you from
[1:14:07] it but we don't we don't understand the
[1:14:11] trial in the
[1:14:13] moment but I want you to understand even
[1:14:15] though we don't we don't understand
[1:14:17] what's going on in the moment I want you
[1:14:19] to realize brother brandom had a
[1:14:21] gift he could see Visions he could see
[1:14:24] these things he had a prophetic gift but
[1:14:26] just because there's not a sear here
[1:14:29] doesn't mean the vision isn't still
[1:14:31] going
[1:14:32] on there's many things in this building
[1:14:35] right
[1:14:36] now that none of you can
[1:14:38] see but yet there is
[1:14:40] a the Holy Ghost is dealing with that
[1:14:43] one over there and the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:44] speaking to this one over here and the
[1:14:47] person over there just got healing
[1:14:48] because how did he know that about me
[1:14:50] all that time all those trials I was
[1:14:52] going through about that temper that
[1:14:54] makes sense now
[1:14:55] God just showed me through that there's
[1:14:57] so many things but I want you to notice
[1:14:59] that woman that was the woman that was
[1:15:02] had a baby you know in Mexico her little
[1:15:05] baby had died but in
[1:15:09] desperation in her desperation to get to
[1:15:12] the Healer or to get to get to brother
[1:15:14] brandham to get to Jesus we understand
[1:15:16] all these things but in her desperation
[1:15:19] to get there it wasn't that she could
[1:15:21] walk up to the front row she began to
[1:15:23] have to fight Imagine This Church
[1:15:25] someone someone in church just trying to
[1:15:28] get prayed for and everyone is pushing
[1:15:30] her back everyone is beginning to push
[1:15:33] her back and not let her come forth but
[1:15:37] in her desperation she continues to
[1:15:39] fight and continues to go and continues
[1:15:41] to push and it begins to cause the
[1:15:44] vision to take
[1:15:45] place and in her desperation as she
[1:15:48] begins to cry out she touches
[1:15:52] God but you know what made her realize
[1:15:55] that God could raise her
[1:15:57] baby I believe it was a blind man that
[1:16:01] had his eyesight restored that man's
[1:16:04] trial through the healing of his
[1:16:08] eyes made her realize that my baby could
[1:16:13] live again Hallelujah and how many
[1:16:15] people had heard the story of how the
[1:16:17] baby lived again would come to the
[1:16:19] message messages of the meetings later
[1:16:21] and be able to say I I know that that
[1:16:23] baby was raised back to life and and I
[1:16:25] have a baby what is it I believe it's
[1:16:27] called the water head baby where they
[1:16:29] kept the head was just so big they said
[1:16:31] I know if you if if God could do that
[1:16:33] for that baby he could do that for my
[1:16:36] baby on trial after trial after trial
[1:16:40] Satan is not showing his power as we
[1:16:42] think but God is showing his power
[1:16:45] through your trial thank you Lord when
[1:16:49] people look at you and your world is
[1:16:50] turned absolutely upside
[1:16:53] down and they don't understand
[1:16:55] understand how you keep going come
[1:16:57] on but you
[1:17:00] do and you know as I was saying when I
[1:17:02] was standing on that waterfall and I was
[1:17:04] looking
[1:17:05] across at those times I could not go
[1:17:08] through every trial that I was going to
[1:17:09] go through brother stew I couldn't have
[1:17:11] handled it at that time I was still a
[1:17:13] pair that was
[1:17:15] bitter but trial after trial I don't
[1:17:19] have the problems I used to brother Ben
[1:17:21] yeah the things that once I struggled
[1:17:23] with you begin to
[1:17:27] overcome and the next trial makes you
[1:17:30] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[1:17:34] stronger in Rapture
[1:17:38] Lord I think it's therefore I would
[1:17:41] rather glory in my infirmities knowing
[1:17:43] that the power of God May rest upon
[1:17:47] me you see Church many times we look at
[1:17:50] our trials as a bad
[1:17:52] thing but see God is going to put you
[1:17:55] where you need to be see he has wrote
[1:17:57] the book he has wrote the story of your
[1:18:01] life and as much as we don't like it if
[1:18:04] he needs to get that temper out of us
[1:18:06] he's going to say boss
[1:18:08] man and put you through it to get you
[1:18:10] where you need to
[1:18:11] be because he is the
[1:18:14] author and he is going to make sure that
[1:18:17] we are where we need to be but it's not
[1:18:19] that your trials are not not even
[1:18:21] necessarily something that you've done
[1:18:24] but God is going to put you to a place
[1:18:26] where you need to be because God is more
[1:18:29] concerned I don't want to say God isn't
[1:18:31] concerned about your friends he is
[1:18:32] concerned about your friends but he's
[1:18:34] not going to be concerned about your
[1:18:35] friends when your friends are what is
[1:18:37] keeping you from a body
[1:18:39] change come on if you have too many
[1:18:44] friends that you're talking to them
[1:18:45] instead of talking to the Lord he'll
[1:18:48] pull those away from you to get you
[1:18:50] where you need to be with him because
[1:18:51] he's not he don't care about how many
[1:18:53] likes you have on Facebook
[1:18:55] he don't care about how many friends you
[1:18:56] have on
[1:18:57] Facebook he cares about if you and your
[1:19:00] children are born
[1:19:02] again he cares about if you're living an
[1:19:05] overcoming life because let's face it
[1:19:07] things in this life don't
[1:19:10] matter men's life is but a
[1:19:13] vapor we get so many days in this life
[1:19:17] and then it's
[1:19:19] over we put way too much emphasis on
[1:19:22] this life it don't matter how many life
[1:19:24] we get on Facebook come on no matter how
[1:19:27] many people liked your picture on
[1:19:29] Instagram or or all these different
[1:19:31] things or how successful you can be in
[1:19:33] this life are you born
[1:19:35] again that's are you ready for a
[1:19:39] Rapture and if you're not when the fiery
[1:19:42] Trials come upon you it's more precious
[1:19:46] than gold for
[1:19:48] you God CU see I remember when I was 14
[1:19:52] years old and I told my mom I was going
[1:19:53] to be a preacher and she said no you're
[1:19:55] not and I said yes I am she said no
[1:19:57] you're not because she she knew all the
[1:19:59] pain that came with being a minister
[1:20:01] because her dad was a pastor but I said
[1:20:03] you know what's the funniest thing to me
[1:20:05] that Satan we look at Satan and we're so
[1:20:07] scared of him and and all these
[1:20:08] different things but he's just a tool in
[1:20:10] the hand of God on and I said one day
[1:20:12] I'm gonna I'm yet to do it but I said
[1:20:14] one day I'm going to preach a sermon on
[1:20:16] Satan a tool in the hand of God because
[1:20:19] what's so Satan time and time again this
[1:20:24] is the funny thing about Satan how how
[1:20:25] dumb he is he puts us through trials and
[1:20:29] every time he puts you through something
[1:20:31] you come out better than you were before
[1:20:32] the trial yeah and so because of that
[1:20:35] he's going to put you through a harder
[1:20:36] trial yeah to try to break you but then
[1:20:39] he makes you even better Christian on
[1:20:43] but because that didn't work he's going
[1:20:44] to put you through an even harder
[1:20:47] trial and before you know it you're
[1:20:49] going to be sitting there and you're
[1:20:50] going to go he's going to do everything
[1:20:51] that he can to beat you down everything
[1:20:53] that he can to break break you but in
[1:20:55] the midst of your trial when you come to
[1:20:56] your desperate point at the end of your
[1:20:58] trial when you come to desperation and
[1:21:00] the vision takes place you'll say I know
[1:21:03] my redeemer liveth because you get to a
[1:21:05] point brother Ben that you realize I
[1:21:07] couldn't hold myself all this time I
[1:21:09] couldn't have done it I couldn't have
[1:21:11] overcame those things I should have gave
[1:21:13] up but greater is he that is in you than
[1:21:15] he that's in the world Hallelujah glory
[1:21:17] to God can't we see it Church of the
[1:21:19] Living God Apostle Paul all the
[1:21:21] Christians he killed and all the things
[1:21:22] that he did but One Moment In the
[1:21:24] presence of that life completely changed
[1:21:26] him to where he was ready to kill people
[1:21:28] to where he was ready to give his life
[1:21:30] for that message that identifies to us
[1:21:33] that Paul is a true Messenger but if
[1:21:35] Paul never went through that trial he
[1:21:37] would never be able to say oh death come
[1:21:40] on where is your
[1:21:42] Victory oh death where is your sting oh
[1:21:44] grave where is your victory that trial
[1:21:47] identified to us that Paul had something
[1:21:50] greater Lord he was trying to follow
[1:21:52] follow the law of the Jews in the Old
[1:21:54] Testament and kill all these Christians
[1:21:56] but because of that trial it sparked
[1:21:57] something on the inside of him it
[1:21:59] brought out the music like it did Fanny
[1:22:01] crossby through the trial thank you Lord
[1:22:04] through the trial brings the music thank
[1:22:05] you
[1:22:07] Lord musicians come back I don't know
[1:22:10] how long I
[1:22:11] preached
[1:22:14] but God is going to do what God has to
[1:22:17] do to get you where you need to
[1:22:20] be and like I said it's not necessarily
[1:22:24] because you did did something
[1:22:25] wrong but if you need something but
[1:22:28] don't be hateful for the trial be
[1:22:31] thankful for the trial Lord
[1:22:34] because you have come to such a point
[1:22:37] where you're so beat down and you're so
[1:22:39] broken that you fall at the Master's
[1:22:41] feet and right there you find that
[1:22:44] that's your true absolute that's your
[1:22:46] only friend that's the one that's there
[1:22:49] for you and you realize God in the midst
[1:22:52] of my trial I didn't understand what was
[1:22:54] going on I didn't know what I was going
[1:22:57] through but looking back I can see all
[1:22:59] the things that you brought me through
[1:23:01] and all the things how many can look
[1:23:03] back at your life and go Lord I can see
[1:23:05] all the things that you bought brought
[1:23:06] me through and It's Made Me Stronger
[1:23:08] where God I know if I had to go through
[1:23:10] that I could go through it I could do it
[1:23:13] again because God brought me through it
[1:23:15] the first time I can do it
[1:23:17] again so let's not be so in we can
[1:23:20] remember the trials that we went through
[1:23:23] but what about the trials of tomorrow
[1:23:26] tomorrow what about the trials of next
[1:23:28] week what if 2021 is twice as bad as
[1:23:32] 2020 we can look back and say God held
[1:23:34] me through 2020 yeah he can hold me
[1:23:36] through 2021 and if 2021 is twice as bad
[1:23:40] if Satan is dumb enough again yeah to go
[1:23:43] let's make 2021 twice as hard as 2020
[1:23:46] then you'll have a bride that's twice as
[1:23:47] strong as they were in 2020 thank you
[1:23:49] Lord and if he decides to do it again in
[1:23:51] 2024 you'll have a bride that's four
[1:23:53] times as strong
[1:23:57] because the trials only bring out the
[1:24:04] music my God is

[1:25:28] you as if as I was listening to the
[1:25:29] prophet on the way up here I was
[1:25:30] listening to the Jonesboro series and I
[1:25:32] can't remember what he was dealing with
[1:25:33] but he said Hey sir you in the back with

[1:25:37] trouble if you don't want it to be that
[1:25:39] way anymore it don't have to just accept
[1:25:40] it and I thought man brother Ben it

[1:28:48] the Holy Spirit has a way of just moving
[1:28:50] and speaking directly to our hearts and
[1:28:52] this is the last opport Unity that we'll
[1:28:54] have as a church in this year and and I
[1:28:59] I just want us to thank God for the
[1:29:01] things that he's done for us this year
[1:29:03] he's done some great things we've come a
[1:29:05] long ways since January 1 and I want us
[1:29:11] to thank God for that and and in each of
[1:29:13] your own lives you can look and maybe
[1:29:15] you've been through a lot and you can
[1:29:16] say God kept me he kept me I've been
[1:29:20] through the trial I've been through the
[1:29:22] fire but he's kept me now it's the end
[1:29:25] of the year and it's it's time to turn
[1:29:27] the page over to a new year but if he
[1:29:29] kept me this year like the brother said
[1:29:31] he'll keep me in the next year that much
[1:29:34] more if the trials are worse and we pray
[1:29:36] that they're not but if the trials are
[1:29:38] worse next year he'll keep me in the
[1:29:40] next year let's just talk to God for a
[1:29:42] minute and each of you in your own way
[1:29:44] and just just offer a prayer for the new
[1:29:46] year that's coming in and and just thank
[1:29:49] him for what he's done Heavenly Father
[1:29:52] we thank you Lord for bringing us this
[1:29:54] far Lord as the children of Israel could
[1:29:57] say after they'd walked through the Red
[1:29:59] Sea on Dusty roads Lord that you brought
[1:30:03] us this far and the old song says if you
[1:30:06] brought us you didn't bring us this far
