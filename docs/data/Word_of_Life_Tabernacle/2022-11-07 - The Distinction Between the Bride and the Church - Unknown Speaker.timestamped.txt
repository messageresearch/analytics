[42:35] communion but uh we're several of us are

[42:43] we're we're just going to do the
[42:45] communion part and then we've got a
[42:47] wedding rehearsal I think this afternoon
[42:49] some of us do so that'll be uh that'll
[42:52] be good I almost forgot about that we
[42:54] weren't able to have church this morning
[42:56] I hate calling off church but they had
[42:58] to uh power outage here and the power
[43:01] actually come on right about church time
[43:03] but at that point we had had to make a
[43:05] call so so we did that and and uh but
[43:08] I'll be honest with you I probably
[43:10] couldn't have come and stood up here
[43:11] this morning I wasn't uh feeling very
[43:13] good and my wife blessed her heart she's
[43:17] home I can't ever remember Britney
[43:19] staying home from church and the entire
[43:21] time we've been married so she's not
[43:23] feeling well she all remember her in
[43:25] your prayers I know there's just so much
[43:27] sickness going around seems like we all
[43:30] uh coven took over for a couple years
[43:32] now the flu's back so but uh you know
[43:35] God is still a Healer do you believe
[43:37] that
[43:38] uh he's still a Healer he's the same
[43:40] yesterday today and forever and I can
[43:43] feel already and I enjoyed the music so
[43:45] much and several several folks are gone
[43:46] I
[43:48] um Joel is over at Wendell's preaching
[43:51] over there today you remember him he was
[43:54] sick last night and I had to preach two
[43:56] services today and and uh so brother
[44:00] Allen's out with some of the boys out in
[44:01] the woods somewhere and uh so it's just
[44:04] just life you know and and I think
[44:07] brother Stewart and them are have all
[44:08] been sick so but so it's my lot to stand
[44:11] here this afternoon so we're going to
[44:13] suffer through amen so you support me
[44:15] this afternoon and then we'll get
[44:17] through it Titus Chapter 2 and verse 13
[44:20] looking for that blessed hope and the
[44:23] Glorious appearing of the great God and
[44:26] our Savior Jesus Christ
[44:28] who gave himself for us aren't you glad
[44:32] that he gave himself for you that he
[44:35] might redeem us from all iniquity and
[44:39] purify unto himself a peculiar people
[44:45] zealous of good works
[44:47] amen he said these things speak and
[44:49] exhort and rebuke with all authority let
[44:52] no man despise me I pray the Lord with
[44:54] that is blessing to the word you may be
[44:55] seated
[45:00] this really isn't much of a sermon but
[45:02] just a thought that I had and I wanted
[45:04] to bring it to you and to those who are
[45:07] watching as well that are at home
[45:09] I
[45:11] often think about the difference between
[45:13] the bride and the church and what it
[45:16] means to be the bride and how we can
[45:19] tell that we are the bride we want to be
[45:21] the bride we don't want to be the Church
[45:23] of this world we want to be the Bride of
[45:26] Jesus Christ and yet you can't make
[45:28] yourself bride my wife could not make
[45:30] herself my bride I had to choose her to
[45:33] be my bride and she had to choose me but
[45:36] we cannot make ourselves the bride of
[45:38] Christ because we didn't have the
[45:40] capacity of choosing it was all Grace
[45:43] and you didn't choose Grace Grace
[45:46] thought you Grace chose you and and it
[45:49] come down to where you were come down to
[45:52] the bar stool or come down to the church
[45:54] or come down to wherever that you were
[45:56] to the family that you were in and Grace
[45:59] picked you up and elevated your life and
[46:01] lifted you up over above the things of
[46:03] the world oh aren't you glad for that
[46:05] Grace today Grace unmerited favor of God
[46:09] that that could bring you up out of all
[46:11] the things of the world and and and you
[46:14] had nothing to do with that and and and
[46:16] and so as we look at the difference
[46:19] between the bride and the church the
[46:20] bride it's grace to the bride there's
[46:23] something that has been given to her
[46:25] she's been chosen and I think about the
[46:28] vision that brother Branham had uh that
[46:31] we know as the preview of the Bride
[46:34] and that Vision that he saw on Friday
[46:37] July 3rd 1964 in Jeffersonville he said
[46:42] and I'm taking this from the Masterpiece
[46:45] the very first time that brother Branham
[46:47] tells us this Vision was two days after
[46:49] he had it
[46:50] and he said July the 3rd I was over here
[46:53] sitting in the center over here shopping
[46:55] the center right out from us here
[46:57] he said I never seen so much gum and
[47:01] filth in my life as I see among some
[47:03] people I wonder what a prophet would
[47:05] think today in the age that we live in
[47:08] and the things that we see we've just
[47:10] gotten used to it and and and become
[47:13] almost almost immune to it but but he
[47:17] looked out there and you can imagine a
[47:19] man who lived the way that he did and
[47:21] and lived in in that realm and that
[47:24] prophetic realm and he's watching these
[47:26] these women and these people and the way
[47:28] that they're acting he said I've never
[47:30] seen so much gum and filth as I see
[47:33] amongst them people he said I sit there
[47:35] till my heart ached and the Lord had
[47:37] gave me a vision he said I fell into a
[47:40] trance and when I did there was somebody
[47:41] with me I want you to notice that
[47:43] there's somebody with me he said I
[47:46] didn't see the person it was just a
[47:48] voice he said I looked and as I looked
[47:51] this way he said the bride will come in
[47:54] view for preview
[47:56] and I looked coming to me it must have
[47:59] been such a refreshing sight for the
[48:01] prophet as he's seen all the the women
[48:03] of the world and coming through that
[48:05] shopping mall and he said I look coming
[48:07] to me and I seen the most prettiest
[48:09] bunch of clean dressed women that I've
[48:12] ever seen in my life now there's
[48:15] something about a vision you got to
[48:16] understand he's not seeing the actual
[48:19] people of the Bride he's this is not uh
[48:22] going beyond the curtain of time but
[48:24] this is where he's seeing a symbol a
[48:26] woman or woman who are a symbol of the
[48:29] Bride they they're symbolizing something
[48:31] and and so but he said they were clean
[48:34] dressed and he said they were the most
[48:37] clean dress I'd ever seen in my life now
[48:39] we know that they were symbolizing
[48:40] something because there's men in the
[48:42] bride right we're part of the Bride too
[48:46] and uh but uh but here he saw just women
[48:49] because it's a symbol women are churches
[48:51] and so he said each one of them looked
[48:55] like was dressed different and so that
[48:57] was churches from or women from
[49:00] different parts of the world he said
[49:02] they all had long hair
[49:03] and they were longer sleeves and skirts
[49:07] and so forth he said young women they
[49:09] looked kind of I'd say about maybe 20.
[49:13] he said she was looking right at said
[49:15] the one was the one was talking to me
[49:17] and I was standing together so here's
[49:19] this person this unseen person standing
[49:22] by him
[49:23] and and it was talking to him and the
[49:27] woman or the women were looking at them
[49:29] and he said her eyes she was the
[49:32] cleanest sweetest looking people I ever
[49:36] seen in my life he said look like it
[49:39] could have been a dozen or more said I
[49:42] just don't know how many was abreast but
[49:43] they were just in a group of them and
[49:46] she passed by sweetly with the air with
[49:50] an air or an attitude or a way that she
[49:52] carried herself and he said and her eyes
[49:55] up watching well I believe this is the
[49:58] hour we need to have our eyes up
[49:59] watching hey man he said watch and pray
[50:02] and you won't enter into temptation he
[50:04] said when you see these things begin to
[50:06] come to pass look up your Redemption
[50:08] draweth night aren't you glad for that
[50:11] this afternoon to hear this bride was
[50:13] walking she had her eyes up watching and
[50:17] so as she passed by oh she was beautiful
[50:20] oh she was beautiful I think we need to
[50:23] looking at ourselves the way God looks
[50:26] at us he said she was beautiful
[50:28] he said I looked at her and as she
[50:31] passed by he said now we shall review he
[50:34] said that's the bride now we will review
[50:36] the churches now he's going to get a
[50:39] different picture
[50:41] he's going to see a different group of
[50:43] people
[50:44] and he said and they they come he said I
[50:48] noticed them coming up and when they
[50:49] come up each one looked like got worse
[50:52] we've seen that haven't we
[50:54] he said I never seen such a filthy bunch
[50:57] in my life
[50:58] and then it was pointed out to him and I
[51:01] thought it was interesting that here
[51:02] come a group that was identified by
[51:04] nationality the bride was not identified
[51:07] by nationality they were each one of
[51:10] different nationality dressed in a
[51:12] different way but they were all walking
[51:13] together
[51:15] but these Church were not walking
[51:17] together they were walking according to
[51:19] the nation they come from and so now
[51:22] here here was this American church he
[51:24] said Here Comes the American group he
[51:28] said I heard a noise and that's usually
[51:30] the American group he said Here Comes
[51:33] the American group he said now I am an
[51:35] American but this made me sick
[51:38] he said I'm not eloquent enough in a
[51:41] mixed audience to say what was taking
[51:42] place
[51:44] you'll have to read between the lines
[51:45] when the women were coming the leader of
[51:47] them was a witch I had a great long nose
[51:49] and a great big mouth
[51:51] now again think spiritually it's you
[51:54] know I think about it like this well if
[51:57] that's the way the bride is going to be
[51:59] then all the bride has to be beautiful
[52:00] well there will be ugly people in heaven
[52:03] I'm going to heaven but the Bill's going
[52:05] to heaven I mean
[52:09] praise God you know there will be ugly
[52:12] people in heaven and
[52:14] and uh but but it's a type he sees us as
[52:17] beautiful
[52:19] he sees this as beautiful and here was a
[52:21] woman a great long nose a great big
[52:22] mouth but the random said she was the
[52:24] Council of churches
[52:26] who she was he said and all of them was
[52:28] dressed with some kind of a lower close
[52:30] down here he said but the top just had a
[52:33] strap just a little about a half inch
[52:35] strap that moved up and went around them
[52:36] like this each woman had something on
[52:39] order he said they had something holding
[52:40] below them like this holding below them
[52:42] all this part was exposed and you can't
[52:45] even I the mental picture is just awful
[52:47] that he's drawing and he said Each one
[52:50] had a hair cut up real short and Frizzy
[52:52] looking things all over it like that
[52:54] real short cut hair and full of makeup
[52:57] absolutely nothing but look like street
[52:59] prostitutes and they were walking with
[53:02] this paper he sent him the vulgarity he
[53:04] said now the paper was what was holding
[53:06] in front of them but when they passed
[53:08] the review stand in the back of them to
[53:10] see the way they were going on in their
[53:12] foremost in their back part and how they
[53:14] were acting I said is that the church
[53:19] oh my and there she went and they were
[53:23] singing this here twist and roll songs
[53:25] you know or ever what you call going
[53:28] down seeing that and going by
[53:32] I said is that the church
[53:35] and I was standing there
[53:37] and in my heart I was crying
[53:40] he said they went off to the left and
[53:43] disappeared in chaos
[53:46] that's that's where we're at church
[53:49] that's where we're at we're we're seeing
[53:52] the church disappear in chaos
[53:56] and still beating this music and making
[53:59] real funny sounds and shaking their
[54:01] bodies one side and then the other side
[54:03] and like that carrying on like that
[54:05] walking
[54:07] and I just started to bow my head
[54:10] now remember there's one standing by him
[54:12] and he said well or he said wait
[54:16] oh my the bride must come again
[54:20] now he goes on to explain that this was
[54:22] the purpose of this Vision By the way
[54:24] was to show that the bride comes twice
[54:29] right and the Alpha and the Omega bride
[54:32] so now he said she must come again the
[54:35] bride must come again and I looked and
[54:38] here they come again
[54:39] and they passed by a sweet looking
[54:42] little lady they was all looking right
[54:45] at me as they passed by and I noticed
[54:48] each one was dressed different and one
[54:51] in the back had kind of long hair
[54:52] hanging down had it rolled around like
[54:54] this might have been German or something
[54:56] like that and I watched them and then as
[54:58] they started leaving two or three of
[54:59] them in the back kind of get out of step
[55:02] and I was going to holler at them and
[55:05] they was trying to get back in Step
[55:06] again
[55:07] it was trying to get back in Step again
[55:09] and I seen them just the vision Fade Out
[55:12] and changed from me now
[55:17] what's the distinction between the two
[55:19] think about it look at the differences
[55:21] between the two here's the bride clean
[55:24] dress no makeup longer sleeves and
[55:26] skirts Walking In step like a lady
[55:29] the church filthy dressed makeup nearly
[55:32] naked dancing to rock and roll two
[55:35] different groups completely
[55:38] right two different groups completely
[55:41] but but what was the one thing that
[55:43] distinguished them
[55:46] was it the clothes
[55:48] was it the music
[55:50] was it the longer sleeves or the longer
[55:53] skirts
[55:54] what's the one thing I think about it
[55:57] because if the bride could be
[56:00] distinguished by long sleeves and long
[56:04] skirts
[56:06] and no makeup the bride would could be
[56:09] the Amish
[56:12] right right
[56:16] could be the old the Holiness people
[56:17] that I grew up with around
[56:19] if that's the bride now are you seeing
[56:23] where I'm where I'm going where I'm what
[56:24] I'm thinking about tonight
[56:26] what was the distinguishing thing
[56:28] because just just that alone and that
[56:31] was who they are but it's it's because
[56:33] they were the bride that they walked
[56:36] like that because they were the bride
[56:39] they dressed like that because they were
[56:41] the bride they marched to that beat that
[56:44] they marched to and and they had that
[56:46] certain uh that that certain air about
[56:48] them because they were the bride
[56:51] oh my and again you can't choose to be
[56:55] the bride you can't make yourself not
[56:57] bride
[56:58] aren't you glad for that by your own
[57:01] stupidity you can't make yourself not
[57:03] the bride
[57:04] I'm so happy for that
[57:06] oh my and so here but here they were
[57:09] marching and and you say well what was
[57:12] the difference now
[57:14] the way they were dressed and carried
[57:15] themselves was a symbol of who they were
[57:17] but it did not make the ultimate
[57:19] difference
[57:20] Now watch how did the prophet know the
[57:22] difference let's go back back to the
[57:25] vision
[57:26] remember someone was standing by his
[57:28] side
[57:30] and as I looked this way he said
[57:33] the bride will come
[57:36] now watch the one standing by his side
[57:38] pointed out
[57:40] this is the bride
[57:43] I think church we need to quit looking
[57:46] at what everybody else says about us we
[57:49] need to quit looking for approval from
[57:51] other groups other people we need to
[57:53] quit looking for approval what does he
[57:55] say
[57:58] what does he say about you not what your
[58:01] friends say about you know what the
[58:03] church says about you not what even the
[58:05] pastor says about you not even what a
[58:07] prophet would say about you
[58:09] but what did he say
[58:12] right he's standing there by the bride
[58:14] and I've never caught this until I begin
[58:16] looking at it the other day because
[58:18] there's this idea that well if I do
[58:21] certain things well I'm going to somehow
[58:23] move myself out of this group into this
[58:26] other group no what he has designated
[58:28] this group is the bride
[58:31] these people are the bride
[58:34] right this is it
[58:36] this is and it's why I get people talk
[58:38] about message people and kind of talk
[58:40] down to message people and I I kind of
[58:42] get uh a little bit uh irritated at that
[58:45] because message people the bride is
[58:48] going to be around the message people
[58:50] you're not gonna get a bride out of the
[58:51] Baptist Church
[58:52] not all the message people are bride
[58:55] but the where's the bride going to come
[58:57] from they got to come from somewhere
[58:59] come out of the message people
[59:01] and so in that group and and so that
[59:04] group's been designated this is the
[59:06] bride he said
[59:09] right he identified who who made a
[59:12] profit of profit in our day he come down
[59:15] and said your message will forerun the
[59:17] coming of the Lord what is it he said
[59:21] oh my that's what we ought to be looking
[59:23] at what happened when you got the Holy
[59:24] Ghost the baptism the Holy Ghost he said
[59:27] you were the bride
[59:29] are you with me now it was a
[59:31] confirmation of your faith he said I'm
[59:33] the bride I don't care what the
[59:35] neighbors say I don't care what the
[59:37] people down the street say I don't care
[59:39] what the people on Facebook say he said
[59:41] I'm the bride
[59:43] are you with me now he said it and and
[59:46] so we should quit looking at what
[59:48] everybody else does and what everybody
[59:49] else says sometimes we look at another
[59:52] group of people and say well you know
[59:54] their sleeves are too short they must
[59:56] not be the bride
[59:57] they sing contemporary songs they must
[59:59] not be the bride they do certain things
[1:00:02] that we don't do but again those things
[1:00:04] were not
[1:00:06] they were what the bride was but what
[1:00:09] made them bright is he said
[1:00:12] he identified them as the bride
[1:00:16] I believe that's what he wants to do how
[1:00:18] does he do that by the baptism of the
[1:00:20] Holy Ghost
[1:00:21] and then brother Brandon would put it
[1:00:22] this way he said if God gave him the
[1:00:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost then he gave
[1:00:25] her the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:00:26] said then he gives the Holy Ghost to
[1:00:28] those who obey him
[1:00:30] right so you can't you can't have a
[1:00:33] conflict between the two you can't say
[1:00:34] Well they're not they're not worthy
[1:00:36] they're not no if he gave it to them
[1:00:38] that's between them and God
[1:00:40] and so again there may be certain things
[1:00:43] you could do that would identify you
[1:00:44] with that church group and certain
[1:00:46] things that might identify you with that
[1:00:48] bride group
[1:00:49] but you got to be careful
[1:00:51] because when you're looking at this
[1:00:53] church and you're looking at this bride
[1:00:56] when you see the ones in the bride
[1:00:58] getting out of Step
[1:01:00] you might look at them and say well
[1:01:01] that's not the bride
[1:01:03] that's the church
[1:01:05] but you got to be careful about that
[1:01:07] because you're talking about his wife
[1:01:10] right and the bride getting out of step
[1:01:12] is still bright
[1:01:14] always will be bride
[1:01:17] they will never walk over and join that
[1:01:19] other group one's going up one's going
[1:01:21] down
[1:01:23] are you hearing me today that takes all
[1:01:25] the worry and the scare and the fear out
[1:01:27] of it
[1:01:28] and he said I'm the bride God gave me
[1:01:32] the Holy Ghost I believe the message of
[1:01:34] my hour wasn't just a feeling or an
[1:01:36] emotion but he sealed me
[1:01:38] he sealed me by the Holy Ghost and if he
[1:01:40] did then I I am the Bride of Jesus
[1:01:43] Christ if I'm the bride I can't be
[1:01:45] changed from that into another but
[1:01:48] preachers will use that you know and and
[1:01:50] I'll preach it myself because we like to
[1:01:53] we like to hold our groups together and
[1:01:55] to do that what we do is we say well you
[1:01:57] know this other group look at them they
[1:01:59] they do things that we don't do and so
[1:02:01] they must not be the bride and really
[1:02:03] what all the preacher is doing is trying
[1:02:05] to hold the people in their own group
[1:02:08] huh but really the bride is who God said
[1:02:15] I'm so glad he said that in my weakness
[1:02:18] in my struggles in life when I can't
[1:02:20] seem to do what I would want to do I I
[1:02:23] looked the other day I think I've
[1:02:24] preached all but two Wednesday nights
[1:02:26] here at the church all year I I've been
[1:02:29] I've been here and I'm not bragging
[1:02:30] about that it's just I shouldn't do that
[1:02:33] it's hard on me physically but that's
[1:02:35] what we've done and I uh two or three
[1:02:37] Wednesday nights that I missed all year
[1:02:38] and I got to are not missed but didn't
[1:02:40] preach and I got to looking at that and
[1:02:42] I thought you know uh you know that's I
[1:02:45] want to do more I want to do better than
[1:02:47] that and I I feel like I don't I'm
[1:02:49] inadequate but I'm his bride I belong to
[1:02:52] him and and in my own inadequacies I I
[1:02:55] want him to step in and say you're the
[1:02:58] bride you you are who I came for and
[1:03:01] that's what he's done
[1:03:03] so we shouldn't be we come down to
[1:03:05] communion we shouldn't be afraid to take
[1:03:06] communion
[1:03:08] because you can't move from this one
[1:03:09] group to the other get back in line
[1:03:12] and take communion
[1:03:14] get back in line come back to church
[1:03:16] I don't you're not going to be moved
[1:03:18] over in this other group you're the
[1:03:19] bride you belong to God
[1:03:22] my kids May mess up they may do things
[1:03:24] that are bad but but you're the bride
[1:03:27] get back in line I'm never going to put
[1:03:29] you in this other group
[1:03:31] oh I don't even have that it's not even
[1:03:34] enter into my mind that you'd be in this
[1:03:36] other group God gave me my children to
[1:03:38] be in the bride
[1:03:39] hey man oh aren't you glad that you
[1:03:43] you're a part of that group that's going
[1:03:44] up
[1:03:46] right amen
[1:03:48] now brother Branham talks about Moab and
[1:03:50] Israel and I'm almost done I'm almost
[1:03:53] I have to be done but
[1:03:55] but brother Brown talks about Moab which
[1:03:58] represents a natural denomination in
[1:03:59] Israel which represents a spiritual
[1:04:01] church
[1:04:02] he talked about how they both offered
[1:04:04] the same sacrifice and built seven
[1:04:05] altars and offered a clean sacrifice he
[1:04:08] said fundamentally they were both
[1:04:10] exactly the same what was the difference
[1:04:12] in them
[1:04:13] fundamentally both right but you see
[1:04:16] Moab did not have the Vindication of God
[1:04:18] with them they were only a nation a
[1:04:21] group of celebrities but Israel had a
[1:04:23] prophet with them they had a cement and
[1:04:26] rock with them they had a pillar of fire
[1:04:28] they had a brass serpent for healing
[1:04:30] they had the blessings of God moving
[1:04:33] right along with them and they was the
[1:04:35] called out children of God and no matter
[1:04:37] how bad they were they could never be
[1:04:39] moabites
[1:04:42] you understand that it could never be
[1:04:45] moabites no matter how bad they were
[1:04:47] they were the called out children of God
[1:04:49] in fact here's what David says about him
[1:04:51] he said when they went from one nation
[1:04:53] to another from one Kingdom to another
[1:04:54] people he suffered no man to do them
[1:04:57] wrong
[1:04:59] oh you think he cares about his bride
[1:05:01] today brother Brown would get up and
[1:05:03] he'd say it's you he said if I held in
[1:05:05] my hands a charger uh something that
[1:05:07] contained the actual blood of Jesus he
[1:05:10] said but I hold him in my hand something
[1:05:11] more precious he said the purchase of
[1:05:13] that blood which is greater than the
[1:05:15] blood itself
[1:05:17] is the purchase of the blood which is
[1:05:18] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:05:20] he said he said he suffered no man to do
[1:05:23] them wrong yeah he he reproved Kings for
[1:05:26] their sake saying touch not mine
[1:05:28] anointed do my prophets no harm we use
[1:05:30] that for preachers but he is set for the
[1:05:32] people of God
[1:05:33] touch not mine anointed
[1:05:36] Paul puts it this way who shall lay
[1:05:38] anything to the charge of God's elect
[1:05:40] God that justifieth
[1:05:43] brother George Moore last week just
[1:05:45] brought it so wonderfully how that how
[1:05:47] that we have a
[1:05:49] uh we sometimes in our minds we begin to
[1:05:51] think well I have to work my way into
[1:05:54] salvation or maybe we get saved and we
[1:05:57] we're chosen by grace and and we even
[1:05:59] receive the Holy Ghost but then we begin
[1:06:01] to think well I need to work my way I
[1:06:03] need to I need to make myself worthy
[1:06:05] that you can't make yourself worthy
[1:06:07] all you can do is just love him
[1:06:11] what can I do David says how can I
[1:06:13] return to the Lord what he's given me
[1:06:16] what can I give what do I have in my
[1:06:18] possession that I can give back to the
[1:06:20] Lord I Have Nothing
[1:06:22] all I have he said I'll pay my vows in
[1:06:25] the congregation
[1:06:26] I'll come and worship
[1:06:28] I'll lift my hands I'll I'll say Lord
[1:06:31] you're worthy and it won't pay you back
[1:06:34] but that's what I'll do what I can but I
[1:06:36] could never repay what he did for me
[1:06:39] hey man it's what we want to look at now
[1:06:41] as we go to communion aren't you glad he
[1:06:45] did it for you don't let any person try
[1:06:47] to take away your identity in the bride
[1:06:49] he chose you to hear this message
[1:06:52] for a reason amen musicians go ahead and
[1:06:56] come
[1:06:57] again we'll have the communion service
[1:06:58] but no foot washing tonight
[1:07:01] there's healing in communion but the
[1:07:03] Branham taught us that and I know it's
[1:07:05] not in the literal bread or the literal
[1:07:07] wine but in the act of taking communion
[1:07:10] it builds Faith because you're
[1:07:12] identifying yourself here at the table
[1:07:14] I'm a Child of God I'm the Bride of
[1:07:17] Jesus Christ I belong to God that's why
[1:07:19] you can't take communion at your home by
[1:07:22] yourself
[1:07:23] can't wash your own feet because you're
[1:07:26] identifying the public identification
[1:07:28] but the Branham calls it a showdown The
[1:07:30] Showdown you're publicly identifying
[1:07:32] yourself
[1:07:33] as a child of God so if the brothers
[1:07:36] would come and and make that ready and
[1:07:38] you could play something and I want to
[1:07:40] read
[1:07:43] First Corinthians chapter 11.
