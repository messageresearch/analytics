[34:42] amen let's stand together again sorry to
[34:44] have you up and down
[34:46] luke chapter 15 verse 11.
[34:53] this might be a strange subject to
[34:55] preach to a church full of
[34:57] christian people but i think it'll apply
[35:01] in ways that
[35:03] maybe we didn't think of to our
[35:06] our lives and i preach by inspiration i
[35:09] don't mean that i
[35:11] don't have notes because i do take notes
[35:13] if i didn't have notes we'd be here a
[35:15] long time
[35:17] but i preached my inspiration the fact
[35:19] that i have to be inspired
[35:21] to the thought to preach something and
[35:23] and i was inspired to this this week and
[35:25] i don't know why
[35:27] but i believe that god has something for
[35:29] every one of us
[35:31] and so as the old saying is if the shoes
[35:33] don't fit don't wear it but if it does
[35:36] then we should put it on and the word of
[35:39] god always helps us to understand
[35:41] you know and many times when we look at
[35:43] these things we think thank
[35:44] god for your grace i was that prodigal i
[35:47] was that one who was lost
[35:49] and god found me in the pig pen and
[35:52] you're grateful for that today and i'm
[35:53] grateful for that
[35:54] and so you can have the love of god who
[35:57] can show you the love of god in your
[35:58] life and your
[35:59] in your heart luke chapter 15 and verse
[36:01] 11 he said
[36:03] a certain man had two sons and the
[36:05] younger of them said to his father
[36:07] father give me the portion of goods that
[36:09] followeth to me
[36:10] and he divided unto them his living and
[36:13] not many days after the younger son
[36:15] gathered all together and took his
[36:16] journey into a far country
[36:18] and there wasted his substance with
[36:20] riotous
[36:22] living when he had spent all there arose
[36:25] a mighty famine in that land and he
[36:26] began to be
[36:28] in want and he went and joined himself
[36:31] to a citizen of that country
[36:33] he sent him into his fields to feed
[36:35] swine
[36:36] and would feign have filled his belly
[36:38] with the husk that the swine did eat
[36:40] no man gave unto him and when he came to
[36:44] himself
[36:45] i love that when he came to himself he
[36:48] said how many
[36:49] hired servants of my father's bread
[36:52] enough and to spare
[36:54] and i perish with hunger i will arise
[36:57] and go to my father
[36:59] will say unto him father i have sinned
[37:02] against heaven and before thee
[37:04] and i'm no more worthy to be called thy
[37:06] son make me as one of thy hired servants
[37:09] and he arose and came to his father but
[37:12] when he was yet a great way off
[37:15] his father saw him hurt you glad for
[37:17] that today
[37:18] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[37:21] his neck
[37:22] and kissed him and the son said unto him
[37:25] father
[37:25] i have sinned against heaven and in thy
[37:28] sight and am no more worthy to be called
[37:30] thy son
[37:32] but the father said to his servants
[37:33] bring forth the best robe put it on him
[37:36] put a ring on his hand
[37:38] and shoes on his feet and bring hither
[37:40] the fatted calf and kill it
[37:42] let us eat and be merry for this my son
[37:46] was dead and is alive again he was lost
[37:48] in his found
[37:50] and they began to be mary i pray the
[37:53] lord without his blessing to the word
[37:54] you may be seated this morning
[38:01] while driving along a country road after
[38:03] a rainstorm a man saw a farmer
[38:06] standing by a recently collapsed barn
[38:09] the driver stopped and asked him what
[38:11] happened and the farmer replied the roof
[38:13] fell
[38:13] in he said it leaked so long it finally
[38:17] rotted through
[38:19] the stranger asked the farmer he said
[38:21] why didn't you fix it
[38:23] before it got so bad and the farmer
[38:26] replied this way he said well when the
[38:27] weather was good there wasn't a need for
[38:29] it
[38:31] when the rains come it was too wet
[38:34] so finally it just fell in
[38:38] i want to speak to you today on a title
[38:41] of
[38:41] prodigal why not
[38:45] you know i want to look at the excuses
[38:48] that the prodigal must have made to
[38:51] maintain
[38:52] his standing outside the home until
[38:55] finally he came to himself
[38:59] and you know when we make excuses for
[39:02] our condition we become victims of
[39:03] circumstance
[39:06] and i've found and i think most of you
[39:08] would agree with this that
[39:09] the biggest difference between those who
[39:11] are happy and those who are unhappy in
[39:13] life is not his attitude not
[39:15] circumstances it's not so much what
[39:18] happens to you but it's your reaction to
[39:21] what happens to you
[39:23] right haven't you found that's what
[39:24] really gets you in trouble is when you
[39:26] react in the wrong way
[39:28] and and if you constantly let everybody
[39:30] else control
[39:32] you and and your attitude then you're
[39:35] never going to get anywhere in life
[39:37] it's always going to be the church it's
[39:39] always going to be the people it's
[39:40] always going to be the pastor it's
[39:41] always going to be
[39:42] those preachers or those people or that
[39:44] person or my family or my parents but
[39:47] if you could ever get to the point where
[39:49] i i believe i'm a creator
[39:52] a miniature creator i can create an
[39:54] atmosphere of positivity in my life
[39:56] i'm not bound to these circumstances
[39:58] around me i can overcome that and when
[40:00] when you get to that place then you quit
[40:02] making excuses
[40:04] for your life someone who said excuses
[40:08] are like moses we all have one
[40:11] the mother of a grade school wrote a
[40:13] note to her son's teacher once and the
[40:14] note read
[40:16] please excuse jimmy for being
[40:20] he says it was his father's fault
[40:24] she meant to say being late but it's
[40:26] probably appropriate
[40:29] please excuse jimmy for being if you're
[40:32] going to start making excuses you could
[40:33] jc just start making excuses for being
[40:36] alive
[40:39] right and you know
[40:43] i want to challenge that today and in my
[40:45] own life and then
[40:46] especially though to those who maybe
[40:49] would make excuses for not coming to
[40:50] church or not
[40:52] not believing the gospel maybe you're
[40:54] that person maybe you know someone like
[40:55] that maybe you
[40:57] maybe have children that are that way
[40:59] and they would come back
[41:01] but there's always some reason why they
[41:03] don't
[41:04] and i don't mean to be hard toward those
[41:06] people today because we all make excuses
[41:08] sometimes
[41:10] why we don't do what we know we should
[41:12] do
[41:13] but aren't you glad for the grace of god
[41:15] that one day you can come to yourself
[41:17] and say
[41:18] hey this i know this is where i'm
[41:20] supposed to be
[41:23] regardless of everything else around me
[41:25] now
[41:26] the parable that jesus tells of the
[41:30] prodigal describes two settings
[41:33] it describes on one side a happy home a
[41:35] loving father
[41:36] a fatted calf clean clothes a ring
[41:41] of significance on the other side of
[41:44] muddy field of pigs
[41:48] look at the contrast between the two a
[41:51] happy home
[41:52] contrasted with a field of pigs
[41:55] a citizen of a far country who he barely
[41:57] knows
[41:59] husk to eat instead of a fatted calf
[42:03] filthy rags to wear and no place to
[42:06] belong
[42:08] and the question that i have is not
[42:12] why would he go back but why would he
[42:15] stay in the pigpen
[42:18] why wait so long it seems like such a
[42:21] clear choice doesn't it
[42:24] on one side here he's in the mud and and
[42:27] he's feeding the pigs and he's wishing
[42:29] he could eat that food
[42:31] that he's feeding the pigs and here on
[42:34] the other side he's got everything that
[42:35] he a man
[42:36] could ever want
[42:39] and yet the very advantages that he has
[42:42] on this side i'll make
[42:44] this the good side so you all can be
[42:45] okay today
[42:47] those of you on the left are just in
[42:48] trouble
[42:50] you all be in the pig pen and over here
[42:52] is a happy home
[42:54] but on this side if we could just look
[42:56] at it like that
[42:58] he's got everything he ever wanted but
[43:00] all of those advantages when you have
[43:02] the wrong attitude towards them
[43:04] become just excuses
[43:08] and if you could imagine the kind of the
[43:10] thought that he would
[43:11] begin to think that these things that
[43:14] are advantageous to me are not
[43:15] really advantages they're really the
[43:17] reasons why i don't go back
[43:21] now the word prodigal means
[43:24] wasteful we it's come to mean someone
[43:28] who strays
[43:29] but it's not actually the meaning of it
[43:31] is someone who wastes
[43:33] his substance
[43:36] and how many people have we found that
[43:39] wastes
[43:39] the things that god gave them the
[43:41] talents the abilities the gifts
[43:44] that god gave them the ability and i it
[43:47] always strikes you when you see someone
[43:49] who
[43:50] was very gifted someone who's able to
[43:53] help in the church someone who's able to
[43:55] to preach or to sing or to do something
[43:57] like that and
[43:58] or maybe somebody who's gifted to make
[44:00] money and finances are different ways
[44:03] and yet they use it for the devil
[44:05] and they backslide and go out into the
[44:07] world and you look at that and say what
[44:08] a waste it is
[44:10] what a wasted life you see a young
[44:12] person that could
[44:14] be a preacher's wife or a young man that
[44:17] could be a minister of the gospel and
[44:19] you see them out taking drugs shooting
[44:21] up their veins and
[44:23] and their teeth rotting out and or maybe
[44:25] you see them in
[44:26] just some kind of job where they're
[44:28] working seven days a week and they don't
[44:30] have time for god
[44:31] they don't have time for the things of
[44:32] god and you look at that and think
[44:34] what a horrible waste that that is they
[44:37] may not realize it but they're wasting
[44:39] their
[44:40] prodigal they're wasting the substance
[44:42] that god gave them
[44:44] well i pray that we would never waste
[44:46] the opportunities that god gives us
[44:48] the abilities for the david and ability
[44:51] to sing and ability to play an ability
[44:53] to preach whatever that it is that you
[44:55] might have
[44:56] whatever that is there's a there's an
[44:58] ability there's a substance that you've
[45:00] been given by god
[45:02] and but see the prodigal son wanted his
[45:04] substance now
[45:05] so he could use it for himself and so he
[45:09] went into a far country and wasted it
[45:11] and that's what so many people do but if
[45:14] you could only realize that that kind of
[45:15] life is so unfulfilled because you might
[45:18] be able to do that and i've told you
[45:20] about my friend
[45:21] here recently and and he's been on my
[45:23] mind because he
[45:24] was a singer in church and a great
[45:26] musician and
[45:28] now today he sings in the bars and i
[45:30] look at him and think what a wasted
[45:32] opportunity but yet what an opportunity
[45:35] that he could have to to come back
[45:37] and and and to come out of that pigpen
[45:41] and yet the excuses are all there well
[45:43] my family was like this and
[45:45] my church was like this and my pastor
[45:48] was
[45:49] this a hard man and and so i just buried
[45:52] my talent and went on and
[45:54] did what whatever i wanted to do with it
[45:56] and not realizing that
[45:57] there was something so much greater that
[45:59] god wanted to do in his life
[46:03] but yet it's not too late as long as
[46:05] there's breath there's hope
[46:09] as long as there's breath there's hope
[46:11] and maybe you're sitting there today
[46:13] maybe you're
[46:14] at home and and you're wondering do i
[46:17] have hope is there hope for me i'm
[46:18] 50 i'm 60 i'm 80. there's still hope for
[46:22] you you don't have to waste the rest of
[46:24] your life
[46:26] if you're alive there's still something
[46:27] left for you to do
[46:33] prodigal why not why not i think we
[46:37] asked the wrong questions
[46:40] it should be such a no if you'll excuse
[46:43] the expression a no-brainer
[46:45] to come back to live for god
[46:49] not just to go to this church or another
[46:51] church but
[46:52] to go to church to have god in your
[46:56] heart to feel the the sense that your
[47:00] sins are forgiven by the salmon
[47:02] what would you trade for that no matter
[47:04] what you've done in the past no matter
[47:06] how far you've gone
[47:07] what would you trade for that
[47:09] understanding and that that knowledge
[47:10] and that
[47:11] that ability to believe that the blood
[47:13] has covered all of my sins
[47:16] and they've been put away in the depths
[47:17] of the sea of god's forgetfulness i
[47:19] don't have to
[47:20] i don't have to answer for those things
[47:22] anymore i'm not bound to drugs anyone
[47:24] i'm bound to alcohol i'm not bound to
[47:26] the things of the world
[47:27] i'm free today
[47:33] but when the prodigal was home his first
[47:36] excuse was probably that it was an
[47:38] unhappy home
[47:41] it was an unhappy home because for him
[47:44] he'd never been in the pig lot
[47:46] he'd been protected from the elements
[47:50] he didn't know hunger
[47:53] he didn't know what it was like to have
[47:55] to deal with those things and yet the
[47:56] very security which he had he took his
[47:58] bondage
[48:00] and the happiness he identified as
[48:02] hypocrisy
[48:04] and the father recognized his son's
[48:06] unhappiness but he doesn't try to
[48:07] force him to stay home and what this
[48:10] parable teaches us is something about
[48:12] the love of god
[48:15] because he doesn't he does not force him
[48:17] to stay home
[48:19] a forced religion is something that'll
[48:22] make you unhappy
[48:24] and god wants us to be happy
[48:28] the father gives his son his inheritance
[48:31] the younger of them in luke 15 12 said
[48:32] to his father father
[48:34] give me the portion of goods that
[48:36] falleth to me and he divided unto them
[48:39] his living brother branham says god does
[48:42] not force man to do anything
[48:44] you do it on your own free will he can
[48:47] warn you throw a barricade across your
[48:49] path
[48:49] but you walk your own self with your own
[48:53] decision in his presence
[48:55] to make him your savior
[48:58] the very fact that he gives you that
[49:00] choice it's proof of his goodness
[49:06] they tell me and excuse me i know it's a
[49:08] little bit different this morning i'm
[49:09] taking it kind of slow but i really want
[49:10] to make sure
[49:12] that we're following this today
[49:16] einstein believed in god because he knew
[49:18] that there had to be a beginning
[49:21] he was smart enough to know that things
[49:23] just didn't create themselves
[49:26] out of thin air there had to be
[49:27] something that began if you go
[49:30] back to the even the smallest atom or
[49:31] molecule
[49:34] but he struggled with the idea of free
[49:36] will
[49:38] and his theory was that if god is
[49:39] omniscient and passes judgment on men
[49:41] for exercising their own free will
[49:43] he passes judgment on himself he
[49:45] couldn't see the love of god
[49:48] all he could see was the god that
[49:51] allowed
[49:53] hunger and all the things all the
[49:54] killing and the things that are allowed
[49:56] and
[49:57] then judges man for doing those things
[50:00] he just couldn't accept that he couldn't
[50:02] accept an omniscient god would give free
[50:03] will but
[50:05] the very fact that god gives you that
[50:07] choice
[50:09] even knowing what you'll do with it but
[50:11] the very fact that he gives it to you it
[50:13] says love
[50:15] and i would like to present that to you
[50:18] today
[50:19] and if a person is gone you'd say well
[50:21] you know i wish that god would have
[50:23] kept me if he wanted me he should have
[50:25] kept me in church he should have kept me
[50:26] living for him no the fact
[50:28] that he gave you a choice is
[50:31] proves that he loves you and the fact
[50:35] that you're still there today and able
[50:37] to make a choice to come back
[50:39] is proof that he loves you the bible
[50:42] says the lord is not slack concerning
[50:44] his promise as some men count sadness
[50:46] but it's long suffering to us we're not
[50:48] willing that any should perish
[50:50] but that all should come to repentance
[50:54] so he's not putting it off putting off
[50:57] judgment because
[50:59] he's slack because he's just negligent
[51:01] in his duties but he's putting it off
[51:03] because he loves you
[51:07] i like to think that a kentucky
[51:08] hillbilly understood
[51:10] what the great scientist einstein
[51:12] couldn't and that's the love of god
[51:16] he said it this way he said we know that
[51:18] if we could draw a picture of the love
[51:19] of god
[51:20] 10 million times more than the seas of
[51:22] this earth
[51:24] he said banked into one tube a few
[51:26] inches across
[51:28] he said would reach billions of miles
[51:30] beyond the stars
[51:32] and thinking of the pressure that there
[51:34] would be on the bottom of that tube
[51:40] what a word picture the love of god
[51:43] so great that it's it's like if you
[51:46] could put it in a tube
[51:47] it'd be billions of miles beyond the
[51:48] stars 10 million times more than the
[51:51] seas of the earth
[51:52] he said in the pressure there would be
[51:54] on the bottom of that tube how about
[51:55] water
[51:56] with all them billions of tons of
[51:58] pressure trying to press
[52:00] down and yet the love of god
[52:03] is searching our hearts tonight great
[52:06] powers of strength that he would like to
[52:08] find listen one little crevice
[52:11] amen to leak through
[52:15] he said to come into our lives and give
[52:17] us this great power and unction
[52:19] beyond even man's understanding see
[52:21] einstein couldn't see that
[52:23] all he could see was god judging men for
[52:26] things that he allowed them to do
[52:28] but a prophet of god stood there and
[52:29] said the love of god is so great
[52:31] that it's like the pressure at the
[52:32] bottom of that tube that's millions of
[52:34] miles long
[52:35] and the pressure that would be so great
[52:37] that it would press into every crevice
[52:39] that it could find
[52:40] isn't that how god deals with your life
[52:42] isn't that how he deals with mine
[52:44] that he actually presses himself the
[52:46] love of god is so
[52:48] so precious to us and it comes down and
[52:50] he pushes and presses himself
[52:52] into every crevice of our life until we
[52:55] find him when we're in need and when
[52:56] we're sick
[52:57] and when we're hungry and when we're
[52:58] when we need
[53:00] something in our minds when we're upset
[53:02] all of a sudden that that love of god
[53:04] pushes its way through
[53:06] when we're obstinate when we when we
[53:07] don't want to serve him when we don't do
[53:09] what we should do
[53:10] the love of god comes down anyway and
[53:13] people could just see that the love of
[53:15] god is there he's pressing but what
[53:17] keeps him back
[53:18] our own choice our own free will
[53:25] brother brahma expressed it this way he
[53:27] said father many are wayward
[53:30] they don't mean to be that way lord
[53:32] maybe some of them in here tonight
[53:33] drunkards
[53:36] he said maybe people that's done stepped
[53:37] over the line went on to immoral acts
[53:39] and done everything that's wrong like
[53:40] that
[53:41] but god you still love them
[53:45] or can you you just feel the pressure of
[53:47] that love it's coming down it did
[53:49] here's a man that's done everything
[53:50] wrong and done here's a woman that's
[53:52] done everything wrong look at the woman
[53:53] at the well
[53:54] look at the one who's caught in the act
[53:55] of adultery and here's that that
[53:57] pressure of god's love
[53:58] funneled down into a body called the son
[54:01] of god
[54:02] and when he come on the earth what did
[54:03] he do he just pressed into every crevice
[54:06] and every crack and everything
[54:07] that could possibly be don't you see him
[54:10] doing that in your own life
[54:12] huh he comes down
[54:16] and and tells them go and sin no more
[54:20] why he says everything was wrong like
[54:21] that but god you still love them
[54:24] he said no will you save them tonight
[54:25] lord
[54:27] excuse me will you bring that poor
[54:30] wandering backsider no matter if he's
[54:33] setting out light and condemned
[54:36] feels that maybe he's crossed the
[54:37] separating line no he hasn't
[54:39] your spirit's still calling as long as
[54:43] it calls you're wanting your wandering
[54:45] child to come home
[54:48] and here's what it is with the heart
[54:50] it's not that you sit there and you
[54:51] think well
[54:53] i've just done too much that's too bad
[54:55] there's no way that i can do it but
[54:57] remember
[54:58] when you feel like that you haven't
[55:00] crossed the separating line
[55:01] because if you had you wouldn't want it
[55:05] but the spirit's still calling he said
[55:07] as long as it calls you're wanting your
[55:08] wondering child to come home
[55:12] he's just that love of god is just
[55:13] pressing into that the crevices of your
[55:15] heart
[55:16] pressing in every way that he can don't
[55:18] you hear him calling can't you feel that
[55:21] in the service when you sit in the
[55:22] presence of god and yet we do so many
[55:24] things that are wrong
[55:25] we make so many mistakes we're prodigal
[55:27] we waste in so many ways and yet god
[55:30] comes down and just pushes into every
[55:31] little crevice of our heart
[55:35] as long as it calls you're wanting your
[55:37] wandering child to come home may sit
[55:39] there and think well
[55:40] he doesn't want me anymore but don't you
[55:42] see the very fact that you're able to
[55:43] even think those thoughts
[55:45] prude said he wants you proof said he
[55:47] loves you
[55:53] he said as long as it calls you're
[55:56] wanting wanting your wandering child to
[55:59] come home
[56:00] won't you grant it tonight father that
[56:02] the holy spirit bring conviction in the
[56:04] audience and bring many wandering
[56:05] children to thee
[56:07] for we ask it in his name
[56:11] paul expressed it like this he said the
[56:13] goodness of god leads you to repentance
[56:18] songwriter expressed it this way the
[56:21] love of god is greater for
[56:24] and tongue or pen can ever tell it goes
[56:26] beyond the
[56:27] highest star reaches to the lowest hell
[56:30] the guilty pair bowed down with care god
[56:33] gave his son to win
[56:34] his airing child he reconciled and
[56:36] pardoned from his sin
[56:37] that all love of god how rich and pure
[56:41] how measureless and strong it shall
[56:44] forevermore
[56:45] endure the saints and angels
[56:49] song no wonder einstein couldn't grasp
[56:51] it
[56:52] the love of god was so great that it
[56:54] couldn't even be grasped
[56:56] under the law couldn't even be
[56:58] understood
[57:00] until god wrapped himself in flesh
[57:06] come down and lived among us
[57:11] so the young man probably thought he had
[57:13] an unhappy home and didn't know
[57:16] didn't recognize how happy it was
[57:20] if he was making excuses he might make
[57:22] the excuse he had an unloving father
[57:29] and the farther away from home he
[57:30] journeyed
[57:33] the more he was convinced that if the
[57:35] father really loved him
[57:37] he wouldn't have let him leave
[57:42] your your mind place tricks on you
[57:48] because what will happen is you'll leave
[57:51] and then you'll blame god for letting
[57:52] you leave
[57:56] if well if he really loved me he'd have
[57:57] arrested me he'd have stopped me
[58:00] he wouldn't have given me this money so
[58:01] i could waste it he wouldn't have given
[58:03] me these talents so i could waste it if
[58:04] you really love me
[58:06] but you see the father knew that he
[58:07] would never love him
[58:09] like he should in his original condition
[58:13] are you hearing me today the father knew
[58:15] that the prodigal would never love him
[58:18] like he should he loved him but he knew
[58:21] the son would never love him back
[58:24] as long as he had that happy home as
[58:26] long as he had them nice clothes as long
[58:28] as he had that ring
[58:28] it was significant as long as he had all
[58:30] these things he would never love him
[58:32] back so he let him go
[58:35] so he would learn to love him
[58:39] and the bible says not many days after
[58:41] the younger son gathered all together
[58:42] and took his journey
[58:43] into a far country and there wasted his
[58:47] substance with riotous
[58:49] living and that's the natural reaction
[58:53] of the sinners to be so far away from
[58:54] god
[58:56] as to not feel conviction
[58:59] and yet as jesus said of the pharisees
[59:01] he said this people draw
[59:02] nigh unto me with their mouth and honor
[59:05] me with their lips but their heart is
[59:06] far from me
[59:08] it's possible to be close and be far
[59:11] away in your heart
[59:14] i would tell you this morning that i've
[59:15] never wondered
[59:17] as far as from church i've never left
[59:20] i've always went to church i've always
[59:21] tried to serve god in that way
[59:24] but i've wondered in my heart
[59:27] i think all of us could say that
[59:31] you can point back to a time when you
[59:33] wonder maybe you always knew the message
[59:35] was right and
[59:35] you always believe the bible you always
[59:37] believe the scripture but you've
[59:38] wondered
[59:40] in your heart
[59:44] the heart leaves first
[59:47] i've watched it over and over over the
[59:49] years a person doesn't just leave church
[59:52] their heart leaves first if the heart is
[59:55] right there's not much you could do to
[59:58] run a child of god out of church unless
[59:59] it was something wrong
[1:00:01] or ungodly or against the word
[1:00:04] but the heart leaves and once the heart
[1:00:06] leaves then
[1:00:08] the person leaves and
[1:00:12] you know they may go somewhere else for
[1:00:14] a while and
[1:00:15] but their their heart left and so they
[1:00:18] end up leaving
[1:00:19] completely i hate to see that not
[1:00:20] because they leave the church
[1:00:22] i i wish i could tell you this i wish i
[1:00:25] you know
[1:00:27] i wish i could explain it to you but my
[1:00:30] heart's just as happy when i see a
[1:00:31] sinner saved in another church as it is
[1:00:33] in ours
[1:00:35] i really believe that i'm not saying
[1:00:37] that with guile or trying to convince
[1:00:39] you of something but it's just the truth
[1:00:40] i
[1:00:41] uh we're in this together you know we
[1:00:44] put our rose-colored glasses on and
[1:00:45] think that well
[1:00:47] uh you know with somebody else's across
[1:00:49] the street that
[1:00:51] you know we can do without them but no
[1:00:52] we really can't
[1:00:54] there's not enough of us to fight
[1:00:56] amongst ourselves and so
[1:00:58] i'm i'm perfectly happy for somebody to
[1:01:00] come back but i hate to see somebody
[1:01:01] leave church
[1:01:03] they'd see somebody quit coming as often
[1:01:05] as they once didn't quit doing those
[1:01:06] things because you know
[1:01:08] that the heart leads first
[1:01:11] and you can watch it as they go and you
[1:01:14] can see the spirit of god calling to
[1:01:15] that person come home
[1:01:18] come back come home
[1:01:21] so many times we turn it down
[1:01:25] the heart leaves first before the son
[1:01:27] left home he must have convinced himself
[1:01:28] perhaps he convinced himself that
[1:01:30] the father loved him less than he did
[1:01:32] his older brother
[1:01:35] satan convinced steve of something like
[1:01:38] that when he said the serpent said to
[1:01:40] the woman you shall not surely die
[1:01:42] for god doth know that the day you eat
[1:01:44] thereof your eyes will be opened and you
[1:01:45] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[1:01:48] in other words he said the only reason
[1:01:49] he doesn't want you to go is because he
[1:01:51] wants you to keep from
[1:01:52] fully experiencing the pleasure of life
[1:01:56] at first when the prodigal son left that
[1:01:58] must have seemed true
[1:02:02] right because there is as hebrews 11 25
[1:02:04] tells us there is pleasure
[1:02:06] in sin for a season
[1:02:09] so it must have seemed true but even the
[1:02:11] season of pleasure is a slippery slope
[1:02:15] and psalm 73 and 18 tells us that
[1:02:17] speaking of those that
[1:02:19] continue on as if nothing had ever
[1:02:21] happened and yet they turn against god
[1:02:23] or they never
[1:02:24] they're wicked in their ways and it says
[1:02:26] surely thou had set them in slippery
[1:02:28] places thou cast him down
[1:02:30] into destruction an early american
[1:02:33] preacher named jonathan edwards preached
[1:02:34] a sermon called sinners in the hands of
[1:02:36] an angry god and
[1:02:37] he explained that even the natural
[1:02:39] forces of gravity
[1:02:40] pull the center towards hell
[1:02:44] it's like like they're standing on
[1:02:48] or they're up they're hanging in the air
[1:02:50] and they're going to come down
[1:02:52] it's just a matter of time
[1:02:56] in fact the sinner preaching that sermon
[1:02:59] is already in a condition of hell
[1:03:02] you know he's already if he's living
[1:03:04] that way
[1:03:05] he's already there and brother branham
[1:03:08] taught us that
[1:03:10] only the mercies of god hold them up
[1:03:15] and yet we say well god doesn't love me
[1:03:17] the prodigal son probably said the
[1:03:19] father doesn't love me
[1:03:20] but the fact that he let him go
[1:03:23] and let him live like that huh and he
[1:03:26] didn't
[1:03:27] didn't kill him didn't strike him dead
[1:03:28] didn't didn't persecute him
[1:03:31] let him go was proof that he loved him
[1:03:36] jonathan edwards uses this scripture
[1:03:38] deuteronomy 32 35
[1:03:41] when he preaches that sermon he said to
[1:03:42] me belong with vengeance and recompense
[1:03:44] their foot shall slide
[1:03:46] in due time their foot shall slide in
[1:03:49] due time it's not a matter of if it's a
[1:03:51] matter of when
[1:03:55] and we can say it this way how can you
[1:03:56] say he doesn't love you if he hasn't
[1:03:57] already sent you to hell
[1:04:01] we don't realize what sin is just
[1:04:05] just the things that we've done today
[1:04:07] just the disobedience we've exhibited
[1:04:09] this week or this month
[1:04:11] is enough to send us to hell just being
[1:04:14] born the way we were born
[1:04:17] is enough to send us to hell yet you
[1:04:20] can't be lost if you're a son of god
[1:04:23] why the mercy of god the grace of god
[1:04:27] the power of god comes in and he saves
[1:04:29] you from that
[1:04:31] but therefore shall side and do time
[1:04:33] those that are destined to that will
[1:04:35] end up there there it's just a matter of
[1:04:36] time but it's his long suffering is
[1:04:39] his grace to even to them but especially
[1:04:42] to the elect
[1:04:44] that he doesn't judge us now but the
[1:04:47] blood covers our sins aren't you glad
[1:04:49] for that today
[1:04:52] we judge ourselves by the word now
[1:04:54] perhaps
[1:04:56] the prodigal thought that surely the
[1:04:58] father loved the other brother more
[1:05:01] what a mistake you see every day the
[1:05:04] father looked out for his welfare every
[1:05:05] night he prayed
[1:05:07] that he would come home
[1:05:11] you know when you're making excuses
[1:05:13] everything is an excuse
[1:05:16] right you've seen people that didn't
[1:05:17] want to be in a marriage
[1:05:20] right when you don't want to be in a
[1:05:21] marriage everything's wrong
[1:05:24] you may have loved the way she cooked
[1:05:25] him eggs when you wanted to be in that
[1:05:27] marriage
[1:05:28] but then one day i don't know why i'm
[1:05:30] going down this line but just hang with
[1:05:31] me for a moment
[1:05:33] but you may love those eggs when you
[1:05:35] really you know but all of a sudden
[1:05:37] you don't like them no more all of a
[1:05:40] sudden that
[1:05:41] nothing's right you pick at everything
[1:05:45] but be careful if you find yourself in
[1:05:46] that condition because you're on your
[1:05:48] way out
[1:05:50] right and you learn to love it if it's
[1:05:52] from somebody you love
[1:05:55] right the way that they look the way
[1:05:56] that they wear their clothes the way
[1:05:58] everything about them you love them
[1:06:00] if it's somebody that you love but when
[1:06:01] you lose that love you begin to pick at
[1:06:03] them
[1:06:04] begin to make excuses and i'm sure the
[1:06:06] prodigal son began to make an excuse
[1:06:09] about the food he got tired of eating
[1:06:13] the same old food
[1:06:16] now remember he he's already you look at
[1:06:17] all these advantages that he had
[1:06:19] and why would he say in the pig pen it's
[1:06:21] because
[1:06:22] he thought the father didn't love him he
[1:06:25] thought he was trying to hold him back
[1:06:26] from experiencing this
[1:06:28] true pleasure he thought that he was
[1:06:30] going to
[1:06:32] he was trying to keep him from being
[1:06:33] everything that he could be
[1:06:35] he thought his home was unhappy he
[1:06:37] thought the father didn't love him he
[1:06:38] thought
[1:06:39] that old fatted calf was boring
[1:06:43] how many people today have gotten bored
[1:06:45] with the message of the hour
[1:06:48] it's amazing how bored you can get by
[1:06:50] the preaching of the word
[1:06:52] when your heart's not right it's amazing
[1:06:55] how you don't want to hear the tapes
[1:06:56] tomorrow when your heart's not right
[1:06:59] it's amazing how you don't want to you
[1:07:00] don't want to listen you don't want to
[1:07:02] hear from god anymore you you get
[1:07:04] uncomfortable in a service where the
[1:07:05] worship's going on and where people are
[1:07:07] worshiping
[1:07:08] when you don't want to when your hearts
[1:07:09] are right
[1:07:12] why because it's just like i talked
[1:07:14] about the example of marriage it's like
[1:07:15] in a marriage when someone's doing
[1:07:16] something they shouldn't
[1:07:17] what happens they they don't even want
[1:07:18] to even do the
[1:07:20] little things the hugging and the
[1:07:21] kissing and all those things they don't
[1:07:22] want to do that because
[1:07:24] their heart's not right they want to be
[1:07:26] offended
[1:07:29] and so the the backside when they when
[1:07:32] they make excuses they want to be
[1:07:34] offended
[1:07:34] they look at these things and think well
[1:07:36] the food
[1:07:38] it's not what it's cracked up to be
[1:07:40] didn't help me none
[1:07:43] you see even god's children in the old
[1:07:44] testament got tired of manna
[1:07:49] which is ironic because it's perfect
[1:07:51] food
[1:07:53] no contaminants imagine trying to get
[1:07:56] fat on manna
[1:07:58] right you couldn't you couldn't get
[1:07:59] diabetes from it or high blood pressure
[1:08:01] because god made it it's angel food
[1:08:06] it's perfect and it just falls out of
[1:08:09] the skies
[1:08:11] all you got to do is go get it
[1:08:14] right i mean that's pretty easy right
[1:08:16] seems like people would be happy with
[1:08:18] manna
[1:08:20] you know but there's something about
[1:08:23] human beings that are never happy
[1:08:25] numbers 11 and 4 says the mixed
[1:08:27] multitude that was among them and
[1:08:29] remember when israel come out they come
[1:08:31] out with a mixed multitude of
[1:08:32] egyptians and other races that come out
[1:08:34] with them they didn't come out for the
[1:08:36] same reasons that the israelites did but
[1:08:38] they were there
[1:08:40] and they began to follow a lusting and
[1:08:43] the children of israel also wept
[1:08:45] so when the mixed multitude started it
[1:08:47] the children of israel started it
[1:08:49] and said who shall give us flesh to eat
[1:08:52] we remember the fish which we didn't eat
[1:08:54] in egypt freely
[1:08:57] the cucumbers and the melons and the
[1:08:58] leeks and the onions and the garlic
[1:09:01] now of all things
[1:09:05] that you could look back on and say well
[1:09:06] i wish i had more garlic
[1:09:10] you see the food that god provided
[1:09:13] wasn't spicy enough for him
[1:09:15] that's why people make up these false
[1:09:18] doctrines
[1:09:20] the food that god provided is not spicy
[1:09:22] enough for people and so
[1:09:23] so they make up something
[1:09:27] and they put some few ingredients in
[1:09:29] there that don't belong
[1:09:30] but god said what i had is perfect what
[1:09:33] i provided is right
[1:09:35] why would we want to go back to
[1:09:37] something else for the chicken why would
[1:09:38] we want to go back if you come out of
[1:09:40] denominations why would you want to go
[1:09:41] back to that
[1:09:42] the food that was provided for us is
[1:09:44] perfect food
[1:09:45] it's angel's food amen it's something
[1:09:48] that will keep us
[1:09:49] healthy until we get to the other side
[1:09:53] i mean they should have been able to
[1:09:54] look and say man these pair of shoes has
[1:09:56] lasted for a long time
[1:09:58] they should have been able to look so
[1:09:59] there's no diseases among us they should
[1:10:02] have been able to look at god's
[1:10:03] blessings but instead they said we want
[1:10:05] garlic
[1:10:08] we'd like to have some onions
[1:10:14] you know people get tired of going to
[1:10:15] church they get tired of hearing the
[1:10:17] preacher they get tired of the word of
[1:10:18] god they're not getting tired of the
[1:10:19] preacher they're getting tired of the
[1:10:20] word
[1:10:22] are you tired reading your bible it's
[1:10:23] the same old thing every time i look at
[1:10:24] it but don't you know if you look at it
[1:10:26] with a heart that's right
[1:10:27] every time you look at it it'll be
[1:10:28] something new but you get tired of it
[1:10:31] because oil
[1:10:32] don't have no garlic in it ain't no
[1:10:34] ain't no
[1:10:35] hollywood garlic in in the word of god
[1:10:39] can't find no no detective stories no
[1:10:42] nothing like that that we would you know
[1:10:44] we get to feeding on stuff and we say
[1:10:45] well
[1:10:46] if i just had some garlic if it just
[1:10:48] made me feel good
[1:10:50] sometimes it condemns me and i wish it
[1:10:52] just made me feel better
[1:10:53] but it's not hollywood garlic or onions
[1:10:55] or leeks or cucumbers or melons
[1:10:57] but it's god's provided food
[1:11:00] they said but now our soul is dried away
[1:11:02] there is nothing at all
[1:11:04] besides this manna just this angel's
[1:11:07] food we don't have nothing else to eat
[1:11:12] preacher keeps coming and preaching the
[1:11:14] message of the hour every service he
[1:11:15] comes and he preaches and he tells us
[1:11:17] about a prophet tells us about god what
[1:11:19] he did and what he said and he tells us
[1:11:20] all about the home that we're going to
[1:11:22] in a rapture and things like that
[1:11:23] we've been feeding on this for a long
[1:11:25] time we're getting tired of it
[1:11:28] but it's about time we begin to
[1:11:30] reacquaint ourselves with the manna
[1:11:32] and recognize there's something good in
[1:11:38] it
[1:11:40] the people speak against god verse
[1:11:42] numbers 21 5 and against moses wherefore
[1:11:44] he said have you brought us up out of
[1:11:46] egypt to die in the wilderness
[1:11:47] for there is no bread neither is there
[1:11:49] any water and our soul
[1:11:52] loatheth we're disgusted by
[1:11:55] this light bread
[1:12:00] imagine somebody becoming disgusted by
[1:12:02] the message
[1:12:04] people do
[1:12:08] our soul loatheth this light bread we're
[1:12:11] tired of hearing it we want something
[1:12:12] different
[1:12:14] the proverbs i love the way solomon puts
[1:12:16] this he said the full soul loatheth the
[1:12:18] honeycomb
[1:12:20] but to the hungry soul every bitter
[1:12:22] thing is sweet
[1:12:24] god help us to be hungry
[1:12:29] you see when the prodigal left he
[1:12:30] probably ate things he never had been
[1:12:32] allowed to eat before
[1:12:34] delicacies of egypt that fed the senses
[1:12:37] the garlic the onions the leeks
[1:12:40] starved the soul the fatted calf had
[1:12:44] become common to him he wanted
[1:12:46] something different brother branham
[1:12:49] speaks about it
[1:12:50] about the israelites in the canaan or in
[1:12:53] the wilderness he said oh this old light
[1:12:54] bread
[1:12:56] angel's bread well what do we care about
[1:12:57] this whole light bread our souls
[1:12:59] loatheth this stuff and everything is
[1:13:00] wrong
[1:13:02] everything is wrong
[1:13:05] well we could dwell on that for a moment
[1:13:08] have you ever been in that you ever woke
[1:13:09] up on a monday morning and everything is
[1:13:11] wrong
[1:13:12] well that's the way they woke up one
[1:13:13] morning everything was wrong
[1:13:16] our souls loathe with this light bread
[1:13:17] everything is wrong and this old man
[1:13:19] that falls out every night why we would
[1:13:21] rather have some garlic and leak out of
[1:13:22] egypt
[1:13:23] he said you see their hearts wasn't
[1:13:25] ready for the journey
[1:13:28] that's why they got bored their hearts
[1:13:31] wasn't ready
[1:13:33] oh church we're on a journey we're going
[1:13:36] home
[1:13:38] but our hearts have to be right to go to
[1:13:41] to really appreciate the things that we
[1:13:42] have
[1:13:44] their hearts wasn't ready for the
[1:13:45] journey to to really take advantage of
[1:13:48] what god has provided us for the journey
[1:13:49] our hearts have to be right brother
[1:13:52] brother said when a man or woman begins
[1:13:53] to complain about going to church
[1:13:55] they get so tired of going to church
[1:13:58] they're not ready for the journey
[1:14:00] so that's right there's something wrong
[1:14:02] somewhere
[1:14:03] oh god help us it can become old to all
[1:14:06] of us don't you
[1:14:07] know that you know if you're in the same
[1:14:09] place and you
[1:14:10] people talk about it becoming boring to
[1:14:13] listen to a preacher you ought to try
[1:14:15] preaching sometime
[1:14:19] man i love it when we have one of these
[1:14:20] brothers up here brother stewart did
[1:14:21] such a
[1:14:22] good job wednesday night or brother
[1:14:23] allen rather than but the stewards are
[1:14:24] going to preach wednesday night
[1:14:26] and they did they do such a good job i
[1:14:28] love it when somebody else preaches
[1:14:30] brother aaron's coming in this weekend i
[1:14:32] love that why because it feeds me
[1:14:35] because you get tired of of giving this
[1:14:37] good man
[1:14:38] out and never not not getting into
[1:14:40] yourself sometimes
[1:14:42] or maybe as much as we should be getting
[1:14:45] but see it it gets boring both ways
[1:14:48] but you got to keep your eye on the goal
[1:14:50] you got to recognize your heart you got
[1:14:52] to keep your heart right
[1:14:53] because if you don't keep your heart
[1:14:54] right as a minister you'll end up
[1:14:56] feeding people stuff you shouldn't be
[1:14:57] feeding them
[1:14:58] you'll end up feeding on stuff you
[1:15:00] shouldn't be feeding on
[1:15:02] right because you get so tired of going
[1:15:04] to church you get so tired of preaching
[1:15:05] you get so tired of singing
[1:15:07] you get so tired of all the things that
[1:15:08] are going on there say well we just do
[1:15:10] the same thing every sunday
[1:15:11] but if god wanted us to do that until he
[1:15:13] come wouldn't that be a small sacrifice
[1:15:15] for all that he's given us
[1:15:17] i don't say he does but if he wanted us
[1:15:19] to you say well everything's not exactly
[1:15:21] like we want it to be
[1:15:22] or if we only had a better this or
[1:15:24] better that or a better preacher or
[1:15:26] whatever than it is but remember if god
[1:15:27] wants this for us
[1:15:28] until the end time i say god help me to
[1:15:31] accept it help me to
[1:15:32] stay with it help me to put everything i
[1:15:34] got behind it
[1:15:37] because i'm going home i'm not just here
[1:15:39] for here
[1:15:41] i don't belong here i'm a pilgrim and a
[1:15:43] stranger on this earth
[1:15:44] i'm going out i'm leaving this pigpen
[1:15:46] i'm taking a journey to the sky
[1:15:51] so when a man and woman gets tired
[1:15:52] begins to complain about going to church
[1:15:54] they get so tired of going to church
[1:15:55] they're not ready for the journey
[1:15:59] when we complain about the food we've
[1:16:01] been provided
[1:16:02] we reinforce the excuse of the prodigals
[1:16:06] i don't mean so much my preaching you're
[1:16:07] welcome to complain about my preaching
[1:16:11] i'll be right there with you
[1:16:15] but you know when we get tired of the
[1:16:18] message
[1:16:20] we begin to complain about the
[1:16:22] restrictions that are placed on us as
[1:16:23] believers
[1:16:24] we don't realize we don't recognize this
[1:16:27] is our safety
[1:16:30] this is legalism this is inducing no
[1:16:32] this is our safety look at the world
[1:16:34] it's going crazy
[1:16:36] this is a place god has provided for us
[1:16:39] to be safe from these things
[1:16:42] but you begin to complain about it and
[1:16:44] if we're not careful we reinforce the
[1:16:46] excuses of the prodigals
[1:16:50] you know if i go by
[1:16:54] a restaurant if you travel much you know
[1:16:57] you may get on the internet see good
[1:16:59] reviews about a certain place you go by
[1:17:01] and you look at a restaurant
[1:17:03] especially if i want to go in and eat
[1:17:06] all mcdonald's are basically the same
[1:17:09] well not exactly but
[1:17:12] i went to mcdonald's in the philippines
[1:17:14] and bought a
[1:17:15] egg mcmuffin it tasted just like the
[1:17:17] ones we have here
[1:17:19] but home restaurants and ones where they
[1:17:23] have
[1:17:23] supposedly home cooking and if you ever
[1:17:25] went by one at dinner time or maybe on a
[1:17:27] friday night about six o'clock
[1:17:30] you drive by and there's one car
[1:17:33] and you're pretty sure that's the cook
[1:17:40] and it don't matter how good the reviews
[1:17:41] were who told you
[1:17:43] and let if there's some if there's
[1:17:44] another opportunity down the road you
[1:17:46] say well
[1:17:47] let's just go on to mcdonald's
[1:17:51] because if it was good the locals would
[1:17:52] know right
[1:17:56] people come by the church say well if
[1:17:58] the locals won't go
[1:18:05] people you know and people you take your
[1:18:08] own kids we teach them to dislike the
[1:18:09] message sometimes huh
[1:18:12] well if mom and dad don't care nothing
[1:18:14] about it why should i
[1:18:16] if all i hear around the table is just
[1:18:18] griping about one preacher or another
[1:18:20] what
[1:18:20] you know why should i care
[1:18:24] if all i hear is is how many bad things
[1:18:27] are happening and
[1:18:28] what the church did what they did wrong
[1:18:29] and how this one did this one wrong this
[1:18:30] one did this one wrong why would i go to
[1:18:32] church
[1:18:34] we're just reinforcing the excuse of the
[1:18:36] problems and you go and say lord save my
[1:18:38] children
[1:18:39] lord save us first
[1:18:44] that was free i don't know where that
[1:18:45] come from but
[1:18:48] the locals won't go why should i
[1:18:51] they won't feed on the word why should i
[1:18:54] but god help us
[1:18:55] we've got good food here you got good
[1:18:59] food here if all i did was just read
[1:19:00] scripture all morning
[1:19:01] there's good food there if these
[1:19:04] brothers get up here and preach there's
[1:19:05] good food they begin to preach about the
[1:19:07] word of god
[1:19:08] and inspire drawers it's good food if
[1:19:10] you'll just take advantage of it amen
[1:19:15] he probably got made excuses i won't
[1:19:17] keep you going all day
[1:19:18] i just got five of these this is number
[1:19:20] four so we're close to the end
[1:19:23] maybe you remember it was the
[1:19:25] differences you remember the differences
[1:19:27] it was the
[1:19:27] happy home the pig lot huh the loving
[1:19:31] father
[1:19:32] the citizen of a far country
[1:19:36] clean clothes filthy rags
[1:19:40] a ring of significance just over here he
[1:19:42] don't even belong
[1:19:45] all these things but he just uses these
[1:19:47] as excuses
[1:19:49] you know the prodigal was probably
[1:19:50] embarrassed by the clothes he had to
[1:19:51] wear
[1:19:53] those unfashionable clothes a new robe
[1:19:56] didn't seem so nice when it was
[1:19:57] different from everybody else's
[1:20:00] he didn't dislike them because they
[1:20:02] weren't nice and clean and warm but
[1:20:04] because they identified him with home
[1:20:06] he'd rather for some reason be
[1:20:08] identified with those in walmart
[1:20:14] clothes say two things about you what
[1:20:15] you think about yourself and what you
[1:20:17] want other people to think
[1:20:18] about you remember that
[1:20:22] and you know the world's gone crazy in
[1:20:25] that way physically but i want to look
[1:20:26] at more than just
[1:20:28] just natural clothes but many prodigals
[1:20:31] would come home
[1:20:32] if they just didn't have to wear those
[1:20:33] clothes
[1:20:37] and so some preachers get by with just
[1:20:39] not preaching it
[1:20:41] and the prodigals come and sit and
[1:20:42] they're happy
[1:20:44] but their heart's far from god
[1:20:49] why because if i'm going to come back
[1:20:52] i want to wear what he provides me to
[1:20:54] wear
[1:20:56] and again it speaks to your attitude and
[1:20:58] who you think what you think about
[1:20:59] yourself
[1:21:00] what you want others to think about you
[1:21:02] some might say well if my face looks so
[1:21:04] plain
[1:21:04] i would like to go to church but i can't
[1:21:07] appear in public without makeup
[1:21:09] if i let my hair grow what would people
[1:21:11] think
[1:21:13] you realize what a little thing that is
[1:21:15] over here is heaven
[1:21:18] and here is hell but i got a pretty face
[1:21:25] but see people don't think clearly
[1:21:28] that's why the prodigal son had to come
[1:21:29] to himself
[1:21:31] he had to wake up one day and recognize
[1:21:33] he's not thinking clearly
[1:21:35] over here just a night of pleasure over
[1:21:37] here is is
[1:21:38] his drunkenness and all these things and
[1:21:40] over here is life even you look at the
[1:21:42] life here that we live
[1:21:44] over here is peace and joy and love
[1:21:47] i could have that i could have my
[1:21:49] marriage right but i'll just go over
[1:21:50] here and
[1:21:51] gripe about it why
[1:21:55] you make excuses what somebody else is
[1:21:57] false the church's fault
[1:22:00] what would people think of me if i look
[1:22:01] like they did
[1:22:03] but the bible says many people when you
[1:22:04] speak of church they have a funny idea
[1:22:06] the world when they passed by the church
[1:22:08] he said the body of christ gathered
[1:22:09] together
[1:22:10] that's what he's calling the church he
[1:22:12] said they think of our women with some
[1:22:13] great long stringy hair with black
[1:22:14] dresses and everything
[1:22:16] they think of the men with long fingers
[1:22:18] dressed in black clothes and for some
[1:22:20] reason i see an undertaker in that
[1:22:23] where'd joe go he left me didn't he
[1:22:26] there he is
[1:22:34] long fingers dressed in black clothes
[1:22:37] always condemning them that's not joe
[1:22:40] he said to a good sense of the word
[1:22:42] that's true
[1:22:44] he said because the church is the
[1:22:45] peculiar people
[1:22:47] called out people i don't mean to have
[1:22:49] long fingers and dressed in black
[1:22:51] clothes
[1:22:53] but the fact that it's always condemning
[1:22:54] them that's true
[1:22:56] he said the reason it looks that way to
[1:22:58] that man who wants to judge the church
[1:22:59] in that condition
[1:23:01] now listen let me back up sometimes i
[1:23:03] read these too
[1:23:04] fast there's more food here sometimes
[1:23:06] you eat it too fast you don't get it
[1:23:09] he said the reason it looks that way to
[1:23:11] the man who wants to judge the church
[1:23:14] you realize that when people tell you
[1:23:16] use the excuse well i
[1:23:17] i feel judged if i go to church
[1:23:20] that they're judging the church by
[1:23:24] saying that
[1:23:26] they're judging that the church is that
[1:23:27] way
[1:23:30] all right talk about prejudging
[1:23:33] right so you say i don't want to go to
[1:23:34] church and people will judge me well
[1:23:35] what was that
[1:23:38] that's a judgment right then you just be
[1:23:41] honest with yourself and realize that's
[1:23:42] a judgment
[1:23:43] that i'm making a judgment that the
[1:23:45] church is going to treat me bad you
[1:23:46] don't know because you haven't been
[1:23:51] and the truth is the church don't treat
[1:23:53] you bad but the word is preached
[1:23:55] and sometimes you feel bad
[1:23:58] he said he's always he said the man who
[1:24:00] wants to judge the church in that
[1:24:02] condition is because the church
[1:24:04] is always pointing a condemning finger
[1:24:07] to everything he thinks is good
[1:24:09] and if he's a sinner he thinks sin is
[1:24:11] good the pleasures of life such as
[1:24:13] living in the world
[1:24:14] when the church stands up and condemns
[1:24:16] that thing it looks like a hideous
[1:24:19] animal to him but if he only knows
[1:24:22] he said it's god's only way of bringing
[1:24:24] salvation
[1:24:26] listen it's god's only way of bringing
[1:24:28] to salvation that's right
[1:24:30] expressing the word of god by the lips
[1:24:32] of his servants
[1:24:36] you're looking to say well it's so awful
[1:24:38] the church is so condemning that's not
[1:24:39] what the gospel is
[1:24:41] the gospel come to free us from
[1:24:43] condemnation
[1:24:45] look at isaiah 61 and 1 he said the
[1:24:48] spirit of the lord god is upon me
[1:24:49] because the lord hath anointed me
[1:24:52] not to condem but to preach good tidings
[1:24:54] unto the meek
[1:24:56] he has sent me to bind up the
[1:24:57] brokenhearted
[1:24:59] they they see it as condemnation because
[1:25:01] of the way that they're living but he
[1:25:03] didn't send us for that he sent us to
[1:25:05] bind up the brokenhearted to preach good
[1:25:07] tidings unto the meat to proclaim
[1:25:08] liberty to the captives aren't you glad
[1:25:10] aren't you glad that he he said house of
[1:25:12] hell let loose in the name of jesus
[1:25:16] amen to proclaim liberty to the captives
[1:25:18] and the opening of the prison to them
[1:25:19] that are bound to proclaim
[1:25:21] the acceptable year of the lord the day
[1:25:23] of vengeance of our god to comfort all
[1:25:24] that mourn
[1:25:25] to appoint unto them that mourn in zion
[1:25:27] to give unto them beauty for ashes the
[1:25:29] oil of joy for mourning
[1:25:30] this doesn't sound like a bunch of
[1:25:32] people with long fingers and black
[1:25:33] clothes
[1:25:35] stringy hair what is the preaching of
[1:25:39] the gospel it's how you look at it
[1:25:42] giving beauty for ashes amen the gospel
[1:25:45] didn't give me a sad face and a long
[1:25:47] long hair and a long face to go with it
[1:25:50] but what did it give me it gave me joy
[1:25:52] the oil
[1:25:53] of joy for mourning the garment of
[1:25:56] praise for the spirit of heaviness yes
[1:25:58] this gospel gave me clothes but it
[1:26:00] wasn't these clothes
[1:26:02] it was a garment of praise
[1:26:06] and i had a spirit of heaviness that's
[1:26:07] all i had to trade what a trade
[1:26:09] what a bargain but they might be called
[1:26:12] trees of righteousness the planting of
[1:26:14] the lord that he might be glorified
[1:26:16] the word heaviness in the scripture is
[1:26:17] often translated anxiety
[1:26:21] i i gave him my garment of anxiety my
[1:26:23] worry my fear about tomorrow he gave me
[1:26:25] a garment of praise
[1:26:27] can't get a better deal than that
[1:26:32] how much better the christian looks with
[1:26:35] salvation on
[1:26:39] you can see it but people are blind they
[1:26:42] just can't see it but
[1:26:43] i i beg you today if you could just see
[1:26:46] how much better you look
[1:26:48] with salvation on so much better than
[1:26:51] the filthy rags of man's morality
[1:26:53] that isaiah talks about in isaiah 64 6
[1:26:55] but we are all it's an unclean thing
[1:26:57] and all of our righteousnesses are as
[1:26:59] filthy rags we all do pain as a leaf and
[1:27:01] our iniquities like the wind have taken
[1:27:02] us away
[1:27:03] you look so much better in white robes
[1:27:05] of grace
[1:27:07] you look so much better with peace on
[1:27:09] your face and joy
[1:27:11] love psalms 33 3 and 1 says rejoice in
[1:27:15] the lord are you righteous
[1:27:16] for praises comely for the upright it
[1:27:18] looks good on you
[1:27:20] psalms 147 one praise you the lord for
[1:27:22] it is good to sing praises unto our god
[1:27:24] it is pleasant and praises comely you
[1:27:26] know when you begin to worship god
[1:27:28] when you just really begin to let go and
[1:27:29] begin to worship god for what he's done
[1:27:31] you know what happens you begin to look
[1:27:33] better
[1:27:35] and i don't know about you but i need
[1:27:36] all of that i can get
[1:27:40] you may think i look stupid but god
[1:27:42] thinks i look good
[1:27:44] are you with me now the prodigal
[1:27:48] didn't see that he actually thought the
[1:27:51] clothes
[1:27:52] made him look bad
[1:27:56] he also had an excuse i just don't fit
[1:27:59] in
[1:28:01] and you know if he had access to the
[1:28:04] ring that the father gave him when he
[1:28:05] came back
[1:28:06] it probably didn't fit him as a child
[1:28:09] do you ever think about that he had to
[1:28:12] mature into it
[1:28:15] and the problem with so many people that
[1:28:16] are born in the message is that we
[1:28:18] feel like when we're young and trust me
[1:28:20] i know what i'm talking about because i
[1:28:22] was there
[1:28:24] and you grow up in the message and you
[1:28:26] see all the bad side of it
[1:28:28] so many times and you didn't come out of
[1:28:30] nothing you were born there right
[1:28:33] so you you're sitting there and you're
[1:28:34] thinking well
[1:28:36] what's in this for me and you begin to
[1:28:39] think that
[1:28:40] you begin to think that here's a ring
[1:28:43] here's a
[1:28:44] here's a that's my wedding band here's a
[1:28:47] supernatural
[1:28:48] you know election that i'm supposed to
[1:28:50] have and it don't fit
[1:28:52] i'm supposed to be elected and i want to
[1:28:54] go out and party
[1:28:58] here's your flesh right none of you all
[1:29:01] that were raised in the message you
[1:29:03] didn't think that way but
[1:29:04] i did
[1:29:08] i i want to be like one of the guys i
[1:29:10] want to be like that and
[1:29:11] that just don't seem to fit but one day
[1:29:15] i woke up
[1:29:17] i realized hey you know what i did i
[1:29:20] began reading the church h book
[1:29:24] i didn't have access to a lot of good
[1:29:25] preaching i went and heard the church
[1:29:27] age book and i began to
[1:29:28] read the church book and as i began to
[1:29:30] read it it fit me
[1:29:33] something about the way that he said
[1:29:34] something about what he said it was just
[1:29:36] something it wasn't
[1:29:37] it wasn't i didn't fall in love with a
[1:29:38] man but the word began to begin to grow
[1:29:40] in my life and i began to see that's me
[1:29:43] mama that's me that ring fits but see
[1:29:46] the problem is we try to make it fit
[1:29:48] when they're younger you're elected
[1:29:49] you're elected
[1:29:50] and the truth is it's not the flesh it's
[1:29:51] the seed
[1:29:53] and the seed's never blossomed yet and
[1:29:56] so it seems like it don't fit
[1:29:58] and so maybe as a child you thought well
[1:29:59] i didn't fit in around the church and
[1:30:01] maybe people are thinking that today
[1:30:03] i grew up in church but i don't just
[1:30:04] don't fit in every time i go i feel
[1:30:06] condemned
[1:30:06] don't you realize you got to grow into
[1:30:08] it
[1:30:10] and some of us are still growing into
[1:30:11] election i believe all of us
[1:30:13] are we're still growing into it the ring
[1:30:16] you feel like you don't fit in of course
[1:30:17] you don't because we're with an
[1:30:19] innumerable company of angels
[1:30:21] we're sitting in heavenly places we're
[1:30:24] talking about things here we are in life
[1:30:26] but stewart we're walking around you
[1:30:27] driving tractors or trying to hire
[1:30:30] people and fire them and
[1:30:31] and get mad at people and driving too
[1:30:33] fast and
[1:30:34] whatever else it is that you do
[1:30:39] and i painted brother stewart's life
[1:30:41] pretty good there didn't i
[1:30:45] huh that's life you know
[1:30:48] election don't seem to fit that huh
[1:30:52] let's pick on myself you eat too much
[1:30:55] every morning you wake up today i'm
[1:30:56] going to exercise today i'm going to get
[1:30:58] get it right today i'm going to do
[1:30:59] what's right and then you don't today
[1:31:02] i'm not going to worry and then you
[1:31:03] worry
[1:31:05] don't seem to fit does it you don't have
[1:31:07] to fit this
[1:31:11] amen that ring wasn't made for your
[1:31:14] flesh
[1:31:16] amen it was made for that something on
[1:31:18] the inside
[1:31:19] that's eternal you see the prodigal
[1:31:23] thought he didn't fit in in church but
[1:31:24] he had forgotten who he was
[1:31:27] he had forgotten what he was to grow to
[1:31:28] be one thing remained the same
[1:31:32] even though everything else changed he
[1:31:34] was always a son
[1:31:38] are you with me this morning he was
[1:31:40] always a son
[1:31:41] he was never not a son no matter how
[1:31:44] much it seemed like the ring didn't fit
[1:31:46] no matter how much he despised the
[1:31:48] clothes no matter how much he looked
[1:31:49] down and said oh
[1:31:50] none of these things are me he was still
[1:31:52] a son
[1:31:56] but the branhams tells us this he said
[1:31:58] backsliding is not lost
[1:32:00] he said i want somebody to tell me where
[1:32:01] backsliding is lost and prove it to the
[1:32:03] bible
[1:32:04] the backslider is not lost he's just out
[1:32:06] of fellowship
[1:32:09] you can't be lost how can it be lost
[1:32:12] he's a part of god
[1:32:14] he's a son he's a they're a daughter
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:18] see he interpreted his not fitting in as
[1:32:21] meaning he didn't belong he just needed
[1:32:23] to change
[1:32:24] where it would fit maybe he went tried
[1:32:28] at all maybe his dad had the old ring
[1:32:29] waiting on a chance to give it to his
[1:32:31] son had it sitting up there on the shelf
[1:32:34] little boy who goes and tries it on say
[1:32:35] well that's never going to fit me
[1:32:38] but just wait a while
[1:32:42] just wait a while there are times when
[1:32:44] it seems like election doesn't fit
[1:32:46] but we're still sons
[1:32:50] our lives even may be contrary to the
[1:32:52] thought of us being his bride
[1:32:53] but it doesn't change who we are
[1:32:57] listen brother branham tells us you are
[1:32:58] wearing amen i love this
[1:33:01] you are wearing the wedding band the
[1:33:02] predestinated unmerited grace
[1:33:04] a wedding band of grace unmerited of
[1:33:06] your own god did it himself
[1:33:08] he knew you before the foundation of the
[1:33:10] world so he slipped the wedding band on
[1:33:12] you there
[1:33:13] that fits you amen it may not seem like
[1:33:16] it fits but it fits the real you
[1:33:20] it'll never fit the flesh you've got to
[1:33:22] bring this flesh under subjection to it
[1:33:27] he knew you before the foundation of the
[1:33:28] world so he slipped the wedding band on
[1:33:29] you there put your name on the book
[1:33:31] but isn't it strange he didn't realize
[1:33:34] this in his happy home he didn't know
[1:33:35] who he was
[1:33:37] but he had to go through this pig pen
[1:33:38] this time being in a far country to
[1:33:40] recognize who he was
[1:33:44] and we're talking this morning about
[1:33:45] david by how we travel through different
[1:33:46] things in life and go different places
[1:33:48] and you think
[1:33:48] why did i ever do that but he had to go
[1:33:50] through the pig pen
[1:33:51] joseph had to go to prison before he
[1:33:53] could go to the throne
[1:33:56] brother brown said you know when you get
[1:33:57] the holy ghost you attend a lot of
[1:33:59] obstacles
[1:34:00] many are the afflictions of the
[1:34:01] righteous but god delivereth him out of
[1:34:02] them all
[1:34:03] god brings you right up facing with it
[1:34:05] so he can show you his power and his
[1:34:07] goodness
[1:34:08] he said like i heard the story of the
[1:34:09] shepherd in jerusalem and broke his
[1:34:11] sheep's leg
[1:34:12] they said why you cruel shepherd why
[1:34:13] didn't you break the sheep's leg
[1:34:15] said well she didn't act like she loved
[1:34:16] me
[1:34:18] you get it this morning here's the love
[1:34:20] of god pressing down at every crevice
[1:34:22] trying to get to this young man
[1:34:24] and he acted like he didn't love god
[1:34:27] so god had to let him leave
[1:34:30] in this case he said he broke the
[1:34:32] sheep's leg she didn't act like she
[1:34:34] loved me so i thought i'd just break her
[1:34:35] leg
[1:34:36] so i'd have to give her some special
[1:34:38] attention then she'd love me from then
[1:34:40] on
[1:34:42] sometimes god has to lay you on your
[1:34:43] back with a sickness that the doctor
[1:34:44] says you're gonna die
[1:34:46] god could give you so he could give you
[1:34:47] a little special treatment
[1:34:49] so you'll love him a little more
[1:34:54] it's difficult to resist the purpose of
[1:34:56] god in your life acts 9 5 says
[1:34:58] this is paul on the road to damascus
[1:35:00] he's a new art thou lord
[1:35:01] the lord said i am jesus whom now
[1:35:03] persecutest
[1:35:04] it's hard for you to kick against the
[1:35:06] pricks
[1:35:09] you always were a son you just had to
[1:35:12] come to yourself
[1:35:15] luke 15 to 17 i'm closing in just a
[1:35:17] moment when he came to himself he said
[1:35:19] how many hired servants of my father's
[1:35:21] bread enough in despair and i perish
[1:35:24] with hunger
[1:35:25] i will arise and go to my father say
[1:35:28] unto him father i have sinned against
[1:35:30] heaven
[1:35:31] and before thee and i'm no more worthy
[1:35:32] to be called thy son make me as one of
[1:35:34] thy hired servants
[1:35:36] he realized how much better this was
[1:35:39] than this was
[1:35:41] it was so much better when i had a happy
[1:35:42] home it was so much better all of his
[1:35:44] excuses when he come to himself
[1:35:46] all of his excuses began to melt away
[1:35:48] and he said i realized
[1:35:50] this means something if i could just be
[1:35:54] a servant
[1:35:54] in that house i'd be better off
[1:35:59] i will arise and go to my father and
[1:36:00] will say to him father i have sinned
[1:36:02] against heaven and before thee and him
[1:36:03] no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:36:05] make me as one of the hired servants he
[1:36:07] realized his life could not be sustained
[1:36:09] where he was
[1:36:10] listen that's where every person has to
[1:36:11] get to that's the place where every one
[1:36:13] of us have to get to we got to realize
[1:36:15] that we cannot sustain our spiritual
[1:36:16] life
[1:36:17] in the condition that we're in there's
[1:36:20] got to be
[1:36:20] something that will keep that life alive
[1:36:23] in us
[1:36:24] he realized we can't live like this
[1:36:26] anymore there was a place he belonged
[1:36:30] prodigal why not why not
[1:36:35] he rose verse 20 came to his father
[1:36:38] when he was yet a great way off a great
[1:36:41] way off
[1:36:43] amen he may not have made it all the way
[1:36:46] back by himself he was a great way off
[1:36:49] but his father saw him and had
[1:36:51] compassion
[1:36:53] and ran amen aren't you glad he ran to
[1:36:56] you
[1:36:58] he ran and fell on his neck and kissed
[1:37:00] him and the son said to him father
[1:37:02] i've sinned against heaven and thy sight
[1:37:04] and them no more worthy to be called thy
[1:37:05] son
[1:37:06] but the father said to his servants
[1:37:08] bring forth the best robe
[1:37:10] put it on him amen put a ring on his
[1:37:14] hand that ring that didn't used to fit
[1:37:15] put it on him
[1:37:17] let him know he's elected let him know
[1:37:19] he can those those clothes fit him
[1:37:21] put shoes on his feet bring him to the
[1:37:22] fatted calf kill it that whole food that
[1:37:25] he didn't used to like
[1:37:26] bring it let's bring it in he likes it
[1:37:28] now he's come home
[1:37:31] let us eat and be merry for this my son
[1:37:34] was dead
[1:37:35] and is alive again he was lost in his
[1:37:37] found and they began to be
[1:37:40] merry you see this morning all of heaven
[1:37:44] is waiting to rejoice with you if you
[1:37:45] become
[1:37:46] prodigal in some way in your life all of
[1:37:48] heaven is waiting
[1:37:50] to rejoice your excuses will seem like
[1:37:53] nothing in the light of his compassion
[1:37:56] come home if you begin he will meet you
[1:37:59] your father will not leave you afar off
[1:38:03] we refuse to surrender when we think the
[1:38:06] journey is too long
[1:38:08] it's just too far to go back but come
[1:38:10] home if you start coming he'll come and
[1:38:12] meet you
[1:38:16] musicians go ahead and come sometime in
[1:38:19] the 1700s joseph harp
[1:38:21] was born in a christian home but he soon
[1:38:24] left to just begin living like a
[1:38:26] libertine in his own
[1:38:27] according to his own morals his own
[1:38:29] moral code
[1:38:31] he despised christianity he wrote a
[1:38:35] pamphlet
[1:38:36] addressed to john wesley who was the
[1:38:39] messenger of that day in the preeminent
[1:38:41] preacher in england at that time he
[1:38:44] titled it the unreasonableness of
[1:38:46] religion
[1:38:47] the unreasonableness of religion
[1:38:51] but he got to be around 50 years old and
[1:38:53] he began to realize
[1:38:54] maybe that religion wasn't so
[1:38:56] unreasonable
[1:38:58] he began to seek for god one day under
[1:39:01] george whitfield's preaching he finally
[1:39:03] got converted
[1:39:04] he found true salvation later in life he
[1:39:08] published a hymn book which
[1:39:10] including included his version of a song
[1:39:12] an old english folk song
[1:39:14] and i'll just read a couple verses from
[1:39:16] it it was his testimony he says i will
[1:39:18] arise and go to jesus
[1:39:20] he took it from the prodigal son will
[1:39:23] arise see
[1:39:23] there's got to be something in your
[1:39:24] heart when you wake up and you say i'll
[1:39:26] go
[1:39:27] i will arise and go to jesus
[1:39:31] he will embrace me with his arms in the
[1:39:34] arms of my dear savior oh there are ten
[1:39:36] thousand
[1:39:37] charms come you weary heavy laden austin
[1:39:40] ruined by the fall

[1:39:43] never come at all
[1:39:45] let not conscience make you linger nor a
[1:39:48] fitness fondly dream in other words
[1:39:49] don't wait till you're better
[1:39:52] don't wait until well if i could only
[1:39:53] quit my smoking if i could quit my
[1:39:55] drinking don't think
[1:39:56] dream of fitness all the fitness he
[1:39:58] requireth
[1:40:00] is to feel your need of him

[1:40:09] bow your heads with me if you can begin
[1:40:11] to play something softly
[1:40:14] why not
[1:40:18] if you're prodigal if you've wasted the
[1:40:20] talents that god gave you in some way
[1:40:22] i know i'm preaching to a group of
[1:40:23] christians today and
[1:40:27] maybe you wasted that in some way
[1:40:30] why not come home
[1:40:34] maybe you'll watch this
[1:40:38] i know it's a long-term thing i don't
[1:40:40] expect
[1:40:42] overnight for the church to be full of
[1:40:44] people who once served god and have come
[1:40:46] back
[1:40:49] but if you've left god in your heart
[1:40:52] you're still sitting here on the pews
[1:40:53] you've left god in your heart
[1:40:56] your heart this morning is far from god
[1:40:58] would you say i will arise
[1:41:01] go to my father
[1:41:04] he's coming to meet you this morning
[1:41:07] maybe you're watching today and

[1:41:21] father
