[14:30] determined to get right in the
[14:34] way and turn us from the way of life and
[14:40] lead our souls astray. Oh, but I'm not
[14:44] giving
[14:46] up. I'm not turning around.
[14:50] Oh, by the grace of God, I'll wear a
[14:55] shining crown someday. Oh, but I'll keep

[28:54] Sister Ellis Stender has a song. So,
[28:56] just make yourself ready just as soon as
[28:58] they're done.
[29:06] [Music]
[29:16] How many times can you hear the same
[29:18] lies before you start to believe
[29:23] it? The enemy keeps whispering to me.
[29:27] These days all that I'm
[29:31] hearing. I used to know who I was. Now I
[29:35] look in the mirror and I'm not so
[29:40] sure. Lord, I don't want to listen to
[29:43] the lies
[29:48] anymore. The truth is I am a father's
[29:52] child. I make him proud and I make him
[29:56] smile. I was made in the image of a
[30:00] perfect king. He looks at me on a change
[30:04] of day. The truth is I am truly loved by
[30:10] a God who's good when I'm not good
[30:13] enough. I don't belong to the lies. I
[30:17] belong to
[30:20] you. And that's the truth.
[30:28] When I feel like there's so much noise
[30:31] living free in my
[30:35] head, heaven finds me in a still small
[30:39] voice and it sounds like grace
[30:43] instead. You remind me who I am when I
[30:47] look in the mirror and I'm not so
[30:52] sure. Lord, I don't want to listen to
[30:56] lies
[30:59] anymore. The truth is I am a father's
[31:04] child. I make him proud and I make him
[31:08] smile. I was made in the image of a
[31:11] perfect king. He looks at me don't want
[31:15] to change a thing. The truth is I am
[31:19] truly loved by a God who's good when I'm
[31:24] not good enough. I don't belong to the
[31:28] lies that belong to you.
[31:33] And that's the
[31:35] truth. Cuz I know who I
[31:39] am. Cuz I know who you are. And I hold
[31:45] these truths inside my
[31:50] heart. I know the lies are always going
[31:53] to try and find me, but I've never been
[31:56] so
[32:00] sure. Truth is, I am a father's child. I
[32:06] make him proud and I make him smile. I
[32:10] was made in the image of a perfect king.
[32:14] He looks at me, don't I want to change a
[32:17] thing. The truth is I am truly loved by
[32:22] a God who's good when I'm not good
[32:25] enough. I don't belong to the lies. I
[32:29] belong to
[32:33] you. And that's the truth.
[32:42] And that's the truth.
[32:45] [Music]
[32:50] [Applause]
[33:26] [Music]
[33:38] deep. True.
[33:41] [Music]
[33:58] You are the
[34:05] healer. Healer of my heart.
[34:13] The maker and the God of all
[34:19] we
[34:21] [Music]
[34:27] are. I was the
[34:35] broken vessel in your hand.
[34:42] You looked beyond the hurt and made me
[34:48] whole
[34:52] again. Healer of the
[34:56] broken
[34:59] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[35:04] new.
[35:08] Now my whole life I
[35:12] surrender. Lay it down before the
[35:16] men. I give my life to you.
[35:24] Love that saw me before I knew
[35:30] you has brought me near to where you
[35:34] are.
[35:39] Now I live to praise
[35:42] you ever. May I praise you, the healer
[35:48] of my heart.
[35:58] Nothing compares
[36:01] [Music]
[36:04] Lord to knowing
[36:08] [Music]
[36:11] you and seeing what the grace of God can
[36:18] do.
[36:23] You faithfully saw
[36:29] me when you called me your
[36:40] own. You made a way to bring my
[36:44] wondering heart back home.
[36:52] Healer of the
[36:54] broken
[36:58] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[37:02] new.
[37:07] Now my whole life I
[37:10] surrender. Lay it down before the
[37:14] men. I give my life to you.
[37:21] Love that saw me before I knew
[37:27] you has brought me near to where you
[37:31] are.
[37:37] Now I live to praise
[37:39] you ever may I praise you. The healer of
[37:45] my heart.
[37:50] Healer of the
[37:52] broken
[37:56] pieces. You touched my heart and made it
[38:04] new. Now my whole life I
[38:08] surrender. Lay it down before the
[38:12] mener. I give my life to
[38:18] you. Love that saw me before I knew
[38:25] you has brought me near to where you
[38:29] are.
[38:35] Now I live to praise
[38:38] you ever. May I praise you, the healer
[38:43] of my heart.
[38:49] Now I live to praise
[38:52] you ever. May I praise you, the healer
[38:57] of my
[39:03] [Music]
[39:08] heart, man. You enjoy those specials
[39:10] tonight. Amen. Give our singers another
[39:13] hand if you would.
[39:18] Amen. I'm learning to lean. Learning to
[39:20] lean on Jesus. Are you ready for the
[39:22] word of the Lord tonight? Can we stand
[39:25] together? Amen. I know we're a needy
[39:27] people. If we have a need on our heart
[39:29] tonight, I like what that song said.
[39:31] He's the healer of the broken heart. He
[39:34] knows the heart. He knows everything you
[39:36] have need of here tonight. If there's a
[39:38] person in the building that feels like
[39:40] they need a touch from the Lord, I
[39:41] believe this can be your night. And just
[39:43] go ahead, just open up your heart. Just
[39:45] remember, he can walk up and down the
[39:46] aisle. He can meet every person, every
[39:48] need. And when I I thought back, Sister
[39:51] Stephanie, not to call you out, but I
[39:52] remember the day you come back to the
[39:53] Lord, and I didn't expect it, but I
[39:55] remember it happening. And I thought,
[39:56] you know, any service, God can do
[39:59] anything he wants to do. So, we just
[40:01] open up our hearts and give everything
[40:03] to him. Can we do that tonight? Well,
[40:05] I'm
[40:07] learning to lean. Can we do that? Oh,
[40:10] I'm
[40:13] learning. Yes, we
[40:15] are
[40:18] learning to
[40:20] lean on
[40:25] Jesus. Well, I'm
[40:28] finding more
[40:31] power than I'd
[40:34] ever dreamed.
[40:36] Oh, I'm
[40:39] learning to
[40:42] lean on
[40:44] Jesus. Oh, one more time as our pastor
[40:47] comes now. I'm
[40:49] learning to lean. I wonder if we just
[40:52] put our hands up to him. Amen. If you're
[40:55] learning to surrender to him. Oh, I'm
[41:00] learning to
[41:02] lean on
[41:07] Jesus. Well, I'm
[41:10] finding more
[41:13] power than I
[41:16] ever
[41:18] dreamed. Oh, I'm
[41:21] learning to
[41:23] lean on Jesus. One more time with all
[41:27] your hearts now. Oh yes, I'm
[41:31] learning to
[41:34] leave. I'm
[41:36] learning. It's Lord to leave.
[41:40] And I'm
[41:41] learning to
[41:44] lean on Jesus.
[41:47] [Music]
[41:50] Oh, I'm
[41:52] finding more
[41:55] power than I
[41:57] ever
[41:59] dream. Oh, I'm
[42:02] learning to
[42:04] lean on
[42:09] Jesus. Let's bow our heads together. If
[42:12] you got a special request you'd like to
[42:13] make known tonight, lifting your hand, I
[42:16] know God sees every heart, knows every
[42:17] hand. Lord Jesus, you know the purpose
[42:20] behind these requests. Lord, you know
[42:23] even more than we know. Lord, we may
[42:25] think we know what we want or what we
[42:26] need, but you know what we really need.
[42:29] And I pray, God, that you would just
[42:31] speak directly to your people tonight. I
[42:34] pray you'd move me out of the way, Lord.
[42:36] I'm ineffective in myself. I know I
[42:38] can't do it, but Lord, I know that you
[42:40] can. I pray God that you just somehow
[42:43] take a your your servant, Lord, and and
[42:47] just just bind me to you tonight. Lift
[42:49] me up in your arms, oh God. Lift up
[42:51] these people, Lord, so that we could
[42:53] hear and we could preach. We could do
[42:55] what we're called to do. Pray you'd heal
[42:57] the sick, Lord. And whatever need that
[42:59] they had, Lord. I pray that it would be
[43:01] met tonight. God, we need you in this
[43:04] service. I can't make it without you. I
[43:06] can't can't do it, Lord, without your
[43:08] help. But I pray God that you would just
[43:11] move and help us Lord and we'll give you
[43:13] the praise and the glory and the honor
[43:15] in Jesus name.
[43:19] Amen. Amen. First Kings chapter 17,
[43:22] we'll start reading in verse 8 and read
[43:24] verses 8 and 9. First Kings 17 8 and 9.
[43:29] And the word of the Lord came unto him,
[43:31] saying, Arise, get thee to Zerapath,
[43:35] which belongth to Zidon, and dwell
[43:38] there. Behold, I have commanded a widow
[43:41] woman there to sustain thee. Amen. I
[43:45] pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[43:46] the word. You may be
[43:53] seated. Excuse me.
[44:07] Elijah was pretty comfortable by the
[44:10] brook. He had uh servants feeding him
[44:14] and giving him sandwiches and he he
[44:17] wasn't hurt that badly by what was going
[44:21] on in the kingdom at that time. He was
[44:25] protected by
[44:26] God. The widow was another story. She
[44:30] suffered with the rest of the country.
[44:34] In fact, that morning she woke up the
[44:36] morning that God spoke to Elijah and
[44:39] said, "Go down to the city." God didn't
[44:42] tell her that. Told him that. And she
[44:46] woke up that morning realizing that she
[44:49] didn't have enough to make it. I know
[44:51] sometimes we get to where you don't have
[44:53] enough money to make it to the end of
[44:55] the month or the end of the week and you
[44:57] wonder how it's going to happen and
[44:58] somehow God provides. But this was a
[45:01] life or death situation. She she knew
[45:04] that it wasn't just money. There was
[45:06] just no food to be had. It was a
[45:09] situation the conditions were such that
[45:11] they hadn't had any rain in three years.
[45:16] Think about that for a minute. How how
[45:18] hard how difficult that would be. the
[45:21] time that had passed during that three
[45:22] years between the time that Elijah gave
[45:25] the prophecy and now this widow and and
[45:27] so for a long time they had not had any
[45:30] any rain and there there had been no you
[45:33] know and over time there's no crops if
[45:35] there's no rain there's no crops if
[45:37] there's no rain there's no there's no
[45:40] growth and I think the same thing is
[45:42] true of a church if we don't have the
[45:44] reign of the Holy Spirit we don't have
[45:46] see any growth in the people I'm not
[45:48] talking about numbers but I'm talking
[45:49] about growth in our own hearts. We must
[45:52] have the presence of God. We got to have
[45:54] the rain. It's got to be here. And I
[45:56] think we ought to desire that with all
[45:58] of our hearts. Lord, don't let me get
[46:00] dry. Don't let me get become a desert in
[46:02] my life. Let me let me have the rain in
[46:04] my life. Let my prayer life be right and
[46:07] things be right. And may I be able to
[46:09] feel your presence. And so she was she
[46:12] was living in bad, terrible conditions.
[46:14] She woke up that morning and it's
[46:16] already hot. It's always hot in those
[46:17] countries over there. We think about a
[46:19] drought over here and how bad it gets.
[46:21] You know how the grass gets and
[46:22] everything. But you talk about over
[46:24] there, there's no water. There's no
[46:26] water above the ground, under the
[46:27] ground, there's just no water at all.
[46:29] It's a desert country anyway. And then
[46:31] you add that a drought to that and the
[46:34] springs start drying up and the rivers
[46:35] start drying up. And after a while, it's
[46:37] not just that there's no water, there's
[46:39] no way to get any water. And it's not
[46:41] just there's no food. There's no way to
[46:43] get any food. You can't just go pay more
[46:45] money to get food because there's none
[46:47] to be had. you could have a million
[46:48] dollars that wouldn't buy a loaf of
[46:50] bread. And so that's the condition that
[46:52] she was in. And she knew there was no
[46:55] way to change that. She was certain that
[46:58] this was the last day she would ever
[47:00] spend on the earth because of the
[47:03] conditions that she was living in. But
[47:05] she failed to recognize that God was
[47:08] working on the case all the time. And
[47:10] before she'd ever gotten in that
[47:12] condition, she'd already had a provision
[47:15] made for her because she was elected by
[47:18] God to host Elijah in her home that that
[47:22] the message of the hour would be present
[47:25] in her home. And she was the elect
[47:27] gentile lady that would that would
[47:30] sustain Elijah. He said, "I've
[47:32] commanded." She didn't know she was
[47:34] commanded. He he she never heard a
[47:36] voice. She never saw a vision. She never
[47:39] even talked. But God probably never
[47:41] talked to her about it. But what was it?
[47:43] He commanded her in the sense that he
[47:45] knew that she would do it. She would she
[47:48] would give him the loaf of bread. She
[47:50] would give him she would make him the
[47:51] cake. She would she would give him the
[47:53] water. Oh my. She would surrender
[47:55] herself. God knew it. Why did God call
[47:57] you to the message of the hour? He knew
[47:59] that you would surrender yourself when
[48:01] everything looked hopeless. He knew that
[48:03] you would give yourselves to the word.
[48:05] He knew who you were. And so he chose
[48:08] you as a gentile widow, as a gentile
[48:11] bride. I'm so thankful for that today.
[48:14] So the conditions that she was in was a
[48:18] reflection of the sin and the moral
[48:20] decay of the nation. And we know that
[48:23] there there's that's the case today as
[48:25] well. But brother Brandham said there
[48:26] had been no king as wicked as Ahab. He
[48:29] being taught and knew better, he failed
[48:32] not, this is a remarkable statement, he
[48:34] failed not to continue to displease God
[48:37] in everything he did.
[48:41] You Ahab was so bad at being a
[48:44] Christian, as we would say today. He was
[48:46] a Jew, right? He he was supposed to be
[48:49] somebody who knew better. He was taught
[48:51] better. He was so bad at it that he
[48:53] failed not to continue to displease God.
[48:56] So everything Ahab did displeased God.
[48:58] Yeah. Yeah, he just made every decision
[49:00] he made. He never made the right
[49:02] decision. He was always making the wrong
[49:04] decision up to this time. And and so it
[49:07] had caused this condition to come. It
[49:09] got the attention of a prophet. And so
[49:12] he said, although he had a great
[49:13] military system and the people had
[49:15] become very prosperous under his reign,
[49:17] but you cannot displease God and expect
[49:20] to get by very long. I know people think
[49:22] they can get away with it, but
[49:23] eventually it's going to catch up to you
[49:25] if you displease God. But I want to be
[49:27] have a testimony like uh uh like the one
[49:30] who got caught away. I'm I'm I'm tired
[49:33] tonight. But Joel, you're going to have
[49:34] to help me. Enoch. Enoch got caught
[49:37] away. I should know that, shouldn't I?
[49:38] I'm the pastor. But but Enoch got caught
[49:41] away. I want a testimony like that
[49:42] because he said he didn't not fail to
[49:44] displease God. But he didn't fail to
[49:46] please God. Oh, I'm so glad we can have
[49:48] a testimony like that today. He had this
[49:51] testimony. The Bible says before he was
[49:53] translation that he pleased God. word.
[49:56] Amen. How can you please God? By
[49:58] surrendering to his word. You can't
[50:00] please God just by effort. You can't
[50:02] please God just by being a good person,
[50:04] but by accepting the cup of salvation
[50:07] and being what God called you to be. We
[50:09] can please God today. I don't believe
[50:11] he's put it out here like a carrot on a
[50:12] stick way far ahead of us where we can't
[50:14] please him and we can't ever be right
[50:16] and we can't ever feel clean, but I
[50:18] believe it's right here for you tonight.
[50:20] If you want to please God, you can
[50:21] please God. You can have God in your
[50:23] life. Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. I Let's have
[50:28] church tonight. How about it? I'm not
[50:30] going to hold you home, but let's have
[50:31] church tonight. Amen. I love the word of
[50:33] God. Look, brother said the hot winds of
[50:35] judgment was blowing upon a nation. Yes,
[50:37] sir. That had forgotten God. He said it
[50:40] was Is Ahab was Israel's most cruel and
[50:42] wicked king and he married a sinner.
[50:43] Jezebel who was an idoltor and she was a
[50:46] very attractive little woman. Ahab just
[50:47] kind of a lukewarm believer, you know,
[50:49] she kind of led him around, you know,
[50:52] and had given to her ideas and said,
[50:54] "Oh, well, religion is nothing for me. I
[50:55] I'm a king." You know, in other words,
[50:57] I, you know, I'm not a preacher. What
[51:00] does it matter to me which religion the
[51:01] people serve, right? He said, "Long had
[51:04] they tore down the altars of God and put
[51:06] up the altars of Baal." And the cry been
[51:08] so much against the true religion till
[51:11] the ministers under the great strain had
[51:14] given way. If there ever was a time we
[51:16] needed to pray for the ministry, it's
[51:17] now. Why? Because I'm not talking about
[51:20] me church. I'm talking about over over
[51:22] the entire uh world. I see it. This
[51:24] great strain on the ministry. And what
[51:26] is this strain? It's it's a pull of the
[51:28] world and it's a pull of the many times
[51:31] congregations and I'm so glad we don't
[51:33] have a pull here against the word. I
[51:35] believe your pull is for the word. You
[51:37] want to hear the word, but in many
[51:39] places there's actually a pull against
[51:40] the word. People don't want to hear the
[51:42] word no more. They don't want to hear
[51:44] the truth anymore. And so there's this
[51:46] pull against the people of against the
[51:49] the ministry wanting them to to to just
[51:51] just leave it alone. Don't preach it no
[51:53] more. Don't declare the message anymore.
[51:55] Quit quit using quotes. Quit doing this
[51:57] that or the other. And it's a constant
[51:59] pull on the ministry to try to get them.
[52:01] But but look, he said some time ago, I
[52:03] made a remark about ministers and a
[52:05] group met me and said, "Brother Brandon,
[52:06] our congregation just pulls onto us onto
[52:09] us." He said, "That's what causes it.
[52:10] The congregation will walk out. if the
[52:12] minister don't please them. He said in
[52:14] so long had the ministers fell into the
[52:16] impact of the king because sin was
[52:18] permitted. There was no limits. When I
[52:21] read that, I thought, my goodness,
[52:23] that's the age we're living in. There
[52:25] was no limits. There's no limits on the
[52:27] schools. There's no limits on the
[52:28] teachers. There's no limits on the
[52:30] people. There's no limits on the
[52:31] churches. You just live however you want
[52:33] to. Do whatever you want to. Right? And
[52:35] that's the way it was in Ahab's time.
[52:37] There was no limits. And I tell you what
[52:38] it's led to today. It led to a natural
[52:40] famine then, but today it's led to a
[52:43] spiritual famine. They said there will
[52:44] come a day when they'll look to and fro
[52:46] and they won't be able to find the word
[52:48] of God. But I'm so glad that we found it
[52:50] today. We're we're sitting by an
[52:52] artisian. Well, we found a sustaining
[52:54] word. Amen. Amen.
[52:58] Amen. People can go out and do what they
[52:59] want to do. If you want to go out and
[53:01] and let your family be like the world
[53:03] and if that's going to be the pattern,
[53:05] but but I see a lot of brokenness.
[53:09] I see a lot of trouble. Yeah. See a lot
[53:11] of struggle out there and it's a free
[53:13] country. People can do that. But I don't
[53:15] want that for my family. I don't want
[53:17] that for our church family. If we can
[53:18] help it. If there's any way we can help
[53:20] it. I want to still preach the word of
[53:22] God because it's the word that sets us
[53:24] free. It doesn't bind us, but it
[53:26] actually releases us.
[53:28] Sets us
[53:30] free. He said as long as the nation said
[53:32] so, it was all right. The nation had
[53:35] endorsed sin. That's why they say today,
[53:37] as long as the nation says it's all
[53:38] right to sell beer, then it's all right
[53:40] to drink it. You know, just because you
[53:42] turn 18 don't mean it's right to drink.
[53:44] Or is it 21? I don't even know the
[53:47] age. But I remember turning that age.
[53:50] Well, Jared, I don't remember having any
[53:51] thought in my heart at all about drink
[53:54] because I was a Christian. Right. Right.
[53:56] Just cuz I was free, you know, it don't
[53:59] mean I I just did whatever I wanted to
[54:00] do. I was a Christian. And I was still
[54:02] responsible. Don't mean I didn't make
[54:04] mistakes, but I was responsible before
[54:06] God. That's the way our young people
[54:07] have to be. The rules aren't going to
[54:08] hold them in forever. Right. Right. At
[54:11] some point, young person, you got to you
[54:13] got to be willing to live for God
[54:14] because it's the right thing to do. Not
[54:16] because mama said so, not because daddy
[54:18] said so. Because there's something in
[54:20] your heart that says, "I want to live
[54:21] for God. I love him with all of my
[54:23] heart. I I love this message. I want to
[54:25] I want my family, if I have one. I want
[54:27] it to be what this message is."
[54:30] Amen. And and he said, "If if it's if
[54:32] the nation says it's all right to
[54:34] half-dress on the street and the law
[54:35] won't run them in, well, it's all right
[54:36] to do it." He said, "That might be all
[54:38] right to the nation, but in God's great
[54:40] books, you're responsible and we have to
[54:42] answer before God." But they had fallen.
[54:44] They'd give way under the load. Yeah.
[54:47] The ministers had. So I said, "Pray for
[54:49] the ministry that they'd stand for the
[54:50] word of God." Yeah. This was the
[54:52] conditions of the age, but God still
[54:54] made a way for the believers. I'm so
[54:57] glad that he makes a way. Listen to me,
[54:59] church. He's made a way for us as a
[55:01] church. He makes a way for you as an
[55:02] individual. Brother Brandham said during
[55:04] that time he he said he was going to
[55:06] punish the unbeliever. He made a way for
[55:08] the believer. The same thing. Someone
[55:11] say the same thing. The same thing he
[55:14] does each time. He's a God who does it.
[55:16] If he ever did it once, he'll do it
[55:17] again. The same thing he did for them,
[55:20] he'll do for you. If he made a way for
[55:21] the believer then, he'll make a way for
[55:23] the believer now. Yes, sir. Yeah. He
[55:25] said he made a way for Noah when he it
[55:27] was the boat that he was building was
[55:29] the way. He made a way in the Red Sea
[55:31] when there was no way. He made a way for
[55:34] them to cross. What was it? He said how
[55:35] God makes his way. He said and where
[55:37] there is no way. He is that
[55:40] way. Oh, I've been there. Church, you
[55:43] may pray and cry and pray and cry and
[55:44] wonder what am I ever going to do? I get
[55:46] that way as a pastor some. What am I
[55:48] going to do? How am I going to do it?
[55:50] Moses got that way. He said, "How am I
[55:51] going to lead this great people and all
[55:53] these oxen? There's no water in the
[55:54] desert. There's no food stored. How are
[55:56] we going to do it? How are we going to
[55:57] make it through life? Some of y'all face
[55:59] life and look at it like that. Say, "How
[56:00] in the world are we ever going to make
[56:02] it?" But remember, if he asks you to do
[56:04] it, he'll make a way for you to do it.
[56:06] I'm so thankful for that. He will equip
[56:09] you with the ability to do what he's
[56:11] called you to do. He You might pray and
[56:13] cry and pray and cry, but he's working
[56:15] all the time. Yeah. Don't give up now.
[56:18] Be certain of God. Yes.
[56:22] You young people, don't give up. Be
[56:24] certain. Come on. I know what God said.
[56:26] I know what a prophet taught. I know
[56:28] what the word teaches. I believe the
[56:30] Bible. I believe in morality. I believe
[56:32] I don't have to give up on those things.
[56:34] Yeah. So, I don't see a way. He'll make
[56:37] a way. He'll be that way.
[56:40] Very good.
[56:42] So, he rose and went to Zerapath.
[56:45] You just imagine then coming. Brother
[56:46] Brandon called him a woolly worm in one
[56:48] place. One place he called him a fuzzy
[56:51] face. And here he comes, a bald-headed,
[56:54] whiskered prophet coming down. Makes me
[56:57] want to grow a beard if I could. Peter
[57:00] can grow a beard by thinking about it,
[57:02] you know. And I
[57:03] can't I can't do
[57:06] that. I try every time we go on vacation
[57:09] or something, I try to grow a beard. My
[57:10] wife says, "Cut it off. Just shave it."
[57:12] You
[57:13] [Laughter]
[57:15] know, I've tried that for years. Here he
[57:19] comes walking up to the gate and when he
[57:22] gets up to the where the widow woman was
[57:23] there gathering
[57:25] sticks. Oh my. Come looked over the gate
[57:29] and there she is. He said you know God
[57:32] said I'm going to send you to the widow.
[57:34] And the widow was there at the right
[57:36] time in the right place.
[57:40] Amen. The Bible says she was gathering
[57:42] sticks and he called to her and said,
[57:44] "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water
[57:48] in a vessel." Yeah. That I may drink.
[57:52] Of all the people in the city to ask for
[57:56] water during a three-year
[57:59] drought, he asked a widow. Yeah.
[58:03] He come to the poorest person in the
[58:06] city.
[58:08] But he will not ask something of you
[58:11] that he will not provide for you. That's
[58:14] right. That's good. Oh, I hope you're
[58:16] hearing me tonight. Yeah. He will not
[58:19] ask something of you that he will not
[58:22] provide for you. All right. If he asks
[58:25] you to be a man and to provide for your
[58:28] family and do what needs to be done for
[58:30] your family, he will provide the ability
[58:32] to do that somehow. He will do that.
[58:35] Right? If he asks you to be a mother and
[58:37] take care of your children, he'll
[58:38] provide the ability to do that. Yeah.
[58:41] Somehow he'll make a way. If he asks you
[58:44] for water, he'll provide a way for you
[58:46] to have water. Yeah. If he asks you to
[58:49] come to church, he'll provide a church
[58:50] for you to go to. If he asks you to live
[58:52] for God, he'll provide a way for you to
[58:54] live it. Oh my. He'll provide overcoming
[58:58] sustaining power. Listen, if he asks you
[59:01] to go, he'll he'll provide a way for you
[59:03] to go. She started walking back. You
[59:07] know, I love the I love the fact that
[59:08] she's just going to give him the water,
[59:11] right? She's just going to give him
[59:12] Maybe she had enough for two days water,
[59:15] but she only had enough for one day to
[59:18] eat.
[59:20] Yeah. And so she goes to get the water.
[59:23] She started walking back. About that
[59:25] time, she heard a voice. As she turned
[59:28] to look, there was a kind-l looking old
[59:29] bald-headed
[59:31] gentleman standing at the gate with a
[59:34] long flowing
[59:36] whiskers. He said, "Would you fetch me
[59:38] just a little drink of
[59:41] water?" He said, "Maybe on her lips she
[59:43] was ready to
[59:45] say, I just have a little bit." Water
[59:48] was scarce. All the springs was dry. He
[59:51] said, "What was it?" God works on both
[59:53] ends of the line.
[59:56] God had showed Elijah a vision. Go down
[59:58] into the city, for I've commanded not
[59:59] the ravens this time to feed you. But I
[1:00:01] commanded a widow woman to sustain you
[1:00:03] and took him to the poorest of the
[1:00:05] poorest. See, if God's called you to
[1:00:07] preach, he'll give you a congregation to
[1:00:09] preach to. You won't have to scare one
[1:00:11] up. You won't have to you won't have to
[1:00:12] call everybody try to find a place to
[1:00:14] preach. If God gave you a place, an
[1:00:16] ability to preach, he'll give you
[1:00:17] somebody to preach to. I think of
[1:00:19] brother Andrew Glover, I think he's told
[1:00:20] the story here. Brother Andrew's been
[1:00:22] such a blessing to us and all around the
[1:00:24] world. And and brother Andrew was uh
[1:00:27] telling me I think he's told the story
[1:00:28] over the pulpit. He said a man told him
[1:00:30] he said, "Brother Andrew," he said, he
[1:00:32] said, "you preach the message." He said,
[1:00:34] "If you got nobody to preach to, go and
[1:00:35] he said, "Preach." He said, "Get a
[1:00:37] stump." He said, "And preach to the
[1:00:39] stump." He said, "Because God will
[1:00:40] provide somebody to sit on that stump
[1:00:43] and hear the message, right? Because the
[1:00:45] message is true. We're called to preach,
[1:00:48] right? We're called to preach and and
[1:00:50] God will provide the listener. you're
[1:00:52] you're called. And it goes down to each
[1:00:53] one of us lay members and preachers and
[1:00:55] whoever we are. If God asked you to do
[1:00:57] something, he provides a way for you to
[1:00:59] do it. And so he said, "Not the ravens
[1:01:02] this time to feed you, but I'm commanded
[1:01:03] a widow woman to sustain you and took
[1:01:06] him to the poorest of the poors." He's
[1:01:08] on he's down in the poor part of the
[1:01:10] city. He's across the tracks. He's on
[1:01:12] Skid Row. He's at the very bottom of the
[1:01:14] of the barrel. And she's probably
[1:01:16] sitting there thinking, "There's many
[1:01:17] people in the city that got more water,
[1:01:20] more food than me. All I got is for one
[1:01:22] day. They're at least going to live two
[1:01:23] or three days. I've got enough just for
[1:01:25] one day for me and my son.
[1:01:28] Oh my. And but he took him to her house
[1:01:31] and it was grace to her. Now I want you
[1:01:34] to understand what this message is. This
[1:01:36] message is not condemnation. It's grace.
[1:01:38] This message is not a book of rules.
[1:01:40] It's grace. It come to her like a book
[1:01:43] of rules. When she heard it, she it
[1:01:45] sound like something she had to do. But
[1:01:47] what it really was was grace. Yes. Oh,
[1:01:50] God. Her surrender was grace. That's
[1:01:52] what you don't realize. That's why so
[1:01:54] many people are afraid to surrender.
[1:01:56] They're afraid to give up what they
[1:01:57] have. But your surrender is actually
[1:01:59] grace. Because the moment you surrender,
[1:02:01] he's able to come in and fix what you
[1:02:03] can't fix. He's able to come in and be
[1:02:05] what you can't be. He's able to come in
[1:02:07] and live how you can't live. Yes. While
[1:02:10] you surrender to an almighty God,
[1:02:15] hallelujah. to Jehovah Gyra, your
[1:02:17] provider. Said, "I've commanded a widow
[1:02:20] woman to sustain you. I've commanded it.
[1:02:23] I've ordained it." And she didn't even
[1:02:25] have enough meal in the barrel for her
[1:02:27] and her son to live that day. He said,
[1:02:30] "Blessed be the name of the Lord." When
[1:02:31] God ordains anything, it's got to
[1:02:33] happen. It'll be there. God will meet
[1:02:36] it. I've commanded the widow to there to
[1:02:39] take care of you and sustain
[1:02:43] you. And she turns around. She starts to
[1:02:45] walk
[1:02:46] away. She's going to fetch it. Sometimes
[1:02:50] simple obedience is all he requires.
[1:02:53] She's making her way to the water.
[1:02:58] Hallelujah.
[1:03:00] How many of you when you begin to you
[1:03:02] made a decision in your life, you're
[1:03:03] going to make your way to the water.
[1:03:04] You're going to make your way to the
[1:03:06] place where God said repent and be
[1:03:08] baptized. So, I'm going to do it. I
[1:03:09] don't know what it'll do, but I'm going
[1:03:10] to do it.
[1:03:12] She was making her way to the water. As
[1:03:14] she made her
[1:03:16] way,
[1:03:17] hallelujah, he called to her and said,
[1:03:19] "Bring me a morsel of
[1:03:22] bread in thine
[1:03:25] hand." Well, that got her
[1:03:28] attention. See, he was asking her to do
[1:03:30] something that no reasonable person
[1:03:33] would do. Right. Yeah. Now, I I just
[1:03:36] want to bring this home to us. You young
[1:03:39] people remember this that she was asked
[1:03:42] to do something that no reasonable
[1:03:44] person would do. Yeah. And to do it, she
[1:03:49] had to be certain of God. Right. Right.
[1:03:53] She had to trust him with her life.
[1:03:57] Yeah. Oh my. See, so many people want to
[1:04:01] live for God or go with God when times
[1:04:03] are good and everything's going good and
[1:04:05] roses and the church is packed out and
[1:04:08] everything's good. It's easy to be a
[1:04:09] Christian then, but when times get lean
[1:04:11] and hard and you go through times like
[1:04:13] we went through with CO, that was tough,
[1:04:15] wasn't it? But did you give up? Come on,
[1:04:18] church. We didn't give up. We kept doing
[1:04:20] what we could do. We kept serving God
[1:04:22] the best that we could. We didn't give
[1:04:24] up. Why? Because it don't depend on the
[1:04:26] times and what's going on. There's
[1:04:28] something there was something about this
[1:04:30] woman that she knew she she could be
[1:04:31] certain of God. She knew that if he
[1:04:34] asked her to do something, he'd somehow
[1:04:36] provide and make a way. Listen, brother
[1:04:38] said she was of the same caliber as
[1:04:40] Elijah. He said it was strange that God
[1:04:42] would send a preacher to a widow's
[1:04:44] house. Yeah. Right. It don't look good.
[1:04:48] Yeah. But God sent him to a widow's
[1:04:50] house. Why did he do it that way? He
[1:04:52] sent him there because he said she was
[1:04:53] of the same caliber he was. Yeah. Right.
[1:04:57] Hallelujah. And he had he had a gift to
[1:05:00] speak. And we needed that gift. Well,
[1:05:02] look, look, we needed Elijah in our day,
[1:05:04] but we also needed somebody to hear it.
[1:05:07] As much as we needed Elijah, he needed
[1:05:09] the bride to hear it. What was it? He
[1:05:12] had a gift to speak and she had a gift
[1:05:14] to receive and to act on it, to believe
[1:05:18] it. Yeah. And she said, "As the Lord thy
[1:05:21] God liveth, I have not a cake, but a
[1:05:24] handful of meal in a barrel, and a
[1:05:27] little oil in a cru, and behold, I'm
[1:05:31] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[1:05:34] and dress it for me and my son, that we
[1:05:37] may eat it and die." Now, Brother
[1:05:41] Brandham says the meal was a type of
[1:05:43] Christ. He said every burr, he said the
[1:05:46] meal offering had to be ground in such a
[1:05:48] way that every burr, every every little
[1:05:51] piece of meal was exactly the same size.
[1:05:54] Yeah. Right. Because everything that
[1:05:56] constituted the meal had to be the same
[1:05:59] yesterday, today, and forever. And Jesus
[1:06:03] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:06:06] forever. And there's healing. If you go
[1:06:08] back to Elisha, I believe it was was
[1:06:10] with the sons of the prophet and and
[1:06:12] there was death in the pot. You remember
[1:06:13] the story? And what did he do? He threw
[1:06:15] a handful of meal in the pot. He said,
[1:06:17] "Go ahead and eat it because the pot was
[1:06:19] healed." Yeah. Oh my. There's healing in
[1:06:22] Christ. There's healing in the meal
[1:06:24] which is the word Christ. Now oil types
[1:06:27] the Holy Spirit. We know that. And then
[1:06:30] the two sticks, Brother Brandham taught
[1:06:31] us was the cross. Yeah. Right. It was
[1:06:34] self-sacrifice.
[1:06:36] So listen, Elijah didn't come with
[1:06:40] meal. He didn't come with
[1:06:44] oil. He didn't come with sticks. She
[1:06:47] already had all of that. Yeah. He just
[1:06:50] told her how to put it together. That's
[1:06:52] good. Yeah. That's good. All he did was
[1:06:55] tell her, "Make a cake with it." Listen,
[1:06:58] brother Brandham didn't come with some
[1:07:00] new offering. He didn't come with some
[1:07:01] new idea. He didn't come with some
[1:07:03] strange word. What did he tell us? He
[1:07:05] said, "This is how you put it together.
[1:07:07] This is what it means in our day. This
[1:07:09] is the word for our day." Yes, sir. She
[1:07:12] had all the ingredients. She just needed
[1:07:14] the voice. Oh, we still need the voice
[1:07:16] today to tell her how to put it
[1:07:19] together. Cuz without that voice, she
[1:07:21] was going to die that day.
[1:07:24] Oh, church. Do we realize what the
[1:07:25] message of the hour means to us? We
[1:07:27] realize what the word of God means to
[1:07:28] us. Without the voice of God in our
[1:07:30] lives, our marriages will die. Our homes
[1:07:32] will die. Our churches will die. But if
[1:07:34] we have the word of God with us and in
[1:07:36] us, we will not die, but we will live is
[1:07:39] a sustaining power in the word. Are you
[1:07:41] with me tonight? A sustaining power in
[1:07:44] the in in putting all these ingredients
[1:07:46] together. She needed that voice. And
[1:07:50] then Elijah didn't just stop there, but
[1:07:52] he gave her a promise in First Kings
[1:07:53] 17:13. Elijah said to her, "Fear not. Go
[1:07:57] and do as thou hast said, but make me
[1:07:59] thereof a little cake first. bringing
[1:08:01] unto me an aftermake for thee and for
[1:08:04] thy son for thus sayaeth the Lord God of
[1:08:07] Israel. He wanted her to know this was
[1:08:10] God speaking the barrel of meal shall
[1:08:12] not waste neither shall the cruc of oil
[1:08:15] fail until the day that the Lord sendeth
[1:08:18] rain upon the earth. I know. I want you
[1:08:21] to notice that when she went in, she
[1:08:23] probably saw the same amount of meal,
[1:08:26] right? It's good, right? Right. The same
[1:08:29] amount of oil. But she was walking by
[1:08:32] faith and not by sight. Yeah.
[1:08:37] Oh my. So, she didn't she didn't look at
[1:08:40] that and say, "Well, I can't serve God
[1:08:41] because I won't be able to make it
[1:08:42] tomorrow." Right. But she walked in
[1:08:45] there and said, "Elijah said,
[1:08:47] [Laughter]
[1:08:50] Elijah said that if I would take the
[1:08:53] meal out and pour the oil out and put
[1:08:56] the spirit in the word together, all
[1:08:58] right, that if I would serve him today,
[1:09:01] right, there would be enough there for
[1:09:03] me tomorrow." Yeah. And if I'd serve him
[1:09:05] tomorrow, there'd be enough there for
[1:09:07] the next day. Joel, how would you make
[1:09:09] it for 52 years and be married for 52
[1:09:11] years? because you just put into it
[1:09:13] today. Put the word of God and the
[1:09:15] spirit of God into the marriage today
[1:09:16] and tomorrow it'll be automatically
[1:09:18] renewed and the next day and the next
[1:09:20] week. That's how you make it. Come on
[1:09:22] church. It's a dayby-day experience. We
[1:09:24] don't worry about the things of
[1:09:25] tomorrow. Tomorrow will take care of
[1:09:27] itself. But just keep on doing what's
[1:09:29] right. Keep on doing what God keep on
[1:09:31] listening to the voice of Elijah.
[1:09:32] Putting those word that those
[1:09:34] ingredients together. Keep on coming to
[1:09:36] the house of God. And pretty soon you'll
[1:09:38] find that it'll never run out. That'll
[1:09:41] make you give you confidence, make you
[1:09:42] certain of God. When you look back down
[1:09:45] your life and you seen, God kept me
[1:09:46] through that trial and he kept me
[1:09:48] through that one. And I lost my job, but
[1:09:50] he kept me. And I lost this, but he kept
[1:09:52] me. I lost my loved ones, but he kept me
[1:09:54] anyway. Lost my health, but he kept me.
[1:09:56] Oh, come on. How many can testify with
[1:09:57] me tonight? I lost everything, but he
[1:10:00] kept me through it. And so, I know the
[1:10:02] cruise of oil never fails. I know
[1:10:04] there's always the spirit of God with
[1:10:05] me. I know there's always a barrel of
[1:10:08] meal that never gives out. Very good.
[1:10:11] Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:10:16] Notice how different the voice spoke to
[1:10:18] her than it did to
[1:10:21] Ahab. A lot of preachers don't recognize
[1:10:25] this.
[1:10:27] See, Brother Brandon told us, me, you,
[1:10:32] he said, I'm going to call you bride.
[1:10:36] And he speaks to the woman, the bride,
[1:10:39] very differently
[1:10:41] than he does to Ahab.
[1:10:44] He comes up to Ahab, points his finger
[1:10:45] in his face and said, "There won't be
[1:10:47] rain or dew till I call for it." Walks
[1:10:50] away. He comes to the woman and he
[1:10:54] says, "The barrel of meal won't waste."
[1:10:58] All right. So, the same Elijah
[1:11:01] that preached judgment to Ahab preached
[1:11:04] the promises to the bride.
[1:11:07] Just depends on what you identify with.
[1:11:10] It's hard to say what you identify as,
[1:11:12] but that's kind of dicey in this day and
[1:11:13] age.
[1:11:15] By the way, I know that Eve didn't eat
[1:11:17] an
[1:11:18] apple. It was a something to say this
[1:11:22] morning.
[1:11:25] if you don't know what happened, come to
[1:11:26] me and I'll I'll tell
[1:11:32] you. But
[1:11:35] notice the voice spoke differently to
[1:11:37] her than it did to
[1:11:40] Ahab. I think of the story that I can't
[1:11:43] remember who told him, maybe brother
[1:11:44] Billy Paul, but the man come out and
[1:11:45] said, "That man in that book called me a
[1:11:48] buzzard." Yeah.
[1:11:50] You know, that's funny because that man
[1:11:52] in that book called me an eagle.
[1:11:55] Just depends on what you I choose to
[1:11:57] identify as a part of the bride. And so
[1:11:59] the word to the bride is the promises of
[1:12:02] God. Yes.
[1:12:04] His promises are yay and amen. There's
[1:12:06] no negativity in it. He was wounded for
[1:12:08] our transgression, bruised for our
[1:12:10] iniquity, chastisement of our peace upon
[1:12:12] him. With his stripes, we were healed.
[1:12:14] Everything's in past tense. There's no
[1:12:16] negative at all in Christianity. It's
[1:12:18] all, someone say all. It's all positive,
[1:12:21] done, paid for. It's finished. He said
[1:12:23] again, he said, "Today, when we believe
[1:12:24] God with all our heart and accept his
[1:12:26] son, the Lord Jesus, and God recognizes
[1:12:28] that faith is true in him, then he sends
[1:12:30] back down the Holy Spirit of promise and
[1:12:32] seals us until the day of our
[1:12:33] redemption." He said, "My, that takes
[1:12:35] all the scare out of all of it. There's
[1:12:37] no negative thoughts at all in
[1:12:39] Christianity. Everything is past tense.
[1:12:41] It's already finished." Can we believe
[1:12:43] that today, church? The the the two
[1:12:45] sticks have already been provided. The
[1:12:47] meal has already been provided. The oil
[1:12:49] has already provided. We just needed a
[1:12:51] message to tell us how to put it
[1:12:52] together.
[1:12:56] Hallelujah. So Elijah come down to the
[1:13:00] widow woman and she he said, "Here's how
[1:13:01] to have church."
[1:13:04] I thought I'd get more amens than that.
[1:13:07] That's what he did. Here's how to have
[1:13:09] church. Put the oil and the and the and
[1:13:13] the meal together, the word and the
[1:13:14] spirit.
[1:13:16] and cook that on the cross.
[1:13:21] Still works today.
[1:13:24] Still works today. You want to have a
[1:13:25] good You want to have a good service,
[1:13:27] you take the oil and you take the meal
[1:13:29] and then you sacrifice yourself and let
[1:13:32] yourself go and surrender yourself to
[1:13:34] God. And what happens? He already paid
[1:13:36] the price on the cross. What happens? It
[1:13:38] begins to produce a sweet aroma to God.
[1:13:41] We begin to see God move among us. Oh,
[1:13:44] that's what we need, isn't it? We need
[1:13:45] that rain. We need that presence of God.
[1:13:48] See, you got to be certain. You got to
[1:13:50] be certain this message was for you. She
[1:13:53] had to be certain that Elijah, who spoke
[1:13:55] across the the gate, the one who spoke,
[1:13:57] she could say, "Oh, he's an old crank.
[1:13:58] He's just a just an old cult leader,
[1:14:00] just a man. What does he know?" But he
[1:14:03] spoke with a voice of authority. And it
[1:14:04] was something in her to receive it. You
[1:14:07] got to be certain that it's for you.
[1:14:09] Salvation is for you. Are you with me
[1:14:12] now? He died on the cross for you.
[1:14:15] healing is for you. Yeah. He said, "I'm
[1:14:18] so happy to know this one thing,
[1:14:19] friends, that Christ has no negative,
[1:14:20] nothing to it. Christianity has no
[1:14:22] negative, nothing to it. It's everything
[1:14:24] absolutely positive. A man that becomes
[1:14:26] a child of God has a positive hold on
[1:14:28] Calvary. And Calvary has a positive hold
[1:14:30] on him with the assurance by almighty
[1:14:33] God, by an oath to himself that he will
[1:14:35] raise him up in the last day and take
[1:14:37] him to glory. There's no if or or
[1:14:39] nothing. It's something that's
[1:14:40] positive." Yes. He said, "Now you can be
[1:14:43] mentally worked up or emotionally worked
[1:14:44] up and just imagine your faith." He
[1:14:47] said, "But when your spirit bears record
[1:14:48] with his spirit and your life compares
[1:14:50] with God's Bible, you got a pretty good
[1:14:52] conception. It's all as it peace." He
[1:14:55] said, "That's right." He said, "But if
[1:14:56] it don't compare with that, then you
[1:14:57] better come back again. See, if you
[1:14:59] don't love him, that's what we were
[1:15:00] talking about this morning. With all
[1:15:02] your heart, with all your soul, with
[1:15:04] your mind, if sin doesn't make you
[1:15:05] tremble at the thoughts of it, you
[1:15:07] better come back and be sure." He said,
[1:15:09] "You might have danced in the spirit.
[1:15:10] You might have spoken with tongues. You
[1:15:11] might have put your name on every church
[1:15:13] book in this city. You might have been
[1:15:14] baptized three times, forward, backward,
[1:15:16] sprinkled. He said that won't have one
[1:15:17] thing to do with it. Not one thing.
[1:15:19] You've got to be born again. Something
[1:15:20] that takes place in regeneration and you
[1:15:23] become a new creation. Old things has
[1:15:25] passed away and all things are beas has
[1:15:27] that happened to you, church. I know. I
[1:15:29] believe it has for most of us. I pray
[1:15:31] that would be everyone who comes through
[1:15:33] the doors. Old things has passed away.
[1:15:35] All things become new. You're a new look
[1:15:37] on everything. The birds sing different.
[1:15:40] your enemies you once couldn't stand.
[1:15:41] You love them.
[1:15:44] Well, we could stop there for a while.
[1:15:47] You really love them and
[1:15:49] everything's changed.
[1:15:52] Then you know you've passed
[1:15:54] from death. Very good. To
[1:15:57] life. She had to be sure. She had to be
[1:16:00] certain that this man was a messenger
[1:16:03] from God. Yeah. There can't be any doubt
[1:16:06] in your mind if you're about to make a
[1:16:07] life and death decision.
[1:16:10] Right? She had to be sure his words
[1:16:12] weren't idle
[1:16:14] words. But see, this just wasn't any
[1:16:17] prophet. This was a prophet like Samuel
[1:16:19] was a prophet, right? And the Bible says
[1:16:22] that Samuel grew and the Lord was with
[1:16:24] him and didn't, he said, did let none of
[1:16:27] his words fall to the ground. That's a
[1:16:31] prophet. Can God keep the message? If he
[1:16:34] keep Samuel's words, he can keep
[1:16:36] Elijah's words. Yeah. Huh? If he could
[1:16:39] keep if he could keep Samuel's words, he
[1:16:41] could keep Paul's words. If he could
[1:16:43] keep Paul's words, he could keep
[1:16:44] Elijah's words. See, you've got to be
[1:16:47] sure this message is right or you'll
[1:16:50] never live it. Oh my. You got to be
[1:16:53] certain of it. Yes. Now, now it's hard.
[1:16:56] And brother Brandon said the hardest
[1:16:57] thing God has ever gotten to do was to
[1:17:00] get one mortal to believe another. Yes.
[1:17:05] Now, you know that's true. True. I know
[1:17:06] a lot of us say, "Well, I wouldn't be
[1:17:07] influenced by an angel." If you thought
[1:17:09] it was a real angel, you would.
[1:17:14] Yes. Right.
[1:17:16] If you come down here on wings and and a
[1:17:20] great white robe, he come down here and
[1:17:22] just presence. You knew there wasn't a
[1:17:23] figment of an imagination. It wasn't
[1:17:25] something we projected on a screen. And
[1:17:28] he come down here started talking to
[1:17:29] you. But you know, even the devil can
[1:17:31] come as an angel of light. That's right.
[1:17:34] Right. He did that to uh to the the man
[1:17:37] in one of the reformers. He come to him
[1:17:39] and and uh he said he said he said, "I'm
[1:17:42] Christ. Worship me." And he threw an
[1:17:43] inkwell at him
[1:17:46] cuz he knew that when he comes like
[1:17:48] that, he's going to he's going to come
[1:17:50] and every eye will see him. But see, he
[1:17:53] comes, he can come as an angel of light.
[1:17:54] If you thought it was an angel, you'd
[1:17:55] believe it. But the reason you have a
[1:17:57] difficult time believing the message all
[1:17:59] of us sometimes do is because listen is
[1:18:02] because it's a man that preached it. But
[1:18:05] God only uses man. Right. Did you ever
[1:18:08] think that the no angels wrote the
[1:18:11] Bible?
[1:18:13] Right. Not one word of the scripture was
[1:18:15] written directly by an angel. That's
[1:18:17] right. Right. This isn't the Book of
[1:18:19] Mormon.
[1:18:22] Right. The Book of Mormon. They say, I I
[1:18:25] believe that's what they're they say is
[1:18:26] that the Book of Mormon, Jared, you
[1:18:28] you'd probably know the Book of Mormon
[1:18:30] was was written by angels and
[1:18:33] disappeared, you know, silver plates. I
[1:18:35] don't mean to mock them or anything, but
[1:18:36] that's not what we believe. Right.
[1:18:39] Right. We believe that God in sunundry
[1:18:41] times and in diverse manners spake to
[1:18:43] the fathers through the prophets. And
[1:18:45] what did he do? He actually he actually
[1:18:48] used men. Every word of it was written
[1:18:52] by a regular man. Yeah,
[1:18:56] good. And Moses, you know, people look
[1:18:58] at that and say, "Well, there's no way
[1:18:59] Moses could have been there." He didn't
[1:19:00] have to be. He was a prophet. All right.
[1:19:03] But Moses sat there. Moses sat there and
[1:19:05] started writing what Abraham
[1:19:07] did. Come on, church.
[1:19:10] I'm going to be brother Danny Semon
[1:19:12] before I'm done with I'm going to preach
[1:19:13] out of the Old Testament, you know. But,
[1:19:15] you know, that's it's true. You You
[1:19:18] know, it was written by men. It's hard
[1:19:20] to believe men. But now it's in book
[1:19:23] form. We say, "Well, that's the Bible."
[1:19:25] But what about a prophet today? Could
[1:19:26] you believe if God sent a prophet? You'd
[1:19:28] believe if he sent an angel, would you
[1:19:30] believe a prophet who was a vindicated
[1:19:32] prophet? We go a little bit further.
[1:19:34] Could you believe yourself? Yeah. Right.
[1:19:38] You know what you've done. It's easy to
[1:19:40] take a prophet and say, "Well, he was a
[1:19:42] good man and he was holy and God kept
[1:19:44] him and and all of that." But but
[1:19:46] there's only one holy and that's God.
[1:19:48] But you can say, "Well, he's he's all of
[1:19:50] these things. He was a prophet. God kept
[1:19:52] him." But what about you? Could you
[1:19:54] believe if you spoke the word that it
[1:19:57] would come to pass? That's what he's
[1:19:59] waiting on. Waiting on you to believe
[1:20:01] it. Amen. God speaks through man. But
[1:20:03] the brother said, "God only uses man to
[1:20:05] work with. He don't use organizations.
[1:20:07] He don't use machinery. He could have
[1:20:08] done it, but he chose a man. He could
[1:20:10] choose the stars, the wind, or anything
[1:20:12] to preach the gospel, but he chose man.
[1:20:14] He does not change himself. He's always
[1:20:17] the same. See, he will speak through the
[1:20:20] bride. I won't hold you much longer, but
[1:20:22] listen. He will speak through the bride.
[1:20:24] The Bible says in Jeremiah 33:10, "Thus
[1:20:27] sayeth the Lord again, there shall be
[1:20:28] heard in this place, which you shall
[1:20:30] which you say shall be desolate without
[1:20:32] man and without beast, even in the
[1:20:34] cities of Judah and in the streets of
[1:20:35] Jerusalem that are desolate without man,
[1:20:37] without inhabitant, without beast." He
[1:20:38] said, "The voice of joy and the voice of
[1:20:41] gladness, the voice of the bridegroom,
[1:20:43] sir, and the voice of the bride, the
[1:20:46] voice of them. I want to be one of
[1:20:48] them."
[1:20:49] How many want to be one of them tonight?
[1:20:51] I believe you are one of them. He said,
[1:20:52] "The voice of them that shall say," he
[1:20:55] said, "How many is them?" Well, it might
[1:20:56] be 20. It might be 50, might be a
[1:20:58] hundred, but it's them that say, "Praise
[1:21:00] the Lord of hosts, for the Lord is good,
[1:21:02] for his mercy endureth forever, and of
[1:21:05] them that shall bring the sacrifice of
[1:21:07] praise into the house of the Lord. I
[1:21:09] will cause to return the captivity of
[1:21:10] the land as it the first Lord." Be
[1:21:12] certain he's God, and he will speak
[1:21:15] through you, the voice of the bride. He
[1:21:18] wants to hear your voice lifted in
[1:21:19] praise.
[1:21:21] Amen. Be certain he's God. The bride,
[1:21:25] listen, we've been taught will be the
[1:21:27] final voice under her messenger will be
[1:21:29] the final voice to the final age.
[1:21:31] Brother Brandon said, "What's she going
[1:21:32] to do?" Now, speaking of this gentile
[1:21:34] woman who was a type of the bride, the
[1:21:36] widow of Zarapath, what's she going to
[1:21:38] do? See if she's obedient to the word.
[1:21:42] Amen. She turns and starts not knowing
[1:21:45] why she's doing it.
[1:21:47] turned and started into the house. Then
[1:21:49] she heard that voice again, that
[1:21:50] glorious word come from his mouth. Thus
[1:21:52] sayeth the Lord, she knew who it was.
[1:21:55] Then the barrel will not be empty,
[1:21:58] neither shall the cruci until the day
[1:22:00] the Lord God sends reign on the earth.
[1:22:02] Why? She was willing to put God first.
[1:22:05] She was sure that God would do
[1:22:07] something. She held on. Many times
[1:22:11] trouble strikes our homes. It's blessing
[1:22:14] in disguisement.
[1:22:16] Some people might say, "Well, you're
[1:22:17] sick." It's because you're not right
[1:22:19] with God. That doesn't mean that. Job
[1:22:21] was right with God and he was sick. But
[1:22:24] it's God testing you, putting you to a
[1:22:26] test to see what you'll do. Maybe let
[1:22:28] the doctor say that for a purpose to see
[1:22:30] what you would do. He said, "We're near
[1:22:32] the coming of the Lord. God is coming
[1:22:33] for a church." He never asked in
[1:22:35] question. Will I have a church? Will I
[1:22:37] have righteousness? But here was the
[1:22:39] question Jesus asked. Will I find faith
[1:22:41] when I come? He said, "God is putting
[1:22:43] you to a test, maybe to try your faith
[1:22:45] and all of her trouble and death at the
[1:22:47] door turned."
[1:22:52] Listen, you could be one, thus saith the
[1:22:54] Lord. Yeah, there you go. From victory.
[1:22:57] All right.
[1:23:01] You You realize why we try to make sure
[1:23:03] every service matters. Yeah. They say
[1:23:06] all lives matter. Every service matters.
[1:23:08] Yeah, we want the very best, the best
[1:23:11] atmosphere that we want people to be
[1:23:13] there. We want we don't do that cuz we
[1:23:14] want to be hard on people, but we
[1:23:16] believe God can do anything in any
[1:23:18] service that almighty God can create
[1:23:20] such an atmosphere that'll birth
[1:23:22] children into the kingdom of God. And I
[1:23:24] don't know about you, but I got people I
[1:23:25] love that I'm praying for. I need to be
[1:23:27] I was we were at that memorial service.
[1:23:29] There's lots of folks there. Some of
[1:23:30] them listen to these services. Oh, that
[1:23:32] God would speak by the by the voice of
[1:23:35] the message of the hour and speak and
[1:23:37] vanish all the doubt. She was one. Thus
[1:23:39] sayaith the Lord. Very good. Come on.
[1:23:42] Glory to God. Away from turning. Yes,
[1:23:45] sir. Hallelujah. That's good. Said,
[1:23:47] "Thus say the Lord." And she turned. She
[1:23:50] and her son and Elijah eat many days
[1:23:54] from the barrel and it never did waste.
[1:23:56] Neither did the cruc because she was
[1:23:58] certain of God. There you go. All our
[1:24:03] doubt can vanish when we hear thus
[1:24:06] sayeth the Lord and recognize it's thus
[1:24:09] sayith the Lord. Maybe he won't say it
[1:24:10] in that way, but we know it's a word
[1:24:12] from God.
[1:24:16] Ahab didn't recognize it. He wasn't of
[1:24:18] that caliber, but she was.
[1:24:22] Hallelujah. See, when our hearts are
[1:24:25] turned,
[1:24:26] that was what happened to her. Her heart
[1:24:29] was turned. She said, she said, "I'm
[1:24:31] just going to cook my last meal and
[1:24:34] die." Can you imagine how depressed she
[1:24:35] must have been?
[1:24:39] Can you imagine how low she must have
[1:24:41] felt?
[1:24:43] She said, "I'm going to cook my last
[1:24:44] meal. This is it." I know you've heard
[1:24:48] this story. You sitting there saying,
[1:24:49] "Brother Ben, I've heard this preached
[1:24:50] many times." Yeah. But God put it on my
[1:24:52] heart for a reason. He had to.
[1:24:56] Yeah. She said, "This is it.
[1:24:59] This is all I
[1:25:00] got. Imagine how how hard and how dark
[1:25:03] that time must have
[1:25:05] been. She probably didn't sleep much.
[1:25:08] Got up early and went to the gate, not
[1:25:10] knowing she was one. Thus sayeth the
[1:25:13] Lord.
[1:25:17] Oh, church. You don't know what it is
[1:25:19] when you hear the voice of God. Yeah.
[1:25:22] Come on now. When you hear God speaking,
[1:25:24] I mean, when God speaks to you, not just
[1:25:26] you hear a preacher, you hear a tape,
[1:25:28] you hear, but when you hear God speak to
[1:25:30] you and you recognize that that the
[1:25:32] words on that tape, that wasn't just a
[1:25:33] man that said that, but that was God
[1:25:34] speaking through a man. That wasn't just
[1:25:36] a man that spoke in the pulpit. That was
[1:25:38] God speaking through a man. When you
[1:25:40] recognize it that it's the word of God,
[1:25:42] you're one thus sayith the thus sayith
[1:25:44] the Lord away from healing. One thus
[1:25:46] sayeth the Lord away from salvation of
[1:25:48] your kids. One thus sayeth the Lord away
[1:25:50] from being certain. Amen.
[1:25:54] Being certain that God is your healer.
[1:25:56] Being certain that your children will be
[1:25:57] saved. Being certain of your
[1:25:58] resurrection.
[1:26:00] I may go by way of the grave, but I'm
[1:26:03] certain. Hallelujah. These these bones
[1:26:06] Job was so certain. He said, "Though the
[1:26:08] skin worms destroy my body, yet in my
[1:26:11] flesh I will see God." Why? He was
[1:26:13] certain of God. And you have to be
[1:26:15] certain of that. Musicians, go ahead and
[1:26:17] come. Jesus was certain that the
[1:26:20] epileptic child would be
[1:26:22] healed. The disciples were passionate,
[1:26:26] but Jesus was certain.
[1:26:29] The disciples believed,
[1:26:32] but Jesus was certain.
[1:26:36] And the disciples come out there and had
[1:26:38] a Pentecostal meeting and just all and I
[1:26:40] love that, man. I I do. I think that
[1:26:42] many times that builds faith. But the
[1:26:44] devil didn't
[1:26:47] move because they were pretty
[1:26:50] sure that God could cast out
[1:26:53] epilepsy. But they didn't. They were
[1:26:55] missing something. Brother Brandon said
[1:26:56] they were missing the life. He said the
[1:26:59] devil wasn't scared of how loud you
[1:27:00] shout or how much you scream or how loud
[1:27:03] you pray. Said but the devil was scared
[1:27:05] of that
[1:27:06] life. And when Jesus walked up, he knew
[1:27:09] who he was. But the B said he believed
[1:27:11] who he was.
[1:27:12] He believed who he was. He knew he was
[1:27:14] without sin. There's a powerful
[1:27:17] revelation there, church. Brandon
[1:27:19] teaches it in perfect faith. He said
[1:27:21] Jesus knew that he was without sin. So
[1:27:24] what did he do? He walked up and and he
[1:27:26] and he he he cast the devil out of the
[1:27:30] baby. He said, "If thou cast
[1:27:33] believe, if thou
[1:27:36] cast." And I love the response of her
[1:27:39] father, the child's father. He said, "I
[1:27:43] believe. Help thou my
[1:27:46] unbelief." So, I'm not going to confess
[1:27:48] that I'm an unbeliever, but if there's
[1:27:49] any unbelief in me, take it out of me,
[1:27:52] Lord. I confess that I'm a believer, but
[1:27:55] where there's unbelief in me, remove it
[1:27:57] from the
[1:27:58] equation. And the disciples come to
[1:28:01] Jesus. They said, "Why couldn't we cast
[1:28:02] him out?" And he said, "Because this
[1:28:04] kind only comes out by the cross."
[1:28:08] self-denial, prayer and
[1:28:11] fasting, right? What was he saying? It
[1:28:14] was a life that was lived. Listen to me.
[1:28:17] I realize that we're not perfect. We're
[1:28:18] not sinless, but we've been made
[1:28:21] sinless. We've been made by the blood of
[1:28:23] God. If we can have confidence in the
[1:28:25] blood, the way he was confident in in in
[1:28:28] his birth and in his life and in what
[1:28:30] God made him. If we can have that kind
[1:28:31] of confidence in the blood, we know that
[1:28:33] all our sins are under the blood and we
[1:28:35] can speak to our mountain. He said, "If
[1:28:38] you really believe it, it'll begin to
[1:28:39] move. It may move one pebble at a time,
[1:28:42] but it'll move if thou can't believe."
[1:28:45] And his response was, "Lord, I believe.
[1:28:48] Help thou my unbelief." How many could
[1:28:50] say that with me tonight? Lord, I
[1:28:52] believe. I'm certain that you're God.

[1:35:31] be freedom in the house of God, or they
[1:35:33] can worship with all of their heart. I
