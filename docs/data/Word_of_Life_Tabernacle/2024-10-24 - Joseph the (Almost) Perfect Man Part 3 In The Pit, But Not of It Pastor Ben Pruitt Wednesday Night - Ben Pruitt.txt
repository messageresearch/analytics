those that need help we pray in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah so good to be here tonight uh turn with me if you would to Genesis chapter 37 Genesis 37:19 and uh we'll go right into the word tonight good to see each and every one of you on a Wednesday night good see brother Jeremy back from California I guess he survived the Left Coast so uh back with us for tonight at least so good to have you back brother Jeremy Genesis 37:19 it's hard on a redneck to be out of their place but uh brother Jeremy's a world traveler so he's used to it let's read they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh come come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil Beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated want to speak to you on Joseph the the almost perfect man and we know that he was not perfect because only Christ was perfect and yet he did a lot of things right and he was a type his life was a type of Christ brother Peter they were having some trouble with the stream if they haven't got that worked out you might want to check on that maybe the internet you bear with us if you're watching tonight Joseph Dreamed a Dream the Bible tells us and he told it to his Brethren now we know that Joseph's dreams were god-given they were true they they were right but they were not complete and I think when we begin to look at what God shows us we realize that God don't even tell His prophets everything he just tells them what he wants them to know and brother brandom tells us that over and over again he just tells them what he wants them to know and so Joseph did not see the intermediary period between uh where he was at at the moment and where he would be in the future all he could see is the future he could see as he said unto them in verse six he said I pray you hear this dream which I have dreamed he said for behold we were binding sheep in the field and oh my sheath arose and also stood upright and behold your sheath stood round about and made obedience to my sheath or bowed down to my sheath and his Brethren said to him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us and you know if we had uh if you had been his brothers you might have had the same kind of response because here's this young man this guy that that had no business uh uh you know reigning over anybody and he's telling them about a dream but the dream wasn't of the present the dream was of the future it was telling of a future event and Joseph had to reach a place of maturity in his life that he could be in a place where where they would bow down to him and yet he wouldn't abuse that power that they gave him and so at the moment moment he was they were not going to bow down to him and so they hated him because of his dreams he said they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and verse n he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his Brethren I want you to notice every time he dreams a dream he tells the dream he dreamed a dream and he told the dream he said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou Hast dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth so he's saying uh not just that the Brethren got tired of it but his father got tired of it and he said you you just need to wait a minute boy you're not ready for this right and his Brethren envied him but his father observed the saying so even though his father rebuked him his father realized there was something Supernatural about this young man in his dreams but his Brethren envied him and so we we we should say you know if you if you're a spiritual person Joseph Dream your dreams and I think all of us have a dream and a vision and a goal of Life Something That We're pressing towards something that we're looking don't you have something in your life that you see yourself in you see I hope we all see ourselves in heaven one day we see ourselves uh even on the earth we see ourselves more mature more God more like Christ we see the church in a in a elevated place an Ephesian Church a place that God can move and so we want to dream our dreams we want to have dreams but be careful who you tell your dreams to right because we've already established in in another sermon previous sermon that immaturity in Joseph led him to say things maybe he wouldn't have said later in the same way where where Jesus held back and remember he said it's not my time verse two says the tongue of the wise useth knowledge a right so in other words to have a dream to be a person that uh is spiritual or to be a person who is gifted and using that in the right way to be a person who knows something but knowing how to use that knowledge and and so he said the tongue of the wise useth knowledge a right but the mouth of fools porth out foolishness right so there's two different people maybe the difference between the fool and the wise many times is just maturity it's just growing up it's just getting older it's just learning some things it's just going through a pit it's just going through a prison it's just going through those things for you reach a place where you can speak in the right way now if we we've done the talking and I know many times we do and if I get in trouble most of the time it's from talking too much and yet you know I I will get in trouble from time to time because it's sort of my job to talk but yet at the same time it's you get in trouble if you talk too much and and sometimes we do that and and someone gets hurt I want to say this especially to you younger people and you children and young people someone gets hurt there's a way to fix that apologize but she said well I wasn't wrong about this certain thing we'll apologize anyway it's a good learning experience if nothing else you learn how to say I'm sorry right learn from the experience and in in in Luke 171 uh he Jesus deals with how we should deal with offenses and how we should forgive those who have offended so in Luke 171 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offenses will come so in other words people will say and do things that offend God's children that will happen but woe unto him through whom they come right he says it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea that he should offend one of these little ones now we're not talking about the modern victim culture where everybody's offended by every little thing that you say we're talking about something real something that shouldn't have been said and was said to one of these little ones now and then we look at the one that said it obviously they shouldn't have said it and what's the way to to stop that apologize and quit talking right quit talking about it a and then move on to something else because you will fall again you will mess up again you will speak again and it'll be something that's not exactly right well just apologize get past it and move on to the next thing and learn from the experience yes sir right right but then Jesus deals with if we're the one who is offended because we don't want to stop with verse two we want to go on because he said take heed to yourselves If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him if he repent forgive him right but you say well what if he or she doesn't change that's not your problem right if we've if we if we've brought it to their attention and they won't repent then we forgive if they repent we forgive if they say I'm sorry we forgive but see the reason we're afraid to the reason we're afraid to give forgiveness many times because we think if we give forgiveness somehow that lets them off the hook when it doesn't do that at all it lets us off the hook see whether they change or not it's not our problem look down to verse four if he trespass against thee seven times in a day right and seven times in a day that's a lot right so that's a person that called you on the phone said something they shouldn't have said and and and feelings were hurt and then they apologized then they did it again six more times in the same day right now we get tired of that he said saying I Repent so he just says I'm sorry Thou shalt forgive him right now why would we forgive him because if we don't forgive we'll backside that's right because God won't hear our prayer cuz brother brandham teaches us you find the quote faith is based on forgiveness and brother brandham says this I've read it many times and then we'll move on but he said you say well if I can just get even with her if I can get even with him no matter what they done choose life choose life for Jesus said if from your heart you don't forgive every person their transgression neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one op in your heart against any person sinner or Saint you're in danger of Hellfire why because you you backslide in your spirit because you because you hold bitterness and the dove will not stay in that bitter place right so Joseph says some things that his his brothers won't let go of right they won't they won't get over it and they end up doing something terrible because of it and yet it was all in the plan of God that it would be done so Joseph's dreams spoke of a singular place and time in his life when his Brethren would come to him and bow down and they were absolutely true but it wasn't all the story right the the two dreams didn't say anything about the pit Piper's house the prison and and Joseph himself was what brother random called The Prince of prosperity the prince of prosperity and that's what his Dreams made him and so he's telling his brothers I'm the Prince of prosperity and they put him in a pit and said okay you be the prince of prosperity from there but guess what he was oh that's the great thing because it doesn't change you when you're in the pit it doesn't change oh church if we can only grab a hold of this Revelation tonight when we're in the pit that doesn't change who we are when you get a little depressed or you get anxious or or you feel like that you haven't felt the presence of God in a long time and you feel like things just aren't going your way or you lose your job or your kids are going astray and you wonder how can I even show my face in church again remember you are not defined by the pit that you're in but the dream is still true that your predestination still holds your election is still real do you believe that tonight Joseph was the prince of prosperity brother BR said Joseph saw it by his own life now now he's telling us that Joseph was watching his own life which ought to be something we all do and seeing Christ out of his own life so it gave him a forn knowledge of Christ of the Messiah coming because his own life and what he had been through now he said he seen that he was born A peculiar boy that he was a sear there was something about him he could see Visions he couldn't understand it even went and told his mother and father when they tried to correct him when he seen the she was all bowing to his he couldn't understand it but then next thing he found out he was betrayed by his Brethren he said what am I portraying here that's a good question to ask what am I portraying here what is and sometimes we need to look at the big picture what is God trying to show in my life oh my so he had enough about him that he was able to look at it and say what am I portraying here this 17-year-old boy that gets throned in the pit what am I portraying here what is this for knowledge that I'm receiving he watched his own life and any man can watch your own life and about tell what you are if you just check up on yourself whether you're really a Christian or not watch the things you do what you say your Associates and so forth you'll find out whether you really got anything there or not he said he's seen his life as it begin to move now let's just all go uh up and and and get uh heavenly vision for just a moment and take a look at our own lives and we begin to look at our lives and we see the trials that we've been through and the troubles and the struggles and we can do one or two things about that we can blame people we can look around around us and say well that man caused me to do that or that woman caused me to do that or that person caused that in my life or we can raise above that and say what is God trying to show through my life what is he trying to portray out of my life so he said any you can watch your own life he's seen his life as it begin to move and the next thing you know they found he was thrown into a hole deceived by his brother supposed to being killed and thrown into a hole and he was taken up again Joseph foresaw that he saw himself in the prison he saw himself in the dungeon now what's he foreseeing he didn't know he was going to the prison he didn't know he was going to the dungeon but he's foreseeing God's showing something in my life that's going to happen in the Life of Christ in the life of the Messiah he foresaw that his life was speaking of a Christ that would come and you and I are speaking oh my Our Lives speak of a Christ that has come what is it we're we're we're going back as he looked forward to Christ we're we're looking back to Christ and seeing the Our Lives mirror The Life of Christ so he saw himself in the dungeon now he saw God was with him whatever he did oh I love that that builds confidence right there because if you never were in the pit you'd never know if God was with you in the pit or not right if you never struggled to get a prayer through it seemed like Heavens were brass you wouldn't know if God was with you when when when Heavens felt like brass but because he was with you before you know he'll be with you again so you're watching your own life and you're seeing that because I know God was with me God was with me in the trial he was with me in my troubles he was with me when I didn't have a job he was with me when I didn't have any money he was with me when I struggled he was with me you can even look back before you become a Christian and say God protected me God kept me what was going on in your life God was with me if he could keep me then he'll keep me today and whatever the devil has start going to throw at me in the future I know he's already kept me through these things he'll keep me through that amen amen he said everywhere Joseph was there was Prosperity that included the pit think about it what Prosperity could you find in a pit right think about it for a minute what are you going to find the prosperous about a pit what is it well it's coming out of the pit and even that looked like it got worse because he went into slavery but God was bringing him to Egypt the only way he would ever go to Egypt was to be carried there as a slave so God brought him out of the pit and that was it prosperity in the pit now look there was Prosperity he was the prince of prosperity and him for shadowing Christ wherever Christ is there is prosperity oh I love that say brother Ben are you prosperous well according to the word I am right I may not have a lot of money but I'm prosperous according to the word you may not have a lot of things but you're prosperous according to the word things may not work out the way you think they should but you're prosperous according to the word because wherever Christ is there's prosperity and he lives in my heart and so I can say I'm a prosperous man today wherever I'm at it doesn't matter what where circumstances put me the desert will Bloom like a rose wherever I am he said the desert shall Blossom as a rose the rough places will be made smooth it shall bring forth in the abundance for he is the prince of prosperity wherever he is oh my oh it's just we need to change our view and look at it from a different view a different angle and see that he is the prince of prosperity no matter what we're going through now we we know that Reuben saved Joseph's life Genesis 37:22 Reuben said unto them that his brothers shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness lay no hand upon him that we might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again again it's God saving his life through Reuben one of his brothers and Ruben actually attempts to go get but then when he don't find him he participates in the cover up later and I don't have time to get into it tonight but you can study Reuben and you'll find a time when Moses spoke over about letting bitterness get to you you talk about hatred getting to you they actually sat down a and ate dinner instead of instead of trying to reconcile the issue and fix the issue they sat down and ate and they actually and they actually waited on a company of ishmaelites to come from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said to his Brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood see they were always thinking about the money right so they said well how can we profit in this if we slay our brother and conceal his blood and we know even brother brandom ties that all the way down into uh after the WRA capure when he talks about the Jews making a covenant for money and so Judah said what prophet is it if we say our brother and conceal this Blood verse 27 come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content they said okay we won't kill him we'll sell him into slavery and we'll actually benefit from it verse 28 then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt wonder what Joseph was thinking about in the pit it'd be easy while you're in a pit that your brothers who should love you and who the dream says are going to bow to you have put you there it'd be easy to lose faith in your dream it would be easy to lose confidence in what God has said about you while you're in the pit it's hard to keep your your your your focus your narrative it's hard to you know it's like being a ship in a storm it's hard to keep your direction it's hard it's hard to make sure that you keep going in the right direction because otherwise the the the ship will go all kinds of different directions and all you're just so concerned about staying alive that you're not even looking what direction you're going how many ships are blown off course so it would be easy to lose Faith while you're in a pit a muddy dirty pit with nothing to eat and your brothers are up there around the rim you can hear them talking about you it's easy to lose faith when you're going through that and how would it happen and question how it would happen how are they ever going to bow to me when they just sold me into slavery but it's in the p that you find out or someone is a genuine believer you don't find that in the Revival meeting come on church because somebody might shout and another person shout one of them be a genuine Christian and the other one be a devil one might speak in tongues another one speak in tongues one be genuine and another one be a devil but when you get in the pit when you get them in life when you get them in a place where it seems like everything's going against them that's when you find out whether they're Christians or not whether they're Believers or not whether there's something there or not and I'll say our reactions if we'll watch our lives our reaction to our life when we're in the pit says a lot about us yeah right what do we do do we do we give up on the word do we start doing things that aren't right do we start skipping Church do we start saying well I'm not really sure if I believe the message do we start not listening to tapes do we start losing confidence in our pastor do we start when we're in the pit it tells a lot about us right and I'm not saying it's not difficult but there's got to be something there to hold you I'm sure Joseph wanted to give up on his dream he may have wanted to just be like anybody else they might as well kill me but there was something in him that wouldn't let him do it and there's something I believe in every one of you here tonight that won't let you give up on being a Christian that won't let you give up on being a Believer remember said Joseph was a prophet he couldn't help because he could interpret dreams he couldn't help because he saw Visions watch how true he was no matter if it cost him his fellowship with his brothers he was true because he believed those dreams he believed that the dream that he had that they would all bow to him the Sheep would and it come to pass because he believed it he was a genuine believer he was in the pit but not of the pit he was in the pit but the pit didn't Define who he was he said brother Ben this isn't very important it's very important because everyone of us at some point in our life we're going to find ourselves in a low place we're going to find Ourselves cast there by other people offended hurt what do we do see the believer is never a victim of circumstances and the reason for that is because of the sovereignty of God right God knows what he's doing church and that's why David can look out and when a man's coming throwing rocks at him and they said he said I'll cut his head off and David said no maybe the Lord told him to do it because he recognized that everything he was going through it had to speak a something it had to had to be foreshadowing something and everything we're going through is speaking of something it's foreshadowing something it's building a character or something in our lives we are not victims we're Overcomers and because Joseph was an overcomer he come out of the pit he said well if if he'd have been a real if he' had been a real prophet he wouldn't have been in the pit no what made him a real prophet and a real believer was the fact he come out of the pit not that he never went in one but that he come out of the pit not that you never did anything wrong not that you ever made never made a mistake not that you never were a sinner but you come out of that condition and you moved on with God Matthew 6:24 says no man can serve two masters for either he'll hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and man or mankind men's ideas men's things a human ability therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life now that thought we know in the original is anxious thought it's not that you shouldn't have a thought about what you're going to eat tomorrow because you need a plan for that but take no thought is don't worry right can we think about it like that that's way what it is in the original don't worry for your life what you shall eat what you shall drink don't worry about your body what you shall put on your clothes is not the life more than meat and the body than rment so now watch what he says therefore now no man can serve two masters because you can't serve two masters you can't serve worry and a providential God right you can't serve worry come on Church the brandom taught us that worry is sin I know we all do it from time to time but it's still not right it's one of those things where Paul said I got to keep under my body and bring it in subjection he wasn't just talking about lust of the Flesh and things like that he was talking about worry he was talking about anxiety he was talking about the things that we go through and and are as human beings he said I'm not going to let myself give over to those things so he said therefore because you can't serve two masters take no thought don't worry he gives the examples of the birds and the lies and talks about how that God feeds them and clothes them and he says therefore therefore take no thought therefore don't worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith All Shall we be clothed for after all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you it doesn't say they might be it said they would be why because you're you're in the pit but you're still Joseph you're in the pit but you're still a Believer you're in the pit but you still have a dream are you with me now I thought I us a little bit much for a Wednesday night and we're all tired but can you see what I'm trying to tell you tonight he said don't worry worry about tomorrow because tomorrow will take care of itself sufficient to the day is the evil thereof see we are not here by chance see we're not victims because we're not here by chance we're all planted and we serve a purpose see when we go out here if you go out in uh in in the fall of the year and you see a great crop of wheat or rice or cotton or whatever it is that they grow in this area if we go out and look at that crop you know when when you go out there you you see a crop of Wheat and you don't look at that and say well it's surprising to see a crop of wheat out here in the middle of nowhere but what do you assume you assume somebody planted it right I remember when we were young you know my my grandpa only had a certain amount of tools to his disposal and and he just farmed a couple hundred acres and and his crops didn't look all too good we didn't have irrigation we depended on the rain and and so it just didn't look that great and I remember going down in there and he'd grow Milo in one field because it was always too wet in the spring to grow anything else in and he would grow beans in another field and couldn't really grow any cash crops because of the nature of the soil but it was it wasn't very good but I remember going down by syon Missouri and seeing the long rows of of cotton you know that's not normal that's not natural it didn't just happen that all this Cotton's in a row right it didn't just happen that all the beans are just lined up just perfect and there's not a weed in the field what is that that's lots of effort right those crops that you see didn't come from Just Just Happening they were planted right a farmer planted them a farmer is not surprised by a good crop why because he planted it he fertilized it he watered it right he's controlling the atmospheres of it why he's Pro he's providentially he placing it and what is it the same thing is true of the Christian God is not surprised when you become a he wasn't surprised when you come to him why he planted you in him sir are you with me now I've told it before but it just fits here uh Ronald Reagan told a story about a farmer and a preacher and the farmer was was taking the preacher out on his fields and he was showing him he said here's the beans and here's the Orchards and here's all the the good things that that's happened and every time he does he goes by a field of beans and the preacher says well thanks be to God he goes by a field and he says well praise the Lord and he goes by the beans he says well oh isn't God good isn't he great and the farmer after a while he just had to say it he said but said preacher you should have seen it when the Lord had it to himself see somebody had to plan it h are you with me now I know that's humorous but somebody had to plan it see David says it this way blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord in his law do he meditate day and night and he shall be now watch like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper how does he get in this condition he didn't it wasn't an accident that he was by the river of water he didn't even grow there naturally he was planted there are you with me now he was planted brother brandom deals with this he said what predestinated amen he said that thought of God before the foundation of the world placed him there listen to me church we got to believe in a providential god do you realize every person sitting here tonight was meant to be here you were placed here by the providential thought of God you're not a victim being here you're not a you're you're not an accident being here you're not it not just something you decided to do because you had nothing better to do but God meant for you to be here why he planted you and be in his mind before the foundation of the world that thought of God planted him there why is Allan price Allan price why is Isaac Andrews Isaac Andrews why it's Britney PR Britney PR because God planted you there in his mind before the foundation of the world he planted you are you with me now not stuck out not by chance sir but was planted predestinated to the rivers of water the farmer purposely put you by the rivers oh my look what it says about you about that that was planted but that that person that woman that was planted his root shall not wither oh Hallelujah though he dies I'll raise him up again at the last day he is predestinated to be there not just by chance he was predestined to catch that word when it was swed and she'll be right there when it sticks she's there he's planted not just stuck down he's actually planted that's right he said a lot different sticking a stick in the ground than planting something it's different the seed was planted it found its own root holes oh my it was planted by God it's rooted in God God intended for it to be there he said you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance someone say nothing nothing is the pit included in nothing now that's a question you got to ask yourself and decide am I going to feel sorry for myself or am I going to come out of the pit right am I going to spend the rest of my life worrying about what this one did or what that one did or am I going to be a prince of prosperity and come out of the pit are you with me now I believe I can come out why did he come out brother B already told us he believed he could he believed the dream was still true he believed that God still loved him what are we going to do about the situations in our life are we just going to bow down to it and say well it's just got to be this way and and it's just going to happen and and well just I tried to serve God and it just didn't work out for me I tried to do what the Bible says with my family but it just didn't work out for me I tried to live for God and I I I dotted every eye and crossed every tee and it just didn't work out for me no you're not looking at it right if you've done what what what God required then you hold on to the promise say God you planted me here it will work out for me all I got to do is hold on to the word of God it will work out cuz you were planted are you with me now it takes away all the fear and scare it takes away preachers being able to put you in or out right a preacher can't tell you this that you're you're you're you're a seat of God or you're not all the preacher can do is identify fruit preach the word but it's up to you whether you're going to whether you're going to identify with that or not whether you going to put that shoe on or not that's up to you and Joseph said I refuse to be a pit person I refuse to be spend all my life thinking I belong in the pit I'm I'm in the pit but I'm not of the pit oh I wish we'd grab a hold of that tonight I may I may be in trouble but I'm not of trouble I may be in I may be in stress but I'm not of stress I may be in I may be in difficulty but I'm not of difficulty I'm a prince of prosperity I belong in the house of God brother BR said then if you're a Son of God our daughter God you were in God all the time but he knew what bed in time that you'd be planted planted oh so now you're made a creature a Son of God manifested son or daughter of God to meet the challenge of this hour to vindicate the true and living God of this hour the message is coming forth in this time he planted you here to to be the message of the hour he planted you here to represent it to Hardy Arkansas are you wh in hell and then there's no you know you you feel sorry for yourself for a minute but then you say okay okay I'm going to make it I'm going to make it I I I'm not I don't belong in this pit so God must have some way of bringing me out of it oh my the Bible tells us that the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon those that be planted there's that word again planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing to show that the Lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him so Christ came to redeem those who were planted in the mind of God you believe that tonight if Christ he did he only come to redeem his own because to redeem means to buy back right you had to be his or he couldn't redeem you so you can't you can't just you say you know we want to blame people for making for not for us not being redeemed it it's not possible right because when God gets ready to affect redemption in your life it's going to happen no matter what anybody says and no matter what anybody does right because he came to redeem those that were planted in the mind of God Isaiah 61:1 the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings un the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord you remember that's where he stopped because the second part was to for his second coming he said and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn when Jesus said this day this scripture is fulfilled he stopped at the acceptable year of the Lord but then he says to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trees of Righteousness the planting of the Lord so when you church when you go by that field that everything's just right and every all the weeds are out what is it you you don't look at that and say well it just happened that way it's there by chance no you know somebody planted that and somebody's taken care of that and somebody's fertilized that and somebody's poured water on oh Church don't you realize brother brandom uses this term of planting and he says God will water what he plants oh hallelujah amen the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified what he planted he will keep listen to this Isaiah 27:3 you've heard brother brandom quote this many many times in the message he said I the Lord do keep it I will water it now when when when Joseph was in the pit it said there was no water in the pit but he couldn't see what God was doing God was just pouring water on his plant he just pouring water on his plant because the plant needs water so how often is he going to water it we had some some nice I forget what they're called but some nice flowers we put out in front of our house they were real nice until we left for a couple weeks and then they didn't get watered quite as often as what and W normally do and they died because they were plants that need water every day you're a plant that needs water you don't you don't do well without the presence of God but here's the good thing he promised I'll Water you you may be in the pit but I'll Water you you might be it might be a dry time but there's still water it might be no Revival anywhere but you're still you're still in Revival why he said I will water it how often church every moment oh my right now he's watering you he's pouring out his Spirit on you he he's he's affecting his presence you he said I'll Water it every moment less than he heard it I will keep it night and day he planted it he promised he would keep it and how good you take care of a thing is how well it grows you know that when you plant something years ago Mom I don't know if you remember this I planted sunflower seeds outside of our house and I planted them in kind of a bad spot because I didn't realize they need full sun so I plant them beside the house and you know half the day they were in shade but I watered them things and I took care of them things and I thought that didn't have nothing else to do you know so I I just I I can't I don't even remember how old I was but I I I wasn't doing my school work I was pouring water on them sunflower seeds and cultivating them sunflow you know what I got the great big sunflowers the great big tall ones like they have in Kansas I was so proud of that why because I took care of it I kept it every moment I gave it an undue amount of care but Christ said I'm going to give you that kind of care he said I'm going to watch you every moment I'm going to till the ground I'm going to work on you and so when you go through a trial you just know Lord I know somehow this is you working on me this is you pouring water on my life this is you helping me out of my struggle this is you bringing me to where I need to be he planted it when brother brandham uh built the Tabernacle he he quoted that scripture often because the Lord showed him that scripture I the Lord do keep it water it every moment I'll keep it de night and day and at some point at some point and it's in some times of your life you just got to ride on that you just got to trust that right you just got to say that promise is still true cuz I don't feel like it it don't it don't make sense to me but it's still true and so he tells a story about Paul Raider and how he had a dream and I heard someone quote it the other day but he tells the story about Paul Raider's dream and and how that uh Paul was out there he said his boss had told him he said or he heard the voice of his boss saying go and and cut down this tree he said it's a tree he should have been able to handle or would have been when he was younger but he said he went up there and and he cut down this tree and the tree fell and he couldn't even pick it up off the ground and he said how am I going to get this tree all the way down the mountain into that Sawmill and he's sitting there worried and discouraged and brother Brandon said he he said as he sit there he was leaning against the tree and he was weeping and he said he heard his boss speak and said Paul he said yes boss here I am but I've lost all my strength I just can't go any further I've tried to do and I've tried to obey you and do what you said do but I just can't get this thing off the ground he said I've struggled I've tried I've done every have you ever felt that way church now brother brandom takes this to preachers because it's true even as a preacher many times especially as a preacher you feel this way because you feel like you you're you're carrying all of this you're trying and you're trying and and it don't help and and you you say God what am I going to do well you just got to have confidence if the boss told you to do it you can do it but now look what he said he's sitting there weeping and he said and he said I just he said boss here I am I've lost my strength I can't go any further I've tried to obey you I've struggled I've tried I've done everything he said I just wonder if that ain't the attitude of a many good true-hearted preacher today that's long to see a church built without spot or wrinkle to see the promises of God made manifest that's all we've ever wanted to see here it's to see the promise of God because God said I'll keep it I established it I planted it I'll keep it day and night and you don't understand why when things get tough I get to feeling like Lord there must be something good around the corner there must be something good coming because when times are tough I know he will not forsake me I know he will cuz he planted this church we didn't start this church God meant for it to be here you said what's the proof of that brother Ben the proof is what we've been through the proof oh Church the proof is where we came from can't you look at your own life that way if that can give me confidence in the church look what you've been through look what you came from look what you were look what you are now it gives you confidence to say I know you planted this tree I know you planted this life I'm going to make it out of here I can't say I didn't identify with this quote so we've tussled and tried screamed and cried and preached till we was horse laid on our pillows and wept oh God why is it just when we get straightened up that end comes the death and bust up and tears up just knocks down everything we got what can we do when we see our lovely people and how they'd be scattered and gone about like that but Paul Raider he he looked at around and he said he turned to look at his boss but it wasn't his boss it was Jesus he said he looked because he spoke gentle to him Oh my he said Paul you're just struggling yourself to death that won't do you any good he said Paul don't you see that little stream of water running there he said yeah' he said just pitch the thing in there get on it and ride it on down to the camp it goes to the camp what is that the promise will fulfill itself church it's the promise is already on its way to fulfillment all you got to do is believe in it all you got to do is get on it and ride on it amen he said I jumped up and rolled the log in and jumped on the log went down over the riffle just a screaming to the top my voice screaming I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it and when he come to himself he was right out in the middle of the floor his wife screaming at the top of her voice he was out in the middle of the floor saying I'm riding on it I'm riding on it I'm riding on it he said brother and sister I know the trials are hard I'm getting old and I've preached I've done everything I know to do I've got to a place where I see I can't do no more I've just laid the whole thing in the lap of the Lord Jesus and I'm riding on it oh church can you say Amen to that tonight I'm riding on it I'm riding on the promise we're going to make it all the way I'm writing on God's promise I the Lord hath planted it I water it day and night and then brother brandham adds another scripture on to that scripture as he many times does and I'll read it in just a moment he said let's some should pluck it from my hand God's church WIll endure forever hallelujah oh that gives me confidence Church the word of God will stand in emphatically right forever and regardless if kingdoms come or atomic bombs fall or America backslides come on Church regardless what happens in the election whatever takes place this is his word I the Lord will water it amen I the Lord have planted it I will water it day and night I'll keep it lest any should hurt it he said and this is his he keeps said I'm riding on it I believe it with all my heart oh do you believe it church he said Joseph believed it and it brought him up out of the pit he was the prince of prosperity John 10:27 said my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me this is the the verse that brother Brandon puts now with with the other one where it says I'll keep it day and night he said I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand Hallelujah My Father which gave them to me is greater than all no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand so you say well I got plucked out of the father's hand because of a person no you didn't the devil told you you did but you didn't get plucked out of the father's hand because of a person are you with me now because of something somebody said or somebody did you belong to God Jesus went to the pit do you know that see Joseph's life was a foreshadowing brother said it was for knowledge of Christ Jesus went to the pit he actually went to hell how many know that tonight 1 Peter 318 for Christ also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit by which also the spirit he went and preached unto the spirits in prison he preached unto the spirits in prison which sometime were disobedient when Once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing where in few that his eight Souls were saved by water and so Joseph is in the pit he's in the pit for shadowing something Jesus had to stay in the grave brother brandom tells in one place that the promise barred Christ from leaving the tomb until the time oh my the promise actually kept him in the grave until the time the same as uh the same resurrection power was in him but the promise barred him until the the the time was up right the same with our loved ones who have went away right they're in the they're they're they're in the grave or we say they're in Paradise or they're not Paradise they're waiting in that Dimension that sixth Dimension they're waiting on us but what are they doing there why why are they there why why haven't they already come back because the promise bars what promise we which are alive and remain right our bodies had to be changed right and they're raised at that time so that promise bars until the time so the promise B him to the time but while he was in there he wasn't just laying there idle but he actually goes into the pit Oh my he goes into oh church he preached to the souls in prison and brother brandham taught us said he went to that pit to witness that the word was true right he goes to the pit to preach to those who didn't repent to Noah's in Noah's day and he said the word is true that Noah was preaching those that didn't repent in in Adam's day those that didn't repent in Enoch day those that didn't repent in every prophet's day he goes down he preaches to them and he says now remember remember they told you there was one coming they spoke there was one coming and I am him hallelujah what was he doing proving to them witnessing that the word was true and then he would go and you know the story he' take the keys away from the devil kick him back down into hell and empty Paradise as a mighty conqueror on the way out oh my and brother Bram says this he said oh I'm so glad I have the promise of God so infallible that he went to hell to Wi witnessed to it I'm going somewhere with this then we'll close he witnessed to the souls in prison he was the one the prophet spoke of he was the woman's seed he was the Messiah they rejected listen if Joseph was in the pit there had to be a reason because he was Joseph Prince of prosperity if you find Jesus uh wi or or in Hell there has to be a reason he's there right there had to be a reason remember all the other ones that went never come out they couldn't come out but he came out glory to God and the fact that Joseph come out of the pit proved who he was and the fact that Jesus rose again on the third day proved who he was and so he goes down to witness to him and say I'm I'm him you he you couldn't kill me you couldn't defeat me I am the purpose of God hallelujah oh my if you listen if if Joseph went to the pit there had to be a reason if the Son of God went to hell there had to be reason if you go through the trial of your life there must be a reason why because God has planted you why has he planted you there as a witness why did he put you in leoa as a witness and we're here now come on church you can go to souls that are in prison now you could go to brother brandom having that Vision or that trans where he sees the women and he sees the way that they're acting in the JC Penny store you remember the story right I know that's deep but you just think about it for a minute he's he's dealing with Souls that are in prison now that are in prison in Satan's Eden and we were put here in the pit are you with me now what's true of the groom must be true of the Bride we were put here in the pit to witness to Leona to witness to the devil this is us this is the bride oh church cuz many might have fell by the wayside but I didn't many might have gave up but you didn't many might have let Church problems get to them many might have let might have let little things they found in the message little things about brother brandom that they found this out on the Internet or that on the internet they might let that get to them but there would be a people who would believe the word of God with all of their heart and in the pit they would witness to the people in the pit to the souls in prison and say I am she come on Church got to be a reason why where we're at it's a it's a terrible age you might say hell has enlarged herself it's all around us they made it almost impossible to work almost impossible to raise children almost impossible but it was almost impossible for Joseph to come out of the pit and end up on the throne but it wasn't impossible why because he was Joseph you know what it was it was probable it wasn't just probable it was guaranteed somebody ought to preach on that but the Joel when the impossible becomes the guarantee when it becomes a guarantee when did it become a guarantee because it it was Joseph in the pit anybody else in the pit they might have died anybody else in the pit they might have ended their life in obscurity and savior but not Joseph he was the prince of prosperity and not the bride you will not end that way this bride will not be defeated I don't care what's going on in the message and how discouraged you get by people you just remember that I the Lord have planted it I'll Water it day and night right people might come brother the har we see over the years you see people come and go and come and go come and go but he said I the Lord have planted brother Harold are you with me now I'll Water it day and night somebody's going to make it oh church and you're a witness today of what God can do Hallelujah sorry for keeping you long tonight Joseph wasn't in the pit to stay in the pit Jesus wasn't in the pit to stay in the pit he was just passing through but he was a witness he was passing through the pit got to Hell brother brand brother brand said when he got down where Satan was Satan said oh now I've got him he said no you don't kicked in the door of Hell grabbed the key off of his side kicked him back down into heaven and and come up the mighty conqueror why because it was written in the word I will not leave thy soul in hell I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption and on the strength of belief and faith in that promise he went down believing and he come up a Victor the mighty conqueror listen Church you and I may be in leod deia but we're going to come out of the pit we're going to come out of Satan's Eden and we're going to come out with our shoes on we're going to come out Victorious we're going to come out doing what God Said we're going to come out a bride without spot or wrinkle who has the voice of God in her are you hearing me who the final voice to the final age because we cannot stay in the pit we're here to overcome it Joseph was in the pit to overcome it Jesus was in hell to overcome it we are in Leo to Sea to overcome it in your own personal life you might be and what you feel like is Hell on Earth but you're there to overcome it Paul says that this way as the musicians come for you for I reckon I like that that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy how could Paul say that in Chains rats running across his feet you know what rats do when you can't scare them away eventually they come start eating taking a bite he sit there he can't do nothing about it he's dictating letters writing oh my tell them because they allowed him to have a scribe in there and he'd tell them I reckon glory to God I'm so glad this Bible wasn't written by Angels so glad it was written by men who went through some things women who went through some things that that their stories were told in it I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worth worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us hallelujah you may be in a pit but you're not of it you may be in a bad political situation but you're not of it you're coming out to sit on the throne oh hope you can see it church it's had to become personal to me and I trust it'll be become personal to you too I'm here to overcome I'm not here to give in I'm not here to give up I'm here to overcome so let whatever happens going to happen I believe that if if they take me out of the pit to sell me into slavery that that must be the word of God in my life coming to fulfillment and when I get in Piper's house and start to raise a little bit if they lie on me and I have to run away and they put me in prison it must be God's bringing bringing me closer to the throne because the Way Up Is Down Hallelujah let's bow our heads [Music] together there's two things you can do in the pit you can you can be buried by the dirt people are throwing or you can stomp on that dirt until it gets so high that you just walk out of it the fact that Joseph ends up being the instrument of Mercy to his Brethren that threw him in the pit is proof he was the prince of prosperity he had the mature it the the character fit to rule brother brandom taught us power without character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule that's what I want church that's what he's working on and it may be seem hard right now but you're coming out you've got to because of who you are and you got to believe that if you believe it with all your heart he'll bring you out and he'll set you on his throne I believe he's done that I I believe we're spiritually now reigning it's Kings and Priests one day we'll be with him on his throne Heavenly Father we love you Lord Jesus we thank you for being here with us for being present in our troubles for being in our trials Lord we thank you for that I pray God that we'd never allow bitterness to take over we'd never allow worry to rule us anxiety to rule Lord that we would know that if you planted us Lord we will overcome because you will not let your your garden be spoiled you will not let those that you have planted be plucked out of your hand I thank you for that Lord I pray you'd give us a revelation deep down in our souls of what you've done for us Lord I I pray that you'd do that we thank you for it we love you and we thank you for all that you do in Jesus name amen that baby's here tonight isn't she God
