[38:30] helping you this morning. Brother uh
[38:32] Bill, we need to remember him. Brother
[38:35] Bill White Camp and his family, they're
[38:37] dealing with uh his dad uh is very close
[38:40] to passing. So, we just need to be
[38:43] praying for them especially. It's very
[38:45] difficult to sit there and watch someone
[38:47] that you can't help them. You feel so
[38:49] helpless. I've been there with my own
[38:51] dad and and so we just need to pull for
[38:54] them and and uh pray for comfort for
[38:56] that family and and that that would uh
[38:59] uh go as peacefully as possible. And we
[39:02] just believe the Lord can do great
[39:03] things, don't we? Amen. It's good to
[39:05] have Sister Fresco with us this morning.
[39:07] God bless you. And brother Wendle's with
[39:09] us. It was kind of a sudden thing. They
[39:12] come up and just needed to get a few
[39:13] days away. and I just kind of impressed
[39:15] on him to to come this morning cuz
[39:18] believe the Lord uh speaks through our
[39:20] brother and we just love him so much and
[39:23] he's been a mentor to me. I I think uh
[39:27] brother Joel may not even be where he's
[39:30] at today uh and maybe not myself as
[39:33] well, but brother Joel especially was
[39:35] benefited from brother Windle's ministry
[39:37] and the opening of the word and things
[39:38] early on and and uh you can't replace
[39:42] that. God uses men in your lives for a
[39:45] reason. And so we're so thankful for
[39:47] brother Wendell and we just stand with
[39:49] him. He's been a pastor there in Pawne,
[39:51] Oklahoma for almost 40 years and he
[39:54] don't look that old enough to have been
[39:55] a pastor for that long, but we sure love
[39:58] Brother Wendell and thank you for
[40:00] coming. He's going to sing for you this
[40:01] morning. So we're going to have several
[40:03] songs hopefully from Brother Wendle this
[40:05] morning and we're just going to join in
[40:07] and worship the Lord. Do you love him
[40:08] this morning? Isn't God good to us?
[40:11] Amen. Isn't he
[40:13] good? You know, no matter what we've
[40:15] gone through or what's happened in our
[40:17] life, it says, the Bible says, his
[40:19] mercies are new every morning. And I'm
[40:22] so grateful for that. Every day when we
[40:25] wake up, he said, "My mercies are new."
[40:27] Amen. God bless you. We're going to uh
[40:29] let's sing uh Some Glad Morning when
[40:32] this life is over. Brother Windle comes
[40:34] and get him set up up here this morning.
[40:36] Some glad morning when this life is
[40:40] over
[40:42] I I'll fly
[40:46] away to a home on God's shore.
[40:53] Oh my way.

[41:52] is to be here today. And uh you know,
[41:55] it's always an honor to be in the house
[41:56] of the Lord. And uh but man, it's really
[41:59] nice to be back home with with friends
[42:02] here. And and we just feel like we're

[42:12] You can be seated here here today.
[42:19] And um I might have a a few might try a
[42:24] few uh different songs

[42:31] old
[42:32] flesh, this
[42:34] old nature that you deal with, Satan is
[42:37] is always trying to take advantage of
[42:38] you.
[42:40] And you know, you've got the
[42:42] [Music]
[42:44] um the the Apostle Paul put it. He said,
[42:47] "We have a treasure in earthn vessels."
[42:50] That's right. And um sometimes this old
[42:53] flesh can can really get get the best of
[42:57] you. Yes, sir. And uh can wear on you
[43:00] and your mind can uh uh Well, how many's
[43:04] ever had mind battles? Well, praise the

[43:29] Trouble seems to like your style and
[43:34] you're feeling all
[43:36] [Music]
[43:37] alone. At your last resort, they had to
[43:40] leave for a while. Leave your name at
[43:43] the sound of the
[43:45] tone. Come on. It seems the world up and
[43:49] moved away. All that stayed was fear and
[43:53] doubt.
[43:55] They came looking for trouble and
[43:58] decided to stay. Now you're looking for
[44:01] a way to check out. Take it to Jesus.
[44:08] He knows he feels he
[44:12] cares. No one does it better when your
[44:17] life's in need of repair. Come on. Take
[44:20] it to

[44:42] night. Chase the sleep out of your
[44:47] eyes. Is dark. But as you fiddle with
[44:50] the light, you break down and start to
[44:54] cry. Some bitter, painful past mistakes
[45:00] have been haunting you
[45:03] again and conjuring up the image of the
[45:06] fool that it takes to think that you
[45:09] could ever win. Take it to Jesus.
[45:17] He knows. He feels he
[45:21] cares. No bone does it better when your
[45:26] life's in need of
[45:28] repair. Take it,

[50:42] [Music]
[50:43] Lord.

[50:56] pole or it's not just a figment of
[50:59] mountains imagination, but the Lord
[51:01] Jesus is living. Oh yeah. and he's real
[51:04] and he hears your prayer. Well, can you

[51:36] Can you say amen?
[51:38] Some of
[51:40] my songs that people love so
[51:44] much were written
[51:48] when I
[51:50] was in the deepest of despair of my
[51:53] life.
[51:55] And if it hadn't been for God allowing
[51:57] me to go through the despair of my life,
[52:00] I would have not been able to reach
[52:03] something way down inside me that can
[52:06] benefit somebody else. Can you say amen?
[52:10] Amen.

[52:17] [Music]
[52:19] storms. Many times she thought she'd

[52:26] But his grace kept on
[52:31] leading and she's cresting every tide.
[52:39] Many days upon the
[52:41] [Music]
[52:44] waters, sailing neath the angry
[52:50] skies. Her compass has not failed
[52:55] her. And her captain never dies.

[53:30] battered. The sails are
[53:35] torn, but it's brought me
[53:41] safely to my father's
[53:47] arms. Many boats have started out
[53:52] alone, but only one, my friend, can make
[53:58] it. These rolling seas are sure to
[54:03] build and the hurricanes
[54:09] crash. But our our captain's

[59:45] news. This old world just don't have a
[59:48] clue
[59:50] anymore. Did I sing it the last time I
[59:52] was
[59:56] here? I messed myself
[1:00:00] up. There's a lot of talk about the
[1:00:04] latest news. This old world just don't
[1:00:07] have a clue anymore.

[1:00:19] Kill those babies cuz mama, she's got a
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:24] choice. It's just about enough to give a
[1:00:28] guy the blues. Sin and death is making
[1:00:32] the rules. But I have got my sights on
[1:00:36] another world.
[1:00:39] While I know it's true that things are
[1:00:42] bad, I'm looking up with eyes. So glad
[1:00:46] I've got this greatest feeling to go
[1:00:51] [Applause]
[1:00:52] home. Going
[1:00:55] home where I
[1:00:59] belong. I hear the seven angel shout,
[1:01:03] "Get ready. It won't be
[1:01:07] long. I've applied the blood to the
[1:01:11] door. Sin and death will have me no more
[1:01:15] because I am going
[1:01:21] home. Let's try

[1:01:29] time the thoughts of leaving my toe in
[1:01:33] the line out
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:36] here. The plagues are falling all
[1:01:39] around. The angel of death is circling
[1:01:43] town. Those without the blood will
[1:01:46] surely
[1:01:48] fall. But I'm
[1:01:51] standing blood of the lamb, feasting on
[1:01:54] the words of the son of man. My pack and
[1:01:58] I know it won't be long.
[1:02:03] So if you're looking for me down here
[1:02:06] below, I have moved to my heavenly home.
[1:02:10] My Lord has come to take me take me
[1:02:15] home. Oh, going

[1:02:25] shouting, "Get ready. It won't be
[1:02:30] long. I've applied the blood to the
[1:02:34] door. Sin and love will have me no more
[1:02:38] because I am
[1:02:41] going. I am

[1:04:11] are all fixing to be changed. Amen. And
[1:04:15] I'd like to look here in the book of of
[1:04:17] of Mark, the second chapter. Thank you
[1:04:19] for your patience here this morning. And
[1:04:21] I hope you enjoyed those songs. Some of
[1:04:22] them was a little bit low. And uh I
[1:04:25] don't I don't use capos too often and um
[1:04:29] but I I decided to try a capo and and uh
[1:04:32] we got it a little bit too low on a
[1:04:33] couple of those songs. But Amen. But
[1:04:36] isn't God just wonderful? If you
[1:04:38] wouldn't mind just standing to your feet
[1:04:40] here and help us to to read here in Mark
[1:04:43] uh 2 and 1.
[1:04:47] And again he entered into
[1:04:49] compernium after some days and it was no
[1:04:52] that he noised that he was in the house
[1:04:55] and straightway many were gathered
[1:04:57] together in so much that there was no
[1:05:00] room to receive them. No not so much as
[1:05:03] about the door and he preached the word
[1:05:06] unto them. And they come unto him
[1:05:08] bringing one sick of the py which was
[1:05:11] born of four. And when they could not
[1:05:15] come nigh unto him for the press, they
[1:05:18] uncovered the roof where he was. And
[1:05:21] when they had broken it up, they let
[1:05:23] down the bed wherein the the sick of the
[1:05:26] Pauly lay. And when Jesus saw their
[1:05:30] faith, he said unto the sick of the
[1:05:32] Pauly, "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee."
[1:05:38] Now, I'd also like to look here in the
[1:05:39] book of Philippians
[1:05:41] 3:12. Amen.
[1:05:46] um uh 3 and 12. And these ear monitors
[1:05:50] are going in and out. I don't know if
[1:05:52] it's just signal or if it's battery or
[1:05:55] man, it might be just the
[1:05:56] signal. Um it says, "Brethren, I count
[1:06:00] not myself to have
[1:06:02] apprehended, but this one thing I do."
[1:06:05] Yes. forgetting those things which are
[1:06:09] behind and reaching forth under those
[1:06:12] things which are before.
[1:06:15] I press toward the mark for the prize of
[1:06:19] the high calling of God in Christ
[1:06:23] Jesus. Can you say amen? Let's go to the
[1:06:26] Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you
[1:06:28] today for your amazing love to us.
[1:06:33] Thank you for always being good to
[1:06:36] us. Thank you for never failing
[1:06:39] us. Thank you, Lord, for this blessed
[1:06:43] promise that we
[1:06:45] are going to soon meet you in the skies.
[1:06:48] For the dead in Christ shall rise first,
[1:06:50] and those which are alive and remain
[1:06:53] shall caught be caught up together to
[1:06:55] meet them in the air. Now Lord, this
[1:07:00] morning we're asking that you would give
[1:07:02] us all
[1:07:03] courage. And I just pray Lord that you
[1:07:06] would help me as I
[1:07:08] minister, Lord. And I just pray that
[1:07:10] you'll bless your congregation here.
[1:07:14] Bless our precious pastor and his wife.
[1:07:16] And Lord, the associate pastor and the
[1:07:20] the deacons and trustees, all those that
[1:07:23] labor here. Lord, bless every elder.
[1:07:27] Bless Lord every
[1:07:29] family. I pray father that your
[1:07:31] anointing would be here among us and
[1:07:33] give strength this morning in the name
[1:07:36] of the Lord Jesus. Can the church say
[1:07:39] amen?
[1:07:40] And amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:07:44] seated. I want to preach here this
[1:07:47] morning on the
[1:07:49] press. And uh I want to say that I so
[1:07:52] thoroughly enjoyed the Bible study the
[1:07:55] other night. Brother Ben on Wednesday
[1:07:57] night. It was a um I you you all have a
[1:08:00] wonderful Bible teacher here and um I
[1:08:04] was so blessed to be here and and and to
[1:08:06] listen and and um I appreciate the
[1:08:10] quality of man that brother Ben is and
[1:08:12] and um we appreciate uh brother Joel. He
[1:08:15] coming. Brother Joel preached our our
[1:08:17] New Year's meeting this year and and um
[1:08:20] what an incredible blessing he was. and
[1:08:24] all of you. Amen. It's just it's so good
[1:08:27] to to be a part of the great family of
[1:08:30] God, isn't it? Isn't it just wonderful?
[1:08:33] So, I I want to speak on press and as we
[1:08:37] were Amen. The New Testament meaning for
[1:08:41] press. Amen. H in the first scripture
[1:08:44] that we read, they they could not come
[1:08:47] nigh unto Christ for the press and they
[1:08:51] uncovered the roof where he was. And
[1:08:54] after they had broken it up, and man,
[1:08:57] they had uh uh tore the roof off the
[1:09:00] place, they they let they let the man
[1:09:05] that was their friend down right in
[1:09:08] front of Jesus. I that must have been
[1:09:10] quite the service. Yeah, I don't think
[1:09:12] they had microphones in those days. And
[1:09:14] and uh could you imagine Jesus trying to
[1:09:16] preach a sermon while the roof is coming
[1:09:19] off? And um so that word press, it in
[1:09:22] the New Testament, it can mean large
[1:09:24] crowds or multitudes, throngs. Amen. The
[1:09:29] press was wanting people wanting to see
[1:09:33] Jesus. Amen. But these men could not be
[1:09:38] satisfied with just seeing Jesus.
[1:09:41] They could not be satisfied with just
[1:09:45] saying, "Yes, I was I was there Sunday
[1:09:47] morning. Yes, I was there Wednesday
[1:09:49] night." It they weren't satisfied to
[1:09:53] say, "Oh, what a wonderful service it
[1:09:55] was." These men needed to get the
[1:10:00] attention of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:10:03] Amen. These men could not be satisfied
[1:10:07] with just being in the presence of
[1:10:11] Jesus. Amen. Now this morning, Amen. I I
[1:10:14] I I It's good to be here. It's It's good
[1:10:17] to be in the same place where Jesus is.
[1:10:20] It's good to be in Amen. where where we
[1:10:23] sing about him and we preach about him
[1:10:25] and we we sing about him and we we we do
[1:10:30] uh we pray prayers to him. Amen. And I,
[1:10:33] you know, sometimes on a Wednesday
[1:10:35] nights, how many knows it can be a
[1:10:36] little bit tough getting to church. When
[1:10:38] you get to church, you're sometimes
[1:10:40] you're not all there. Amen. You get you
[1:10:43] you you get weary in your mind. Amen.
[1:10:46] But listen, I I I think that there is
[1:10:50] something about somebody that's not
[1:10:53] wanting to just be a part of the
[1:10:55] congregation, but they want to get the
[1:10:59] attention of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:01] Amen. this morning if you made up your
[1:11:03] mind this morning that I don't want to
[1:11:05] just hear about him. I don't want to
[1:11:07] just feel him. I don't want to see the
[1:11:10] preacher anointed. I don't want to just
[1:11:12] hear a singer that's anointed, but I
[1:11:15] need to get the attention of the Lord
[1:11:18] Jesus Christ. Amen. Well, can you say
[1:11:20] amen? I tell you, some of the best
[1:11:22] services is when you have been in a in a
[1:11:25] mind battle all week and you've gone
[1:11:28] through the fire and you've gone through
[1:11:30] the test and it seems like you're weary
[1:11:33] and you ain't got nothing left. Amen.
[1:11:36] Those are the times when the Lord Jesus
[1:11:38] uh and you press you have to press past
[1:11:42] your tiredness. You have to press past
[1:11:44] the mind battle. You have to press past
[1:11:46] these things. Uh amen. that when you
[1:11:49] come into his presence that you find
[1:11:52] out, amen, that he still has the answer,
[1:11:56] that he can still heal your body. That
[1:11:58] he can still renew your mind. That he
[1:12:00] can still do these things because when
[1:12:03] you come into his presence and get his
[1:12:07] attention, I tell you, good things
[1:12:09] happen when you get here. Well, can you
[1:12:11] say amen? How many wants to get his
[1:12:13] attention here this morning? I don't
[1:12:16] want to just be a part of the press, but

[1:12:36] So, well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:12:38] Preachers go through trials, too. Amen.
[1:12:41] I'm here to tell you, Satan will do
[1:12:43] anything he can to stop God's purpose in
[1:12:47] every one of our lives. But I want to
[1:12:49] tell you, if you can get his attention,
[1:12:53] all things are made new when you get his
[1:12:57] attention. All right. Good buddy.

[1:14:57] the press. I I don't want to just be a
[1:15:00] part of the congregation. I don't want
[1:15:02] to be the one that the pastor looks at

[1:16:11] a desire for the kingdom when people
[1:16:14] talk about there's something about the
[1:16:17] supernatural that that that people are
[1:16:19] reaching out. They it it'll attract the
[1:16:22] supernatural. This message has attracted
[1:16:24] a lot of people in the first and second
[1:16:27] pools. Amen. And and and and it and it's
[1:16:30] wonderful. But you see, Amen. I don't

[1:16:38] come because I Amen. I
[1:16:41] I want to see Amen. I feel the presence
[1:16:45] of the Lord. I don't want to come just
[1:16:47] to to hear my favorite preacher. But it
[1:16:50] is so important that I come in contact
[1:16:54] with God. I don't want to just pray in
[1:16:57] the morning time. Amen. And not come in
[1:17:00] contact with him. I don't want to just
[1:17:02] read my Bible and not come in contact

[1:17:09] know that I know that I know that he
[1:17:13] sees me and that he knows where I'm at.
[1:17:19] Can you say amen?
[1:17:21] Amen. The Apostle Paul, as we read,
[1:17:25] Amen. He says, "There's one thing that I
[1:17:27] do. I'm forgetting the things that are
[1:17:30] behind me." Yes, sir. And I'm reaching
[1:17:32] forth. I'm reaching forth into those
[1:17:35] things that are before me. Oh yeah. And
[1:17:37] I'm having to press. It's not easy. Man,
[1:17:41] there's a lot there that wants to keep
[1:17:43] me back. There's a lot there that wants
[1:17:46] to keep me down. There's a lot there
[1:17:49] that wants to keep me away from his
[1:17:52] presence. But I I must I must press
[1:17:56] toward the goal. I got to press toward
[1:17:59] the mark. There is something within me
[1:18:03] that is screaming out, I must press past
[1:18:08] these things that are trying to hinder
[1:18:10] me right now.
[1:18:12] Come on, sir. Amen. Sometimes you got to
[1:18:15] press past the condemnation to get in
[1:18:18] his presence. You got to press past
[1:18:20] Amen. You got to press past attitudes to
[1:18:23] get into his presence. You've got to
[1:18:25] press past your past. And you've got to
[1:18:29] forget those things which are behind
[1:18:31] you. And you've got to press with
[1:18:35] everything you've got. Yes, sir. Glory.
[1:18:38] All right. Wonderful. Absolutely. Yes.
[1:18:41] Amen. Good preaching. We can have an
[1:18:44] audience. Yeah. But I don't want to be a
[1:18:47] part of the audience, right? Come on.
[1:18:50] Pretty good.
[1:18:52] Come on. I don't want to be a part.
[1:18:54] Yeah.
[1:18:56] I don't want to just be accounted with
[1:18:58] new life in pawn. Come on, preach.
[1:19:03] I want to be accounted with him.
[1:19:07] I need him. I want to know him. I I I
[1:19:12] want him to know me. Oh, can you say
[1:19:14] amen? I want him to know me. Amen. Adam
[1:19:18] knew his wife. Amen. This one knew their
[1:19:22] wife. It was an intimate relationship. I
[1:19:25] want Christ with an intimate
[1:19:29] relationship with me. I want my life
[1:19:33] changed. I want to know he's there. I
[1:19:37] want to know that everything is going to
[1:19:40] be okay.
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:44] Good, buddy. Yeah. Amen.
[1:19:48] That word press toward the
[1:19:51] mark. It means to move into a position
[1:19:54] of contact with someone or
[1:19:58] something. It means to exert continuous
[1:20:02] physical
[1:20:03] force. It means to run
[1:20:06] swiftly in order to catch a person or a
[1:20:10] thing to run after. Yeah. Or are you
[1:20:14] hearing me? To press. Come on. It means
[1:20:17] I I'm I'm running swiftly. I I've got to
[1:20:21] do what I've got to do to catch him. To
[1:20:24] catch his attention to I I hope this is
[1:20:27] okay here this morning. Amen. To pursue.
[1:20:30] And And here's another meaning to pursue
[1:20:32] in a hostile matter to overtake.
[1:20:39] We had that kind of an attitude. Every
[1:20:41] time we come to church, we'd see
[1:20:42] miracles in the church. We had that kind
[1:20:45] of an attitude every time we prayed. I'm
[1:20:47] not going to just sit down or kneel down
[1:20:49] and pray another dead prayer. I've got
[1:20:52] to come into his presence.
[1:20:56] Yes. I refuse to come and sit in church
[1:21:00] and not come in contact with God.
[1:21:04] Right. Yes, sir. Yes.
[1:21:07] I want the
[1:21:09] anointing. I want to know that he knows
[1:21:14] that I'm here.
[1:21:17] Come on.
[1:21:21] It
[1:21:22] was Isn't that what blind Barnameus
[1:21:25] done? That's right. Come on. The press
[1:21:28] was there.
[1:21:30] Multitudes were following.
[1:21:33] But Jesus didn't know. Barameus was
[1:21:36] there. Yeah. But Jesus didn't know that
[1:21:39] he was there
[1:21:41] until he be to cry out in faith.
[1:21:44] Jesus,
[1:21:49] Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy. Oh
[1:21:54] God, if there ever gets a cry of
[1:21:57] desperation again, a cry that says I've
[1:22:01] got to have a change. I've got to come
[1:22:05] in contact. I can't go on the way I've
[1:22:08] been going.
[1:22:10] Jesus, thou son of David.
[1:22:16] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, thank you.
[1:22:18] There's got to be something in me.
[1:22:23] Oh, yeah. Yes. Absolutely. Yes, sir. Can
[1:22:27] you say amen?
[1:22:30] Amen. Yes.
[1:22:34] Good.

[1:22:39] spectators. Yeah.
[1:22:42] And there's going to be the
[1:22:42] participators.
[1:22:44] Come on now.
[1:22:46] Well, come on. Some of you thinking, "My
[1:22:49] goodness,
[1:22:51] where's brother Ben?" Brother
[1:22:53] Ben, why did you let that hokey preach
[1:22:56] this morning? Hallelujah. Well, I'm
[1:22:58] wondering the same thing. Hallelujah.
[1:23:03] There's going to be participators.
[1:23:06] Come on. And there's going to be
[1:23:07] spectators.
[1:23:10] There's going to be those sitting in the
[1:23:12] bleachers.
[1:23:16] Yes, sir. Munching on the popcorn.
[1:23:23] And wondering why their team ain't
[1:23:24] winning.
[1:23:27] Come on. Well, glory to God. Come on.
[1:23:31] There's going to be those those
[1:23:32] spectators
[1:23:34] grab their popcorn and say, "Get with
[1:23:36] it, will you? Come on."
[1:23:41] Yes, sir.
[1:23:43] What's wrong with you?
[1:23:49] Sorry, brother Ben.
[1:23:54] And then there's going to be
[1:23:56] participators. Oh, yeah.
[1:23:59] They've got skin in the game.
[1:24:04] They're out there win or lose, do or
[1:24:08] die.
[1:24:10] They're out there putting their life on
[1:24:11] the line. They're out there saying that
[1:24:15] it's up to me. They're out there saying,
[1:24:17] "I've got to I've got to win." And the
[1:24:21] Apostle Paul says, "I'm leaving
[1:24:23] everything else behind and I'm pressing
[1:24:25] toward that goal. I must win Christ.
[1:24:30] [Applause]
[1:24:34] Ain't interested in sitting a a man in a
[1:24:36] in an easy chair and criticizing
[1:24:39] everybody around me. I'm not interested
[1:24:41] in showing up to church once or twice a
[1:24:44] month. I need something.
[1:24:49] I want to participate.
[1:24:53] Come on. Praise the Lord. Yes,
[1:24:57] I
[1:24:58] hate watching games.
[1:25:03] Come on.
[1:25:04] Golf,
[1:25:10] it's boring.
[1:25:16] And no one will let me play with
[1:25:19] them. I think I make life pretty
[1:25:21] exciting, but they don't think so.
[1:25:26] Come on, buddy. I'm not a
[1:25:28] golfer, but I was I was asked to go with
[1:25:32] some guys on a really nice country club.
[1:25:34] I mean, it was I guess it was it was
[1:25:37] just awesome. And I I mean, I thought it
[1:25:38] was awesome. I I went out there. I mean,
[1:25:41] it was awesome. Just rolling greens and
[1:25:43] these guys, you could see. And I was
[1:25:45] just my and I'm out there trying and I I
[1:25:49] I keep ding
[1:25:51] ding and they leave me
[1:25:55] behind. And I'd always I'd always
[1:25:59] wondered what four
[1:26:02] meant. And I wondered how long how far I
[1:26:06] could get that to carry across those
[1:26:10] heels. They left me behind. I thought
[1:26:13] I'd have fun
[1:26:14] myself. So, I got the good old Wendell
[1:26:17] Martin lungs and I said,
[1:26:23] "Four, you
[1:26:26] should I guess four means watch out.
[1:26:29] You're fixing to get hit with a ball."
[1:26:32] And I mean, people were hitting the They
[1:26:34] were hitting the grass everywhere,
[1:26:36] carts. They were It was It was the
[1:26:38] funnest thing. Those guys came back up
[1:26:40] to me and says, "Listen, don't you
[1:26:44] ever I pay a lot of money for this
[1:26:48] course. Don't do that again."
[1:26:51] Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] I don't want to be a spectator. Come on.
[1:26:58] I want to be a participator.
[1:27:00] I want to be one. Oh, come on, church.
[1:27:04] Come on. I I want to be the woman with
[1:27:06] the issue of blood.
[1:27:08] Come on.
[1:27:12] Where the multitudes are all around him.
[1:27:14] They're all around him.
[1:27:17] She's dying. Yeah.
[1:27:20] She's got this female problem that's
[1:27:22] going on for 12 years.
[1:27:25] She spent everything that she had.
[1:27:28] She had nowhere else to go. Come on,
[1:27:31] buddy.
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] And she had to press through the press.
[1:27:38] She had to
[1:27:40] press through the spectators. She had to
[1:27:44] press past the doubts and the fears. She
[1:27:48] had to press until she reached the helm
[1:27:52] of his garment. Yes, sir. All right.
[1:27:55] Yes.
[1:27:57] She was not interested in being a
[1:28:00] spectator.
[1:28:02] Yeah.
[1:28:04] Oh my. She needed his attention. All
[1:28:08] right. Is this okay this morning? Yes.
[1:28:13] You
[1:28:14] see, I think God still has people who's
[1:28:17] going to leave it all on the field.
[1:28:18] Right. Amen. I think God's still got
[1:28:21] people. Amen.
[1:28:24] Who's going to lay everything in the
[1:28:25] game? Come on.
[1:28:28] Hallelujah. Yes, the elect is part of
[1:28:30] the crowd. But the elect has got some
[1:28:33] skin in the game. Amen. Matthew 11:12
[1:28:37] says, "Amen. From the days of John the
[1:28:39] Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven
[1:28:40] suffers violence, and the violent take
[1:28:43] it by force." Can you say, "Amen." So
[1:28:46] coming in contact with God, Amen, is not
[1:28:49] the same as being in his presence. Amen.
[1:28:52] Y'all remember the story? Amen. Of the
[1:28:55] of the man who was uh Amen.
[1:28:58] Uh who his neighbor or his friend had
[1:29:01] come in from a from a a long ways away
[1:29:05] and and came over and showed up at
[1:29:07] midnight and a and uh Amen. from a a far
[1:29:12] journey. And he didn't have bread. And
[1:29:14] so he goes over to the to the he goes
[1:29:16] over to the to his neighbor. Amen. at
[1:29:19] midnight and he's knocking on the door
[1:29:21] and he's saying, "Uh, neighbor, do you
[1:29:23] have do you have bread?" And and and and
[1:29:27] the neighbor hollers out from his bed
[1:29:29] and says, "I'm in bed. My children are
[1:29:31] in bed." And amen. I you come back till
[1:29:35] the morning. Amen. And the parable that
[1:29:38] Jesus Jesus is given the parable. And
[1:29:41] Jesus says that the man kept on
[1:29:43] knocking. He kept on knocking. And he
[1:29:47] says, "But I've got a friend here who
[1:29:49] needs some bread, and I know you've got
[1:29:50] bread in there, cuz I I could smell the
[1:29:53] aroma from earlier in the day. I know
[1:29:55] you've got it." Amen. And the Bible says
[1:30:00] that that he did not come because he was
[1:30:03] a friend, but he came because he kept on
[1:30:08] knocking. He came and he gave him his
[1:30:11] heart's desire. Amen. Because of his
[1:30:14] opportunity. Oh yeah. Oh, can you say
[1:30:17] amen? Amen. You see, Amen. This is what
[1:30:20] is lacking so much today. Amen. In our
[1:30:23] in our lives, Amen. is that opportunity.
[1:30:27] Amen. It's not that God doesn't have
[1:30:29] your answer. It is not that God doesn't
[1:30:31] hear prayer. It is not that God, amen,
[1:30:34] has forgot about you. It's just that God
[1:30:36] is looking for somebody who wants it
[1:30:39] more than they want golf. wants it more
[1:30:41] than they want hunting, wants it more
[1:30:43] than they want guns or they want a
[1:30:47] sports or cars or houses or land. He
[1:30:50] wants somebody that says, "I'm going to
[1:30:52] get rid of everything. I'm not going to
[1:30:55] leave you until I know that I've got
[1:30:58] you. Until I know I've come in contact
[1:31:01] with you. Until I know I've been given
[1:31:04] what I desire."
[1:31:07] Yes, sir. Oh, Lord. That's the truth.
[1:31:09] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Lord Jesus says,
[1:31:14] let me just read it to you. Good. Amen.
[1:31:17] Luke
[1:31:17] 11:5. And he said unto them, "Which of
[1:31:20] you shall have a friend shall go unto
[1:31:22] him at midnight and say unto him,
[1:31:24] friend, lend me three loaves. For a
[1:31:27] friend of mine in his journey is come to
[1:31:29] me, and I have nothing to set before
[1:31:31] him." And he from within shall answer
[1:31:34] and say, "Trouble me not. The doors now
[1:31:35] shut. My children were with me in bed. I
[1:31:37] cannot rise and give thee." And I say
[1:31:39] unto you, though he will not rise and
[1:31:41] give him because of his friend, but
[1:31:43] because of his opportunity because he
[1:31:45] keeps on pressing
[1:31:48] because you say, you say, "I've already
[1:31:51] asked him three times. I'm not going to
[1:31:53] ask him again." God's looking for
[1:31:54] somebody that'll keep on asking. God's
[1:31:57] looking for somebody that'll keep on
[1:31:59] God's looking for somebody with
[1:32:00] desperation. Oh, come on now. You're
[1:32:03] going to let the enemy keep you down
[1:32:04] when God's got what you need?
[1:32:06] You're going to let the devil talk you
[1:32:08] out of your blessing when God's got what
[1:32:10] you have need of. Amen. What did he say?
[1:32:13] Amen. He says, I say unto you, ask. Or
[1:32:16] or he says, because of his opportunity,
[1:32:18] he will rise and give him as many as he
[1:32:19] needeth. I say unto you, ask and it
[1:32:21] shall be given to you. Seek and you
[1:32:23] shall find. Knock and it shall be open
[1:32:25] unto you. For everyone that askketh
[1:32:27] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[1:32:29] and to him that knockketh it shall be
[1:32:30] given. If a son shall ask bread of you,
[1:32:33] amen, that is a father, will he give him
[1:32:36] a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he
[1:32:39] give him a h a for a fish, a serpent? Or
[1:32:43] or if he ask an egg, will will he offer
[1:32:46] him a scorpion? If ye then being evil
[1:32:50] know how to give good gifts unto your
[1:32:52] children, how much more shall the ho
[1:32:56] your heavenly father give the Holy
[1:32:59] Spirit to them that ask him?
[1:33:03] All right.
[1:33:05] Come
[1:33:06] on. Right. Yes, sir. It's the truth. He
[1:33:10] specifically said the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:13] Come on. And you know the Holy Spirit is
[1:33:14] one thing that we we see. No one seeking
[1:33:17] for anymore.
[1:33:19] Preach. Very good. Yeah. Oh, you say,
[1:33:21] "Oh, we're not Pentecostal."
[1:33:23] Pentecostals, they go up there and they
[1:33:25] just they just they just come every
[1:33:26] service and until they get something. I
[1:33:30] don't think that's unscriptural. Come
[1:33:31] on. Come on.
[1:33:34] Preach.
[1:33:40] Well, praise the Lord. Well, the Lord
[1:33:42] knows what I have need of. Yeah. So does
[1:33:45] your wife.
[1:33:49] Yeah. Come on. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:53] Amen. So does your husband. Come on now.
[1:33:57] But there's something about
[1:34:00] having again skin in the game.
[1:34:03] There's something about
[1:34:07] God. Oh yes. I'm needing this more than
[1:34:10] I need anything else. Yeah. Come on,
[1:34:13] honey. If you don't believe I love
[1:34:16] you, I'm well I I I I'm I'm I'm stepping

[1:34:31] All right. Amen. Right. I'm going to let
[1:34:34] her know. I need you, Lord. I need you.
[1:34:38] Don't just say, "I need you." And then
[1:34:39] going off and you're never spending time
[1:34:40] with him. Well, I I know this ain't deep
[1:34:43] here this morning, but it may be deep
[1:34:44] for some.
[1:34:47] Because we need a relationship with the
[1:34:49] Lord Jesus Christ.

[1:34:52] you the Holy Ghost. You want the Holy
[1:34:54] Ghost. You young people want the baptism

[1:35:20] to operate them. Amen. But then the
[1:35:23] devil wants to come and say, "Well, it's
[1:35:24] not important. The Holy Ghost is
[1:35:25] important. I don't care how it comes. I
[1:35:28] don't care how it comes. I must have

[1:37:47] desperation of
[1:37:50] soul that creates desire.
[1:37:56] Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:00] It's the desperation of soul.
[1:38:06] Oh yeah.

[1:38:16] need of nothing.

[1:39:10] come in contact with the Lord Jesus.
[1:39:13] Yes. It's good, buddy. Yes. Oh.
[1:39:18] Amen. Then we get into miracles. Yeah.
[1:39:23] When we get to where we can't go any
[1:39:25] further, then God steps in on the scene.
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:30] When we get to the point where it seems
[1:39:32] like,
[1:39:35] that's when God comes on the scene.
[1:39:39] Absolutely. Come on now. Oh, come on,
[1:39:41] church. When the Red Sea's in front of

[1:40:02] baby this morning. I'm sort of preaching
[1:40:03] to myself here.

[1:40:11] Yeah.
[1:40:13] Coming in contact with him.
[1:40:18] Don't leave the service and say, "Oh,

[1:40:26] my, you can go home and amen picking
[1:40:29] your teeth after you eat your your steak
[1:40:31] or whatever. Amen." And you can say,
[1:40:34] "All right, but the atmosphere is not
[1:40:36] what we're looking for. Atmosphere is
[1:40:38] good. We want the atmosphere. You got to
[1:40:39] create the
[1:40:41] atmosphere." But what good?
[1:40:44] Come on. What
[1:40:46] good is a chicken
[1:40:49] egg with the hen brooding over it?
[1:40:55] Oh my. If the hen never came in contact
[1:40:59] with the male,
[1:41:03] you could have the right atmosphere. You
[1:41:04] could hear the right sermons. You can
[1:41:06] hear the right singing. You can hear
[1:41:08] these things. You can feel it. Yeah.
[1:41:12] Yeah. Come on. Come on. But until you
[1:41:16] come in contact, come on now. Yeah. With

[1:41:30] comfortable preaching this anywhere
[1:41:31] else, but I You guys are all friends.
[1:41:33] Yeah. Good, buddy. Yes.
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] Oh, glory to God.
[1:41:48] What made Jesus so unique is because he
[1:41:50] come in contact with the father. Yeah.
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:41:54] He could say, "Destroy this temple in
[1:41:56] three days. I'll raise it up." Yes.
[1:42:02] Wouldn't no man be able to say that?
[1:42:03] Wouldn't no church member able to say
[1:42:05] that? No. But this man come in contact.
[1:42:08] Come on. He was able to say, "Philip,
[1:42:12] man, if you just show us the father,
[1:42:13] you're close to him." He'd say,
[1:42:16] "Philip, have I not been so long a time
[1:42:18] with you, you'd say, "Oh, no. I am when
[1:42:20] you've seen me, you've seen the father.
[1:42:21] I mean, I am the expression. I
[1:42:28] If you want to know what God looks like,
[1:42:30] look at me.
[1:42:32] Oh, come on, bride of Jesus Christ." Oh,
[1:42:34] yeah.
[1:42:35] If the world tell the world. Yeah. Well,
[1:42:39] what does this message mean? I am the
[1:42:41] message.
[1:42:43] Yes, sir. What is this all about? I am
[1:42:47] the reason. I am the one God came for.
[1:42:51] God has come and expressed himself to
[1:42:54] and through me.
[1:42:59] Therefore, I know his presence when he
[1:43:02] comes in because Amen. And when he comes
[1:43:05] in, I I want to make sure that I'm
[1:43:07] entertaining him. I want to make sure
[1:43:08] that he knows that I'm here. Well, can
[1:43:10] you say amen? Amen. So, it's not the
[1:43:13] atmosphere that makes the chicken. It's
[1:43:15] not his presence that does the job. It's
[1:43:18] not the presence of God, but I want him
[1:43:22] to know me.
[1:43:28] Brother Randomman said that hen can set
[1:43:30] on those eggs until she's poor.

[1:43:51] this
[1:43:53] morning." You're ministering to me,
[1:43:56] preacher, but my question is, why?
[1:44:00] Why do I have to press so hard?
[1:44:06] We can ask
[1:44:09] why why is it such a press? Yeah. Why?
[1:44:14] Why isn't it easy?
[1:44:17] Oh my. Are y'all with me? Yeah.
[1:44:21] It's because you're not in your original
[1:44:25] condition. Oh my. Come on. Yes. You're
[1:44:29] in this fleshly body.
[1:44:33] full of complexes and full of failures
[1:44:36] and full of flaws and
[1:44:41] well, praise the Lord. Preaching. You're
[1:44:44] literally going against your spirit
[1:44:46] mind. You're going against your
[1:44:47] reasoning. You're going against your
[1:44:49] emotions, your imaginations, your your
[1:44:51] your your pressing against mind battles.
[1:44:54] You're fighting your flesh. You're
[1:44:56] fighting your your your your aches and
[1:44:58] your pains. You're a man. You're
[1:45:00] fighting your tiredness. You're fighting
[1:45:02] these things. Amen. Because you are the
[1:45:06] product of the fall.
[1:45:08] Right. Yes.
[1:45:13] And I don't care how long you've had the
[1:45:15] Holy Ghost, you are still living in a
[1:45:18] fallen body.
[1:45:23] Come on. Yeah.
[1:45:25] Yeah.
[1:45:27] Would you turn to your neighbor and say,
[1:45:30] "You're living in a fallen body."
[1:45:34] Now, don't be don't be turning back
[1:45:36] around to your husband and say, "I
[1:45:39] know."
[1:45:41] [Applause]
[1:45:44] Hallelujah. You're
[1:45:46] living. So, the supernatural spirit. Am
[1:45:49] I too slow? Am I going too slow? The
[1:45:51] supernatural presence on the inside of
[1:45:53] you is
[1:45:55] longing. But this body, you're fighting
[1:45:58] the mind battles. You're fighting the
[1:46:00] complexes. You're fighting things.
[1:46:01] Right? You elders, how many of you
[1:46:03] elders can tell me that you fight that
[1:46:05] you that you fight complexes?
[1:46:12] If you elders fight complexes, what
[1:46:15] about us young men? Yeah.
[1:46:19] I'm still young.
[1:46:25] Come on. Come on. Okay. What about these
[1:46:29] young men?
[1:46:31] Yeah. Put you in there with it. Amen.
[1:46:34] You're not far behind me. I don't care
[1:46:36] if you do have full head of hair.
[1:46:43] We're in these bodies.
[1:46:46] And when you're born again, the spirit
[1:46:49] of life is on the inside of you, right?
[1:46:52] But the
[1:46:54] powers,
[1:46:56] man, I hit that thumb the other
[1:47:00] day about a month
[1:47:02] ago. And you can see all the layers of
[1:47:05] skin way down deep in there. How how how
[1:47:07] long it's taken to heal
[1:47:09] up. And I smashed that thing so
[1:47:13] hard. And it it reminded me that I'm not
[1:47:18] as supernatural as I
[1:47:20] think. I wasn't feeling like preaching a
[1:47:24] sermon.
[1:47:26] Hallelujah. But for y'all's information,
[1:47:28] I did say hallelujah. Amen.
[1:47:32] as I blood was squirting out everywhere
[1:47:34] and I mashed that thing all up and has
[1:47:37] had such a hard time healing up.
[1:47:41] Now we're in this fallen body. We're in
[1:47:45] this fallen
[1:47:47] flesh. You're fighting your flesh. But
[1:47:51] brother Brandham would say this.
[1:47:54] Aren't you glad for a prophet? Oh, thank
[1:47:57] you, sir.
[1:47:59] He tells you, you got to resist it
[1:48:02] because the powers of darkness are
[1:48:04] fighting you, friends. Yeah. Oh, come
[1:48:06] on. I know this is the most perfect
[1:48:07] church in Arkansas.
[1:48:10] But the devil's fighting you.
[1:48:14] All right. He's resisting you.
[1:48:18] He wants you to quit. Yeah. Come on. He
[1:48:21] wants you to turn around.
[1:48:23] He wants to destroy your gift. He wants
[1:48:27] to take you out.
[1:48:30] Somebody's got to resist him.
[1:48:36] Right.
[1:48:38] Satan has all those dark spirits of hell
[1:48:41] against you.
[1:48:44] And I'm telling you, there's a reason
[1:48:45] why he's fighting you so hard now.
[1:48:47] Because we are getting so
[1:48:49] close. We're getting so close.
[1:48:53] What if what if this is our last
[1:48:55] struggle? What if this is the last
[1:48:58] struggle into that other realm? Oh, come
[1:49:00] on, church. Brother Ren would say, he
[1:49:03] says, "Oh, it's easy to go the way the
[1:49:05] world goes. It's easy to go downstream,
[1:49:08] go out there, set in the river with your
[1:49:10] boat. You you you got your oes and start
[1:49:12] pulling up the current and you don't
[1:49:14] make much time. It goes hard. But you
[1:49:16] just let you just once let loose those
[1:49:18] oars and watch how fast you go past the
[1:49:20] trees going down. But look where you're
[1:49:22] going. And when the things are floating
[1:49:24] easy, remember you're going towards a
[1:49:26] great cataract down there of some sort.
[1:49:28] You're going towards the falls. And it
[1:49:30] won't be long and you'll be over the
[1:49:31] falls. Just floating with the world
[1:49:33] easy. The way it goes. You don't want
[1:49:35] that. No sir. You must accept your
[1:49:39] responsibility. Amen. If you you believe
[1:49:41] it. Amen. You think it's the truth. The
[1:49:44] responsibility that God has given us in
[1:49:47] this day to bring this message. And as
[1:49:50] they as I get older and I know my days
[1:49:52] are shortening up, I feel the
[1:49:54] responsibility greater than I have ever
[1:49:57] felt. Pressing on. We must do it.
[1:50:04] All right. Wonderful. Pressing on. We
[1:50:09] must do it.
[1:50:12] That's right.
[1:50:15] He says you must get down to it. And
[1:50:18] everywhere we go, can you say amen?
[1:50:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:25] This is your hour. Yeah. This is your
[1:50:29] hour. And the press is so important in
[1:50:32] this stage of the
[1:50:34] journey. There's no eaglet without a
[1:50:37] struggle.
[1:50:39] And that little eaglet's got to press.
[1:50:43] It's got to peck sir and peck and peck.
[1:50:48] and pack. Oh, come on now.
[1:50:52] Did I ever tell y'all about the
[1:50:53] butterfly that was in the cocoon that I
[1:50:55] was going to
[1:50:58] help? I'd seen this thing and it's in
[1:51:00] this it's in this cocoon and it's just I
[1:51:03] mean it's wiggling every which
[1:51:04] direction. I come back and I mean that
[1:51:06] thing is just it's straight. It's got
[1:51:07] his head stuck out, man. And I mean it's
[1:51:11] just that thing's just wiggling around
[1:51:12] everywhere. And I thought, well, man,
[1:51:15] bless. It's
[1:51:18] hard. So, I came back and I looked at it
[1:51:20] and the thing didn't hadn't even hardly
[1:51:22] budged and there it
[1:51:24] was process. I said, "All
[1:51:26] right." I went and got my knife, got it
[1:51:29] good and sharp, and I just started
[1:51:31] cutting the cocoon. I mean, I worked on
[1:51:34] that baby. I I'd done that without even
[1:51:38] touching the wings. And I got that thing
[1:51:39] out and this
[1:51:42] little
[1:51:44] thing called a
[1:51:47] butterfly was all wrinkled and I it and
[1:51:50] it so it fell there on on the
[1:51:55] table. And so I'm
[1:51:57] thinking
[1:52:02] fly and the thing is just all there
[1:52:05] and couldn't undo his wings. So I
[1:52:08] thought, my goodness, do I do everything
[1:52:09] for you? Trying to get his wings, trying
[1:52:12] to then I thought, well, maybe I need to
[1:52:15] get a little bit of air. Maybe he needs
[1:52:16] a little runway.
[1:52:22] So eventually the wings all come out.
[1:52:26] Did you know that that butterfly never
[1:52:27] did fly?
[1:52:29] Oh my.
[1:52:32] The
[1:52:33] butterfly never flew. Yeah.
[1:52:38] I took
[1:52:40] away the God-given
[1:52:43] resistance that was
[1:52:45] required to build
[1:52:48] muscle in the wings.
[1:52:52] The butterfly
[1:52:54] died without ever knowing what it was
[1:52:58] created to do. Oh my. Because this
[1:53:02] genius,
[1:53:04] come on. Well, praise the Lord.
[1:53:05] Sometimes you just wonder why the pastor
[1:53:08] ain't helping out because he's had too
[1:53:09] many butterflies that don't fly.
[1:53:12] And so the pastor wants to see
[1:53:16] flying butterflies.
[1:53:18] Can you say amen? And you're going
[1:53:21] through your struggles. You're going
[1:53:22] through your trials. You're going
[1:53:24] through those things that God and God
[1:53:26] has already put in you that
[1:53:30] predestinated purpose for the skies.
[1:53:34] He's put in you that predestinated seed
[1:53:37] for the skies.
[1:53:39] But you've got to go through the
[1:53:42] struggles.
[1:53:44] You've got to go through those lonely
[1:53:46] times. You've got to go through those
[1:53:48] times that you feel like all of the
[1:53:51] world has forgot about you. And but when
[1:53:55] you come out, you will know that the
[1:53:58] great Jehovah God is living on the
[1:54:01] inside of you.
[1:54:04] manifesting his grace through you and
[1:54:07] you're experiencing the supernatural.
[1:54:10] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:54:13] Can you say amen? Awesome.
[1:54:16] That's awesome. We I'm closing.
[1:54:20] I've really butchered my message up.
[1:54:24] Good, buddy. Very good. Come on.
[1:54:36] Only God
[1:54:37] knows the glory that's going to be
[1:54:39] revealed in you
[1:54:42] after the press. Yeah, that's right.
[1:54:46] Only God knows what he's looking for.
[1:54:49] And you might be wanting a certain thing
[1:54:51] and God's wanting a
[1:54:53] dong. You might be wanting this and
[1:54:56] God's saying, "No, that's not what I
[1:54:57] created you for. I've got a purpose for
[1:54:59] you.
[1:55:04] Come on. We wrestle against the
[1:55:06] principalities and the powers of the
[1:55:08] air. And there's none of us that are
[1:55:10] immune of them. There's none of us. I
[1:55:12] don't care whether you're a kid. And I
[1:55:14] and I I want you young people to know
[1:55:17] that sooner the better. Satan's fighting
[1:55:19] you. He's going to fight you. He gives
[1:55:21] you thoughts. He makes you It's crazy.
[1:55:23] And it's not just a bad thought. It's
[1:55:25] Satan's not a thought and God's not a
[1:55:27] thought. The devil's real, demons are
[1:55:30] real, and so is God and angels real. And
[1:55:34] the more that you learn to walk with
[1:55:37] God and and pray and come in contact
[1:55:41] with God, I remember as a 10, 11 year
[1:55:44] old, I'd be I' I'd be
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:48] amening my I had my own little prayer
[1:55:51] closet where I would go and pray and I
[1:55:54] would want and and and listen, I
[1:55:55] preached my first sermon when I was 12
[1:55:57] years old because I come in contact with
[1:56:00] God. I was I loved him. And I and I
[1:56:04] struggled. I There was so many struggles
[1:56:07] as a kid, but I was so I was I was so
[1:56:10] thankful that I could run to God and
[1:56:12] tell him. I was glad that I had a
[1:56:14] friend. Here I am going to be 55 years
[1:56:17] old. Amen. Here in in a month or two and
[1:56:20] amen. And here I am a blabbering crying
[1:56:25] fool this morning telling you that I
[1:56:28] need more of God.
[1:56:31] I need more of God today. I've been
[1:56:34] serving him now. Amen. For 50 years. But
[1:56:38] I need God.
[1:56:42] Oh yes, sir. Amen. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah.
[1:56:46] Yes, sir. That's man. Yes, sir.
[1:56:52] Now, did I ever tell y'all my duck
[1:56:54] story?
[1:56:58] You want to hear my duck story? Yeah.
[1:57:03] So, someone called me up and says,
[1:57:06] "Y'all want some ducks?" Duck eggs. I
[1:57:09] said, "Oh, yeah. I remember eating duck
[1:57:10] eggs when I was a kid. I Yeah, I will
[1:57:12] take those duck eggs." And they said,
[1:57:13] "They're
[1:57:14] fertile." And I said,
[1:57:19] "What? I am not
[1:57:26] eating." They say, "Oh, come on. It
[1:57:28] ain't going to hurt." I said, "I am not
[1:57:30] eating a duck."
[1:57:33] That's
[1:57:36] No. So then I then I got to thinking,
[1:57:39] "Wait a minute. I'm going to hatch me
[1:57:42] some
[1:57:44] ducks." So I said, "We'll take them."
[1:57:46] They said, "How many you want? Give us a
[1:57:49] dozen." So man, I go down there. I go I
[1:57:52] go I I go to Atwoods and I find me a
[1:57:55] nice I mean I got one of these incubator
[1:57:57] things and man it turns the eggs for you
[1:58:01] temperatures man you it's just it's just
[1:58:05] awesome. So I'm going in every day and

[1:58:15] love I love the adventure of my of my
[1:58:16] middle
[1:58:18] daughter-in-law. And um and so she was
[1:58:21] over there, boy. We'd be looking in the
[1:58:23] glass and seeing if there's any kind of
[1:58:25] movement and and stuff. It was only two
[1:58:27] days,
[1:58:30] but and so we were going and um so she
[1:58:34] was over there and man, she put water.
[1:58:36] You got got to keep it with water, the
[1:58:37] right kind of water for the humidity and
[1:58:39] all that. So, we're we're we're doing
[1:58:41] that and and um and making sure
[1:58:44] everything's I mean, we we we were on
[1:58:46] this and matters of fact she she was she
[1:58:48] was I I was I was out doing some
[1:58:50] preaching and and she was she she would
[1:58:53] take care of it and and uh so we had 27
[1:58:56] days I believe it was that was and then
[1:58:58] she calls me about and about 18 days and
[1:59:02] I'm in a meeting and I wanted to be home
[1:59:04] when my babies were
[1:59:07] born hatched.
[1:59:10] And
[1:59:11] so I get, she calls me, she says,
[1:59:14] "Brother Wendle," she said, "said, you
[1:59:15] ain't going to believe
[1:59:17] this, our ducks are hatching." And I
[1:59:20] said, "What?" She said, "Yes, it's only
[1:59:24] like 17 days." And and she she says,
[1:59:28] "There's there's there's movement
[1:59:30] around." and and and and there's just I
[1:59:33] mean they're just there's two eggs right
[1:59:35] now that they're just a peck at a peck
[1:59:36] that egg's just and I'm going oh and I
[1:59:39] already learned from a butterfly I said
[1:59:40] don't crack the egg let him do it
[1:59:44] himself and so man she's just over there
[1:59:48] and and so she's videoing and she's man
[1:59:50] she's just a that thing's just and I
[1:59:52] mean it goes it's going on for it's
[1:59:54] going on a long time finally it gets a
[1:59:56] little little little bitty little bitty
[1:59:59] hole in the egg and you you could see
[2:00:01] there's little beak stick
[2:00:04] out and
[2:00:06] uh then it goes back to so she sends me
[2:00:10] a picture and and and then I look at
[2:00:11] that picture she sees a picture of that
[2:00:13] beak sticking out that little beak and I
[2:00:15] said that don't look like a duck to
[2:00:25] me that thing just kept on and on and on
[2:00:29] and on And finally it cracked
[2:00:34] through. It was a
[2:00:38] chicken. It was a
[2:00:40] chicken. They were all
[2:00:43] chickens. We a message preacher hatching
[2:00:50] chickens. I said, "I all I just want you
[2:00:53] you get rid of those things before I get
[2:00:55] home." She says, "Brother Wendle," I
[2:00:57] said, "I don't want a chicken. I don't
[2:01:00] want to feed a chicken. I don't
[2:01:06] I So she gave the she gave him
[2:01:11] away. So
[2:01:13] then we went back and we told him, "You
[2:01:16] jipped us." First of all, we didn't know
[2:01:18] that an egg like that is a chicken. An
[2:01:22] egg like that is a duck. Okay, I know
[2:01:24] I'm country. I'm country, but I
[2:01:27] Hallelujah. Uh so I
[2:01:30] big eggs, ducks, little eggs, chickens.
[2:01:34] And so,
[2:01:39] uh, I I was
[2:01:41] watching and I got such an inspiration
[2:01:47] and I've got I I I showed the church and
[2:01:49] I don't have the pictures with
[2:01:51] me, but the
[2:01:57] pecking pecking. Yes, sir.
[2:02:01] And pecking.
[2:02:04] Now, there was no pecking at the
[2:02:05] beginning. There was there there was But
[2:02:07] as the time drew close,
[2:02:12] we didn't know exactly when it was going
[2:02:14] to happen, but we knew it had to be
[2:02:15] getting close within that within that
[2:02:18] 27 days. The it was it was getting
[2:02:22] close and we'd be watching and we'd have
[2:02:25] our cameras and and and the ducks would
[2:02:29] start pick
[2:02:32] and pecking. Come on. And pecking
[2:02:37] and struggling. I'm closing. Struggling
[2:02:40] and pecking and packing and
[2:02:43] packing. And it went on and on and on
[2:02:46] and on. And this one duck in
[2:02:49] particular. He finally got it through
[2:02:52] and he just kept on pecking. You'd watch
[2:02:54] this little head and you go, "Wam, wham,
[2:02:57] wham." And then he'd quit. Uhhuh.
[2:03:02] for minutes and he go
[2:03:06] wham. And then he
[2:03:10] quit and he was slowly making a
[2:03:14] crack.
[2:03:18] Wham. And he finally got it. He finally
[2:03:21] got it big
[2:03:23] enough. And he got his wing.
[2:03:27] He got his wing in that little
[2:03:30] hole and
[2:03:33] he got it on video.
[2:03:41] [Music]
[2:03:43] That's what you're doing.
[2:03:47] Come on, sir. We're so stinking close.
[2:03:50] Come on. All right. I'm not
[2:03:52] predestinated for this environment. I'm
[2:03:54] not predestinated to be in this shell.
[2:03:57] Come on. I'm predestinated to break out
[2:04:01] of this shell.
[2:04:03] I'm predestinated for eternity.
[2:04:09] I don't belong in this shell of
[2:04:11] complexes. I don't belong in this shell
[2:04:14] of defeat. I don't belong in this shell
[2:04:16] of
[2:04:17] discouragement. I don't belong here. I
[2:04:20] belong. I belong. I'm destined for
[2:04:24] another land. I'm destined for another
[2:04:27] place.
[2:04:29] [Applause]
[2:04:31] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[2:04:34] Jesus. True. Thank you, Lord. And
[2:04:41] sometimes, did y'all ever read that
[2:04:42] quote or hear that quote where Brother
[2:04:44] Brandham said? He said, "You're bumping
[2:04:46] into angels."
[2:04:48] He says, "What happens when your
[2:04:50] conscience gets moved in the church or
[2:04:52] when you're in prayer and all of a
[2:04:53] sudden," he says, "You just hit an
[2:04:55] angel. You're bumping into that other
[2:04:57] world. We're getting so close. We're b
[2:04:59] Oh, come on, church. Don't you
[2:05:03] quit. Don't you turn
[2:05:05] around. Keep on pressing, saints. Keep
[2:05:09] on pressing. This is our day.
[2:05:15] Thank you, Lord.

[2:05:42] feeling on the outside.
[2:05:46] It's never been there yet, but it knows
[2:05:49] it's there.
[2:05:51] It's never been there yet, but it
[2:05:53] feeling
[2:05:55] around. I I've never been there, but I
[2:05:58] there's a lot of heaven here on earth
[2:06:00] that's been letting me know that it's
[2:06:01] real. I've got my wing in another world.
[2:06:05] Oh, you know what that tells me? Don't
[2:06:06] quit pressing. Come on. Now, the most
[2:06:08] unique thing was is it finally kept on
[2:06:12] and it finally broke
[2:06:15] through. And you know
[2:06:18] what? Once it busted through, it's
[2:06:22] laying halfway out of the egg.
[2:06:26] Halfway in the egg.
[2:06:29] Come on.
[2:06:31] And it's as it looks like it's as dead
[2:06:34] as dead could be. Come on.
[2:06:38] Everyone's looking around and say, "Oh,
[2:06:40] poor duck. He's been doing this for days
[2:06:43] and now he's dead."
[2:06:45] Oh my.
[2:06:48] Come on. He's laying
[2:06:51] there. And we're looking through the
[2:06:53] glass darkly.
[2:07:00] Oh, come on, church.
[2:07:02] We don't know what we will be, but when
[2:07:04] we Oh, yeah.
[2:07:07] Come on. But when we see him,
[2:07:10] we're going to be like him. We're going
[2:07:12] to be like daddy.
[2:07:15] We've never seen him, sir. But we know
[2:07:17] we're destined for it. Oh, yeah. And
[2:07:20] we're sitting around there, didn't know
[2:07:21] whether to bury it or can't eat it.
[2:07:25] We're looking and all of a sudden the
[2:07:29] little wing
[2:07:33] flatters and it sits there for a
[2:07:36] while and we see his eye open
[2:07:40] up. He's tired.
[2:07:44] He's laying
[2:07:47] there. But after a while, he comes to
[2:07:49] his senses and
[2:07:50] he looks
[2:07:57] around. I made it.
[2:08:02] I've arrived.
[2:08:05] [Music]
[2:08:08] And before you know it, the old the old
[2:08:09] duck man, he's just a walking around
[2:08:11] everywhere, exploring around eating
[2:08:13] anything that he can eat.
[2:08:15] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:08:20] Wonder.
[2:08:22] Are we going to keep on pressing?
[2:08:25] Oh, yeah. Are we going to keep on
[2:08:26] pushing?
[2:08:28] Forgetting those things which are
[2:08:29] behind. That means there's going to be
[2:08:30] sins in your life that you got to get
[2:08:31] rid of. There's got to be a lot of
[2:08:32] combin complex you got to get rid of.
[2:08:33] There's got to be a lot of things, but
[2:08:35] it's going to be okay as long as you get
[2:08:36] to him. As long as you get to him,
[2:08:38] everything's going to be okay. It's
[2:08:40] going to be okay. Yes, sir.
[2:08:44] Come on. Yeah. Thank you, Lord. Because

[2:08:51] presence. Glory to God. Will forever
[2:08:53] more.
[2:08:54] Oh my. Hallelujah. I'm proud for you
[2:08:58] elders, but this ain't an old person's
[2:09:01] uh I ain't calling you old. I'm just
[2:09:02] saying you might be, but this is this is
[2:09:06] a this this is not an old person's

[2:09:41] Amen. The earnest expectation of the
[2:09:43] creature waitth for the manifestation of
[2:09:45] the sons of God. For I reckon that the
[2:09:47] sufferings of this present time shall
[2:09:49] not be compared, shall not compare with
[2:09:52] the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[2:09:54] Oh, thank you, Lord. For this creature
[2:09:58] was made subject to vanity, not
[2:09:59] willingly, but by reason of him who have
[2:10:02] subjected the same to hope. What a hope.
[2:10:06] because the creature
[2:10:08] itself also shall be delivered from the
[2:10:11] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[2:10:13] liberty of the children of God. For we
[2:10:15] know that the whole creation doth grown
[2:10:17] together until
[2:10:19] now. And not only they, but they, those
[2:10:23] of us who have the Holy Ghost, the first
[2:10:26] fruits of the spirit, we also grown
[2:10:31] within ourselves.
[2:10:34] Waiting for the adoption of these old
[2:10:35] bodies. Thank you. Waiting for the time.
[2:10:40] Waiting for the time
[2:10:43] that we'll lay everything down and we'll
[2:10:47] be with him. Thank you, Lord. Thank you
[2:10:49] for your patience this morning. Are you
