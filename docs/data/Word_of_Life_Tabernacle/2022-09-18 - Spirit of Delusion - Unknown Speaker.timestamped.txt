[42:01] the third chapter
[42:03] while we're all standing
[42:12] very familiar scripture here tonight and
[42:15] we'll read out of revelations and we'll
[42:17] read out a second thessalonians
[42:20] revelations the third chapter 14th verse
[42:23] and to the angel of the church of
[42:25] laodicea and write these things saith
[42:28] the amen
[42:29] the faithful and true witness
[42:32] the beginning of the creation of god i
[42:35] know thy works that thou art neither
[42:37] cold nor hot
[42:39] i would
[42:40] that thou work hold or hot so the lord's
[42:42] saying here i wish you'd be one way or
[42:44] the other is that right
[42:46] either serve me or don't but don't try
[42:48] to straddle the fence is that right
[42:50] and he said so then because thou art
[42:52] lukewarm neither cold nor hot i will
[42:55] spew thee out of my mouth
[42:57] because thou sayest i'm rich and
[42:59] increased with goods
[43:01] uh and have need of nothing and that's
[43:04] the world we live in today brothers and
[43:05] sisters that the the poorest american is
[43:09] rich
[43:10] compared to the rest of the world and
[43:11] and so we live in a day where people
[43:13] feel that they they don't need they
[43:15] don't need the lord they they got it on
[43:17] their own is that right
[43:18] and so noah's thou that our wretched
[43:20] measure excuse me need of nothing and
[43:22] know us not that thou art wretched and
[43:24] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[43:29] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[43:31] in fire that thou mayest be rich and
[43:33] white raiment that thou mayest be
[43:35] clothed and the shame of thy nakedness
[43:38] do not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[43:40] i said that thou mayest see as many as i
[43:43] love i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[43:46] therefore and repent
[43:49] amen and over in uh ii thessalonians
[43:57] the second chapter
[43:59] 2 thessalonians the second chapter and
[44:02] the 11th verse and for this calls god
[44:07] shall send them strong
[44:09] delusion everybody say delusion
[44:12] that they should believe a lie
[44:15] that they all might be damned who

[44:57] i ask oh god i pray that you'd bind my
[44:59] lips before i'd speak anything
[45:01] unpleasing to you and committed into
[45:03] your hands in the name of the lord jesus
[45:05] christ amen and amen god bless you you
[45:08] can be seated and
[45:10] while you're seated there we'll turn in
[45:12] ii timothy just for one more little
[45:14] portion of scripture and to look at i uh
[45:17] i appreciate uh the opportunity to come
[45:19] tonight
[45:20] uh i want to greet you uh from brother
[45:23] joseph hammond and the church at
[45:25] believer's tabernacle in murfreesboro uh
[45:27] he he wanted me to make sure that i uh
[45:29] greeted you and your pastor he sure
[45:31] thanks a lot brother ben and and uh
[45:35] i told him i would do that and so i have
[45:37] fulfilled my obligation
[45:40] uh
[45:40] i uh i i'm glad to have the honor to
[45:43] come and and this morning i i had
[45:46] i wanted to preach something else i'll
[45:47] just be honest with you
[45:49] and uh i had something else that i was
[45:51] wanting to try to come and bring tonight
[45:53] uh and you know as a minister
[45:57] you can't preach what you want to preach
[45:59] and uh you just gotta you gotta go the
[46:01] way that you can try and try and try you
[46:03] can't get anywhere if it's not what the
[46:05] lord wants you to do
[46:06] and so uh the the lord changed my uh
[46:10] heart on what i was wanting to preach on
[46:12] tonight and then this morning when
[46:14] brother ben got started i thought he's
[46:16] i'm going to have to change it again
[46:17] because he's going to preach all of what
[46:19] i was going to preach on tonight so
[46:21] but as it worked out i think this will
[46:24] go right along with what brother being
[46:26] preached this morning which certainly
[46:27] was a help to me i told him i said it's
[46:29] a little uncomfortable for me brother
[46:30] ben
[46:31] um
[46:32] at one point there when he got talking
[46:34] about your sweetheart and stuff i was
[46:35] just i just found myself just looking
[46:37] down straight at the floor like this
[46:39] and i didn't want to look i didn't want
[46:42] to look to my right because i felt like
[46:44] my wife would be
[46:46] piercing a hole in me
[46:48] and uh so
[46:50] a little uncomfortable you know
[46:53] but certainly enjoyed that message this
[46:55] morning
[46:56] and uh it's certainly needful i i have
[46:59] always felt like um
[47:02] that it it's our duty to to have a home
[47:05] brother brown said that your children
[47:06] want to come to
[47:08] and make it comfortable and make it nice
[47:10] for them and i i just appreciate that
[47:13] message so much and so
[47:15] uh i i want to title this tonight to
[47:17] spirit
[47:18] of delusion spirit of delusion and in
[47:21] second timothy the third chapter just a
[47:24] little bit further and i think uh
[47:26] brother ben was in the second chapter
[47:28] this morning thessalon uh timothy or
[47:31] thessalonians
[47:32] this know also that in the last days how
[47:35] many of you believe we're in the last
[47:36] days amen perilous times will come
[47:40] so the bible tells us in the last days
[47:42] it's going to get bad isn't it
[47:45] for men shall be lovers of their own
[47:48] selves and we live in the age of
[47:49] narcissism brothers and sisters we live
[47:52] in an age where people are self-consumed
[47:54] they're consumed with their own self
[47:56] they like taking selfies like it's a
[47:58] selfie mad world we want to take a
[48:00] picture of ourself right and and if you
[48:02] if you don't believe me just like hang a
[48:04] mirror up on the wall all right and
[48:06] watch how many people got to stop and
[48:08] look at themself in it right so it's the
[48:11] age of lovers of their own selves
[48:14] covetous meaning they they not only love
[48:16] their own self but they love what other
[48:18] people got too and they and they want
[48:20] what other people got and we're
[48:21] constantly comparing ourselves to other
[48:24] people
[48:25] and boasters proud blasphemers
[48:28] disobedient to parents and and saints it
[48:32] sickens me the way i hear children
[48:34] allowed to talk to their parents today
[48:37] it's it's it's it's a sickening thing
[48:39] and keep in mind brother ben preached on
[48:41] this morning that's not the child's
[48:42] fault that's the parent's fault
[48:44] but but i could never imagine talking to
[48:46] my parents the way i hear children
[48:49] talking to their parents today amen even
[48:52] in the message
[48:53] disobedient to parents unthankful we
[48:56] live in an unthankful
[48:58] uh nation where everybody's entitled
[49:00] everybody feels like they are owed
[49:02] something and it's just an unthankful
[49:04] unholy without natural affection meaning
[49:08] uh it's not brother ramsey it's just a
[49:09] natural affection not not like godly
[49:11] love not like that but like the natural
[49:13] affection that a mother should have for
[49:16] her child it's not there anymore that's
[49:18] why a woman can have a baby and throw it
[49:20] in a trash can it's the natural
[49:22] affection is gone amongst the people can
[49:24] you say amen
[49:26] and so it's uh
[49:28] natural affection
[49:30] um
[49:32] uh
[49:33] truce breakers false accusers now this
[49:36] is this false accusers is a interesting
[49:38] one because you know brother brown said
[49:40] you don't have to kill a man
[49:44] is that right you can kill his influence
[49:47] but amen by saying something about him
[49:48] it's not true
[49:50] and i've seen so many instances of that
[49:52] as i go church to church and i i go
[49:55] around all over the place now and you
[49:57] know you hear stuff and people say stuff
[49:59] about this church or that church and you
[50:01] know what i i've learned this i you
[50:02] really can't depend on anything but what
[50:04] you see for yourself
[50:07] because a lot of times when you hear
[50:08] stuff about churches here and there and
[50:10] you go and you find that's just not true
[50:12] or
[50:13] or maybe it was true but it ain't true
[50:16] no more
[50:17] because you know what by the grace of
[50:19] god we can change
[50:21] amen we can get better
[50:23] amen i don't want anybody to judge me
[50:25] for what i was 25 years ago
[50:28] amen
[50:31] despisers
[50:32] uh false accusers incontinent and the
[50:35] word incontinent means having no control
[50:37] over your own passions
[50:39] you can't control your own passions just
[50:40] whatever you want to do that goes you
[50:42] know just whatever
[50:43] and uh uh fierce despisers of those that
[50:46] are good saints make no mistake you are
[50:48] hated by this world
[50:50] you're hated by this world the the world
[50:52] hates what you stand for and the world
[50:55] hates your testimony is that right
[50:58] amen and traitors heavy high-minded
[51:00] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[51:03] god having a form of godliness but
[51:05] denying the power thereof from such turn
[51:08] away the bible said don't not entertain
[51:10] it turn away from it
[51:13] amen for this is the sword they are they
[51:16] which creep into houses lead captive
[51:18] silly women laden with sin led away with
[51:21] diverse lust ever learning and never
[51:24] able to come to the knowledge of the
[51:27] truth
[51:29] now if you'll skip on down a little bit
[51:30] that 14th verse says this though this is
[51:32] for you it says but continue thou in the
[51:36] things which thou hast learned
[51:39] and has been assured of
[51:41] knowing of whom thou hast
[51:44] learned them
[51:46] so the bible says while all this is
[51:48] going on in the world and while all
[51:50] these things are taking place in the
[51:51] world you just continue right on
[51:54] believing the message of the hour
[51:56] you just continue right on believing
[51:58] this gospel that we have today and know
[52:00] without a doubt that this gospel didn't
[52:02] come from man but it came from god can
[52:04] you say amen to that tonight
[52:06] just continue on knowing it's going to
[52:09] be all right saints continue on knowing
[52:12] everything's in god's hands
[52:16] and so i come across this thought
[52:18] because i i got to thinking about the
[52:20] other day that uh you realize saints
[52:22] that are children and i have a real love
[52:25] for the young people i i can't imagine
[52:27] what it's like to be a young person in
[52:29] this day and time
[52:31] it's so much more uh
[52:34] temptation and so much more access to
[52:36] the devil than it was when i was a child
[52:39] but i have a real feeling for our young
[52:40] people and i got to thinking about our
[52:42] young people and do you realize saints
[52:45] that our young people have never known a
[52:47] world that hadn't been totally insane
[52:53] if they're 25 year old or less all
[52:56] they've known has been this nuts of a
[52:58] world that we live in today
[53:00] amen
[53:01] it's never been a time i i remember i
[53:03] was in 1999 i gave uh my heart to the
[53:07] lord now i came it was probably february
[53:10] early march
[53:11] that uh the lord got to dealing with us
[53:14] and
[53:14] we we went to church now my my first
[53:16] church
[53:18] was walking into a two-car garage
[53:22] that was playing tapes
[53:24] and that was the only church that we had
[53:27] now i've never been to church a day in
[53:29] my life
[53:31] i i've never been to a baptist church
[53:32] i've never been to a methodist church
[53:34] the only church i've ever been to was
[53:35] walking into that garage and hearing a
[53:37] tape of the prophet
[53:39] now saints that should have appeared odd
[53:41] to me
[53:42] but i didn't know no better
[53:45] i didn't know what ever church didn't do
[53:46] i thought maybe every church did that i
[53:48] don't know i didn't know they probably
[53:50] you know most of them were in a garage
[53:54] but
[53:55] that was where i got my first experience
[53:57] with the lord was hearing the message of
[53:59] the hour and a couple weeks later i felt
[54:01] the need to be baptized and and you know
[54:03] it's something about a believer saints
[54:05] it's something about a christian
[54:06] whenever you hear the voice of god you
[54:08] want to line up with it hey something
[54:10] about a believer when you hear god's
[54:11] word it's in you to line up with it
[54:14] and so i just wanted to be baptized in
[54:17] christian baptism but we didn't have no
[54:18] baptistery because it was a two-car
[54:20] garage
[54:21] and and so we uh went to the lake in the
[54:24] middle of in the middle of march and it
[54:26] was snowing and it was ice on the lake
[54:29] and and the brothers busted up the ice
[54:31] and and i i i was just dumb enough to go
[54:34] down there and get baptized in that cold
[54:37] icy grave
[54:40] amen
[54:40] [Music]
[54:41] when you when the lord gets to deal with
[54:43] these things you just might as well do
[54:44] it
[54:45] amen so so i was baptized in this icy
[54:48] water and that was in march of 99 and
[54:51] when i come up out of the water by the
[54:53] grace of god my wife come right in
[54:55] behind me
[54:56] and she was baptized at the same time
[54:58] and brothers if you've got a wife that
[55:01] loves the lord you're blessed tonight
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] yes sir
[55:07] you're blessed
[55:09] and so we we come up out of the water we
[55:11] went and got into uh the van and was
[55:14] being carried back home and uh my wife's
[55:17] grandfather was driving and he was a he
[55:19] was a gracious old saint of god that had
[55:21] lived a message for 50 years and had the
[55:24] gift of wisdom and he told me he said
[55:25] brother george he said
[55:27] now look
[55:29] the the devil's going to be after you
[55:31] now
[55:33] and he said he's going to be after you
[55:36] because he had you
[55:38] but he ain't got you no more
[55:40] and he's going to be mad about it
[55:43] and saints i'll tell you he's been mad
[55:45] about it ever since
[55:47] he's been mad about it ever since he's
[55:49] done everything he can to take
[55:51] everything he can away from me
[55:54] amen is that your testimony tonight have
[55:56] you been fighting the devil ever since
[55:58] he ever since god got a hold of you
[56:00] you've been fighting the devil ever
[56:01] since
[56:03] yes
[56:04] amen
[56:06] it's a battle
[56:07] it's a battle
[56:08] but you know saints
[56:10] the devil can't do one thing to you
[56:13] until god allows him to do it so we got
[56:16] to bless him in the good times we bless
[56:19] the lord in the bad times we bless him
[56:21] in the in the high times we bless them
[56:24] in the low places we bless the lord
[56:28] because it's all ordered of him amen we
[56:30] praise him when it's going good we
[56:32] praise him when it's going bad we praise
[56:34] the lord
[56:36] amen
[56:37] and so that was in march of 99 and and
[56:41] and then right shortly thereafter some
[56:43] of you young people won't know what i'm
[56:44] talking about here but right shortly
[56:46] thereafter came y2k
[56:51] y'all remember y2k
[56:53] y2k was going to be the end of us all
[56:56] brother ben it was for those of you that
[56:58] don't remember y2k that was when we was
[57:00] in 1999
[57:03] and and the calendar was going to go
[57:05] turn over to 2000.
[57:07] and and the thing was they said the
[57:08] computers of that day wouldn't be able
[57:11] to turn over to 2000. so the word on the
[57:13] street was that the missiles all the
[57:16] nuclear missiles was going to blow up
[57:21] all the electrical uh
[57:22] electric grids was going to go offline
[57:24] we going to have no power and we was
[57:26] going out into chaos
[57:28] and so that was in 99 going into 2000
[57:31] and so i had to give my heart to the
[57:32] lord in march and i said well praise god
[57:35] he saved me just in time
[57:38] amen oh i came to the lord just in time
[57:41] i want to make it
[57:43] amen
[57:44] amen you know what if the lord ain't
[57:46] gonna come till the last one makes it in
[57:48] is that right
[57:49] amen so i said well praise god he saved
[57:51] me just in time and so so 19 and 99 uh
[57:55] going into 2000 we had a watch night
[57:57] service y'all know what a watch tonight
[57:59] services so so it was new year's eve and
[58:02] we had a watch night service and since
[58:04] there was people that showed up to
[58:05] church we got a church building in the
[58:07] meantime i forgot to tell you that
[58:09] we got a real church building not a
[58:11] two-car garage and i i started preaching
[58:13] about that time so i've been in a
[58:15] message about six months started
[58:16] preaching and so uh uh so we was having
[58:19] a watch night service and people showed
[58:22] up to church that night that i'd never
[58:25] seen in church before
[58:28] because they was sure that the end was
[58:30] coming everybody knew the end was coming
[58:32] you know they stayed in church until
[58:34] 1201 that night and they got up and left
[58:39] and i ain't never seen them since
[58:45] amen
[58:46] y2k but from that time on brothers and
[58:49] sisters
[58:50] it has been one
[58:52] battle of chaos right after another and
[58:55] our young people have been coming into
[58:56] this world uh into this they don't know
[58:59] what normal is
[59:01] they have no idea what normal is because
[59:02] it's always been upside down and these
[59:05] birth pains keep getting closer and
[59:07] closer together
[59:09] and we went right out of y2k into 911
[59:12] and 911 changed everything
[59:15] not everybody in here probably remembers
[59:17] where you were at
[59:19] when you first heard
[59:21] about the towers
[59:23] is that right
[59:25] and you know people started calling me
[59:26] sinners started calling me they knew
[59:28] that it was the end
[59:31] a lot of people got real religious real
[59:33] fast brother ben
[59:35] they got real religious they realized
[59:37] they wasn't ready and they thought the
[59:38] end was coming
[59:42] now when the next day come around and we
[59:43] were still here
[59:45] they went right on back to there
[59:49] and it's been war after war it's been
[59:52] war after war you know right after 9 11
[59:54] we got into we got into a desert storm
[59:57] and then right over that afghanistan and
[59:59] then you know now all the stuff
[1:00:01] happening in the in russia taken into
[1:00:03] the ukraine and i was surprised by how
[1:00:06] many people in the message got pretty
[1:00:07] upset when russia moved into the ukraine
[1:00:10] and and a lot of quotes started flying
[1:00:12] around a lot a lot of people started
[1:00:14] flying quotes around here and there but
[1:00:16] brothers and sisters you don't have to
[1:00:18] worry about all this
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:22] you believe the message of the hour the
[1:00:24] believe the message of the hour will get
[1:00:26] us home
[1:00:27] amen
[1:00:28] and so we find it the war after war and
[1:00:31] into you know here recently or over the
[1:00:34] past few years you've seen racial
[1:00:36] tensions and social tensions and
[1:00:38] political tensions and
[1:00:41] and you've seen war
[1:00:43] and you know
[1:00:45] people get all upset about politics and
[1:00:48] tell everything that biden's doing or
[1:00:50] whatever i do kind of miss trump brother
[1:00:52] ben he he was a barrel of monkeys i i i
[1:00:56] it was always good for a laugh but
[1:00:57] anyways
[1:01:00] then the coved happened
[1:01:03] and when coved hit that first little bit
[1:01:06] when covet hit if you will remember
[1:01:08] everybody lost their whole mind
[1:01:13] they lost their whole mind
[1:01:16] and some said it was going to kill us
[1:01:18] all
[1:01:20] and then some said
[1:01:21] that it wasn't even real they said it
[1:01:24] was all made up coveted wasn't even real
[1:01:26] but it felt real when i had it
[1:01:29] seemed pretty real
[1:01:31] when i had it
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:33] and some said
[1:01:36] some said that the bride wasn't gonna
[1:01:38] get it
[1:01:41] if his bride you weren't gonna get it
[1:01:45] now they said that right up until they
[1:01:46] got it
[1:01:50] and then they had to change their
[1:01:51] doctrine
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:54] but they said the bride wasn't going to
[1:01:55] get it
[1:01:56] and it was easy to say that long as it
[1:01:58] wasn't in your neighborhood or it wasn't
[1:02:00] in your town it wasn't in your church
[1:02:02] amen but when it comes close to you then
[1:02:05] you know you lose some of your ability
[1:02:06] to boast
[1:02:07] and and people lost a lot of their mind
[1:02:10] when kova had happened saints but i i
[1:02:12] want you to notice this covey
[1:02:14] do you realize how much rights and
[1:02:17] freedom we lost the weak coved moved
[1:02:20] into the united states
[1:02:22] do you realize that that was just a
[1:02:25] trial run of the devil to see how much
[1:02:27] rights the american people were going to
[1:02:30] relinquish willingly
[1:02:32] by propaganda is that right
[1:02:35] [Music]
[1:02:36] see it was all just misinformation
[1:02:39] people get on facebook and see something
[1:02:41] somebody posted and and and it run like
[1:02:44] wildfire you know
[1:02:46] and and people were just repeating other
[1:02:48] people's ignorance
[1:02:54] you know some said the mask were the
[1:02:56] answer some said the mask would kill you
[1:02:58] some said the vaccinations were the
[1:03:00] answer some said the vaccinations will
[1:03:02] kill you
[1:03:04] and everybody was trying to get on one
[1:03:06] side of it or the other
[1:03:08] amen
[1:03:11] and we lost a lot of rights we let the
[1:03:13] government come in and they dictated in
[1:03:15] one week's time they they dictated where
[1:03:17] we could eat
[1:03:18] they dictated where we could work
[1:03:21] they dictated if we could leave the
[1:03:22] country or not
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:27] they even dictated whether you could
[1:03:29] operate your business or not
[1:03:31] they dictated whether whether it was
[1:03:33] whether your business was essential or
[1:03:35] not
[1:03:36] is that right
[1:03:38] just a just a little trial run of the
[1:03:40] devil
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:44] my dad was dying in the hospital at the
[1:03:47] time and i couldn't get in to see him
[1:03:50] now a lot of people had people like that
[1:03:53] he was dying in the hospital and
[1:03:54] couldn't get in to see him
[1:03:56] because of everything going on
[1:03:59] and uh
[1:04:02] we find this saints brother brown says
[1:04:04] this it's a pressure
[1:04:06] it's a pressure
[1:04:07] that's on the world today
[1:04:09] and everywhere you go you feel this
[1:04:12] pressure
[1:04:14] if you go to walmart you feel the
[1:04:16] pressure
[1:04:17] if you go to work you feel the pressure
[1:04:20] to brother ben's point this morning in
[1:04:22] your homes there's a pressure
[1:04:25] there's a pressure
[1:04:26] on the land today and it's going to
[1:04:29] reach a breaking point
[1:04:32] brother braham says this he says the
[1:04:34] world is just built upon pressure
[1:04:36] it's going to blow up one of these days
[1:04:39] the world built full of pressure and the
[1:04:41] doctors don't even know what to do about
[1:04:43] it the psychiatrist has got
[1:04:45] psychiatrists
[1:04:47] doctoring them that's right they don't
[1:04:48] have the answer but god does
[1:04:52] but god does god has the answer to all
[1:04:55] of this he said
[1:04:57] amen so what's the answer tonight
[1:05:02] you know the world is built upon
[1:05:04] pressure everything is going at a
[1:05:06] breakneck speed and they don't know
[1:05:07] where they're going they go down the
[1:05:09] road 90 miles an hour to stop in a
[1:05:11] tavern and drink two hours let me stop
[1:05:13] right here and say this uh i i got this
[1:05:15] car and it's got a speed uh
[1:05:19] limit
[1:05:20] bail on it
[1:05:23] that if if you set it
[1:05:26] it'll ding every time you get above
[1:05:27] that's a speed warning
[1:05:29] and uh so i had it set at 80.
[1:05:33] and i found out quick that's going to
[1:05:35] worry me to death
[1:05:39] at 80.
[1:05:41] so i said well
[1:05:43] i'm going to move it to 90. that way i
[1:05:45] won't have to worry about it
[1:05:49] and uh you can ask
[1:05:50] sister brandy how many times that thing
[1:05:52] goes off
[1:05:54] uh so i got it turned clean off now
[1:06:03] because it just drive too fast
[1:06:05] and uh
[1:06:06] i'm working on y'all pray for me
[1:06:09] the closer i get to the house the faster
[1:06:11] my car goes
[1:06:15] 90 miles an hour he said to stop in a
[1:06:17] tabern and drink two hours before they
[1:06:19] get home it just seems to be such a
[1:06:21] pressure everybody irritable pushing and
[1:06:24] shoving and i just wonder
[1:06:26] what the cure is
[1:06:28] again he says man is trying to find
[1:06:31] something to satisfy and he thirsts and
[1:06:34] god made him to thirst that that he was
[1:06:36] built up that way but god built him that
[1:06:38] way so he'd thirst after him but he
[1:06:40] tries to satisfy it and hush that holy
[1:06:43] call in him with the things of the world
[1:06:46] and we have no right to do that now but
[1:06:49] people do wrong constantly instead of
[1:06:51] going to the place to get rid of the
[1:06:53] cause we try to hush it with anesthetics
[1:06:56] anesthesia and liquor and smoking and
[1:06:59] putting more to it heaping it up all the
[1:07:01] time making it worse and all this only
[1:07:04] builds up pressure it just makes it
[1:07:07] worse
[1:07:08] all the time
[1:07:10] so all the doctrine and everything
[1:07:12] they're trying to do all it's doing is
[1:07:13] making it worse
[1:07:15] amen the more prescriptions they give
[1:07:16] out the worse it's going to get the the
[1:07:19] more things we try to do to artificially
[1:07:21] fix the cause the worse it's going to
[1:07:23] get
[1:07:24] but he said the only answer is jesus
[1:07:27] christ
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:32] and brother branham says that you're not
[1:07:34] in your right mind without the baptism
[1:07:37] of the holy ghost
[1:07:39] amen the answer is the holy ghost amen
[1:07:43] and we live in a world
[1:07:46] of delusion
[1:07:49] a a place of delusion
[1:07:51] a a country of delusion
[1:07:54] we live in a world brothers and sisters
[1:07:57] that feels like you can choose
[1:07:59] whether you're male or female or not
[1:08:04] whether you're male or female
[1:08:07] say it's this it's biology it's not
[1:08:10] psychology
[1:08:11] amen you're either male or female right
[1:08:14] you're either one or the other
[1:08:16] is that right
[1:08:18] it's not psychology it's not in your
[1:08:19] mind
[1:08:20] it's it's biology it's anatomy
[1:08:23] is that right
[1:08:25] and so you know we live in a world that
[1:08:27] thinks you can decide those kind of
[1:08:29] things and then look i'm not talking
[1:08:31] about the people this ain't people this
[1:08:33] is spirits
[1:08:35] i'm not looking down on anybody i i mean
[1:08:37] we deal with people all the time that
[1:08:39] that have got they got a lot going on
[1:08:41] they got a lot going on it's the spirit
[1:08:43] on the people
[1:08:45] amen but you know the god is concerned
[1:08:48] about those people and he's concerned
[1:08:50] with their soul and so if he's concerned
[1:08:53] with their soul then it's our place to
[1:08:55] be concerned with their soul as well
[1:08:58] amen not to look down on them not to
[1:09:00] treat them treat them poorly or or call
[1:09:02] them names or anything like that but to
[1:09:04] try to do something to help
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:08] so i'm not talking about people it's a
[1:09:10] spirit that we're fighting against
[1:09:12] but we should we should never be
[1:09:14] confused about
[1:09:16] whether we're male or female
[1:09:18] amen amen how many of you lived on a
[1:09:22] farm
[1:09:23] grew up on a farm
[1:09:25] how many of you've ever had puppies
[1:09:27] kittens
[1:09:29] right
[1:09:30] y'all know how to tell
[1:09:32] if a puppy is a male or a female
[1:09:37] is that right
[1:09:41] you just check it's one or the other
[1:09:45] amen you don't give them a psychiatric
[1:09:47] evaluation
[1:09:50] they're right
[1:09:51] it's biology it's not psychology
[1:09:56] now is this right or wrong saints
[1:09:59] and so now the new level of that's come
[1:10:02] in on that is called non-binary
[1:10:05] and and if you don't know about
[1:10:06] non-binaries where now they can't decide
[1:10:08] if they're male or female so they say
[1:10:10] they're both
[1:10:12] and and they don't want to be called him
[1:10:14] or her they won't be called they or them
[1:10:18] well look you don't get to choose your
[1:10:19] own pronouns saints
[1:10:21] amen the english language dictates the
[1:10:23] pronoun
[1:10:24] if it's one it's a him or her if it's
[1:10:27] two it's that they are them
[1:10:29] right
[1:10:30] but but they want to be called they are
[1:10:32] them why because they say one day they
[1:10:34] get up and they decide that they are a
[1:10:36] man but the next day they may get up and
[1:10:38] decide that they are a woman you
[1:10:40] understand saints this is
[1:10:42] this is strong delusion
[1:10:45] on the people strong delusion prophesied
[1:10:49] to come
[1:10:50] prophesied to come to pass and that's
[1:10:52] the day and the time that we're living
[1:10:53] in
[1:10:55] strong delusion on the people there's a
[1:10:57] strong delusion that would cause
[1:10:59] somebody to not be able to decide if
[1:11:01] they're a man or woman or not it's
[1:11:03] pretty easy
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:07] that's not a big hard decision
[1:11:10] and so we we find then that this is not
[1:11:13] uh you know you got children that that
[1:11:16] even in it back home and it's probably
[1:11:18] over here too but back back home but
[1:11:20] close to nashville we've got schools
[1:11:22] that are dealing with children that have
[1:11:24] not they've decided that they're no
[1:11:26] longer a boy or a girl but they're a dog
[1:11:28] or a cat
[1:11:30] or or an elf or something like that and
[1:11:32] if they decide their dog they're going
[1:11:34] into the school and they bark at
[1:11:36] everybody and use the bathroom in the
[1:11:37] floor
[1:11:40] now this is not
[1:11:43] juvenile delinquency
[1:11:45] this is parent delinquency
[1:11:48] if you have a 10 year old boy if i was a
[1:11:51] 10 year old boy i'd like to seen the
[1:11:53] conversation that i'd had to have with
[1:11:55] my dad to convince him that i was a dog
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:02] this is parents saying well okay
[1:12:04] sweetheart right
[1:12:06] that's not the kind of home
[1:12:09] that kids need to go back home to
[1:12:11] amen real love is corrective we know
[1:12:13] that amen if you love them you correct
[1:12:15] them
[1:12:16] is that right
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:20] and you know the the thing is as people
[1:12:22] that we have the right to decide what we
[1:12:24] are and and all those things and i i
[1:12:26] guess if you wanted to do that that's
[1:12:28] fine but you can't ask me to go along
[1:12:30] with your lie for you
[1:12:32] amen if brother joel decides today that
[1:12:35] he's a monkey
[1:12:38] i'll still love him
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:42] but i'm not feeding him bananas
[1:12:52] i'm not going along with that lie
[1:12:55] amen if brother i'm plainly going to
[1:12:57] call him a him
[1:12:59] i'm not going to call him a her
[1:13:01] because he's not a her i'm not going
[1:13:03] along with the lies saints amen but this
[1:13:06] spirit of strong delusion in the nation
[1:13:08] would try to make you think that the
[1:13:11] right thing to do is call somebody
[1:13:12] whatever they want to be called
[1:13:15] amen but right is right amen truth is
[1:13:19] truth
[1:13:20] amen and there ain't no truth left today
[1:13:23] but in this message
[1:13:25] amen
[1:13:28] and the bible said they believe a lie
[1:13:30] and be damned by it
[1:13:32] and he said it it's a reprobate now that
[1:13:34] word reprobate means corrupt
[1:13:37] it's corrupt minds concerning the truth
[1:13:41] and we also have to be uh
[1:13:44] wise to the fact
[1:13:47] that our brains
[1:13:50] our brains
[1:13:52] are gone
[1:13:55] not our mind not not our mind our mind
[1:13:57] the people's minds are gone that's true
[1:13:59] but not just their mind but their
[1:14:01] literal brain
[1:14:03] is gone y'all want to hear that
[1:14:05] brother brown says this the whole human
[1:14:06] race is rotten
[1:14:08] well if them physical beings of our body
[1:14:10] is tearing down like that from eating
[1:14:12] hybrid foods tensions that rot it does
[1:14:15] not that also rot the brain cell
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] the brain cell
[1:14:22] that we
[1:14:23] that we can see how women can get on the
[1:14:26] street naked we can see how they can
[1:14:29] speed through the streets at 120 miles
[1:14:31] an hour now look i hadn't done that bad
[1:14:35] i ain't done that bad
[1:14:40] but i did make that 90 dinger go off a
[1:14:42] few times
[1:14:43] uh 120 miles an hour all these things it
[1:14:46] comes to a place to where the whole
[1:14:48] nation the whole world not only this
[1:14:49] nation but everywhere mentally gone
[1:14:52] why because of marines and saints that
[1:14:54] includes message believers
[1:14:57] message believers are also eating hybrid
[1:15:00] foods message believers bodies are also
[1:15:04] breaking down and if the bodies are
[1:15:06] breaking down if our bodies are turned
[1:15:08] into mush our brains are as well things
[1:15:10] i'll tell you you can't trust your own
[1:15:12] brain
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:21] visible union of the bride brother brown
[1:15:22] says the whole world proves it's insane
[1:15:25] look at the murders and things that's
[1:15:27] going on now see insane in the world see
[1:15:29] insanity the whole thing is coming to
[1:15:31] fulfill revelations
[1:15:34] we may get to it this week where those
[1:15:36] hideous things them is not natural them
[1:15:38] spiritual things that makes people
[1:15:40] scream for the rocks and the mountains
[1:15:42] and everything else to fall on them
[1:15:46] the complete total insanity this world
[1:15:48] will go into right away it's almost
[1:15:50] there now
[1:15:52] why you see the footsteps of it there it
[1:15:55] is it's marching right out on the street
[1:15:57] right down the church pew
[1:16:00] it's marching right down the street
[1:16:02] right down to the church
[1:16:04] pew
[1:16:06] is that what he said
[1:16:07] total insanity do things that a human
[1:16:10] being wouldn't think of doing and be
[1:16:12] civilized look
[1:16:14] what hollywood has done to the women
[1:16:17] to the woman look how it is it's robbed
[1:16:20] the sacred virtues of the woman
[1:16:23] and on and on we could go
[1:16:27] so brother abraham said this the world
[1:16:29] is rolling out into insanity it's
[1:16:31] supposed to according to revelations he
[1:16:32] says and he says that it's it's coming
[1:16:35] it's going to get worse
[1:16:37] amen there's more to come it's going to
[1:16:39] keep getting worse
[1:16:41] and he says that we're marching right
[1:16:43] out of the street right down to the
[1:16:45] church pew
[1:16:46] so it's in the churches as well
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:51] and he says look what hollywood has done
[1:16:53] to the woman
[1:16:55] and so i i want you to notice where all
[1:16:57] this delusion
[1:16:59] comes from now brother branham says that
[1:17:01] eighty percent of it
[1:17:03] come from hollywood
[1:17:06] did y'all know that
[1:17:07] bill graham said 80 of this delusion
[1:17:10] comes from hollywood
[1:17:12] all right
[1:17:12] and he says then uh he said notice he
[1:17:16] couldn't get in here through the
[1:17:17] ministry
[1:17:19] satan he's talking about satan couldn't
[1:17:21] get in here through the ministry so the
[1:17:22] thing he done was come into hollywood
[1:17:25] out there
[1:17:26] and he set up holly he set up his
[1:17:28] headquarters over in hollywood the devil
[1:17:30] landed back there a few years ago 15 or
[1:17:32] 20 years ago with his great army and
[1:17:34] went hit in hollywood california and he
[1:17:37] has invaded the united states with his
[1:17:40] demon powers
[1:17:42] right all of our fashions come from
[1:17:44] paris they get it in hollywood onto the
[1:17:46] screens these little girls and boys and
[1:17:49] things get out there and they watch them
[1:17:51] screenplays so brother brahms said satan
[1:17:54] came in and set up his headquarters in
[1:17:57] hollywood and he from there invaded the
[1:18:00] united states with his demon powers
[1:18:03] is that what he said
[1:18:05] he said eighty percent of it now look
[1:18:07] you might differ with that say oh he was
[1:18:09] just doing it for effect i'm just going
[1:18:10] to try to believe what he's saying
[1:18:13] and if he said it's 80 i believe it's
[1:18:14] 80.
[1:18:16] and so we understand then that hollywood
[1:18:19] controls now the trends of this world
[1:18:22] hollywood controls the fashions of this
[1:18:25] world if holly the more hollywood takes
[1:18:28] off the more the women take off
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] the more hollywood men dress like women
[1:18:35] the more worldly men dress like women
[1:18:38] amen whatever the trend is in hollywood
[1:18:40] that's the trend in the world today
[1:18:43] amen they set the popular culture of the
[1:18:46] world so they they set the morals of the
[1:18:48] world or the lack thereof and
[1:18:50] hollywood has gone about methodically
[1:18:53] desensitizing the world to sin
[1:18:57] amen
[1:18:58] it's it starts out real easy just like
[1:19:01] with the music brother brown started out
[1:19:03] with rolling girl rolling girl is
[1:19:04] rolling is that right and then it moves
[1:19:07] on into this other worldly music that we
[1:19:10] have today it starts out real easy and
[1:19:12] it gets progressively worse over time
[1:19:14] and hollywood started out really easy
[1:19:16] and it's gotten progressively more and
[1:19:19] more sinful over time
[1:19:21] and it's desensitized
[1:19:23] the world to sin
[1:19:27] amen no matter what they see in front of
[1:19:30] them they see something worse on
[1:19:32] hollywood screen somewhere
[1:19:34] is that right
[1:19:36] and so even in the message
[1:19:39] even in the message there used to be a
[1:19:41] time where something would come on and
[1:19:43] something be said and people turn it off
[1:19:46] oh and they apologize to the family i'm
[1:19:49] sorry i didn't know that was in there
[1:19:51] like that
[1:19:52] and then as we go along we just keep on
[1:19:55] letting it go letting it go and then we
[1:19:57] just let it play
[1:20:01] all right
[1:20:03] desensitized to it what's the most
[1:20:05] popular baby names every year if you
[1:20:08] look up the most popular baby names
[1:20:09] every year in the united states you'll
[1:20:11] find that it's the most popular movie
[1:20:13] stars of that year
[1:20:16] they name their children after them
[1:20:20] amen
[1:20:22] brother braham says you get under the
[1:20:23] blood of jesus christ
[1:20:25] it's a disgrace how that all such things
[1:20:27] as we have in our world is in the
[1:20:30] condition today 80 percent of it come
[1:20:32] right out of hollywood
[1:20:33] and yet that's the example of the world
[1:20:36] that's where the pace is set for the
[1:20:38] modern world is out of hollywood he said
[1:20:43] is that right
[1:20:44] amen now before we get too far out on a
[1:20:48] limb here
[1:20:49] i don't think i sent this to you
[1:20:50] brothers
[1:20:51] but before we get too far out on a limb
[1:20:53] here
[1:20:54] brother branham said that everything
[1:20:56] that come out of hollywood wasn't bad
[1:20:59] yeah
[1:21:01] that's right that's going to make some
[1:21:03] people mad
[1:21:04] but that's what he said
[1:21:06] he said everything come out of hollywood
[1:21:07] well man i'm going to read it to you
[1:21:08] here he said now i don't say everything
[1:21:12] in hollywood is polluted
[1:21:14] i had some men at my house here not long
[1:21:16] ago
[1:21:18] uh the westminster film company who made
[1:21:20] come up here and made a picture ask
[1:21:23] uh me permit if they could do it and
[1:21:26] come to the meetings and they put it on
[1:21:28] the screen called the 20th century
[1:21:30] prophet
[1:21:32] you know the 20th century prophet come
[1:21:34] out of hollywood
[1:21:37] i didn't tell i read this
[1:21:40] and he says and they're going into
[1:21:43] palestine to set up a meeting over there
[1:21:45] and those fellows that i met in is a
[1:21:48] group that made this picture samson and
[1:21:50] delilah and so forth and they
[1:21:53] were uh and they were every one first
[1:21:56] thing they did when they walked in
[1:21:57] before they asked me a question they
[1:21:59] said can we kneel and have prayer
[1:22:02] a group of gentlemen he said
[1:22:07] so brothers and sisters it matters how
[1:22:10] we use things
[1:22:13] it matters
[1:22:14] what we use things for
[1:22:16] is that right
[1:22:17] that's why gun control is never going to
[1:22:19] work
[1:22:20] amen because the gun ain't what's
[1:22:22] killing everybody
[1:22:23] amen
[1:22:24] it's the person pulling the trigger
[1:22:25] that's killing everybody is that right
[1:22:28] and you know it's like you the the
[1:22:29] brother brown said this he said he he he
[1:22:32] moved on in there and he uh he he used
[1:22:35] to be wrong he said for people to go to
[1:22:37] the picture show he said but he he got
[1:22:39] one step ahead of you and he put it
[1:22:41] right in your home and you know in this
[1:22:43] day and time he he's gotten another step
[1:22:45] ahead he's put it right in your hand
[1:22:48] is that right
[1:22:50] put it right in your hand but it matters
[1:22:52] what you use it you got that phone in
[1:22:54] your hand brothers and sisters the same
[1:22:56] phone that i can use to read my bible on
[1:23:00] is the same phone that i can look at
[1:23:01] phil phone
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:05] the same phone that i can call somebody
[1:23:07] to pray for them is the same phone that
[1:23:10] i can call somebody to gossip about
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:16] the same phone that i can listen to the
[1:23:18] message on is the same one that i can
[1:23:20] listen to worldly music on
[1:23:23] amen so it matters how you use something
[1:23:27] amen
[1:23:29] so you know there's a big debate about
[1:23:31] tvs and stuff you know i know a lot of
[1:23:33] message believers that's got tvs where
[1:23:35] the buttons wore off of them where they
[1:23:37] roll them in and out of the closet when
[1:23:38] company's coming over
[1:23:42] got a million miles on that tv
[1:23:51] now i don't care if you got one or you
[1:23:52] don't
[1:23:54] but you got to trust the holy ghost tell
[1:23:55] you how to use it
[1:23:57] hey so there's a lot of people in the
[1:23:58] message now today we ain't got tvs
[1:24:01] but we got a laptop
[1:24:05] we got a phone we don't watch a tv when
[1:24:07] you watch it on the laptop see that's
[1:24:09] legalism saints amen that's that's
[1:24:12] that's legalism if it's right to watch
[1:24:14] or or if it's if it's wrong to watch it
[1:24:16] on tv it's wrong to watch your laptop
[1:24:20] amen it's legalism
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:26] amen
[1:24:27] i mean saints that's a tv right there
[1:24:31] hey man
[1:24:32] this tv right there how do we use it
[1:24:39] this all right tonight
[1:24:47] wear the buttons off of it
[1:24:50] roll it in the closet when company's
[1:24:51] coming over
[1:24:57] the other thing hollywood controls
[1:25:00] is social media
[1:25:02] oh yeah
[1:25:03] see
[1:25:04] see whatever the whatever the hollywood
[1:25:06] elite do on social media
[1:25:09] that's what everybody else does
[1:25:12] so so if you let one of them
[1:25:14] knuckleheads eat a tide pod then the
[1:25:16] whole nation is going to start eating
[1:25:18] tide pods
[1:25:19] amen or whatever the next challenge is
[1:25:22] on social media saints don't ever let a
[1:25:24] challenge influence you when when you
[1:25:27] obey a challenge then that lets the
[1:25:29] person that issued the challenge have
[1:25:31] dominion over you
[1:25:33] amen
[1:25:34] in order for me to accept the challenge
[1:25:35] i'd have to care what you thought
[1:25:38] amen and i don't care what the world
[1:25:41] thinks
[1:25:42] amen uh you can challenge me all day
[1:25:44] long it'll make me no difference
[1:25:46] amen because i don't care what the world
[1:25:48] thinks
[1:25:50] now is that
[1:25:52] right so hollywood controls social media
[1:25:56] but hollywood is not real neither is
[1:25:59] social media
[1:26:00] social media is not real life
[1:26:03] it's not real life
[1:26:05] first off those people don't look like
[1:26:07] that
[1:26:08] they don't look like that
[1:26:11] if you saw them in real life you'd say
[1:26:13] oh god
[1:26:15] they look terrible
[1:26:17] but if you put them in the right light
[1:26:19] and you put the right makeup on them and
[1:26:21] you put the right filters on them then
[1:26:23] they look all right
[1:26:25] but that's not a realistic expectation
[1:26:28] amen it's like reading a love story
[1:26:31] that ain't real life
[1:26:33] amen everybody looks at all these
[1:26:35] romantical movies and stuff things that
[1:26:37] ain't what it's going to be like
[1:26:39] amen so if you get your head built up
[1:26:41] around that when you finally do get
[1:26:43] married
[1:26:44] come on you're going to be in for a
[1:26:45] disappointment
[1:26:48] amen come on preach
[1:26:51] amen but that's not what marriage is
[1:26:53] about
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:58] and and so hollywood's not real neither
[1:27:00] is social media nobody posts their real
[1:27:03] life on social media
[1:27:06] no nobody when they post those selfies
[1:27:08] they selective about the selfie they
[1:27:10] post
[1:27:11] amen they don't post the one where
[1:27:13] everybody's hair is all messed up where
[1:27:15] they've been fighting all morning trying
[1:27:16] to get to church
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:21] i mean there's an old world this song
[1:27:22] said easy like sunday morning that's
[1:27:24] true that show's just worldly because
[1:27:26] because they ain't never been to church
[1:27:27] a day in their life
[1:27:34] sunday morning ain't easy
[1:27:36] sunday morning's a fight i'd be ashamed
[1:27:38] for y'all to hear some of the
[1:27:39] conversations i've had on the way to
[1:27:41] church
[1:27:42] because it's a battle sunday mornings
[1:27:45] amen that's when everything's going
[1:27:46] wrong everybody's ill you can't get
[1:27:48] nobody up
[1:27:50] can't get the kids dressed
[1:27:52] amen it's a battle sunday morning ain't
[1:27:54] easy
[1:27:55] nobody posts that on facebook
[1:27:59] amen they post their fake family on
[1:28:01] facebook
[1:28:02] they're right
[1:28:04] so so people the bible said that in in
[1:28:07] this last days they'd be uh covetous
[1:28:11] they'd be looking over at what other
[1:28:13] people have and wanting it
[1:28:15] and so they look over at social media
[1:28:17] and they see what people have on social
[1:28:19] media and they want it but that's not
[1:28:21] real
[1:28:22] amen so they want something that's not
[1:28:24] possible to attain
[1:28:26] you see where i'm going here saints they
[1:28:28] want something that ain't
[1:28:30] come on
[1:28:34] amen
[1:28:37] and so
[1:28:40] so we find that the world is is setting
[1:28:42] themselves up for failure by false
[1:28:44] expectations
[1:28:46] false expectations of what a marriage is
[1:28:49] because they've seen a too many romance
[1:28:51] movies or read too many romance novels
[1:28:54] false expectations of what they should
[1:28:56] look like or how they should act because
[1:28:58] of what they've seen hollywood do or
[1:29:00] what they've seen somebody post on
[1:29:02] social media it's false
[1:29:05] amen it's it's it's all it's all it's i
[1:29:07] call it their foe family
[1:29:12] and i want you to i'm skipping down a
[1:29:13] little bit
[1:29:15] i want you to think about this
[1:29:17] before you post the next picture i'm not
[1:29:19] telling you not to post on facebook
[1:29:21] and i'm not telling you not to not to
[1:29:23] get on facebook or social media
[1:29:25] but just like just like you can read
[1:29:28] your bible or you can look at something
[1:29:29] nasty on your phone
[1:29:31] you can
[1:29:33] you can get all into facebook
[1:29:35] and you know if you're being nosy or not
[1:29:38] amen
[1:29:39] or you can use it as a tool to talk to
[1:29:42] your family you can use this tool to
[1:29:43] talk to somebody about the lord
[1:29:45] it's whatever you do with it i will tell
[1:29:47] you this if it keeps you stirred up all
[1:29:49] the time i'd get rid of it
[1:29:52] if you're all tore up all the time about
[1:29:54] what facebook says i'd get rid of it
[1:29:57] it ain't even facebook now what is it
[1:29:58] instagram is that the big one now or
[1:30:00] something
[1:30:01] i don't know
[1:30:03] but if it if it doesn't edify you i'd
[1:30:05] get rid of it amen
[1:30:07] but let's let that let be led by the
[1:30:09] holy spirit i i i can't say that it's
[1:30:11] bad or or good
[1:30:13] a lot of things are inherently not bad
[1:30:15] or good just depends on what people are
[1:30:16] doing with it
[1:30:18] but i will tell you this brother brown
[1:30:20] said this in flashing reds uh light of
[1:30:23] the sign of his coming he said this i
[1:30:25] want you to think about this before you
[1:30:26] post the next picture he said i remember
[1:30:29] a man i worked for chris meisner up here
[1:30:31] on the corner and many of you remember
[1:30:33] chris meisner his wife lillian her name
[1:30:34] was lily i think l wanger and when she a
[1:30:37] man come over and she was a beautiful
[1:30:40] girl and a man wanted to get permission
[1:30:42] from her father to put her face her
[1:30:45] picture her profile on a box of candy
[1:30:50] now that don't sound that bad does it
[1:30:53] he said and this old german luther stood
[1:30:55] to his feet and said that's an insult to
[1:30:58] me
[1:31:00] to put my daughter's picture on a box of
[1:31:03] candy
[1:31:05] to spread across the country
[1:31:08] he says what about today when the
[1:31:09] billboards the television everything you
[1:31:11] see is immoral vulgar sexy ungodly
[1:31:15] looking things
[1:31:16] now i will tell you this brother branham
[1:31:18] talked about this german lutheran with
[1:31:20] admiration
[1:31:22] that he did not want his daughter's
[1:31:24] picture
[1:31:25] her profile to be used on a box of
[1:31:28] candy amen
[1:31:30] now you think about what people post on
[1:31:33] social media today to be spread and seen
[1:31:36] all over the world
[1:31:38] amen
[1:31:40] and so we got to be careful what we put
[1:31:42] out there the other thing we need to do
[1:31:44] is be careful if you're doing something
[1:31:45] private with your family and it's just
[1:31:47] you and your family it's a private thing
[1:31:49] let it be private
[1:31:51] don't post it all over everywhere for
[1:31:53] everybody else to see
[1:31:55] amen there's some things that you can do
[1:31:57] with your family that you probably
[1:31:59] shouldn't have everybody else around to
[1:32:00] see
[1:32:03] that right
[1:32:04] let your personal business be personal
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] so
[1:32:11] as believers though we got to be careful
[1:32:14] not to let all of this stuff that's
[1:32:16] going on all the hollywood and all the
[1:32:18] facebooks and all the things going on in
[1:32:20] the world and all the current events we
[1:32:22] got to be careful not to let all that
[1:32:24] consume us and and be and and and you
[1:32:28] know get negative you know you've run
[1:32:29] into believers that are like current
[1:32:31] event believers brother ben all they do
[1:32:33] is watch the news all the time and
[1:32:35] looking at everything in the news and
[1:32:36] trying to figure out and that's fine to
[1:32:38] do that i'm i'm not against that but
[1:32:39] saints it gets to where it overwhelms
[1:32:42] them it gets to where it consumes them
[1:32:44] and we got to be careful about that the
[1:32:46] only news that we really ought to be
[1:32:47] worried about is the good news
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:52] we can get so consumed with the news
[1:32:55] amen that it just sucks the life out of
[1:32:57] us it's it's so negative it's so it's so
[1:33:00] evil and so it's so it's a new level of
[1:33:03] insanity every time you turn it on and
[1:33:05] it can just drain the the spirit out of
[1:33:07] you just to watch it
[1:33:09] and so we we don't need a whole lot of
[1:33:11] conspiracy theories and and all this
[1:33:14] kind of thing going on in the message we
[1:33:16] don't need to be digging holes under our
[1:33:18] house to hide in and storing up a bunch
[1:33:20] of food and ammunitions and all that
[1:33:22] kind of stuff since we're not planning
[1:33:24] on going through the tribulation we're
[1:33:27] planning on going home before it gets
[1:33:29] here
[1:33:32] amen the the the children of israel the
[1:33:36] the hebrew children rather they they
[1:33:38] didn't have a whole bunch of munitions
[1:33:40] and a whole bunch of food stored up to
[1:33:42] help them against the king's decree what
[1:33:44] they had was the fourth man in the fire
[1:33:47] with them
[1:33:49] amen
[1:33:50] and the bride's not doing a lot of
[1:33:52] planning how we're going to go through
[1:33:53] tribulation amen we're putting our faith
[1:33:56] in jesus christ tonight
[1:34:00] amen and having confidence that he's
[1:34:03] going to make it through
[1:34:05] amen he's going to take care of us he's
[1:34:07] our portion
[1:34:08] amen he'll take care of us i i'm not i'm
[1:34:11] not worried about tribulation i'm
[1:34:12] worried about getting out of tribulation
[1:34:16] amen
[1:34:22] so we can't be consumed with all these
[1:34:24] things and we don't need to be too
[1:34:26] surprised
[1:34:27] when things get worse
[1:34:29] we don't need to get too wrapped up with
[1:34:31] it you know brother brown said it was
[1:34:33] going to be this way the bible says it's
[1:34:35] going to be this way so when we see that
[1:34:37] happening we just praise the lord it's
[1:34:39] prophecy being fulfilled amen we can
[1:34:41] just praise god and say hey it's god's
[1:34:43] words coming to pass amen
[1:34:49] you know we don't have to be surprised
[1:34:52] when something evil comes out of
[1:34:54] washington because brother brown said
[1:34:55] washington was corrupt from pillar to
[1:34:57] post
[1:34:58] amen
[1:34:59] so you know i don't have to know what
[1:35:00] biden's doing i know it's going to be
[1:35:02] bad
[1:35:05] because it's corrupt
[1:35:07] is that right
[1:35:08] amen when the government does something
[1:35:10] bad well didn't the devil say he owned
[1:35:12] them didn't he say i got them i control
[1:35:15] them and i'll give them to you if you
[1:35:17] just bow down and worship me so we know
[1:35:19] they're controlled by the devil so why
[1:35:21] does it surprise us when they do evil
[1:35:24] amen they're just doing what their daddy
[1:35:26] said amen
[1:35:29] we don't have to be surprised with wars
[1:35:31] and evils and and the next person that
[1:35:33] walks down the street uh you know three
[1:35:36] quarters of the way naked or worse
[1:35:38] we don't have to be shocked by any of
[1:35:39] that
[1:35:40] it's just prophecy being fulfilled
[1:35:43] but you know this world that we live in
[1:35:45] is this uh
[1:35:47] uh
[1:35:47] this world of deception that we live in
[1:35:50] you know people are blind to it
[1:35:53] and it's bad to be blind but you know
[1:35:55] the bible said it's even worse than that
[1:35:57] they're blind and they don't know it
[1:35:59] it's one thing to be blind it's another
[1:36:00] thing to be blind and not know you're
[1:36:02] blind
[1:36:03] and it's worse than that it's not only
[1:36:05] that they're blind and don't know it
[1:36:07] it's that they blind and don't know it
[1:36:08] and they think their rights
[1:36:11] it's a bad situation to be in
[1:36:14] and i see brothers and sisters this
[1:36:16] spirit of delusion can affect us in the
[1:36:19] message today
[1:36:20] and we've found if you've been around
[1:36:22] very long at all you've seen one wave
[1:36:24] after doctrine after a doctrine after
[1:36:26] doctrine
[1:36:27] amen you've seen one false doctrine
[1:36:29] after another you've seen one thing
[1:36:31] right after another come through and and
[1:36:33] every year it seems like a new one crops
[1:36:35] up
[1:36:36] amen but the bride will hold to the word
[1:36:40] of god
[1:36:42] the bride will believe the word of god
[1:36:45] above anything else
[1:36:47] is that right
[1:36:49] she's going to feed on the word of god
[1:36:50] the bride of jesus christ feeds on the
[1:36:52] word of god
[1:36:54] and it might be crazy to you tonight for
[1:36:57] a human to think they're a dog
[1:36:59] that's crazy but to me it's even crazier
[1:37:02] at people that listen to the message of
[1:37:04] the hour and decide that it's god's will
[1:37:07] for them to quit going to church
[1:37:13] it's delusion saints
[1:37:15] i want to be the best message believer
[1:37:17] in the world so i'm going to turn my
[1:37:19] back on the church
[1:37:21] where is it at saints it's strong
[1:37:24] delusion
[1:37:25] it might be crazy to let a hollywood
[1:37:28] idol dictate your life that might be
[1:37:31] crazy
[1:37:33] amen but it's even crazier to listen to
[1:37:35] this message and try to lift up a man
[1:37:40] try to idolize a man a minister a
[1:37:42] personality
[1:37:45] amen we look at the word we say look at
[1:37:48] them they're patterned after hollywood
[1:37:49] and here we are in a message pattern
[1:37:51] after a man
[1:37:52] come on preach come on
[1:37:55] strong delusion
[1:37:58] we don't worship men
[1:38:00] amen
[1:38:02] it might be crazy for a ten-year-old boy
[1:38:07] to think he's a girl
[1:38:09] but it's even crazier to think to be
[1:38:10] part of the bride everybody's got to
[1:38:12] listen to the same tape at the same time
[1:38:20] delusion saints
[1:38:22] amen and it's look this after these
[1:38:24] doctrines go away the next batch will
[1:38:26] come in
[1:38:28] amen the next batch of false doctrine
[1:38:30] the best the next batch of of crazy
[1:38:32] ideas will come right in behind this one
[1:38:35] amen that's just where we're at right
[1:38:36] now but there's plenty more to come
[1:38:39] amen
[1:38:42] and you know in the world we live in a
[1:38:44] country of brother braham said woman
[1:38:45] worship
[1:38:47] we idolize women in the countries led by
[1:38:49] women but i'll tell you in the message
[1:38:51] of the hour it's man worship
[1:38:54] prayer come on man worship
[1:38:57] you know there ain't no man that i know
[1:38:59] of that flies into his britches
[1:39:05] every one of them puts them on one leg
[1:39:06] at a time as far as i know amen
[1:39:09] just men
[1:39:10] just men now i respect god's gifts i
[1:39:13] respect the men of god
[1:39:15] i have respect for them but i'm not
[1:39:16] going to bow my knee to them
[1:39:19] amen
[1:39:20] i'm not going to bow need to
[1:39:22] amen we're all just men
[1:39:25] on amen and so we find then that it's a
[1:39:28] spirit of delusion
[1:39:31] and i don't believe that the people
[1:39:32] actually know they're worshiping other
[1:39:34] people but i'll tell you this if you
[1:39:36] take another man's word over god's word
[1:39:44] now now paul said if any man
[1:39:47] says anything contrary to what i already
[1:39:50] said
[1:39:51] he said if i say
[1:39:53] anything contrary to what i already said
[1:39:56] if an angel says anything contrary to
[1:39:59] what i already said let him be a curse
[1:40:03] let him acknowledge that the words that
[1:40:04] i say unto you are the words
[1:40:07] of god
[1:40:09] amen
[1:40:13] come on
[1:40:14] now what does the message say about this
[1:40:16] investments brother braham says this
[1:40:17] daniel was a prophet
[1:40:20] and the words of god the bible
[1:40:22] the bible was invested to daniel so the
[1:40:25] words of god came to daniel because the
[1:40:27] words of god come to the prophet
[1:40:30] and daniel was a prophet is that right
[1:40:32] so he said that he invested to daniel to
[1:40:34] manifest to the people that god still
[1:40:36] lives see a prophet's job is to manifest
[1:40:38] that god still lives
[1:40:40] is that right yeah
[1:40:43] and daniel's purposed in his heart that
[1:40:45] he would not defile his investment or if
[1:40:48] the church could only do that if the
[1:40:49] church could only purpose in your heart
[1:40:53] that you won't defile your investment
[1:40:57] with any tie up with things that brings
[1:40:59] you into a system
[1:41:02] see we're not involved in any system
[1:41:04] saints
[1:41:05] amen the church of god is led by the
[1:41:08] holy spirit
[1:41:09] amen this church is not led by men it's
[1:41:13] led by the holy spirit
[1:41:15] amen god appointed a pastor for this
[1:41:18] church do y'all believe that and that
[1:41:20] pastor answers to god alone
[1:41:23] and then he's not answering to a group
[1:41:24] of men he's not answering to a district
[1:41:26] presbyter he's not answering to a
[1:41:28] general overseer nobody tells him what
[1:41:30] to preach on it's the holy spirit of god
[1:41:34] that leads the church
[1:41:37] now he uses he uses a pastor to do that
[1:41:40] is that right but it the leadership is
[1:41:42] of the holy spirit
[1:41:45] not by a group of men
[1:41:48] and he said daniel purposed in his heart
[1:41:50] and what did it do it saved his life
[1:41:53] from the lions
[1:41:55] the hebrew children made an investment
[1:41:58] in god here's the part i want to get to
[1:42:00] the hebrew children made an investment
[1:42:01] of god that they would not break his
[1:42:03] commandments
[1:42:05] no matter if they made an image of their
[1:42:07] holy brother daniel
[1:42:10] see saints brother branham said that the
[1:42:13] king made an image
[1:42:15] and he wanted them to fall down and
[1:42:17] worship that image
[1:42:19] and the image was of daniel
[1:42:23] amen
[1:42:26] now that that'd catch a lot of them off
[1:42:28] guard today wouldn't it
[1:42:29] see everything that's called message
[1:42:31] ain't always messed up
[1:42:34] and he said i believe the image was of
[1:42:36] daniel because he was built to chase our
[1:42:38] god and we find out that he made an
[1:42:40] image to his holy man no matter how holy
[1:42:43] the man was they wasn't to bow down to
[1:42:47] any form of image
[1:42:50] no matter how holy the man was preached
[1:42:54] no matter how holy it was
[1:42:57] they wasn't to bow down to that image
[1:42:59] no matter what the image is the gentile
[1:43:02] world was issued in by worshiping a holy
[1:43:05] image
[1:43:06] and it's going out the same way
[1:43:10] and you see the system doing it today so
[1:43:12] the hebrew children would not bow to any
[1:43:15] image and you find out their investment
[1:43:17] paid off by saving their life
[1:43:20] amen
[1:43:22] so we're not man worshipers
[1:43:24] amen
[1:43:26] and so we got
[1:43:27] strong delusion that keeps coming wave
[1:43:30] after wave of strong delusion keeps
[1:43:32] coming the the latest strong delusion
[1:43:34] that i got a hold of now see i'm the
[1:43:36] kind of believer that they hate
[1:43:38] because i'm the kind of believer that
[1:43:40] knows what brother branham said
[1:43:42] amen
[1:43:44] and and that makes people mad amen
[1:43:46] because all these ideas all these false
[1:43:48] doctrines they all sound real good and
[1:43:50] they can spin it and make it sound real
[1:43:52] good but you know when you start saying
[1:43:53] well you know what brother brown said
[1:43:56] they don't like that
[1:43:59] so the latest doctrine that i like to
[1:44:01] share these because they some of them
[1:44:02] just so silly they tickle me
[1:44:05] but the latest doctrine
[1:44:07] is that we don't need a fivefold
[1:44:09] ministry anymore
[1:44:11] which is apostles prophets
[1:44:13] uh pastors teachers evangelists right we
[1:44:16] don't need that anymore
[1:44:18] because all the fivefold
[1:44:22] was in brother branham
[1:44:24] now
[1:44:26] and and they took quotes
[1:44:29] of where brother branham said
[1:44:31] uh a little quote where brother brown
[1:44:32] says i'm a missionary
[1:44:35] and they said see there brother brown's
[1:44:36] a missionary
[1:44:38] well he didn't say he was the only
[1:44:39] missionary yeah
[1:44:41] amen
[1:44:42] they say do you believe me to be god's
[1:44:44] prophet well brother graham did say that
[1:44:46] yeah do you do the work of evangelists
[1:44:49] make full proof of your ministry the
[1:44:50] time will come so they said well see he
[1:44:52] was an evangelist too
[1:44:54] and then brother braham said you call me
[1:44:56] your pastor and you say well for so i am
[1:44:59] that's right that's what he said right
[1:45:02] he didn't say he was the only pastor
[1:45:06] teacher he said i want to speak a word
[1:45:08] or teach this sunday school lesson on
[1:45:10] the word of a token that's what brother
[1:45:12] brown said so they put them little
[1:45:13] snippets of the message out there
[1:45:16] and then buy them little snippets of the
[1:45:18] message formulate a doctrine that we
[1:45:20] don't have a fivefold ministry because
[1:45:22] it was all god's profit
[1:45:28] you know how many throw uh quotes you
[1:45:29] got to throw in the trash to to have a
[1:45:31] doctrine like that
[1:45:32] that's right
[1:45:34] you know how many scriptures got to go
[1:45:36] into garbage
[1:45:37] to have a doctrine like that right
[1:45:39] strong delusion
[1:45:42] amen so i found me some quotes too
[1:45:47] and brother brahma says
[1:45:49] now
[1:45:50] i'm not a teacher
[1:45:54] i'm a long ways from being a bible
[1:45:56] expositor
[1:45:59] that's what brother braham said
[1:46:01] so you find a quote says he i'm a
[1:46:02] teacher i'll find one he said i ain't a
[1:46:04] teacher
[1:46:05] now you're going to believe all the
[1:46:06] prophets said or what
[1:46:09] is that right
[1:46:10] we don't believe all the prophets said
[1:46:13] pastor brother brahm says this i
[1:46:15] realized years ago i was called to the
[1:46:17] ministry i've never made a successful
[1:46:19] pastor
[1:46:22] is that what he said
[1:46:24] i've never made a successful pastor
[1:46:25] because i got a roman rambling spirit i
[1:46:27] can't be satisfied anywhere just
[1:46:29] wherever the spirit moves i just go move
[1:46:31] with it because i believe
[1:46:33] i have a message
[1:46:36] amen
[1:46:38] so you can take a p say he says i'm your
[1:46:40] pastor
[1:46:41] but then there's another one where it
[1:46:42] says i'm not a successful pastor
[1:46:45] evangelist he said but now he said i was
[1:46:48] he said but now he never said i was an
[1:46:50] evangelist
[1:46:52] he said do the work of an evangelist
[1:46:57] do that what brother braham said yeah
[1:47:01] and he says paul was telling timothy he
[1:47:03] said did you never notice he said he
[1:47:04] didn't say and now you have been called
[1:47:06] to be an evangelist it said do the work
[1:47:08] in evangel see now we notice there then
[1:47:10] brother brahm said
[1:47:12] amen
[1:47:13] so brothers and sisters it's all
[1:47:15] reprobate minds concerning the truth and
[1:47:19] we find that the whole world's losing
[1:47:21] its mind and and it's no different in
[1:47:24] the message of the hour that people are
[1:47:26] given to strong delusion saints people
[1:47:28] will believe anything but the truth
[1:47:32] they'll believe anything but what the
[1:47:33] truth is
[1:47:35] amen
[1:47:37] as the musicians come
[1:47:39] i don't think we did bad on time did we
[1:47:45] people believe anything but the truth
[1:47:48] and the whole world has lost its mind
[1:47:50] but saints i want to end on this the
[1:47:52] christian believers got to lose their
[1:47:53] mind too
[1:47:58] we got to lose our mind too
[1:48:00] amen
[1:48:01] because the bible said let the mind of
[1:48:03] christ be in you
[1:48:05] amen you can't trust your own mind
[1:48:08] amen so we got to rely on the mind of
[1:48:11] christ
[1:48:12] and the mind of christ saints is in his
[1:48:14] word
[1:48:16] amen and so all of this uh strong
[1:48:19] delusion all of these false doctrines
[1:48:21] all of these false teachings it always
[1:48:23] comes back to the same thing somewhere
[1:48:25] along the line we're letting go of the
[1:48:26] word
[1:48:28] it will stay with this word
[1:48:30] it will stay with this teaching it will
[1:48:33] stay with this message it will stay with
[1:48:35] this bible
[1:48:38] yes sir
[1:48:40] we won't have to worry about all this
[1:48:41] delusion
[1:48:42] if we lose our own ideas if we got an
[1:48:45] idea if we got a thought and that
[1:48:47] thought disagrees with the word
[1:48:49] somewhere get rid of that thought
[1:48:52] and go with what the word says
[1:48:54] amen amen let the mind of christ be in
[1:48:58] you i got opinions you've got opinions
[1:49:01] i've got things that i think you got
[1:49:03] things you think but if it's contrary to
[1:49:05] the word it ain't doctrine
[1:49:08] let the mind that was in christ
[1:49:10] be in you and if the mind of christ is
[1:49:13] in you his works you'll do his life
[1:49:16] you'll live his love you'll have
[1:49:19] amen his words you'll love
[1:49:22] amen
[1:49:24] if the mind is in christ is in you
[1:49:26] amen he he's the he's the redeemer
[1:49:29] of the redeemed saints
[1:49:32] amen he's he's the healer of the hill
[1:49:34] tonight
[1:49:36] amen he's he's the savior of the saved
[1:49:39] he's the encourager of the encouraged to
[1:49:41] knights
[1:49:42] he's the filler of the field saints
[1:49:47] amen he's the sanctifier of the
[1:49:50] sanctified
[1:49:51] amen
[1:49:53] and his works we will do
[1:49:57] amen
[1:49:59] and you know the bible said to do the
[1:50:00] works of god
[1:50:02] how do you do they ask the lord how you
[1:50:04] work the works of god
[1:50:06] and he said this is the work of god
[1:50:10] that you believe on him who he has sent
[1:50:12] amen
[1:50:14] we're believers tonight saints amen
