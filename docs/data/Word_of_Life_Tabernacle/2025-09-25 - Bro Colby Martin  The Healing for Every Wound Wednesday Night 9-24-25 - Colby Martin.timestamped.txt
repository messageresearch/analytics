[12:34] Are you happy to be in church tonight?
[12:36] Amen.
[12:41] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[12:45] the air in that sweet, sweet
[12:49] and mine.
[12:52] Well, I am going to meet you. Meet you
[12:56] over there in that hole beyond the sky.
[13:02] Oh, such singing you will hear never
[13:06] heard by more clear will be glorious. I
[13:10] do declare.
[13:13] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[13:17] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[13:24] You have heard of little Moses in the
[13:27] bull rush.
[13:29] You have heard of fearless day and his
[13:32] sleep.
[13:35] You have heard the story told of
[13:37] dreaming Joseph
[13:40] and of Jonah and the well you ought to
[13:43] see.
[13:45] There are many many others through the
[13:49] Bible.
[13:51] I should like to meet them all. I do
[13:54] declare
[13:56] by and by the Lord will surely let us
[13:59] meet them at that meeting in the air.
[14:06] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[14:11] the air in that sweet sweet by and by.

[14:21] you over there in that hole beyond the
[14:26] sky.
[14:27] Oh, such singing you will hear. Never
[14:31] heard by mortal ear. It will be
[14:33] glorious. I do declare.
[14:38] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[14:42] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[14:48] Many things will there be missing in
[14:51] that meeting.
[14:54] For the martyr's bench will have no
[14:56] place at all.
[14:59] There will never be a servant preached
[15:02] to sinners.
[15:04] For the sinner had refused to heed the
[15:08] call.
[15:10] There will be no mourning over wayward
[15:13] love ones. There will be no lonely
[15:17] nights of bleeding prayer.
[15:20] All our burdens and our anguish will be
[15:24] lifted
[15:26] and that meeting in the air.
[15:31] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[15:35] the air in that sweet, sweet by and by.
[15:41] I am going to meet you. Going to meet
[15:45] you over there in that hole beyond the
[15:50] sky.
[15:52] Oh, such singing you will hear. Never
[15:55] heard by mortal ear. It will be
[15:58] glorious. I do declare.
[16:02] Oh, and God's own son will be the
[16:06] leading one at that meeting in the air.
[16:13] There the doubters will be missing all
[16:16] together.
[16:18] All the skeptics will be absent on that
[16:21] day.
[16:23] There will be no rumbers present to
[16:26] disturb us.
[16:29] And the Aens will be busy far away.
[16:34] Oh, there the saints will have their
[16:36] seal upon their foreheads.
[16:39] R dressed and raining on the but ones to
[16:42] wear.
[16:44] All who have the wedding garments will
[16:47] be present
[16:50] at that meeting in the air.
[16:55] Well, there is going to be a meeting in
[16:59] the air in that sweet.
[17:04] Oh, let me hear you sing it now.
[17:09] Beat you over there in that home beyond
[17:13] the sky.
[17:16] Oh, such singing you will hear. Never
[17:19] heard by mortal ear. It will be
[17:22] glorious. I do declare.
[17:26] Oh, and God's own son. It will be the
[17:31] one at that meeting. Turn around, shake
[17:34] somebody's hand as they play it one time
[17:36] now.
[17:37] [Music]
[18:02] My
[18:03] will be glorious. I do declare.
[18:08] Oh, and God's own son, he will be the
[18:12] leading one at that meeting in thee. One
[18:17] more time as the ushers come down. Well,

[18:23] air in the sweet, sweet by and by.
[18:29] I'm going to meet you, meet you over
[18:34] there in that home beyond the sky.
[18:39] Oh, such singing you will hear never
[18:43] heard before.
[18:46] [Music]
[18:50] And God's own son will be the leading
[18:55] one at that meeting in the air.

[24:14] If you believe that, can you give the
[24:15] Lord a big hand clap of praise here
[24:17] tonight?
[24:18] [Applause]
[24:33] [Music]
[24:54] In the beginning
[25:01] of time,
[25:04] he was the creator.
[25:08] [Music]
[25:14] In into existence
[25:20] he spoke
[25:23] the heavenly
[25:26] blue.
[25:33] And with one mighty
[25:37] swoop of his hand,
[25:42] he threw out the stars.
[25:46] He knew where they'd land.
[25:52] So if you think
[25:55] you're just drifting
[25:58] along,
[26:00] then I have good news.
[26:09] If he on the moon,
[26:19] I know he will help you.
[26:28] And if he holds a spare
[26:35] and flight,
[26:38] he'll hold you, too.
[26:47] Consider
[26:49] the liies
[26:52] of the field.
[26:56] how much more he loves you.
[27:01] [Music]
[27:05] In the beginning
[27:07] of time,
[27:10] you were on his mind
[27:15] when he hung the moon.
[27:20] [Music]
[27:24] And now you may feel like
[27:29] the world
[27:31] lays hard
[27:34] on
[27:36] your shoulders.
[27:43] And even your closest
[27:48] friend
[27:49] in life
[27:52] is pulling
[27:55] away.
[28:02] And though you have tried so hard
[28:08] and lost,
[28:11] there is still hope. Just look to the
[28:17] cross.
[28:19] There you will see
[28:23] just how much the Savior
[28:28] really loves you today.
[28:36] And if he
[28:38] [Music]
[28:46] know he will help you.
[28:50] [Music]
[28:54] And if he holds a spare
[29:00] in flight,
[29:03] then he'll hold you, too.
[29:11] Just consider
[29:14] the liies
[29:16] of the field.
[29:20] How much more he loves you.
[29:26] [Music]
[29:28] In the beginning
[29:31] of time,
[29:34] you were on his mind.
[29:38] When he hung the moon
[29:46] in the beginning
[29:48] of time,
[29:51] you were on his mind
[29:55] when he hung the moon.
[29:59] [Music]
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:17] Hey man, how many enjoyed that special
[30:18] here tonight? If he hung the moon, tell
[30:21] you what, if he if he knows every little
[30:24] sparrow and every hair on your head,
[30:26] it's easier on some than others, but
[30:28] some of us it takes a long time to count
[30:30] the hairs on your head. And uh
[30:34] Amen. And aren't you glad he knows
[30:35] everything about us and he cares about
[30:37] it? Cares about every little thing and
[30:39] every big thing. Let's stand together.
[30:41] I've kind of want to change these last
[30:42] couple songs up and wake everybody up
[30:44] for a minute if we can.
[30:46] Well, some glad morning.
[30:49] When this life is over, I
[30:54] I'll fly away
[30:57] to
[30:59] home on God's celestial shore.
[31:03] I'm going to fly away.
[31:07] We're singing.

[31:15] Fly away.
[31:18] Oh, I rise. Hallelujah. By and by. Oh
[31:23] yes. I
[31:25] I'll fly away.
[31:28] Oh, and when the shadows of this life
[31:33] grow out,
[31:36] I'll fly away.
[31:38] Oh, like a bird from prison. Mars is
[31:43] flat.
[32:00] Oh, I rise. Hallelujah. Bye-bye.
[32:05] Oh, I
[32:07] fly away.
[32:10] Oh, and just a few more weary days of
[32:14] me. I
[32:17] go fly away.
[32:20] Oh, to a land where joy shall never end.

[32:30] it now. Sing it
[32:34] away.

[36:14] sparrows?" Amen. Amen. Much more than

[36:19] of God or a daughter of God. So thankful

[39:46] my cup.
[39:49] Fill it up
[39:52] and make me whole.
[39:58] Heavenly Father,
[40:00] that's our desire tonight. Lord, I
[40:02] believe everyone from the youngest to
[40:05] the oldest, Lord, can say, "Father,
[40:08] here's our cup."
[40:10] And Lord, we need filled and refilled
[40:12] every day, Lord. And I pray tonight,
[40:15] Father, we may be weary in body and
[40:17] mind, Lord, and we we may have come
[40:20] through a battle, Lord, just getting
[40:22] here. And God, I pray that you touch
[40:26] every heart tonight, Lord. Lift up the
[40:29] feeble hands, Lord. Anyone that's maybe
[40:32] fighting discouragement tonight, Father,
[40:34] I pray that you uplift their hands,
[40:37] Lord. Encourage each one, Father. The
[40:40] all the faithful that has come out
[40:42] tonight. I pray that you just you bless
[40:44] them abundantly, Lord, is our prayer. We
[40:48] love you, Lord, and we're thanking you
[40:50] for all that you've done and you're
[40:51] going to do for us. In your precious
[40:54] name, we pray. Amen. And amen. Do you
[40:56] love the Lord here tonight?
[40:59] Amen. I'd like to say it's it is an
[41:01] honor to to be here. Um
[41:05] it has been about I guess about five
[41:08] years. Brother Joel did remind me. He's
[41:10] like, "When you came last time, you were
[41:11] wearing the same suit." And I was, it is
[41:15] the same suit, but this is a bigger
[41:17] size. I was smaller back then. So, but
[41:19] yeah, it it it definitely is an honor to
[41:21] be here. We we love every one of y'all
[41:24] and consider this our our second family.
[41:26] So, we're honored honored to be here and
[41:29] like to say it is good to have my family
[41:31] with me. I we were at brother Jason
[41:33] Jackson's uh Sunday and they weren't
[41:36] able to be there. And I tell you, it's a
[41:38] big difference when your family's not
[41:40] there. She's my my number one uh amen
[41:42] corner. And honestly, I I wouldn't be
[41:45] here today if it wasn't for my wife. And
[41:47] and I say that everywhere I go, but I I
[41:49] truly mean that. She's a uh she's a a
[41:53] blessing to me and and a help. And she's
[41:56] she's made me into the man I am today.
[41:59] And I I I wouldn't have anything I got
[42:02] today if it wasn't for her. So, I I'm
[42:04] very grateful to have them with us. and
[42:06] I am going to have them sing, but it's
[42:08] going to be after the service. So, I
[42:10] hope that's okay here tonight. And but
[42:12] if I appreciate your musicians, your
[42:14] song leader. Um, but if we can turn to
[42:18] Psalms 103 and verse one and
[42:23] Psalms 103 and verse one, Brother
[42:25] Brandham says here, he says, "When I see
[42:26] the angel take his chair and maybe and
[42:29] and lean back toward his tent and Sarah
[42:32] listening through the tent, you know,
[42:34] kindly easedropping, you know, and
[42:36] listening through the tent, she was kind
[42:38] of in an awful mood that morning. You
[42:41] don't see things when you come to church
[42:42] in that kind of a mood. you just you
[42:45] there's no need of trying. He says you
[42:47] just might as well stay home. You won't
[42:49] get nothing anyway. But when you come to
[42:51] church, come prayed up. Come in the
[42:53] atmosphere and come expecting. And I
[42:56] pray that you've come expecting here
[42:58] tonight. And um but Psalms 103 and verse
[43:04] verse one. It says, "Bless the Lord, oh
[43:06] my soul, and all that is within me,
[43:08] bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, oh
[43:11] my soul, and forget not all of his
[43:13] benefits. Who forgiveth all of thy
[43:16] iniquities, and who healeth all of thy
[43:19] diseases. We can also stay in the same
[43:22] book of Psalms and turn to verse or
[43:24] chapter 147 and verse three. When you're
[43:26] there, say amen.
[43:38] says, "He he health health the broken in
[43:40] heart and he bindeth up their wounds."
[43:43] Two more passages of scripture and then
[43:45] I'll let you have your seats. If we can
[43:47] turn to Proverbs 17 and verse 22.
[43:51] 17 and verse 22.
[43:59] It says, "A merry heart doth good like a
[44:02] medicine, but a broken spirit dryth the
[44:05] bones." One more passage. Jeremiah 30
[44:09] and verse 17.
[44:11] Jeremiah 30 and verse 17.
[44:16] And we're just going to read half of
[44:17] this verse here. It says, "For I will
[44:19] restore health unto thee, and I will
[44:22] heal thee of thy wounds, sayaith the
[44:24] Lord."
[44:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now you may be seated.
[44:27] and wanting to speak on a a topic that's
[44:32] that's very personal to me and it's it's
[44:35] things that I've dealt with in my life
[44:37] and and and in my past and back home we
[44:41] deal with the youth. So we're more of a
[44:42] of a simple preacher. So tonight you're
[44:45] all youth. I don't care how old you are,
[44:47] you're all youth tonight. I hope that's
[44:49] okay. in but of things I've dealt with
[44:51] in my life and in my past. And if I had
[44:54] a title, it would be the healing for
[44:56] every wound. And if we could take the
[44:59] time and go through this room, I bet
[45:02] everybody here has had some kind of
[45:05] wound on their natural body. Uh a and
[45:08] that wound has led to some kind of scar.
[45:09] I I know I've I've fallen out of trees
[45:11] as a kid and I've I've gotten scars
[45:13] along my side and uh you know maybe some
[45:15] of us have broken bones and maybe had
[45:18] stitches or um god forbid a knife wound
[45:21] uh maybe even a a gunshot wound. I was
[45:24] at brother Dave Morris's preaching over
[45:26] there and I and I was going along this
[45:28] topic. It was on my heart and and I
[45:30] mentioned you know maybe someone here
[45:32] has maybe had a gunshot wound and a lady
[45:35] raised her hand and said my husband
[45:36] twice. So, I'm like, "Wow, I that that's
[45:39] that's crazy." But the wounds and the
[45:42] healing that I want to speak on tonight,
[45:44] it goes beyond the physical. It it goes
[45:47] beyond the body down to the senses of
[45:50] the soul. And we know that our body has
[45:52] five senses. Ain't that right? See,
[45:54] taste, smell, hear, and touch. And
[45:56] brother Brandham says our soul has five
[45:59] senses or attributes as well. It's your
[46:02] imagination, your your conscience, your
[46:04] your memory, your your reason, and and
[46:07] your affection. And in these five
[46:10] senses, we can let things keep us from
[46:12] letting go or forgiving.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And in the natural body, you can see the
[46:17] scars where someone's had an accident or
[46:20] or or had surgery. But for the soul and
[46:23] the spirit, they are not physically
[46:25] seen. And and these are called hidden
[46:27] wounds.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And these wounds that they that
[46:30] can't be stitched or or or stapled or or
[46:32] or bandaged.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; These are wounds that you can't see.
[46:37] Ain't that right? And you know, we we
[46:39] like as men, we like talking about our
[46:41] our physical wounds and like to describe
[46:44] the heroic act that took place to get
[46:47] this broken bone or or the wound that we
[46:49] got, you know, for it makes us I tell my
[46:51] my my boys, you know, the scars, it
[46:54] makes you look tough.
[46:56] Well, my you know, I'm missing Simeon. I
[46:58] just realized that. Anyways, my one of
[47:01] my boys, he went hunting for the first
[47:04] time last year and he got scoped scoped
[47:07] right here. So, he got a scar right
[47:08] here. And I told him that scars, they
[47:10] they make you look tough. And ain't that
[47:13] right? Ain't that right, man? Makes you
[47:15] look tough.
[47:16] But these hidden wounds, it may it may
[47:18] take a split second recollection of a
[47:22] hidden a wound can cause pain and
[47:25] memories of abuse or or or ridicule or
[47:27] or criticism, maybe neglect, uh
[47:30] emotional abuse or even spiritual abuse
[47:33] can take place. And you say, "Brother
[47:34] Colby, where do you get your hidden
[47:37] wounds?" You can get them anywhere.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; You can get it from society. You can get
[47:41] it from family and parents a and
[47:44] children and brothers, your your sister,
[47:46] your aunt and uncle, your your your
[47:48] wife, your husband, your your friends,
[47:50] your acquaintances, church members, even
[47:52] a pastor
[47:54] &gt;&gt; can can give you hidden wounds. And one
[47:57] thing is for certain, everybody has had
[48:00] a hidden wound. And if you haven't, let
[48:02] me know your secret.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've all had at least one. You
[48:07] may be masking it here this tonight by
[48:09] by wearing a fake facade. But most of us
[48:12] have has had an emotional scar from
[48:15] somebody in the past. And there are
[48:18] things that you can apply to a natural
[48:20] scar that can give it a a a temporary
[48:22] covering. And people will apply makeup
[48:25] to cover a natural scar. And if they're
[48:28] looking for a more permanent situation
[48:29] or a solution, they'll they'll go have
[48:32] surgery on that imperfection that's on
[48:34] their body. that no matter how much you
[48:36] try to cover it up, there's always going
[48:38] to be a scar there. And people try to
[48:41] cover up their scars and their hurts
[48:43] with religion. And we can go try going
[48:45] to church and we can sit on a pew and
[48:47] and sing in the choir or help around the
[48:50] around the church. But the only thing
[48:52] that will truly take away the hurts is
[48:55] not how much works you can do
[48:57] &gt;&gt; and how busy you can be and how much you
[48:59] pay in tithing every day or every every
[49:02] service, but it's surrendering your
[49:04] hurts and your wounds to Jesus Christ.
[49:07] Man can try in their own ability to to
[49:10] cover it up and to mask it with a smile,
[49:13] but only God can take the pain.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Only God can take that wound.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right, Dad?
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Another thing is for certain emotional
[49:24] wounds take longer to heal than physical
[49:27] wounds do. Hey,
[49:28] &gt;&gt; a soldier comes back from war and he has
[49:30] shrapnel in his body. He's he's limping
[49:33] and he's he's got bandages on his right
[49:35] arm and around his head. And they say
[49:36] you give him 6 to9 months. Physically
[49:39] he'll be okay, but emotionally the
[49:42] wounds from the war will be with him for
[49:45] a long long time. I I came across this
[49:48] story and it's told by the grandson's
[49:50] perspective. He says, "My grandfather on
[49:52] my mother's side fought in World War II
[49:54] in the South Pacific." And he says, "I
[49:57] remember growing up and I would stay at
[49:59] their house quite often and on a few
[50:02] occasions I remember him having
[50:04] nightmares of killing Japanese
[50:05] soldiers." That was in the 70s and the
[50:08] war was in the 40s. Just recently he's
[50:11] had one of his legs amputated.
[50:14] And during this time from the surgery,
[50:17] someone walked into his hospital room
[50:19] and he was hiding behind his bed, hiding
[50:22] from Japanese soldiers. He was in his
[50:25] 80s and the war was 60 years ago. So we
[50:29] understand that emotional scars can last
[50:32] a long long time. But no matter where
[50:35] you've got that wound and that scar and
[50:39] that pain, no matter the source, there
[50:41] is a healing here tonight for every
[50:43] wound. Psalms 119:81 says, "My soul
[50:47] faintth for thy salvation, but I hope in
[50:50] thy word. My my eyes failed for thy
[50:52] word, saying, when will thou comfort me?
[50:55] Psalms 34:18 says, "The Lord is nigh
[50:58] unto them that are of a broken heart,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; and saveest such as be of a contrite
[51:05] spirit." The ESV version says, "The Lord
[51:07] is near to the brokenhearted."
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; And he saves the crushed in spirit. So
[51:14] there's healing for every hurt. And he
[51:16] is the hope for every need tonight. He
[51:18] is Jehovah Gyra. The Lord will provide.
[51:21] He is Jehovah Nissi. The Lord gives
[51:24] victory or deliverance. He is Jehovah
[51:26] Shalom. The Lord is our peace. He is
[51:28] Jehovah Shamba, the everpresent one. And
[51:31] my favorite is Exodus 15. He says, "I am
[51:34] Jehovah Rafa," which means, "I am the
[51:36] God that healeth thee."
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 147 and3 says, "He heals
[51:43] the broken in heart."
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. and he binds up every
[51:47] wound. So, I don't care how long you've
[51:50] been facing this pain in your life, God
[51:52] can take it away in an instant.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; But we got to get past our pride. And we
[51:57] got to be willing to let go of the pain.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Let go of the hurts.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, our sin situation
[52:05] requires a savior. But our emotional
[52:08] situation that we're dealing with
[52:10] requires a healer.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; It requires a healer. When we repent and
[52:16] are born again of water and spirit, that
[52:18] takes care of our sin situation.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. But what we're in
[52:23] need of tonight is a healing of our
[52:25] mind, our our will, our emotions.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; We need God to come down and cleanse us
[52:31] from the inside out.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my, Lord.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. We can't live a
[52:40] fulfilling life
[52:42] if we can't get our healing.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; We can't live a true victorious life in
[52:48] Christ if we're still holding on to
[52:50] things.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; If we're not willing to let go and let
[52:54] God, you'll never have a complete
[52:56] breakthrough.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God says, "Okay, I I
[53:00] forgive you in an instant, and and I've
[53:02] washed away your sins in a moment, and
[53:04] I've given you the Holy Ghost, but
[53:06] there's so much more that I want to give
[53:09] you tonight. I want to heal your hurts.
[53:10] I want to I want to heal those hidden
[53:12] wounds. I I want to give you a life
[53:14] that's filled with joy and peace and
[53:17] happiness. And too many times we let God
[53:20] deal with the sin part of our life, but
[53:22] we never let him deal with the hurts in
[53:24] our life. And that only leads to
[53:26] frustrations because we still have
[53:27] wounds. Yeah. All right.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. These wounds,
[53:31] these deep scars, these hurts will rob
[53:34] you of a complete breakthrough if it's
[53:36] not dealt with. You say, "Brother Kobe,
[53:38] this can't happen." Brother Brandham
[53:40] deals with cases like this. He He begins
[53:43] to desert a lady in the message, the
[53:45] second miracle. I hope this is okay
[53:47] tonight.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; I know it's a Wednesday night, so I
[53:49] won't stay on this too long.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; But she is dealing with a nervous
[53:53] condition, and because of this, she's
[53:55] gotten cancer. And he continues to deal
[53:57] with her. And he tells her she's had a
[53:59] dog scare as a child. He says here, "But
[54:02] you've had some good teachings, and
[54:04] you've had many sorrows, too, haven't
[54:05] you, lady? You've had a great scare once
[54:08] in your life. Something seemed like when
[54:11] you were a school girl, and I I believe
[54:13] it was a dog or something like that,
[54:15] man. I see something bark and go or go
[54:18] on and you jump, you scream. You were
[54:20] just a child," he says. And down comes
[54:24] life coming down recently. He said,
[54:26] "You've been real nervous." Oh, yes.
[54:29] Here's something else moving up, sister.
[54:31] He's I'm sorry. Yes. I believe you know
[54:33] it. It's cancer. He says, "Come here for
[54:37] just a moment." And he begins to pray.
[54:39] He says, "Thou demon, in the name of
[54:41] Jesus Christ, come out of that woman."
[54:44] Do you realize once the problem was
[54:46] exposed, she was able to be healed.
[54:49] She's been dealing with this nervous
[54:50] condition since a child. And Satan has
[54:53] been hiding behind those emotions since
[54:56] a child.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; And Satan or brother Brandham pinpointed
[55:00] the problem saying, "You have a nervous
[55:03] condition because of a scare that you
[55:06] had as a child and she received a
[55:08] complete healing once that devil was
[55:10] exposed."
[55:15] &gt;&gt; He begins to tell a story about a
[55:17] certain lady married to a man by the
[55:19] name of Brother Huff. And this couple
[55:22] had a set of twins. And brother Brandham
[55:24] says, "These twins were staunch
[55:26] Christians." And this story is in the
[55:28] message and uncertain sound. He says,
[55:30] "One little girl going to school. She
[55:32] got a complex." He says, "The girls were
[55:35] telling her, "Hey, well, why don't you
[55:37] smoke like we do?" And and you think
[55:39] you're better than we are, and why don't
[55:42] you go to the dances? Now, they didn't
[55:44] go to do the dances, nor neither did
[55:46] they smoke or drink. And they made fun
[55:49] of, well, the healthier girl. She said,
[55:51] "Huh, well, let them jump in the river.
[55:53] I'm the one serving Christ. They don't
[55:56] want to just let them go." But the other
[55:58] one, this is where she got in trouble.
[56:01] She began to think, "Oh, maybe I can do
[56:04] something." And she built a complex and
[56:07] got nervous and she went insane. They
[56:11] had her in an institution for two years.
[56:13] And if I can stop here for a minute,
[56:15] complexes will destroy you. Yeah, that's
[56:18] right.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; Complexes will destroy you.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; I don't care how old you are or how
[56:25] young you are.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; We can deal with complexes in our life.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; I'll continue on with this story in just
[56:36] a moment here, but emotional scars of of
[56:38] of abuse and criticism and our past
[56:42] mistakes
[56:44] &gt;&gt; will keep us from fully experiencing who
[56:47] God is and what he can do.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; I built a complex being a a pastor's
[56:52] son, you you get to see the good and and
[56:54] the bad.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; You get to see a lot of the the behind
[56:57] the scenes that the the church members
[56:59] don't see. and and I built complexes in
[57:02] my life and I I struggled for the
[57:05] longest time with certain family members
[57:08] because of of stuff that I had had done
[57:11] years ago. And every time I was around
[57:13] them, I I wondered, do they love me? And
[57:16] h have they forgiven me? And I built
[57:19] complexes and it it affected my
[57:20] marriage. It affected my ministry. It
[57:24] affected my my Christian walk because
[57:26] every time I was around these
[57:27] individuals, I didn't know Yeah.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; You know what fixed it?
[57:33] It was me going to God and telling him
[57:36] my fears.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; And you know what's crazy? I This
[57:40] happened when I was 12 years old. And I
[57:42] struggled
[57:43] with this complex until I was 30 years
[57:46] old.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; And on the way back from the Ohio youth
[57:50] camp, the person that I wronged back
[57:52] when I was 12 gave me a call and he
[57:54] says, "Brother Kobe, I just wanted to
[57:55] let you know that I forgive you." Oh my.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; After 20 something years of wandering in
[58:02] my mind, let me tell you something.
[58:03] Complexes and pain, it's a burden. It's
[58:06] a weight.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm the only one that's that's
[58:10] dealt with this in my life. It's amazing
[58:13] when you expose that problem and you
[58:16] truly accept forgiveness for yourself,
[58:19] how much of a load comes off.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we go so far and things are
[58:32] going well and then suddenly our
[58:34] adversary reminds us of what somebody
[58:37] did to us and and how that affected us.
[58:41] And since we're humans, how many human
[58:43] tonight?
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We're not aliens, we're not
[58:45] robots, we're human. So we got emotions,
[58:48] we got feelings. Ain't that right? And
[58:50] and since we're human beings, we can
[58:53] forgive. But sometimes it's hard to
[58:55] forget. And because of this, things can
[58:58] resurface
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and immediately we're disappointed again
[59:03] and and we can't trust anybody. And we
[59:06] begin to question everybody's
[59:08] Christianity. But God is saying tonight
[59:10] that I can heal those hurts.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; I I I can bind up those wounds. I I can
[59:15] help you get over it. First, we must
[59:17] surrender our pride and say, "God, I
[59:19] need help.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I can't do this on my own. I I I need
[59:24] something that's beyond my abilities
[59:27] &gt;&gt; and my capabilities. Oh my.
[59:31] You love him tonight.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[59:40] We can come to church and I hope this is
[59:42] okay tonight. I know it's a little
[59:44] slower for a Wednesday night.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Good. Very good. But we can come to
[59:47] church and we can bask in the presence
[59:50] of the Lord and sometimes we can feel
[59:54] his presence and mistake that for
[59:55] healing.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; We allow our victory to to fall on the
[1:00:00] flesh and the spirit, man, but never
[1:00:02] down to the soul. And that's why many of
[1:00:05] us are are on roller coasters. Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; We're good one moment and we're down the
[1:00:10] next. And we're here. We're great. We're
[1:00:12] on top of the mountain, but by
[1:00:13] Wednesday, we're back down in the valley
[1:00:15] again. It's because we're we've never
[1:00:17] allowed God to really have his perfect
[1:00:20] work in our life. Because if we truly
[1:00:23] had an experience with God and we truly
[1:00:26] have victory, then no matter the
[1:00:28] obstacle or the circumstance that we're
[1:00:30] dealing with, he gets praised in in the
[1:00:33] valley and on the mountain top.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost that goes beyond the
[1:00:38] flesh and and the spirit down to the
[1:00:40] soul. It's that inner man that governs
[1:00:43] the emotions.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That no matter how you're feeling,
[1:00:47] you're praising the Lord anyway. No
[1:00:49] matter if you're sick, you're still
[1:00:50] praising him for his healing.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. It's It's the roller
[1:01:00] coaster syndrome that we can get
[1:01:02] sometimes.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; The preachers know that's right.
[1:01:05] Preaching on a Sunday, you feel like
[1:01:07] you're sitting on cloud nine and then
[1:01:09] Monday comes around and you're down in
[1:01:11] the dumps again.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. I Amen. But brother Brandham
[1:01:17] continues on with this story and he's
[1:01:19] talking to this this this that twin girl
[1:01:21] in the in the insane asylum and he says,
[1:01:24] "I keep talking to her. Oh, but the
[1:01:27] grace of God, oh my." He said, "Just in
[1:01:30] a few moments, the Holy Spirit began to
[1:01:32] move in." And I said, "Margaret, you
[1:01:35] don't know me." But I said, "All your
[1:01:37] life since you've been big enough to
[1:01:39] know about boys, you've always had in
[1:01:41] your mind you're going to marry a
[1:01:43] preacher."
[1:01:44] He says, "You wanted to marry a
[1:01:46] preacher." And she smiled. He said,
[1:01:48] "That caught." C. And I said, "Thus
[1:01:51] sayaith the Lord, it is over."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; identifying the problem. It's amazing
[1:01:59] how quick you can get your victory when
[1:02:01] that problem's identified.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Psalms 100 or Psalms 39 verse1.
[1:02:09] I found this out. You'll never get over
[1:02:11] something
[1:02:13] until you bring it to God. God knows
[1:02:16] your problems,
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; but we have to step out and give it to
[1:02:20] God. Amen.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Psalms 39:1 says,
[1:02:26] "I said I will take heed in my to my
[1:02:28] ways that I sin not with my tongue and I
[1:02:30] will keep my mouth with a bridal while
[1:02:33] the wicked is before me. I was dumb with
[1:02:36] silence. I held my peace even from good
[1:02:38] and my soul stirth. My heart was hot
[1:02:40] within me. While I was mused and the
[1:02:43] fire burned and then I spake with my
[1:02:46] tongue." And I believe what he's saying
[1:02:47] here is is is holding on to hurt. It's
[1:02:50] like carrying coals in your heart.
[1:02:52] You're the one that's going to get
[1:02:53] burned. Is that right? And and a hidden
[1:02:55] wound when you try to stuff them down,
[1:02:57] they don't heal. They fester.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And and pushing hurt aside doesn't get
[1:03:03] rid of it. It it makes it feel worse.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; People deal with things or hurts in
[1:03:13] different ways. And some people try to
[1:03:16] forget it. And some people turn to to
[1:03:19] drinking and drugs and relationships.
[1:03:21] Some turn their back on God and question
[1:03:24] what they believe. And people do things
[1:03:26] differently, but none of them work.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; And somewhere it's going to have to be
[1:03:31] dealt with. If I can say this, hurt
[1:03:33] people hurt people.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hurt people hurt people. When a person
[1:03:41] is hurt so deeply, they they built that
[1:03:44] emotional raw around that area because
[1:03:47] they don't want to be hurt like that
[1:03:48] again
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; and they put defenses around that hurt.
[1:03:52] It's called the defense mechanism. And
[1:03:54] you watch an individual and that's been
[1:03:57] hurt in the past. And you watch them,
[1:03:59] they're happy, they're sociable, they're
[1:04:01] they're lifting their hands in church
[1:04:03] and all of a sudden something triggers
[1:04:05] what they've been through in the past
[1:04:06] and all of a sudden that that person
[1:04:09] changes. Come on.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; Someone that was once happy is now
[1:04:12] depressed. Someone that was once a
[1:04:14] social butterfly is now a recluse.
[1:04:17] They're the pulling away from church
[1:04:18] gettogethers. If I can say this,
[1:04:22] if Satan can get you isolated,
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; that is the worst thing for somebody
[1:04:27] that's dealing with problems in their
[1:04:28] life is to isolate yourself from the
[1:04:31] flock, from the herd.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Isolation is the enemy's number one
[1:04:35] tool.
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:38] Yeah.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; They don't visit family anymore. When
[1:04:44] they come to church, they're no longer
[1:04:45] allowing themselves to be free in
[1:04:47] worship.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And when a person is going through this,
[1:04:50] they they they something triggers in
[1:04:52] their mind. I've been there. I've done
[1:04:54] it. They run to a place that makes them
[1:04:57] feel safe for the moment. And you may
[1:05:00] run to addictions. I know I did.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Run to addictions that that gives you
[1:05:04] temporary peace.
[1:05:06] Ain't that what addictions are? They
[1:05:08] they make you feel good for the moment,
[1:05:09] but they don't show you the aftermath of
[1:05:12] what these addictions can do to you.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. They don't show you
[1:05:16] what drugs can do to an individual. They
[1:05:18] don't they they make you feel good for
[1:05:20] the moment.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Alcohol makes you forget the pain for a
[1:05:24] moment, but you don't see the after
[1:05:26] effect of it. If I can say this,
[1:05:27] pornography makes you feel good for the
[1:05:29] moment.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; But it destroys your families. It
[1:05:33] destroys your life. Come on.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And we live in a society that wants a a
[1:05:39] temporary fix for the moment. They they
[1:05:41] want to feel good for the moment. They
[1:05:43] don't care about the consequences.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; They want to make themselves feel good
[1:05:48] for the moment.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; So, they run to a place that makes them
[1:05:52] feel safe. Drugs helps you forget your
[1:05:55] problem. Alcohol drowns it out. You run
[1:05:58] to habits. They they make you feel safe
[1:06:00] no matter the outcome. They they run to
[1:06:02] the shell but when they feel pain
[1:06:08] if I can say this.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; This is called a split condition.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; It's when you haven't fully given it to
[1:06:19] God yet. You want to move on with God
[1:06:21] and and you want to do things with God,
[1:06:23] but you still have this over here
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and you think, "Well, if it doesn't work
[1:06:26] out with God, well, I can go back to
[1:06:28] this."
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Yeah. Come on.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Having a relationship with the Lord
[1:06:33] requires us to fully trust in God.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; And if you don't fully trust in God, you
[1:06:40] will go back to the conditions that you
[1:06:42] do trust.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Peter dealt with this split condition.
[1:06:46] He he he dealt with a rejection complex.
[1:06:50] How many people here tonight love being
[1:06:52] rejected?
[1:06:54] Wow. We all want to be accepted. We all
[1:06:57] we all want to feel good around people.
[1:06:59] And we can see how Peter he was zealous
[1:07:02] for the Lord
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; and and Peter he loved the Lord.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; He makes the statement that wherever you
[1:07:08] go I will go Lord if you die I will die.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But in the moment of weakness still
[1:07:15] understand that Peter is dealing with a
[1:07:17] rejection complex.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't want to feel rejected. He
[1:07:21] wanted to be accepted. So in a moment of
[1:07:24] weakness,
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; come on. standing by that fire, what
[1:07:28] happens?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; He denies the Lord.
[1:07:33] Peter went to a condition that made him
[1:07:36] feel safe.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; He ran to this split condition, this
[1:07:40] other identity called Peter the
[1:07:42] fisherman that didn't know Christ.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Because he wanted to be accepted. But
[1:07:48] get this. On the day of Pentecost, what
[1:07:50] happened? No longer is Peter hiding from
[1:07:53] Christ and denying Christ, but he comes
[1:07:56] out with the boldness saying this is
[1:07:58] that
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; and courage took over.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; My
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; But did that take away all of Peter's
[1:08:07] insecurities?
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Just because you have the Holy Ghost
[1:08:12] doesn't mean you are free from hurts.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; You could be saved and still have wounds
[1:08:17] and hurts that God has to deal with from
[1:08:20] your past.
[1:08:22] Amen. There's a process that a computer
[1:08:24] goes through when it crashes. It's
[1:08:26] called the rebooting process. And what
[1:08:29] it does, it refreshes all of the system
[1:08:32] memory, making it uh uh uh ready for
[1:08:35] them to start over again. It makes
[1:08:37] everything look good. It makes it look
[1:08:39] clean. But if you have a piece that's in
[1:08:42] the motherboard that's toxic, no matter
[1:08:45] how many times you reset that computer,
[1:08:47] until you change the piece in that
[1:08:49] motherboard, it will always continue to
[1:08:52] go back to its faulty settings again.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; So what they got to do is they got to
[1:08:56] take this computer and and and they
[1:08:58] unplug it and they get to the
[1:09:00] motherboard and you will find things in
[1:09:02] there called discs. They are called
[1:09:04] cache memories. I hope this is making
[1:09:06] sense.
[1:09:07] Once you replace the faulty piece, the
[1:09:09] computer will start working the way it's
[1:09:12] supposed to.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; They say the mind is like a computer.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; They say the average human brain has the
[1:09:20] ability to store the equivalent of 2.5
[1:09:24] million gigabytes of digital memory.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; That's a lot. That's a lot of good.
[1:09:31] That's a lot of bad. And why is it that
[1:09:33] the bad always outweighs the good? Why
[1:09:36] is it that Satan wants to come in there?
[1:09:38] He don't come when you're strong.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; He comes when you're vulnerable and weak
[1:09:42] and he attacks you in your weakest
[1:09:44] moment because he ain't stupid.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; He knows that he can't attack you at
[1:09:48] full strength.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; But he waits when you when you're having
[1:09:52] a moment dealing with the kids or or or
[1:09:55] dealing with the husband. And and if I
[1:09:57] can say this, I have a lot of respect
[1:09:59] for you mothers.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; That's good. I know my wife seen what
[1:10:03] she deals with with four kids plus me,
[1:10:05] so five kids and a house and and
[1:10:09] everything that she has to go through.
[1:10:11] You know, I'm a I'm a person that hates
[1:10:13] redoing things twice.
[1:10:15] I hate getting a job done and having to
[1:10:17] go back and and move something. My wife
[1:10:19] says, she tells me, "At least you get a
[1:10:21] break from your job." She has to deal
[1:10:23] with the same thing over
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; and over and over. And I I can only
[1:10:28] imagine how heavy a weight must be.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; I I honestly am surprised. It has to be
[1:10:35] God's grace that she hasn't broken down
[1:10:37] yet.
[1:10:38] I'm a handful. I am a handful.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; But it's in those moments of weakness
[1:10:49] that Satan will try to bring up
[1:10:51] something from the past and and try to
[1:10:53] trigger a pain. Even for the husbands
[1:10:55] that that has the the burdens of dealing
[1:10:57] with family and you're you have to deal
[1:10:59] with the finances and you got to be the
[1:11:01] provider and it's in those moments when
[1:11:03] nothing's working right and the bills
[1:11:05] are due and and it feels like you're all
[1:11:07] alone.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Why is it it's in those moments when we
[1:11:11] have to deal with suicidal thoughts?
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Why is it in those moments? Hello
[1:11:15] somebody. Am I the only one in here
[1:11:17] that's had to deal with this in my life?
[1:11:20] Come on.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; So, we can store
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; a lot of bad and good in our in our in
[1:11:28] our in our memories. And it's in this
[1:11:30] moment of pain, Satan, he comes in and
[1:11:33] he changed out a a good piece with a
[1:11:35] faulty.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; So, when you come to church and you're
[1:11:38] in the presence of the Lord, you you get
[1:11:40] the reboot that you so desperately need
[1:11:42] and you feel good and you feel clean and
[1:11:44] you're like, "Yes, I feel awesome. I I
[1:11:47] feel great." But then something triggers
[1:11:49] an emotion or a feeling or or a pain and
[1:11:52] then you're going back to that faulty
[1:11:54] setting again. And then you come back
[1:11:56] and you get rebooted only to fall back
[1:11:59] to that faulty setting again.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; We all need a good rebooting and a a
[1:12:05] daily a refreshing daily. Paul says, "I
[1:12:08] die daily,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; but we need the great physician
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; to come perform surgery on our heart and
[1:12:15] take away that toxic piece and give us a
[1:12:18] brand new heart again."
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; He can take the hurts.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Do you love him tonight?
[1:12:36] But only God can refresh your heart. I
[1:12:39] know this is simple. My
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; good
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; just from my heart tonight.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; But if God doesn't replace that toxic
[1:12:49] peace, there will always be a signal
[1:12:52] that tells you you ain't loved.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; You ain't accepted.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; You're not wanted.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; You'll never be enough. You'll never be
[1:13:00] the husband that you need to be. You'll
[1:13:02] never be the father that you need to be.
[1:13:03] You'll you'll never be the mother that
[1:13:05] you need to be. You you'll never be a
[1:13:07] you're not you'll never be a a young
[1:13:08] person like you need to be. And let me
[1:13:10] tell you something. If Satan is battling
[1:13:13] you, telling you you're not good enough,
[1:13:14] that is a lie from the pits of hell.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; You are good enough. You are loved. I'm
[1:13:19] telling this to the young people and
[1:13:20] maybe you adults as well. But
[1:13:24] God cared so much about you that he left
[1:13:26] the splenders of heaven. Came down and
[1:13:29] died so he could redeem you back to
[1:13:31] himself again.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Come on.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; That ought to tell you something. That
[1:13:37] you are loved, that you are wanted, and
[1:13:39] that you have been accepted again.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to that filth.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; My But you must come to God with
[1:13:50] complete honesty.
[1:13:52] Say, God, I
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; I need your help.
[1:13:58] I need your help, Lord.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:14:01] I'm almost done.
[1:14:05] If not,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; bitterness,
[1:14:08] resentment will take over your life.
[1:14:12] Bitterness is poison.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Bitterness doesn't just affect you, but
[1:14:18] it affects everyone else around you.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And if you're not careful, if you have a
[1:14:23] family, it will poison your spouse. It
[1:14:27] will poison your children.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It will poison a church. Bitterness will
[1:14:33] destroy your life. It will choke the
[1:14:36] very joy that you have in your life. You
[1:14:39] must release bitterness. I fought
[1:14:41] bitterness.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; I fought bitterness being a a pastor's
[1:14:47] son and seeing the things that were said
[1:14:49] and the actions that were taken against
[1:14:51] my father. I was never involved. But
[1:14:54] somehow
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; it caused resentment.
[1:14:59] And I always look to that individual
[1:15:01] differently.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; I always look through eyes of hate. I
[1:15:03] always look through eyes of bitterness.
[1:15:05] I I always look through eyes of of
[1:15:07] contentment against that person. Every
[1:15:09] time you see them, you just you want to
[1:15:11] walk the other way. You you just have
[1:15:13] such hatred toward them.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; That's what Satan does. He can take
[1:15:17] something so small,
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; so insignificant that the other person
[1:15:21] might not even know they've done
[1:15:23] anything to you
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; and it can cause it to become a major
[1:15:28] blow up. Come on now.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You got to be careful. Romans says here
[1:15:34] in 12 and 2 says, "Be not conformed to
[1:15:37] this world, but be transformed by the
[1:15:40] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:15:42] what is good and what is acceptable and
[1:15:44] perfect will." Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; of God. You say, "Brother Kobe, how?"
[1:15:50] First, you have to start by asking God
[1:15:52] to heal your memories.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; I wish I can have all the bad taken out.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; I wish I can go to my wife and take all
[1:16:01] the bad out that I've ever done.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; A lot of times, Brother Ben, I wish I
[1:16:06] wasn't an idiot.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I was an idiot.
[1:16:13] But you got to ask God to heal those
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; those memories. Say, Lord,
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; take out the bad.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you do it? You got to you
[1:16:22] got to start getting your mind off Fox
[1:16:23] News. And you got to start getting your
[1:16:25] mind off sports. And you got to start
[1:16:27] you got to get your mind off the things
[1:16:29] of this world and begin to read God's
[1:16:31] word a little bit more.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. and and play the message of the
[1:16:35] hour a little bit more and take those
[1:16:37] negative thoughts that you've been
[1:16:39] dealing with and replace it with more
[1:16:40] positivity.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. Take those thoughts and
[1:16:44] those feelings because if it's left up
[1:16:46] to the human ability, we would never
[1:16:48] forgive.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; We would never let go. We would hold it
[1:16:52] on. But God being at the center of the
[1:16:54] hill, it's him.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; It's God betraying his love through you.
[1:16:59] It's not me able to forgive my neighbor
[1:17:01] or or my wife able to forgive me of of
[1:17:04] my hurts and the pain that I caused.
[1:17:06] It's God through my wife.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; If it was left up to her, she would have
[1:17:12] already left me.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. We've been married for
[1:17:16] almost 15 years. Thank God for that. But
[1:17:19] it was God that kept us together.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Not my own abilities.
[1:17:25] But if I can ask this, how's your prayer
[1:17:27] life?
[1:17:29] Oh my.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; How's your Bible reading?
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; If I can ask this, brother Ben, I may
[1:17:36] have to step down here a little bit, but
[1:17:38] how's your attendance to the house of
[1:17:40] God?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; How's your attendance to the house of
[1:17:46] God?
[1:17:47] What are you allowing in your life?
[1:17:49] Because what you allow in your life, if
[1:17:51] it's negative, it will fuel that hatred.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; It will fuel that pain.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:17:59] When you're wanting to put out a fire,
[1:18:00] you don't throw gasoline on it.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You use water to get the fire out. Ain't
[1:18:05] that right? And when you're wanting to
[1:18:07] deal with things in your life, you use
[1:18:09] the word of God.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to skip through some of
[1:18:12] this here.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't matter who you are or or
[1:18:16] where you've been. It doesn't matter the
[1:18:18] scar. It it doesn't matter the sin. It
[1:18:20] doesn't matter how you fell. Somewhere
[1:18:22] along the way, there's healing for your
[1:18:24] life. you you can be healed of your
[1:18:26] broken heart and your bitterness and
[1:18:28] your memory and your damaged
[1:18:29] self-esteem. It can be erased here
[1:18:31] tonight.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live a defeated life.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; My father
[1:18:41] was a good man, but he was a hard man.
[1:18:45] You know, all know my dad.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Great guy. But as a a kid, he came out
[1:18:50] of Pentecost and he believed in the belt
[1:18:55] and because of it.
[1:18:58] Yeah.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; I dealt with a lot of pain complexes.
[1:19:06] Being a pastor's kid, I had to always
[1:19:08] share my father. And you know, you
[1:19:11] pastor's kids know
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; seemed like he was always with somebody
[1:19:15] else or always had somebody else's kid.
[1:19:17] And being a young man, always in
[1:19:20] trouble, I got hurt at a young age.
[1:19:25] And if I can just tell my testimony, I
[1:19:26] hope that's okay tonight.
[1:19:29] I got addicted to pornography at 9 years
[1:19:32] old,
[1:19:34] trying to find a a place to to run away
[1:19:38] from the hurt and the pain. And because
[1:19:41] I I didn't feel loved and I I I I didn't
[1:19:44] feel even though I was I had great
[1:19:46] parents, but when I got married, I
[1:19:49] didn't know how to love.
[1:19:52] So I I would
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; and because of it, I couldn't love her
[1:20:02] and the pain I caused,
[1:20:05] the agony that I caused. And because I
[1:20:08] wasn't delivered from my addiction,
[1:20:10] every time I I I felt hurt, I ran back
[1:20:13] to the place I felt safe.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Dealt complexes with my father. Never
[1:20:20] fell in love with him. and even get
[1:20:22] delivered from c certain things and
[1:20:24] still it the complexes affected my my
[1:20:27] ministry. It affected everything around
[1:20:29] me.
[1:20:33] And brother Ben, I I never understood
[1:20:34] why I couldn't get over it. I never
[1:20:36] understood why I couldn't find a a a a a
[1:20:39] freedom with my father. And I realized
[1:20:41] that it was something that I kept a hold
[1:20:45] of in my childhood
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; from 9 years old being hurt. Maybe your
[1:20:50] parents were perfect. Maybe maybe you
[1:20:52] guys are perfect here tonight. But for
[1:20:54] me as a a young child, it affected me.
[1:20:56] And because of this complex, it affected
[1:20:59] every decision that I ever made
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; through life.
[1:21:06] And it took something
[1:21:09] really major to get my attention.
[1:21:13] And making up with my father, my father
[1:21:15] didn't even realize that I was still
[1:21:17] hurt from that. didn't even realize.
[1:21:21] And when we came together and we fixed
[1:21:23] and resolved that issue, you know what
[1:21:25] happened? It took that burden off.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Thank the Lord.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; It took the complexes that I was
[1:21:35] fighting in my own life with my ministry
[1:21:38] and my worship leading and different
[1:21:40] things that I've dealt with. It took the
[1:21:43] the barrier off of that. Oh my. I I wish
[1:21:46] I could get you to understand that you
[1:21:48] don't have to deal with those complexes.
[1:21:52] You don't have to be bound down with
[1:21:54] that. The addictions that you may have
[1:21:56] faced year after year after year,
[1:21:58] there's a healing for every wound here
[1:22:00] tonight. You can have those chains
[1:22:02] broken here tonight.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; God can take the hurt, but are you
[1:22:08] willing to give it to him? Are are you
[1:22:10] willing to say, "Lord, I release it." Oh
[1:22:12] yeah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we get too content or too
[1:22:17] comfortable in the condition that we're
[1:22:19] in. We're okay with the problems that we
[1:22:22] had year after year. I don't know about
[1:22:23] you, but I got tired of carrying that
[1:22:26] weight year after year after year after
[1:22:29] year. And I had to realize that Kobe
[1:22:31] Martin needed help
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; or I'm going to lose my family.
[1:22:45] got to the point in my life to where I
[1:22:47] was going to end my life. I was done
[1:22:51] like Laura, I
[1:22:53] can't do this.
[1:22:56] It's amazing when you let go what God
[1:22:59] can do.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. It's amazing what
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:23:09] My
[1:23:12] as my my family comes to get ready to
[1:23:15] sing.
[1:23:19] Brother Brandham says this here.
[1:23:23] Oh Christ of God, many things have
[1:23:25] happened since those days. Many have
[1:23:28] seared the conscience of people and it's
[1:23:30] caused disappointments and everything.
[1:23:31] But father, he says, I pray that you'll
[1:23:34] brush back every scar tonight
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; and you heal every
[1:23:39] broken heart. He also says here, may it
[1:23:42] be that this place will always have
[1:23:44] miracles and signs and wonders. May the
[1:23:48] anointing of the high priest with oil,
[1:23:51] may you come to soothe every broken
[1:23:53] heart. But when our Lord puts his chains
[1:23:56] of love around your heart and he pulls
[1:23:58] you from the ditch of sin, he heals
[1:24:00] every broken heart and he takes away the
[1:24:03] sin. Oh my. No matter how bad you're cut
[1:24:06] up and how bad you're bruised,
[1:24:10] how your family has done or what you've
[1:24:12] done, there's no bill to it. He heals
[1:24:14] the heartaches and he takes away all the
[1:24:17] sorrows.
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I came across this story here. And it's
[1:24:22] a little lengthy, so bear with me as
[1:24:23] we're getting ready to turn it to them
[1:24:25] here tonight. Says, "Rico balanced
[1:24:30] the bowl in her tiny hand as she carried
[1:24:32] it to the kitchen.
[1:24:34] It was her mother's favorite, a a white
[1:24:36] bowl with tiny blue blossoms
[1:24:39] painstakingly painted up the sides.
[1:24:42] Her mother only brought it out on the
[1:24:44] most special occasions.
[1:24:47] Alongside the gold platter her father
[1:24:49] had created, Rico loved to run her
[1:24:52] fingers over the slightly worn edges
[1:24:55] as she listened to the stories about
[1:24:57] their family in Japan, dreaming of all
[1:25:00] the hands through which this bull had
[1:25:02] passed.
[1:25:04] Her
[1:25:06] favorite story was where God restored
[1:25:08] her family after they had been separated
[1:25:10] during the war
[1:25:13] and their joy of being reunited after
[1:25:15] being so brokenhearted it was tangible
[1:25:17] even to her. Today was her mother's
[1:25:20] birthday which Rico thought qualified as
[1:25:23] a special occasion.
[1:25:25] This 5-year-old girl I climbed the
[1:25:27] cabinets and brought out the dish all on
[1:25:29] her own. She couldn't wait to fill it
[1:25:32] with her mother's favorite treats and
[1:25:33] present it to her.
[1:25:35] Rico's foot caught on the edge of the
[1:25:38] kitchen rug and she stumbled.
[1:25:41] And the floral bowl slipped from her
[1:25:43] fingers. I crashed against the tile
[1:25:46] floor.
[1:25:48] The bowl laid in shards at her feet and
[1:25:51] wrinkles sank down to her knees.
[1:25:54] Gingerly picking up a brokenhearted
[1:25:56] piece, she began to cry.
[1:25:59] A warm hand rested upon her shoulder.
[1:26:02] Blurry through the tears, Rico saw her
[1:26:04] grandfather's wrinkled face and kind
[1:26:07] eyes staring down at her. She said, "I
[1:26:09] tried to be so careful.
[1:26:12] I just wanted to do something special
[1:26:14] for my mama's birthday.
[1:26:16] Now it's broken and I can't seem to fix
[1:26:18] it." "No." Her grandfather's voice sued
[1:26:22] her. But I know someone who can. Here,
[1:26:26] help me pick up the pieces. Oh my.
[1:26:29] Rico and her grandfather set each piece
[1:26:32] on a tray and carried them out to the
[1:26:34] gar garage where her father worked on a
[1:26:36] project.
[1:26:38] Her face palled with fear, worrying that
[1:26:40] her father would be upset that she had
[1:26:42] broken her mother's favorite bowl.
[1:26:45] Instead, he smiled at her and wrapped
[1:26:47] his daughter in a hug. Then he picked up
[1:26:50] the broken pieces and examined them,
[1:26:52] saying, "What do we have here?" She
[1:26:54] says, "I broke mama's bowl." Well then,
[1:26:57] her father spoke, rolling up his sleeve.
[1:27:00] We will fix it, but it won't be the same
[1:27:03] as it was before. It will be even
[1:27:05] better.
[1:27:07] And Rico watched and wonder as her
[1:27:09] father, a talented artist, mixed a
[1:27:12] golden lacquer with a few scoops of rice
[1:27:15] flour to make an adhesive.
[1:27:17] He placed the broken shards of the bowl
[1:27:20] together with the glue.
[1:27:23] And she watched in amazement as the bowl
[1:27:25] took shape. gold gleaming from the
[1:27:27] cracks. Her father had been right.
[1:27:30] Somehow it was more beautiful than it
[1:27:31] had ever been in the first place.
[1:27:35] This technique is called kinugai in
[1:27:38] Japan. Her father explained as he
[1:27:40] worked. It's believed that when broken
[1:27:43] items are repaired with gold or silver
[1:27:45] like this, that the flaw becomes a
[1:27:48] unique piece of the object's history
[1:27:51] and the uniqueness adds to its beauty.
[1:27:55] But papa, there's a missing piece. Her
[1:27:57] fingers traced an empty hole where a a
[1:27:59] harpshaped shard was missing. Can Sue
[1:28:03] got to fix that? He said, "That's all
[1:28:05] right. I I make a new one." And he
[1:28:08] crafted a golden heart from the dust and
[1:28:11] filled the space where it glowed.
[1:28:14] "I've never seen anything so beautiful,"
[1:28:16] Rico exclaimed as her fingers collapsed
[1:28:18] over her heart. "But won't mama be mad?"
[1:28:22] Her grandfather who had been watching
[1:28:24] from a nearby stool shook his head.
[1:28:27] There will be things in our life that
[1:28:30] will break no matter how careful we are.
[1:28:34] And just like this bull, but that
[1:28:37] doesn't mean that they cannot be fixed.
[1:28:40] What was once broken can now become
[1:28:44] something beautiful. Listen to these
[1:28:47] words.
[1:28:52] You are the healer,
[1:28:59] the healer of my heart. Oh yes,
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; you are the maker and the God of all we
[1:29:12] are.
[1:29:21] I was the broken
[1:29:28] vessel in your hand.
[1:29:34] You looked beyond the hurt and made me
[1:29:39] whole again.
[1:29:45] A healer of the broken pieces.
[1:29:52] You touched my heart and made it new.
[1:30:00] And now my whole life I surrender. Lay
[1:30:04] it down before the mener. Lord, I give
[1:30:09] my life to you.
[1:30:14] The love that sought before I knew you
[1:30:22] has brought me near to where you are.
[1:30:29] And now my whole life I surrender.
[1:30:34] Now I live to praise you, the healer of
[1:30:39] my heart.
[1:30:41] [Music]
[1:30:48] Nothing compares Lord
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; to knowing you
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; and seen just what the grace of God it
[1:31:07] can do.
[1:31:17] Faithfully you sought me.
[1:31:24] You called me your own.
[1:31:31] You made a way to bring this wondering
[1:31:35] heart back home.
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:42] the healer of the broken pieces.
[1:31:48] [Music]
[1:31:49] You touched my heart and made it new.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; And now my whole life I surrender. I lay
[1:32:01] it down before the mener. Lord, I give
[1:32:05] my life to you.
[1:32:11] The love that sought before I knew you.
[1:32:18] It's brought me near to where you are.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; And now I live to praise you ever. May I
[1:32:32] praise you, the healer of my heart.
[1:32:37] heart.
[1:32:40] The healer of the broken pieces.
[1:32:47] You touched my heart and made it new.
[1:32:54] And now my whole life I surrender. I lay
[1:32:59] it down before the mener. Lord, I give
[1:33:03] my life to you.
[1:33:09] Love that saw before I knew you.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; It's brought me near to where you are.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And now I live to praise you. Ever may I
[1:33:29] praise you, a healer of my heart.
[1:33:36] Hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; You see, Brother Colby, I have been
[1:33:40] hurting.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I have been broken.
[1:33:45] I've been carrying this around for so
[1:33:47] long. Well, he's here tonight. I know it
[1:33:50] was a chopped up message, but I pray you
[1:33:52] got the point that he can heal every
[1:33:55] hurt tonight. No matter how big it may
[1:33:58] feel or how small,
[1:34:02] God can heal every broken heart here
[1:34:04] tonight. And not only does he take the
[1:34:06] broken pieces, but he makes it better
[1:34:08] than it was before.
[1:34:11] Say, how many can say, "I I need that
[1:34:14] healer tonight. I know my hands raised.
[1:34:16] I need that healer." Heavenly Father,
[1:34:19] you see the hands
[1:34:21] that were raised around this building.
[1:34:23] Lord, while your presence is here,
[1:34:26] God, you know every hurt and every pain
[1:34:29] that's in every individual. Lord, I wish
[1:34:32] we lived in a world where we were never
[1:34:35] hurt, never broken. But Lord,
[1:34:39] we don't. We live in this world, Father,
[1:34:42] that we deal with the hurts, the words
[1:34:46] that have been said, actions that have
[1:34:47] taken place. But Lord, there's a a whole
[1:34:50] building full of honest people tonight
[1:34:52] that have raised their hands and they're
[1:34:54] saying, "I need that healer.
[1:34:57] I need that healer to come by my way."
[1:34:59] And I pray tonight, Lord, while you're
[1:35:02] here,
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; to stop at every aisle,
[1:35:06] stop at every heart, Lord,
[1:35:10] from the back to the front here, Lord,
[1:35:12] from the youngest to the oldest. And I
[1:35:14] pray tonight
[1:35:16] that you take the burden, Lord, take the
[1:35:20] pain,
[1:35:22] take the anxiety, Lord, whatever it may
[1:35:24] be tonight.
[1:35:26] [Music]
[1:35:28] Pick up the broken pieces, Lord. It may
[1:35:31] be a marriage. I'm asking that you'll
[1:35:33] restore it. It may be father against son
[1:35:36] or mother against daughter. Whatever it
[1:35:38] may be, Lord, restore it.
[1:35:41] Pick up the broken pieces like only you
[1:35:43] can.
[1:35:46] Lord, you've done it in my life. I was
[1:35:50] broken and shattered.
[1:35:53] But Lord, I know if you can do it for
[1:35:55] me, you can do it for these people
[1:35:57] tonight.
[1:35:59] We love you, Lord.
[1:36:01] We thank you for it.
[1:36:04] Oh, something

[1:57:06] I'm no longer a slave
[1:57:10] to fear.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I am a child
[1:57:18] of God.

[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Why don't we thank him tonight for the
[1:57:48] grace that you have
[1:57:51] given us?
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you for this Wednesday night
[1:57:54] service, Lord. Though I thank you for
[1:57:57] touching the hearts of the people from

[1:58:55] given us.
[1:58:59] Though I can't repay from my heart, I'd

[1:59:35] like to say that I
[1:59:39] I thank
[1:59:41] you. Can we give him a hand clap of
[1:59:43] praise tonight? Paul, do you love him?
[1:59:47] Amen.
[1:59:49] Amen. We're going to let you be
[1:59:52] dismissed, but not from his presence
[1:59:54] tonight. If you want to stay in worship,
[1:59:56] you're welcome to do that. I just felt
[1:59:58] his presence so real here tonight.
[1:59:59] Excuse
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:10] [Music]
[2:00:13] me just a minute.
[2:00:18] [Music]
[2:00:24] I know where brother Col's coming from.
[2:00:29] I struggle with some of those things
[2:00:30] myself. And I guess as a
[2:00:33] pastor's son and been raised in the
[2:00:35] message and I know many of you have been
[2:00:38] involved in ministry and been around
[2:00:40] that and you don't know the brokenness
[2:00:41] that
[2:00:43] can come sometimes when we're trying to
[2:00:45] do what's right and trying to do what's
[2:00:47] good and yet we don't take enough time
[2:00:48] for our families or we don't realize
[2:00:51] some things that have happened and
[2:00:57] [Music]
[2:00:59] I just, you know, always wanted to put
[2:01:01] God's people first, but God's people are
[2:01:03] my family, too, and I'm one of his
[2:01:05] people, and we we just But he's the only
[2:01:09] one that can heal that. And there's
[2:01:11] broken places. I appreciate Brother
[2:01:12] Colby being so vulnerable tonight
[2:01:15] because every one of us are being
[2:01:17] healed.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; we're on a journey to the fullness of
[2:01:21] our adoption.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. We believe this is the age of
[2:01:24] adoption, but we're on a journey to the
[2:01:27] fullness. These bodies haven't been
[2:01:29] saved yet, but they can be healed.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:34] These spirits can be healed.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful.
[2:01:40] And the more brokenness it seems like
[2:01:42] that you go through with a Kobe and the
[2:01:43] more things you have to deal with, it
[2:01:45] seems like it gives you a heart for the
[2:01:46] people. And you just there's something
[2:01:48] precious that comes out of that. the
[2:01:50] ability to It's one thing to have an
[2:01:52] ability to sing or an ability to preach
[2:01:54] or an ability to to pastor even or
[2:01:56] something. It's another thing to to be
[2:01:59] able to feel what people are going
[2:02:01] through. And I'm so glad the Bible says
[2:02:03] we have a high priest
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; that was touched
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; by the feeling of our infirmities
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; that no matter what you're going
[2:02:12] through, Jesus knows about it and
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; he's able to take it. And
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad for that tonight?
[2:02:19] forgive me for being a baby. Just really
[2:02:21] touched my heart tonight. I I don't
[2:02:24] remember when I've felt that just as
[2:02:26] real as I did tonight. That just that
[2:02:29] openness and we're human beings as
[2:02:32] ministers. We're human beings. We people
[2:02:34] need to know that. And we we needed a
[2:02:38] savior. I'm so glad I found one.
[2:02:41] Needed a healer. I'm so glad I know one.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't God good to us tonight?
[2:02:48] Amen. Just as a way. Hallelujah. Let's
[2:02:51] pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:02:54] so thankful to be in your presence
[2:02:56] tonight on a Wednesday night. And
[2:02:59] Lord, every once in a while, we just
[2:03:01] need to break through. And we need a
[2:03:04] service where we just lay ourselves bare
[2:03:06] before you and say, "Lord, we need you."
[2:03:10] Lord God, I pray that this tonight would
[2:03:12] be that night, Lord, for each one of us,
[2:03:14] Lord, that we'd go from here. And Lord,
[2:03:16] I want to worship you like never before.
[2:03:18] I I want to love you like never before.
[2:03:21] I want to I want these chains that have
[2:03:23] held me for so long to be broken from my
[2:03:26] life. I pray that would be so in every
[2:03:28] heart. And Lord, may the healing
[2:03:29] continue, not just tonight, but all
[2:03:32] through the week and over the weekend,
[2:03:34] Lord. And I pray, God, that you would
[2:03:36] just continue to move and speak to every
[2:03:38] heart. I know you touched some lives
[2:03:40] tonight and I thank you for that. I
[2:03:43] thank you, Lord. As a pastor, I know
[2:03:44] some of the things that goes on and I
[2:03:47] I'm just so thankful, Lord, that you
[2:03:49] spoke directly to some people tonight. I
[2:03:52] pray that they would receive it. I know
[2:03:53] I've received something myself and thank
[2:03:56] you for that, Lord. Thank you for your
[2:03:58] Holy Spirit that's come down and spoken
[2:04:00] to us. Pray you bless Brother Colby and
[2:04:02] Sister Mary and their family. Strengthen
[2:04:05] them, Lord, and help them on the
[2:04:07] highways and things. I pray you bless
[2:04:08] their ministry in the church there, our
[2:04:10] sister church there in Pony. I pray
[2:04:12] you'd bless them abundantly in Jesus
[2:04:15] name. Amen. You're welcome to go. You're
[2:04:18] free to stay in worship.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:21] It's already done.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:29] It's already done.
[2:04:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:04:36] The battle is over.
[2:04:40] The victory is won.
[2:04:43] It's all ready.
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:50] Oh, the word has been revealed.
