[44:00] many left just a very few I'm thankful I
[44:02] got to meet some of them but for my
[44:04] children and you know if the Lord
[44:05] carries a few more years there won't be
[44:06] any left and what are we going to do
[44:08] then well we just have to believe the
[44:10] word and believe what God Said and
[44:13] believe what God has done and so I think
[44:15] it's it's a testing time that we're
[44:17] living in for sure the Bible says
[44:20] everything that can be shaken will be
[44:23] shaken and remember that includes
[44:26] everything in our lives but if the Lord
[44:28] builds the house amen nobody can tear it
[44:30] down aren't you glad for that today amen
[44:34] glad I'm I'm one of those that cannot be
[44:36] shaken and trust that all of us are
[44:39] Revelation 71 after these things I saw
[44:42] four Angels standing on the four corners
[44:43] of the Earth holding the Four Winds of
[44:46] the earth that the wind should not blow
[44:47] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[44:50] tree you believe God's got control over
[44:53] everything know these winds are the
[44:55] Winds of War
[44:57] the winds would not blow on any sea or
[45:00] on any tree I saw another Angel ascend
[45:02] from the East having the Seal of the
[45:03] Living God he cried with a loud voice to
[45:06] the four angels to whom it was given to
[45:07] hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt
[45:10] not the Earth neither the sea nor the
[45:11] trees till we have sealed the Servants
[45:14] of our God in their foreheads and I
[45:18] heard the number of them which were
[45:19] sealed there were sealed of
[45:23] aund
[45:24] 144,000 of all the tribes of the
[45:28] children of Israel I pray the Lord would
[45:31] add his Blessing to the word you may be
[45:37] seated in 1954 on his way to India for a
[45:41] meeting brandom stood in the airport in
[45:44] Cairo with a ticket in his hand to go to
[45:46] Jerusalem and show the sign of the
[45:49] Messiah in that
[45:51] country and show them that God still had
[45:54] prophets and that a prophet prophets uh
[45:56] still saw visions and just like Bible
[45:59] days again which we experienced and he
[46:02] was headed that direction and the Holy
[46:04] Spirit said no that it isn't time yet
[46:08] because and then later on he finds out
[46:10] well that's because there's two prophets
[46:12] going to Israel and it wouldn't be our
[46:15] Prophet at all but it would be two
[46:17] different men that God chooses whether
[46:19] that's Moses and Elijah literally or men
[46:22] with that those Spirits which I tend to
[46:24] think that it will be men with that
[46:26] Spirit on them uh then uh God's going to
[46:29] do that in his own time there will be
[46:32] 144,000 brother BR said that believe the
[46:35] message and uh so but that that time
[46:39] wasn't yet now we know that Israel is
[46:42] God's chosen people how many believe
[46:44] that the Bible teaches that all Israel
[46:47] will be saved Romans
[46:49] 11:26 and so all Israel shall be saved
[46:52] as it is written there shall come out of
[46:54] Zion deliver and shall turn away
[46:56] ungodliness from Jacob and Paul on down
[46:59] verse 28 he said as concerning the
[47:01] gospel they are enemies for your sakes
[47:04] as touching the election they are
[47:06] beloved for the father's sakes verse 29
[47:09] for the gifts and calling of God without
[47:12] repentance God loved them even though
[47:14] they didn't repent I'm going to tell you
[47:16] something now uh God loved you before
[47:18] you
[47:19] repented and one day you realized how
[47:22] much you loved he loved you and that's
[47:23] why you gave your heart to him amen
[47:26] but the gifts and callings of God are
[47:28] without repentance now Paul had preious
[47:31] previously taught that not all Israel is
[47:35] elected right and we we dealt with that
[47:37] in the fifth seal but just to kind of
[47:39] hammer that down because there'll only
[47:41] be 144,000 out of that Jewish Nation but
[47:45] they those 144,000 will be saved as a
[47:48] nation so Romans 9:6 not as though the
[47:51] word of God had taken none effect they
[47:53] are not all Israel which are of Israel
[47:55] neither because they are the Seed of
[47:56] Abraham are they all children he said
[47:59] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[48:01] that is they which are the children of
[48:03] the flesh these are not the children of
[48:04] God but the children of the promise are
[48:06] counted for the seed and we know we're
[48:09] the spiritual Seed of Abraham how we
[48:10] believe that tonight we are the
[48:13] spiritual Seed of Abraham but there's
[48:15] also an elect portion of the natural
[48:17] seed that will be saved as a nation
[48:20] during the time of the Great Tribulation
[48:23] and and so you can kind of look at it
[48:25] there there's an elect Jew and there's
[48:27] also a uh there's also a sort of what we
[48:31] have uh a foolish virgin that will be uh
[48:34] during the tribulation period they'll
[48:36] come during that time that uh uh that
[48:38] have to be purged during that time so
[48:40] the Jews have to be purged but there's
[48:43] also a uh a group of Jews that uh under
[48:47] Hitler and hman and those that were
[48:48] given a white robes PR taught us that
[48:51] that fist seal happens after we leave
[48:55] there already under the altar but they
[48:56] haven't been given white robes yet but
[48:58] as soon as we leave he gives them white
[49:01] robes and what did they do to deserve
[49:03] that well they got
[49:05] killed the Bible said they did hold the
[49:08] testimony uh of uh of what they knew and
[49:11] they and and they believed what all that
[49:13] they knew and that'll be the same with
[49:14] the foolish virgin we'll get into them
[49:17] maybe at some other time but brother
[49:19] brandom deals with uh in the seventh
[49:21] seal deals with this and and so we find
[49:24] the brightest gone the ones that were
[49:27] martyred under Hitler and nightman and
[49:29] all down through uh last 2,000 years
[49:32] actually will be given white robes and
[49:35] then he sends the two prophets to Israel
[49:37] for the day of atonement to get 144,000
[49:40] to 144,000 of the elect Revelation 71
[49:44] let's read that again after these things
[49:46] I saw four Angels standing on the four
[49:48] corners of the Earth holding the Four
[49:49] Winds of the earth wind should not blow
[49:51] on the earth nor in the sea nor in any
[49:53] tree so God now now this is important
[49:56] for right now God allows war and he
[50:00] stops War
[50:03] right and and if this uh is a Prelude
[50:06] what we're seeing to the third world war
[50:08] if it's what it if that's what it is
[50:09] then uh then there'll be nothing that we
[50:11] can do to stop it right it'll just
[50:15] happen right and Wars world wars have
[50:17] been fought over
[50:19] less but if it's not then it it'll just
[50:22] stop right because God holds that god
[50:25] holds the keys to that brandom said that
[50:27] the first world war was a a symbol of
[50:30] that when at the 11th Hour the 11th
[50:32] minute he said 11th day they it stopped
[50:35] and no one knew why it stopped he said
[50:38] hold back the winds because these uh
[50:40] these 144,000 have to be sealed right
[50:44] right and what that means is they have
[50:45] to receive the Holy Ghost so there's
[50:47] going to be a Holy Ghost Church if we
[50:49] could say it that way Holy Ghost bunch
[50:51] of Jews a after we're gone yes right
[50:55] right and and so they they actually
[50:57] received the Holy Ghost and received the
[50:58] message of the hour now uh he said don't
[51:01] hurt the Earth don't hurt the sea nor
[51:02] the trees so we sealed the Servants of
[51:05] God in their foreheads now brother Bram
[51:06] said that's not the bride he said that's
[51:08] servants not the sons servants he said
[51:12] Israel's always been God's servants the
[51:13] church's Sons by birth Israel is his
[51:16] servant and and so in verse four he said
[51:18] I heard the number of them were that
[51:20] were sealed they were sealed 144,000 not
[51:23] one more one less of all the tribes of
[51:26] the children of Israel and so he goes
[51:28] down to the tribes and he says of the
[51:30] tribe of Judah of the tribe of Reuben of
[51:33] the tribe of GAD of the tribe of Asher
[51:36] the tribe of nepalm the tribe of
[51:38] Manasses of the tribe of Simeon the
[51:41] tribe of Levi that's something different
[51:43] we haven't heard of a tribe of Levi
[51:45] before right there are Levites but but
[51:48] here now he calls it the tribe of Levi
[51:51] and of the tribe of issachar were sealed
[51:53] 12,000 the tribe of zebulun were sealed
[51:55] 12 ,000 the tribe of Joseph that's
[51:57] something else that's different from any
[51:59] other place in the Scripture A Tribe of
[52:02] Joseph we sealed 12,000 of The Tribe of
[52:04] Benjamin were sealed 12,000 and and then
[52:08] John goes on in Revelation chapter 7 he
[52:10] sees a great multitude no man can number
[52:13] and those are those who go through the
[52:14] Great Tribulation there's a lot of
[52:16] people out there that are sincere in
[52:18] their beliefs they're going to have
[52:20] those beliefs
[52:21] tested during the Great Tribulation
[52:24] right A lot of people people out there
[52:26] and so it's not just us right there's
[52:29] 144,000 Jews there's a whole bunch but
[52:31] now when it comes to the elect the elect
[52:33] is a small group The elect of the
[52:34] Gentiles and so John sees a great
[52:37] multitude of foolish virgin and then but
[52:40] let's deal with this 144,000 for a while
[52:43] these 144,000 elect Jews are called
[52:45] under the ministry of the two prophets
[52:47] of Revelation 11 brother brandom's not
[52:49] going to come back and preach to them
[52:51] I'm not going to preach to them nobody
[52:53] else going to preach to them it's going
[52:54] to be these two prophets that come and
[52:57] preach to them and we know that uh that
[52:59] what's been going on is God been calling
[53:02] he's been he's been driving the Jews
[53:05] back to their Homeland yes and the fact
[53:08] that we have a Jewish Nation I thought
[53:10] how interesting it was even today our
[53:12] president being in Israel and and
[53:14] talking about the fact that there was a
[53:16] Jewish Nation it's not just a you
[53:18] wouldn't say that about America we're a
[53:20] we have separation of church and state
[53:22] but that is a Jewish Nation right it set
[53:25] up for that purpose because they have no
[53:27] other place to go they got no other
[53:30] they've been run off of every country in
[53:31] the world they've got no other place to
[53:34] be and I think I put a uh something on
[53:37] in here about that but uh but now that's
[53:41] the seven trumpets of Revelation 8 now
[53:43] we know brother brandham God told
[53:44] Brother brandham Don't Preach those
[53:45] seven trumpets you remember he went he
[53:49] was going to preach them he he wanted to
[53:51] preach them God told him not to he said
[53:53] cuz they don't pertain to the church at
[53:55] all but instead he preached the Feast of
[53:58] trumpets and it's a wonderful sermon you
[54:00] ought to listen to it if you haven't
[54:01] heard it in a while because really
[54:03] places brother B looks back at the seals
[54:05] and he said all the mysteries of God
[54:07] were revealed under the seventh seal the
[54:09] Seven Seals
[54:11] now the the seven trumpets of Revelation
[54:14] 8 and then on over uh the seventh
[54:17] trumpet is on over those are to Israel
[54:20] and so Leviticus
[54:23] 23:24 uh let's look at that for just a
[54:25] moment CU there's a feast of trumpets
[54:27] that call Israel to a day of
[54:29] atonement and and I'll say this it's
[54:32] been going on there's a whole lot more
[54:34] going on in the world today than just
[54:37] what we
[54:38] see right God's doing something and that
[54:42] ought to give us courage to understand
[54:44] that God's also working on us he hasn't
[54:47] forgotten us he's doing something for us
[54:49] too as the World falls apart and and
[54:53] they're doing whatever it is that they
[54:54] do but remember that the bride is also
[54:58] uh the God's doing something for her
[54:59] we're fixing to go
[55:01] home excuse me so I hope this doesn't
[55:05] bore you tonight but I just want to
[55:07] teach it to you the best I can and if I
[55:09] get something that you disagree with why
[55:11] you just spit that out because I am
[55:13] fallible and and so if I make a mistake
[55:17] you just correct me later don't do it
[55:19] while I'm
[55:20] preaching
[55:22] right now
[55:25] uh now listen to Leviticus 23:24
[55:28] speaking to the children of Israel
[55:29] saying in the seventh month in the first
[55:31] day of the month shall you have a
[55:32] Sabbath a memorial blowing of trumpets a
[55:35] holy
[55:35] convocation he said and then in verse 27
[55:39] he said also on the 10th day of the
[55:40] seventh month there shall be a day of
[55:42] atonement so here's a blowing of
[55:44] trumpets a feast of trumpets and then a
[55:46] feast of atonement it shall be a holy
[55:49] convocation you you shall afflict your
[55:51] souls and offering uh an offering offer
[55:54] an offer offering made by fire unto the
[55:56] Lord now brother Brandon said the
[55:57] trumpets is to call them back to that
[56:00] atonement he said see the atonement they
[56:03] rejected they rejected so our eyes could
[56:06] be open theirs was closed and during
[56:09] this time these seals opened up and the
[56:11] trumpets blowed he said now in the
[56:13] blowing of the trumpets just before the
[56:15] Messiah comes he said because they've
[56:17] got to be in Palestine Oh my he said you
[56:20] remember God had to harden Pharaoh's
[56:22] heart run them out of Egypt he hardened
[56:25] Stalin muscolini and all that to get
[56:27] them back into the promised land where
[56:29] the
[56:30] 144,000 is supposed to be so what does
[56:34] he do he he he just the Jews come from
[56:36] everywhere to Israel that's why they're
[56:38] there today and brother brandham talked
[56:40] about that how they come out of Iran and
[56:41] all of those countries and now there are
[56:43] almost no Jews in the Middle East except
[56:46] for in Israel there's a reason for that
[56:50] cuz they got run out of every other
[56:52] place but but thank God there's a place
[56:55] for them I don't say this there's a
[56:57] place for us that's in Christ that's our
[57:00] place of safety they found out that
[57:02] their land wasn't as safe as they
[57:04] thought it was and they got to fight a
[57:06] war in their in their safe place and
[57:08] we're fighting a war in our safe place
[57:10] but our our bomb shelter is not concrete
[57:12] our bomb shelter is made out of
[57:15] feathers so it's the promises of God so
[57:18] uh so he gets him back into the promised
[57:20] land where the 144,000 is supposed to be
[57:22] now that's the nation of Israel had to
[57:25] be that that flag had to fly again
[57:28] there's a a three-fold purpose we know
[57:30] to the six seal we went over that last
[57:32] time I think that we taught on this
[57:35] brother R said the first fold was the
[57:36] purging of the sleeping virgin her sin
[57:39] of unbelief and rejecting the message
[57:41] the second was the purging of Israel he
[57:43] said out of the millions that'll gather
[57:45] there there'll be a selected 144,000 and
[57:48] it'll be purged also and then the
[57:50] purging of the Earth for the
[57:52] Millennium and that's from the seven
[57:55] seal where the random actually deals
[57:56] with that and gives a
[57:58] review of that now we know that
[58:01] something's fixing to happen Uh
[58:03] something's fixing to take place where
[58:05] things are moving things are
[58:07] changing and I thought it was
[58:09] interesting today but uh the nation of
[58:11] Israel at some point makes a covenant
[58:14] with the
[58:15] Antichrist now how many realize that
[58:18] they make a covenant they sue for
[58:20] peace right and and that happens now
[58:24] that happens
[58:25] I believe after we're gone now in Daniel
[58:29] 11:21 but but you can see it coming now
[58:32] in Daniel 11:21 it deals with the
[58:34] Antichrist and what he'll do we don't
[58:35] have time to go through all of this but
[58:37] we'll kind of skip through it uh he says
[58:40] in his estate shall stand up a vile
[58:41] person whom they shall not give the
[58:43] honor of the Kingdom but he shall come
[58:45] in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by
[58:48] flatteries and after the league made
[58:50] with him he shall work deceitfully so
[58:53] he'll say one thing and do another well
[58:55] you talk about a politician right there
[58:58] he shall come up he shall become strong
[59:00] with a small people he shall return into
[59:03] his land with great riches his heart
[59:05] shall his heart shall be I'm skipping
[59:07] through this his heart shall be against
[59:09] the Holy Covenant he shall do exploits
[59:12] return to his own land an arm shall
[59:14] stand on his part they shall pollute the
[59:16] sanctuary of strength shall take away
[59:18] the daily sacrifice that tells us that
[59:20] the daily sacrifice has been restored
[59:22] during that time they shall place the
[59:25] Abomination that maketh
[59:27] desolate and such as do wickedly against
[59:30] the Covenant shall be he corrupt by
[59:32] flatteries but the people that do know
[59:34] their God should be strong and do
[59:35] exploits we know that has a an
[59:37] application to us at the end time also
[59:40] has an application to the 144,000 Jews
[59:43] and verse 33 they that understand among
[59:45] the people shall instruct many yet they
[59:48] shall follow by the sword By Flame
[59:50] captivity by spoil many days now I want
[59:53] you to understand nothing like like this
[59:55] is written for the
[59:56] bride there's no scripture that says the
[59:59] bride's going to endure a great
[1:00:00] persecution at the end
[1:00:01] time or or a great uh time of trouble or
[1:00:05] great a Great Tribulation there's no
[1:00:06] scripture for that the only scripture is
[1:00:10] for the Jews and I believe that's what
[1:00:13] brother brandham taught because in when
[1:00:15] it comes to leacy and age he said we're
[1:00:17] you're rich and increase with goods and
[1:00:19] in such an hour as you think not yeah
[1:00:21] then your Lord comes but I'm glad we
[1:00:23] we've been given a window of Prophecy we
[1:00:25] can look and see the time's here it's
[1:00:28] time to get ready it's not time to mess
[1:00:30] around it's time to be serious about
[1:00:32] these
[1:00:33] things so they that understand will
[1:00:36] instruct many yet they'll fall by Flame
[1:00:37] by captivity by spoil and and some of
[1:00:40] them of understanding shall fall to try
[1:00:43] them and to purge to make them white so
[1:00:46] you and I don't have to be made white
[1:00:48] right we're already we already have
[1:00:50] white robes you remember the that's what
[1:00:51] brother Ram taught us we already have
[1:00:54] white robes but they were given white
[1:00:55] robes and these gained their uh their
[1:00:58] white robes by being purged during this
[1:01:00] tribulation period he said even to the
[1:01:03] time of the end because it is yet for a
[1:01:04] time appointed now we know that we're
[1:01:07] building up to all of this now we see
[1:01:09] Jerusalem compassed with armies and
[1:01:13] that's from the scripture in Luke 21:20
[1:01:15] when you should see Jerusalem compassed
[1:01:17] with armies know the Desolation there of
[1:01:18] his n now brother Brandon said that that
[1:01:20] was literally fulfilled with Titus the
[1:01:23] Roman general Titus when he come in and
[1:01:26] those who were forewarned weren't
[1:01:28] there and the same thing's going to
[1:01:30] happen at the end time by the way when
[1:01:32] the tribulation period hits those who
[1:01:35] are forewarned won't be here that's us
[1:01:40] those who took a oh my took Jesus at his
[1:01:44] word they left he said don't remember he
[1:01:47] said don't uh pray that your flight not
[1:01:49] on the Sabbath day why cuz not one
[1:01:51] Christian was slaughtered not One True
[1:01:53] Believer was slaughtered during that
[1:01:54] time because they all left because they
[1:01:56] had the warning ahead of time so now uh
[1:02:00] but Roman uh the Roman general come and
[1:02:02] Compass Jerusalem with armies but now
[1:02:04] brother brandham says he said watch this
[1:02:06] closely he said you can see the
[1:02:08] difference he said I believe that
[1:02:09] Jerusalem will be compassed about with
[1:02:12] armies again at the end time we know
[1:02:15] that's coming there's going to come a
[1:02:17] time when every nation of the earth
[1:02:19] including this one is going to come
[1:02:21] against
[1:02:22] Israel and when they do
[1:02:25] huh we come back from the waiting supper
[1:02:29] and and the Lord fights for
[1:02:32] Israel right so that's during that
[1:02:34] tribulation period so we know that's
[1:02:36] going to happen as of right now we're
[1:02:39] standing with Israel so we know that
[1:02:41] we're you know but we're you see how
[1:02:42] quickly that could change look what
[1:02:44] happened this morning Hamas said oh
[1:02:46] there's a hospital been
[1:02:48] struck right by Israel and all the
[1:02:51] nations of the world condemned it
[1:02:52] immediately immediately they condemned
[1:02:55] it and then by this afternoon or
[1:02:56] sometime today we found out it wasn't
[1:02:58] Israel at all it was Hamas that did it
[1:03:01] to
[1:03:02] themselves now why why would they do
[1:03:04] something like that because uh they're
[1:03:07] turning public opinion one day it'll be
[1:03:10] completely
[1:03:12] turned right now and they're not above
[1:03:15] lying about it right aren't you glad we
[1:03:17] serve a God always tells the truth you
[1:03:20] want to know what the truth is you can't
[1:03:21] find on CNN or on Fox or anywhere else
[1:03:24] on the internet you find it in the word
[1:03:26] of
[1:03:27] God so now we see a prefigure of this a
[1:03:31] a covenant would be made uh we find uh
[1:03:35] uh Biden in Israel today and I thought
[1:03:37] it was interesting that America's First
[1:03:39] Catholic President is visiting Israel
[1:03:42] during a time of War it's the first time
[1:03:44] an American president has visited Israel
[1:03:46] during a war time and he's a Catholic
[1:03:49] all the things that need to be present
[1:03:52] at the time of that uh I'm not saying
[1:03:54] this is it I'm saying that all the
[1:03:56] parties that need to be present were
[1:03:58] present today that's right for that at
[1:04:00] for that Covenant to be made the
[1:04:03] Catholic Church the
[1:04:06] Jews and America those are the those are
[1:04:09] the ones that make a covenant now we
[1:04:12] know that uh because brother bandam said
[1:04:14] it would be a it would be they make a
[1:04:16] covenant of money and but we know that's
[1:04:19] coming church we know it's coming now
[1:04:22] America's uh First Catholic President
[1:04:25] was there today now when those armies
[1:04:27] surround Jerusalem are defeated at the
[1:04:29] end of the tribulation the remnant of
[1:04:31] the 144,000 will have a day of atonement
[1:04:34] Zechariah 12:10 I don't pretend to
[1:04:36] understand exactly how this will work
[1:04:39] but when they see him come back when
[1:04:43] they see him now it says I will pour
[1:04:46] upon the house I don't know if they'll I
[1:04:48] I don't know exactly how that will work
[1:04:49] I don't want to speculate he said I will
[1:04:52] pour upon the House of David and upon
[1:04:53] the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[1:04:55] of Grace and of Supplication they shall
[1:04:57] look upon me whom they have pierced they
[1:05:00] shall mourn for him as one mourneth for
[1:05:02] his only son shall be in bitterness for
[1:05:04] him as one that is in bitterness for his
[1:05:06] first born brother brand said now he's
[1:05:09] speaking here of the remnant The Siege
[1:05:11] of Jerusalem the beasts and the armies
[1:05:13] is took away and so forth all things are
[1:05:15] become to the end now he said this is
[1:05:17] almost to the Millennium fixing to start
[1:05:19] the Millennium right now on that day of
[1:05:21] atonement is now uh reason I got
[1:05:24] thinking about this brother steuart
[1:05:25] asked me a good question the other day
[1:05:27] brother steuart if you're listening uh I
[1:05:29] told him something that I no longer
[1:05:31] believe after studying this but uh he
[1:05:35] asked me said will 144,000 will they all
[1:05:38] be killed uh during this time and at the
[1:05:42] time I've always thought they would be
[1:05:44] because he said your brethren have to be
[1:05:45] killed like you were right but some of
[1:05:48] them will be killed everything I can
[1:05:49] find some of them will be killed and not
[1:05:52] all of them and reason I say that
[1:05:54] because there's always a Remnant there's
[1:05:56] always a Remnant there's a remnant of
[1:05:57] Jews that come and there's got to be
[1:05:59] somebody there's got to be somebody
[1:06:02] populating the Earth other than us
[1:06:03] during the
[1:06:05] Millennium right because at the end of
[1:06:06] the Millennium they turn
[1:06:09] against right the nations of the Earth
[1:06:11] turn against Christ again and during the
[1:06:15] Battle of Gog and MOG so I believe that
[1:06:17] there's a Remnant believe there's a
[1:06:18] remnant of the foolish version a remnant
[1:06:21] of the 144,000 but you can take that
[1:06:24] believe it but these are the the quotes
[1:06:26] that I found about that he said he's
[1:06:28] speaking of the remnant he said this
[1:06:31] this covenant made with the Jews would
[1:06:33] probably be a money Covenant with Rome
[1:06:35] in America brother brand said that might
[1:06:37] not be so he said brother Ben why do we
[1:06:39] not know well there's so many things we
[1:06:41] don't know because we're not going to be
[1:06:43] here that's right right and brother
[1:06:45] Brandon was not the prophet to the Jews
[1:06:48] he was a prophet to the
[1:06:50] Gentiles so this would be a probably a
[1:06:54] money Covenant he said but I that may
[1:06:56] not be so he said see I know they'll
[1:06:57] break it he said but I don't know what
[1:06:59] reason because it's not revealed to me
[1:07:01] about what they'll do now uh there will
[1:07:04] be 144,000 Jews with the Seal of the
[1:07:07] Holy Ghost two prophets leading them and
[1:07:09] during that time the temple is rebuilt
[1:07:10] and sacrifice is allowed again and
[1:07:13] brother BR said now watch set up and set
[1:07:15] up to this he said the daily worship and
[1:07:17] sacrifice will come back into the city
[1:07:19] when the temple is rebuilt this Prince
[1:07:22] is to come in the middle of this week
[1:07:23] will break his Covenant and do away with
[1:07:25] the sacrifices he said he'll scatter it
[1:07:27] what he'll do it'll last on until the
[1:07:30] consummation this is during the time
[1:07:31] when the two prophets are killed
[1:07:33] resurrected and taken up right they're
[1:07:36] killed their dead bodies are left lying
[1:07:38] in the street all the nations of the
[1:07:40] world rejoice and then they're
[1:07:41] resurrected right in front of the people
[1:07:43] you talk about miracles there's Miracles
[1:07:45] coming but this nation has seen its last
[1:07:48] sign brother BR said the Pentecostal
[1:07:51] church was looking for great signs and
[1:07:52] wonders and it's all it was passed he
[1:07:54] said is to the Jews but we're we're
[1:07:57] right at the end what are we looking for
[1:07:59] a Rapture we're going
[1:08:01] home so this is the time when the two
[1:08:04] prophets are killed resurrected taken up
[1:08:07] and Revelation 11:12 they heard a great
[1:08:09] voice from Heaven saying un them come up
[1:08:10] hither ascended up to heaven in a cloud
[1:08:12] their enemies beheld them in the same
[1:08:14] hour there was a great earthquake I
[1:08:16] wonder if that might be that Earth
[1:08:18] California earthquake I don't know he
[1:08:20] said there was a great earthquake in the
[1:08:21] 10th part of the city fell and in the
[1:08:22] earthquake we're saying the men 7,000
[1:08:24] The Remnant were frighted and gave glory
[1:08:27] to the god of Heaven notice there was a
[1:08:30] Remnant and so there's got to be
[1:08:32] somebody Liv during the Millennium now
[1:08:34] just a little while brother Brandon said
[1:08:36] we'll be summoned I love the way he sums
[1:08:37] this up in future home he said just a
[1:08:40] little while we'll be summoned yes amen
[1:08:44] he's just going to say come home it's
[1:08:46] time come
[1:08:47] home amen then the Rapture will come he
[1:08:51] said just a little bitty group like
[1:08:53] Enoch will be Tak taken up in the
[1:08:55] remnant of the woman seed that keep the
[1:08:57] Commandments of God Jews he said have
[1:08:59] the testimony of Jesus Christ Gentile
[1:09:01] was two groups he said we'll be hunted
[1:09:03] down like dogs and shall give their life
[1:09:05] for their testimony and one great
[1:09:07] morning the break of the Millennium for
[1:09:09] the honeymoon will start then the rest
[1:09:11] of the Dead Liv not till the end of the
[1:09:13] Thousand Years then he said at the end
[1:09:16] of the Thousand Years there was a
[1:09:17] judgment he said showing that ham was in
[1:09:20] the ark and ham is still there in the
[1:09:23] remnant so there's a Remnant and a
[1:09:25] remnant of a Remnant because 144,000 are
[1:09:28] the remnant of of of Israel and then
[1:09:30] there's a remnant of a Remnant he said
[1:09:32] but H was still in the remnant he said
[1:09:34] ones that heard it and rejected it will
[1:09:36] have to be judged finally the second
[1:09:38] Resurrection the white Throne judgment
[1:09:40] and then the new heavens and the new
[1:09:42] Earth now I want to point your attention
[1:09:44] to something tonight because I I know
[1:09:46] you're looking at this what in the world
[1:09:47] does this have to do with me and and
[1:09:49] really nothing just get
[1:09:52] ready H but but there's a there's a
[1:09:56] reason why brother Brandon points
[1:09:57] something out and it's important so I
[1:10:00] want to kind of turn this as we finish
[1:10:02] up in our last 15 minutes or so this
[1:10:06] evening now in Revelation 7 what we read
[1:10:11] we find that the tribes of Dan and
[1:10:13] Ephraim are missing among the tribes
[1:10:17] right you all know that you know what
[1:10:18] brother Bram taught about that maybe
[1:10:20] some of you don't but Dan and Ephraim
[1:10:22] are missing
[1:10:24] Joseph and Levi are substituted for Dan
[1:10:27] and Ephraim brother Brown said that was
[1:10:30] because the ever remembering God
[1:10:32] remembers every promise of his
[1:10:34] word he remembers the good and the
[1:10:37] bad and the thing is God doesn't let
[1:10:40] people get by with nothing right
[1:10:45] nothing we if we could just understand
[1:10:48] David one time got into a place where he
[1:10:50] felt like the wicked were getting by
[1:10:52] with a lot doesn't it feel like that
[1:10:54] sometimes God's people are under such
[1:10:57] distress and and good people suffer so
[1:10:59] much and and yet evil people don't
[1:11:02] suffer at all seems like they do well
[1:11:04] they just keep doing better and David
[1:11:07] got in that place he said I he said my
[1:11:09] feet stood in Slippery places because he
[1:11:11] started thinking about that he said but
[1:11:13] then I saw their end I saw their end I
[1:11:16] saw I saw what God was going to do see
[1:11:19] God repays everything he don't owe
[1:11:22] nobody nothing he pays to each one their
[1:11:24] debt and each one is judged according to
[1:11:28] their works and I'm so glad to be a part
[1:11:30] of the Bride I'm so glad that I was
[1:11:32] judged here and and I was covered by the
[1:11:35] blood of Jesus Christ my sins were
[1:11:37] washed away done away with not even in
[1:11:40] his mind
[1:11:41] anymore and you're either in that bride
[1:11:43] or you're
[1:11:45] not right I want I want by faith I
[1:11:47] believe I'm in
[1:11:48] it I would never believe anything
[1:11:52] else ever remembering God remembers
[1:11:55] every promise of his word if he
[1:11:56] remembers this a promise that's bad
[1:11:59] he'll remember a promise that's good
[1:12:01] right now any tribe that committed the
[1:12:03] sin of idolatry was to be blotted out
[1:12:05] from from under Heaven idolatry is a
[1:12:07] serious
[1:12:09] thing we don't want to put anything up
[1:12:11] before God we don't worship nothing
[1:12:12] before God Amen Deuteronomy 29:20 is
[1:12:15] where you find that the Lord will not
[1:12:17] spare him he said but then the anger of
[1:12:19] the Lord and his jealous jealousy shall
[1:12:20] smoke against that man all the curses
[1:12:23] are written in this book shall lie upon
[1:12:25] him the Lord shall blot out his name
[1:12:27] from under Heaven the Lord shall
[1:12:29] separate him un evil out of all the
[1:12:30] tribes of Israel according to all the
[1:12:33] curses of the Covenant that are written
[1:12:34] in this book of the law BR said Dan and
[1:12:37] Ephraim did just that under a hypocrite
[1:12:39] of a king in Israel and impostor
[1:12:41] jeroboam wish we had time to go into it
[1:12:44] jeroboam was a paranoid
[1:12:48] Pastor he thought the people were all
[1:12:50] going to go leave him and go off and
[1:12:52] worship in Jerusalem
[1:12:54] because they had a church split and so
[1:12:56] he didn't want them to go to the meeting
[1:12:57] so he said let's set up a different
[1:13:00] Idol let's set up a different Idol he
[1:13:03] was a king not a pastor but you
[1:13:04] understand what I'm
[1:13:06] saying you know sometimes paranoia can
[1:13:11] can lead to a lot of bad
[1:13:14] results so and you find that in First
[1:13:16] Kings 12 he set up Golden Cals and Dan
[1:13:18] and Ephraim Dan and Ephraim were blotted
[1:13:21] out from under the heavens
[1:13:23] now but if you go back oh you imagine
[1:13:27] God you think God
[1:13:30] forgets I think about it all these years
[1:13:33] later we're talking 3,000
[1:13:36] years in between the time when this
[1:13:40] happens and the end times maybe more
[1:13:43] because we don't know exactly when the
[1:13:44] 144,000 will be there all these years
[1:13:47] later he
[1:13:48] remembers that Dan and Ephraim worshiped
[1:13:52] a golden calf
[1:13:54] you think God don't remember your your
[1:13:57] sin needs to be under the
[1:14:00] blood don't think that you're just going
[1:14:02] to get by with it keep on doing it and
[1:14:04] and keep on doing what you're doing
[1:14:05] everything's going to be okay we must
[1:14:07] put our sins under the blood yes it must
[1:14:10] be blotted out or will be blotted
[1:14:13] out we can't go in just on well I've
[1:14:15] been pretty good that don't
[1:14:17] work so all these years later he
[1:14:20] remembers and their names were blotted
[1:14:22] out from under the the heavens but if
[1:14:24] you go and I don't have time to read it
[1:14:26] but if you go to Ezekiel 48 and
[1:14:28] Revelation 14 you'll find them back in
[1:14:30] their original
[1:14:32] order brother BR said that was because
[1:14:34] God rich in
[1:14:37] Mercy oh aren't you glad he's rich in
[1:14:39] Mercy he blotted them out from under the
[1:14:42] heavens but not in the
[1:14:44] heavens they were still the elect yes oh
[1:14:49] God so he blotted them out he takes them
[1:14:51] out from this revival of this 14 4,000
[1:14:54] but in the end they're still there you
[1:14:57] understand in the Millennium they're
[1:14:58] still there in the uh in the
[1:15:01] resurrection whatever the general
[1:15:02] Resurrection they're still there they're
[1:15:04] back in their original order their names
[1:15:06] were blotted out under the heavens not
[1:15:08] in heaven now watch this real close
[1:15:11] before we close the Gentile age is
[1:15:14] different do you realize God deals with
[1:15:17] us
[1:15:18] harsher than he did
[1:15:21] them brother said the Gentile in the
[1:15:24] days of the Holy Spirit he said you
[1:15:26] against that your name was taken
[1:15:27] completely out off The Book of Life and
[1:15:30] could never have forgiveness in this
[1:15:32] world or the world to come he said so
[1:15:35] that's where we
[1:15:37] stand he takes that from Mark chapter 3:
[1:15:39] 28 verily I send you all sins shall be
[1:15:41] forgiven to the sons of men and
[1:15:43] blasphemies whatsoever they shall
[1:15:45] blaspheme he that shall blaspheming
[1:15:47] against the Holy Ghost hath never
[1:15:48] forgiveness but is in danger of Eternal
[1:15:50] damnation so we need to make sure
[1:15:54] we need to make sure make our election
[1:15:55] and calling
[1:15:57] sure we need to be careful what we laugh
[1:16:00] at what we make fun of right right it's
[1:16:04] serious true and there's coming a day
[1:16:07] when The Mercy Seat changes to a
[1:16:09] judgment seat when for the Gentiles you
[1:16:12] understand for the G it's already
[1:16:13] happened in this way that that the
[1:16:16] denominations don't have a seed of Mercy
[1:16:18] anymore but the mercy is found in the
[1:16:20] unveiled word you'll find that in the
[1:16:22] unveil in of Christ and mighty God
[1:16:24] unveiled before us that we we know that
[1:16:27] the access to Mercy has changed in this
[1:16:30] hour You've Got to Believe the full word
[1:16:33] nothing less you can't be you can't be
[1:16:35] saved under anything less than the full
[1:16:37] lamb yes there was a time you winked at
[1:16:39] ignorance but not today but I'm saying
[1:16:42] that not to scare you tonight because I
[1:16:46] I think actually this is is a positive
[1:16:49] thing I think many people don't
[1:16:51] understand it and they think well maybe
[1:16:54] you know I've been had trouble praying
[1:16:55] lately I can't force myself to go to
[1:16:58] church and it feels like it's hard
[1:17:01] anybody ever felt like
[1:17:03] that well the rest some of us are
[1:17:07] honest sometimes you feel lost don't
[1:17:10] you just be I mean I'm just being honest
[1:17:14] sometimes you feel like well maybe God
[1:17:16] dealt with me one day but he doesn't
[1:17:18] deal with me anymore and we don't go by
[1:17:20] feelings we go by faith that's right
[1:17:24] right but but many times well well maybe
[1:17:26] God maybe God dealt with me back then
[1:17:29] but maybe he's quit dealing with me
[1:17:31] maybe I've crossed the line maybe I've
[1:17:33] taken the mark of the beast and didn't
[1:17:35] know
[1:17:36] it now I want to kind of put that out of
[1:17:40] our minds before we go because it's
[1:17:43] important how do I know if I've crossed
[1:17:45] the line is there still Mercy for me I I
[1:17:49] know there's still Mercy for the Earth
[1:17:50] but the brand said there was he said
[1:17:52] don't you ever ever think Mercy's over
[1:17:54] said keep on preaching keep on
[1:17:57] evangelizing right but is there still
[1:18:00] Mercy for
[1:18:01] me now brother brandom talks about
[1:18:04] people during his meetings who've
[1:18:05] crossed the line that that really in one
[1:18:08] place in one quote that I found where
[1:18:10] the said that lady last night said she
[1:18:11] crossed the line yes said that Darkness
[1:18:14] came over and it was her last chance to
[1:18:17] repent it's a serious thing but Satan
[1:18:20] you know his job is to deceive us
[1:18:23] yes that's what he does best so what he
[1:18:25] does is tries to make you think you've
[1:18:28] crossed the line so you won't accept
[1:18:31] mercy so you won't accept judgment how
[1:18:34] do you
[1:18:35] know now brother brandham he's dealing
[1:18:38] with somebody in a prayer line I think
[1:18:40] this is instructive to us before we go
[1:18:42] here I I just felt to do this
[1:18:45] tonight and he talking to somebody who
[1:18:47] felt like maybe they crossed the line
[1:18:49] you know when sometimes people don't
[1:18:51] quit coming to church but they still
[1:18:53] feel like they're just not good enough
[1:18:55] yeah like somehow they've crossed some
[1:18:58] sort of line that God's just never going
[1:18:59] to deal with them like he does everybody
[1:19:01] else because of something that they've
[1:19:03] done or someplace that they've been or
[1:19:06] listen to me he loves you tonight yes he
[1:19:09] wants to deal with you he wants to work
[1:19:10] in your heart he wants to work in your
[1:19:12] family you just got to surrender
[1:19:14] yourself to
[1:19:15] him sir but now but people feel that way
[1:19:20] many times I've felt that way before
[1:19:21] just something you just feel like well
[1:19:23] God hasn't spoken to me in a while I I
[1:19:25] just maybe he don't love me no more he
[1:19:28] does love
[1:19:29] us now brother brand would dealing this
[1:19:31] prayer line he said how do you do sir
[1:19:33] now there's there's something strange
[1:19:34] about you sir Satan has desired to take
[1:19:37] your
[1:19:38] life you're all tore up you think you've
[1:19:41] sended away your day of Grace you think
[1:19:44] your life is ruined and I love how
[1:19:47] simple brother brandom is about this we
[1:19:48] over complicate things don't we we were
[1:19:51] talking about that back in the office
[1:19:52] even with our children many times we
[1:19:54] over complicate
[1:19:56] things look how simple how simple God
[1:19:59] has been dealing with our children and
[1:20:01] wanting to be baptized wan to be right
[1:20:03] with God I said let's just accept the
[1:20:05] Simplicity of
[1:20:08] that but here in this simple way Brother
[1:20:12] bandam Talks to the person he said you
[1:20:13] think your life is ruined do you love
[1:20:16] Jesus what makes you love
[1:20:21] him oh my yeah but I've done this I've
[1:20:24] done that I I feel like I feel like I'm
[1:20:26] just like them Jews I I've been taken
[1:20:28] out from blotted out from under the
[1:20:30] heavens but he still had mercy even on
[1:20:32] them in the end but I realize there's a
[1:20:36] place you can cross the line I realize
[1:20:38] that but do you love
[1:20:40] Jesus if you do you haven't crossed the
[1:20:43] line what what makes you love him he
[1:20:46] said before there could be anything
[1:20:47] there to make you love him there has to
[1:20:50] be a Creator to create the love in your
[1:20:53] heart amen he said is that right if
[1:20:56] you'd send away your day of Grace you
[1:20:59] would hate
[1:21:00] Jesus but you love him and you're all
[1:21:03] right yes amen he said and the devil's
[1:21:07] just lying to you you're nervous he said
[1:21:10] come here I'll cast him away for you if
[1:21:12] you'll
[1:21:13] believe
[1:21:15] Hallelujah brother brandone bowed down
[1:21:17] he prays for the boy and he said ow
[1:21:19] you're all right he said now you can
[1:21:21] raise your head feel all right now son
[1:21:23] is that right Devils he said you you'd
[1:21:25] have committed suicide in a few days he
[1:21:29] said that was on his mind you imagine a
[1:21:32] boy getting that place he think well God
[1:21:34] don't love me no more so much so he
[1:21:35] thought he was going to take his own
[1:21:37] life he said that was on his mind he
[1:21:39] thought he sned away his day of Grace
[1:21:42] don't ever think
[1:21:43] that brother brandom talked about that
[1:21:45] woman in the restaurant you remember the
[1:21:47] story I don't have time to read it all
[1:21:49] brother Brandon talked about that woman
[1:21:50] there was the the bumper of of the blood
[1:21:52] of God he had a vision he saw a woman
[1:21:54] sitting there with policeman gambling
[1:21:56] carrying on smoking and he had the
[1:21:58] vision of of Christ he said there was a
[1:22:01] like a bumper of blood going around the
[1:22:03] earth and every time a one of his sins
[1:22:06] would go up he said it would hit that
[1:22:08] and he would just Flinch he say is that
[1:22:10] the sins of the world he said no that's
[1:22:11] your
[1:22:13] sin every one of us would be lost
[1:22:15] without
[1:22:16] that and so he goes up to the woman it's
[1:22:19] interesting what she said to him because
[1:22:22] she told him she'd been raised in a good
[1:22:23] family she was raised in a Holiness
[1:22:25] Church Wesleyan Church and she was
[1:22:28] sitting there in the restaurant and
[1:22:30] she's gone so far away from the way she
[1:22:32] was raised that she said I and sometimes
[1:22:35] I think our young people feel like this
[1:22:36] because we raise them to to fear God and
[1:22:39] so when they get older and they do some
[1:22:41] things that are wrong and and she said I
[1:22:43] I've send away my day of
[1:22:45] Grace I know that there's people who
[1:22:48] watch these services that used to go to
[1:22:49] church here young people that used to go
[1:22:51] to church here and I know sometimes they
[1:22:53] feel like well I can't ever go back I my
[1:22:55] life's been messed up since I left I've
[1:22:57] done so many things listen he still
[1:22:59] loves you you wouldn't be watching If he
[1:23:02] if he didn't love you you wouldn't care
[1:23:04] if he didn't love
[1:23:07] you he said he told this woman she said
[1:23:10] I've send away my day of Grace I said
[1:23:13] look do you still have respect for the
[1:23:15] Lord
[1:23:17] Jesus she said I do sir I said then he
[1:23:20] hasn't left youen said no he still got
[1:23:23] Mercy for
[1:23:24] you oh
[1:23:27] my yeah I told you this would have
[1:23:29] something to do with
[1:23:31] us see that they Dan and Ephraim crossed
[1:23:34] the line were left out for 3,000 years
[1:23:37] but you haven't crossed the line not if
[1:23:38] you love
[1:23:43] Jesus brother Bram dealt with a man who
[1:23:45] thought he'd cross the line it was that
[1:23:46] man who you remember the story he went
[1:23:48] down to the Baptist church and they told
[1:23:51] him believe take the the preacher saying
[1:23:53] he did that he didn't feel right he went
[1:23:56] down to the Methodist church and they
[1:23:58] told him you need to be Sanctified and
[1:23:59] beat him on the back at the altar and he
[1:24:01] went down there he didn't feel right
[1:24:03] down to the Pentecostal church and they
[1:24:05] told him you need to speak with tongues
[1:24:07] and and you'll be you'll get it you'll
[1:24:08] have the Holy Ghost in and he spoke with
[1:24:11] tongues didn't feel right and they said
[1:24:12] well you must have a devil said you may
[1:24:14] have send away your day of Grace you
[1:24:15] better go to brother brandom and he'll
[1:24:17] He he'll deal with you he's got a gift
[1:24:19] of a prophet oh my yeah he come to
[1:24:23] brother Bram he said brother brandham he
[1:24:25] said I think I've send away my day of
[1:24:27] Grace I just can't feel right he didn't
[1:24:30] ask you if you felt
[1:24:32] it said Do you believe
[1:24:35] it he he said I I just can't feel like
[1:24:37] I'm
[1:24:38] saved and brother brandom told him he
[1:24:41] said you remember when you were at the
[1:24:42] car lot and you picked up that thing and
[1:24:44] said uh where will you spend eternity
[1:24:46] and he said that something struck your
[1:24:48] heart and you began to seek the Lord he
[1:24:50] he said you remember that and he began
[1:24:52] to to talk to him he said then brother
[1:24:54] brandom I've been saved all the time I
[1:24:55] said
[1:24:58] sure look I said do you love
[1:25:01] him he said with all my heart I said one
[1:25:04] time you didn't love him said that's
[1:25:07] right said now you love him he said well
[1:25:09] that's the truth he said well you had
[1:25:12] him all the
[1:25:14] time church it's that simple you say
[1:25:16] have I have I send away my day of Grace
[1:25:19] not if you love him if you love him you
[1:25:22] can you can have the Holy Ghost if you
[1:25:24] love him you can be as much a Christian
[1:25:26] as anybody else Just Surrender yourself
[1:25:28] to him let him in let him in every
[1:25:32] door every one of them don't hold
[1:25:34] anything back when you see these these
[1:25:37] wrecks along the highway it's because
[1:25:39] they held something
[1:25:41] back preachers that that wreck along the
[1:25:43] highway they held something back they
[1:25:45] didn't give him
[1:25:47] everything people that have left and and
[1:25:50] left the message Alto together why they
[1:25:52] didn't give him everything it's time we
[1:25:54] sold out it's time we got
[1:25:57] serious as long as we're here there will
[1:25:59] be Mercy musicians go ahead and come but
[1:26:02] let's get serious about these things
[1:26:04] let's be more
[1:26:06] sincere people are hurting everywhere I
[1:26:09] realize that right now Satan is
[1:26:10] attacking the ministry in this message
[1:26:13] with with all that he's
[1:26:15] got but now's the time to pick up our
[1:26:17] swords and fight that's right I know for
[1:26:20] some faith is being shaken
[1:26:22] but everything that can be shaken will
[1:26:24] be shaken but not those that
[1:26:26] can't Paul says I'm he said I've heard a
[1:26:29] different report of you he said you're
[1:26:31] not of those who go back but of them who
[1:26:34] believe to the saving of the
[1:26:37] soulen some people becoming more and
[1:26:39] more extreme whatever Doctrine whatever
[1:26:42] thing that they believe only those
[1:26:44] planted by the rivers of Living Water
[1:26:47] will not be moved don't you want to be
[1:26:49] one of those man God bless you thank you
[1:26:52] for being patient with me tonight I I
[1:26:54] know it was different could you bow your
[1:26:55] heads with me
[1:26:58] maybe we'll have a
[1:27:00] prayer I don't know maybe those watching
[1:27:03] someone could be benefited by that I
[1:27:05] touch my heart sometimes to
[1:27:07] see people watch
[1:27:09] and people
[1:27:12] come and they don't know what we're
[1:27:14] talking about maybe so maybe some do but
[1:27:17] they just feel like well I just can't be
[1:27:19] a Christian I just can't live it I
[1:27:22] believe you can I believe the blood of
[1:27:24] Jesus is so powerful he can reach down
[1:27:27] where you're at and cleanse you of your
[1:27:30] sin take all the desire to sin out of
[1:27:33] your life make you whole again I believe
[1:27:36] in that kind of a power I believe in
[1:27:37] that kind of an experience I believe he
[1:27:40] he wants to do that for you maybe
[1:27:42] someone's sitting here tonight you're
[1:27:44] dealing with something in your life and
[1:27:46] something in your heart something in
[1:27:47] your body you like prayer let's just all

[1:27:51] Lord will take care of every one of
[1:27:53] those situations amen I I've got things
[1:27:56] I need from the Lord I know there's some
[1:27:58] needs that can't even be spoken that
