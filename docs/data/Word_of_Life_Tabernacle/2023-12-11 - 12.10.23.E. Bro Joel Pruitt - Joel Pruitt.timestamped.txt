[46:45] possible bleeding that they can't find
[46:47] and so uh we want to continue to
[46:49] remember him in prayer I believe God can
[46:52] still heal I don't care how old you are
[46:54] I don't care how young you are don't
[46:56] care who you are God's the Healer you
[46:58] believe that tonight and so I think if
[47:00] we could just join our faith together
[47:02] the doctors won't find nothing because
[47:03] there won't be nothing there and so I I
[47:06] think that's what we want to pray
[47:07] tonight because you know when one is
[47:10] hurting in our family we need to lift
[47:12] him up in prayer we need to pray
[47:14] together pray for one another love one
[47:15] another can you say Amen to that it
[47:17] doesn't really matter you know well I'm
[47:19] not related to him I don't care if
[47:21] you're related or not what we need to do
[47:23] is love one another how do you know love
[47:26] God because you love one another and and
[47:28] and if you love somebody you're going to
[47:30] go before the throne and pray for that
[47:32] person with love in your heart that's
[47:35] right and it's not going to be a cold
[47:36] formal prayer but it's going to be a
[47:38] heart to receive because God God is not
[47:42] the author of confusion he's not the
[47:43] author of hate but he's the author of
[47:45] love and so let's love one another let's
[47:47] pray for one another I think we should
[47:49] do that much more you see the enemy
[47:51] coming in and trying to take young
[47:53] people and old people and every one of
[47:55] us he's coming com after you believe
[47:57] we're in a fight tonight every one of us
[47:59] are dealing with something let's let's
[48:01] let's just go to the father tonight and
[48:03] ask him to take control of the
[48:04] situations around us wonder if we could
[48:07] each bow our heads if there's something
[48:08] on your heart you pray right where
[48:09] you're sitting let's pray together
[48:12] Heavenly Father Lord you see the enemy
[48:14] coming against our brother you see the
[48:16] enemy coming against the bride in this
[48:18] time that we're living in Lord Jesus I
[48:20] pray Lord you would just help us to
[48:22] recognize that there's a land here
[48:24] that's full of promis
[48:26] and all we have to do is cry out to you
[48:28] Lord You're the chief Captain you've
[48:30] never lost a battle you've never lost a
[48:33] war and you're not going to lose one now
[48:35] but Lord we ask Lord that your will
[48:36] would be done in each life that's
[48:38] sitting here today Lord if there's a
[48:40] sick among us someone Among Us Lord that
[48:42] would need a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[48:45] Lord I pray this would be their service
[48:47] we don't want to come Lord just for show
[48:49] or just to just to have another service
[48:51] Lord but I pray you would raise us up to
[48:53] to be more like what you would would
[48:55] want us to be Lord may we reflect you in
[48:58] our everyday lives may we reflect Lord
[49:01] you to our co-workers and the ones that
[49:02] are around us may everything that we do
[49:05] and say Lord in this service and and
[49:07] tomorrow and throughout this week May It
[49:09] Be Something Lord that uh that that that
[49:11] would be pleasing to you Lord may we
[49:13] help somebody else help us to live a
[49:14] life that would that would be worthy of
[49:16] the gospel and I pray you would be with
[49:17] us now be with each one sitting in this
[49:19] service and I ask you would move me out
[49:21] of the way Lord to speak to these people
[49:23] tonight I ask Lord you would just come a
[49:25] special way now we ask in Jesus name
[49:28] amen amen how many's happy to be in the
[49:30] house of the Lord tonight you'll have to
[49:32] forgive me I broke my glasses I can't
[49:35] see most of you so that's good if you
[49:37] don't back me I couldn't tell anyway I
[49:39] can hear though Hallelujah so uh we're
[49:42] going to just get right into the word
[49:43] tonight and if I can see it we'll read
[49:46] it and I I would like to speak tonight
[49:49] this land is worth the fight and I
[49:52] believe that the promises that we are
[49:54] all trying to achieve are here right
[49:58] we're not looking for a promise to come
[49:59] the promises are here we're in the
[50:01] promises of God we're living in the land
[50:02] of promise but you've got to fight to
[50:04] get to them because it it is a time
[50:07] where Satan is trying to take each one
[50:09] of you out this is an age where we're so
[50:11] close to the end that Satan knows if he
[50:13] can't get you that you're going to take
[50:14] a Rapture oh you say the devil don't
[50:17] know that he does know it see he knows
[50:19] it better than you know it and he
[50:20] believes it but he can't live the word
[50:22] of God so what he's trying to do is try
[50:25] to take with him see he he knows he's
[50:27] going to hell he knows where his kingdom
[50:29] is and he's trying to take you with him
[50:31] but I think there's a group of people
[50:33] here today it's a group of people
[50:35] getting ready to leave this world and we
[50:36] need to be in the Battle of a lifetime
[50:38] in the fight for our lives and for our
[50:41] families to not try to stay here and get
[50:43] pulled down by the things of the world
[50:45] but let's press on towards the mark
[50:47] let's keep pressing on keep moving
[50:49] forward Le let's not stay down here and
[50:51] get get tied down by things that would
[50:53] hold you back but let's go ahead just
[50:55] keep fighting the good fight because at
[50:57] the end there's victory for every one of
[50:59] us do you believe it tonight amen if we
[51:01] could go to Ephesians chapter 6 uh it's
[51:04] chapter 6 there brother Robert in verse
[51:06] 10 we're going to go to verse 10 and
[51:09] Paul here is telling us how to get ready
[51:10] for battle and so we just want to uh
[51:14] just set a platform here for a few
[51:15] moments I won't hold you long tonight
[51:17] and Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10
[51:19] says finally my brethren be strong in
[51:22] the Lord can you say Amen to that and in
[51:24] the power of His might put on the whole
[51:27] armor of God that you may be able to
[51:29] stand against the Ws of the devil for we
[51:32] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[51:34] against principalities against Powers
[51:36] against rulers of the darkness of this
[51:37] world against spiritual wickedness in
[51:40] high places wherefore take unto you the
[51:42] whole armor of God that you may be able
[51:45] to withstand in the evil day and having
[51:48] all having done all to stand stand
[51:50] therefore having your loins gir about
[51:52] with truth and having on the breastplate
[51:54] of righteousness and your feet Shaw with
[51:56] the preparation of the gospel of peace
[51:58] and above all taking the shield of Faith
[52:01] how many's going to take that Shield
[52:02] here tonight wherewith ye shall be able
[52:05] to quench all somebody say all the fiery
[52:08] darts of the wicked you say Amen to that
[52:10] tonight if you take on this uh uh take
[52:14] on the shield of Faith you can withstand
[52:16] the fiery darts of the wicked that's
[52:18] coming after you here tonight so and
[52:20] take the helmet of salvation and the
[52:21] sword of the spirit which is the word of
[52:24] God and you can have your seats here
[52:25] this evening and Paul is telling us how
[52:27] to get ready for battle and God here has
[52:31] promised us an inheritance how many
[52:33] knows that y'all are starting off quiet
[52:36] you you pull real fast I'll preach fast
[52:37] we'll get out of here fast at the rate
[52:40] we're going so far it's going to be a
[52:41] long
[52:42] service amen so so we understand if
[52:45] you're getting ready for battle then you
[52:46] know you have an enemy to fight can you
[52:48] say Amen to that you know you've got an
[52:50] enemy now our enemy is not your husband
[52:52] your wife it's not your family your
[52:54] enemy is not your your brother it's not
[52:56] your sister but the enemy is the devil
[52:58] can you agree on that with me the enemy
[53:00] has come in this day but God has promise
[53:03] to raise up a standard now I'd like to
[53:05] show you just by the word who the
[53:07] standard is you know who the standard is
[53:09] in this day it is a bride that has been
[53:12] called out who has withstood a test
[53:14] already and she will be in a squeeze I
[53:16] believe we're in one right now I'm not
[53:18] looking for a squeeze to come but I
[53:20] believe the squeeze is here and you're
[53:21] in a a fight right now and you must
[53:24] learn learn how to fight this fight in
[53:27] order to overcome it because if you
[53:29] don't know how to fight the fight you're
[53:30] going to be lost in battle but if you
[53:32] know how to how to put on the shield and
[53:34] the helmet and and and and G up your
[53:36] loins and and if you know how to fight
[53:38] if you know how to prepare for battle
[53:40] then you know that you can win because
[53:43] you've been given an equipment to win
[53:45] you you've come equipped to the battle
[53:47] and you know what you're going to do see
[53:48] you didn't come to a picnic you came to
[53:50] a Battleground and in this day you're
[53:52] going to find that that the battle is in
[53:54] your mind and the battle the the battle
[53:56] is a is a spiritual battle it is a
[53:58] battle that that if you if you watch
[54:00] closely you'll see that it is a Warfare
[54:02] that is in your mind and and many times
[54:04] there'll be somebody coming to church on
[54:05] a Sunday morning and Satan will put
[54:07] something in there to to make you fuss
[54:09] with your wife or fuss with your husband
[54:11] because Satan doesn't want you to get a
[54:12] blessing from God in that service see
[54:15] that's a battle that you got to fight
[54:17] you may have to fight it every week if
[54:18] you haven't overcome that one yet maybe
[54:20] you haven't overcome the fact that that
[54:22] you just can't get right with God to
[54:24] enter into the service yet maybe you
[54:25] don't know how to worship but you got to
[54:27] fight the devil trying to hold you back
[54:29] from
[54:30] worship you say well I just don't feel
[54:32] like it that's a devil trying to hold
[54:33] you back from the blessings of God
[54:36] anything that is trying to keep you from
[54:37] the promises and the land of promise is
[54:40] the Devil Himself trying to keep you out
[54:42] of the land of promise now remember it's
[54:44] nothing but a scare tactic that is
[54:46] trying to keep you out because Joshua
[54:48] and Caleb would come across the land
[54:50] there and they had already seen God move
[54:52] in mysterious ways and mighty ways and
[54:54] they were following a Vindicated Prophet
[54:56] can you say Amen We are following in
[54:58] this day a Vindicated Prophet we're not
[55:01] looking for a prophet but he's already
[55:03] come and he's already restored the word
[55:05] back to the church so all we have to do
[55:07] is re realize who we are we are a people
[55:10] of the promised land we have already
[55:12] been given the promised land but there's
[55:14] going to be many things that come in our
[55:15] way that is going to try to hinder us
[55:17] from making it there there's going to be
[55:19] Giants in the land there's going to be
[55:21] walled cities in the land there's going
[55:23] to be many things try to stop us from
[55:25] get into the land but greater is he that
[55:27] is with you greater is the pillar of
[55:28] fire that we following than Pharaoh's
[55:30] Mighty Army that all drowned in the sea
[55:32] greater is he that is leading the way
[55:36] and that's what you got to realize the
[55:37] scarecrows are going to come the the
[55:39] trials are going to come the
[55:41] everything's going to come at you why
[55:43] because the devil knows who you are if
[55:45] he's not fighting you then you know
[55:47] you've already lost the battle but if
[55:49] you are in a fight here tonight then God
[55:51] is already trying to show you there is a
[55:53] promised land that you must achieve but
[55:55] you're not there yet but you're on a
[55:57] journey and and I'm going to tell you
[55:59] the promised land is not 40 years away
[56:01] but the promised land is right here
[56:02] tonight if you can accept it you realize
[56:05] that the reason it took so long to get
[56:07] there is because they mured and they
[56:09] complained and because they they didn't
[56:11] recognize it wasn't very far at all they
[56:13] could have made it in just a few days
[56:15] but they couldn't trust God's leading
[56:17] they always had to well the man is not
[56:19] good enough well I say the Mana is good
[56:21] enough the ministry today is not good
[56:23] enough I say the ministry is good enough
[56:25] you say well we just don't have enough
[56:26] we don't have enough people sitting in
[56:27] the pews I I I we need to see a church
[56:29] fold to have Revival Revival starts in
[56:32] you that devil is trying to take you out
[56:35] by trying to get you to look at somebody
[56:36] else and try to focus on your brother or
[56:38] sister but we need to focus on the word
[56:41] of God and the promise that has been
[56:43] given us because the promise said
[56:45] where're two or three are gathered I am
[56:46] in the midst and if he's here tonight
[56:48] it's because his word said he would be
[56:50] here it's not something we have to
[56:52] wonder did God show up at church yes
[56:54] he's here because of Promise did you
[56:56] feel him well he was there anyway see
[56:58] it's a battle of the mind that you've
[57:00] got to fight and overcome and so so in
[57:04] Joshua chapter 1 and we're going to go
[57:06] down at verse five there brother Robert
[57:09] and he says there shall not any man be
[57:10] able to stand before thee all the days
[57:12] of thy life as I was with Moses so I
[57:15] will be with thee I will not fail thee
[57:18] nor forsake thee that's a promise that's
[57:21] a promise you're going to the land and
[57:22] he's not going to fail you he's not
[57:24] going to forsake take you but he's going
[57:25] to stay with you now I'm going to tell
[57:27] you this if you can just accept the
[57:29] promise then you don't have to worry
[57:30] about the Giants in the land Joshua and
[57:32] Caleb didn't look at the size of the
[57:34] walled cities they didn't look at the
[57:36] size of the Giants in the land but they
[57:38] look to the promise of the word of God
[57:40] and I say today if we can look to the
[57:41] promise of the word of God it doesn't
[57:43] matter how you feel it doesn't matter
[57:45] what your body is trying to tell you how
[57:47] sick you are but if you look at the
[57:48] promises of God there's an overcoming
[57:51] people here today that know who she is
[57:53] you have been positioned in the land all
[57:56] you have to do is accept the promises
[57:58] that God has given you be strong in
[58:01] verse six and of a good courage that's
[58:04] what we need here tonight for unto this
[58:06] people shalt thou divide for an
[58:08] inheritance the land which I swear unto
[58:10] the fathers to give them verse seven
[58:12] only be thou strong and very courageous
[58:15] that thou mayest observe to do according
[58:17] to all the law which Moses my servant
[58:19] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[58:21] right hand or to the left that thou
[58:22] mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest
[58:25] do you want to prosper stay with the
[58:27] word it was given to a Vindicated
[58:30] Prophet then and if you stayed with the
[58:31] word you would Prosper if you would stay
[58:34] with the land you if you would stay with
[58:35] the word of God then then then then then
[58:37] the word of God works you believe that
[58:39] the word of God when he promised healing
[58:41] it works but you've got to accept it as
[58:44] a promise you've got to accept accept it
[58:46] as the word of God you can't say well
[58:48] well well I just don't know how to fight
[58:50] this enemy well Paul is telling you here
[58:52] how to fight it you've got to have faith
[58:54] you've got got to believe the word
[58:55] you've got to go into battle prepared
[58:57] for battle because I'm going to tell you
[58:59] when you go out of here on Monday
[59:00] morning every one of you sitting here
[59:02] today are going to fight another battle
[59:04] it's just the way it is because as long
[59:06] as you're here you are in the fight of
[59:08] your life and that's because Satan knows
[59:11] he hadn't got you yet so I I don't want
[59:13] him to quit fighting me but I want to
[59:15] have the courage and the grace to know
[59:18] what I'm fighting against and to be able
[59:20] to know the devil and know his tactics
[59:23] and and recognize him when he comes
[59:24] along so I'll know my enemy I can
[59:27] recognize who he is and then I can fight
[59:29] that enemy when he comes after me you
[59:31] young people Satan's going to come after
[59:32] you in ways that you may not even think
[59:34] of right now but he's going to come
[59:36] after you because see you understand the
[59:38] God of this evil age has gotten greater
[59:40] and greater and if you couldn't see it
[59:42] happening in the 40s and the 50s and the
[59:43] 60s and some of you Elders may remember
[59:45] that in 70s and 80s if you could never
[59:47] see it more plain it's happening right
[59:49] now because you can see that Satan has
[59:52] tried to take over your minds with with
[59:54] with not just television cable
[59:56] television looks really good compared to
[59:58] what we got now we've got so much going
[1:00:00] on now that that that everything we've
[1:00:02] got is to try to attract your minds away
[1:00:05] from the things of God and it it is
[1:00:08] actually a fight that Satan is putting
[1:00:10] out there but he's very he he's very
[1:00:12] Savvy he's very very smart with how he
[1:00:14] takes up your time and he's very smart
[1:00:16] with how he gets you away from the
[1:00:17] things of God he knows if he can get a
[1:00:19] phone in your hand then you can't read
[1:00:21] your Bible anymore he knows if he can
[1:00:23] get a phone in your hand then you won't
[1:00:24] want to pray anymore but see what we do
[1:00:26] is we fight against that I'm not
[1:00:28] preaching against the phone I'm not
[1:00:29] preaching against that what I'm
[1:00:31] preaching against tonight is the devil
[1:00:33] that is trying to distract you from the
[1:00:35] word of God because if he can take one
[1:00:37] thing away from you if he can take your
[1:00:38] helmet away from you he can cut you off
[1:00:41] if he can take away your faith then he
[1:00:42] can he can get a spear into you but if
[1:00:44] you'll take a hold of the spirit tonight
[1:00:46] if you take a hold of the word of God
[1:00:48] tonight no devil in hell is strong
[1:00:51] enough to defeat the army of God yes sir
[1:00:54] right all you have to realize is who you
[1:00:56] are if you know you're in God's Army if
[1:00:58] you know the word of God you've got is
[1:01:00] true then don't look at nothing else
[1:01:03] come on somebody don't look at nothing
[1:01:04] that's trying to distract you but keep
[1:01:06] your eyes focused on Jesus be equipped
[1:01:11] be ready because we wrestle not against
[1:01:13] flesh and blood but against Satan God's
[1:01:15] enemy brother brand says principalities
[1:01:17] and wickedness and evil spirits
[1:01:19] wickedness in high places and we're
[1:01:21] pressing towards the mark of the high
[1:01:22] calling and we are C certainly in a
[1:01:25] battle that's what he said and no Nation
[1:01:28] would dare to send a man on the
[1:01:30] battlefield untrained can you say amen
[1:01:34] he might not only get himself killed but
[1:01:36] he would get another group killed as
[1:01:38] well he he says he doesn't know how to
[1:01:40] take a hold so he must be prepared for
[1:01:43] it and the nations are wise to that so
[1:01:45] they get their men ready every war they
[1:01:48] have a training period the these men are
[1:01:50] not just taken off the street and and
[1:01:53] giv an AK47 or or whatever they use and
[1:01:56] stuck into battle and say hey go kill
[1:01:57] these people first off they might kill
[1:01:59] the wrong man they don't know who
[1:02:01] they're after they don't know the
[1:02:02] purpose of the war they've just been put
[1:02:04] into battle no these soldiers in the
[1:02:06] army of God have got to be trained with
[1:02:08] the word of God to know how to fight the
[1:02:11] devil that is coming against them and so
[1:02:14] brother brandom said usually in the old
[1:02:15] Soldiers when they put on these
[1:02:16] ornaments of War they had a big belt and
[1:02:18] they had buckled it together holding
[1:02:20] over their loins these shields to keep
[1:02:22] the enemy Spears off he said what a real
[1:02:24] lesson that is to us when the lawn begin
[1:02:26] to get weak he said and the shield they
[1:02:28] would tighten it up on their belt
[1:02:30] sometimes you get a you get a little ax
[1:02:32] in your walk and you just get a little
[1:02:33] bit uh you know you just get a little
[1:02:35] bit uh I don't know how you would say it
[1:02:37] but you just kind of get just just kind
[1:02:38] of off to the side and and you get tired
[1:02:40] maybe of the journey and and you're
[1:02:42] sitting there well I just don't know how
[1:02:43] much more I can fight tighten up your
[1:02:45] belt listen to the word of God get in a
[1:02:47] good service somewhere where you can
[1:02:48] really feel the power of God move I mean
[1:02:50] I think it's time that we quit playing
[1:02:51] church I think every service needs to
[1:02:53] have the spirit of of God moving in it
[1:02:55] you say why is that I say because we are
[1:02:57] in a fight now and we need to recognize
[1:02:59] the presence of God it's where souls are
[1:03:01] born again it's where our children can
[1:03:03] come back to the Lord it is recognizing
[1:03:05] your position and in order to do so you
[1:03:07] need to be in the presence of the chief
[1:03:09] Captain who's never lost a battle
[1:03:11] because when he speaks to you it's
[1:03:13] something different than just some man
[1:03:15] speaking to you I can stand here and try
[1:03:16] to tell you something but if God doesn't
[1:03:18] open it to your heart then it won't do
[1:03:20] you any good if God doesn't open your
[1:03:22] heart to Revelation then won't do you
[1:03:24] any good but we've got to March and
[1:03:26] we've got to walk we've already given
[1:03:28] our orders how to March but I think now
[1:03:30] it's time to go ahead and buckle up and
[1:03:32] get your Shield get your helmet get your
[1:03:34] spear I think it's time now that we
[1:03:36] start fighting the greatest battle ever
[1:03:38] fought why because this is the time when
[1:03:41] God knows that there was going to be a
[1:03:43] spirit in the land so he had to have a
[1:03:45] soldier right and so in this time there
[1:03:47] is a spirit now let me tell you what
[1:03:49] that spirit is that we're fighting it is
[1:03:51] a spirit of leosia it is a spirit of
[1:03:53] cold old formal church
[1:03:57] members he doesn't actually care if you
[1:04:00] go to church as long as you don't
[1:04:02] participate in church he doesn't care if
[1:04:05] you go to church as long as you're not
[1:04:07] getting a blessing from God in church he
[1:04:10] really likes it when you go to church
[1:04:11] and you pick on your brother and sister
[1:04:13] because he's using you to seow Discord
[1:04:15] in the body come on
[1:04:18] somebody you say well that hurts but
[1:04:20] it's true he don't care about your
[1:04:22] church going but he does care if you're
[1:04:24] getting a blessing or not now if you
[1:04:27] love God you go to church but just going
[1:04:30] if you're going for the wrong reason and
[1:04:31] the wrong motive that's not going to do
[1:04:32] you any good you've got to fight the
[1:04:35] spirit that is trying to hurt your
[1:04:37] brother and sister and fight against
[1:04:39] that enemy at all times you don't ever
[1:04:41] give up in this battle this is not a
[1:04:43] battle where you take some days off this
[1:04:45] is a full-time battle Satan is every day
[1:04:48] on the trail trying to take your kids
[1:04:50] out what are we giving our kids what are
[1:04:51] we teaching our kids what are we doing
[1:04:53] for them what are we trying to help them
[1:04:55] with do you realize the fight they're
[1:04:56] going to go through when they're
[1:04:57] teenagers do you realize the fight of
[1:04:59] their that that that they're having to
[1:05:00] go through right now in their minds it's
[1:05:02] much worse than even when you were a kid
[1:05:04] or when your grandparents were a kid
[1:05:06] this is not the same time but in this
[1:05:08] time Satan has got worse and worse
[1:05:10] because he realizes there's a spirit of
[1:05:12] Illusion over the people that you don't
[1:05:13] have to worship no more you don't need a
[1:05:15] service where this convicting sermon
[1:05:17] preached anymore but what you need back
[1:05:20] in the Holy Ghost in the church is the
[1:05:21] holy ghost moving on the people again
[1:05:25] it'll take care of the spirits that are
[1:05:27] trying to get in and hurt the
[1:05:29] body so what we need to do tonight is
[1:05:32] realize that we are not fighting each
[1:05:34] other amen right because then you're
[1:05:38] just doing the devil's job for him
[1:05:41] you're fighting each other well you're
[1:05:42] not doing this and I understand that all
[1:05:44] of us have come short every one of us
[1:05:46] are going to make a mistake if you
[1:05:48] didn't make a mistake then you're not
[1:05:49] human welcome Mr Robot you're not W
[1:05:53] you're not you're not you know you're
[1:05:54] not you're not even human you don't even
[1:05:55] know what I'm talking about here tonight
[1:05:57] but if you're human you know that
[1:05:58] there's a battle that you fought before
[1:06:01] yes and you know that there's a battle
[1:06:02] coming brother Bram said you either just
[1:06:05] got out of a battle you're either in a
[1:06:07] battle or you're going to go into a
[1:06:09] battle there's there's not a whole lot
[1:06:11] of room to lay down your lay down your
[1:06:13] armor is there so you got to fight all
[1:06:16] the time a and not not to be just a
[1:06:19] fighter not to be just a you know walk
[1:06:21] around well I I I I you know I'm just
[1:06:22] fighting everybody because this person
[1:06:24] might have had a bad Spirit no no you
[1:06:26] can still have love you can still love
[1:06:27] one another you can still be a Christian
[1:06:30] come on somebody you can still be a
[1:06:32] Christian and fight the devil let's not
[1:06:34] get it twisted up fighting the devil is
[1:06:37] not fighting amongst
[1:06:39] yourselves because it's not really
[1:06:41] important that you're fighting the other
[1:06:42] person's Spirit fight the spirit that's
[1:06:44] trying to come on you or me see if I
[1:06:48] realize I'm getting cold then I need to
[1:06:51] fight that Spirit now when you're
[1:06:52] getting cold you got to fight fight that
[1:06:54] Spirit we can stand up here and preach
[1:06:56] that you need to enter in and accept the
[1:06:58] blessings of God but ultimately you're
[1:07:00] the one that has to make the decision
[1:07:02] I'm going to fight that Spirit of the
[1:07:04] cold Le to see and age just trying to
[1:07:05] overtake me Well I this was on my heart
[1:07:08] I hope it's okay I'm not trying to
[1:07:10] preach to anybody or hurt nobody but I
[1:07:11] just want to tell you this I think we
[1:07:13] need to recognize when you come to
[1:07:14] church we need to enter into the
[1:07:16] presence of God because it may take a
[1:07:18] little bit of a battle to get there but
[1:07:20] it's worth the fight this land is worth
[1:07:23] it
[1:07:24] in that land is where all the promises
[1:07:26] lay in that land is where the healing
[1:07:28] lays in that land is where you can
[1:07:30] possess the goodness of God in that land
[1:07:32] it it may look like it's a walled City
[1:07:34] it may look like the Giants are coming
[1:07:36] but did you know that God has promised
[1:07:38] that land to you and if he promised it
[1:07:40] to you Giants are going to fall then the
[1:07:42] walls are going to fall and God won't
[1:07:44] lose a one of his people that have went
[1:07:46] into into battle with god on their
[1:07:49] side so brother bam goes on down here
[1:07:52] and I'm going to skip a little cuz I'm
[1:07:53] right running out of time but he said
[1:07:55] every man that's born of the spirit of
[1:07:57] God comes into Christ has everlasting
[1:07:58] life and puts on his shield his
[1:08:01] breastplate standing ready and forbidden
[1:08:04] to leave until orders to March oh isn't
[1:08:06] it marvelous he said aren't you glad you
[1:08:08] got all harnessed up tonight You
[1:08:10] Soldiers I can say yes I'm glad I'm
[1:08:13] ready and when I get weak I know that I
[1:08:16] can go back to the word and I can read
[1:08:18] the promises of God and know that there
[1:08:20] that there's somebody with me even when
[1:08:22] I don't feel like fighting some body
[1:08:24] goes before me in
[1:08:26] battle he said now right here he said
[1:08:28] look I'll give it to you the land's over
[1:08:30] there but before you get there you got
[1:08:32] to fight he said that's what's the
[1:08:34] matter with people today you're afraid
[1:08:36] to stand and fight he said what we need
[1:08:40] is I must fight if I should rign
[1:08:42] increase my courage Lord I wonder if
[1:08:44] that's a prayer of ours tonight because
[1:08:46] I think what we've done is we thought we
[1:08:48] could just go through life so easy I
[1:08:51] become a Christian everything's easy
[1:08:54] now well come on somebody anybody here
[1:08:57] ever become a Christian and everything
[1:08:58] just went smooth I question your
[1:09:01] experience if you did that's right I
[1:09:03] tell you why because it's not possible
[1:09:06] if Satan's not fighting you then he's
[1:09:09] already got you so if you're not fight
[1:09:12] so you are fighting if you're here and
[1:09:13] you're a Christian tonight you are in a
[1:09:15] battle that's right you are absolutely
[1:09:16] in a battle now everybody battles
[1:09:18] different things at different times you
[1:09:19] can say well you can preach on this
[1:09:21] battle and this battle and this battle
[1:09:22] but really what you got to recog izes
[1:09:24] you have the authority as a Believer to
[1:09:26] win every battle I don't care what it is
[1:09:28] you put a name on it you have the
[1:09:29] authority to win it he said I'll give
[1:09:32] you this land he said increase my
[1:09:33] courage Lord and he he goes on down he
[1:09:36] says I must fight if I must Reign he
[1:09:37] said oh we're so wishy-washy boneless
[1:09:40] and helpless I'm going to say this
[1:09:41] because brother brandom did spineless as
[1:09:44] worms you know I don't anyway he said I
[1:09:47] think of old buddy Robinson he said he
[1:09:49] got down to the cornfield he said Lord
[1:09:50] if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when
[1:09:51] you come back to earth you're going to
[1:09:53] find a pile of bones laying here he said
[1:09:55] if we ever get to that sincere that
[1:09:57] something's going to happen Lord he said
[1:09:59] give me plenty of knowledge in the Gable
[1:10:01] into my soul let me fight the devil as
[1:10:03] long as I got a tooth in my mouth and
[1:10:05] then gum him till I die I say that's
[1:10:07] what we need to do tonight let's quit
[1:10:09] just laying around letting the devil you
[1:10:11] you realize that the devil is the
[1:10:13] biggest Bluff you got do you realize and
[1:10:15] I've told you this before did you know
[1:10:17] that he knows he's a bluff but he don't
[1:10:19] know that you know you need to know he's
[1:10:21] a bluff you need to recognize that he
[1:10:24] has no power over you he has no
[1:10:26] authority over your life he has no
[1:10:28] authority over your happiness he has no
[1:10:30] authority over your marriage or over
[1:10:31] your children he has no authority over
[1:10:34] you because you're God's children you
[1:10:36] are part of the land that God promised
[1:10:39] well come on somebody you know I I think
[1:10:42] we we get beat down by the devil and we
[1:10:44] let him beat us up and he has no right
[1:10:47] to
[1:10:48] us come on somebody God has given us
[1:10:51] Authority and we allow the devil to do
[1:10:54] what he does because he has no right to
[1:10:56] hurt you he has no right to walk in your
[1:10:59] land he has no right to overtake you but
[1:11:02] God has given you a spirit that is not a
[1:11:04] spirit of fear but is a spirit of
[1:11:06] Victory and I say tonight that we need
[1:11:08] to recognize your Victory recognize your
[1:11:11] freedom know who you are recognize the
[1:11:13] land that God has given you and all the
[1:11:16] promises that are there that that are
[1:11:17] there that it is Faith and it is it is
[1:11:19] love it is Joy it is peace all the
[1:11:21] things that God has given us are in the
[1:11:23] land of promise here today can you say
[1:11:25] amen and so go brother Brandon would go
[1:11:28] on down here he said he said uh he said
[1:11:30] Paul speaking is talking about the
[1:11:31] Battle and he said he said and one thing
[1:11:33] he said Hebrews there he said they was
[1:11:34] talking about a runner and he said
[1:11:36] seeing that we are compassed about with
[1:11:38] such a great cloud of witnesses let us
[1:11:40] lay aside every weight and the sins that
[1:11:42] easily beset us sir he said he's
[1:11:44] speaking he said he's speaking there of
[1:11:47] the Olympics maybe or the Roman circus
[1:11:48] and he said so now he's speaking of
[1:11:50] armored men going into battle and how
[1:11:52] he's got to prepare himself self and he
[1:11:54] said he goes on down here he says and I
[1:11:55] have give you he was talking about the
[1:11:57] land that he gave to him he said he said
[1:11:58] my name is in him but if thou will
[1:12:00] indeed obey his voice and do all that I
[1:12:02] speak then I'll be an adversary to thy
[1:12:03] adversaries can you say amen he said if
[1:12:06] you'll obey his voice he said then I'll
[1:12:08] be an adversary see notice he said I'm
[1:12:10] going to send him now and I'm going to
[1:12:11] give you already he said here it is I've
[1:12:13] give you Palestine it's yours he said
[1:12:15] now it's all fenced in with hivites
[1:12:17] jebusites parasites amorites it's all
[1:12:19] fenced in but I've give it to you it's
[1:12:22] yours come on somebody it's yours he
[1:12:24] said now let's break that down for just
[1:12:26] a moment God didn't say I'm going to go
[1:12:28] give go in there and empty it out for
[1:12:30] you come on now God didn't say I'm going
[1:12:33] to go in there and just make a clean
[1:12:34] land with no no Giants no walled
[1:12:37] cities it it's you know it's just all
[1:12:40] there it's easy just walk over there
[1:12:42] you're not going to be scared because
[1:12:43] there's nothing to
[1:12:45] face but he did he put Giants in the
[1:12:48] land he allowed wall cities to be there
[1:12:50] why because it took somebody that would
[1:12:52] believe the word to go go in there right
[1:12:54] that's a test right there that's a word
[1:12:56] test if you really believe you can speak
[1:12:58] and go over but if you don't really
[1:13:00] believe it the Giants are going to scare
[1:13:02] you Satan's going to Bluff you but you
[1:13:04] got to believe the promises of God he
[1:13:07] said I've give it to you now go fight he
[1:13:08] said there you are God's give you
[1:13:10] healing tonight he said every one of you
[1:13:12] is give you healing it's your possession
[1:13:13] can you say amen he said it's all bound
[1:13:15] down with amorites and Canaanites and
[1:13:17] everything else of unbelief but he said
[1:13:18] go in and take over it's yours it
[1:13:21] belongs to you come on somebody if
[1:13:23] you're dealing with something and
[1:13:24] sickness in your body tonight do you
[1:13:26] realize if you go claim the healing that
[1:13:28] God has already given you that all you
[1:13:30] have to do is possess it claim it and
[1:13:33] take over that part of your body again
[1:13:35] say you know what Satan that's mine God
[1:13:37] gave it to me Satan has no right to
[1:13:40] it he said this is not a picnic it's a
[1:13:43] battlefield not a place where we lay
[1:13:45] back and say Lord you just come force it
[1:13:48] down he doesn't push you in one one end
[1:13:51] of the pipe and pull you out the other
[1:13:52] end where're in a battle that's not the
[1:13:55] way it works he said you're in a battle
[1:13:57] he said no he said you don't do it that
[1:13:58] way God never did it that way he said he
[1:14:01] said there's the land he said and yet
[1:14:02] some of the Israelites when they looked
[1:14:04] at it they said why we can't take that
[1:14:06] why we look like grasshoppers upside of
[1:14:08] them big people but when the spies came
[1:14:10] back there was Joshua and there was
[1:14:11] Caleb and they knew what God had said
[1:14:14] there's the key right there do you know
[1:14:16] what God's word said today have you have
[1:14:18] you recognized the word of God for your
[1:14:20] hour have you recognized your day and
[1:14:22] its message you can take a hold of that
[1:14:24] word of God and take it into your soul
[1:14:27] and it'll it it'll it'll defeat every
[1:14:28] enemy that comes against you can you say
[1:14:30] amen he said why Jericho was so big till
[1:14:33] they could run two chariots around in a
[1:14:35] horse race how can we go in there with
[1:14:36] our little Spears and so forth the gates
[1:14:38] are shut up great men in there look like
[1:14:40] Giants and the Canaanites probably the
[1:14:42] descents of ham he says and he said how
[1:14:44] could we ever go in and take that he
[1:14:46] said they looked at the natural
[1:14:48] part he said how could this woman ever
[1:14:51] walk how could that one how could this
[1:14:52] man ever get out of out of the
[1:14:54] wheelchair how could this man here he
[1:14:55] said he's going to fixing a die in a few
[1:14:57] days with heart trouble he says how
[1:14:59] could he be made well right now he said
[1:15:00] it's unreasonable you can't reason it
[1:15:02] out God hasn't been known isn't known by
[1:15:05] reasons no man understands it you've got
[1:15:07] to accept it by faith and say it so I
[1:15:10] wonder if we could do that tonight quit
[1:15:12] trying to reason out well well this
[1:15:14] sickness here it might be the one that
[1:15:15] takes me out because I don't think
[1:15:16] there's a way for it to be cured or
[1:15:18] healed there is a way it is the promise
[1:15:21] of God that says by his stripes you are
[1:15:24] healed you know this is this is an age
[1:15:27] here if you look back and you realize
[1:15:29] that Joshua and Caleb they didn't have
[1:15:31] the message like you've got yes they had
[1:15:32] a Vindicated Prophet but do you realize
[1:15:34] how many cases of healing that you've
[1:15:36] seen or heard on tape seen on video
[1:15:39] you've you've even known about it right
[1:15:41] here in our local assembly there's
[1:15:42] healing that's taking place there's
[1:15:44] there there's been there's been dead
[1:15:45] raised i' I've known I know him
[1:15:47] personally that have been raised from
[1:15:48] the dead and you tell me God can't do it
[1:15:50] I said he's the same yesterday today and
[1:15:52] forever
[1:15:54] yes sir but see we've got to speak and
[1:15:56] go forward because all those things are
[1:15:59] part of the promised land but the main
[1:16:01] thing is and I hope you get this tonight
[1:16:03] the main thing is to follow the word of
[1:16:06] God for your day because you can see the
[1:16:08] signs you can see the Wonders you can
[1:16:11] understand the first pull second pull
[1:16:12] but you've got to go in where all the
[1:16:14] promises have been made real to you and
[1:16:16] it is the word being revealed to you it
[1:16:18] is you becoming part of the word oh come
[1:16:22] on now
[1:16:23] you becoming part of Christ the word you
[1:16:26] becoming him he became you so that you
[1:16:28] could become him I hope you see that
[1:16:31] tonight and he said Jesus he said he
[1:16:33] said now he's G you the promise it's
[1:16:35] yours every one of you was healed 1900
[1:16:36] years ago when Jesus died at Calvary I
[1:16:39] know there's a whole lot of he said
[1:16:40] Briars growed up in it there's a whole
[1:16:42] lot of Canaanites standing there saying
[1:16:43] days of Miracles has passed there's a
[1:16:45] whole lot of perizzites saying I don't
[1:16:46] believe in them holy rollers but he said
[1:16:48] go in and take it it's yours God give it
[1:16:50] to you it's a promise go on and take it
[1:16:52] anyhow if God said so what do you care
[1:16:55] about the Canaanites come on somebody if
[1:16:57] God said you're healed what do you care
[1:16:59] about that cancer trying to get a hold
[1:17:00] of you what do you care about that heart
[1:17:02] trouble trying to get a hold of you if
[1:17:03] God's the Healer and I say he is tonight
[1:17:06] then recognize him as such and believe
[1:17:09] in the promises of God you say well
[1:17:11] there's been something to get a hold of
[1:17:13] my mind and and Satan has got me on this
[1:17:14] internet program or something let me
[1:17:16] just go ahead and tell you that's the
[1:17:17] devil also and God is greater than that
[1:17:20] enemy trying to take you out amen right
[1:17:25] he said go take
[1:17:26] it brother brandom said there's a
[1:17:28] there's a person here he said but it is
[1:17:30] he said he said but there's Canaanites
[1:17:31] there he said he said those long-faced
[1:17:35] people that say says the days of
[1:17:37] Miracles has passed he said it is for
[1:17:39] them y all right if you say you don't
[1:17:43] believe in the holy ghost moving again
[1:17:45] then the Holy Ghost ain't going to move
[1:17:46] for you if you say you don't believe in
[1:17:49] in in God moving in the church again and
[1:17:50] the Holy Spirit coming in among the
[1:17:52] people and fallen on the people then
[1:17:54] maybe it'll never happen for you but
[1:17:56] there is a people who have not given up
[1:17:58] One Promise who have not laid down for
[1:18:01] one minute and let that devil overtake
[1:18:03] them with that kind of battle in their
[1:18:05] mind he said sure he said it wasn't for
[1:18:07] you it's only for believers that's all
[1:18:09] he said it's not for unbelievers now he
[1:18:11] said go take it he said I'll send he
[1:18:13] said I'll send my angel he will prepare
[1:18:15] the way and he said if you notice when
[1:18:17] they got over there one was looking at
[1:18:19] the material things and the other one
[1:18:21] was looking at the spiritual things the
[1:18:23] promise of God and I'm going to read
[1:18:24] quickly here as we as we get to wrap
[1:18:26] this thing up he said now we're longing
[1:18:28] for somewhere where there's no death no
[1:18:30] sorrow no heartaches no old age we're
[1:18:32] all looking for that place right he said
[1:18:34] that land is somewhere and will never be
[1:18:36] able to achieve it by guns and and
[1:18:38] fighting and so forth of the natural and
[1:18:41] carnal weapon he said but there is a
[1:18:44] land that we can go to and it's a battle
[1:18:46] to get there he said and when he said
[1:18:48] and when God gave Israel Palestine when
[1:18:50] he was in Egypt but he said he had to
[1:18:52] fight for every every inch of it and he
[1:18:53] told Joshua he said wherever The Souls
[1:18:55] of your foot Treads upon that have I
[1:18:57] given you so Footprints was possession
[1:19:00] see he said keep walking I think we need
[1:19:02] to do that tonight keep walking there's
[1:19:04] a promise and I see the Promise ahead of
[1:19:05] me I'm gonna keep walking I possessed
[1:19:07] another promise I've been healed I've
[1:19:09] been saved but I want my children healed
[1:19:11] I want my children saved I want my
[1:19:12] family to come back we keep on going see
[1:19:15] the promises don't stop just when you
[1:19:16] receive the Holy Ghost but that's when
[1:19:18] the battle begins some of you people are
[1:19:20] sitting here tonight and I heard a
[1:19:22] preacher say this the weekend and I'll
[1:19:23] repeat it he said some of you are
[1:19:25] sitting here tonight he said and you
[1:19:26] don't know that you've got the Holy
[1:19:28] Ghost you don't know that you've been
[1:19:29] born again because Satan has beat you up
[1:19:32] about it but when the battle begins is
[1:19:34] when you receive the Holy Ghost that's
[1:19:36] when we need to start fighting you say
[1:19:38] well I fell I made a mistake that's no
[1:19:40] cause for you to give up that's the
[1:19:42] devil trying to get you but if you
[1:19:44] recognize that as the devil then take a
[1:19:46] hold of the promise of God I wasn't
[1:19:48] backslid I I I'm just moving right along
[1:19:51] the de the devil never got got me Christ
[1:19:53] has got me God has got me see the devil
[1:19:56] has tried to tell you you're not good
[1:19:58] enough to be in The Bride of Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ but if you're sitting here
[1:20:01] tonight then I tell you you are good
[1:20:03] enough you don't know what I've done I
[1:20:05] don't care what you've done God has
[1:20:08] given you a seed on the inside and yes
[1:20:10] you might have went through a lot of
[1:20:12] things yes you might have had to go
[1:20:13] through battles yes you might have had
[1:20:15] to go through a lot of hard times but
[1:20:17] God he showed he he had a seed on there
[1:20:19] and he knew that that seed would grow
[1:20:21] through all the darkness and through the
[1:20:23] muck and the mire that would come
[1:20:24] through but when it got to the light it
[1:20:26] recognized the light and then it would
[1:20:28] Blossom as a as a beautiful flower as a
[1:20:31] lily I tell you tonight I see some
[1:20:33] people I know you've been through some
[1:20:35] some things but God has given you the
[1:20:37] ability to Blossom like a lily he has
[1:20:39] given you the ability to Blossom like a
[1:20:41] rose you say well I've come up and I was
[1:20:43] in darkness I was I I'll tell you I feel
[1:20:45] like preaching to you from a minute I
[1:20:47] was so low down that I couldn't even see
[1:20:49] bottom no more but do you realize that
[1:20:51] God in his goodness and his grace he
[1:20:53] came to where you were you never sought
[1:20:55] God but God came right down there to the
[1:20:57] place you were and he said you know what
[1:20:59] my grace is sufficient for you my
[1:21:01] strength is made perfect in weakness I
[1:21:03] will not leave you comfortless but I
[1:21:05] will send the Holy Ghost to
[1:21:07] you God doesn't want you to go around
[1:21:10] and acting like you're a children of the
[1:21:12] devil you're not children of the devil
[1:21:13] you're children of God you're children
[1:21:16] of God you say why are you preaching the
[1:21:18] promises because Satan's beat you up
[1:21:19] long enough you say why you preaching
[1:21:21] that way I just ain't all my notes but
[1:21:22] I'm going to tell you I feel a pull to
[1:21:24] go this way Satan is trying to hold you
[1:21:26] in the condition that you're sitting in
[1:21:28] but if you release the change tonight
[1:21:30] God can move you out of the change that
[1:21:32] you're in right now you say what do I
[1:21:34] have to have I say it takes a a stand
[1:21:36] for God what do I have to do brother
[1:21:38] Joel I said throw up your hands and
[1:21:40] release the change right now say I don't
[1:21:42] have to be be bound down to the devil
[1:21:44] anymore I don't have to do what the
[1:21:46] devil tells me to do because I'm being
[1:21:47] led by a pillar of fire and by the
[1:21:50] message of the hour I'm being led to the
[1:21:52] promise of God by the message of the
[1:21:54] hour and the life that has come don't
[1:21:56] let that devil Bluff you don't let that
[1:21:58] devil keep you down God is greater than
[1:22:01] that
[1:22:02] devil you realize sickness has just come
[1:22:04] along as a
[1:22:07] scarecrow you say well I deserve it no
[1:22:09] you don't deserve that sickness that's
[1:22:11] well I deserve for my children to be
[1:22:12] that way cuz I wasn't a very good parent
[1:22:14] no you don't deserve that a bit it's
[1:22:16] true raise them right but I'm going to
[1:22:17] tell you this if you did all you can do
[1:22:20] stand on the Promises of God
[1:22:23] there you go stand on his promises let
[1:22:26] him know you're standing on him when you
[1:22:27] come to the house of God I'm not going
[1:22:30] to give up in one inch to this devil my
[1:22:33] children are backslid stand on the
[1:22:35] promise that they're your children amen
[1:22:37] thank you Lord yes sir well yes sir
[1:22:40] we'll move on here true man come on he
[1:22:42] said while they were in Egypt God could
[1:22:43] have went down there and brushed all
[1:22:44] them little Hittites and everything out
[1:22:45] and said move on in that's right but
[1:22:47] that's not God's way that's right
[1:22:50] everything you know God could come come
[1:22:52] down tonight somebody in here may be
[1:22:54] dealing with a serious sickness he could
[1:22:56] come in right now and just take that out
[1:22:57] of you but he wants to see do you have
[1:22:59] the faith to overcome that thing because
[1:23:02] he wants to build a Powerhouse our
[1:23:05] pastor preached on that a few weeks ago
[1:23:06] he wants to build you individually not a
[1:23:08] power church not a power program but an
[1:23:11] individual Powerhouse that can be built
[1:23:14] into the stature of a perfect man you've
[1:23:16] overcome you and it's not a seven-step
[1:23:18] program when God when when God sought
[1:23:21] you out and you accepted the baptism of
[1:23:23] the Holy Ghost you were sealed to the
[1:23:25] day of your
[1:23:26] Redemption come on somebody he's not
[1:23:28] going to give you the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:30] take it back he's not going to seal you
[1:23:32] and then unseal you when you're sealed
[1:23:34] you're sealed to the day of your
[1:23:36] Redemption well that may not preach
[1:23:38] everywhere but I'll tell you tonight if
[1:23:39] you want to go study the message of the
[1:23:41] hour God will tell you through a
[1:23:43] Vindicated Prophet that that he's not an
[1:23:44] Indian giver he didn't give it to you
[1:23:46] just to take it back he's not going to
[1:23:48] heal one person and not heal another
[1:23:50] person he's not going to deliver one
[1:23:52] person a pornography or some evil spirit
[1:23:55] and not deliver somebody else but if he
[1:23:57] did it for one he could do it for every
[1:23:59] person here tonight why because your
[1:24:01] land is in sight and all you have to do
[1:24:03] is claim it you're standing on this side
[1:24:06] of the river in
[1:24:07] unbelief you're standing over here and
[1:24:11] all you have to do is step over here
[1:24:13] come on and the promises are there but
[1:24:14] you're scared because of the Giants well
[1:24:18] come on
[1:24:19] somebody you're scared because of of the
[1:24:23] battle of I may not fit
[1:24:26] in you're scared of the battle well if I
[1:24:29] go over here with this group that call
[1:24:31] me crazy come on I don't really care
[1:24:34] that's right you shouldn't care do you
[1:24:36] realize that every godall person
[1:24:38] throughout the ages has been just a
[1:24:40] little crazy to the
[1:24:41] world even Jesus come and did all the
[1:24:44] good things that he did and they they
[1:24:45] called him be elub and fortune teller
[1:24:48] they thought he was crazy and the
[1:24:50] greatest gift that God could send to the
[1:24:51] world
[1:24:53] come on somebody you're telling me he
[1:24:54] was crazy Paul was telling people about
[1:24:57] seeing a light and hearing a voice and
[1:25:00] they called him crazy we we we point to
[1:25:02] a picture of a man that had a light
[1:25:04] hanging over him it was a Vindication
[1:25:07] the angel of God the light the God
[1:25:09] himself standing there vindicating a
[1:25:11] prophet and you call us crazy I say this
[1:25:13] we're Bible Believers because we're just
[1:25:15] like they were you can call us crazy you
[1:25:19] can look for faults you can look for
[1:25:20] mistakes but you know when Abra it says
[1:25:22] he it says he made mistakes and he said
[1:25:24] all the things about him in the Old
[1:25:26] Testament but if you go over here to the
[1:25:27] New Testament and you look at what it
[1:25:29] said about Abraham he staggered not at
[1:25:31] the promises of God over here under the
[1:25:33] law you're going to look at brother
[1:25:35] Isaac we'll just use you for an example
[1:25:36] and you're going to tell him all the bad
[1:25:37] things he's ever done and oh he's done
[1:25:39] this and this but no he came under the
[1:25:41] shed blood and now over here under grace
[1:25:43] and the atonement that's been shed for
[1:25:45] him you can look at him and say I never
[1:25:47] see any of it he's a Perfect Bride of
[1:25:49] Jesus Christ what is it Satan's over
[1:25:53] here trying to show you what you did the
[1:25:55] law was over here and I'm not doing away
[1:25:56] with the law but what I'm telling you is
[1:25:58] this that Grace has come to restore
[1:26:00] people back in this generation you had
[1:26:03] to be a virgin bride and the only way
[1:26:05] you could be a virgin bride was to be
[1:26:07] restored back under Redemption oh
[1:26:09] brother Stuart not to steal your sermon
[1:26:10] title but this is the place to worship
[1:26:13] when you're redeemed and you recognize
[1:26:15] that now is the time to worship the
[1:26:17] Redemption has come the blood has
[1:26:19] covered your sins and that's the time to
[1:26:21] give God praise for what he's done for
[1:26:23] you oh you can look back and you can
[1:26:24] look back and maybe it's good sometimes
[1:26:26] to reflect on where you've been because
[1:26:28] you know you know what maybe I'm not
[1:26:29] right where I need to be at this moment
[1:26:31] but you know what I know I'm not where I
[1:26:33] used to be I know I'm not the sinner
[1:26:35] that I once was and I can't even see
[1:26:37] those things anymore because God has
[1:26:39] taking it out of my mind I don't even
[1:26:41] know the way I was because you're
[1:26:43] looking at it and it's just like a big
[1:26:44] old it's like a blob of Blackness over
[1:26:46] here and you look at it and you can't
[1:26:48] see nothing there and you know what God
[1:26:50] is even taking it from your memory
[1:26:52] because he says forget about the things
[1:26:53] in the past and press forward and the
[1:26:56] prize and the mark of the High Calling
[1:26:58] that's where all things are possible
[1:26:59] that's where the promis is Lay that's
[1:27:01] where you can have your healing that's
[1:27:03] where you can have your children that's
[1:27:05] where all things are made new in this
[1:27:07] land of promise can you say
[1:27:10] Amen so we go on down here I'll try to
[1:27:13] I'm going to try to hurry my time is up
[1:27:15] he said if you're sick don't wait for
[1:27:18] somebody to come by like some special
[1:27:19] healer or some special healing service
[1:27:21] some totem pull or to touch he said God
[1:27:24] is a God who keeps his word all you need
[1:27:27] is his word we don't have to worry we
[1:27:29] don't have to wait for nothing we don't
[1:27:30] have to wait for the meetings next
[1:27:31] summer we can have it
[1:27:33] now sir he said just reach up and take
[1:27:37] the promise oh but that's too simple but
[1:27:40] that's all you got to do it's easier now
[1:27:43] to receive healing than it's ever been
[1:27:45] because in the Old Testament maybe you
[1:27:46] had to go to the Brass serpent or maybe
[1:27:48] you had to do a certain thing or maybe
[1:27:50] you had to jump through some hoops even
[1:27:51] to be saved or you couldn't go into the
[1:27:53] temple and all these things but do you
[1:27:54] realize you're under Redemption today do
[1:27:56] you realize the blood has been shed for
[1:27:58] you and your sins do you realize that
[1:28:00] everything you've done is in the sea of
[1:28:02] God's forgetfulness if you've repented
[1:28:05] there is no wrong in you I see no wrong
[1:28:07] in the bride of Christ but it is a
[1:28:09] virtuous pure sinless spotless Lamb of
[1:28:12] God that has come to make you just like
[1:28:15] him thank you Lord he said it's yours
[1:28:17] for every believer we just got to be
[1:28:19] Believers tonight Church we've got to
[1:28:21] accept the promise that have come I if
[1:28:23] there's a church over here saying well
[1:28:24] we don't need ministers no more well if
[1:28:26] the if the word says we do there's a
[1:28:28] purpose for them come on
[1:28:30] somebody see and that's what happened to
[1:28:33] Eve was she got one word off and that's
[1:28:35] where she fell that's where she could
[1:28:37] not be restored she could not be the
[1:28:40] perfect bride that God wanted she could
[1:28:42] not be what God had in his mind from the
[1:28:44] beginning to have to have perfect family
[1:28:46] and and and raise up perfect uh lineages
[1:28:48] from Adam and Eve but no he couldn't do
[1:28:50] it because she listened to the devil and
[1:28:52] just one
[1:28:54] word one word we don't need
[1:28:57] preachers we don't need preachers we
[1:29:00] don't need the holy ghost in the church
[1:29:01] no more come on somebody we don't need
[1:29:04] God moving among our young people they
[1:29:06] act a little crazy I'd rather see him
[1:29:08] acting crazy right here than out in the
[1:29:10] world running the nightclubs and and and
[1:29:13] and and sinning and out here in all
[1:29:15] kinds of movie theaters and with their
[1:29:17] friends and and watching these bad
[1:29:18] movies and things I tell you I'd rather
[1:29:20] see them right here having a little bit
[1:29:22] of fun than to be out there with the
[1:29:24] things of the world I think we need to
[1:29:25] fight for our children to have a place
[1:29:27] to come into where they can be born
[1:29:29] again of the spirit of God because God
[1:29:32] has not giving you the spirit of fear
[1:29:34] but he wants you to come in uh
[1:29:36] courageous and bold Before the Throne of
[1:29:38] God you young people don't be scared
[1:29:40] don't be scared to get a little excited
[1:29:41] in church don't be scared to say Amen
[1:29:43] just because you got a few older people
[1:29:45] in the church that said we don't like
[1:29:46] emotion or we don't like noise I said do
[1:29:48] away with that if God has moved Upon
[1:29:50] Your Heart To Worship I say worship God
[1:29:53] with all you've got fight through that
[1:29:55] spirit that is trying to hold you back
[1:29:57] fight through that Spirit that's trying
[1:29:58] to keep you out of the house of God
[1:30:00] fight through that Spirit of division
[1:30:01] among the Brethren and among the
[1:30:03] churches fight through that spirit and
[1:30:05] take a hold of the love of God and the
[1:30:07] promises of God and all things that God
[1:30:09] has got for you that's what he wants
[1:30:11] tonight he wants a group of Believers
[1:30:13] that are Standing on the Promises he
[1:30:15] wants a group of Believers that says I'm
[1:30:16] not giving up I'm not going to turn
[1:30:18] around and take the way of the world but
[1:30:20] I'm going to take the way with the Lord
[1:30:22] just by as few I'm going through no
[1:30:24] matter what the trial is because on the
[1:30:26] other end is Victory on the other end is
[1:30:29] something that I've been told about in
[1:30:30] the message of the hour it is a perfect
[1:30:32] land where we're all young again where
[1:30:34] there's no more sickness and there's
[1:30:36] nothing that'll ever take your place
[1:30:37] that there's nothing that can ever take
[1:30:38] you out of there there's nothing that
[1:30:40] can give you a bad Spirit or a bad day
[1:30:42] but what it is is Christ that has given
[1:30:44] you this place I went to prepare you a
[1:30:46] place I tell you what somebody's going
[1:30:48] to go there he didn't go prepare a place
[1:30:50] that's never going to be lived in but he
[1:30:52] went and prepared a place for a bride
[1:30:54] that is called Mrs Jesus Christ and I
[1:30:57] believe I'm looking at her today can you
[1:30:59] say amen I believe God Has Come among
[1:31:01] the people in this hour and said you
[1:31:02] know what I've raised up a prophet like
[1:31:04] unto Moses I've raised up a prophet now
[1:31:07] I've raised up a people that can take
[1:31:08] the promised land I've raised up a
[1:31:10] people that not going to doubt and go
[1:31:11] back into denom denominations I've
[1:31:13] raised up a people who they don't want
[1:31:15] nothing else but the word of God and if
[1:31:17] the word of God says we can shout if the
[1:31:19] word of God says if you that that
[1:31:21] there's an to this then I'm going to
[1:31:23] take some emotion with it but ultimately
[1:31:25] I'm going to go back to the word and
[1:31:26] when the word is preached and the power
[1:31:28] and the demonstration of the Gospel then
[1:31:30] the word will move upon my heart and if
[1:31:31] there's something in there that's
[1:31:32] unclean let the word come in and wash it
[1:31:34] out to where you can be free and clean
[1:31:37] before the God and you can go in a
[1:31:39] Rapture that's what I want for every one
[1:31:40] of these young people I'm not looking
[1:31:42] here at these people today and saying I
[1:31:44] just want good Christians I just want
[1:31:45] good Baptist I want good message people
[1:31:47] come on somebody I don't want just some
[1:31:49] good people that can sit around and they
[1:31:50] can listen to a tape and and things like
[1:31:52] that I believe in listening to the tapes
[1:31:54] by the way I believe in hearing it I
[1:31:55] think we need to do more of it in our
[1:31:57] homes and I think we need to do turn it
[1:31:58] on in the cars and and listen to it I
[1:32:00] believe in that with all my heart but
[1:32:02] let me just go ahead and tell you this
[1:32:03] that's not going to save you you've got
[1:32:05] to come under the shed blood of Jesus
[1:32:07] Christ and the atonement for the hour
[1:32:09] you've got to come to a place to where
[1:32:11] all things have been made new and it's
[1:32:13] only under the blood of Jesus and it's
[1:32:15] only in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:16] where you can really live a Victorious
[1:32:18] Life you tell me well I I've got to get
[1:32:20] to a certain place where can live come
[1:32:22] on somebody I got to get up here where I
[1:32:24] can live a Victorious Life and then God
[1:32:25] will give me the Holy Ghost well that's
[1:32:27] another devil you need to fight you need
[1:32:29] to get that devil out of your mind
[1:32:30] because it's not how you live it's how
[1:32:32] he lived through
[1:32:34] you that's where the people get messed
[1:32:36] up they think I got to do it it's my
[1:32:38] works it's my time it's God in you it's
[1:32:40] Christ in you that is the opening of the
[1:32:43] word Christ coming down and living in
[1:32:45] his people sir that's what we need to do
[1:32:47] tonight I'm over my time give me two
[1:32:49] more minutes on I'll quit qu he said now
[1:32:53] you say then the promise is mine he said
[1:32:55] sure yeah but you'll fight for every
[1:32:57] inch of it yeah yes sir come on somebody
[1:33:01] on you'll fight for every inch of it
[1:33:02] till you he said until you're well
[1:33:05] you'll take every step of it it's a
[1:33:07] battle the promise is yours he said
[1:33:10] there was a promised land they had to
[1:33:12] fight to get every step of it and the
[1:33:13] promise is yours but you'll fight every
[1:33:14] inch of it come on
[1:33:16] somebody it's a prophet speaking he said
[1:33:19] he said I was called to God to preach
[1:33:20] the gospel 30 one years ago I fought
[1:33:22] ever since you want to be in a battle
[1:33:25] get called get be become a
[1:33:27] preacher welcome to the battle
[1:33:29] Hallelujah he said welcome to the battle
[1:33:31] I I tell you what you want to be in
[1:33:32] another battle become a Christian well I
[1:33:35] don't want to be in a battle well
[1:33:36] without any fight there's no Victory
[1:33:39] come on somebody you got to fight that's
[1:33:41] why sometimes the best Services the ones
[1:33:43] you have to you have to fight to get to
[1:33:46] sometimes the ones where Satan's trying
[1:33:48] to keep you out of church and Satan's
[1:33:50] trying to get you to go this way and
[1:33:51] that way and do something else and then
[1:33:53] you end up getting there and you're like
[1:33:54] my goodness I'm glad I didn't miss that
[1:33:55] one but I'm going to tell you this even
[1:33:57] if you didn't feel good about going you
[1:33:59] took sides with Jesus doing that even if
[1:34:01] you didn't feel like shouting you took
[1:34:03] sides with Jesus by being there but when
[1:34:05] you come why not entertain the presence
[1:34:07] of the Lord while he's here why not come
[1:34:09] into the presence of God knowing his
[1:34:12] promise that he'd be here knowing this
[1:34:14] is a land of promise knowing it's a time
[1:34:15] of worship under Redemption knowing it's
[1:34:17] a place of of praise and worship to God
[1:34:20] then I say we ought to come with all of
[1:34:21] our hearts I think we ought to come and
[1:34:23] fight through that Spirit that's trying
[1:34:24] to make us cold well come on somebody I
[1:34:26] think it's time we try to fight that
[1:34:28] spirit because you realize that's the
[1:34:29] spirit of the age that's the spirit
[1:34:31] we're fighting against you say why why
[1:34:33] don't we fight against emotionalism I'm
[1:34:35] not really worried about that you know
[1:34:36] if it's just emotionalism it'll die out
[1:34:38] eventually but let me tell you this the
[1:34:40] cold Spirit on the church is the one I'm
[1:34:41] worried about the one that comes in and
[1:34:43] gets everybody looking like they can't
[1:34:44] worship no more the one that gets in
[1:34:46] where there's no healing no more and the
[1:34:48] one that comes in and there's no move of
[1:34:49] the spirit no more and there's no young
[1:34:51] people getting saved there's no young
[1:34:52] people coming back to the Lord I'm not
[1:34:54] talking about just an emotion but if
[1:34:56] there's something real in there then the
[1:34:57] people will change and their lives will
[1:34:59] reflect what happened to them and I
[1:35:01] think tonight that's what we need to see
[1:35:03] is get past just looking at the emotion
[1:35:05] and criticizing this group for being too
[1:35:07] emotional or criticizing this person for
[1:35:09] shouting a little too loud I say bring
[1:35:11] it on and if it's really of God then God
[1:35:13] will vindicate it with a life lived but
[1:35:16] let's not let's not criticize them
[1:35:17] because if it is of god then you found
[1:35:19] yourself in the seat of the scornful
[1:35:23] if you criticize a move of God you found
[1:35:26] yourself criticizing God come on
[1:35:29] somebody I'm not I'm I I understand I
[1:35:33] understand the rain falls on the just
[1:35:34] and the unjust I know not all emotion is
[1:35:36] God moving on the people some of it
[1:35:38] they're just having a good time I know
[1:35:39] that but I'm not going to tell you who's
[1:35:41] real and who's not real what I'm going
[1:35:43] to say is this preach the word and let
[1:35:45] the word take a hold of their hearts and
[1:35:48] people will respond to the word of God
[1:35:50] if there's a ceed within there to
[1:35:52] respond with and so you can say well I
[1:35:56] you know the people are just getting out
[1:35:57] of control let's let them get saved
[1:36:00] let's create an atmosphere of freedom
[1:36:02] for the people I I I think we need to
[1:36:05] sometimes I think an altar experience
[1:36:06] you can put the altar out of the church
[1:36:08] but I think an altar experience is
[1:36:09] absolutely necessary in the time we live
[1:36:11] in I I think a move of God in a service
[1:36:14] is absolutely necessary in the time we
[1:36:16] live in I I think a move of God is is so
[1:36:20] necessary you know why because he said
[1:36:22] where Jesus is there's a lot of noise
[1:36:24] and I just can't unsee that script or
[1:36:26] that quote I can't unsee it and I'm
[1:36:28] going to tell you this I understand he
[1:36:30] comes in a sweetness and the in the
[1:36:31] presence sometimes it's just like a glow
[1:36:33] over the congregation I love that too
[1:36:35] but I say however he comes let's
[1:36:37] entertain him while he's here let's
[1:36:38] entertain the angel of the Lord I can
[1:36:40] say he could come in this way or that
[1:36:42] way it ain't up to me how he comes but
[1:36:44] it's up to me to entertain him while
[1:36:45] he's here it's up to you to worship him
[1:36:47] when he walks down your high do you
[1:36:49] realize if the greatest person in this
[1:36:51] world could walk into this church there
[1:36:53] would be a presence that there would be
[1:36:54] an aura about that person the most
[1:36:56] famous person you can think of an idol
[1:36:58] of yours I hope you don't have any but
[1:37:00] if you do if that person walked into
[1:37:02] church here tonight you would light up
[1:37:05] and glow because your favorite persons
[1:37:07] in church take a queen or a king or a
[1:37:11] former president and bring them in here
[1:37:13] and and and they would get all the
[1:37:15] respect and and all these things but let
[1:37:18] me just go ahead and tell you this he is
[1:37:21] here
[1:37:23] here and if he's here then that should
[1:37:26] put a glow on your face is he your
[1:37:28] favorite come on
[1:37:30] somebody Jesus is here I can prove he's
[1:37:34] here I know he's here it's not a feeling
[1:37:36] it's not a sensation it's not an emotion
[1:37:39] but it's a promise in his word and
[1:37:41] you're living in the land of promise so
[1:37:43] worship him while he's here can you say
[1:37:45] amen I wonder if our musicians would
[1:37:47] come and I wonder tonight if we could
[1:37:49] just worship him while he comes while
[1:37:51] he's here you say well I don't know that
[1:37:52] he's here but he's promised he'd be here
[1:37:54] are you two or three if there's more
[1:37:56] than that here tonight there may not be
[1:37:58] very many but let me just tell you this
[1:37:59] if you and one other person are here
[1:38:01] then Jesus showed up to see what this
[1:38:03] meeting was about and he's wanting you
[1:38:05] to worship him he showed up just like he
[1:38:07] did in Simon's house you've heard the
[1:38:09] pastor preach on it a couple weeks ago
[1:38:10] you heard him preach on it how he showed
[1:38:12] up at Simon's house he didn't go in
[1:38:14] there and just make himself known right
[1:38:15] away but you know he sat down in the
[1:38:17] corner but somebody needed to recognize
[1:38:19] Jesus was there and the one that
[1:38:21] recognized him her sins were forgiven
[1:38:23] and I think if you you say well I'm a
[1:38:25] sinner I don't have no right to worship
[1:38:27] he won't take my worship oh come on
[1:38:28] somebody I get so tired of that God will
[1:38:31] accept your worship if you'll just
[1:38:33] repent and say God I'm coming back to
[1:38:34] you I'm not looking at what I did he's
[1:38:37] not even looking at what you did he
[1:38:39] didn't look at that woman but he looked
[1:38:40] at a Heart of Worship she recognized the
[1:38:42] presence of Jesus and I say the land
[1:38:45] that we're living in the time of the
[1:38:47] promise is here and I say this land is
[1:38:49] worth the fight to live in I say this
[1:38:51] message is worth fighting for I say the
[1:38:54] word of God in your F in your home is
[1:38:56] worth fighting for your marriage is
[1:38:58] worth fighting for your children are
[1:39:00] worth fighting for it's not just going
[1:39:02] to be a a picnic it's going to be a
[1:39:04] battlefield but I say it's worth the
[1:39:06] fight here tonight I think that's what
[1:39:09] we need to
[1:39:10] recognize God has given us the authority
[1:39:15] to walk all over the devil's head here
[1:39:17] tonight come on somebody God has giv you
[1:39:20] the authority to cast that Spirit of
[1:39:22] unbelief out of your mind you say well
[1:39:25] I'm a sinner sin is
[1:39:28] unbelief drop the unbelief amen start
[1:39:31] believing amen and God's here to take
[1:39:33] you as one of his I don't believe in
[1:39:35] quick experiences I do I say the thief
[1:39:38] on the cross made it I say the thief
[1:39:41] made it you say well I don't believe in
[1:39:42] death bed experience well I don't put a
[1:39:43] whole lot into those either but I'll
[1:39:45] tell you this if this is your last
[1:39:46] chance tonight I believe God can take
[1:39:48] you as one of his Chosen Few right here
[1:39:50] tonight
[1:39:51] you don't have to jump through no hoop
[1:39:53] Hoops here in this church I'm going to
[1:39:54] tell you if you'll accept God on the
[1:39:56] basis of his word that you are an
[1:39:58] overcomer that you are an heir to the
[1:40:00] land of promise all you got to do is
[1:40:02] accept it and God will take you as one
[1:40:04] of his all they had to do was go take
[1:40:06] the land but they couldn't doubt they
[1:40:09] couldn't look at the Giants quit looking
[1:40:11] at the fear quit looking at the
[1:40:13] complications and the you know well I
[1:40:15] don't understand the word just right
[1:40:16] just stay in it get to that land and the
[1:40:19] grapes are going to be there the word's
[1:40:20] going to be revealed to you this is the
[1:40:22] land this is the time of revealing the
[1:40:23] land is here I say it's time to get into

[1:51:20] get to
[1:51:21] thinking if we backslide we never we're
[1:51:23] never saved if we backslide maybe we
[1:51:26] didn't have the Holy Ghost now that's
[1:51:28] not necessarily true the Holy Ghost
[1:51:31] wants you to live right the Holy Ghost
[1:51:34] will bring you back you Lord doesn't
[1:51:36] mean you can't mess up when you mess up
