[10:20] over. He molds
[10:23] me and makes
[10:27] me
[10:29] into his

[10:37] [Music]
[10:39] clay. Oh, a
[10:42] vessel of
[10:45] honor I am today.

[11:59] Alas, and did my savior bleed? And did
[12:05] my sovereign
[12:08] eye? Would he devote that sacred head
[12:15] for such a world as
[12:19] I? Oh, at the cross. At the cross where
[12:24] I first saw the light and the burden of
[12:28] my heart rolled
[12:31] away. It was there by faith. I received
[12:36] my sight. And now I am happy all the
[12:41] day. Oh, was it for crimes that I have
[12:48] done? He groaned upon the
[12:53] tree.
[12:55] Amazing pity, grace unknown, and love
[13:02] beyond
[13:04] degree. Oh, at the cross. At the cross
[13:08] where I first saw the light, the burdens
[13:12] of my heart rolled
[13:15] away. It was there by faith. I receive
[13:20] my sight. And now I am happy all day.
[13:27] Well, might the sun in darkness hide and
[13:33] shut his glories
[13:37] in. When Christ the
[13:41] mighty maker died for men the creature
[13:47] sin.
[13:49] Oh, at the cross, at the cross, where I
[13:53] first saw the light and the burden of my
[13:57] heart rolled
[13:59] away. It was there by faith. I received
[14:04] my sight and now I am happy all the day.
[14:11] The drops of grief
[14:15] can repay the debt of love I
[14:21] owe. Here Lord I give myself to thee. K
[14:28] is all that I with all your hearts now.
[14:33] Oh, at the cross. At the cross where I
[14:37] first saw the light and the burden of my
[14:41] heart rolled
[14:43] away. Oh, it was there by faith. I
[14:47] received my sight and now I am happy all
[14:53] the day.

[38:21] But Lord, you're a God who meets our
[38:23] needs. And I pray that you'd meet them
[38:25] physically, Lord, spiritually, whatever
[38:27] they are. Lord, you know, God, I pray
[38:30] that you'd do that tonight. Speak to
[38:31] those maybe who couldn't make it
[38:33] tonight, but there they'll be watching.
[38:35] Lord, I I pray, God, that you go right
[38:37] into the home, Lord, and speak directly
[38:39] to them tonight. Lord, we love you and
[38:42] we commit this service into your hands
[38:44] and for your glory. We thank you in
[38:46] Jesus' name. Amen. Thank the
[38:50] Lord. Thank the
[38:53] Lord. Going to read from Genesis chapter
[38:56] 49 and verse 20 and also Deuteronomy
[39:00] chapter 33 and verse 24. Enjoyed that
[39:03] special tonight. It it'll go with the
[39:05] sermon and I think the Lord orchestrates
[39:07] those things. So, sure enjoyed that.
[39:09] It's good to have our sister with us
[39:11] again. God bless you and each one of you
[39:13] that are here tonight on a Wednesday
[39:15] night. It's good to come and study the
[39:17] word together and rejoice and worship
[39:19] and and just love on God. And no matter
[39:21] what you've been through uh during the
[39:23] week, he's still worthy of our praise.
[39:27] Amen. Genesis 49:20. And then we'll read
[39:31] Deuteronomy
[39:32] 33:24. Out of Asher his bread shall be
[39:36] fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
[39:40] And then Deuteronomy 33:24.
[39:44] While you're turning there, we want to
[39:45] remember brother Bill and sister Karen
[39:48] uh out of town. He's having a heart cath
[39:50] early in the morning. So, be remembering
[39:52] him. Everything goes smoothly. And each
[39:54] one of the requests that were made.
[39:56] Deuteronomy chapter 33 and verse
[40:01] 24 it says, "And of Asher he said, let
[40:05] Asher be blessed with children. Let him
[40:08] be acceptable to his brethren and let
[40:11] him dip his foot in oil. It's a very
[40:14] specific property or prophecy rather.
[40:17] Pray the Lord would add his blessings to
[40:18] the word. You may be
[40:23] seated. We have been studying the 12
[40:25] tribes of Israel for some time and as a
[40:28] preview to the placing of sons in the
[40:30] church. So we as we've been going
[40:32] through this, just keep in mind that
[40:34] it's a preview to a spiritual placing
[40:36] that we want to get to uh at some point.
[40:40] But brother Brandham tells us, he said,
[40:41] "God in the beginning gave his word a
[40:44] portion for this part of the time, for
[40:47] that part, for that part." So he didn't
[40:49] give his word all at once, but he gave
[40:51] the portion that was needed for the day
[40:54] that was that that they were living. He
[40:57] said, "There's where men are so deceived
[40:58] and confused today. They're trying to
[41:01] build on something that happened 40, 50
[41:04] years ago that was gift for that age. He
[41:06] said, "What good would it have done
[41:07] Moses to come with Enoch's message? What
[41:10] good would it have done uh Moses to come
[41:13] with Noah's message? What good would it
[41:15] have done Jesus to come with Moses'
[41:17] message? What good would it have done
[41:19] Wesley to come with Luther's message?
[41:21] What good would have done the Pentecost
[41:22] to come with Wesley's message?" He said,
[41:24] "See what I mean?" He said, "It's all
[41:27] laotted out here in the Bible." He said,
[41:30] ' And we've got to know the age and the
[41:32] hour and what's for us. So that's
[41:35] important. We've got to know the age and
[41:36] the hour and what's for us. There's
[41:39] something for us tonight, something that
[41:41] we can have and it's the fullness of the
[41:43] word for our hour. Now the prophecy, as
[41:46] I we said over Asher is one of the most
[41:48] specific properties or or prophecies. It
[41:52] is let him dip his feet in oil as well
[41:55] as let him be acceptable to his
[41:57] brethren. and uh and the prophecy about
[42:00] children. I think some of y'all been
[42:02] blessed with children. We thank God for
[42:03] our children. And I think as a church,
[42:06] we've been blessed with children. So,
[42:07] we're thankful for that. That's pretty
[42:09] self-explanatory. He said, "Let him be
[42:11] acceptable to his brethren is pretty
[42:13] selfexplanatory. Let him dip his foot in
[42:16] oil." Is very specific. And if you go to
[42:19] the land that Asher was given, I think
[42:21] I've got a map that we you can show you
[42:24] uh that Asher was given uh land up in
[42:26] the northwest part, the very northwest
[42:29] part of Israel. You can see Mount Carmel
[42:30] at the bottom of it. And uh you can kind
[42:34] of see where the land lays cuz it was
[42:37] very specific prophecy. So there must be
[42:39] a very specific fulfillment. If you go
[42:41] to the next one, I think uh yeah, it
[42:43] shows uh olive oil production. And
[42:45] they've actually archaeologists have
[42:47] found that the the foot of Asher was
[42:50] literally dipped in olive oil. That it
[42:54] was actually a a production area of
[42:57] olive oil much earlier than they thought
[42:59] that olive oil was uh was produced in
[43:02] that area. They actually exported at a
[43:04] very early age. But brother Brandham
[43:06] draws a specific attention to another
[43:09] kind of oil uh and and that didn't come
[43:12] to pass until the end time. And this is
[43:14] something important that maybe we
[43:15] haven't really pointed out yet. Brother
[43:18] Brandham told us that their their name
[43:20] would not only put them in their place
[43:23] in the Old Testament, but it actually
[43:25] put them in their place in the end time.
[43:28] And so he said when it said that he let
[43:30] him dip his feet in oil would actually
[43:33] be a prophecy about Israel today that
[43:35] they would actually have access to oil.
[43:38] And so he draws specific attention to
[43:40] oil wells and
[43:43] And uh they asked brother Brandham about
[43:46] the 10 lost tribes because that was a a
[43:48] thing people uh realized that uh 10 of
[43:51] the tribes were lost. The people didn't
[43:53] know many of them where they come from,
[43:55] which tribe they were from. And they
[43:57] said, "Can they be located?" And brother
[43:58] Brandham answers the question. He said,
[44:00] "Yes, sir, they can be located
[44:02] geographically. They can be located in
[44:04] the Bible." And God tells us there there
[44:07] where they will be in the last days. And
[44:09] what will be their end? He says, and he
[44:13] said, right now, he said, I just read a
[44:14] book that down in Israel where the ones
[44:16] was, where he said that one had dipped
[44:17] his feet in oil and everything. He said,
[44:19] God has got them all located, set out in
[44:23] different places, and the Jews are all
[44:25] returning into Palestine where God
[44:27] promised in the last days they'd be
[44:29] there. So, you can see tribes not
[44:31] knowing what tribe they belong to, but
[44:33] actually settling into the land. Oh my,
[44:37] can you see the perfection of the word
[44:38] of God? how he manages the affairs of
[44:41] men so that they were are actually
[44:43] settling into the land. When they would
[44:45] come back into the land, maybe they uh
[44:47] they found a spot and they thought,
[44:49] "Well, this would be a good spot to
[44:50] build, not even realizing that they were
[44:52] of the tribe that was there before."
[44:56] That God did that after thousands of
[44:58] years. You say, "You really believe
[44:59] that?" I absolutely do. That God would
[45:02] actually bring them back into the spot
[45:04] where they belong. There would be
[45:06] 144,000 that would actually be located
[45:09] in the spot where they oh my in the spot
[45:12] where they were supposed to be not even
[45:14] knowing it. If God can do that for them,
[45:17] if he can bring them back into a
[45:19] specific natural spot after thousands of
[45:22] years and after after all the records
[45:24] have been lost and if he could bring
[45:26] them back in that spot, how much more
[45:27] could he bring the bride into a place
[45:30] where she's supposed to be? How much
[45:32] more can he bring you as an individual
[45:34] into the place and into the calling that
[45:36] you're supposed to be in? If he could do
[45:39] that for them, I believe he could do
[45:40] that for us. Brother Brown said, "Let me
[45:43] show you a divine word." And if you pull
[45:45] up that next, let's go back to that that
[45:47] previous map. I think there was another
[45:50] map there. Yes. Uh and this is actually
[45:52] a map of oil leases. And you can see
[45:55] most of them are offshore. But if you
[45:57] look where I've got circled, if you can
[45:59] see that at the very bottom of that same
[46:01] little outcrop of land, uh, where Asher
[46:04] was, there's a a huge oil well and oil
[46:09] lease that is literally at the foot of
[46:11] Asher. Even today, God keeps his word.
[46:16] Brother Brandham said, "Let me show you
[46:17] a divine word, friend, so that your
[46:19] faith will be built certain in the word
[46:21] of God." Every time them Hebrew mothers
[46:24] who said when they were in labor giving
[46:26] labor pains to birth these children the
[46:29] very words that she uttered in her birth
[46:31] give the man the baby that was born of
[46:33] her his name and positionally placed him
[46:36] in Palestine where he'll be at the
[46:38] coming of the Lord. Oh my brother
[46:41] Brandham uses some examples. He didn't
[46:43] have it in front of him but he uses some
[46:45] examples. Then he says take it Genesis
[46:47] 48 and 49. He said, "You'll find out
[46:49] there that Jacob, when he was dying,
[46:51] leaning on his staff, blinded, he
[46:53] positionally told those children where
[46:55] they would be at the end of the world,
[46:56] and they're positionally set right
[46:58] there." Now, since they went back to the
[47:00] homeland, he said told Joseph, "Thou art
[47:03] a fruitful vine by the wall, by the
[47:05] well, the water." We'll read the
[47:07] prophecy when we get to Joseph's two,
[47:10] the two tribes that come from Joseph. He
[47:12] said he went over. He said, "You've
[47:13] trusted in the Lord God." He said you
[47:15] made your bow strong United States. See
[47:18] they they come here and they they become
[47:20] very wealthy and things. He said in the
[47:22] Lord he said but someday that vine was
[47:24] coming back over the wall they were
[47:27] prophesied to come back into the land.
[47:29] Right. And he said there she is right
[47:31] there now. Just exactly what he said
[47:34] pretty nearly 3,000 years ago turning
[47:37] right back told Ephraim he had dipped
[47:39] his feet in oil. He he he uses Ephraim
[47:42] instead of Asher. Uh but it's Asher that
[47:44] had the prophecy given to him. He said
[47:45] Ephraim settled right there where the
[47:48] big oil wells are. He said just exactly.
[47:51] I believe God keeps his word. Do you
[47:53] believe that tonight? Do we believe on a
[47:55] Wednesday night that God keeps his word?
[47:57] That he's the same yesterday, today, and
[47:59] forever.
[48:00] Amen. And he said the the utterance of
[48:03] those people, what was on those mortals,
[48:05] he said God taking their fibers and
[48:08] moving in them. They didn't even realize
[48:10] it, but they were prophesying something
[48:12] about their own
[48:13] future. Asher, the name Asher means
[48:17] happy or blessed in an alternative
[48:20] meaning, happy or blessed. In Genesis 30
[48:24] and 12, it's the story of Asher's birth.
[48:27] Zilpa, Leah's maid, bear Jacob a second
[48:30] son. And Leah said, "Happy am I for the
[48:33] daughters will call me blessed." And she
[48:35] called his name Asher.
[48:39] You know, I think tonight that we should
[48:41] be happy to have been chosen by God.
[48:46] We should be happy. Listen to what Moses
[48:49] says to Israel when he's blessing the 12
[48:51] tribes. And he tells them this in
[48:53] Deuteronomy 33:29. Happy art thou, oh
[48:57] Israel. Who is like unto thee, oh people
[49:00] saved by the Lord? The shield of thy
[49:03] help, and who is the sword of thy
[49:05] excellency? Thine enemies shall be found
[49:07] liars unto thee. I love that scripture
[49:10] that we ought to put that on our that
[49:12] your enemies will be found to be liars.
[49:14] That old accuser that accuses you even
[49:17] when he knows what you did and he can
[49:19] accuse you of it, but he'll be found to
[49:20] be a liar because you never did it in
[49:22] the first place. Your sin goes back on
[49:24] him. Thine enemy shall be found liars
[49:27] unto thee and thou shalt tread upon
[49:29] their high places. Oh my. Psalm 144:9,
[49:33] he says, "I will sing a new song unto
[49:35] thee, oh God, upon a sultry and an
[49:37] instrument of 10 strings will I sing
[49:39] praises unto thee." Oh my, I believe I
[49:43] believe we can still be happy today.
[49:44] Verse 10, it is he that giveth salvation
[49:46] unto kings, who deliverth David, his
[49:49] servant, from the hurtful sword. Rid me
[49:51] and deliver me from the hand of strange
[49:53] children, whose mouth speakaketh vanity,
[49:55] and the right hand is the right hand of
[49:56] falsehood that are sons. And I love
[49:59] this. In the Old Testament, happiness
[50:01] was tied to uh doing well and your
[50:04] children doing well. But I think this
[50:06] would be a good thing for us that we
[50:08] could say, "Lord, I love you." But
[50:09] because our sons, he said, "Let our sons
[50:12] be maybe as plants grown up in their
[50:14] youth." And our daughters, I love the
[50:16] the the beautiful language here. Our
[50:17] daughters may be as cornerstones
[50:20] polished after the similitude of a
[50:22] palace. our sons. There nothing better
[50:24] than that, is there? Watching your sons
[50:26] and daughters grow up into being become
[50:28] real men of God and women of God. That
[50:31] our sons may grow up as plants, our
[50:33] daughters may be as cornerstones. Verse
[50:35] 13, that our garners may be full,
[50:38] affording all manner of store, that our
[50:40] sheep may bring forth thousands and
[50:42] 10,000s in our streets, that our oxen
[50:45] may be strong to labor, that there be no
[50:48] breaking in nor going out, that there be
[50:50] no complaining in our streets. Oh, oh,
[50:52] that that would be a good thing to pray
[50:54] every morning. Be no complaining in our
[50:56] streets. Happy is that people that is in
[50:59] such a case. And he goes a little bit
[51:01] further. He said, "Yay, happy is that
[51:03] people whose God is the Lord." I believe
[51:06] we can still say amen to that today. He
[51:08] chose you. You didn't choose him. He
[51:10] chose you. He chose me. And so, we ought
[51:12] to be happy about that. Yes. The New
[51:16] Testament takes it a little bit further
[51:18] and it actually tells us that we can be
[51:20] happy. Brother Danny, and that we are
[51:22] blessed even when we don't feel like it.
[51:26] I know this is simple tonight, but it it
[51:28] just caught my attention as I saw the
[51:30] meaning of Asher's name and how he was
[51:33] blessed materially. But the New
[51:35] Testament says this, "Blessed are ye."
[51:37] That word blessed is actually happy when
[51:40] men shall revile you and persecute you
[51:43] and shall say all manner of evil against
[51:46] you falsely for my sake. rejoice and be
[51:50] exceeding glad for great is your reward
[51:52] in heaven. For so persecuted they the
[51:55] prophets which were before you. So he's
[51:57] talking about a happiness that's more
[51:59] than just what you have. And we ought to
[52:01] thank God for what we have. We ought to
[52:02] thank God for our children. We ought to
[52:04] thank God for our church. We ought to
[52:06] thank God for our wife or our husband.
[52:08] We ought to thank God for that. But he
[52:09] said beyond that, even when you're being
[52:11] persecuted, rejoice over that because
[52:13] you're laying up treasures in heaven.
[52:15] Every bad thing they say about you just
[52:18] increases your store up in heaven of
[52:20] treasures. Your crown just gets a little
[52:22] bit bigger.
[52:26] Rejoice and be exceeding glad.
[52:29] Oh my. 1 Peter 4:14. If you be
[52:32] reproached for the name of Christ, happy
[52:34] are ye.
[52:36] Amen. For the spirit of glory and of God
[52:40] resteth upon you. Yeah. And on their
[52:43] part, he's evil spoken of, but on your
[52:45] part, he's glorified.
[52:48] Somebody's got to say something good
[52:50] about him. Somebody's got to be positive
[52:52] about it. Somebody's got to got to bless
[52:54] the Lord. Everybody's cursing the Lord.
[52:57] Listen, how many times have you heard
[52:58] his name taken in vain this week? And
[53:00] how many times have you heard somebody
[53:02] somebody come and begin to curse and and
[53:05] act like a fool and in that and today it
[53:07] seems like people don't have any
[53:08] restraint? Well, if if you hear that all
[53:10] week, why can't we come in the house of
[53:12] God once in a while and say, "Lord, I
[53:14] bless your name. I worship you. You're
[53:17] my God. You're my savior. You're my
[53:19] healer." Why can't we do that once in a
[53:21] while? Yes, sir. Amen. If they can curse
[53:23] him all week long, we can surely get
[53:25] together in the house of God and tell
[53:27] him how much we love him.
[53:30] Amen.
[53:32] Hallelujah. Paul takes it just a step
[53:34] further and he said, "Rejoice in the
[53:36] Lord always. And again I say rejoice.
[53:41] And he wrote that with his hands tied
[53:45] together and in a prison house.
[53:49] He said, "Always
[53:51] rejoice." Amen. I believe he knew what
[53:53] he was talking about.
[53:56] You were created to be happy. Yeah. Did
[53:58] you know that? Brother Brandon said,
[54:00] "God don't want you to be frowning. God
[54:02] wants you to be happy." Yes. So the next
[54:04] time you get up and you're just all
[54:06] moody and upset and got up on the wrong
[54:10] side of the bed, I asked Peter, brother
[54:12] Danny raised his hand. I asked Peter the
[54:15] other day, I said, "Have you ever woke
[54:17] up grouchy?" And he said, "Well, I guess
[54:18] I have." I said, "Well, sometimes I wake
[54:21] up grouchy and sometimes I let her
[54:26] sleep." Now, my wife's a very happy
[54:28] person. But see, God don't want you to
[54:30] be frowning. God wants you to be happy.
[54:34] He said the human heart was made to be
[54:35] happy. Worry will cause cancer. Temper
[54:38] will cause cancer. Don't never be upset.
[54:40] Just walk in his love.
[54:43] He said, see, you were made to be happy
[54:45] and free. Free. You were made to live
[54:48] like children before your father and
[54:51] know that he makes every day,
[54:53] everything. Someone say everything.
[54:56] Everything work right for you each day.
[55:00] Yeah. So, if something happened today,
[55:02] maybe maybe you had a hard time at
[55:03] school or at work or whatever it is, or
[55:05] even worse if if your work is school and
[55:08] and and and if you're you're in you find
[55:10] yourself maybe you've been through the
[55:12] meal and you're thinking, well, well, I
[55:14] I've been through a lot today and things
[55:16] happened that were bad. There's nothing
[55:18] good can come out of that. But a prophet
[55:19] of God told us that every day he's
[55:22] making everything work out for our good.
[55:25] We can't see it no more than children
[55:27] understand why they can't have candy all
[55:28] the time. But we know he's a good God
[55:31] and he's able to make it work right.
[55:33] Hallelujah.
[55:35] He's able to do exceedingly and
[55:37] abundantly even more than we could ask
[55:38] or think. Yes. I'm going to get myself
[55:41] in trouble here, but brother Brandham
[55:44] describes getting
[55:45] older and how he didn't want to become
[55:48] unhappy. And this is going to tie back
[55:50] into Asher. I
[55:53] promise. So keep this in your mind.
[55:56] Brother Brandon talks, we got lots of
[55:58] senior saints and we I want you to know
[56:00] how much we appreciate you. I've looked
[56:03] back, I've told you before, I look back
[56:04] sometimes on the monitor in the back and
[56:06] I see all of our elders sitting here
[56:07] before anybody else and and they get
[56:10] here early and and they're always here.
[56:13] I thank you for being here. But you
[56:16] know, God wants you to be happy even
[56:18] when you get
[56:19] older. He don't want you to be sad. He
[56:21] don't want you to be upset. He wants you
[56:23] to learn to trust him. Learn to lean on
[56:26] him. And as you get older, you can do
[56:28] that because you've been through some
[56:30] things. You've seen God is good. And and
[56:33] and and David said it like this. He
[56:35] said, "I was young, but now I'm old, but
[56:36] I've never seen a seed forsaken. I've
[56:39] never seen the righteous forsaken or
[56:41] seed begging bread." Yes. But brother
[56:44] Random taught us he describes getting
[56:46] older and and and how he didn't want to
[56:50] become unhappy because of the condition
[56:53] of his body. And this would apply to
[56:54] sick people as well. People have
[56:56] experienced a lot of physical sickness
[56:58] even if they're young. He said, "I'm
[57:00] getting old. I know that. Each day I get
[57:02] a new ache and pain. Every one of us
[57:05] do." He said, "You might as well tell
[57:06] the
[57:08] truth." I thought, "God, don't let me
[57:11] listen.
[57:12] Yeah, you're going to hurt. That's part
[57:14] of life. Pain is a part of our
[57:16] experience down here. There's coming a
[57:18] day when there'll be no more pain,
[57:20] right?
[57:22] But he said, I said, God, don't let me.
[57:24] He said, one of the most miserable
[57:25] things is see a man or woman who's never
[57:27] accepted Christ. So, so church, if this
[57:31] don't apply to you, don't make it apply
[57:32] to you. If you've accepted Christ, you
[57:34] don't have to be like this. But he's
[57:36] he's talking about somebody who's never
[57:37] accepted Christ, just lived an old
[57:39] Mossback church member. meaner than
[57:42] Satan
[57:44] himself. See him out there with crab old
[57:47] something? Well, I tell you, I don't
[57:48] believe in any God. Never. And Brother
[57:50] Brown gets very descriptive. He said,
[57:52] "That's the horriblest crown that Satan
[57:54] can crown life with. A grouchy old woman
[57:57] about 60 or 70 years old with fat
[58:00] hanging down under her arms and wrinkles
[58:02] all over her face and her hair bobbed up
[58:04] in four or five different colors and
[58:05] strutting herself down a pair of little
[58:07] shorts. If that ain't the crown of
[58:09] Satan," he said. have never seen it or
[58:11] some old crab man. He said, "Oh God," he
[58:14] said, "give me grace to never complain."
[58:17] That ought to all of us ought to pray
[58:18] that way. And we realize that we have
[58:20] things to complain about, especially as
[58:22] you get older, right? Well, you got
[58:24] things to complain about, but give me
[58:26] grace, Lord, to never complain. And I
[58:29] want my life, Lord. I want my people's
[58:31] life. He said, "God grant that our life
[58:34] could be crowned. No matter if we
[58:36] suffer, whatever takes place, how many
[58:38] turns against me," he said, "I know this
[58:40] one thing in my life. As I get older, my
[58:42] friends, the stream behind me will soon
[58:45] be running out narrower and narrower as
[58:47] I go down the road." Now, he's going to
[58:49] put his finger on something that really
[58:52] affects our elders. And that's that many
[58:56] of their friends that they had and and
[58:58] their co-workers and their
[58:59] acquaintances, as you get older, you've
[59:01] got fewer and fewer friends that that
[59:04] are real close to you because either
[59:05] they've died off or they've left,
[59:07] they've moved. And and so as you get
[59:09] older, you tend to have less friends and
[59:11] you tend to be more lonely. And and I
[59:13] think us young people ought to recognize
[59:15] that and try to help out any way that we
[59:17] can in in helping our our elders and
[59:20] recognizing that. But he he said uh he
[59:23] he said uh he said he he identifies this
[59:26] as one of the sources of unhappiness in
[59:29] elders. He said I know one thing it'll
[59:31] come to pass after a while there'll be
[59:32] nobody come to me and ask me advice.
[59:36] Now, that hurts, especially if you got
[59:39] advice to give,
[59:41] and the older you get, the more advice
[59:43] you got,
[59:45] right? I find myself just advising
[59:47] myself, you know, cuz nobody else wants
[59:49] to listen to me, so I'll just give
[59:50] myself advice, you know? But as you get
[59:54] older, you kind of get like, well, I've
[59:56] learned a few things. And you have,
[59:58] right? And there's wisdom in getting and
[1:00:00] getting older. And you've been down, but
[1:00:02] you feel like now some of you older
[1:00:04] people could say amen to you. You feel
[1:00:05] like nobody's listening. Like you're
[1:00:08] talking all the time, but nobody's
[1:00:10] listening. Huh? And you know that that
[1:00:12] person, you know, got them money
[1:00:13] troubles, you know, and you know how to
[1:00:15] fix it cuz you fixed it in your life,
[1:00:16] but but they won't listen.
[1:00:19] Woo! I put my finger on something Mary.
[1:00:22] that person's got problems in their
[1:00:23] marriage and you know how you know what
[1:00:25] you had to do to fix it and the
[1:00:26] forgiveness you had to have to fix it
[1:00:28] but but you've been through it and and
[1:00:29] so you'd like to tell them but nobody
[1:00:31] wants to come and look for advice and
[1:00:34] that bothers you and listen what he said
[1:00:37] the ones who know me in my younger days
[1:00:39] will be gone on if I shall live I I've
[1:00:41] seen preachers get all tore up older
[1:00:43] preachers elder ministry get all tore up
[1:00:46] because nobody come to them for advice
[1:00:48] anymore and so they begin to to to lash
[1:00:50] out at people just because and it's just
[1:00:53] a symptom of getting older. It's not
[1:00:54] that the people hate you or or that
[1:00:56] people are wrong. They just do things
[1:00:58] differently, right? Every generation's
[1:01:00] got their own chance at revival, their
[1:01:02] own and and and they look at the focus
[1:01:04] on the young people and stuff and it
[1:01:05] makes them, well, nobody asked me if we
[1:01:08] should play that song.
[1:01:12] Nobody asked me if we should do this,
[1:01:14] that, or the other. And again, we I
[1:01:16] think we ought to seek advice from our
[1:01:18] elders. But if you get in that
[1:01:20] condition, he said, I he said, I know
[1:01:22] I'll get in that place where no one will
[1:01:23] ask me for advice. The ones who knew me
[1:01:25] in my younger days will be gone on if I
[1:01:27] shall live. My friends will get fewer
[1:01:29] and fewer as I get older. He said, I
[1:01:31] know that someday I've got to die. I
[1:01:33] hope that God never let Satan crown me
[1:01:35] as an old crab, indifferent man, and my
[1:01:38] wife an old nagging woman. Or your wife,
[1:01:40] he said, or you that way. I pray,
[1:01:42] brother, that our lives will be crowned
[1:01:44] with the fruits of the spirit. How many
[1:01:45] would pray this with me today? Well, I
[1:01:47] believe we got some elders here whose
[1:01:49] lives have been crowned with the fruit
[1:01:50] of the spirit. I I I trust that's each
[1:01:52] and every one of us. He said, I pray
[1:01:54] that our lives will be crowned with the
[1:01:55] fruits of the spirit. Love, joy,
[1:01:57] longsuffering, gentleness, patience,
[1:02:00] truth, faith in the Holy Spirit. Let me
[1:02:02] let my life be like that bubbling brook
[1:02:04] that brother Brandham talked about. That
[1:02:06] bubbling brook. He talked about the
[1:02:07] brook and that picture is of Greer
[1:02:10] Spring up by Alton, Missouri. When I
[1:02:12] when I read about the bubbling brook
[1:02:13] where the Brown talks about, I think
[1:02:15] about that spring because you walk a
[1:02:17] whole mile to get down into it and then
[1:02:19] when you get down there uh you got to
[1:02:21] walk a whole mile uphill to get back.
[1:02:23] But I've been there and when it's hot,
[1:02:25] I've been there when it's
[1:02:27] 100° and brother David that when you're
[1:02:30] when it's 100° that uh that is just as
[1:02:33] cool down there and just as fresh and
[1:02:35] there's moss all over everything. It's
[1:02:37] not touch of anything and the water is
[1:02:39] just gurgling. It puts out like I think
[1:02:41] I think 20 million gallons a day or some
[1:02:43] insane number of water that it puts out.
[1:02:45] It's the second largest spring in
[1:02:46] Missouri. And as it's putting out the
[1:02:49] water, it's just bubbling up. You can't
[1:02:50] really see where it comes from. It just
[1:02:52] comes up out of the ground. Bubbles up
[1:02:54] and it never stops. It never stop. God
[1:02:56] help me to be like that. Brother Brandon
[1:02:59] saw a brook like that and he said he
[1:03:01] said it was just bubbling up in the
[1:03:02] desert in dry places in dry seasons. It
[1:03:05] just kept bubbling. Kept bubbling. And
[1:03:07] he come by and he said, he said, "Little
[1:03:09] Brooke," he said, "why do you bubble?"
[1:03:11] He said, "What makes you bubble?" He
[1:03:13] said, he said, "Is it because I drink
[1:03:15] from you?" He said, "If little Brooke
[1:03:16] could have talked, it said, 'N no, it's
[1:03:17] not because you drink from me." He said,
[1:03:19] "Is it because the animals drink from
[1:03:21] you?" He said, "No, not because the
[1:03:22] animals drink from me, but he said,
[1:03:24] there's something inside me bubbling
[1:03:26] me." Amen. Something on the inside of
[1:03:29] that b is some force is causing it to
[1:03:32] bubble up. Oh, let me whether I'm young
[1:03:34] or old or middle-aged or whatever it is
[1:03:36] that I am, let me have that bubbling
[1:03:39] brook inside of me, where I'm never
[1:03:41] depressed and to the point where I can't
[1:03:43] find the joy of the Lord, where I'm
[1:03:45] never I you'll be forsaken sometimes.
[1:03:47] You'll be hurt sometimes. You'll be
[1:03:49] upset. That's natural. That's a part of
[1:03:51] life. But let me never become so upset
[1:03:53] that I can't feel that urging and that
[1:03:55] moving of the Holy Spirit in my life.
[1:03:59] Something's bubbling me. He said,
[1:04:01] "That's the way it is with a
[1:04:02] spiritfilled life." He said, "See, he
[1:04:04] gives you wells of water springing up
[1:04:07] unto everlasting life, an artisian
[1:04:09] overflowing gusher that's constantly
[1:04:12] flowing." He said, "Whether the rest of
[1:04:13] the church is up or down, you're still
[1:04:15] at that well." Glory to God. He said,
[1:04:18] "Why would you take an old
[1:04:18] denominational system and sister full of
[1:04:21] parasites and everything else and drink
[1:04:23] around that stagnated stuff when you're
[1:04:25] invited to a fountain, an artisian
[1:04:28] well?" He he talked about that spring.
[1:04:30] He said, "I think how it just pushed and
[1:04:32] juggled and gurgled and laughed and
[1:04:34] joyed and jumped and
[1:04:36] frolicked." Amen. Frolicked cold, rainy,
[1:04:40] hot, dry. When all the rest of the
[1:04:42] country was drying up, it was bubbling
[1:04:44] just like it always did. Oh, God, help
[1:04:47] me to be like that. When everything's
[1:04:49] dry and I said, "Well, there's no
[1:04:50] revival here and there's no revival
[1:04:51] there. Let me be something on the inside
[1:04:54] of me that bubbles up." That's what
[1:04:56] Asher was born in. He said, "You're
[1:04:57] going to be put in a land where there's
[1:04:59] happiness." says, "I believe every
[1:05:00] member of the bride has been birthed
[1:05:02] into that land."
[1:05:04] Hallelujah. He said, "Cuz it was it was
[1:05:07] bubbling." He said, "Cold, rainy, hot,
[1:05:09] dry." When all the rest of the country
[1:05:10] was drying up, it was bubbling just like
[1:05:12] it always did. Cuz it was deeprooted way
[1:05:15] down in the rocks that come forth. Oh,
[1:05:17] let me live by that gusher. How many can
[1:05:19] say amen to that tonight? Let me live by
[1:05:22] that gusher. Take all the old man-made
[1:05:24] systems you want to all your old
[1:05:25] stagnated. Well, that's why I love the
[1:05:27] message of the hour. The message is just
[1:05:29] as fresh to me, brother Stewart, today
[1:05:30] as it was the first time I read it. Let
[1:05:33] me let me stay by that well. Let me stay
[1:05:35] there by the promises of God. That tells
[1:05:37] me I'm as bright. Tells me I'm going to
[1:05:39] make it. Tells me I'm going in a
[1:05:41] rapture. Tells me I'm healed. Let me
[1:05:43] stay right there. What about you,
[1:05:44] church? Let me stay at my where my joy
[1:05:47] is. Hallelujah. He said, "Let me come."
[1:05:50] He said, "You can have all the man-made
[1:05:52] systems, all the stagnated systems. Let
[1:05:53] me come to this fountain. Let me come
[1:05:55] there where he is just full. He is my
[1:05:58] joy. He is my light. He is my strength.
[1:06:00] He is my water. He is my life. He is my
[1:06:02] healer. He's my savior. He is my king.
[1:06:05] Everything that I have need of is found
[1:06:07] in him. Why would I want to go to
[1:06:09] anything else?
[1:06:11] Hallelujah. Jesus said, "He that
[1:06:12] believeth on me, as the scripture said,
[1:06:14] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[1:06:17] living water." Oh, but in the next
[1:06:19] verse, he explains it. He said, "This
[1:06:21] spake he of the spirit which they that
[1:06:24] believe on him should receive." At that
[1:06:27] time the Holy Ghost was not yet given,
[1:06:29] but now the Holy Ghost has been given to
[1:06:31] all those he said that would receive it.
[1:06:34] Amen. Oh, I I trust you've received it
[1:06:37] today. So, the water is the
[1:06:39] spirit. We find that happiness and joy
[1:06:42] is always associated with the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost. Do you know that? Acts chapter 13
[1:06:47] and verse 52. And the disciples were
[1:06:50] filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:53] Romans 14:17, for the kingdom of God is
[1:06:56] not meat and drink, but righteousness
[1:06:57] and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:00] True happiness is joy. It's something
[1:07:02] that goes beyond just the the happiness
[1:07:04] of a natural natural life, but it's a
[1:07:07] joy in your heart. He said, now in
[1:07:09] Romans 15:13, now the God of hope fill
[1:07:11] you. He said, with all joy and peace in
[1:07:14] believing that you may abound in hope
[1:07:16] through the power of the Holy Ghost. 1
[1:07:18] Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 5. He
[1:07:20] said, "Our gospel came not unto you in
[1:07:21] word only, but also in power and in the
[1:07:24] Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you
[1:07:26] know what manner of men we were among
[1:07:27] you for your sake. And you become
[1:07:29] followers of us and of the Lord, having
[1:07:31] received the word." I love the how he
[1:07:33] puts these two things together. In much
[1:07:35] affliction with joy of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:38] Yeah. You ever looked at those two
[1:07:40] things and you think, well, that that
[1:07:41] can't be true. You receive the word in
[1:07:43] much affliction with joy of the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost. But didn't he tell you to rejoice
[1:07:47] when you had a trial? Right? And the
[1:07:50] only way you can do that, you can't do
[1:07:51] that by the carnal mind. There's only
[1:07:53] one way to do that, and that's by the
[1:07:55] joy of the Holy Ghost. Listen to me,
[1:07:57] church. If you don't have that joy, if
[1:07:59] you don't have that bubbling, I'd be
[1:08:00] seeking for it. I'd be looking for it.
[1:08:02] I'd be trying to find him. He's a great
[1:08:04] fountain of life. He can keep you. You
[1:08:06] don't have to sit all depressed and
[1:08:08] convicted in church anymore. But you can
[1:08:11] find the one who who your soul loves.
[1:08:13] And yeah, he there's always joy with
[1:08:15] him.
[1:08:18] Hallelujah. Amen. I've told these young
[1:08:21] people, I said, don't ever let someone
[1:08:23] else control your joy. Not a girlfriend
[1:08:26] or a boyfriend or a husband or a wife or
[1:08:29] a church or a pastor. You don't let
[1:08:32] nobody control your joy. Your joy comes
[1:08:34] from the Holy Ghost, not from them. Yes,
[1:08:37] sir.
[1:08:39] Hallelujah.
[1:08:41] Amen.
[1:08:44] Hallelujah. Listen what he says. He said
[1:08:46] you become, he said, you you had
[1:08:48] received the word in much affliction
[1:08:49] with joy of the Holy Ghost so that you
[1:08:51] were
[1:08:52] examples. When you receive the word with
[1:08:54] joy, you become an example. That's
[1:08:56] right. Yeah. An example to all that
[1:08:59] believe in Macedonia and Akaya. For from
[1:09:01] you sounded out the word of the Lord,
[1:09:03] not only in Macedonia and Aaya, but also
[1:09:05] in every place your faith to God were to
[1:09:07] spread abroad. He said, so that we need
[1:09:10] not to speak anything. Listen, it's a
[1:09:12] whole lot easier to witness when you got
[1:09:13] joy in your heart. It's a whole lot
[1:09:16] easier to tell somebody you're a
[1:09:17] Christian or that you believe the
[1:09:19] message when you got joy in your heart.
[1:09:21] And and it's unexplainable joy. Peace
[1:09:23] that passes understanding. Right. Yeah.
[1:09:27] Right. And I'm not asking you to be
[1:09:29] happy that that you went through a
[1:09:30] trial. I'm not asking you to be happy
[1:09:32] that you're going through a dark place
[1:09:33] in your life. I recognize you're going
[1:09:35] to be sad about some things. But I'm
[1:09:37] telling you, there's something on the
[1:09:38] inside that that that that you can turn
[1:09:40] to. There's happiness there if you'll
[1:09:42] just turn to him today.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah.
[1:09:47] It's
[1:09:50] there. Brother Brandon said, "The
[1:09:52] greatest thing I find against the church
[1:09:53] tonight is fear. Everybody's scared to
[1:09:56] death about something. And I know that
[1:09:58] there are people so afraid that another
[1:10:00] preacher is going to fall that they just
[1:10:01] can't trust a pastor. And they just
[1:10:04] can't trust a preacher. and they just
[1:10:06] can't they just can't bring themselves
[1:10:08] or maybe men have done them wrongs, they
[1:10:10] can't trust a man, maybe a woman's done
[1:10:12] them wrong, they can't trust women and
[1:10:14] and they just get but listen, we got to
[1:10:16] move beyond that at some point in our
[1:10:18] life, church, and recognize that we got
[1:10:20] to lose the fear of that. Realize God's
[1:10:23] in control. He knows what he's doing.
[1:10:26] Whatever happens in our life is going to
[1:10:28] be for our good. Period. There's no
[1:10:30] exceptions to that. Everything that
[1:10:32] happens, the footsteps of the righteous
[1:10:35] are ordered of the Lord.
[1:10:37] Amen. Well, and we got to acknowledge
[1:10:40] the word of God is true about that. As
[1:10:41] difficult as it can be at times, he
[1:10:43] said, "The greatest thing I find is
[1:10:45] fear. Everybody's scared to death about
[1:10:46] something." He said, "What are you
[1:10:47] scared about? If a man's born again, he
[1:10:49] should be happy, carefree." He said,
[1:10:52] "Just like these fellows singing up here
[1:10:54] and the brother testifying back there,
[1:10:56] just free."
[1:10:58] He said, "There ain't nothing can."
[1:10:59] Don't you like to be in church when it's
[1:11:01] free?
[1:11:03] I've been in church when it's bound up
[1:11:04] and everybody's looking at one another
[1:11:06] and wondering who the achen is and and
[1:11:08] looking around to see who sinned and who
[1:11:10] did this, that, or the other. I don't
[1:11:12] want to go to church like that. I want
[1:11:13] to go to church where it's free and the
[1:11:15] presence of God is moving and and people
[1:11:18] are accepting the word. And let me be in
[1:11:20] a place where the word of God is being
[1:11:21] preached and people are responding to
[1:11:23] it. Why? Because they're free to respond
[1:11:25] to it. Oh, that's what we want, church.
[1:11:28] We want joy in our lives. The joy of the
[1:11:30] Holy Ghost. He said nothing, he said
[1:11:32] that. He said nothing can harm you,
[1:11:34] nothing present, nothing future, nothing
[1:11:36] can separate us from the love of God
[1:11:38] that's in Christ. God has promised. He's
[1:11:40] called by election. He set his church in
[1:11:43] order. No man can come to me except the
[1:11:44] father draws him. You never come to God
[1:11:46] because you wanted to. You come because
[1:11:48] Christ called you. God called you. And
[1:11:50] he that comes to me, I will in no wise
[1:11:52] cast out. I'll give him everlasting
[1:11:54] life. Not just lasting for a week, one
[1:11:56] revival to another, but everlasting
[1:11:58] eternal life, and we'll raise him up at
[1:12:00] the last day. He said, "Oh my, if that
[1:12:02] don't take the wind out of Satan's
[1:12:04] sails, I don't know what does." He said,
[1:12:06] "How do you know?" I said, "Jesus said
[1:12:08] so." Thus sayeth the Lord. Jesus said,
[1:12:12] "How do you know you're saved?" Jesus
[1:12:13] said so. How do you know you got the
[1:12:15] Holy Ghost? He said so.
[1:12:18] He identified it in my life. He said,
[1:12:20] "How do I know Jesus said so? Thus
[1:12:22] sayith the Lord. Jesus said so. That
[1:12:23] settles it. If he said it, I believe it.
[1:12:26] Listen to this. He said in John 5:24, he
[1:12:28] said, "A pet subject to me. He that I
[1:12:31] know there's message preachers who I've
[1:12:33] been told that we can't preach this
[1:12:35] anymore because it's too easy." Well, I
[1:12:37] believe we can preach what a prophet
[1:12:38] said. He said, "He that heareth my words
[1:12:41] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:12:43] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:12:45] condemnation, but is passed from death
[1:12:47] unto life." Say, "That's pretty easy,
[1:12:49] brother Brandham." He said, "No man,
[1:12:52] hallelujah, no man can believe Jesus to
[1:12:55] be the Christ in his heart and will be
[1:12:56] the same man that he was before." He
[1:12:58] wasn't preaching a gospel that won't
[1:13:00] change you. But if you'll do what God
[1:13:02] said, you pass from death unto life and
[1:13:04] you will be changed. Amen.
[1:13:08] Hallelujah. We even find
[1:13:10] happiness with a bad lot in life and
[1:13:13] even in old age. I'm going to bring this
[1:13:16] all the way around. You know, we're
[1:13:17] going to connect it back to Asher. He
[1:13:20] said, "Brother Ben, you've preached all
[1:13:21] evening and you've not talked about
[1:13:23] Asher." Let me read Luke chapter
[1:13:27] 2:36. There was one
[1:13:29] Anna, a prophetus, the daughter of
[1:13:32] Fenule, of the tribe of Asher. It's
[1:13:36] spelled a little different in the Greek
[1:13:37] than it was in the Hebrew. Of the tribe
[1:13:39] of
[1:13:40] Asher. She was of a great
[1:13:43] age and had lived with a husband seven
[1:13:46] years from her virginity. And she was a
[1:13:48] widow of about four score and four
[1:13:50] years. So she was either 84 years old or
[1:13:52] she had been a widow for 84 years. She
[1:13:55] was very
[1:13:58] old
[1:14:00] and which departed not from the temple.
[1:14:03] I'm sorry some of y'all are that old.
[1:14:05] I'm
[1:14:07] sorry. But you know it's okay to
[1:14:09] acknowledge that's a lot of years. You
[1:14:11] made it. Thank God. It's God hand God's
[1:14:14] hand on your life. Right. How many times
[1:14:16] you elders can we ought to be able to
[1:14:18] rejoice cuz how many times could you
[1:14:20] have gone out? How many times could you
[1:14:21] have hit somebody or somebody hits you
[1:14:23] or or or that sickness that you got?
[1:14:24] Brother Harvey, they told you you
[1:14:26] weren't going to be able to make it. You
[1:14:27] weren't going to live. But you're here
[1:14:28] today after 20 years later. Why? Because
[1:14:31] God kept you. God's a good God. He's a
[1:14:33] God of health and healing. And thank God
[1:14:36] for that. So if you've reached, as the
[1:14:39] Bible says, a great age, then we ought
[1:14:42] to be happy about it.
[1:14:46] And she she she was of the tribe of
[1:14:48] Asher.
[1:14:50] Hallelujah. And she was a a widow of
[1:14:53] about 84 years which departed not from
[1:14:56] the temple but served God with fastings
[1:14:58] and prayers night and day. She'd had a
[1:15:01] tough life. Brother Brandham tells us
[1:15:03] she was
[1:15:04] blind and she'd had a very difficult
[1:15:07] life and unable maybe to do what most
[1:15:10] people did. maybe living on charity in
[1:15:13] the temple, but she was looking for one
[1:15:16] thing. And it made me it made me happy
[1:15:18] for some of you, some of our elders,
[1:15:20] because I realize some of y'all are in
[1:15:21] church all the time and you're like Anna
[1:15:23] the prophetist. She she was always in
[1:15:25] the house of God and she was there
[1:15:27] because she maybe she didn't have
[1:15:28] nothing else to do, but she didn't come
[1:15:30] begrudgingly or or say, "Well, it's
[1:15:32] another service. I got to go." There was
[1:15:33] something in her heart for for all of
[1:15:35] them years. Listen, she was only married
[1:15:38] for seven
[1:15:39] years before her husband died and then
[1:15:42] she was a widow for all for these
[1:15:44] decades. How can you give thanks to God
[1:15:47] with that kind of a situation in your
[1:15:49] life? But listen what she does. He says
[1:15:52] she coming in that
[1:15:54] instant when Jesus had been brought into
[1:15:57] the temple on the eighth day and here
[1:16:01] they brought him in were standing in
[1:16:02] line waiting with all the other babies.
[1:16:04] And remember Simeon had come up and
[1:16:07] Simeon came up and and acknowledged who
[1:16:09] he was because the Lord had revealed to
[1:16:11] him said, "You're not going to die until
[1:16:13] you see him." And here come Anna, blind
[1:16:16] Anna, walking up and she come to the
[1:16:19] same spot. Brother Brandon said she knew
[1:16:21] Simeon. Simeon's revelation was right.
[1:16:24] Hallelujah. Listen to me, church. I
[1:16:26] didn't get my own revelation, but I
[1:16:28] believe that God sent a prophet in this
[1:16:30] hour and I believe his revelation was
[1:16:32] right.
[1:16:33] Right? She believed Simeon's revelation
[1:16:35] was right. And so she come in in that
[1:16:38] instant and gave
[1:16:39] thanks. Hallelujah. What was it? She
[1:16:42] lived to see the Lord and spake him of
[1:16:45] him to all them that look for redemption
[1:16:47] in Israel. Church, you may be going
[1:16:49] through a hard time. Maybe you're young.
[1:16:51] Maybe you're old. But you can be like
[1:16:52] Anna and say, "I'm going to talk about
[1:16:54] him. I'm going to tell I'm gonna tell
[1:16:56] others because not everybody has the
[1:16:57] hope I do. But I met him. I saw him. I
[1:17:00] know he's alive." Yes.
[1:17:03] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham,
[1:17:07] listen. He tells us she was blind. If
[1:17:09] anyone had a reason to be unhappy,
[1:17:14] critical,
[1:17:16] grumpy, crowned with a crabby spirit, it
[1:17:18] was her. But she was of the tribe of
[1:17:22] Asher. She'd found a happy position in
[1:17:26] Christ. So God, help each one of us to
[1:17:28] find that position.
[1:17:30] She was happy. She was blessed. She
[1:17:34] expected to see him. Listen, brother
[1:17:38] Brandhamstead in the temple the same day
[1:17:39] was an old blind I'm closing in just a
[1:17:41] few minutes. An old blind prophetist by
[1:17:43] the name of Anna. She didn't leave the
[1:17:45] temple. She prayed day and night. She
[1:17:47] was blind in her eyes, but she could see
[1:17:49] a lot farther than people could with
[1:17:50] their
[1:17:51] eyes. She was waiting for the
[1:17:53] consolation of Israel knowing that
[1:17:55] Christ would come someday. And the Holy
[1:17:58] Spirit struck her. She stood up on her
[1:18:00] feet in one place. Brother Brandon says
[1:18:01] the Holy Spirit said, "Stand up."
[1:18:05] And he be to move her, be to she be to
[1:18:08] be led by the Holy Ghost, moving through
[1:18:10] the temple around the critics. Right
[1:18:14] now, come on, church. We're coming to
[1:18:15] the end of a Wednesday night service.
[1:18:17] But sometimes to worship God like you
[1:18:19] ought to. Sometimes to seem like you
[1:18:21] ought to, you need to move around the
[1:18:23] critics.
[1:18:25] You need to quit thinking, "Well, that's
[1:18:26] what so and so think about me, what do
[1:18:28] my friends think about me? What will
[1:18:30] somebody else What do the other churches
[1:18:31] think about me? We need to we need to
[1:18:33] move around that critical spirit and
[1:18:36] find him. Amen. Because the most
[1:18:38] important thing is to find him. The most
[1:18:40] important thing is to worship him. The
[1:18:42] most important thing is to wash his
[1:18:44] feet. She moved around the critics. Oh
[1:18:48] God, help me to do that. Call me
[1:18:50] Pentecostal if you want to. Call me a
[1:18:52] holy roer if you want to. Say I'm a
[1:18:54] message fanatic if you want to. But let
[1:18:56] me move around the fanatics until I see
[1:18:58] the son of man revealed in our day. Let
[1:19:00] me move around the critics until I see
[1:19:03] God revealed to me. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[1:19:07] leading her to Christ raised up and
[1:19:09] prophesied and blessed Mary and the baby
[1:19:11] led of the spirit expecting it,
[1:19:13] believing it. Hallelujah. The Holy
[1:19:16] Spirit said, "Stand up." She made her
[1:19:17] way through the crowds through those
[1:19:19] critics, through the high priest and the
[1:19:21] money changers to a little couple
[1:19:23] standing in line, a baby wrapped in
[1:19:25] swaddling clothes. And the Holy Spirit
[1:19:27] led her to that exact spot just like
[1:19:31] he's led you here tonight on a Wednesday
[1:19:33] night. And she lifted up her hands and
[1:19:36] said, "This is him.
[1:19:38] I found him." I thank Oh my. I wonder
[1:19:42] how many of us church could recognize
[1:19:44] him here on a Wednesday night. We can
[1:19:46] say, "Thank you, Lord. I found you. I've
[1:19:48] had a difficult life. Things have been
[1:19:49] rough for me, but I found you. And
[1:19:51] there's a joy bubble up in my heart
[1:19:53] because I know the word is real."
[1:19:56] She was happy cuz she found him. So,
[1:19:59] there comes that old blind woman feeling
[1:20:01] around the crowd, going through the
[1:20:03] great host of the temple till she got
[1:20:05] right to where he was and lifted up her
[1:20:08] hands and blessed God. If the Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] could lead that blind prophetus because
[1:20:12] she was expecting to see the Lord Jesus
[1:20:14] when he comes. Can he lead you to the
[1:20:16] fountain of his blessings and grace? He
[1:20:18] said, "Be expecting it. Look forward to
[1:20:20] it. He's here." He said, "God is here.
[1:20:22] He's moving by his spirit, moving over
[1:20:24] all the earth. Signs and wonders when
[1:20:26] God moveth, move, oh Lord, on me."
[1:20:30] Listen to this. Brother Brandon said,
[1:20:32] "If you expect to come just to find
[1:20:34] something to criticize, the devil will
[1:20:37] sure show you plenty.
[1:20:39] to criticize. He certainly will. You get
[1:20:42] what you expect.
[1:20:45] So, I'm always amazed when people come
[1:20:47] to church and find out people are human.
[1:20:51] Just amazing to me. Brother Ben, I
[1:20:54] looked all at all the people and they
[1:20:56] were humans.
[1:20:58] Well, yeah, that's what they are. But,
[1:21:02] Brother Ben, they make mistakes.
[1:21:04] So did Israel. Yeah. So God's people
[1:21:07] have always made mistakes. But brother
[1:21:09] Brandon said, what Balum couldn't see
[1:21:12] was a brass serpent. All right. For
[1:21:14] their sin. What the devil can't see
[1:21:17] today is amen. It's a is an atonement
[1:21:20] for sin. What Bam couldn't see was a
[1:21:22] smitten rock. Amen. A gushing water
[1:21:25] among them. He said he couldn't see the
[1:21:27] shout of the king in the camp. Oh my. If
[1:21:31] you if you look for something to
[1:21:33] criticize, you'll find it. You'll get
[1:21:34] what you expect. Some of them say, "If I
[1:21:36] don't get it from the prayer line, if I
[1:21:37] see something like this, then I'll
[1:21:38] believe." You'll get what you expect.
[1:21:40] I'm expecting tonight to see the Holy
[1:21:43] Spirit come and manifest himself in
[1:21:45] power, pour out his glory upon this.
[1:21:47] Some of y'all know where this come from.
[1:21:48] It come from deep calls to the deep. I
[1:21:50] can almost quote it. I've watched that
[1:21:51] so many times even as a child. He said,
[1:21:54] he said, "I'm expecting to see the Holy
[1:21:56] Spirit come and manifest himself in
[1:21:58] power, pour out his glory in this
[1:22:00] building here. Many receive the baptism
[1:22:01] of the Holy Spirit. Sinners weep their
[1:22:03] way to Calvary. sick be healed all
[1:22:05] manner of signs and wonders because
[1:22:07] Jesus Christ has promised it and I
[1:22:09] believe his promise.
[1:22:12] Hallelujah. Let's read that last verse
[1:22:14] as the musicians go ahead and
[1:22:16] come Genesis 49:20. Back to the
[1:22:19] beginning
[1:22:20] again. Out of Asher his bread shall be
[1:22:24] fed and he shall yield royal dainties.
[1:22:27] This is Jacob's blessing of Asher.
[1:22:33] I I like that. Out of ashure, his bread
[1:22:35] shall be fat. His bread shall be fat. In
[1:22:39] other words, it will have become bread.
[1:22:41] His wheat will have become bread. The
[1:22:43] harvest will be good. There'll be lots
[1:22:46] and lots of bushels per acre to put it
[1:22:49] in a farming
[1:22:51] parlance. He said, "And that's what we
[1:22:53] are here for, friend." And brother
[1:22:54] Brandham saying this to stay in the
[1:22:56] presence of the sun till our little
[1:22:59] group of people oh let it be us tonight
[1:23:02] till it becomes so ripe to Christ it
[1:23:05] become bread on his
[1:23:07] table. That's what he said about Asher.
[1:23:09] He said your bread will be fat. I just
[1:23:11] want to stay here in the presence of the
[1:23:13] sun until I become bread on his
[1:23:16] [Music]
[1:23:18] table. I thought of this as well as
[1:23:20] we're closing. Asher's feet were dipped
[1:23:22] in oil. You know, when Jesus came here,
[1:23:25] you remember he come to Simon's house
[1:23:27] and they didn't wash his feet. They
[1:23:30] didn't anoint him with
[1:23:32] oil. But there was a little
[1:23:34] insignificant
[1:23:36] woman used all the money she had that
[1:23:38] she'd made in a very wrong and difficult
[1:23:42] way. She used that to buy oil to anoint
[1:23:45] his feet.
[1:23:50] She dipped his feet in
[1:23:52] oil. Oh,
[1:23:54] church. Oh, I I want to give him what he
[1:23:57] deserves tonight. I want to I want to
[1:23:59] bless his
[1:24:00] heart. He deserves a little praise. He
[1:24:04] said, "But I've been through some
[1:24:05] difficult things." I've told you this
[1:24:06] story before. Sometimes I feel like I'm
[1:24:08] just repeating myself, but I apologize
[1:24:10] for that. But it just was a a a moment
[1:24:14] in my life that kind of changed me. I
[1:24:17] was in the Philippines and and in in
[1:24:20] Manila and I'm sitting in the in a truck
[1:24:24] that was difficult for me to sit in. It
[1:24:27] was a box truck, but it was difficult
[1:24:28] cuz the cab was so tight and my knees
[1:24:31] are up against the dashboard. They don't
[1:24:32] make trucks over there like they do
[1:24:34] here. And but Paul knows he's been
[1:24:37] there. His wife's Filipino and and I
[1:24:39] it's, you know, it was just difficult. I
[1:24:41] was kind of grouchy. It was hot. But I
[1:24:43] had air conditioning in the cab. They
[1:24:46] didn't have air conditioning in the back
[1:24:47] of that box truck. And we were hauling
[1:24:50] kids to camp. Not in an air conditioned
[1:24:51] van like we have here for the kids. But
[1:24:53] we were hauling kids to a youth camp.
[1:24:56] And and they had the from a very young
[1:24:58] age, maybe five or six up to teenagers.
[1:25:01] And they just crammed into the back of
[1:25:02] that box truck. They're piled in and
[1:25:04] they got there's a sliding glass window
[1:25:06] so a little bit of air can get back
[1:25:08] where they're at. They got the air
[1:25:10] blowing and and as they're as we're
[1:25:14] sitting there I I begin to hear a little
[1:25:17] girl about 5 years old and she begin to
[1:25:19] sing. She began to sing I am so blessed.
[1:25:22] She sang in
[1:25:24] English. I am so blessed. God's been so
[1:25:28] good to
[1:25:30] me. I sit there thought I got nothing to
[1:25:33] complain about.
[1:25:35] I got nothing to complain about. if she
[1:25:37] can sit back there with joy in her heart
[1:25:39] thinking I she didn't know no better
[1:25:41] that's just what they always did things
[1:25:42] she said I I have been so blessed God's
[1:25:45] so good to me and when she started
[1:25:48] singing that I just broke down and
[1:25:49] started to cry I thought oh God let give
[1:25:52] me a joyful heart let me be let me be
[1:25:54] happy about what you've given me let me
[1:25:56] be like Asher let me realize my feet
[1:25:58] have been dipped in oil I've been
[1:26:00] anointed for the age that I'm living in
[1:26:02] I know some of y'all going through
[1:26:04] trouble I know you're facing bad reports
[1:26:06] I I know you're looking at things and
