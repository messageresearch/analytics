bless you turn with me to Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 going to kind of get away from our series a little bit but it's inspired by that uh this morning uh I want to uh speak to you um about uh I going to title it one step from the fire and freedom One Step from the fire and freedom Daniel 3:16 Shadrach mesach and abido answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter other words we don't have to think about it if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand O King if not be it known unto thee Oh King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem because of their sin and God allowed him to the king to fall into his hands the the city to fall into his hands he brought back literally thousands of Jews to Babylon the Bible says in 2 Kings 24:14 that he carried away all Jerusalem all the princes and all the Mighty Men of Valor even 10,000 captives all the Craftsmen and Smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land all the men of might even 7,000 and and Craftsmen and Smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon so it was literally thousands of people that were brought back at that time and I want to state to you this morning that you said brother Ben well the devil's out to get me well there's a reason he's out to get you it's because you are valuable in his sight as you're valuable in God's sight the devil sees how valuable you are to the kingdom of God and so he wants to take you out of the kingdom of God and make you work for him and so the more he attacks you you might as well just look at that as a badge of honor and say well you know I'm glad that the devil thinks so much of me that he would attack me like that and God would allow him to do that so it must be something that God thinks about me I must be pretty high on his list I believe we are this morning I believe we're the children of of God now and so these uh people were brought in to B it was an attempt to conquer a people not by force alone but by assimilation and we talked a little bit about that Wednesday night brother brandom taught us that the squeeze this hour would not be uh coming down on us uh in a way of uh of of material things though though that might happen from time to time but that wouldn't be the main squeeze in this time but the main thing would be that we would actually the devil would try to tell us what it doesn't matter anymore these little Loose Ends just they don't matter and so that's what this was it was an attempt by assimilation to actually bring them in bring them to Babylon make them Babylonian in their mindset make them make them Babylonian in their speech make them Babylonian in their worship and then when and then when you can make them remake them in your own image then you put them back in the land what have you got another bunch of Babylonians that's exactly what the devil has done through seven Church ages with denominationalism he didn't he didn't come in and say well Christianity wasn't true he tried that and it didn't work so what did he do he come into Christianity and attempted to make the church in a Babylonian religion and actually return it back to that now so it's the same thing now the idea to bring them back to Babylon and then to return them to their native land as Babylonians as representatives of that yeah but in Daniel chapter 1 and verse three we're taught that again he says the king spake to Ash panaz the master of his Unix he should bring certain of his he should bring certain of the children of is of the king seed and of the princes children in whom was no blemish well favored skillful in all wisdom cunning in knowledge understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's Palace I believe we have that kind of ability this morning God called you in this age because you have the ability to stand in the king's Palace and whom they might teach the learning in the tongue of the caldan he wanted them as trophies of the Triumph of Babylon over Israel he would have them as actually trophies of his Triumph that they would be living uh trophies he could he could look in his throne room and he could see that they were there and he could see well I conquered Jerusalem and the proof that I'm the Conqueror is these people serve me now and that's exactly what he wants to do young people he wants to take you out of the house of God and set you up as a trophy of Satan's Eden but I'll say this we've already become trophies of the grace of the Living God we don't need to be trophies of the enemy you're a trophy of God's grace right are you with me so far yes now he said among these were of the children of Judah Daniel haniah Michelle and Azariah unto whom the prince of the Unix gave names for he gave unto Daniel the name of belto AAR and to haniah of Shadrach to Mel of Meek to Azariah of abedo they were changing their identity changing their name to change their identity so that no one would hear their name and think they were Jews right they could blend into the call God you see what the devil's trying to do today he's trying to make make the church or even the bride like everybody else so no one would hear and think they were Jews now because if you got a name like Daniel or if you got a name like uh you got a name like hananiah people thought well that's a Jew but when you had a name like belto shazar or Shadrach put on them the names of his Gods so now uh he changed your identities but Daniel I love this Daniel 18 He purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself and and and listen to me this morning if you have a purpose in your heart to do the right thing to follow the word God Will Make A Way for that to happen in your life if you really purpose in Your Heart Lord I want to be in the house of God now you'll be tested on that but God Will Make A Way for that to happen you say why why do you say that brother the man because he's done it for me and he promised to do it right he did it for Daniel and the way that he did that with Daniel is he gave him favor with the king's man he gave him favor with the king's man just like he may have given you favor with a manager or favor with a boss or favor with an owner of a company he gave you favor so that you could be in the house of God he gave you favor so that you could work and provide for your family God does that for us but yet we know that he puts us to the test to see if we're going to stick with it or not right now and so in Daniel 11:17 it says as for these four children four children young people at the time that would grow up and God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom and Daniel had understanding ing in visions and dreams now Daniel was a prophet the other three were not but they beli what a prophet had to say and they followed a prophet in his stand for the word of God and I say we're doing the same thing today so in Daniel 1:19 it says the king communed with them and and you know you remember they fed them their everybody else got the wine and the King's meat and and Daniel and his friends they got they got pul they got uh basically vegetables is what they got and water and but when the time come he found uh that among all them all was found none like Daniel haniah Misha and Azariah therefore stood they before the king so out of these thousands that were brought out of the land of of Israel there was just four that that had an impact that made a difference listen the elect is not everybody out there not even everybody that claims to believe the message is elect but you and I have been called to something higher something different and we've been called to stand before the king and so there's got to be something in our lives where're hel to a higher standard but we've been enabled to do that because God has put that in us we're the elected of God you see election in this now he said therefore stood they before the King Daniel 120 and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them he found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his Realms they must have felt pretty good brother Wes that we made it we made it Kings appointed us we're young people man we've just raised up above all this man we're doing good you better watch out when you're doing good that's when your test comes yeah when everything seems like it's going right that's when your test comes you better look out they say the time to prepare for war is during a time of Peace that's the time you should be training for battle Yeah because you know if there's peace now there's war coming so the devil's always going to put you to the test and God's going to allow you to be put to the test because the gold that you are the deity that's been manifested in your life has got to be put to the fire right to manifest and to disclose what it is now it's already gold right you're you it's already in you the deity is already in you but it's got to be put to the fire you say why have I been through what I've been through in my life why did I have to make some of the mistakes that I made the gold that was in you had to be put through the fire and God already knew what was in you but you needed to know what was in you and the Hebrew children would never understand that they could face a fiery furnace until they faced one and they didn't give in they might have surprised even themselves that they had the courage to stand but there was something in them that wouldn't let them fall and I believe there's something in you today that will not let you fall yes sir thank you Lord amen there's always a test the the trial of our faith Peter tells us in 1 Peter 1:7 being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found un praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ brother B said the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction I love that that's the right kind of gold a fiery a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction in in chapter two of Daniel Daniel interprets Nebuchadnezzar's dream he talks to him about the dream and he he has the dream remember of the Gentile kingdoms and the image the image and he interprets that dream and we're we're told at the end of that chapter that Nebuchadnezzar changes his worship but you know he's idolatrous in his thinking he's idolatrous in his thinking and because of that instead of worshiping God he worships Daniel yeah right and an idolator in their thinking can never see beyond the man they always worship the man instead of worshiping God because because even though he saw what Daniel could do he didn't give glory to God now watch what he did and the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an ablation and sweet odors unto him and the King answered unto Daniel and said of a truth it is that your God is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing that thou couldst reveal this secret then then the king made Daniel a great man I'm sure the king probably said well we're not worshiping Daniel we're just honoring Daniel but his attitude towards Daniel was one of worship not just of respect yeah right and there's a line there we need to respect God's men yeah but we don't worship God's men we worship God alone so he had crossed that line and the Catholic Church will tell you today we don't worship Mary we just generate her and honor her as the mother of Christ why do you pray to her then well we don't worship brother Brandon but why why is it that no one else can preach right the truth is you've crossed over the line right from from from be from being a person that that honors a man to and respects the messenger of the age and believes what he said to cross over into worship so now watch now he said the king made Daniel a great man gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon now brother brand said when he become a great man now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and set it up out in the field and said that everybody would have to bow to that image he said did you ever notice the innocence of it who that image was made of it was Daniel the image of a man and didn't he say the spirits of the Gods Heathen you realize he took that from Daniel's message from the interpretation of the dream he makes an image of of gold yeah he tried oh my with a carnal understanding of the message he produces idolatry right now watch what he does he says and it said everybody would have to B he said you noce the innocence of it it was Daniel the image of a man and didn't he say the spirits of the Gods Heathen as we are today he said we got three or four of them the spirits of gods Liv in him and they made an image to Daniel and he said all that won't make bow of that image will be thrown in the fiery furnace he said you notice Daniel is off the scene at that time now Daniel was still alive in the time that this was done but he was off the scene he'd been sent away on business or something else he wasn't there so now uh again he said he made an image and it's believed by Scholars he said which I do believe that a Spirit-filled person would see it he worshiped Daniel is what he did and he made an image to Daniel and he called it belto shazar he called Daniel I don't know if I'm saying that right but I guess it don't matter because you don't know either right if somebody does let me know later not right now brother Joel later he called d Bel I can't even say it belshazzar which was the name of his God and he made an image and forced every person to worship that image right he said I want you to notice that at the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them so this is the beginning of the Gentile dispensation because he said Nebuchadnezzar you're that head of gold remember this the beginning of the god beginning to deal with the Gentiles while the while the Jewish age was still going on but God's beginning to deal with the Gentiles as it Blended one into the other watch he said he said I want you to notice that the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them they got hotti in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man he said the Gentile age was issued in with that it would go out in the same way boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and do the things we've been taught was contrary to the word of God he said and breth it'll be so slick and sigh until it would deceive the very elect if possible he said so you better purpose in your heart tonight and be filled with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong thing when the proclamation is issued was like well I I would be able to tell well if you missed the Rapture you might not be able to tell best to go on when the Rapture comes right but we see that and I think we can all see that it's not what I'm preaching on this morning we see that creeping into the message even if the devil can't defeat the message and he can't he tries to creep into it yeah and and caused people to become idolators now Daniel 3:1 let's go there Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits the bread throw six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of Babylon now notice it was a was an image of Daniel it made like look like Daniel then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs all the church officers all the Great Men all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up now the three Hebrew children were invited now it's interesting that they went they went but they were not coming to a worship they were coming to a dedication right and the dedication was to a prophet so they said come to the meeting we're going to dedicate this image to the to God to the prophet of God and the three Hebrew children were invited to it and they came to it with all the rest now Daniel 3:4 he said then a Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded oh people Nations and languages that what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sack butt sultry doer and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up I want to stop there for just a moment because I've heard it said that well it was the music that was wrong if they hadn't had music it would have never brought them to worship of of a wrong thing but music is always associated with worship true and false right it's always associated with worship so you're going to have music either way we might as well have that music that brings true worship and brother you know the music might have been the same stuff that Shadrach Meshach and abedo played down at their church right it might have been it might have been uh it might have been an old Henson song could have been and and I like the Henson y'all don't even know who the Henson are some of you but but uh it might have been an old hon it might have been call me gone you know or something like that and it's an old old song Maybe and all the musical instruments got together and they played it and oh it's anointed and oh it's wonderful but you always watch where the worships going to right right it's not in the music necessarily although music can be bad right and we don't want it to be bad we want to keep rock and roll out of the church but but not your definition of what that is but but I think I I think that's why God gives us pastors and men and and music lead people worship leaders people that can that can watch that and and do that but and yet uh you know we want to be able to worship freely we don't want to get all bound up and and get to the point where we can't do nothing because we're scared of offending God you're not going to offend him by worshiping loudly or he'd be offended in on the throne in heaven right David said wor pray play he said skillfully with a loud noise the key there is skillfully right yes sir now so it might have been the same stuff they were worshiping something different now brother BR says shame on you people that don't believe in music all right that's what brings the spirit of the Lord sometimes God doesn't change he said if he liked it then he likes it now now they had the music they had Daniel's image but no Daniel yeah watch Daniel wasn't there they didn't consult Daniel cuz he have said no you're not doing that right they didn't consult Daniel they had a form of godliness but within their worship was idolatry and the true seed of God would never stand for that right so in Daniel 3:6 it said who so falleth not down and worship us so that they get to the meeting and the guy gets up and reads it and says this is the way we're going to have church who so fth not down and worship it shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore now watch anytime you're you're forced to a worship it's not of God yeah right if God wanted people that were forced to worship him he' just stayed with angels right he wouldn't have messed with us he wouldn't even bother with humans at all he wanted the people who would worship him because they love him right because they care about him yeah so any anytime you're forced to worship it's a it's a Catholic it's a it's a it's a Babylonian thing started in the Babylon in Babylon it goes into the second Babylon which is the Roman Catholic church and and Rome and so it becomes a it becomes a a Babylonian worship now so they were they were forced to it now they said as soon as you hear all these things that you worship and if you don't you're going to be thrown in the midst of a burning fiery furnace so verse 7 as soon as they heard the sound all the people fell down listen all them other thousands of Jews fell down yeah yeah think about it for a minute all the ones that had been invited all the ones that were there all the king's Sons but there was somebody who didn't all right oh that God would put something the fall within our hearts that when everybody else falls down we won't if everybody you say well nobody in my home believes the message nobody in my home wants to go to church you be the one I don't care if you're young I don't care if you're whatever it is you be the one find a way to get in the house of God yeah nobody else wants to do it you you don't fall down to it everybody else says well you know you can choose what gender you are you can uh you you can and that's just an easy thing but you know to know that it's wrong but there's many other things that we have today you can do whatever you want we will not bow to your image right of leoa We Will Not Bow to Babylon Babylonian worship we will not bow to just an easy believism you can do whatever you want just come to church and live like that no no we we we believe our God is a god of Holiness and a god of a god of Honor yeah now look wherefore at that time certain calans came near and accused the Jews they always will now here's something else we can look at any anytime the the bride is never an accuser right the bride is Accused never an accuser if you if you become if you take on yourself an accusatory Spirit you actually become take Satan's job right he's the accuser of the Brethren that's his tipe it's a title given to him in the scripture the accuser of the Brethren I don't want the devil's job I don't want to be the accuser we let the devil do that but there will always be an accuser as long as we're going through the test and they told the king there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon and these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou set up and then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach me meach and Abednego and they brought these men before the king and Nebuchadnezzar spake unto them and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach mesach and abedo do not you serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if you be ready at what time you hear all these instruments you fall down and worship the image which I made well but if you worship not you should be cast the same hour in the midst of a burning fiery furnace now look at the challenge he said and who is that God that will deliver you out of my hand and Shadrach Meshach and abedo answered and said to the king we are not careful hallelujah oh I love that this that's the way we ought to be about the word of God but every part of it we don't have to be careful about acknowledging the word of God is true we don't have to be careful about not bowing to the images that he set up listen we're not careful to answer the in this matter if it be so our God whom we serve is able do you believe he is this morning he's able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace he will deliver us out of thine hand oh King but if not be known unto thee Oh King we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up yeah now brother brandham takes that and he says the Hebrew children didn't have a promise of being delivered from the fire yeah right he said they didn't have any promise they couldn't go back here and read in the Bible and say Lord you promised in your word that any of your children ever went into a fiery furnace you would deliver them all right Lord we're coming right there upon on that see they couldn't do that said well that wouldn't have been so hard to do just their faith because God had already promised it but God hadn't promised them no such a thing but here is the words they had God was so real to them yeah oh that God would be so real in our homes he'd be so real here in the church and he'd be so real to us as individuals that we could say even if we don't have a specific promise He's Able he's able to do it our God is abble now he said he said God hadn't promised them no such a thing he said but here's the words they had our God is abble how about that he said the fellow that don't believe in Divine Healing God is able to deliver us come these fiery furnace but will not bow down to your images sir and when they walked into the fiery furnace listen upon bare sheer Faith glory to God they didn't have the message like you do they didn't have a good church to go to they didn't have any of the stuff like we have today but upon bare sheer Faith they walked into the fiery furnace oh my that God was able not promised but he was able God sent Christ in the fiery furnace and fann the fire away from them and protected them and brought them out sure he said but I'm saying God is able God Amen God is able he said now he said you don't come saying that oh listen now when you're coming for healing he said you don't come saying God is able you don't have to come that God you promised hallelujah oh you're not coming saying God you're able to heal my cancer God you're able to heal cancer you're able to hear heal diabetes you're able to you're able to raise the dead you're able to bring my children back from from the life of sin you're able Lord to keep my children in the house of God you're able you don't have to say you're able you can say God you promised Hallelujah I've told you before I can't even fathom my children children being out of the out of the house of God out of the Ark I can't fathom any of these young people I want to see them make it all the way and we're going to do everything we can to help them but I'll say this if they do go out I'll say I have a promise I'm not just resting on the fact that he's able though I believe he is able but I'm not just resting on that fact I have a promise sister L You' got a promise of your children I got a promise of my children and God is able and how many times have we seen him do exceedingly and abundantly but we have a promise today yes sir thy and thy house will be saved that's a promise Hallelujah you wonder why I know sometimes kids wonder why am I back in church what am I doing I I don't even I'm not even doing maybe all that I should do yet but I just here I am I'm being drawn back to the house of God it's that promise pulling you back it's that word pulling you back you you aren't able to you might as well give into it because it's going to happen anyway why because God promised it yeah right there's never been a promise of God fall to the ground right sir yes sir Hallelujah that'll give us courage today God you promised Hallelujah the day we don't have to come and and say well God you're able we said God you promised you prepared it at Calvary and I've come to receive it and you promised it and I see others receiving it so I come too Lord to get my part of it he said you'll go away a different person you'll go away with such an anchor inside your soul that nothing can upset you he said you know that you're healed you know that God has taken care of this matter for you because he promised do you believe it today church has he promised it he promised in his word we could have our healing we could have our Salvation we could have our children look promise then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury they said God God's able all that did make the devil mad sometimes when you claim the promises of God all it does make the devil mad but it's still going to come to pass matter how mad he gets don't you don't you just love that no matter how mad the devil gets it ain't going to stop God it don't bother God at all when the devil throws a fit cuz he does it all the time anyway that's like that little kid you know maybe yeah I shouldn't even go here like that little kid that's always throwing fits you know they throw a fit at Walmart they throw a fit at the at the grocery store they throw a fit down at the restaurant they're always throwing a fit you expect that from them that's the way the devil is to God he's just always throwing a fit and getting mad God's not worried by it at all he's not running around oh what are we going to do now the devil's mad he's always been mad yeah he was created for that purpose but you were put you were created to put your foot on top of the devil yeah right Hallelujah now but he said you know what I'm going to do he said I'm going to I'm going to heat it up seven times hotter seven Church ages he heated it hotter now here's what I believe and you can you can if this is seed spit it out this is just what I believe about it I believe it was compounded you ever heard of compound interest seven times hotter you know so it's a for in the first age it was so hot in the second age it was that hot plus all that was in the first age plus the second age and then all that was in the first two ages plus right the third age and so it just keeps getting more and more and more and more seven times seven times they heated it up seven times it got to where he was sure that no man could stand that test the devil was confident the King was confident that nobody could survive that fire how could any man do it oh my now look there is a people that can withstand the test yeah we can look out at the age today and we can say how could any man how could any family raise up with the darkness that's all around us how could any married couple make it in the age that we live it How can any church make it in the in with the darkness all around gross Darkness covering the land how can anybody make it but there will be a people that make it why why did they make it they were the elect of God they were the seed right oh church we just recognize who you are today you're the seed of God you belong to God they were God's children and the promise was your seed will possess the Gate of his enemy and that's our promise today we're the spiritual Seed of Abraham and he said thy seed will possess the Gate of his enemy that's the promise they had that they were just a seed you may not have a specific promise that you can find for the situation you're dealing with right now but you do have this promise I'm a seed of God and thy seed will possess the Gate of his enemy that means if there's something stopping me from moving forward I'm going to take that gate and I'm going to be able to take that problem and I'm going to be able to defeat that enemy not not 99 times out of 100 but 100 times out of a 100 thy seed will now he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army now look Babylonian Army had just defeated Jerusalem they were the best army in the world so he calls the best of the best today maybe that would be the Navy SEALS or the Army Rangers he said I don't want just a bunch of prison guards to do this I want the very best men that I've got I want you to make sure that they don't escape he commanded the most Mighty Men in his army to bind Shadrach mhach and Abednego and to cast him into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats their hes in their hats so they still had their clothes all their clothes on and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach mhach and Abednego and these three men Shadrach mhach and abedo fell down bound into the midst of the burning fire fiery furnace now last week I preached about how the the age is standing on slippery ground and and they're going one step from tribulation and we're one step from the Rapture yeah all right right Wonder they're one step from tribulation and I begin to while I was studying on that I begin to research what brother BR said about one step whenever he talks about one step he he refers to the three Hebrew children most of the times he talks about that he refers to the three Hebrew children and how they were one step from the fire one step and it's that last step many times it's hardest to take because you know you know when you got six or seven steps in front of you as you're going up the ramp towards the fire and and the heat you can feel it it was intense but you get closer and closer and closer you realize after a while you can't breathe you you begin to perspire your is so hot it feels like it's going to burn off melt off of you because you're getting that much closer to the fire and it's that last step that's so hard to still have any faith because the fire is so real at that moment and brother BR said I can hear Shadrach say to me are you sure you prayed through think about it for a minute I know this is simple this morning but just just think with me for a minute I'll go with you man buddy yeah you got the Revelation man tell you what we're we're brothers we'll go together one step two steps three steps five steps six steps last step man you sure are you sure this morning cuz the world's One Step from hell right you might as well have something you believe in right you might as well believe the message of the hour yes that if you prayed through said sometimes when Satan puts the heat on we have to stop and check up yeah Lord do I truly believe you yes I can hear Shadrach say yes it's all prayed up now that's easy to go along with the church and and go as long as things are going good it's easy to go along with a pastor as long as pastor's preaching what you like and and the the associats preaching what you like the other ministers are all the deacons are all treating you right it's easy but when you get one step from the fire what what happens then when Satan really puts the heat on I wonder sometimes and maybe we ought to check up Lord is our pastor okay pastor are you sure this is right and I hope he always gives me the confidence to say I believe he will we're we're just that much closer to Freedom we're just that much closer to Victory it might be getting hot right now it might it might seem like your family's falling to pieces it might seem like things aren't going well but we're just that much closer yeah yeah God help us today the guard says you want to take that back boy nope we're willing to seal Our Testimony with our own life oh my we're ready now I can hear King Nebuchadnezzar say now now if you'll bow down to the image I'll take it back oh we've took our way with the Lord's despise few I'm going through with it the time was for decisions just a few minutes left think about it this morning just a few if I could just make it real to us just a few minutes left there's just a few minutes left in the service this morning just a few more minutes now think about it you just got a few minutes to make a decision you're either going to be better or worse yeah when you leave right you just got a few minutes left brother B said many of you sitting here tonight in that same condition heart trouble Bound in these chairs on these crutches and things just a few minutes left in this meeting make your decision the time has come for you to do it he said either you've got to believe what I've said to be the truth hope this is striking what I've said to be the truth and what God has wrote in his Bible or walk away in the same condition but the time has come amen I think it's time to quit playing Church brother Stuart preached on not long ago it's in an hour to play Church the time has come you got to make a decision only a few minutes left in the meeting can I say it this way in God's time maybe only a few minutes left yes yes maybe a few seconds left in God's time for this earth goes up time has come for you to do it I can hear him say all right walk them on up heat began to get a little bad yeah don't worry he saidif you accept him tonight as your healer come on Satan will put the heat on you tomorrow some of our young people testified testified that they were filled with the Holy Ghost testified they were healed testified they had a good time at the meeting they're about to they're going to testify and they've testified to us and and told us about these wonderful things you come through a meeting like that what happens Satan puts the heat on yeah he gonna make you try to doubt what you got he's going to try to tell you it was just emotion you just got stirred up was nothing to it but there's something about a Shadrach mesach and have been to go they said we're going to go all the way we're going to make the final step we don't care about the heat we don't care if it feels hotter than it ever felt before we believe our God is able and today we believe our God gave a promise he said they started walking a little farther I can hear him say are you sure you're prayed up yep all right all right got right up to the steps to about one step so they begin to feel fainty know if that's a word but it's pretty descriptive begin to feel fainty like they was going in look brother Brandon said God doesn't ever do anything on Earth without also doing something in heaven right so as this was going on something was going on in heaven too right so brother BR said turn the camera towards heaven Oh my he said there's always two sides to it you know when Satan's on the job Jesus is also ever who you yield your faith to that's the way it's going give it to Christ he said let's look up this way you know he said I can see him sitting up there in his majesty I can see him sitting up there in his majesty his Priestly robes draped around him looking down and as he looks he sits patiently and waits one step two steps all the way up maybe it took them seven steps let's say to get to the top of the ramp or the stairs they get all the way up and the fire's so close that it actually kills the guards that took them up the Navy Seals that had a hold of them yeah let me ask you a question this morning how have you survived when Great Men didn't survive how have you made it yeah when the ones who told you you wouldn't make it all right aren't here anymore come on now how have you made it it's because you're made of the kind of stuff that doesn't burn easily it's not very flammable oh my oh Church you just recognize what that seed means to you what that something on the inside of the inside means to you you get right up close to the fire and they died and but the children you know they might have been gasping for breath heat you've ever been real close to a fire they might have been just just barely able to make it but they made it you say well brother Ben I'm hurting this morning but you're here yeah all right I'm not feeling good maybe some of you sitting at home watching or you're going maybe things have gone bad for you but you can say well I brother Ben I I don't understand but you're still with it you're still believing the message you're still you're still serving God yeah why because you're made of stronger stuff than the Mighty Men You're Made Of stronger stuff than those with a great name or something like that you're made of something that don't burn good watch here in heaven the Angels get concerned brother brandom said you've all you probably heard brother brandom give this drama doesn't many times he says said Gabriel comes up to him and says said Lord I'm your Mighty angel Gabriel I'm the one who BR brings the good news brought the good news of you come into the Earth I'm your Mighty Angel he said look he said here they are he said can I go down and and deliver them will you send me down no not yet wait just a minute he said wormwood come up wormwood's the one who controls the the the atmospheres the rivers and the water and he said he come up and he said he said he said Lord he said here they are are in the about to step in or just one step away you've watched them all this time lord isn't it time why don't you send me down I'll take care of it I'll just flood it with water I'll put out that fiery furnace God said just just hang on a minute see the job that he was going to do in when it was seven times hter he wanted to do himself Oh my he wanted to do it himself he didn't oh he didn't just send a prophet he did send a prophet but that's not all he sent he didn't just send an angel he did send an angel but he came down himself in the form of the son of man he come down himself in this age to live in me and you he said I'm not going to send you Gabriel I'm not going to send you wormwood I'm going to go down myself and be the fourth man in the fire oh don't you believe he's with you this morning he's the same yesterday today and forever he said in this age when it gets so hot and they're one step away from the fire I'm going going down to deliver them hallelujah oh I don't know what that makes if you understand this message at all you understand what the son of man Ministry is and how it come down in this age don't you that don't make you want to worship a man it makes you want to worship God who's the fourth man in the fire is with us that's good Gabriel and wormwood they said have you considered them said yes all night long I've been watching them brother his eyes on the sparrow I know he's he watches me he's watching you he's seeing how much Faith to got watch what he says how much you got how much you got Waits Through the Ages through the times through your sickness through your life much Faith you got how much you got what are you going to do want to see what kind of a stand that you'll take but God if if I was supposed to be here why don't I have the things that I wanted you want to see what kind of a stand you'll take watching you Waits how much you got how much Faith you got how much Faith you got he said that hour has come now what are you going to do look he said I've watched them all night long I heard every prayer they prayed the Bible tells us that our prayers are in a Golden Bowl it it's a symbol of something God keeps them not one is thrown away he keeps them yeah I'm so grateful for that today every prayer that you ever prayed he may not have answered right away he may not have healed you right away he may not have saved your children right away but he keeps them in the Golden Bowl and it's incense to him yeah he loves to smell of he loves the the way it sounds to his ears the prayers of the Saints yeah he's seen look how much Faith you got he said I've watched them he said I've heard every prayer they prayed you a angels has been good Angels but I can't let you go I'm going myself I can see him rise from his seat the Priestly robes drop around him I can see him say come here East Wind West Wind North and South everything obeys him I can hear him say get over here that big white Thunderhead out yonder where it's at I can see him roll up on his throne step over on there oh my reach up and get a hold of a zigzag lightning pass by the tree of life and pick off a palm what a description he said what's the matter I'm going to Babylon this morning my children has took a stand I'm taking a stand too I believe that's the hour we're living in today church it's not just us taking a stand it's not just you trying to live right and do right he's taking a stand this is the hour that we live in today he's taking a stand while they were taking their last step to the fire he was taking his first step from the throne yes oh Church why you were taking your last step seemed like it had just about got you he was taking a step Hallelujah no matter what amount of time you've got left that's all he needs to get to you yes wonderful Hallelujah brother BR said they're just about one step now to go down into the fiery furnace isn't it strange God let you come right to the last step of the road seems like he doesn't care he just said that he is watching you Hallelujah brother BR said I can see the man with the spear the intense heat was just about to get them they was about to suffocate Shadrach meach and abedo kind of fainty like walking on up hands tied behind them you see them walking there they're just about to fall over from the heat but they keep going forward they keep moving brother Bill they just can't hardly seem to make it the heat is just right there one more step and they'll be falling in look he said The only person that gets in a hurry is you and I Hallelujah he said God takes his time as long as he's promised it that's good enough he said I can see them right up there almost ready to step into the fiery furnace and it looks pretty bad for believers there looks pretty bad for believers there I'm sure the other thousands of the Jews said boy we're glad we didn't do what they did and we're glad we just settled into Leo to see it become good Babylonians we're glad we didn't take the stand they did because now they're going through a trial but what they were actually going to have going through was a trial that led to a Deliverance without the trial there would have been no reason for the story that's right oh Hallelujah there would have been no testimony without the test yeah now look he said I can see them up there almost ready to step in look pretty bad for believers the Old King said well we'll stop them holy rollers around here now we got the situation controlled you know why just forgive me for a minute you know why some preachers don't like the move of the holy spirit in the church because they can't control it come on Old Nebuchadnezzar thought had his church pretty controlled yeah you're going to get rid of the Holy Rollers everything going to be all right after that oh God there's something about them holy rollers are hard to get rid of yeah all right he said the situation control now as soon as they hit that fiery furnace the rest of the guys will see that they'll know I'm boss around here but brother there's another boss sets up yonder in heaven oh aren't you glad there's another boss this morning that the boss of this world the God of this evil age is not the boss of you and me as kids would say you're not the boss of me we can say that to the devil this morning yeah amen that's good hallelujah look look he said it was the amen it was the Hebrew children had been faithful to the promise of God was laying there in the fiery furnace in Babylon going to the fiery furnace One Step between them and death he said how much that may be to men here tonight there may be one day between you and eternal separation you make your decision now the way is provided for you if you'll accept it he said there's only one step between you and death all of us live there right none of us are guaranteed another minute there's only one step between you and death oh God make the right decision this morning before you go into the fire make sure he's Lord of your life your one step he said you remember your one step he talked about David and Saul how David told Jonathan he said there's only one step between me and Saul One Step between me and death every step I take Saul's trying to kill me just one step between me and death he said there was one step between them and death but just at that crucial moment God provided a way of escape and he sent into that fiery furnace the Lord Jesus Christ and kept the fire off of them Hallelujah is it now we see them going up just this one step from going into the fiery furnace look like that they were completely defeated Oh my he said I've seen cancer cases come to almost their last breath yes amen oh some of you can testify this morning I can see cancer cases come to almost their last breath a brother he said laying with arthritis recently had his hands laying like this the Holy Spirit told him thus sayith the Lord you're healed he said he went home and got worse he said I can't help it that man didn't know me he never seen me in his life he lived in Phoenix he said never seen me in his life how could he tell me who I was he talked about how he got so bad that his wife would just move the the the blanket on him and it he would cry out in pain because the arthritis was so bad and it's it it'd be a horrible way to die to have that so bad that it was actually killing him he said he just kept getting worse and kept getting worse his wife said why do you keep hanging on that you're bringing shame on us he said but he didn't know who I was oh he was holding on to that that God that God somehow knew him and if God knew him God would heal him amen that same thing's true today the god that knows you will heal you he got so bad he said he laid back his little girl was trying to put a wet rag on his face he felt fainty there's that word again he looked up there and he said he seen Christ come before him on the cross and he said when he bowed his head to die he thought his breath was going he couldn't breathe no more the arthritis was all through him and when he bowed his head to die he seen Christ bow his head there all of a sudden he gave a big leap and out of the chair and around and around around the place he went Hallelujah he said the Hebrew children was at that place sometimes we think it's real dark but remember it's in the darkest of of hours when Jesus comes by amen hallelujah hallelujah God's already provided a way I've told you before I needed a new job one time I wasn't making enough to provide for my family and I was faithful to church and to do my duties as a minister and I was working and I needed another job I was praying and crying out to God and I got a little bit contener about it upset but why do I not have a job here I've been praying doing everything's right and I went one day I was about to delete all my all my spam messages in my email and something told me check them first I went through there I started checking them I had a job offer in there been in there for about a month had a job offer for the job that I wanted a job in another town that become a long-term job for me that really helped me a place where there was less stress and paid more money and it was there all the time it was there the offer was already there while I was stressing about it oh church if you just realize God's already got an answer he's already got an answer you might be stressed out this morning but he's already got an answer good and Nebuchadnezzar the king you know he's he's watching because he's waiting for them to burn up because it killed them men and he throws them down bound he puts his glasses on you know I want to see this looks laughs them off he got sweat on them that's what I'm doing man WIP some off who is that well there's Harold there's brother westes there's brother Joe oh they're all there they are aren't they dead yet te again and my glasses are back come here come here he called somebody over he said come here didn't we didn't we throw three men into the fire bound didn't we tie their hands thr them in the fire he said well then why do I see four and they're not bound anymore they're walking around worshiping God in the middle of the fire glory to God they have no hurt no hurt they didn't even smell like smoke yeah they have no oh God they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God yes Oh my he it just enough fire hit them now listen just enough fire hit them to burn their latches off their hands and feet all right and then when he hit the bottom of the pit he was there Hallelujah he was there they felt they felt it but it did not bother them they they almost fainted but it did not oh God did not burn them they felt like they were going to die but they didn't die that's good i' been a lot easier if God had just warned them ahead of time and said here's what I want to do a lot easier wouldn't it he told you now you're going to get leukemia but I'm going to see you through and at the end after a certain number of days you're going to he didn't do that did he he let you be scared for a while what was he doing testing your faith just testing your faith yeah now look they thought there were one step from the fire that would destroy them and they were actually one step from Freedom all right see they were bound going into the fire and had they oh God had they turned around had they had they stopped at that last step and turn around and said oh King we we'll do whatever you want we'll bowle your image don't throw us in that fire if they had done done that they would have always been bound the king they might have wore nice clothes they might have had nice houses but they would have always been bound whatever the king said they for them to do they would always be bound because they said well he could throw us in the fiery furnace again they would always be bound but when they went in they realized that suddenly they became free yes oh Church you're not one step from the fire you're one step from Freedom the world is one step from the fire they're one One Step from a tribulation period but you're one step from oh God from having the B the bonds of this flesh burn off of you and you're going to walk with God and have a new body yes he'll be there for you brother Bron when they were tested whether they would worship images and break the word of God they stayed true to the word yeah oh my they stayed true to the word regardless of the circumstances they stayed true to the word and when they throw them into the fiery furnace God's promise was fulfilled they possessed the gates of their enemy and there was a fourth man standing in there I love this with a key that unlocked the heat from the fire Hallelujah and it could not do nothing but set them free they felt the heat but the only thing the fire could hurt was the bonds on their hands good Hallelujah Wonder oh my some of you might be getting down to the end of your life some of our elders they get discouraged sometimes and get down you know you have more years behind you than ahead of you at least you get down to that place and you think well just one step one day one heartbeat one breath you're not just one breath from death death is only a tool that God uses pull you into the presence of God there's a Fourth Man fire you believe it this morning amen musicians

they're standing here today and believing Lord that you're in the fire lord and maybe they they brought it on themselves but yet you're still there and sometimes lord it's something that happens to us and we didn't bring it on ourselves just genetics it's just just what happened in life it's it's just the way that maybe God allowed it just so Satan could test us but Lord Lord we're believing you too you would not allow it to happen if it wasn't for our good Lord we believe you're with us today you're with the sword in our stupid mistakes you're with the sword even when we're like the three Hebrew children and we stand for you you're with us in that moment oh God I pray you'd help us to stand I pray you'd help the young people to stand Lord the the elders Lord to stand may they not live
