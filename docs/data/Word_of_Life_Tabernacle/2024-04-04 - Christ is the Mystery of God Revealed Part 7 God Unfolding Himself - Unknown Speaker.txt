========================================

go back just like all them other spies did it went over to look at at Canaan they come over there and said oh we look like gr harpper side them we can't take them the amalekites all these what they're going to do and they went back and Caleb and Joshua being th breads amen by the word of God no God said I give you that man they said we're more than able to take it depends on where you're born from if you're born to the word of God God's word has a prence is in his church that's what he died for that's his purpose that he might be able to achieve to have his prous working in his church let the word of God shine forth first no matter what anything else looks like I don't care if the intellectual says this that has nothing to do with it God's word said so and we're more than able to take it if I preach that my church and Minister told me said I'd be preaching to four post in the church I said I'd preach that God's word said so we can do it God said do it amen amen oh yeah they excuse themselves for this that's why they're blind to the message of the end time this last days when God is proving himself they try to class it as some kind of a spiritist or some uh uh oh what would I call it some mental illusion or something on that order see they they try to make it something that it isn't just like they did when he was here when Jesus was here they called him be ELO a fortune teller now they say it's kind of like a mental telepathy thing when they know that he can stand there and look upon the people and discern the very thoughts of in their heart the Bible said so well does not Hebrews the 4th chapter says the word of God is quicker and sharper than a two- AG Sword and conern the Very thoughts of the mind and he was that word and when that word is prence in the man the same thing takes place again or it is the word amen see how you can stumble over this from they're so perfectly plain see all right that's why they're blind same as it was in the days chrisis on earth oh my they stagger the same way they said he's bills they seen he could do it so they said he's just a he was born to the legitimate child kind of odd fell he just got possessed by some devil he he's a Samaritan over there and he's got a Devil in him that's how he does that Jesus said I'll forgive you for that see calling the word of God the works of God an evil spirit he said I forgive you for that but someday the Holy Ghost will come one word against it will never be forgiven neither in this world or the world that is to come or that great day it will not be forgiven so you see that's written plain in the scripture so when people come to that day no matter how intellectual how biger denomination they belong to it's condemned they have to be they blasphemed the Holy Ghost calling it Holy Roller and something that had an un tasty name or something like that and God's church had to Bear it all the time even Paul before gria said in the way that's called heresy which means crazy that's the way I worship the god that great intellectual scholar had to come to that place in a way that's called heresy why it was revealed to him that Pillar of Fire hanging before him said I'm Jesus the great God that was in the wilderness sh with Moses I am he it is hard for you to kick against the when Paul stand know that the life was laying at stake he said the way it is called heresy that's the way I worship the god of our father it was called that because it was revealed to him what the great truth of Christ was and today people say it's a denomination it's Jesus Christ the new birth revealed in you and he has the premes that he might Express his words and anything that he's promised in this last days he can bring it to pass to his body as he's working amen it's just exactly the word of God made manifest notice all right same as in the days of Christ god holds the key to this revelation of Christ himself you believe that schools of theology can never find it Jesus said so if you want to read it now in St Matthew 11:25 and 27 I think the old father God Of Heaven that thou hid this from the eyes of wise and prudent reveal it to Bab such as would learn see see I don't care look at them Scholars of that day those Jews very fine man they're organizations of Pharisees Sadducees and herodians and whatever they might be see all the great organizations and Jesus said you're a blind you lead the blind well did Isaiah speak of you you have ears and can't hear and eyes that you can't see because Isaiah said this in the spirit therefore the god of Heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve did accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the spirit of God therefore won't they all fall in the ditch both the leader and the blind too the leader will fall with the blind because he's blind also the leader fall as blind leading the blind they both fall in the ditch and God Alone holds this key he expressed the same thing in a previous scriptures a while ago when I read it when he said who does man say I the son of man am and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon son of Jonas Flesh and Blood never revealed this to you My Father which is in heaven upon this Revelation here alone I'll build my church The Gates of Hell will never Prevail against it see now you see so therefore there's no school no theologians no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it it's impossible for them to know anything about it God has hid the senses of noia from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ has revealed to them and if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life as in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong Revelation if I put a life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would bear pumpkins by their fruits you shall know them exactly right if the the first you put out a tree a grape vine and it put out a bunch of grapes the first shoot it put out brought grapes the next brought out lemons the next it brought out pears the next brought out apples there's some kind of a grafted aair in there it's bearing its own life every denomination will bear life of itself but if that original vine ever puts out another uh uh Shute it'll bear grapes like it did the first time and if the life the life of Jesus Christ ever puts out another body of Believers it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of Acts behind it because it'll be the same same life praise God see what I mean you just can't get away from it it's the Life of Christ in you been injected In You by the Holy Spirit itself living its life through you blind leaders of the blind notice god holds this key alone no Theologian can tell you it's not known it's hid from them they know nothing about it so the schools when you say I got a pH lld D you only make you to me I believe to God and to any real True Believer that means you're just that much farther away you're just back on God is not knowing about education he's not knowing about how to explain it God is KNN about simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other Roman Rock no other Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ to the New Birth he borns there and he injects his own life and your life is gone and the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the pinces to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of us not even call to it all Watch God's Great Revelation unfolding by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much uh division Among Us is because the people lack that revelation [Music] he never

aren't you glad he's God Amen we ought to worship him because he's God Hebrews 1:1 let's go there tonight and we'll go back into our uh study on Christ is the mystery of God revealed Hebrews 1 and one we'll read down through verse four remember brother Daryl Ward will be at Christian Tabernacle Saturday night at 7 if you want to go to that we'll have our services here on Sunday regular Services as well Hebrews 1:1 God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things someone say all things by the word of his power oh I love that upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he ha by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they amen aren't you glad that he did Hallelujah he's so much better than the angel let's just stop there pray the Lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated got a lot on my mind tonight and and you just bear with me I'll try not to feed all of the hay to to those sheep that have showed up but we sure appreciate you being here tonight all of the Old Testament prophets were God unfolding himself revealing himself partially until he could be fully expressed in Christ so it it's very simple God unfolded himself a little bit like if I would take a handkerchief and and it's folded and you can't see what is on it if this was a picture you couldn't see the whole picture but it's folded up and God was folded in himself so he unfolds himself he declares himself through the prophets and as he's doing that he he uh he unfolds himself a little bit maybe through through Adam and and through Jacob and through Abraham and through the prophets he unfolds himself a little bit you can see so much of him he unfolds himself a little more in Moses you can see a little bit more of him and after a while he unfolds himself maybe in Elijah and the other prophets you can see a a little bit more of him but he does not unfold himself fully in any prophit but he unfolds himself fully in Christ right so you see the whole picture of redemption in Christ aren't you glad for that today so that's what brother BR means by God unfolding himself it's the simplest way I know to put it he unfolds himself he he actually declares and shows more and more of himself I think of in the Song of Solomon it talks about uh how that the uh the one would be standing there that uh Solomon would be standing there showing himself the king declaring himself to his bride and trying to get to where she could see him and and it was time it was Springtime Springtime is time for weddings and it's a time for love and and during the springtime the the bride Was preparing herself and getting herself ready and here he was trying to show himself the Bible say my beloved is like a row or a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he lookth for at the windows showing himself through the lattice but when Christ came he was fully shown to us of what God really was we see glimpses of him like like through a lattice like through a window we saw glimpses of him in the prophets we see glimpses of him in uh even in the the the women of the Bible even in uh even in the uh even in all the Old Testament brother Brandon said in every scripture we see glimpses of Christ but now we see the fullness of Christ and we know then that he would also unfold himself in this age and reveal himself in this age that down through denominational history he would show so much of his word so much of his word but finally in this age we now have the unfolding of God the fullness of God we're able to see who he really is so he reveals himself fully through the word now brother brandom says notice now down Through the Ages he has been gradually letting this out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the types so now brother Brand's going to deal with three of those prophets in the Old Testament he's going to deal with mosus Joseph and David we know that Jesus is a prophet he's a priest and he's a king how many know that tonight he's a prophet priest and King and so brother bram's going to use example of Moses the lawgiver Joseph the intercessor David the king he's going to show us Prophet priest and King in the unfolding in the Old Testament so first of all he goes to Moses he said he expressed himself in Moses look at Moses born in the time of persecution of the children he was born to be a deliverer he was hid in the bull rushes just like Jesus was taken down into Egypt Jesus went up to the mountain he said his first sermon sermon on the the mount come back down with the commandments so just like Moses goes up in the mountain comes back down with the Commandments but they're a little different aren't they and I want to look at that tonight for just a moment they're a little bit different and he said you heard them say them of Old Times thou shal not commit adultery I say to you whoever looks upon a woman lust after her hath committed adultery he said he's lawgiver priest king leader amen just exactly so let's let's do that tonight just for a little bit of Bible study we could Matthew 5 and verse 17 we'll compare with that with Exodus 20 I won't go through all of these but just a couple to show you what he's talking about tonight so we we see the partial in the partial unfolding we find that he he says certain things but in the fullness he says other things he he he he expresses himself more fully what his thought was he doesn't change it but he fulfills it Matthew 5:17 think not that I'm come to destroy the law or the prophets I'm not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one tit that's one uh punctuation right that's like an apostrophe or or a period not or a common not one jot or one tit shall in no wise pass from the law till all someone say all all be fulfilled he said said verse 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven so now he's teaching them that we don't do away with the law it don't mean there are no rules Grace doesn't mean there's no rules but what does he do he come to fulfill the law to manifest the law right not just to be a ceremony or or deadly letter but to be alive so he says now he said I say unto you except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees you shall in no wise in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven now if you go to Exodus 2013 one of the Ten Commandments is Thou shalt not kill right actually in in the original Thou shalt not murder Thou shalt not murder right now Matthew 5:21 says you have heard it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not kill well them of old time was Moses right now and they added a tradition to that and there was some uh and actually in Leviticus Moses even adds some to it but he said thou if thou shallal not kill whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment verse 22 but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother Without a Cause huh just because he woke up in a bad mood say right whosoever shall say to his brother it shall be in danger of the Judgment but whosoever whosoever shall say to his brother rqa shall it be in danger of the counsel but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of Hellfire that's pretty harsh isn't it then what Jesus I thought you had more grace he does he does have more grace he gives us the ability he gives he put the spirit in us because nobody can live the law because you might have got angry with your brother or more likely your wife or your husband today right you might have said something you shouldn't have said today but he's ever interceding for us he's not just a prophet he's also a priest and he's also a king amen we need to remember that now he said therefore thou bring thy gift to The Altar and they rememb thy brother hath ought against thee see how he's he's he's making the picture larger where we can see what he meant by Thou shalt not kill now we never got all that out of Thou shalt not kill but Jesus the word said it's more than just taking a knife and stabbing somebody but it's actually how you treat one another right so he said leave there thy gift before the altar go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift verse 25 agree with thine adversary quickly while thou are in the way with him lest at any time the adversary delivered thee to the judge and the judge delivered thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison verely I say unto thee Thou shalt by no means come out then till th pay the uttermost Farthing now he's going to deal with another one Exodus 2014 says Thou shalt not commit adultery that's pretty straightforward isn't it Thou shalt not commit adultery Matthew 5:27 youve heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not Comm adultery but I say unto you whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after her ha committed adultery with her already in his heart and if and now again that's pretty strong thank God for the blood but that's why brother brandom tells us the Holy Ghost filled man will turn his head because he doesn't want to he doesn't want to cross that there's something in him wants to do right right but yet you're a human being and so you have to have you have to have an advocate even the best Christian in the world now and now watch what Jesus says he keeps going on further he said If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish not that thy whole body should be cast into hell now he puts it he puts it into a place where adultery begins with a thought right so if we're going to if we're going to take care of the sin let's take care of where it's started at right not just say adultery was wrong but even the thought of it is wrong so now he said If thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish not that thy whole body should be cast into hell now what's he saying do take the extreme measure that you need to take make sure your heart's right before God I say Amen to that today now so again he said it been said it has been said right he's going to take a little bit further on adultery he said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement but I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery the B said that's because she would get married again and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committed committeth adultery there was no restrictions on divorce in the Old Testament in that way but Jesus said there was he come down the mountain and fulfilled the law he come down with Ten Commandments if we can say it that way with the Fulfillment of that with what God had in his mind about the Ten Commandment can I can I go a little bit further I think we understand and we're mature enough to understand what happened in our day was God was revealing himself in his fullness to the church and showing us what these things were to the church and so that's one reason why marriage and divorce had to be preached brother bandam said he talks about in marriage and divorce he goes over all the things that went on and he goes over all the uh all the things the way it was a man can a woman can't and one man and and many one or one deer and many uh many female deer and one Buck many female deer and you look at that and some people look at that and say my it gives me a license to do whatever I want no it doesn't listen to this he said but now that the seals are open the spirit of Truth directs us to the word right that explains why all the mistakes has been made he told us polygamy was a mistake it explains why all the mistakes has been made down Through the Ages because the seals was not opened this was not revealed what's he doing I'm just using this as an illustration preaching on marriage and divorce tonight but it's just so we can understand what God's doing he's unfolding himself and I'll say this you know you I know people say well I feel bad because I've been divorced and and and I've been through that maybe married and divorced married again and divorced and I feel bad well the same Prophet that said that that said teach your children not to do it also said stay as you are God give you forgiveness I'm so glad for that and every one of us need forgiveness now so that was him unfolding himself in Moses he unfolded himself in Joseph Joseph the intercessor in Genesis 41:41 we find that Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have set thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his his ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand raid him in festures of fine linen put a gold chain about his neck he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt look at compare the New Testament John 14:6 Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father by me what is it a direct type of Joseph was a direct type of Christ because no man could come to Pharaoh without Joseph 1 Timothy 2:5 there's one God and one mediator between God and Men the man Christ Jesus he is the only one in between aren't you glad of that tonight aren't you glad there's no one else between you and God it's just it's just you and God because there's one mediator and that's the man Christ Jesus and he's God so it's rigged for you as we said before now look Romans 14:11 it says as I live says the Lord every knees shall bow to me every tongue shall confess to God so what is he doing he we see a direct type of Joseph now brother B said he expressed himself in Joseph born amongst denomination his Brethren he said they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he saw Visions God was with him he could interpret dreams and his brothers hated him he was sold by his breth by almost 30 pieces of silver just like he was sold by Judas the scariot by 30 pieces of silver he was thrown into a ditch and supposed to have been dead that's right the father and them was told he was dead he said that he strowed into this ditch taken up went to the right hand of pharaoh he said in the dungeon how he suffered there there was two saved the Butler and the baker one of them was lost the other was saved and it was their attitudes towards Joseph that really determine the outcome just as on the cross when he was in his prison house attacked to the cross for our sins become a prisoner one Thief was lost and one was saved both of them thieves both of them had done wrong but one got the king's favor and the other one didn't yeah right oh my oh we were just as guilty as the world is do do we understand that tonight church but we got his favor and others didn't why because it was given to us oh aren't you glad for the gift of his favor gift of his grace tonight he said then become cometh the right hand of pharaoh the king that he dreamed had the vision he would set excuse me at the king's feet and all authority in Egypt was given to him as Vision now listen had to come to pass brother Brandon says something here I think it's important CU he said he might have studied of it many times other words he might have sat there and thought I wonder how this could happen while he was in the prison right brother Bill must not have seemed like it could ever happen because he's studying about it he's thinking here I had this Vision I know that the vision is right I know God always showed me the vision was right but how could it ever happen I think we ought to we ought to think about these things tonight how could it ever take place how could we ever see ourselves making it how could we ever make a Rapture it's hard to see when you're in the prison but God's got a way out of the prison and while he was in the prison his whiskers growing out and so forth but he studied it oh it's a good thing to study the promise of God to study the visions of God and see what God did in our day and see what he's going to do amen because the word is still true how many believe that today this message is still going to come to pass he said though it linger it's got to happen he said as I spoke Wednesday night but here at the service see it has to happen when God says so it's got to happen it's a Vindicated prophit and it has to come to pass cuz it's God's word how many believe that tonight if it's God's word it's got to come to pass that's why we can be just as excited brother B say with the 25 cents as we can with the loaf of bread right cuz that 25 cents is is a down payment it's the price it's a purchase of the Lord and we have the price that it takes if you have the token tonight you have the price of going into Rapture you say well I have the Holy Ghost but I don't feel like it all the time he didn't say you would always feel like it but it is the token it is the price that it takes to make it in though it linger it's got to happen because it's God's word and brother B said and the word comes only to the prophet the word Prophet means a revealer of the Divine written word the same as it does a foreteller or Seer and the sear how the one you know is telling forthy is divinely Vindicated by foreseeing and it comes to pass if there be one who is Prophet will speak to you tell you certain things are going to happen if it don't happen he said don't listen to him but if it does happen I'm with him he said you better fear him because I'm with him you see that's exactly he said there is the Vindication there where there where you know where there's the truth or whether it isn't I believe we had a Vindicated prophet in our day and I believe he had something to say have you believe that he had something to say the Bible says that the vision is yet for an appointed time there there's a specific time that God has chosen for your healing there's a specific time an appointed time that God has chosen for the Salvation of your children there's a appointed time that God I don't know if anybody's going to have church with me tonight but I I just feel like having church for a minute there's an appoint OED time that God chose for the vision whatever is spoken over you to come to pass there is God knows the day the hour none of us know but there is an appointed time the vision is yet for an appointed time it will happen at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it wait for it Church listen what does the Bible say they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint what is it they they they're waiting we're waiting on the Lord he said because it was surely come it will not tar other words once its time is right it will not delay any further Hallelujah brother Brandon spoke of a bride that would not fall I just believe it'll happen he spoke of a restored church with signs wonders and miracles I believe there's an appointed time right for that to take place in our lives he said we could apply the token over our families did he say that then though it Terry wait for it it will surely come to pass I tell you what brother Billy saw us in our Heavenly home we we had in the vision God showed him in a vision what it was like over there and he saw he saw us there he saw the ones who were brought up under his ministry and when he saw his brother Herold though it carry wait for it it will come to pass you're not going to be in these old bodies the older I get the more sick I get of this body I want a new one I want one that works right I want one that doesn't hurt I want one that gives me the ability to travel like a thought that's what I was born for amen and I'm part of that Pride that won't fall I'm part of the vision right part of the ones he saw going up and not going down ohow it Terry wait for it it will surely come pass you say brother Ben I'm looking for peace in my home I'm looking for looking for Joy I'm looking for things to happen wait for it if the vision said it you can have it right if the vision said it you can you will have it but you got to wait for it you don't know how long Abraham waited 25 years but finally the promise came Amen brother BR said God is speaking back through his word to his people by by people I love this God is speaking back through his word to his people by people see he said God only speaks through man I am the vine you're the branches the vine doesn't bear fruit he said the branches talk oh I love that people say well we shouldn't be preaching in church well the branches talk the branches bear the fruit of the vine notice he said it's always been that way he wants somebody listen church I we we we want to listen to the message we want uh to listen to tapes it encourages me when I find you've been listening to the prophet that that encourages me when I hear I've watched something over time when somebody really begins to commit their life to the Lord and they begin to get right with God the one of the first things they do is start listening to a prophet I seen it over and over and over again and when people backside one of the first things they do is quit listening to a prophet and you can explain that any way you want to but it's just a fact I've seen it over and over and over and over again so I'm grateful that you listen but he wants somebody who not only listens to it but will speak it God speaking to his people by people amen now brother bandam talk again continuing to talk about Joseph this all in Christ is to mystery he said now we find Joseph then when no man could touch or come to pharaoh without first seeing Joseph no man can come to the father only by the son and when Joseph left the throne they sounded trumpets every knee bowed Joseph is coming forth Glory he said someday every knee will bow every tongue will confess when he leads the Throne of his father to come forth he said everybody will bear witness he is the Son of God he said it's too late then do it now right CU you're going to Bow one day right might as well bow to him now so his first type was Moses the second that he used was was Joseph his third who was an intercessor with his with his family for his brothers he when his brothers come up there he the intercessor between them and Pharaoh was they were in his hands he could have killed them but he didn't do it why because he said this happened to save life I want you to watch that Joseph humbling himself to the vision of God that the the vision of God is greater than what I feel and my desire for Retribution and my desire for Revenge right so that's an important Point as we go on now brother Brandon says now we notice that through the types we could take even David as I spoke of a while ago going off his throne rejected by his own people he he said going up the same Mountain Mount of all is as he's going over to his prison he was going to his prison house because he was rejected of his brother and of his own people he went up weeping he said that was the spirit of Christ in him to be rejected you think well if I had the spirit of Christ I'd i' I'd jump and shout and praise God and worship yes you would that's part of it but you might also be rejected right and weep because he did right he rejected don't don't sell yourself short because many times we don't feel oh church we we don't feel like we're saved and if listen if I was only saved when I felt like I was saved I'd have been saved about one tenth of my life we're not saved because we feel like it we're saved because we know we are according to the word we did what God required and we were called to him and he did a supernatural work we couldn't have done that to ourselves he did that we couldn't have called ourselves we could there's so many stories here in our church that we could say they couldn't have called themselves none of you could he had to do that you came in spite of all this nonsense you came oh God you came in spite of what other people were doing in the message you came in spite of what other people were doing in your family you loved God anyway but you didn't always feel saved I don't always feel saved sometimes you feel like weeping but that may be an expression of Christ in your life 800 years later the son of David stood on Jerusalem up there above Jerusalem and rejected wept over Jerusalem and said now your hour has come he was a rejected King and he still is today oh but I want to be one that stands with him don't you want to be one that stands with him Hallelujah like those like those that that run down into The Well of Bethlehem got him a drink of water I want to be somebody who's willing to get him a drink of Pentecostal water amen I want to be somebody who worships him when I don't feel like it at the beginning of Christ is the mystery of God revealed can we I I I've been I'm going I'm doing real good so we got a few more minutes but at the beginning I mean I'm doing real good on time you can judge content at the beginning of chrisis the mystery of God revealed brother brandham deals with a story he tells a story about Lee Vil and I cut it out I'll be honest with you I I took it out because brother BR was just talking and so I didn't think anym about it and I didn't include that in our study of Christ is the mystery because brother Bron then does a baby dedication some other things then he he begins preaching so I didn't include that in our study but I want to go back to it now and brother brandom said brother Veil is one of the finest man I ever knew but he's just a little too quick on the trigger and I've never really understood where this comment fit into Christ's the mystery of God revealed into the body of the sermon till now because he's talking about God unfolding himself in David and so he said he's just a little too quick on the trigger he said I always told him you know and he said I hope that's all right brother Veil I said brother veil was sitting there he said don't fly loose all at once sit still God is the one that's doing it God is the one that's doing it right and brother Veil got upset cuz everybody's rejecting the message and everybody's the veil's about there ready to fight if you ever met Lee Vil or what I'm told about him that that that's the way he was he's going on to his reward now but he was a fighter but brother Brandon said sit still God is the one that's doing it and in doing that he told him the story about David from 2 Samuel this Story 2 Samuel 16:5 when King David came to baham behold then came out a man of the family in the house of Saul who name was shemi the son of GE he came forth and cursed still as he came it's amazing who all shows up when it looks like you're down and out right you know people just pile on right when it looks like you're down and out then here all come all the shemas out of the woodwor he never said nothing as long as David was in his throne but when David's a rejected King going up the hill weeping here comes shemiah to throw some rocks at him and curse him and he cast at David and that all the Servants of King David and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand on his left we're go down to verse n and abashi the son of Zariah who was one of David's Mighty Men He said why should this dead dog curse my Lord the King right let me go over I pray thee and take off his head and if I had been David I'd have been real tempted cuz it was his head doing all the damage you know talking cursing maybe the Rocks didn't hurt too bad but it was the words listen and the King said listen what have I to do with you you sons of Zariah so let him curse because the Lord has said unto him curse David that's hard to wrap your mind around but see he had the to fulfill a type of Christ in his life but and in order to do that the Lord actually said oh God CH shemiah cursed David right we know God allows evil spirits to influence people so it's not God directly himself but we see the type of that Micaiah a lying Spirit come up before the Lord and said who will go and be a you know tell these prophets the wrong thing he said you go do it right God allows it so God allowed a cursing Spirit an evil Spirit to come on this shemiah to curse David and David said the Lord told him to do it who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so and David said to AB abashi and to all his servants behold my son which came forth out of my bowel seeks my life he said it just it's just really bad right now said my own son's seeking my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone let him curse for the Lord ha bidden him now I know there's not going to be much dancing and shouting over that if you can think about your own life and think about some of the things that people say about you you said what it wasn't true neither was what he was saying about David David wasn't a bloodthirsty Tyrant but he that's the way he viewed him because he was one of the House of Saul right David wasn't a bloodthirsty Tyrant but but here shemiah thought he was now he said God has allowed this for a reason now later on that day after Brother brandham Talks to Lee Vil he said the tax collector called and I know it's getting close to tax season in fact I filed mine today but the payment don't go out till the 15th I'm not giving them my money a day early I feel really bad about that because there's so much we could do with that you know and I feel like CU I live off the ties of the people's the Lord's money so it aggravates Ates me it aggravated brother brother brandom the tax man he said they give him okay to write a check and and then as soon as they wrote it boy it hit the bank and here they come back after it and so and and he said everybody started to say well that old tax collector Tax Collector's easy to to to pick on isn't he that old tax collector and they're all talking about him and brother BR said not thinking of what IID told Brother Vil I said let him alone maybe the Lord told him to do that now watch God was trying to move brother brandom in a certain direction he said I know more than said that till a light flashed on the wall and rode across there brother Veil and my wife sitting there come on back to Arizona see we don't always know what God's doing God was trying to move brother Brandon make him a little bit uncomfortable because he'd come back to Jeffersonville and there was a few more things on the mountain that God wanted to show him his own healing was one of them right you can find that in in uh on the wings of a stat Dove he needed to show him some more things he had to show him the mystery of marriage and divorce he had to show him all these other things so he said come on back to Arizona so he used the tax collector to make brother brandom uncomfortable he said maybe the Lord told him to do it what was it the spirit of Christ in a prophet but I love the fact that one day even the persecutor will fall at the feet of Our Lord right it said all every knee shall bow is that right every knee and in 2 Samuel 19:18 it says there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household to do what he thought good now this is as and you just pardon me for a minute I'll be done in just a minute but he here is as they're going up they're going back into the city they've won the war and things look different when David's in power I'm looking forward to that day and they went over a ferry boat to do and car carry the king's household to do what he thought good and shemiah the son of Gir fell down before the king fell down before the king same guy on his way out of town he threw rocks at him spit on him made fun of him cursed him the same guy fell down before the king oh one day every knee shall bow as he was come over Jordan he said to the king let not my Lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my Lord the king went out of Jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart for my thy servant does know that I have sinned therefore behold I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to get down to meet my Lord the king he said you see me I was down here first I bowed the knee first I'm not cursing this time because David was coming back in power now he he he repented but his heart didn't change he apologized but his heart wasn't changed and you'll find I don't have time to get in the whole story but you'll find that Solomon ended up killing him because David when he died before he died he asked he told Solomon he said you better watch that guy he said one day you'll have to take his head off and so Solomon puts him under house arrest he makes him his prisoner in in he makes him his prisoner there it's a actually as I think about it it's a great type of the Millennium because there will be some who will be there who will end up rebelling after the thousand years I can't even begin to explain that the best thousand years that there's ever been and at the end some Rebel but during this Millennial reign of Solomon as he was there here comes shemiah and Rebels during that time and how he does it is they put they made him a prisoner but he wouldn't stay within the walls of Jerusalem and when his slaves got out and went to another Another Part another another part of the country he went after him and he ended up dying but David still showed the type of Christ David did not lay retribution to him he let him wait until the time oh church we just remember he said vengeance is mine sayith the Lord we don't have to respond all the time very quickly we don't even have to respond uh very quickly to each other let God handle it maybe the Lord told them to do it no it's hard to take but it's true we find that in Christ when when he was on the cross and he cried out father forgive them they don't know what they're doing that same spirit that was in David and that same Spirit came on Stephen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and step displayed the same thing when he was stoned he said lay not this sin to their charge and there was another benjamite right we've talked about Benjamin before benjam was a ravening wolf Benjamin is a type of the Flesh in the Bible he's a type of our flesh which is never converted but here uh here comes uh uh Stephen that said lay not this sin to their charge and a young Rabbi named Saul was watching that and he began breathing out threatenings and Slaughters to the son of David and and he let him go for a while but one day Saul was literally brought to his knees knocked off of his horse bowed down to the King of Kings he was completely forgiven oh I'm closing with this but listen he was completely forgiven he became a prisoner but you know legalism won't hold a benjamite in his place now I hope you catch that tonight legalism won't hold your flesh in its place Solomon could not hold Oh my he could not hold that benjami in his place right legalism would not have held Saul in his place but he said by the grace of God I am what I am oh I'm so glad for his grace tonight legalism won't hold you but love will Hallelujah love will hold you amen but now look one day every knee will bow do we believe that but Paul Paul would not go out of the Ark of Safety he was he said I keep under my body I bring it under subjection let's having him preach to others I'm myself should become a Cast Away what was he saying he's saying I'm a prisoner of love and he introduced himself Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ just like shemiah only he had the Holy Ghost he could stay in the city he's unfolded himself he unfolded himself through Paul he unfolded himself through Moses through Joseph through David now he reveals himself in US wonder if that same Spirit could be in us tonight as we close as musicians come I wonder if that same Spirit could be in us as he unfolds himself in our lives that we could say father forgive them they don't know what they're doing maybe the Lord told them to do it maybe it happened for a reason even though we completely do not understand it but the spirit of Christ in US it won't hold a grudge the benjamite will but the spirit of Christ won't what was it we we are completely forgiven because we're a prisoner of his love and as he reveals himself in us we will forgive others we will re forgive others do you believe it tonight heyen let's bow our heads together I want to bow to him now don't you I I push through tonight I appreciate some of the brothers prayed with me before church I've been having trouble with my back and but I feel like the Lord's helped me in this service so thank you for praying for me and I I don't know maybe it's just for me but I feel like there's a lot more times when I could say maybe the Lord told him to do that instead of responding instead of trying to fix it if we just say maybe the Lord has a plan maybe we need to wait renew our strength and see what God does instead of responding quickly to these things is that your desire and your prayer say Lord I want you to unfold yourself in me would you would you raise your hand with me I I I want the hold the spirit of Christ to be unfolded in my life to where I can wait Lord if you don't deal with them till after the Millennium I'll still wait I'll wait I I want your spirit on me Lord I Want to Be Right I I want you to reveal yourself unfold yourself through my life in this way oh God that the people would know that I've been with you like they knew with stepen like they knew when Paul got saved let them know that I've been changed I've been taken I've been I've been taken out of this old benjamite flesh and something is holding me something Beyond Myself has grabbed a hold of me Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we love you tonight we thank you for your word we thank you for your spirit Lord we thank you for the presence that we felt in the our services lately Lord I pray you continue to move Lord I see these Lord these things in the scripture and you you just brought it to my mind oh God I pray it would be a blessing in some way Lord I I don't know what we're dealing with what each one is dealing with but I know Lord there's many times that I could say Lord maybe you told them to do that just move on with my life and that would be displaying your attribute I pray you grant that today Lord we see that you are the mystery of God revealed and we ask you to reveal yourself in US Lord that's what you're wanting to do in this hour Lord we ask you to be free in our midst oh God be free
