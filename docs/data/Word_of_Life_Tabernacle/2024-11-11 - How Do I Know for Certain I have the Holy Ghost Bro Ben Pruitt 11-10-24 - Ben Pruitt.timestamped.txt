[38:04] just briefly 1 Corinthians chap 12 and
[38:07] verse 13 try not to hold you all long
[38:09] tonight but uh we just want to get into
[38:12] the word of
[38:13] God 1 Corinthians chapter
[38:18] 12 and we'll read from verse
[38:22] 13 just a moment to get there you young
[38:25] people got your Bibles tonight and going
[38:27] to need the Bible and need to listen
[38:30] verse 13 for by one Spirit we are we all
[38:33] baptized into one body whether we be
[38:37] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[38:40] free and have been ma all made to drink
[38:44] into one Spirit pray the Lord would add
[38:48] his Blessing to the word you may be
[38:49] seated
[38:53] tonight I was asked a question here a
[38:56] while back about the Holy SP Spirit it
[38:58] was actually not a young person that
[38:59] asked me this question but I'll uh give
[39:02] you a little bit of the question but not
[39:03] all of it because I don't want to
[39:04] embarrass the person but I think it
[39:06] would be good for all of us to
[39:08] understand how do we know for certain
[39:11] that we have the baptism of the Holy
[39:13] Ghost and I was talking to someone
[39:16] earlier about what I was going to speak
[39:17] on and Levi told me he said you know one
[39:20] preacher he had heard just said well you
[39:21] just know you just know and actually
[39:24] that's not a bad not a bad uh not a bad
[39:27] way of putting it but we're going to get
[39:28] a little bit more depth tonight and you
[39:30] do just know but it's the devil's job to
[39:33] come and try to take that knowledge away
[39:34] from you it's his job to try to attack
[39:37] you in that and so uh we uh we we need
[39:41] to understand uh that the baptism of the
[39:44] Holy Ghost is something we can have we
[39:46] need to understand that it's something
[39:47] that we need that we need you young
[39:50] people you you you understand that you
[39:52] you've got to have it to get out of here
[39:55] we're not going to leave here without
[39:56] the bap AP ISM of the Holy Ghost without
[39:58] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:00] you've got to be sealed or you won't go
[40:02] in a Rapture right and so we we don't
[40:05] want to be here for the tribulation
[40:06] period we want to go home and so we want
[40:09] to be sealed we that's the baptism of
[40:11] the Holy Ghost that takes us to that now
[40:13] the question that I had uh they said
[40:15] brother Ben I've been reading on the
[40:16] Holy Ghost for some time now and I have
[40:17] a lot of questions I've heard people say
[40:20] they have the Holy Ghost but it doesn't
[40:21] show in people's nature and sometime I'd
[40:23] like to hear how you receive God's
[40:25] spirit and says different Supernatural
[40:27] things things has happened that I can't
[40:28] explain but I knew it was God and they
[40:30] said I don't want to miss the Rapture I
[40:32] want to know that I know that I know and
[40:34] I have his spirit that ought to be all
[40:36] of us tonight and so that was the
[40:39] question and I thought it would be
[40:40] especially good if we addressed it uh
[40:42] for the Youth and I'll say about myself
[40:46] uh maybe maybe my own testimony will
[40:48] help some of you I was raised in church
[40:50] and I had a heart for the Lord I was in
[40:53] church I don't remember we never didn't
[40:55] go to church we always went to church
[40:57] but
[40:58] I heard a lot of different teachings and
[40:59] things over the years I was unsure of
[41:03] whether I had the Holy Ghost and so I
[41:05] come up I was baptized at the age of
[41:07] seven I gave my heart to the Lord I
[41:10] preached uh my first sermon when I was
[41:12] 12 years old and uh and you know I don't
[41:16] know why somebody let me preach at that
[41:17] age but they did and so I started
[41:20] preaching young some of you all remember
[41:22] the forest when I started preaching
[41:23] around here I was about 16 17 years old
[41:26] and and and so I but I wasn't sure until
[41:29] just before that actually when I was
[41:32] still living at home I wasn't sure of my
[41:35] salvation even I wasn't sure I was even
[41:37] going to heaven and I was preaching the
[41:40] gospel I wasn't sure that I had the
[41:43] baptism the Holy Ghost I knew I needed
[41:44] it but I wasn't sure and I had a lot of
[41:46] conviction in my life but yet I went
[41:49] through things that a young person goes
[41:50] through and had the same Temptations and
[41:52] things that all of you go through and
[41:55] and so I locked myself in a room one day
[41:57] in our basement in the house that my dad
[41:59] built and I'll never forget this I I I
[42:01] locked myself in that room and I said
[42:03] Lord I I heard in the message where
[42:05] brother brandom said that uh he said uh
[42:08] buddy Robinson got in the cornfield and
[42:10] he said if you don't give me the Holy
[42:12] Ghost you're going to find a bag of
[42:13] bones and and so I said Lord I need the
[42:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost I need to be
[42:17] sure and and so I believe God did
[42:19] something for me that night that he gave
[42:21] me the Holy Ghost
[42:23] and and it did and and I locked myself
[42:26] in the room I said I'm not going to I'm
[42:28] going to leave here till I got it and
[42:29] that's where I put my steak down and
[42:31] that's where I've held on to ever since
[42:33] I believe I'm going to heaven I believe
[42:35] I'm going to make it I'm going to be in
[42:37] the
[42:38] Rapture so I know we've have to have
[42:41] that experience I've had many other
[42:43] experiences I've spoke with tongues I've
[42:45] seen Miracles done I've baptized people
[42:48] and led them to the Lord I've had
[42:50] spiritual dreams at times and and
[42:52] understood things about people and but
[42:55] that's I'm not saying that to glorify
[42:56] myself all of you many of you have done
[42:59] those same things but those things is
[43:01] not how we know that we have the Holy
[43:05] Ghost right that's not how we know and I
[43:09] want to go through some of the things
[43:10] that how why we don't know or how we
[43:13] what what is not the evidence of the
[43:15] Holy Ghost before we get to what it is
[43:17] and so the F in the first place if
[43:19] you've been baptized that's good but
[43:21] baptism water baptism is not the new
[43:24] birth right so you need to be baptized
[43:27] aped young people if you haven't been
[43:28] baptized you need to be baptized
[43:30] sometimes I don't think we stress that
[43:31] enough Peter said repent and be baptized
[43:34] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[43:36] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[43:39] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[43:40] so if you have been baptized you should
[43:43] believe that the Holy Ghost is coming
[43:46] right some of you Elders can say Amen to
[43:48] that you you can believe the Holy Ghost
[43:50] is coming but yet you it is not the gift
[43:54] of the Holy Ghost you will receive the
[43:56] gift of the Holy Ghost ghost and that's
[43:58] because of obedience baptism is about
[44:00] obedience Peter says baptism do also now
[44:03] save us he said not the putting away of
[44:05] the filth of the flesh but the answer of
[44:07] a good conscience toward God by the
[44:09] resurrection of Jesus Christ Peter could
[44:12] you give me just a little more monitors
[44:14] I've I've lost my
[44:17] monitors now brother brand says I
[44:19] believe you're saved by accepting Jesus
[44:21] Christ and water baptism is an outward
[44:24] expression to show that something
[44:26] inwardly has happened because the water
[44:29] has no virtue it's just a symbol so you
[44:32] could be baptized and not have the
[44:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost you can
[44:36] believe and not have the baptism of the
[44:39] Holy Ghost yet believing is
[44:42] essential all right we must believe if
[44:44] you don't believe you can't even get to
[44:45] square one you've got to believe without
[44:48] faith no man can please God and yet
[44:51] Believing by itself isn't proof of the
[44:53] Holy Ghost Jesus said this he said very
[44:57] verely I say unto you he that heareth my
[44:58] word and believeth on him that sent me
[45:00] hath everlasting life shall not come
[45:02] into condemnation but has passed from
[45:04] Death un life brother Ram explains that
[45:06] and says that hearing is understanding
[45:10] comprehending so it's not just hearing
[45:13] but it's hearing with spiritual ears and
[45:15] we know that they all heard with these
[45:17] ears but they did not all obey and so we
[45:19] find even the Devil he's a Believer how
[45:22] many know that the devil the Bible says
[45:24] the devil th believest there's one God
[45:26] that doest well the Devils also believe
[45:28] and tremble that's a lot more than some
[45:30] of us right they really believe it right
[45:34] but and they tremble at what what's
[45:36] coming they know what's in their future
[45:38] oh if we can only get as much a
[45:39] revelation of what's in our future as
[45:41] the devil's got of what's in his future
[45:44] he knows his time is short and that's
[45:46] why he comes after you like he does but
[45:49] yet we know that that not only is his
[45:51] time short but our time is short we're
[45:53] going home if we get a revelation of
[45:56] that
[45:57] but the devil believes and
[45:59] trembles so brother BR says to believe
[46:01] it is not enough to walk around where
[46:04] it's at isn't enough that's to make
[46:07] yourself
[46:08] worse right because he he explained that
[46:11] he said it's like a log if you've ever
[46:13] been walking in the forest for the ship
[46:14] and you you step on a an Old Log and
[46:17] it's been in the water and you step on
[46:19] it looks good but when you step on it
[46:21] just
[46:22] explodes right what what is that it's
[46:24] it's been it's had access to water but
[46:26] not
[46:27] life right its roots aren't in the
[46:29] ground and so it's sitting in the water
[46:32] and it actually gets worse because it's
[46:34] in the water what if it was the dry
[46:36] stick up on the ground so being in
[46:38] church won't save you and just believing
[46:41] is not enough actually if you believe
[46:45] you don't believe if you don't receive
[46:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost eventually
[46:50] you find that your belief is not enough
[46:51] it won't hold you now believing really
[46:54] believing ought to lead us to the
[46:56] baptism of the ho Holy Ghost repenting
[46:58] is not enough and yet you must
[47:01] repent right the Zeal of the hour is to
[47:04] repent but repentance isn't a seal of
[47:07] the Holy Ghost your tears are not a seal
[47:09] of the Holy Ghost you say well I went to
[47:11] The Altar and I cried that don't mean
[47:12] that that's an Evidence of the Holy
[47:14] Ghost but we need that we need to
[47:18] promote that we need to someone said
[47:20] here not long go we need to make the
[47:21] altar great again we need to make it
[47:24] wean we need to make it normal for
[47:26] people to cry an altar to come to an
[47:28] altar to to seek God in that way it
[47:31] should not be abnormal for us to do that
[47:33] in our churches brother the for us
[47:34] that'll be something that's common to us
[47:37] to see good people come and ask for
[47:39] prayer but that's alone is not enough
[47:42] that's not evidence because you came is
[47:44] not evidence that you have the Holy
[47:45] Ghost we know that because as I said
[47:47] this morning Esau was rejected he found
[47:50] no place of repentance we sought it
[47:53] carefully with tears but God doesn't
[47:55] seal your tears
[47:57] he seals your
[47:59] faith are you with me now and we're for
[48:02] that we want we believe in Repentance
[48:04] but that's not evidence the Holy Spirit
[48:07] gifts of the Spirit are not evidence of
[48:08] the Holy
[48:10] Spirit the Pentecostals taught that
[48:12] tongu was evidence so you'll find
[48:13] brother brandom dealing with that over
[48:15] and over and over and over again because
[48:16] that was their major his major
[48:18] disagreement especially in the early
[48:20] years was on that that's what they
[48:22] really had against him is he didn't
[48:25] believe in uh tongues as the evidence of
[48:28] the Holy Spirit and you say well how
[48:30] could they come up with that well in the
[48:31] Bible if you look in the book of Acts
[48:34] most of the time when people received
[48:35] the Holy Ghost they spoke in tongues so
[48:38] the Pentecostals looked at that and said
[48:39] okay said that's the evidence of the
[48:41] Holy
[48:42] Ghost right but there's nothing in the
[48:44] scripture that says
[48:46] that right but and and and in fact Paul
[48:49] says have all the gifts of healing he
[48:52] said do all speak with
[48:53] tongues no obviously no all interpret
[48:57] but these gifts are in the body gifts
[49:00] can be there whether you're saved or not
[49:02] saved right gifts can fall in the body
[49:05] in a supernatural way and someone could
[49:07] speak in tongues and not even be right
[49:10] right absolutely not be right so tongues
[49:13] is no evidence of the Holy Ghost it's
[49:16] one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost and
[49:18] the devil can impersonate everything
[49:20] he's got he said Divine Healing and
[49:23] everything else he can impersonate that
[49:25] and we know even healing We Believe
[49:26] healing is from God just because the man
[49:28] who laid hands on you and you were
[49:30] healed uh you were healed when he did
[49:32] that doesn't mean the man is even right
[49:34] it's by faith so and I'm going to
[49:38] address something here I we see a lot of
[49:40] folks some young people you know you go
[49:41] to camp or someplace like that and
[49:43] you'll see a lot of folks slaying in the
[49:46] spirit and I know we got several young
[49:49] people aren't here today but they're
[49:50] watching or or we'll watch it you'll see
[49:54] somebody's slay in the spirit and you
[49:56] look at that and you go through the par
[49:58] line maybe nothing happens you think
[50:00] well I I didn't get what they got well
[50:02] being slain in the spirit is's no
[50:03] evidence that you got
[50:05] anything but it is a
[50:09] blessing right it's real it's a blessing
[50:11] and I don't want you to ever mock
[50:12] somebody or make fun of somebody right
[50:15] CU they got slain in the spirit they
[50:17] danced in the spirit because those
[50:18] things are real he said how do you know
[50:21] well Prophet told us said it was he said
[50:23] it was a blessing of God but not proof
[50:25] of anything he he was asked the question
[50:27] brother brandom as I went through the
[50:28] prayer line a short time ago Anointed
[50:29] Hands were laid on me and and prayer was
[50:31] made for my unsaved husband I was slain
[50:34] by the power of the Lord is this a
[50:36] definite sign that he'll be saved so I
[50:39] come up with a request and I was slain
[50:41] in the spirit is that a sign he'll be
[50:43] saved and brother Brandon was very
[50:45] cautious in his response he said sister
[50:48] I wouldn't think that it was a definite
[50:50] sign that he was to be saved though I
[50:52] believe he will be saved certainly he
[50:54] said now could you say that th said the
[50:56] Lord be careful about that cuz see it
[50:59] might be the Holy Spirit blessing you
[51:01] because you've taken a place of Christ
[51:03] in other words she went up there and and
[51:05] become a a intermediary she stood up
[51:08] there in the place of her husband she
[51:09] took the place of Christ to him and or
[51:12] for him he talks about tongues and and
[51:15] all of that he said now you see God
[51:16] knows where those things are and he has
[51:18] a way of doing it he has his own way of
[51:20] doing it and so he said we must just
[51:22] submit ourselves to what he does listen
[51:25] to me young people when you come through
[51:26] a prayer line when you're prayed for up
[51:28] here when you come to the altar don't be
[51:29] looking for any certain thing to happen
[51:32] but just accept whatever God does for
[51:35] you right so Melody God may do something
[51:38] different for Melody than he does for
[51:40] Millie but just accept what he does are
[51:43] you with me now just accept that he he
[51:45] may not act all the time in Peter like
[51:47] he does in trip or or in one like he
[51:49] does the other we know we got folks here
[51:51] some of you folks are wonderful
[51:52] Christian people and you've hardly ever
[51:54] moved a muscle in church
[51:57] and you're wonderful Christian people
[51:59] but you sit there and just listen to the
[52:00] word and then we got other people that
[52:02] dance and run and shout and are emot I'm
[52:04] an emotional person but that don't mean
[52:06] that's not proof of anything it's just
[52:08] proof God's blessing us right God's
[52:11] blessing us but it's not proof that that
[52:13] we're right there's got to be something
[52:14] more than that because those momentary
[52:16] Sensations will fail you they'll leave
[52:19] but there's got to be something you can
[52:21] put a uh put a steak down and a can be a
[52:24] rock in your life that no matter what
[52:25] the devil does to you you can say I'm a
[52:27] Christian I believe I'm going to make it
[52:31] because we don't want a bunch of people
[52:32] that are scared all the time afraid keep
[52:35] having to come back get resaved all the
[52:37] time we've had enough of that we want
[52:40] people that are solid go ask somebody go
[52:43] ask one of these Elders how they made it
[52:45] all these years it wasn't because they
[52:47] just kept coming and getting resaved it
[52:49] was because there was something on the
[52:50] inside that attracted them to the word
[52:52] of God and held them to the message of
[52:54] the
[52:55] hour huh
[52:57] so we believe they saw something real
[52:59] and they believed
[53:00] it so brother Brandon says if you don't
[53:03] watch now let me go back to that other
[53:05] one he said we must just submit
[53:06] ourselves to what he does and then he
[53:08] said the hard thing to do when you get
[53:10] there is hold yourself from that one
[53:11] little knife edge of fanaticism to a
[53:14] truth right so that that's the thing you
[53:17] got to be careful and I don't want to
[53:19] ever discourage you because we need the
[53:21] move of the Holy Spirit we need that but
[53:25] just make sure that you don't put your
[53:26] faith in the effect but put your faith
[53:29] in the person Jesus
[53:32] Christ amen now I'm not amening myself
[53:36] I'm trying to amen the word now brother
[53:39] BR say if you don't watch the devil will
[53:40] throw you right over into a bunch of
[53:41] fanaticism and you lose all your
[53:43] experience and everything else when you
[53:45] do that so you lose confidence what you
[53:47] do have right if you make try to make
[53:49] too much out of the experience itself he
[53:52] said but if you can just hold the solid
[53:54] truth watch the Bible stay with it stay
[53:56] Meek and humble God will just keep
[53:58] taking you on towards Calvary just on
[54:00] down the road like that if you'll just
[54:01] stay with that he said that's something
[54:03] like yours was Sister he's still
[54:05] answering this question he said God was
[54:07] just giving you a blessing he said it
[54:09] might have been might be a definite
[54:11] witness that you're going to but I
[54:12] wouldn't rely just on that and say the
[54:14] Lord told me cuz I I said that
[54:16] experience because it might encourage
[54:17] you to continue to believe on he said
[54:19] whatever it was that God did there
[54:20] brought the spirit upon you like that it
[54:22] was for some purpose it might have been
[54:24] something else but if it was for you
[54:26] husband he'll sure come right into the
[54:27] kingdom of God right cuz God always
[54:30] brings it to pass what do we hold on to
[54:32] then hold on to the word what do we hold
[54:34] on to for our kids not the way they're
[54:35] acting currently hold on to the word
[54:38] what does the word have to say are you
[54:41] with me
[54:44] now I I appreciate you Elders in the
[54:46] back backing me I I uh I I know these
[54:50] young people appreciate it and all of us
[54:52] we need to I think we need to hear these
[54:54] things fundamental truth of the message
[54:56] I know it's not flashy but it's just
[54:58] something we need to
[54:59] hear you know you don't know you have it
[55:02] by because you can
[55:05] preach or because you can
[55:08] teach right because you have an
[55:10] understanding of the message the Bible
[55:12] says the gifts and callings of God are
[55:13] without
[55:14] repentance and Matthew
[55:17] 7:22 Jesus said many will say to me in
[55:19] that day Lord Lord have we not
[55:21] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[55:22] have cast out devils in thy name done
[55:25] many wonderful works
[55:26] and then when I profess unto them I
[55:28] never knew you depart from me you that
[55:29] work iniquity brother Bron said I
[55:32] realized and you realize too ministers
[55:34] he said that a man can take a Divine
[55:36] gift and send his soul to hell with it
[55:39] right so we need to be careful we don't
[55:41] rely just on
[55:43] gifts this one I think is a little bit
[55:45] harder for message people but living a
[55:47] good life is not the evidence of the
[55:50] baptism of the Holy
[55:52] Ghost right it's not if that was true
[55:55] then every
[55:57] Muslim that I met in Egypt has the Holy
[55:59] Ghost cuz they they they outlive us many
[56:01] of them
[56:02] do many of them live good
[56:05] lives that's not the evidence of the
[56:07] Holy Ghost it's an evidence that God is
[56:09] working in your life when your life
[56:11] begins to resemble the word but it's not
[56:13] the evidence of the Holy Ghost because
[56:15] someone could just naturally be a person
[56:17] who was prone or at least so it look
[56:20] like that was prone to doing things in a
[56:22] right way they still need saved they
[56:25] still need the power of the Holy Ghost
[56:27] just because they don't make mistakes
[56:28] all the time doesn't mean that they're
[56:30] filled with the Holy Ghost and sometimes
[56:32] that person it can be a very a deceiving
[56:35] thing see it's absolutely necessary to
[56:37] have Holiness in your life Paul said
[56:39] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[56:41] without which no man shall see the Lord
[56:42] that's an absolute necessity but
[56:45] Holiness itself is not a
[56:47] proof I was I grew up around Holiness
[56:49] people many people who would reject the
[56:51] word re reject the Oneness of the
[56:53] godhead reject the the truth that God
[56:55] sent a prophet reject all these things
[56:56] that we believe but they were they lived
[57:00] well they were wonderful people and I
[57:03] appreciate the fact that they lived well
[57:05] but that wasn't proof of the Holy Ghost
[57:07] because they turned down the word so
[57:10] it's absolutely necessary but it isn't
[57:11] all of it see you you can't work your
[57:14] way into God's
[57:16] favor I want you to understand that
[57:18] tonight you can work and make yourself
[57:21] look good and everybody will everybody
[57:23] be happy with you here in the church but
[57:24] you can't work your way into God 's
[57:28] favor you girls understand that you
[57:30] can't be good enough to make it into
[57:33] heaven you got to have the blood got to
[57:36] have a sacrifice made for you you got to
[57:38] identify with that
[57:39] sacrifice if you could work your way in
[57:42] Kane would make it brother Brandon said
[57:44] he was sincere built an altar knelt down
[57:45] and worshiped offered a sacrifice and
[57:47] prayed to God and if that's all God
[57:48] requires for you to belong to church and
[57:50] have an altar and pay your tithes and go
[57:52] to church and live a good life if that's
[57:53] all he requires he was unjust to condemn
[57:55] Cain because he did the same thing
[57:58] religion means a covering you can't be
[57:59] covered by your own good works there's
[58:01] only one thing that God will accept and
[58:03] that's the blood of Jesus Christ that's
[58:05] the only
[58:07] covering oh I'm so grateful for the
[58:10] blood you won't be you can't you don't
[58:13] know you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[58:14] by listening to
[58:15] tapes or by hearing your
[58:19] pastor or because your pastor says
[58:21] you've got it because your pastor can't
[58:23] give it to you you also can't take it
[58:25] away
[58:27] so you you you don't know that you have
[58:29] the Holy Ghost because your pastor
[58:31] thinks you do now come on Church you
[58:34] know that's the truth your favorite
[58:36] preacher or you listen to them all the
[58:38] time so well I just stream all the
[58:40] services all over the land and I listen
[58:42] to all of them that don't mean you're
[58:43] going to heaven right I've heard every
[58:46] tape all 1147 however many there are now
[58:49] I've heard every tape listen that that
[58:52] don't mean you're going to heaven cuz
[58:53] guess who else has hurt all of them the
[58:55] devil
[58:58] right we need to hear the voice of a
[58:59] prophet how many of how many believe
[59:01] that our kids need to hear it needs to
[59:03] be in our homes but the tapes themselves
[59:06] are not the Holy Ghost that's not the
[59:08] token if they were Millions would be
[59:10] going in the
[59:11] Rapture cuz there's Millions all over
[59:14] the world that hear tapes that's not
[59:16] that's not the Rapture but what is on
[59:18] the tapes when that becomes flesh and it
[59:20] begins to live that's what that's what
[59:23] we
[59:24] want but they said that's he said you
[59:26] say I believe I believe the message
[59:28] that's all right but that's that's good
[59:29] but you must have the token he said' do
[59:32] you hear random Tabernacle can I say can
[59:34] I change that that do you hear Word of
[59:36] Life Tabernacle you must have the token
[59:39] displayed without it all your believing
[59:41] is in vain you live a good life you
[59:43] listen to what the word says you go to
[59:45] church you try to live right that's fine
[59:47] but that's not it when I see the blood
[59:49] that's the token he said and the token
[59:52] here is not he said what he had to see
[59:53] the actual chemistry that was in the Old
[59:55] Testament because the life had gone he
[59:57] had gone from it he was an animal but
[59:58] here it's his own life that was in the
[1:00:00] blood and the chemistry was only a
[1:00:02] signal or a sign of sanctification but
[1:00:04] the life itself is the token for without
[1:00:07] the circumcision without the token
[1:00:09] you're not even in the Covenant he said
[1:00:11] the whole thing works together if you
[1:00:12] say you're circumcised to the word and
[1:00:14] it only then you'll believe the word if
[1:00:17] you believe the word then the token has
[1:00:18] got to come so in other words if you
[1:00:21] have really repented if you really
[1:00:22] believe the token will come that alone's
[1:00:24] not the token but the token will come
[1:00:27] repent be baptized you shall receive the
[1:00:29] gift of the Holy Ghost we know that love
[1:00:33] is not the token I'm almost through
[1:00:34] these and we'll go to what it
[1:00:36] is we know that love is not the
[1:00:39] token
[1:00:41] because and and yet the Bible says it's
[1:00:44] such a strong evidence of Christ
[1:00:48] working I'll say this uh if you don't
[1:00:52] have any love I'd check up
[1:00:56] if you don't love your brother whom you
[1:00:57] have seen how can you love God whom you
[1:01:00] have not
[1:01:01] seen if you don't love people if you
[1:01:04] don't love your neighbor if you don't
[1:01:06] love the people in the church are you
[1:01:09] with me now if you don't love God's
[1:01:11] people you probably don't love God but
[1:01:14] but having love is not necessarily an
[1:01:15] Evidence Bible says we know we passed
[1:01:18] from death into life because we love the
[1:01:19] Breen that's pretty strong but he that
[1:01:22] loveth not his brother abideth in death
[1:01:25] so it's a essential absolutely essential
[1:01:27] it's one of the ways that we know we
[1:01:29] passed from death into life just like
[1:01:30] when you start become a Christian you
[1:01:32] start paying ties you start following
[1:01:34] the word one of those one one thing that
[1:01:36] the word says is love your neighbor love
[1:01:37] your brother right but that's not the
[1:01:40] only thing by itself it isn't proof
[1:01:42] brother Brandon was having a
[1:01:44] conversation with Lee Vale about the
[1:01:45] evidence of the Holy Ghost and he said
[1:01:48] he knew it wasn't tongues and brother
[1:01:49] brand said I said the most perfect
[1:01:51] evidence I can think of is love so we
[1:01:54] got talking on that and then I thought
[1:01:55] that sounded pretty good so I just held
[1:01:56] that if a man has got love he said but
[1:01:58] one day the Lord in a vision
[1:01:59] straightened me out I'm glad we had a
[1:02:02] prophet who was
[1:02:03] honest he said that the evidence of the
[1:02:05] spirit was those who could receive the
[1:02:07] word neither love nor speaking in
[1:02:09] tongues but it's receiving the word so
[1:02:12] that brings us to this how do I know for
[1:02:15] certain that I have the Holy
[1:02:18] Ghost first of all the the baptism of
[1:02:21] the Holy Ghost is a definite experience
[1:02:25] right it's not just an accumulation of
[1:02:29] knowledge it's not a n a certain number
[1:02:32] of services
[1:02:34] visited right where you pass a certain
[1:02:37] thing it's not living so good in such a
[1:02:39] way that eventually you pass the
[1:02:43] inspection right that's not what the
[1:02:44] Holy Ghost is it's a definite
[1:02:47] experience in every case every account
[1:02:50] of the New Testament where people
[1:02:51] receive the Holy Ghost it was a definite
[1:02:54] singular experience brother brand said
[1:02:56] now the baptism with the Holy Spirit is
[1:02:58] a definite experience that a person must
[1:03:01] receive it's an experience so but the
[1:03:05] evidence of the experience is not the
[1:03:08] experience now does that make sense so
[1:03:12] the so you have a definite experience
[1:03:15] but you could have two people both come
[1:03:16] to the altar seeking the Holy Ghost both
[1:03:19] of them come both of them get blessed
[1:03:21] both of them cry both of them repent
[1:03:23] both of them get up and shout both of
[1:03:25] them walk way one have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:27] and one
[1:03:29] don't right and and why would that be
[1:03:32] why could that be well one number one in
[1:03:36] this age age that we're living in now
[1:03:37] the Holy Ghost will only Quicken the
[1:03:39] seed that's already inside of there
[1:03:41] there's got to be a seed there's got to
[1:03:42] be predestination election there right
[1:03:46] it's got to be something that God does
[1:03:47] for you you can't do it for yourself so
[1:03:50] the two might come but then you don't
[1:03:52] know what obedience has taken place in
[1:03:54] the person's life them to this we know
[1:03:56] obedience entitles Us full obedience to
[1:03:58] the Lord entitles us to the Token you
[1:04:00] don't know what type of obedience or
[1:04:02] whether that person has obeyed or
[1:04:04] whether it just looks like they've
[1:04:05] obeyed but they need to have obeyed God
[1:04:08] to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:04:09] but the experience itself is not the
[1:04:12] evidence but it's what follows the
[1:04:15] experience it it is in tongues as we've
[1:04:17] already said even though many speak with
[1:04:20] tongues the brand said that's no
[1:04:21] evidence of the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:04:22] rely upon that he said you can't rely
[1:04:25] upon the the fruit of the spirit because
[1:04:26] of first fruit of the spirit is love he
[1:04:28] said there's only one evidence of the
[1:04:30] holy spirit that I know of now listen to
[1:04:32] me that's a genuine faith in the
[1:04:35] promised word of the hour now brother
[1:04:38] Brandon puts this in several different
[1:04:40] ways but I want to take it scripturally
[1:04:41] and then we'll we'll finish and I I'll
[1:04:43] try to get you out of here just as soon
[1:04:44] as I can but it's an important thing now
[1:04:47] look that's the evidence of the Holy
[1:04:49] Ghost when God reveals to you and you
[1:04:52] see it thus sayith the Lord and accept
[1:04:56] it not what you are what you was or
[1:05:00] nothing about it it's what God has done
[1:05:02] for you now he said that's the
[1:05:05] evidence so we know you say well that's
[1:05:08] just you know brother brandom said that
[1:05:10] did you know that the evidence of the
[1:05:12] Holy Ghost is clearly defined in
[1:05:14] scripture it's very clear in the
[1:05:16] scripture brother Bram tells us that he
[1:05:18] said he give us Jesus give us the
[1:05:19] evidence of the Holy Ghost John
[1:05:21] 14 John
[1:05:24] 14:26 but the comfort which is the Holy
[1:05:26] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[1:05:27] name what is he going to do right here's
[1:05:30] how you know that he's there he will
[1:05:33] teach you all things someone say all
[1:05:37] things and bring all things to your
[1:05:39] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:05:42] you John 15:26 the next chapter but when
[1:05:45] the comforter has come whom I will send
[1:05:47] unto you from the father even the spirit
[1:05:49] of Truth which proceedeth from the
[1:05:50] father he shall testify of me what is he
[1:05:53] the spirit of Truth teaching you all
[1:05:55] things things John 16:13 how be it when
[1:05:58] he the spirit of Truth has come he will
[1:06:00] guide you he will guide you into all
[1:06:04] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:06:07] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:06:09] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:06:12] come so when you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:06:14] have an inside
[1:06:16] teacher
[1:06:18] that's bringing you from a baby to
[1:06:22] maturity right right right does that
[1:06:24] make sense yeah
[1:06:26] so the fact that you're coming from a
[1:06:28] baby to maturity and so that's why we
[1:06:31] judge nothing before the time right we
[1:06:33] we don't want to and sometimes the devil
[1:06:35] see it's his job to make you think well
[1:06:36] I don't have it I don't have it I here I
[1:06:38] made a mistake I slipped up I was
[1:06:40] influenced to do some minor thing no we
[1:06:42] don't look at it like that see we're not
[1:06:45] born adults we're born
[1:06:48] babies right and and even with the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost we we don't just get the Holy
[1:06:52] Ghost then it's all
[1:06:54] good right now now we're certain of our
[1:06:56] destination but there's a teacher on the
[1:06:59] inside right you got a little teacher in
[1:07:01] your heart now think about that kids a
[1:07:04] teacher in your heart that's teaching
[1:07:06] you the word and every time you go to do
[1:07:08] something that's not right before you
[1:07:10] had the Holy Ghost didn't bother you
[1:07:12] right or maybe it bothered you because
[1:07:13] you knew it was wrong but you just you
[1:07:15] just kept doing it you just kept going
[1:07:17] back to it but now there's a teacher on
[1:07:20] the inside right what's he doing he's
[1:07:22] bringing you back to the word he's
[1:07:24] reminding you of the word word and
[1:07:26] that's why a person that just lives in
[1:07:28] slop and sin and filth how could they
[1:07:30] have the Holy Ghost they're denying the
[1:07:33] word in their life are you with me now a
[1:07:36] person that that that that just
[1:07:38] continues and and in in all of those
[1:07:40] things how could they have the baptism
[1:07:41] the H ghost think it's time to check up
[1:07:44] right we need to understand the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost does something it's a it's a it's
[1:07:48] a tutor that's got control a control
[1:07:50] tower on the inside that actually
[1:07:52] controls our actions and our thinking
[1:07:53] and everything about it
[1:07:55] so when you have the Holy Ghost the
[1:07:57] inside
[1:07:58] teacher will be there it doesn't mean
[1:08:01] you'll never make a mistake but you're
[1:08:03] growing from a baby to
[1:08:07] maturity one day that same teacher is
[1:08:09] going to take you
[1:08:12] home oh that's what we
[1:08:14] need now the Holy Spirit when it comes
[1:08:16] it's a witness unto you this word is
[1:08:18] right the word for today not the word
[1:08:20] for Luther the word not for Moses he
[1:08:22] said we witness it's the truth but it's
[1:08:24] another day so that Holy Spirit teaches
[1:08:26] you that the word is right the holy
[1:08:28] spirit in you will not
[1:08:30] disagree with the
[1:08:32] word right it will people say well I was
[1:08:35] led of the Holy Ghost to do a certain
[1:08:36] thing not if it's not in the word right
[1:08:39] because the holy spirit will not
[1:08:40] disagree with the word he will not
[1:08:42] disagree with the scriptures he will not
[1:08:44] disagree you say well I feel led to go
[1:08:46] out and divorce my husband and marry
[1:08:48] another one divorce my wife the Holy
[1:08:49] Spirit didn't lead you to do that right
[1:08:52] because he will not lead against the
[1:08:54] word right and when you see people sons
[1:08:56] of God are led by the spirit of God when
[1:08:58] you see young people led by the word and
[1:09:01] begin to order their lives by the word
[1:09:02] you begin to see there's something there
[1:09:05] that experience did something in their
[1:09:07] life how do you know for certain because
[1:09:11] he's brought you to where you
[1:09:13] are you you wouldn't be there without it
[1:09:16] someone said if you ever seen a turtle
[1:09:17] on a fence post you know it didn't get
[1:09:19] there by
[1:09:21] itself right if you ever seen a person
[1:09:24] in maturity of the word he didn't get
[1:09:26] there by himself are you with me now you
[1:09:29] said well I wish I could be like Dad I
[1:09:30] wish I could be like Mom I wish I could
[1:09:32] be like brother Danny I wish I could be
[1:09:33] like brother the forest or somebody
[1:09:35] that's been around for a long time he
[1:09:36] didn't get there by himself the Holy
[1:09:38] Ghost had to be in his life and the Holy
[1:09:41] Ghost is the inside teacher so how do
[1:09:44] you know well you that inside teacher is
[1:09:46] going to say Amen to every
[1:09:48] word right he's not going to deny his
[1:09:51] own word yeah brother brand says 1
[1:09:53] Corinthians 13 says this when that was
[1:09:55] just perfect has come now he was asked a
[1:09:57] question about the same thing about the
[1:09:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he goes
[1:10:02] through how tongues do not it and then
[1:10:04] he says when that which is perfect is
[1:10:05] come that which is in part should be
[1:10:06] done away with he sets all these little
[1:10:09] things are jumping up and down like a
[1:10:10] kid trying to talk in tongues all these
[1:10:11] other things he said when that which is
[1:10:13] perfect we do have today by God's help
[1:10:16] the perfect interpretation of the word
[1:10:17] with Divine
[1:10:18] Vindication then that which is in part
[1:10:21] is done away with when I was a child I
[1:10:22] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:10:24] when I become a man I put away child
[1:10:25] things if you want to know about the
[1:10:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost go listen to
[1:10:29] what is the Holy Ghost and what was the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost given for and then go to uh
[1:10:35] go to questions and answers number two
[1:10:37] and number three in 1964 also to the
[1:10:41] Token those sermons will really solidify
[1:10:43] because brother Bram has asked and he
[1:10:45] answers the question several times in
[1:10:48] just a little bit different way during
[1:10:49] those questions and answers the Bible
[1:10:52] tells us I want to dwell on this for
[1:10:53] just a minute uh because you don't want
[1:10:56] to always be what you are today Jared
[1:10:58] you don't always want to be I know
[1:11:00] you're tall and handsome and but you
[1:11:03] don't always want to be what you are
[1:11:05] today right you want to be more than
[1:11:07] what you are sir you want to be a
[1:11:09] full-grown
[1:11:10] adult right and that's true
[1:11:13] spiritually listen church I've been
[1:11:15] preaching for nearly 30 years and I want
[1:11:17] to I want to be more than what I am
[1:11:19] today sir I want to be more I think all
[1:11:22] of us could say Amen to that I I want to
[1:11:24] be more I want to be what God's called
[1:11:26] me to be I I want to grow in the grace
[1:11:29] and the maturity of God and the Holy
[1:11:31] Ghost will lead me to that it takes the
[1:11:34] Holy Ghost to do that we don't want to
[1:11:36] always be a baby and always have to keep
[1:11:38] making the same mistakes over and over
[1:11:40] again at some point the young and's got
[1:11:42] to grow up as one of my friends put it
[1:11:44] at some point we got to reach a place of
[1:11:47] maturity right and begin to begin to
[1:11:49] grab a hold of the word for ourselves
[1:11:51] and say I don't have to have my pastor
[1:11:53] taught me into being saved every week I
[1:11:55] I don't have to have a deacon keep an
[1:11:56] eye on me and make sure that I'm saved
[1:11:58] every week but I don't have to have my
[1:11:59] parents always over my shoulder making
[1:12:02] sure I'm still saved but I know there's
[1:12:04] an inside teacher inside of me reach a
[1:12:06] place to mature I don't want to go out
[1:12:07] on God I love him too much to fail him
[1:12:09] now I don't want to do those things
[1:12:12] anymore I've reached that place in my
[1:12:14] life inside teacher that which is in
[1:12:17] part has been done away with and that
[1:12:18] which is perfect which is the full word
[1:12:20] of God has
[1:12:22] come the Bible says as many as receed
[1:12:25] him to them gave he power to become the
[1:12:27] sons of God that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:12:29] is even to those that believe on his
[1:12:31] name Ephesians 4:15 but speaking the
[1:12:33] truth and love may grow up into him in
[1:12:36] all things he's talking about the
[1:12:37] five-fold ministry here and what our job
[1:12:39] is and how we should edify the church so
[1:12:42] that we can the church can grow the
[1:12:45] church can grow what does that that's
[1:12:47] the job of the holy spirit in your life
[1:12:49] so that you grow you want to know if you
[1:12:51] have the Holy Ghost see if there's
[1:12:52] growth in your life
[1:12:56] huh you still got the same old temper
[1:12:58] that you've had all your life and you
[1:12:59] just make an excuse for it come on
[1:13:02] Church you still got the same old
[1:13:04] problem you all your life you dealt with
[1:13:06] the same old things I realize that you
[1:13:08] still deal with a prickly nature I
[1:13:09] realize that but at some point it
[1:13:11] shouldn't control you no
[1:13:13] more right is there growth in your life
[1:13:16] if there's growth you can see there holy
[1:13:18] you may not be perfect you may not be
[1:13:19] doing everything just the way maybe
[1:13:21] everybody wants you to or you even
[1:13:22] expect yourself to but there's something
[1:13:24] on the inside that's leading you from
[1:13:26] where you are to a better place there's
[1:13:29] something in you calling you to the
[1:13:30] house of God you may not have been as
[1:13:31] faithful to attend church as you should
[1:13:33] have been but something inside of you is
[1:13:35] calling you to
[1:13:36] that right what is that the inside
[1:13:38] teacher the Holy
[1:13:40] Ghost
[1:13:42] heyen so John he
[1:13:45] said now so what is the evidence
[1:13:47] person's really filled with the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost brother
[1:13:50] brandom answers that question that's a
[1:13:52] question he's asked and he he says John
[1:13:57] 14:26 right when the Holy Ghost has come
[1:14:01] he will show you things to come he'll
[1:14:04] here it is he'll perfect
[1:14:06] it he'll perfect
[1:14:09] it right when the Holy Ghost is come he
[1:14:11] will perfect Oh my he will bring you
[1:14:15] into maturity maturity of the age he
[1:14:18] won't leave you that's why he said you
[1:14:19] don't have the Holy Ghost if you won't
[1:14:20] receive the word of the hour right
[1:14:23] because you you not you're not will to
[1:14:25] come into maturity if you have the Holy
[1:14:26] Ghost you you'll accept the word many
[1:14:29] times we're trying to reform people
[1:14:30] we're trying to psychologize people if
[1:14:32] that's a word we're trying to make them
[1:14:34] better in some way oh if they were just
[1:14:36] better if I could just had more
[1:14:37] counseling or whatever and really what
[1:14:39] they need is the Holy Ghost so he can
[1:14:40] begin to teach them from the
[1:14:43] inside right and if everybody had the
[1:14:45] Holy Ghost I've often felt sorry for
[1:14:47] denominational pastors for the force
[1:14:49] because of all always thought boy what
[1:14:50] would you do if all your congregation
[1:14:52] was not filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:14:54] that's tough
[1:14:56] right I believe that a lot of us are and
[1:14:58] I'm thankful for that why because you
[1:15:00] got an inside teacher and he's echoing
[1:15:03] what's coming across the
[1:15:04] pulpit right if I'm preaching the truth
[1:15:06] the inside teacher says Amen to that if
[1:15:09] you hear a tape brother br's preaching
[1:15:11] the inside teacher says Amen to
[1:15:14] that
[1:15:15] amen so he said he'll perfect it manads
[1:15:19] won't do it he is the word when he the
[1:15:23] Holy Ghost has come he will identify
[1:15:25] himself in you with the scripture and
[1:15:29] that is the true sign that the holy
[1:15:31] spirit is in you because it is the
[1:15:35] word listen John 6:45 brother Brandon
[1:15:38] references this when we talk about the
[1:15:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost he say it is
[1:15:42] written in the prophets they shall be
[1:15:43] all taught of God every man therefore
[1:15:46] that hath heard and hath learned of the
[1:15:49] father cometh unto me what is the Holy
[1:15:51] Ghost Inside teacher the Holy Ghost the
[1:15:55] inside teacher everyone that has learned
[1:15:56] of the father cometh unto me in Isaiah
[1:15:58] 54:13 where that where he quotes that
[1:16:01] scripture from it says all thy children
[1:16:03] brother Brown Put special emphasis on
[1:16:05] that he said not just anybody but the
[1:16:07] children right the the predestined of
[1:16:10] God all thy children shall be taught of
[1:16:13] the Lord and great shall be the Peace of
[1:16:15] thy children oh when you have the inside
[1:16:17] teacher there's peace in your life
[1:16:19] because there's something that that
[1:16:20] brings you no matter what comes it holds
[1:16:22] you it's an absolute it's something
[1:16:24] that's there that keeps you in the hour
[1:16:26] of Temptation it don't mean you'll never
[1:16:28] make a mistake because you realize your
[1:16:30] body and your spirit are never
[1:16:34] saved do you know that yeah we talk
[1:16:37] about the flesh we mean the body the
[1:16:40] flesh realm the outside literal flesh
[1:16:41] realm and the spirit realm but the soul
[1:16:44] is
[1:16:46] saved right you said well my body's
[1:16:48] saved I don't know what you're talking
[1:16:49] about well you'll never get sick
[1:16:52] then right well my spirit saved well
[1:16:56] you'll never have a bad attitude
[1:17:00] then right we all have bad attitudes
[1:17:02] don't we you kids your your parents you
[1:17:04] believe they got the Holy Ghost your
[1:17:05] parents got the Holy Ghost many of them
[1:17:08] now look you well I don't know about my
[1:17:09] parents but we'll we'll leave
[1:17:11] that huh your parents have the baptism
[1:17:13] of the Holy Ghost and they have bad
[1:17:14] attitudes sometimes don't
[1:17:17] they my daughter's nodding she's the
[1:17:19] only
[1:17:21] one what is that that's the outside man
[1:17:25] that's the flesh you got to keep under
[1:17:26] your body bring it into subjection but
[1:17:28] there's something that controls that I
[1:17:29] don't beat I don't beat my kids and
[1:17:31] abuse them and I don't I don't go around
[1:17:33] I don't go around running around doing
[1:17:35] things that I shouldn't do why there's
[1:17:37] something on the
[1:17:38] inside inside teacher do I make mistakes
[1:17:42] absolutely but there's something that
[1:17:43] controls that don't let me live that way
[1:17:46] makes me apologize when I do have a bad
[1:17:49] attitude I apologize a lot
[1:17:56] are you with
[1:17:58] me look at your life are you coming from
[1:18:02] from an infant to to maturity or you
[1:18:05] still just laying there as a
[1:18:07] baby it's evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:09] that the inside teacher he's perfecting
[1:18:12] it he's growing it he's you're saying
[1:18:15] Amen to the word and as you do as you
[1:18:17] receive the word you become the
[1:18:19] word
[1:18:21] amen now look what what do you say in
[1:18:24] revelation 22 he that hath an ear let
[1:18:27] him hear what the spirit saith to the
[1:18:28] churches he that can be taught he that
[1:18:31] has a spiritual ear now listen brother B
[1:18:34] said now you can begin to see why
[1:18:35] tongues is not the evidence of being
[1:18:36] baptized with the Holy Ghost it doesn't
[1:18:37] say in any age he that hath a tongue let
[1:18:40] him say what the spirit is saying he
[1:18:43] said that puts tongues interpretation
[1:18:44] thereof in Prophecy Etc aside as an
[1:18:46] Evidence the evidence is hearing what
[1:18:49] the spirit says the spirit is talking
[1:18:52] yes the spirit is teaching as the
[1:18:54] exactly what Jesus said he would do when
[1:18:56] he came John 14:26 he will teach you all
[1:18:58] things and bring all things to your
[1:19:00] remembrance whatsoever I have said unto
[1:19:01] you again I don't have time to read all
[1:19:03] of this you can go and read some of when
[1:19:05] you get home but he said he told us the
[1:19:06] evidence or what would happen after
[1:19:08] being baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[1:19:09] that we would have the teacher come and
[1:19:11] teach all
[1:19:13] truth but that teacher was an inside
[1:19:16] teacher not an out wouldn't it been
[1:19:18] great when you were in school to have an
[1:19:19] inside
[1:19:21] teacher that had been pretty good
[1:19:23] wouldn't it
[1:19:25] huh there this teacher out here teaching
[1:19:27] you and you this one in here says here
[1:19:29] I'll tell you how to do calculus you
[1:19:32] know got that one wouldn't that have
[1:19:35] been great that's what you have when you
[1:19:37] have the Holy Ghost right the outside
[1:19:39] teacher can say all these things that we
[1:19:42] say the inside teacher is what teaches
[1:19:44] you those things are true yeah that's
[1:19:46] that's right that's right feed on it
[1:19:49] believe it become it oh my oh my people
[1:19:53] that are always offended at the message
[1:19:56] is there is the inside teacher there are
[1:19:58] you with me now if you're always just
[1:20:00] brother Brown's always saying things
[1:20:01] that offend
[1:20:04] you see the word come to the prophet and
[1:20:08] the inside teacher agrees with the
[1:20:12] word that was
[1:20:14] free now look that teacher was an inside
[1:20:18] teacher not an outside teacher if the
[1:20:19] spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear
[1:20:20] the truth and receive it by Revelation
[1:20:22] if you heard it every moment of the
[1:20:24] today that's why I say it's tapes are
[1:20:26] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost it
[1:20:29] can't be because he said if you heard it
[1:20:31] every moment of the day if you didn't
[1:20:32] have an inside teacher you wouldn't
[1:20:34] receive
[1:20:35] it that was the sign of the indwelling
[1:20:38] spirit in the days of Paul those who
[1:20:39] were filled with the Holy Ghost heard
[1:20:40] the word received it and lived by it
[1:20:42] those who did not have the spirit heard
[1:20:44] it only as carnal men put a wrong
[1:20:45] interpretation on it and went into sin
[1:20:48] in every age in every age someone say
[1:20:50] every age is the age of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] for the True Believer so young young
[1:20:55] people you can say well it wasn't for an
[1:20:56] age it was past you say well they used
[1:20:58] to receive the baptism of Holy Ghost no
[1:20:59] every age is an age of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:01] for the True Believer he said I say in
[1:21:04] every age the evidence was the same
[1:21:06] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:21:07] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:21:10] took the word and taught it revealed it
[1:21:12] to them and they were of the group that
[1:21:15] heard the messenger and his message and
[1:21:16] took it and lived
[1:21:18] it there's the evidence of the Holy
[1:21:20] Ghost now
[1:21:22] look I'm closing in just a moment
[1:21:25] there was a man brother R talked about
[1:21:28] you remember the story he was he come
[1:21:30] across a piece of paper one time at a
[1:21:32] car lot that he owned and said where
[1:21:35] will you spend
[1:21:37] eternity that's a simple thing but
[1:21:40] something just clicked in his
[1:21:42] heart he said I need to know I want to
[1:21:45] know that I'm going to make it I don't
[1:21:47] know I think every one of us have that
[1:21:49] desire I
[1:21:51] still Lord I I cry all the time pray God
[1:21:54] give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost I
[1:21:57] don't think it's wrong to pray for that
[1:22:00] God I know what you've done for me I'm
[1:22:01] not doubting what you've done for me but
[1:22:02] today I need it again I need I need your
[1:22:05] power we feel that
[1:22:06] conviction well this man had never felt
[1:22:08] that before but now he felt
[1:22:10] it he it was just it was just a piece of
[1:22:15] paper where will you spend eternity and
[1:22:17] so he goes and goes to the Baptist
[1:22:19] church and they told him oh if you get
[1:22:20] baptized and come to the altar he said
[1:22:22] you'll you'll be saved and
[1:22:25] he did that and it just something was
[1:22:27] missing he just didn't know so he went
[1:22:30] to the Methodist church and they told
[1:22:32] him said if you'll if you'll get down at
[1:22:34] the altar and get really Sanctified give
[1:22:36] up everything of the world and then come
[1:22:38] up with the witness of the spirit and
[1:22:39] Shout said you'll know you have it so he
[1:22:42] did that and he said he still didn't
[1:22:45] just something was wrong he just didn't
[1:22:47] feel like he had it and so he he went to
[1:22:50] the Pentecostals the Full Gospel people
[1:22:52] and and or the Pentecostal people and
[1:22:53] they said well if you we know what's
[1:22:55] wrong you haven't spoken tongues yet
[1:22:57] that's the answer for everything in
[1:22:58] Pentecost right speaking in tongues and
[1:23:02] not to Bel that but it was I I've been
[1:23:03] in those churches and around those
[1:23:05] groups it just that's just answer to
[1:23:07] everything it's why part of the reason I
[1:23:08] was so confused as a as a child we were
[1:23:11] around a whole lot of those kind of
[1:23:12] people and so you you got trouble at
[1:23:15] work speaking tongues you know you got
[1:23:18] trouble at home speak in tongues you you
[1:23:20] don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:23:21] Spirit speak in tongues so he spoke in
[1:23:23] tongues and he still didn't like he had
[1:23:25] it so we come to the Full Gospel people
[1:23:27] and they said well we'll tell you what
[1:23:28] to do so you go to brother brandom he's
[1:23:29] a prophet he'll be able to discern your
[1:23:31] life and tell you what all happened in
[1:23:33] your life why you can't receive it
[1:23:34] because evidently there's something
[1:23:35] wrong so he come to brother brandom and
[1:23:38] he said said what brother brandom I I've
[1:23:40] done all these things what am I supposed
[1:23:42] to do how how am I supposed to know that
[1:23:46] I've got it and brother brand told him
[1:23:48] he said do you he said do you remember
[1:23:51] he even told Brother brand he said I've
[1:23:52] sold all the cars and giving the money
[1:23:55] to preachers well where are people like
[1:23:57] that I wonder
[1:24:01] sometime but brother Brandon said you
[1:24:03] didn't have to do
[1:24:05] that that's what he said you didn't have
[1:24:07] to do
[1:24:09] that he said he said you remember when
[1:24:12] you picked up that piece of paper said
[1:24:14] where will you spend
[1:24:17] eternity he said I want to know that
[1:24:19] I've got it he said remember when you
[1:24:20] picked it up where will you spend
[1:24:21] eternity he said right where you made
[1:24:23] your turn
[1:24:27] Church see if I'm going down the road
[1:24:30] how do I know that I've got the Holy
[1:24:31] Ghost because I was headed down the
[1:24:33] wrong road and I come to I come to a
[1:24:36] definite experience in my life and after
[1:24:39] that experience brother the trip I
[1:24:40] started going a different
[1:24:42] direction I've made my mistakes I've had
[1:24:44] my pitfalls I've i' I've struggled at
[1:24:46] times but I've kept going down that road
[1:24:49] something inside of me was crying out
[1:24:51] teaching me all the time something was
[1:24:53] leading me something was was guiding me
[1:24:55] and many times I was stubborn I didn't
[1:24:57] do the right things but God still led me
[1:24:59] he led me to this place brother the BR
[1:25:01] said right where you made your turn I
[1:25:02] want you to have confidence today young
[1:25:04] people where did you get it right where
[1:25:05] you made your turn if you feel that tug
[1:25:07] of God that pull of God follow that
[1:25:11] follow that presence that you feel
[1:25:12] follow until you become a new Creature
[1:25:14] if any man be in Christ he is a new
[1:25:16] creature old things are passed away
[1:25:17] behold all things have become new follow
[1:25:20] until your life proves what you are he
[1:25:22] said be not conformed to this world but
[1:25:23] be trans form by the renewing of your
[1:25:25] mind you may prove what is that good and
[1:25:27] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:25:29] follow it until
[1:25:32] then oh
[1:25:37] church I preach just as hard as I can
[1:25:40] today I know a lot of people have been
[1:25:42] gone and different things are going on
[1:25:44] and things but I just believe that
[1:25:47] there's some reason why he just been
[1:25:49] sitting on my shoulder all day just
[1:25:50] telling me tell me
[1:25:53] preach and I've been trying to preach
[1:25:55] it's the best that I
[1:25:56] can but it's got to be received by
[1:25:59] faith there's got to be something in
[1:26:01] your heart that makes you want to feed
[1:26:04] on the word makes you not because your
[1:26:07] parents do it but makes you you young
[1:26:08] people you've got an opportunity to
