evening amen if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to Philippians 2 and 5 I'd like to say it's such an honor to be here this evening I appreciate the opportunity to be ministering um I pray something can be said to be a blessing tonight it's uh also like to say it's an honor to have my wife with me sister Loretta and my my two kiddos with me Ethan and Brielle it's such a it's a blessing having them travel with you or travel with me and so it's good to have them them with me tonight uh Philippians 2 and5 the Bible would say let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even death of the Cross amen can we bow our heads tonight dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we want to say thank you for your grace and your mercy Lord giving us Health in our bodies Lord strength Lord keeping us safe throughout the day Lord as we come into your house tonight father we've sang songs of worship Lord we ask that you would inhabit the Praises of your people Lord and just come among us tonight Lord as your word would come forth I ask that you would anoint it father Lord only you can speak to the hearts and meet the needs father Lord we commit the service into your hands we ask these things in your precious name amen you may be seated and if I had a subject tonight it would be God unveiled Among Us and um it's a it be a simple thought but I pray it can can be a blessing and a help in some way but um the Bible would tell us that the the mystery of God should be finished and I believe that the understanding of who God is has been poured out in this generation where God has no longer veiled but all the veils that has hid God has been loosed and you know brother Brandon he would preach two messages God unveiled Among Us and the Mighty God unveiled Among Us and they their powerful messages but in those messages he would talk about a king that wanted to know his people more but he didn't want to just know his people more but he wanted his people to know him more and I like how brother Brandon would say it he would this king would go before his delegates go before the council the courts and would say you're not going to see me for some time and they would ask him where are you going to go are you going to go to this country are you going to go to this place and he would say no I'm going to stay right here but I'm going to change my form and they would ask him what are you going to do he he would say I'm taking off my Royal garments I'm going to take on the garments of a peasant and I'm going to go cut the wood with the wood Chopper I'm going to go prune the prune the vines with the pruners I'm going to till the ground with the tillers I I'm going to to take on another form in order to know my people more then brother Brandon would say the super Supernatural God changed into a natural man God wanted to know his people more and so the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 4 and 15 for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we are yet without sin so God wanted to know his people more so he would change his form he would take on the form of humanity and would experience the pains that you would experience he would experience the dis the disappointment the discouragements everything that you would go through he would go through as well and yet would be without sin he would he would experience the grief of losing a friend at the tomb of Lazarus that he would weep he would experience weariness and body whenever he was on the boat on the in the ocean and when he would get tired and would rest he would know what it was like for you to get weary and body but yet would overcome it he would know what it was like to experience so s will In The Garden of Gethsemane and there he would cry out father if it if it be let this cup pass from me he was in the form of a man going through the same pains going through the same the same weaknesses and he would experience the same self-will that you had experienced and that's encouraging to me CU I know sometimes it's hard to press on sometimes it's hard to die to yourself and to take on the word but it's encouraging to know that God in the form of man would go through the same self-will and would fight the flesh that I don't want to go through this I don't want to do this but nevertheless not my will but thy will be done and it's encouraging to know in a flawed human vessel like myself like yourself that you can do the same thing he took on the for to let you know I know what you're going through but you can also know how I overcome it you can also know that you can remain sinless and spotless in a day of perversion you see he would also know what it was like to lose a good friend whenever uh whenever Judas would turn against him he was in the form of man taking on the pain so that you could know what that he could know what it was like if you had friends turn against you that you would have best friends that you would lose them and they would turn again he was taking on the form so that he could intercede for you you know could you imagine having a pastor you know brother Ben if he never went through trials if he never went through Hard Times how could you come and talk to him and say brother Ben I how did you overcome this H how are you doing this if you never went through it you see but it's a it's a pastor that has been through some things that he could give advice I did this God brought me through this and that's the way God was he come in the form of man to experience the self-will to experience the pain of losing a friend to experience the pain of having a best friend turn against him so that he could intercede for you and come down in the midst of the circumstance and be a friend that's closer than a brother closer than a brother the brother that's turned against you the friend that turned against you he would know what it was like so that he could come and and and encourage you and comfort you you see but he didn't just want to know what you would go through but he wanted to unveil himself so that you can see him and brother Brandon would tell us that whenever he was upon the cross he says The Mercy Seat was in plain view because the veil was rent from top to bottom and he says there stood The Mercy Seat in plain view for all to see and brother Brandon would ask the question he would say why did he rent The Veil because he wanted you to see The Mercy Seat he wanted you to see who he was and so when he took the form of man he didn't want just to see you he wanted you to see him but brother Brandon would tell us that it was the same God made flesh and was dwelt among us but Brandon would saying now the the same godess in the Holy Ghost the Father the Son the Hol not three Gods three offices three acts of one God and we see but the Brandon would tell us that there stood The Mercy Seat but many of the people were blinded and it really it really struck me whenever I was studying on these things why were they blinded because they were stuck in a form you know here stood reality Jesus wasn't a form he was reality he wasn't a shadow he was reality all the forms and shadows was pointing to reality you know whenever they would come to the to the Tabernacle it would slay a lamb the blood will pour out pour out upon them that was just a shadow that was just a type it was just a tradition there was no power to it to forgive sins or or to divorce sins so if they would come with the nature of sin and would the blood of the Lamb would cover uh sin of lying or the sin of blaspheming or the sin uh uh evil thought it would cover the sin but it would not divorce the sin so there was no reality to it and so whenever Christ come his blood wasn't to just cover the sins it was to divorce the sin and there would stand The Mercy Seat in plain view for all to see but because of the form they could not recognize him and oh my many times we can come to church and we live in a form we live in a shadow we live in a tradition of just coming to church on the midweek just coming to church on a Sunday morning just coming to church on a Sunday night that we live in a shadow and here stands reality you see God don't want us living in a shadow he want us living in reality he didn't want just the blood of bulls and goats to push past the sin he wanted the blood of himself to divorce the sin where we can stand in Victory and I think it's so amazing that Jesus would look at him and would say your father's Aid of the Mana and the Wilderness and every one of them dead but I am the bread of life he was saying they had a type that had no reality to it they died they drank of the water that come out of the Rock and they are dead but on the Fountain of Living Water he come and brought reality everything that the Old Testament was pointing to here stood the reality oh my brother Brandon would say redemption was in Jesus not in Moses it wasn't in Abraham he all them was pointing to something and when Christ come everything they pointed to was right in front of them and I think M we have went through seven Church ages we went through Luther we went through Wesley we've been through Pentecost they have all been pointing to something but here we stand in the fullness of the word we're not living in a shadow we're not just living in justification we're not just living in sanctification we're not just living in the day of the restoration of the gifts but the restoration of the word has been revealed in this generation that has brought the fullness of the word but not just the word but the but the realities of the word the presence of God has been revealed to us just like it was when Jesus was walking upon the Earth the same presence is walking upon the Earth today it's Healing The Sick it's saving the lost and one day it's going to change our bodies it ain't just a fiction it ain't just an imagination it's the realities of the word that has been brought to us in this generation oh hallelujah it's a reflection of what God is but a reflection has to take on a form you see reflection you know if you have a light the light has the power to be a reflection but in order to be a reflection something has to get up to it and then you can see a reflection of it a mirror is a reflection but you see an order to be a reflection you got to get in line with it and once you get in line with it you can see what the reflection is and this word is to reflect itself through our through our vessels brother Brandon would say we are written Epistles read and known of all men he would say it's not it's not new epistle not new words written it's taken up the words that has been written and is coming inside of our life brother Brandon he would talk about Peter and John he would say Peter and John they looked at him and and perceived that they were ignorant and unlearned men but they had a they had a come up with the conclusion that they had been with Jesus but the B says they were written Epistles they were reflections of what the word was and I say Lord let me be that in this generation whenever I'm at work whenever I'm at school wherever I am at let me take the word that the world can look upon my life and say that is a written epistle he ain't just living a life but he's living a life of the Gospel let me be that in this generation but you see brother Brandon he would tell that the word would be would be be would would be tradition ised it would be uh it would be created over he would say whenever the word would go to NAA Rome it would then be denominated and it would be veiled up once again but it was promised in this generation by an evening time message that it would be loosed and unveiled again in this generation brother Brandon would tell us that uh the the the the Holy Ghost would be bound by the denominational Rivers but it's to be loose in this generation so just like God would unveil himself whenever he was upon Earth in the form of Jesus he's upon Earth again today unveiling himself loosing all of the Creeds all of the Traditions all of man's ideas so that we can see him in the fullness and brother Brandon would say this I see him the Mighty God unveiled I see him pull back the Creeds the the denominations pull back the Skeptics the educational programs everything walk forward and stand there and he says you think the Creeds could conquer him you think the denominations could conquer him you think the World Council can conquer him he conquered everything broke every feather rip open hell tore off the to tore off the seal entered into the holiest of holies unveiled himself to us being the word oh my so he unveiled himself to us being the word that's why we needed a message to tear open the seals so that we can see God in this generation in the form of his word you see brother Brandon would say it's all revealed in there the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was and that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of the word it was the it won't leave the word it's and God's spirit will never leave that word and so if the Holy Ghost was bound by traditional rivers and would be loosed in this generation the only way it could be loosed would be by a perfect word and brother brandom says the Holy Ghost is with the word and the Seven Seals would re reveal that to us that the Holy Ghost is still in the word oh that's why we don't believe in a dead letter that's why we don't believe in just Traditions that's why we don't believe in just coming the church but this message has revealed to us that the same holy ghost that the apostles received is the same holy ghost that our young people can receive the same Revival that started in the book of Acts is the same Revival that is going on today oh Hallelujah you see and it it took God unveiling himself in order for us to see it and brother Brandon would talk about a violin he would say an Auctioneer would say what am I offered for this violin and brother Brandon would say they wouldn't know what was there and so one would say $1 $5 $10 $15 and brother the Brandon would say there was a man in the midst that didn't think it should be sold for that little so what he would do is he would pick up the bow tighten up the bow pick up the violin and would start to play a tune you see he didn't magically make something appear but he knew what was veiled there oh my brother Brandon would see everybody started to cry because they had never heard such beautiful music and then the auctioneer would look at him and would say now what am I offered one would say uh 5,000 10,000 15,000 and brother Brandon would say what made the difference the Master's Hand revealed what was hidden there oh Hallelujah he didn't bring something new he just unveiled what was already hidden there oh my and God in this generation has come on the scene the mighty Angel come with an open book in hand he had come with an open book to unveil what was hidden there all alone your rapture was hidden there your body change was hidden there your future home was hidden there your victory was hidden there your name was hidden there but it was held up but the Master's Hand in this generation would unveil the book so that you can see what God really is you can see the promises that he has for you in this generation oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say this so now in this age when the old denominational and traditional veil has been rent from the word of God so it can be manifested you see what I mean the tradition says all of those things are passed let it soak in a little bit these things are passed but in the last day the traditional veil has been rinsed apart and here stands the pillar of fire see here he is manifesting the word for this day the veil has been rant so brother Brandon would say the purpose of the veil being rented was for the word to be manifested oh my so what's going to manifest the word but the Brandon would say behind the veil was the sh Glory was the pillar of fire manifesting the word and so that takes all the pressure off of you and I of trying to manifest the word it takes the pressure off of young people trying to be good Christians because once God is unveiled to you there stands the pillar of fire oh come on now there stands the sh of Glory manifesting the word and so if the Holy Ghost can ever come on the inside you don't have to worry about trying to make the word live the word will live itself inside of your life oh my but you see the Bible or brother Brandon would tell us that uh wherever the word is it is always veiled he would say it's unveiled to the bride but it stays veiled to the unbelievers and he would say it's always been a flesh fail he would talk about the drama and would say one actor can have many different masks but it's the same person many different masks he talks about whenever his girl was in the in the high school play I believe he would say there was one individual that would come out with one mask then would go behind the curtain it would come out with a different mask he says it was the same person but had many different masks and he talks about the word he says the word has had many different veils he would talk about how the word was veiled behind Moses and he says Moses was the Living Word to the people because it was veiled behind him and I thought my that is powerful under the blood of bulls and goats he was still The Living Word to the people what about today oh we've got the Shak Glory veiled Among Us what about today it's the Living Word in manifestation inside of Flesh once again and he would talk about how he was veiled in the prophets he would be veiled through through the prophets of the Old Testament and then he would be veiled behind Jesus he was many different masks but all the same God and then he would talk about he would talk about the Tabernacle and I think it's so incredible because he said behind the badger skins was the Shak Glory but one once it was a badger behind those skins but now it's the housing place for the glory of God and then he would stop and would say so can your skins be changed into the housing place for the glory of God so just like God was veiled in Moses just like God was veiled in the prophets veiled in Jesus veiled behind the behind the badger skins he's taken on another veil in this generation another mask in this generation and brother Brandon would say changes his mask but never his word and never his nature so the same nature that was that would come with the word inside of Moses that would cause him to turn water in blood it would cause lies to be spoken into existence was the same anointing that would be behind the Bader skins that would take a dead Rod that was dead that would make a blossom again oh Hallelujah it was the same anointing that would be with Jesus when he was in the Tomb that would cause him to raise again and it's the same anointing that has been loosed in this generation that can come inside of a vessel and take somebody that is dead in sins dead in trespasses dead in their iniquities and make their life blossom with the sweet perfume of the word oh he's taking on a different Veil but you see brother Brandon would say that uh when when when God said or when the Bible says in Joel that I will pour out in the last days my spirit but the brandom says he would empty himself not just pour from himself but pour himself and he says now when it was said here that he emptied himself or poured it out now we think of it like this that he would vomit up the English word of emptied or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him but the word kenos in the Greek does not mean that he vomit up his arm went off or his eye went out or another person that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out from him called the Holy Spirit but he but it was him himself you get it he poured himself into the people Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God pouring himself into human beings into the believer pour out it was a part of his drama oh Hallelujah so he didn't pour from himself he poured himself but the brand would say all that was in God he poured in the Christ all that was in Christ he would pour into the believer and he would say in another place but the Brandon would say it's not God coming with men it's God coming in men and I say Lord let me be a reflection of what this word really is you know brother Brandon would talk about would talk about Adam and Eve he would say that when Adam was created in the beginning he was to be a reflection and he wanted to master a masterpiece family and so what he would do is he would take something from Adam not another individual he didn't create another Masterpiece but he took from the original Masterpiece and created something and he would say so was it when Jesus he created another Masterpiece after Adam was flawed after Adam was broken he would see created another Masterpiece but then he would strike Jesus upon the cross and out of Jesus would come another Masterpiece it was to be a reflection of what Jesus was just like Jesus was word made flesh when the Bride come from him it was word made flesh once again I say Lord here are are standing upon Earth we're walking upon Earth but we're living in another atmosphere we're living in another dimension we're living in a spirit world where all things are possible we're living in a dimension where we can believe for the sick to be healed for the prodical to come hope that's why you can't you can't give up on your practical you can't give up on your lost loved ones we're living in an hour where all things are possible oh we're not just living in a type of a shadow but we're living in the realities where we can believe for our sons to come home we can believe for our daughters to come home oh Hallelujah but you see many times that we still keep God veiled you know brother Brandon would say this I'm telling you when you break the traditional Veil that Jesus is way back and he is that now when you find he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no limit to what God God can do right here in this convention and show this world that they need not a world fair not a World Revival but they be filled with the presence of the Living God IM maray and veiling himself into human flesh Hallelujah I believe it broken every barrier broken every Veil every Veil nothing can hide his presence when people get hungry in the heart there's a veil ready to be broke and so he's saying here there can be many different veils but if you get hungry enough to see the realities of his presence there's a veil that's ready to be broke you may say brother Joshua and the message we're not we're not living under a Creed or an idea but we can still have veils of complexes we can still have veils of insecurities we can have veils where I'm not good enough I'm not worthy of a nobody likes me we can have veils of discouragement we can have veils of bitterness all of these veils can keep us from seeing the reality and put us in a shadow but brother Brandon would say if you get hungry enough there's a veil that's ready to be broken oh my let us get hungry enough that we can look at our brother and forgive him we can throw out the bitterness let us get hungry enough that we can fight past complexes let us get hungry enough that we can throw out insecurities and think the thoughts that God has for us you know God has good thoughts of you but you got to believe those thoughts you know the B would tell us about Gideon remember Gideon the Bible would say that the angel would come to him with a message and would say you're a mighty man of Valor and what was the first thing that Gideon would say to him I am poor I'm I'm from a poor family I'm the least in my father's house and you know what what one of the definitions of Valor is is wealthy and here come a message saying that you are wealthy but his confession was I am poor he had to line himself up with what the word was saying and you've got to line yourself up with what the word says you are the devil can come and say you're not good enough you're not good for nothing you're never Mount to anything but the word of God is saying I'm coming to be veiled inside of your skins I'm coming to be manifested inside of your life you're my living Oracle upon the Earth today but you got to get past all those veils because always behind the veil is always the presence of God come on now the devil when to fight you if there was nothing to obtain but the reason he fights you with complexes was because there's a reality for him the reason he fights you with bitterness because he's trying to keep you from obtaining something but let's realize recognize that the devil's against us you know brother Brandon will preach a message how can I overcome and he says to overcome you got to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks you got to recognize him as real you got to recognize that he's against you and you know that really Str me brother Ben you don't just have to recognize that he's real but you got to recognize he's against you because if you fail to recognize that he's against you you're going to entertain him oh I'm preaching now you will entertain bitterness and fail to recognize that it's a veil keeping you from seeing a Revival you entertain complexes and fail to realize that it's a veil keeping you from from a Revival inside of your marriage a Revival inside of your children a Revival inside of your home but if you recognize that he's real and that he's against you then brother brandom goes on and he says then you got to recognize that the god that is in you is greater than the power that's in the enemy so you got to recognize that he's real recognize that he's against you but then you got to recognize that the god that has been unveiled in this generation is greater than every every complex greater than every bitterness greater than every insecurity and once you recognize that then you can break through a veil where you can s into the heavenlies where the devil don't know what to do with you but the brand would tell that that a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him I think that's for a teenager that's for a housewife that's for a daddy it ain't just for the pastor it ain't just for the deacons it's for everybody that is hungry enough to fight past the bails to fight past the bitterness the fight past the Cor to s to the realities of Jesus Christ oh my because if you don't recognize it then you start to justifying it hope this okay tonight if you don't realize that something's against you you'll start justifying it you start to you oh you don't know what I've been through brother the Josh you don't know what that brother said to me you're justifying the spirit and the spirit is keeping a Revival from your children come on now many people don't understand why they're their children children can't break through the presence of God what are the veils are you putting in front of them come on now you can't expect I hope this is okay you can't expect to tear down the pastor and the pastor help your children you can't expect to tear down the ministry and the ministry help your children you're building up barriers I'm preaching now you're building up veils that you're keeping a Revival from it but I say let's let's create another atmosphere inside of our homes let's break through every Veil you know I was doing some work on my house I was remodeling my house and just give some a word of advice don't ever remodel a house if you're living in it that was the worst idea that my wife ever had but anyway but anyways that here I I was coming to the last stage of the house I was uh I was doing the tile I don't know if anybody's ever done tile work before it's no fun at all and here I was coming to the grouting part of it I was starting to grout the towel you know and I had my sponge I had my bucket I was starting to clean the tiw had water in the bucket you know and every time I would clean the tile it would still be dirty and it was really getting me aggravated I would clean the towel it would be dirty I would clean the tole and I was getting mad at my sponge and I thought my goodness the sponge is supposed to be cleaning the towel off and something struck me as I was going outside it wasn't the spong's fault it wasn't the water's fault it wasn't the bucket's fault it was my fault because I when I dump out the water it was dirty water and so the sponge was just soaking up the environment that I was putting it into oh I'm preaching now and children are sponges they soak up your bitterness they soak up your insecurities they soak up the gossip they soak up these things and then that's what they're going to produce the sponge was just making what he was around him dirty because of the environment I was putting him in so what I had to do was empty up the bucket of water and put a new environment in it oh create in me Lord a clean heart renew a right Spirit within me a Revival starts with parents a Revival starts with the elders a Revival starts with the deacons the Revival starts with the ministry then watch a Revival strike through the young people watch the Revival strike through rebellious teenagers it's putting in them putting them in a right atmosphere for God to be unveiled to them oh Hallelujah that's what we want in this generation there some young people that is on fire with the things of God not on fire with the things of the world not on fire with the things on Facebook but let them be on fire with this message where they can quote this message they can live this message they can act out this message oh Hallelujah this message ain't just an Elder's message it's a Young Person's message come on now it's young people that's going to make a Rapture it's young people that is going to reain in the Millennium it's young people that is going to live an overcoming life Hallelujah but you see nothing can hide his presence when people get hungry in their heart there's a veil that's when that is ready to be broken and we see that God would unveil himself to be veiled but before he can be veiled in humanity he had to unveil himself to humanity and so we would see the God would come to the Fallen human meanss not the ones that would have perfect lives God wouldn't go to the high priest Jesus wouldn't go to the high priest he would go to the prostitutes he would go to the tax collectors he would go to Peter that couldn't even sign his own name he would come to the ordinary to make them great you know brother Brandon would preach a message called the super side and he says they're making everything super we're living in a day of super this super that he says they got super highways it used to take I think it said eight days to get from the East to the west but now it takes four days and he would said it's because it went from two lane highways to four lane highways they've got super highways now he says they got supercars that once would go 55 mes an hour no they're going 75 they got supermarkets he says by making something super they're doing away with the ordinary and you know that really struck me that before they can make something super they got to do away with the ordinary and that's what Hitler would do he wanted the super race and so anybody that had a blemish he would do away with him anybody that didn't line up to what he thought was super he would do away with him but we see his kingdom would crash down but that's not the way God is working God ain't coming to the ones that are super to do away with the ordinary he's picking up the ordinary oh Hallelujah he's picking up the ordinary housewife that has to that gets tired and weary and body for taking care of the children he's taking that ordinary person and making a Powerhouse out of him he's taking an ordinary daddy brother Brandon would say that he's taking the ordinary daddy that would have a lunch under his arm and will go to work he's taking that person to make a super make a super race out of him it's taking an ordinary young person and making a Powerhouse out of him God ain't doing away with the ordinary he's picking up the ordinary and raing himself inside of their skins brother Brandon would say now here is men fishermen Tax Collectors little humble women just ordinary Housewives little virgin girls they were believers they were believing that this was the truth just ordinary Housewives oh man you know sometimes the housewives feel feel left down that the Daddy's got the calling you know he might be a deacon might be a preacher might be a song leader or he might be just a solid man and the Daddy's still left out you know but you notice that it was it was jocked I believe that would save Moses and brother Brandon would say that it was jocked that was that that that was praying for God to send a deliverer then God would give a deliverer it was juned that was created a place for Moses to be saved it was a little mother that had a purpose and a calling upon her life to produce a super race and I think if parents would ever get a get a revelation that their calling upon Earth is greater than what they think it is the devil likes to come and put mind battles on you that you're no good for nothing that you've got no purpose that the God don't need you that's a lie from the pits of hell because sitting right beside you is miniature Gods sitting right beside you but you're raising up is miniature Gods the God is raising up in this generation we've got a purpose upon earth that is greater than what the devil tells us oh Hallelujah but you see brother Brandon mer say this God hides himself and simple little washwoman or ordinary men with dinner under his arms kisss his wife and children goodbye and go out there maybe hide himself in that man to do something that an Archbishop would know nothing about you see you don't blow no you don't blow no horns or send it out God just gets the glory that's all the simple hear it hand or glad you see but what makes what makes these Ordinary People candidates for deity to come inside because they were empty you know we were broken I'm sure we all got testimonies that we can testify that we was broken you was hurt you were scarred you were crushed but that there put you in a position for deity to come and placed himself inside of you you know cuz the Bible would tell us of the widow woman and Elisha that her sons are about to be sold as slaves you'll remember the story in the Bible and the Bible would say that Elisha would come to her and say do you have any oil and she would say I've just got a little bit of oil in this course in this jar and she the Bible would say that he would tell her go far and abroad and get all of the empty vessels not the half empty not the 3/4 empty but get empty vessels and we know what would happen she would go out and get all of the empty vessels and would bring those empty vessels to the prophet and the prophet would take that little jar of oil and will begin to pour inside of those empty vessels and what is so incredible is he never ran out of oil he's going to run out after the first jar he's going to run out after the second jar but as all as many as empty vessels were called he had enough to fill it oh my but they had to be empty God had you had to get you empty that's why you had to go through a heartbreak maybe you had to go through discouragement maybe you had to be crushed where you couldn't get back up but then deity would come and pick you up and would say I needed you Broken Hallelujah I needed you empty I needed you crushed so that I can put you back together you had to be empty and God going to run out of himself with the 120 in the upper room but if there's still empty vessels that God is calling he's still pouring deity inside of those vessels and veiling himself inside of your skins oh Hallelujah that's God living inside of humanity Humanity with Fallen with W with with with Fall Fallen nature or with human human weaknesses human desires and here comes Humanity living inside of it and brother Brandon would say this here the Shak of Glory manifests him it brings forth the Word of Promise right out to you that's the reason that he had to Veil Moses face because in him was the word he veiled Jesus as a humble little man to keep them from saying Jehovah and he veils himself today in Earth and vessels with the shik glory the outside looks like a bunch of holy rollers and old Badger skin but the inside hides the shika Glory the outside still looks like Fallen Humanity but on the inside is deity living inside of those skin and brother the Brandon would say that it's the it's the skins that blinds many people and you know sometimes it's our own skins the blinds what God is doing in our own lives we know what we used to do we know the things we used to talk about we know the things we used to look at and that skin blinds us from and avails us from God coming and living inside of it but brother Brandon would say that you can look at skin and would say I know what she used to do I know what he used to do but ROM say but what about now what's veiled in those skins now and I say the same thing for you don't let condemnation Veil you from seeing the presence of God in manifestation today I don't care what you did yesterday 10 years ago what is God doing today you see cu the accuser would like to come and accuse you of things you used to do but what about today you know the accuser H has no authority to bring you down unless you him to he has no authority to bring you down unless you listen to him you know cuz the Bible would tell us that the accuser the that accuse the Brethren day and night has been cast down he has been cast down but we have to overcome him the Bible says we Overcoming By the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony and I love that because our testimony is greater than the accusation oh come on now the testimony of what God is doing today is greater than the accusation of yesterday oh come on now the devil knows that he can't get you but he will come and accus you of things you used to do to try to Veil you up from seeing a Revival you know the Bible would tell us about Daniel and Daniel the Bible says he was accused and he was accused and thrown unto the Lion's Den and then the king would come and would say Daniel was your God able to deliver you and he would say yes he sent his angel that would steal the lion mouth and before him was innocency found in me so the testimony of Daniel was greater than the accusation of the accuser oh in the midst of the accusation before God he stood innocent and I say in the midst of the accusation before God you stand innocent God don't see a spot he don't see a blemish all he sees is the blood of Jesus that covers and divorces sins don't let the accuser Veil you up from seeing the presence of God maybe you say brother Josh I'm fighting with condemnation the Bible would tell us about the three Hebrew boys and the Bible says that that the that these accusers would accuse the Jews certain Jews so it wasn't just the entire nation but it was inside of this nation were certain Jews he didn't go the accusers didn't go to the ones that were bowing he only come to the ones that were certain oh oh Hallelujah and if the devil's fighting you it's because you're certain you're certain in whom you have believed he's not after the make Believers he's not after the unbelievers he's after the ones that are certain and the Bible would say that they would accuse him and you know that they got thrown into the fiery furnace and what is so incredible about the story is the Bible would say the king looked and says didn't we throw three men bound into the midst of the fire below there's four men Loos oh in the midst of the accusation God would unveil himself and when God would unveil himself it would set them free from the accusation so the very accusation that would keep them bound when God unveiled himself they would become loose oh when God has come in the midst in this generation to cut you loose from every accusation to cut you loose from every condemnation so that you can see God veiled in your skins you know the Bible would tell us about the woman that was caught in the act of adultery y'all remember that story and the Bible would say that they throw this threw this woman at the feet of Jesus that they might accuse him you know but he was spotless even pilot would say I find no Faults in him and here he was the perfect Lamb of God nothing to accuse and so they couldn't accuse him but then they move on to the lady you know so they said this woman was caught in the act of adultery and we know what the Bible says Jesus stooped down and would start to write in the say and he looked up and he says woman where were thine accusers have no man condemn thee and she would say lord they're all gone and here was Jesus nothing to accuse nothing to condemn a perfect state but he didn't come just for him to be perfect he come the Fallen humanity and this Perfection that he would bestow in himself he would then give to a woman that was flawed oh Hallelujah it would say neither do I condemn thee go and S no more he wasn't just happy with him being perfect but he come to somebody that was in humanity and not perfect and would give her Perfection oh when God has given perfection in this generation when the accuser is thrown to the to the to the to the Lake of Fire you're going to remain you know that the accuser has a time limit that he is upon but you have eternity waiting on you you know that after Daniel was brought out of the Lion's the king would say go get the accusers and throw them into the lion's den so while Daniel was still walking and still had had eternity waiting on him the accusers had come to their time limit oh come on now and whenever you are reigning in the Millennium for eternity when you're living eternally they're the accusers it's going to be thrown into the Lake of Fire they've got a time limit that's why the devil is after you cuz he knows that what is end is and he knows what your future is and he tries to keep God veiled to you but I say let's not be veiled up by the things of the world let's not be veiled up by the accusation but let the presence of God Flow Free freely in every one of our lives in her home in our churches in her family let the presence of God flow freely oh Hallelujah brother Brandon want talk about the woman at the well and he said because she was redeemable whenever he whenever she recognized Jesus Jesus have brought her back to the image and I think that is so incredible her recognizing God unveiled would bring open up a channel that would bring her back to the image that God had from before the foundation of the world when God seen this woman up the well in his mind it wasn't her being condemned that's right it wasn't her in sin he seen Perfection and here he would come and unveil himself and whenever she would recognize him they would bring that image from the mind of God in the human flesh oh my here God has unveiled himself and brother brandom says that not everybody can see it can see what God is doing but the ones that was in the mind of God and the ones that were in the mind of God can see it oh and just like the woman up the well since she was redeemable this Perfection could be bestowed upon her let her musicians come and since we were redeemable we were in the mind of God there's a Perfection that can be bestowed upon us yes sir and you see the devil will try to do everything he can do to destroy your certainty he knows he can't take away deity from you but he can try to destroy your certainty and you know the Bible would tell us would tell us about uh job and I think it's so incredible that the Bible would tell us in job 1:1 there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and a pride and one that feared God and shoot evil and so this was job's life upon the Earth now this is what God is saying in heaven job 1:8 and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there was none like him in all the Earth the perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and ass sheth evil sir I don't think it's a coincidence that the life that job is living is matching up with God's testimony yeah you know it was somebody coming in contact and living out what God had for him and it was because of this that the accuser but didn't come to job and we know that his family was taken away he his LifeLock was taken away his servants was taken away it was the accuser of trying to destroy him but you notice what happens next it was his best friends and this is really really struck me his best friends would come to him and say you're a secret Sinner and job knew he wasn't a secret sinner because of his atonement but if the accuser could get him to doubt his atonement then all of his sins would be on his shoulders oh come on now then it would go off of his atonement upon his works and that's what the accuser was trying to do to job you're a secret sinner you had have done something you done this you done that but the Bible says in all of this job sin not nor charge God foolishly in the midst of the accusation he never lost his certainty in the atonement oh don't lose your certainty in this message you know and another thing that really stood out to me was the Bible would say that job would offer a sacrifice for his children youall remember that he says and pre-venture that they would that they would sin or do this when they were at the party he would slay a lamb and do a and do a sacrifice you know if if the accuser could get him to doubt his own atonement what hope would he have for his children you know as a father that really stood out to me if job would have lost the confidence for his own atonement what hope would he have of seeing his children what hope would he have of seeing these things again and if you ever lose your confidence in this message what hope do you have for the Next Generation come on and we're living in a perverted World we're living in a day where boys don't know if they're boys if they're girls they don't they're identifying as cats there's no certainty in this world but if the accuser could ever get you to lose the certainty of this message there's no hope for it then you're trying to whether Brandon would tell a story of the boy that was that was condemned in court he was sentenced of life in prison and brother the brandom says the boy will look and say Hey I want to be judged by my record and the judge will look at him and said it's your record that got you here you know and it's our record that gets us condemned but it's the certainty of our atonement that is redeeming us it's the certainty it's a fallen nature it's Fallen Humanity that has got us in this position right now where boys don't know if they're boys or cats or girls but it's this message that is redeeming us back to the mind of God you cannot lose the certainty of it parents you can't lose the certainty of your children making a Rapture you can't lose the certainty of seeing loved ones in the resurrection you can't lose the certainty of the Holy Ghost saving your children you can't lose the certainty of it but it's the accuser that tries to get you to throw your certainty away and compromise but this ain't the time to compromise this is the time to stand this ain't the time to give up this is the time to fight this ain't the time to give in this is the time to live in this revival get inside of this message get our children inside of this message show them what God is doing in this generation so that God can be unveiled to them than Lord oh man as a parent you know and and I'm a young parent but if I fail to get my children of Jesus Christ I miss my calling as a parent and I'm sure everyone every parent can say that you know if I fail to get my children of God I miss my calling but we don't got to fail come on it was joob that was some doing a sacrifice even in the midst of the accusation I know my children are going to be saved I know my redeemer liveth and at that day in my flesh I'm going to see God the lord giveth but the lord taketh away blessed be the holy name in the midst of the accusation he never lost his certainty oh Church don't lose your certainty tonight amen goe and sing thank you Lord [Music] oh can we stand and sing this tonight hallelujah it's PR the Lord the Battle
