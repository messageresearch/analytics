[49:49] it says ahaziah the son of Ahab began to
[49:52] Reign Over Israel in Samaria the 17th
[49:55] year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah and
[49:58] reigned two years over Israel
[50:00] and he did evil in the sight of the Lord
[50:03] he walked in the way of his father in
[50:05] the way of his mother and in the way of
[50:07] jeroboam the son of nibat who made
[50:09] Israel to sin
[50:11] for he served Baal and worshiped him and
[50:13] provoked to anger the Lord God of Israel
[50:16] according to all that his father had
[50:19] done
[50:20] sobering words isn't it according to all
[50:23] that his father had done
[50:25] and then II kings 1 and 1 continues on
[50:28] says then Moab rebelled against Israel
[50:31] after the death of Ahab
[50:33] and ahaziah fell down through a lattice
[50:36] in his upper chamber that was in Samaria
[50:38] and was sick
[50:40] and he sent Messengers and said unto
[50:42] them go inquire of belzebub the god of
[50:46] ekron whether I shall recover
[50:49] of this disease for the Lord would add
[50:52] his Blessing to the word this morning
[50:53] you may be seated
[50:56] I want to continue to talk to you and
[50:58] those that are watching and listening
[51:00] many of the families that are out today
[51:02] I want to
[51:04] continue to talk to you about a home to
[51:08] go back to or a home to come back to
[51:11] last week we talked about the prodigal
[51:13] son and how that as when he came to
[51:16] himself and he was he was in a place
[51:19] that a son shouldn't have been in but he
[51:22] was still a son
[51:23] and he was doing something a son
[51:26] shouldn't have been doing but he was
[51:28] still a son aren't you glad that God
[51:30] didn't take you out of the family when
[51:32] you failed and when you were a sinner
[51:34] and when you were messed up and when you
[51:37] back said and he didn't kick you out of
[51:39] the family but he he you were still a
[51:41] son and and so he was still a son during
[51:44] that time in the pig pen in the mud and
[51:48] the Monk and the things that he was in
[51:49] he was still he was still the son
[51:52] and because of that he had a memory of
[51:55] what home was like he somehow he could
[51:58] look back and he could see that there
[52:00] was a home life that was different than
[52:03] the life that he lived and at the very
[52:04] best of what he could make his life now
[52:07] the the very worst of his home life was
[52:10] better than that yeah and and so we
[52:12] talked about how that we could make our
[52:14] homes a place that they could if they
[52:16] were like the prodigal son if our
[52:18] children God forbid would grow up and
[52:20] decide to leave and didn't want anything
[52:22] to do with the gospel that when they
[52:24] came to themselves because we're
[52:27] promised our children do you believe
[52:28] that tonight but when they come to
[52:30] themselves there's something that they
[52:32] can go back to there's a there's a place
[52:34] there's a home there's a reality of life
[52:37] and and so the prodigal son he's in the
[52:39] pig pen and he has a strange thought he
[52:41] says he come to himself and he said hey
[52:44] here I am feeding myself for wanting to
[52:46] feed myself with the with the hus with
[52:49] the with the rejects with the with the
[52:51] things that are given to the pigs with
[52:53] pig food and he said I would have even
[52:55] liked to have had that and they won't
[52:57] even let me have that he's sitting here
[52:59] starving and he said how much better my
[53:02] father treats his servant
[53:05] right so he could remember what his
[53:08] father's home was like
[53:10] and it made him want to go back
[53:13] even if he couldn't be a son anymore
[53:16] even if he couldn't live like he used to
[53:18] he still wanted to go back because
[53:21] because he knew that even the very worst
[53:23] of his father's home
[53:25] these servants were treated with
[53:27] fairness
[53:29] and we talked about having our home that
[53:32] way brother Branham called it a nice
[53:34] home and a happy home
[53:37] said you want a place that you're
[53:38] teenagers they get older would want to
[53:41] come back to
[53:42] a nice home and a happy home
[53:45] and we wouldn't necessarily think about
[53:47] that he said well we want to lay down
[53:49] the law and make sure everything's right
[53:50] and there's a place for that and we'll
[53:52] talk about some of those things this
[53:53] morning but the things that he pointed
[53:55] out especially as they get older is that
[53:58] we should have a place that they want to
[54:00] come back to
[54:02] so now
[54:03] we find as we use this example this
[54:06] morning why would ahaziah the king
[54:10] a king of Israel
[54:12] why would he choose to go to a different
[54:15] God
[54:16] then the god of Israel for healing
[54:20] when he was in desperate need of healing
[54:23] and Elijah was in the land
[54:27] so we could say it like this today the
[54:29] message was there
[54:31] the message was there
[54:33] and yet and we've seen it with with
[54:35] children before we've seen children that
[54:38] will leave the message and then even
[54:41] when they get in their life you see my
[54:43] kids as low as they can go
[54:45] they seek out other gods
[54:48] and sometimes now remember there's
[54:51] always an exception to the rule but
[54:53] sometimes that's because of their home
[54:55] life right
[54:56] because home was so awful
[55:00] that they don't want what Mom and Dad
[55:02] have
[55:03] so they would almost be willing to go
[55:06] anywhere else
[55:08] or on the other hand that they were
[55:10] taught so
[55:12] much by the actions of their mother and
[55:15] father that it wasn't important
[55:18] that the message didn't matter right
[55:21] right because we only did that when we
[55:23] went to church anyway
[55:25] I'm going to preach this morning and I
[55:27] hate it that I hated that some of the
[55:29] folks are going you can Pitchfork on
[55:30] them and they can sit at home and
[55:32] Pitchfork on you and that's fine but but
[55:35] I think we should all take it personally
[55:36] today I know I do
[55:38] you know this
[55:41] home life can be so bad
[55:45] yeah the kids don't want nothing the
[55:46] memories are so awful and you say well I
[55:49] don't I don't think our home is that way
[55:52] and and I trust that it's not I believe
[55:54] you're all Christians here today and and
[55:56] good people and you try to raise your
[55:58] kids in the right way but yet it has
[56:00] that possibility of being that way
[56:03] because we're human yeah and sometimes
[56:05] what we as adults do we don't realize
[56:07] how that affects our children right
[56:10] I heard a story of a man a preacher who
[56:13] had been arguing with his wife and and
[56:16] they said some pretty harsh things to
[56:18] one another and and he had a
[56:20] three-year-old son and they the son they
[56:23] thought was in the bedroom asleep and
[56:25] and a few days later he said he was
[56:28] walking uh down the hallway and he heard
[56:31] his son in his room and he reheard the
[56:34] argument
[56:35] the sun was inside the room actually he
[56:39] had heard all of it
[56:40] and was able to repeat it and was
[56:43] talking to his little toys and things in
[56:46] the same way
[56:47] that he had talked to his mother
[56:50] and he realized that the sun hurt a lot
[56:54] more than what he thought
[56:56] and a lot of times they hear the the
[56:58] harshness of it and the and the
[57:01] disagreement but they don't get to see
[57:03] what lays beneath that is maybe even a
[57:06] stable marriage but all the children see
[57:08] is to the outside and and so they see
[57:10] harshness and that's why we have to be
[57:12] careful how we deal publicly with things
[57:14] even in the church because we want our
[57:17] church home to be nice and to be happy
[57:18] but many times when we deal with certain
[57:21] things in a public way and we deal with
[57:23] them harshly that's all kids remember
[57:25] they remember the bad business meeting
[57:27] they remember the time so-and-so had to
[57:30] leave and they remember the splits and
[57:32] the and the times that that we spent
[57:34] fighting with one another listen that
[57:37] should not be the memory that we leave
[57:39] our children about church it shouldn't
[57:41] be a memory of some kind of church split
[57:43] or some kind of a struggle or a trouble
[57:45] that the church wins through but all
[57:47] that we can leave our children the
[57:49] memory of a place where the Holy Ghost
[57:51] was there where people could feel the
[57:53] presence of God where the preaching
[57:55] where the word was preaching where there
[57:57] was love one for the other and and to
[57:59] remember a place like that
[58:02] isn't that what you want that's what I
[58:04] want I told Brother Alan here a couple
[58:06] years ago when we first came and I think
[58:08] I told the church as well I said oh I I
[58:10] want so badly just to have a place where
[58:12] we can go where there's no agenda where
[58:14] there's nothing that somebody pushing
[58:16] something where we can hear the word
[58:18] preaching and whether I'm preaching it
[58:20] or somebody else is it doesn't matter
[58:22] where we can fellowship with our
[58:23] brothers and sisters and we're not only
[58:25] have an agenda against some other church
[58:27] somewhere and I believe I told you at
[58:29] one point I said I think we're almost
[58:30] there I say I think we're almost there
[58:32] today but the humanity would always try
[58:35] to come in and the devil is always going
[58:37] to try to come in and mess that up yes
[58:39] sir
[58:41] that's his job and we're human
[58:45] right so we need to fight for that
[58:48] to have a home that's not just about a
[58:51] bunch of fights
[58:53] a bunch of fusses who were against what
[58:56] we're against
[58:57] who we're for come
[58:59] on that's our Lord Jesus Christ do you
[59:01] love him today
[59:04] we can present and I'm spending way too
[59:06] long on the introduction here but y'all
[59:08] just forgive me I'll cut off some off
[59:10] the end
[59:11] you don't believe that do you
[59:17] we can present the message in such a way
[59:21] that the memory of it for our children
[59:24] is just the message people are bad
[59:28] I'll tell you what you can say what you
[59:29] want to about message people if there's
[59:31] anybody going to make a rapture
[59:34] it's going to be people who heard this
[59:35] message
[59:36] because the message was the shout
[59:40] right so I kind of get I get a little
[59:42] bit upset when you talk about message
[59:43] people you're talking about me yeah
[59:45] yes we have our problems
[59:48] so we have our circumstances yes we live
[59:51] in laodicea yes we 've culture and
[59:54] everything else pressing on us but there
[59:56] is a bride that will not fall yes sir
[59:58] yes there's a mixed multitude but
[1:00:00] there's got to be somebody who will be a
[1:00:03] real mom and dad in our day gotta be
[1:00:04] somebody who lived for the Lord got to
[1:00:06] be somebody who will walk the right kind
[1:00:08] of a walk yeah in our day
[1:00:11] so if we're not careful we present just
[1:00:13] a memory of negativity
[1:00:15] to our children that's all they ever
[1:00:16] hear that's all they ever remember
[1:00:19] God help us today
[1:00:22] and so now Elijah is in the land Ahab
[1:00:26] and Jezebel have died fulfilling
[1:00:28] prophecy and may Isaiah saw that
[1:00:31] he knew that
[1:00:33] but yet he turns to the God be elzibah
[1:00:37] brother Branham gives us an insight into
[1:00:39] why he did he said now we found find out
[1:00:42] that this ahaziah was the son of Ahab
[1:00:45] and Jezebel he would come out of a
[1:00:47] cursed family what that meant was that
[1:00:50] they had been cursed by Elijah you
[1:00:51] remember because of what they did
[1:00:54] he said when you take a family that's
[1:00:56] raising their children in the wrong
[1:00:58] atmosphere
[1:00:59] you can't hardly expect
[1:01:03] anything else
[1:01:06] let me
[1:01:09] brother Stuart Joel you're gonna have to
[1:01:11] stay with me this morning because
[1:01:13] we're gonna plow kind of Deep
[1:01:16] and watch
[1:01:18] you can't hardly expect anything else
[1:01:21] when the atmosphere we can't fix in five
[1:01:25] minutes what took you 25 years right to
[1:01:29] mess up
[1:01:31] right and then you finally come to the
[1:01:33] pastor Pastor fix it
[1:01:36] right that can't be done yeah
[1:01:39] right it may take 25 years yeah
[1:01:42] yeah unless God just does a miracle you
[1:01:44] understand he could do that aren't you
[1:01:45] glad he does that
[1:01:47] he doesn't some of us weren't raised in
[1:01:49] very good homes but we but that memory
[1:01:52] did not take us away from it but because
[1:01:54] we're a seed of God we cried out to God
[1:01:57] anyway we come to God that's the grace
[1:01:59] of God
[1:02:00] like the woman at the well because she
[1:02:02] had representation in heaven she was
[1:02:03] raised wrong she was led out into the
[1:02:06] world everything that could be done to
[1:02:07] her was wrong but she had representation
[1:02:09] in heaven
[1:02:10] and so he preached about that over the
[1:02:12] last couple weeks how did she God moved
[1:02:15] Jonah to go to Nineveh so that there
[1:02:17] would be Samaritans so the Samaritan
[1:02:19] woman could come because brother Brown
[1:02:21] said she fell from his thoughts
[1:02:24] and if she fell from the thoughts of God
[1:02:25] she had to go back to the thoughts of
[1:02:27] God she had a home to go back to and I
[1:02:30] don't care what your home life was like
[1:02:31] if there if you have a seed of God on
[1:02:33] the inside there's a home for you yeah
[1:02:36] there's a home to go back to
[1:02:40] but now if you raised your children in
[1:02:42] the wrong atmosphere he said you can't
[1:02:43] hardly expect anything else
[1:02:46] the atmosphere of your home is the
[1:02:47] conditions you create by your words
[1:02:49] and actions just like the atmosphere of
[1:02:51] a church is a condition that the pastor
[1:02:54] creates
[1:02:56] largely the pastor and and the people
[1:02:58] you understand what the pastor sets the
[1:03:00] tone
[1:03:01] it's like a man sets the tone in the
[1:03:02] home a pastor sets the tone in in a
[1:03:06] church in the atmosphere of the church
[1:03:08] is the condition we create by our words
[1:03:11] and actions
[1:03:13] God help us today
[1:03:14] I only want an atmosphere of love and
[1:03:16] joy and peace
[1:03:18] long-suffering
[1:03:21] now it's a strange thing brother Branham
[1:03:23] said that a man that's supposed to be an
[1:03:25] Israelite would consult such as that
[1:03:28] instead of going back to the very God
[1:03:31] that brought them over into that land
[1:03:33] and give it to them
[1:03:35] because he was trying to follow the
[1:03:37] trend of the day
[1:03:39] and after his father
[1:03:41] and mother
[1:03:43] he went after beelzebuck which was the
[1:03:46] worst of the Canaanite gods the Elsa Bob
[1:03:50] literally means Lord of the Flies
[1:03:54] Lord of the Flies
[1:03:57] and he was the god the Canaanite god of
[1:04:00] healing
[1:04:01] Lord of the Flies instead of going after
[1:04:05] the great physician
[1:04:08] instead of following instead of
[1:04:10] listening to a prophet that was in the
[1:04:11] land at that time instead of going back
[1:04:13] to the message when he had problems he
[1:04:16] went to the Lord of the Flies
[1:04:19] and this had tragic consequences for his
[1:04:22] life
[1:04:23] and again in second Kings chapter one
[1:04:26] let's go back there in verse three he
[1:04:28] said but the angel of the Lord said to
[1:04:30] Elijah the piss by
[1:04:32] rise go up to meet The Messengers of the
[1:04:34] king of Samaria
[1:04:36] I just love the way God does this
[1:04:38] because here The Messengers are going
[1:04:40] down they think in privacy with a secret
[1:04:43] message from the King because publicly
[1:04:46] he has to still be an Israelite King he
[1:04:49] has to serve Jehovah but primarily he
[1:04:51] serves Baal
[1:04:53] right so now he's sending them down
[1:04:56] after Blvd to go inquire and be else
[1:04:58] about they think on a private mission on
[1:05:01] a secret mission from the King and God
[1:05:04] tells Elijah what the king said to The
[1:05:06] Messengers and said go meet the
[1:05:09] messengers of the king of Samaria and
[1:05:11] say unto them is it not because there is
[1:05:13] not a God in Israel
[1:05:15] that you go to inquire a bills about the
[1:05:17] god of ekron
[1:05:19] and brother random preaches that in his
[1:05:20] sermon called why where he preaches from
[1:05:22] the words of Jeremiah he said is there
[1:05:25] no balm in Gilead
[1:05:28] is there no healing in the house of God
[1:05:32] and I see people today and I I don't I
[1:05:35] don't I don't want to hurt you this
[1:05:37] morning or blame you but many times
[1:05:40] people go after uh counseling that's not
[1:05:43] even Christian and they will leave and I
[1:05:45] and I I want to be careful there because
[1:05:47] sometimes counseling helps but
[1:05:49] counseling can only identify a problem
[1:05:53] is it because there's no balm in Gilead
[1:05:55] that you first seek other things
[1:05:58] that's right is it because there's no
[1:06:00] truth in the message of the hour that
[1:06:02] you look on the internet to see how to
[1:06:03] raise your children
[1:06:08] hope you hear me today and again those
[1:06:09] things can be good they can add to it
[1:06:11] but be careful brother said wisdom was
[1:06:14] fine as long as it agreed with the word
[1:06:16] but word don't agree with the word you
[1:06:18] need to run from
[1:06:19] is it because there's no counsel in the
[1:06:22] house of God is that why you run after
[1:06:23] other things is it because there's no
[1:06:25] physician in the house of God and I
[1:06:27] think sometimes that's why because the
[1:06:29] house of God has become so dead and cold
[1:06:31] and formal and starchy that there's no
[1:06:34] healing left and there's no power left
[1:06:36] and there's no God left there and so the
[1:06:38] people run after other things and you
[1:06:40] see the young people just as soon as
[1:06:42] they're old enough to go they run out
[1:06:43] why because they don't see any power of
[1:06:46] God but Lord help us today to have a
[1:06:48] church to have a home to have a place
[1:06:50] where there's still the power of God
[1:06:52] operating where God can still move
[1:06:55] well we still believe that God Is A
[1:06:57] Healer
[1:06:59] yes because if we don't present that to
[1:07:00] the people
[1:07:01] then they'll seek after other things
[1:07:04] especially our unconverted
[1:07:06] children
[1:07:08] now look
[1:07:11] and that's where we get mixed up
[1:07:13] so I'll go here it'll be okay I'll I'll
[1:07:16] run over here it'll be all right
[1:07:19] and what you don't understand is you're
[1:07:21] not affecting yourself
[1:07:23] you've been a Christian a long time
[1:07:24] you'll be okay
[1:07:27] what you're most affecting is the lives
[1:07:28] of your children that's right
[1:07:30] and you might tell me this morning I
[1:07:31] said brother Ben I don't have any
[1:07:33] children
[1:07:34] but you affect my children
[1:07:37] and these other children
[1:07:39] he said well how can that be well
[1:07:40] because of the life that you live you
[1:07:43] set an example as a Christian you come
[1:07:45] to church and claim to be a Christian
[1:07:46] yeah
[1:07:47] see that's a different thing then and I
[1:07:50] know that parents don't ask for show of
[1:07:51] hands most of the parents are watching
[1:07:53] this morning and not here but but I know
[1:07:55] that if you if you're watching even or
[1:07:57] if you're here if you're a parent you've
[1:07:59] heard this from your children well
[1:08:01] so-and-so's a Christian
[1:08:04] why do they why are they allowed to do
[1:08:06] that
[1:08:07] why did they get by with that and it's a
[1:08:10] hard one of the hardest things to
[1:08:12] explain to your children is why people
[1:08:14] can do things that aren't right
[1:08:16] and still be Christians and then you
[1:08:19] teach them about the grace of God
[1:08:22] and the power of God and how God can
[1:08:25] change people and those things but but
[1:08:27] but but still try to set a standard in
[1:08:29] front of them that's right because we
[1:08:30] want to be right
[1:08:32] he says is it because there's no God in
[1:08:34] Israel he said now therefore thus saith
[1:08:37] the Lord thou shall not come down from
[1:08:38] that bed on which Thou Art gone up
[1:08:40] but shall surely
[1:08:42] die and Elijah departed now I want to
[1:08:45] look more closely at what kind of
[1:08:47] atmosphere was in his eyes home
[1:08:50] first and I'm gonna have to hurry along
[1:08:52] here his home life was a result of a
[1:08:54] mixed marriage between a heathen and a
[1:08:57] backseat in Israelite King Ahab and
[1:09:01] Jezebel and if you want to know what
[1:09:03] kind of a home Jezebel had I challenged
[1:09:05] you to go listen to uh to Jezebel I
[1:09:09] think he calls it brother calls it
[1:09:11] painted face Jezebel there's a sermon
[1:09:13] where brother Brown takes Jezebel and
[1:09:15] talks about her home life and what it
[1:09:17] was like and what kind of a woman that
[1:09:18] she was and he talked about how that she
[1:09:21] would come in and it almost sounds funny
[1:09:22] when he says it but he said she would
[1:09:24] come in and he said she had them red
[1:09:26] long fingernails and and pain under her
[1:09:29] eyes and said she'd be sucking on a
[1:09:31] cigarette and she'd come in and then and
[1:09:33] then Ahab would come home at night and
[1:09:34] she'd slam the door and go sit in the
[1:09:36] corner and say uh wash the dishes and
[1:09:38] they have a wash the dishes because she
[1:09:40] couldn't do that with those hands and
[1:09:41] and so the home was all out of order
[1:09:43] right and you can't really blame Jezebel
[1:09:46] because that's the way she was raised
[1:09:49] that's just who she was
[1:09:51] right she that's just who she was she
[1:09:53] was a heathen
[1:09:55] but the the real problem and as we look
[1:09:58] at this many times the real problem is a
[1:10:00] man or a pastor if we take it to the
[1:10:03] church
[1:10:04] a man who won't stand for what's right
[1:10:06] yeah
[1:10:08] right there's got to be a man in the
[1:10:10] home yeah that'll stand for what's right
[1:10:12] in order for the home to be right and
[1:10:15] again God gives Grace for all kinds of
[1:10:17] different situations I'm not trying to
[1:10:19] condemn you today if there's a different
[1:10:20] situation in your home but I'm just
[1:10:22] speaking of the model home of of the
[1:10:25] family the way God meant for it to be
[1:10:26] there's got to be a man
[1:10:29] and a man's made the way he is for a
[1:10:31] reason
[1:10:33] right for Redemption just like a woman
[1:10:35] is made how she is for a reason it's not
[1:10:37] a lesser thing
[1:10:39] it's not a Lester thing people talk
[1:10:40] about the byproduct when brother Brown
[1:10:42] mentions that and it sounds bad sounds
[1:10:43] like oh it's just some byproduct some
[1:10:45] lesser things that's not what that word
[1:10:47] means at all
[1:10:48] it just means she's part of him
[1:10:51] brother random expressed it this way she
[1:10:53] is him
[1:10:54] yeah bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:10:57] power of his power we are a byproduct of
[1:11:00] Christ in other words we couldn't redeem
[1:11:02] ourselves Eve could not redeem herself
[1:11:05] right Adam had to go out with her in
[1:11:08] order to redeem her even though he was
[1:11:10] not deceived but he had to go out with
[1:11:12] her Jesus had to die for us
[1:11:15] so we could be redeemed we could not
[1:11:16] redeem ourselves
[1:11:18] no amount of legalistic living or or
[1:11:21] even like the things we're talking about
[1:11:22] this one he said well I I do all those
[1:11:24] things to the letter that don't save you
[1:11:26] right
[1:11:28] you're saved by Jesus Christ by the
[1:11:30] blood of Jesus Christ you could not save
[1:11:32] yourself
[1:11:34] but a man and woman are different for
[1:11:36] that reason a man a man redeems his
[1:11:38] family he's the strength of the family
[1:11:40] and woman a woman is the softness is he
[1:11:42] is the ability to of Rebirth of of Grace
[1:11:46] and you see the law and Grace there and
[1:11:48] you see you see works and Grace Works in
[1:11:51] faith
[1:11:52] right in the marriage of man and a woman
[1:11:56] so now
[1:11:57] in First Kings 16 and 31.
[1:12:00] it says it came to pass as if it had
[1:12:02] been a light thing
[1:12:04] for him to walk and speaking of Ahab in
[1:12:07] the sins of jeroboam the son of nibat
[1:12:09] that he took to wife Jezebel
[1:12:12] the daughter of f Bell King of the
[1:12:14] zydonians and went and served the Baal
[1:12:16] and worshiped him are we still okay this
[1:12:18] morning I I spent a long time on the
[1:12:20] introduction but we're now getting to
[1:12:21] the meat of it and then we'll get out of
[1:12:23] it and y'all can go home and lick your
[1:12:24] wounds and come back this afternoon
[1:12:26] brother Joel will be preaching and I'm
[1:12:28] sure it'll be wonderful you'll all enjoy
[1:12:29] it now
[1:12:31] Ahab was a borderline believer
[1:12:35] you know what that is a borderline
[1:12:37] believer go look that up in the message
[1:12:38] a borderline believer
[1:12:40] in other words he was a Believer when it
[1:12:41] was convenient to be a believer
[1:12:45] all right he was borderline
[1:12:47] as long as everything was going okay in
[1:12:49] the church praise God he was there as
[1:12:53] long as there was riches and wealth and
[1:12:55] coming his way praise he was an
[1:12:57] Israelite King he was a wonderful man
[1:12:59] but he was borderline
[1:13:00] and sometimes you'll even find that Ahab
[1:13:02] would repent and walk softly before God
[1:13:04] but it didn't last very long
[1:13:07] he was borderline
[1:13:09] hey Jose he wasn't all together bad he
[1:13:11] wasn't altogether good it was borderline
[1:13:14] but the Branham again picks this up he
[1:13:16] said hey Isaiah was the son of Ahab
[1:13:18] been brought up in the kind of a home
[1:13:19] that was a lukewarm home
[1:13:22] it wasn't altogether Christian
[1:13:25] now watch we talked last week about
[1:13:26] having a nice home and a happy home now
[1:13:28] we're going to talk about the difference
[1:13:30] between a lukewarm home and a home
[1:13:32] that's on fire for God
[1:13:34] right he said they brought up in a kind
[1:13:36] of a home that was a lukewarm home it
[1:13:39] wasn't altogether Christian his mother
[1:13:41] was a heathen and his father had married
[1:13:43] out of Fellowship married a woman that
[1:13:46] was not a Believer and that always makes
[1:13:48] a bad home for any kid to be raised in
[1:13:51] when unbelief in faith tries to mix
[1:13:53] together
[1:13:55] right
[1:13:57] now
[1:13:58] and and we'll get back to that in a
[1:14:00] moment he said now if the father would
[1:14:02] have been a real strong man in his faith
[1:14:05] why did they decide go look at looking
[1:14:07] after other gods
[1:14:09] he said if the father had been a real
[1:14:11] strong man in his faith the child might
[1:14:14] have had a better opportunity
[1:14:16] remember the son still got to choose on
[1:14:18] his own that's right he still has to
[1:14:20] receive the token by it for himself
[1:14:22] but if the father had been a real strong
[1:14:24] man in the faith
[1:14:28] the child might have had a better
[1:14:29] opportunity but he didn't he didn't well
[1:14:33] I thank God for the strong men even
[1:14:34] young men that I see raised it up around
[1:14:36] the message so you strong men in the
[1:14:38] faith
[1:14:39] you can talk him out of it he says the
[1:14:41] father had been a strong man in the
[1:14:42] faith the child might have had a better
[1:14:44] opportunity but he didn't he didn't have
[1:14:45] he knew that there was a God he knew
[1:14:47] that there was a Jehovah he said and
[1:14:49] then his mother's gods and so forth he
[1:14:51] was all confused
[1:14:53] then after the death of his father this
[1:14:55] boy in this condition kind of mixed up
[1:14:58] one way and another and if that ain't a
[1:15:01] picture of the lands today
[1:15:03] one in the family is this away one
[1:15:06] another one going this way one going
[1:15:08] that way he said no wonder we are
[1:15:10] producing so much juvenile delinquency
[1:15:13] all other kinds of stuff under the name
[1:15:16] of Christianity it's because there is no
[1:15:18] Unity
[1:15:21] now watch where he goes in the home
[1:15:22] there's no unity in the home there is no
[1:15:25] real call out and stand for God right
[1:15:29] there's no Unity oh don't you realize
[1:15:31] that the devil wants to do the same
[1:15:33] thing in your home he wants to do the
[1:15:34] same thing in the church he wants to
[1:15:35] produce disunity to where you begin to
[1:15:38] fight and fuss with one another and you
[1:15:40] begin to you begin to talk about one
[1:15:41] another I'm not just talking to parents
[1:15:44] this morning and I'm talking just
[1:15:45] talking to those with children I'm
[1:15:46] talking to all of us
[1:15:48] what kind of a home what kind of a
[1:15:50] church home do we want to have if you
[1:15:52] find that you've you've you've slipped
[1:15:54] out and you begin to be in disunity with
[1:15:56] the people of God now you know there's
[1:15:59] sometimes when there's things you just
[1:16:00] can't stand for and you shouldn't right
[1:16:04] yeah there's times the unity doesn't
[1:16:06] work if there's no truth in it yeah
[1:16:08] yeah but where the truth is being
[1:16:10] preached and people are trying to live
[1:16:11] right and do what's right and trying to
[1:16:13] preach what the the message says
[1:16:16] there should be Unity that's right
[1:16:18] that's right and there should be Unity
[1:16:19] even among from different churches
[1:16:22] and I'll stand for that and I've had to
[1:16:24] I've had to cut off a little bit of my
[1:16:27] own flesh if you could say it that way I
[1:16:29] had to I've had to uh I've had to
[1:16:32] sanctify myself in this way that people
[1:16:34] will come and go
[1:16:37] people will come and go
[1:16:39] and they have a right to
[1:16:41] you go where you want to go to church or
[1:16:43] where you feel like going to church I
[1:16:44] want people to want to be here
[1:16:47] are you with me the song I Want You to
[1:16:48] Want to be here I want you to want to be
[1:16:50] in the house of God I know many of you
[1:16:51] even that are sick this morning or if
[1:16:53] you're not able to be here all the time
[1:16:54] some of you drive a long ways to go to
[1:16:56] church I understand that you want to be
[1:16:57] here but that's what we want is that
[1:16:59] desire that's what we want to see when
[1:17:01] we begin to preach about you
[1:17:02] misunderstand we begin to preach about
[1:17:04] people missing Church we're not talking
[1:17:06] about somebody that wants to be there
[1:17:07] we're talking about those who don't want
[1:17:09] to be there right
[1:17:11] there's something they've lost that
[1:17:13] desire for the word they've lost that
[1:17:15] desire for the things of God tell me if
[1:17:17] you're in church are you just sitting
[1:17:19] there like a bump on a pickle and
[1:17:20] nothing means anything to you there's
[1:17:22] something wrong I know some people
[1:17:24] aren't emotional but if you get to a
[1:17:26] place where your heart can never amen
[1:17:28] the word where there's no response at
[1:17:30] all the word a tear never comes down
[1:17:32] your eye you just have no response at
[1:17:34] all I tell you what there's so you need
[1:17:36] to go checking up yeah
[1:17:38] oh
[1:17:39] because brother Adam said anything
[1:17:40] without emotion and he's not talking
[1:17:42] about just wild running around the
[1:17:44] aisles and we could do that too I praise
[1:17:46] God for that that's not just what he's
[1:17:48] talking about but if there's no emotion
[1:17:50] yeah it's dead
[1:17:52] right he said it ought to be buried
[1:17:57] and just check our own lives
[1:18:00] and I can say as a pastor brother
[1:18:01] Stewart and I've seen this over the
[1:18:02] years a hundred times out of a hundred
[1:18:04] we try to make exceptions of Washington
[1:18:07] Ministries and say well he's just
[1:18:08] tending more towards being a teacher
[1:18:10] that means a bad preacher I think and
[1:18:16] but
[1:18:18] I know so again people are different
[1:18:19] people different styles I mean I'm not
[1:18:21] condemning that but when you have a man
[1:18:22] it was once on fire and he's not anymore
[1:18:25] something happened that's right
[1:18:29] something happened that's not my fault
[1:18:31] or somebody else's fault he needs to get
[1:18:33] right back to God that's right
[1:18:35] that's right and he'd come out of his
[1:18:36] back sitting condition now that applies
[1:18:38] to all of us too yes
[1:18:40] we need to get back to God if the
[1:18:42] message doesn't affect us anymore if it
[1:18:45] doesn't bother us when when we do things
[1:18:47] so little things that are wrong if it
[1:18:49] does there's nothing there it just we
[1:18:50] just kind of can flip in or slip out and
[1:18:53] there's just no emotion at all we need
[1:18:54] to bury that come on come back to the
[1:18:57] house of God come back to God come back
[1:18:59] to the Altar and say Lord let me feel
[1:19:01] that newness again let me come back to
[1:19:03] what I was when I was a new Christian I
[1:19:06] read it just I may have it here in my
[1:19:08] notes I don't remember but I just read
[1:19:09] it this week brother Branham said that
[1:19:11] he said I want to feel like I did when I
[1:19:13] was born again I want that same feeling
[1:19:16] in the church sure that news he said
[1:19:19] that I feel like when when I was here
[1:19:21] when I'm here he said out in the desert
[1:19:23] and I have those experiences with God
[1:19:25] yes
[1:19:28] oh God help us today
[1:19:31] so brother said one is this way and one
[1:19:33] side when there's no real call out in
[1:19:34] the stand for God
[1:19:36] again he said Ahab was a borderline
[1:19:37] believer
[1:19:39] just a fellow that believed enough to
[1:19:40] make him miserable
[1:19:43] and we've all met people like that
[1:19:44] haven't we
[1:19:46] maybe we've been people like that at
[1:19:48] some point in our lives
[1:19:49] just believe enough to make us miserable
[1:19:56] and the answer to that is not to find
[1:19:58] something to do
[1:20:00] because then you'll be a miserable
[1:20:01] deacon
[1:20:02] or a miserable trustee
[1:20:05] or a miserable song leader
[1:20:07] Lord help us
[1:20:09] all right
[1:20:11] preach at you guys this morning but I
[1:20:13] mean if you're miserable anyway and we
[1:20:15] need to give you a job to help you feel
[1:20:17] better about yourself you're going to be
[1:20:19] more miserable yeah that's right
[1:20:21] all right so that's not what we're doing
[1:20:25] I'm gonna have to hide behind this desk
[1:20:26] before I get done
[1:20:29] but look he was a if you're a borderline
[1:20:32] believer that's what makes you miserable
[1:20:35] he said did you ever see people like
[1:20:36] that well they have conception that they
[1:20:38] would like to go to church and do right
[1:20:40] they feel like it'd make them a better
[1:20:42] social person in their social lives
[1:20:46] now watch your brother random takes this
[1:20:47] now
[1:20:49] he said maybe for the sake of their
[1:20:51] children
[1:20:51] they think they ought to maybe belong to
[1:20:54] church
[1:20:56] now it's interesting that brother
[1:20:57] Branham teaches us and we'll we'll get
[1:20:59] deeper into it today before I quit and
[1:21:02] but now he teaches us that to keep your
[1:21:04] children in church it's so essential
[1:21:07] yes right to to having a nice home and a
[1:21:10] happy home to having a to having
[1:21:13] children that raise are raised in the
[1:21:14] fear and admonition the lord it's
[1:21:15] essential to keep those children in the
[1:21:17] house of God
[1:21:19] but if you only come to church for that
[1:21:21] reason
[1:21:22] yeah he said you'd be better off enough
[1:21:25] to come
[1:21:27] he said maybe for the sake of their
[1:21:29] children they think they ought to maybe
[1:21:30] belong to church if that isn't the most
[1:21:32] miserable person I know of yes he said I
[1:21:35] tell you that's the best of Cut Loose he
[1:21:37] said that the best cut loose all
[1:21:39] shorelines and launch out of the deep or
[1:21:41] don't go at all
[1:21:44] yeah oh God help us today we might as
[1:21:46] well be free in the house of God yeah

[1:22:14] to church I I I'll begin to you know
[1:22:16] they'll pull me this way and the peer
[1:22:19] pressure will get to me this way but I'm
[1:22:20] so unhappy if I could just be released
[1:22:22] into heaven into the glory you won't be
[1:22:24] happy there either
[1:22:27] you realize you wouldn't be happy in
[1:22:29] heaven if you're not happy in the house
[1:22:30] of God
[1:22:32] right
[1:22:34] I'm just preaching to you this morning
[1:22:36] that you would not be happy in heaven if
[1:22:38] you are miserable in the house of God
[1:22:40] you would be miserable in heaven because
[1:22:42] it's one great big meeting yes
[1:22:46] I don't that scares some of us
[1:22:49] oh I don't want to go to those wild
[1:22:52] meetings where they jump and shout and
[1:22:54] they scream you realize don't you that
[1:22:56] heaven is one big meeting right
[1:23:01] that's right yeah
[1:23:04] he said well brother Ben I did it they'd
[1:23:06] preach they preach more and not sing so
[1:23:08] much at the meeting they only won't even
[1:23:10] preach in heaven as far as I know
[1:23:15] just one big me boy that some of y'all
[1:23:17] don't even go anymore do you say man
[1:23:21] laughs
[1:23:23] I have four or five days of church my
[1:23:25] goodness
[1:23:28] I'm glad we won't count time like we do
[1:23:31] here
[1:23:33] and there will be no escaping it
[1:23:38] listen if you feel like you're in the
[1:23:40] Chain Gang down here and that's why you
[1:23:41] come to the house of God you're going to
[1:23:43] feel that way up there that's why people
[1:23:45] that feel that way probably won't go
[1:23:47] there
[1:23:48] there's got to be something in your
[1:23:50] heart
[1:23:51] there's got to be a desire to shake that
[1:23:53] that's not able to see it making you
[1:23:54] feel that way that's the culture of the
[1:23:56] age making you feel that way shake that
[1:23:58] thing off
[1:24:02] Church shouldn't be a miserable
[1:24:03] experience right
[1:24:05] now we talked about that what's the best
[1:24:07] way to keep your children home they said
[1:24:08] brother Randall was going to tell them
[1:24:09] now you set the rules be out at a
[1:24:11] certain time be out no he said encourage
[1:24:13] them he said to go with Believers yes
[1:24:16] yes discourage them from going with
[1:24:17] unbelievers that's right he said to make
[1:24:19] your home so nice and so happy
[1:24:23] that they'll want to stay
[1:24:26] the home shouldn't be a miserable
[1:24:28] experience excuse me
[1:24:29] Church shouldn't be a miserable
[1:24:31] experience it ought to be a place where
[1:24:33] we can worship God we can love one
[1:24:35] another we can raise our hands we can
[1:24:36] shout we can praise God and and we can
[1:24:39] hear the word
[1:24:42] we can be changed we can be better than
[1:24:44] when we came in
[1:24:49] but we say well I have to for the sake
[1:24:52] of my children you might as well just
[1:24:53] stay home
[1:24:55] huh
[1:24:56] he said just simply stay home or either
[1:24:58] go all the way for Christ
[1:25:00] God wants somebody who will really go
[1:25:02] all the way
[1:25:03] give all you got soul body and spirit to
[1:25:05] the service of the Lord
[1:25:07] he said now this borderline Believers I
[1:25:09] called him a few minutes ago oh he he
[1:25:11] kind of had a mental conception of his
[1:25:13] theology he thought well there is a God
[1:25:15] but maybe Balaam is God too and the
[1:25:17] others and so forth and his wife kind of
[1:25:19] got him mixed up in that
[1:25:21] he said you know boys I'm telling you
[1:25:23] tonight you young ladies be careful of
[1:25:25] who you marry you'll have a broken home
[1:25:27] the first thing you know he said it's
[1:25:29] not good Sinners and Christians to marry
[1:25:32] together don't be unequally yoked
[1:25:33] together because that's what God Ahab
[1:25:37] now if you watch the messages occurred
[1:25:39] to me the other day but if we watch the
[1:25:42] message now today we seem to be obsessed
[1:25:45] with how people Court
[1:25:49] and say this because we've had several
[1:25:51] young couples lately and and uh I'll
[1:25:54] talk about Gabe Milly because they just
[1:25:56] come through that but it just seemed
[1:25:58] like we were all obsessed
[1:26:00] with how people Court
[1:26:02] you know and you gotta do what the rules
[1:26:04] are not every home has their own I'm not
[1:26:06] preaching on you this morning you got
[1:26:07] your right to every home every father
[1:26:09] has the right to make his own rules and
[1:26:10] all of those things
[1:26:12] amen we still believe that but that's
[1:26:14] not what brother random was obsessed
[1:26:16] with
[1:26:17] go read the message she doesn't talk a
[1:26:19] lot about it
[1:26:21] he doesn't talk a lot about how
[1:26:24] he talks a lot about who
[1:26:29] right because even if you do everything
[1:26:32] right
[1:26:33] yeah and you make no mistakes
[1:26:37] but you just married somebody because
[1:26:39] that's just the only available person or
[1:26:41] or or because you're attracted to them
[1:26:43] just physically or marry someone out
[1:26:46] this that's never come to Christ
[1:26:48] whether they're on a church Peter or not
[1:26:50] you marry somebody like that you're
[1:26:53] going to end up with a broken home more
[1:26:55] likely than not unless God do some
[1:26:57] miraculously intervenes now he said
[1:26:59] brother Ben will my my wife or my
[1:27:00] husband they might be out there
[1:27:01] somewhere they might be but you don't go
[1:27:03] looking for them out there yeah let them
[1:27:05] come in and get saved
[1:27:07] and get born again before you start
[1:27:09] going with them could God change that
[1:27:12] situation absolutely but but let's stay
[1:27:14] with the word yes
[1:27:16] let's let's not focus on the exception
[1:27:18] let's focus on the rule I know brother
[1:27:20] random was concerned with who
[1:27:22] marry a believer
[1:27:25] hey man I'm so happy to see some of you
[1:27:26] young couples Noli and Levi getting
[1:27:28] married and so you young couples have
[1:27:31] just been married marry a Believer God
[1:27:33] bless you for that you'll have enough
[1:27:35] problems with a believer
[1:27:39] that right brother Gabe
[1:27:41] maybe no is that right sister Millie
[1:27:45] I asked the wrong person
[1:27:49] I saw sister Millie holding the baby
[1:27:50] today I I don't I think that's her niece
[1:27:52] but
[1:27:53] it looks good this looks right they're
[1:27:57] holding the baby
[1:28:01] now but but we want to be obsessed with
[1:28:03] how
[1:28:05] and we put so much pressure on people
[1:28:07] this is outside my notes but you just
[1:28:09] hang with me today but but brother
[1:28:11] Brown's focused on who
[1:28:12] yeah that's right he said pray
[1:28:17] I say pray like you've never prayed
[1:28:18] before
[1:28:19] because there's no other decision in
[1:28:21] life
[1:28:22] that can't be undone
[1:28:25] but this one pray
[1:28:27] ER
[1:28:28] understood because you want to get out
[1:28:30] of the house
[1:28:31] pray
[1:28:33] and we shouldn't be so obsessed with
[1:28:35] what or how but who
[1:28:38] the Bible says a virtuous woman is a
[1:28:41] crown to her husband
[1:28:42] oh thank God in other words she she's
[1:28:46] the beautiful part if you watch the
[1:28:48] funeral for Queen Elizabeth that Crown
[1:28:49] how beautiful that was I thought it was
[1:28:51] silver but when they come up close to it
[1:28:53] it was diamonds over that Crown there's
[1:28:55] no telling what that thing's worth
[1:28:57] that's your wife Brothers
[1:29:00] if she's a virtuous woman she's a crowd
[1:29:04] she she is what he said well I have
[1:29:06] authority in the home she is what gives
[1:29:08] you that Authority
[1:29:10] amen that's right right she's what she
[1:29:12] allows you she's submissive to you and
[1:29:15] she's Godly and she loves you and so she
[1:29:17] allows you to have that Authority she's
[1:29:19] your crown
[1:29:21] a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[1:29:23] husband
[1:29:24] but she that maketh ashamed is as
[1:29:26] rottenness in his bones
[1:29:29] if rottenness gets in the bones it'll
[1:29:33] spread
[1:29:34] and it'll end up making the man so weak
[1:29:37] you can't stand
[1:29:40] oh God that was ahab's problem
[1:29:43] Jezebel with rottenness in his bones and
[1:29:46] he injected it
[1:29:48] by marrying her
[1:29:51] First Kings 18 17 it came to pass when
[1:29:54] Ahab saw Elijah the Ahab said unto her
[1:29:56] said unto him art thou he the trouble of
[1:29:58] Israel now watch we're looking at how
[1:30:00] that home was that home was a place
[1:30:02] where the prophet got blamed for all of
[1:30:05] the problems
[1:30:06] right
[1:30:08] we've seen places like that haven't we
[1:30:10] yeah
[1:30:11] the prophet got blamed for all of the
[1:30:13] problems it happened saw Elijah he said
[1:30:15] are you he that troubles Israel
[1:30:18] Elijah followed up he said no you in
[1:30:20] your father's house
[1:30:23] what was it the problem
[1:30:25] was not the doctor or the medicine it
[1:30:27] was not the preacher yeah go listen to
[1:30:29] the sermon why that brother Brown
[1:30:30] preaches over and over again
[1:30:33] it's that you've never taken it
[1:30:35] God help us today
[1:30:37] brother random said so it is today men
[1:30:39] and women will sit in the church in the
[1:30:40] church few hear the unadulterated gospel
[1:30:43] the power of the Holy Ghost see the
[1:30:44] manifestations and demonstrations of his
[1:30:46] Spirit of a living resurrected Christ
[1:30:48] and die in sin standing in the church
[1:30:50] few not because there's no bomb but
[1:30:53] because not be not because there's no
[1:30:54] physician but it's because the people
[1:30:56] are too stubborn to take the medicine
[1:30:58] trying to find the least way of
[1:31:00] resistance going the way of the world
[1:31:02] perishing in the game saying of Korah oh
[1:31:05] God help us today you realize that'll
[1:31:06] only get worse and worse
[1:31:09] because to be a borderline believer
[1:31:11] you're going to have to move farther and
[1:31:13] farther over towards the world
[1:31:17] you can't just stay where you are you're
[1:31:19] going to have to keep getting closer and
[1:31:21] closer to the world because the world is
[1:31:23] getting farther and farther away from
[1:31:25] God
[1:31:27] so to be a borderline believer you're
[1:31:29] gonna have to move
[1:31:31] you're going to have to keep making
[1:31:32] concessions to the devil God help us not
[1:31:36] to do that today
[1:31:38] see many folks blame the message for
[1:31:40] their problems but they never listen to
[1:31:41] it
[1:31:43] or lived it
[1:31:46] they blame the message for it right
[1:31:49] right and it's not the message is fault
[1:31:51] it's not God's fault because the message
[1:31:53] is Christ you believe that
[1:31:55] now there's a reason why God's order is
[1:31:57] set up the way it is are you still with
[1:31:58] me this morning I hope I'm not boring
[1:32:00] you I I know some of you just come for
[1:32:02] the wedding shower and and uh well I
[1:32:04] didn't call it a baby shower praise God
[1:32:08] I told David if I mentioned I'm not
[1:32:10] going to mention that wedding shirt if I
[1:32:11] do call it a baby shower
[1:32:13] but I guess I kind of did didn't I by
[1:32:16] telling you all that
[1:32:18] but if you're just here for that and
[1:32:20] we're glad that you're here but I don't
[1:32:22] want to bore you this morning but let's
[1:32:23] try to focus on the word for a minute
[1:32:26] and you that are watching as well we we
[1:32:28] need to know these things
[1:32:30] oh look Ahab told Jezebel all that
[1:32:34] Elijah had done
[1:32:36] now notice the dynamic in their home
[1:32:39] it says and with all how he had signed
[1:32:41] all the prophets with the sword so now
[1:32:42] AB goes up and you remember the story
[1:32:44] Elijah calls fire down out of heaven and
[1:32:46] so they come out and they kill the
[1:32:47] prophets of Baal
[1:32:49] and Ahab goes sleeking back into Samaria
[1:32:54] and complains to his wife because that's
[1:32:56] ahab's nature
[1:32:58] he's not going to stand against anything
[1:33:00] and so Ahab comes back in
[1:33:03] Jezebel
[1:33:06] beer
[1:33:08] you wouldn't believe what Elijah did in
[1:33:09] church today
[1:33:12] there's some wildfire in the church
[1:33:17] got in there and then got Elijah he he
[1:33:20] prayed that prayer and Fire come down
[1:33:22] from heaven
[1:33:24] and you know and people say well you
[1:33:26] know the the other people dance the
[1:33:28] prophets of Baal danced and all of that
[1:33:29] around the altar yes they did but there
[1:33:31] was no fire
[1:33:33] but when Elijah prayed
[1:33:35] there was fire
[1:33:38] may have says well
[1:33:40] I don't know what I'm gonna do
[1:33:42] okay
[1:33:43] you can't go in this guy's church and
[1:33:45] I'm his biggest highest pair
[1:33:48] I'm the king of the land
[1:33:50] uh he keeps bringing him evangelist in
[1:33:53] that this Wildfire Runners to the church
[1:33:55] and and they've done killed all the
[1:33:58] prophets of Baal
[1:34:00] we can't do nothing no more
[1:34:04] prophets told us it was okay to do all
[1:34:06] the things we're doing and sacrificing
[1:34:07] all the altars that were sacrificed that
[1:34:09] we can't do nothing no more
[1:34:11] without our backslidden preachers to
[1:34:13] help us
[1:34:14] what are we going to do
[1:34:17] you just
[1:34:19] his nature
[1:34:21] Jezebel says I'll take care of it
[1:34:24] because she was the man of the house
[1:34:28] that's how not how it's supposed to work
[1:34:34] Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah
[1:34:36] saying so let the gods do to me and more
[1:34:39] also if I make not thy life it's the
[1:34:40] life of one of them by tomorrow about
[1:34:42] this time she already had Ahab scared
[1:34:44] over you know what she did after Elijah
[1:34:45] come out of the anointing she scared the
[1:34:47] prophet
[1:34:51] this this woman was such a dominating
[1:34:53] woman and such a such a hard Heathen
[1:34:57] woman that she actually scared a prophet
[1:34:59] of God who's out from under the
[1:35:00] anointing yes
[1:35:03] and he'd be the Bible says he ran for
[1:35:06] his life
[1:35:07] now we shouldn't look to the culture for
[1:35:09] gender roles in the family right
[1:35:11] look to the word yeah we shouldn't even
[1:35:14] look at our parents necessarily because
[1:35:16] some of them misunderstood the message
[1:35:19] I hate to break that to you but
[1:35:21] some of us third and fourth generation
[1:35:23] message Believers fifth generation for
[1:35:25] some people some of us our parents and
[1:35:27] grandparents misunderstood
[1:35:30] and beat their wives around the house
[1:35:31] and stuff like that we don't need to
[1:35:32] look to them
[1:35:34] for how to treat our wives we need to
[1:35:35] look to the word yeah
[1:35:37] and the same thing for the wives to the
[1:35:39] husbands now but there's a reason why
[1:35:41] God's order is set up the way that it is
[1:35:44] now brother Branham preaches and I will
[1:35:46] just briefly touch on this but brother
[1:35:48] random preaches or he deals with
[1:35:50] thyatira at the church age and excuse me
[1:35:53] from Revelation 3 Revelation 2 and he
[1:35:56] deals with that and he talks about how
[1:35:58] thyatara means a dominating female
[1:36:00] and uh he talked about that being the
[1:36:02] Catholic Church the the church should
[1:36:04] not dominate over the word
[1:36:07] maybe I need to say that again the
[1:36:09] church should not dominate over the word
[1:36:12] just because I'm the pastor doesn't mean
[1:36:14] I get to dominate over the word I'm
[1:36:17] still part of the Bride yeah even the
[1:36:20] prophet himself was still part of the
[1:36:21] Bride he does not dominate over the word
[1:36:24] yet when he spoke the words of God it
[1:36:26] was the Oracles of God that's God
[1:36:28] speaking that's Authority right and so
[1:36:31] now but they this church they suffered
[1:36:34] also that woman Jezebel and brother
[1:36:36] Branham said that excuse me tie a Tyra
[1:36:38] he said that was a woman with an iron
[1:36:41] disposition he said a woman is not meant
[1:36:43] to have an iron disposition and and in
[1:36:46] first Timothy Paul picks that up he said
[1:36:48] first Timothy 2 12 he said I suffer not
[1:36:50] a woman to teach nor to usurp Authority
[1:36:53] usurp Authority and that means well I'm
[1:36:56] I'm on a run after this but that means
[1:36:58] usurp authority over the man but to be
[1:37:01] in silence that he doesn't qualify that
[1:37:03] just to church
[1:37:06] yeah you can you surf authority over a
[1:37:09] man on Facebook
[1:37:11] if you don't believe that you just throw
[1:37:13] it out but I think if you look at the
[1:37:15] scriptures and just look at it honestly
[1:37:16] he doesn't say just not in church that's
[1:37:18] right
[1:37:20] now again there's some there's some
[1:37:22] exceptions the woman can teach other
[1:37:23] women
[1:37:24] younger women
[1:37:26] but not the word
[1:37:28] right teaching them how to keep house
[1:37:30] how to love their husbands there's very
[1:37:32] specific things that a woman can teach
[1:37:34] other younger women and some of those
[1:37:35] things are derived from the word but you
[1:37:37] don't handle the word
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:41] now look but but to be in silence and so
[1:37:45] you don't you don't and I don't know of
[1:37:46] any instance where this is happening I'm
[1:37:48] not preaching it anybody but you can use
[1:37:51] serp authority over a man on the
[1:37:52] internet and you have to be careful with
[1:37:54] that
[1:37:55] you don't get to correct preachers on
[1:37:58] the internet
[1:38:00] I honestly don't think any of us should
[1:38:02] be doing that God help me at least I am
[1:38:04] a pastor
[1:38:08] God bless you this morning
[1:38:11] okay
[1:38:12] we're going to laugh or cry
[1:38:16] but where does Paul you say well that
[1:38:18] that's not fair Paul takes it back to
[1:38:20] God's design
[1:38:22] he said if Adam was first formed and
[1:38:25] then Eve
[1:38:26] he said Adam was not deceived but the
[1:38:28] woman being deceived was in the
[1:38:30] transgression she was created to be a
[1:38:33] help meet to him or help his counterpart
[1:38:35] as we said last week the person in the
[1:38:37] mirror the mirror image of him that's
[1:38:39] what that word means
[1:38:41] so again though you can't feel sorry for
[1:38:44] Ahab because Jezebel was this way see he
[1:38:47] wanted to be told what to do because he
[1:38:48] was backslid
[1:38:51] he wouldn't have married her in the
[1:38:52] first place if he had been where he
[1:38:54] should be with God
[1:38:56] and we find also that their home I'm
[1:38:58] almost out of time and we'll have to
[1:39:00] finish the rest in some other time but
[1:39:02] it's almost full of self-pity and
[1:39:04] jealousy you ever been around a home
[1:39:07] like that
[1:39:08] a church can be like that that's right
[1:39:13] right yeah God help us today
[1:39:15] it's almost full of self-pity and
[1:39:17] jealousy
[1:39:18] look at the story of nabos Vineyard and
[1:39:21] I'm just gonna have to close here today
[1:39:22] we've got much more
[1:39:24] but
[1:39:28] there was a the story was that naboth
[1:39:31] had a Vineyard close to ahabs
[1:39:33] and they have not being where he should
[1:39:36] be he was back said he asked neighbor to
[1:39:39] do something that was against the word
[1:39:41] and what that was was to give his land
[1:39:44] to him
[1:39:45] but the word says that you're to possess
[1:39:48] that Land once you had land you weren't
[1:39:51] supposed to give it up
[1:39:52] it would go back to your family even if
[1:39:54] you lost it in your Jubilee it would
[1:39:56] come back
[1:39:57] and so naboth is out there doing what
[1:39:59] God told him to do
[1:40:01] that's all he's doing that's what God
[1:40:02] told him to do
[1:40:04] but because he had a beautiful garden
[1:40:06] yeah
[1:40:07] he had fruit he had everything that was
[1:40:09] gathered around there was wonderful we
[1:40:10] got to watch Envy we got to be careful
[1:40:13] of covetousness we've got to be careful
[1:40:16] of jealousy
[1:40:18] especially when it comes to the age of
[1:40:20] social media yeah because we look at
[1:40:22] other families and what they did and
[1:40:24] what they have but you don't go by that
[1:40:25] because you're not looking at the truth
[1:40:27] right
[1:40:28] right you're looking at a perception
[1:40:30] yeah you're looking at a doctored image
[1:40:34] see you don't see the trials you don't
[1:40:36] see uh you don't see the struggles all
[1:40:39] you see is the happy family
[1:40:42] I can post a picture of myself on
[1:40:44] vacation and we do sometimes I'm not
[1:40:46] preaching against sad but I can post a
[1:40:48] picture and we're all smiling we're all
[1:40:49] happy you you didn't see what it took to
[1:40:51] get that picture
[1:40:55] and the vehicle that broke down y'all
[1:40:57] have been there how much money you spent
[1:41:00] on it now you're worried about the about
[1:41:02] the bills when you get back and all
[1:41:04] those things I don't think we should
[1:41:05] borrow money to go on vacation but
[1:41:06] you've done it and I've done it some of
[1:41:09] you have anyway some of you have never
[1:41:10] borrowed money for anything I'm
[1:41:12] preaching to brother Harvey now and he's
[1:41:13] not here
[1:41:16] but you know if you if you're that type
[1:41:18] of a person that that you want to post
[1:41:21] everything that looks good and the other
[1:41:22] people look at that and say well well
[1:41:24] you know their family is not like mine
[1:41:26] yes they are
[1:41:27] they're human yeah
[1:41:29] yeah they're human they struggle with
[1:41:31] the same things that you struggle with
[1:41:32] and I'll tell you you young couples when
[1:41:34] as you're getting older you know you
[1:41:36] want better than what your parents had
[1:41:37] that's right you should want better
[1:41:40] but don't look too hard on your parents
[1:41:42] yeah because one day you're going to be
[1:41:44] your parents
[1:41:47] huh
[1:41:48] you look back and say man
[1:41:52] wish I'd done things more like my dad
[1:41:54] did
[1:41:55] maybe not
[1:41:59] but but you know you you look back and
[1:42:02] you realize someone said the older you
[1:42:03] get the wiser your father gets
[1:42:08] true because because you as you get
[1:42:11] older you realize that there were things
[1:42:12] they went through that made them the way
[1:42:14] that they were and you're going to go
[1:42:15] through things too
[1:42:17] and we get in this state of envy and
[1:42:19] jealousy and struggle yeah
[1:42:21] yeah we look around to other people's
[1:42:23] Gardens
[1:42:26] wish I had that car
[1:42:28] you realize it's broke down in mortgaged
[1:42:30] to the hilt
[1:42:32] looks nice though
[1:42:37] I'm talking about myself now you know I
[1:42:38] don't know about y'all
[1:42:42] but I wish I had what you had with Ben
[1:42:44] and we do that with churches too oh if
[1:42:46] my church only had this certain song
[1:42:48] leader my church only had this certain
[1:42:49] preacher we only had this certain thing
[1:42:51] be careful looking at other people's
[1:42:53] Vineyards
[1:42:54] there are other peoples for a reason
[1:42:56] yeah
[1:42:58] yeah
[1:43:01] and so naboth was given this Vineyard by
[1:43:03] God yeah
[1:43:05] and the king who was supposed to
[1:43:07] represent Godly judgment
[1:43:10] comes up to him and says sell it to me
[1:43:13] I want it because it looked good up next
[1:43:16] to mine it borders mine I'm not gonna
[1:43:19] make you raise your hand but you
[1:43:20] probably had neighbors like that you
[1:43:21] wish they'd just sell out
[1:43:24] and there's people around you that would
[1:43:26] I look good up next to mine well that
[1:43:28] that boat would look good hit stuff to
[1:43:30] my truck and and you can take it to
[1:43:32] anything like that but you begin to want
[1:43:33] it
[1:43:35] be careful what you want
[1:43:37] you might get it
[1:43:41] so I have come into his house
[1:43:43] after naboth refused to do this business
[1:43:45] deal
[1:43:47] he's heavy the Bible says and displeased
[1:43:51] and I love the descriptiveness of the
[1:43:53] scripture here he said because of the
[1:43:55] word which naboth the jezraelite had
[1:43:58] spoken to him
[1:43:59] for he had said
[1:44:01] I will not give Thee the inheritance of
[1:44:03] my father's
[1:44:05] oh God that we could be that way about
[1:44:07] the word
[1:44:10] notice what it happened us he laid him
[1:44:16] and would eat no bread
[1:44:19] what a baby
[1:44:24] this is a grown man
[1:44:31] some of y'all need to grow up
[1:44:35] I felt like doing this sometimes though
[1:44:39] I'm just being honest with you you go
[1:44:40] home after a hard service I'm gonna go
[1:44:42] home after this service
[1:44:47] Joel's done that
[1:44:50] I've seen brother Joe I'll call him on
[1:44:51] Monday how you doing not so good
[1:44:57] I know brother Stewart has you get home
[1:44:58] you think man
[1:45:01] so he he got home
[1:45:02] he turned his face to the wall nobody
[1:45:04] loves me the other preachers won't
[1:45:07] fellowship with me
[1:45:08] yeah I'll just take it to myself you
[1:45:10] know yeah
[1:45:11] yeah I went to the meeting and they did
[1:45:13] the same
[1:45:20] not any house well your king
[1:45:24] not enough
[1:45:26] but their Vineyard is so nice
[1:45:29] promise some of us don't lay down face
[1:45:31] to all some of us prepare sermons
[1:45:36] I want to prepare a sermon when you're
[1:45:38] in that state
[1:45:39] right you don't want to take your wife
[1:45:41] out for dinner
[1:45:43] when you're in that state but he laid
[1:45:45] down in your soul don't want to do
[1:45:46] anything and Jezebel immediately knows
[1:45:48] something's wrong and because she's the
[1:45:49] man of the house
[1:45:54] his wife come to him and said why is thy
[1:45:56] spirit so sad that thou eat is no bread
[1:45:59] yeah
[1:46:01] he explained it to him to her said here
[1:46:03] because I speak in the neighbor author
[1:46:05] and I said give I said to him give me
[1:46:07] that Vineyard for money or else if it
[1:46:09] pleased me I'll give thee another
[1:46:10] Vineyard for it I I'll do anything you
[1:46:12] want I just want that
[1:46:14] yeah and he answered I will not give
[1:46:16] thee my Vineyard
[1:46:18] and Jezebel his wife said unto him
[1:46:21] thus thou now govern the Kingdom of
[1:46:23] Israel
[1:46:25] here's some notes
[1:46:28] arise eat bread
[1:46:30] let thine heart be merry Jezebel take
[1:46:33] care of you
[1:46:36] now you realize if that had been a
[1:46:38] husband to a wife
[1:46:40] given a different situation you know how
[1:46:42] your wife gets sometimes she gets down
[1:46:43] and and you cheer her up you say I'm not
[1:46:46] going to tell her how I'm just going to
[1:46:47] take care of it
[1:46:49] right
[1:46:50] I'm not the only one who's ever done
[1:46:52] that
[1:46:55] I'm just going to take care of it let
[1:46:57] her rest
[1:46:59] but that's not her role
[1:47:05] he's a grown man
[1:47:07] he's supposed to be able to take bad
[1:47:09] days people are supposed to be able to
[1:47:10] say no
[1:47:14] oh God what kind of a home are we
[1:47:15] raising our children in yeah
[1:47:18] yeah and that's why you get a bunch of
[1:47:19] backsitting men
[1:47:21] unable to stand for the word unable to
[1:47:23] to stand for it I'll tell you this if I
[1:47:25] get off the word the deacons the
[1:47:26] trustees and the men of this church
[1:47:29] have a right and a responsibility to
[1:47:31] tell me
[1:47:32] I'm not talking about some little thing
[1:47:34] you disagree with I'm talking about if I
[1:47:35] get off the word
[1:47:37] if I begin to preach my prejudices and
[1:47:39] my my uh my uh just my my own thoughts
[1:47:43] to you and and begin to just bring the
[1:47:45] church down you've got to write in
[1:47:47] responsibility maybe I can explain it to
[1:47:50] you yeah
[1:47:51] but maybe I'm wrong
[1:47:53] yeah somebody's got to stand up in that
[1:47:55] situation
[1:47:57] somebody's got to be a man
[1:48:00] not just a Yes Man
[1:48:02] somebody's got to be a man a real friend
[1:48:04] will Proverbs says blessed are the
[1:48:07] wounds from a friend
[1:48:11] and they desire was raised in that
[1:48:13] gloomy Covetous jealous atmosphere
[1:48:18] no wonder he went seeking other gods
[1:48:21] because his father claimed to be a
[1:48:23] believer but his mother who claimed to
[1:48:25] be an unbeliever was the only strength
[1:48:27] in the home
[1:48:29] he had no home
[1:48:31] to go back to
[1:48:33] oh God
[1:48:36] can you give me five more minutes this
[1:48:38] morning
[1:48:38] I'll try to run through I don't want to
[1:48:40] have to come back to this Lord knows I
[1:48:42] tried all night to not have to preach
[1:48:44] this today
[1:48:46] I sat at my computer last night and
[1:48:48] tried to come up with another sermon to
[1:48:49] preach to you this morning because I
[1:48:51] thought a bunch of them going to be gone
[1:48:52] and they're gonna they're gonna come
[1:48:53] after me with pitchforks but I I don't
[1:48:55] believe you're that kind of a people
[1:48:56] this morning maybe the visitors who
[1:48:58] knows you know
[1:49:04] but
[1:49:06] hey Evan Jezebel have two sons
[1:49:09] become Kings and you you'll get confused
[1:49:13] in the weeds of names because there's
[1:49:14] two a his eyes two johorams in this in
[1:49:17] these scriptures one in Israel one in
[1:49:19] Judah the details are confusing but
[1:49:22] there's a king in Judah named johoram
[1:49:25] and I want to show you he said well my
[1:49:26] family life hasn't been perfect well
[1:49:28] sometimes God can step in and use you
[1:49:32] even with someone else's child
[1:49:35] now hear them hear me this morning you
[1:49:37] can be a strength in the life of someone
[1:49:39] else even when it's not your own child
[1:49:41] many times and actually keep them in the
[1:49:44] place your grandmothers should take
[1:49:45] courage today
[1:49:47] because another individual can step in
[1:49:50] sometimes and provide the atmosphere
[1:49:52] that a child needs
[1:49:55] because now there's a king in Judah
[1:49:57] remember as I was in Israel but there's
[1:49:59] a king in Judah named johoram he marries
[1:50:02] ahab's daughter
[1:50:04] whose name was a Thalia and she may be
[1:50:07] the most famous or the most infamous
[1:50:09] woman after Jezebel in the Bible
[1:50:12] because she was a very very Wicked Woman
[1:50:14] and the Bible tells us if you go look it
[1:50:16] up in Chronicles that her mother and
[1:50:18] father her or her mother said was her
[1:50:20] tutor
[1:50:22] taught her to be that way
[1:50:25] Jezebel taught her her mother the way
[1:50:28] the scripted King James puts it her
[1:50:29] mother was her counselor
[1:50:31] in Second Kings 8 18 it tells us that
[1:50:36] this johoram walked in the way of the
[1:50:38] Kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab
[1:50:40] the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he
[1:50:42] did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:50:45] now he dies johoram dies and his son
[1:50:47] becomes king who happens also to be
[1:50:49] named Isaiah
[1:50:53] and a messiah dies
[1:50:55] and so now Italia the daughter of boy I
[1:50:58] got you confused a Thalia the daughter
[1:51:00] of Jezebel
[1:51:02] was now the Queen Mother
[1:51:06] and her son didn't have any children
[1:51:07] didn't last long enough
[1:51:09] so he dies
[1:51:11] and now she's the queen mother but
[1:51:13] there's other Royal seed but it says in
[1:51:16] Second Kings 11 1 when Nathalia the
[1:51:18] mother of a headaches saw that her son
[1:51:19] was dead she arose and destroyed all the
[1:51:22] seed Royal
[1:51:24] but jehoshapha the daughter of King
[1:51:27] Jorah
[1:51:28] sister of Isaiah took joash the son of
[1:51:32] ahaziah
[1:51:33] the son of a vaccine King was the son of
[1:51:35] a vaccine King who married a daughter of
[1:51:37] Jezebel
[1:51:40] by right she should have he should have
[1:51:42] ended up just like they were
[1:51:45] like oh God
[1:51:49] he should have ended up just some of you
[1:51:51] should have ended up on a bad path
[1:51:52] because of how you were raised and who
[1:51:54] your parents were
[1:51:56] but there's hope look what happens in
[1:51:58] this situation
[1:52:00] he took joach now she's his aunt
[1:52:03] his aunt
[1:52:04] took joash the son of ahaziah
[1:52:07] and stole him from among the king's Sons
[1:52:10] which were slain
[1:52:11] and they hid him even him and his nurse
[1:52:15] in the bed Chamber from Italia so that
[1:52:17] he was not slain
[1:52:19] watch he was with her hid in the house
[1:52:23] of the Lord
[1:52:25] six years
[1:52:27] and the value did reign over
[1:52:31] the land
[1:52:35] he turned out what kind of a King when
[1:52:37] he turned out to be second Kings 12 2.
[1:52:39] joash calls him jehosh did that which
[1:52:42] was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:52:44] all his days were in jail die of the
[1:52:47] priest instructed him I don't have time
[1:52:49] to get into the Revival that happened
[1:52:51] during that time and how when he was
[1:52:53] seven years old they took him out of the
[1:52:54] temple I don't have time to get into all
[1:52:56] that this morning but the point is he
[1:52:58] was raised in the house of God
[1:53:02] oh God help us today what can I do for
[1:53:06] new children what can I
[1:53:13] what can I'm around church people take
[1:53:14] every opportunity that you can for your
[1:53:17] children to be in the house of God
[1:53:20] because this young man being raised in
[1:53:22] the house of God made all the difference
[1:53:24] his mother was a wicked woman but he
[1:53:27] become a righteous King
[1:53:29] his grandmother was a Wicked Woman his
[1:53:31] dad his granddad Wicked people
[1:53:34] but he become a righteous King
[1:53:37] oh God
[1:53:38] why he had a seed of David in it
[1:53:42] Gloria and if you take a seat of David
[1:53:45] put him in the house of God
[1:53:48] raise him in the house of God they
[1:53:50] become a righteous ruler
[1:53:53] her own home and their own family
[1:53:56] God help us today
[1:53:59] that ties back to the Prodigal Son as
[1:54:01] well brother Branham told us the
[1:54:02] prodigal son was raised in church he
[1:54:04] said this young son's feeling the same
[1:54:05] way he said mother I don't want no more
[1:54:07] to do with this family all you do is go
[1:54:09] to church
[1:54:11] but he found out
[1:54:13] later that going to church meant
[1:54:15] something
[1:54:16] began to miss
[1:54:18] the house of God
[1:54:20] it's one of the very best things you can
[1:54:22] do for your children is to is to attend
[1:54:25] church Faithfully you want to destroy
[1:54:27] your children spiritually take them out
[1:54:29] of church
[1:54:31] oh God
[1:54:33] I'll just skip onto the clothes
[1:54:35] we'll get to the rest of that maybe some
[1:54:37] other week that's the great thing about
[1:54:38] being a pastor you don't have to do what
[1:54:40] I did this morning and preach too long
[1:54:42] I've got an hour's worth of notes left
[1:54:45] I heard something this this week
[1:54:48] Daryl Ward was the musicians go ahead
[1:54:50] and come
[1:54:51] but the Daryl Ward said that he was
[1:54:54] preaching that we went up to the
[1:54:55] meetings Friday night Saturday morning
[1:54:57] and come back
[1:54:59] up at Galena
[1:55:01] but Daryl was preaching he said preached
[1:55:03] a simple sermon to the young people but
[1:55:04] I grabbed hold of part of it giving his
[1:55:06] testimony he said I was saved in a
[1:55:10] in an antique store
[1:55:13] and he said
[1:55:16] the spirit of the Lord moved in that
[1:55:18] place
[1:55:19] he said and I felt it
[1:55:22] he said and I knew it was the spirit of
[1:55:24] the Lord
[1:55:25] because when I was little
[1:55:27] his my parents went to church
[1:55:31] he said and then they backslid and left
[1:55:33] church
[1:55:34] but the fact that he was in the house of
[1:55:36] the Lord
[1:55:37] and had felt the presence of the Lord
[1:55:40] when it come time that God began to
[1:55:42] reach down to him and begin to begin to
[1:55:45] bring something into his heart and into
[1:55:46] his mind and God began to begin to reach
[1:55:49] out and call to him when that time came
[1:55:52] he was on drugs and alcohol and
[1:55:53] everything else he said but when that
[1:55:55] time come he said I felt that presence
[1:55:58] that I felt when I was a child
[1:56:00] do you realize how important it is that
[1:56:03] we have our our children in church
[1:56:06] and not just in church but in the
[1:56:07] presence of God
[1:56:09] in an atmosphere that's nice in an
[1:56:12] atmosphere that's that's Happy in an
[1:56:14] atmosphere that's Godly in an atmosphere
[1:56:16] that's loving
[1:56:18] in an atmosphere where the presence of
[1:56:20] God can move you say brother we don't
[1:56:22] see much right now we've got I don't
[1:56:24] know 20 25 little children here in the
[1:56:26] church that little bitty ones I'm
[1:56:28] speaking by faith 25 there's probably
[1:56:29] four more it'll come along before long
[1:56:31] but
[1:56:34] anyway
[1:56:40] but but there's over 20. little there'll
[1:56:43] be children here in the church
[1:56:45] and I began to think about that what are
[1:56:46] we going to do how are we going to let's
[1:56:48] have a place
[1:56:50] that's Happy let's have a home for him
[1:56:52] to come back to they may not they may
[1:56:54] make their mistakes they will if the
[1:56:56] Lord carries and they get old enough
[1:56:57] this world is getting so vile how are we
[1:57:00] going to protect them from the death
[1:57:01] angel how are we going to keep them put
[1:57:03] the blood on the doorpost let there be a
[1:57:05] place where the gifts are still in
[1:57:07] operation
[1:57:09] they're oh god let's fight for that
[1:57:11] there be a place where the people of God
[1:57:13] still believe in Preachers

[1:57:18] speaking in tongues still believe in
[1:57:20] working for God still believe in
[1:57:21] fellowshipping with one another still
[1:57:23] believe in having Church those things
[1:57:24] matter
[1:57:26] children are raised like that hid in the
[1:57:29] house of God
[1:57:30] no matter where they get older
[1:57:34] I was so pleased

[1:57:37] shower today
[1:57:39] I was pleased with Nolan and Levi I'll
[1:57:42] butter you up now so we can
[1:57:45] preach at you later but I was very
[1:57:47] pleased that they wanted to go to church
[1:57:50] when you get old enough Levi and you
[1:57:52] want to get out on your own you want to
[1:57:53] go to church that means something
[1:57:57] hide your children away in the house of
[1:57:59] God
[1:58:01] let them be around Christian people yeah
[1:58:05] how am I going to protect look at the
[1:58:06] school so look what it is hide them in
[1:58:08] the house of God every chance you get to
[1:58:11] put your children in church put them in
[1:58:12] church
[1:58:14] I'm gonna be a church let them be in the
[1:58:16] presence of God and when you're not when
[1:58:18] you're not in church let your home be a
[1:58:20] sanctuary
[1:58:23] you can't replace the church but it
[1:58:24] could be a place that they can go on to
[1:58:26] come back to
[1:58:28] you God help us today
[1:58:31] Ahab wasn't really a bad fellow
[1:58:33] he just couldn't make up his mind
[1:58:37] what he wanted to do
[1:58:39] in Joshua 24 15 Joshua speaks to the
[1:58:42] people there and he said it may seem
[1:58:43] evil and you to serve the Lord if it
[1:58:45] does choose you this day whom you will
[1:58:47] serve
[1:58:48] choose who you're going to serve whether
[1:58:50] the gods which your father served or on
[1:58:51] the other side of the flood go back to
[1:58:53] the gods of the amorites and whose land
[1:58:55] you dwell go back to the denomination go
[1:58:57] out in the world
[1:58:58] but that's for me and my house
[1:59:01] we will serve the Lord
[1:59:04] oh God give us men like that today give
[1:59:07] us men that will stand up
[1:59:09] give us preachers that will stand up as
[1:59:11] for me in my house we will hide our
[1:59:13] children in the house of God
[1:59:16] if I have any influence over my nephews
[1:59:18] over my nieces over over my
[1:59:19] grandchildren if the Lord tarries let me
[1:59:21] hide them in the house of God
[1:59:23] every opportunity I get let me take them
[1:59:25] to church it's hard and they're little
[1:59:27] they're a little bit he was little he
[1:59:28] become King when he was seven
[1:59:31] it made a difference in his life
[1:59:34] but Branham tells us you can't be as
[1:59:36] good a Christian and not go to church
[1:59:40] let's hide them in the house of God
[1:59:43] you bow your heads with me
[1:59:46] I know it's hard some of you sitting at
[1:59:48] home sick hearing a sermon about going
[1:59:50] to church but I know you want to be here
[1:59:52] I know that's difficult but I believe
[1:59:54] the Lord
[1:59:55] he wouldn't let me get away from this
[1:59:57] for some reason
[1:59:58] maybe it's for you sitting here this
[2:00:00] morning you did come
[2:00:02] but why did you come
[2:00:04] because you felt like you're on the
[2:00:05] Chain Gang well we got to go to church
[2:00:06] today
[2:00:08] is there something in your heart oh God
[2:00:11] I I want I want to be in your presence
[2:00:13] oh Lord
[2:00:15] I just can't handle not being in the
[2:00:18] word
[2:00:20] I may not like the preacher that much I
[2:00:22] mean I like everybody else in the flesh
[2:00:25] maybe they have conflict there may be
[2:00:26] things going on but I just want to be in
[2:00:28] the word
[2:00:30] there's a desire inside of me I want to
[2:00:32] I want to feel your presence come I want
[2:00:35] you to brood over my life I I want there
[2:00:37] to be something there why didn't you
[2:00:39] come today
[2:00:41] you just well I want to keep my children
[2:00:42] in church well that's a good thing it's
[2:00:44] a noble thing
[2:00:45] but how much more would it be if you
[2:00:47] could just say oh God I want to be here
[2:00:50] because you're here I wanted to meet you
[2:00:52] here today
[2:00:53] I wanted this I want this to be a part
[2:00:55] of my life you young couples make it a
[2:00:57] commitment you young people my own
[2:00:59] children maybe the oldest of the young
[2:01:01] people and some of the others sitting
[2:01:02] here but but those young people Peter
[2:01:05] and Esther have thought about them
[2:01:07] Peter Esther keep keep saying the house
[2:01:09] of God I've hid you in the house of God
[2:01:12] but you're going to get to an age where
[2:01:13] I can't do that anymore
[2:01:15] stay in the house of God you'll make
[2:01:17] mistakes but go to church
[2:01:20] you'll you'll you'll fail but read your
[2:01:22] Bible go to church live for God
[2:01:25] sometimes the preaching will cut deep
[2:01:28] sometimes it'll hurt but go to church
[2:01:30] live for God walk in the house of God
[2:01:35] this is not my words today it's God
[2:01:37] God's trying to tell us go to church

[2:01:43] yeah I mean that's just simple I don't
[2:01:45] mean everybody I want to hear something

[2:02:20] David in the seventh seal
[2:02:23] he said one thing I belonged after
[2:02:26] one thing I've desired
[2:02:28] to dwell in the house of the Lord all
[2:02:30] the days of my life
[2:02:33] I don't want to leave your presence oh
[2:02:35] God
[2:02:36] don't take me away from your presence
[2:02:40] why did he cry after he committed that
[2:02:42] great sin after he murdered and
[2:02:43] committed adultery but even that it was
[2:02:45] a man after God's Own Heart he cried out
[2:02:47] to God he said God
[2:02:48] don't cast me away from your presence
[2:02:53] Moses put us this way he said if your
[2:02:55] presence doesn't go don't let me go
[2:02:59] we have that kind of affinity today for
[2:03:02] the presence of the Lord is there
