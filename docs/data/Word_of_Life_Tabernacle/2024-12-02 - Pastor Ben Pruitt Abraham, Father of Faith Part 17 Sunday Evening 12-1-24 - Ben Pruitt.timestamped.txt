[51:34] house that's made it's in the heavens
[51:37] and he said we have one waiting there
[51:40] we're we're earnestly Desiring for that
[51:42] we want to be changed I think that's why
[51:44] we we want to improve things I know I
[51:46] drive people crazy here at the church
[51:47] because we're always changing stuff and
[51:49] trying to fix stuff and make it worse
[51:51] for a while and make it better for a
[51:53] while and we're always trying to do
[51:54] something I think that speaks of a
[51:56] change we're we're looking for something
[51:59] we're not happy just exactly where you
[52:01] are I know a lot of people want a better
[52:03] house or better car or more money
[52:06] there's a change you want to see change
[52:08] you want better health you want better
[52:10] things but there's better times coming
[52:13] how many believe that church listen Paul
[52:15] said if we if we only have hope in this
[52:17] life we are of all men most miserable
[52:21] but if we have hope in this life we can
[52:23] look forward to a change we can look
[52:26] forward we we have hope in the other in
[52:28] the life beyond the grave we can look
[52:29] forward to a time when things will be
[52:32] different and all wrongs will be made
[52:35] right and every knot that's been tied on
[52:38] this side will be untied over there and
[52:40] I'm so grateful for that church because
[52:42] I recognize there's some things I can't
[52:45] fix I know that there's some things that
[52:46] no matter how hard I try no matter how
[52:48] much counseling I do how much work that
[52:51] I do how even in myself there I'm going
[52:53] to get older there's something as much
[52:55] as I try to improve and do better and
[52:57] and whatever it is that I try to do I'm
[52:59] going to I you're just marching towards
[53:01] the grave but you also know that there's
[53:04] something better coming there's a better
[53:05] day coming there's a better place to go
[53:08] to I don't want us to get bogged down in
[53:10] this world too long we don't need to get
[53:11] our focus on what's going on down here
[53:14] and on each other and our problems and
[53:16] all situations we need to look and see
[53:18] that there's something coming for the
[53:20] believer that's far beyond anything he
[53:22] said eye is not seen ear is not heard
[53:25] neither can be contained in the even in
[53:27] the mind of a man what God has waiting
[53:29] for those oh I believe that tonight at
[53:33] some point it's got to become real to us
[53:35] at some point it's got to be more than
[53:36] just a story at some point it's got to
[53:38] be a reality we believe God's going to
[53:41] do something he has done something for
[53:44] us amen excuse me
[53:48] tonight before Abraham and Sarah could
[53:51] have a child it goes without saying
[53:53] something had to happen
[53:57] now we know that Abraham
[54:00] journeyed from the place where he was
[54:03] this is how we know that something
[54:05] happened right something happened right
[54:08] after the angel spoke to him how many
[54:11] know that that angel was a type that the
[54:14] one that came to him Elohim in a body it
[54:16] was a type that happened in our age of
[54:19] the revealing of the son of man right
[54:21] we've seen that Ministry in our time
[54:24] right we've experienced that we're not
[54:26] looking for that that
[54:28] happened right so now something happened
[54:31] between then and Genesis chapter 20
[54:35] because Genesis 19 Genesis 18 tells the
[54:37] story of the of the three strangers
[54:39] Genesis 19 tells the story of of lot and
[54:42] Sodom and Genesis 20 tells the story of
[54:45] Abraham taking a
[54:47] journey a really long journey through
[54:50] desert
[54:52] country now remember at this time he's a
[54:54] hundred years old
[54:57] and Sarah is
[54:59] 90 now I know 100 ain't what it used to
[55:03] be but people were stronger back then
[55:06] but not that much
[55:08] stronger right because the Bible tells
[55:10] us that they were well stricken in age
[55:12] and I don't think you need that
[55:13] explained to you I think we all know
[55:15] what that
[55:16] means right he looked and acted like an
[55:19] old man she looked and acted like a
[55:21] young woman and that's why she responded
[55:23] the way that she did the way that all of
[55:25] us did or would or any thinking person
[55:27] would if they were presented with this
[55:28] idea you're going to have a baby and she
[55:31] laughed and we would laugh
[55:33] too cuz she's 90 years
[55:37] old and again I don't have to tell some
[55:39] of y'all what 90 looks like I'm going to
[55:42] pick on sister Fritz I think she went
[55:44] home is she still here she went home and
[55:47] sister Fritz was here this morning she
[55:48] said I had a bad night but I'm going to
[55:50] have a good day and I thank God for
[55:52] people like that thank the
[55:54] Lord but she's 91 I believe can you
[55:58] imagine for a moment right now she's
[56:02] going to take a 300M Journey from from
[56:05] where they were to guar they're going to
[56:09] go into this country and when they go
[56:11] into this country look at that next
[56:12] verse I think I've got the next verse on
[56:14] there when they go into this country
[56:16] Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my
[56:20] sister now I don't think if she looked
[56:24] 90 at that time he'd be too worried
[56:26] about
[56:30] it right I'm not saying anything against
[56:33] our elderly early folks but but you're
[56:36] just not too worried about it but the
[56:38] reason he's concerned remember it
[56:41] happened
[56:42] before and and and he's concerned
[56:45] because she's
[56:48] beautiful she's not old
[56:51] anymore and so he's 100 years old she's
[56:55] 90 and he said she is my sister and
[56:57] ailec king of grar sent and took Sarah
[57:00] but God came to ailec in a Dream by
[57:02] night and said to him behold thou are
[57:03] but a dead man for the woman which the
[57:06] woman which I was taken she is a man's
[57:09] wife now think about it she's
[57:11] 90 she's granny Fritz's
[57:14] age right she's just a little bit older
[57:16] than brother Bill and sister
[57:19] Karen think about it for a minute and
[57:22] Abraham said we got to lie that flat out
[57:25] lie or tell a half truth
[57:28] anyway and and AMC the king a young king
[57:31] he's going to stand there and he's
[57:32] looking around just minding his own
[57:34] business and here come these Travelers
[57:35] through and he sees a 90-year-old woman
[57:37] you know kind of hobbling through and
[57:40] she's got her shaww on she's got a she
[57:42] got a cane you know and she just barely
[57:44] able to make it you know shaking down
[57:46] through the oh you know Abraham I don't
[57:48] know if I'm going be able to make the
[57:49] rest of this journey and Abraham said oh
[57:52] my she's
[57:54] beautiful I keep imagine AMC the king
[57:57] saying that look at that oh my I think I
[57:59] want that for a wife he wasn't saying
[58:00] that about a 90-year-old woman something
[58:05] happened right now look this happened
[58:09] after after they were well stricken in
[58:12] age after they'd received the promise of
[58:14] a child and they go down to a place that
[58:18] they couldn't have gotten to at that age
[58:20] and and something happened that couldn't
[58:22] have happened at that age and and and
[58:24] and the King wanted to marry Grandma so
[58:26] brother Brown uses the absurdity of that
[58:28] statement he says
[58:30] ridiculous nonsense she wasn't a little
[58:34] grandma oh my God turned her back to a
[58:37] young beautiful woman again he said
[58:40] that's what he's going to do to every
[58:42] one of you in the Rapture think about it
[58:44] church every one of
[58:46] you
[58:48] Hallelujah she got she was so beautiful
[58:50] that a king said hey I want her to be my
[58:53] wife well I tell you what that's what
[58:55] God's doing for every one of
[58:57] us brother brand says God don't patch up
[59:01] nothing he just made a brand new
[59:05] Sarah hallelujah oh I think this ought
[59:08] to make us rejoice tonight he just made
[59:10] a brand new Sarah to show what he's
[59:13] going to do to all you old
[59:16] women Hallelujah some of these times
[59:21] that'll believe on the Lord
[59:23] Jesus Hallelujah
[59:27] look now Abraham and Sarah were old
[59:29] people it's all right to confess I'm
[59:33] old but I'm not going to be old for
[59:37] long I'm old I'm getting older my body's
[59:40] failing but it's not going to be that
[59:41] way for I know you young people don't
[59:42] know what I'm talking about but as you
[59:44] get older things start happening to you
[59:46] and all of you can confess that today
[59:48] things that you never expected to have
[59:50] to go through and you can't do what you
[59:51] always wanted and you're strong in your
[59:53] mind but weak in your body and you're
[59:54] unable to do what you used to do but
[59:56] there's coming a time you're going to be
[59:58] changed back and I'm glad I'm not going
[1:00:00] to be changed back to 40 I'm not going
[1:00:03] to be changed back to 309 I'm going to
[1:00:04] be changed back to Perfection to the
[1:00:07] moment when I was at my strongest to the
[1:00:09] picture that he had of me of the thought
[1:00:11] he thought towards me before the
[1:00:12] foundation of the
[1:00:14] world
[1:00:18] Hallelujah Bible said they were well
[1:00:19] stricken in age he said now what he
[1:00:22] proved through Abraham and what he did
[1:00:23] for Abraham and Sarah he's going to do
[1:00:26] I want you to take this promise and just
[1:00:28] grab a hold of it tonight take it and
[1:00:30] grab a hold of it and say this is for me
[1:00:32] you young people you may not understand
[1:00:33] why this is important but you will one
[1:00:35] day take a hold of it and grab a hold of
[1:00:37] it and say this is for me this is what's
[1:00:39] going to happen for me he's going to do
[1:00:42] for all of Abraham's seed and he taught
[1:00:43] us he said read it like a love letter
[1:00:45] read between the lines right because it
[1:00:47] doesn't say her body changed but it had
[1:00:49] to have
[1:00:50] changed right and thank God for a
[1:00:52] prophet who could reveal that to us so
[1:00:55] and so that something that we believe as
[1:00:57] message people you're not going to find
[1:00:58] that taught in a Baptist Church or a
[1:00:59] Methodist Church or somewhere else we
[1:01:01] find that we believe that we believe the
[1:01:03] scripture shows us that but a prophet
[1:01:04] had to reveal
[1:01:06] it so he said I can just imagine Abraham
[1:01:09] the next morning now when did it happen
[1:01:12] after the angel
[1:01:14] came I want you to get this understand
[1:01:16] it was the next
[1:01:18] thing the body change is the next thing
[1:01:21] hold that in your heart the next thing
[1:01:24] to happen after
[1:01:26] the after the angel came to uh and
[1:01:29] revealed the secrets of Sarah's heart
[1:01:31] the next thing brother BR said he woke
[1:01:33] up the next morning getting up saying
[1:01:35] why Sarah you know what why say your
[1:01:39] wrinkles are going out of your
[1:01:42] face might have thought he had a
[1:01:44] stranger just earlier you know you get
[1:01:46] old and things are different you know I
[1:01:49] see my brother a couple times a year and
[1:01:50] lives in ill Illinois and he was up here
[1:01:52] today and he come and knocked on my door
[1:01:54] to tell me goodbye tonight and I didn't
[1:01:56] immediately go to it and I I walked over
[1:01:59] there and I saw him walking away I saw
[1:02:01] the back and I said hello there's
[1:02:03] something you wanted I didn't realize
[1:02:04] who it
[1:02:06] was I didn't even know him from from
[1:02:08] behind I thought oh my I think that's
[1:02:11] what it's going to be maybe when we look
[1:02:13] at each other before we realize even
[1:02:15] that we've been changed we're going to
[1:02:18] look at one another and say hey wait a
[1:02:20] minute weren't you old
[1:02:27] you know some people are actually going
[1:02:29] to gain years but that's a thought for
[1:02:31] another
[1:02:33] day it's true
[1:02:36] though but you going look by The Herald
[1:02:38] and just all of a sudden like wait a
[1:02:40] minute the hair is the same
[1:02:43] but weren't you old why Sarah you know
[1:02:46] what why I say your wrinkles are going
[1:02:48] out of your face oh my I wonder what
[1:02:51] kind of wrinkle cream she used
[1:02:56] she saidwell Dad look you know what that
[1:02:59] stoop in your shoulders coming out they
[1:03:02] was turning back God can do all things
[1:03:06] somebody believe that
[1:03:07] tonight brother brand says what's the
[1:03:10] next thing after this sign goes away now
[1:03:14] this is a this is a teaching that'll
[1:03:15] keep you out of a lot of trouble when
[1:03:17] people come to you and say this is what
[1:03:19] you should be looking for this is the
[1:03:20] bride's Revival this is what you ought
[1:03:22] to look for what's the next thing after
[1:03:25] the sign goes away God's going to
[1:03:29] condition Abraham's children you realize
[1:03:32] what he's doing for us now he's changing
[1:03:34] the inside so that we can be ready to be
[1:03:37] changed on the outside that's why we
[1:03:39] come and hear the word that's why the
[1:03:41] message is never going to go out of
[1:03:42] style that's why we never need to quit
[1:03:44] preaching it we don't ever need to quit
[1:03:46] getting into the word and digging into
[1:03:48] the Mysteries that why do we dig into
[1:03:50] these things why do we give you why do I
[1:03:51] read so many quotes it's because this
[1:03:53] message is feeding our Insight it's
[1:03:55] changing us to make us ready to be
[1:03:58] changed on the outside God is
[1:04:00] conditioning Abraham's children getting
[1:04:02] us ready to receive the promised son you
[1:04:04] come to church you didn't even realize
[1:04:06] it but God's getting you ready for
[1:04:08] something he's conditioning you because
[1:04:11] we didn't have the character to to go we
[1:04:13] didn't have the ability but God is
[1:04:15] conditioning us making us ready oh my
[1:04:19] making us ready now look he said how are
[1:04:22] we going to receive him we can't receive
[1:04:24] him in these bodies we're going to meet
[1:04:26] him in the air praise God forever the
[1:04:29] trumpet shall sound the dead in Christ
[1:04:31] shall rise and we shall go up to meet
[1:04:33] him in the air what's he doing the last
[1:04:37] sign before the Transfiguration the last
[1:04:39] sign before the Rapture for most any
[1:04:42] time the atomic bomb is going to destroy
[1:04:44] the world before it scream into this
[1:04:46] case Jesus is coming amen we which are
[1:04:50] alive and remain shall not prevent or
[1:04:52] hinder those that are asleep dead but
[1:04:54] the trumpet of God shall s the dead in
[1:04:56] Christ rise which our alive should be
[1:04:57] changed in a moment of the twinkling of
[1:04:59] an eye an old man will be
[1:05:02] young
[1:05:04] Hallelujah I've never been able to
[1:05:06] fellowship with some of you in a young
[1:05:07] body either because you're younger than
[1:05:09] me and I'm old or because you're older
[1:05:11] than me and you're old
[1:05:15] older but one day we'll Fellowship in
[1:05:19] similar
[1:05:20] bodies around the same
[1:05:23] age oh my look
[1:05:26] look what he says now he says an old man
[1:05:28] will be young an old woman will be young
[1:05:30] again and we'll be conditioned to meet
[1:05:32] the promised coming son he said Glory
[1:05:36] Hallelujah the next thing in God's
[1:05:40] order
[1:05:41] Hallelujah the next
[1:05:43] thing then what God called me to do keep
[1:05:46] up the conditioning preach the word amen
[1:05:49] preach the word if I die and go by way
[1:05:51] of the grave and God raises up another
[1:05:52] generation preach the word you young men
[1:05:55] what do we do what can we do preach the
[1:05:56] word people will come and go revivals
[1:05:59] will come and go the churches will rise
[1:06:01] and fall men will come and go great men
[1:06:04] will come great men will go families
[1:06:06] will come together and be torn apart
[1:06:08] sickness will come all kinds of things
[1:06:10] will happen what are we doing the next
[1:06:11] thing is the body change we just keep
[1:06:13] doing what we're doing and during the
[1:06:15] delay we don't start smiting one another
[1:06:17] we don't start preaching at one another
[1:06:19] we don't start yelling and screaming at
[1:06:21] one another and causing each other
[1:06:22] problems what do we do we keep preaching
[1:06:24] the word we keep doing what God called
[1:06:26] us to do we keep living the word and one
[1:06:29] day one morning we're going to be
[1:06:31] changed you said when it's going to
[1:06:33] happen brother man I don't have a clue
[1:06:34] when it's going to happen but I know
[1:06:36] this this the next
[1:06:41] thing
[1:06:42] Hallelujah Paul gives us the the
[1:06:45] doctrine of the resurrection and Body
[1:06:46] Change in 1 Corinthians 15 I don't have
[1:06:48] time to read all this but would be good
[1:06:50] to go read it if you have time but in 1
[1:06:53] Corinthians 15:12 brother or Paul says
[1:06:55] now if Christ be preached and he rose
[1:06:57] from the dead how say some among you
[1:07:00] that there is no resurrection of the
[1:07:01] dead but if there be no there were
[1:07:03] idiots back then too I'm
[1:07:05] sorry sorry
[1:07:08] kids come on Church there have always
[1:07:11] been stupid
[1:07:18] people I don't know of another way to
[1:07:20] put it and there always will be they're
[1:07:23] going to come up with all kinds of
[1:07:24] nonsense
[1:07:26] he said if there be no resurrection of
[1:07:27] the Dead Christ is not risen right and
[1:07:30] if Christ be not risen then is our
[1:07:32] preaching Vain and your faith is also
[1:07:34] vain yay and we are found false
[1:07:36] Witnesses of God because we've testified
[1:07:38] of God that he raised up Christ whom he
[1:07:39] raised not up it so be that the dead
[1:07:41] raised not for if the dead rise not then
[1:07:44] is not Christ raised and if Christ be
[1:07:45] not raised your faith is vain you're yet
[1:07:47] in your sins so it took more than the
[1:07:50] death and burial of Christ it took the
[1:07:51] resurrection of Christ because it was
[1:07:54] the resurrection of Christ that show us
[1:07:55] that the death worked and the burial oh
[1:07:57] church that that was effective for our
[1:08:00] sins anybody can die on a cross but no
[1:08:02] one but him could be raised again on the
[1:08:05] third
[1:08:06] day right he was the first fruits of
[1:08:08] that Resurrection so he says he said uh
[1:08:12] if Christ be not raised your dead and
[1:08:13] your sins then they also which are
[1:08:15] fallen asleep in Christ or perish I've
[1:08:17] already quoted this but if if in this
[1:08:19] life only we have hope in Christ we are
[1:08:20] of all men most miserable but now it's
[1:08:24] Christ risen from the dead
[1:08:25] become the first fruits of them that
[1:08:27] slept for Since By Man Came Death by man
[1:08:30] came also the resurrection of the Dead
[1:08:31] for as in Adam all die even so in Christ
[1:08:33] shall all be made alive but every man in
[1:08:36] his own order now notice there's an
[1:08:39] order to the resurrection and and the
[1:08:40] body change the Rapture he said Christ
[1:08:43] the first fruits afterward they that are
[1:08:46] Christ at his coming so brother brandom
[1:08:49] puts it this way and I just want to go
[1:08:51] through some things he said about it and
[1:08:52] kind of just feed us on that it's okay
[1:08:55] just eat for a little bit he said his
[1:08:58] great glorious presence shall strike the
[1:09:01] Earth he cometh in clouds he said oh I
[1:09:04] love that clouds there will be wave
[1:09:07] after wave of his glory will come across
[1:09:10] the earth and the resurrection of the
[1:09:12] Saints shall
[1:09:14] come Hallelujah he said when that
[1:09:17] blessed holy spirit that lived in their
[1:09:19] hearts and they died you see young
[1:09:22] people why it's so important to have the
[1:09:24] Holy Ghost yeah right because you can't
[1:09:26] go it's like the Chinese Laundry he said
[1:09:28] when they tore the ticket apart he said
[1:09:30] it had to you had to have the matching
[1:09:32] ticket or you couldn't get your clothes
[1:09:33] back right and you can't go in the
[1:09:35] Rapture unless your your spirit that's
[1:09:37] in you matches his
[1:09:38] Spirit right because that's what it is
[1:09:41] the holy spirit that's what raises you
[1:09:43] up and so he said when that blessed Holy
[1:09:45] Spirit that's lived in their hearts and
[1:09:46] they died with their corpse laying there
[1:09:48] and the tear stains over their cheeks
[1:09:49] and things like that and they're placed
[1:09:51] out here in the graveyard he said a
[1:09:53] great wave of that same
[1:09:56] Spirit Church you wonder why we enjoy
[1:09:58] church so much don't tell me we love God
[1:10:00] too he said whether been your
[1:10:01] Pentecostal no I just love him with all
[1:10:03] of my heart don't tell me I can't
[1:10:05] worship him don't tell me I can't raise
[1:10:07] my hands don't tell me I'm too loud when
[1:10:09] I know that the same spirit that he lets
[1:10:11] me feel here one of these days is going
[1:10:13] to take me up one of these days is going
[1:10:15] to lift me out of my condition and make
[1:10:17] me a brand new man are you with me he's
[1:10:20] coming for that that ought to give all
[1:10:22] of us hope that same holy spirit that we
[1:10:25] feel right now wave after wave he
[1:10:28] says hallelujah he said a wave after
[1:10:31] wave he said they're placed out here in
[1:10:32] the graveyard a great wave of that same
[1:10:34] spirit and whoosh wave after wave he
[1:10:38] that was last will be first he that was
[1:10:40] first will be last how can it be that
[1:10:42] way that's the order of the Resurrection
[1:10:45] he said I won't know nobody in the
[1:10:46] generation before me or the generation
[1:10:48] after me I'll know those in the
[1:10:51] generation of this so now here's here's
[1:10:53] a detail he's given us about the
[1:10:55] resurrection it's important we'll be
[1:10:58] raised with people we
[1:11:00] know right you'll recognize the people
[1:11:02] you
[1:11:05] see now church I know we all want to see
[1:11:09] the prophet you know we all want to be a
[1:11:10] but but you'll be raised with your own
[1:11:12] generation people you knew thank you
[1:11:15] Lord for some of you you've lost a
[1:11:16] spouse that's the first one you'll see
[1:11:18] thank you Lord right some of you lost a
[1:11:21] child be the first one you see
[1:11:25] huh you be raised with
[1:11:28] you God knows what he's doing he said I
[1:11:32] won't know nobody in the generation
[1:11:33] before me the generation after me I'll
[1:11:35] know those in the generation of this see
[1:11:36] if I rais this by the brandom's
[1:11:37] generation and and just that's the first
[1:11:40] ones I see I won't know a lot of them
[1:11:42] I've only seen some of them in pictures
[1:11:44] and most of them I don't know but I'm
[1:11:46] raised with my own generation so I'll be
[1:11:48] raised in and there'll be a few folks
[1:11:51] from Christian Tabernacle there and me
[1:11:53] but I knew them see so I might I see
[1:11:55] them oh there's brother you know some of
[1:11:58] the brothers and sisters we've seen
[1:11:59] around here that we buried right that
[1:12:02] I've known some of the older the
[1:12:03] ministers that come before me right that
[1:12:06] have gone on brother John LEF Fontaine
[1:12:07] was here for many years and and several
[1:12:09] years and he's gone now I believe I'll
[1:12:11] see him because I knew him maybe his
[1:12:14] family will see him first but I'll see
[1:12:15] him I'll see those that I knew we begin
[1:12:18] to get together we'll see people oh
[1:12:20] Church ones you were close to ones that
[1:12:22] meant something to you
[1:12:26] Hallelujah and they'll come up they'll
[1:12:29] come up and and he said here he said
[1:12:32] they're placed down great great he that
[1:12:33] was last to be first he said I want
[1:12:35] nobody in the generation before me the
[1:12:36] generation after me I'll know there in a
[1:12:37] generation of this every generation will
[1:12:39] come successfully right as it went down
[1:12:41] he said they which were last will be
[1:12:42] first sure it has to be see I'll know my
[1:12:44] people I believe every one of you I'm
[1:12:47] going to see you if you go by way of the
[1:12:48] Grave before the end or if I go by way
[1:12:50] of the Grave we're going to see one
[1:12:51] another whoever's alive is going to see
[1:12:53] first the one that's raised and then we
[1:12:55] look down realize we've been
[1:12:58] changed
[1:12:59] hallelujah amen now look he said the
[1:13:01] next fell he said I know my people the
[1:13:03] next fellow my dad will know his people
[1:13:06] his grandfather his people on down like
[1:13:08] that wave after wave after wave after
[1:13:10] wave and the Saints arising from
[1:13:12] everywhere won't that be wonderful he
[1:13:15] said that makes the old people feel
[1:13:16] young
[1:13:17] again oh my see we've got to be changed
[1:13:21] Paul teaches us in 1 Corinthians 15:50
[1:13:23] he said now this I say brother flesh and
[1:13:25] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God
[1:13:28] and that would be a revelation some of
[1:13:30] you say well I've never been able to get
[1:13:31] my flesh and blood to really obey the
[1:13:35] gospel well they won't that's why you
[1:13:36] have to have the Holy
[1:13:38] Ghost that's why you can't serve God you
[1:13:40] can't say Jesus is Lord without the Holy
[1:13:43] Ghost why because he will not be Lord of
[1:13:45] your life unless there's some control
[1:13:47] tower controlling your body and your
[1:13:50] spirit right because if you don't have
[1:13:52] the Holy Ghost That Body and spirit's
[1:13:53] going to they're going to control you
[1:13:56] your emotions will control you right and
[1:13:59] with the Holy Ghost we have to let him
[1:14:01] then surrender to that because the
[1:14:03] outside part's still not saved it's just
[1:14:05] under
[1:14:06] control right so we still have to give
[1:14:09] in to the Holy Ghost surrender to the
[1:14:10] that's why it doesn't hurt us to come to
[1:14:12] the altar it doesn't hurt us to seek God
[1:14:14] it doesn't hurt come on church we may
[1:14:16] have been Christians for a long time but
[1:14:18] it doesn't hurt nothing to seek God and
[1:14:19] ask for prayer and say I just need help
[1:14:22] with something there have been a lot of
[1:14:23] things that's happened in your life
[1:14:24] would be lot better if you just asked
[1:14:26] for help down the line and said I just
[1:14:27] need somebody to pray with me I can't do
[1:14:30] it on my own I need help with this maybe
[1:14:32] you could ask the Lord I Lord I need a
[1:14:34] rebaptism of your spirit I need you to
[1:14:36] help me with this decision I need you to
[1:14:38] help me with the thing I'm going through
[1:14:40] because two-thirds of you is
[1:14:42] unsaved but if there's something on the
[1:14:44] inside that's been changed it'll control
[1:14:47] that right but now look he said Flesh
[1:14:51] and Blood can't inherit the kingdom of
[1:14:52] God neither does corruption inherit
[1:14:53] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[1:14:57] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:14:59] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[1:15:02] of an eye at the last Trump for the
[1:15:03] trumpet shall sound the dead shall be
[1:15:05] raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[1:15:08] changed for this corruptible must put on
[1:15:11] incorruption this Mortal must put on
[1:15:13] immortality it's not optional it's got
[1:15:15] to happen so when this corruptible shall
[1:15:18] I put on incorruption and this Mortal
[1:15:20] shall they put on immortality then shall
[1:15:21] be brought to pass the saying that is
[1:15:23] written death is swallowed up in Victory
[1:15:26] Oh my he gives us the order of the of
[1:15:28] the Rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 I
[1:15:30] would not have you to be ignorant
[1:15:31] Brethren concerning them which are
[1:15:32] asleep that you sorrow not even as
[1:15:34] others which have no hope for if we
[1:15:36] believe that Jesus died and rose again
[1:15:38] even so them also which sleep in Jesus
[1:15:41] will God bring with him for this we say
[1:15:44] unto you by the word of the Lord I know
[1:15:46] there's let me just stop here for a
[1:15:48] minute I know there's things people say
[1:15:49] well not everything Paul says matters I
[1:15:51] believe this
[1:15:53] mattered you want to leave this
[1:15:55] out I don't cuz what hope would we have
[1:16:00] of a Rapture without this promise we
[1:16:03] which are alive and remain shall not
[1:16:05] prevent them with I want that to be
[1:16:07] there I want that and I believe it's
[1:16:08] true so we don't want to take none of it
[1:16:10] out do we we don't want to take none of
[1:16:12] the message of the hour out how can we
[1:16:14] have hope unless we believe all of it we
[1:16:17] believe what he said we may not
[1:16:19] understand it we may not be able to fit
[1:16:21] this with this and that with that but we
[1:16:22] let it go we realize that if he's a word
[1:16:24] Prophet it's got to come from the
[1:16:25] scripture so there's something there
[1:16:27] maybe we don't understand but we say
[1:16:29] Lord give me an understanding because I
[1:16:31] know it's a promise of your word and it
[1:16:34] must be
[1:16:35] true right so we don't question those
[1:16:37] things we just believe God we believe
[1:16:40] his word and we believe that this is
[1:16:42] what Paul wrote now he said the Lord
[1:16:44] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:16:45] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:16:47] with the trumpet of God the dead in
[1:16:48] Christ shall rise
[1:16:50] first he said then we which are alive
[1:16:52] and remain should be caught up together
[1:16:54] with them in the cloud CLS remember
[1:16:56] brother brand explains that he said
[1:16:58] Cloud wave after wave of his glory to
[1:17:00] meet the Lord in the air and so shall we
[1:17:02] ever be with the Lord Brother brand said
[1:17:05] we watch the order of the Resurrection
[1:17:07] the first thing we get together not
[1:17:10] until we get together will we go
[1:17:12] together to meet him mothers and fathers
[1:17:16] will meet one another children and loved
[1:17:19] ones will meet one another then be
[1:17:21] caught up in the air to meet the Lord I
[1:17:25] know there's a doctrine of brother
[1:17:27] brandham is going to come back in a
[1:17:28] private pre- Resurrection Resurrection
[1:17:31] but that's not what brother brandham
[1:17:32] taught
[1:17:33] us right he didn't teach us that he said
[1:17:35] I'll come up with my generation right
[1:17:38] right and he'll come to his loved ones
[1:17:40] and we'll come with our loved ones and
[1:17:41] then we'll all be caught up together but
[1:17:43] at the time that we come up we don't
[1:17:46] have to worry about hearing any more
[1:17:47] Doctrine I know there people don't want
[1:17:49] to hear Doctrine today I still need
[1:17:50] doctrine because I haven't been
[1:17:52] changed right I still need to hear the
[1:17:54] word word because I still need there
[1:17:56] something God's conditioning inside of
[1:17:58] me but there will come a day I don't
[1:17:59] need to hear no more
[1:18:00] Doctrine when is that the moment I'm
[1:18:03] changed that' be the last time I ever
[1:18:05] need to go to
[1:18:08] church now we'll get together and
[1:18:10] worship but that's not now I need to go
[1:18:12] to church why I want to change I want to
[1:18:14] get better but then I'll be
[1:18:16] changed glory to God and so there'll
[1:18:20] come a day we don't need preachers no
[1:18:21] more but until we do let's keep
[1:18:23] preaching let's keep doing what God
[1:18:25] called us to do there'll come a day we
[1:18:26] don't need it but there there's a time
[1:18:28] now when we need to be conditioned for
[1:18:30] the Rapture he said then we stand there
[1:18:33] singing Redemption ssongs and angels
[1:18:36] with a circle around the earth will
[1:18:37] stand with bowed heads not knowing what
[1:18:40] they're talking
[1:18:42] about they never was lost they don't
[1:18:45] know what it means to be lost and to be
[1:18:46] found but Lord we know what it means I
[1:18:49] once was lost but now I'm found what
[1:18:51] blind but now I see you may not believe
[1:18:53] in dancing or shouting but I'll tell
[1:18:54] what you will then because you'll know
[1:18:56] what it's like to come all the way from
[1:18:58] what you were if a worm could become
[1:19:01] human I'm sure he'd be excited about it
[1:19:03] because in his condition as a worm he
[1:19:05] don't even he can't even grasp the
[1:19:06] concept of what it was to be human and
[1:19:08] in our condition of these bodies we
[1:19:10] don't even grasp the concept of what
[1:19:12] it's like to be in that new glorious
[1:19:14] body but it'll be there it's real
[1:19:16] friends it's real we need to do
[1:19:19] everything we can to condition ourselves
[1:19:20] to be there how can we do that only by
[1:19:23] the blood by the grace of God
[1:19:25] by the word that he's
[1:19:27] provided
[1:19:28] hallelujah hallelujah I got to slow
[1:19:32] down
[1:19:34] listen and some of y'all thinking no
[1:19:36] speed up speed
[1:19:38] up I want to get through this he said
[1:19:42] they never was lost they don't know but
[1:19:44] I was lost so I can
[1:19:47] sing he said then remember if we go
[1:19:49] before he comes we will be up and in his
[1:19:52] presence or raised before the others are
[1:19:55] changed the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:19:57] sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:19:58] first he said then we which alive and
[1:20:00] remain shall be changed in a moment in
[1:20:03] the twinkling of an eye and be caught up
[1:20:05] together with them to meet the Lord in
[1:20:07] the air look at the order of the
[1:20:10] Resurrection see God knows that we long
[1:20:12] to see our loved ones
[1:20:15] amen look at that God knows that and if
[1:20:20] we go got there to meet him first we'd
[1:20:23] be looking around to see if mom or dad
[1:20:25] and the rest of them was there
[1:20:30] right I thought of your dad and you
[1:20:33] raise your hand back there brother Bobby
[1:20:35] used to sit here in the church we're
[1:20:36] going to see him one of these days but
[1:20:38] see if you went straight to see Jesus
[1:20:40] you you'd wonder if he made it are you
[1:20:44] with me and we believe brother Bobby's
[1:20:46] there but we but what does he do he lets
[1:20:47] you see him
[1:20:51] first glory to God it's a reality
[1:20:57] Church you know we need to inform
[1:21:00] ourselves of this see this believing
[1:21:03] this doesn't produce dryed religion
[1:21:06] doesn't produce dead cold formal
[1:21:08] religion but it produces a Living Hope a
[1:21:11] lively hope we've been resurrected in
[1:21:13] our souls and we're looking for
[1:21:15] resurrection of the body I love the old
[1:21:17] songs cuz many of the old songs were
[1:21:19] about heaven and they talked about
[1:21:20] heaven because the people had it so
[1:21:22] rough and now we live in a world where
[1:21:23] all we deal with is our complexes you
[1:21:26] know we talk about how we've been hurt
[1:21:27] and how this and that's happening I'm
[1:21:28] not trying to minimize that but I long
[1:21:30] for the day we can get back to realizing
[1:21:32] there's a better place and yeah we've
[1:21:34] been hurt but there's a place where
[1:21:35] we'll never be hurt again and yeah we've
[1:21:37] been through some things but there's a
[1:21:38] place where we'll never go through that
[1:21:40] again there's a place where there's none
[1:21:41] of
[1:21:44] that never be a
[1:21:49] misunderstanding never be a fight around
[1:21:51] the
[1:21:52] table now come on Church y'all
[1:21:55] human y'all just came through
[1:21:57] Thanksgiving
[1:22:00] too but there is coming a
[1:22:07] day you'll be able to get along with
[1:22:09] people because you'll be changed and
[1:22:10] they'll be
[1:22:13] changed glory to
[1:22:17] God he said but see how the holy spirit
[1:22:19] in his wisdom we meet one another first
[1:22:22] and then when we get there and sing amaz
[1:22:24] aming Grace that's when there's going to
[1:22:26] be a time of
[1:22:28] worship Hallelujah no wonder he said
[1:22:31] right before he preached the seals he
[1:22:32] was he was he was uh he was dedicating
[1:22:35] the new Tabernacle and he stood there
[1:22:36] and he said he said let's worship him
[1:22:38] here as if we were already there amen oh
[1:22:42] that's what I strive that's what we want
[1:22:43] to do that's what we want our worship to
[1:22:44] be like he said that's when there's
[1:22:46] going to be a time of worship he said
[1:22:48] you think I act funny now watch me up
[1:22:50] there it's going to be a wonderful time
[1:22:52] for me and all of us when we get there
[1:22:55] amen hallelujah brother BR said there's
[1:22:59] something in it that you feel on the
[1:23:02] inside of
[1:23:03] you your emotions
[1:23:06] pulsating now church I know it's not
[1:23:08] about emotions but listen to me emotions
[1:23:12] can be wrong you realize that if you
[1:23:14] were a business that there are
[1:23:16] counterfeit $100 bills how many knows
[1:23:18] that I don't have a $100 bill or I'd
[1:23:20] show you if somebody wants to give me
[1:23:21] one I'll show it to you
[1:23:24] but if you had a $100 bill like you
[1:23:26] don't you got one in your pocket don't
[1:23:27] you if you had a $100 if you had a $100
[1:23:30] bill and and you you you're standing
[1:23:33] there and as a business say well I know
[1:23:34] they counterfeit these so I just quit
[1:23:36] taking them well if you don't have a
[1:23:38] $100 bills you don't have a
[1:23:40] business right right so what do you do
[1:23:43] you learn to discern between the true
[1:23:45] and the
[1:23:46] false there bad there are bad emotions
[1:23:49] there are emotions that'll Lead You
[1:23:51] astray there are things about your five
[1:23:53] senses you can't go go by that right we
[1:23:55] go by the word right but there are
[1:23:58] emotions that we feel that are real
[1:24:01] there are there are pulsation there
[1:24:03] things that God influences us we feel
[1:24:05] and it's real When what when is it real
[1:24:07] when it lines up with the word if it's
[1:24:09] right with the word it's real right are
[1:24:12] you with me now so brother random tells
[1:24:14] us there's something in it that you feel
[1:24:16] on the inside of you your emotions
[1:24:18] pulsating knows that the kingdom of God
[1:24:21] is near at hand what is it it's that
[1:24:23] subconsciousness that of you you've been
[1:24:25] taught the word and you see the
[1:24:26] condition that the world's in and you
[1:24:28] see how you have to struggle every day
[1:24:30] and there's just something inside of you
[1:24:31] when you hear a sermon about the Rapture
[1:24:33] you hear about the coming of the Lord
[1:24:34] just something pulsates inside of you
[1:24:36] your emotions what is that is that all
[1:24:39] these things that we've talked about and
[1:24:40] wondered about is now fixing to take
[1:24:42] place he said some of us may fall asleep
[1:24:46] before that time comes but that will not
[1:24:49] prevent our Resurrection because it
[1:24:51] gives the privilege of coming before
[1:24:53] those changed the trumpet of God shall
[1:24:56] sound the dead and crash your rise first
[1:24:58] then we which are alive and remain he
[1:24:59] said did you notice the order of the
[1:25:00] Resurrection shall be caught up together
[1:25:01] with them we meet each other before we
[1:25:03] meet him be caught up together to meet
[1:25:05] them with them to meet the Lord in the
[1:25:06] air he said see he's God and then when
[1:25:09] he wants to be worshiped that's what his
[1:25:10] very nature is is to be worshiped
[1:25:12] because he's God and he knows if we were
[1:25:15] there now think about it for a minute he
[1:25:18] said Look by he by looking we'd be
[1:25:20] looking out of the corner of your eye to
[1:25:23] see if the other one is there now how
[1:25:26] does he know that about us cuz we do it
[1:25:29] here we're always looking to see what
[1:25:31] the other one's
[1:25:32] doing and if we got there without seeing
[1:25:35] our loved ones we'd be worshiping him
[1:25:38] but we'd be looking out the corner of
[1:25:40] our attention would be
[1:25:41] divided I want to know if Joe made it I
[1:25:43] want to know
[1:25:45] if Allen made it I want to know are you
[1:25:48] with
[1:25:49] me we our tension would be
[1:25:52] divided oh Church but he said he wants
[1:25:56] all of our worship he said see if the
[1:25:58] other one's there but then it wouldn't
[1:26:00] be the complete way of free
[1:26:03] worship when we stand there and we know
[1:26:06] we've met each other first and greeted
[1:26:09] each other and then to stand by him who
[1:26:13] caused it all amen and sing the songs of
[1:26:17] what will that be our worship will be
[1:26:18] free because we won't be sitting there
[1:26:20] wondering oh did this one make it did
[1:26:21] that one we'll
[1:26:22] know oh Church
[1:26:25] we'll know we'll have met them and we'll
[1:26:28] know and we'll go on in now brother bam
[1:26:30] has asked the question if the bride will
[1:26:32] all be in one place before the
[1:26:35] Rapture and church I know we get to hear
[1:26:38] things and people will tell you and it's
[1:26:40] been something we fought we are not a
[1:26:41] farm team for any other church that's
[1:26:44] right God we can raise up kids and keep
[1:26:46] them around I know jobs are hard and
[1:26:48] stuff but we might as well have church
[1:26:50] here and we might as well raise up a
[1:26:53] church there's plenty of people people
[1:26:54] in this area that believe the message
[1:26:55] and people that love God we we can have
[1:26:57] church we don't need to take a backseat
[1:27:00] to nobody and you'll have people come
[1:27:02] around and and and say well you need to
[1:27:04] go to this place or go to that place the
[1:27:06] the Revival's happening over here you
[1:27:08] want Revival get on your knees and start
[1:27:10] asking God for it and God Revival is
[1:27:12] starting you and go to somewhere
[1:27:13] somebody else but you don't have to sit
[1:27:16] there and and listen be battered by all
[1:27:18] this stuff and say well you know if
[1:27:20] you're over here go to our church and
[1:27:22] hear our pastor then you're going to
[1:27:23] make it no you're going to make it by
[1:27:25] the grace of God when you get there
[1:27:26] you're going to sing Amazing Grace how
[1:27:28] sweet to sound you will not make a
[1:27:30] Rapture cuz you heard me
[1:27:32] preach you'll make a Rapture because the
[1:27:34] message of the hour came which was a
[1:27:37] shout which was himself Christ
[1:27:39] descending in our age glory to God and
[1:27:42] the message called you and if I preach
[1:27:44] the message you'll hear from me if I
[1:27:46] don't preach the message God will take
[1:27:47] me out of the way and somebody else will
[1:27:48] preach
[1:27:50] it you bloom where God planted you and
[1:27:53] that is you know if if you want to go
[1:27:55] somewhere else you get fed better
[1:27:56] somewhere else God's feed I I I want you
[1:27:58] to get fed I want you to make it I'm not
[1:28:01] holding on to nobody but I'll say this I
[1:28:04] want to I want to live for God with all
[1:28:05] of my heart I I want to I want to love
[1:28:08] him with all of my heart I want to go I
[1:28:09] want to go not just with our church but
[1:28:11] I want every church I want people from
[1:28:13] every Church to go I know not
[1:28:14] everybody's going to make it but I want
[1:28:16] as many to make it as can make
[1:28:19] it so I'm not going to burn no Bridges
[1:28:22] I'm not going to cut nobody off
[1:28:25] huh cuz I want them to be
[1:28:28] saved I want them to make it that means
[1:28:30] more than any temporary discomfort that
[1:28:32] I might
[1:28:33] have are you with me
[1:28:37] now we want you to make
[1:28:41] it so he said if no they said will it be
[1:28:43] in one place and will it be in the west
[1:28:45] that's kind of a leading question isn't
[1:28:46] it and brother BR said no he said now
[1:28:50] the first thing happens when we're
[1:28:51] resurrected the ones which are living
[1:28:52] will just still remain the Resurrection
[1:28:54] will set in first the resurrection of
[1:28:55] those that are asleep there will be
[1:28:57] Awakening time and those which are
[1:28:59] asleep in the dust now not those that
[1:29:00] are asleep in sin cuz they sleep right
[1:29:02] on he said they don't wake for another
[1:29:04] thousand years that's at the white
[1:29:06] Throne judgment but those who are
[1:29:08] sleeping in the dust will be awakened
[1:29:10] first and these corruptible bodies will
[1:29:13] put on incorruption in the rapturing
[1:29:16] grace of the Lord and then we'll all get
[1:29:20] together and when they begin to get
[1:29:22] together then we which are livive and
[1:29:24] remain should be
[1:29:25] changed these mortal bodies will not see
[1:29:28] death but just of a
[1:29:32] sudden now we're going to get to it in a
[1:29:34] minute but you say what will I be doing
[1:29:36] brother Ben I don't know you might be
[1:29:38] sleeping but you'll be awakened you
[1:29:41] might be doing the dishes but something
[1:29:43] will happen you might be sitting in
[1:29:46] church right I don't know where you'll
[1:29:48] be you might be in jail for the for the
[1:29:50] gospel's sake obviously
[1:29:55] could the resurrection happen in a jail
[1:29:56] absolutely it could happen in a jail I
[1:29:59] never forget I've told you before
[1:30:00] there's a lady one time years ago you
[1:30:02] know we all were kind of
[1:30:04] legalists we we were come on it's all
[1:30:07] right a lot of us didn't understand
[1:30:09] Grace and lady told my mom one time we
[1:30:11] told her we'd been to Silver Dollar City
[1:30:12] and she said well what would happen if
[1:30:14] the Lord come and you were on a roller
[1:30:17] coaster I'd go
[1:30:20] up an old
[1:30:22] man and come down a young
[1:30:26] man I don't know what to say that right
[1:30:28] like that's what I'm going to that's
[1:30:30] what's going to be what what does it
[1:30:31] matter what you're doing I'll say this I
[1:30:33] think you'll be a Christian Living for
[1:30:34] the
[1:30:36] Lord but there there's all kinds of
[1:30:38] things and you say well brother Ben I'll
[1:30:40] get to a place where I don't make any
[1:30:41] mistakes well if you ever got to that
[1:30:43] place you'd already be
[1:30:46] raptured you would need a
[1:30:49] change right so you're not going to get
[1:30:52] up to a place you young people you're
[1:30:53] always going to make mistakes but you
[1:30:55] don't you learn from them you don't
[1:30:56] repeat them you don't go back and do it
[1:30:58] again learn from it move on do something
[1:31:00] different right but but you you don't
[1:31:03] you don't just keep repeating those
[1:31:05] things you want to learn from it but
[1:31:06] we're all going to make mistakes we're
[1:31:07] all going to have problems but but you
[1:31:10] say well I have sickness the the body
[1:31:12] will continue to get sick
[1:31:14] until in a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:31:17] eye Hallelujah you might catch a
[1:31:22] cold the devil put a virus on you and
[1:31:26] you're sitting there can you imagine oh
[1:31:28] I couldn't go like that you absolutely
[1:31:30] could you could I'm letting my
[1:31:31] imagination run away with me now but
[1:31:33] anyway you could be sitting there with
[1:31:35] the with the thing going in the room one
[1:31:38] a humidifier one corner and a
[1:31:39] dehumidifier in the other corner and
[1:31:41] Vick all over you and just gasping for
[1:31:45] breath and in a
[1:31:50] moment boy I feel better I tell you what
[1:31:52] that vix must have worked
[1:31:54] never did
[1:31:57] before all of the sudden I'm
[1:32:01] changed Oh my he said Hallelujah these
[1:32:05] mortal bodies will not see death but
[1:32:07] just of a sudden there'll be like a
[1:32:09] sweep go over us and you're changed
[1:32:11] you're turned back like Abraham was oh
[1:32:15] my from an old man to a young man from
[1:32:17] an old woman to a young woman what's
[1:32:20] this Sudden Change and after a while
[1:32:24] you're traveling like a
[1:32:26] thought and all and your loved ones will
[1:32:29] be as
[1:32:30] close as your
[1:32:33] thoughts
[1:32:35] Church
[1:32:39] Hallelujah some of y'all been through
[1:32:42] some things I know you haven't I'm not
[1:32:43] trying to play on your emotions tonight
[1:32:44] but I believe it I believe it's real
[1:32:47] you've lost some loved ones and some of
[1:32:48] y'all lost sister CLE lost I think five
[1:32:52] children
[1:32:54] six children six children sister cth has
[1:32:57] lost and you're not supposed to your
[1:32:59] children aren't supposed to go before
[1:33:00] you but one of these days they'll be as
[1:33:03] close as a thought right he said well
[1:33:06] brother Ben what if they all didn't make
[1:33:08] it you believe that they all made it
[1:33:10] don't ever put that thought in your mind
[1:33:12] that they didn't make it that they some
[1:33:13] no you believe that they made it what
[1:33:15] good does it do to you believe negative
[1:33:19] thoughts in a
[1:33:21] moment God gave me my children
[1:33:27] that's
[1:33:29] it Hallelujah we travel see I might not
[1:33:32] be thinking about your children but
[1:33:33] you'll be thinking about them you travel
[1:33:36] like a thought you can see those V which
[1:33:38] are already resurrected oh what an hour
[1:33:42] then we'll gather with them and then be
[1:33:44] caught up with them to meet the Lord in
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:47] air Hallelujah listen Luke 17:34 tells
[1:33:51] it like this I tell you in that night
[1:33:53] there shall be two two men in one bed
[1:33:55] one should be taken the other should be
[1:33:56] left so there's someone
[1:33:58] sleeping two women should be grinding
[1:34:01] together so there's someone awake on the
[1:34:03] other side of the earth one should be
[1:34:06] taken and the other left two men shall
[1:34:08] be in the field the one should be taken
[1:34:11] and the other left you say but brother
[1:34:12] Ben what did Brother Bran mean by 6:00
[1:34:14] to 9: in the morning we've explained the
[1:34:16] watch and all of those things to you but
[1:34:18] I'll say this I'm going to ask him when
[1:34:19] I get
[1:34:22] there I probably won won't even think
[1:34:24] about it to be honest with
[1:34:27] you but you say what does that mean now
[1:34:30] there's something about that I don't
[1:34:31] know brother BR said he believed the
[1:34:32] Rapture would take place between 6 and 9
[1:34:34] o'clock in the morning but he based that
[1:34:35] on the Third Watch in the scripture the
[1:34:38] fourth watch and so but look there'll
[1:34:42] it'll happen all across the Earth at the
[1:34:43] same
[1:34:44] time right so two men will be in the
[1:34:47] field one should be taken the other left
[1:34:49] they answered and said to him where Lord
[1:34:51] and he said to them wheresoever the body
[1:34:53] is there will the Eagles be gathered
[1:34:56] together now brother B said it was a
[1:34:59] light and dark side of the earth and and
[1:35:01] he taught us there won't be a huge group
[1:35:03] go I had so many more quotes I had to
[1:35:05] take out of this just so we don't hear
[1:35:06] all night but there but there won't be a
[1:35:08] huge group go listen if half the Earth
[1:35:11] disappears somebody's going to
[1:35:14] notice right and when this happens
[1:35:17] people don't
[1:35:18] notice 2 Thessalonians 2:3 says let no
[1:35:21] man deceive you by any means for that
[1:35:23] day shall not come except they're come
[1:35:24] of Falling Away
[1:35:25] first right the majority is going to
[1:35:28] fall away and I don't say that of our
[1:35:30] church we're not a big church we're not
[1:35:32] the majority we're very much in the
[1:35:33] minority there might be thousands go I
[1:35:35] don't know brother brandham said in one
[1:35:37] place there' be a tithing of the earth
[1:35:38] another place he said a tithing of
[1:35:40] Christians I don't know how many it'll
[1:35:41] be one place he says 500 another place
[1:35:44] he says a thousand but it won't be many
[1:35:47] by population standards you understand
[1:35:50] but he said what we need to say is if
[1:35:52] there's one going in Hardy Arkansas so
[1:35:54] let me be that
[1:35:55] one but there will come a great Falling
[1:35:57] Away first in Mark 13:20 he said except
[1:36:00] that the Lord had shortened those days
[1:36:02] no flesh should be saved but for the
[1:36:04] elect's sake whom he hath chosen he has
[1:36:08] shortened the days oh my see if if if
[1:36:13] 500 people say or a thousand people go
[1:36:14] missing no one will notice everything
[1:36:17] will be as common as can be just another
[1:36:21] day brother BR said just speaks and the
[1:36:25] Rapture will come now I think if you
[1:36:28] really understand the the the Rapture
[1:36:30] everybody's always talk him me say well
[1:36:32] there's going to come a squeeze on the
[1:36:33] bride first you're not feeling
[1:36:37] it huh you it's not hard for you to go
[1:36:40] to church it is for everybody else now
[1:36:43] come on church I know some of you look
[1:36:45] forward to church I'm not talking about
[1:36:46] that but Satan will put something in
[1:36:47] your
[1:36:49] way brother brandom said the squeeze if
[1:36:51] you go back to if you go back to uh when
[1:36:54] brother Brandon preached Feast of the
[1:36:55] trumpets he said that squeeze he said
[1:36:57] would be he talked about the squeeze he
[1:37:00] talked about those 200 million demons
[1:37:01] that would be released he said that
[1:37:02] would be calling all these little loose
[1:37:04] ends as though if though they didn't
[1:37:06] matter don't matter if I go to church it
[1:37:08] don't matter if I serve God we're living
[1:37:11] in that time Church the Bible said
[1:37:13] they'd be rich and increased with Goods
[1:37:15] give buying and building building houses
[1:37:17] planting
[1:37:18] Vineyards marrying and giving in
[1:37:20] marriage right and they won't even know
[1:37:23] that it happened happen God just speaks
[1:37:25] and the Rapture will come it ain't going
[1:37:27] out there and the angels come down
[1:37:28] shovel up the graves get out an old dead
[1:37:29] carcass here what is it it was born of
[1:37:31] sin to begin with but a new one made in
[1:37:33] its likeness he said see if we have this
[1:37:36] we'll die again see you can say well God
[1:37:39] bring back my body to me but you it'd be
[1:37:40] the same old body and you'd die again he
[1:37:43] said nobody you say the graves will open
[1:37:44] the dead will walk out that may be true
[1:37:46] but not open the way you say open he
[1:37:48] said that TR won't be like that it'll be
[1:37:49] a secret because he said he'd come like
[1:37:51] a thief in the night he's already told
[1:37:52] us this the rapture
[1:37:54] he said then judgments will strike sin
[1:37:55] plague sickness and everything and
[1:37:57] people will cry for death to take them
[1:37:59] when the Judgment Lord why is this
[1:38:00] judgment upon us when you said there
[1:38:02] would be a Rapture first he'll say it's
[1:38:04] already come and you didn't know it see
[1:38:07] so wouldn't that stuff all happens but
[1:38:09] it happens after we're
[1:38:11] gone it's already come you didn't know
[1:38:13] it God hiding himself in Simplicity oh
[1:38:15] my all right he said that's all that's
[1:38:16] already happened and you knew it not he
[1:38:18] said why don't Believers believe how
[1:38:21] many Believers we got here tonight why
[1:38:22] don't believe believe the simple signs
[1:38:25] of his coming they're expecting all
[1:38:27] these things to spoke up of the
[1:38:28] scripture and the moon is going to go
[1:38:29] down the the sun in the middle of the
[1:38:31] day there's going to be all kinds of
[1:38:32] things he said I got the notes wrote
[1:38:33] here on it to show what them things are
[1:38:35] and we'll get get to it on the breaking
[1:38:36] of these seals this week anyhow he said
[1:38:38] see there it is just where it's already
[1:38:40] passed and you didn't know it see if it
[1:38:43] is he said if the angel of the Lord will
[1:38:44] break them seals forth to it remember
[1:38:46] it's seal with them seven mysterious
[1:38:48] Thunders he said now what why can't
[1:38:50] people believe the simple Simplicity of
[1:38:52] a humble bunch of people see and the
[1:38:54] voice of the signs of God why can't they
[1:38:55] believe it I think that same question is
[1:38:57] valid tonight I think we need to
[1:38:59] simplify a little bit why can't we
[1:39:01] believe the simple voice say we're going
[1:39:03] home the next thing to happen is the
[1:39:05] coming of the
[1:39:08] Lord he said just like it's always been
[1:39:10] a true word of God being made manifest
[1:39:11] that they're too smart too educated to
[1:39:13] believe the simple form of the written
[1:39:14] word and want to put their own
[1:39:16] interpretation to it it don't mean this
[1:39:17] it don't mean that see it does mean that
[1:39:19] even the visions that God gives us here
[1:39:21] at the place it's so misunderstood
[1:39:22] that's the reason you hear on the tape
[1:39:23] say say what the tape say say what the

[1:42:23] that's the only hope that the church has
[1:42:25] the only hope listen church I'm not
[1:42:27] going to be able to fix everything
[1:42:29] that's wrong with you you're not no
[1:42:31] other preacher is going to be able to
[1:42:32] either I can't fix everything that's
[1:42:34] wrong with me what's going to happen
[1:42:35] it's going to take a body change it's
[1:42:37] going to take rapturing
[1:42:39] [Applause]
[1:42:44] Grace Hallelujah he said can't you see
[1:42:48] Spirit-filled people something is fixing
[1:42:51] to happen don't look for some great big
[1:42:53] Universal something sweeping nothing but
[1:42:55] the coming of the Lord Jesus remember he
[1:42:58] says musicians go ahead and come I'm
[1:43:00] done
[1:43:01] remember just remember the words and the
[1:43:05] promise of the
[1:43:09] Lord what did he
[1:43:12] say he'll descend with a shout brother
[1:43:16] Bram told us Christ does all three as he
[1:43:18] comes where are we at church do we
[1:43:21] realize what that means
[1:43:24] the next
[1:43:26] thing is the
[1:43:29] resurrection that's
[1:43:33] it we talked this morning about how God
[1:43:36] you were the thoughts of God could you
[1:43:38] grab a hold of that thought is that
[1:43:40] something that you can you can grab it's
[1:43:42] hard for me we were in a created thought
[1:43:44] of God other words it wasn't a thought
[1:43:47] that just God happened to have a thought
[1:43:48] but it's a created
[1:43:50] thought right he he chose to think
[1:43:55] it right he chose to make brother Logan
[1:43:58] brother Logan he chose that he that was
[1:44:01] his thought and you were expressed but
[1:44:03] when you come to the Earth you come in a
[1:44:05] body of sin right all of us did we come
[1:44:08] in a body of sin but one day the light
[1:44:11] come by your path you were headed One
[1:44:14] Direction suddenly you started heading
[1:44:15] in another
[1:44:17] Direction brother B said look what you
[1:44:19] were look what you are now something
[1:44:20] made something changed you something
[1:44:23] made you different say well I'm not the
[1:44:25] shoust person in the world I'm not the
[1:44:27] one that runs the aisles all the time I
[1:44:29] think God could do that for you but
[1:44:30] that's not what it's about look what you
[1:44:32] were look what God Made
[1:44:35] You right one day the the word just come
[1:44:38] by your way and when it come by your way
[1:44:40] what happened you begin to
[1:44:42] change inside you begin to change but
[1:44:45] the old body was still the same and and
[1:44:47] the memories some of the memories that
[1:44:49] you have are still the same you still
[1:44:51] remember you still remember and and the
[1:44:54] complexes and things maybe that you had
[1:44:55] maybe the even the complexes from a
[1:44:57] child and things you still had them but
[1:44:59] the holy spirit's working in your life
[1:45:01] he's changing you as you as you take
[1:45:03] captive every thought to The Obedience
[1:45:05] of Christ he's changing you what's
[1:45:06] happening what's God doing that thought
[1:45:10] that he had he's bringing you the seed
[1:45:13] the real you back to that thought it's
[1:45:16] the process of redemption and then
[1:45:18] what's he doing for you he's going to
[1:45:20] take you back oh Church
[1:45:24] he's taking you back inside and one day
[1:45:26] he's going to take you back on the
[1:45:29] outside you said but brother Ben what if
[1:45:31] I'm not you know I'll never be perfect
[1:45:33] that's true but his grace makes up for
[1:45:35] all the rest are you with me now it
[1:45:38] takes rapturing Grace at the end of the
[1:45:40] day it takes rapturing Grace but God had
[1:45:43] a picture of you Brother Band taught us
[1:45:44] that he had a picture of you when you
[1:45:45] were healthy and strong minus all the
[1:45:51] defects think about that that for a
[1:45:56] minute most of my defects you know I
[1:45:58] have defects I'm too fat
[1:46:01] and I was preaching in Louisiana and
[1:46:04] some girl down there her boyfriend was
[1:46:06] in another state you know and he wrote
[1:46:08] I'll tell you who it is if you ask me
[1:46:10] I'm not going to say it across here
[1:46:11] because he's probably
[1:46:12] listening he was in another state and he
[1:46:15] said he said she sent him a picture and
[1:46:18] I saw the picture she all she got out of
[1:46:20] the sermon that I preached is it said
[1:46:22] I'm fat praise the Lord Brother Ben prit
[1:46:26] that was her entire notes for the
[1:46:27] service I got to quit saying that about
[1:46:29] myself I
[1:46:30] guess because God had a picture of
[1:46:34] me are you with me now healthy and
[1:46:37] strong am Hallelujah minus
[1:46:43] all
[1:46:44] all the
[1:46:51] defects and that voice voice you know we
[1:46:54] recognized something in the message it
[1:46:55] wasn't the literal voice of brother
[1:46:56] brown but there was something we
[1:46:57] recognized I'm just fellowshipping with
[1:46:59] you right now I can't help it it's
[1:47:01] there's something in that that the
[1:47:03] message that you heard it spoke to you
[1:47:05] you've been through a lot and you've
[1:47:06] you've you've crossed but you just can't
[1:47:08] not believe it there something that it's
[1:47:10] in you there was a voice within the
[1:47:12] voice behind the
[1:47:14] voice that spoke to
[1:47:17] you and it's changing you and someday
[1:47:20] that same voice that spoke the worlds
[1:47:22] into
[1:47:23] existence that called Lazarus from the
[1:47:25] grave will call and I will
[1:47:30] answer that's what job said can you
[1:47:32] imagine God giv such a revelation that
[1:47:33] you'll call and I will
[1:47:36] answer you'll remember the works of your
[1:47:40] hands I just want to say what a day that
[1:47:42] will
[1:47:43] be oh can you just worship him for
[1:47:47] that I just I just feel his presence

[1:47:58] you but again I can't do everything that
[1:48:00] needs to be done in your life to make
[1:48:02] you who God made you but he
[1:48:04] can he can he can change you make you
[1:48:08] new and make you different and fix you
[1:48:12] and fix me and one day we'll be
[1:48:14] completely
[1:48:16] fixed
[1:48:18] redeemed not just restored back to a
[1:48:20] human body but in a new body glorified
