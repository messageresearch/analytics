Lord directly from you this evening I pray you would help us to leave better Christians than we came move upon us now we ask in Jesus name amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen if you have your Bibles with you if you would turn to Genesis chapter 1 and we'll start with verse one Genesis chapter 1 and verse one keep brother Ben and them in prayer I'm sure they're just real really struggling out there at their Lakehouse and and uh you know leaving us here and uh some of y'all tonight are like well I walked out and you're like brother Ben got a wig and and lost 50 PBS but no it's it's me and so uh I'm just going to see if he's watching that's all I'm doing he'll he'll let me know if he is Genesis chapter 1 and we'll just start with a couple verses and then we'll skip down Genesis chapter 1 verse one in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and if you go down to verse 26 in the same chapter verse 26 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over the cattle and over all that and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them in Deuteronomy chap 4 and verse 9 we'll just have one verse there Deuteronomy chapter 4 and verse 9 and it goes like this only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy son's sons and you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word if I could title a sermon tonight I would speak on my identification and we are all identified as something every one of us in the in the sound of my voice we're identified as something or we're identified with something every one of us have an identity or we should if you if you don't have an identity then nobody knows who you are and and you probably don't exist so everyone that exists has an identity go God created you with an identity the identity that he gave you as a man you were identified as a man now you can in this day we live in a man can try to be a woman and a and a woman can try to be a man but really you're identified the way God has made you and you really can't change that identity there is no way to change that identity you can you can you can make believe your identity but uh your identity would really be revealed you can take a man that tries to be a woman but if you go all the way back to what God made him he's still a man if you take a woman that's become a become a man you can go all the way back to when they were born and they were born exactly the way God made them and so they have an identification even if they try to falsely identify themselves in some other way you're identified with your church a lot of times people say well you go to brother Ben's church or you go to brother Jason's church or you go to brother brother Matt's or Brother David you know any other church and a lot of times you're identified like that a Christian Tabernacle or Word of Life and and so people identify you with the church you go to or Baptist or Methodist or whatever and sometimes you you like that identity and sometimes you don't like that identity sometimes you're identified by your family and a lot of times we don't like to be identified with our family because a lot of you come from a background ground where you're not real proud of your family can you say amen that's just the way it is sometimes you love your family and we should always love our family but sometimes we're not real proud of the life we've come from or the lineage because not everybody come from a perfect home you know that to be true tonight so every one of us are identified by something and a lot of times it's identified uh your political preference can identify you I'm you know you can be identified as a Republican or a Democrat or an an independent or or whatever because every one of us and and we always want to be identified in a certain way but I think what we really should be focused on is our identification in the word can we can we be found in the word and identified in the word I I I think a lot of times we we we we want to be identified with a group of people in the message that we think is the Elite Class of the message but to me that is not how we should be identified H have we been walking in the word of God for this hour have we been have we found our place in the scripture because a prophet would say it like this if you knew who you were then we be out of here once the bride will recognize who she is then we'll be gone and I think that's what we need to do tonight let's find out who we are not what church we belong to or or what family we belong to but let's find out who we really are let's find out what kind of you know I you know how you dress can identify who you are if a lady with a dress walks down the street you're identified as different or crazy or something but you are identified why because you are identifying yourself with the word of God and dressing like a lady should dress and and if you're not you can find a a good Christian woman she may brother Brandon would say she would live true to her husband and be just a good woman but she would dress like the world you wouldn't know her from a street prostitute well come on somebody you wouldn't know the difference now I'm not saying that she's not going to heaven or maybe she's a good Christian and maybe that person will come in here and get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and and make a rapture we don't want to judge them uh judge anything until it's time but but I would say it like this I think we need to find our identity today I think we need to know who we are because the end is just too close to be playing church can you say Amen brother Stuart here preached not too long ago there's no time for playing church and I think uh if there's ever been a time to preach that sermon it's now it's there's ever if there's ever been a time to find your identification in the word of God it's now brother brandham would say it like this he said we are identified with our families in this human life by marriage with our wives the one when we marry and our family is identified by the union of our marriage and then he said what to think what if this horrible thing would happened to you and you wouldn't be able to remember who you married that would be terrible for some and he said who would what if this terrible thing would happen to you who's your wife and which is your children and who is your father and mother and who's your neighbor now there's another word for that brother Brandon preaches a message called spiritual Amnesia how many's ever heard it well if you haven't you need to go listen to it that's a good one 1964 spiritual Amnesia and brother BR would talk about that and but but you would forget who you are and you you just imagine Brother David you go home tonight and and you walk in in the house and you're like who are you and and Mary would say well I'm your wife but you'd forgot what is it it would be Amnesia that would set in and you wouldn't you would know who you're married to and I think sometimes as Christians we are the same way we see the word staring us right in the face well what does that have to do with me this is your word this is your identity this is where you belong Under The Fellowship of the message of the hour this is who you are you are the Bride of Jesus Christ well can you say Amen on a Wednesday night can you say Amen we are are the Bride of Jesus Christ but we've got to identify ourselves there by the word of God there's nothing else that can identify us there you know your status in the message will not identify you as bride but you will be identified by the word that you believe and live brother Brandon would go on to say we are identified again he said can identify ourselves in the human race by having intelligence there again I'd say some of us and and being different from animal life the animals cannot think he just goes by sounds and so forth and he has no soul but he said but what makes us different we're identified by having a soul and a conscience that tells us what's right and wrong so we're different we're not just a we're not just a an animal we're not just a bird or or an elephant but we are We Are a Human Being we are greater than that God has made us for a purpose and we can identify ourselves as such right in the scriptures brother B says You must be identified somewhere you must show your your life shows tonight where you are where you are identified you are identified either in Christ or out of Christ you are not halfway there's no such thing as a drunk sober man there's no black white bird you're either saved or you're not saved you're a saint or a sinner one or the other and your spiritual attitude towards God's word identifies you exactly where you're standing now I think that's pretty good I think our attitude tonight can tell you exactly where you're standing now when the word of God is preached and sometimes it's preached in a way that you can enjoy it and sometimes it's preached in a in a way you don't enjoy it so much but when the word of God when it when it hits your heart a real believer will have an attitude that says Amen to the word of God Amen you can't change that because that is your identity the word is your identity and when you when you can recognize yourself in the word of God nothing can change that word well come on somebody I said nothing can change who you are in the word you know you can backslide you can run from this message but you can go you can go so far to where you feel like you can never come back again but if your identity is in the word then you'll always come back to the word you'll always come back why because there's something on the inside of you that'll bring you back no more than no more than you could change who you are or what you are or you you've got to become a Christian and be identified with the word of your hour well can you say Amen tonight God's word Vindicated prove that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is just the same as it ever was on the day of Pentecost or any other time and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual Amnesia or not I want to be identified with that crazy bunch of Acts 2 Christians I want to be identified with a bunch of Acts 2 Pentecostal I tell you what I think we need another blessing on the church again I think it's time we we just go ahead and say you know what we're going to take off the chains and we're going to just worship free again why because I'm identified with a with a couple guys who were sitting down in jail one night and they sang so loud and they worshiped so hard till the chains fell off well you tell me worship wrong I go ahead and say it like this let the worship happen let the praise happen and watch the chains fall off the people here tonight well I wish somebody preach with me I think it's time we quit holding back and our identifying ourselves with a bunch of cold dead formal Christians when what we need is to be identified again with a newborn Christian that we are I don't care if you have to you say well I've never had that experience yet then it's time you get down to the Altar and identify yourself with that bunch of screaming hollering act two Pentecostal babies well I tell you you well well I don't want to be a baby well you got to be a baby before you can ever have to get saved before the word's ever going to come alive to you can you say amen I tell you what tonight I think we need to have and he said your attitude towards that identifies whether you have spiritual Amnesia or not he said I whether you're a deacon or even if you're a preacher it doesn't matter he said they get it too we find out it's contagious and it hits the whole thing you got a preacher up there with spiritual Amnesia that don't believe the power of God can move anymore and you end up with a church full of people that don't believe the spirit of God can move anymore well can you say amen God wants people back in the Pulpit preaching the entire word of God and the power Bap and the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost coming down on the people brother brandom said that's the way God expects it that's what God wants he said we need preachers back in the Pulpit he didn't say preachers sit down but preachers back in the Pulpit preaching and the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost coming down well if that would work for a prophet if that's what a prophet wanted what about me tonight what about you tonight I'm not satisfied with just another Wednesday night service I'm not satisfied with just another religious formal Gathering but what I want to see tonight is the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost grab a hold of a young person or an old person and move on them and make a move like they've never moved before I think it'll do some good let's break some of these icicles off a little bit and just have church what do you say tonight can we just have church and just forget about everything around us today we need to be identified with that group of people that got so close to God they were expecting such a blessing that they got up in the upper room and and they stood there and they stayed there and they waited and They Carried they wouldn't leave they wouldn't even leave until they got the Holy Ghost why because it was a promise that was to come and today you've got the same promise that the Holy Ghost would come upon you if you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ The Promise is here all you've got to do is accept it but you'll never get it coming down to the Altar for 5 minutes and saying well maybe that was all I needed to do and a dry-eyed confession will never make it happen but what you need is to really get down there and I tell you what it may take some snot and some tears and it may take all kinds of things but let me tell you something I'd rather be right here at the altar and snotting and crying like a baby than to get to to get to heaven and he say well what have you done with the word that's been given to you well it made me look crazy in church it made me act different he said well if you're not identified with that group then depart because I never even knew you but I want to be identified tonight with a group of people people who are not afraid to Worship in the house of God there's never there's not a quote that tells you not to Worship in church so I don't even want to hear about it there's not a quot there's not even a quote that tells you that you have a right to sit there when the word of God is being preached and say well I don't need that word I I I've heard that before well if the word's being preached that's already been preached you've heard all of it before but if it's become common to you then you have not identified yourself with that word and become part of that word I tell you what if you got up in the morning brother Jeff and you said well sister Patty you were my wife yesterday but I'm kind of sick of that well that'd be a real bad marriage wouldn't it I'm tired of looking at you I told my wife that and I'd never get to see her again you know but let me tell you something what how we treat the word often times is how we treat everything else if we haphazardly handle the word of God then the next thing you know it trickles down to our homes and the next thing you know it trickles down in our work and we got to be careful we got it happens to all of us and we we get complacent and we get it it becomes common to us and and and I've heard this spiritual Amnesia tap probably a hundred times because it's one of my favorites and and I listen to it over and over but sometimes you just got to hey I forget about the last time I heard it I want to hear it again Lord speak to me again I don't care if I've heard that before speak to me again I need to be fed again just because I had steak yesterday don't mean I don't want it tomorrow right well I'll never go back to Golden Crow because I've had everything they've got to offer I've had everything they've had to offer hundreds of times and I'll still go back if you don't get this figure by staying away from Golden Corral but but think about it you're identified with something and if you're identified with the words you can't wait to hear the word of God because you want to hear what you're identified with tell me my family history sometime I love to hear about my family history the good parts I love to hear the good parts of my family history because you're identified with something right a and your family history wouldn't matter to me if you're not related right and everybody got quiet my family history wouldn't matter to you if you're not related to me well that's just somebody else's family history but when you talk about your own your identified with that I you know this might be too simple for you but I'd like to just let you know if you could ever actually get identified with the word of God you wouldn't question the message of the hour if you could ever identify yourself in the message of the hour it wouldn't be so easy to go back back out in the world and backslide over and over again if you could ever identify yourself with the message of the hour you would find yourself growing in the word and not always going backwards in the word I well I tell you what I think we need some Simplicity back in the Pulpit that'll tell you this you need to be saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and find yourself in the word again and let the word change your life and it will do it how many knows it'll do it I I think I'm looking at some people where the word has changed your lives you are not what you could have been had the word never crossed your path but did you know you didn't go looking for God he came looking for you why because his Spirit his seed was in you and he identified with that life that was in you and once that life came to M once that life met the met the spirit and then they could identify with each other do you realize that you and Christ had become one you are fully identified with Christ today just like you're identified with your family history just like you're identified with the word of God you and Christ have become identified as man and wife that's what I want to get to you tonight we are identified as Christians not just in Christian name only but we are identified as Christians because we have we have put off the world from us and we have laid down the things of the world oh yes the world's going to fight you and this flesh will fight you till the day you die you you're not going to get out of this flesh without a fight but what you'll do is you the spirit of God will raise up a standard how many knows that to be true that's Bible the spirit of God will raise up a standard in this last day and I believe you are the standard that will be raised up to fight the enemy in this day you are but it's the ones who are identified with Christ you'll have to find your identity to know where you are now brother B talks about to be an American he said to be an American you must be identified with your nation and he goes on down and he said what she is I am what she was I am no matter what she was I am still what she was to be an American I landed on Plymouth Rock now brother Bram talks like that and he talks about where he was I was here and I was there what he is saying if he is really an American he is identified with everything an American stands for and so not that he would agree with what she stands for but he's identified with it if I tell you I'm an American then everything that happens in America I'm I'm identified with the government I'm identified with our president I'm identif with all these things but you realize that you're identified because you are an American if you don't want to be identified as American I'm sure there's other countries it'll take you but if you are an American you are identified as an American if you was born in France you're identified with France and and what she would stand for but you realize that that that that that doesn't make you uh that doesn't make you come under subjection to the American rules or laws uh under the laws yes but under under things that would make you take you out of your Christianity would make you different you don't become an American like uh I want to dress like the the regular American people and act like the American people no America has went to hell in a hurry a and this this this nation has been has been has has has turned down God for the last time but do you realize that we are not part of that group but what we are is part of a group that is going out of here but your natural nation is an American you are a natural-born American but I was the only one in my family not natural-born actually so I'm not not a natural-born American I couldn't be president oh my goodness y'all are hard tonight I was born C-section okay one one out of eight how about that I was the biggest in my family too I bet you I bet you looked at Ben one time and said I don't believe that brother brandom said it like this I crossed the icy Delaware with George Washington y'all are you know I'm gonna have to make you laugh or something cuz y'all are hard tonight y'all are tough I stood with Stonewall Jackson when the odds was so great against him and they asked how can you stand like a stone wall when the odds is against you the little bashful blue-eyed fellow kicked the dust with his boots and said I never take a drink of water until I thank God for it I have to stand like a Stonewall with him I stood there with Stonewall Jackson brother brand says I'm identify with him and his stand so we go on down here and I'll try to to save time I'll just try to get through this as quickly as possible now to be identified American Americans has to stand for all America's shame and all America's Glory all she ever was all she is or what she will will be you are identified with it now to be a true Christian now this is the part that's important to you tonight now to be a true Christian you have to be the same you have to be identified with everything that a Christian would stand for he said we don't want to forget that all that he was I'm identified with him I'm identified with him notice he is in me and I in him then every Christian that's a real genuine Christian now there's the qualifier right there you can say you're a Christian and not be a Christian can you say Amen but what if you're a real genuine Christian then you were with him when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation of the world we were identified in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed can you say amen I was back there with him if I got eternal life I was there with him I was identified with him and when the morning Stars sang together he said the sons of God Shadow her Joy I was there when he called Abraham at the age of 75 and his wife 65 and told him they were going to have a baby I was with him when he took his T upon thus say the Lord I'm going to have the baby see I was identified there and so I can find my identity now in the same scripture under the same those aren't just Bible stories to me those are realities to me because I'm identified with those men in the Bible I'm not just I'm not just saying well Abraham had Faith so maybe I can have faith no you identify yourself with Sarah if you need a baby identify yourself with with Abraham when he had to go put offer his son up to to the Lord remember go God will provide himself a ram God will provide himself a sacrifice identify yourself in the scriptures identify yourself with the men and women of this Bible listen you can find yourself in this Bible but don't find yourself on the wrong side of the situation I don't want to be identified with Judas I don't want to be identified with with the Rich Young Ruler I don't want to be identified with with those who would turn their back on Jesus no I want to be identified with Peter I want to be identified with Paul I want to be identified I can bring it on right down this day I want to be identified with a prophet named William brandham why because it's not the man I'm pointing you to it's I'm identified with the message that he brought because the message is Jesus Christ to you not the man not the flesh you've got to look past the veil and see what God has brought to this hour see we're we were saying well if I could look like Abraham or I could look you ever see I knew some people one time they they wanted to they they all had hair like Wesley they all tried to dress exactly like John Wesley and and act like him and look like him listen that didn't make them John Wesley you you want to you want to be you want to be what Jesus was do the works that he did don't try to dress like him just do the works that he did that's a good start and maybe people look at you and say well that's a Jesus man but let me tell you something we got to start somewhere and we might as well start with getting back to the word of God and finding ourselves there well if there was ever somebody healed in the Bible you can be identified with that person that was healed a leper or a lame or blind or whatever it was you can be identified in that story when he said by his stripes you are healed we are healed you can put your name there and say I'm identified with the word of God when he said Rejoice all ye people I tell you what I can put my name there and say I'm going to rejoice when I when he I tell you what when he said if you hold your peace the rocks will cry out I'm not going to let the rocks cry out in my place I'm going to identify myself there and say I'm going to speak out in the name of Jesus I'm going to say Lord I come by my way tonight because I need another touch from you I'm not here just to play church I'm not here just to find out who so and so is and what they've done but I'm here to say I'm identified with the word of God in this hour I'm identified with something I'm identified with something real I'm identified when a prophet said that the cloud was Jesus Christ he said that was Christ up there I identifi myself with that message I was there in the mind of God sir when a prophet could stand there and turn his back to the people and tell them their names and tell them who they were and where they come from I'm identified with that Ministry can identify myself in that in that place why because that's a Biblical Ministry that has come and it is the word being fulfilled I want to find myself always fulfilling the word of the hour brother Ram goes on and he makes all kinds of he said I'm identified here and he goes on with Moses and the Red Sea he said whatever Christians has been whatever Believers has been every believer now is identified with that same person whatever it is you must be identified don't forget that when you do you've got spiritual Amnesia and you've forgotten who you are I I don't want us to forget Who We Are Tonight I don't want you to forget that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ when many will walk away from this message and many will turn their back on this message don't let that be you when you young people are going to you're going to meet obstacle after obstacle and Spirits are going to come against you and there's going to be all kinds of pretty faces that try to turn your head and all kinds of things are going to come after you why because it's the age we live in but don't you fall for the Trap of the de identify yourself with an overcoming bunch of people tonight identify yourself that there will be someone without spot or recal in the end time that's going to take a stand for godliness and take a stand for Holiness and take a stand for what's right well I need somebody that'll stand up tonight and say I'm identified with the word of this hour I'm not identified with Methodist anymore I'm not identifi with Wesley's message or Lutheran's message I I but I'm identified with the same gospel that was preached by the first messenger and it was I tell you what it was preached in his fullness and I can identify myself there as a true Holy Ghost born believer listen we need more young people to say I'm not looking to the world no more I'm not running to movie theaters I'm not running to the I'm I tell you what well I'm sorry I stepped on somebody's toes but you know if we'd spend more time reading the message of the hour hearing the message of the hour spending time in church we'd be a whole lot better off than if we sit in a movie theater with all those other spirits around us listen I understand that that you got to live life and you got to live this world that we live in but I think we need to set some boundaries sometimes and identify ourselves as a true Christian born again in this hour I understand that we got to live with the world I understand we got to work around the world I understand sometimes you got to go to school around the world but let me tell you something when you rub shoulders with the world don't let the world rub off on you and when you do feel the complacency setting in run back to the house of God and get back down to the altar again just because you receive the Holy Ghost does not mean that you're that you're okay no you can get in a cold condition again and quit praising God again but what you need to do when you start feeling that world rub off on you a little bit say Lord I'm coming back to you because my love is waxed cold for you and I want to come back home to where you are and say Lord forgive me I've done some things that's wrong well let me tell you something if you would keep the heart of a child that's tender A and I tell you what I would say like this I think some old people need to say Lord tenderize my heart again so when wrong comes to me and when there's bad thoughts come in my mind I can say Lord forgive me immediately quickly run back to God and be so in tune with God that it's not condemnation that sets in but you feel the love of God over and over and over again why because he's always saying come back home come back into the fold you're okay you're coming back listen all you got to do is repent and move forward and identify yourself right back in the position you left you you you you're always going to find yourself fighting with the world you're always going to find yourself out here you know rubbing shoulders but let me tell you something we are not we are not identified as worldly people we are not identified as people going through a tribulation can you say Amen I'm not here for a tribulation I'm not here just to just to just to say well I believe the message and and I'm hoping it gets me out of here no I believe it's going to get me out of here I'm looking for body change I'm not looking for just a another another doctrine that come along well it's different so we can be different oh I'm not here to be different I'm here to say I stand for the message of the hour and my identity is tied to that I'm not here to be different I'm not here to just be another Christian I'm not here just to just to say well well I I I can stand up here a couple times a month and and preach to you people and I just have a good no no no I want to see lives changed I'm not satisfied with just service after service coming to church I want to see Soul SA saved and people filled with the Holy Ghost that's my desire I I you may have to excuse me sometimes I might get an error and I might say something I shouldn't say and I I'll tell you what I'd say forgive me for that because if I could do anything I don't want to hurt nobody but I want to help people I want to see people saved I I want to see these young people grow up to be preachers I want to see these young ladies grow up and have a part in the Sunday school or or be young ladies with with children in the church and bringing their children to church listen I don't want to see another generation ation lost to people that don't know who they are we are identified as Believers and let's act like Believers I'm not identified with a Baptist Church that would say well it's okay to smoke and it's okay to drink and it's okay no no I'm not okay with that I'm not okay with what the world calls okay I might be crazy but I'm okay with crazy as long as the world calls me crazy and I'm okay with god brother BR goes on down here he says I gotta get way on down here he says I was with him when he raised up from the dead I come up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there with him every believer was the same every one of you you say I want to go back and visit that tomb well you were already there you were there when he raised up think about how many people can say that not very many not very many people can say I was there on Easter morning when Jesus got out of the Tomb but we were there we were there I you might not be able to explain that to me and I can't explain it to you but I can tell you this I was there I believe in paradoxes I I was there brother brand said now he said uh he said and now I am seated with him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of Hell conquered through him every Christian believer was seated the same way because you have to be identified and he said now I find myself in this last days with the many of the believing Christians identified in his ministry he is the same yesterday today and forever I find myself in this day identified in his ministry he said you find yourself that way believing it walking with it notice the works that he did he said the believer would do the same thing can you say amen he said the works that I do he said then you can be identified with him he said then can you be identified with him when the reproach comes on the word Can You Stand The reproach like he did see identify with him I was identified with him I was with him on the day of Pentecost I was with the disciples up there identify with him and the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I wonder if the church hasn't got so Amnesia so much now that they don't some of them don't even believe there is such a thing as the Holy Ghost SE where the church has got a very bad case of Amnesia they have forgotten that that was Jesus Christ back there and they have forgotten what Jesus Christ was and they have forgotten they thought he was just a lawmaker or a prophet or a good man they forgot he was God can you say Amen they forgot he's the same yesterday today and forever and the church has got a bad case of spiritual Amnesia they have forgotten all these things and they don't understand it no more well that's the church but I want to say the bride has not forgotten who she is the bride has not forgotten that you are more than able to take the land the the bride has not forgotten that every promise in the book belongs to us amen right he said he said now they they've gotten all these things they don't understand it no more we must be with the disciples at Pentecost identify with him and he goes on down and he says now I'm identified in the same don't get spiritual Amnesia because you will if you will and you'll identify yourself with something else stay right with that word we was with the church when it was commissioned by Jesus Christ go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature I want to be identified there all the world to every creature and these signs shall follow them that believe can be identified in that now listen brother Brandon wanted to be identified in that commission and I'll say we need to be identified in that today when there's groups in the message that would say we don't need preachers anymore a prophet said I want to be identif ified in the commission so I'll say it like this I want to be identified in that commission and if you take me out of that then I believeing something else I'm believing something wrong and I would say it's false Doctrine but I'll say it like this I'm not going to be identified outside of this message I'm only going to be identified in the message that I've heard and I I believe it with all my heart and if I believe it and I act on it I heard a brother say like this if if I'm in tune with the fashion move of the hour I'll tell you what that how could I stay here when every time God moved that then the pillar of fire moved and and the people would move with it then I want to be I want to be identify with those people that were with the pillar of fire back in the old days why because that same Pillar of Fire has proven to be here in this hour and so if I could if they were identified with a pillar of fire and it would lead them to the promised land then what will the pillar of fire do for us it'll lead you all the way home don't get amnesia don't get to thinking you don't know who you are just because the devil fights you and tells you you ain't good enough don't be letting the devil beat you up he don't even know he he don't even know who he is he's been cast down and beat up so much he knows I'm here to torment but but you know what I have no power but he starts tormenting people why because people listen to him he has no power over you if you won't listen to him can you say amen he has no power over you he's only got power if you let him have power brother B said it like this he said uh now you're identified with that or you've got spiritual amnesia you find out you don't believe those signs follow the Believers if you don't believe it then you've got spiritual Amnesia can you say Amen tonight he said you've forgotten that Pro God promised that and these signs shall follow them don't forget it you can't forget it and be a Christian yes sir amen I'll say that again you can't forget it and be a Christian this is in the midst of spiritual Amnesia you can't forget and be a Christian you must be identified with it you must be identified with St John the 14th chapter and the 12th verse he that believeth with me the works that I do shall he do also don't for forget it if you do then you've got spiritual Amnesia and you have forgotten who you are you've forgotten what your testimony means how about he said if you abide in me my word in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done are you identified there to believe that that is the truth Mark 11 when he said if you stay to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe he said then you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said and can you can you be identified there to believe that this is the truth now he asked that question and I would would like to ask us that tonight can we truly be identified in the word that we have been taught and so Faithfully given in this hour I I think it's time we we quit trying to find out if we're Thunders or return Ministry or this Doctrine or that Doctrine no let's let's just put all those things off to the side and just come back to the Simplicity that I am a true born again Christian and if you're trying to get me to follow after this man or that man then you can just leave me alone because I'm following after the fashion move of the hour and that is the Holy Ghost move of the hour that is the message that has been brought by a Vindicated Prophet now I'm not Vindicated I can't stand here and say well the prophet didn't he wasn't right here so so we'll just change a little bit and go this way no no I don't have the authority by the word of God to do that but what I can do is stand here and be identified with the word and say if the word says it you can be identified in it and it will come to pass because the word is always true you don't have to worry about the word being true it's always been true and it will always be true now brother bam said now you forget he said you lose your Christian balance you can't tell where you belong you say I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist that's what I know about it I'm a Pentecostal I'm this that or the other he said watch out that might may that might mean the disease sign is showing on you that you've got some spiritual Amnesia you say well brother brandom I believe this and and I don't hardly he said just wait a minute if God promise to do these things and said they would be in the last day and your Creed will keep you from it that's a good sign I can see the disease sign on you he said you have forgotten to identify yourself with the word you say I don't believe that the sick are healed you've got spiritual Amnesia you see I don't believe the baptism of the Holy Ghost spiritual Amnesia I don't believe that God promised these things in the last days he said you've listened to a Creed or some Doctrine instead of the Bible you've got spiritual Amnesia well can you say amen I I I tell you what tonight let's not get in this this complacency place and let the message become common to us because if you do that you've got spirit Amnesia and you don't even know who you are you can't recognize who you are or your place in the scripture but he said you don't know where you do belong you're confessing a Christian and denying the word and that brings you right back to spiritual Amnesia again he said you don't know where you stand you got spiritual Amnesia you can't identify yourself with the scriptures you have to be with the disciples you have to be with all scripture with the church when it's commissioned but now when the church was commissioned he said he said that was her commission going into all the world and preach the gospel he said said but now he said they have forgotten and have a bad case of spiritual amnesia amnesia just like Eve got he said and through the garden one day now she is like Israel suffering from the same disease and Allergy from a seminary diet an allergy from a seminary diet that will give you spiritual Amnesia I I tell you there's a failure to intellectual Faith Brother David there's a failure to intellectual Faith intellectual faith will question every word of God when real genuine faith will believe every word of God God and what you'll find is intellectual Faith will'll say well was brother Brandon guessing it or or or maybe this was wrong or this was right let me tell you what the message is the message is an actual Vindication and a revealing of Jesus Christ in this hour and a real believer will say Amen to it I know you find Critics on the internet and they'll say well I I don't necessar I don't believe it because he missed this and he missed that and they wasn't even there and they have no proof but there's always going to be CR there's always going to be critics think about Jesus's day how many of them believed on Jesus not very many because they were intellectual Believers and in this day if you're an intellectual believer you'll never find yourself in the scriptures intellectual people will will will take this part of the word and they'll they they'll plot it against this part of the word and well we got to we got to take this part out because it's not inspired and we'll take this part over here because it fits our ideas and our intellectual ideas listen to me if you get an intellectual faith you'll never see this message correctly you might be smart in the message you might know what it says you might think you know what it says you might even think you you you have a full revelation of it but if all you've got is an intellectual Faith the devil can talk you out of this so fast that your head will spin we're not here for an intellectual Faith or an intellectual talk but what we're here for tonight is let the word of God penetrate the hearts of the Believers let the word of God change your life let the word of God come in there and do the work it was intended to do in your life personally well that's what I want I need the word of God to change me and I know there's some young people that's going to fight some devils and they need the word of God to change them I know I I know that to be true uh some of you remember when you were young a few of you do everybody but my mama remembers when they was young she forgot but think about it some of you young people are going through things that some of you have never been through sir and never will go through I know you think you've been there and you think you've done that but if you're if you were raised in the 30s 40s and 50s you really don't have a clue that hurt somebody I'm sorry let me tell you something though you didn't have the devil at the in your pocket like you do now you didn't have it you didn't have that you you didn't well come on somebody some of you even remember when ladies out in public actually dressed halfway decent that's not the case today I know it was the same devil it was the same devil that tempted you and it's the same devil tempting them but he's he's come up with different ways because there was some people that overcome the first time well we got to make it even more cunning we got to make it more deceptive listen that's the way it is you young people listen to me the devil's going to come with in ways you didn't even think he would come that's right because he's deceptive it well I need a phone because I you know I go to school and my parents have to get a hold of me and that may be a legit reason but listen on that phone has an access to everything the devil's got and I just said that because I don't know why because it's not in my notes maybe I'll put it in there for next time but listen that that's the that's the traps of the devil but if you'll identify yourself at a young age with with Believers then then you'll recognize when the devil's coming after you I'm almost done I promise I I promise I'm almost done I'm closing it's just a long close you've got to be identified with Christ and his life is living in you that's when you're identified with Christ as when Christ lives in you how simple is that you want to be identified tonight then you need to be identified with Christ because he you need him inside of you and you say well I don't have the Holy Ghost well I I'd say it's a good time to get it it's a good time to get it and if you've been if you've been cold in your experience and you feel like you've gotten a little I tell you when you start getting when the fruits of the spirit are not showing up anymore you need to go back and get a refilling of the Holy Ghost when Joy is not there like it used to be get a ref of the Holy Ghost when peace is nowhere to be found get a refilling of the Holy Ghost well can you say man that's what we need tonight more than anything is a refilling of the Holy Ghost you say well I've got the Holy Ghost no you need a refilling tonight when when when when your attitude just so bad nobody wants to be around you just get the Holy Ghost that's a sweet Spirit that'll follow you that's a dove likee Spirit you say well I've had a bad day well we all have bad days but we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost I want to say this in closing for real this time I'm identified with a group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows that this is not a fanaticism it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm identified with that group here tonight yet they're called a bunch of Heretics a bunch of fanaticism on account of the word of God but I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God un salvation and I'm one I and I'm one I'm I'm with them living Epistles and I I and a Vindicated God veiled in human form in men and women can you say Amen tonight if our musicians would come my time is up I want to say this tonight if you if you feel cold if you're having a hard time finding yourself in the scriptures then I would say tonight tonight when you need to find yourself back in the scriptures again well well I I I'm I'm fear I fear over this and I fear over that maybe it's a sickness I'd like to tell you tonight if you've got fear over that find a person in the Bible who was healed put yourself in their position right find someone who received a promise in the Bible you are heirs to the same promise they were heirs to you are heirs to every promise you are join HS you are you are an overcomer don't don't find yourself on the wrong side of this don't find yourself with the ones in the wilderness who were just going around and around and and trying to find their way no find yourself with that Joshua generation that went over and fought the fought those devils and fought those well come on somebody when You Face a giant in your life go ahead and be that David to cut his head off don't don't fear don't stand there and say say well he's bigger than me no go ahead and fight that devil why because you can identify yourself with a with a David and not with a Goliath you might try to find yourself bigger than that David and and you find yourself all big and muscular and say well I can overcome anything well if you're trying on your own I just go ahead and tell you you can't make it on your own you've got to be identified in the word of God tonight before your parents ever called you by name he knew your name and he had it written down on the Book of Life think about it before you are ever named he already knew your name I I thank the Lord for that he knew you and I want to be identified with a God that could know that can you stand to your feet tonight if there's anybody that needs prayer here this evening if you need you say well I've lost my identity I found myself in in a state of Amnesia that I just can't find my way out well there's room for you tonight at the altar if you need to come if there's someone he's prayed for tonight myself for brother Stuart would be happy to pray with you listen Church we're here for
