[31:18] morning on flourishing in the courts of

[31:23] chapter 1 verse 3
[31:25] it says blessed be the god and father of
[31:27] the lord jesus christ who has blessed us
[31:30] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[31:32] places
[31:33] in christ according as he has chosen us
[31:36] in him
[31:37] before the foundation of the world that
[31:39] we should be holy and without blame
[31:42] before him and love
[31:44] having predestinated us unto the
[31:45] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[31:48] himself according to his good pleasure
[31:51] of his will to the praise of the glory
[31:54] of the grace where in he hath
[31:57] made us already accepted
[31:59] in the beloved amen god bless you can
[32:01] have your seats this morning
[32:04] hey band so i was looking at this
[32:07] actually wednesday night and and i was
[32:09] preaching a little thought actually on
[32:11] he had made us and i was looking at the
[32:13] parallel between joshua and ephesians
[32:16] here that uh
[32:17] after the death of moses and how the new
[32:20] administration was going to come in
[32:22] power and authority and
[32:24] and i got to thinking about how god rich
[32:26] in mercy has um
[32:28] has already before the foundation of the
[32:30] world and you know blessed us and and
[32:33] brother brown said it like this that he
[32:34] placed that the wedding band of grace
[32:36] upon your finger before the foundation
[32:39] of the world so we want to look this
[32:41] morning just for a few moments i'm
[32:43] flourishing in the courts of our god and
[32:45] and i got to thinking about how that how
[32:47] that god was a spirit and how that he
[32:50] was in that spirit form that every
[32:52] attribute there ever was going to be was
[32:54] laying right there he was wanting to be
[32:56] a father he wanted to be a savior he
[32:58] wanted to be a healer and a bed so the
[33:01] condescending down of almighty god he
[33:03] was a spirit so he was he was god above
[33:06] us and he been so when he had a plan
[33:08] that he was going to become a redeemer
[33:10] and then
[33:10] his plan was provided in jesus christ so
[33:13] is god with us so god was condemned
[33:16] sending down to humanity that he wanted
[33:19] to become you he been that you can
[33:21] become him by grace and so we when the
[33:24] holy ghost was provided it produced what
[33:27] what god had had in his mind before the
[33:29] foundation of the world god above us god
[33:33] in us and
[33:34] my what a perfect family heading back to
[33:37] a garden time experience again so let's
[33:40] pick it up here brother brown said he
[33:42] had made us there are certain truths
[33:44] that we won't need to emphasize and this
[33:47] is one of them he
[33:49] he have made us salvation is his doing
[33:53] he has made us it's his work salvation
[33:56] is of the lord all of grace he redeemed
[33:59] us for that purpose he brought us for
[34:02] that purpose he bought us for that
[34:03] person purpose we are kings and
[34:06] spiritual kings oh he said we're going
[34:08] to be kings upon the earth with him when
[34:10] he sets on the throne but now can you
[34:12] say now with me this morning we are
[34:15] spiritual kings and we reign over a
[34:16] spiritual kingdom
[34:19] and he said colossians 1 13 says who had
[34:21] delivered us from the power of darkness
[34:24] has translated us into the kingdom reign
[34:26] of his dear son
[34:28] catch this now this morning says right
[34:30] now we reign with christ
[34:33] having dominion in other words having
[34:35] power over sin
[34:37] the world the flesh and the devil
[34:39] showing forth his praise and his glory
[34:43] showing forth himself have been the same
[34:46] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[34:49] and forever the god above us god with us
[34:52] now god in us right now reigning with
[34:55] christ have a dominion over sin the
[34:58] world the flesh and the devil showing
[35:00] forth his praises and his glory he said
[35:02] showing forth himself
[35:05] do you like that this morning for it is
[35:07] christ in us willing and doing of his
[35:10] good pleasure yes indeed even now we are
[35:13] setting in heavenly places in christ
[35:16] jesus what a position to be in this
[35:18] morning amen then now that we had a
[35:21] message of the hour he had a a prophetic
[35:24] gift in this hour he better caught a
[35:27] glimpse of the uh of the mind of god and
[35:30] it came and brought it to to you and i
[35:32] as believers blessed are your ears that
[35:35] you can hear and blessed are your eyes
[35:36] that you can see and hey bestow the
[35:39] message begin to declare that we are
[35:42] free and we begin to declare where we
[35:44] came from if we know where we came from
[35:46] we know where we're going and this
[35:48] present day that we're living in we can
[35:50] live victorious knowing hey but nothing
[35:53] on earth no power of hell could ever
[35:56] stop the plan of god's redemption hey
[35:59] before he said in his word he couldn't
[36:00] lose one of us do you believe that it's
[36:03] impossible for god to lose one of us
[36:06] amen and we had a message in this hour
[36:08] to begin to declare true justification
[36:11] amen that he wasn't an initiator but he
[36:13] began to restore all those truths and
[36:15] begin to pound together and brought a
[36:18] picture of grace to you and i that amen
[36:21] that we can begin to see true
[36:22] justification as though you've never
[36:25] done it in the first place they better
[36:27] told you that you was a part of god
[36:30] before the foundation of the world and
[36:32] he been told you that sister jamie that
[36:34] you was never a chick and you always was
[36:37] an eagle because if you was a son you
[36:39] always was a son
[36:41] amen and it would begin to tell us
[36:42] little stories and and how that began to
[36:45] echo in our hearts and everybody told us
[36:47] about the three hebrew children how that
[36:49] they would have been beginning to walk
[36:51] to death row and before they ever got
[36:53] there that the prophet god said that the
[36:55] lord jesus or god rather a bed took the
[36:58] heat out of the fire and let the fire
[37:01] keep burning on hey but what he did he
[37:03] took the very element to destroy them
[37:06] out of the picture and that's exactly
[37:08] what happened that day at calvary he bet
[37:11] he took it he said he'd allow the fire
[37:12] to keep burning on but he took the very
[37:15] element to destroy you out of the
[37:18] equation hey man so he began to catch
[37:20] these little nuggets up from the message
[37:23] of the hour and because we see where we
[37:26] came from and we'll see where we're
[37:28] going we can live victorious in 2021
[37:32] knowing if god before us who can be
[37:35] against us
[37:36] you believe that this morning
[37:38] and because we know where we came from
[37:42] and we know that we came from god
[37:44] we're going back to god and
[37:46] my says plan of redemption
[37:49] now john 4 13 says
[37:51] jesus answers said unto her whosoever
[37:54] drank of this water shall thirst again
[37:58] but whosoever drinketh the water that i
[38:00] shall give him shall never thirst but
[38:03] the water that i shall give him shall be
[38:05] in him
[38:07] a well of water springing up to
[38:09] everlasting life
[38:11] even in other words this water is not
[38:13] going to forsake you hey but actually
[38:15] the word everlasting comes from a greek
[38:18] word meaning a adios it never had a
[38:20] beginning and never can't have it in
[38:23] even that which always has been and
[38:25] always will be and it can never cease it
[38:28] could never go into extinct amen what a
[38:31] god race in this hour they've been there
[38:33] was god above us
[38:35] amen that had a plan then it was god
[38:37] with us jesus provided the plan that god
[38:41] had abandoned when he extended up on
[38:43] high he rewrapped the gift and he sent
[38:46] it in the form of the holy ghost with
[38:48] the same power with the same authority
[38:52] hallelujah able to come and live and you
[38:55] and i that we can be victorious that we
[38:58] can be jesus and pride form
[39:01] with the same power with the same
[39:03] anointing never to cease no wonder god
[39:06] our brother brandon could pick up the
[39:08] mind of god and say you can die no more
[39:10] than god can die
[39:12] you can no more cease than god can cease
[39:14] because in you
[39:17] hallelujah in you
[39:19] is a well springing up to everlasting
[39:22] life and hell can't put it out
[39:25] amen brother brown says it like this he
[39:27] says that when the human element goes
[39:29] out
[39:30] well that's the greatest battle
[39:32] and the spirit of god fills that vacancy
[39:36] where you empty yourself he said then
[39:38] will it be when church is in the power
[39:40] of his resurrection
[39:42] of the lord jesus listen to what brother
[39:45] brown says here he says we'll walk in
[39:47] his steps we'll walk in his power we'll
[39:51] walk in his thoughts we'll walk in his
[39:54] being and in his moving he said you see
[39:57] what i mean then your thoughts would
[39:59] become words and words would become
[40:02] material he said that's when the church
[40:05] is in power and the gates of hell shall
[40:08] not prevail against you brother man said
[40:11] like this he said the rod in moses hand
[40:14] is jesus name and his bride or the
[40:17] church amen if the surroundings couldn't
[40:20] stop moses with a rod in his hands i
[40:23] believe this morning amen by the grace
[40:26] of god i am what i am there's no
[40:29] surroundings going to be able to stop
[40:30] this bride either she's made out of
[40:33] stuff that just can't be bluffed it goes
[40:36] beyond our power it goes beyond our
[40:38] ability it's amazing grace how sweet the
[40:42] sound that saved the rest like me
[40:45] amen he said that's when the church is
[40:47] in power even where's you empty yourself
[40:50] out and the churches and the power of
[40:53] the resurrection of the lord jesus no

[41:09] to shout this morning amen so there's
[41:12] something within us

[41:22] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[41:26] come means to descend and operate in one
[41:30] listen god isn't operating above us
[41:34] behind us but in us
[41:37] hallelujah so if you shall receive this
[41:40] power from this dynamo the strength of
[41:43] god is greater than any affliction that
[41:46] cometh can come upon you amen first john
[41:48] says it like this but you have an
[41:50] unction and brother said the word
[41:52] unction comes from a greek word that
[41:54] means dynamite from the dynamo and the
[41:57] dynamo is a in a forceful energetic
[42:00] being amen it provides your power it

[49:40] within you a fire that's a burning
[49:43] that's not lit by man but lit by god and

[49:56] there's no persecution of the world can
[49:58] blow out the flame that god has lit
[50:02] for it's god's purpose that the
[50:04] torchlight of freedom will burn unto the
[50:07] coming of the lord
[50:09] and no powers can blow it out they would
[50:13] only make it burn that much brighter as
[50:16] they blow now keep that in mind this
[50:18] morning

[50:26] began to show itself through
[50:28] and one of these days he will come and
[50:30] receive you unto himself then the whole
[50:32] thing will be changed he said then the
[50:34] negative shadow will become the positive
[50:37] hallelujah that part of you that never
[50:39] had a beginning he said the kingdom of
[50:42] god is coming the kingdom of god is
[50:44] coming it's becoming more from the
[50:47] negative to the positive as it being see
[50:50] he said we're just drawing closer to god
[50:53] all the time therefore when the positive
[50:57] becomes closer to the negative the
[51:00] negative is swallowed up in the positive
[51:04] listen friends darkness cannot swallow
[51:06] up light but light can swallow up
[51:08] darkness
[51:09] the negative can't swallow up the
[51:11] positive the deposit were built to
[51:14] possess the gates of his enemy
[51:16] hallelujah no wonder paul would say like
[51:18] no corruption corruptable shall have put
[51:21] on incorruption
[51:22] and this mortal shall have put on
[51:25] immortality he been oh death this is not
[51:28] just a saying paul was seeing the
[51:31] victory
[51:33] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[51:36] world and the prophet said if you
[51:38] believe it it causes a substance and
[51:41] that substance creates a perfect faith
[51:43] and that perfect faith masters every
[51:46] circumstance
[51:48] so no matter what you're facing this
[51:49] morning if you would take god at his
[51:52] word and believe it
[51:56] and that believing causes a substance
[52:00] and that substance is a direct positive
[52:03] and that direct positive creates
[52:06] a perfect faith
[52:08] hallelujah and that perfect faith
[52:12] has the ability to master every
[52:15] circumstance
[52:16] no wonder paul said oh death
[52:19] where is this thing
[52:21] he was looking death right in the face
[52:23] but he wasn't seeing what the world was
[52:25] saying hey then he looked past it not
[52:28] just a saying he meant that what was
[52:31] happening death was being swallowed up
[52:34] of the positive
[52:35] death he was looking at it remember we
[52:38] don't have to take the stinger from
[52:39] death god jesus christ already done it
[52:42] hallelujah that that this greatest
[52:45] weapon already was defeated that day at
[52:48] calvary
[52:49] hallelujah and we're beneficiary of that
[52:52] no wonder paul was looking right and
[52:54] death in the face with a natural high
[52:56] sister allison but he would scream out
[52:58] oh death where is dasting
[53:02] grey where is thy victory
[53:05] but thanks be to god which given us a
[53:08] victory through our lord jesus christ he
[53:10] been darkness cannot swallow up light
[53:13] but like the negative amen begin to be
[53:16] swallowed up of the positive and that's
[53:19] what's going to happen church as we are
[53:21] drawing closer to god even this world a
[53:24] man that doesn't have no ties on us at
[53:27] all and we're going to walk right out of
[53:29] this dimension into that dimension hey
[53:32] but in this negative
[53:34] amen was going to be swallowed up from
[53:36] the positive that part of you that never
[53:39] had a beginning and never will have an
[53:41] end and that positive is down inside of
[53:44] your soul right now every time you fall
[53:47] every time you make a mistake everybody
[53:49] down inside of humanity is laying the
[53:52] churn seat of life
[53:54] hallelujah and that is the positive
[53:59] because brother brown said it like this
[54:01] he said he took a picture of you
[54:04] he been
[54:05] and placed it on file before the
[54:07] foundation of the world
[54:09] amen he said that's the absolute that's
[54:12] the positive this is only the negative
[54:15] we're born of a woman in a few days and
[54:17] full of trouble
[54:19] hallelujah
[54:20] but down inside of you amen we don't
[54:23] receive the seed out of the altar we
[54:25] always was the seed amen you was born in
[54:28] this world you weren't born to chicken
[54:31] you was born to eagle you might not know
[54:33] that for so long but when that and that
[54:36] scream come past your way when that
[54:39] shout came forth amen blessed all your
[54:41] ears are here and your eyes to see
[54:45] amen it was a predestinated moment of
[54:47] time hey man there's nothing can ever
[54:49] blow it out something down inside of you
[54:52] is drawing you back where you came from
[54:56] amen
[54:57] now john tells us no man
[55:00] can come to me
[55:02] except
[55:03] the father draw with him
[55:05] draw means from an inward power
[55:08] drawn caused by
[55:09] to be moved and continuous toward to
[55:12] come or attract a an
[55:15] attractive force

[55:32] will raise him up
[55:35] at the last day
[55:36] another word sister betty he that begun
[55:39] this good work in you is also going to
[55:41] bring it to an end he's the author and
[55:44] the finisher of our faith he said in
[55:47] christ the mystery of god the first even
[55:49] knew it but she failed but this echoes
[55:52] she'll know it but she can't fall why
[55:55] because he's came himself he condemned
[55:57] send it down back to humanity that he
[56:00] can live in you and live a victorious
[56:03] life for you
[56:04] that you can overcome lady osea not by
[56:07] your own abilities by his grace

[56:40] that he was from the heavens
[56:42] and he's living now on earth it's dark
[56:45] it's gloomy it's wary of sometimes but
[56:48] he said if that dew job could talk he
[56:50] could say it like this just in a few
[56:52] moments there's going to be a rising of
[56:55] the s-u-n and that s-u-n has the ability
[56:59] to pull me back draw me out of this lady

[57:25] out of our feelings our emotions or
[57:28] whatever we may be going through

[1:06:36] man can surrender so much to god where
[1:06:39] the devil just don't know what to do

[1:06:43] not that you don't hurt not that you
[1:06:45] don't go through trials
[1:06:48] but we have a peace that path is all
[1:06:50] understanding
[1:06:52] knowing the lord giveth and the lord
[1:06:55] taketh away

[1:09:13] this is a prophet of god
[1:09:16] sometimes he says with all this going on
[1:09:18] a man of god

[1:09:23] engulfed
[1:09:24] everywhere i look

[1:14:44] away
[1:14:45] blessed be the name of the lord i know

[1:14:56] even when he was going through his
[1:14:57] greatest trial
[1:14:59] god was tightening him up
[1:15:02] to his absolute
[1:15:04] do you believe that
[1:15:05] so the greatest weapon in the world
[1:15:09] brother brown says is not atomic bombs
[1:15:13] but he said a believer
[1:15:15] in contact with his maker
[1:15:18] hallelujah don't you believe that hey
[1:15:20] but when he's got a hold of you atomic
[1:15:23] bombs ain't got nothing on you

[1:18:55] luke tells us this notwithstanding and
[1:18:58] rejoice not that spirits are subject to
[1:19:01] you and they are
[1:19:02] he said but rather rejoice because your
[1:19:06] names were written in the heavens
[1:19:09] before the foundation of the world god
[1:19:12] wrote your name on the land's book of
[1:19:15] life all devils out of hell can't erase
[1:19:18] it out of it he said they can't erase it
[1:19:21] out of there god wrote it brother harvey
[1:19:24] and he said he spoke it
[1:19:26] hallelujah before there was a world
[1:19:29] amen before there was a creation
[1:19:32] before there was a satan
[1:19:34] before you ever sinned
[1:19:36] before you ever came to this world
[1:19:38] hallelujah god wrote your name on the
[1:19:42] land's book of life and spoke your name
[1:19:46] amen and his word can never return unto
[1:19:49] him void he spoke it and it will come to
[1:19:53] pass
[1:19:54] hallelujah can never
[1:19:56] never come back void
[1:19:58] he said heavens and earth will pass away
[1:20:01] but my word shall never never
[1:20:05] fade away never cease never be stopped
[1:20:09] and before there was a world
[1:20:11] hallelujah and listen nothing in time
[1:20:14] can change what she was there in
[1:20:16] eternity
[1:20:17] don't rejoice because spirits are
[1:20:19] subject to you this morning but rejoice
[1:20:22] before there was a world before there
[1:20:24] was satan before there was a hell god
[1:20:27] spoke your name and placed it on the
[1:20:30] land's book of life he placed it in his
[1:20:33] book a predestinated seed it's his book
[1:20:38] oh hallelujah it's his family tree
[1:20:41] it's his
[1:20:42] family
[1:20:44] i'm not going to lose one of them
[1:20:47] nobody can prime out then the scripture
[1:20:49] will talk about how beasts would rise up
[1:20:51] out of
[1:20:52] he said and begin to conquer and begin
[1:20:55] deceive all great and small
[1:20:57] so many church memories pretend
[1:20:59] christians and deceive all whose names
[1:21:04] brotherhood i'm glad that he didn't stop
[1:21:05] there but he said he was going to save
[1:21:08] all great and small every church member
[1:21:12] he deceived all whose names
[1:21:15] were not written not in a church book
[1:21:17] but in the land's book of life before
[1:21:20] the foundation of the world he said god
[1:21:23] wrote your name in the land's book of
[1:21:26] life by his
[1:21:28] spoken word
[1:21:31] hallelujah he been maybe not literally
[1:21:33] with a pen but he wrote your name in the
[1:21:36] land's book of life abandoned spy his
[1:21:39] spoken word that can never be defeated
[1:21:42] that's reason why he said that picture
[1:21:45] of you a fan that god put on file can
[1:21:49] never cease that the devil no devils out
[1:21:52] of hell can break that image
[1:21:56] and here you are in humanity and what
[1:21:58] you were you came this world amen the
[1:22:01] same way every one of us did besides
[1:22:03] jesus christ amen but now this earth

[1:22:08] from but there's another drawing power
[1:22:11] they've been from above is drawing your
[1:22:13] soul
[1:22:14] back where it came from so it's a
[1:22:17] constant battle as we get older this
[1:22:19] this whole earth begins to draw our
[1:22:21] shoulders and wrinkle our faces the
[1:22:24] aches and the pains why because we're
[1:22:26] being pulled back to the earth where we
[1:22:29] came from but down inside of that old
[1:22:32] draw down body called flesh is a germ
[1:22:35] seed of life amen that god has drawn it
[1:22:38] back so it's a constant battle
[1:22:41] it's a battle in humanity
[1:22:44] but greater is he that is in me than the
[1:22:47] he that's in the world
[1:22:50] this body ain't gonna have the last save
[1:22:53] hell's not gonna have the last say
[1:22:56] hallelujah have been parting or noise
[1:22:59] this is a sound of freedom amen because
[1:23:02] this pride is rejoicing because now she
[1:23:05] knows where she came from and where
[1:23:08] she's going and nothing in time can
[1:23:11] change
[1:23:14] hallelujah don't you love the lord this
[1:23:15] morning
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:20] before there was a foundation of the
[1:23:22] world god wrote your name in the land's
