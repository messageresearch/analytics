[46:38] see you tonight God bless you thank you
[46:40] for coming uh his mistake was was uh
[46:44] telling what we would call a white lie
[46:47] it it would it wasn't really that bad at
[46:49] all or what we would think was bad but
[46:51] brother random showed that it wasn't
[46:52] Christ because he never lied aren't you
[46:55] glad for that aren't you glad that he's
[46:57] not a man that he could lie and he come
[47:00] down even in a body of Flesh he couldn't
[47:01] lie which the flesh was man was human
[47:04] but he did not tell a lie now being that
[47:08] he had made that mistake it was you find
[47:10] in Genesis
[47:12] 46:33 and it says it shall come to pass
[47:15] when Pharaoh shall call you and shall
[47:17] say what is your occupation this is
[47:19] ringing really bad she'll say what is
[47:21] your occupation he says that you shall
[47:23] say thy servant's trade hath been about
[47:26] cattle from our youth even until now
[47:28] both we and also our fathers that you
[47:31] may dwell in the land of Goan for every
[47:33] Shepherd is an abomination of the
[47:35] Egyptians we just got done talking about
[47:36] Abraham and you can really see that
[47:39] family strain there's just a a little
[47:41] bit of cowardice in that family tree
[47:43] because Abraham did it and Isaac did it
[47:46] and now Joseph is trying to get them say
[47:48] well just kind of fudge about who you
[47:50] are but that's not what he was supposed
[47:52] to do and his father Jacob who had
[47:55] learned better in his life he said the
[47:57] Father the spirit wouldn't let him do it
[47:59] he said your servants the shepherd so
[48:01] you see brother brand said Joseph there
[48:04] making a mistake so he was making a
[48:07] mistake now we know that Jesus is the
[48:11] perfect one in First Peter 2:21 he said
[48:13] for even here unto were you called
[48:16] because Christ also suffered for us
[48:20] leaving us an example that you should
[48:23] follow his steps he never told us to
[48:26] follow the steps of Moses or to follow
[48:28] the steps of uh of Joshua to follow the
[48:31] steps of David but he said follow the
[48:34] steps of Christ who did no sin neither
[48:37] was guile found in his mouth who when he
[48:40] was reviled reviled not again if you go
[48:43] back to that Gile found in his mouth
[48:45] that's that was the mark against Joseph
[48:48] is that there was G found in his mouth
[48:50] but this one never even told a white lie
[48:52] when he was
[48:54] reviled he reviled not again when he
[48:56] suffered he threatened not oh that we
[48:59] could follow those steps tonight that's
[49:01] the kind of steps I want to walk in he
[49:03] said but committed himself to him that
[49:05] judgeth righteously who his own self
[49:07] bear our sins in his own body on the
[49:10] tree that we being dead to sin should
[49:13] live unto righteousness by whose Stripes
[49:16] ye were
[49:18] healed amen he was the perfect son right
[49:23] the perfect the only perfect human ever
[49:27] and so you can just let yourself off the
[49:28] hook there you're never going to be
[49:31] perfect because he was the only perfect
[49:33] one we are perfected by his blood was
[49:37] shed on Calvary every Prophet was
[49:39] imperfect but Jesus was the
[49:43] Masterpiece he was the Masterpiece
[49:45] brother BR said what was he he was that
[49:48] perfect word reflected for bread I love
[49:52] this that every man should live by he
[49:55] was that wheat of God's word that could
[49:58] be ground and put in the four gospels 66
[50:02] books and man shall live by that and
[50:05] that alone and every word of it he said
[50:08] that was Michelangelo's Masterpiece and
[50:10] when God could see himself reflected in
[50:13] a man he had that perfect man created in
[50:17] his own image he said oh my what a man
[50:20] he had to die for all of us and he died
[50:23] the perfect one that we imperfect could
[50:26] be made perfect in him aren't you glad
[50:29] for him today I think we could all say
[50:31] Amen to that aren't you glad for the
[50:33] perfect one we could be made perfect in
[50:35] him you kids you worry about making
[50:37] mistakes and offending your pastor or
[50:40] the your parents or something like that
[50:42] don't don't worry about it remember
[50:44] you're human but God is is the perfect
[50:47] one he came in a body of Flesh to pay
[50:49] for my mistakes and your mistakes I'm so
[50:53] glad that he did we shouldn't we
[50:54] shouldn't worry about our mistakes I
[50:56] said before get up and try again that's
[50:58] absolutely what we ought to
[51:00] do absolutely what we ought to do is get
[51:02] up and go because that's exactly we're
[51:05] we're children of God we're not saves
[51:07] anymore we're children of God if we if
[51:10] we make a mistake we should repent
[51:12] quickly and move on and what does
[51:14] repentance take repentance take just a
[51:16] moment and say Lord I'm sorry and I'm
[51:18] moving on sure there's things you can do
[51:21] to scar your life in such a way that
[51:23] there are people on this Earth that have
[51:25] scarred so badly they can't even be
[51:27] around other people shut up in a prison
[51:30] somewhere or or in a prison of their own
[51:32] making and unable but they can still
[51:33] experience the love of God they can
[51:36] still be born again they can still
[51:39] experience the cleansing of the
[51:42] blood right the perfect one learned
[51:46] obedience through
[51:48] suffering now how can a perfect one
[51:51] learn well the thing is he he matured
[51:57] he matured he was born as a baby into
[52:00] the world right Jesus didn't come out of
[52:04] the womb talking in King James
[52:08] English right he wasn't just born saying
[52:13] thou Mary Who Bore me you know that's
[52:16] not the way he talked he'd come out
[52:18] talking just like we did goo goo and you
[52:21] know just like our babies
[52:24] do right whatever is however a baby
[52:27] talks I don't it's been so long as my
[52:29] kids were small I don't remember but
[52:31] however a baby talks that's the way he
[52:33] talked and he cried like a baby he
[52:36] talked like a baby and he and he learned
[52:39] you know if they had bicycles back then
[52:41] he'd learned to ride a
[52:43] bike right they had to teach him how to
[52:44] ride a bike he just because he was God
[52:47] in flesh but he learned as a
[52:50] human Oh Oh my he had to learn even
[52:54] never making a mistake
[52:57] yet he had to be tempted and he had to
[52:59] be tried and he had to grow he had to
[53:01] learn so don't give up on yourself you
[53:04] just have to learn youve got something
[53:06] to you got room to grow you got a you
[53:08] got room to to move up and so over time
[53:12] we grow and we learn the problem is when
[53:14] you see someone stuck in babyhood we
[53:16] don't want to stay there we want to move
[53:18] on we want to grow we want to become a
[53:20] mature son or daughter of
[53:23] God right and so he was the perfect one
[53:26] Hebrews 5'8 says though he were a son
[53:30] yet learned he
[53:32] obedience by the things which he
[53:35] suffered obedience I don't think I think
[53:38] we look at this wrong because we look at
[53:40] it as if he was disobedient and he
[53:42] learned to obey but he couldn't have
[53:44] been disobedient to God and been the
[53:47] perfect one so he didn't learn to move
[53:50] from Disobedience to obedience what did
[53:52] he learn he learned obedience in other
[53:55] words he he learned a maturity in his
[53:59] reactions that maybe wouldn't have been
[54:01] there at first because he had to go to a
[54:04] cross for you and I and even then he had
[54:07] to say nevertheless not my will but
[54:09] thine be done and that takes a great
[54:12] deal of
[54:15] maturity so Hebrews 5:9 says and being
[54:18] made perfect that's being matur being
[54:21] fully matured he became the author of
[54:25] Eternal salvation unto all them that
[54:29] obey him now watch in brother BR said in
[54:32] plain language the very character of
[54:35] Jesus was perfected by someone say it
[54:39] suffering and according to Paul he has
[54:42] left his church a measure of suffering
[54:46] that they too by their faith in God
[54:48] while suffering for him would come to a
[54:50] place of perfection now this is
[54:54] obviously not speaking of sinless
[54:55] perfection because we we are perfect by
[54:58] the blood of Jesus Christ right and
[55:01] nothing can take that away if you've
[55:03] been born again and no matter what
[55:05] you've done where you've been you're
[55:06] perfect in that way but yet you're not
[55:08] born a full grown man or a full grown
[55:11] woman you have to grow up into Christ
[55:13] and so so you have to you have to mature
[55:16] now we we don't have a record of Jesus
[55:19] early years except for one thing we have
[55:22] a record of his birth but we don't have
[55:23] a record of his early years except for a
[55:25] brief visit to to the temple when he was
[55:27] 12 and you find Jesus at the temple you
[55:29] remember he's down there instructing the
[55:32] scholars right and he's already got the
[55:35] wisdom to be able to do that and yet
[55:39] when his parents come to get him the
[55:40] Bible says he subjected themselves or
[55:43] himself to to them he said I must be
[55:46] about my father's business yet he didn't
[55:49] go back to the temple and break away
[55:51] from his family and go down there and
[55:52] start teaching people he didn't begin
[55:54] his ministry for many many more years he
[55:58] doesn't reemerge until he's 30 years old
[56:00] now look what a perfect type this is of
[56:03] Joseph Joseph went through his years of
[56:06] suffering and and then in Genesis 41:46
[56:09] Joseph was 30 years old when he stood
[56:12] before Pharaoh king of
[56:14] Egypt and and so it was a there was
[56:17] something about that age that maturity
[56:19] that he had reached through suffering
[56:22] before that time he was able to do that
[56:24] now even when Jes Jesus began his
[56:27] ministry he wasn't like some people who
[56:29] just uh well I got saved yesterday let
[56:31] me go find a church you know and I'll go
[56:34] Pastor a church I I got saved last week
[56:36] so I'll go become a deacon that's not
[56:38] what he did at all but Jesus when he was
[56:40] on the Earth was actually reluctant to
[56:43] begin his own Ministry because and it
[56:46] showed what it showed what was in him
[56:48] the character that was in him because
[56:50] when he began his ministry it was
[56:52] obviously the will of God for him to do
[56:53] it and yet he even was reluctant when
[56:55] his mother come to him and said they
[56:57] don't have any wine for the wedding and
[57:00] Jesus said woman what have I to do with
[57:02] thee this is John 2:4 my hour is not yet
[57:07] come right but what's he doing he's not
[57:09] being rebellious but what's he doing
[57:11] he's waiting and the Bible tells us to
[57:14] wait on our ministry to wait to to make
[57:17] sure or make our calling and our
[57:19] election sure there's nothing wrong with
[57:21] waiting if you feel led of God to do
[57:24] something wait right and see if it's the
[57:27] will of the Lord you don't always you
[57:29] know we don't just go by feelings cuz
[57:31] feelings can lie to you feelings your
[57:33] heart will lead you wrong the the Bible
[57:35] says it's it's incredibly Wicked your
[57:37] heart is and it's deceitful above all
[57:40] things so you don't just go by what you
[57:42] feel but you wait and you wait and you
[57:44] wait until the proper time and when the
[57:47] proper time comes and brother Brown
[57:48] makes a statement he said when when
[57:50] God's men if you really called to do
[57:52] something we read it Sunday night he
[57:54] said God has to almost force you into do
[57:56] it into your proper place but in the
[57:59] meantime he said well what can I do in
[58:00] the meantime do what needs to be done
[58:03] whatever that is but don't try to
[58:05] overstep what you are are you with me so
[58:08] far so there come a time though in Jesus
[58:12] life that the father came down in an
[58:14] adoption
[58:15] ceremony and said this is my beloved Son
[58:19] in whom I'm well pleased hear ye him oh
[58:22] my and Jesus was not reluctant then to
[58:26] to go and do what he was called to do
[58:29] because he had been it had been
[58:30] confirmed that he was he was the son of
[58:33] God that had come to full maturity and
[58:36] that's the place that God wants to bring
[58:37] us to now Joseph had to reach a place of
[58:40] maturity in his life he he always seemed
[58:43] to do the right thing Joseph did he
[58:45] wasn't a bad kid he was a very good kid
[58:48] but he needed maturity and sometimes we
[58:52] we look at that and we think well here's
[58:54] a person who was raised in church and
[58:56] you young people being raised in church
[58:58] what a wonderful blessing that is but
[59:00] but yet you you still don't have
[59:02] maturity until you've gone through some
[59:03] things so there's going to be some
[59:05] things ahead and I'll say to you now
[59:08] don't get discouraged don't be
[59:09] downhearted you say well this one fell
[59:12] and that one fell and and that one went
[59:14] away and and this one that I trusted
[59:16] they turned out not to to be false but
[59:18] you had to go through that to be who you
[59:20] are are you hearing me tonight you had
[59:22] to go through that you had to experience
[59:24] that maybe parents that let you down
[59:26] family members that let you down people
[59:28] that let you down you had to experience
[59:30] that and I'll say I've reached a place
[59:31] in my life for the Caleb where I'm so
[59:33] thankful for the way I was brought up
[59:35] because I know I can look back it was
[59:37] hard sometimes it was very hard on me it
[59:39] was hard on my mother it was hard on my
[59:41] siblings but yet I know if God hadn't
[59:43] brought me through that I couldn't be
[59:45] what I am today I couldn't be where God
[59:47] has placed me today and so I also know
[59:50] that the things that I'm going through
[59:51] today that God's going to use that to
[59:53] bring me to something tomorrow are you
[59:55] with me now we got to have that kind of
[59:57] perspective about it and God's going to
[59:59] allow us to go through these things
[1:00:01] until we gain the right
[1:00:05] perspective and maybe that'll be right
[1:00:07] before the Rapture I don't know but we
[1:00:09] got to reach that place of
[1:00:12] maturity where we don't get too high and
[1:00:15] we don't get too
[1:00:16] low
[1:00:18] huh right where Satan can't steal from
[1:00:21] us on every occasion but we learn how to
[1:00:24] lock down our spirit
[1:00:27] right to keep him from casting out every
[1:00:29] evil
[1:00:30] thought right where we don't we don't
[1:00:33] just open ourselves up to everything the
[1:00:35] devil
[1:00:36] offers right so you young people I'll
[1:00:39] say this find someone older and learn
[1:00:41] from that person if you're a young
[1:00:44] Deacon you find an older Deacon and
[1:00:45] learn from that Deacon if you're a young
[1:00:47] preacher you find an older preacher and
[1:00:49] learn from that preacher and I still
[1:00:51] have to do that today and I'm not old
[1:00:53] but I've got a lot of miles on me but
[1:00:55] but still look at older ministers and
[1:00:57] say how did you do it how what what have
[1:00:59] you come through and I like to hear
[1:01:01] those stories I like to sit there and
[1:01:02] talk to them because I know that they
[1:01:04] know something that I don't know and I
[1:01:06] want to I want to make it I want to be
[1:01:08] one of those guys one of these days that
[1:01:10] that's made it 30 years or 50 years with
[1:01:12] the Lord teres and in order to do that I
[1:01:14] know I've got to learn from
[1:01:15] them are you with me now well how did
[1:01:19] you get where you're at so Joseph had to
[1:01:22] learn
[1:01:23] that the Bible tells us in Genesis 3
[1:01:26] 72 Begins the story of Joseph it said
[1:01:29] these are the generations of Jacob
[1:01:31] Joseph being 17 years old what Mark that
[1:01:34] in your mind was feeding the flock with
[1:01:37] his Brethren so he was Peter's age not
[1:01:40] to not to call out Peter but Peter and
[1:01:42] trip I think is 17 as well so we got
[1:01:45] several 17 year olds are you Emma are
[1:01:48] you 17 yet you're 17 so that's there's
[1:01:51] three of them at least so I'm preaching
[1:01:53] right at you all tonight
[1:01:57] and Jacob Joseph was 17 years old and
[1:02:00] was feeding the flock with his Brethren
[1:02:01] so he just got a
[1:02:03] job
[1:02:04] right and the lad was with the sons of
[1:02:07] bilha and with the sons of Zila his
[1:02:09] father's wives and we may go into that
[1:02:11] at some point there was all kinds of
[1:02:13] friction in the family because anytime
[1:02:14] you have anytime you have a mixed family
[1:02:17] there always going to be friction that's
[1:02:19] why God didn't ordain polygamy man did
[1:02:21] that God allowed it but God it wasn't in
[1:02:24] his perfect will
[1:02:26] it was something that God allowed
[1:02:28] because he knew the nature of men
[1:02:29] without the Holy
[1:02:30] Ghost right but but this with the Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost I believe you can be happy with
[1:02:34] one
[1:02:35] wife amen not just preachers but
[1:02:38] everybody just throw that in there for
[1:02:40] the polygamist Among
[1:02:43] Us hope there's not
[1:02:46] any so Joseph brought unto his F now now
[1:02:49] watch this is such a such an interesting
[1:02:52] thing I just love the scriptures Joseph
[1:02:55] brought into his father their evil
[1:02:58] report that's interesting isn't
[1:03:00] it right he's 17 years old he just got
[1:03:04] his first job and the very first thing
[1:03:05] that's written about him is him telling
[1:03:07] on his
[1:03:14] brothers now they didn't have a cause to
[1:03:16] hate him but they thought they
[1:03:20] did now we don't we don't know what the
[1:03:23] report was it was evil report it might
[1:03:24] have been they they ate their food with
[1:03:26] their hands instead of using a fork we
[1:03:28] don't we don't know what it was that
[1:03:31] that they he found to tattle on them
[1:03:33] about and and and what he did even he
[1:03:36] was probably in the right in telling
[1:03:38] because these were not too good of boys
[1:03:40] you know they were doing some stuff they
[1:03:42] shouldn't have been doing probably we
[1:03:44] know that by some of the other things
[1:03:45] that they did so what he did what may
[1:03:48] have been right but he couldn't be a
[1:03:51] help to his brothers at this stage in
[1:03:53] his
[1:03:54] life because he hadn't been through
[1:03:56] anything
[1:03:57] yet he was his father's favorite son
[1:04:00] we'll get to that in another message but
[1:04:03] he was a he was actually uh uh he he saw
[1:04:07] himself as that he saw himself he had a
[1:04:09] vision on his life he had a purpose in
[1:04:11] his life he had a future in his life and
[1:04:15] so he and he knew all of that are you
[1:04:17] still with me I know it's a Wednesday
[1:04:18] night but I just want to try to paint
[1:04:20] this picture to you he knew all of that
[1:04:23] and so and so he he recognized hey I'm
[1:04:27] special right but he didn't have the
[1:04:30] humility to help his brothers yet he
[1:04:33] could see the problem but he couldn't
[1:04:35] fix
[1:04:36] it and that takes obedience learned by
[1:04:42] suffering see to voluntarily lay down
[1:04:45] our will in favor of the father's will
[1:04:48] that only comes through
[1:04:51] suffering Joseph is a tail Bearer
[1:04:55] right according to that scripture see
[1:04:57] because just because we know something
[1:04:59] is true doesn't mean we should tell
[1:05:01] it there are some things that have to be
[1:05:04] told but many times we tell things that
[1:05:07] don't have to be told to people who
[1:05:09] don't have to hear
[1:05:11] it right and the Bible says Leviticus
[1:05:14] 19:16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a
[1:05:18] tail Bearer among the people neither
[1:05:20] shalt thou stand against the blood of
[1:05:22] thy neighbor I am the Lord proverbs
[1:05:25] 11:13 the tail Bearer reveal the secrets
[1:05:28] but he that is of a faithful spirit I
[1:05:30] say oh God give me a faithful Spirit
[1:05:33] conceal the
[1:05:34] matter Proverbs 188 the words of a tail
[1:05:37] Bearer are as wounds and they go down
[1:05:40] into the innermost parts of the belly
[1:05:44] Proverbs 2019 he that goeth about as a
[1:05:46] tail Bearer reveal Secrets therefore
[1:05:48] meddle not with him that flattereth with
[1:05:51] his lips other words somebody going
[1:05:53] around always telling you uh always
[1:05:55] telling you how good you are and how
[1:05:57] much they love you and all this and not
[1:05:59] that a person shouldn't say I love you
[1:06:01] but this is where someone just always
[1:06:03] buttering you up you know there's
[1:06:04] something wrong what are they wanting
[1:06:07] information right they're looking for
[1:06:10] information so so listen what he says he
[1:06:13] said where no wood is there the fire
[1:06:15] goeth
[1:06:16] out so where there is no tail Bearer The
[1:06:19] Strife
[1:06:21] ceaseth I preach this a lot because I
[1:06:23] live here
[1:06:26] and living in Hardy is a lot like being
[1:06:27] on Mars Hill in Acts 17 Paul went to
[1:06:30] Mars Hill he said for all the Athen
[1:06:32] Athenians and strangers which were there
[1:06:34] spent their time in nothing else but
[1:06:36] either to tell or hear not some new
[1:06:37] thing and that scripture spoke to
[1:06:44] me it's good to have brother Ron and
[1:06:46] sister Karina with us tonight as well I
[1:06:48] you know I uh it just we love our area
[1:06:51] don't we and I've I defend these people
[1:06:53] there's some people here have been
[1:06:54] through some things
[1:06:56] I've learned some things I don't believe
[1:06:57] our church is like that but but there
[1:06:59] are folks around and we just don't want
[1:07:02] to be any of those we don't be want to
[1:07:04] be of that number we're not supposed to
[1:07:07] be tail
[1:07:08] bearers James 3 And1 said my brethren be
[1:07:11] not many Masters no knowing that we
[1:07:13] shall receive the greater condemnation
[1:07:15] for verse two for in many things we
[1:07:17] offend all If any man offend not in word
[1:07:20] the same as a perfect man a mature man
[1:07:23] and able also to Bridle the whole whole
[1:07:26] body right he said he said this is
[1:07:29] maturity now if you're able to hold your
[1:07:31] tongue he said behold we put bits in the
[1:07:34] horses mouths that they may obey us and
[1:07:36] we turn about their whole body behold
[1:07:39] also the ships which though they be so
[1:07:41] great and are driven of fierce winds yet
[1:07:43] they are turned about with a very small
[1:07:45] Helm withs soever the governor listeth
[1:07:48] even so the tongue is a little member
[1:07:50] and boasteth great things behold how
[1:07:52] great a matter a little fire can
[1:07:56] you know and I know we all talk we all
[1:07:58] say things maybe we shouldn't say but
[1:08:00] how dare we go when we know that the
[1:08:03] wood is
[1:08:04] dry right a a and we sit there and blow
[1:08:08] on it and we we we we got our own little
[1:08:11] way we got a a propane torch in our back
[1:08:14] pocket we just sit
[1:08:17] there right and then and then was like
[1:08:19] well I don't know how fire
[1:08:23] started right
[1:08:27] sometimes CU we started
[1:08:29] it are you with me now I'm talking about
[1:08:32] maturity he said the tongue is a fire a
[1:08:35] world of iniquity so is the tongue among
[1:08:37] our members that it defileth the whole
[1:08:38] body and Seth on fire the cour of Nature
[1:08:41] and it is set on fire of Hell James
[1:08:43] didn't pull any
[1:08:45] punches he said for every kind of Beast
[1:08:47] and birds and serpents and things in the
[1:08:49] sea is tamed and have been tamed to
[1:08:51] mankind but the tongue can no man tame
[1:08:53] it is an unruly evil full of dead deadly
[1:08:55] poison he said therewith we bless we God
[1:08:58] even the father and therewith curse We
[1:09:00] Men which are made after the similitude
[1:09:02] of God out of the same mouth proceedeth
[1:09:05] blessing and cursing my brethren these
[1:09:07] things ought not so to be do the
[1:09:09] fountain send forth at the same place
[1:09:10] Sweet Water and bitter can the Fig Tree
[1:09:12] my brethren bear Olive berries either
[1:09:14] ofine figs so can no Fountain both yield
[1:09:16] salt water and fresh he said who is a
[1:09:19] wise man and endued with knowledge among
[1:09:21] you I you know I I wouldn't ask you to
[1:09:23] raise your hands but some of us you know
[1:09:25] we think well I've accumulated some
[1:09:27] wisdom well he said this is how you can
[1:09:29] tell let him show out of a good
[1:09:32] conversation that's a life a manner of
[1:09:34] Life his works with meekness of wisdom
[1:09:37] but if you have bitter envying and
[1:09:39] strife in your hearts no matter how old
[1:09:41] you are Glory not and lie not against
[1:09:45] the
[1:09:46] truth he said this wisdom descendeth not
[1:09:49] from above but is Earthly sensual
[1:09:51] devilish for where envying and strife is
[1:09:54] there is confus confusion and every evil
[1:09:57] work but the wisdom that is from above
[1:09:59] is first pure so what's he saying don't
[1:10:01] don't lie to yourselves if you got that
[1:10:03] in your heart you can't blame nobody
[1:10:05] else for that it's just immaturity and
[1:10:08] you need to get a hold of that
[1:10:10] tongue right Bridle it let and let let
[1:10:14] God begin to work in your life and begin
[1:10:16] to sow peace and mercy he said he said
[1:10:18] the wisdom that is from above is first
[1:10:20] pure then Peaceable gentle and easy to
[1:10:22] be entreated full of mercy and good
[1:10:24] fruits without partiality without
[1:10:26] hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness
[1:10:29] is sown in peace of them that make
[1:10:32] peace oh my so if you want to reap peace
[1:10:35] you've got to sow
[1:10:36] peace brother brandom says this about
[1:10:39] the apostles I know it's quiet tonight
[1:10:41] but I I'm preaching it myself too church
[1:10:44] every one of us got room to grow he said
[1:10:47] I can imagine them Apostles never acted
[1:10:49] like us he said they went around
[1:10:51] probably meant a few words I love that
[1:10:54] he put this next part in there he said
[1:10:55] till they got in the
[1:10:59] Pulpit glad he gave us an out there
[1:11:01] brother sha Stewart said they were men a
[1:11:03] few words till they got in the Pulpit
[1:11:06] brother brandom in one place he said
[1:11:07] they preached a very long time and
[1:11:09] another quote just like this he said
[1:11:10] they preached a long time but they were
[1:11:11] meant a few words outside the
[1:11:14] pulpit don't take that too much to heart
[1:11:17] he said he said they walked in and they
[1:11:20] done what they were supposed to do and
[1:11:22] walked out he said they had power they
[1:11:25] had virtue say God help us today they
[1:11:28] had no arguments with men they knew
[1:11:31] where they stood that's all they knew
[1:11:33] who they believed they kept on walking
[1:11:35] in the
[1:11:36] spirit amen oh God help us to be like
[1:11:40] that and so what's he saying he's not
[1:11:43] saying Don't Preach long he's saying
[1:11:45] he's saying preachers should be meant a
[1:11:47] few words and that they don't fuss and
[1:11:48] argue and tattle on one
[1:11:51] another right and so we shouldn't be
[1:11:54] calling random people about stuff that
[1:11:57] has nothing to do with
[1:12:00] them right have you
[1:12:04] heard be surprised how often that
[1:12:06] happens somebody call somebody they
[1:12:08] haven't talked to in 10 years just to
[1:12:10] tell a
[1:12:12] tale for no other reason and neither one
[1:12:15] of them involved in the situation what
[1:12:17] was it Joseph was was young he talked
[1:12:20] too much at the wrong times but it's
[1:12:22] worse to see an old man do that or an
[1:12:25] old
[1:12:26] woman well look his brothers needed
[1:12:28] correcting but perhaps he didn't have
[1:12:30] the wisdom yet to correct them like
[1:12:33] Jesus would now brother R says if you
[1:12:36] can't different with a man and love him
[1:12:37] the same time then shut
[1:12:42] up was that too it was rather abrupt
[1:12:45] wasn't it I thought about just putting
[1:12:47] that part of the quote up
[1:12:50] there said if you can't different with a
[1:12:52] man love him the same time then shut up
[1:12:54] if you you can't tell him like a daddy
[1:12:56] correcting his child with a willing arm
[1:12:58] to put it around his neck and hug him
[1:12:59] afterwards you better leave it
[1:13:02] alone he said you haven't you haven't
[1:13:05] went far enough yourself to know what
[1:13:07] you're talking about he said right I can
[1:13:10] differ with a man certainly still he is
[1:13:12] my brother I'll hold his hand I can't
[1:13:15] let him get by with that if I do if I
[1:13:17] didn't tell him I wouldn't be the
[1:13:19] correct brother to him he said that's
[1:13:21] correct but I can tell him and tell him
[1:13:23] I love him and prove it to him I love
[1:13:26] him so it goes back to our motive what
[1:13:29] is our motive in that is it to help or
[1:13:30] is to get somebody in trouble and Joseph
[1:13:32] had to learn The Obedience of that by
[1:13:35] the things that he
[1:13:37] suffered you say well H how would we
[1:13:40] come to this maturity to be able to be
[1:13:42] like that well first you need the
[1:13:43] ministry of Ephesians 4:11 preaching the
[1:13:47] message of the hour because the Bible
[1:13:49] says he gave some Apostles some prophets
[1:13:50] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:13:53] teachers for the perfecting that's the
[1:13:55] maturing of the Saints for the work of
[1:13:57] the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:13:59] body of Christ secondly we need the
[1:14:01] inside teacher the Holy Spirit the
[1:14:05] inside teacher John 14:26 says but the
[1:14:07] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:14:09] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:14:11] teach you all things and bring all
[1:14:14] things to your remembrance whatsoever I
[1:14:15] was said un you he said in John 16:13
[1:14:18] how be it when he the spirit of Truth
[1:14:19] has come he will guide you into all
[1:14:22] truth so when you get the Holy Spirit
[1:14:24] you don't have all truth yet he will
[1:14:27] guide you into all
[1:14:29] truth right for he shall not speak of
[1:14:31] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:14:33] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:14:35] things to come so brother brandham
[1:14:38] taught us that the evidence that we have
[1:14:39] the Holy Ghost is that inside teacher
[1:14:42] leading us to say Amen to every word of
[1:14:44] the hour right bringing us to maturity
[1:14:47] he said he told us the evidence or what
[1:14:49] would happen he said after being
[1:14:50] baptized with the Holy Ghost that we
[1:14:52] would have the teacher come and teach
[1:14:53] all truth he said but that teacher was
[1:14:56] an inside teacher not an outside teacher
[1:14:58] if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't
[1:15:00] hear the truth and receive it by
[1:15:02] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[1:15:04] of the day he said that was the sign of
[1:15:06] the indwelling spirit in the days of
[1:15:08] Paul those who were filled with the Holy
[1:15:10] Ghost heard the word received it and
[1:15:12] lived by it those who did not have the
[1:15:13] spirit heard it only as carnal men put a
[1:15:16] wrong interpretation on it and went into
[1:15:18] sin how many times have we seen that a
[1:15:21] person doesn't have the Holy Ghost but
[1:15:22] they got a good mind and so they preach
[1:15:26] they got gifts maybe to preach and they
[1:15:28] sing or whatever else but they don't
[1:15:30] have the Holy Ghost to bring them into
[1:15:32] maturity right so many times they fuss
[1:15:35] and they fight and they pick at people
[1:15:37] why because they just they haven't come
[1:15:39] to maturity themselves and then one time
[1:15:41] you find they fell fallen into sin what
[1:15:43] happened to them oh Church they didn't
[1:15:47] have the guide the inside teacher I said
[1:15:49] you need it today I need it
[1:15:52] today amen he said that was the of the
[1:15:55] indwelling spirit in the days of Paul
[1:15:56] those who were filled with the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost heard the word received it and
[1:15:59] lived by it those do not do not have the
[1:16:01] spirit heard it only as carnal men put a
[1:16:02] wrong interpretation on it and went into
[1:16:04] sin in every age and every age is the
[1:16:07] age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[1:16:09] Believer I like that every age is the
[1:16:12] age of the Holy Ghost I say in every age
[1:16:14] the evidence was the same those who had
[1:16:17] the spirit the teacher heard the word
[1:16:19] and that spirit in them took the word
[1:16:21] and taught it revealed it to them and
[1:16:23] they were of the group that heard the
[1:16:24] messenger in his message and took it and
[1:16:27] lived it I want to be one of those not
[1:16:29] just to say I'm in the message but to
[1:16:31] have that inside teacher come inside of
[1:16:33] me and actually caus me to live
[1:16:38] it well that's like you know if you had
[1:16:41] an old you ever seen an old three-legged
[1:16:43] stool we milked cows on a three-legged
[1:16:46] stool and the Third Leg of that is
[1:16:50] suffering suffering you need the
[1:16:52] ministry you need the holy
[1:16:55] spirit and you need
[1:16:57] suffering that's hard isn't
[1:17:00] it suffering is experiencing pain that's
[1:17:03] what the word means experiencing pain
[1:17:05] feeling
[1:17:09] it 1 Peter 5 and8 says be sober be
[1:17:11] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:17:13] Devil is a roaring Lon walketh about
[1:17:15] seeking whom he may devour resist
[1:17:18] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[1:17:20] same afflictions are accomplished in
[1:17:21] your brethren that are in the world but
[1:17:23] the God of all Grace who has called us
[1:17:26] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[1:17:28] after that you have suffered a while
[1:17:31] make you
[1:17:32] perfect establish strengthen settle you
[1:17:37] so like a tree that gets blown by the
[1:17:40] winds but if it doesn't blow it down
[1:17:43] someone said what doesn't kill you makes
[1:17:44] you stronger that's literally true of a
[1:17:46] tree that if it doesn't blow it down it
[1:17:48] actually loosens the dirt around the
[1:17:50] root so it can grow deeper and it keeps
[1:17:53] growing deeper and keeps growing and
[1:17:55] deeper and though the storms would come
[1:17:56] and the wind would come and listen
[1:17:58] you're a brid tree you've been called to
[1:18:00] stand every one of us have been called
[1:18:02] to stand but we can't go in on a flowery
[1:18:04] bed of East there will be some suffering
[1:18:06] in life some we'll feel some
[1:18:10] pain and it's necessary to have
[1:18:15] maturity and maturity is not an age
[1:18:18] although it comes with age but it comes
[1:18:21] by these things comes by the word it
[1:18:23] comes by the spirit it comes by
[1:18:27] suffering Joseph had to suffer before he
[1:18:29] could Reign look at Joseph and Jesus and
[1:18:32] the type there the parallel his brothers
[1:18:34] hated him Jesus Brethren hated him he
[1:18:38] was sold for money 20 pieces of silver
[1:18:41] in Joseph's case 30 pieces of silver in
[1:18:43] Jesus case buried in a
[1:18:45] ditch oh my suffered in the dungeon in
[1:18:50] fact when Joseph went to prison there
[1:18:52] was one Thief lost and one Thief saved
[1:18:56] just like Jesus on the
[1:18:57] cross and then he was seated at the
[1:19:00] right hand of pharaoh brother Brown said
[1:19:02] then he become at the right hand of
[1:19:04] pharaoh the king that he dreamed that
[1:19:06] had the vision that he would set at the
[1:19:07] king's feet and all authority in Egypt
[1:19:10] was given to him his vision had to come
[1:19:13] to pass now if it's a god-given vision a
[1:19:17] dream a a goal a a something that you've
[1:19:20] got in your mind that that that's of God
[1:19:23] and I think we can all maybe we can dumb
[1:19:25] it down a little bit because we're not
[1:19:27] all going to be Joseph but we all do
[1:19:29] have some Vision in our lives we ought
[1:19:31] to right because if you don't have a
[1:19:33] vision you don't have a purpose so you
[1:19:36] have a vision in your life and what is
[1:19:37] the vision well we may have a vision of
[1:19:39] what our life's going to be but
[1:19:40] ultimately our lives are ruled by the
[1:19:43] word right so the vision ought to be the
[1:19:47] word it ought to be what the word says
[1:19:51] what the word says about me that's my
[1:19:52] vision so if you're a young person here
[1:19:55] tonight you got a vision how can I be a
[1:19:57] Godly adult how can I be a Godly wife
[1:20:00] how can I be a Godly husband how can I
[1:20:03] be a Godly parent and as a mother you
[1:20:06] have a vision of raising your children
[1:20:08] in the fear and admonition of the world
[1:20:10] and none of them being lost right that's
[1:20:13] your vision but you might have to go
[1:20:15] through some suffering on the
[1:20:17] way right to get to the
[1:20:20] vision are you hearing me now there
[1:20:22] might be some hard times on the way
[1:20:25] Jesus had to go through the cross and
[1:20:27] the grave before he could ever be lifted
[1:20:29] up on high right he had to go through
[1:20:32] that it was necessary for him to do that
[1:20:34] and it's necessary for us many times but
[1:20:37] Caleb to go through a time of
[1:20:40] suffering right you you you take a young
[1:20:44] couple that's been through some things
[1:20:47] and they fought to stay in church and
[1:20:50] they fought because everything conspired
[1:20:53] against them and seemed like to keep out
[1:20:54] of the house of God and they had to
[1:20:56] fight to be in church some of yall know
[1:20:58] what I'm talking about and maybe maybe
[1:21:00] you had to fight financially maybe it
[1:21:02] wasn't financially maybe it was with
[1:21:03] health or or with your children or
[1:21:05] something something that had you had to
[1:21:07] just you just had to make a commitment
[1:21:09] one day say I'm going to go to church no
[1:21:11] matter what happens I I'm going to live
[1:21:13] for God no matter what happens and you
[1:21:14] take that young couple that went through
[1:21:17] some things and and maybe they struggled
[1:21:19] the first few years of married some of
[1:21:20] you are in that phase right now you know
[1:21:21] what I'm talking about when you get to
[1:21:23] the end of the month and you get to to
[1:21:24] the end of the year and you wonder where
[1:21:26] that that tax check better come along or
[1:21:28] I've been there church we're not going
[1:21:30] to have enough money to make in meet huh
[1:21:33] and you feel terrible about that but
[1:21:35] it's just where you're at and many times
[1:21:37] as a young couple when you struggle like
[1:21:38] that and you go through those things and
[1:21:41] and yet I know some of you have moved on
[1:21:42] a little bit further and you got a few
[1:21:44] years on you and maybe you're still
[1:21:46] sitting there thinking when is this ever
[1:21:47] going to
[1:21:49] end and some of you Elders know that you
[1:21:52] kind of go right back into that time
[1:21:53] when you get older and you get on a
[1:21:54] fixed
[1:21:56] income right and then you're wondering
[1:21:57] where the how the bills are going to be
[1:21:59] paid
[1:22:00] again
[1:22:02] right oh Church don't you realize it's
[1:22:05] necessary don't you realize a couple
[1:22:08] that's gone through that can handle
[1:22:10] anything that the devil tries to throw
[1:22:12] at them because they trusted him for
[1:22:15] groceries they trusted him for rent they
[1:22:17] trust the whole church they trusted him
[1:22:19] for for their kids they trusted him for
[1:22:21] their health they trusted him they went
[1:22:23] to church they did what was right they
[1:22:25] they paid God first even when they
[1:22:26] didn't seem like they had it but they
[1:22:28] did the right thing what was it it was
[1:22:30] something about my hats off to your
[1:22:32] church why you've been through some
[1:22:33] things and that's what brings maturity
[1:22:35] in your life and you've had to
[1:22:38] struggle but that struggle produce
[1:22:43] something to produce something the gold
[1:22:45] of God that you can't get any other
[1:22:48] way are you with me now
[1:22:54] brother brandom
[1:22:56] said let me move down here where I was I
[1:22:58] don't want to reread
[1:23:01] these oh my we we we need that suffering
[1:23:06] to be able to see the vision come to
[1:23:10] pass in our life brother brandom said he
[1:23:13] his vision had to come to pass he might
[1:23:14] have studied it many times while he was
[1:23:17] in that prison down there his whiskers
[1:23:20] growing out and so forth but he studied
[1:23:24] it
[1:23:25] you need to study your
[1:23:28] vision you need to look there and say
[1:23:30] God said he would supply all my
[1:23:33] needs right study the vision right I
[1:23:36] know God will provide for me I know God
[1:23:39] will help me when to go and get stuff
[1:23:40] God said he would keep me and he would
[1:23:42] save me and he would save my
[1:23:44] household you study on
[1:23:46] that he studied on that in the prison he
[1:23:49] thought about his vision he thought
[1:23:51] about his dreams he thought about what
[1:23:53] he'd seen he said said God I know that
[1:23:55] was real I know you give me something
[1:23:57] and yet I hear I'm going through a
[1:23:59] prison I'm going through a hard time I'm
[1:24:01] going through a time when it seems like
[1:24:02] everything's turned against me but I
[1:24:04] know I'm going to hold on I'm going to
[1:24:06] do the very best I can in the situation

[1:24:10] don't know which day that'll be but one
[1:24:12] day I'm going to come out of this prison

[1:24:27] come to pass habac 2:3 says for the
[1:24:29] vision is yet for an appointed time but

[1:26:12] again it won't work you end up
[1:26:16] divorced what do you got to
[1:26:19] do work in the prison
[1:26:24] work in Piper's
[1:26:27] house do such a good job that they that
[1:26:31] that you they see you and and and and
[1:26:33] you see that this isn't the situation
[1:26:35] you wanted but you're not going to lay
[1:26:37] down because you know what your future
[1:26:38] is you know what's up ahead of you you
[1:26:40] know you weren't called to be all of
[1:26:42] your life like that and so you crawl out
[1:26:44] of
[1:26:45] it I'm determined to leave this state
[1:26:47] I'm not going to remain in the moly
[1:26:49] grubs I'm not going to stay in my like
[1:26:51] job here there was a time he was on the
[1:26:53] as sheep but there had to come a time he
[1:26:55] crawled out of
[1:26:56] it determined to meet God and talk to
[1:26:59] him about it I'm determined to let him
[1:27:01] to let him come in and change my life
[1:27:04] I'm determined to receive the baptism of
[1:27:05] the Holy Ghost whatever it is that you
[1:27:07] have need of I'm determined that I'm
[1:27:09] going to crawl out of this
[1:27:12] whole see until his word came he
[1:27:16] suffered under the expectations that he
[1:27:18] had he could not promote himself to the
[1:27:22] throne he neither cannot we we promote
[1:27:25] ourselves to God's Throne he was thrown
[1:27:28] in a pit sold into slavery lighted on by
[1:27:30] an evil
[1:27:31] woman cast into prison sat there with
[1:27:33] his whiskers growing out 30 years old it
[1:27:36] don't seem old unless you spent half of
[1:27:38] it in
[1:27:41] prison it been only 17 when it All
[1:27:46] Began so for what is that my Math's not
[1:27:48] very good 13
[1:27:50] years 13 years he spent part of it in
[1:27:53] pot house he probably thought well I'm
[1:27:55] getting ahead now woohoo I got the job I
[1:27:57] wanted everything's going
[1:28:00] good and but for doing the right thing
[1:28:02] he ended up in
[1:28:05] prison he ran from Temptation he end up
[1:28:08] in prison listen if he had given in he'
[1:28:10] have been in a worst
[1:28:13] prison but he but he he ran from
[1:28:15] Temptation so he ended up in prison and
[1:28:19] and then he he's in prison spending the
[1:28:20] best years of his life his 20s in
[1:28:25] prison think about it for a minute you
[1:28:28] might have sat there and said boy I wish
[1:28:30] I'd have kept my mouth
[1:28:33] shut to my
[1:28:36] brothers wish I'd have treated them
[1:28:38] differently we don't know what all went
[1:28:40] through his mind but he didn't give
[1:28:43] up see God was teaching him something
[1:28:46] God was going to use him for Redemption
[1:28:48] so he had to learn to obey I believe
[1:28:50] some of you God's going to use you for
[1:28:52] Redemption to your family he's going to
[1:28:54] use you to break family curses he's
[1:28:56] going to use you to change the situation
[1:28:58] he's going to use you to change Hardy's
[1:29:00] reputation are you with me now he's
[1:29:02] going to use you to change an area use
[1:29:04] you to God terries I believe he's going
[1:29:06] to use this church but you got to go
[1:29:08] through the hard times to get to where
[1:29:09] you can break through there's got to be
[1:29:12] some suffering so you get to the place
[1:29:14] where you can raise up and be at the
[1:29:16] right hand of pharaoh
[1:29:18] again oh
[1:29:19] my but it was his attitude and
[1:29:22] willingness to work in the jobs he
[1:29:24] didn't want I'm just making it carnal so
[1:29:26] we can understand it but it's the jobs
[1:29:29] he didn't want was his attitude and
[1:29:31] willingness to work in those jobs that
[1:29:33] got him the job he
[1:29:36] wanted in Genesis
[1:29:38] 45:4 Joseph said to his Brethren come
[1:29:40] near to me I pray you they came near but
[1:29:44] this is all the way at the end and we're
[1:29:45] going to get to many things I don't have
[1:29:47] time tonight to go into all the things
[1:29:49] that happened but Joseph said unto his
[1:29:51] Brethren come near to me I pray you they
[1:29:54] came near he said I am Joseph your
[1:29:57] brother whom you sold into
[1:30:02] Egypt and you talk about people shaking
[1:30:04] in their
[1:30:08] boots you imagine them walking into that
[1:30:11] place think about it here these poor
[1:30:18] Shepherds they thought they got rid of
[1:30:20] that problem 13 years
[1:30:22] ago they thought they killed
[1:30:25] him and he comes walking in they come
[1:30:29] walking into
[1:30:31] Egypt and here's this great towers and
[1:30:35] palaces and Joseph everything he says
[1:30:38] the king does he's the prime minister of
[1:30:41] Egypt he's the power behind the throne
[1:30:44] he's got the king seal he can put people
[1:30:47] to
[1:30:49] death he's got that ability you don't
[1:30:52] have to ask nobody so he he's got the
[1:30:55] full Trust of pharaoh and they walk in
[1:30:58] there and they're looking around and
[1:31:00] they're in all the place and they walk
[1:31:02] in there and they they get an audience
[1:31:04] with Joseph he puts everybody out of the
[1:31:06] room brother BR said he put out his
[1:31:08] Gentile wife because it's a type of
[1:31:11] what's going to happen one day when when
[1:31:13] we come back to the Earth you remember
[1:31:16] and he goes down to the Jews and in the
[1:31:18] day of atonement he said look at these
[1:31:20] SS they said where do you get the wounds
[1:31:23] he said in the in the house of my
[1:31:27] friends but they come into that into
[1:31:29] that great room the Judgment seat and
[1:31:32] here comes a man onto the throne with
[1:31:34] his great bodyguard standing there with
[1:31:36] all their armor and here he is standing
[1:31:38] there and and such a such an amazing
[1:31:42] presence about him and they're just kind
[1:31:44] of bowed down like this said I wonder
[1:31:46] what's going to happen to us we're
[1:31:48] desperate we need something to
[1:31:50] eat we just need some help looking for
[1:31:53] pity looking for a handout Joseph runs
[1:31:56] everybody out of the room and he says
[1:31:57] don't you know who I
[1:31:59] am I'm your
[1:32:02] brother you forgive me if I'm wrong
[1:32:04] about this but I don't believe Joseph
[1:32:06] could have done that at
[1:32:11] 17 I don't think he would have had the
[1:32:13] ability to do that when he was 17 but at
[1:32:18] 30 oh my or or however much older he was
[1:32:22] by the time they come down there
[1:32:24] in his 30s suddenly had I'm not saying
[1:32:26] there's anything special about that age
[1:32:28] other than that was about the age Jesus
[1:32:30] was but it's something about growing up
[1:32:33] about growing up and so here here he's
[1:32:36] grown to a point that he says this now
[1:32:41] therefore he sees their
[1:32:43] faces I'm they're white as a
[1:32:47] sheet and they're trembling and they're
[1:32:49] saying well boys this is it our sin has
[1:32:52] finally found us out yes all these years
[1:32:56] the carefully laid lies and the Web of
[1:32:59] Lies We Told to our father is fixing
[1:33:02] it's fixing to all be found
[1:33:05] out he says therefore be not grieved nor
[1:33:09] angry with yourselves that you sold me
[1:33:12] hither for God did send me before you to
[1:33:17] preserve
[1:33:19] life he might not could have said that
[1:33:22] at 17 but when he stood there before him
[1:33:24] after Piper's house after the prison
[1:33:27] after the
[1:33:30] pit he can stand there and
[1:33:33] say I forgive
[1:33:36] you God did this to me to save your
[1:33:42] life oh Church you say but brother Ben
[1:33:45] when when when will I see that maturity
[1:33:46] in my life when you can say father
[1:33:49] forgive them and not just say it but
[1:33:53] actually be in a position where your
[1:33:55] attitude towards them can bring
[1:33:57] redemption in their
[1:33:59] homes redemption in their
[1:34:06] lives that's why James said my brethren
[1:34:08] counted all joy when you fall into
[1:34:10] diverse
[1:34:12] Temptations knowing this that the trying
[1:34:14] of your faith worketh patience but let
[1:34:17] patience have her perfect work her
[1:34:19] mature work he said give patience time
[1:34:23] is it's a great play on
[1:34:25] words patience takes
[1:34:28] patience let patience have her perfect
[1:34:31] work that you may be perfect mature and
[1:34:34] entire wanting
[1:34:36] nothing brother brand says unless we
[1:34:38] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:34:40] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[1:34:43] for this is that character simply is
[1:34:44] never made without suffering character
[1:34:47] is a victory not a gift a man without
[1:34:49] character can't Reign because power
[1:34:51] apart from character is satanic but
[1:34:53] Power with character is fit to rule and
[1:34:55] since he wants us to share even his
[1:34:58] throne by the same oh my on the same
[1:35:00] basis that he overcome and has set down
[1:35:02] his father Stone and we have to overcome
[1:35:04] to sit with him and the little temporary
[1:35:07] suffering we go through now is not
[1:35:09] worthy to be compared to the tremendous
[1:35:11] Glory that will be revealed in us when
[1:35:13] he comes all what Treasures are laid up
[1:35:16] for those who are who are willing to
[1:35:19] enter into his kingdom through much
[1:35:22] tribulation he thinking not strange
[1:35:24] concerning the fiery trials that are to
[1:35:26] try you this is what Peter said is it is
[1:35:29] it strange that God wants us to develop
[1:35:30] a Christlike character that comes
[1:35:32] through suffering no sir he said and we
[1:35:34] all have
[1:35:36] trials musicians can go ahead and make
[1:35:38] their way he said we are all tried and
[1:35:41] chastened as
[1:35:43] Sons not one but goes through that I
[1:35:48] want you to listen to this and I know
[1:35:49] you've heard it before but I want you to
[1:35:50] think about it the church that is not
[1:35:54] suffering and is not being
[1:35:57] tried hasn't got
[1:36:00] it it isn't of
[1:36:05] God so I'm goingon to go somewhere where
[1:36:07] there's no
[1:36:09] trials you go to a church that doesn't
[1:36:11] have
[1:36:12] God I'll say trials are common to every
[1:36:18] Church suffering is common to every
[1:36:20] human being but the suffering of The
[1:36:23] Sinner produces more
[1:36:26] sin right more
[1:36:29] hatred more more
[1:36:33] ungodliness some of you before you come
[1:36:35] to the Lord you had to go through some
[1:36:37] things before you finally reach the time
[1:36:40] when you can say okay I Surrender Lord
[1:36:43] I'm
[1:36:44] done I'm done
[1:36:47] fighting I'm done worrying about the
[1:36:50] things why can't I do this why can't I
[1:36:52] do that why can't I live like this I'm
[1:36:54] done Lord I'm ready to give it
[1:36:58] up and just be what you want me to
[1:37:02] be if you want me in an uncomfortable
[1:37:05] situation for now I'll take
[1:37:09] that cuz sometimes that's what it takes
[1:37:12] to get a character in our
[1:37:15] lives I know that's hard church but I
[1:37:17] don't mean to be hard I I preach it
[1:37:19] because I've lived it and I live it now
[1:37:24] if you think pastoring is a Rosie bed of
[1:37:26] ease I'd like to i' I'd like to hand it
[1:37:28] to you for a while if I
[1:37:31] could it's not easy but I'm not here to
[1:37:34] to be in the Molly grubs I'm saying the
[1:37:36] situation that I'm in God has called me
[1:37:39] to do there's a vision there's a dream
[1:37:42] there's somewhere I'm going and I'm
[1:37:44] going to I'm going to fight I'm going to
[1:37:46] plow I'm going to work until I get out
[1:37:48] of this prison what about you tonight
[1:37:51] whatever I'm in you say well my body's
[1:37:52] getting old I'm getting crippled but in
[1:37:54] that situation say Lord I know this is
[1:37:57] not the end this is not what you had for
[1:38:00] me you listen you could have the best
[1:38:02] job living in a penthouse on Fifth
[1:38:03] Avenue and have all the money in the
[1:38:05] world and you still may not be happy but
[1:38:07] you have to have a vision there got to
[1:38:09] be something this is what I want my life
[1:38:11] to be oh Church there's got to be
[1:38:14] something we're reaching for we can't
[1:38:16] just lay back and say well I'm going to
[1:38:17] be a good lay to see in person no
[1:38:19] there's got to be something inside of
[1:38:20] you Lord I want that character whatever
[1:38:23] it takes Lord I'm willing to go through
[1:38:25] it I'm willing to take it I'm willing to
[1:38:28] have you begin to work in my life I
[1:38:31] wonder if we could say that tonight with
[1:38:32] every head bowed and every eye
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:37] closed maybe You' just like to say I'd
[1:38:40] like to pray with you maybe you just
[1:38:41] like to say brother B that that spoke to
[1:38:43] me
[1:38:44] I I realize I need character in my life
[1:38:48] I need to grow I think all of us could
[1:38:49] say that I need to grow I
[1:38:54] I been through some things I'm not
[1:38:56] coveting trials I'm not doing that that
[1:38:59] would be stupid but what am I doing I'm
[1:39:02] I'm just saying Lord what you bring my
[1:39:04] way I'm willing to
[1:39:06] take I'm going to work as hard as I can
[1:39:09] in the middle of that
[1:39:10] trial to see a vision come to pass for
[1:39:14] my life it may not be what I wanted but
[1:39:17] it'll be what you had for
[1:39:18] me you just lift your hand to him and
[1:39:21] tell him Lord that's what I want that's
[1:39:22] what I want tonight church God bless
[1:39:24] those hands Heavenly Father our Jesus we
[1:39:30] we surrender tonight to your will we
[1:39:33] surrender Lord even Lord you even when
[1:39:38] you were here on the earth in a body of
[1:39:40] Flesh you had to experience pain and
[1:39:43] suffering Lord and by that you learned
[1:39:47] obedience Lord that's difficult for us
[1:39:49] to understand but we know Lord that it's
[1:39:52] true
[1:39:54] so Lord we we surrender our will to you
