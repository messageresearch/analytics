[applause] Oh, I just want [singing] to speak the name of Jesus over every heart and [singing] every kind cuz I know there is peace [singing and music] within your presence. I speak Jesus. [music and singing] I just want to [singing] speak [music] the name of Jesus. Till every [singing] dark addiction starts to break. Declaring there is hope [singing and music] and there is freedom. I speak Jesus. [music and singing] Your name is power. [singing and music] Your name is healing. [music] Your name [singing] is life. Break [singing and music] every stronghold. Shine through the [singing] shadows. Burn like a fire. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I just want to [singing] speak the name of Jesus over fear and all anxiety. [singing] To every soul held captive by [singing] depression, I speak [music] Jesus. [music] Your [singing] name is power. Your [music] name is healing. Your [singing] name is life.

Your name is life. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Break every stronghold. [singing] Shine through the shadows. Burn like [singing] a fire. I left a barren [singing] land. searching for rest. Stumbling round in amnesia, bitterness and distress. [singing] But then I met the kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty [singing] one. He took this whole Moabitete from the field and he brought me through his house [singing] and he said, "Fear not, my child for you are a part of [singing] me and I'll not rest till you are at my side. [singing] I will do all that you ask of me. Oh jewel in [singing] my eyes. Virtuous woman, you are [singing] my bride. I've responded to your call [singing] and you have covered me. [music] For with eyes of faith I [singing] see all the mysteries being revealed. And now I see who [singing] I am. And I [music] lay claim to all that's mine. I'm the [singing] lamb's wife. I've been bought with a price. [singing] And he said, "Fear not, my child, for you are a part of [singing] me, and I'll [music] not rest till you are at my side. [singing] I will do all that you ask of me. [singing] Virtue in my eyes. [music] Virtuous woman, you are my [singing] bride. [music] When I look back and see how much grace and [singing] love you've shown me, Lord, it brings me to my [singing] knees that you would even think about me. [music] You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're [singing] still the great. And with faith I'll stand [music] on your word because [singing] you're more than able. He said, "Fear not, my [singing] child for you are a part of me and [singing] I'll not rest till [music] you are at my side. I will do all that you [music] ask [singing] of me a ritual in my eyes. Virtuous [music] [singing] woman, you are my bride. And so I'm casting all my cares on you. [music] Oh, I know that you love me. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Redemption [singing] by blood. [music] That's the [singing] greatest love story. [music] Full [singing] restoration, full redemption. That's what seven [singing] angels in a clown testified my [singing] redeemer [music] no longer dead. He's alive and [music] he's coming [singing] back for me. And so I'm casting all my cares on you. Oh, I know that [music] you love me. [music] Redemption by blood. That's the greatest [singing] love [music] story. Full restoration, full redemption. That's what seven angels in [singing] a cloud testified. My redeemer's no longer dead. He's [singing] alive and he's coming [music] back for you and me. [applause] Amen. Aren't you thankful? Amen. We speak Jesus and our redeemer's alive. Brother Allan, we had a request for you to sing a a song. I think I sent it to you. Uh, didn't I walk on the water? I wonder as brother Allan sings this, we'll just go ahead and and let brother Allan sing this and then right after he's done, we'll invite the pastor. [music] Amen. Aren't you thankful for what we know this morning? Amen. We can speak Jesus, but aren't you thankful the full restoration, Amen, was by the we're the redeemed this morning. We have a reason to sing and shout and praise the Lord. Aren't you thankful for it? Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. Give the Lord another hand clap of praise if you would. As I kneel in the [singing] darkness, in [music] the middle of the night, I'm praying for assurance [singing] everything's [music] going to be all right. Lord, I see another battle. [singing] It's out in front of me. I'm afraid I [singing and music] won't be able and I'll go down in defeat. He [music] said, [singing] "I walked on the water. I calmed the raging sea. I spoke to [music] the wind. It [singing] hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue? And [music and singing] didn't I hear you when you called? I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall. [singing and music] Didn't I leave all of heaven to die for your sin? I searched [music] until I found you. And I do it all [singing] again. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And now she's talking to her father in a house that was [music] once a [singing] home. Said, "My bills are coming due, Lord. 6 days is not that long." [singing and music] She hears a voice so still and low. Said, "I've moved like that before. I'll do [music] this little thing. Oh, and I'll [singing] give you so much more. He said, I walked on the water. I calmed [music and singing] the rag and sea. I spoke to the wind. It hushed and [music] I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue [music and singing] and didn't I hear you when you called? I walked right beside [singing] you [music] just so you wouldn't fall. Did I leave all of [singing] heaven to die for your sin? I searched until I found you and I do it all again. [singing and music] And he said, "Do you remember just [music] where I [singing] brought you from? Just take a look behind you at how far you've [singing] come." And every time you ask [music] me, "Didn't I deliver [singing] you?" So why would you be [music] thinking I [singing] wouldn't see you through? Sing it with me. He [music] said, "I walked on [singing] the water. I calmed the raging sea. I spoke [music] to the wind. It hushed and I gave you peace. Didn't I run to your rescue and didn't I hear [music and singing] you when you called? I walked right beside you [music] just so you [singing] wouldn't fall. Did I leave all of [music] heaven to die for your sin? I searched [music] until I found you. Let's [singing] stand and sing it together once again. He said, "I walked on the water. [music] I calmed [singing] the raging sea. I spoke to the wind [music] in a hush and I gave the peace so you wouldn't fall. [music] Oh, did I leave all the heaven just [singing and music] to die for your sin? Well, I searched until I found you, and I do it all again. [singing] Somebody give the Lord a hand clap of praise this morning. [applause] [music] Aren't you thankful that he did it? I wonder if we can sing that chorus one more time as we invite our pastor. But I want you to think about what he's done for you. You know, if you think about what he's done for you, it'll make you worship different. If you think about what he's done for you, you'll be thankful. Lord, thank you for bringing me from where I came from. You know, we've got a right to be happy this morning in the house of God. Why? Because it ain't what we done, but it's what he did for us. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Let's sing it now. Oh, didn't I walk on the [singing] water? I called the raging sea. You know, he did it for you. I spoke to the [singing] wind. Don't you know, and hushed and I gave you peace. And didn't I run [singing] to [music] your rescue? Oh, yes you did. I walked right beside you so you wouldn't [singing] fall. [music] Oh, didn't I leave all of heaven just to die for your sin? [singing] I searched until I found you. And I do it all. Oh, I spoke to the wind. Oh, it hushed and [singing and music] I gave you peace. Didn't I run? Has he run to your rescue today? [music and singing] Didn't I hear you when you called? Oh, I walked [music and singing] right beside you so you wouldn't fall. Did [music] I leave all of heaven just to die for your sins? Oh, I searched until I found [singing] you. I do [music] it all again. Let's give him a hand of praise. Oh, don't you love him this morning? Amen. I'm glad he searched till he found you. Amen. Amen. Just a couple of things while you're standing and then we'll go right into the into the message this morning. Enjoy the song [music] service so far. We just really enjoyed the worship. Um we uh they still finishing up the counting, but it was very nearly unanimous on all the officers. I want to say how much I appreciate your unity on the church and we've added uh brother Bobby Rapert and uh brother uh Jeremy Erskin as trustees and I believe they'll serve honorably and with the other brothers that that are already serving and then reelected our current officers as well. I appreciate you again as a church. You just always it always amazes me. We only do this every couple of years. Uh but it always amazes me how much unity there is in the church and how much you love one another and I appreciate that and pray that that would always continue. Brother Bill Whiteamp has uh is retiring as a trustee. Of course, we'll leave the door open, brother Bill, if you ever want to come back and do that again. But get a second wind. But we appreciate Brother Bill, don't we? So much. And for 20 years, go ahead. That's all right. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; 20 years as a trustee here in the church and I I just really do appreciate brother Bill and his faithfulness in that. I got something for you, Brother Bill, but I'll have to wait. It didn't come in in time. It got delayed due to the holidays, but uh I got something for you, but we'll give that to you maybe next week. We sure love each and every one of you. Good to see you all, Sister Betty. It's so good to see you in church this morning. And I I just did my heart good when somebody texted me and told me you were you were here. That's it. It's just pray the Lord would continue to help you and to heal you and and uh Brother Robbie, good to see you as well. And each one that's here, the parties, I think they're here this morning. God bless you guys. Good to see you. It's been forever because when you all were here, I was gone. So we sure appreciate you. Keep praying for brother Bill and sister Karen. Brother Bill's still not able to be on his feet, but he wants to be real bad. We went to see him Friday and keep them in your prayers. Amen. Let's just bow our heads together and have a word of prayer as we go uh to the word. And maybe there's some need that you have in your life that you'd like to just lift to the Lord. I know he sees every hand, knows every heart. And uh we we just want to pray for these that have been elected. Pray the Lord would use them in their office and bless them. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for this little church here, Lord, in Hardy, Arkansas. Thank you for these people that love you with all of their heart. I pray God that you would just move in a mighty way among us. Lord, as the church always has to be set in order before a great move of the Holy Spirit. Lord, I pray that that move would be this morning. Revive us, oh God. Set us, Lord, on the path. Lord, that we would know that we're close to you in a world that's gone lukewarm. And Lord says they're rich and don't have a need of nothing. But Lord, we know, we recognize our need. Lord, many hands were raised this morning, people with needs. I pray that you'd meet those needs this morning. Pray you continue to bless Sister Betty and help her and her body and brother Bill and each one. Lord, I pray especially for the family of Sister Clelet this morning. Lord, that you'd bless them. Lord, as we lay her to rest tomorrow, may there be comfort in knowing where she is. I pray you'd grant it today, Lord. We thank you for these officers that have been elected. I pray that you'd help them. Give them a a spirit to serve you, Lord, and Lord, an energy to do what they need to do. I pray you'd bless them abundantly for their service and we'll thank you, give you the praise and the glory and the honor in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to First Thessalonians chapter 2. 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17. You ready for the word this morning? Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 17 says, "But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I, Paul, once and again, but Satan hindered us." So he's saying, "We want to come and visit." He said, 'For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy. Amen. Oh, if you're a glory and a joy and a crown to a to a minister or to a a messenger to the age, how much more to Christ? &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that this morning? God bless you. I want to speak on a crown of rejoicing. You may be seated this morning. Brother Brandham called the people that he preached to the stars in his crown. &gt;&gt; I I read you one of the quotes where he says that I believe last week. He also called it the jewel in the crown of his ministry. The jewel in the crown of his ministry. Malachi 3:17 speaks of that. It says, "They shall be mine, sayeth the Lord of hosts." in that day when I make up my jewels and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. So he said there's going to be a gathering of these jewels. You are God's jewels. You are a jewel in the crown of of the ministry. You are a crown of rejoicing for the ministry. I I don't understand preachers that want to beat the sheep. I I don't understand that at all because the people are the uh the effect of what you're preaching. They're the manifestation of what you're preaching. And I always take that personally. If the people aren't what they should be, then maybe I need to do better. Maybe I need to preach harder. And maybe I need to pray more. Maybe I need to do that. Because I believe this message produces jewels in the crown of his ministry. Don't don't ever let Satan get on you and begin to tell you you're not worthy or you're not good enough or you're not the typical message person or you're not this that or the other. Don't do that. You you're the jewels in his crown. The the message has made you what you are. You're you're the walking scripture today. You are what God wanted you to be and what he designed you to be. And you just believe that and serve God with all of your heart. &gt;&gt; We know that God's jewels are gathered by the preaching of the gospel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In 1 Corinthians chapter 1 18 it says, "For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but unto us which are saved." How many are saved this morning? Aren't you glad to be saved? He said, "Unto us which are saved, it is the power of God." Unto us which are saved, it is the power of God. For after that, verse 21, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God. It pleased God by what? by the foolishness of preaching. I know it seems foolish to people, but by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. It's God's method of gathering his jewels, of getting the word out, of spreading the word so that that light could cross the sea. Brother taught that preaching the gospel was more than spreading tracks. Did you know that? He said it's more than just giving and and if all you can do is give a track, that's good. But that's not preaching the gospel. Preaching the gospel is a demonstration of the power of the gospel. It's more than just getting up and saying words. It's more than just being able to read a quote, but it's actually a demonstrating of the power of God. We believe not only that we we DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT A Jesus that was or a Jesus that used to be able to heal OR OR A GOD THAT USED TO HAVE POWER. WE WE DEMONSTRATE that power today. WE BELIEVE THAT GOD IS STILL a healer. We believe he's still a savior. HE'S STILL THE ALMIGHTY GOD. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT this morning? WE DIDN'T COME HERE WITH LOW EXPECTATIONS. WE DIDN'T COME HERE UH THINKING, WELL, WE we're going to serve a historical God today or we're just going to go through the motions AS A CHURCH. WE CAME HERE WITH A DESIRE IN OUR HEART TO SEE GOD MANIFESTED AMONG US. MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER SERVICE, MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER TIME THAT WE'VE GATHERED TOGETHER. BUT LET THIS BE A MOMENT WHEN DEMONS ARE BROKEN OFF OF PEOPLE'S LIVES AND CHAINS FALL OFF AND PEOPLE are renewed AND RESTORED AND THE WORD IS MADE CLEAR to people. &gt;&gt; Are you WITH ME NOW? MORE THAN JUST SPREADING a tract or giving out a book, though that's good, but it's demonstrating the power of the gospel. &gt;&gt; See, a convert to Christ is our crown of rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Of rejoicing. IN FACT, THE Bible says that when a soul is saved, the angels rejoice &gt;&gt; rejoicing in heaven when a soul is saved. A and when we win someone to Christ, we know our name is eternally associated with that soul. So, what we do is so so important and a and how we ought to think about that. And I'm going somewhere with this. We're going to move this away from preachers here in a moment, but I think we need to we need to uh ruminate this morning on how uh how important the job is of speaking the gospel. Not because that makes us important. It makes us responsible, &gt;&gt; right? We're responsible for saying the right thing. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T MIX THE word with creed. We want to make sure we preach the message and say what he said and preach it in purity. We want to make sure that WE DO IT BECAUSE THAT'S GOD'S METHOD of gathering his jewels. We don't want to tarnish that in any way. &gt;&gt; BUT BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US THAT WHEN when we we win someone to Christ, our name is eternally associated with that soul. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKED ABOUT GOING BACK TO AFRICA. And they told him, they said, "Why would you go back?" They said, "They might get you out there and run a spear through you or something." Brother Brandham, when he when he went the first time, he got deathly sick. He nearly died. And yet he wanted to go back. It was always in his heart to go back to go back to Africa. And today, Africa, there's probably more message believers in Africa than anywhere around the world. Millions of people that at least claim to believe the message of the hour in Africa. And and it was a place Brother Random really had a heart for. And he responded. He said, "Oh, they wouldn't do that." But he said, "If I could get one of those little children in my lap, put my arm around him and tell him in his native language, Jesus loves you, honey. &gt;&gt; He died for you." &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, that's not much. It might win a soul." &gt;&gt; YOU REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT YOU DO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO CROSS OVER TO Africa to do that. You mas when your babies are little, when you gather them in your LAP AND YOU TELL THEM, YOU KNOW, "HONEY, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you. YOU MAY HAVE HAD A BAD DAY, BUT JESUS LOVES YOU. YOU MIGHT BE HURT AND CRY, BUT JESUS LOVES YOU. WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? YOU'RE CREATING SOMETHING IN THE LIFE OF THAT CHILD THAT THEY WANT TO LOVE HIM BACK. &gt;&gt; You're expressing the love of Jesus. And that's what he said, I want to do to these to these children. HE SAID IF THAT LITTLE BOY WOULD ACCEPT JESUS AS HIS SAVIOR, HE SAID OUT THERE YONDER IN ETERNITY WHEN THAT STAR SHINING OUT YONDER. HE SAID MY NAME WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CONVERT as long as there was a HEAVEN ABOVE. I TELL YOU what that was. It would be his crown OF REJOICING. OH, I TELL YOU, I WANT A CROWN of rejoicing ON THAT DAY. I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE A CHURCH MEMBER. I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE SOMEBODY WHO COMES AND GOES THROUGH THE MOTION, BUT LET ME BE A SOUL WINNER. LET ME BE SOMEBODY WHO WHO MANIFESTS THE WORD OF GOD TO MY GENERATION. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I thought of that. Brother Brandon was so tender in that and I didn't put the quote up there because just the way that he told it was so tender and I just thought Lord help me. I remember going and doing and all of that and and I and and and all the things that's happened over the years and I I excuse me for being personal for a moment, but it means a lot to you when somebody's saved &gt;&gt; and somebody comes in and yesterday I run across a run across a video and and it was brother Trip's baptism and I sent that to him and I I didn't do a very good job. I splashed water all over the place, you know, but he got him buried. And uh I got to looking at that and I I just rejoice in my spirit. I thought, well, that's what I'm that's my what I'm preaching on is a crown of rejoicing. There's there's a crown there of rejoicing that but it wasn't just me. It was his family. It was the people who manifested Christ to him as a young child and and the people who preached to him over the years. You don't understand. All of those THINGS ADD UP AND ONE day a decision is MADE FOR CHRIST AND THERE'S PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES will be ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SOUL FOR ETERNITY. THE WAY YOU TREAT PEOPLE MATTERS. THE WAY YOU LOVE PEOPLE MATTERS. YEAH. SHOWING UP AT CHURCH MATTERS. DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS, IT MATTERS. Brother Brandon said, "The only lasting value I'd rather have one soul in glory that I won to Christ to know and see THAT LIGHT OF GOD CIRCLES around that soul THROUGH ALL ETERNITY, MY NAME to be associated with that, then to have EVERY PENNY OF MONEY IN the whole earth because I'd have TO LOSE IT ALL. BUT WHAT YOU SEND UP THERE IS ETERNAL." RIGHT. &gt;&gt; I know sometimes we spend a lot of money and this year we've done gotten a lot done and we put a fence up for the kids and made a place for them out there and we're building a place for them to have activities and things. Hey, why do you do that? It's not about the activities. It's not about that. It's about winning a soul. &gt;&gt; It's about winning a soul. AND BROTHER SAID, "I'D RATHER HAVE MY NAME associated with that THAN EVERY PENNY. I WOULD THAT WE'D GO THROUGH EVERY PENNY THAT WE HAD IF IT MEANT THAT WE WERE TRYING TO REACH A SOUL SOMEWHERE. &gt;&gt; If these kids, maybe we just give them a place. YOU SAY, "WELL, WHY DO YOU TRY TO KEEP THEM in church?" Well, we try to keep them in an atmosphere they can be born again &gt;&gt; because we we believe in a in the atmosphere and and the results that it creates. So, we try to do things that would keep the CHILDREN AROUND BECAUSE ONE DAY THEY'LL HAVE A DECISION TO make and they'll be able TO GO OUT. BUT I JUST LOVE IT WHEN I SEE THEM MAKE A DECISION for Christ and say, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD. I'M NOT GOING TO PLAY THE GAME. I'M going to stay in church. I'M GOING TO MY TESTIMONY IS GOING TO BE THAT GOD'S NOT ONLY ABLE TO SAVE A SINNER. BUT HE'S ABLE TO KEEP SOMEBODY. HE'S ABLE to keep them from those things. &gt;&gt; That's what we want for our children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "If I had every penny of money in the whole earth, I'd have to lose it all. But what you send up there is eternal." Are you with me so far this morning? Matthew 6:19 says, "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, where thieves break through and steal. Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. &gt;&gt; Where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there were there will your heart be also." We're going to talk more about treasures in just a moment. But you might ask me, brother Ben, how does the average person Now, we're going to we're going to turn this to the entire body because we know that again, those who are saved under a ministry, that's a crown of rejoicing for that ministry. And I believe all of us are under the message of the hour. And and so we're a crown stars in the crown of the messenger of the hour in that way. But yet the the average person, you know, is not a preacher, right? Maybe in some churches, but most of us are not preachers. We've got two or three here today. Maybe all these young men are called. I don't know. And maybe that'll manifest in their lives, but most people are not. Most people don't have a call. But how does the average person, the the lay member if you will, the the person who is not called, may maybe not even an officer in the church, maybe maybe not even a singer, maybe somebody who just comes to church, as if that's a small thing, right, in this day and age, but somebody who just comes and lives the life and does the best that they can do and lives a simple life and tries to serve the Lord and maybe they work and and maybe even somebody that can't come all the time or is unable to and maybe they're frustrated with themselves. Maybe you're frustrated with yourself this morning and wish I did a better job. &gt;&gt; Am I speaking to anybody this morning? &gt;&gt; And that average person is struggling and say, "Well, if I could just be like the preacher, if I could just reach and and help people and go overseas and travel around and and preach and be an evangelist or be a preacher, man, my life would be better." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Of course, you don't know the the other side of that. You don't know the frustrations of that and and the pressure that comes with that. &gt;&gt; And yet, it's an honor to serve. But but how do you win a crown &gt;&gt; of rejoicing? See, I believe you can. &gt;&gt; In fact, I believe many of you will. &gt;&gt; But how do you do that? So, you're not called to the ministry of Ephesians 4:11, but you're called to do something in the body of Christ. Right? &gt;&gt; See, the first way that you obtain a crown of rejoicing is just by being a part of a local church. So, you being a part of a local church body identifies you with everything that that church is, &gt;&gt; right? And so, you might be the the least active member of that church. You might be elderly. You might be UNABLE TO DO WHAT all you used to do. I know Sister Fritz has expressed to me. I know I talk about Sister Fritz all the time, but she's expressed to me before that how feeble she felt and unable to do things. She she had always done things in the church. And I know many of you feel that way. You feel like, well, I just can't do what I feel like I should do. And and it frustrates you. But just being a part makes a difference, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because everything done by the body and in the body is done by you. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? So every soul that's one by the church is one by the individual in the church because we are not separate. We're one body. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So in the first place you say, well if that's true, how do I become a member of the church? Now we don't have a membership. Right? We don't have a place where you sign your name because that don't mean much. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right? You could sign your name to the membership role and never show up. You could sign your name to the membership role and never even be a Christian. So that's not what it is. The first place you got to be born again. That places you in the body. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But we're not a judge of who is born again and who is not. We want everybody to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; Right. But the first thing is just you and yourself. You've got to know that you're born again. And I believe that many, if not most of us sitting here today are. And if you're not, here's a place where you can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to give an opportunity. I think as a message people, we've gotten away from that too much. We need opportunities in every service for somebody to come to Christ or to return to Christ or or OR TO BREAK OFF THE coldness and things like that. We need to create those opportunities. &gt;&gt; But but how do you become a part of the local church? Well, brother Brandham taught us it was your tithe, offering, and attendance. &gt;&gt; So that's why that's how you what how you tell who is a voter and who's not. Again, we don't keep a role. We don't put anybody out. But but that's how you know it's tithes, offering, and attendance. Brother Brandham defines a person who comes here regular and supports it with your tithe and offerings as a member of the church. It's an active participation in the local church. We say, "Brother Ben, what does that have to do with a crown of rejoicing?" Again, whatever the body does, so think of the local church as a body. We're not separate. We're one. &gt;&gt; All of us &gt;&gt; are one. You said, "Well, brother so and so, he's more feeble." We're one, &gt;&gt; sister so and so, they don't they're not able to come as much as as somebody else. We're one, &gt;&gt; right? Even if a person would be backslid. It's just a part of the body. Look, when a part of your body backslides, you try everything you can to get it working again before you cut it off. &gt;&gt; Right? If your leg backslid on you, you don't just cut it off. So, just get rid of it. It's not working no more. You try to fix it. &gt;&gt; You put it in a splint. You give it extra care. And Paul teaches that. He said we give extra care to those parts of the body that need care. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So, so we don't just cut it off. We don't do away with it. So, the part the body is a unit. It's one one unit. And so, whatever the church does, good or bad, is part of what and who you are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So, we're not separate from the body. And that's why we we should be accountable to the body. And we should also hold the body accountable. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. We do that by our vote, by our participation, by uh by our prayer and try to do that. Now, in 1 Corinthians 12:25, Paul teaches us that we're not separate from the body. He said that there should be no schism in the body. Other words, no separation, but that the members should have the same care one for another. &gt;&gt; Not just for our family members. Come on, church. There's a certain care you have for your family. You're responsible for things. You're not responsible for other families too. I understand that. But we should have the same care, &gt;&gt; right, for one another. Verse 26. And whether one member suffer, all someone say it with me, all the members suffer with it. &gt;&gt; When one member is unable to come to the house of God, we all suffer that loss. &gt;&gt; When one or he said, he turns it around or one member be honored. How many? &gt;&gt; All the members rejoice with it. &gt;&gt; So when a brother gets a promotion, whether it's in the church or whether it's somewhere else, whether it's on the job or something, uh maybe a brother, we don't envy. WE DON'T LOOK AT THAT and say, "Well, that brother got it and I didn't or that brother got promoted. That brother got this or that and I didn't." No. We're a part of the body of Christ. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO? SAY, "LORD, I'm so thankful that my brother's doing good. I MAY NOT HAVE A PENNY TO MY NAME, BUT I'M SO THANKFUL, MY BROTHER, THAT YOU BLESSED my brother." That's the kind of attitude that we ought to have. &gt;&gt; See, if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and that's the way the body works. See, brother Brandon said there were gifts in the body. And we don't have time to get into gifts this morning, but he talked about gifts of healing and how he talked about a man by the name of Brother Christ at the tabernacle that had been uh had had gotten in an accident. And he said there was a brother from the church. He said, "Not a preacher or anybody else." He said, "Just a brother." He said he had on his heart to go pray for brother Grace. He said he showed up at the hospital room. He said, "I'm not brother Brandham." He said, "I'm not one of the trustees of the deacons, but I just had on MY HEART TO GO pray for." We've seen that work before, haven't we, brother Brandon, sister Charity. You've seen God put it on a heart of somebody. Go pray for somebody. Makes a difference, church. &gt;&gt; Obey the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But he put it on the heart of this brother to go pray for brother Grace. And and the brother Winnie said, "I'm not worthy to pray for you." He said, "Brother Grace was a preacher." HE SAID, "I'M NOT WORTHY TO PRAY FOR YOU." HE SAID, "BUT I JUST FELT TO DO IT." HE SAID, "WHEN HE PRAYED FOR HIM, he was healed." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "It was a gift OF HEALING IN THE BODY." &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; GIFTS OF HEALING ARE NOT JUST HERE ON THE PLATFORM. GIFTS OF HEALING ARE IN THE BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. They shall lay hands on the sick. WHO IS HE TALKING ABOUT? THE BELIEVERS. &gt;&gt; The believers. Are you a believer today? They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Hallelujah. A gift of healing in the body of Christ. AND LAY MEMBERS ARE JUST AS MUCH A PART of the body as anyone else. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. &gt;&gt; In Christ, you understand that we have a because we believe in a biblical uh method of of leadership. So, we put men in leadership unlike many churches. &gt;&gt; We believe that's biblical. &gt;&gt; But the but the ladies have just as much a part of the body as the men do. &gt;&gt; Right. Right? &gt;&gt; Because he Paul tells us very clearly in Christ we're all the same. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You can pray for somebody. &gt;&gt; You you can help somebody. A woman is not to take authority domination over a man. But a woman does have a right to talk to her children &gt;&gt; to pray for them to teach the younger women. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; A woman, some of you elders have a great role in that in the way that you act and the way that you DRESS TO HELP SOMEBODY ELSE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO UNDERSTAND. NOT EVERYBODY, but the way that YOU CONDUCT YOURSELF IS A LESSON to the next generation. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for that. Your faithfulness, SOME OF YOU ELDERS, YOUR FAITHFULNESS is a lesson to the next generation. Is teaching them something. And so, what do we do? We we want the whole body to be we want the whole body to be helped. And so, we participate in the local body. How do we participate? By tithing. I have never preached on tithing here at the church because I've never had to. Y'all are maybe the best tithe payers on the planet. I think we sure appreciate it. I we've never had I've never had to ask for money for anything. And all look at all that we've done here in the church in the last uh five or six years. Even in the last 20 years or 25 years since the church was built, you guys have maintained it. Even when the church was small, you guys kept up your support and I I appreciate that so much. I'm thankful for that. It matters. Why? You you you care about the church, not because it's of the building. Listen, we're not attached to this building. What do we We want to win a soul to Christ. We want to have a crown of rejoicing. So, there's a the tithing is makes you a part of that. What are what are tithes? I want to talk about it for just a minute and then we'll let it go. But and again, not because we have an issue with it because we you guys do wonderfully and I appreciate that, but our younger ones need to hear it. They need to understand what it is. And tithes are 10% of your increase, right? That that's what tithing is. The word tithe means tenth. Deuteronomy 14:22, thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed. That the field bringeth forth year by year. If you were a businessman, that would be profit. Tithe would be 10% of the profit. If you were a wage earner, it' be 10% of your take-home pay, if you could say it like that. 10%. You say, "Well, that's a lot." Well, it's less than Uncle Sam takes. You know, &gt;&gt; wish they'd stick with 10%. I &gt;&gt; said, "Well, who should pay tithe?" Well, whoever has an increase, &gt;&gt; right? I didn't bring it out with me, but I got a little tithe envelope in my office that Finley gave me, and I kept it. I don't think I ever opened it. There may be $1,000 in there. I'm not sure, but uh I kept that Finley. And I I have that uh on my desk because he wrote it and he it had income and and he said it said daily or or weekly or monthly. And he said, "I'm not sure. It just depends on depends on how much dad gives him. I guess up that boy's allowance, he's paying tithe. I mean, but you know, it it matters. You teach your little ones to do that and be faithful in that. It matters. &gt;&gt; Even my children, they're my children. And we as as a pastor, that's what we live off of is tithing. And yet they pay tithes into the church. And I'm so thankful for that. We try to teach them to do that. And I watch some of you young men and and grow up in the church and sometimes I kind of wonder and be like, I wonder what you know where they're at spiritually and things and I watch your tithe checks come in and young men that wouldn't that you know and there's no requirement. We don't make people pay tithe. I'll pray for you just as much if you don't as if you do. &gt;&gt; I don't even pay attention to it. &gt;&gt; We do things for taxes at the end of the year, but other than that, we don't pay attention to it. And I I don't I don't let that affect my view of the people. I really don't. I tried my best not to do that. And and but we've got we we got young men that they wouldn't have to. Maybe they could let it slide or something. They don't have a lot of money, but they pay their tithing. I've watched that. I'm thankful for that. It it matter it means you're taking the things of God seriously. &gt;&gt; Right. So ministers also pay tithe. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? Nehemiah chapter 10 verse 38, the priest, the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites when the Levites take tithe and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes. So, it's not just the people that pay tithe, but the Levites pay a tithe on the tithe to the house of our God, to the chambers, and to the treasure house. Paul mentions this in the New Testament. Hebrews 7:9, he said, "As I may so so say, Levi also who receiveth tithe paid tithe in Abraham." That's a wonderful Listen, church, when you you say, "Well, I've been faithful in my tithes, but I don't understand how that would be a blessing." God credited it to Levi's greatgrandchildren. Hallelujah. It matters, church. 1 Corinthians uh 9:13 tells us where tithes go. He said, "Do you not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple?" He said, "They which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar." So, in other words, those who minister have a right to the the tithing that comes in. He said, "Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live the gospel." Brother Brandon tells us over and over again, he said that if people would pay their tithes, we wouldn't have to have soup suppers to pay the preachers. Do you realize how much pre how much less pressure is on us because of the principle of tithing? I don't have to raise money. You realize most denominational pastors, their main job is to raise money. &gt;&gt; That's job number one. Before preaching, before counseling, before anything else, raise money. We don't have to do that. Why? We have a message. &gt;&gt; We've been taught. We've been taken back to the scripture. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So then the minister is responsible for what he does with that money. When I paid ti all my life and when I pay my tithe, I'm giving that to the Lord. Not to a particular man. I'm giving that to the Lord. But I'm paying that where I get fed at my local church. I give it to them and it's up to them to be responsible to God. But I've done my part. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham's asked a question about that. Should a person pay ties to an individual or should a Christian work? That's kind of a loaded question. He said, "Of course." He said, he said, "A Christian will work." He said, "He's the one man that will work &gt;&gt; is a Christian." [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And uh he said, "Pay tithe to an individual." Depends on who the individual is. He uses the example of Melzdc. And then we'll pick it up here. He said, "Really, where you owe tiths is where you get your food. Bring you all your tiths into my storehouse, sayeth the Lord, and prove me wherein, sayith God, if I'll not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that you would not have room in it to receive it." He said, 'I challenge any man or woman that's not a tithe payer to accept that. Y'all better pay attention. This may be the only time I ever preach on tithe, but we'll get off of it in a minute. But the Brandon talked about himself how he paid tithe. He said, "I'd give a tenth, then I'd give it out to ministers, give the rest of it to ministers." He said, "Then when I couldn't do that," he said, "Then the thing I did, I kept 10% and give God 90." He said, "Then when the law told me I couldn't do that," he said, "if I did was all to be charged to it." He said, ' Then I had to take and bypass it into foreign missions and so forth. Take a wage out of that of $100 a week and I pay my tithe from that. And that's the way our church is set up on that model that the tithes go into one account, the offerings go into another. And I take of that tithing, I take enough to live on and the rest goes to ministry. It goes to bring in preachers. It goes at times we've helped remodel the church. That's an offering that we give from the tithing account. We've been able to do that. And I'm so thankful that you guys are faithful because it lets us do what we do. Thank you for that. &gt;&gt; So, well, we get that from brother Brandham and from the scripture. He took it from the scripture. He said, "Yes, sir. I believe in paying ti. It's one of God's blessings. It's proven to be a blessing." You say, "That's of the Old Testament. It's of the New Testament, too." I've seen that doctrine get started recently around the message that that's an Old Testament doctrine, but the Brandom said it wasn't. Malachi 3:10 says, "Bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith, sayeth the Lord of hosts. If I will not open you the windows of heaven, pour you out a blessing, there should not be room enough to receive it." &gt;&gt; Tithing is a blessing. But I want to say this to our young people. Tithe paying is a habit. And not paying tithe is a habit. &gt;&gt; The easiest way is just put back your tithe and give that to God first &gt;&gt; and the next time you're at church. that that's just the easiest way to do it. It's it's easy to spend money if you you know if you got it. And it's much easier. I'll say this, some people don't pay tithe because they don't know where their money's going. And and maybe it's indication of a of a bigger problem even in their own life that I think we have a responsibility to God to manage our money correctly. &gt;&gt; All of us do. &gt;&gt; We're not saved by tithing. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Person could tithe and be a devil. That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not saved by tithing, but a person who's faithful in the little things receives promotion from the Lord. We're taught that from the scripture. So, Brother Brandon gets this. He said, "I'd like to give you a personal testimony how I was even hungry and my mother and them hungry and my daddy's sick, but I took my ties out first and give it to God. You ought to see what happened. I've never seen in my life, what a testimony this is. I've never seen in my life that any man or woman that if you only make $1 a week will bring the 10 cents of that money, put it in your storehouse or a church where you come. If God don't bless that, call me a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; I've watched some of you, I know some of you don't have very much. And I know at the end of the week, it's tough. And I've watched some of you faithfully pay tithe. And I pray, Lord, bless them abundantly. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Abundantly. Because for some, it's just 10% is not that much cuz but some need that 10% to live on. They really need it. &gt;&gt; But they give it to God anyway. And I believe there's a blessing for that. Like that woman that come and gave her two pen seeds, but Jesus said she gave all that she had. Others gave her their abundance. There's nothing wrong with that. But she gave all that she had. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, an offering is different from tithe. So, we're done with tithe. Everybody exhale. An offering is different from tithe. Offerings go to the church to pay the bills. Don't go it don't go to the ministry. Right? So, what you pay if you just put a dollar in the offering plate, that don't come to me. That don't come to any of the ministry. That comes to that goes to the church. So the church, [snorts] we have never had to beg for money and offerings. Again, I'm thankful for that because I know preachers personally in the message who have to give thousands of dollars a month to the church just to keep the lights on. We've never had to do that because y'all are faithful. There's a crown of rejoicing in that, &gt;&gt; right? That's how you win souls is be faithful to the little things. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Brother Brand saw a construction project. I won't spend much time on this, but brother Brandina construction project. They were building a new church across the road. He said, "That shows you're backing up the right thing." And God's servant is trying his best to give the best he can to God's people. Every congregation will appreciate a pastor like that. That you see what your finances, your tithes, your offerings, and so forth. He's going straight into the kingdom of God to embed the kingdom of God. Make a better place, not for himself. I don't believe a preacher, a pastor ought to live above the people. I don't believe I ought to be a multi-millionaire and a bunch of people struggling. I don't believe it's right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? That's just me personally. But I do believe that we're going to put everything we can back into the into the house of God. &gt;&gt; He said, "Not for himself, for you." He's got the sheep on his mind. The shepherd always has. &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. WHETHER I'M HERE OR NOT, AND I'M HERE most of the time, but if I'm not here, you're still on my mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every moment, every morning, I wake up and I'm thinking about somebody. What What about brother so and so? And maybe I don't always reach out or something and I'm reluctant to do that sometimes because people don't want you to meddle. But I'm praying for you. I want you to understand that church. We're praying for you. And we have ministry here in the church that cares for you and it's praying for you. I got deacons here in the church that cares for you and praying for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't think nobody sees you, nobody knows what's going on. I know sometimes people slip out of church. I've had people GO OUT, THEY QUIT ANSWERING THEIR PHONE. They they they won't let you contact them and there's no way to let them know. BUT IF THEY ONLY knew how much people cared for them, &gt;&gt; maybe they wouldn't slip out like that and and just leave and maybe thinking maybe the devil put it in their mind, nobody cares. But I believe not only the ministry cares, but God put that care in them. And I believe God cares this morning. HE CARES ABOUT EVERYTHING GOING on in your life. HE CARES ABOUT EVERY LITTLE MOMENT of your life. &gt;&gt; So a an offering is a free will thing. Just however much. If you have a dollar a week, that's that's an offering, right? whatever you have just an offering that's on top that that would be extra something extra that you just have and so the 2 Corinthians 9:7 every man according as he purposes in his heart again even tithing we don't make you do that right we want you to obey God so as you purpose in your heart let him give &gt;&gt; not grudgingly or of necessity for God loves a cheerful giver &gt;&gt; do you believe that &gt;&gt; so attendance now let's talk about that for a minute it's simply obeying command of scripture. And I I know people get all tied up in the world that we live in. We live in an area where jobs are difficult. I understand that. I I I know it's hard sometimes to always be in the house of God. And and I know people will tell me, "So, does streaming count?" Well, I believe God sees your heart. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Right. If you could go to church and you don't, that's one thing. But if you can't go to church, and I I' I'd love for you to stream because I believe the word will do you good. &gt;&gt; I believe the atmosphere will do you good. And I believe that comes through in some level. It's not the same as being at church, but believe it comes through at some level. And so I thank you. I know most of you are faithful if you're not here to stream. And we're spread out all over the country, right? And I understand that we got people driving three hours, two hours, an hour and a half, and I'm thankful for you. It it humbles me that you find time to come to the house of God. But what are you doing? You're just obeying the command of the scripture. You're becoming a part of the church. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. So if you never come, if you don't ever come, it's hard. It's difficult. And we have people who stream who've been unable to be here for months. I do believe their heart is to be in the house of God. &gt;&gt; God sees that. He knows your heart. But the Bible tells us in Hebrews 10:24, he said, "Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works." He said, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another." That's what I'm doing this morning. Exorting one another. so much more as you see the day approaching. So, AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE END TIME, WE SEE THE THINGS HAPPEN that we've seen happen even this year. Let's just get that much closer TO GOD. LET'S DRAW UP closer to one another. Could we do that as we're nearing the end of time? LET'S GET TOGETHER THAT MUCH more &gt;&gt; as we see the day approaching. We want to do that for our young people. You're going to see a change in our youth activities. We're going to ramp up our youth meetings more often and things. And we're going to do that because the ch the kids need to be together. &gt;&gt; They need to hear the word. We're going to have youth Bible studies and things. Brother Josh Kathy's coming. We'll have another ministry will be available to help in some of those things. And I I'm thankful for that. I I just I believe the Lord has a way of just providing what we have need of. And a lot of these young people just now getting old enough to participate in that. And I'd say as parents, we have a responsibility. We can't I know you can't do everything but we have a responsibility to try to keep our kids involved in those things &gt;&gt; because it matters to our kids &gt;&gt; right you don't want your kid to feel like well I never get to go I'm not a part no let them be one of one of the group let them let them participate and I know that's difficult if you live far away but every time you can do it let's do it let's do our best people have to work and brother Brandham interpreted that scripture in Hebrews 10:25 he said don't stay home we could just stop that quote right Don't stay home. And again, people have to work. Some live far away from the church. Sometimes we get sick. People do. &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes we get an ox gets in the ditch. &gt;&gt; There's a couple Sundays a year usually that I'll take off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because I just get overwhelmed. And I don't know any other way to say that. I'm human being &gt;&gt; and sometimes I just get overwhelmed. But so I understand people are gone. Sometimes people go on vacation, but when we can go to church, let's go. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let's love one another with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then if somebody's not in church, don't don't criticize them. Pray for them. &gt;&gt; You don't know why they might be. There might be a sickness. I know I know the parties have been dealing with sickness with her sister Lena's mother. I know some of y'all have been dealing with sickness and things. You don't know what that person's dealing with. You don't know. Man, sometimes depression can keep a person out of church. &gt;&gt; Anxiety can keep a person out of church. Let's pray for them people. Don't push on them. Don't don't press them out of out of the fellowship. pray for them that God will just really get a hold of them and deliver them of that thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That there's deliverance this morning for those things. But when we can go, let's go. Let's be a strength to one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Say, "How does that give me a crown of rejoicing?" &gt;&gt; Because you paying your tithes. &gt;&gt; Gives me time to study. &gt;&gt; I'd work a job. I did for for I guess 20 years of ministry. first 20 years of ministry, I I worked a job and I've done that all I did that all my life. I'd do it now if I had to, but y'all provide me a living. So, I I take that seriously. I don't just play mess around with that. I take it seriously and study like it's a job. &gt;&gt; But it matters. It impro I'm not much of a preacher, but it does help &gt;&gt; when you have time to study. Some of our brothers aren't full-time. They don't have time to study. And so, I don't think we ought to be critical of ministry either. and I think they do a remarkable job. But because you've given me that time to study and the ability to bring in other ministry, we have brothers like brother Andrew Glover and and brother Daryl Ward and people come in here to the church. We have our meetings every year. I don't ask you for money on that. We take up an offering in the meeting and every year we we spend we spend a lot of money on that, but I'll say it every dime of it's worth it because we've seen souls won to the kingdom of God and the church revived and people healed. And I think it's worth it, church. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's worth it. &gt;&gt; But you paying your tithes lets that happen. We couldn't have the meetings we do without you being faithful. &gt;&gt; The ability to do that. That a ministry that could speak a word in due season that might change your life. God will lay it ON MY HEART TO HAVE A PREACHER IN OR HAVE ONE OF THESE BROTHERS PREACH AND MAYBE I COULDN'T SPEAK TO THAT that that certain spot IN YOUR LIFE, BUT THEY SPEAK TO IT AND IT CHANGES YOU. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. you given an offering. Let's just have this place we can come together. Are you thankful for the church or thankful for the house of worship that we have? Some place that's consecrated to the Lord. I know people who've had to set up and tear down church for years &gt;&gt; because they never had a building. But y'all have put together a place that you guys did that. I'm thankful for that. You give offerings and things so that we can have a place where the lights are on and it may be hot or cold, not to our liking, but we do have heating and AC, right? and we give an offering for that and it's consecrated to the Lord. An atmosphere can be set that sons and daughters CAN BE BORN IN AND WE COME IN AND WORSHIP together and you see your children down here in the altar. You don't REALIZE IT'S A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT a and the and the thing you're putting into the church. You putting YOUR YOU SAY, "BUT ALL I DO IS PAY MY TITHE. ALL I DO IS GIVE AN OFFERING. ALL I DO IS SHOW UP IN CHURCH." THAT'S ENOUGH TO BE A PART OF THE BODY. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? AND WHEN YOU'RE A PART OF THE BODY, YOU EVERY VICTORY THAT THE BODY HAS, THAT'S YOUR VICTORY. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M NEW." IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU'RE NEW. IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU'RE OLD. IT DON'T MATTER IF YOU'RE YOUNG. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE. BUT YOU ARE A PART OF THAT VICTORY. &gt;&gt; There are people who are now in the grave who are a part of the victory that we have here today. &gt;&gt; Who are part of this because they were faithful in their generation. Lord, HELP ME TO BE FAITHFUL IN MY GENERATION. RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I think about some of them often. I don't want to get to calling names because I'll miss some of them. But my my mind right then went to brother Ruby Wade and and his faithfulness to the house of God and his faithfulness. I watch him sit there and listen to me preach many times. His faithfulness in this church and many of your mothers and fathers and people that came that matters to the house of God. &gt;&gt; That matters to what we do today. Their our victory is their victory. As we get closer to the coming OF THE LORD, THERE WILL BE A GROUP OF people who will be alive and remain at the coming OF THE LORD. AND OUR VICTORY AT THAT MOMENT IS A VICTORY FOR THOSE WHO WENT AHEAD BY way of the grave. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so thankful for that. You being here makes a difference in the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; It makes a difference. Don't ever let the devil tell you it doesn't. &gt;&gt; Your prayers and your worship influence a stranger among us. I hope brother Jeremy don't mind me saying this, but he brother uh Wednesday night, brother Jason mentioned brother Jeremy's testimony and brother Jeremy told me he said it, I'm paraphrasing, but he said it wasn't real so much the preaching. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I saw a group of young people that had something I didn't." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If they weren't there, how could he see it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You realize, you young people realize you going to camp, you say, "I don't need camp anymore. I got the Holy Ghost last camp. Well, you don't have to go to camp to get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; But you realize you being at camp makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Makes a difference for our younger ones that are just starting and are nervous and you can help them out. It helps helps that you go you going to camp makes a difference &gt;&gt; because you being there might help set that ATMOSPHERE JUST LIKE YOU WERE HELPED by that atmosphere. Others are helped by that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And there's a crown of rejoicing with that. &gt;&gt; Oh my. There's a crown of rejoicing with that. that that you can you you can say, "LORD, THAT SOUL THAT WAS WON AT CAMP, IT'S PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS THERE. THAT SOUL THAT WAS BORN ON SUNDAY MORNING AT CHURCH WAS PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS THERE. YOU MAY NOT HAVE SUNG. YOU MAY NOT HAVE PREACHED, BUT YOU WERE THERE." &gt;&gt; Help set that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Those young people mattered. They made a difference in the life of another young person. You young people matter. That's why it matters how you treat one another. &gt;&gt; Don't you let me hear that that that you're making fun of one another and putting one another down. Don't you do that. &gt;&gt; Just because a kid's a little different or or maybe has a little bit different body or a little different way of speaking or something like that. You love one another. [applause] &gt;&gt; Love one another. It makes a difference when you love one another. &gt;&gt; Makes a difference how you treat one another. It's going to be a crown of rejoicing one day. Listen to me. There were young people who who who gave me the cold shoulder when I was young, but there were a FEW YOUNG PEOPLE THAT TOOK ME IN and let me be their friend. And in church, brother Stewart testified THE SAME THING. WE GREW UP in church and there were SOME YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HELPED US OUT. AND I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THEM. &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that I was a part of that there. MY CROWN, MY JOY, MY VICTORY is theirs as well. &gt;&gt; Every soul won by the ministry in this church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every baptism, brother Trip, every baptism, every healing &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; It belongs to you. &gt;&gt; I'll receive a reward if I'm faithful. &gt;&gt; A crown of rejoicing. But the reward will be a new body and others with a new body. I'll receive that. But you'll receive it just as much as I do. &gt;&gt; Brother Jaden, do do am I getting through? I know I'm laboring in it this morning. But am I getting through to you? It matters. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It belongs to Sister Janie. Was not here this morning, but I thought of her when I was when I was typing this up and I I I studied on this. It belongs sister Janie was faithful to the HOUSE OF GOD. AND SHE MAY NEVER SING AND SHE MAY NEVER NOT BE VERY LOUD, BUT IT BELONGS to her AS MUCH AS IT BELONGS TO ANYBODY ELSE. IT BELONGS TO THE ONES IN THE BACK. IT BELONGS to the deacons and the trustees and and and the people who help clean and every single one of you. &gt;&gt; Every victory belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How do you gather jewels for your crown? Be faithful to the house of God. Be a part of the church. Secondly, be willing to serve. &gt;&gt; Not everyone has a position or title, but everyone has a part. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I appreciate you being prayerful about things. I've I've before several different times nominated folks for things or asked them if they'd be willing to do something and they said, "Brother Ben, I don't feel like I'd be able to do that." I appreciate that. &gt;&gt; I appreciate you having the willingness and and and and that don't mean you can't ever do it. Someday you might be able to do it. &gt;&gt; And and I'm sure I'd rather have somebody like that than somebody that was campaigning for the job. But but you know, I've had several people do that, but you're still a part. Just because you have a don't have an office in the church don't mean you don't have a part. The Bible said by one spirit are we all. Someone say all. &gt;&gt; Baptized into one body. Whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free have been all made to drink into one spirit. He goes on to say the body is one not one member but many. He he types that the different parts of the body. I don't have time to read it now but if we jump down to verse 18 he said but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him. If he made you an eye, you be an I. If he made you an ear, you'd be an ear. If he made you a foot, you'd be a foot. AND BUT YOU'RE STILL part of the body. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Every officer of this church is here to serve you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? &gt;&gt; The pastor's here to serve the people. &gt;&gt; The day I can't do that is the day I need to resign. &gt;&gt; The pastor's not I'm not here. You're not here to serve me. I'm here to serve you. The associate pastor is here to serve you. The Sunday school teachers are here to serve the people. The officers in the church are here to serve the people. We got it's a responsibility. Yes, it's an honor, but it's a responsibility. The Brandon said, "You're the one who elects your pastor. You elect your trustees. You elect your deacons. You elect every office there is in this church. You the people. And it's YOUR DUTY TO STAND BY THOSE MEN." HE SAID, "FOR THEY'LL MAKE MISTAKES." &gt;&gt; OH, NO. &gt;&gt; REALLY? They're mortal. Well, did you think you elected angels? They're mortal. They'll make mistakes. They're just men. THEY'LL make mistakes. But if the president of the United States makes a mistake, do we throw him out as president? Oh, that got quiet, didn't it? We forget about it and move on. &gt;&gt; Our president just abducted another foreign leader. I don't know how to think about that, but I'm not qualified to think on that level. But &gt;&gt; but he's still the president, &gt;&gt; right? and and listen but brother Brandon that's the way we want to do our church now he said I was listening to him praise humble brother Neville a few minutes ago for those deacons and to hear back there a testimony at the door from the trustees how that with one accord you all are now stay that way you remember stand by these trustees deacons and pastor and remember when you get this together remember it's the devil's business to see that that's broke up the devil loves church disputes he hates unity he must be really mad this morning &gt;&gt; cuz he loves church disputes but he hates unity, but you taking your position makes a difference. &gt;&gt; And you may have a different opinion than somebody else. And I know people sometimes may vote differently and and they think, "Well, everybody else voted. There must be something wrong with me." No, you may be voting your conscience. And that's what you're supposed to do. But when the church makes a decision, then you back that up, &gt;&gt; right? You back that up as as much as you can. Again, he said, "Bless this church. It's lovely pastor, deacons, trustees, all the board." And remember, he was in a church called Fellowship. He said, "In this church called Fellowship, God, I pray that men and women as they walk in the door of this place, they'll fall under conviction." Oh, that's my prayer here this morning because of the lovely order of the Holy Spirit inside the building. What they say in the book of Acts, when the day of Pentecost was fully come, THEY WERE ALL WITH ONE ACCORD IN ONE PLACE. They had just had a business meeting, by the way. They just elected a new a new apostle. AND WHEN THEY GOT DONE, then hear down come from the sound of heaven as a rushing mighty wind and IT FILLED ALL THE HOUSE WHERE THEY WERE SITTING. I BELIEVE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE WHEN THE CHURCH IS IN ORDER. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU ARE FAITHFUL to the little things. &gt;&gt; You'll have a crown of rejoicing. Those of you who are willing to serve, there'll be a crown for that. But the bill, there's a crown for that. There's a crown for each one of you, &gt;&gt; for being willing to serve. &gt;&gt; Lastly, there's a crown of rejoicing for living the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You think just just being alive? Well, not so much that as being alive in Christ. Right? Your walk with the Lord. So him living in you. &gt;&gt; See, by receiving the new birth, you begin to live the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Paul says it this way, you are epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; John 14:12 says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father." He said the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer and cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers. &gt;&gt; Now stay with me for a minute. We're going to close in just a minute. And I realize once you've said that you've got to close. But the greater works he said was to impart eternal life to believers. Who can do that? Think about it. The Holy Ghost was coming given in the hands of the church to impart life. Give me that next quote. Who can do that? Who can do the greater works? Brother Brandon makes a statement. He said, "Can a man do that? Can a man do that?" Amen. He said, "What is eternal life?" He said, "The life that he lived, the life that was in him, impart to impart that to others." He said, "Can a man do that?" A son of God can. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How many sons and daughters of God do we have here this morning? &gt;&gt; Then you have the power to IMPART ETERNAL LIFE. HOW do you do that? The same way Peter did, right? He told him, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins." But you say, "Well, I'm not a preacher. I can't do what Peter did." But you point people to the place. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; JUST BY INVITING SOMEBODY TO CHURCH, &gt;&gt; you have the ability to impart eternal life if they'll OBEY THE WORD. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S not a mystical something. Brother Brandon said it's not that I give you life and I give you life. That's not it. &gt;&gt; But it's by you obeying the word, you get you create an atmosphere other people can obey the word. WELL, I SAY, GOD, LET US BE FAITHFUL TO OUR PLACE. Let's be faithful to our position. Let's be faithful so we CAN IMPART ETERNAL LIFE. DO YOU REALIZE THAT THE SONGS THAT YOU SING MIGHT CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE ETERNAL LIFE IS IMPARTED? DO YOU REALIZE YOUR PART IN THE WORSHIP SERVICE IN CONGREGATIONAL WORSHIP MIGHT CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IMPARTS ETERNAL LIFE? I I tell you what we want today. We don't want a nickel system where there's power in the pulpit but no POWER IN THE PEW. WE WANT POWER IN THE PEW TODAY. WE WANT TO SEE THE PEOPLE interact in the service. BE A PART OF WHAT GOD'S DOING. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME. IT'S NOT ABOUT BROTHER JOEL. IT'S NOT ABOUT BROTHER STEWART. IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY OTHER BROTHER THAT STANDS HERE. THIS IS ABOUT SOULS BEING won to the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; HOW DO WE DO THAT? BY BEING THE CHURCH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Bible tells us we're the salt of the earth. But if the salt had lost his savor, see salt over time loses its ability to have any make a difference. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh God, say God reinvigorate my life. Make me salty again. [snorts] Where which shall it be salted as forth good for nothing but to be cast out be trodden underfoot of men? They use salt in the roaming the highways just trotting underfoot. [snorts] Salt saves by contact. It creates thirst. Oh, and we know the fountain of life. &gt;&gt; So, do you realize how much power there is in an individual who has the ability to create thirst? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us to let our speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Seize. I say, "Lord, reseason me today. &gt;&gt; Reese my speech where I'm not negative all the time." You young people, it matters how you talk in your own home. &gt;&gt; That might make a difference to your parents, you you elders. IT MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO those around you. It might make a difference to the people uh all around you that that that they know that you're saying the right thing at the right time. &gt;&gt; You being POSITIVE TO YOUR WIFE OR TO YOUR HUSBAND OR to your children makes a difference. Let your speech be with grace, seasoned with salt. You may know how you ought to answer every man. Let your speech be seasoned by the way that you live. So, it's one thing for me to say something. It's another thing for me to say it and do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation one, I'm going to close with this. In Revelation one, his voice was the voice of many waters. his voice. John sees him there with his feet like brass and all the wonderful that that white wig on him and coming as a judge. He sees him and when he sees him, he said he fell down like dead. Such a glorious sight. But when he spoke, it was the voice of many waters. Revelation chapter 1, the voice of many waters. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said that was the voice of the ministry. &gt;&gt; Do you know he said that? the voice of the ministry down through the ages. The voice of many waters is the voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He but he he said this about that. He he he expanded it beyond the ministry to a LIFE BECAUSE YOUR LIFE HAS A VOICE. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; Pe if your speech is not seasoned by your life, people don't believe you. &gt;&gt; That's why it BOTHERS ME SO MUCH WHEN PEOPLE CALL BROTHER BRANDON a hypocrite. was not a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When he was alive, he said, "Not even my critics call me that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He lived what he preached. &gt;&gt; We live what we preach. &gt;&gt; And if we don't, IF WE FAIL, we repent. &gt;&gt; SAY, "GOD, HELP ME THAT MY MY LIFE can season WHAT I SAY." WHY WOULD YOUR KIDS LISTEN to you? You tell them, "DON'T GOD DON'T like it when you lose your temper. God don't like it when you when you say that CUSS WORD. GOD DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU DO THIS, THAT, OR THE OTHER." WHY WOULD YOU Why would they listen to you if you don't do it? THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHY WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME IF I DON'T DO IT? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU with me now? But brother Brandon SAID, "IF YOU'RE A PREACHER, YOU'RE called to the pulpit to preach." &gt;&gt; If you're not, you're still a preacher. &gt;&gt; Oh my. How many preachers do we have this morning? &gt;&gt; See, there wasn't just preachers in the upper room. There was 120 men, women, children. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But they all received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they all mattered. THEY WERE ALL IN ONE ACCORD &gt;&gt; IN ONE PLACE. AND THEY WERE THE VOICE OF MANY WATERS. WHAT? LISTEN, it was not this this is fresh. I didn't think I never thought about this, BUT IT WAS NOT Peter's preaching that attracted the people. It was them staggering like drunk men. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Peter's preaching that attracted them. Peter's preaching is what caused them to know how to be saved. But the thing that attracted their attention, oh my, was 120 people under the influence OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT WAS THEIR WALK. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh, COULD YOU JUST RECOGNIZE THAT TODAY? IT'S NOT THE THING THAT'S ATTRACTING THE PEOPLE TO THE CHURCH. IT'S NOT ME. IT'S NOT THE PREACHERS. IT'S YOUR WALK. &gt;&gt; GOOD. I hope you're hearing me today. If you're a preacher, you're called to the pulpit to preach. If you're not, YOU'RE STILL A PREACHER, BUT LIVE THE PEOPLE of sermon. LET YOUR SERMON BE LIVED. THAT'S WHY I DON'T BELIEVE WE should be some cult pulled off in the woods somewhere away from everybody. We should live among the people. Let your SERMON BE LIVED. AND IT'S THE VOICE OF GOD THAT'LL BRING REPROACH TO THEM WHO REJECT IT. &gt;&gt; THEY SAY NO ONE COULD PUT A FINGER ON HIS OR HER LIFE. THEY'RE SWEET, LOVING. If there ever was a man of God, it's that man or that woman. See, LIVE YOUR SERMONS. DON'T TRY TO PREACH THEM IF YOU'RE NOT CALLED TO BE A PREACHER. You get all mixed up anyhow. He said messed up. You'll get people tangled UP. YOU WON'T KNOW. WELL, YOU'LL RUIN them and yourself, too. How many times have we seen that? &gt;&gt; He said, just live your sermon. THE PREACHERS CALLED TO PREACH IS AND TO LIVE IT, TOO. IF YOU CAN'T LIVE IT, STOP PREACHING IT. BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LIVE YOUR SERMONS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He said, "Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville." I wonder if we can make that this place this morning. I know you've heard it many times. WHY DON'T WE HEAR IT THIS MORNING WITH FRESH ears that we realize we are part of that body? Oh, how we need IN HEARTY ARKANSAS THOUSANDS of lived voices. THE THUNDER OF GOD THUNDERING OUT IN sweetness and holiness and purity. UNDEFILED LIVES WALKING AROUND IN THE EARTH TODAY WITHOUT A BLEMISH. YES, SIR. REAL CHRISTIANS, THAT'S THUNDER AGAINST THE ENEMY. &gt;&gt; GOOD. &gt;&gt; Your life matters to me. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Watch my son become a young man that loves the Lord. And that matters to me. It encourages me. &gt;&gt; Watch my daughters become ladies that love the Lord. That encourages me. You young people, I watch you. I watch some of you families. You begin to serve the Lord. You begin to come to the house of God. That encourages me. It means the word works. &gt;&gt; Your walk made a difference to me. &gt;&gt; Today, Sister Betty, you showing up at church made a difference today. Every one of you that you being in the house of God makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Walking in sweetness and holiness and purity. Don't think it don't make a difference. That's a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I watch some of you change. There's a difference. &gt;&gt; Some of you work out in the public and and and you don't think how much of a difference you make, but you're different from the world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, the girls are not just not the boys." know the boys are different. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we can tell I've had ministers come to me and talk about young men in this church and say they live they're they're I can tell they're Christians. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can tell they they really love the Lord because I met THEM AT WORK. I SAW THEM AT WORK AND I SAW THEIR ATTITUDE AND THE WAY THEY TREATED PEOPLE AND I KNOW THERE'S A Christian there. &gt;&gt; It makes a difference. &gt;&gt; Walking around in the earth without a blemish. Real Christians. That's thunder against the enemy. How should we do that? How should we gain a crown of rejoicing? Live a life so there's no difference between preaching and practice. Come on. Not that we preach something one way and then we go out and live any way we want to. But let's keep our preaching and practice the same. &gt;&gt; Not to change the word of God because we're going through something, but keep our preaching AND OUR PRACTICE SAME. IF WE SAY we believe it, let's just believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Musicians, go ahead and come. Brother Brandham lived it and preached it. [snorts] That's why beyond the curtain of time. He said there was millions. Millions. Think about that for a minute. But you say, "Well, how's that? Well, it made an impact in your life. How did the message cross your path?" Think about that for just a minute. Some of y'all had no message teaching or bringing up, but it crossed your path somehow. Made a difference in your life. How did that happen? Brother Brandham was faithful in his generation to go and millions cried out. Right? He said, "I preached what Paul preached. I was faithful to the scriptures and millions cried out. We're resting on that. They come up to him and they hugged him. They said, "My precious brother." What was it? The stars in his crown. His crown of rejoicing. He said, "A little lady that led to Christ when she was 90 years old and she was young. Some of y'all, you'll have to introduce yourself to me because I didn't know you when you were young. But I want you to come looking for me. I believe in it. I've stood by the side of too many caskets, preached too many funerals to not believe in a resurrection. They're going to be there on that day. And I pray that I've made a difference. I might fail in some way and maybe I maybe I die in a car wreck or something might happen. God forbid. But if I did, I pray that I've already made enough of a difference. That's why we should never sell short. Anyone who's ever stood in the pulpit, anyone who's ever served as a trustee or a deacon, we should give them honor for that, respect for that, for what they did because it mattered. What you do for God matters. Even if you're older, you can't do it no more. Something's happened, you can't do it no more. What you did for God matters. If you preach the word, you preach the truth, it matters. They went and grabbed a hold of me and said, "My precious brother, there's something in me that longs for EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT. I KNOW I I'LL never stand in his position. He was a messenger to the age. I don't want to be that. I don't want that kind of responsibility, but let me STAND WITH THOSE WHO HAD an influence over." I believe when I get there, I'm going to see Brother Brandham, but I I don't know if that's the first person I'll see because I never knew Brother Brandon. But there's some I knew. I knew Brother Perry Green. Brother Perry made a lot of mistakes, but I knew Brother Perry made a difference in my life. I knew some of our loved ones that passed on. We buried maybe half the church that was at Bransville when I pastored there. But those people made a difference in my life. You made a difference in my life. I believe I'm going to see you. If you if I pass on or you pass on ahead of time, believe I'm going to see you if we both go into rapture. We're going to both see some people and I'm going to be looking for some. Brother Daryl Ward, I'm sure, will outlive me. But if Brother Daryl goes on, I'll be looking for it. Made a difference in my life. Brother Daryl always told that story. He talked about the man walking along. He said there was a walking along a beach and there's a there was so starfish get washed up on the beach and they dry out and they die. And he said he just kept picking them up and throwing them back in the ocean, picking them up, throw them back in the ocean. Somebody come along and laugh at him and said, "What are you doing that for? It don't make a difference. There's millions of them." He said, "It made a difference to that one. Made a difference to this one. I'm going to be looking for him. I'm be part of that crown of rejoicing." Are you with me, church? Some have already went on. I'm going to be my pastor. I had for many years with a Bill Ivy who who taught me and and and and trained me up and we've not agreed on every little thing, but I he made a difference in my life. Brother Joel testified of his pastor that he had in the hot springs made a difference in his life. Listen to me, church. You've made a difference in my life. I thought of brother Paul Seymour. He reminded me of it the other day. There's a man by the name of I believe it's Kenny Mali. Is that right? Kenny Mali was an African man. He never met Brother Paul. He come by one day and he said he said, "The Lord told me you were going to give me a job." And he come by there, Brother Paul's testimony, HE COME BY and he made he he was a real worker. When brother Paul finally give him a job, he he he made a real he was a real worker. He said, "I've seen Christ in him." AND HE BEGAN TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE MESSAGE. AND BROTHER PAUL'S here today because a man come out of the jungle in Africa. YOU DON'T THINK GOD KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING? A MAN COME out of the jungle IN AFRICA AND PREACHED THE MESSAGE. NOT BY WHAT HE SAID. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF HE WAS A PREACHER, but he lived it. OH, IN HARDY, ARKANSAS TODAY, WE NEED THOUSANDS OF LIVE VOICES. I'LL SAY THIS. I don't know if Brother Kenny's still alive or what what'll happen there, but whichever one of them makes it first. I believe Brother Paul's going to go looking for Brother Kenny. He Brother Kenny may not recognize the difference he MADE IN BROTHER PAUL'S LIFE, BUT Brother Paul knows it. You may NOT NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE YOU MADE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES, BUT SOMEBODY KNOWS IT. OH, I believe there's a crown of rejoicing. I want there to be that crown. Live a life so somebody is looking for you. Eternal [music] life is living for others. Would you bow your heads with me? I want someone to look for me. Say, "If you had never lived, we wouldn't be [music] here. You make a difference to your children. I'm not trying to make you emotional today. I'm trying to help you understand. Some of you young couples with babies, you make a difference to those babies. Don't give up. Persevere. Make a difference. It'll matter. The world may never see it. Your name may never be in marquee letters, but you made a difference. I'll say this today. I've got some things to say at the memorial service for Sister Cletus, but she was a piano player. A lot of people didn't know that. Sister Cletus didn't know that. She started playing piano as we just sit and wait on the spirit this morning with our heads bowed. Sister Cleth learned to play piano because there was nobody else to do it. And she was probably never that good, but she loved to play [music] because it was something she could do to help. She made a difference. I spent 5 years there and we wouldn't had a piano player without her. Made a difference in my life. Church, it matters. What shall I do, brother? Live your life. Live, live so that when you pass on, somebody will say, "I'm going to go looking for you." Make the little sacrifices now. It'll be worth it all over there. Lay up your treasures over there, not over here. Make a difference in somebody's life. Can we pray? Maybe you like to slip up a hand to the Lord. Say, "Brother Ben, I I want somebody come looking for me. I want a crown of rejoicing. YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE. You're being faithful. you. God bless those hands and my hands are up. I listen, it'll be some of you with greater crown than I have with more people over there than I have because of the way that you lived and the people that you contacted at the bank or at the factory or or or washing the dishes, whatever it WAS THAT YOU DID. SOME OF YOU MOTHERS WITH your families, you made a difference in their life. Oh God, I want to be I want to live like that. Lord Jesus, [music] I pray that we would not be so self-involved and so worried about how Lord that whether we got recognition that we wouldn't understand, oh God, that there is a place where every every little thing is marked down as we preached last week, Lord, that the bad has been cut out, the evil has been taken off our record. And I'm so thankful for that, Lord. But you said we would stand before that throne but with an answer for both good and bad. And what happens to the good? I pray, oh God, that we would gain a reward, Lord. Not monetary, not not some kind of gold crown. As the old brother said, Lord, that Lord, that that he got to a place where he was dying AND THEY SAID, "YOU'RE GOING TO have a robe and a crown." He said, "Don't tell me about no robe and crown." Said, "Just let me look at him. Let me see his face, Lord. I want to see your face. I want to see the faces of these people, Lord. May they everyone make it. If there be one here this morning that's never given their life to you. I pray they'd completely surrender to you today. May there may there be a difference made, Lord, because of our faithfulness in this service. Lord, I I didn't do the best job, but Lord, I stood when you asked me to stand and I'm here, Lord. I stood for you. Would you stand for me? I pray you, Grant. Lord God, I pray you'd move in this service or move in our church as we begin a NEW YEAR. OH, GOD. May we be that much more consecrated. May we may we have a depth to us, Lord, that we've never had. Lord, a rejoicing that we've never had, an understanding of the times that we live in, OH GOD. GIVE US REVELATION, LORD. GIVE US STRENGTH TO PURSUE THE BATTLE. OH GOD, LET US FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT of faith like never before. As we reach the end, may we not go down WITH THE WORLD, BUT MAY WE BE OF THOSE, LORD, THAT BRIDE THAT WAS marching up. I pray you grant it, Lord. One day we'll start to see our loved ones. I believe it with all of my heart, oh God. I pray you'd grant it today. We thank you for all that you've done. Bless these people, Lord. If there's one, Lord, maybe feeling a little low, maybe not feeling apart. I pray you'd help them to recognize, God, that they are a part of the body of Christ. Grant it, Lord, we pray. Thank you for them, oh God. We pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, [singing] I just want to please the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In his [music] will [singing] in every way. Oh, to be lost. To [music] be lost [singing] in his presence. Oh, found in his [music and singing] likeness. Oh, hear me say well someday.

Oh, granny Lord, help help me, Lord, that I can live a life so somebody comes looking for me, Lord. I want to please you, God. Oh, granny, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] to be [music] lost. That's all right. If you need to come and pray, why don't we why don't we just have a season of prayer here? We got time for that, church. If you need to pray, come on, go here and say, "Well done. I want to be there on that day. I don't want to be there. Just be there when I have a crown." [singing and music] Oh yes. I just want to leave. Hallelujah. The Lord. [singing and music] Oh yes, Lord. Oh, be his will in every [singing] way. Oh granny Lord to be lost [music] in his presence. This is a good place to pray. It's a good place to ask him, Lord. Take take it all out of me, oh God.
